        "text": "These services are a turnkey solution that streamlines any phase of a satellite’s life cycle, providing satellite operators with support in any stage of spacecraft design, development, and operations without the need for direct investments in skills and facilities.\n\nLaunch and Deployment\n\nRideshare\n\nRideshare is a launch and deployment service that relies on third-party compatible launchers equipped with proprietary dispensers to release satellites into a standard parking orbit. The service is ideal for missions where a precise deployment is not critical for mission success.\n\nPrecision Deployment\n\nPrecision Deployment is a launch and deployment service that relies on ION Satellite Carrier, a proprietary orbital transfer vehicle operated by D-Orbit. A satellite is boarded into ION, which transports it across orbits into its final operational slot. This service is essential for missions operating in highly customized orbits that are not served by rideshare launches.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nPrecise Deployment and Phasing for Constellations\n\nPrecise Deployment and Phasing for Constellations is an advanced launch and deployment service designed for satellite constellation operators to phase a batch of spacecraft quickly and safely along one or more orbital planes. The service is enabled by ION Satellite Carrier, D-Orbit’s proprietary orbital transfer vehicle, which carries the satellites along the constellation’s orbital plane and releases each spacecraft in its designated orbital slot. This strategy reduces significantly the time required to phase a batch of satellites along an orbital plane, bringing forward the revenue-generating phase of the mission and enabling optimal use of the spacecraft’s life.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nAdd-On Services\n\nInsurance\n\nWe offer a turnkey insurance package covering the whole life cycle of a small satellite, from engineering to the end-of-mission. The insurance covers every one of the satellite’s payloads, providing you with a parachute in case of partial failure. A partnership with the most important insurance players in the market enables us to provide competitive conditions.\n\nMission Analysis and Design\n\nWe provide support during the mission analysis and design phase of a multi-satellite mission to identify and exploit the optimal use of mission budgets enabled by ION Satellite Carrier’s deployment strategies.\n\nMission Control Operations\n\nWe can take care of developing onboard software for hosted payloads to process incoming commands, perform mission operations, process raw data, and downlink information.\n\nShipping and Transportation\n\nWe offer specialized transportation services from the manufacturing site to our integration facility. We are prepared for all transportation needs, ensuring the integrity of the equipment.\n\nION Satellite Carrier\n\nION Satellite Carrier is the enabling technology behind our deployment and IOD services.\n\nION is a satellite platform with a configurable payload bay that can be equipped with a combination of proprietary or third-party launch dispensers, CubeSat-sized payloads, microsatellites, and instruments like lenses and antennas to be tested in orbit.\n\nThanks to its propulsion module, ION Satellite Carrier can travel across orbits characterized by different attitude, and local time of ascending node (LTAN) through the course of a mission, and deploy each hosted satellite in a custom orbit. ION can also perform operations on hosted payloads in their optimal operating position.\n\nMultiple ION Satellite Carrier missions launched throughout the year provide operators with several launch windows to choose from.\n\nION Hosted Payload Service\n\nION Hosted Payload Service is a service that enables space hardware developers to quickly get a payload to orbit for testing or operations.\n\nThe payloads are hosted inside ION Satellite Carrier, D-Orbit’s proprietary orbital transfer vehicle, which is launched multiple times a year. An innovative plug-and-play mechanical, electrical, and data interface greatly simplifies integration and testing. This advanced degree of standardization allows D-Orbit to easily re-arrange the launch schedule to accommodate last-minute changes and enables operators to repeat a given experiment over different missions.\n\nDuring the experiment, ION changes its attitude to provide optimal exposure to the sun, darkness, Earth, and horizon. The hosting spacecraft provides resources like power, uplink, downlink, memory, and more. The availability of multiple launch options in LEO, SSO, and GEO every year provides the ability to switch launches in case of delay.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nD-Orbit Cloud Platform\n\nD-Orbit Cloud Platform is a state-of-the-art innovative space cloud-based technology that will revolutionize the speed that data is shared between space and ground.\n\nData Computing\n\nIn-orbit space computing through AI. Our Cloud Platform makes it possible to personalize your data experience with personalized apps and integrate multiple data sources.\n\nImmediate Results\n\nThrough the D-Orbit Cloud Platform it's possible to know when something is happening and respond close to real-time without the need for ground processing.\n\nData Storage\n\nOur service allows users to store data securely and provides immediate access to relevant data, saving time, and resources, and increasing productivity.\n\nPractical applications include:\n\nCivil security and public protection: Object detection (illegal shipping, piracy, smuggling, etc.); crowd location and detection; atmosphere and pollution alert.\n\nDisaster monitoring and response: Real-time detection (wildfires, floods, landslides, avalanches, traffic accidents, tsunamis); real-time alerts (directly to ground and via network to authorities); real-time response support; cross-task other satellites (e.g. targeted observation for a passing commercial SAR)\n\nClimate and weather monitoring: Detection of dangerous weather events; prioritization of data inputs into model ensembles to obtain earlier and better forecasts.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nSatellite as a-Service (SaaS)\n\nThe Satellite as a Service model allows customers to leverage the capabilities of satellite technology without having to invest in and operate their own satellite infrastructure. Through this model, customers can simply purchase operations on ION to access services that range from basic connectivity to more advanced operations that leverage satellite data.\n\nThis model makes satellite-based services more accessible to a wide range of customers, including small businesses and organizations that may not have the resources to invest in their own satellite infrastructure.\n\nIRIDE\n\nA great example of the Satellite as a Service model is IRIDE, a space-based observation program initiated by the Italian government. D-Orbit will provide one SAR (synthetic aperture radar) satellite, called NOX, and will manage its flight operations segment on behalf of the end user.\n\nThe satellite constellation will use various detection techniques and technologies, including microwave and optical imaging in different frequencies, and will provide data for applications in commercial startups, SMEs, and industry.\n\nYou can learn more about IRIDE and NOX here.​\n\nThe app provides telemetry, trajectory updates, telecommand, and downstream through graphical and command line controls. A 2D/3D orbit visualization tool provides satellite tracking based on two-line orbital elements (TLE) propagation.\n\nTelecommands can be generated, time-tagged, and uploaded via manual and database-retrievable telecommand stacks. Automatic warnings provide notification of predefined anomalies through emails and messaging. The system logs all commands, enabling historical analysis and creation of procedures to automate common tasks.\n\nThe interface can be adapted to the specific needs of each satellite operator, providing a versatile and modular suite of tools to support even the most complex and demanding missions. The app is accessible from any location through a variety of computer platforms, including mobile.\n\nThanks to a highly modular software architecture, Aurora can be tailored around the needs of the most common smallsat mission architectures. The app supports the CubeSat space protocol (CSP), which can be customized further. A high-performance cloud infrastructure, with extremely high reliability and availability, features AES256 encryption with 2FA token user authentication to ensure a state-of-the art cyber security protection. A worldwide network of ground stations, in partnership with Leaf Space and Amazon AWS Ground Station, ensures global coverage tailored to the needs and budget of any space mission.\n\nAlways up to dateAurora's cloud architecture enables operators to significantly reduce mission costs by eliminating all the expenses connected to software design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.\n\nCustom User InterfaceThe user interface can be customized to the needs and preferences of individual mission operators.\n\nFlexible IT infrastructureA web interface enables the use of cost effective commodity hardware to create the desired IT infrastructure.
