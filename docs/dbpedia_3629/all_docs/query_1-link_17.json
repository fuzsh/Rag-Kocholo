        "text": "This study covers 16 species in three families collected from 20 different provinces (ostn) of Iran between the years 2005 and 2007, with a summary of previous studies on Iranian scorpions. C. petriolii is recorded for the first time from East Azerbaijan, Qom and Urumiyeh provinces; H. zagrosensis from Qazvin Province; I. krali from Qom Province; O. doriae from Hamadan Province. A second record of H. acanthocercus is given where the first record was from Khoozestan Province.\n\nBackground: Scorpions have medical importance in the studied area with 2377 cases of envenoming during past six years. This study was the first to explore the scorpion species and dispersion in the Kazerun District during 2014–2015. Methods: The studied sites were selected based on different topographic conditions such as plain, foothill and mountainous which formed four geographical zones with three villages in each zone. The sampling was carried out twice each month throughout the year. Daytime collections were carried out using hand digging tools for moving stones and excavate the borrows, as well as night sampling, is done with the black light device. The co­ordinate of locations was recorded with a GPS. The collected specimens were maintained in 70% ethanol and identified using authorized keys. Results: Overall, 800 scorpions were sampled from different parts of Kazerun District, bringing the species rich­ness to 9 belonged to 3 families of Buthidae, Scorpionidae, and Hemiscorp..."
