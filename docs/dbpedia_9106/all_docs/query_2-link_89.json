These measures frequently involve deploying military and security forces to targeted areas to combat organized crime.\n\nAlthough the security situation has improved, a state of exception remains in effect. As a result, security forces have increased rights to conduct searches, seizures, and detain persons of interest, including foreign citizens. Local authorities have detained foreigners, sometimes in a reportedly arbitrary manner.\n\nIf you're in El Salvador:\n\nbe aware that you may be subject to searches by security forces\n\nexpect a heightened security presence, including on roads, in public spaces, and in residential neighbourhoods\n\nalways cooperate with military and police officers\n\nalways carry valid identification and be prepared for various checkpoints\n\nlimit your movements after dark\n\nensure family or friends know where you are\n\nmonitor local media for the latest information\n\nfollow the instructions of local authorities\n\nCrime\n\nCrime is a serious problem throughout the country.\n\nViolent crime\n\nViolent crime has decreased significantly since March 2022, especially in urban areas, including the metropolitan area of San Salvador and resort areas. However, violent crime still occurs, often involving armed gang members as well as common and petty criminals.\n\nArmed robberies occur with weapons such as guns and knives, especially on public transportation. Robberies by thieves on motorcycles occur. Robberies may occur in tourist areas, especially isolated scenic spots.\n\nRemain vigilant and exercise caution at all times\n\nDon’t show signs of affluence or display valuables, particularly jewellery and electronics, including cell phones\n\nCheck in advance with local contacts, authorities or hotels to see if your chosen destination is safe and which is the best route to get there\n\nTravel in groups if possible\n\nAvoid walking after dark\n\nStay at hotels that have robust security measures\n\nKeep in mind that even the most secure locations are not completely free of risk\n\nIf you're threatened by armed criminals:\n\ndon't resist, as gang members in particular can be quick to engage in violence\n\navoid eye contact with the perpetrators\n\nPetty crime\n\nPetty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, is common.\n\nThieves also break into cars parked in public places.\n\nAvoid displaying signs of affluence in public, including when landing at El Salvador's international airport\n\nEnsure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times\n\nAvoid carrying large amounts of cash\n\nBe particularly discreet when using ATMs\n\nChoose supervised parking lots if available\n\nKeep car doors locked and windows closed at all times\n\nDon't leave any valuables in your car\n\nIf you're robbed, go to a police station and report the crime immediately.\n\nMost Salvadorans don’t speak English or French. You should not expect assistance in your preferred language.\n\nGreater San Salvador Area\n\nIn the city of San Salvador, neighbourhoods such as Escalón, La Cima, San Benito and San Francisco are relatively safe.\n\nTo attract more tourists, local authorities have made efforts to secure a few blocks in the downtown area, known as the Centro Histórico de San Salvador.

They are often known as “zonas marginales” or “comunidades.”\n\nAvoid crossing an area that is a known criminal stronghold, even if you are only trying reach a safer neighbourhood.\n\nNeighbouring cities to the west of the capital are generally safe. These include:\n\nAntiguo Cuscatlán, including Santa Elena\n\nNuevo Cuscatlán\n\nSanta Tecla, including Ciudad Merliot\n\nCrime occurs more frequently in cities to the north and east, such as:\n\nApopa\n\nCiudad Delgado\n\nIlopango\n\nMejicanos\n\nSan Martín\n\nSoyapango\n\nBorder crossings\n\nBorder areas often see higher criminal activity and violence, including in rural areas.\n\nEl Salvador lies along well-established Central American trafficking routes.
