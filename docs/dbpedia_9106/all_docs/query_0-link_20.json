        "text": "What are a few images that come to mind when you think of traveling in Brazil? Probably scenes of beautiful beaches, samba in colorful streets, Jiu Jitsu and Capoeira, or fresh coconut water and savory meats.\n\nAnother might be the portrait of a Bahian woman, dressed in a white blouse, a colorful and voluminous skirt, wearing a headpiece and beaded necklace.\n\nIn the city of Salvador, you will find all of the above and much more!\n\nIn this blog, I share our 3-day itinerary including tips for visiting one of the oldest cities in the western hemisphere and our favorite places to eat and explore in Salvador.\n\nA little History\n\nSalvador was the first capital of Brazil from 1549 to 1763. The capital then moved to Rio de Janeiro and finally Brasília, where it remains today.\n\nThe city was one of the most strategic in the Americas and Salvador’s location on the Bay of All Saints served as a key maritime port. Furthermore, the capital was conveniently located in the middle of the 4,500-mile-long Brazilian coastline.\n\nBrazil’s primary industries at the time were sugarcane and the transatlantic slave trade. 4 million Africans entered Brazil through Salvador. They brought with them their traditions, cuisine, and religion which have since become the backbone of culture in Salvador.\n\nThanks to its tropical climate, Salvador’s weather ranges from warm to hot with a mix of rain showers throughout the year. Travelers can expect less rain and more heat between October and February. This time of year is the most popular time to visit Salvador, with the summer months December, January and February being the busiest.\n\nIf visiting in February, be cautious of planning a trip around Carnaval especially if you prefer to not take part in the festivities. Hotel and flight prices will generally be more expensive during the month of February as well.\n\nOur Experience Visiting in March\n\nWe planned our visit at the end of March in hopes of still being able to enjoy the warm summer weather and minimal rain while also avoiding crowds. During our visit, day-time highs were in the mid-80s with lows in the upper 70s.\n\nIt rained every day but was always in quick, passing spurts. Carrying an umbrella is a good idea as it was too hot to even think about wearing a rain jacket.\n\nWhen we arrived, it was raining and the sun had just set. The streets around our pousada in Pelourinho felt empty and unwelcoming. However the next morning the sun was shining and you could feel the inviting energy of the historic city center of Pelourinho just from the balcony of our hotel room.\n\n“Brazil is not for beginners” – Brazilian composer, Tom Jobim\n\nLeading up to our trip, everytime we mentioned to Brazilians that we were visiting Salvador they would instruct us not to wear any jewelry, not to walk around at night or even down empty streets during the day, and not to accept “presents” from vendors on the street.\n\nNone of these warnings were new to us but they demonstrated that even Brazilians adhere to the same precautions and felt very strongly about making sure we understood the risks.\n\nThere are panhandlers along with city-vetted and non-vetted street vendors who can become pushy at times. If you’re uninterested in what they have to offer, it is best to politely say no thank you and keep walking\n\nPlan Ahead – If you will be walking, know your route to avoid having to use your cellphone and try to always use busy, well lit streets.\n\nUse a Fannypack – Luckily fanny packs or crossbody bags are in-vogue and they’re super convenient while being the safest way to carry your belongings.\n\nLeave Your Bling at Home – Opt for simple accessories that are not eye-catching. We did wear our Apple watches but avoided wearing necklaces that can be easily pulled off.\n\nWhen in Doubt, Just Uber – Uber is safe and reliable in Brazil. We usually love walking in new cities but chose to rely more on Uber in Salvador as a measure of safety.\n\nNothing Is Free – Know that if someone offers you a bracelet or body paint, lets you join in on their Capoeira or drum session, or wants to take a photo with you, they will expect payment in return.\n\nFollowing our trip, my husband and I both agreed Salvador would be an ambitious first city to visit in Brazil, especially for the sporadic traveler. While we never felt in danger, there were a couple moments of unease where we needed to exercise caution and be more aware of our surroundings.\n\nThese sentiments can be true of any big city (including most in the U.S.) and should not be interpreted as a reason to avoid Salvador. The pros of visiting strongly outweigh any cons that honestly are not unique to just Salvador in South America.\n\nBahiacafé Hotel felt like a refuge in the middle of Pelourinho. The hotel is conveniently located off of the Praça da Sé. Although our room was only on the second floor of the hotel, it was mostly protected from the nighttime noise in the praça. If you’re worried about noise, I always recommend a travel sound machine. They are life (sleep) savers!\n\nDinner at Restaurante Maria Mata Mouro\n\nA four minute walk from Bahiacafe Hotel is Restaurante Maria Mata Mouro. On the walk, we began to feel the immense presence of the historical buildings and churches that line the praças.\n\nRestaurante Maria Mata Mouro has seating options in the front and back, including a patio. Due to the rain, we opted to sit in the back near the live music.\n\nAll of the cocktails sounded delicious but the waitress recommended the Meladinha: cachaça, ginger simple syrup and lime. We’ve since tried to make a copycat version of Meladinha at home.\n\nFor dinner we enjoyed the Camarão Cacio e Pepe, Bruscheta de Tomate Assado, and Arroz de Frutos do Mar.\n\nAnother advantage of participating in a walking tour, especially in a busy and sometimes chaotic area like Pelourinho, is that you’re not approached by vendors or panhandlers as much. Before the tour started, our guide provided a similar explanation of how to safely enjoy Salvador that we’d heard before.\n\nI believe we felt more comfortable taking our time walking, standing around, speaking English and taking photos in the presence of our guide than if it had just been the two of us.\n\nI booked the 2.5 hour tour ahead of time through Airbnb Experiences (~$25pp) but there are free options available through sites like Civitais.\n\nThe guide is an architect and urban planner who is super knowledgeable of the area and the greater Salvador region. The tour began near the Elevador Lacerda, weaved through the various praças or plazas and concluded in front of the Fundação Casa de Jorge Amado.\n\nFor lunch we went to a restaurant suggested by our guide, Restaurante Tropicália. We enjoyed cold Spaten beers and a bowl of moqueca for two at a table on the sidewalk, which allowed for some great people watching.\n\nEven though we were stuffed with moqueca, we knew we had to try the famous Cubana Sorvetes. Luckily, we didn’t have to walk far since they have a location just down the street from Restaurante Tropicália. We choose to taste two of their most popular flavors: Coco and Nata Goiaba.\n\nNow totally stuffed after our ice cream, we decided to grab an Uber to Feira de São Joaquim. We opted to visit this market over the Mercado Modelo because we weren’t interested in looking at souvenirs. Instead we wanted to browse stalls full of local ingredients and even some objects pertaining to Candomblé at the Feira de São Joaquim.\n\nThis market was also on the way to Ponta do Humaitá, where we planned to watch the sunset.\n\nA visit to the Feira de São Joaquim would be enhanced by a guide who could explain the origin and use of some of the unique fruits, vegetables, spices, fish and meat sold at the market. While we enjoyed browsing, it was a little chaotic – but in a good way. I’m pretty sure we were the only non-locals there at the time of our visit.\n\nAfter a few laps around the market, we grabbed a beer at one of several very casual restaurants located behind the market on the Bay of All Saints.\n\nFrom Feira de São Joaquim we Uber’d to Ponta do Humaitá. Ponta do Humaitá is a well known spot to watch the sunset over the Bay of All Saints. There is also a fort, Forte de Monte Serrat and a catholic church, Igreja e Mosteiro Nossa Senhora do Monte Serrat, nearby and worth checking out before sunset.\n\nWe bought some drinks from a kiosk and took in the sights around us – a pick-up soccer game and a few people fishing on the pier before sunset. Unfortunately a few minutes before, a rainstorm quickly passed through and there weren’t many colors visible for the sunset.\n\nThe second day ended with dinner at Cuco Bistrô, and it did not disappoint. The menu is very large, featuring several Bahian and Brazilian inspried cuisine options.\n\nTo drink I recommend the Cuca Fresca: cachaça, infused hibiscus, lime and sugar or a Caipirinha Especial: cachaça artesanal, lime, jabuticaba, cravo, and sugar.\n\nIf you come hungry, order the For the Matulão: grilled queijo coalho (a type of cheese in brazil that is grilled over charcoal) with banana puree and honey for an appetizer.\n\nMain dish recommendations include the codorna or quail wrapped in bacon and stuffed with housemade farofa and served with mushrooms or for something simpler, steak au gratin with potatoes.\n\nLeave room for dessert and order the house special marquise de tapioca. This heavenly dessert is a lightly fried tapioca cake and served with coconut ice cream, ginger and doce de leite syrup and coconut milk. It was honestly one of the best desserts I’ve ever eaten.\n\nI arranged for us to take a 1 hour Capoeira lesson at the Barra Lighthouse, the southernmost tip of the peninsula. We knew very little about Capoeira beyond that it is a mix of dance and martial arts created by slaves in Brazil as a way to practice self defense.\n\nCapoeira, once banned, is now recognized as an official sport and cultural practice in Brazil.\n\nOur 1 hour class was a fun and easy way to not only learn more about the history of the foundational movements and their symbolism in Capoeira, but also put them to practice. Since the lesson was outside, we did have a little bit of an audience towards the end but it was totally worth some of the embarrassment.\n\nInside the Santo Antonio Fort, where the lighthouse is located, there is the Bahia Nautical Museum. Plan to spend 45 minutes to an hour browsing the museum which features maritime and military history during Salvador’s time as Brazil’s capital. The exhibits also include nautical instruments, maps, and ship renderings.\n\nThe view from the top of the Barra Lighthouse is worth the climb and entry fee. Entry to the museum and lighthouse is R$15 for adults and free for kids under seven. Its exhibits are in Portuguese, Spanish and English.\n\nFrom Morro do Cristo we took an Uber to Rio Vermelho. Rio Vermelho is one of Salvador’s more hip and eclectic neighborhoods. Its streets are full of restaurants, bars and food stands that become especially lively at night.\n\nLooking back, I would have booked a hotel in the Rio Vermelho neighborhood in order to experience better nightlife and have a greater range of restaurant options.\n\nSince we had plans to go to the Balé Folclórico that evening in Pelourinho, I knew this was our only chance to visit Rio Vermelho. We were also eager to finally get a taste of some famous acarajé.\n\nIn a planning mishap, we missed the small detail that the acarajé stand most highly recommended to us, Acarajé da Cira, didn’t open until 3pm.\n\nNeeding something to eat following our Capoeira lesson and walking from the lighthouse, we made the easy decision to regroup at a local brewery – ArtMalte.\n\nA Casa do Rio Vermelho is a museum that was once the home of the famous Brazilian writers Jorge Amado and his wife Zélia. The home is said to be preserved exactly the way it was lived in by the couple. It is full of art and artifacts from their storied life together.\n\nUnfortunately, almost all of the museum is in Portuguese. If you’re a non-Portuguese speaker but are a fan of Jorge Amado’s work or a fellow writer, I believe the museum is still worth visiting. It has a similar vibe to the Frida Kahlo Museum in Mexico City.\n\nWanting to redeem our failed sunset from the night prior we walked to the other end of Pelourinho and grabbed a seat on the back patio at Antique Bistrô. The weather gods must have had it out for us because it rained again right before sunset. The atmosphere on the patio was still excellent as were the cachaça cocktails.\n\nAs a former dancer and someone with a strong interest in culture and art, seeing the Balé Folclórico da Bahia was a must do in Salvador.\n\nThe Balé Folclórico da Bahia considers itself a Folk Dance Company. The company was founded in 1988 to preserve and share the rich way of life and culture in Bahia through music and movement. In addition to its weekly performances at the Miguel Santana Theater in Perlourinho, the company also tours worldwide.\n\nFollowing our Capoeira lesson, it was especially cool to see professionals perform the dance and fight movements we had sorely attempted earlier in the day.\n\nTickets for the performance can be purchased directly from the box office the day-of. If seeing a performance by the Balé Folclórico is a priority, don’t wait to buy tickets since they can sell out. Tickets can also be reserved online.\n\nTickets cost R$80 (2024) and they have shows every Monday, Tuesday, and Friday at 7pm. The Miguel Santana Theater is very small and seating in amphitheater style with no assigned seats or seat backs. A line forms at the door before 7pm and seats are first come, first serve. The theater provides a performance program that explains in English the 4 different acts of the Balé Folclórico’s show so the audience can follow along.\n\nSeeing the performers in costume, hearing the live musical instruments and feeling the energy up close was an awesome experience to close out our time in Salvador."
