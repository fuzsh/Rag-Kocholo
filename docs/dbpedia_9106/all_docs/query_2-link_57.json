Yes, San Salvador has issues similar to other large urban cities in Latin America, but it is still a great city to call home. It has an excellent culture with plenty of activity options. It is also the country’s cultural, political, educational, and financial epicenter.\n\nWhere to Live in San Salvador, El Salvador’s capital city\n\nSome of the best areas to live in the capital city of El Salvador are Santa Elena, Colonia Escalon, San Benito, Colonia Maquilishuat, and Cumbres de Cuscatlan; these are just some of them, and there are plenty more!\n\nThe areas mentioned above are some of the most exclusive in the city; therefore, the cost of renting or buying there is high. But don’t worry about it. The capital city has plenty of less expensive options available.\n\nLook at the following website, “Salvadoran real estate,” and get an idea of what rentals go for in the city.\n\nIt is hard to take a position on where to live in San Salvador or the best places to live; there are just too many factors to consider.\n\nFor example, if you are moving alone, some factors might be, do you want to live in a trendy area or not. Do you have a car or plan to take public transportation? Are you on a budget? These are just some things that will impact your decision on where to live in San Salvador.\n\nIf you are moving with a family, things change as there are more factors to consider, such as a kid’s education, family safety, and family activities.\n\nThe choices of where to live in San Salvador are vast; each individual or family will have their criteria about what they are looking for.

A real estate agent will help narrow down the choices.\n\nIs it dangerous to live in the capital city of El Salvador?\n\nIt is not dangerous to live in El Salvador’s capital city; however, just like other big cities in Central America, it has areas considered unsafe. San Salvador had one of the highest crime rates in Latin America; however, that has changed in the last five years.\n\nSpeculating how dangerous the Capital city would be to you just by looking at crime statistics is a bad idea. The crime statistics will not give you a clear picture of safety. It does not consider things such as the location you will be living in and transportation.\n\nThe following three things could show you how dangerous the city will be to you, residence location, mode of transportation, and lifestyle.\n\nWhen it comes to safety, choosing the right community to live in is a big step in the right direction. Before choosing a location to move to, find out everything about the area.\n\nHow you are going to be moving around is the next step. If you plan to drive, making sure your house has a safe parking space will be your biggest worry.\n\nIf you plan to take public transportation, you will need to worry about the bus route and the areas it travels to before your final destination.\n\nLastly, your lifestyle has a big impact on safety; if you live a calm life and don’t take crazy chances, the city will not be as dangerous. On the other hand, if you do drugs and go out drinking often, you will put yourself in more challenging situations. I am in no way judging the lifestyle of anyone; it is just an honest observation.\n\nIf you analyze the three items listed above (living location, transportation, and lifestyle), follow safety recommendations, and use common sense, the capital city of El Salvador will not be dangerous to you.\n\nHow Expensive is it to Live in San Salvador?\n\nThe city of San Salvador is the most expensive urban area in the country.
