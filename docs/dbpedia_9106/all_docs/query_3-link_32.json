It was inaugurated in 1960 by President Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira and took only 41 months to construct. It is regarded as one of the most visually striking cities in the world on account of its Le Corbusier-inspired architecture by the renowned modernist Oscar Niemeyer and was planned by Lúcio Costa. It is a World Heritage Site.\n\nBrazil’s capital was relocated to the Federal District in 1960, this being carved out of the state of Goiás in central Brazil. The Distrito Federal (designated as DF among the states’ initials) is the site of the nation’s legislature, chief courts and ministerial headquarters. Constisting of 26 states, the Brazilian constitution is heavily modelled on that of the United States. The previous capital was Rio de Janeiro, which remains the country’s best known city. It was designated the federal capital during the creation of the republic in 1889. However, following the relocation of the legislature, judiciary and civil service to Brasília, the former capital was designated as Guanabara state. In 1975 however, Guanabara merged with Rio de Janeiro to form one state.\n\nOn becoming president in 1956, Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira ordered the construction of the new distrito federal in the state of Goiás in order to have the branches of government located in one neutral territory. Rivalry between the cities of Sao Paulo and Rio De Janeiro was, and remains, strong. Another equally plausible theory is that the military regime wanted to relocate the capital to the less populous interior so as to remove it from any possible uprising in the industrial south east. The military regime remained in place for several more decades until the phased introduction of direct civilian rule in the 1980s.\n\nThe city itself is a planned entity from its beginnings and was designed to house up to one million inhabitants, though it has exceded this. Lúcio Costa’s blueprint for the city was meticulous in its zoning, dividing the city into metric plots of streets designated by number rather than name, a practice in vogue in other planned cities elsewhere in the world. The plan also stipulated building height and where blocks of flats can be located. Because of this and the provision of green space, the city is regarded as one of the best places to raise children. The centrally planned area is surrounded by satellite cities, two of which exceed the population of the planned city (‘Plano Piloto’), and more in the state of Goiás itself, leading to a conurbation of 2.2m. However, the lack of pedestrian transport in the original plan has led to some revisions and the building of the Brasília Metro, which opened in 2001. The city’s rail link to Sao Paulo was downgraded to a goods line, leaving travellers dependent on air or bus travel. The city is served by the Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport, which is reached by flights from Rio De Janeiro and Sao Paulo, as well as other regional airports.\n\nAnother interesting facet of Brasília is the abundance of religious cults based there, said to be attracted by both Saint John Bosco’s prophecy of abundant riches* and the free land donated to legally constituted religious bodies. It is also said the futuristic architecture of the avowedly atheist Marxist Oscar Niemeyer has attracted them to the city, especially his Congress towers, between which the sun rises. Niemeyer’s sculpted modernist designs are regarded as some of the best examples of his profession. The government for the distrito federal is an autonomous unit within Brazil’s federative system, with a governor and assembly elected every four years.\n\nBrasília is one of the host cities of the 2014 Football World Cup and 2013 South American FIFA Confederations Cup. The rebuilding of Garrincha Stadium is ongoing. The brand-new stadium, which is being constructed in its place will be called National Stadium of Brasilia. Brasília will also host football tournaments during the 2016 Summer Olympics to be held in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n* “... and between the parallels 15º and 20º south, there was a large and wide stream that began from a point where a lake was formed. When the hidden mines are caved in the middle of these hills, a great civilization will show up, a promised land from where comes out milk and honey…”\n\n(Prophecy of Saint John Bosco, 1883)\n\nFollow @City_Mayors"
