        "text": "Salvador is the capital city of the Brazilian state of Bahia, formally and originally known as Cidade de SÃ£o Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos.This city is characterised by its friendly, warm atmosphere, its welcoming locals and the ambience of fun and fancy.\n\nHowever, it is not only popular because of its laid-back setting. Rather, it is also one of the oldest established settlements in all of Brazil. This gives it an authentic charm and complexity that is not easily rivalled. Its culture and heritage is fascinating, drawing visitors in as they explore the city centre and the rolling hills."
