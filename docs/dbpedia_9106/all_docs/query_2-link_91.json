        "text": "Sharing is caring!\n\nIf you’re planning a backpacking trip through Central America, El Salvador is definitely worth considering. As one of the smallest countries in the region, it offers a diverse range of attractions and activities that are perfect for solo travelers. In this post, I am sharing how I did the border crossing from Honduras to El Salvador and where I stayed, ate, highlights, and more.\n\nMost people visit Santa Ana in El Salvador but I skipped it because as mentioned above, my goal for this trip was to see something unique in all 7 countries. So that meant Volcano in Santa Ana wasn’t of interest as it fell under the already seen/done bucket.\n\nSo what different things did I see in El Salvador? I’ll elaborate on that below.\n\nSan Salvador, the capital of El Salvador, is a must-visit destination. This bustling metropolis boasts a mix of modern and historic architecture, including the stunning Metropolitan Cathedral and the National Palace. If you’re a night owl, you’ll love the vibrant nightlife scene with plenty of bars, clubs, and restaurants to choose from.\n\nBut El Salvador isn’t just about city life. The Ruta de las Flores, or “Flower Route,” is a scenic drive through several charming towns known for their colorful flowers and unique artisanal crafts. And if you’re a thrill-seeker, El Salvador has plenty of outdoor activities to offer, from hiking, and riding a bike on a zip line, to surfing on the Pacific coast and more.\n\nHow to go from Copan Ruins, Honduras to San Salvador, El Salvador?\n\nThis is going to be another long day so start EARLY!\n\nHere is the step-by-step route I followed.\n\n1. Get on a bus to Santa Rosa de Copan (3.5 hours)\n\nIn Copan Ruins town, there are two bus terminals. One is in the town between all the shops and the second one is on the way to the Copan ruins itself – If you walk from town to the ruins you will come across a small bridge and right next to it on the right-hand side is the second bus stop.\n\nI did not buy a bus ticket day before because there was no one selling it! So I just decided to turn up early in the morning. The first bus leaves the bus stop at 4:20 am and the second bus leaves at 6 am ( i made it around 545 am – the hostel was nearby recommendation below and the bus left right on time at 6).\n\n2. Take another bus from Santa Rosa de Copan to Ocotepeque (2.5 hours)\n\nThe bus will take its sweet time, looking and waiting to pick up passengers in order to fill the seats and buying breakfast for the driver/conductor. I wasn’t sure what they were eating tho but a friendly Honduran man on the bus who spoke good English explained it to me. It was a delicious local breakfast that looked like a tortilla with stuffed meat or veggies inside which was actually tasty\n\nI suggest letting the driver and the conductor know beforehand you want to go Ocotepeque next because along the way the bus may pass other buses heading in that direction. So they just stop and take your bag and move you right then and there!\n\nThat is how it happened for me although it was only 5 minutes before arriving in Santa Rosa! So in any case, get to Santa Rosa and on this small bus stop area you should be able to find a bus that goes to Ocotepeque.\n\n3. Taxi drive to the border (7 minutes)\n\nOnce you arrive in a town called Ocotepeque, you can either get another microvan heading to Frontera (border) or get a taxi to drop you off at the border.\n\n4. Immigrations: Stamp out/ Stamp In (40 minutes)\n\nAt the border, continue walking to the immigration office. Stamp out of Honduras Then walk straight to the San Salvador immigration office You can’t miss it, it is just straight ahead.\n\nThere are some people exchanging USD/ Lempheras for the local currency, recommend changing some to use for bus or food, maybe snacks. The man gave me a good rate tbh\n\n5. Walk to the Terminal de buses 119: (10 minutes)\n\nOnce you entered El Salvador, you gotta keep walking straight again to get to the bus stop. There are some restaurants and shops along the way. I stopped at once to buy water and snacks for the bus ride and was pleasantly surprised to bump into a local El Salvadorian who spoke perfect American English.\n\nWalk straight about 10 mins from the immigration office until you see the bus terminal on your right-hand side.\n\n6. Take Chicken Bus #119 to San Salvador: (3 hours)\n\nEl Salvador was my 4th Central American country and I was finally about to experience the Chicken bus ride everyone talked about!\n\nI must mention it was one of the fun bus rides because of a few things. Firstly, both the driver and the conductor were super nice and polite even when they had 0 English and I had no Spanish. Just looking at them you could tell they absolutely LOVED their job.\n\nSecondly, this chicken bus had a massive TV at the front and throughout the bus journey, they kept playing Daddy Yankee music videos on repeat! So i guess I got familiar with their taste in music now\n\n7. Arrive at a gas station called Gasolinera Puma near Terminal de Oriente bus station\n\nFinally arrived in San Salvador, remember Uber works here so I checked how much was to my hostel and it was $6 but there are also many taxis around. I was at my hostel in 20 minutes due to peak office hours traffic around 5:30 pm.\n\nCost of this independent border crossing:\n\nHere are quick notes from the day\n\nFrom Copan Ruins the bus left exactly at 6:40 am\n\nArrived at 9:40 am in Santa Rosa\n\n110 lemp\n\n3 hrs\n\nLeft Santa Rosa at 950 am\n\nArrived at Ocotepeque at 12:50 pm\n\n150 lemp\n\nI gave the bus conductor 500 lemp but had to remind him more than halfway for the change back. Suggest carrying smaller notes for ease.\n\n3 hrs\n\nA shared Taxi to the border with locals left at 1 pm\n\nArrived at Honduras immigration at 1: 20 pm\n\n12 lemp\n\nStamp out Honduras immigration\n\nAsked where I’m going next and where I was before\n\nMentioned that I had too many stamps on my passport!\n\nWalked to the San Salvador immigration\n\nGuard checked passport, stamped in and stamped out of Honduras\n\nAt the El Salvador immigration, the officer flicked through all the pages of my passport and checked the stamps again\n\nThis time questions were – where was I staying, where was I going, and which country I land first form Australia\n\nSnacks $1.35\n\n2 pm arrived At the bus stop chicken bus guy washing the tires\n\nLeft 2:15 pm $5 waiting for change still\n\nGot back $2.80\n\nFinally arrived in San Salvador at 5:30 PM\n\nTAXI to the hostel at 5: 37 pm\n\nArrived at the hostel in 5 mins\n\nAlso checked Uber’s price was $6.10\n\nTaxi wanted $8 but in the end, agreed to go from $6\n\nHow long did it take me to get from Honduras to El Salvador?\n\nTotal: 12 hours\n\nThese steps may look pretty complicated but don’t be put off by the fact that you need to take 3 different buses and 1 taxi to get to San Salvador. It’s not as bad as it looks, I speak barely any words in Spanish and did fine so you can too!\n\nAlternatively, you can pay for a shuttle door-to-door service for about 90 USD.\n\nIs El Salvador safe for solo travelers?\n\nEl Salvador has a reputation for being a dangerous country, and there are certain safety concerns that solo travelers should be aware of. However, with appropriate precautions, it is possible to have a safe and enjoyable trip to El Salvador.\n\nHere are some tips for staying safe in El Salvador as a solo traveler:\n\nStick to well-known tourist areas and avoid traveling alone at night.\n\nAvoid carrying large amounts of cash or wearing expensive jewelry or watches.\n\nUse caution when using public transportation. Stick to licensed taxis or Uber.\n\nKeep your passport and important documents in a secure location, such as a hotel/hostel safe/locker.\n\nStay aware of your surroundings and trust your instincts. If a situation feels unsafe, remove yourself from it as quickly and calmly as possible.\n\nLearn some basic Spanish phrases before your trip, as English is not widely spoken outside of tourist areas.\n\nConsider staying in a hostel or guesthouse with good reviews and a social atmosphere, where you can meet other travelers and possibly join group activities. (recommendation below)\n\nOverall, while there are safety concerns in El Salvador, solo travelers can have a safe and rewarding trip with careful planning and a heightened awareness of their surroundings.\n\nWhich hostels to stay in El Salvador?\n\nHere are some highly-rated hostels in San Salvador, the capital city of El Salvador:\n\nHostal Cumbres del Volcan Flor Blanca – The hostel offers comfortable dorms and private rooms, a rooftop terrace, and a communal kitchen.\n\nHostal Cumbres del Volcán Escalón – This hostel offers accommodation with a garden, free private parking, a shared lounge, and a terrace.\n\nLa Zona Hostel – This hostel is located in the trendy Zona Rosa neighborhood and offers private rooms and dorms, a swimming pool, and a communal kitchen.
