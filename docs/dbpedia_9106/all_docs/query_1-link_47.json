        "text": "Advertising by Google\n\nSalvador, Bahia\n\nArea: 313 km²\n\nPopulation: 2.443.107 in Salvador, nearly 3.300.000 in the metropolitan area. Salvador is the third most populated city in Brazil, after São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.\n\nSee map of Bahia.\n\nSee also weather in Salvador.\n\nThe name Salvador means \"Savior\". The full name of the city is São Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos, or \"Saint Savior of the Bay of All Saints\"; Bahia de Todos os Santos was the name given by Portuguese explorers in 1501, when they arrived at this natural anchorage, with blue water guarded from wings and flow. The name Bahia (= Bay) would become the name of the State).\n\nMuch more than just the capital of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil, is synonymous with a state of mind. It is the Brazilian city which most evokes relaxation, spontaneity, feasts and religiousness. African culture and ethnical heritage are more significant in Salvador than in other capitals on Brazil, and involves the city in an atmosphere of joy and enchantment. Baianos are proud to be black in their music and dancing, in their rituals and parties, in their dressings, in their food, beliefs and religiosity.\n\nSalvador is the main port of entry of foreign tourist to North-East Brazil. Tourists are immediately captivated by its charm, by its infrastructure of hotels and the combination of city and architecture, which finds its greatest expression at the Pelourinho (pelourinho is the name of the wooden mast where slaves were punished; there used to be hundreds of pelourinhos across the country, but only a few remain; another touristic pelourinho is found in the city of Alcantara, state of Maranhão).\n\nThe Pelô, as the pelourinho of Salvador is affectionately called by the Bahians, is located in the Historical Center of Salvador; this area was declared World Heritage site by Unesco, and is the greatest collection of colonial architecture in Latin America.\n\nSons of Gandhi"
