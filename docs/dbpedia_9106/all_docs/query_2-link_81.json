        "text": "In 1821, El Salvador and the other Central American provinces declared their independence from Spain. When these provinces were joined with Mexico in early 1822, El Salvador resisted, insisting on autonomy for the Central American countries. In 1823, the United Provinces of Central America was formed of the five Central American states under Gen. Manuel Jose Arce. El Salvador became an independent republic when this federation was dissolved in 1838.\n\nEl Salvador's early history as an independent state was marked by frequent revolutions. Following a deterioration in the country's democratic institutions in the 1970s, a period of civil war followed from 1980-1992. More than 75,000 people are estimated to have died in the conflict. In January 1992, after prolonged negotiations, the opposing sides signed peace accords that ended the war, brought the military under civilian control and allowed the former guerrillas to form a legitimate political party and participate in elections.\n\nDuring the 12-year civil war, human rights violations by both the government security forces and left-wing guerrillas were rampant. The accords established a Truth Commission under United Nations auspices to investigate the most serious cases. The commission reported its findings in 1993. It recommended that those identified as human rights violators be removed from all government and military posts and recommended judicial reforms. Thereafter, the Legislative Assembly granted amnesty for political crimes committed during the war.\n\nSource: The World Factbook, 2014.\n\nArt\n\nThe village of La Palma has become famous for a school of art started by Fernando Llort. His childlike images of mountain villages, rural life and Christ are painted in bright colors on objects ranging from seeds to church walls.\n\nThe town of Ilobasco is known for its ceramics, while San Sebastián is recognized for its textile arts.\n\nPoetry is popular, and well-known writers include Manlio Argueta and Francisco Rodriguez.\n\nMusic\n\nSalvadorans enjoy the rhythms of the Caribbean. Guitars, marimbas and drums are used in church services. Most of the music on Salvadoran radio is standard pop fare from the United States, Mexico or other parts of Latin America, but there's a small underground movement of canción (folk music) that draws its inspiration from current events in El Salvador.\n\nLanguage\n\nSpanish: Hola (Hello), ¿Cómo está? (How are you?), Bien (Fine), ¿Que ondas? (How is it going?), Tranquilo (Fine), Salu (Goodbye), ¡Puchica! (Gee! Good! Yeah!)\n\nSports & Games\n\nSalvadorans love to play soccer, which is the main sport. Basketball, baseball, tennis and swimming are other favorites.\n\nTypical Foods\n\nCorn and black beans are the daily diet of most families. Families also like to snack on pupusas (corn cakes filled with chopped meats, beans and spices).\n\nThe typical school year runs from January through November. Education is compulsory from ages 7 through 12. Schools in rural areas are inadequate in number, size and qualified staff.\n\nEl Salvador has initiated major reforms of the secondary education system, which are designed to both substantially increase access and improve the quality of education offered while ensuring its relevance to a changing, technologically driven economy. However, a large number of children cannot attend secondary school because they need to work to help support their families. Their jobs include working on sugar and coffee plantations, in domestic services, and as street vendors. This reality is even more critical in the rural areas where the poverty level can be higher than 50 percent. In these areas, it is common to see children begin to work at 6 or 7 years old.\n\nThe education situation past secondary school is even less promising. According to El Salvador's government statistics, the population with a university-level degree remains in the single digits. In El Salvador, a person who does not have a professional career cannot expect a good salary; even people with degrees may be hired for manual jobs that pay a minimal salary (U.S.$185 in the city and U.S. $90 in rural areas). People who have no secondary education must work for less than the established minimum.\n\nThe constitution provides for freedom of religion and states that all persons are equal before the law and prohibits discrimination based on nationality, race, sex or religion.\n\nThe constitution explicitly recognizes the Roman Catholic Church and grants it legal status.\n\nPublic education is secular. Private religious schools operate freely in the country. All private schools, whether religious or secular, must meet the same standards to be approved by the Ministry of Education.\n\nSource: International Religious Freedom Report, released in 2012 by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.\n\nHoly Week: March or April: Celebrated before Easter. Salvadorans hold processions during this week. On Easter weekend, most people celebrate by going to church and to the beach.\n\nSan Salvador Feast (Feast of the Holy Savior): Aug. 3-6 — Celebrated with a carnival, fireworks, dancing and parades.\n\nIndependence Day: Sept. 15\n\nChristmas Eve and Christmas Day: Dec. 24 and 25 — Homes are decorated with elaborate nativity scenes that can fill a whole room, Christmas trees are decorated and children receive presents on Christmas Eve.\n\nVisit the Compassion blog to read posts about Easter in El Salvador and Christmas celebrations in El Salvador."
