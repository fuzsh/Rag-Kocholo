        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nEl Salvador achieved independence from Spain in 1821 and from the Central American Federation in 1839. A 12-year civil war, which cost about 75,000 lives, was brought to a close in 1992 when the government and leftist rebels signed a treaty that provided for military and political reforms. El Salvador is beset by one of the world's highest homicide rates and pervasive criminal gangs.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nCentral America, bordering the North Pacific Ocean, between Guatemala and Honduras\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n13 50 N, 88 55 W\n\nMap references\n\nCentral America and the Caribbean\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 21,041 sq km\n\nland: 20,721 sq km\n\nwater: 320 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 154\n\nArea - comparative\n\nabout the same size as New Jersey\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 590 km\n\nborder countries (2): Guatemala 199 km, Honduras 391 km\n\nCoastline\n\n307 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 200nm\n\ncontiguous zone: 24nm\n\nClimate\n\ntropical; rainy season (May to October); dry season (November to April); tropical on coast; temperate in uplands\n\nTerrain\n\nmostly mountains with narrow coastal belt and central plateau\n\nElevation\n\nmean elevation: 442 m\n\nlowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 m\n\nhighest point: Cerro El Pital 2,730 m\n\nNatural resources\n\nhydropower, geothermal power, petroleum, arable land\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 74.7% (2011 est.)\n\narable land: 33.1% (2011 est.)/permanent crops: 10.9% (2011 est.)/permanent pasture: 30.7% (2011 est.)\n\nforest: 13.6% (2011 est.)\n\nother: 11.7% (2011 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n452 sq km (2012)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nathough it is the smallest country in land area in Central America, El Salvador has a population that is 18 times larger than Belize; at least 20% of the population lives abroad; high population density country-wide, with particular concentration around the capital of San Salvador\n\nNatural hazards\n\nknown as the Land of Volcanoes; frequent and sometimes destructive earthquakes and volcanic activity; extremely susceptible to hurricanes volcanism: significant volcanic activity; San Salvador (1,893 m), which last erupted in 1917, has the potential to cause major harm to the country's capital, which lies just below the volcano's slopes; San Miguel (2,130 m), which last erupted in 2002, is one of the most active volcanoes in the country; other historically active volcanoes include Conchaguita, Ilopango, Izalco, and Santa Ana\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\ndeforestation; soil erosion; water pollution; contamination of soils from disposal of toxic wastes\n\nEnvironment - international agreements\n\nparty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands\n\nsigned, but not ratified: Law of the Sea\n\nGeography - note\n\nsmallest Central American country and only one without a coastline on the Caribbean Sea\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n6,187,271 (July 2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 109\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Salvadoran(s)\n\nadjective: Salvadoran\n\nEthnic groups\n\nmestizo 86.3%, white 12.7%, Amerindian 0.2% (includes Lenca, Kakawira, Nahua-Pipil), black 0.1%, other 0.6% (2007 est.)\n\nLanguages\n\nSpanish (official), Nawat (among some Amerindians)\n\nReligions\n\nRoman Catholic 50%, Protestant 36%, other 2%, none 12% (2014 est.)\n\nDemographic profile\n\nEl Salvador is the smallest and most densely populated country in Central America. It is well into its demographic transition, experiencing slower population growth, a decline in its number of youths, and the gradual aging of its population. The increased use of family planning has substantially lowered El Salvador's fertility rate, from approximately 6 children per woman in the 1970s to replacement level today. A 2008 national family planning survey showed that female sterilization remained the most common contraception method in El Salvador - its sterilization rate is among the highest in Latin America and the Caribbean - but that the use of injectable contraceptives is growing. Fertility differences between rich and poor and urban and rural women are narrowing.Salvadorans fled during the 1979 to 1992 civil war mainly to the United States but also to Canada and to neighboring Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. Emigration to the United States increased again in the 1990s and 2000s as a result of deteriorating economic conditions, natural disasters (Hurricane Mitch in 1998 and earthquakes in 2001), and family reunification. At least 20% of El Salvador's population lives abroad. The remittances they send home account for close to 20% of GDP, are the second largest source of external income after exports, and have helped reduce poverty.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 25.3%(male 802,813 /female 762,852)\n\n15-24 years: 19.88%(male 619,550 /female 610,725)\n\n25-54 years: 39.8%(male 1,143,226 /female 1,319,138)\n\n55-64 years: 7.32%(male 198,513 /female 254,640)\n\n65 years and over: 7.69%(male 208,817 /female 266,997) (2018 est.)\n\npopulation pyramid:\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 56.8 (2015 est.)\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 44.4 (2015 est.)\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 12.4 (2015 est.)\n\npotential support ratio: 8 (2015 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 27.6 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 26.1 years\n\nfemale: 29.1 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 143\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n0.25% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 177\n\nBirth rate\n\n16.1 births/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 111\n\nDeath rate\n\n5.8 deaths/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 173\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-7.8 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 210\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nathough it is the smallest country in land area in Central America, El Salvador has a population that is 18 times larger than Belize;

With the global recession, real GDP contracted in 2009 and economic growth has since remained low, averaging less than 2% from 2010 to 2014, but recovered somewhat in 2015-17 with an average annual growth rate of 2.4%. Remittances accounted for approximately 18% of GDP in 2017 and were received by about a third of all households.In 2006, El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement, which has bolstered the export of processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the apparel sector amid increased Asian competition. In September 2015, El Salvador kicked off a five-year $277 million second compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation - a US Government agency aimed at stimulating economic growth and reducing poverty - to improve El Salvador's competitiveness and productivity in international markets.The Salvadoran Government maintained fiscal discipline during reconstruction and rebuilding following earthquakes in 2001 and hurricanes in 1998 and 2005, but El Salvador's public debt, estimated at 59.3% of GDP in 2017, has been growing over the last several years.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$51.17 billion (2017 est.)\n\n$50.01 billion (2016 est.)\n\n$48.75 billion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 109\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$24.81 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n2.3% (2017 est.)\n\n2.6% (2016 est.)\n\n2.4% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 140\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$8,000 (2017 est.)\n\n$7,900 (2016 est.)\n\n$7,700 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 152\n\nGross national saving\n\n14.9% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n13% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\n12.4% of GDP (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 137\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 84.5% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 15.8% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 16.9% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: 0% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 27.6% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -44.9% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 12% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 27.7% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 60.3% (2017 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\ncoffee, sugar, corn, rice, beans, oilseed, cotton, sorghum;
