        "text": "Everything you have to know to plan your trip to Salvador, Bahia: How to get there, what to do, touristic points schedule and even how to practice sustainable tourism in the city.\n\nDid you know that besides being Bahia’s capital, Salvador was the first Brazilian capital as well? In this complete guide, you will find even more curiosities, tips about what to do in Salvador, touristic points information, museums and churches of the city.\n\nTraveling to Salvador is an opportunity to learn about the history of Brazil. Understand the strength of these people, getting to know more about their religion, gastronomy, and musical resistance brought by the African people who were enslaved, or even learning about the story of Sister Dulce (Irmã Dulce), a saint that never give up on the poor and sick people, even in the most challenging moments.\n\nI never thought that I’d love that city so much. We were there for about 1 month and it was not enough to know everything. That’s why I recommend staying there for at least a week, so you can get to know this charming and welcoming place well.\n\nTo some people, a trip to Salvador it’s an opportunity to have some fun in Carnaval or take a colorful photo in Largo do Pelourinho. But, I invite you to make this a transforming and learning journey.\n\nWhere is Salvador\n\nSalvador is a Brazilian city in the northeast of the country, in Bahia state. This coastal city is just over 400 miles from Porto Seguro and almost 1.300 miles from São Paulo and more than 990 miles from Rio de Janeiro.\n\nSee where is Salvador on the map:\n\nWhen to go to Salvador, Bahia\n\nYou can visit Salvador any time of the year, considering that the average temperature in the city varies between 75ºF and 80°F (or 24°C and 27°C as celcius is the unit of temperature we use in Brazil) and water is always warm. But, if you wanna escape from the rainy season it’s better to avoid traveling between April and July.\n\nWe were in Salvador between October and November 2021, it was the low season and it was perfect. At this time of the year and in the summer, it’s common that it rains a little, and then, just a few minutes later, the sky clears up as if not a single drop had fallen.\n\nIf you travel between December and March be aware that you’ll find high season prices. Do you wanna see and enjoy Carnaval in Salvador? Don’t forget to book your lodging in advance, once knowing this is the busiest season.\n\nWeather in Salvador\n\nThis pic shows how is the weather in Salvador during the year:\n\nHow to get to Salvador and know the city\n\nYou can arrive in Salvador by plane, bus or car. If you are arriving from other cities of Bahia, even from other states as Sergipe or Alagoas, you can get the last two options. Otherwise, the best option is to take a flight to the Salvador Bahia Airport – Dep. Luís Eduardo Magalhães.\n\nThe Salvador bus terminal is located on Antônio Carlos Magalhães avenue, number 4.362 in the Pituba neighborhood, and it has a nearby subway station, the Bus Station.\n\nThe subway works very well, but unfortunately, it doesn’t pass through the principal touristic points. Even so, it is a good alternative for those who stay in a central region or for those who want to save money by taking a subway from the airport or bus station to the station closest to their accommodation and then a city bus or Uber.\n\nSalvador also has local buses. On this site, you can put your origin and destination and identify which line you should take and the bus schedule. The line that should help you the most is the one that goes from the airport to Praça da Sé. If you are looking for a more comfortable way to move in the city, you can choose to take a táxi or Uber. On my trip, the best transportation was Uber because of the cost x benefit.\n\nLMTM tip: Will you take Uber or Taxi via the app? Like anyplace else, don’t forget to check the vehicle, the license plate, and the driver’s name before entering.\n\nFor those who love physical activity, the waterfront has several Itaú bicycle rental/return points.\n\nGeneral information\n\nFrequently doubts about Salvador:\n\nWhat to do in Salvador\n\nThere is much more that you can do in Salvador than you can imagine!

The 21-meter tower has this name because it is located on Praia de Itapuã.\n\nImportant! The inner area of the Farol de Itapuã is not open to visitors.\n\nLMTM tip: This isn’t the most beautiful beach in Salvador (in my opinion), because of that, my advice is for you to make a quick visit here.\n\nAddress: Farol de Itapuã street – Itapuã\n\nPonta do Humaitá\n\nOn this charming spot you can find an architectural conglomeration, including the Church and Monastery of Monte Serrat and the Farol of Monte Serrat. Here one can enjoy a beautiful sunset and try the Bahian cuisine.\n\nAddress: 56, Boa Viagem street – Monte Serrat\n\n2) Relax on the edge of Salvador Beaches\n\nIf you are in doubt about what to do in Salvador on a sunny day, don’t worry. The beaches in the Bahian capital provide a variety of activities.\n\nGo diving or stand-up paddling at Porto da Barra beach, learn how to surf at Praia do Flamengo, relax and have a good drink at the Blue Praia Bar at Buracão beach, eat a “coalho” cheese with molasses at Praia da Barra or ride a bike along the shore.\n\nCheck our article about the best beaches in Salvador, Brazil!\n\nLMTM tip: Before getting into the water, check the water quality. You can confirm this information on INEMA website or through an updated Google search.\n\n3) Strengthen your faith\n\nIt can be in some of the 372 catholic churches or in some terreiro, a space dedicated to the candomblé’s orixás, the faith is part of the Bahian culture. See where you can strengthen your faith in Salvador:\n\nIgreja do Senhor do Bonfim\n\nMaybe you already know the ribbon of Bonfim, it is an icon in the Bahian city, but do you know where they come from?

In moderation, of course. 😅.\n\nTraditional food\n\nThe Bahian food is delicious and unique. Taste acarajé, abará, moqueca, cocada, bolinho de estudante, pão delícia, caruru, mugunzá, and some others Bahia’s traditional food.\n\nIce Cream\n\nIt is really common to find Sorveteria da Ribeira in ‘what to do tips’ in Salvador. We were in four ice cream shops in the city, see our ranking:\n\nCrema – located in Largo de Santana, Rio Vermelho. Taste the flavours “Amarena” and “Ferrero Rocher”.\n\nLe Glacier La Porte – Largo do Cruzeiro de São Francisco\n\nSorveteria da Ribeira – it’s only worth in the Ribeira’s unit, in the other ones the quality isn’t that good. Taste the flavor “Delícia de Abacaxi”.\n\nA Cubana – Multiple units all over Salvador.\n\n5) Enjoy the sunset\n\nWill not be a problem for you to find beautiful places to appreciate the sunset in Salvador.\n\nIn the highest touristic points as Elevador Lacerda, on the beach or at Farol da Barra, on the balcony of one of the bars of Santo Antônio Além do Carmo, listening to good jazz (Saturdays) or practicing a yoga class for free (Sundays) in the back of MAM (Modern Art Museum), and, who knows, in not much known places as Mirante Wildberger or Larri Bistrô in the Aliança Francesa at Corredor da Vitória.\n\n6) Visit museums in Salvador\n\nJorge Amado, one of the biggest Brazilian writers, was born in the South of Bahia and finished his studies in Salvador.

Since it is centrally located, there is a lot of traffic between 6-7:30 pm.\n\nPraia de Itapuã: This was the beach where I saw the most garbage in Salvador. Several locals also told me about the lack of security there, which made me apprehensive while I was staying there.
