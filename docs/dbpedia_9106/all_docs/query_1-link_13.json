        "text": "Salvador da Bahia\n\nFounded in 1549, Salvador da Bahia was Brazil’s first capital.\n\nIts early prominence was fueled by trade in cane sugar and slaves—brought by the millions from Senegal, Nigeria, Angola, and Congo.\n\nTheir labors built a city of Baroque churches, pastel-hued mansions, cobbled streets, and coastal defenses.\n\nSalvador’s historic center, the Pelourinho (Whipping Post), was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985.\n\nPelourinho\n\nAfter decades of renovation, the Pelourinho now includes over 800 restored houses, churches, and convents.\n\nArriving in the Pelourinho at dusk, you’d be forgiven for mistaking the city for a movie set.\n\nThis destination is magical.\n\nSalvador remains the capital of Afro-Brazilian culture—over 80% of its residents claim African ancestry.\n\nThe local cuisine, music, and dance are infused with rich African elements.\n\nCapoeira, a blend of dance and martial arts set to music, is a well-known example.\n\nMuseu Afro-Brasileiro\n\nOther forms are displayed at the Museu Afro-Brasileiro, which features fantastic carvings of Candomble deities and ritual objects.\n\nThe Carnival museum is a compact joy, filled with playful costumes and interactive exhibits.\n\nThe city is flanked by 31 miles of beach, facing either the Atlantic or All Saints Bay. Porto da Barra, at the mouth of the bay, was named among the world’s ten best beaches by the UK’s Guardian newspaper.\n\nNorth and South of the city, the coastal highway connects dozens of beach towns.\n\nMorro de Sao Paulo, Espelho, and Boipeba\n\nSome, such as Morro de Sao Paulo, draw vacationers from around the globe. Others, like Espelho and Boipeba, are better-kept secrets.\n\nMarch is the warmest month in Salvador, with temperatures reaching into the 90s.\n\nSea breezes moderate the heat and humidity year-round.\n\nAlthough this is one of the sunniest regions of Brazil, rains are common from May to October.\n\nGetting to Salvador\n\nDeputado Luis Eduardo Magalhaes International Airport lies 12 miles north of Salvador. In addition to a long list of domestic flights, non-stop flights to Miami (eight hours) are available.\n\nVacations to Salvador can also be combined with extensions to Fernando de Noronha, Ilheus, or Trancoso."
