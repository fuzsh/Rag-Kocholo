        "text": "In a country of about six million people, almost half live below the poverty line. According to a NUA survey in April of 2000, only about 40,000 Salvadorans were online, a scant .65% of the total population. Not even some of the richest one percent of the population can say they are online. Many of the people that are online are a part of the higher educational system, with a great number of people getting connected at the university level. This is typical of many countries, but El Salvador is slowly entering global society.\n\nTelecommunication Infrastructure"
