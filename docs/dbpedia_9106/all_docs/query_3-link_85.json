        "text": "Many foreigners have the idea that Rio de Janeiro or S√£o Paulo is the capital of Brazil. However, that is not true. The capital city of Brazil is Bras√≠lia, located in the Centre-West region of the country. It is a planned city established in 1960 and the third-largest city in Brazil.\n\nWith a population of over 3 million people, Bras√≠lia houses 133 embassies, the National Congress, the Supreme Federal Court, the presidential office and residence, and many other governmental buildings. The city is also divided into numbered blocks as well as sectors for specified activities, such as the Hotel Sector, the Banking Sector, and the Embassy Sector.\n\nHistory\n\nRio de Janeiro served as the capital of Brazil until 1960. However, the government felt that having a capital city on the coast was not a very good idea. Firstly because a coastal capital left the country vulnerable to foreign attacks from the sea. Secondly, there was the need to bring the capital closer to other interior areas of the country, which were far away from the coast.\n\nFurther reading: 11+ Interesting Facts About Brazil.\n\nFurthermore, Rio had also grown far too crowded for a capital. Meanwhile, only a few thousand people occupied the central region of Brazil. Moving the capital to a central region would mean encouraging the occupation of other territories in the central highlands.\n\nIn the 1955 Presidential Election, people elected Juscelino Kubitschek on a platform based on rapid economic development, driven by his slogan ‚Äòfifty years in five‚Äô. His Plan of Goals was the highlight of his campaign. He aimed to open up and modernize the Brazilian economy and finally move the capital.\n\nWatch teacher Deise‚Äôs video on the electoral system in Brazil here.\n\nBackground\n\nThe new capital of Brazil would be located in a special federal district, carved out from the state of Goi√°s in Brazil‚Äôs Centre-West region. This area was located in the highlands of Brazil, within Cerrado ‚Äî a savanna-like biome. It had been essentially an agricultural dead zone, mostly limited to beef production.\n\nRead more about the main biomes in Brazil in our blog post: Biodiversity in Brazil: a Megadiverse Country.\n\nMoving the country‚Äôs capital to the Cerrado attracted many to the region, with the surrounding state of Goi√°s alone growing nearly three times from 1950 to 1980.\n\nConstruction\n\nBras√≠lia was a planned capital city created virtually from scratch.\n\nWith an ideal place already selected, a public contest was held in 1956. Various Brazilian architects and city planners designed ideas of what the city would look like. The jury eventually selected L√∫cio de Costa‚Äôs plan for the city. The plan showed the main avenues forming an irregular cross shape resembling that of an airplane. Moreover, the residential area would be located along the wings and the commercial and governmental buildings along the body. Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer was responsible for designing most of the buildings in Bras√≠lia. Furthermore, Roberto Burle Marx was in charge of landscaping.\n\nThe construction of the new capital, however, had mixed reactions. Supporters praised the construction of Bras√≠lia as a symbol of Brazil‚Äôs coming of age. On the other hand, critics saw the construction as political maneuvering, which would not solve issues such as poverty and corruption.\n\nNonetheless, the first part of the construction of the new capital of Brazil only took around four years. Bras√≠lia was officially established as the new capital of Brazil on April 21, 1960.\n\nBras√≠lia: The Capital City of Brazil\n\nToday, the Federal District that houses Bras√≠lia is the third-largest metro area in Brazil, with a population of 4.2 million. In 1987, UNESCO included Bras√≠lia on its World Heritage List because of its architectural work and distinctive urban plan.\n\nMoreover, Bras√≠lia houses all three branches of Brazil‚Äôs federal government: executive, legislative, and judiciary. Among the building located in Bras√≠lia are the Planalto Palace headquarters of the Brazilian presidency, the National Congress, and the higher courts of justice.\n\nThe world‚Äôs largest permanently hoisted flag is also located in Braz√≠lia. The Brazilian flag measures 286 square meters and is hoisted on a 100-meter mast.\n\nWhat to do in Bras√≠lia: The Capital City of Brazil\n\nIf you ever visit Bras√≠lia, the capital of Brazil, do not forget to visit these places:\n\nPra√ßa dos Tr√™s Poderes: The Three Powers Plaza. It is a plaza in which is located Pal√°cio do Planalto (the presidential office); the National Congress; and the Supreme Federal Court.\n\nPal√°cio Itamaraty: the headquarters of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nPal√°cio da Alvorada: the official residence of the President of Brazil.\n\nJuscelino Kubitschek bridge: a steel and concrete arch bridge across Lake Parano√°.\n\nLake Parano√°: a manmade lake with various entertainment activities around it, such as restaurants, shopping malls, gyms, nightclubs, clubs, and more.\n\nMetropolitan Cathedral of Bras√≠lia: a Roman Catholic cathedral serving as the seat of the Archdiocese of Bras√≠lia. Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer was responsible for designing it. People often consider the cathedral to be his masterpiece.\n\nBotanical Garden of Bras√≠lia: showcases plenty of the vegetation from Cerrado.\n\nBras√≠lia National Park: a park with an area of 423.83 square kilometers with Cerrado or savanna trees.\n\nCaminhos Language Centre is the largest and most exciting Portuguese school in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
