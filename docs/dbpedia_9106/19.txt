Salvador is the capital city of the state of Bahia, and was the Brazilian capital until 1763. It is one of the oldest European settlements in Brazil, which dates back to the early 16th century. For over three centuries, Salvador was the major port of Brazil.

The old city (Historic Center) is built on two levels, the lower on the waterfront and the upper on a cliff about 200 feet high.
