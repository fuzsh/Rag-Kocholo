        "text": "About\n\nBee Movie is a 2007 Dreamworks computer-animated comedy film about the adventures of Barry B. Benson, a disillusioned bee who leaves his hive and goes on a journey in search of a new career. Despite its moderate commercial success and mixed critical reception, the film gained a significant ironic fandom on YouTube and Tumblr.\n\nHistory\n\nProduced by Dreamworks Animation and featuring voice acting by American comedian Jerry Seinfeld and actress Renée Zellweger, the film centers around the protagonist Barry B. Benson, a talking bee who fights to reclaim sovereignty from humans. Bee Movie was released in theaters on November 2nd, 2007.\n\nReception\n\nUpon its release, the film grossed $126 million at the box office in the United States and a worldwide total of $287 million. While the film was regarded a moderate box office success worldwide, it was met with disappointing performance and lukewarm reception in the United States. As of 2016, Bee Movie is DreamWorks Animation's third lowest-grossing computer-animated film. The movie holds a rating of 51% (based on 169 reviews) on Rotten Tomatoes and 54% (based on 34 review) on Metacritic.\n\nOnline Presence\n\nOn May 14th, 2012, a page for Bee Movie was created on TV Tropes. On March 16th, 2013, Redditor bottledbeaches created the /r/beemovie subreddit. On July 22nd, 2016, BuzzFeed published an article titled \"For Everyone Who Still Can't Believe 'Bee Movie' is Real,\" which highlighted several Tumblr posts about the film. On July 29th, Seinfeld posted a tweet asking if there was any interest in a sequel to the film, which garnered more than 47,000 likes and 24,200 retweets in four months (shown below).\n\nThe following day, the tweet reached the front page of the /r/movies subreddit, where many mocked the idea of making Bee Movie 2. On August 19th, the internet humor site Dorkly released a listicle highlighting the \"12 Most WTF Tumblr Posts About Bee Movie.\" On November 28th, BuzzFeed published an article about various Bee Movie memes.\n\nRelated Memes\n\nBee Shrek Test in the House\n\nBee Shrek Test in the House is a parody fandom created from a hypothetical crossover involving the characters Shrek, Barry Bee Benson and Johnny Test and Cory Baxter from the show Cory in the House.\n\nBee Movie Script\n\nThe Bee Movie Script, also known by the introductory line “according to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly,” is a copypasta that consists entirely of the full-length screenplay of the 2007 computer animated family comedy film Bee Movie, which is typically used in spamming and shitposting on various social media sites, most notably on Tumblr.\n\nBeestiality\n\nBeestiality, sometimes also called Bee-stiality, is the shipping name for the particularly bizarre romance arc of the film. As Barry and Vanessa spend time together, Ken becomes inexplicably jealous of the bee, and eventually attempts to kill Barry, prompting his wife to break up with him. The absurdity of Vanessa leaving her husband of fifteen years for an insect has lead to the Barry/Vanessa ship gaining a popular ironic fandom on sites like Tumblr.\n\nBee Movie But\n\nBee Movie But is a series of video and audio remixes of the film based around a particular altered characteristic. On October 22nd, 2016, YouTuber wankerflaps uploaded a video titled \"Bee Movie But it Keeps Getting Faster,\" featuring the audio track from the film which is progressively sped up (shown below, left). Within one moth, the video gained over 902,000 views and 4,300 comments. On November 3rd, YouTuber Avoid at All Costs posted a remix of the Bee Movie trailer that slows down each time the word \"bee\" is uttered, The video has since been removed.\n\nOn November 4th, Redditor jacobkj314 posted a screenshot of wankerlflap's YouTube video captioned with a \"please disconnect the bluetooth speaker\" joke (shown below). In 25 days, the post received more than 2,800 votes (96% upvoted) on the /r/dankmemesf subreddit.\n\nOn November 17th, YouTuber Avoid at All Costs uploaded a remix titled \"The Entire Bee Movie but Every Time They Say Bee it Gets Faster,\" which accumulated more than 11 million views and 33,000 comments within two weeks. While the video has since been removed, it was reuploaded by YouTuber Sektea (shown below, left). On November 22nd, YouTuber That One Ghost Named Asdfghjkl posted a remix titled \"The Bee Movie But Without Bees\" (shown below, right). Over the next week, the video gained over 3.01 million views and 7,700 comments.

This isn't even a shitpost though it's just 'YA LIKE JAZZ.'\" (shown below, left) It has gained over 101,000 views as of January 12th, 2016.
