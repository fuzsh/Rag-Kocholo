        "text": "Scott Bressler\n\nBee Movie\n\nRating: 1.5/5\n\nDirected by: Steve Hickner, Simon J. Smith\n\nStarring: Jerry Seinfeld, Renee Zellwegger\n\nJerry Seinfeld grew tired of being that comedian who makes observational humor on television. So he went on hiatus and now finally returns as a bee that makes observational humor on a much larger screen.\n\nThat left all his fans and Michael Richards pondering why he unnecessarily ended the run of the most successful show ever. Why couldn’t he just hang out in the apartment with the gang and kvetch about what the deal is with bees?\n\nWell, this topic may not have merited another season, but it certainly should saturate a feature film, right? It’s Jerry Seinfeld.\n\n“Bee Movie,” written and produced by Seinfeld, follows bee Barry B. Benson, voiced by Seinfeld, after he completes college and realizes that his only career options revolve around honey production. Craving a more exciting life, Barry leaves the hive to enter daunting New York City, and shockingly doesn’t stop at a single diner or deli. Nevertheless, he strikes a friendship with human florist and bee-lover Vanessa, voiced by the least animated vocals in Hollywood (Renee Zelweger). Together they sue the humans for improper treatment of bees and the use of their honey. Eventually, in extremely anti-Seinfeld fashion, everyone learns a valuable lesson about togetherness or something along those lines.\n\nDreamworks would be lucky if “Bee Movie” draws comparisons to that other animated comedy about an annoying, disgusting pest released this year, Disney/Pixar’s masterwork “Ratatouille.” The most striking difference between the two films is that Remy the rat attempts to become part of the human world in order to rise from the seedy underground. Barry the bee attempts to impact the human world, but the world he leaves is eerily similar to it.\n\nThe bees have television (and Bee Larry King, aptly voiced by human Larry King), they drink coffee, they’re familiar with Vogue magazine and they have a flourishing infrastructure. But they are outsiders, so Seinfeld can still crack wise about commercialization and make quick jabs at pop culture, equipped with his new bee persona.\n\nThe jokes are hit or miss, ranging from clever, relevant quips about Tivo, to chuckle-inducing but ultimately lame double entendres about Sting (get it?), and a nest egg of Ray Liotta jokes Seinfeld has obviously been keeping to appeal to all those “Goodfellas” fans that have jumped on the Dreamworks bandwagon. Supposedly the “Casino” diehards all support Pixar.\n\nThe humor occasionally rings Seinfeldian with its wry intellectualism, but becomes so broad that it alienates the fans that have shown up just because his name is attached.\n\nNot broad enough, however, to successfully attract the crying child demographic. Therefore the film will probably have a stellar opening weekend due to its transcendent animation, the lure of the deified Seinfeld and the ad campaign so ubiquitous it might as well have stung our eyeballs. But its buzz should be squashed in subsequent weeks when audiences realize that the humor will all go either below or above their heads.\n\nWhile “Seinfeld” the show was highlighted by minor actors more famous for their characters’ names than their actual ones, “Bee Movie” certainly is not a showcase of Bee-list actors. (Sorry, if you don’t like bee puns, you will not enjoy this movie.)\n\nBesides Seinfeld and Zellweger, the resounding voices of Matthew Broderick, John Goodman, Chris Rock, Kathy Bates, Oprah and other mainstays of the business outshine their thinly drawn characters. In “Ratatouille” smaller bills carried the leads so that Brad Bird’s incisive screenplay became more relevant than the names on the marquee.\n\nThe most memorable character in “Bee Movie” is the melodramatic bee-hater Ken, wondrously caricatured by lesser-known Patrick Warburton. Some may remember Warburton as Puddy from “Seinfeld.” And those who do not remember “Seinfeld” may know Warburton as the voice of Joe from “Family Guy.”\n\nBut if you do not remember “Seinfeld” well, or have kids in grade school, you probably shouldn’t see this watered-down shtick.\n\nAnd even then I’d still “bee” wary."
