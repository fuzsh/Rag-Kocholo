        "text": "According to all known laws of the film industry, there is no way Bee Movie should still be a thing. And yet, as citizens of the Internet know, Bee Movie has continued to fly around the Web anyway—because the Internet, like bees, doesn’t care what humans (and film critics) think is impossible.\n\nAll joking aside: the resurgence of Bee Movie is totally bizarre. The original film, a punny animated comedy starring and co-written by Jerry Seinfeld, earned mixed reviews and moderate box-office success when it was released in 2007. Then Internet jokesters began making Tumblr memes based on the film. Those memes slowly seeped out to other pockets of the Internet—but it wasn’t until this year that the movie inexplicably became inescapable online. From Bernie Sanders to Kim Kardashian West to actual real-life bees, no one could escape dumb jokes about this relatively arcane movie. A YouTube video titled “The entire bee movie but every time they say bee it gets faster” has been viewed over 15 million times. Fifteen. Million.\n\nEven Seinfeld can’t ignore the movie’s second life as an Internet phenomenon. The comedian addressed the idea of a Bee Movie sequel at least twice this year, first during a Reddit A.M.A. in June. When asked whether he’d considered making a follow-up, Seinfeld responded with good humor and a bit of befuddlement:\n\nI considered it this spring for a solid six hours. There’s a fantastic energy now for some reason, on the internet particularly. Tumblr, people brought my attention to. I actually did consider it, but then I realized it would make Bee Movie 1 less iconic. But my kids want me to do it, a lot of people want me to do it. A lot of people that don’t know what animation is want me to do it. If you have any idea what animation is, you’d never do it.\n\nAnd at the end of July, the comedian rekindled the Bee Movie discussion himself on Twitter:\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nHis tweet has accrued around 48,000 likes, 25,000 re-tweets, and 4,400 replies. Among those replies, one cautiously excited message is particularly striking:\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe tweet came from @Seinfeld2000, the online persona of Jason Richards—which, he insists, is his real name, and not a mash-up of Jason Alexander and Michael Richards. For nearly four years now, Richards has been playing one of the Internet’s best and strangest jokes using this account. @Seinfeld2000 was initially a parody of @SeinfeldToday, a massively successful Twitter account that imagined premises for modern-day episodes of the hit sitcom. But Richards’s work gradually became more than a simple spoof. His tweets are intentionally misspelled, random, and often bewildering, filled with both absurd humor and unexpected pathos. And incidentally, they may also be the closest thing we’ll ever find to a “source” for the Bee Movie memes.\n\nAs the name implies, the account is technically meant to be Seinfeld-themed. But as Richards told Vanity Fair in a phone interview, it’s hard to sustain a high-volume Twitter page without eventually expanding beyond your original idea. So Richards started mining other Seinfeld-related works for material—including Bee Movie.\n\n“At the start, I would get a lot of comments like, ‘Who cares about Bee Movie? This is a Seinfeld account,’ “ Richards said. “Now it’s kind of a thread in this account, and the Bee Movie jokes get just as much or more of a positive reaction—re-tweets or whatever—than some of the Seinfeld stuff.”\n\nWhen asked whether he’ll take credit as the man who launched the meme, Richards admitted, “I sort of low-key believe it. But [in character on] the account, I’ll proclaim it loudly and proudly. I will take maybe undue credit in character for it.”\n\nIt’s true that Bee Movie jokes were already being made on Tumblr when Richards started tweeting about the film back in 2013. In fact, some users were already wondering by that point if the site’s Bee Movie “phase” was over. (Evidently, it was not.) But his tweets about the film have been relentless—and have continued as the meme has picked up steam on other Internet channels. As Richards himself put it in one tweet, “for the record i was tweting about the bee movie before it was cool and will continue to twete about it after it is no longer cool”\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAnd sometimes he implies that Jerry Seinfeld himself owns a lot of copies of his animated joint, which he gifts at every opportunity.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\n“From my perspective, Bee Movie is a little bit obscure,” Richards said. “It’s a little bit of an anomaly for Jerry Seinfeld. . . . And also, just the film is strange itself.”\n\nNo kidding. For the uninitiated, Bee Movie follows protagonist Barry B. Benson (Seinfeld) as he leaves his hive in order to explore the outside world. He ends up meeting a woman (voiced by Renée Zellweger) who helps him sue the human race for taking honey from bees—and who leaves her fiancé to be with Barry, who, yes, is still a bee. (Suing the human race, Richards noted, “feels like a very Seinfeld touch.”)\n\nSo, aside from the fact that the story itself is completely bonkers, what is it about this movie that’s allowed it to sustain its buzz for so long? Many have tried to figure it out, but the phenomenon denies simple explanation.\n\nRichards can think of several possibilities. First, there’s the “off-brand Pixar quality” of the film, which Richards said “kind of lends itself to memes.” (The Internet loves poking fun at anything that appears amusingly cut-rate.) As he pointed out, both Shrek and Minions—from Dreamworks and Universal, respectively—share that same quality, and both have proven to be very meme-able themselves.\n\nAnd then there’s the audience: the film came out in 2007, meaning most of the people who saw it as children are now at just the right age to make a meme explode. “As adults, they’re starting to see the flaws” of the film, he explained—”just the weirdness of it that you wouldn’t watch [with] a critical eye as a child.” They’re also old enough to know that bees are dying globally at an alarming rate, which might give the meme a bit of extra urgency."
