        "text": "Jerry Seinfeld: Dr. Remnick.\n\nDavid Remnick: Sir.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: You really, really look like a doctor. Doesn't he look like a doctor?\n\nDavid Remnick: I do.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: If he walks, he's your car. I'm your cardiologist. You would just feel so calm.\n\nDavid Remnick: Would you?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Right. Yes. How'd feel? Oh, I'm in good hands here.\n\nDavid Remnick: Jerry, it's nothing to worry. Take a few tests.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Oh, you got the tone.\n\nDavid Remnick: You know that voice, or I think you do, but for the record, it's Jerry Seinfeld who came by our studios recently so he could determine, as my mother once did that I should have been a doctor.\n\nSpeaker 3: What's going on with you and Melanie? I know you're not getting married.\n\nDavid Remnick: Seinfeld was famously this show about nothing or maybe not nothing exactly, but we broke up about very small, very petty things and the ludicrous amount of mental energy we expend on.\n\nSpeaker 3: Well, we were having dinner the other night and she's got the strangest habit. She eats her peas one at a time. [laughter] You've never seen anything like it. It takes her an hour to finish them. We've had dinner other times. I've seen her eat corn niblets but she scooped them. [laughter]\n\nSpeaker 4: She scooped the niblets.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yes. That's what was so vexing. [l;daughter]\n\nDavid Remnick: That fixation on the preposterously minor has always been at the core of Jerry Seinfeld's comedy, and it's certainly at the core of Unfrosted, his new movie, which takes a footnote in culinary history, the invention of the Pop-Tart, and treats it like an epic national battle. Now, this isn't Seinfeld's first feature. He wrote the animated Bee Movie, but Unfrosted is his debut as a director.\n\n[music]\n\nDavid Remnick: How did this project, which is hilarious and nuts in many ways, and it's so funny--\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Oh, thanks.\n\nDavid Remnick: It resonates with all kinds of things in the '60s and movies about the 60s, which we'll get to. How did you decide on this project?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: COVID [laughs].\n\nDavid Remnick: You were going out of your mind, weren't you?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Yes. My friend, Spike Feresten, the writer who wrote the Soup Nazi episode, we used to joke about making a movie about the Pop-Tart. It was a joke.\n\nSpeaker 4: The Kellogg's Pop-Tart suddenly appeared at Battle Creek Michigan, which as you cereal fans know, is the corporate headquarters of Kellogg's in a town I have always wanted to visit. [laughter] Because it seems like a cereal Silicon Valley of breakfast super scientists conceiving of a frosted fruit-filled heatable rectangles in the same shape as the box that comes in [laughter] and with the same nutrition as the box it comes in too.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: I go, \"There's no movie here.\" He goes, \"Give me one meeting. Let's just get the two writers that I love from Bee Movie, Barry Marder and Andy Robin. Let just the four of us do a Zoom and give me one meeting.\" Andy Robin says, \"Do you remember the scene in The Right Stuff where Jeff Goldblum and Harry Shearer run down the hall and they burst into the conference room and LBJ is sitting there, and they go, it's called Sputnik.\"\n\nSpeaker 5: It's called Sputnik.\n\nSpeaker 6: We know. Sit down.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: He goes, \"That's what this is.\" I went, \"Oh yes.\"\n\nSpeaker 7: As I was saying--\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Sitting with four comedy writers who love each other's sense of humor, the first 20 minutes, I do a 20-minute warmup of just nonsense, what'd you do last night? What'd you eat? What'd you watch? You just start laughing and having fun. This is how comedy is done. You can't have anybody in the room that doesn't have the same brain disaffect.\n\nDavid Remnick: What does that mean?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Regular people need courtesies and respect to converse and socialize with them. You can't say hostile things to them, to their face, but comedians love that.\n\nDavid Remnick: You don't get offended.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: No.\n\nDavid Remnick: There's no offense in the room.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: The offense is if it wasn't funny. That's the offense.\n\nDavid Remnick: The other person is never offended if you insult them, rag them, or something.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: As long as it's funny, which usually insulting someone in their face is pretty funny. [laughter] We don't think that there is much value in everything else in life. Everything else in life is pretty much a nuisance. If you can get a laugh out of it, it's worth it. That's the way you go through life. You only care about laughing and being funny.\n\nDavid Remnick: Describe these meetings to me, how they went during the course of however long they lasted.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: They were all the same. They start off with 15 to 20 minutes of absolute nonsense. There's a lot of really vile profanity, complaining about absolutely everything in anything. Then you go, \"Okay. What were we working on yesterday? What was the scene? Where are we going from here?\" Then you start to write, but you're in this mood now. That's how you write comedy. If somebody else walks in the room, everybody, you have to stop. What do you want? Yes, I know what-- dinner is fine. It's 6:00. That's fine. Could you please leave?\n\nDavid Remnick: You experience it as fun or you experience it as work, as effort?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: 50/50. It does have to make sense to an audience. That's the work. All you want to do is be totally insane.\n\nDavid Remnick: In the film, you play a marketing executive for Kellogg. It's set in '63. JFK is the president. The story centers around this race between the Kellogg Company and Post.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Which is true.\n\nDavid Remnick: Which is another popular cereal maker. They're both working toward a trip to the moon.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: That's right.\n\nDavid Remnick: They're working toward the creation of Pop-Tarts, whether they know it or not. Tell me about how that storyline originated.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Well, the storyline is the truth of the story, which I have always loved that Post came up with this idea. Kellogg's heard about it. Months before they were about to debut it in supermarkets, they freaked out. They go, we have to have the same thing as them. We have to get there before them. We have to make it better than them. That's what we came up with it's the right stuff. It's the US versus the Soviet Union to put a man on the moon.\n\nDavid Remnick: [laughs] Now we're of a similar age. We grew up on similar breakfast foods [laughter] and a lot else. I have vague memories of Walter Cronkite, who by the way, has a great role in this movie.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Yes, he's fantastic.\n\nDavid Remnick: A drunk, insane Walter Cronkite.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Kyle Dunnigan created a lot of that on the set.\n\nDavid Remnick: Very funny.\n\nSpeaker 7: Direct from CBS News in New York, this is the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite.\n\nWalter Cronkite: This just handed to me some major news from the Breakfast World. The Post cereal company of Battle Creek, Michigan has reportedly invented a shelf-stable heatable fruit pastry breakfast product. Shelf stable. Boy.\n\nDavid Remnick: Did you really like Pop-Tarts all that much growing up?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Oh, yes.\n\nDavid Remnick: How about now?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Still, yes.\n\nDavid Remnick: Really?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Yes. I love them.\n\nDavid Remnick: That's a good breakfast for you.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: No, I don't eat it for breakfast. I eat it after a bad show on a Wednesday night.\n\nDavid Remnick: I see. When have you ever had a bad show?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: A lot of times. To me, a bad show is I'm going to do four new pieces tonight. If three of them tank, it's a frustrating night.\n\nDavid Remnick: Now, you could do for Pop-Tarts what Barbie did for Barbie. This could be a big thing for them.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Except that Kellogg's did not even know we were doing this.\n\nDavid Remnick: No.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: No, they did not. We only called them three weeks ago-\n\nDavid Remnick: The way that the lawyers--\n\nJerry Seinfeld: -to tell them, \"By the way--\"--\n\nDavid Remnick: The lawyers didn't freak out?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: We found a lawyer in the Valley.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: -who said, \"Could you write us a letter saying that this is okay to do that We can show to Netflix?\" Netflix, when we pitch them this idea. is going to go, \"I assume you've checked this all out legally and the clearances.\" I go, \"Of course we have a letter right here.\"\n\nDavid Remnick: It's a guy from the Valley [laughs]. He says it's great.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: He says it's no problem.\n\nDavid Remnick: There's no fee paid to Kellogg's or Post, and no permission given or taken?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: No. Do you think--\n\nDavid Remnick: I think you're in big trouble.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Do you think that Kellogg's would make a movie where people lose their lives trying to invent a pastry or dive into dumpsters?\n\nDavid Remnick: Two children diving into dumpsters looking for the special fruit paste.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Yes.\n\n[laughter]\n\nSpeaker 9: Are your kids okay?\n\nSpeaker 10: Oh, sure. We live in nice homes and already had a complete breakfast.\n\nSpeaker 11: We come here for this.\n\nSpeaker 9: It's garbage.\n\nSpeaker 11: Is it, or is it some hot fruit letting the man doesn't want you to have?\n\nSpeaker 10: No wait. You have to have it like this.\n\nDavid Remnick: Now, you've got an amazing cast here, Melissa McCarthy, Jim Gaffigan, Sarah Cooper, Kristen Wiig.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Hugh Grant.\n\nDavid Remnick: Hugh Grant, which he's a little famous for being not so easy on set. Was that your experience?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Oh, yes, yes.\n\nDavid Remnick: Tell me about that.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: I love this man. My apologies to all the other people I've met. He's my favorite human.\n\nDavid Remnick: Hugh Grant?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Yes, he's my favorite human.\n\nDavid Remnick: Why?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Because his charm and funniness is what I dreamed of when I was a kid in the '60s. I want to be a charming, witty man. That never happened.\n\nDavid Remnick: You wanted to be [unintelligible 00:09:47] Grant?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Yes. Like you say, we grew up Muhammad Ali and JFK and Sean Connery. Those are men. We want to be like them. They were all witty and handsome-\n\nDavid Remnick: What was it like to work--\n\nJerry Seinfeld: -and had broad shoulders.\n\nDavid Remnick: Well, he apparently--\n\nJerry Seinfeld: He has all these things.\n\nDavid Remnick: He has the broad shoulders too.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: He has the shoulders, he has the wit. He knows how to have fun. He knows how to put people at ease. A lot of these actors, they're primadonnas and he told me he would be. I go, \"That's fine. I don't care what you are.\"\n\nDavid Remnick: Right off the bat he said, I'm going to be a pain in the neck.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Yes, yes. I don't care. What do I care?\n\nDavid Remnick: What do you mean?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: I don't care if someone's an asshole if they're charming. A charming asshole is way better than a boring polite person.\n\nDavid Remnick: How did it play itself out on set, for example, him being a charming asshole?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: I'd say, \"Hugh in this scene you're wearing these sunglasses. Would you be completely against the idea of not wearing sunglasses in the scene?\" This is a negotiating technique I learned. The answer you always want to get from your counterpart is no, not yes.\n\nDavid Remnick: Why is that?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Because people love to say no. They hate to say yes. Saying yes makes you feel vulnerable. Saying no makes you feel secure. You ask a question where the answer you want is no. \"Hugh, would you be totally against not wearing the glasses?\" \"No, I wouldn't be totally against it.\"\n\nDavid Remnick: [laughs] That's the finesse.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Yes, that's the finesse.\n\nDavid Remnick: Did you enjoy this new activity of directing?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: With these people when you have Melissa McCarthy, or Hugh, or Peter Dinklage-- Directing Peter Dinklage--\n\nDavid Remnick: He has a great [crosstalk] in the movie.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Thank you. It's like someone saying, \"Would you like to take this Ferrari out for a drive?\" It can do anything you ask it to do, anything. That is a lot of fun. He is a thrill.\n\nSpeaker 6: Are you a milkman?\n\nSpeaker 7: The name's Harry Friendly. You might say I am the milkman. You know the first taste a human being experiences at birth?\n\nSpeaker 6: Applesauce.\n\nSpeaker 7: Oh. Milk, Mr. Cabana. In the milk business, we are not just part of the American dream. We are the white in the red, white and blue. We are the cream that rises so famously to the top. You, Mr. Cabana, have become the annoying white ring that sticks to the bottom.\n\nDavid Remnick: Jerry, you must get any number of ideas for films either-\n\nJerry Seinfeld: No, wrong. Wrong.\n\nDavid Remnick: -brought to you or you have. No.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Never got an idea. This is the only idea I've ever had for a film.\n\nDavid Remnick: Really?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: I never get asked to do a film.\n\nDavid Remnick: Really?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Never.\n\nDavid Remnick: Why the hell would that be?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: I don't know. When I was at Dreamworks and we were casting Bee Movie, this casting director came in and she had two cards, a blue card and a pink card. On each card were the biggest male stars, and on the pink card were the biggest female stars in the business at that time. This is 2000s. We go through the names. By the way, there's like 12 names on each card. That's it. We were casting the thing, and before she leaves I go, \"Can I ask you? Am I on that blue card?\" [laughter] She says, \"No.\"\n\nDavid Remnick: Nice.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: I went, \"Why not?\" She said, \"Because everybody knows you won't do it.\"\n\nDavid Remnick: Was she right?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Yes.\n\nDavid Remnick: Well, Hamlet maybe but you wouldn't do any number of other things if the project is right.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: You have to realize if you look at my career, I have never succeeded at anything that wasn't my material. Not one time. I've only done it once, and it was a huge failure when I did Benson in 1980.\n\nDavid Remnick: You felt it to be a failure. You thought it was a critical failure.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: It was a total failure. I have to write my own material or I stink.\n\n[music]\n\nDavid Remnick: I'm talking with Jerry Seinfeld. His new film is called Unfrosted. We'll continue in just a moment on The New Yorker Radio Hour.\n\n[music]\n\nDavid Remnick: This is The New Yorker Radio Hour. I'm David Remnick, and I'm talking today with Jerry Seinfeld. I was going to say the comedian, Jerry Seinfeld, but that feels a little New York Timesy, like the renowned physicist, Albert Einstein. Seinfeld co-wrote and directed the new film Unfrosted. He's not one of those people who had to find himself exactly. As a kid, Seinfeld fell in love with the comedians on television, and he was still in his 20s when he got a spot on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show.\n\nJohnny Carson: Would you welcome him, please? Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Wow. Good evening. Boy, this is so exciting for me. I'm so excited to be here.\n\nDavid Remnick: After nine seasons of Seinfeld, Jerry quit while he was way ahead. He's become a professor of comedy, continuing to do standup and shooting the series, Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee Cars, driving around and joking and analyzing comedy with every great comic of our time. Back to my discussion with Jerry Seinfeld.\n\n[music]\n\nDavid Remnick: It's possible that you've probably made a dollar or two from Seinfeld and yet you still work so hard, why?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Because the only thing in life that's really worth having is good skill. Good skill is the greatest possession. The things that money buys are fine. They're good. I like them, but having a skill, I learned this from reading Esquire magazine. I did an issue on mastery. Do you remember that?\n\nDavid Remnick: I don't.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: I'm surprised.\n\nDavid Remnick: [laughs]\n\nJerry Seinfeld: You definitely read Esquire.\n\nDavid Remnick: Oh yes. Of course.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: I loved Esquire in the '60s. A magazine for men, remember?\n\nDavid Remnick: Yes, I do.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: They did one issue. In fact, I got to get this issue. I get it on eBay. I'm sure it's there. It's a very Zen Buddhist concept. Pursue mastery, that will fulfill your life. You will feel good. Nothing else. I know a lot of rich people, so do you. They don't feel good as you think they should and would. They don't. They're miserable. I work because in standup comedy, if you don't do it a lot you stink.\n\nWe call it a phone. We don't even use it as a phone. Nobody's talking on the phone. [laughter] Once they gave you the option, you could talk, you could type talking into that day, it's over.[laughter] Talking is obsolete. It's antiquated. I feel like a blacksmith up here sometimes to tell you the truth. [laughter] I could text you this whole thing. We can get the hell out of here right now. [laughter]\n\nDavid Remnick: Who did you start listening to or watching in comedy and say, \"That's the skill I want to learn.\"\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Robert Klein and Jay Leno were the two guys, and George Carlin. Bill Cosby, I loved, but I thought I could never be that good.\n\nDavid Remnick: I mean as a kid.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: You mean like six, seven?\n\nDavid Remnick: Yes, or junior high school, or whatever.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Peter Sellers was a huge obsession of mine as a kid. There's one line in Unfrosted that a lot of the producers did not like, and they said, \"You got to take it out. It's too stupid. It really makes no sense at all.\" I go, \"But for one second in my life, I got to be Peter Sellers.\"\n\nDavid Remnick: What was the line?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: The line is at the funeral and we have this elaborate full serial honors scene and the widow of--\n\nDavid Remnick: Say who you're burying?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: We're burying Steve Schwinn who lost his life trying to create the Pop-Tart. His wife says to me, looking at this insane ceremony, and she says, \"Did you plan this?\" I go, \"I don't know. I don't know.\" [chuckles] Which is impossible. You can't not know that. Either you planned it or you didn't plan it. You can't not know. Inspector [unintelligible 00:18:46] would say that.\n\nDavid Remnick: Jerry, tell me about being a beginner, just a funny kid who wants to take the big leap into comedy.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: The leap was so terrifying. I don't know why, but I had no confidence in that I might be funny to people that don't know me. I drove to this club, the Golden Lion Pub 143 West 44th Street, no longer.\n\nDavid Remnick: What year?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: 1975. I'm still at Queens College and they have a audition. I think there were just a few people there. I did this joke about being left-handed, and it got a laugh. Then they booked me on the--\n\nDavid Remnick: I want to hear the joke.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: The joke is-- [laughter]\n\nI'm left-handed. Left-handed people do not like that the word left is so often associated with negative things through left feet, left-handed compliment. What are we having for dinner, leftovers. [laughter] You go to a party, there's nobody there. Where'd everybody go? They left.\n\nDavid Remnick: Oh, it's a pretty cute joke.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: It's not a bad joke.\n\nDavid Remnick: It's a cute joke.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: It's not a bad joke\n\nDavid Remnick: How did it go over?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Huge, and it got a huge laugh, and--\n\nDavid Remnick: Can you remember the feeling?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Yes, and the applause. You know that scene in the Elton John movie when he's at the Troubadour, he goes off the ground, and the audience comes off the ground? I love that scene. That's what it felt like. I felt like, \"Oh my God. I'm a plane, and I just left the ground.\" I just knew from that moment, \"That's it. I now know what I will do the rest of my life.\"\n\nDavid Remnick: That's incredibly inspiring, and at the same time, huge pressure.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Why is it pressure?\n\nDavid Remnick: Because you then have to write more jokes and repeat it.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: The book that got me into comedy is a book called The Last Laugh by Phil Berger. I read it in high school. There's a joke in there that Jimmie Walker told at Catch a Rising Star. It's a pouring, rainy night in Manhattan. He goes on stage, he's soaking wet. He goes, \"It is raining so hard out there, I just saw Superman getting into a cab.\" I read that, and I go, \"How in the world can a brain come up with an idea like that?\" I still love that joke. I love that joke. I go, \"How do you think of that?\" I didn't know how. When I did the left thing, I went, \"Oh, there's a guy in there that knows how to do it, and he's going to now work his off for the rest of my life.\"\n\nDavid Remnick: You became disciplined right away?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Not right away. It was after I saw a comedian do a couple of Tonight Shows and get bounced that I realized--\n\nDavid Remnick: Who was that?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: I don't want to mention the name. He went on, he did well. The second time he went on, he did less well. The third time he struggled, and they never had him back. I went, \"Oh. Now I get how this racket works. This is a writer's game. If you can write you succeed. If you can't, you will not make it.\" To perform and being funny on stage, that's great, any comedian can be funny on stage, but the bullets are the writing.\n\nDavid Remnick: Not long ago, I was watching on YouTube, not for the first time and maybe for the thousandth, Rodney Dangerfield's performances on The Tonight Show, which are insanely good and like filled with rocket fuel.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Yes.\n\nRodney Dangerfield: Expect it all. When I was born, a doctor told my mother, \"I did all I could, but he pulled through anyway.\" [laughter] I mean, I don't get no respect from anyone. Last week, my house was on fire. My wife told the kids, \"Be quiet, you'll wake up Daddy.\" [laughter]\n\nDavid Remnick: He's a great writer. He's invented this character, which is himself times 11, I guess. How did you invent how you wanted to be on stage, the persona?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: It's like sculpting. Sculpting is removing everything that isn't the sculpture you want to make. You're not adding, you're removing. Stone sculpture, not clay. When you do a joke and it gets a laugh, and something inside you doesn't feel quite right, you don't do that joke. You do the jokes that you feel connect to your anger, your attitude, your personality. Success in comedy is very much conducting, so the face, the voice, the body, the joke. When all of us are working together, it hits, bang. You just feel it. You feel it like hitting a baseball on the button. When one of them is a little off, it's not there.\n\nDavid Remnick: What do you think about the difference between doing a comedy film for Netflix and doing a night at the Beacon? It's the same thing, and yet it's not.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: The only similarity is your sense of humor is an essential tool. After that, it's all different. There's no similarity. A night at the Beacon, to me, is like if you're a great jazz player, and people come in and they want to hear you play, and you're going on and go, \"I know this instrument. I'm good at it. Let's all enjoy the playing.\"\n\nDavid Remnick: For the jazz musician or any musician, they want to hear Round Midnight or Born to Run or whatever it is again, and again, and again. Do you feel that's okay for jokes, or is there constant pressure to make it new and make it new all the time?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: We don't have enough time for that conversation. That would take another hour.\n\nDavid Remnick: What do you mean?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: It's a heavy conversation. It's a constant issue in the comedy world. Everybody has a different opinion about it.\n\nDavid Remnick: Give me the short version.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: The short version is there's no answer. If I love a bit that somebody does, and I go and they do the bit, I love it. If you see them after the show, they go, \"You did the peanut bit. I love the peanut bit,\" you go, \"I know. I'm trying to get it out of my act and do something new,\" they go, \"No, I love that bit.\" Who's right? There's no answer. I think if you go see a comedian and he does some great stuff that you know and a bunch of stuff that you don't know, the audience is happy.\n\nI think comedians now try so hard to be all new all the time, I think the quality suffers, because none of us are really that good. Chris Rock and I have determined that a great comedian working his ass off his entire career writes two good hours. The rest is--\n\nDavid Remnick: How many specials have you done for Netflix?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Two, and I don't think I'll do another one.\n\nDavid Remnick: Really?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Yes.\n\nDavid Remnick: Why not?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Again, we don't have time for that. These are gigantic subjects in comedy, but I won't put it out there unless I think it's of a certain quality, and I doubt I could get to that in the time I have left. I don't like old people either. Even though I'm 70, I don't like old people.\n\nDavid Remnick: You're about to be 70, right?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Whatever.\n\nDavid Remnick: How are you feeling about that?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: I don't care.\n\nDavid Remnick: Really?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Yes.\n\nDavid Remnick: You look good.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Thanks.\n\nDavid Remnick: Do you feel good?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Yes. That's it.\n\nDavid Remnick: You're working?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Yes.\n\nDavid Remnick: When you say you don't like old men, do you mean that in a kind of Friars Club sort of way?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: No, I don't like old people, Period. They don't look good. Everything's deteriorating. I don't want to see this. If you want to hang around, fine, but we're moving on to younger people. I feel like God is like, \"I'm with you up to about 38. If you want to stay, you can stay, but I'm moving on.\"\n\nDavid Remnick: Did you not like old comedians?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: No, I love old comedians. I do because they just get better. This is the great blessing. On the other side of the material, torture. On the other side of that, the blessing of it, you just get better and better.\n\nDavid Remnick: Tell me how you deal with the weight of the world, or the serious aspects of the world weigh on you, and how that affects comedy?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Nothing really affects comedy. People always need it. They need it so badly, and they don't get it. It used to be you would go home at the end of the day, most people would go, \"Oh, Cheers is on,\" \"Oh, M*A*S*H is on,\" \"Mary Tyler Moore is on,\" \"All in the Family is on.\" You just expect that, \"There'll be some funny stuff we can watch on TV tonight.\" Guess what? Where is it? Where is it? This is the result of the extreme left and PC crap, and people worrying so much about offending other people.\n\nNow, they're going to see standup comics, because we are not policed by anyone. The audience polices us. We know when we're off-track. We know instantly, and we adjust to it instantly. When you write a script and it goes into four or five different hands, committees, groups, \"Here's our thought about this joke,\" well, that's the end of your comedy.\n\nDavid Remnick: Have you had that experience?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: No.\n\nDavid Remnick: Isn't that what Curb is all about?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Yes. [crosstalk] Larry was grandfathered in. He's old enough that, \"I don't have to observe those rules because I started before you made those rules.\" We did an episode of the series in the '90s, where Kramer decides to start a business of having homeless pull Rickshaws, because as he says, \"They're outside anyway.\"\n\n[laughter]\n\nKramer: What about the homeless?\n\n[laughter]\n\nNewman: Can we worry about them later?\n\nKramer: To pull the rickshaw.\n\nNewman: They do have an intimate knowledge of the street.\n\nKramer: Oh, he's walking around the city. Why not just strap something to them? [laughter]\n\nNewman Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.\n\n[laughter]\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Do you think I could get that episode on the air today?\n\nDavid Remnick: Do you think Larry got grandfathered in, and there could be no 35-year-old version?\n\nDavid Remnick: Right. If Larry was 35, he couldn't get away with his like the watermelon stuff, and Palestinian chicken, and you know. HBO knows that's what people come here for, but they're not smart enough to figure out, how do we do this now? Do we take the heat, or just not be funny? We would write a different joke with Kramer and the Rickshaw today. We wouldn't do that joke. We came up with another joke. They move the gates like in the skii. The gates are moving. Your job is to be agile and clever enough that wherever they put the gates, I'm going to make the gate.\n\nDavid Remnick: You think this is going away now? What you're describing as PC, is exceeding?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Slightly. I see a slight movement.\n\nDavid Remnick: How do you see it?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: With certain comedians now, people are having fun with them stepping over the line, and us all laughing about it. Again, it's the stand-ups that really have the freedom to do it because no one else gets the blame if it doesn't go down well. He or she can take all the blame themselves.\n\nDavid Remnick: Who are the young ones that you like?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Nate Bargatze. I love Ronny Chieng. I love a Brian Simpson, really funny. Mark Normand, really funny. Sam Morril, really funny.\n\nDavid Remnick: Do you ever go to clubs?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Yes, I go all the time. I don't go and sit there and pay for two drinks and watch and go, \"This guy's fantastic.\" No. I go to work out my own stuff. [laughter]\n\nDavid Remnick: Jerry, for Unfrosted, you actually wrote a song titled Sweet Morning Heat. You wrote the lyrics with Jimmy Fallon.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: No, I wrote it with Mark Ronson. Jimmy sang it.\n\nDavid Remnick: By the way, who can sing. He and Meghan Trainor sang the tune, and Mark and Andrew Wyatt produced it, right?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Right. David, when I walked in this studio and I had this piece of paper where I wrote, and I spent hours on it because there's certain lines you can sing, there's certain lines you can't. I don't know anything really about singing. I said to Mark, \"I wrote these lyrics,\" and I started reading them, and he nodded his head and there was a long pause, and he went, \"That's not bad.\" Oh, my God, that was one of my greatest moments of my life.\n\nDavid Remnick: \"It's not bad.\"\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Yes. He said that's not bad. I went, \"Really?\" He said, \"Yes, that's not bad. We could do something with those.\" I don't know if you could make out the lyrics when you watch the movie. I haven't seen it in the movie.\n\nDavid Remnick: That's why I'm asking. Would you like to sing us a little bit?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: No, I can't sing.\n\nDavid Remnick: Can you recite it?\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Why?\n\nDavid Remnick: [laughs]\n\n[Music- Sweet Morning Heat-Jimmy Fallon & Meghan Trainor]\n\nPlease, give me that sweet morning heat\n\nEvery single day of the week\n\nDavid Remnick: Jerry Seinfeld, thank you so much.\n\n[Music- Sweet Morning Heat-Jimmy Fallon & Meghan Trainor]\n\nIf you've got all the loving I need\n\nGive me that sweet morning\n\nGive me that sweet morning\n\nGive me that sweet morning\n\nDavid Remnick: Jerry Seinfeld is the director and star of Unfrosted. He worked on a TV show called, let me see if I can think of it, Seinfeld. This is the New Yorker Radio Hour. Stick around.\n\n[Music- Sweet Morning Heat-Jimmy Fallon & Meghan Trainor]\n\nBut somehow it wasn't ever enough\n\nIs there a reason I just can't stay away?\n\nI like a rectangle that I can heat up\n\nThe moment we connected\n\nIt was written on the box\n\nMy toaster is electric\n\nIt's the top that--\n\n[00:33:36] [END OF AUDIO]\n\nCopyright © 2024 New York Public Radio.
