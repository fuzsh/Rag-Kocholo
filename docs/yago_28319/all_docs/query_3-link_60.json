        "text": "Pop-Tarts Movie: Trailer Released for Jerry Seinfeld’s Quirky New Film\n\nThe Pop-Tarts movie Unfrosted has released its trailer, and the film looks as delightfully unhinged as its plot sounds.\n\nAs previously reported, the film is an adaptation of one of Jerry Seinfeld’s most popular jokes. Back in June 2021, Seinfeld told Deadline, “Stuck at home watching endless sad faces on TV, I thought this would be a good time to make something based on pure silliness. So, we took my Pop-Tart stand-up bit from my last Netflix special and exploded it into a giant, crazy comedy movie.”\n\nUnfrosted will be a Netflix exclusive, which is an extension of the sitcom legend’s current relationship with the streaming giant. Netflix is already home to a number of Seinfeld properties, including Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, two stand-up specials (Jerry Before Seinfeld and 23 Hours to Kill) and, of course, all 180 episodes of Seinfeld.\n\nPer Netflix, the logline of the film reads, “Michigan, 1963. Kellogg’s and Post, sworn cereal rivals, race to create a pastry that will change the face of breakfast forever.“\n\nMore Information About Unfrosted\n\nUnfrosted marks the directorial debut of Seinfeld. For a directorial debut, he sure is leading quite the all-star cast. Joining Seinfeld in front of the camera is Melissa McCarthy, Jim Gaffigan, Amy Schumer, Hugh Grant, Max Greenfield, Christian Slater, Bill Burr, Daniel Levy, James Marsden, Jack McBrayer, Thomas Lennon, Bobby Moynihan, Adrian Martinex, Sarah Cooper and Fred Armisen. If you can believe it, thee are even more stars we didn’t even list!\n\nSeinfeld admits that the cast is rather large and noted in a Netflix press release that few people were on board at first, but then they landed Hugh Grant to be Tony the Tiger, the mascot of Frosted Flakes. Somehow, after landing Grant, everyone wanted in on this very unique movie.\n\nThe premise of the movie loosely chronicles the invention of the Pop-Tart, the iconic breakfast food. Seinfeld said in a statement, “This really did happen in Battle Creek, Michigan, where Kellogg’s and Post were located, and they did compete to come up with this product, but the rest of it is complete lunacy.”\n\nUnfrosted hits Netflix on May 3. If you don’t watch this movie while eating Pop-Tarts, it seems like a lost opportunity, but who are we to tell you how to live your life.\n\nJerry Seinfeld's 'Pop-Tarts' Film: See the All-Star Cast\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
