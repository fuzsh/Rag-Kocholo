        "text": "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nLINDA HOLMES, HOST:\n\nYou might call them product biopics. We've had movies about Air Jordans, the BlackBerry, the Beanie Baby, and now Pop-Tarts. Jerry Seinfeld stars in, cowrote and directed the new Netflix film \"Unfrosted,\" which tells a fanciful invented version of the tasty treats' origins.\n\nAISHA HARRIS, BYLINE: Seinfeld is joined by a big cast of generally funny people, including Melissa McCarthy, Amy Schumer, Jim Gaffigan and Hugh Grant. But is this movie as satisfying as the Pop-Tart itself? I'm Aisha Harris.\n\nHOLMES: And I'm Linda Holmes, and no it is not. And today, we are talking about \"Unfrosted\" on POP CULTURE HAPPY HOUR From NPR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nHOLMES: Joining us today is our POP CULTURE HAPPY HOUR co-host Stephen Thompson. Hello, Stephen.\n\nSTEPHEN THOMPSON, BYLINE: Hello, Linda.\n\nHOLMES: So unlike movies like \"Air,\" \"BlackBerry\" and so forth, \"Unfrosted,\" you should know, is not the actual story of Pop-Tarts. It is instead a very silly, made-up story in which Jerry Seinfeld, who directed and cowrote the movie, plays a Kellogg's executive named Bob Cabana. Bob's boss, Edsel Kellogg, played by Jim Gaffigan, needs a new breakfast idea. And that's because Post, the company's archrival, is trying to accomplish the same. Post is led by Marjorie Post, played by Amy Schumer.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"UNFROSTED\")\n\nAMY SCHUMER: (As Marjorie Post) Well, well, King Kellogg. Good luck tonight. Not that you need it, right?\n\nJIM GAFFIGAN: (As Edsel Kellogg III) I don't know. That fruity gravel of yours made quite a splash.\n\nMAX GREENFIELD: (As Rick Ludwin) Pebbles - Fruity Pebbles. Rick Ludwin, also with Post. I have been eating you for years.\n\nHOLMES: That is Max Greenfield as Marjorie's right-hand man. It's very hard to explain the rest of the story, except to say Melissa McCarthy plays Stan, Bob's closest ally. And many, many, many other famous people pop up in little roles. Hugh Grant plays Thurl Ravenscroft, the voice of Tony the Tiger, and James Marsden plays, maybe the original fitness influencer, Jack LaLanne - things like that.\n\nIt's streaming on Netflix, and it feels a lot like a very long skit or a very long sequence of skits. And rather than attempt to explain the plot or impose a plot, I want to get right into it. Stephen, what did you think of \"Unfrosted\"?\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, let's start with the positive, right? The stakes here could not possibly be lower. This is streaming on Netflix. It is kind of a parody/homage to these different product biopics. I probably enjoyed it more than I enjoyed \"Flamin' Hot,\" if I'm being honest. At least this film is not claiming to be an honest portrayal of what it is.\n\nI did enjoy seeing many of these faces pop up. A lot of very funny people you know and love will pop up in doses ranging from five seconds to five minutes. But whoo boy - you know the saying, like, this could have been an email?\n\nHARRIS: Yes. Yes.\n\nTHOMPSON: This...\n\nHOLMES: Yeah.\n\nTHOMPSON: ...Should have been a Funny Or Die sketch. Kind of the way, like, \"Weird: The Al Yankovic Story\" was, like, rooted in this, like, Funny Or Die sketch, and then they kind of blew it out into a full-length movie. This really feels like a three- to five-minute bit - right? - where you have these same people kind of telling the funniest jokes in this movie. And I feel like they could have really put together a really nice, viral skit.\n\nSo the runtime of this film is a shade over 90 minutes. The closing credits, where the screen comes up to black, start at the 87-minute mark, and that's after a musical number. And boy, you feel every one of those 87 minutes.\n\nHOLMES: Yeah. Agreed.\n\nTHOMPSON: They are groaning to get to that runtime. So on one hand, like, you'll stream it on Netflix. You'll pause it every five to 10 minutes to see if it's over yet...\n\nHOLMES: (Laughter).\n\nTHOMPSON: ...But where is it coming from? I thought it would be satirizing other films like it, but it doesn't feel like it is. It just feels like one gag stretched to a movie.\n\nHOLMES: Yeah. The one thing that I think it does well in some cases, which is very silly jokes. There are a handful of places in this film where I think the very silly jokes work really well. I think the little montage where they introduce - the Kelloggs team comes up with this idea of taste pilots. There's a whole thing comparing this to kind of the space program at the time. They come up with the idea of these taste pilots. That's where you see the Schwinn bike guy played by Jack McBrayer. That's where you see Jack LaLanne. You have somebody playing Chef Boy Ardee and somebody playing the inventor of Sea-Monkeys.\n\nThat idea, to me, that they brought in all these people who were good at products of different kinds. That to me is a funny idea, and I think that little sequence where they introduced them is funny. I think James Marsden as Jack LaLanne is pretty funny in, like, the 30 seconds that he's in this movie.\n\nI also think - there's a funeral later in this film - I did think that was funny. I did think the little bits in that made me giggle. I mean, not made me giggle - made me think about giggling (laughter).\n\nHARRIS: Let's not overstate things here (laughter).\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"UNFROSTED\")\n\nHUGH GRANT: (As Thurl Ravenscroft) Steve was gr-r-reat (ph).\n\nMELISSA MCCARTHY: (As Donna Stankowski) He'd like that.\n\nJERRY SEINFELD: (As Bob Cabana) Yeah.\n\nMICHAEL JOSEPH PIERCE: (As General Mills) He lived his life like he built his bicycles, with little regard for safety. When a man gives the last full serving suggestion of himself, only then is he truly deserving...\n\nHOLMES: I did think that was funny. And I would think that that was a good skit if I saw it on, like, \"Saturday Night Live.\" I'd be like, yeah, that's pretty funny. The cereal - they make some good use of the cereal mascots. But Stephen's absolutely right that it stretches out to the point where they are so close to the bottom of the barrel that they decide that the next good thing to do is a January 6 bit...\n\nTHOMPSON: Yeah.\n\nHARRIS: Oh, my God.\n\nTHOMPSON: Why?\n\nHARRIS: Yeah.\n\nHOLMES: ...Which, A, it's in incredibly poor taste. But B, it's just lazy and not funny.\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, it's also toothless.\n\nHOLMES: Well, and they literally resort to - you know, the setup of it is, they don't want the new Pop-Tart to be certified - ugh - so all these mascots are potentially going to break into the Kelloggs building to keep it from being certified. And they resort to naming the person who is in charge of certifying it, Mike Punts. And I was like, OK, this is not the level of anything that I expect from any of these people.\n\nAisha, when I first told you that I had seen, like, the first 20 minutes of this movie, and it was not as unwatchable as I thought it was going to be - which is how I felt 20 minutes into it - I've clearly sensed that it was as unwatchable as you expected it to be.\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nHOLMES: Or perhaps didn't expect it to be. I don't know. Tell me what you thought about \"Unfrosted.\"\n\nHARRIS: I had seen the horizon...\n\nHOLMES: Your future (laughter).\n\nHARRIS: ...And I had seen that it plunged into the dark (laughter). I want to take you back actually to last December - December 2023, Orlando, Fla., giant football stadium. There's a person in a full-body Pop-Tart costume with a smiley face plastered on the front of it, standing on top of a gigantic, quote-unquote, \"toaster.\" It's not actually a toaster, but it looks like a toaster. It's huge. They're holding a sign that reads dreams really do come true. And then they are proceeded to be lowered into the toaster while Donna Summers' \"Hot Stuff\" blasts over the speakers, and an announcer yells, we'll always love you strawberry. We can't wait to eat you. And out of the toaster pops a giant actual Pop-Tart that's like the shape of a giant sheet cake that the Kansas State football team proceeds to eat.\n\nNow, this was at the Pop-Tarts Bowl, something I didn't know existed. Apparently, it was originally the Blockbuster Bowl. I'm not saying that this Pop-Tart sacrifice in Orlando, Fla., on a football stadium was more entertaining than \"Unfrosted.\" But I'm not not saying that either.\n\nHOLMES: Oh, no, it was - I would agree with that.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHOLMES: Especially, like, on average because it was so short.\n\nHARRIS: Oh...\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nHARRIS: ...Well, yes, it's like a 2-, 2 1/2-minute video. And my God, that thing brought me way more pure joy than this movie ever could. Even in the moments where I was like, oh, it's kind of cool to see this random character actor who I've loved in lots of other things.\n\nI was wondering, A, who is this for? Because I feel as though anyone under the age of 35 probably, like, doesn't know half of the jokes that are being told in here because it's set in the '60s, and it's, like, a lot of very lowbrow, like, ha-ha, the '60s - Vietnam. That seems like a good idea.\n\nHOLMES: Hippies. Granola.\n\nHARRIS: I know.\n\nTHOMPSON: Yeah, boy.\n\nHARRIS: But then I'm like, well, who over the age of 35 is going to, like, find any of this entertaining? It's just, like, we've eaten cereal, but do we care this much about cereal? No. I just didn't understand why Jon Hamm was in here. I didn't understand why certain people were just here to, like - oh, Peter Dinklage? What even, like - Peter Dinklage.\n\nAISHA HARRIS AND LINDA HOLMES: Christian Slater.\n\nHARRIS: Like, what is happening? Why are you here?\n\nHOLMES: Yeah.\n\nTHOMPSON: I wanted to touch on one other thing that bothered me about this film. We've talked about how many people in this film are not only good comic performers, but good actors. Jerry Seinfeld is many things, but he is not a good actor. And to place him at the center of this film, and to have him sort of playing the, like, comedic lead in this film, oh, I just found him so stiff.\n\nHOLMES: Yeah. I am prepared to say, despite the fact that I know how many people will disagree, but I do think since \"Seinfeld\" ended, there's a lot of kind of talking about Jerry Seinfeld as, like, what a great scholar of comedy. And, like, there's a recent thing that David Remnick did a conversation with him that they published in The New Yorker where he talks about like, oh, you're just so - you spend so much time, like, thinking about comedy. And it's, like, Stephen and I have talked about how this used to happen with The Onion where you would get over and over and over conversations about like, oh, I can't believe how long they sit and work on these headlines.\n\nHARRIS: Yeah. That's how comedy people are. They work as hard as everybody else.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHOLMES: They all do this, right?\n\nHARRIS: Yeah.\n\nTHOMPSON: Right.\n\nHOLMES: And I feel like I'm constantly being asked to admire how much Jerry Seinfeld thinks about comedy. But in the end, the result, to me, is just not there, other than the fact that he made one very successful sitcom and certainly had a style, like, in the '90s.\n\nTHOMPSON: And was an enormously influential stand-up comedian.\n\nHARRIS: Yeah.\n\nHOLMES: Sure.\n\nHARRIS: Yeah.\n\nHOLMES: Of course. But I think since then, I don't know that there's much else in the tank at this point, and I think, you know, I alluded to the David Remnick interview in The New Yorker. That's also another one where, as he has done in the past, he kind of launched into his, PC people have ruined - have killed comedy and everything. And you don't want to just be like, you know, well, when you consider how good \"Unfrosted\" is, you have to take into account how you feel about these Jerry Seinfeld remarks about woke comedy. But I do think you have to take into account \"Unfrosted\" because the question is, really, is this your thing? Like, is what you're upset about that there aren't enough opportunities to do Mike Puntz jokes about January 6? Like, is that what we're missing because - I don't know.\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, it's so weird coming from him. Jerry Seinfeld has always worked clean. Like, his persona has never been particularly edgy from a standpoint of, oh, my gosh, he can't say that.\n\nHOLMES: Yeah.\n\nTHOMPSON: And so then the context around those comments is, also watch for my new movie \"Unfrosted\" on Netflix is just so wild to me - the disconnect.\n\nHARRIS: Well, he's also kind of entered into that sort of untouchable multi-millionaire phase. Like, his whole thing in the last, like, 10-ish years has been \"Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee.\" And it's, like, he has lost touch, I think, in a way that a lot of comedians of his age, and basically, people in any sort of art form can lose touch. And I think even to Stephen's point, he was never edgy, to begin with, in a way.\n\nI think he's still the exact type of person, the exact type of comedian who would be like, well, I'm going to defend my right to say these things if I wanted to say them. There is nothing here that screams to me, like, this is of-the-moment comedy, this is, like, edgy in any way. And, you know, look, it seems like everyone in this movie seems to have a fun time, but I don't know if anyone who actually watches this is going to enjoy themselves half as much as they seem to be.\n\nHOLMES: Yeah. Well, and, you know, I will say I think that if this movie had 90 minutes of silly jokes as good to me as the funeral sequence or the Jack LaLanne stuff or a couple of the other things, I wouldn't expect it to necessarily be timely. I wouldn't necessarily expect it to be satire.\n\nHARRIS: Yeah. I do find it interesting - he gave an interview, I think, with the Associated Press, and he was asked if this was at all sort of, like, influenced by all of these movies, these product movies, you know, your \"Airs,\" your \"BlackBerrys,\" and he said no. And he was like, well, I didn't realize it was part of a trend. And I'm, like, I actually think that it would have been better had this movie been actually trying to take cues from these last few.\n\nTHOMPSON: Right.\n\nHOLMES: Hundred percent.\n\nHARRIS: Because that's kind of what I thought it was going to be, which is why I was giving even, like, even a little bit of, like, I was going into it, like, maybe this is actually just going to be kind of making - kind of, like, you know, \"Not Another Teen Movie\"...\n\nHOLMES: Right.\n\nHARRIS: ...Or \"Scary Movie.\" It's like that kind of thing. And instead, it's just, like, the jokes are just so untargeted.\n\nTHOMPSON: I sort of felt like this was going to buy back some of the time I've spent watching movies like \"Flamin' Hot\" and \"Air\"...\n\nHARRIS: Yeah.\n\nTHOMPSON: ...Where, like, ha-ha, we have finally reached a critical mass with this kind of product biopic, where we're going to, like, puncture the formulas to the point where maybe people make fewer of them.\n\nHOLMES: In my opinion, this entire movie should have been the labor dispute with the mascots.\n\nHARRIS: Agree.\n\nHOLMES: One, it had some of the best jokes. Two, it has Hugh Grant as Thurl Ravenscroft...\n\nTHOMPSON: Yeah.\n\nHOLMES: ...Which I...\n\nHARRIS: He was fun.\n\nHOLMES: ...Think is very funny 'cause Thurl...\n\nHARRIS: Yeah.\n\nHOLMES: ...Ravenscroft is a real guy, and that is funny to me. And three, because mascots are inherently funny. And you can show, like, mascots...\n\nTHOMPSON: Right.\n\nHOLMES: ...Running around, mascots falling down, mascots taking their heads off. If they make \"Unfrosted II: War Of The Mascots,\" I am probably going to sit down and watch that whole thing.\n\nHARRIS: We haven't asked and answered, though, the most crucial question to come out of this film, which is what is the best Pop-Tart?\n\nHOLMES: Now, see, Aisha, you and I were getting into this the other day.\n\nTHOMPSON: Oh, yeah.\n\nHOLMES: Give your answer first because I'm going to give you pride of place.\n\nHARRIS: Wow.\n\nHOLMES: Open the conversation, give your answer first and then my head will explode.\n\nHARRIS: OK. Well, my answer is the brown sugar cinnamon Pop-Tart. Putting fruit in an already kind of not fresh thing, it just seems not good to me, and it just tastes weird and (vocalizing). But the brown sugar cinnamon, that stuff's always gonna taste good. And, like, when you warm it up, it's gooey. It's brown sugar. It's cinnamon. It's sugar. That's it.\n\nHOLMES: So you actually warm up your Pop-Tarts?\n\nHARRIS: Sometimes. But when I don't, it's still decent.\n\nTHOMPSON: I've set too many of them on fire.\n\nHOLMES: Yeah.\n\nTHOMPSON: They're too flammable for the toaster.\n\nHOLMES: I almost never warm up my Pop-Tarts. I am a strawberry Pop-Tart girl. And...\n\nHARRIS: (Vocalizing).\n\nHOLMES: ...I just feel like the fruit Pop-Tart with the frosting, that's the way to go. That's what I like. How good are they? They're good enough that I'm sitting here thinking I actually have to do a small grocery shopping later. I think I'm going to get a box of strawberry Pop-Tarts.\n\nTHOMPSON: I'm with Linda, basically. I like a fruit Pop-Tart. And what I specifically like is not just the frosting, but the frosting that has, like, little specks of, like, Pop Rocks.\n\nHOLMES: Yeah. It has a little sugar sprinkled in it.\n\nTHOMPSON: Textually speaking, I like sugar crystals on...\n\nHOLMES: Yeah.\n\nTHOMPSON: ...Top of frosting...\n\nHOLMES: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nTHOMPSON: ...On top of high fructose corn syrup.\n\nHARRIS: Well, that's the one that was sacrificed in Orlando, Fla., so yeah.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHOLMES: All right. Well, we want to know what you think about \"Unfrosted.\" Find us at facebook.com/pchh. That brings us to the end of our show.
