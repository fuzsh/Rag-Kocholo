        "text": "Jerry Seinfeld was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Betty (Hesney) and Kalman Seinfeld. His father was of Hungarian Jewish descent, while Jerry's maternal grandparents, Salha and Selim Hosni, were Syrian Jewish immigrants (from Aleppo). He moved with his family, including sister Carolyn, to suburban Massepequa, Long Island, at a young age. Jerry's dad, who had a terrific sense of humor, was a commercial sign maker.\n\nJerry attended Oswego College in upstate New York however transferred to Queens College back in New York City. Developed an interest in stand-up comedy after brief stints in college productions. Went straight from college graduation to amateur night tryout at New York's Catch a Rising Star, 1976.\n\nContinued to perform in local clubs and Catskill Mountain resorts until his career was boosted by an appearance on a Rodney Dangerfield HBO special, 1976. Career took off after first successful spot on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962), May 1981, at age 27. Appearances on [error] and The Merv Griffin Show (1962) followed. Also appeared four times as Frankie on Benson (1979) sitcom. After he was abruptly fired from the show, he swore never to do another sitcom unless he had greater control. This opportunity emerged when he was invited to create a sitcom for NBC in 1989 and teamed with one-time stand-up colleague Larry David.\n\nProgression of \"The Seinfeld Chronicles\" into the long-running Seinfeld (1989) series phenomenon was ended by its co-creator and co-executive producer, Larry David. Still unmarried, he moved back to New York City into a new multimillion-dollar, multilevel apartment on Central Park West just down the street from his small bachelor studio on West 81st.\n\nElizabeth Stamatina Fey was born in 1970 in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, just west of Philadelphia, to Xenobia \"Jeanne\" (Xenakes), a brokerage employee, and Donald Henry Fey, who wrote grant proposals for universities. Her mother is Greek, born in Piraeus, while her father had German, Northern Irish, and English ancestry. Going by the name of Tina, Fey considered herself a \"supernerd\" during her high school and college years. She studied drama at the University of Virginia, and after graduating in 1992, she headed to Chicago, the ancestral home of American comedy. While working at a YMCA to support herself, she started Second City's first set of courses. After about nine months, a teacher told her to just skip ahead and audition for the more selective Second City Training Center. She failed but about eight weeks later, she re-auditioned and got into the year-long program. She ended up spending many years at The Second City in Chicago where many SNL cast members first started out. Then in 1995, Saturday Night Live (1975) came to The Second City's cast, including Fey's friend, Adam McKay, as a writer, searching for new talent. What they found was Tina Fey. When Adam was made Head writer, he suggested Fey should send a submission packet over the summer with six sketches, 10 pages each. Tina took the advice and sent them. After Lorne Michaels met her and saw her work she was offered a job a week later. She admitted that she was extremely nervous working in the legendary Studio 8H; being a foot shorter than everyone else, younger, and being one of the only female writers at the time. After a few years, Tina made history by becoming the first female head writer in the show's history. Tina also made her screen debut as a featured player during the 25th season by co-anchoring Weekend Update with Jimmy Fallon. Since Tina and Jimmy have taken over Weekend Update it has been considered the best ever. This year she made it to full fledged star by becoming a regular cast member, though she is hardly on the show, besides Update. And during the past two summers, Tina and Rachel Dratch performed their two-woman show to critical acclaim in both Chicago (1999) and New York (2000) and made their Aspen Comedy Festival Debut. Tina is married to Jeff Richmond, a Second City director and lives in New York City.\n\nRenée Kathleen Zellweger was born on April 25, 1969, in Katy, Texas, Her mother, Kjellfrid Irene (Andreassen), is a Norwegian-born former nurse and midwife, of Norwegian, Kven (Finnish), and Swedish descent. Her father, Emil Erich Zellweger, is a Swiss-born engineer. The two married in 1963. Renée has a brother named Drew Zellweger, a marketing executive born on February 15, 1967. Renée got interested in acting in high school while working on the drama club. She also took an acting class at the University of Texas (Austin), where she began looking towards acting as a career. After graduation, she wanted to continue acting, but Hollywood is a tough town to break into, so Renée decided to stay in Texas, and auditioned for roles around Houston, where she managed to grab roles in such films as Reality Bites - Voll das Leben (1994) and Das Empire Team (1995).\n\nWhile on the set for the sequel, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Die Rückkehr (1994), she befriended Matthew McConaughey, another Hollywood up-and-comer. He was working on a project at the time that Renée was interested in, auditioned for, and won the role in the film Love and a .45 (1994), which earned her enough critical praise that she decided to move to Los Angeles. Another role in Alle Liebe dieser Welt (1996) followed which led to her big break. Cameron Crowe was busy casting his next film, Jerry Maguire: Spiel des Lebens (1996),starring Tom Cruise. Crowe was considering such actresses as Cameron Diaz, Bridget Fonda, Winona Ryder, and Marisa Tomei, when he heard of Zellweger's performance in Alle Liebe dieser Welt (1996). He auditioned Zellweger and was sure he'd found his Dorothy Boyd.\n\nRenée followed her huge success with a few small independent films and after receiving further critical praise, she felt confident enough to reenter the world of big-budget Hollywood films. She starred opposite Meryl Streep in the tear-jerker Familiensache (1998). She also took a role in Ich, beide & sie (2000), opposite Jim Carrey, and soon after began dating Carrey. The two denied their relationship at first, but finally gave in and admitted it; today they are no longer together. Also in 2000, she starred in the title role in Nurse Betty (2000), where she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy/Musical. In 2001, she received even more critical and commercial success in the title role in Bridget Jones - Schokolade zum Frühstück (2001). She received her first Academy Award nomination for her role, which was followed by her second Oscar-nominated role in the musical Chicago (2002). She then again wowed audiences with her fierce yet warm portrayal of Ruby Thewes in the film adaptation of Unterwegs nach Cold Mountain (2003), which won Zellweger an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, which was her first Academy Award. She won her second, for Best Actress, 16 years later, playing Judy Garland in Judy (2019).\n\nA slight comic actor chiefly known for his boyish charm, Matthew Broderick was born on March 21, 1962 in New York City, to Patricia Broderick (née Biow), a playwright and painter, and James Broderick, an actor. His father had Irish and English ancestry, and his mother was from a Jewish family (from Germany and Poland).\n\nMatthew initially took up acting at New York's upper-crust Walden School after being sidelined from his athletic pursuits (football and soccer) by a knee injury. His father got him his stage debut at age 17 in a workshop production of the play \"On Valentine's Day\". Matthew's career then accelerated with parts in two Neil Simon projects: the play \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\" (1982-83) and the feature film Max Dugans Moneten (1983). Broderick reprised the role of Eugene in \"Biloxi Blues\" (1988), the second installment of the Simon trilogy, for both the Broadway production and the film adaptation (Biloxi Blues (1988)). For the third and final installment of the trilogy, he was replaced by Jonathan Silverman. In 1983, the same year as Max Dugans Moneten (1983), Broderick had his first big-screen success in the light comedy WarGames: Kriegsspiele (1983). Since then he has had his fair share of hits and misses, with some of his better films including Projekt X (1987) also starring Helen Hunt, whom he subsequently dated; In Sachen Liebe (1997); and Inspektor Gadget (1999). Other films he has appeared in which may be known but not so much respected include Ein Yuppie steht im Wald (1992) with his Ferris macht blau (1986) co-star Jeffrey Jones; Die Nacht mit meinem Traummann (1993); Willkommen in Wellville (1994); and Cable Guy - Die Nervensäge (1996) with Jim Carrey, which got him an MTV \"Best Fight\" award nomination; and the MTV film Election (1999) with Reese Witherspoon. In 1985 he was involved in a controversial car crash while driving in Ireland with his then fiancée Jennifer Grey. The crash killed a woman and her daughter. Broderick paid a small fine to the family of the victims. He broke his leg in the accident, which happened just as Ferris macht blau (1986), his biggest hit, was coming out in the US. The box office success (but critical flop) and special effects blockbuster Godzilla (1998) gave Broderick his first action role (should any \"Godzilla\" sequels be planned, he is under contract for two more). He has occasionally returned to the stage in New York, either in revivals of old musical warhorses such as \"How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying\" or in revivals of old \"show people\"plays, such as \"Night Must Fall\". In 1996 Broderick attempted to wear three hats as co-producer/director/actor in Eine Liebe für die Unendlichkeit (1996), working very closely with his mother, who also wrote the screenplay. It was not a critical or commercial success, and he has not directed or produced since. Since May 1997 he has been married to actress Sarah Jessica Parker. He was previously engaged to both Helen Hunt and dated Lili Taylor. In 1999 he donned a trenchcoat for the children's film Inspektor Gadget (1999), alongside Rupert Everett as the evil villain Claw. In March 2001 Broderick returned to Broadway in the musical smash \"The Producers\" (based on the 1968 Mel Brooks film of the same name). He was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical, which he lost to his co-star, Nathan Lane.\n\nSimon J Smith Personal Bio\n\nSimon J Smith is an award winning writer/director and 30 year computer graphics veteran with over 38 combined years of film, television, and post production experience in telling engaging stories with compelling characters. He is known mostly for his directing feature animation work at PDI/DreamWorks Animation, directing the feature film \"Penguins of Madagascar\" starring Benedict Cumberbatch and John Malkovich, and previously the Golden Globe nominated \"Bee Movie\" starring Jerry Seinfeld and Rene Zellweger.\n\nAfter his DreamWorks tenure he found himself at Unity Technologies writing and directing three real-time short films for Disney.\n\nTitled \"Baymax Dreams\" the shorts delve into mind of the \"Big Hero 6\" character Baymax, and creating a future pipeline using the Unity engine, ask the question \"Do androids dream of electric sheep?\" Well apparently they do.\n\nSimon J Smith won a 2018 Technical Emmy writing and directing \"Baymax Dreams\"\n\nDuring his tenure at PDI/Dreamworks, which he called his home for over 19 years, he created the Layout Pipeline for the second ever computer animated film \"Antz\", and served as Head of Layout (cameraman/cinematographer) for that film, and also for the first ever animated Oscar winning film from PDI/DreamWorks \"Shrek\".\n\nThen he was chosen to start directing projects for DreamWorks which included \"Shrek Imax\" the first stereoscopic 70mm film for DW, the Universal theme park ride \"Shrek 4D\", and short films, including \"Far Far Away idol\" starring Simon Cowell, and \"The Button of Doom\" starring Will Ferrell.\n\nBefore coming to the United States in 1997, Simon was Directing, Editing, Animating or FX Supervising at top London post production houses including The Mill, Framestore, VTR, SVC TV, and ad agency BBDO for 16 years on various projects, commercials, or music videos including Apple, Nike, Honda, Pepsi, VW, Pet Shop Boys, New Order, George Michael, to name but a few.\n\nComedian Darrell Hammond was born in Melbourne, Florida, to Margaret Evelyn (Helms) and Max Carey Hammond. A Saturday Night Live (1975) cast member from 1995 to 2009 - the longest tenure of any SNL cast member - Hammond was one of the sketch TV show's strongest and funniest performers. As well as being part of skits where he had chemistry with other cast members, Hammond won audiences over with dead-on impersonations of various celebrities and Hollywood figures, such as Vice Presidents Dick Cheney and Al Gore, President Bill Clinton, Hardball with Chris Matthews (1997) host Chris Matthews, Sean Connery (who constantly bothered Alex Trebek, played by fellow cast alumni, Will Ferrell, during \"Celebrity Jeopardy\" skits), Regis Philbin, Donald Trump and many more. Despite his shaky movie resume (Der König und ich (1999) and Ein verrückter Tag in New York (2004)), Hammond is still a revelation whenever it comes to SNL.\n\nMore recently known for his ongoing 2011 - 2012 SNL Republican Primary coverage and spot-on portrayal of sometimes - candidate Donald Trump.\n\nIn May 2011 Darrell published his first auto-biography: God If You're Not Up There I'm F*cked: Tales of Stand-Up, Saturday Night Live, and Other Mind-Altering Mayhem. This book tells how a childhood filled with abuse led to his career as a mimic and impersonator extraordinaire."
