        "text": "\"There's always a surprise inside the box...\" Netflix has unveiled the first official trailer for a comedy titled Unfrosted, marking the feature directorial debut of comedian Jerry Seinfeld. Last year there was Air and Flamin' Hot about corporations creating famous new products, this year we have Unfrosted about the origin of the (in)famous Pop-Tart. In a time when milk and cereal ruled breakfast, a fierce corporate battle begins over a revolutionary pastry. Michigan, 1963. Kellogg's and Post, sworn cereal rivals, race to create a pastry that will change the face of breakfast. A tale of ambition, betrayal, sugar, and menacing milkmen - starring and directed by Jerry Seinfeld. The concept is derived from one of Seinfeld's standup bits about Pop Tarts, per the podcast Smartless. The cast also includes Melissa McCarthy, Jim Gaffigan, Hugh Grant, Amy Schumer, Max Greenfield, Christian Slater, Sarah Cooper, Bill Burr, and other special guests. This looks super wacky - more like an SNL sketch turned into a movie, with all kinds of kooky characters. Plays more like a satire making fun of Kellogg's than a wholesome story about the successful \"food\" they invented.\n\nHere's the official trailer (+ poster) for Jerry Seinfeld's film Unfrosted, direct from Netflix's YouTube:"
