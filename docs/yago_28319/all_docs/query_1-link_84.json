        "text": "Syracuse Walk of Stars No. 8: Jerry Seinfeld\n\nWhat if \"Seinfeld\" were still on the air today? What would Jerry Seinfeld and his friends George Costanza, Elaine Benes and Cosmo Kramer do in the modern-day world of social media and smartphones?\n\n(The Associated Press)\n\nThe last episode of \"Seinfeld\" aired 15 years ago, but Jerry Seinfeld has hardly rested easy since his acclaimed sitcom ended on May 14, 1998.\n\nThe 59-year-old comedian still performs standup today -- he's at the Landmark Theatre in Syracuse tonight -- and he's also kept busy with a number of projects over the years. He wrote the animated film \"Bee Movie,\" guest-starred on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" (including Larry David's \"Seinfeld\" reunion), created the short-lived reality show \"The Marriage Ref,\" is working on an \"Album About Nothing\" with rapper Wale, and now stars in his own Emmy-nominated web series called \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.\"\n\nIn fact, the latter nearly got Seinfeld in trouble when he got pulled over in New Jersey for speeding during an episode with Chris Rock. A show that's actually about nothing, \"Comedians...\" also includes guest spots from David Letterman, Sarah Silverman, Don Rickles and Alec Baldwin.\n\nThe lifelong Mets fan also got some attention this week when he told New York's WFAN radio on Wednesday how \"embarrassed\" he was when fans booed rival players during the 2013 MLB All-Star Game at Citi Field.\n\nBut \"Seinfeld\" will forever remain what the former SUNY Oswego student is best known for. As a result, many fans have wondered what the show would be like if Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer were still on the air today.\n\nMany classic episodes would never happen today: Jerry and Elaine wouldn't have gotten lost on their way to see \"The Bubble Boy\" with GPS, George could've used a cell phone number for Vandelay Industries when he claimed he worked there, Kramer would never be Mr. Moviefone in a day where we all look up movie times online, and yada yada yada...\n\nSince just before Festivus last year, Twitter parody account @SeinfeldToday has been posting ideas for \"Modern Seinfeld\" episodes. Some of the ideas are ridiculous (\"Kramer discovers twerking\"), some plots would never happen (Costanza using Spotify?) but all of the tweets make fans sad that the show ended at the height of its success after nine seasons.\n\nIn honor of Jerry's visit to Central New York tonight, here are the 15 best ideas for modern-day \"Seinfeld\" episodes:\n\nIf you go:\n\nWhat: Jerry Seinfeld performs standup comedy\n\nWhere: Landmark Theatre, 362 South Salina Street, Syracuse\n\nWhen: Friday, July 19 at 7 p.m.\n\nTickets: $79, $64, $49 through Ticketmaster or the Landmark box office"
