        "text": "I don’t really know what I was expecting from a Jerry Seinfeld movie about the creation of Pop-Tarts. But I do know I was not expecting the film we’re getting. Netflix’s first trailer for Unfrosted is incredibly silly, surreal, and, most importantly, funnier and better than I could have imagined.\n\nWhen you’re Jerry Seinfeld, you can apparently get as many talented people as you want to make cameos in your absurdist film about an iconic breakfast food. Good for him, but better for us. Unfrosted is LOADED with funny people. It’s also a much funnier way to tell this story than it would have been in someone else’s hands. This could have been another modern-day movie about a company launching a new product. Instead, Unfrosted‘s trailer makes this Pop-Tarts movie look like it’s Air crossed with Anchorman and Weird: The Al Yankovic Story.\n\nWhat’s going on underneath all this delightful ridiculousness? Here’s the Unfrosted‘s official Netflix synopsis to go along with its trailer:\n\nBattle Creek, Michigan, 1963. Kellogg’s and Post, sworn cereal rivals, race to create a pastry that will change the face of breakfast forever. A wildly imaginative tale of ambition, betrayal, and menacing milkmen – sweetened with artificial ingredients – Unfrosted stars Jerry Seinfeld in his directorial film debut.\n\nSeinfeld co-wrote this Pop-Tarts movie with Spike Feresten, Andy Robin, and Barry Marder. Unfrosted‘s historically great cast also includes: Melissa McCarthy, Jim Gaffigan, Hugh Grant, Amy Schumer, Max Greenfield, Christian Slater, Bill Burr, Daniel Levy, James Marsden, Jack McBrayer, Thomas Lennon, Bobby Moynihan, Adrian Martinez, Sarah Cooper, and Fred Armisen. But also Andy Daly, Kyle Mooney, Beck Bennett, Mikey Day, Thomas Lennon, Peter Dinklage, John Slattery, John Hamm, and, somehow, even more people. We get a taste of this incredibly cast in action in Unfrosted‘s trailer, but we can’t wait to see more.\n\nThere’s literally no way the actual story behind Pop-Tarts is anywhere as fun as this movie will be. I probably always should have expected that. (Though, in fairness, who would have guessed anyone would have died creating a shelf-stable pastry.)\n\nUnfrosted pops onto Netflix on May 3."
