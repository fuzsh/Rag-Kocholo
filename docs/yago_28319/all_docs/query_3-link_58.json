        "text": "Jerry Seinfeld is adapting one of his most popular jokes about Pop-Tarts into a new film.\n\nPer Deadline, “Seinfeld will star in, direct and produce ‘Unfrosted,’ a film comedy he co-wrote with Spike Feresten and Barry Marder…Netflix has committed to a green light and a production start next spring.”\n\nSeinfeld told Deadline, “Stuck at home watching endless sad faces on TV, I thought this would be a good time to make something based on pure silliness. So we took my Pop-Tart stand-up bit from my last Netflix special and exploded it into a giant, crazy comedy movie.”\n\nUnfrosted landing at Netflix continues Seinfeld’s relationship with the streaming giant. Netflix is already home to a number of Seinfeld properties, including Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee and two stand-up specials: Jerry Before Seinfeld and 23 Hours to Kill.\n\nOn top of that, Netflix will soon be the streaming home of all 180 episodes of Seinfeld later in 2021. As previously reported, the new global rights deal will last for five years. While the exact worth of the deal wasn’t officially confirmed, The Hollywood Reported noted their sources indicated the five-year deal was worth more than $500 million.\n\nGALLERY: The Cast of ‘Seinfeld’ Through The Years\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
