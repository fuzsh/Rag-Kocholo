        "text": "Jerry Seinfeld will bring his comedy to Memorial Auditorium.\n\n\"It's the best, Jerry, the best!\"\n\nKenny Bania, the doofus comedian from \"Seinfeld,\" probably said it best when it comes to the work of Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian who Comedy Central ranked No. 12 in its list of 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time ? the funny guy who has molded pop culture in recent decades as if it were silly putty.\n\nThanks to \"Seinfeld,\" the world has a whole lexicon of Seinfeldisms, some of which have become actual words used by actual people in actual real-life situations, like \"double-dipper\" ? someone who dunks a chip into some dip, takes a bite, then dips again, thus contaminating the whole dip. There's also \"low-talker,\" someone who doesn't talk very loud, and the famed \"yada yada yada,\" filler words to replace important information that the speaker is purposely glossing over.\n\nWithout \"Seinfeld,\" there would be no Soup Nazi or terms like, \"Not that there's anything wrong with that.\"\n\nSeinfeld will be bringing all that comic genius with him, and some new comic gems, when he stops by Memorial Auditorium Thursday night.\n\nAnd he has plenty of new material to draw from.\n\nSeinfeld these days just wrapped up a project that was close to his heart, \"Bee Movie.\" In fact, the project was so close to his heart that it took him four years to complete the DreamWorks animated film featuring the voices of Renee Zellweger and Matthew Broderick about a worker bee who starts to seek something outside of the hive.\n\nSeinfeld has said he became fascinated with bee life and how they all work together ? an insect factory, if you will, of hard workers.\n\nJerome \"Jerry\" Seinfeld has come a long way since his early stand-up days.\n\nThe Brooklyn native actually grew up in Massapequa, N.Y., and didn't develop an interest in stand-up comedy until he was in college, honing that sense of comedy early on at home, thanks to his very funny dad.\n\nHe started like most comedians do ? taking the stage at an open mic night. His open mic stint was at New York City's Catch a Rising Star in 1976 after he graduated from Queens College.\n\nHis first big break was when he appeared in a Rodney Dangerfield HBO special.\n\nHe would follow that up with a small role on \"Benson\" in 1979 as mail delivery boy Frankie, who had comedy routines that no one wanted to hear. He would be fired from that show.\n\nSeinfeld's career really got rolling when he started getting invited on the late-night talk shows, like \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,\" \"Late Night With David Letterman\" and \"The Merv Griffin Show.\"\n\nOf course, what would make him a comedy icon would be his long-running NBC television show, which he developed in 1989 for Larry David. It would be dubbed \"Seinfeld\" and made its debut that same year.\n\nIt took a while for the show to gain steam, but by its fourth year, it had become a hit.\n\n\"Seinfeld\" would remain a top-rated show for NBC all the way up until 1998, when Jerry Seinfeld thought it was time to end the show, while it was still on top.\n\nSince \"Seinfeld\" ended, he hasn't gone the path of other comedians, which is to become a film star.\n\nHe, instead, got married to his wife, Jessica, when he was in his 40s and started a family and, at 53, is the father to three young children. His wife is known for her cookbook, \"Deceptively Delicious,\" published in 2007, which includes recipes for making healthy food for children and reached No. 1 on The New York Times best-seller list (the book stirred up some controversy, though, when it was alleged that more than a dozen of the same recipes in Seinfeld's book appeared in another author's cookbook published earlier).\n\nBesides the \"Bee Movie,\" Jerry Seinfeld also keeps busy doing what he does best, which is stand-up work. He prefers working in smaller venues, like Memorial Auditorium.\n\nOf course, \"Seinfeld\" is still in syndication and still popular.\n\nIn fact, a massive DVD collection was recently released with all the extras you could imagine.\n\nSeinfeld told Parade magazine that what he thinks has made him successful is that he just hasn't grown up that much.\n\n\"I wouldn't even call myself a full-grown adult until probably my late 30s,\" he told Parade magazine (October 2007). \"What most people are at 25, I don't think I became until I was 38. I think there's a certain naivete that I have, a kind of juvenility that is really one of the keys to comedy.\"\n\nAnd as Bania would say, that juvenility is \"the best, Jerry, the best.\"\n\nJust the facts\n\nWhat: Jerry Seinfeld concert\n\nWhere: Memorial Auditorium\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Thursday\n\nTickets: $46, $61 and $76\n\nInformation: (940) 716-5555 or www.wfmpec.com\n\nSeinfeld quotes\n\n\"My parents didn't want to move to Florida, but they turned 60, and that's the law.\"\n\n\"People who read the tabloids deserve to be lied to.\"\n\n\"Make no mistake about why these babies are here ? they are here to replace us.\"\n\n\"It's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper.\"\n\n\"I am so busy doing nothing ? that the idea of doing anything ? which as you know, always leads to something ? cuts into the nothing ad then forces me to have to drop everything.\"\n\n\"Where lipstick is concerned, the important thing is not color, but to accept God's final word on where your lips end.\"\n\n\"There's very little advice in men's magazines, because men don't think there's a lot they don't know. Women do. Women want to learn. Men think, \"I know what I'm doing, just show me somebody naked.\"\n\n\"Sometimes the road less traveled is less traveled for a reason.\"\n\nSeinfeld sayings\n\nDOUBLE-DIPPER: Someone who inserts chip into a dip, takes a bite, and then re-dips, resulting in dip that has been soiled by the offending dipper's germs.\n\nBAD BREAKER-UPPER: Someone who breaks up with you badly, saying mean things and actually meaning them.\n\nBALDIST: Someone who discriminates against bald people.\n\nCLOSE-TALKER: Someone with no concept of personal space who talks to you while standing way too closely.\n\nFESTIVUS: A December holiday created by Frank Costanza to counteract the commercialism of other December holidays.\n\nLOW-TALKER: Someone who talks very softly.\n\nMOOPS: A typo for \"Moors\" on a Trivial Pursuit card. George uses it to deny the Bubble Boy the win.\n\nMIMBO: A male bimbo. Jerry uses it to describe one of Elaine's boyfriends.\n\nMANSSIERE: A brassiere, but for guys. A term created by Frank Costanza.\n\nSERENITY NOW!: Frank Costanza uses the term as part of his anger management process.\n\nSOUP NAZI: A mean restaurateur who denies clients his wonderful soup if they don't follow his procedures closely for getting the soup.\n\nRE-GIFTER: Someone who takes a present they received and gives it as a present to someone else.\n\nSWEET FANCY MOSES: Exclaimed by Jerry and George when they see how bad Elaine dances."
