        "text": "Jerry Seinfeld’s New Movie About Pop-Tarts Looks Freakin’ Hilarious\n\nThe last news we heard on the Morning Rat Race about Jerry Seinfeld was that he had an estimated net worth of a billion dollars. Well, it looks like the comedy golden boy has struck again because Seinfeld’s new movie looks freaking hilarious. The trailer just dropped, you can see it below. The movie is called, “Unfrosted” and it’s Jerry Seinfeld’s directorial debut. He says that he wrote the story about the creation of the Pop-Tart and the corporate battle between the big cereal companies. But, what may have started as a kind of biopic turned into a laugh riot pretty quickly.\n\nNot surprisingly, Jerry Seinfeld’s new movie is stacked with famous actors and comedians. Joining him on the cast are: Melissa McCarthy, Amy Schumer, Jim Gaffigan, Hugh Grant, Bill Burr, Peter Dinklage, Christian Slater, Dan Levy, James Marsden, Jack McBrayer, Thomas Lennon, Tony McHale, Sebastian Maniscalco, Cedric the Entertainer, Fred Armisen, and the great Jon Hamm.\n\nAccording to Netflix, who has the exclusive rights to the movie’s debut, the script for this Pop-Tart movie was Jerry Seinfeld’s pandemic project. When Covid hit, he and co-writer Spike Feresten got down to business with what had been mostly a running joke between the two of ’em. However, Jerry has been interested in a Pop-Tartesque movie for a long time, even going back to a 2018 tweet:\n\nAccording to interviews that Jerry did about the project, when word got out about the script Hollywood stars began reaching out to him saying that they wanted to be part of the project. One big-time star even did his audition of the phone, supposedly holding a glass of wine as he did the voice of Tony The Tiger.\n\nWith Seinfeld you can never be quite sure if you’ll get something real. I mean, his show “about nothing” gave us plenty of things to laugh about (until that final episode, that left me flat. You too?) Jerry Seinfeld’s new movie may be based on the real-life story of the invention of the Pop-Tart but it went way off where the buses don’t go in terms of fun.\n\nEnjoy the trailer, I did! The movie debuts on Netflix on May 3rd.\n\n15 ‘Seinfeld’-isms We Now Use in Everyday Life\n\nWhen Carl is not working at the greatest rock radio station known to mankind; a station known around the globe; a station that has the best music, co-workers, advertisers and most importantly THE BEST F'N LISTENERS you may find me doing any one of the following: Riding or making mountain bike trails. playing with his kids. playing sand volleyball on 5th Ave, cooking amazing food, including on his sweet smoker grill, going to concerts, swimming in the ocean, going to amusement parks with his kids, and other stuff that rocks!"
