        "text": "Netflix has released the trailer for Jerry Seinfeld‘s upcoming Pop-Tart movie, “Unfrosted,” set for release on May 3.\n\nPer Netflix’s Tudum, the logline for “Unfrosted” reads, “Michigan, 1963. Kellogg’s and Post, sworn cereal rivals, race to create a pastry that will change the face of breakfast forever. A tale of ambition, betrayal, sugar, and menacing milkmen, ‘Unfrosted’ stars writer-director Jerry Seinfeld.”\n\nAs Tudum acknowledges on the official “Unfrosted” page, Seinfeld has been contemplating the Pop-Tart origin story for years. For example, he made his artistic vision clear in a 2018 post on X/Twitter: “At one point I was thinking about an invention of the Pop Tart movie. Imagine the drunk on sugar-power Kellogg’s cereal culture of the mid-60’s in Battle Creek, MI. That’s a vibe I could work with.” He also brought up the idea on “The Late Show” in 2010.\n\nIn addition to Seinfeld, the A-list cast features plenty more comedic icons, including Melissa McCarthy, Jim Gaffigan, Amy Schumer, Hugh Grant, Max Greenfield, Christian Slater, Bill Burr, Daniel Levy, James Marsden, Jack McBrayer, Thomas Lennon, Bobby Moynihan, Adrian Martinez, Sarah Cooper and Fred Armisen.\n\nSeinfeld penned the script with Spike Feresten, Barry Marder and Andy Robin. Seinfeld and Feresten also produce in addition to Beau Beauman, under their Columbia 81 Productions banner. “Unfrosted” is Seinfeld’s feature directorial debut.\n\nBefore bringing his Pop-Tart dreams to Netflix, Seinfeld most recently starred in a 2020 stand-up comedy special for the streamer, “23 Hours to Kill.”\n\nWatch the trailer for “Unfrosted” below."
