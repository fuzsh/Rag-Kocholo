        "text": "Want to republish a Modern Farmer story?\n\nWe are happy for Modern Farmer stories to be shared, and encourage you to republish our articles for your audience. When doing so, we ask that you follow these guidelines:\n\nPlease credit us and our writers\n\nFor the author byline, please use “Author Name, Modern Farmer.” At the top of our stories, if on the web, please include this text and link: “This story was originally published by Modern Farmer.”\n\nPlease make sure to include a link back to either our home page or the article URL.\n\nAt the bottom of the story, please include the following text:\n\n“Modern Farmer is a nonprofit initiative dedicated to raising awareness and catalyzing action at the intersection of food, agriculture, and society. Read more at <link>Modern Farmer</link>.”\n\nUse our widget\n\nWe’d like to be able to track our stories, so we ask that if you republish our content, you do so using our widget (located on the left hand side of the article). The HTML code has a built-in tracker that tells us the data and domain where the story was published, as well as view counts.\n\nCheck the image requirements\n\nIt’s your responsibility to confirm you're licensed to republish images in our articles. Some images, such as those from commercial providers, don't allow their images to be republished without permission or payment. Copyright terms are generally listed in the image caption and attribution. You are welcome to omit our images or substitute with your own. Charts and interactive graphics follow the same rules.\n\nDon’t change too much. Or, ask us first.\n\nArticles must be republished in their entirety. It’s okay to change references to time (“today” to “yesterday”) or location (“Iowa City, IA” to “here”). But please keep everything else the same.\n\nIf you feel strongly that a more material edit needs to be made, get in touch with us at [email protected]. We’re happy to discuss it with the original author, but we must have prior approval for changes before publication.\n\nSpecial cases\n\nExtracts. You may run the first few lines or paragraphs of the article and then say: “Read the full article at Modern Farmer” with a link back to the original article.\n\nQuotes. You may quote authors provided you include a link back to the article URL.\n\nTranslations. These require writer approval. To inquire about translation of a Modern Farmer article, contact us at [email protected]\n\nSigned consent / copyright release forms. These are not required, provided you are following these guidelines.\n\nPrint. Articles can be republished in print under these same rules, with the exception that you do not need to include the links.\n\nTag us\n\nWhen sharing the story on social media, please tag us using the following: - Twitter (@ModFarm) - Facebook (@ModernFarmerMedia) - Instagram (@modfarm)\n\nUse our content respectfully\n\nModern Farmer is a nonprofit and as such we share our content for free and in good faith in order to reach new audiences. Respectfully,\n\nNo selling ads against our stories. It’s okay to put our stories on pages with ads.\n\nDon’t republish our material wholesale, or automatically; you need to select stories to be republished individually.\n\nYou have no rights to sell, license, syndicate, or otherwise represent yourself as the authorized owner of our material to any third parties. This means that you cannot actively publish or submit our work for syndication to third party platforms or apps like Apple News or Google News. We understand that publishers cannot fully control when certain third parties automatically summarize or crawl content from publishers’ own sites.\n\nKeep in touch\n\nWe want to hear from you if you love Modern Farmer content, have a collaboration idea, or anything else to share. As a nonprofit outlet, we work in service of our community and are always open to comments, feedback, and ideas. Contact us at"
