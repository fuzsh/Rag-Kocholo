        "text": "Bee Movie is a 2007 CGI-animated film starring Jerry Seinfeld, Renée Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, Megan Mullally, John Goodman, Chris Rock, Kathy Bates, and Patrick Warburton. Produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Universal Pictures, it is directed by Simon J. Smith and Steve Hickner. Its title is a play on the term \"B movie\".\n\nLines\n\n[edit]\n\nNarrator\n\n[edit]\n\n[first lines] According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.\n\nBarry B. Benson\n\n[edit]\n\n[first actual line spoken in-universe] Yellow black, Yellow black, Yellow black, Yellow black, ooh, black and yellow, yeah, let’s shake it up a little!\n\n[About Ray Liotta] This isn’t a goodfella! This is a BAD fella!\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nBarry: 3 days of grade school, 3 days of high school...\n\nAdam: Those were so awkward.\n\nBarry: 3 days of college... I'm glad I took that one day off in the middle and just hiked around the hive.\n\nAdam: You did come back different.\n\nBuzzwell: Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of [beat, changes time] 9:15! And that concludes our graduation ceremonies...\n\nBarry: Yay!\n\nBuzzwell: ...and begins your career at Honex Industries!\n\nAdam: Hey, did you hear about Frankie?\n\nBarry: Yeah.\n\nAdam: You going to his funeral?\n\nBarry: No, I'm not going to his funeral. Everybody knows you sting someone, you die. You don't waste it on a squirrel. He was such a hothead.\n\nAdam: Yeah, I guess he could've just gotten out of the way.\n\nMartin: Our son, the stirrer.\n\nJanet: [extremely happy] You're gonna be a stirrer?\n\nBarry: Nobody's listening to me!\n\nMartin: Wait'll you see the sticks I have for you.\n\nBarry: I can say anything I want right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!\n\nJanet: [ignores Barry] Let's open up some fresh honey and celebrate!\n\nBarry: Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack it up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth, and start calling everybody \"dawg\"!\n\nMartin: We're still here, Barry.\n\nJanet: I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't have responsibility when you yell at him.\n\nMartin: Then why are you yelling at me?\n\nJanet: Because you don't listen!\n\nMartin: Argh, I'm not listening to this.\n\nVanessa: My only interest is flowers.\n\nBarry: Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.\n\nVanessa: Listen, you'd better go because we're really busy working.\n\nKen: But it's our yogurt night!\n\nVanessa: Oh, bye-bye. [ushers Ken out of the shop]\n\nKen: WHY IS YOGURT NIGHT SO DIFFICULT?!!\n\nVanessa: Oh, you poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!\n\nBarry: [sarcastically] Yes, and Adam here has a been a huge help. [Adam asleep in an empty Cinnabon box]\n\nMr. Montgomery: Mr. Benson Bee, I'm going to ask what I think the entire court here would like to know... what exactly is your relationship to that woman? [Vanessa gasps]\n\nBarry: We're friends.\n\nMr. Montgomery: Good friends?\n\nBarry: Yes.\n\nMr. Montgomery: How good?\n\nBarry: Now, hang on--\n\nMr. Montgomery: Do you live together?\n\nBarry: Wait, that's not--\n\nMr. Montgomery: Are you her little... bedbug?\n\nMr. Montgomery: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the county of nature God put before us. If we were to live the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what if would mean? Maybe I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know he could be on steroids!\n\nBarry: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. And as a bee, honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it, we make it, and we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take whatever they want from us, 'cause we're the little guys! And what I'm hoping is that after this is all over, you'll see how by taking our honey, you're not only taking away everything we have, but everything we are!\n\nVanessa: It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!\n\nBarry: It's not a tone. I'm panicking!\n\nBarry: So what do you say, are we gonna be bees or just Museum of Natural History keychains?\n\nBees: We're bees!\n\nRandom bee: Keychain!\n\nBarry: Then everyone follow me... except Keychain!\n\nPollen Jock: Hold on Barry, you earned this. [places a pollen jock jacket on Barry and the 3 pollen jocks cheer while Vanessa gives him a thumbs up]\n\nBarry: I'm a pollen jock, and its a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves! [the pollen jocks toss Barry a nectar pack]\n\nAdam: Nice.\n\nJanet: [proudly] That's our Barry! [Martin nods proudly in agreement]\n\nBarry: How about a suicide pact?\n\nVanessa: How would we do it?\n\nBarry: I'll sting you, you step on me.\n\nVanessa: That just kills you twice.\n\n[Barry is interviewing a giraffe]\n\nGiraffe: Action figures, dolls, video games! It's all me! And they put my picture on every toy store! Everybody knows my kind are plant eaters, but I'd rather live on ants!\n\nBarry: I have no idea.\n\nGiraffe: You're not another lawyer too, are you?\n\nMooseblood: Sir, I was already a bloodsucking parasite. [shows the giraffe his briefcase] All I needed was a briefcase.\n\nKen: OHHH!!! THAT BEE IS LIVING MY LIFE!\n\nAndy: Let it go, Kenny. Let it all go.\n\nKen: WHEN WILL THIS NIGHTMARE END?!\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nVoice Cast\n\n[edit]\n\nJerry Seinfeld as Barry B.

Unlike the final movie where Adam and Barry were driving, they are instead walking across the street]\n\nAdam: Too bad about Frankie, huh? You going to his funeral?\n\nBarry: No, I'm not going to his funeral. Everybody knows you sting someone, you die. You don't waste it on a squirrel. He was such a hothead.\n\nJerry Seinfeld: Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, and I'm making a movie about bees. In my movie, bees talk, they drive cars, they watch television. [voice-over] And they work very very hard making lots and lots of honey.\n\n[Another test animation is presented]\n\nBarry: [while flying] Hey, I see a giant patch of flowers! Jackpot!\n\nSeinfeld: [voice-over] But our story really takes off when Barry does the one thing a bee is never ever supposed to do. Talk to humans.\n\nBarry: Hi. [Vanessa gasps in shock and drops her dishes] I'm sorry.\n\nVanessa: [spooked] You're talking.\n\nBarry: Yes, I know.\n\nVanessa: You're a bee!\n\nSeinfeld: [voice-over] Anyway, there's lots of other funny bees and funny humans in the story, and we all have a great time. [on-screen] This is a world I can't wait to tell you about. [Puts on bee antennas]\n\nNarrator: Bee Movie. Coming November 2007.\n\nBarry: November? [walks left across the movie title] I have to wait 'til November 2007?\n\nNarrator: Yes, you do.\n\nBarry: Oh, that is brutal!
