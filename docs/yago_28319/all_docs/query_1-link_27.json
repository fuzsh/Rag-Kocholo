        "text": "Renée Kathleen Zellweger was born on April 25, 1969, in Katy, Texas, Her mother, Kjellfrid Irene (Andreassen), is a Norwegian-born former nurse and midwife, of Norwegian, Kven (Finnish), and Swedish descent. Her father, Emil Erich Zellweger, is a Swiss-born engineer. The two married in 1963. Renée has a brother named Drew Zellweger, a marketing executive born on February 15, 1967. Renée got interested in acting in high school while working on the drama club. She also took an acting class at the University of Texas (Austin), where she began looking towards acting as a career. After graduation, she wanted to continue acting, but Hollywood is a tough town to break into, so Renée decided to stay in Texas, and auditioned for roles around Houston, where she managed to grab roles in such films as Reality Bites - Voll das Leben (1994) and Das Empire Team (1995).\n\nWhile on the set for the sequel, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Die Rückkehr (1994), she befriended Matthew McConaughey, another Hollywood up-and-comer. He was working on a project at the time that Renée was interested in, auditioned for, and won the role in the film Love and a .45 (1994), which earned her enough critical praise that she decided to move to Los Angeles. Another role in Alle Liebe dieser Welt (1996) followed which led to her big break. Cameron Crowe was busy casting his next film, Jerry Maguire: Spiel des Lebens (1996),starring Tom Cruise. Crowe was considering such actresses as Cameron Diaz, Bridget Fonda, Winona Ryder, and Marisa Tomei, when he heard of Zellweger's performance in Alle Liebe dieser Welt (1996). He auditioned Zellweger and was sure he'd found his Dorothy Boyd.\n\nRenée followed her huge success with a few small independent films and after receiving further critical praise, she felt confident enough to reenter the world of big-budget Hollywood films. She starred opposite Meryl Streep in the tear-jerker Familiensache (1998). She also took a role in Ich, beide & sie (2000), opposite Jim Carrey, and soon after began dating Carrey. The two denied their relationship at first, but finally gave in and admitted it; today they are no longer together. Also in 2000, she starred in the title role in Nurse Betty (2000), where she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy/Musical. In 2001, she received even more critical and commercial success in the title role in Bridget Jones - Schokolade zum Frühstück (2001). She received her first Academy Award nomination for her role, which was followed by her second Oscar-nominated role in the musical Chicago (2002). She then again wowed audiences with her fierce yet warm portrayal of Ruby Thewes in the film adaptation of Unterwegs nach Cold Mountain (2003), which won Zellweger an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, which was her first Academy Award. She won her second, for Best Actress, 16 years later, playing Judy Garland in Judy (2019).\n\nPatrick Warburton is known to many for the role of \"Puddy\" in the hit NBC comedy \"Seinfeld,\" the laconic, enigmatic, quirky Saab salesman and Elaine's boyfriend. Warburton starred for 7 seasons on the hit CBS comedy \"Rules of Engagement\" with David Spade, Oliver Hudson, and Megyn Price about two couples and their single friend, all at different stages in their relationships dealing with the complications of dating, commitment, and marriage. He is now set to star in NBC's newest sitcom series entitled \"Crowded,\" premiering Sunday, March 20th, about an empty nest couple (Warburton & Carrie Preston) who find out their adult daughters want to move back home with them. Patrick also played \"Guy\" in the international blockbuster comedy Ted and recently completed shooting the highly anticipated sequel Ted 2 where he reprises his role. Warburton starred on the ABC hit comedy \"Less than Perfect,\" as \"Jeb Denton,\" an opinionated network anchorman; and on the hit show \"NewsRadio\" as \"Johnny Johnson\" the unscrupulous business rival who takes over the station. Warburton starred in Disney's major motion picture, live action comedy Underdog, as the archenemy \"Cad,\" based on the 1964 cartoon television series. He is also perhaps the busiest voiceover artist in Hollywood for his many characters including the role of the paraplegic and over-zealous cop, \"Joe Swanson,\" on the hit comedy \"Family Guy.\"\n\nWarburton was the lead in the independent film The Civilization of Maxwell Bright, in which he stared as a vicious and self-destructive anti-hero who desperately needs to save his soul. The film won numerous festival awards in which Warburton captured Best Actor at the Beverly Hills Film Festival, New York VisionFest, and the Boulder International Film Festival. The film's other honors include Viewer's Choice at the Beverly Hills Film Festival, the Special Jury Award at WorldFest Houston and at the Florida Film Festival, Grand Jury Prize at the Florida Film Festival, and the Vision Award for David Beaird at WorldFest Houston. This festival favorite is essentially a modern re-telling of \"Beauty and the Beast\" that explores what happens when a modern Neanderthal is locked in close proximity with a kind and loving woman. Written and directed by David Beaird, The Civilization of Maxwell Bright co-stars Jennifer Tilly, Marie Matiko, Simon Callow and Eric Roberts. In addition, Warburton starred in the independent feature film I'll Believe You alongside Fred Willard, Thomas Gibson, and Chris Elliott, a comedy for young adults/teens about a hunt for an alleged alien living in a small town after a mysterious phone call is received on a radio broadcast. The film was released in April of 2007 to 1,500 theaters nationwide, quite the accomplishment for a small independent film.\n\nTo complement his animated films, Warburton voiced the hit cartoon series \"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated\" and the animated feature Bee Movie with Jerry Seinfeld, Renée Zellweger, Uma Thurman and Oprah Winfrey. He played the character \"Rip Smashenburn\" in the UPN animated series \"Game Over,\" the voice of \"Brock Samson\" in the animated adult series \"The Venture Brothers,\" and the voice of \"Mr. Barkin\" on the Disney Channel's \"Disney's Kim Possible.\" He plays the character of Ian, \"the ultimate alpha-male,\" in the Sony animated film Open Season opposite Ashton Kutcher and Martin Lawrence. Playing in both regular theaters and Imax 3-D, it was a box office smash on its opening week as #1 and held top spots following its debut. Warburton's voice can also be heard alongside that of Sarah Michelle Geller, Sigourney Weaver, George Carlin, Andy Dick, and Freddie Prinze Jr. in the animated feature film Happily N'ever After, from the producers of Shrek, where he plays the voice of \"Prince Humperdink.\" As the voice of the \"Savior of the Universe\" in Disney's animated Saturday morning TV series \"Buzz Lightyear,\" Warburton's voice graced the big screen in the Disney animated film The Emperor's New Groove, Kronks New Groove and \"The Emperor's New School.\"\n\nWarburton started his television career appearing regularly on the CBS sitcom \"Dave's World,\" with Harry Anderson and Mesach Taylor and originally guest-starred on \"Seinfeld\" as the painted-faced New Jersey Devils' fan and Jerry's mechanic, only to become one of the show's funniest fixtures. He also did commercial spots for American Express (as the voice of \"Superman\" alongside Seinfeld), Cadillac, and M&Ms. Warburton starred in The Woman Chaser, which received critical acclaim at the prestigious New York Film Festival and The Sundance Film Festival, as well as opposite Sam Neill in The Dish, an Australian production about the first man on the moon. Barry Sonnenfeld directed Warburton in the Columbia Tri Star half-hour comedy \"The Tick,\" which continues to have a huge cult following since its release on DVD. The show gained its popularity with audiences due to its relaxed, adult-friendly comedy. \"The Tick\", in addition to the DVD, has released action figures, t-shirts, and Quaker Oat Life cereal boxes with \"The Tick\" character adorning the cover. He also paired up with Tim Allen in Sonnenfeld's feature films Big Trouble and Joe Somebody, and also appeared in Scream 3 and Men in Black 2.\n\nA native Californian, Patrick grew up in Huntington Beach and resides in Ventura County with his wife Cathy and four children Talon, Alexandra (Lexie), Shane, and Gabriel. When talking about his children, Patrick's face lights up as he describes them as the ultimate joy and love of his life. With what little spare time he has, Patrick gets in a game of golf or tennis, does activities with his children, and spends time in his cabin on the Rogue River in Oregon with his family. Warburton also hosts the annual charity golf tournament The Warburton a Celebrity Tournament to benefit St. Jude Children's Hospital each year in Palm Springs, CA.\n\nRip Torn was born Elmore Rual Torn Jr. on February 6, 1931 in Temple, Texas, the son of Thelma Mary (Spacek) and Elmore Rudolph Torn, who was an agriculturalist and economist, credited with popularizing the custom of eating black-eyed peas on New Year's Day. \"Rip\" is a family name, taken by generations of Torn men and bestowed on Elmore by his father, who was also called \"Rip.\" He was of German, Austrian, Bohemian, and Moravian descent. His mother was an elder sister of actress Sissy Spacek's father, Edwin Spacek.\n\nTorn attended Texas A&M and the University of Texas, where he joined Sigma Chi Fraternity. He majored in animal husbandry. Extremely naïve when he was young, Torn hitchhiked to Hollywood with the idea of becoming a movie star; he wanted to make enough money in order to buy a ranch. Success did not come overnight, as he had hoped, and Torn had to work many odd jobs while occasionally being cast in television roles. He made his feature film debut in Elia Kazan's Baby Doll - Begehre nicht des anderen Weib (1956) in a small part.\n\nSerious about learning his craft, he moved to New York City where he studied under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Torn also studied dance with Martha Graham. His serious acting career began on the small screen, where he made a name for himself in the Golden Age of Television; between 1957 and 1960, he appeared regularly on such prestigious live shows as Omnibus (1952) and Playhouse 90 (1956).\n\nTorn made his Broadway debut in Kazan's staging of Tennessee Williams' \"Sweet Bird of Youth\" on March 10, 1959, in support of Paul Newman, Sidney Blackmer and Geraldine Page, who would become his second wife. The play was a hit, closing on January 30, 1960 after 375 performances. He won a 1960 Tony Award nomination as Best Featured Actor in a Play and a Theater World award for his role as \"Tom, Jr.\", a role he recreated in the 1962 film. (Torn also starred as \"Boss Finley\" in a later television adaptation of the play).\n\nTorn earned a reputation as an actor's actor on stage, both Broadway and off-Broadway, as well as on screen. He continued to work in the New York theater despite his demanding TV and movie schedule as both an actor and director. He won two Obie awards for his work off-Broadway, for Distinguished Performance in Norman Mailer's \"The Deer Park\" (for the 1966-67 season), and for Distinguished Direction for \"The Beard\" (1967-68). He had his own stage company, and directed his daughter Angelica Page (by Geraldine Page) in John Paul Alexander's \"Strangers in the Land of Canaan\" at the Actors Studio. Torn made his feature film directorial debut with Telefon Terror (1988).\n\nHe was constantly in demand as a character actor, in supporting, second lead and occasional lead roles. Arguably his best performance on film came in Zahltag (1973), and he was nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar for Cross Creek - Ich kämpfe um meine Freiheit (1983). Most of Torn's roles were in drama, though he was adept at comedy. His role in Albert Brooks' comedy Rendezvous im Jenseits (1991) led to his being cast in Die Larry Sanders Show (1992), on which he played talk show producer \"Artie.\" Torn won six consecutive Emmy nominations for the role, winning once for Best Supporting Actor in a comedy series in 1996.\n\nTorn was married to actress Ann Wedgeworth from 1956-61, whom he divorced to marry Geraldine Page. They remained married until her death in 1987. He was married to Amy Wright until his death. Torn helped his first cousin, Oscar-winner Sissy Spacek, to make her way as an actress, seeing to it that she was accepted by the Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio and then the Lee Strasberg Institute.\n\nRip Torn died in on July 9, 2019 in Lakeville, Connecticut, aged 88.\n\nSpike Feresten was raised in West Bridgewater, MA, where he attended public school and got his first job as a bag boy at the local supermarket. With a dream to be the next Jimi Hendrix, Feresten attended Berklee College of Music in Boston. One night, disillusioned with his career choice, Feresten thought he might feel better if he dropped four-foot fluorescent light bulbs out the window of his dorm room - just to watch them shatter on the sidewalk eight stories below. He got caught and was evicted. Soon after, Feresten saw David Letterman performing the exact same stunt on his late-night talk show, and a real light bulb went on: If network television encouraged this sort of behavior, he might have a future after all. Thus, a career in TV comedy was born. Feresten came up through the ranks of television, working first as an intern at NBC in New York. His career took on a Hollywood fable quality when his job as the receptionist for \"Saturday Night Live\" led him to pass jokes he had written to \"Weekend Update's\" Dennis Miller. Eventually, Feresten's full-time job at SNL led to a staff-writing position in 1990 at \"Late Night with David Letterman,\" where he wrote for five years and earned five Emmy nominations. In 1995, Feresten left the late-night realm to join the writing staff of the groundbreaking sitcom \"Seinfeld,\" where he wrote for three seasons, becoming supervising producer in 1998. During his \"Seinfeld\" tenure, Feresten garnered an additional three Emmy nominations, including one for his famed \"Soup Nazi\" episode, which remains part of the pop-culture vernacular. In 2006 FOX selected Feresten to host his own Late Night series, Talkshow with Spike Feresten which Feresten also executive produced and co-wrote. Several of the show's many viral videos made HULU's all-time most viewed list beating out Family Guy and Tina Fey's Sarah Palin sketches. In addition to \"Seinfeld\" and \"Letterman,\" Feresten has written and developed other television comedy, penning episodes of The Simpsons, \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" and \"The Jamie Kennedy Experiment.\" Continuing to work with Jerry Seinfeld, Feresten co-wrote the screenplay for the animated feature \"Beemovie,\" and the 2012 Acura NSX Superbowl Commercial. In October 2014 he launched his new cars and comedy show Car Matchmaker with Spike Feresten on the Esquire Network. Feresten also co-wrote and produced the 2024 Netflix feature film Unfrosted: The Pop Tart Story starring Jerry Seinfeld and hosts one of the top automotive / comedy podcasts in the world, Spike Car Radio.\n\nBorn in Santa Ana, California in 1970, Jason Lee is an American film photographer, actor, producer, and director. Well known for having been a professional skateboarder during skateboarding's very pivotal late 80s and early 90s, Lee would go on to pursue acting in 1993, working in film, television, and voiceover, and with such directors as Kevin Smith, Cameron Crowe, Lawrence Kasdan, and Brad Bird.\n\nRetiring from skateboarding in 1995, Lee has maintained solid ties to the industry, most notably through his partnership with longtime friend and fellow ex-professional skateboarder, Chris Pastras, and their now 25-year-old skate brand, Stereo Skateboards, which Lee co-manages with Pastras.\n\nIn 2002, Lee developed a passion for film photography and has been an active photographer and film advocate ever since, having had his work both published and exhibited throughout the years. In October 2016, Lee published a selection of small and large format Polaroid and Fuji instant film photographs spanning a decade as a special limited hardbound issue of Fort Worth-based Refueled Magazine. Just 500 sold-out signed and numbered copies were produced, with three of those copies now living in the libraries of the SFMOMA, Amon Carter, and Philbrook museums. Lee's next publication, to be released in 2017, will be a book comprised of large format color film photographs made throughout Texas.\n\nLee is also the subject of a 2018 documentary from director Greg Hunt that will take the viewer on the road with him as he exposes his remaining boxes of now-expired 8x10 Polaroid film, a favorite medium of Lee's and one that is no longer being produced. An accompanying book of the large format Polaroids will be published, with the originals being exhibited. Additionally in 2018, Lee will be publishing and exhibiting selections of B&W film photographs from the past 10 years, with the collection's focus primarily on the West Coast and Southwest.\n\nLee has also produced and directed music videos for Beck and the band Midlake, a short documentary and live concert film featuring Midlake, two Stereo Skateboards films, and a previously unreleased 2006 short film starring Giovanni Ribisi and Beth Riesgraf, which will have its online debut in 2017.\n\n'Acting has been a lot of fun, and I've liked that I've been able to bounce around a bit, and that I was able to make some movies for my kids, do some dramas, play 'Earl,' work with Pixar... It's a fun gig. And I enjoy being a part of that bigger process. But just as with skateboarding, photography is much more uniquely personal, and more of an independent endeavor. Very fulfilling. I look forward to continuing to work as an actor, as I do maintaining my ties to skateboarding and having Stereo as the outlet that it's been for me for over two decades now, and perhaps directing more projects, but photography will remain my primary creative focus as it has been for the past 15 years.'\n\nLee can be followed on Instagram at @jasonlee, @stereoskateboards, and @filmphotographic, an Instagram film community gallery and resource page founded by Lee in 2015.\n\nA masculine and enigmatic actor whose life and movie career have had more ups and downs than the average rollercoaster and whose selection of roles has arguably derailed him from achieving true superstar status, James Caan is New York-born and bred.\n\nHe was born in the Bronx, to Sophie (Falkenstein) and Arthur Caan, Jewish immigrants from Germany. His father was a meat dealer and butcher. The athletically gifted Caan played football at Michigan State University while studying economics, holds a black belt in karate and for several years was even a regular on the rodeo circuit, where he was nicknamed \"The Jewish Cowboy\". However, while studying at Hofstra University, he became intrigued by acting and was interviewed and accepted at Sanford Meisner's Neighborhood Playhouse. He then won a scholarship to study under acting coach Wynn Handman and began to appear in several off-Broadway productions, including \"I Roam\" and \"Mandingo\".\n\nHe made his screen debut as a sailor in Das Mädchen Irma la Douce (1963) and began to impress audiences with his work in Rote Linie 7000 (1965) and the western El Dorado (1966) alongside John Wayne and Robert Mitchum. Further work followed in Journey to Shiloh (1968) and in the sensitive Liebe niemals einen Fremden (1969). However, audiences were moved to tears as he put in a heart-rending performance as cancer-stricken Chicago Bears running back Brian Piccolo in the highly rated made-for-TV film Freunde bis in den Tod (1971).\n\nWith these strong performances under his belt, Francis Ford Coppola then cast him as hot-tempered gangster Santino \"Sonny\" Corleone in the Mafia epic Der Pate (1972). The film was an enormous success, Caan scored a Best Supporting Actor nomination and, in the years since, the role has proven to be the one most fondly remembered by his legion of fans. He reprised the role for several flashback scenes in the sequel Der Pate 2 (1974) and then moved on to several very diverse projects. These included a cop-buddy crime partnership with Alan Arkin in the uneven Der Superschnüffler (1974), a superb performance as a man playing for his life in Spieler ohne Skrupel (1974) alongside Lauren Hutton, and pairing with Barbra Streisand in Funny Lady (1975). Two further strong lead roles came up for him in 1975, first as futuristic sports star \"Jonathon E\" questioning the moral fiber of a sterile society in Rollerball (1975) and teaming up with Robert Duvall in the Sam Peckinpah spy thriller Die Killer-Elite (1975).\n\nUnfortunately, Caan's rising star sputtered badly at this stage of his career, and several film projects failed to find fire with either critics or audiences. These included such failures as the hokey Und Morgen wird ein Ding Gedreht (1976), the quasi-western Eine Farm in Montana (1978) and the saccharine Das zweite Kapitel (1979). However, he did score again with the stylish Michael Mann-directed heist movie Der Einzelgänger (1981). He followed this with a supernatural romantic comedy titled Liebesgrüße aus dem Jenseits (1982) and then, due to personal conflicts, dropped out of the spotlight for several years before returning with a stellar performance under old friend Francis Ford Coppola in the moving Der Steinerne Garten (1987).\n\nCaan appeared back in favor with fans and critics alike and raised his visibility with the sci-fi hit Spacecop L.A. 1991 (1988) and Dick Tracy (1990), then surprised everyone by playing a meek romance novelist held captive after a car accident by a deranged fan in the dynamic Misery (1990). The 1990s were kind to him and he notched up roles as a band leader in For the Boys - Tage des Ruhms, Tage der Liebe (1991), another gangster in ...aber nicht mit meiner Braut - Honeymoon in Vegas (1992), appeared in the indie hit Durchgeknallt (1996) and pursued Arnold Schwarzenegger in Eraser (1996).\n\nThe demand on Caan's talents seems to have increased steadily over the past few years as he is making himself known to a new generation of fans. Recent hot onscreen roles have included The Yards - Im Hinterhof der Macht (2000), City of Ghosts (2002) and Dogville (2003). In addition, he finds himself at the helm of the hit TV series Las Vegas (2003) as casino security chief \"Big Ed\" Deline. An actor of undeniably manly appeal, James Caan continued to surprise and delight audiences with his invigorating performances up until his death in July 2022 at the age of 82.\n\nImmortalized as Cosmo Kramer on the classic sitcom Seinfeld (1989), West Coast comedy star Michael Richards was born on July 24, 1949, and raised in South Los Angeles, California, to Phyllis (Nardozzi), an Italian-American medical records librarian, and William Richards, an electrical engineer. Michael displayed an early talent for performance as a top Forensic League competitor during grade school. He went on to star in multiple high school and college productions while working as an ambulance attendant and hospital orderly. Michael trained as a medic in the US Army during the Vietnam War, was appointed writer and director of plays on drug abuse and race relations for the Army's V-Corp Training Roadshow. He attended the California Institute of the Arts and was mentored by famed performance art guru Allan Kaprow. He graduated from Evergreen State College in Washington with his BFA in drama.\n\nAfter first performing with the San Diego Repertory Company, he subsequently returned to L.A. where he was discovered by Budd Friedman, founder of the Improv comedy club and talent manager Charles H. Joffe. Also a trained theater actor under the tutelage of Stella Adler, Michael starred in regional productions, Off-Broadway, and in London's West End. In addition to his comedic roles, Michael performed regularly in comedy clubs during the late 1970s and 1980s while driving a school bus by day.\n\nInspired by the physical comedy of such legends as Charles Chaplin and Jacques Tati, he paid his dues on the comedy circuit until comedian Billy Crystal noticed him and gave him a break on one of his comedy specials. Michael earned a regular spot on the sketch comedy series Fridays (1980), where he created the character of Battle Boy who liked to blow up army soldiers. He also appeared in such minor slapstick films such as Küss mich, Doc (1982) and Transylvania 6-5000 (1985).\n\nMichael worked regularly as a dramatic \"heavy\" in television throughout the 1980s in shows such as \"Miami Vice,\" \"St. Elsewhere,\" and \"Hill Street Blues.\" Following a recurring role on the offbeat comedy series Marblehead Manor (1987), everything finally came together for the elastic-faced comedian in 1989, after being cast as Cosmo Kramer, Jerry Seinfeld's wired, convulsive, frizzy-mopped neighbor and pal on Seinfeld (1989). The frenzied character earned him three Emmy awards, SAG awards, and instant cult status. He followed this success with his own short-lived series, the comedy mystery as a private investigator in The Michael Richards Show (2000) and the role of Micawber in a TV version of David Copperfield (2000).\n\nSubsequent film credits include the cult classic UHF - Sender mit beschränkter Hoffnung (1989), So ein Satansbraten (1990), Airheads (1994), Entfesselte Helden (1995) and Noch dümmer (1997), a top-billed comedy role. TV work into the millennium has been very sporadic; however, he appeared as himself in several episodes of Lass es, Larry! (2000), and played a regular role in Kirstie Alley's brief comedy series Kirstie (2013) with fellow TV comedy veteran and Rhea Perlman. He also made an isolated film appearance in the romantic comedy Faith, Hope & Love (2019).\n\nJane Leeves has made her mark in the entertainment world, acting in television, theater, and film over the past 20 years.\n\nShe is most famous for her role as \"Daphne\" in the award-winning show Frasier (1993). Leeves played one of the five main characters of the sitcom, a live-in physical therapist hired to take care of Frasier Crane's father. Leeves' character added a comical element to many scenes between Frasier and his family with her wit, down-to-earth remarks, and part-time, self-determined psychic abilities. Frasier Crane's brother becomes instantly smitten with her smile and Mancunian accent, which she had to fake for the whole duration of the show.\n\nShe became very good friends with the cast, including Peri Gilpin, David Hyde Pierce and John Mahoney, who are all godparents to her children.\n\nHer role as Daphne Moon was awarded numerous awards nominations during the course of the TV series :\n\nIn 1994 she was nominated for the \"Best Supporting Actress - Series, Miniseries or Television Film\" Golden Globe Award.\n\nIn 1995, she won the Q Award for \"Best Supporting Actress in a Quality Comedy Series\". She was nominated five more times in that same category (1994, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000).\n\nIn 1998, she was nominated for the \"Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series\" Primetime Emmy Award.\n\nIn 1999 and 2003, she was nominated for the \"Best Supporting Actress - Television Series, Musical or Comedy\" Satellite Award.\n\nIn 2001, she was nominated for the \"Supporting Actress of the Vear in a Comedy Series\" TV Guide Award.\n\nLeeves stars in the Emmy® Award-winning TV Land series, Hot in Cleveland (2010), which in 2011 was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award® for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. Leeves plays eyebrow archer to the stars, \"Joy Scroggs\". The comedy revolves around three fabulous LA women of a certain age, and best friends (Leeves, Valerie Bertinelli and Wendie Malick) whose lives are changed forever when their plane, bound for Paris, unexpectedly lands in Cleveland.\n\nShe graced the world of theater by starring as \"Sally Bowles\" in the Roundabout production of \"Cabaret\" on Broadway. Leeves has also lent her voice to various animated television series, including Die Pinguine aus Madagascar (2008), Phineas und Ferb (2007), and Die Simpsons (1989), as well as the major motion picture, James und der Riesenpfirsich (1996). Leeves also appeared in the film, Music of the Heart (1999), which co-starred Meryl Streep. On June 16, 2011, Leeves -- along with Hot in Cleveland (2010) co-stars Valerie Bertinelli, Wendie Malick and Betty White -- was presented with the key to the city of Cleveland by the mayor.\n\nShe recently started the \"Tellurian Foundation\", a line of all-natural skin care and baby products. A portion of the profits will be donated to those who strive to provide help to those in need, most recently \"Food Share\"."
