        "text": "Deep inside a mall in Dallas, on a Tuesday evening in early October, Jerry Seinfeld is poised to make an appearance.\n\nA red carpet has been set up in a movie-theater lobby — to be precise, a yellow-and-black-striped carpet, in the spirit of “Bee Movie” — the animated comedy opening Friday that Seinfeld wrote, produced and stars in.\n\nOn one side of the carpet are fans, clutching autograph books and digital cameras — ordinary Metroplex Joes who won a radio contest to get here. On the other side are camera crews and journalists, who have come to chronicle Seinfeld’s appearance as part of a 12-city, two-week tour to promote the film.\n\nThe anticipation builds, until a local TV-news personality — a bright, bouncy woman with her hair spritzed into a blond football helmet — announces to the crowd that the guest of honor is just minutes away. She instructs everyone to cheer as soon as the elevator doors open. We’re all supposed to give Jerry a warm and hearty Dallas welcome.\n\nAnd cheer the crowd does. Except, well, Seinfeld doesn’t seem to have his heart in it. He makes his way down the carpet looking grumpy and weathered. Then one journalist (OK, this journalist) makes the mistake of asking him to pose for a picture with the journalist’s mom, who happens to be visiting from New York, Seinfeld begrudgingly obliges. But after the photo is snapped, he scowls and, without a hint of levity in his voice, says, “That’s real professional of you to bring your mom.”\n\nLater, inside one of the theaters, before a presentation of clips from “Bee,” things turn chillier. When a woman asks him whether it’s true that he has 40 Porsches in his famed car collection, Seinfeld shakes his head dismissively and mutters, “No ... I have a lot, but not 40.”\n\nHe then adds, more than a little mockingly, “I have enough to impress you.”\n\nThe crowd doesn’t quite know whether to laugh or cringe. Most of us awkwardly do both.\n\nSo has Jerry Seinfeld — a major force in stand-up comedy since the early 1980s, co-creator and star of one of the most influential sitcoms in TV history — officially turned into a jerk? Is he utterly sick of shaking hands and posing for pictures and pretending to be everyone’s best friend? Would he much rather crawl beneath a rock and hide?\n\nWell, not exactly. Because later, when he sits down for a one-on-one interview, he’s suddenly focused, surprisingly frank and seemingly sincere. He’s poured his heart and soul into “Bee Movie,” and seems determined to get people to pay attention to it.\n\nThis press tour may have worn him down. But make no mistake: He hasn’t lost his urgency to succeed or his palpable, almost desperate need to make people laugh.\n\n“I remember my early years of doing ‘The Tonight Show,’ ” Seinfeld explains, settling onto the couch in a private lounge. “I’d sit with the show’s producers, and they would say, ‘We’ve been watching your act. We’d like to have you on, and we want you to do this routine and this routine.’\n\n“And I’d say, ‘No I’m not doing that. I’m doing this one, that one and the other one. Because I think those are the better ones.’ So I’ve always been very careful about what I present, even when I was a nobody.”\n\nIndeed, you don’t have to spend very much time talking to Seinfeld to realize that he takes the business of comedy very seriously. He began developing his stand-up skills in the 1970s, working the comedy-club and open-mic circuits after graduating from Queens College in New York. By the time of his storied “Tonight Show” debut in 1981, he had already earned a reputation as a bit of an obsessive, someone who would work and rework his material, and traipse from one dumpy club to the next in order to perfect his routine.\n\nThat obsessiveness continued with the “Seinfeld” TV show, which premiered in 1989 to middling ratings before steadily rising to become the most popular sitcom of the mid-1990s. With episodes that dwelled on the most mundane and ridiculous details of everyday life, “Seinfeld” was famously labeled “a show about nothing.”\n\nBut that label tended to obscure the fact that the show — which Seinfeld co-created with Larry David — was often brilliantly imagined and always intensely labored over. If you think otherwise, just check out perhaps its greatest episode, from season three, a two-parter called “The Boyfriend” — a head-spinning deconstruction of the Zapruder film coupled with riffs on the American fascination with spitting baseball players and the bizarrely enduring celebrity of former New York Met Keith Hernandez.\n\nSeinfeld’s intensity didn’t relent after his sitcom ended in 1998. Considering the large fortune he made from the show (more than a billion dollars by some estimates), he might easily have stayed home and counted his money. Instead, he returned immediately to his stand-up roots. He filmed an HBO special, “I’m Telling You for the Last Time,” and officially retired all of his old material. He then set about creating a new stand-up act, a painstaking process chronicled in Christian Charles’ marvelous 2002 documentary “Comedian.”\n\nFor Seinfeld, work is essential — especially stand-up, which he says remains his lifeblood. Even now he can’t go more than a few months without getting back on the stage.\n\n“It’s the purest, purest experience,” he says. “It’s like big-wave surfing. The wave of energy goes right through you. You don’t get that in these other forms, like movies or television.”\n\nBut have his successes made him any less impervious to criticism? Is he able to shrug it off when a routine doesn’t go well?\n\n“It always varies,” he says. “You can’t protect yourself from the ups and downs. But I like that. It’s a very honest feeling. There’s something just raw and honest about it. I liked getting scourged right to my face. I just feel like, ‘At least they didn’t lie to me.’ Because a lot of people in show business are surrounded by people who say the right things, and there’s a lot of handling that goes on. ... I always hated that.\n\n“I want to know the truth — ‘Is this any good or not?’ And in stand-up, they’ll tell you.”\n\nIn the past nine years, Seinfeld has kept a lot busier than people realize: In 1999, he married public relations executive Jessica Sklar, and they have three children. In 2002, he published a children’s book titled “Halloween.” He also continues to tour with the stand-up routine whose development was chronicled in “Comedian.”\n\nBut perhaps because we were once so used to seeing him on a weekly basis, many people have assumed that Seinfeld has been in a state of semi-retirement.\n\n“Bee Movie” should go a long way toward correcting this misperception. The project, nearly five years in the making, came about after an aggressive recruiting effort on the part of Jeffrey Katzenberg, the head of DreamWorks Animation. Seinfeld says he was looking for a new challenge and curious about the increasingly popular medium of computer animation. He worked closely with three other writers to develop the script. He personally selected the directors, Steve Hickner and Simon J. Smith, and the voice talent, which includes Renee Zellweger, Chris Rock and Matthew Broderick.\n\n“It’s one of these things you can get way in,” Seinfeld says. “It’s like a hedge maze, you’re in there for so long. I brought in Sacha Baron Cohen and Garry Shandling and some people at different points to watch it and tell me, ‘Am I on the right track here? Because I’m getting confused.’ ”\n\nIn the film, Seinfeld plays Barry B. Benson, a worker bee who disobeys the central rule of the bee world when he escapes from his hive and begins speaking to a florist named Vanessa (Zellweger). Barry also discovers, to his great horror, that bees’ honey is being mass-produced — and he determines to put an end to this practice.\n\nSeinfeld proclaims that he has more confidence in this movie than anything he’s ever done before. “When I have a great joke, I can’t wait to get to the stage with it,” he says. “And that’s how I feel with this. It’s like, ‘I can’t wait to tell you this joke.’ ”"
