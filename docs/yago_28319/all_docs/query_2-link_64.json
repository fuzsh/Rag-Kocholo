        "text": "The Bee Movie is a film that shows the never ending struggle between good and evil. After Barry Benson leaves the hive and begins to talk to humans, he sees that the humans have been harvesting and eating honey without the bees’ knowledge. He finds out that bee farms exist and their only purpose is to make bees work and to take the honey from them; from Barry’s eyes humans are grossly mistreating the bees. When he first gets to the farm, Barry overhears two beekeepers talking: “They make the honey and we make the money” (Hickner, Bee Movie). The bees work extremely hard to make honey, so Barry is appalled that humans are greedily taking their entire life’s work. Because of this, Barry decides to file a lawsuit against all humans. The case is set up in a way that presents the humans as bullies and the bees as defenseless, harmless creatures.

It becomes very clear that humans are evil and bees are inherently good. Also, during the trial, Ray Liotta suggests that “someone just step on [Barry] and [the people involved in the lawsuit] could all go home,” proving that humans do not care about bees (Hickner, Bee Movie).

They use it as antenna gel, soap, toothpaste, food, and they even fill pools with it; honey is an integral part of their daily life. It is everything they know and humans are taking it without their consent. As soon as bees are eligible, they start to make honey and they work until they die. Honey is literally their life’s work and the bees want a say in who gets to use it. In addition to building the theme of good versus evil, the Bee Movie displays many American values. The most prominent theme that the movie supports is to follow your dreams and never give up on them. Barry does not want to work and make honey; he explains “I want to do my part for the hive, but I can’t do it the way they want me to” when he first talks to Vanessa, a"
