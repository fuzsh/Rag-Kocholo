"Bee Movie" is the absolute worst comedic film ever created, there is no argument about that.

But imagine what could have been, had the film been created in live action?

Just think, Jerry Seinfeld in a bee costume with regular sized Ren√©e Zellweger and automatically the movie became "so bad its funny" instead of "so bad it sucks".

So I am petitioning Dreamworks and Jerry Seinfeld, please go ahead with "Bee Movie 2", but give the film the treatment it deserved, and film the whole thing in live action with Jerry Seinfeld in a bee costume hanging by wires on a set. You'll have the highest grossing film of all time, a film deserving of art houses, and a sense of personal accomplishment to help combat the feeling of depression and disappointment "Bee Movie" created within the cinematic universe.
