EMU 80000 Series: New Model on the Shin-Keisei Line

80016F of the EMU Shin-Keisei 80000 series arrives at Minoridai station

Shin-Keisei (New Keisei) Electric Railway launched their new commuter train, the EMU 80000 series, for the first time in 14 years. The first set named 80016F was built by Nippon Sharyo, and launched on December 27th, 2019.

The 80000 series is a sister train of the EMU Keisei 3100 series, which was also launched in 2019. Shin-Keisei is an affiliate firm of Keisei Electric Railway Company. The two companies introduced similar models around the same time to save the development and manufacturing costs. The 80000 series and the 3100 series have the same stainless steel bodies with the same designs. Both the 80000 series and the 3100 series have brand new SiC-VVVF (silicon carbide-variable frequency drive) inverter electric control systems. The new system on the 80000 series comes with a nineteen-percent improvement in its electric power consumption performance over the previous IGBT-VVVF inverter electric control system on the Shin-Keisei N800 series.

On the contrary, the specifications of the above two models are slightly different. The Shin-Keisei 80000 series is a 6-car train consisting of four motorcars and two trailers; meanwhile the Keisei 3100 series is an 8-car train consisting of six motorcars and two trailers. The former has flip-up type luggage storage on each car and a free Wi-Fi system on the train; meanwhile the latter doesn't have those. The former has Mitsubishi's 155kW induction motors; meanwhile, the latter has Toyo's 140kW induction motors.

Shin-Keisei plans to introduce the second set of the 80000 series in the fiscal year 2021.

Hydrangea Footpath on the Joban Line

Set K411 of the EMU JR East E531 series travels on the Joban line

Hinuma is a brakish lake located about 120 kilometers northeast of Tokyo. Large-sized Shijimi clams are a noted product in the lake, but it's not everything. On the coast of the lake, we can see hydrangea flowers in this season. The hydrangea footpath is open in Hinuma Natural Park. Visitors can enjoy over 30 species, 10,000 of the flowers along the footpath. I like Oak-leaved hydrangea (Hydrangea quereifolia or "snow flake") best. As its name suggests, it has oak-shaped leaves and pure white petals.

To visit Lake Hinuma Natural Park, the nearest station is Mito on the JR East Joban line. The EMU E531 series is the main fleet on the line. It was launched in 2005 to replace decrepit old trains such as the EMU 403 and 415 series. 460 cars in total were built by Tokyu Sharyo, J-TREC, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and JR East Niitsu Factory. The E531 series is an AC-DC dual system train consisting of ten cars (four motorcars and six trailers) in the main sets with five cars (two motorcars and three trailers) in the subsets. The gleaming stainless steel body with a dark blue colored stripe is an outward characteristic of the E531 series. In terms of the technical specifications, a maximum speed is 130 kilometers per hour. The IGBT-VVVF (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor - variable frequency drive) inverter electric control system with induction motors is on board.

I enjoyed the beautiful hydrangea footpath and the AC-DC dual system train on the Joban line.

EMU Hokuso 7300 Series: Keisei's Sister Train

7308F of the Hokuso 7300 series arrives at Higashi-Matsudo station

Hokuso is a local railway company in Chiba Prefecture. It belongs to the Keisei Group. Keisei Electric Railway Company holds the majority of Hokuso's stock.

The EMU Hokuso 7300 series is one of the main fleets on the Hokuso line. It was launched in 1991, when the section between Keisei-Takasago and Shin-Kamagaya was inaugurated. Two sets, eight units, were built by Tokyu Sharyo and Nippon Sharyo. The 7300 series is a sister train of the Hokuso 7800 series, the Chiba Newtown Railway 9800 series and the Keisei 3700 series. In other words, these four models have basically the same technical specifications. They have stainless steel bodies with the same designs. They have a GTO-VVVF (GTO-variable frequency drive) inverter electric control system with 130kW induction motors.

The Hokuso 7300 series, 7800 series and the Chiba Newtown 9800 series are 8-car trains with four motorcars (6M2T); meanwhile, the Keisei 3700 series is a 6-car train with two motorcars (4M2T). The Hokuso 7300 series is their own rolling stock; meanwhile, the 7800 series is a rental train from Keisei Electric Railway.

Incidentally, Hokuso was established in 1972 for the carriage of the Chiba Newtown residents. The route extends to the western part of Chiba Prefecture including Chiba Newtown. Connecting Keisei-Takasago and Imba-Nihonidai stations, its route length is 32.3 kilometers including Chiba Newtown Railway line. The track is double and electrified. The gauge size is 1,435 millimeters. The electric system is 1,500 V overhead. Hokuso trains are directly operated onto the Keisei, Toei-Asakusa and Keikyu lines.

Old Electric Locomotive on the Joban Line

A freight train pulled by an EL, JRF EF65 2096, approaches Matsudo station

On the way back from Hinuma Natural Park last month, I came across a freight train pulled by an old electric locomotive (EL) at Matsudo station on the Joban line. It was unit number 2096 of the JR Freight (JRF) Class EF65

The EF65 is one of the representative ELs in Japan. It was commissioned in 1965 as a new standard EL to replace the old model, Class EF60. 308 units were built from 1965 to 1979 by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Toshiba, Nippon Sharyo and so on. 53 units are still operated by JRF, JR East and JR West. The axis arrangement is Bo-Bo-Bo in UIC notation. Six sets of 425 kW DC motors are mounted.

A Recent topic of the EF65 is its body color change. Many units were returned to so-called "JNR color" as a rail-fans service. JNR stands for Japanese National Railways, which was abolished and split into seven JR companies in 1987. The JNR-colored ELs are still very popular among rail-fans, since JNR operated popular overnight sleeper trains such as Asakaze and Sakura pulled by JNR-colored ELs.

When will all units of the EF65 retire? I don't know exactly, but it's not a long way off. The successor of the EF65 is the EF210, which was launched in 1996. Pulling a total of 1,300 ton cargo container wagons, the EE210 can travel with a maximum speed of 110 kilometers per hour. I hope that the old EF65 will be operated in good condition for some time now.

Late Rose Blooming Season on the Keio Line

8710F of the Keio 8000 series travels on the Keio line

One month has passed since the state of emergency declaration caused by the new coronavirus was lifted nationwide by the Japanese government. Public facilities such as museums and theaters were reopened one after another. I recently visited Jindai Botanical Garden operated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government for the first time in a while.

Jindai Botanical Garden has a long history. It was a nursery garden for boulevard trees before WWII. The garden was then changed to the botanical garden, and opened to the public in 1960. I still remember that I made an excursion to this garden with my friends and teachers when I was a kindergartner. My favorite spot is a rose garden. It was a late blooming season. I could enjoy the colorful blossoms and the sweet fragrances of 400 kinds of roses.

To visit this historical garden, the nearest station is Tsutsujigaoka on the Keio line. On the way back home, I enjoyed taking photographs of the Keio trains for a while. I shot an EMU 8000 series train. The 8000 series was launched in 1992 as the first EMU to adopt the VVVF (variable frequency drive) control system on the Keio line. 245 units were built by Nippon Sharyo and Tokyu Sharyo. I found that the front lights of the 8000 series were changed from sealed beam lamps to LEDs. It's fun for me to find such minor change on the trains as a train spotter.

I enjoyed both beautiful roses and Keio's stylish trains.

Chocolate Colored DL in Takasaki Rail Yard

A chocolate colored DL, DE10 1705, is exhibited in Takasaki rail yard (October, 2013)

Following the JNR-colored electric locomotive, I'm going to show you a unique diesel locomotive (DL) photo, which I recently rediscovered on my hard disk.

The DL Class DE10 was launched in 1966 by Japanese National Railways to replace out-of-date steam locomotives on the local lines. 708 units of the DE10 were built from 1966 to 1978 by Nippon Sharyo, Kisha Seizo, Hitachi and Kawasaki Heavy Industries. The axis arrangement of the DE10 is Ao+Ao+Ao+Bo in UIC notation. It has a 1,350 (or 1,250) PS diesel engine per unit. The maximum speed is 85 kilometers per hour. The DE10 was once operated throughout Japan as passenger and freight trains; however, its current role is a switching engine in the rail yards.

Among the above 708 units of Class DE10 DLs, unit 1705 (DE10 1705) is quite unique. It has a chocolate colored body. DE10 1705 belongs to JR East Taksaki rail yard in Gumma Prefecture. It was built in 1974 by Kawasaki Heavy Industries. I came across this chocolate colored DL at an event for rail-fans, named "Takasaki tetsudo fureai day (Takasaki railway communication day)" in 2013. DE10 1705 was very popular among rail-fans at the event site, as its chocolate colored body was rare and beautiful.

What will be the future of the Class DE10? It will be replaced by new models such as JR Freight's DL, Class DE200 or a hybrid locomotive, Class HD300. I hope that the old DE10 will be operated in good condition for some time now.

Memories of Surface Track: Tokyu-Toyoko Line

5163F of the Tokyu 5050 series travels on the Toyoko line (February, 2012)

Seven years have already passed since Tokyu Railways moved their Toyoko line track from surface to underground between Shibuya and Daikanyama stations. I recently rediscovered old photographs of the ex-surface track on my hard disk. They were taken in February, 2012, one year before completion of the underground track. You can see a curved track with several construction works for transfer of the track.

On March 17th in 2013, the underground track and underground new Shibuya station were opened. Since then, the scenery of the Shibuya area has totally changed. The surface track was removed. Surface Shibuya station was dismantled. They have been changed to office buildings, parks, JR East's Shibuya station and so on.

Incidentally, the train in the photograph is the EMU Tokyu 5050 series launched in 2004. 36 sets (308 units) are currently operated on the Toyoko line. They are 8-car trains (26 sets) and 10-car trains (10 sets). The 8-car train is composed of four motorcars and four trailers (4M4T); meanwhile, the 10-car train consists of five motorcars and five trailers (5M5T). The 10-car train is also called the EMU 5050-4000 series, and directly operated onto the Tokyo Metro and the Seibu lines via Shibuya station. Set number 4110 (4110F) of the 5050-4000 series is a special poster train named "Hikarie". It is a unique poster train with yellow colored bodies to promote Shibuya Hikarie, which is Tokyu's advanced skyscraper and retail complex in the Shibuya area.

Redevelopment of the Shibuya area is still ongoing.

N700S: New Model on the Tokaido Shinkansen

EMU JR Central N700S series stands at Tokyo station on the Tokaido Shinkansen

On July 1st, 2020, Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) launched a new model, the EMU N700S (N700 Supreme) series, on their Tokaido Shinkansen. The introduction of the new Tokaido Shinkansen train was for the first time in 13 years.

The outer design of the N700S series is similar to that of the N700 and the N700A series, but there are several minor changes. For example, the frontal lamps were changed to LEDs. The shape of the nose became sharper. The number of the blue colored side stripes was increased from two to three. Regarding the interior, each seat of the N700S series has an electrical outlet. The reclining seats increased sitting comfort of passengers.

In terms of technical specifications, the N700S series has a full active vibration control device operated by a pump to prevent rolling. The maximum operating speed is 285 kilometers per hour due to the timetable restriction, but it recorded 362 kilometers per hour in a test run. JR Central plans to introduce a total of 40 sets (640 units) of the N700S series by the end of fiscal year 2022. It will be built by Hitachi Kasado Factory.

Incidentally, I found a fine drawing at the entrance of Tokyo station. It was drawn by a JR Central station staff on a white board. You can see the N700S series, JR East E235 series, JR East E257-2000 series and so on. They are very realistic. The explanation of the N700S series is easy to understand. Good job.

Memories of Surface Track: Keio Line

EMU Keio 7000 series travels on the Keio line near Chofu station (March, 2012)

Following the Tokyu-Toyoko line surface tracks, I'm going to show you the other ex-surface track photographs, which I recently rediscovered on my hard disk. These photos were taken near Chofu station on the Keio line in March, 2012. It was five months before the completion of the underground tracks.

The first photo shows the surface tracks and the construction work of the underground tracks. It was really difficult work, because the underground tracks were constructed just below the surface tracks. The second photo shows the complicated railway tracks next to surface Chofu station. The Keio main line and the Sagamihara line tracks were crossed on the surface. It was a bottleneck on the timetable.

On August 19th, 2012, new tracks were eventually completed. A total of 3.7km surface tracks were moved to the underground. Three stations, namely Chofu, Fuda and Kokuryo stations were also moved to the underground. It was good news as a grade separated crossing of the Keio main line and the Sagamihara lines has made it possible for the trains to be operated smoothly. Another advantage of the underground tracks was the elimination of traffic jams at railway crossings. It has completely disappeared after completion of the construction.

Eight years have already passed since then. The surface stations were dismantled and the surface tracks were removed. They have been changed to parks, pedestrian malls, public facilities and so on. The scenery of Keio line around Chofu station has been totally changed. Time really flies.

Sheep Train bound for the Children's Land

Y012F of the EMU Yokohama Minato Mirai Railway Y000 series, "Sheep Train"

On March 29th, 2020, Yokohama Minato Mirai Railway launched a special poster train named "Sheep Train" on their Kodomonokuni line. The purpose of the poster train is to promote tourism to Kodomonokuni (the Children's Land), which is an amusement park located in Yokohama City, some 30 kilometers west of Tokyo.

Yokohama Minato Mirai Railway offered one set of their 2-car train, Y012F of the EMU Y000 series, for the poster train. We can see cute images of sheep both on the bodies and the interior of the trains. Each car depicts a sheep in the outer design; meanwhile the pastures with sheep are drawn in the interior. Needless to say, there are many sheep in Kodomonokuni.

Incidentally, the Kodomonokuni line is a short (3.4 kilometers) single track railway connecting Kodomonokuni and Nagatsuta on the Tokyu Denentoshi and JR East Yokohama lines. The train on the Tokyu-Denentoshi line is directly operated onto the Kodomonokuni line, when a special event is held on the line. The Kodomonokuni line was opened in 1967 as an access railway to Kodomonokuni. The owner of the line is Yokohama Minato Mirai Railway; meanwhile, the trains are operated by Tokyu Railways.

The Y000 series was built by Tokyu Sharyo, and launched in 1999 as the fifth generation train on the Kodomonokuni line. Currently, three sets (six units) of the Y000 series are operated on the line. They are a standard colored train, the Sheep poster train and the Cow poster train.

Railway Signal System on the Odakyu Line

EMU Odakyu 8000 series passes through the traffic lights near Sobudaimae station

There are two kinds of railway signal systems in Japan. They are the cabin signal system and the ground signal system. In the former system, the traffic signal is installed in the cabin of each train; meanwhile, in the latter system, the traffic lights are installed on the railway tracks. The cabin signal system is adopted by Shinkansens, Tokyo Monorail, Keio Electric Railway and so on; meanwhile, the ground signal system is adopted by Odakyu Electric Railway, Keikyu Electric Railway and others. In any signal system, railway companies must have ATC (Automatic Train Control) or ATS (Automatic Train Stop) devices in Japan. These devices prevent trains from overspeeding at traffic signal points, tight curves, downhill tracks and endpoints of tracks.

Odakyu Electric Railway adopts the ground signal system. You can see examples in the photos. They were taken near Sobudaimae station. There are three traffic lights on the track. From left to right, they are for the eastbound siding, the eastbound main line and the westbound main line. The red light means "stop". The green light means "advancement (maximum speed of 110 kilometers per hour)". The green plus yellow lights mean "reduced speed (maximum speed of 75 kilometers per hour)".

In the first photo, for example, the EMU 8000 series commuter train is permitted to travel on the eastbound main line at a maximum speed of 75 kilometers per hour. Needless to say, the automatic emergency brake will be applied, if the train exceeds the speed limit.

2020 Summer in Yokohama: Saphir Odoriko

EMU JR East E261 series, "Saphir Odoriko" arrives at Yokohama station

The governor of Tokyo announced that Tokyoites should refrain from any nonessential and non-urgent outings during the 4-day weekend in July because of new coronavirus infection risks. I reluctantly agreed to that. Instead, I'm going to show you the photos taken before the 4-day weekend.

Last month, I visited Yokohama City in Kanagawa Prefecture to meet with my old friend. On my way back home, I came across JR East's new limited express train, Saphir Odoriko, at Yokohama station. As I introduced before, Saphir Odoriko, the EMU E261 series, was launched in March 2020 to replace an old limited express train, Super-view Odoriko, the EMU 251 series.

What are the differences between Saphir Odoriko and Super-view Odoriko? In short, the older Super-view Odoriko emphasizes the view from the train; meanwhile, the newer Saphir Odoriko train emphasizes the interior comfort and luxury. For instance, sloping tiers of seats are equipped in the front of Super-view Odoriko train to provide passengers with a gorgeous front view. All cars of Super-view Odoriko train were high-deckers, and had large side windows. On the other hand, Saphir Odoriko train has a luxurious Premium Green Car (first-class car) and a dining car.

I like enjoying views from Super-view Odoriko train and also relaxing in a gorgeous cabin of Saphir Odoriko train. The scenic view might be more important if I travel alone; meanwhile, a gorgeous cabin will be valuable if I travel with my family or friends. I'm in a dilemma.

Rare Train on the Chiba New Town Railway

9808F of the EMU Chiba Newtown Railway 9800 series stands at Higashi-Matsudo station

After introducing the EMU Hokuso 7300 series train in my recent post, I found that I haven't shown you its sister train yet. The introduction of trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area is indeed endless. Today, I am going to show you the EMU Chiba Newtown Railway (hereafter CNR) 9800 series for the first time in my blog.

The CNR 9800 series is a sister train of the Keisei 3700 series, the Hokuso 7300 and 7800 series. These "sister trains" have basically the same technical specifications and body structures. Only one set (9808F) of the 9800 series is operated on the line. It was originally Keisei 3738F of the 3700 series, and leased to CNR in 2017. 9808F has a yellow and a light blue stripe. I'm very happy whenever I come across this rare train on the line, as I like this coloring design.

Incidentally, CNR is a Keisei Group company. It owns a double-track between Komuro and Imba-Nihon-Idai stations (12.5 kilometers) in the Chiba Newtown area. This track was originally constructed and owned by the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (present Urban Renaissance Agency), but transferred to Keisei Electric Railway in 2004. CNR currently owns three kinds of train models, namely the EMU 9100 series, the 9200 series and the 9800 series. All trains on the line are operated by adjacent Hokuso Railway Company, and directly operated onto the Keisei, Toei-Asakusa, Keikyu and other lines. It's a bit of a complicated system due to the complicated operating history.

2020 Summer in Yokohama: Cosmo Clock 21

Set H001 of the EMU JR East E233-6000 series travels on the Yokohama line

I recently visited Yokohama City with my family. Our destination was Yokohama Cosmo World, which is a famous amusement park in the Minato-mirai area. After arriving, we wanted to enjoy Cosmo Clock 21, and went there straightaway. What's Cosmo Clock 21? It's Japan's fourth largest ferris wheel that is 112.5 meters in height. The wheel is illuminated by numerous beautiful bright LED lights. Riding Cosmo Clock 21, we enjoyed a spectacular view of the Yokohama port area.

To get to this large ferris wheel, please take a JR East Yokohama line train and get off at Sakuragicho station. As I posted before, the Yokohama line is one of the major commuter lines in the Tokyo metropolitan area. It was opened in 1908 to transport silk from the midland area to Yokohama Port. Connecting Higashi-Kanagawa and Hachiouji, the route length is 42.6 kilometers.

All the commuter trains on the Yokohama line are operated with green colored 8-car trains of the EMU E233-6000 series. JR East purchased 28 sets, 224 units, of the E233-6000 series from J-TREC. All units belong to Kamakura Rail Yard in Kanagawa Prefecture. The specification of the E233-6000 series is mostly the same as the other E233 series trains such as the E233-7000 series on the Saikyo line and the E233-8000 series on the Nambu line. They are equipped with induction motors with a IGBT-VVVF inverter (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor-variable frequency drive) control system. LED lights are widely used for interior illumination to reduce the electric consumption.

Blue Ocean on the Uchibo Line

EMU JR East 209-2100 series stands at Chiba station

The Japan Meteorological Agency made an announcement that this year's rainy season ended on August 1st in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Although it was 11 days later than normal years, this year's mid-summer has finally begun. I want to visit beach resorts to escape the urban "heat island", but all beaches in the Tokyo metropolitan area are closed this summer. Needless to say, it's because of new coronavirus infection risks. There is nothing I can do, so I'm going to show you a beautiful beach photo taken this winter.

Wadaura is a beautiful sandy beach on the Pacific coast in Minami-Boso City, Chiba Prefecture. It's well-known for its highly transparent and calm sea. To get to this resort, JR East's Uchibo line train is convenient. It takes about two hours from Chiba terminal by a local train. The vehicle is the EMU 209-2000 or 209-2100 series, and 68 sets (6-car and 4-car sets), 324 cars, are operated on the line. The difference between the 209-2000 and the 209-2100 series is simple. The 209-2000 series has a pneumatic door engine system, while the 209-2100 series is equipped with an electric door engine system.

Incidentally, JR East recently announced that a new model, EMU E131 series, will be launched on the Uchibo line soon. The first set was completed by J-TREC Niigata factory last month and transported to the Makuhari rail yard in Chiba Prefecture. I'm going to introduce the new model as soon as I come across it.

Aerial Tramway to Hakkoda Mountain

Hakkoda Ropeway in Aomori Prefecture

Hakkoda Mountain is a generic name of 10 peaks located in the northern part of Towada-Hachimantai National Park in Aomori Prefecture. It's an active volcano with a large caldera. Its main peak named Oodake is 1,584 meters above sea level. Visitors can see unique alpine plants in summer, while it's known for frost-covered trees which can be seen in winter. I recently visited this beautiful mountain with my family during the short summer vacation.

Hakkoda Ropeway is a convenient access to this beautiful mountain. It's four cables - cross type aerial tramway. Connecting Sanroku (Foot of the mountain) and Sancho-koen (Summit park) stations, its route length is 2,459.7 meters. Sancho-koen station is located 1,314 meters above sea level. The height difference between the two stations is 649.5 meters. Its maximum inclination is 25.72 degrees. The route was constructed by Nippon Cable in 1968. To operate the aerial tramway, two 150 kW DC main motors and a 124 kW/1,800 rpm backup diesel engine are installed at the Sancho-koen station.

The gondolas, namely number 1 and 2, were the third generation ones built by CWA in Switzerland in 2003. Each gondola can accommodate up to 100 passengers. The gondola is operated every 15 minutes (or 20 minutes) with an operating speed of 5 meters per second. It takes about 10 minutes to go one way.

After arriving at Sancho-koen station, we enjoyed the beautiful scenery. The problem at the office seemed so petty when I looked down on the world from the mountain.

2020 Summer in Yokohama: Nippon Maru Memorial Park

EMU Keikyu 1000 series travels on the Keikyu main line

Along with Yokohama Cosmo World, Nippon Maru Memorial Park is another popular sightseeing spot in the Minato-mirai area of Yokohama City, some 30 kilometers southwest of Tokyo. Visitors can see Japan's historical training sailing ship named Nippon Maru there. She is permanently docked, and open to the public as a museum ship. Nippon Maru was built by Kawasaki Shipbuilding Corporation in 1930. She was operated by the Tokyo Institute for Maritime Training to train officers for Japan's merchant marine, and replaced in 1984 by her successor, also named Nippon Maru. I enjoyed a vessel tour of this beautiful sailing ship.

On the way back home from Yokohama, I took train photos from behind the cockpit of the Keikyu train. One of the targets is the EMU 1000 series. The 1000 series was launched in 2001. 78 sets (8-cars, 6-cars and 4-cars), 472 cars, were built by Tokyu Sharyo, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and J-TREC. The bodies of the early 120 cars are made of aluminum, while the late 352 cars have stainless-steel bodies. As for the technical specifications, there are many varieties. For example, the first group has GTO devices for its VVVF inverter electric control system. The second group has IGBT devices, while SiC devices are used on the third group with the development of semiconductor technology. It's fun for me to perceive the fine difference among the Keikyu trains as a trainspotter.

I enjoyed both the old marine and the new land vehicles in Yokohama City on the weekend.

Gondola Lift to Nikko-Shirane Mountain

Nikko-Shiranesan Ropeway

It's very hot this mid-summer in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The maximum daytime temperature is often over 35 degrees Celsius. I evacuated from the urban "heat island", and visited the cool mountain in Gumma Prefecture with my family last weekend. Our destination was Nikko-Shirane Mountain, which is located about 160 kilometers north of Tokyo. It's a stratovolcano in Nikko National Park. Its main peak named Okushirane is an andesite lava dome, 2,578 meters above sea level.

Nikko-Shiranesan Ropeway is a convenient access to this high mountain. It's a single rope automatic circulation type gondola lift. Connecting Sanroku (foot of the mountain) and Sancho (summit) stations, its route length is 2,493 meters. The height difference between the two stations is 602 meters. Its maximum inclination is 38.97 degrees. There are 22 struts on the route. Nikko-Shiranesan Ropeway is owned by Nippon Paper Development Company. The route was constructed by Nippon Cable in 1999. The gondolas were built by CWA in Switzerland. They are operated counterclockwise with a speed of 5 meters per second. It takes about 15 minutes to go one way. Each gondola can accommodate up to 8 passengers.

Sancho station is located about 2,000 meters above sea level. After getting off at the station, we enjoyed the forest walking. Okushirane main peak was often seen from the footpath. The temperature was about 20 degrees Celsius, which was 15 degrees cooler than that of Tokyo. It's very comfortable and refreshing.

There were many pleasures in Nikko-Shirane Mountain.

Shonan-daira: Scenic Place on the Tokaido Main Line

EMU E233-3000 series travels on the Tokaido main line

Shonan-daira is a scenic place in Hiratsuka City, about 60 kilometers southwest of Tokyo. It's just a low hill at an elevation of 181 meters above sea level, but visitors can enjoy gorgeous views of the vast Kanto Plain and Sagami Bay from the summit. It's popular among young couples to enjoy the night view, while older people admire the cherry blossoms in spring.

I visited Shonan-daira in April, but my purpose of visit was neither the night view nor the cherry blossoms. I wanted to take photos of JR Central's Tokaido Shinkansen trains. The straight line track of the Tokaido Shinkansen is located about 1.5 kilometers north of Shonan-daira, so I expected to shoot the side view of a long Shinkansen train traveling at its top speed. I climbed up the hill on foot being soaked in sweat. Just after arriving at the summit, the Shinkansen train appeared. I could realize the 400-meters long train traveling at 285 kilometers per hour.

On the way back home, I also enjoyed taking photos of the Tokaido main line trains. The main fleet on the route is the EMU E233-3000 series launched in 2008. Currently, the E233-3000 series is widely operated in the Tokyo metropolitan area. My favorite is double-decker Green Cars (the first class cars) in the central part of the train. Once you pay an extra fee, a comfortable reclining seat is provided for you. I recommend it for long distance journeys over 100 kilometers. It costs 800 yen on holidays.

Local Train in the Aomori Area

Set N6 of the EMU JR East 701 series arrives at Shin-Aomori station on the Ou main line

On the way back from Hakkoda Mountain during my summer vacation, I came across a local train, the EMU JR East 701 series, at Shin-Aomori station on the Ou main line. I took several photos of it as a memory of my trip.

The EMU JR East 701 series is a standard commuter train in Tohoku District. It was launched in 1993 to replace the old commuter EMUs and the passenger coaches pulled by locomotives. Different from the trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area, the 701 series is an AC (alternate current) train. It has 20,000 V AC and 50 Hz electric systems. As you know, most of the trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area are operated by direct current (DC) electric systems. The AC trains always make me feel "I have come pretty far from home".

The body color of the 701 series varies by area. It has pink and purple colored stripes in the Aomori and Akita areas, while the other areas' ones have a number of other colors. This color variation is joyful for rail fans like me. Strange colored local trains always make me excited while traveling. With regard to the specification, the 701 series has a high level of efficiency. Specifically, the recently-built group has a brand new system, such as IGBT-VVVF electric control and regenerative braking. The greatest contribution of launching this train was to speed up travel time and provide air-conditioners.

The EMU 701 series has built a new generation in Tohoku District.
