        "text": "Below is a list of trains produced by Plarail.\n\nFull List[]\n\nThe following list as of May 2013, based on the Tomica & Plarail Catalogue App.\n\nStandard 3-car Sets[]\n\nThe box that appeared in 2001 is this 9th generation box. It is characterized by being numbered with a number commonly known as \"S product number\". Regular products such as Shinkansen and trains are numbered S, locomotives are numbered K, and freight is numbered F. It is thought to be an acronym for Sinkansen, Kikansya, and Freight, respectively . K / F was integrated into KF part number in 2011 and continues to this day.\n\nThe first appearance in this box was from the \" S-18 JR Kyushu White\" Kamome \" \" released on November 8, 2001, and since then it has been gradually numbered along with the renewal of the 7th and 8th generation box products. went.\n\nThe numbers S-01 to 12 were given to the Shinkansen, and were released at once as a renewal of the old product on July 18, 2002.\n\nWith the repeated release of new products and out of print, the lineup includes up to S-62, which is the largest number.\n\nIn addition to the fact that vehicles are replaced every year, there are also products that have had their brand logo updated due to the merger of Tommy and Takara on March 1, 2006, so the number is enormous. The brand logo has been updated sequentially since 2007, the year after the inauguration of TAKARATOMY, but since it is not a new product equal to the new brand logo, there is a rare transitional one that was released with the TOMY logo for a very short period of time. doing. Twenty years have passed since its appearance in 2021, and it has been confirmed that there are many variations in the box depending on the production time due to the length of the production period, so it is a terrifying generation that the whole picture is still unknown even though it is a recent product.\n\nIn 2014, the power unit was renewed to become what is commonly called \"new mechanism\", and at the same time, the box was also renewed.\n\nS-01 700 Series Shinkansen\n\nS-02 500 Series Shinkansen\n\nS-03 300 Series Shinkansen → E5 Series Shinkansen Hayabusa\n\nS-04 100 Series Shinkansen

character in the TV series, a basic blue and yellow color, and the Plarail Thomas logo on the right. When later engines were made, the packaging changed accordingly with the updated HiT Entertainment logo and the newly designed Thomas logo. Engines T-01 to T-06 got a new design and some had updated cars. Some engines also replaced other existing ones.
