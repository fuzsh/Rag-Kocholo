        "text": "Keisei 3100 series\n\nData (as of 6 Jul 2024)\n\nStatus: Least Concern Constructed in: 2019-23 Number built: 56 Registered: 56\n\nHistory\n\nThe 3100 series is the latest rolling stock of Keisei, mainly used for Access Express. As more foreign tourists than ever were expected to visit Japan during the Tokyo Olympics, the company developed a new train type for trains to and from Haneda/Narita Airports. Then 3100 series' predecessor 3050 series were reallocated to Keisei Main Line services. Shin-Keisei has similar trains called 80000 series.\n\nCurrent Operations & Future Prospects\n\nThe 3100 series are mostly used for through-services to Toei Asakusa and Keikyu lines (Access Express), connecting two airports and the centre of the capital. They also run towards Yokohama on Keikyu Main and Kurihama Lines at peak times."
