Four-car sets are commonly used to form 12-car \"Rapid Limited Express\" and \"Limited Express\" services, and are also used singly on all-stations \"Local\" services;[3] in addition, some are used on the Keikyu Daishi Line,[4] with some being used to form eight-car trains for use on inter-running services to the Asakusa Line and Keisei lines.[5] The six-car formations delivered from 2011 are generally used on all-stations \"Local\" services.[3] The N1000 series sets can be used in multiple with other Keikyu EMU types, including the 600 series, 1500 series, 2000 series, and 2100 series.[3]\n\nVariants\n\n[edit]\n\nSince the first set was introduced in 2002, the type has undergone a number of design improvements. Sets built from 2002 to 2006 have painted aluminium bodies, whereas sets built from 2007 onward (sets 1073 onward) have stainless steel bodies. More detailed variations are described below. The Siemens inverters fitted to the first two batches prior to their refurbishment between 2017 and 2021 were known in Japan by the nickname \"Do-re-mi-fa Inverter\" (ドレミファインバータ), due to the distinctive ascending musical scale the trains produced when accelerating from a standstill.[6]\n\nBatch 1\n\n[edit]\n\nDelivered February to June 2002.\n\n8-car sets x 3: 1001, 1009, 1017\n\n4-car sets x 2: 1401, 1405\n\nThese sets have single-arm pantographs and were formerly equipped with roller-blind destination indicators and Siemens GTO variable-frequency drive (VVVF) traction equipment.\n\nRefurbished 1st-batch set 1001 in October 2020\n\nBatch 2\n\n[edit]\n\nDelivered May to July 2003.\n\n8-car sets x 2: 1025, 1033\n\n4-car sets x 2: 1409, 1413\n\nThe centre pillars of the passenger windows were discontinued.\n\nSet 1409 was upgraded in May 2018, and modifications included LED lights, LCD-displays above the doors, LED-displays on the sides, and replacement of the original GTO-VVVF propulsion systems with IGBT inverters supplied by Toshiba, which is also used on sets 1401 and 1405 from the earlier batch. Set 1413 was also upgraded like set 1409 and started service in December 2018. Set 1025 was refurbished in May and August 2019, and the original Siemens GTO was changed to Toyo Denki IGBT. Set 1033 had Siemens GTO inverters until 18 July 2021, where it operated as a charter from Shinagawa; its last run ultimately took place on 20 July. Following refurbishment, set 1033 received Toyo Denki IGBT inverters.\n\nBatch 3\n\n[edit]\n\nDelivered January to March 2005.\n\n8-car sets x 2: 1041, 1049\n\n4-car sets x 2: 1417, 1421\n\nInitially built with Siemens-manufactured IGBT-VVVF inverters.\n\nSet 1417 was refurbished in March 2019.
