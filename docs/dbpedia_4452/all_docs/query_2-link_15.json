        "text": "The Narita Sky Access Line is a railway line that runs between Keisei Takasago Station and Narita Airport Terminal 1 Station. This is a bypass line that provides a faster link between Tokyo and Narita Airport than the longer Keisei Main Line. Services such as the Keisei Skyliner and the Access Express run on the Keisei Main Line from Keisei Ueno Station to Keisei Takasago Station and then follow the Narita Sky Access Line as far as Narita Airport.\n\nThis line is operated by the private company Keisei Railway, so it is not covered by the Japan Rail Pass. At Keisei Ueno Station Narita Sky Access services depart from platforms 1, 2, 3 and 4.\n\nDestinations\n\nThere are 8 stations on the Narita Sky Access Line.\n\nKeisei Takasago – Higashi-Matsudo – Shin-Kamagaya – Chiba New Town Chuo – Imba Nihon-idai – Narita Yukawa – Narita Airport terminal 2·3 – Narita Airport Terminal 1\n\nLocations of interest and transfer points between Keisei Takasago and Narita Airport Terminal 1 are listed below. For stations between Keisei Ueno and Keisei Takasago please see our article on the Keisei Main Line. Example train fares and journey times for the Access Express are given from Keisei Ueno Station.\n\nKeisei Takasago Station\n\nKeisei Takasago Station is also served by the Keisei Main Line, the Keisei Kanamachi Line, and the Hokuso Railway Line.\n\nHigashi-Matsudo Station\n\nThis station serves the city of Matsudo in Chiba Prefecture. Apart from the nearby Showa-no-Mori Museum, most of Matsudo’s attractions will require further transportation whether by local train lines, buses, or taxis.\n\nThe Showa-no-Mori Museum exhibits everyday objects from Japan’s Showa period (1926-1989) which includes a large number of classic cars, motorcycles, trains, and planes. The museum is a 19 minute walk from Higashi-Matsudo Station, but is only open on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and national holidays.\n\nIchikawa city Zoo is a 10 minute taxi ride from Higashi-Matsudo Station, and features red pandas, orangutans, and marmots, as well as a petting zoo, a farm animal section, and a miniature railway.\n\nTojo-tei House is a historic building which is nationally designated as an Important Cultural Property. The house was built as the family home of Akitake Tokugawa in 1884. Akitake was the younger brother of Japan’s last shogun, and he had his house built in a traditional Japanese style. The garden is also a nationally designated Place of Scenic Beauty. Tojo-tei House is a 15 minute taxi ride from Higashi-Matsudo station.\n\nTozenji Temple dates from 1481 and is a popular cherry blossom and autumn foliage viewing location. To get there, transfer to the JR Musashino Line at Higashi-Matsudo Station and after a 7 minute ride get off at Shim-Matsudo Station. Tozenji Temple is a 15 minute walk from Shim-Matsudo Station.\n\nHondoji Temple dates from 1277 and is famous for its hydrangea flowers in the early summer. This temple is a 15 minute walk from Kita-Kogane Station. To get there take the JR Musashino Line to Shim-Matsudo Station and then transfer to the JR Joban Line for Kita-Kogane Station. The full journey will take 35 minutes.\n\nManmanji Temple dates from 1256 and has two guardian statues at its entrance that are nationally designated as Important Cultural Properties. To get there take the JR Musashino Line to Shim-Matsudo Station, then transfer to the JR Joban Line for Mabashi Station. From Mabashi Station it is a 5 minute walk and the full journey will take 20 minutes.\n\nFor more information on Matsudo’s attractions download the official city guide and map.\n\nHigashi-Matsudo station is also served by the JR Musashino Line and the Hokuso Railway Line.\n\nShin-Kamagaya Station\n\nTransfer here to the Hokuso Railway Line, the Shin-Keisei Line, and the Tobu Urban Park Line.\n\nChiba New Town Chuo Station\n\nThis station is convenient for Chiba Prefecture Hokusou Hananooka Park. This is a large area of parkland with lawns, flower gardens, ponds, walking trails, a barbecue spot, and bird-watching facilities.\n\nTransfer here to the Hokuso Railway Line.\n\nNarita Airport Terminal 2·3\n\nExit here for Terminals 2 and 3. The station itself is located at Terminal 2 but shuttle buses to Terminal 3 take just 5 minutes. This station is jointly run by Keisei Electric Railway and JR East. Keisei Electric Railway run services on the Keisei Main Line and JR East run services on the Narita Line for destinations in Tokyo and Chiba. Passengers can also board the Narita Express here which is JR East’s alternative high speed service between Narita and central Tokyo.\n\nNarita Airport Terminal 1\n\nExit here for Terminal 1. This station is jointly operated by Keisei Electric Railway and JR East and is served by the Keisei Main Line, JR East’s Narita Line, and the Narita Express.\n\nServices\n\nThe Access Express and the Keisei Skyliner are the fastest services bound for Narita Airport from Keisei Ueno Station.\n\nThe Access Express has no extra charges and costs 1,240 yen for a journey that can take around 60 – 75 minutes between Ueno and Narita Airport.\n\nThe Skyliner stops only at the following stations:\n\nKeisei Ueno – Nippori – Narita Airport Terminal 2·3 – Narita Airport Terminal 1\n\nAs a result it takes only around 44 minutes to travel between Ueno and Narita Airport. However, the Skyliner does have a surcharge so the full fare is 2,470 yen.\n\nThere are also Access Express services that run between Narita Airport and Haneda Airport. These are through train services operating in conjunction with other private railways. The Access Express for Haneda Airport follows the Narita Sky Access Line between Narita Airport and Keisei Takasago, and then continues on the Keisei Main Line (as far as Aoto), the Keisei Oshiage Line, the Toei Asakusa Line, and the Keikyu Main Line. The travel time between the two airports is around 86 minutes for a fare of 1,800 yen.\n\nUseful Links\n\nDownload a complete route map of the Keisei Network which shows all the stops for the different services.\n\nTimetables from Narita Airport and Keisei Ueno Station can be found on the Keisei Railway website.\n\nUse English language route finders like the Japan Transit Planner and Hyperdia to plan your trips.\n\nArticle and original photos by Michael Lambe.
