        "text": "Promoting cultural socialization between local people of all ages is another purpose of this park. A community hall called “Forest Hall 21” is standing right next to the park. Music concerts (Classic, Jazz, Rock), theatrical stage, and lecture meeting are scheduled regularly. The reception hall of the upper floor is available for wedding ceremony too.\n\nIf you feel satisfied after having walked around the park or enjoyed the cultural events, visit the restaurant “AZARIA” on the 2nd floor. The spacious restaurant has lots of sunshine through window, offering you a very relaxing moment with its specialty coffee, cake and beef-stew（a recommended menu from the owner）!\n\nTojyo-tei House\n\nTojyo-tei house was built in April 1884 by Akitake Tokugawa. Akitake was a younger brother of Yoshinobu Tokugawa, the fifteenth and the last “shogun” of the House of Tokugawa. 10-minutes-walk from Matsudo, this wooden two-story building in a pure Japanese style is the one and only Tokugawa’s residence of Meiji era that still exists and is open to public.\n\nTojyo-tei consists of 9 buildings, with 23 rooms inside, connected by corridors. The first thing you may notice at the entrance is a telegraph message that was sent from Yoshinobu to Akitake, asking for recognition before visitation. The short message may evoke your imagination that historical figures were actually living and spending their time here.\n\nReflecting prudent character of Akitake, the interior of Tojyo-tei is very modest and humble. However there are lots of “secrets” everywhere. Mr. Yoichi Saito, a director of Tojyo Museum of History says, “Taking a closer look at every single equipment of each room is a key to enjoy this house.” For example, there are carvings of strange shape in the transom of servant’s room. What is it? “They are bats” Mr. Saito answers, “Bats were believed to invite happiness in at that era. And one of the bat is upside down. Why is that? I’ve been working here for a long time, but still there are many things, which I just simply don’t know why. It will take more than decades to reach conclusion.”\n\nThe highlight is a vast front tatami-room with pillars of cedar wood. Mr. Saito says, “Pay attention to the grain of the pillars. They are beautifully streaming. It’s because these thin pillars were cut off from best cedar wood which is many times thicker”. This room has a view of Edogawa River in a westerly direction, and allows you to see Mt. Fuji on a sunny day.\n\nFor visitors from foreign countries, there is a QR translator equipped in the house. English, Chinese, Korean, French, Germany, Italian, and Spanish guidance are available."
