Work

Exchange rates among different currencies are an important factor in business and the economy. In the beginning of the 1960s, Robert Mundell analyzed the effects of political actions on this area, including the consequences if exchange rates remain fixed or are allowed to be governed by the market. Mundell maintained that it could be advantageous for several countries to introduce a common currency, provided that the labor force has a great deal of mobility. Mundell’s theories had relevance for the introduction of the euro as the European Union’s currency.
