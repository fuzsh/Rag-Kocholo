        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe Nobel Prize 2022 for Economics has been awarded to three US-based economists 'for research on banks and financial crises'. All three winners will be awarded at the annual ceremony in Stockholm on December 10.\n\nBen Bernanke, Douglas Diamond, and Philip Dybvig have won the Nobel Prize in Economics for 2022. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the 'Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel' to three American economists for their research on banks and the financial crisis.\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee noted that the economic laureates for this year had significantly improved the understanding of banks' roles in the economy, especially during financial crises. The committee further noted that the winners’ research had enhanced the general understanding of banks, banking regulation, financial crises, and ways to manage them.\n\nBen Bernanke is an American economist and the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve (2006–14). Bernanke oversaw the 2008 financial crisis, the worst since the Great Depression, and was recognised as Time's Person of the Year in 2009.\n\nDouglas Diamond is an Associate Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Philip Dybvig is Professor of Banking and Finance at the University of St. Louis, Olin Business School of Washington. The two professors jointly developed theoretical models explaining the existence of banks, their vulnerability to rumours of collapse, and how society can dilute these vulnerabilities.\n\nAll three winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics 2022 will be awarded at the annual ceremony in Stockholm on December 10.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhen will the award ceremony take place?\n\nThe winners will be honoured during the annual Nobel Prize ceremony on December 10 in Stockholm.\n\nWho are Bernanke, Diamond, and Dybvig?\n\nBernanke was the chairman of the US Federal Reserve between 2006 and 2014. Diamond and Dybvig are professors of banking and finance.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by an external agency.
