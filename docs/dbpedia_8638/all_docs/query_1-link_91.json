        "text": "Hey there, time traveller!\n\nThis article was published 08/10/2006 (6523 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.\n\nSTOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) – American Edmund Phelps won the 2006 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences on Monday for his analysis of short-run and long-run trade-offs in macroeconomic policy.\n\nThe 73-year-old Columbia University professor’s work showed how low inflation today leads to expectations of low inflation in the future, thereby influencing future policy decision making by corporate and government leaders.\n\nPhelps is the sixth American to win a Nobel this year, meaning that every prize except for the literature and peace awards, which are yet to be announced, have gone to Americans.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said Phelps’ work had “deepened our understanding of the relation between short-run and long-run effects of economic policy.”\n\nPhelps challenged the prevailing view in the’60s that there was a stable, negative relationship between inflation and unemployment, illustrated by the so-called Phillips curve.\n\n“He recognized that inflation does not only depend on unemployment, but also on the expectations of firms and employees about price and wage increases,” the academy said.\n\nPhelps put together a new model to describe the relationship between inflation and unemployment, known as the expectations-augmented Phillips curve.\n\nHe also showed that there is a precise “equilibrium unemployment rate” at which firms raise workers’ wages at the same rate as average wages are expected to rise in the economy overall. Those findings have influenced central banks in their interest-rate decisions, the academy said.\n\n“Phelps’ work has fundamentally altered our views on how the macroeconomy operates,” the citation said, adding his work proved fruitful in understanding the causes of the increases in both inflation and unemployment in the’70s.\n\nIn its citation announcing the award, the academy said that Phelps had advanced the understanding of the trade-offs between full employment, stable pricing and rapid growth, all of which are the central goals of any sound economic policy.\n\n“But policy always faces difficult goal conflicts. How should inflation and unemployment be balanced against each other?” the academy asked in the citation. “What trade-off should be made between the consumption of current and future generations?”\n\nPhelps’ work advanced the understanding of those trade-offs.\n\n“He has emphasized that not only the issue of savings and capital formation but also the balance between inflation and unemployment are fundamentally issues about the distribution of welfare over time,” the academy said. “Phelps’ analyses have had a profound impact on economic theory as well as on macroeconomic policy.”\n\nPhelps also pioneered the analysis of the importance of human capital, or workers themselves, for the diffusion of new technology and growth in the business and corporate world, the academy said in its citation.\n\nPrevious winners of the economics prize, awarded since’69, ranged from how the control of information affects markets to welfare economics used to explain the economic mechanisms that underlie famine and poverty.\n\nLast year’s winners were Robert Aumann, a citizen of Israel and the United States, and American Thomas Schelling, for their work in game-theory analysis.\n\nThe economics prize, worth the equivalent of US$1.4 million, is the only one of the awards not established in the will left by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel a century ago.\n\nThe medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace prizes were first awarded in’01, while the economics prize was set up separately by the Swedish central bank in’68.\n\nThe economics prize is the fourth of six to be announced. The winner of the Nobel Prize in literature will be announced Thursday, followed by the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway, on Friday.\n\nLast week, the Nobel prize in medicine went to Andrew Fire and Craig Mello for discovering a powerful way to turn off the effect of specific genes.\n\nJohn Mather and George Smoot won the physics prize Tuesday for work that helped cement the big-bang theory of how the universe was created.\n\nAmerican Roger Kornberg won the prize in chemistry for his studies of how cells take information from genes to produce proteins, a process that could provide insight into defeating cancer and advancing stem cell research.\n\nThe Nobel prizes are presented Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of their founder. The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway, and the other Nobel prizes are presented in Stockholm.\n\n–\n\nRecent – winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics\n\nSTOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) – Recent winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, and their research:\n\n-2006: Edmund Phelps of the United States for furthering the understanding of the trade-offs between inflation and its effects on unemployment.\n\n-2005: Robert Aumann of Israel and the United States, and American Thomas Schelling, for their work in game-theory analysis.\n\n-2004: Finn Kydland of Norway and Edward Prescott of the United States, for their contribution to dynamic macroeconomics.\n\n-2003: Robert Engle of the United States and Clive Granger of Britain, for their use of statistical methods for economic time series.\n\n-2002: Daniel Kahneman of the United States and Israel, and Vernon Smith of the United States, for pioneering the use of psychological and experimental economics in decision-making.\n\n-2001: George Akerlof, Michael Spence and Joseph Stiglitz, all of the United States, for research into how the control of information affects markets.\n\n-2000: James Heckman and Daniel McFadden, both of the United States, for their work in developing theories to help analyze labour data and how people make work and travel decisions.\n\n-1999: Robert Mundell of Canada, for innovative analysis of exchange rates that helped lay the intellectual groundwork for Europe’s common currency.\n\n-1998: Amartya Sen of India, for contributions to welfare economics, which help explain the economic mechanisms underlying famines and poverty.\n\n-1997: Robert Merton and Myron Scholes, both of the United States, for developing a formula for the valuation of stock options.\n\n-1996: James Mirrlees, Britain, and William Vickrey, both of the United States, for contributions to the economic theory of incentives under asymmetric information."
