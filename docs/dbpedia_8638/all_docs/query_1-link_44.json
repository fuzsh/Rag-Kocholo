        "text": "— Americans Alvin Roth and Lloyd Shapley were awarded the Nobel economics prize Monday for research that helps explain the market processes at work when doctors are assigned to hospitals, students to schools and human organs for transplant to recipients.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited the two economists for \"the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design.\"\n\nRoth, 60, is a professor at Harvard University in Boston. Shapley, 89, is a professor emeritus at University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n\"This year's prize concerns a central economic problem: how to match different agents as well as possible,\" the academy said.\n\nShapley made early theoretical contributions to the field of study, and Roth took it further by applying it to the market for U.S. doctors.\n\n\"Even though these two researchers worked independently of one another, the combination of Shapley's basic theory and Roth's empirical investigations, experiments and practical design has generated a flourishing field of research and improved the performance of many markets,\" the academy said.\n\nThe Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was the last of the 2012 Nobel awards to be announced.\n\nIt's not technically a Nobel Prize, because unlike the five other awards it wasn't established in the will of Alfred Nobel, a Swedish industrialist also known for inventing dynamite.\n\nThe economics prize was created by the Swedish central bank in Nobel's memory in 1968, and has been handed out with the other prizes ever since. Each award is worth about $1.2 million.\n\nHere's a list of recent winners of the economics prize:\n\n2012: Americans Alvin Roth and Lloyd Shapley for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design.\n\n2011: Americans Thomas Sargent and Christopher Sims for their research on cause and effect in the macroeconomy.\n\n2010: Americans Peter Diamond and Dale Mortensen and Christopher Pissarides, of Britain and Cyprus, for their analysis of markets with search frictions.\n\n2009: Americans Elinor Ostrom and Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic governance.\n\n2008: American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity.\n\n2007: Americans Leonid Hurwicz, Eric S. Maskin and Roger B. Myerson for laying the foundations of mechanism design theory\n\n2006: American Edmund S. Phelps for furthering the understanding of the trade-offs between inflation and its effects on unemployment.\n\n2005: Robert J. Aumann, of Israel and the United States, and American Thomas C. Schelling, for their work in game-theory analysis.\n\n2004: Finn E. Kydland, Norway, and Edward C. Prescott, United States, for their contribution to dynamic macroeconomics.\n\n2003: Robert F. Engle, United States, and Clive W.J. Granger, Britain, for their use of statistical methods for economic time series.\n\n2002: Daniel Kahneman, United States and Israel, and Vernon L. Smith, United States, for pioneering the use of psychological and experimental economics in decision-making.\n\n2001: George A. Akerlof, A. Michael Spence and Joseph E. Stiglitz, United States, for research into how the control of information affects markets.\n\n2000: James J. Heckman and Daniel L. McFadden, United States, for their work in developing theories to help analyze labor data and how people make work and travel decisions.\n\n1999: Robert A. Mundell, Canada, for innovative analysis of exchange rates that helped lay the intellectual groundwork for Europe’s common currency.\n\n1998: Amartya Sen, India, for contributions to welfare economics, which help explain the economic mechanisms underlying famines and poverty.\n\n1997: Robert C. Merton and Myron S. Scholes, United States, for developing a formula for the valuation of stock options.\n\nRead tomorrow's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details."
