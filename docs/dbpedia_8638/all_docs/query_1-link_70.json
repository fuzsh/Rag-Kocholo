        "text": "Mobbed by fans and photographed like a rock singer, John Nash Jnr received a star-studded welcome yesterday as some of the biggest names in business turned up to hear the Nobel Prize-winning mathematician and economist.\n\nThe presentation by Professor Nash, 80, and another Nobel laureate in economics, Robert Mundell, drew about 1,000 people to a Polytechnic University forum on the global financial crisis.\n\nThose in the audience included Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing chief executive Paul Chow Man-yiu, CLP Holdings chief executive officer Andrew Brandler, veteran political figures Allen Lee Peng-fei and Selina Chow Liang Shuk-yee as well as former Executive Council member Victor Lo Chung-wing.\n\nProfessor Nash, although visibly frail, showed none of the traits of someone who had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and mild clinical depression. Much of his private life and personal struggles came to public attention in the Oscar-winning film, A Beautiful Mind, in which he was portrayed by actor Russell Crowe. When asked what he thought of the film, he simply smiled and said it was 'artistic'.\n\nMany in the audience had expected to get insights or answers to the current crisis. But Professor Nash, who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994 in recognition of his work on game theory as a Princeton graduate student, spoke about 'ideal money and asymptotically ideal money'.\n\n'A series of American economists have been notable through their contributions which have enhanced the understanding of how systems of money actually function and particularly of how the [US] dollar and its value have been interacting with the relevant factors of influence. There has always been some 'populist' thinking in the US which can encourage ideas about money that are not well based in any scientific sense. And the teachings of some of the notable economists have sometimes given a more scientific perspective on the areas where the 'populist' viewpoints have been influential,' he said.\n\nReading from prepared slides projected onto a large screen, he drew laughter from the packed auditorium, albeit unintentionally, when he bluntly told an assistant who offered a laser pointer to help him: 'I don't need this.'\n\nProfessor Nash's work focuses on game theory, which analyses the process of decision-making."
