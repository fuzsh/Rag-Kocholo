        "text": "STOCKHOLM â€” Edmund Phelps, an American, was awarded the 2006 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science on Monday for explaining the relationship between inflation and unemployment, work that has had a profound impact on macroeconomic policy.\n\nPhelps, 73, a Columbia University professor, challenged prevailing views in the 1960s by developing a new economic model that has helped corporate and government leaders balance inflation and unemployment in decision-making.\n\n\"I'm very happy,\" Phelps said in New York after he was told of the award in a telephone call from Sweden. \"I waited for it a long time.\"\n\nIn fact, Phelps said, he would not have been surprised if he had not received the award this year.\n\n\"I thought for a time I would get it in my 60s, then I thought I would get it in my 70s and, more recently, I've been thinking that I would get it in my 80s,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"I tried to put the people back into our economic model and, in particular, to take into account their expectations about what other economic actors are doing at the same time and in the future,\" Phelps said.\n\nHe was the first single recipient of the economics award since 1999, when Robert Mundell, a Canadian and also of Columbia University, was named for his analysis of monetary and fiscal policy under different exchange-rate regimes.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
