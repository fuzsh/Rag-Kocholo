        "text": "David Card, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens have been awarded this year's Nobel prize for economics for work that \"challenged conventional wisdom\".\n\nThe trio shared the prize for pioneering work in the use of \"natural experiments\".\n\nNatural experiments use real-life situations to work out the impact of government decisions.\n\nProf Card is best known for his study of the impact of minimum wage increases on employment in US states.\n\nHis findings prompted researchers to review their opinion that such increases always lead to falls in employment.\n\nEconomists cannot run lab experiments to test their theories, so have to rely on theoretical models and the examination of complex, real life situations.\n\nThe winners' work had \"substantially improved our ability to answer key causal questions, which has been of great benefit to society,\" said Peter Fredriksson, chair of the Economic Sciences Prize Committee.\n\nCanadian-born Prof Card, who works at University of California, Berkeley, receives half of the 10 million Swedish crowns (Â£839,000) prize, while Israeli-American Joshua Angrist from MIT and Guido Imbens, a Dutch academic at Stanford University, share the other half.\n\nTheir work solved methodological problems to show that precise conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn from natural experiments.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Prof Imbens said he was \"absolutely thrilled to hear the news, in particular... hearing that I got to share this with Joshua Angrist and David Card who are both very good friends of mine\".\n\nHe added that Prof Angrist had been the best man at his wedding. \"I'm just thrilled to share the prize with both him and David.\"\n\nNo joke\n\nProf Card initially thought the news of the award was \"a joke\" played on him by an old high school friend, he told the BBC.\n\nHis work on the minimum wage was conducted at Princeton in the 1980s in collaboration with Alan Krueger, who went on to become assistant secretary of the Treasury under President Obama.\n\nThey surveyed restaurants in New Jersey before and after the introduction of a minimum wage in the state, an approach that was quite unusual at the time, Prof Card said.\n\nBut he said their findings, that the minimum wage had not led to significant job losses, was not immediately accepted.\n\n\"People thought we were either cooking the books or had lost our minds or did something untoward or foolish,\" he said.\n\nHowever the methodology, of collecting and analysing real world data, opened people's eyes to a new way of analysing the economy, he said.\n\nHis subsequent work has included the impact of immigration on domestic employment in the US and how company wage policies determine gender and ethnic pay gaps.\n\nUC Berkeley said Prof Card had \"challenged orthodoxy and dramatically shifted understanding of inequality and the social and economic forces that impact low-wage workers\".\n\nTaken together, the work by the three economists \"revolutionised empirical work\" in economics, the Nobel award committee said.\n\nAlthough not one of the original Nobel Prizes, the economics award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and is the last to be announced each year.\n\nThe other Nobel prizes were established by Alfred Nobel's will in 1895."
