Goldin is only the third woman to win the prize.\n\nClaudia Goldin is the Henry Lee Professor of Economics at Harvard University and was the director of the NBER’s Development of the American Economy program from 1989 to 2017. She is a co-director of the NBER's Gender in the Economy group. An economic historian and a labor economist, Goldin's research covers a wide range of topics, including the female labor force, the gender gap in earnings, income inequality, technological change, education, and immigration. Most of her research interprets the present through the lens of the past and explores the origins of current issues of concern. Her most recent book is Career & Family: Women's Century-Long Journey toward Equity, published by Princeton University Press in 2021.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Economics in 2022 was given to US economists Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig together with former Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke for research on banks in times of turmoil.\n\nFull list of Nobel Prize in Economics winners (1990 onwards)\n\nWhile Americans have mostly dominated the award category, Women have won the prestigious prize twice only.
