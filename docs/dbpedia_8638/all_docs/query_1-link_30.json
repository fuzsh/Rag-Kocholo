        "text": "Alan J. Auerbach is the Robert D. Burch Professor of Economics and Law, Director of the Burch Center for Tax Policy and Public Finance, and former Chair of the Economics Department at the University of California, Berkeley. He is also a Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research and previously taught at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania, where he also served as Economics Department Chair. Professor Auerbach was Deputy Chief of Staff of the U.S. Joint Committee on Taxation in 1992 and has been an adviser to several government agencies and institutions. He is a Distinguished Fellow of the American Economic Association, having previously served as an Executive Committee Member and Vice President of that association and as Editor of its Journal of Economic Perspectives and American Economic Journal: Economic Policy. Professor Auerbach is a past President of the National Tax Association, from which he received the Daniel M. Holland Medal, and is currently President of the Western Economic Association International. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Econometric Society, and the National Academy of Social Insurance.\n\nPranab Bardhan, a Cambridge University PhD, has been at Berkeley since 1977, following teaching appointments at MIT and the Delhi School of Economics. He was the chief editor of the Journal of Development Economics for 1985-2003. He was the co-chair of the MacArthur Foundation-funded Network on the Effects of Inequality on Economic Performance for 1996-2007. He held the Distinguished Fulbright Siena Chair at the University of Siena, Italy in 2008-9. He is the BP Centennial Professor at London School of Economics for 2010 and 2011.He is the author of 12 books and more than 150 journal articles, and the editor of 12 other books.He has done theoretical and field studies research on rural institutions in poor countries, on political economy of development policies, and on international trade. A part of his work is in the interdisciplinary area of economics, political science, and social anthropology. His current research involves theoretical and empirical work on decentralized governance, and the political economy of development in China and India.\n\nProfessor Break served as Chairman of the Berkeley Economics Department from 1969 to 1973. During the 1980s, he was President of the National Tax Association, which later honored him with its Holland Medal, and was appointed by California Governor George Deukmejian to the Governor's Tax Reform Advisory Commission. His advising activities extended well beyond California's borders, including work evaluating the tax systems of Greece and Jamaica.\n\nA native of Canada who served in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II, Break held a Berkeley Ph.D. and had been a member of the Department since his first appointment as an Assistant Professor in 1951. During his time in Berkeley he became a leader in the field of Public Finance and made many important contributions to this field, including early and influential empirical research efforts on the effects of income taxation on work incentives and several books and published papers on intergovernmental relations and various aspects of tax reform in the United States and Canada. Among his best known books are Public Finance (with Earl Rolph), Federal Tax Reform: The Impossible Dream (with Joseph Pechman), and Financing Government in a Federal System. Among his many students at Berkeley was Michael Boskin, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under President George H.W. Bush.\n\nIn Memoriam\n\nClair Brown, PhD, is Professor of Economics emerita and Director of the Center for Work, Technology and Society at the University of California, Berkeley. Brown has published research on many aspects of how economies function, including inequality, sustainability, high-tech industries, the standard of living, and wage determination,. Her books include American Standards of Living, and Chips and Change: How crisis reshapes the semiconductor industry. Her most recent book Buddhist Economics: An enlightened approach to the dismal science (Bloomsbury Press) provides an economic framework that integrates global sustainability, shared prosperity and care for the human spirit. Brown’s research team developed a Sustainable Share-prosperity Policy Index that evaluates 50 countries’ economic policies according to how well they protect the environment (sustainability), structure markets to achieve social goals (equity), and provide basic services and opportunities (wellbeing). One aspect of this work is the development of a measure of economic performance based on the quality of life, and to estimate it for state of California. The Genuine Progress Index (GPI) integrates measurements of inequality and environmental degradation as well as value of nonmarket activities and consumption to provide an inclusive measurement of sustainable economic performance to guide policy. At UCB Brown co-founded a new graduate program called Development Engineering, for students in engineering and economics to develop their multidisciplinary skills for designing, building, and evaluating new technologies to help developing or under-resourced regions.\n\nYou can listen to podcasts with Clair: https://buddhisteconomics.net/podcasts/\n\nBook trailer (2 min): https://youtu.be/88RX5A2iezs\n\nBrown’s economic approach is published in Eminent Economists II (Cambridge University Press, 2013).\n\nClair Brown has also been actively involved in climate justice work or the past decade. Clair Brown volunteered and provided economic analysis and assisted with community advocacy for climate justice organizations, including 350 Bay Area, Fossil Free California, Sierra Club and Earth Justice. For five years Brown was the co-chair of the 350 Bay Area Action Legislative team, which educated and lobbied Legislators to pass effective and equitable climate policies and worked with state agencies to implement the climate laws to be inclusive and reduce the impact of GHG emissions on vulnerable communities.\n\nBrown’s UC Berkeley student research team worked with Fossil Free California to evaluate the financial risk of state pension funds, especially CalPERS, investing in fossil fuel industry assets. They wrote several academic reports, commented at the CalPERS Board meetings, and worked with lawmakers to draft bills that mandated corporate reporting of their risks related to fossil fuel use, and required divestment of specific fossil fuel assets by the state public pension funds. Here is a recent report. https://fossilfreeca.org/promises-promises-evaluating-calpers-climate-engagements/\n\nBrown in coordination with Prof. Julia Walsh, MD collaborated with the following Environmental and Climate Justice organizations to produce critiques of transportation analyses and analyses of health and economic costs of oil and gas wells and PM2.5 in California.

Ward taught for 32 years in the Economics Department at UC Berkeley and also received his Bachelor's and PhD degrees from there. His teaching covered 36 years, including two years as an Assistant Professor at Stanford and two years abroad in Greece and Hong Kong. He retired in 1992.\n\nWard had two main research fields: Comparative Economic Systems, and Philosophy and Methodology of Economics. The first of these is a rather broad field, and led him into a range of research, from worker management in Yugoslavia (Illyria, 1958; Worker's Management, 1957) through modelling of socialist economic structures (Soc.Ec. 1967), the use of mathematical techniques in Soviet Russian planning (LP, 1967), comparative development (Yug.Ec.Hist., 1978; Grk.Reg.Dev., 1962; ChiEc.Dev., 1980), and economic planning in the West (Natl.Econ.Plan.Eur, 1975). He served as Director of the Department's program on the Greek economy, as Chair of the Center for Slavic and East European Studies, and spent a year in Hong Kong initiating a UC Berkelely master's degree program in Chinese studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He was President of the Comparative Economics Association, and served as Principal Investigator for a Macarthur grant supporting both faculty research and graduate fellowships in interdisciplinary national security studies (5 years, $1 million).\n\nWard produced two books in his second field, Philosophy and Methodology, and is nearing completion of a third. The first of these (What'sWrong, 1972), focused on the way in which well-defined puzzles and social and career pressures give institutional structure to the field. The second (Ideal Worlds,1979), focused on the substantial role of ideology--liberal, conservative, and radical, in shaping economic research. The third emphasizes uncertainty and risk-seeking behavior as systematically underestimated by the discipline. A paper (LEP, 1988) offers an alternative way of appraising the results of economic activity, which is developed further in the book on uncertainty and risk-seeking.\n\nIt is unusual for someone who chose breadth over depth to survive in a major research university like UC-Berkeley. However it's quite natural for such a person to have a strong interest in teaching. Ward did regularly teach a variety of graduate courses in the Economics Department (Comparative Economic Systems, European Economic History, Political Economics, National Economic Planning), but was especially drawn to undergraduates who were not planning a career as an economist. The more energetic among them will likely be among the movers and shakers of the next generation, and teaching them was a delight.\n\nSelected Publications:\n\nThe Socialist Economy, A Study of Organizational Alternatives, 1967, Random House.\n\nWhat's Wrong With Economics? 1972, Basic Books\n\nThe Ideal Worlds of Economics, 1979, Basic Books\n\nProblems of Greek Regional Development, 1962, Center of Economic Research monograph series, Athens.\n\n(With George W.
