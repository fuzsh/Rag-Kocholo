        "text": "An American and a Briton have won this year's Nobel award in economics for developing statistical methods that allow researchers to better understand stock prices, consumer spending and other long-running series of data.\n\nRobert F. Engle, who was born in Syracuse, N.Y., and Clive W.J. Granger, a native of Wales, spent much of their career working together at the University of California at San Diego, doing their seminal work in the 1980s. Engle moved to New York University three years ago. Granger retired in June and is now a visiting professor at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\n\"I'm in the town of Annecy, France, and it's late afternoon, and it's a beautiful day,\" Engle, who is 60, said in a telephone interview Wednesday. He is on sabbatical in Europe, where he is giving a series of lectures. \"How they tracked me down here, I'm not sure. It's pretty far from the big financial centers.\"\n\nGranger said he was sure he had won the prize only after a colleague called him from Sweden very early in the New Zealand morning. He said the man passed him to members of the committee who elected him for the prize, \"and I know one of them rather well, so when I heard his voice I knew it wasn't a hoax so I was then cheerfully relaxed.\"\n\nUntil then, the British economist thought the call from the Nobel committee might have been a hoax. \"I don't like being called at 3 a.m. _ but I was happy to accept that particular call,\" he said.\n\nThe Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, carries a cash prize of about $1.3-million, which will be divided between the two men. Former winners include Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago and Robert Mundell of Columbia University. The prizes are presented to the winners on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896.\n\nEngle and Granger, 69, are econometricians, or researchers who use statistics to analyze economic phenomena. They were among the group of a few dozen economists considered contenders for the prize, but they were not seen as obvious choices this year because two other econometricians received the prize in 2000.\n\nThe research conducted by this year's winners has enabled other economists to study the relationships among variables in ways that once was not possible. Before their work, economists often had to assume that a variable, like the price of a stock, showed little long-run trend, even when evidence, like the general rise in stocks over the last 200 years, showed otherwise.\n\nEngle said he and Granger became interested in the issue during the 1980s, when volatility in global financial markets began having a major impact on the U.S. and other major economies.\n\nAfter the U.S. stock market crash of 1987, he recalled, \"there was a big question of how volatile markets were going to be in the future. What we found was that volatility has a life of its own, and you can track it and use statistical methods to try to forecast how long each movement will last.\"\n\nGranger concentrated on how to use their statistical models to forecast economic trends, while Engle showed how they can help predict volatility.\n\n\"It's a terrific choice,\" said Dale Jorgensen, a Harvard economics professor familiar with the men's work. \"These two have solved a problem that economists have been struggling with for years _ how to apply the trends that show up in various economic statistics to see how they relate to one another and to predict how that will drive our economy and the financial markets. It's had enormous ramifications.\"\n\n\"These days, we're pretty well certain that the performance of corporate earnings is the major determinant in how stock prices will go, but that wasn't true in 1987,\" Jorgensen said. \"Engle and Granger show how we could link these and other statistics. It's had very important practical implications.\"\n\nJorgensen noted that their work led directly to the research by Robert Shiller of Yale and John Y. Campbell of Harvard that argued that the stock market was overvalued before its recent decline began.\n\nEngle had run an errand Wednesday and returned home to learn that the prize committee had called. He later called Granger.\n\nIn response to a question, Engle said he hasn't tried to use his work to manage his own investments. \"I'm a pretty straightforward buy-and-hold investor,\" he said.\n\n_ Information from Bloomberg News and the Associated Press was used in this report."
