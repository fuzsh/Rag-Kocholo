        "text": "Actor Kay Kay Menon says it is wrong to attach \"values\" to cinema and think that it will bring a change in the society as he believes movies are just a medium of entertainment.\n\nThe 53-year-old actor said people should enjoy cinema rather than attaching extremist issues to it.\n\n\"Storytelling is to enjoy it and have a good time seeing it. To think more about that in society and this and that, is futile. Cinema can never influence society unnecessary people take it too seriously. I think you got to take it for its own spirit than assigning values to it, which is not intended by the filmmaker itself.\n\n\"You got to understand cinema in that purview and appreciate the art of cinema rather than extremist issues and attaching that to cinema. That is not the function of cinema. You might think that it is going to change. Nothing changes in the world because of cinema,\" Menon told in an interview.\n\nThe actor most recently featured in Hotstar Special show 'Special Ops'. The action-packed spy thriller series has been co-directed by Neeraj Pandey and Shivam Nair.\n\nHe essayed the role of senior analyst and logistics head at the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) Himmat Singh who for the past 19 years has been tracking a terrorist mastermind that no one believes even exists.\n\nSingh's team comprises of officers from different faiths who are equally dedicated to eradicate the menace of terrorism.\n\nMenon believes it is the people who should be held accountable for their actions and not their religion.\n\n\"It is about good people verses bad, it has nothing to do with religion. There are good people existing in every form of life and bad people also.\n\n\"Whatever are the events in the series you take the factual elements and then you create fiction around it. This is pure storytelling and it has nothing to do with anything else,\" he added.\n\nAs for the show, the actor credits Pandey and Nair for creating an intriguing world weaved with several twists and turns.\n\n\"Acting is a symbiotic process, it is an amalgamation of many many things put together and when there is a call for action, that's when you surrender and the moment of truth comes out, that's when you perform. That is the process for every good actor...\n\n\"Web-series doesn't require stars; you need to be a performer to sustain that kind of duration. Web series is an outing that is favourable to actors.\"\n\nMenon's character is a man who is both sharp and intelligent but there is also a lighter side to his personality.\n\n\"When I read the entire script I found him tongue-in-cheek in certain areas. He has a sense of humour in which you convey your message and that is the best way to have a conversation even if you oppose someone. If you have a little nice chaste and positive sense of humour then the matter is understood much more.\n\n\"However, my character is completely vulnerable when he is at home. He is awkward in handling it and doesn't know how to handle things while he can handle the country and security,\" the actor said.\n\nThere have been comparisons drawn between \"Special Ops\" and Manoj Bajpayee's spy drama \"The Family Man\" but Menon said both the shows are completely different\".\n\n\"This ('Special Ops') is a typical espionage spy thriller in which the focus is more on the espionage and how and what happens and the nitty-gritties.\n\n\"No two love stories are the same though the love factor might be the same. In the world there are eight to nine concepts on which stories can be made and how you implement it makes a difference,\" Menon said."
