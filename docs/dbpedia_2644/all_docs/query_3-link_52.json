        "text": "Always an A-\"KK\"-tor, Never a Celebrity\n\nKK Menon is an actor who is well known among cinema aficionados for his impeccable performance in films like Shaurya, Rahasya and Haider. With an array of diverse roles under his filmography, KK Mennon molds himself perfectly with the requirements of the film.\n\nA picture of the ever charismatic Kay Kay Menon (Source- deccanchronicle.com)\n\nKrishna Kumar Menon was born on 2nd October 1966 in Kerala. He was raised in Pune and later worked in the advertising industry. During this time he developed a penchant for theatre and adopted the very popular stage name – Kay Kay Menon. His dynamic personality and acting prowess landed him a role opposite the famous thespian Naseeruddin Shah in Feroz Abbas Khan's play \"Mahatma vs Gandhi\". After this he slowly climbed the ladder like any genuine actor does who hails from a strong theatre background – he started appearing in numerous TV serials and telefilms where he was popularly applauded by critics for his unusual height and acting capacities.\n\n\"Mera maqsat yeh nahi hai ki main cinema main ayu, khub paise kamau, cinema ek alag madhyam hai, uss madhyam ko main explore karna chahunga aur usme kuch cheez aisa karna chahunga jo rehe jaye\"\n\nThese were his exact words in an interview and I believe these words perfectly sum up KK Menon's career in films.\n\nHe is not bothered about the perfect dance step to a peppy item song, he doesn't care about his packs popping out in a certain neither does he think about the number of zeroes that would be added in his paycheque. He believed in \"l'art pour l'art\" (art for art's sake) and he wanted that his roles and characters stand the test of time and to a large extent he is hugely successful in his attempt. Although inspired by Jack Nicholson in \"A Few Good Men\", KK Menon as Major Rajput in Shaurya is a character who is etched in the minds of film buffs. He added an Indian taste to a loved and legendary character of Hollywood, this was an extremely challenging task for an actor.\n\nKK Menon always preferred unconventional roles with unconventional directors such as Anurag Kashyap, Saeed Mirza, Vishal Bhardwaj and Sudhir Mishra. However, KK Menon, early film career was rocky, to say the least. After a small role in \"Naseem\", he was an actor who was mostly neglected or overlooked. His film \"Paanch\" directed by Anurag Kashyap still remains unreleased to this date due to censorship issues but KK Menon was determined to stick to his principles and ideals.\n\nIt was around the 2000s with the release of two momentous films that KK Menon started to gain clout and his potential was realised by a film industry that only focuses on glitz and glamour. These films were of course \"Sarkar\" and \"Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi\". His role as an adulterous husband in the 2007 cult classic film \"Life in a…Metro\" still sparks passionate discussion among film lovers. However, it was his performance as Khurram Mir in Haider, an adaptation of Hamlet, that won him the Filmfare and IIFA award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nIt is indeed rare to have such a dedication towards one craft which KK Menon so effortlessly does in almost all his films. Even within a ruthless industry like Bollywood, he has skillfully carved out his own creative niche which will definitely stand the test of time."
