        "text": "It’s pretty hard to believe the fact that it has been over 15 years since Shahid Kapoor made his Bollywood debut with the movie Ishq Vishk. While the film may not have set the box office on fire, it became a memorable one for many as it brought Shahid Kapoor into their lives. Granted, at that point in time most of them were teenage girls, but the film showed that Shahid Kapoor had a lot to offer other than his chocolate boy persona. Shahid Kapoor’s career in the film industry has been nothing short of a roller coaster ride as the films that followed his debut hit didn’t exactly complement his talent. Three years and seven flops later, Shahid was back with a bang with the 2006 blockbuster Vivah. He followed that with Imtiaz Ali’s Jab We Met in 2007 which really took him into the big league and in 2009, he proved that he is so much more than the romantic hero with Vishal Bhardwaj’s Kaminey. So, on his birthday, let's take a look at five of the most memorable Shahid Kapoor’s Movies.\n\n1. Jab We Met (2007)\n\n2. Kaminey (2009)\n\n3. Haider (2014)\n\n4. Udta Punjab (2016)\n\n5. Padmaavat (2018)\n\n6. Kabir Singh (2019)\n\n7. Jersey (2022)\n\n8. Farzi (2023)\n\n1. Jab We Met (2007)\n\nDirector: Imtiaz Ali\n\nCast: Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor Khan\n\nNow, let’s be honest, who can really resist a good love story? And with Jab We Met, Imtiaz Ali gives you just that. Come to think of it, nothing in the movie really makes it stand out from the romantic comedies in Bollywood, however, the film still felt so natural and relatable. It’s the film’s first hour or so that wins you over with its simple charm, its immensely likable characters, and the intrinsic humour in the writing. The real hero of the film however was the performance of the two leads.\n\nThey seize your attention right from the moment they appear on the screen. Shahid plays a rich businessman’s son Aditya Kashyap, who succumbs to the pressure of running his business empire after his father’s death and decides to run away. On his train ride, he bumps into Geet (Kareena Kapoor Khan), a Punjabi girl on her way back to her home in Punjab. From the very first second, it was apparent that the difference in their personalities is like night and day.\n\nAfter Geet ends up missing her train, the responsibility of getting her back home safely falls on the shoulders of Aditya. During the course of their journey, they grow close to each other and later realise they’re in love. The dialogue of the film ensures that there is never a dull moment for the audience. While Shahid Kapoor had the risk of being overshadowed by Kareena’s bubbly character in the film, it didn’t turn out to be that way. His understated and mature performance as Aditya Kashyap leaves a lasting impression on you.\n\n2. Kaminey (2009)\n\nDirector: Vishal Bhardwaj\n\nCast: Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra\n\nVishal Bhardwaj's films are generally masterfully crafted, whether it's the high production values, the narrative style, the superb acting or the beautiful music and Kaminey was no exception. Vishal Bhardwaj’s attention to detail has always been top notch and he really came through with Kaminey once again. He used the best technical advances, insisted on composing the music and background score for the film and was thoroughly involved in the process of writing the dialogues. While they might not be major factors individually, together they combine to make a unique experience for the viewer. Kaminey is about two estranged twin brothers, both of whom are slightly (and funnily) limited. One of them lisps while the other stammers.\n\nThe film has an incredibly twisted plot that gets more and more clear as the film moves forward thanks to little flashbacks and confessions from time to time. It depicts a world of drugs, gangsters, murder and crime. The twin characters are very well written and defined. Charlie is a guy who lives life as if there was no tomorrow. He is cruel and carefree. Guddu is a simple guy who has his feet on the ground and hopes for a future with the love of his life Sweety (Priyanka Chopra). If with Jab We Met, Shahid Kapoor showed that he can carry a film on his own, Kaminey showed that two of him are better than one. He plays both his parts with such brilliance that it's hard to see that it’s the same actor. Kaminey is messy yet beautifully so, it is dark yet artistically so. It has hilarious comedy, emotional drama, and many great moments.\n\n3. Haider (2014)\n\nDirector: Vishal Bhardwaj\n\nCast: Shahid Kapoor, Shraddha Kapoor, Tabu and Kay Kay Menon\n\nEver since it was announced that Shahid Kapoor and Vishal Bhardwaj will be teaming up once again after Kaminey, people naturally had high expectations from the two and boy did they deliver! Riding on two horses at one time is never easy but Vishal Bhardwaj did just that as he successfully was able to deliver a brilliant adaptation of Shakespeare’s Hamlet while giving us a glimpse of the tense political scenario in Kashmir. In fact, the backdrop of Kashmir works perfectly to depict this Shakespeare tragedy as Vishal Bhardwarj makes use of dark humour to portray the hopelessness of the state currently. Haider (Kapoor) arrives in his Kashmiri village he left long ago to study at Aligarh after his father, a doctor, disappeared. His mother Ghazala (Tabu) is romantically close to his father's younger brother (Kay Kay Menon). Arshi (Shraddha Kapoor), his childhood sweetheart, is torn between her pro-Indian establishment family and Haider, who is devastated to see his mother's sudden transformation.\n\nAs his idyllic childhood with parents seemingly in love is shattered, things take a sudden twist when Roohdar (Irrfan Khan), a mysterious man sends him a message from his lost father, that sets him on a destructive path of jealousy, hatred, turmoil and doubt. Shahid’s performance in the film as Haider received praise from critics as well as the audience. Playing an actor based on one of Shakespeare’s most complex works is a tall ask but he does so with impressive sincerity. He manages to shift between the many moods skillfully and successfully is able to portray the many emotions that his character is going through. His monologue towards the end of the film gives us enough proof of the massive potential that he’s capable of.\n\n4. Udta Punjab (2016)\n\nDirector: Abhishek Chaubey\n\nCast: Shahid Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Diljit Dosanjh\n\nTo date, Bollywood has mostly showcased Punjab as the land of prosperity filled with dancing farmers in fields and big-time foodies relishing their sarson da sag & make di roti. However, with Udta Punjab, we were treated to a completely different portrayal of the state. The film showed that the land known for its lush green fields has off late been trapped tight in clutches of narcotics. In the film, we see three stories that run in parallel before converging as we near the climax.\n\nEven in a film like this, it is very easy to make the consumption of drugs ‘seem’ cool. However, director Abhishek Chaubey isn’t interested in making things easy or pretty. While Shahid Kapoor already proved his worth by delivering stellar performances in Haider and Kaminey, with Udta Punjab, he only raised the bar higher.\n\nHe is successful in the portrayal of Tommy Singh, a gabru rap star full of madness who also has a side of remorse and guilt for his actions.\n\n5. Padmaavat (2018)\n\nDirector: Sanjay Leela Bhansali\n\nCast: Ranveer Singh, Shahid Kapoor and Deepika Padukone\n\nJust like any other Bhansali film, Padmaavat tries to pull you into a world of its own. The lavish sets, intricately detailed costumes and stunning visual effects make Padmaavat a visual treat for its viewers. Add to that a star-studded cast of Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone and Shahid Kapoor and you’ve got a winner on your hands. Padmaavat revolved around ruler Alauddin Khilji’s (Ranveer Singh) obsession with Rani Padmavati (Deepika Padukone).\n\nPadmavati was the wife of Maharaja Ratan Singh (Shahid Kapoor), a courageous warrior and king of a massive Rajput empire. Khilji’s obsession with making Rani Padmavati his even pushed him into a battleground against the Rajputs. Even though his role in the film may not have been as impactful as his colleagues, Shahid’s understated portrayal of Maharawal Ratan Singh won him massive praise all over. The film faced several problems before its release, however, once it did hit the screens, it set the cash registers ringing from the word go!\n\n6. Kabir Singh (2019)\n\nDirector: Sandeep Reddy Vanga\n\nCast: Shahid Kapoor, Kiara Advani\n\nShahid plays an alcoholic surgeon in Arjun Reddy's version of Kabir Singh who turns to self-destruction after his girlfriend Preeti, played by Kiara Advani, leaves him to marry someone else. Vijay Deverakonda's original portrayal of the title character in the Telugu movie was flawlessly portrayed by Shahid, who was once again nominated for Best Actor at the Filmfare Awards. Shahid's commitment to fully embodying the role captured a million hearts as well.\n\n7. Jersey (2022)\n\nDirector: Gowtam Tinnanuri\n\nCast: Shahid Kapoor, Mrunal Thakur, Pankaj Kapur\n\nJersey tells the story of a particularly gifted Ranji player named Arjun Talwar (Shahid Kapoor), who quits cricket at the age of 26 and decides to pick up the sport again ten years later. Arjun aims to accomplish this while also granting Kitu's wishes for a jersey and a chance to watch his father play cricket. Arjun has emotional upheaval and conflicts with his wife Vidya Talwar, who is responsible for all of the family's financial obligations, along with this journey. As the dissatisfied and powerless Arjun Talwar, who has been written off by everyone, Shahid Kapoor gives an amazing performance. Shahid does the part with the necessary maturity and restraint, subtly displaying his emotions while stifling the roaring volcano inside.\n\n8. Farzi (2023)\n\nDirector: Raj & DK\n\nCast: Shahid Kapoor, Vijay Sethupathi, Kay Kay Menon, Raashii Khanna\n\nThe world is fueled by money. The protagonist of Farzi is an extraordinarily talented but struggling artist. Farzi is set in post-demonetization India. By creating his own money, he pokes fun at a system that is at the mercy of the rich and powerful. The ensuing war of attrition serves as the backbone of a beautifully written and performed television series. In his first role for a streaming service, Shahid Kapoor plays Sunny, a talented street artist who creates imitations of famous artists like Vincent van Gogh and delivers five-minute paintings for pennies on the dollar. He feels that he merits better. In the lead part, Shahid Kapoor sinks his teeth in and gives a performance that is notable for its persevering restraint."
