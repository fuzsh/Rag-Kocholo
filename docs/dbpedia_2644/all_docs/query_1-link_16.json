        "text": "Kay Kay Menon is among the most versatile actors in Indian cinema. On his 54th birthday, here's a list of some of his impeccable roles. An adaptation of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Haider (2014) is directed by Vishal Bhardwaj. While Shahid Kapoor is seen in the titular role, Kay Kay Menon's performance was applauded by the audience. In the role of Khurram Meer, the man behind the conspiracy, Kay Kay gave the word sinister, a totally new meaning.\n\nKay Kay Menon played the role of Dukey Banna in Anurag Kashyap’s Gulaal (2009). The actor perfectly portrayed the ruthlessness and cunningness of a politician. He treats people like the pawns in a game of chess. With his acting abilities, Kay Kay yet again proved that he is able to express any emotion with an ease on the screen.\n\nAmong the various reasons for which people remember Shaurya (2008) Kay Kay Menon's performance tops the list. The actor played the role of Brigadier Rudra Pratap Singh. Based on A Few Good Men, Shaurya is directed by Samar Khan. The film is a courtroom drama where a Muslim army man is accused of killing his Hindu superior.\n\nIn Anurag Kashyap's Black Friday, Kay Kay Menon played the role of Mumabi Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria. The film narrates the story of the Bombay bomb blasts of 1993. It is based on Hussain Zaidi's book, Black Friday: The True Story of the Bombay Bomb Blasts\n\nDirected by Anurag Basu, Life In A Metro (2007) is about relationships in a metropolitan city. Kay Kay Menon plays a husband who is in an extramarital affair with one of his colleagues. However, when he gets to know about his wife's closeness with another man, he cannot tolerate. It’s a classic portrayal of a chauvinistic man and Kay Kay Menon performed it aptly.\n\nHazaaron Khwaishein Aisi (2005) tells the story of three individuals Siddharth, Geeta, and Vikram, who struggle to make their lives better in the troubled time of 70s. Directed by Sudhir Mishra, the film is the story of changing ideologies under adverse situations."
