        "text": "The last time Shahid Kapoor starred in a remake of a South Indian movie (for those who need reminding, the film was Kabir Singh), it was quite a sensation, to say the least. And, after watching the Jersey trailer, one can say that it’s set to be another Shahid Kapoor sensation at the box office. As you wait for Jersey to release, here are some Shahid Kapoor movies to binge on as the anticipation is going to be high after watching the Jersey trailer.\n\nJersey trailer: 5 best Shahid Kapoor performances to watch while you wait for the film\n\n1. Kabir Singh – Netflix\n\nOur obvious first recommendation for a binge would be Kabir Singh, which was released in 2019, and was the Hindi remake of a 2017 Telugu film, Arjun Reddy featuring South superstar Vijay Deverakonda in the titular role. Despite coming under the public spotlight for its misogynistic undertones, the film went on to become the biggest hit of Shahid Kapoor’s career. Not to mention, all the super popular songs the film gave us.\n\n2. Jab We Met – Netflix\n\nAnother one of many great Shahid Kapoor performances, Jab We Met was actually one superhit movie that transformed Kapoor’s image as a chocolate boy image to a more mature actor. We’re certain you’re aware of the synopsis of this film already. And maybe have watched it a few times too. But then again Shahid’s excellent characterisation makes the film a binge for almost any day.\n\n3. Udta Punjab – Netflix\n\nAbhishek Chaubey’s Udta Punjab is among Shahid Kapoor’s career’s most memorable performances. The plot, while highlighting Punjab’s rampant drug abuse problem, follows Shahid Kapoor as Tejinder “Tommy” Singh. He’s a musician, who succumbs to drugs which triggers a chain of events.\n\n4. Haider – Netflix\n\nStarring Shahid Kapoor and Tabu in the lead roles, with Kay Kay Menon, Shraddha Kapoor and Irrfan Khan in supporting roles, Haider, set in Kashmir is a brilliant modern-day adaptation of William Shakespeare’s Hamlet. Of course, Shahid Kapoor’s famous monologue comes to mind at the very mention of this film, but there’s not a single frame in this Vishal Bhardwaj directorial that will disappoint you.\n\n5. Kaminey – Netflix\n\nKaminey is another of the many Vishal Bhardwaj directorial that was a big hit when it was released. The film is set against the backdrop of a Mafia-dominated era in Mumbai and follows the rivalry between a pair of twin brothers, one with a lisp and the other with a stutter, who find a guitar case loaded with cocaine worth millions. The twins are played by Shahid Kapoor."
