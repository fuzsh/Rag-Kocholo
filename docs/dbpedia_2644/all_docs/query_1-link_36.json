        "text": "If you loved Raj & DK’s work and if you enjoyed The Family Man, then chances are that you’ve probably already binge-watched Farzi on Prime Video over the weekend.\n\nAs the name suggests, the high voltage drama series is another great story with police and a bad guy playing a 'cat & mouse' chase game. While South superstar Vijay Sethupathi is playing a cop named Michael, Shahid is the con artist named Sunny.\n\nIt’s currently one of the best shows on OTT and fans are already waiting for season 2. A good script and great direction with a stellar star cast obviously comes with a price tag. Here’s a look at how many crores were charged by the actors for this show:\n\nShahid Kapoor\n\nInitial reports claimed that the actor had initially asked for over Rs 35 crores for playing the lead on the show. However, post the failure of Jersey, it was reported that he was paid around Rs 30 crores for his OTT debut.\n\nVijay Sethupathi\n\nThe superstar also made his OTT debut as Michael, the hard working cop struggling to make his marriage work. While he’s a parallel lead in this thriller, he was paid around Rs 7 crores for the role. Vijay will also be seen in Jawan with SRK in action.\n\nKay Kay Menon\n\nHe brilliantly played the baddie Mansoor, who is literally ‘chilling like a villain’ on the show. Kay Kay’s character is the kingpin of counterfeiting and on the ‘most wanted’ list for the cops. He was reportedly paid around Rs 2.5 crores for the role.\n\nRaashi Khanna\n\nThe actress plays Megha, an honest RBI officer who is passionate about tackling the problem of fake currency in the country. Her character’s storyline is pretty interesting and the actress was reportedly paid around Rs 1.5 crores for the role.\n\nPost the dramatic climax of the first season, the audience is now waiting for the makers to drop some details around the second season."
