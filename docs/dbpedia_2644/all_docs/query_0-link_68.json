        "text": "I updated my list of Bollywood movies on Heera with two exciting new additions to the catalog. The 2017 movies Begum Jaan and Hindi Medium (which I loved) are now available for streaming. Both films got small theatrical releases in the United States, so this is a great opportunity to catch up on movies that were easy to miss. Better yet, watch them for free with Heera’s free 7-day trial.\n\nI also updated my list of Bollywood movies on Netflix with more than twenty additions to the catalog, a mix of previously available titles and stuff brand new to the service. I’ve reviewed many of the films, including (click on the star-rating for my review):\n\nAjab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani — ★★★\n\nAnkhon Dekhi — ★★★★\n\nDedh Ishqiya — ★★★★\n\nThe Dirty Picture — ★★★\n\nHunterrr — ★★\n\nIshqiya — ★★★★\n\nPlayers — ★★★\n\nShahid — ★★★★\n\nShortkut: The Con Is On -— ★★\n\nAlong with the Malayalam film Toymaker, the other Hindi movies added to Netflix today are Aankhen, Amrapali, Bheja Fry 2, Big Brother, Dashavatar: Every Era Has a Hero, Ishq Viskh, Lal Patthar, Liar’s Dice, Masti, Professor, Sarkar, and Yaar Gaddar. In the last month, Netflix has added almost fifty new Indian titles to its streaming catalog!

Azmi’s assassination while defending an innocent man against terrorism charges embodies the personal and social costs of choosing quick, easy solutions at the expense of the truth.\n\nRajkummar Rao plays Shahid, whose own past mirrors the lives of the men he defends in court. As a teen, Shahid witnesses the gruesome murders of his neighbors in a religious riot in his Muslim neighborhood. Feeling powerless, he joins a militant Islamist training camp, only to flee after a few months.\n\nUpon his return home, Shahid is arrested when his name is found in a terrorist’s diary. Torture and coercion at the hands of the police result in Shahid’s imprisonment for seven years.\n\nIn jail, Shahid finds his calling. Two fellow prisoners — a kindly professor and a reformed militant — recognize Shahid’s intelligence and steer him away from the terror recruiters in the jail. Professor Saxena (Yusuf Hussain) tutors Shahid and War Saab (Kay Kay Menon, who is delightful in every scene) finances Shahid’s studies.\n\nOn the outside, Shahid finishes his law degree and discovers how easy it is to manipulate the legal system. Shahid’s first case of note involves a computer repair man named Zaheer who lends his laptop to a friend. Unbeknownst to Zaheer, the friend uses the laptop to plan a terror attack, and Zaheer is implicated in the crime.\n\nDespite having no direct evidence tying Zaheer to the crime, the prosecutor, More (Vipin Sharma), drags the trial on for years. Shahid’s persistence results in Zaheer’s eventual release and earns Shahid a reputation as a defender of unjustly persecuted Muslims. Shahid himself is violently targeted while defending a man wrongly accused of participating in the Mumbai terror attacks of November 26, 2008.\n\nWhat stands out in the two trials depicted in the film — the real Shahid earned seventeen acquittals in his brief career — is how weak the state’s cases are. More’s stalling tactics are outrageous. In the second case, the prosecutor’s arguments are easily disproved.\n\nWhy would a government spend so much time and money to convict innocent men when those resources could’ve been spent trying to catch the real perpetrators? The prosecutor in the second case, Tambe (Shalini Vaste), reveals the answer when she says that even citizens who weren’t personally endangered during the attacks now feel scared in their own homes. The government needs to convict someone — anyone — so that the people will feel safe again.\n\nAs flawed as the justice system is, its agents aren’t depicted as monsters. Prosecutor More has one of the sweetest moments in the film. Following an intense argument with Shahid, More spies a sandwich in Shahid’s briefcase and tries to goad the young lawyer into splitting it with him, dissolving Shahid into giggles.\n\nShahid himself is far from perfect. He’s a lousy husband to his wife, Mariam (Prabhleen Sandhu), a former client. He refuses to address the persistent threats made against him, keeping his family in the dark even though their lives are in danger, too.\n\nThe character closest to perfect is Shahid’s devoted brother, Arif (Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, who’s great in the film). Arif covers for Shahid when he joins the militants and encourages him to study law, even if it means Arif must support the family financially by himself. When Arif finally blows up at Shahid, it seems deserved.\n\nDirector Hansal Mehta uses the camera to emphasize how the justice system can diminish an individual. During Shahid’s initial interrogation, he huddles on the floor naked, the camera positioned at the ceiling to make him appear tiny compared to the police officer towering above him. In his first difficult days in prison, Shahid tells Arif to stop coming to visit him. Arif is fully in focus while Shahid stands behind a screen, the camera partially fulfilling Shahid’s wish to fade into obscurity.\n\nRao navigates skillfully through all the ups and downs in Shahid’s life. Rao’s infectious smile comes to Shahid’s face easily and often during the character’s first trial and initial courtship of Maryam. As the story progresses and the cycle of unjust imprisonment of innocent men persists, Shahid’s smile all but disappears.\n\nLinks\n\nShahid at Wikipedia\n\nShahid at IMDb\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nUpdate: I initially thought this was a typo, but apparently the AMC South Barrington 30 is showing Satya 2 this weekend. Ram Gopal Varma postponed the release of the film in India until November 8, so enjoy the preview, South Barrington!\n\n—\n\nThe new comedy Mickey Virus opens in the Chicago area on October 25, 2013. While I hope the movie is good, given that it lacks even minor stars, I expect its stay in U.S. theaters to be brief.\n\nMickey Virus opens on Friday at the Big Cinemas Golf Glen 5 in Niles, AMC South Barrington 30 in South Barrington, and Regal Cantera Stadium 17 in Warrenville. Its runtime is variously listed as two hours and 2 hrs. 30 min.\n\nAkshay Kumar’s Boss carries over for a second week at all of the above theaters. The Golf Glen 5 is also carrying over Shahid, which is a surprise given that it only earned $12,153 total from the sixteen U.S. theaters that carried it last weekend.\n\nOther Indian movies showing in the Chicago area this weekend include Singaravelan (Malayalam) and Zinda Bhaag (Punjabi) at the Golf Glen 5; Bhai (Telugu) at the Muvico Rosemont 18 in Rosemont; and Atharintiki Daredi (Telugu) at the Cinemark at Seven Bridges in Woodridge.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe relatively low-budget biographical drama Shahid opens in Chicago area theaters on October 18, 2013. This is something of a surprise given that Akshay Kumar’s Boss just released on the 16th. But considering that I was the only person in a 592-capacity theater for yesterday’s first showing of Boss, this is probably a good move by the makers of Shahid.\n\nShahid opens on Friday at the Big Cinemas Golf Glen 5 in Niles and AMC South Barrington 30 in South Barrington. (Update: For my fellow non-Hindi speakers, the print at the South Barrington 30 cuts off the English subtitles at the bottom of the screen. Looks like I’ll have to wait for Shahid on DVD.) It has a listed runtime of 1 hr. 45 min.\n\nAfter opening Wednesday, Boss gets its first full weekend at both of the above theaters, plus the Regal Cantera Stadium 17 in Warrenville.\n\nThe only theater giving a third week to Besharam is the South Barrington 30. Ouch.\n\nOther Indian movies showing in the Chicago area this weekend include Singaravelan (Malayalam), Vanakkam Chennai (Tamil), and Pakistan’s submission to this year’s Oscars, Zinda Bhaag (Punjabi), at the Golf Glen 5; Atharintiki Daaredi (Telugu) and Ramayya Vasthavayya (Telugu) at both the Cinemark Century Stratford Square in Bloomingdale and Cinemark at Seven Bridges in Woodridge; and Doosukeltha (Telugu) at the Muvico Rosemont 18 in Rosemont, which is also carrying Ramayya Vasthavayya.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
