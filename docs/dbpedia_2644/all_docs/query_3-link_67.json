        "text": "He is currently busy promoting his forthcoming film \"Vodka Diaries\", which is set in Manali. In the film, ACP Ashwini Dixit (Kay Kay) is in quest to solve a series of mysterious murders happening over a single night which seem to be connected to a night club, Vodka Diaries.\n\nTalking about the film content, Kay Kay said on Saturday: \"When you watch other kind of films and don't get bored, then I feel that if you see a content-driven film then it will be good for your mental and emotional health.\n\nThe most important thing for him while working in a movie is the \"maturity of script\". \"The film's script should be such that it should inspire you to work in that film.\"\n\n\"I don't analyse much before selecting a movie. I feel if you have an attraction towards a script, then you go with the flow with the script,\" he added.\n\n\"Vodka Diaries\" was shot in Himachal Pradesh. On his shooting experience, he said: \"Working in cold conditions was tough because we didn't have the luxury to wear those kind of clothes (winter wear).\""
