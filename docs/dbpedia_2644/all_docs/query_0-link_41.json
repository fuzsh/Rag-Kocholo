The motion poster featured the lead cast of the series, Shahid Kapoor, Vijay Sethupathi, Kay Kay Menon, and Raashii Khanna standing in line as the title gets highlighted towards the end.\n\nTheir enigmatic presence and fiery looks surely raise the stakes and it will be exciting to see these actors portraying complex characters, adding layers to the narrative. The official Twitter handle of Amazon Prime Video shared the motion poster and wrote, “blurring the lines between Asli and Farzi from here on (sic)” with an emoticon of money.\n\nMORE ABOUT FARZI"
