        "text": "Prime Video has set a global premiere date for “Citadel: Honey Bunny,” the Indian instalment of the “Citadel” franchise. The series stars Varun Dhawan and Samantha in lead roles.\n\nThe Indian series born from the world of “Citadel” is directed by Raj & DK (Raj Nidimoru and Krishna D.K.) and written by Sita R. Menon, along with Raj & DK. The series is produced by D2R Films, Amazon MGM Studios, and executive produced by the Russo Brothers‘ AGBO.\n\nAnthony Russo, Joe Russo, Angela Russo-Otstot and Scott Nemes from AGBO, alongside David Weil (“Hunters”), executive produce “Citadel: Honey Bunny” and all the series within the world of “Citadel”. Midnight Radio is also an executive producer.\n\nThe ensemble cast includes Kay Kay Menon, Simran, Saqib Saleem, Sikandar Kher, Soham Majumdar, Shivankit Parihar and Kashvi Majmundar.\n\nPrime Video unveiled the premiere date at a fan event in Mumbai, where it also released a teaser for the series. “Citadel: Honey Bunny” is described as blending elements of a spy action thriller with a love story, set against a 1990s backdrop.\n\nNikhil Madhok, head of originals at Prime Video India, said: “The Indian series in the world of ‘Citadel’ blends the charm of the ’90s with an immersive narrative and truly captivating performances by Samantha as Honey, Varun as Bunny, and the entire ensemble cast. The fictional series will take the audience back to the genesis of this international clandestine spy-agency, delving further into its foundation, activities, influence, and rise in the distinctive and sensational signature of Raj & DK that the audience has come to love, enjoy and admire.”\n\nSamantha previously starred in Season 2 of Raj & DK’s Prime Video series “The Family Man,” while Menon played a crucial role in their “Farzi,” also a Prime Video series.\n\nRaj & DK said: “‘Citadel: Honey Bunny’ is a swashbuckling blend of gritty, fast-paced action and compelling drama with exceptional performances. We are excited to introduce Varun as an edgy action hero. And Samantha has upped her action game to the next level. We are also thrilled to have joined with the powerhouse Kay Kay Menon once again and are lucky to have an incredible cast.”\n\n“Citadel: Honey Bunny” follows the Italian series “Citadel: Diana” (premiering Oct. 10) in the “Citadel” universe. The original “Citadel” series, starring Richard Madden and Priyanka Chopra Jonas, premiered in 2023. A second season of the series is set to begin production this year, with Joe Russo directing.\n\nNov. 7 has been set as the global premiere date for “Citadel: Honey Bunny.”"
