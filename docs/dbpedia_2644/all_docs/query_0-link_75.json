        "text": "Following their 2009 criminal drama Kaminey, Shahid Kapoor and Vishal Bhardwaj teamed up once more in 2014 for the drama Haider, which is set in Kashmir and is based on Hamlet by William Shakespeare. The actor won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor after receiving significant appreciation for his portrayal of the movie's title character.\n\nShahid Kapoor recently discussed his intention to work on Haider for free in an interview. The actor explained in an interview, \"They couldn’t afford me. They said if they had to pay me, then the budget of the film wouldn’t get sanctioned because it was a very experimental subject. They really didn’t know if it would land at all but it was a very compelling kind of product to make and so I said, ‘Yeah, I will do it for free'.\"\n\nWhen the actor was asked if he has acted in any of his other projects without taking his fees, he stated, \"It was the only time I did it. It just happened at that time\", and laughingly added, \"Ghar bhi chalana hai.\"\n\nHaider, which also stars Tabu, Kay Kay Menon, Shraddha Kapoor, and Irrfan Khan, is one of the most well-liked movies of the past decade. Moreover, the film also received several National Awards.\n\nShahid Kapoor will next be seen opposite Kriti Sanon in an untitled romance drama. The movie, which is being produced by Dinesh Vijan, Jyoti Deshpande, and Laxman Utekar and is being directed by Amit Joshi and Aradhana Sah, is set to open in theatres on December 7 of this year."
