In a recent media interview, Kay Kay Menon who will next be seen in Shahid Kapoorâ€™s streaming debut series Farzi had a thrilling experience while shooting for the series as he was treading in unknown territory as a performing artiste.

Talking about his part in the series, the actor shared, "I have been fortunate to get such varied roles to play in the digital space. My character in Farzi is outlandish and has his own swag. Very interesting for an actor to push the act to the edge and yet keep consistency throughout. I thoroughly enjoyed it as it's something that you, as a performer, are not quite sure of and you look at your directors' reaction eagerly after every take to see if you have hit the note each time."

The actor further heaped praise on the director duo as he called them one of the finest directors, "Farzi is a one-of-a-kind crime thriller created by one of the finest directors Raj & DK. It was amazing to collaborate with them and work with such a talented pool of actors on this project. I can't wait for the launch of the series and to see the audience's response to it."

Directed by Raj and DK, the eight-episode crime thriller series will premiere on Prime Video on February 10 onwards.
