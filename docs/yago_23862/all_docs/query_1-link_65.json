        "text": "LYING side by side in a plain closed\n\nrailway wagon, the bodies of King\n\nFrancis II, the last sovereign of the\n\nKingdom of the Two Sicilies, and his\n\nQueen, Maria Sophia of Wittelsbach,\n\nwhose brief reign in Naples was cut\n\nshort by the final unification of Italy\n\nunder the House of Savoy, reached\n\nRome recently and were carried to the\n\nchurch of San Spirito de'Napoletani\n\n(writes the Rome correspondent of the\n\n\"Times Weekly\"). Only a few Neapoli-\n\ntan noblemen escorted the coffins.\n\nThe bodies rested on a, catafalque in\n\nthe crypt of the church, where they\n\nwere interred early in January in two\n\ntombs which were prepared in the crypt\n\nnear that of their only child, the in-\n\nfant Princesa Marie Cristina Pia. The\n\ntwo exiles were thus reunited with the\n\n\"sole consolation\" of their first years\n\nof exile, and are now surrounded by\n\nmany of the illustrious nobles of their\n\nCourt who attended them from Gaeta to\n\nRome, there to die between 1862 and\n\n1869 and receive burial in the church\n\nwhich is above all others dear to the\n\nNeapolitans, to whom it was presented\n\nby the Pope in 1572.\n\nThe King, who died in 1894 while on\n\na visit to Austria, was buried at Arco,\n\nthen in Austrian territory, and now in\n\nthe Italian Trentino, and his body has\n\nbeen lying for many years in the fam-\n\nily tomb of the Counts Consolati at\n\nTrent. Queen Maria Sophia died in\n\n1925 at Munich, where she was buried.\n\nThe final decision to bring their re-\n\nmains to Italy is believed to have been\n\nmade easier by the recent marriage of\n\nthe Duke of Ancona, a cousin of the\n\nKing of Italy, and Princess Lucia,\n\ndaughter of the Duke of Calabria, the\n\npresent head of that branch of the\n\nHouse of Bourbon which used to reign\n\nin Naples, as it ended the estrangement\n\nbetween tha two dynasties."
