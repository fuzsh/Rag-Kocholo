        "text": "Jaime de Borbón-Dos Sicilias Landaluce and Charlotte Lindesay-Bethune, will marry in Palermo (Italy) and the date is September 25. Jaime, who holds the title of Duke of Noto, will marry in one of the cathedrals of the Sicilian city and the subsequent celebration will take place in the Royal Palace of Palermo, which was home to the Bourbon-Two Sicilies in times past.\n\nhttps://www.vanitatis.elconfidencia...bon-dos-sicilias-fecha-lugar-leandro_3135459/\n\nIt's probably this cathedral:\n\nhttps://www.vanitatis.elconfidencia...bon-dos-sicilias-fecha-lugar-leandro_3135459/\n\nI am surprised about the location as all his aunts married at La Toledana, but as he will be the head of the house of the Two Sicilies eventually, the location does make sense. Also as his great-grandparents (the count of Paris and Isabelle of Orleans-Bragança) married in the same city.\n\nAs it is in Palermo I suspect attendance by the King and Queen is less certain.\n\nI am surprised about the location as all his aunts married at La Toledana, but as he will be the head of the house of the Two Sicilies eventually, the location does make sense.

Princess Ines married in Toledo and if i remember right Princess Victoria also married not at La Toledana, but his 2 oldest aunts did. But it is the first Wedding of a member of the Bourbon-Two Sicilies Family in their former Kingdom since a lot of years if not the first since the reunification of Italy.\n\nI also guess that the attendance of the King and Queen of Spain is unlikely given the location, perhaps Queen Sofia or Infanta Elena will attend. If i remember right the spanish Borbon-Sicilian's are also befriended with Infanta Cristina\n\nI also guess that the attendance of the King and queen of Spain is unlikely given the location, perhaps Queen Sofia or Infanta Elena will attend. If i remember right the spanish Borbon-Sicilian's are also befriended with Infanta Cristina\n\nPrincess Cristina of Bourbon Two Sicilies is quite close to both the Infantas Elena and Cristina.\n\nQueen Sofia and king Felipe too but I don't know about queen Letizia.\n\nThe Bourbon-Dos Sicilias are not only family, but they have very good relationships.\n\nPrincess Cristina, sister of the Duke of the Duke of Calabria, has been seen many times in the company of her children and Queen Letizia (with her daughters- See the thread of the Billy Elliot musical), and the king is a close friend by Pedro López-Quesada (husband of Cristina de Borbón-Dos Sicilias)\n\nThe problem with Jaime's wedding is that it is in Italy.\n\nThe pandemic will tell whether or not Felipe and Letizia will be able to attend or if they will send someone on their behalf.\n\nI'm doubting that we will see either King Juan Carlos or Infanta Cristina.\n\nI'm not sure if queen Letizia is close to the Borbón-Dos Sicilias family so it could be the king his mother and sister Elena?\n\nI think Infanta Cristina is rather close the the Bourbon-Sicily Family and the Event is not in Spain so it could be that she attends. but i don't think we will see King Felipe or Queen Letizia.\n\nWill be interesting to see who attends from the Orleans relatives\n\nAccording to ¡HOLA! King Felipe VI, Queen Letizia and Queen Sofia will not be present at the wedding.\n\nhttps://www.hola.com/realeza/casa_e...etizia-no-van-boda-jaime-borbon-dos-sicilias/\n\nI think they are not going to attend to the wedding for the volcano's crisis, It's a very grave situation with thousands of evacuated, hundred of people who lost their homes and obviously all their things, the little ones their toys (some of them don't understand what is happening), it's not right time to go to a wedding, even if they are family and close friends, and they will support Felipe and Letizia's decision in this complicated moment for their own country for sure.\n\n(Another possibility has a name: Urdangarín, he could attend to the wedding and this way they avoid yellow press, which it's the best they can do it.)\n\nI think they are not going to attend to the wedding for the volcano's crisis, It's a very grave situation with thousands of evacuated, hundred of people who lost their homes and obviously all their things, the little ones their toys (some of them don't understand what is happening), it's not right time to go to a wedding, even if they are family and close friends, and they will support Felipe and Letizia's decision in this complicated moment for their own country for sure.\n\n(Another possibility has a name: Urdangarín, he could attend to the wedding and this way they avoid yellow press, which it's the best they can do it.)\n\nI don't think they go to the wedding because of the volcano situation. And of course it's the best decision."
