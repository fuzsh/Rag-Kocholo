        "text": "Description\n\nCatherine the Great congratulates King Ferdinand I on the \"triple knot\" union of his children with those of the Holy Roman Emperor\n\nThe most renowned and the longest-ruling female leader of Russia, reigning from July 9, 1762 until her death in 1796 at the age of 67. LS in Cyrillic, signed “Ekaterina,” one page both sides, 10.25 x 15.75, October 7, 1790. Important letter of state in which Catherine the Great congratulates King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies on the marriage of his three children to the three children of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II: Princess Maria Theresa of Naples married the future Emperor Francis II on September 15, 1790; Princess Luisa of Naples married Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany, on August 15, 1790; and Francis I of the Two Sicilies married Archduchess Maria Clementina of Austria on September 19, 1790. In fine condition. This significant \"triple knot\" union all but ensured that one of King Ferdinand's children would become emperor or empress. When Leopold II died in 1792, he was succeeded by Francis II; as his wife, Maria Theresa became the last Holy Roman Empress. A fantastic, interesting letter between European royals.\n\nAuction Info\n\nAuction Title: Fine Autograph and Artifacts\n\nDates: #676 - Ended October 11, 2023\n\nThis item is Pre-Certified by PSA/DNA\n\nBuy a third-party letter of authenticity for $150.00\n\n*This item has been pre-certified by a trusted third-party authentication service, and by placing a bid on this item, you agree to accept the opinion of this authentication service.
