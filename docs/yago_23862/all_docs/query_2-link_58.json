Born to Philip I of Orleáns (P2345, P2369, P2380) and Élisabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, Duchess of Baveria (P2351), he was the grandson of Louis XIII and\n\nQueen Maria Amalia of Saxony\n\nOil on canvas.

The portrait of his young wife reflects his affectionate words and the complicity between the married couple, since appearing in it is the crown that Charles wore in Palermo on the day of his enthronement as King of Naples and Sicily.\n\nBarbara of Braganza, Queen of Spain\n\nOil on canvas. 1725\n\nDuprà, Domenico\n\nBarbara of Braganza was an Infanta of Portugal, daughter of King Juan V of Portugal and of María Ana Josefa, Archduchess of Austria.
