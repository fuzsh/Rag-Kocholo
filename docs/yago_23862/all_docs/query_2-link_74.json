        "text": "The Gay King\n\nHowever, it is widely accepted today that he was gay, or the very least bisexual. There is proof of this in diaries of his as well as letters written by Maria Annunciata directed towards other members of the royal house, most notably Marie Caroline and Alexandra. He was seen the majority of the time with his favourite, Charles Frederick, the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. There have been many reports of them being together and extremely close in parties and balls attended by important people, such as the Royal Cesque Ball of 1796 which was attended by George III, Queen-Consort Charlotte, and their daughter Mary in which a letter shows that Charlotte and Mary had a conversation about him, where Mary showed interest in marrying him but Charlotte replying with Oh darling, only men appeal to him, despite the fact that he met his future wife, Maria Clementina, at that ball.\n\nOthers debate that the only reason he ever got married was to provide an heir to the Cesque throne. Another critical point is that in 1795, King Anthony II, his father, decriminalised homosexuality which some say was due to his sons sexuality."
