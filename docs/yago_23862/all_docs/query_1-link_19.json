        "text": "Prince Antoine of Orléans, Duke of Montpensier (July 31, 1824 – February 4, 1890), was a member of the French royal family from the House of Orléans.\n\nHRH Prince Antoine Marie Philippe Louis d’Orléans was the youngest son of King Louis Philippe of France and his wife Maria Amelia Teresa of the Two Sicilies, the tenth of eighteen children of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria.\n\nPrince Antoine’s grandmother, Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria, the thirteenth child of Holy Roman Emperor Franz I, former Duke of Lorraine and his wife Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, Queen of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia in her own right.\n\nPrince Antoine was styled as HRH The Duke of Montpensier. He was born on July 31, 1824 at the château de Neuilly and died February 4, 1890 at Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Spain.\n\nOn October 10, 1846 at Madrid, Spain, he married Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain, the daughter of King Fernando VII of Spain and his wife Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, the daughter of King Francis I of the Two Sicilies by his second wife, Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain, the youngest daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa of Bourbon-Parma.\n\nPrince Antoine, Duke of Montpensier and Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain had ten children (one stillborn in 1857):\n\n1. Maria Isabel (1848–1919), who married her first cousin Philippe, comte de Paris (1838–94), the French claimant, and became known as Marie Isabelle, comtesse de Paris. She had several children.\n\n2. Maria Amelia (1851–1870)\n\n3. Maria Cristina (1852–1879)\n\n4. Maria de la Regla (1856–1861)\n\n5. Fernando (1859–1873)\n\n6. Mercedes (1860–1878), otherwise Princess Marie des Graces d’Orleans-Montpensier, who married her first cousin Alfonso XII and is historically known as Mercedes of Orleans, Queen of Spain. No children.\n\n7. Felipe Raimundo Maria (1862–1864)\n\n8. Antonio (1866–1930), became Duke of Galliera in Italy. He married his first cousin Infanta Eulalia of Spain (1864–1958), daughter of Queen Isabella II, and had two sons.\n\n9. Luis Maria Felipe Antonio (1867–1874)\n\nCandidate for the Spanish throne\n\nPrince Antoine de Montpensier lived in Spain from 1848 when he and his family had to leave France after the Revolution of 1848. During the Spanish revolution of 1868, he supported the insurgents under Juan Prim against Queen Isabel II, his own sister-in-law.\n\nIn 1870 he fought a duel against Infante Enrique, Duke of Seville, the brother of King Francisco of Spain, and killed him.\n\nInfante Enrique, Duke of Seville was the grandson of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife, Princess Luisa Carlotta of the Two Sicilies (1804–1844), who was the daughter of Francis I of the Two Sicilies and Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain.\n\nInfante Enrique of Spain became the first Duke of Seville in 1823. He was known for his progressive, even revolutionary, ideas during the reign of his double first cousin and sister-in-law, Queen Isabella II of Spain.\n\nBetween 1869 and 1870, Enrique published several pamphlets and articles hostile to his cousin, Antoine, Duke of Montpensier for the duke’s alleged aspirations on the Spanish throne. Enrique challenged Montpensier to a duel, which took place near La Fortuna in Leganés, Madrid, on March 12, 1870. Enrique was shot and killed, removing him as a public critic of the Duke of Montpensier.\n\nPrince Antoine, Duke of Montpensier was convicted and sentenced to one month in prison.\n\nEnrique’s eldest son, Enrique de Borbón y Castellví, 2nd Duke of Seville, refused to accept the 30,000 pesetas that the Duke of Montpensier offered as compensation.\n\nEnrique, who was no longer an Infante of Spain, could not be buried in El Escorial, but was buried in the Saint Isidore Cemetery, in Madrid.\n\nAfter the marriage of Queen Isabella II of Spain and his brother, Infante Francisco de Asís, Infante Enrique went into a self imposed exile into Belgium. While in France, Infante Enrique several times proclaimed himself a revolutionary, and was asked to join the International Workingmen’s Association.\n\nOn May 13, 1848 he was stripped of his Royal Rank and titles (his children, being born of a morganatic marriage to, Elena María de Castellví y Shelly, were untitled). In 1849 he asked the Queen’s forgiveness in order to return from exile. Enrique’s ducal title was restored, but not the title and style of HRH Infante of Spain.\n\nOn November 16, 1870 the Cortes voted for the next king and chose Prince Amadeo of Savoy, Duke of Aosta, with 191 votes.\n\nPrince Amadeo of Savoy, Duke of Aosta was the third child and second son of King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia, who would later become the first King of a unified Italy, and of Archduchess Adelaide of Austria, daughter of Archduke Rainer of Austria and his wife Princess Elisabeth of Savoy. Prince Amadeo was granted the hereditary title of Duke of Aosta from birth.\n\nPrince Antoine only received 27 votes, and left Spain, only to return in 1874. His ambitions were fulfilled by his daughter Princess Mercedes of Orléans, who became Queen of Spain after her marriage to King Alfonso XII, son of Queen Isabella II. However, she died at the age of 18 without issue.\n\nDespite never reaching the throne, however, through cognates, he is an ancestor of all Spanish monarchs since Juan Carlos I. His great granddaughter Mercedes, Countess of Barcelona, was the mother of King Juan Carlos of Spain who assumed the throne in 1975 and later abdicated in favor of his son, King Felipe VI of Spain in 2014.\n\nEarly collector of photography\n\nThe Duke of Montpensier was an early collector of photography. His collection consisted of dozens of albums and hundreds of early photographs, mainly of Spanish, French and British photographers. The collection was dispersed after his death.\n\nFrancis I of the Two Sicilies (August 19, 1777 – November 18, 1830) was King of the Two Sicilies from 1825 to 1830 and regent of the Kingdom of Sicily from 1806 to 1814.\n\nFrancis was born in Naples the son of Ferdinand IV-III, King of Naples and Sicily (future King Ferdinand of the Two Sicilies) and his wife Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria, the thirteenth child of Empress Maria Theresa, Queen of Bohemia Hungry and Croatia Holy Roman Emperor Franz I. He was also the nephew of Archduchess Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, the last King and Queen of France before the first French Republic.\n\nAt the death of his older brother Charles, Duke of Calabria, Francis became the heir-apparent to the throne and Duke of Calabria, the traditional title of the heir apparent to the Neapolitan throne.\n\nLater life\n\nIn 1796 Francis married his double first cousin Archduchess Maria Clementina of Austria, the tenth child and third daughter of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor and Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain (Carlos III, King of Spain, King of Naples and Sicily, and Maria Amalia of Saxony). As double first cousins as they shared all their grandparents in common.\n\nWhen she died from tuberculosis in 1801, he married his first cousin Infanta María Isabella of Spain, youngest daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa of Bourbon-Parma.\n\nAfter the Bourbon family fled from Naples to Sicily in 1806, Lord William Bentinck, the British resident, had drafted a new constitution along British and French lines. Ferdinand IV-III agreed to abdicate his thrones, with Francis being appointed regent in 1812.\n\nOn the abdication of Napoleon I, his father returned to Naples and suppressed the Sicilian constitution, incorporating his two kingdoms into that of the Two Sicilies (1816); Francis then assumed the revived title of duke of Calabria. While still heir apparent he professed liberal ideas, and on the outbreak of the revolution of 1820 he accepted the regency, apparently in a friendly spirit towards the new constitution.\n\nOn succeeding to the throne in 1825, however, he pursued a conservative course. He took little part in the government, which he left in the hands of favourites and police officials, and lived with his mistresses, surrounded by soldiers, ever in dread of assassination. During his reign the only revolutionary movement was the outbreak on the Cilento (1828), repressed by the Marquis Delcarretto, an ex-Liberal. He was, however, successful in having the Austrian occupation force withdrawn (1827), thereby relieving a large financial burden on the treasury.\n\nDuring his reign, the Royal Order of Francis I was founded to reward civil merit.\n\nIn 1816, French ambassador Pierre Louis Jean Casimir de Blacas arranged with the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily for Marie-Caroline (daughter of King Francis I and his first wife) to marry Louis XVIII of France’s nephew, Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry. The marriage was held on 24 April 1816 in Naples. Caroline thus became Duchess de Berry; known as Madame de Berry in France.\n\nEven though it was arranged, the marriage was happy, with Marie-Caroline and her husband living at the Élysée Palace in Paris which was given to them.\n\nOn 12 June 1819 in Madrid, Francis and María Isabella’s eldest daughter, 14-year-old Luisa Carlotta married her maternal uncle Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain. He was ten years older than Luisa Carlotta.\n\nQueen María Isabella’s constant companion was her second daughter Maria Christina, who was as flirtatious as her mother. Maria Christina was already in her early twenties and her parents were eager to find a royal husband for her.\n\nThe opportunity came when María Isabella’s brother, Fernando VII of Spain, suddenly became a widower in May 1829. Queen María Isabella’s eldest daughter, now Infanta Luisa Carlota, quickly arranged the marriage between her sister and their uncle.\n\nKing Fernando VII of Spain invited his sister, Queen María Isabella and brother-in-law, King Francis I of the Two-Sicilies, to accompany their daughter to the wedding in Madrid.\n\nFrancis I’s was afflicted with gout and on declining health, but María Isabella was anxious to visit her native country after 27 years of absence. She convinced her husband to make the long trip to Spain. Their eldest son, Ferdinand, Duke of Calabria was left as regent during their absence.\n\nTraveling by land, the royal party left for Spain on September 28, 1829. On their way, they visited Pope Pius VIII in Rome. In Grenoble, they met the Duchess of Berry, happy to see her parents after thirteen years. Once in Spain, the marriage was celebrated on January 25,1830.\n\nOn the way back, they were reunited once again with Marie-Caroline, the Duchess of Berry, who presented to them to her infant son, their grandson, Prince Henri, Duke of Bordeaux, at Chambord. María Isabella and her husband went to Paris, where they were entertained by King Charles X of France and Navarre. Henri of Bordeaux was later known as Henri, Comte de Chambord, Legitimists heir to the French throne.\n\nIn June, the King and Queen left for Genoa reaching Naples on July 30. After their return, the king’s health deteriorated rapidly. King Francis I died on November 8, 1830."
