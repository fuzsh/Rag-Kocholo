He was also the nephew of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI the last King and Queen of France before the first French Republic.\n\nIn 1796 Francis married Archduchess Maria Clementina of Austria, daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II. When she died, he married his first cousin María Isabel, daughter of King Charles IV of Spain.\n\nAfter the Bourbon family fled from Naples to Sicily in 1806, and Lord William Bentinck, the British resident, had established a constitution and deprived Ferdinand of all power, Francis was appointed regent (1812).\n\nOn the fall of Napoleon his father returned to Naples and suppressed the Sicilian constitution and autonomy, incorporating his two kingdoms into that of the Two Sicilies (1816); Francis then assumed the revived title of duke of Calabria. While still heir apparent he professed liberal ideas, and on the outbreak of the revolution of 1820 he accepted the regency apparently in a friendly spirit towards the new constitution. But he was probably more conservatively inclined than that.\n\nHence, on succeeding to the throne in 1825, he followed more conservative principles as well. He took little part in the government, which he left in the hands of favourites and police officials, and lived with his mistresses, surrounded by soldiers, ever in dread of assassination. During his reign the only revolutionary movement was the outbreak on the Cilento (1828), repressed by the marquis Delcarretto, an ex-Liberal. He was, however successful in having the Austrian occupation force withdrawn (1827) therefore relieving a large financial burden on the Treasury.\n\nDuring his reign, the Royal Order of Francis I was founded to reward civil merit.\n\nIssue\n\nWith Maria Clementina of Austria:\n\n* Carolina Ferdinanda Luisa (1798-1870), who married 1st Charles Ferdinand, duc de Berry, the second son of King Charles X of France, and 2nd Ettore Count Lucchesi Palli, Prince di Campofranco, Duke della Grazia.\n\n* Ferdinando (1800-1801).\n\nWith Isabella of Spain:\n\n* Luisa Carlotta (1804-1844), who married her mother's younger brother Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain.\n\n* María Cristina (1806-1878), who married 1st her uncle Ferdinand VII of Spain (her mother's older brother) and 2nd Ferdinand Muñoz, Duke of Rianzares.\n\n* Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies (1810-1859) who became Francis I's successor and married twice.\n\n* Carlo Ferdinando, Prince of Capua (1811-1862). Married morganatically to Penelope Smyth and had issue.\n\n* Leopoldo, Count di Siracusa (1813-1860). Married Maria Princess of Savoy-Carignano. No issue.\n\n* Maria Antonietta (1814-1898). Married Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany.\n\n* Antonio, Count of Lecce (1816-1843).\n\n* Marie Amalie (1818-1857), who married Sebastian de Bourbon, Infante of Spain.\n\n* Maria Carolina (1820-1861). Married Carlos, Conde de Montemolin of Spain and Carlist pretender to the throne of Spain.\n\n* Teresa (1822-1889). Married Pedro II of Brazil.\n\n* Luigi, Count di Aquila (1824-1897). Married Januária Maria, Princess Imperial of Brazil (sister of Pedro II of Brazil and Maria II of Portugal). Had issue.\n\n* Francesco, Count of Trapani (1827-1892).
