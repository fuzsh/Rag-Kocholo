        "text": "Ferdinand II (born January 12, 1810, Palermo [Italy]—died May 22, 1859, Caserta) was the king of the Two Sicilies from 1830. He was the son of the future king Francis I and the Spanish infanta María Isabel, a member of the branch of the house of Bourbon that had ruled Naples and Sicily from 1734.\n\nFerdinand II’s initial actions on ascending the throne on November 8, 1830, raised the hopes of the liberals in the kingdom. He granted amnesty to political prisoners, reinstated army officers suspected of republicanism, and showed himself eager to provide good government and to institute reforms. But he gradually came to adopt an authoritarian policy. He severely repressed a number of liberal and national revolts (including that of the Bandiera brothers in 1844). Even his marriage to an Austrian, the Archduchess Theresa, in 1837 (after the death of his first wife, the Piedmontese Maria Cristina), was taken as a sign of his growing conservatism.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nA successful revolution at Palermo on January 12, 1848, and subsequent agitation among Neapolitan liberals forced Ferdinand to grant a constitution on January 29. After his army defeated a group of Neapolitan rebels on May 15, 1848, Ferdinand regained his confidence. He ignored the constitution, recalled troops sent by his liberal ministers to help expel the Austrians from northern Italy, and regained control of Sicily. The heavy bombardment of Sicilian cities in this campaign gained him the name of “King Bomba,” while his harsh treatment of the participants in the revolts earned him the dislike of many Europeans, notably of the future British prime minister William Ewart Gladstone, who denounced Ferdinand’s regime as “the negation of God erected into a system of government.”"
