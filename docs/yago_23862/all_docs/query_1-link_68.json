        "text": "IOTL, Leopoldo was the third son of Francis I of the Two Sicilies. His eldest brother Ferdinand became Ferdinand II and their middle brother, Charles, married morgantically and renounced his right to the throne.\n\nLeopold, as Count of Syracuse, enacted a number of reforms in Sicily that made him beloved on the island. So much so that Ferdinand, despite having Leo as his favorite brother, forced him to leave Sicily out of fear that the Sicilians would declare Leopold their king.\n\nIOTL Ferdinand II started out libera before swinging reactionary and ultimately dooming the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies when his son Francis II inherited. Leopold tried to counsel Francis to be more liberal but was ignored and then he left the Kingdom and died outside of Italy.\n\nSo, what if Ferdinand II and Charles had died young before having any male heirs leaving the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies to Leopold ? While his OTL marriage wasnâ€™t productive, he was originally engaged to Marie of Orleans so maybe that goes through instead of the marriage he got.\n\nWould Leopold, as an agnostic reformer, be better suited to keep the Two Sicilies alive ? Would he be a good candidate for an Italian confederation instead of a Savoyard kingdom ?"
