        "text": "Francis I (born Aug. 14, 1777, Naples—died Nov. 8, 1830, Naples) was the king of the Two Sicilies from 1825.\n\nThe son of Ferdinand I and Maria Carolina, Francis at first inclined toward liberalism. After the introduction of the constitution of 1812, which provided for a bicameral government along British lines, he was appointed vicario, or regent, of Naples. Francis sympathized with the Carbonari uprising of 1820; he opposed the decision of the Congress of Laibach (1821) to send Austrian troops to restore the absolutist monarchy in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. After witnessing the success of the reactionary forces in Naples, however, his outlook changed. After succeeding to the throne upon his father’s death (Jan. 4, 1825), he disavowed his previous liberalism, becoming even more reactionary than his father. He disbanded the National Guard, requested an extension of Austrian garrisoning in the kingdom until 1827, and savagely repressed, with the aid of Guglielmo del Carretto, a revolutionary outbreak in Cilento (1828)."
