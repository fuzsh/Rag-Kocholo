        "text": "by Susan Flantzer\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2023\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire was a limited elective monarchy composed of hundreds of kingdoms, principalities, duchies, counties, prince-bishoprics, and Free Imperial Cities in central Europe. The Holy Roman Empire was not really holy since, after Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in 1530, no emperors were crowned by the pope or a bishop. It was not Roman but rather German because it was mainly in the regions of present-day Germany and Austria. It was an empire in name only – the territories it covered were mostly independent each with its own rulers. The Holy Roman Emperor directly ruled over only his family territories, and could not issue decrees and rule autonomously over the Holy Roman Empire. A Holy Roman Emperor was only as strong as his army and alliances, including marriage alliances, made him, and his power was severely restricted by the many sovereigns of the constituent monarchies of the Holy Roman Empire. From the 13th century, prince-electors, or electors for short, elected the Holy Roman Emperor from among the sovereigns of the constituent states.\n\nFrequently but not always, it was common practice to elect the deceased Holy Roman Emperor’s heir. The Holy Roman Empire was an elective monarchy. No person had a legal right to the succession simply because he was related to the current Holy Roman Emperor. However, the Holy Roman Emperor could and often did, while still alive, have a relative (usually a son) elected to succeed him after his death. This elected heir apparent used the title King of the Romans.\n\nLearn more at Unofficial Royalty: What was the Holy Roman Empire?\n\n********************\n\nArchduchess Claudia Felicitas of Austria was the second of the three wives and the second cousin of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor who was also King of Hungary, King of Bohemia, Archduke of Austria, King of Croatia, Duke of Teschen, King of the Romans, Archduke of Further Austria, and Prince of Transylvania. Born in Innsbruck, then in the County of Tyrol, now in Austria, on May 30, 1653, Claudia Felicitas was the elder of the two children, both daughters, of Ferdinand Karl, Archduke of Further Austria and Count of Tyrol and first cousin Anna de’ Medici. Her paternal grandparents were Leopold V, Archduke of Further Austria and Claudia de’ Medici. Claudia Felicitas’ maternal grandparents were Cosimo II de’ Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and Maria Maddalena of Austria.\n\nClaudia Felicitas had one younger sister who died in childhood:\n\nArchduchess Maria Magdalena of Austria (1656 – 1669), died at age twelve\n\nClaudia Felicitas grew up at her father’s court in Innsbruck, a center of baroque art and music. She loved hunting but also showed a great interest in music. Claudia Felicitas had an excellent singing voice, played several instruments, and composed music. She took her Roman Catholic faith very seriously and was a secular member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic. In 1662, when Claudia Felicitas was nine-years-old, her 34-year-old father Ferdinand Karl, Archduke of Further Austria died. He was succeeded by his brother Sigismund Franz, who died three years later in 1665. Claudia Felicitas and her sister, who would die in 1669, became the last members of the Tyrolean branch of the House of Habsburg.\n\nAfter the extinction of the male line of the Tyrolean branch of the House of Habsburg in 1665, the Archduchy of Further Austria and the County of Tyrol came under the direct control of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I. A dispute ensued with the Imperial Court when Claudia Felicitas’ mother Anna de’ Medici tried to protect the rights of her daughters. However, in 1673, when the first wife of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I, Margarita Teresa of Spain, died without providing a surviving male heir, a solution to solve the dispute and Leopold’s lack of male heirs became apparent. Because Leopold had no male heirs, he needed to marry again as soon as possible. He opted for Claudia Felicitas and her mother eagerly agreed. After a proxy marriage, 20-year-old Claudia Felicitas and 33-year-old Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I were married at Graz Cathedral on October 15, 1673. After her marriage, Claudia Felicitas retained the title of Countess of Tyrol, and the dispute ended.\n\nThe House of Habsburg was notorious for its inbreeding. The Habsburgs had built their empire by marriage and they wanted to keep the land they amassed all in the family, so they began to intermarry more and more frequently among themselves. Leopold I’s first wife Margarita Teresa of Spain was his first cousin and his niece. She had six pregnancies in six years (four living childbirths and two miscarriages), and four months into her seventh pregnancy, Margarita Teresa died. Her only surviving child, a daughter, gave birth to three sons – two died at birth and one died at the age of seven.\n\nClaudia Felicitas and Leopold I combined for a gene pool that was also problematic. They were second cousins four times over. Leopold’s parents and Claudia Felicitas’ parents were all double first cousins with each other. All four had the same pair of grandparents Karl II, Archduke of Austria and Maria Anna of Bavaria.\n\nClaudia Felicitas and Leopold I had two daughters, who died in infancy:\n\nArchduchess Anna Maria Josepha of Austria (born and died 1674)\n\nArchduchess Maria Josepha Clementina of Austria (1675 – 1676), died in infancy\n\nSix months after giving birth to her daughter Maria Josepha, 22-year-old Claudia Felicitas died from tuberculosis in Vienna, on April 8, 1676, less than two-and-a-half years after her marriage. She was buried in the Dominican Church, also known as the Church of St. Maria Rotund, in Vienna. Three months later, her 9-month-old daughter Maria Josepha Clementina died. Leopold I was devastated by the loss of his second wife, and he retired to a monastery near Vienna to mourn. From his two marriages, he had six children, however, all except the oldest daughter from his first marriage had died. One has to wonder what role the serious inbreeding played. Leopold did marry for a third time but not to another Habsburg. His third wife Eleonore Magdalene of Neuberg finally provided him with male heirs, two sons who both became Holy Roman Emperors.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
