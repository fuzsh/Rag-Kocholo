He's the one who had Jose marry Infanta Benedita in the first place, so if he's dead then I doubt Maria will have her son marry her sister. Maria never really got along well with her sisters, so I can't see her wanting one to be the future Queen consort of Portugal. That way Jose marries a foreign Princess (probably Spanish or maybe an Italian Bourbon) and Benedita remains single. Your other idea is highly unlikely. For one annulments where incredibly rare during this time and for the other, his brother Joao will still marry and have children, so the succession is secured. If Jose was the only heir (ie Joao died early) THEN maybe the Pope would be willing to listen but without that no chance.\n\nWell Jose was actually prepared from an early to become King, unlike Joao, so that in itself is a boost for his country.

But that's semantics.\n\nThere weren't really a whole lot of mainline Hapsburg or Bourbon (or even Wittelsbach) princesses available, here's a list of major Catholic princesses who might be Prince Joseph's wife.\n\nMaria Theresia Elisabeth of Austria (1762-1768), daughter of HRE Josef II and his half-French half-Spanish Italian wife, her death might be butterflied away.\n\nMaria Theresia Josefa of Tuscany (b. 1767) OTL Queen of Saxony, daughter of HRE Leopold I and his Spanish wife.\n\nÉlisabeth de France (b. 1764) unwed sister of Louis XVI (she might get on well with Maria I due to the fact she was also hyper-pious - even wanting to be a nun).\n\nMaria Josefa of Spain (b. 1744), only surviving unmarried daughter of Carlos III, sister to the Grand Duchess of Tuscany and the kings of Naples and Spain (NOTE: very unlikely).\n\nMaria Anna of Saxony (b. 1761) OTL unmarried.\n\nMaria Theresa of Saxe-Teschen (1767) daughter of Archduchess Maria Christine of Austria and Albert of Saxony, duke of Teschen, her death might be butterflied away.\n\nMaria Carolina Antonietta of Savoy (b. 1764), OTL Electress of Saxony, sister to the comtesses de Provence and Artois, and three successive kings of Sardinia.\n\nThere are princesses of Bourbon-Parma, -Naples and -Spain available from the mid-1770s on, but IDK if Portugal would be willing to wait that long for an heir.\n\nOn the annulment thingm I also realized that that was somewhat unlikely, given that as Urbanus points out, they would've needed a dispensation to marry in the first place, so the Pope would be perjuring himself somewhat by granting an annulment on grounds of consanguinity.\n\nSo, maybe let Benedita carry one of the pregnancies to term, give birth to a stillborn child and die in childbed, thereby freeing Joseph to marry again.\n\nReviving an old thread due to recent info which I discovered about the Portuguese royal family.\n\nMaria Ana was on the list for the Dauphin but Portugal was thought to be \" too under the English\". Maria Francisca was seriously considered as a Queen for Poniatowski but the Russians were against the founding of a new dynasty in Poland. Perhaps the Princesses were held back from marriage for the sake of the 1641 Succession Law.\n\nApparently, there were two marriages considered for Portugal which never went through, which might eliminate Jose marrying his aunt in the first place.\n\n1) Maria Benedita was proposed as a wife for HRE Josef II. Not sure if this was after Isabel of Parma or Josefa of Bavaria's death.\n\nPrincess Donna Maria Benedicta who was likewise considerable younger being only six and twenty years old at this time. Though low in stature, clumsy and much inclined to embonpoint her face was very handsome; her eyes dark and eloquent, her complexion fair, the contour of her countenance rather round that oval, and her features small as well as delicate. but she was not considered to possess the superiority of mind that distinguished Maria Anna. About seven years before the time of which I speak a treaty of marriage had been set upon between this Princess and Emperor Joseph II who was then recently become a Widower by the death of his first wife, a daughter of Don Phillip, Duke of Parma. The negotiations proceeded so far that preparations were made for transporting her from Lisbon to Flanders in her way to Vienna: and a ship constructed expressly for the purpose in the Brazalia magnificently decorated lay waiting in the Tagus. (unsure of word) But the intrigues and exertions of the old Dowager queen of Spain, Mother of Charles III, and Grandmother of the Princess herself, who was incensed at the endeavors of the Marquise de Pombel, to assume the exclusive merit of this alliance rendered the plan abortive.\n\n2) Likewise, the Prince José was attempted to be betrothed to Mme Élisabeth, sister of Louis XVI. The marriage talks were rather serious at one point, since he's listed alongside other prospective husbands for her with Josef II, and Victor Emanuele I of Sardinia.\n\nHowever, Louis XVI asked her not to leave, saying, \"We need you here. \" Many princes sought her hand, but she declined all proposals.\n\nWhat does everyone else think? A slightly less clingy Louis XVI or a more willing Josef II and suddenly Portugal gets included in the Habsburg-Bourbon sphere of alliances?\n\nIt's sort of a tangent, but....\n\nare dynastic marriages worth anything at this point? we always hear how these betrothals somehow cement, or accomplish, peace between nations. Did they really accomplish that, overall?\n\nbrother Joao (6 I think) is married to Carlos IV (spain) daughter, and it never stopped Carlos from being too pushy. Granted, Carlos never really had a choice, being a toady of France.\n\nBut, to the point of the thread, Jose was widely known as being on the liberal side, while Joao was a staunch conservative. As someone said, Jose is always painted as being trained for being king, but he died in late 20's having never done anything that anyone wrote down. He could have just been a dandy who died before being found out. But, we don't know, so let's just assume he's reasonably competent, and having a liberal bent. IF Jose comes to power in early 90's, you'd think that there would be some liberal reforms. He might not join in with Spain in the abortive war of the Pyrenees, which caused half a decade of animosity with France, culminating in the War of Oranges. Completely unknown how he reacts to Nap. maybe his liberal side sympathizes and he gets a pass for the invasion of 1807. probably he's forced by Britain to toe the line, and has the same result. he might actually show an interest in Portugal after 1814, bringing him back to the continent and siding with the liberals. His successor is still going to be Joao's son, but maybe, if the conservatives haven't thrown them all out of office in a backlash against the liberal tendencies, there isn't as much mayhem, and Portugal can assume some sort of normalcy.\n\none nice thing about Jose on the throne is that, presuming OTL flight to Brazil (never a good idea to assume with a 15 year POD), Jose would probably leave Joao in Brazil, and Pedro would come to Portugal for education. One, Joao is probably compliant and keeps the union. Two, Pedro isn't in a position to push for independence then give up and leave Brazil in the lurch (I am most definitely NOT a fan of Pedro, thinking he was bad for both countries).\n\nJoao was a mixture of men. at one turn, he was a great leader in Brazil. at another turn, he was a muddler who led Portugal down the road of ruin. Getting poisoned certainly didn't help the country, but can't blame him for that. I think he and Pedro completely screwed the pooch on keeping Brazil/Portugal united. he embraced conservatism at a time that liberalism was the going trend. Perhaps, with a more steady leader, Portugal could have been something for a while longer. It takes a lot to return them to glory, but it's much harder to envision the path going much worse than where Joao took it.\n\nIt's sort of a tangent, but....\n\nare dynastic marriages worth anything at this point? we always hear how these betrothals somehow cement, or accomplish, peace between nations.

His successor is still going to be Joao's son, but maybe, if the conservatives haven't thrown them all out of office in a backlash against the liberal tendencies, there isn't as much mayhem, and Portugal can assume some sort of normalcy.\n\nI hear what you're saying, and even if worthless, a marriage to Élisabeth is still somewhat more prestigious than to your aunt. Granted, England won't be too happy about it, although considering the fact that an English princess would be unlikely to marry a Portuguese infante , it sort of makes that argument invalid.\n\nAlthough, why do we assume that a surviving José would be succeeded by an alt-Pedro I? Whether he marries his aunt or Élisabeth, he could still end up with a surviving child. Considering that the only of Élisabeth's siblings not to have issue was Clothilde - and that was directly related to her weight problems - I think Babette could contribute at least one kid to the succession. And even he still marries his aunt, there's no reason why she can't produce a \"healthy\" child to succeed José II.\n\nwell, now you're going to make my head hurt thinking about everything\n\nyou have what's going on in Portugal: Jose lives and takes over vs Jose dies OTL, but underaged heirs are waiting around. you have a regent for a regent in early 90's and what do all the adults in the kingdom do jockeying for power. Or does Joao become regent for Mad Maria, then turns over the regency to Jose jr? Will he give up the power so readily, or will his scheming wife, Carlotta, bend him to put in a power struggle once Jose Jr comes of age (or does Jr mysteriously find an untimely end thanks to Carlotta?) Is Jr a genius/competent, or another lackluster king? you can pretty much write it anyway you want. if you want an evaluation of how decent a king Jose would be, you have to stick to OTL With a substitution.\n\nand then, concurrently, you have Joseph II. does benedita still remain childless? were the miscarriages the result of inbreeding? add in a surviving son, the entire history of Austria now changes. and of course, his OTL second wife (from Bavaria) goes elsewhere. how does this affect the War of Bavarian Succession?\n\nFor me, a Portuwank would have Jose starting the job of reforming Portugal. It's hard for me to envision Portugal not being torn asunder between the conflict of Britain and France. you can probably soften the blow, but anyway you look at it, Portugal is NOT going to be able to rebound in power enough to avoid being a pawn. I personally like a stronger Brazil, and like what happened once the court transferred there. It's semi ASB to have the capital of the empire stay there permanently, so you either have to splinter off Brazil as a growing independent country, or figure out how to leave a crown presence who isn't going to immediately jump to independence (ala Pedro). The crown king returning to Portugal immediately after Nap wars is a HUGE factor in keeping Brazil in the fold. Keep Brazil in the fold, you can write a resurgence of Portuguese power. OR, you can figure out how to transfer all the empire to Brazil and let Portugal go free. Idealistically, this is the way to go, IMO. Brazil is the future. Portugal is the past. But that's a Brazil o wank.\n\nNot sure if this is any help, but Maria I's madness was reportedly a combo of the fact that she had a genetic predisposition to it, but it was triggered by the deaths of her loved ones - her husband (1786), her son (September 1788), her granddaughter (1787), daughter and grandson (November 1788) (plus her confessor and her prime minister in '88) - so close together. Add to that the events going on in France didn't do much to help matters. Her courtiers were the same that had been imprisoned by Pombal during his \"reign\", so naturally they thirsted for revenge on the Marquis.\n\nSo maybe with a sufficiently early enough POD, the slough of deaths can be mitigated - if only slightly.\n\nAs to Maria's sisters, admittedly the 1760s are rather late for first time brides, but they can still serve their purposes. In fact, Russia's objections to a new dynasty in Poland might be allayed by an older princess past her prime, marrying King Poniatowski. And as to what future awaits the Bavarian princess who became Queen of the Romans, I think any future would be happier than the course that she was forced to follow OTL.\n\nAfter all, her sister-in-law wrote that \"if my husband were to ignore me as he does her, I would run away and hang myself from the nearest tree\"."
