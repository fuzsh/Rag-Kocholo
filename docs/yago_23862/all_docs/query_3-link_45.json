        "text": "Maria I (December 17, 1734 – March 20, 1816) was Queen of Portugal from February 24, 1777 until her death in 1816. Known as Maria the Pious in Portugal and Maria the Mad in Brazil, she was the first undisputed Queen Regnant of Portugal and the first monarch of Brazil.\n\nEarly life\n\nInfanta Maria Francisca, Princess of Beira, Duchess of Barcelos; was born at the Ribeira Palace in Lisbon. She was the eldest of four daughters born to Infante José, Prince of Brazil (later King José I of Portugal), and Infanta Mariana Victoria of Spain, who was an Infanta of Spain by birth and the eldest daughter of King Felipe V of Spain and his second wife Elisabeth Farnese. Her father was a grandson of King Louis XIV of France and Navarre and had inherited the Spanish throne in 1700.\n\nThis made Infanta Maria of Portugal the eldest grandchild of King João V of Portugal and King Felipe V of Spain. King João appointed his granddaughter Maria as the Princess of Beira on the day of her birth.\n\nHer father, King José, was the eldest surviving son of the reigning King João V of Portugal and his wife Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria the daughter of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor and Eleonore Magdalene of Neuburg.\n\nAs the heir to the throne, she held the titles of Princess of Brazil and Duchess of Braganza. She married her uncle Infante Pedro of Portugal in 1760.\n\nHis parents were King João V of Portugal and his wife Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria. Infante Pedro was a younger brother of King José I of Portugal. Their maternal grandparents were Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, and Eleonor Magdalene of Neuburg, sister of Maria Sofia of Neuburg, who was the wife of King Pedro II of Portugal.\n\nMaria and Pedro had six children, of whom three survived infancy: José, Prince of Brazil; King João VI of Portugal; and Infanta Mariana Vitória.\n\nThe death of King José in 1777 placed Maria, then 42 years old, on the throne. According to custom, Pedro thus became King Pedro III of Portugal in right of his wife, after the delivery of his first born child. King Pedro III made no attempt to participate in government affairs, spending his time hunting or in religious exercises.\n\nUpon ascending the throne, Queen Maria dismissed her father’s powerful chief minister, Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal. The early part of Queen Maria’s reign witnessed growth in Portugal’s economy. Maria had a number of national buildings constructed and renovated, leading to the completion of the Palace of Queluz and the inauguration of the Palace of Ajuda and other new monuments.\n\nThe death of her husband in 1786, followed by the deaths in 1788 of her eldest son Infante José and her confessor Inácio de São Caetano, caused the queen to develop clinical depression. Her second son, João, then served as Prince Regent.\n\nWith Napoleon’s European conquests, Queen Maria and her court moved to the Portuguese colony of Brazil in 1807. After Brazil was elevated to a Kingdom in 1815, Maria became Queen of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Upon her death in 1816, her son succeeded her as King João VI.\n\nMaria I (December 17, 1734 – March 20, 1816) was Queen of Portugal from February 24, 1777 until her death in 1816. Known as Maria the Pious in Portugal and Maria the Mad in Brazil, she was the first undisputed Queen Regnant of Portugal and the first monarch of Brazil.\n\nMaria was the eldest daughter of King José I of Portugal and Infanta Mariana Victoria of Spain, the eldest daughter of King Felipe V of Spain and Queen Elisabeth Farnese.\n\nKing João V appointed his granddaughter Maria as the Princess of Beira on the day of her birth.\n\nMaria’s grandfather João V died on July 3, 1750. Her father, Prince José, then succeeded to the throne as King José I. As José’s eldest child, Maria became his heir presumptive and was given the traditional titles of Princess of Brazil and Duchess of Braganza.\n\nOn June 6, 1760 Maria married her uncle Pedro of Portugal. Maria and Pedro had six children: José, João Francisco, João (later King João VI), Mariana Vitória, Maria Clementina, and Maria Isabel. Only José, João, and Mariana Vitória survived to adulthood. Maria also delivered a stillborn boy in 1762.\n\nKing José died on February 24, 1777. His daughter, Maria, then became the first undisputed queen regnant of Portugal. With Maria’s accession, her husband became nominal king as Pedro III, but the actual regal authority was vested solely in Maria, as she was the lineal heir of the crown. Also, as Pedro’s kingship was jure uxoris only, his reign would cease in the event of Maria’s death, and the crown would pass to Maria’s descendants.\n\nUpon ascending the throne, Maria dismissed her father’s powerful chief minister, Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal, who had broken the power of the reactionary aristocracy via the Távora affair, partially because of his Enlightenment, anti-Jesuit policies. Noteworthy events of this period include Portugal’s membership in the League of Armed Neutrality (July 1782) and the 1781 cession of Delagoa Bay from Austria to Portugal. However, the queen suffered from religious mania and melancholia and this would take a toll on her health.\n\nThe early part of Maria’s reign witnessed growth in Portugal’s economy. Maria had a number of national buildings constructed and renovated, leading to the completion of the Palace of Queluz and the inauguration of the Palace of Ajuda and other new monuments. The death of her husband in 1786, followed by the deaths in 1788 of her eldest son José and her confessor Inácio de São Caetano, caused the queen to develop clinical depression. Her second son, João, then served as prince regent.\n\nIn February 1792, Maria was deemed mentally insane and was treated by Francis Willis, the same physician who attended the British king George III. Willis wanted to take her to England, but the plan was refused by the Portuguese court. Potentially as a result of Willis’ more advisory role in Maria’s care, rather than the hands-on care of King George III, Willis deemed the queen incurable. Maria’s second son, João, now Prince of Brazil, took over the government in her name, even though he only took the title of Prince Regent in 1799. When the Real Barraca de Ajuda burnt down in 1794, the court was forced to move to Queluz, where the ill queen would lie in her apartments all day. Another potential cause of her mental illness was her incestuous ancestry, this is substantiated by two of her sisters who had similar conditions.\n\nWith Napoleon’s European conquests, Maria and her court moved to the Portuguese colony of Brazil in 1807. After Brazil was elevated to a kingdom in 1815, Maria became Queen of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.\n\nIn 1816, she died at the Carmo Convent in Rio de Janeiro at the age of 81. After her death, the prince regent was acclaimed as King João VI. Maria’s body was returned to Lisbon to be interred in a mausoleum in the Estrela Basilica (Portuguese: Basilica da Estrela), which she had helped found.\n\nMaria is a greatly admired figure in both Brazil and Portugal due to the tremendous changes and events that took place during her reign. In Portugal, she is celebrated as a strong female figure. Her legacy shines at Portugal’s Queluz Palace, a baroque-roccoco masterpiece that she helped conceive. A large statue of her stands in front of the palace, and a pousada near the palace is named in her honour. A large marble statue of the queen was erected at the Portuguese National Library in Lisbon by the students of Joaquim Machado de Castro."
