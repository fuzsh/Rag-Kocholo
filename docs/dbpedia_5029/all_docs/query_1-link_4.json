        "text": "MARCHING up the hillsides of the medieval city of Fribourg just 17 miles southwest of Bern, straddling the border between French- and German-speaking Switzerland, are ancient houses in the Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque styles. Only a few years ago they were considered undesirable, but now, in the throes of gentrification, they have become sought after. Halfway up, rows of 16th- to 18th-century private residences with oaken doors and finely worked grills convey a sense of old wealth along the Grand-Rue.\n\nFrom that main street of old Fribourg it's only a few steps to the panoramic Zahringen Bridge, a stone structure named for the Bernese ducal family that in the 12th century founded the city. Some 150 feet above the snaking Sarine River, which cuts into the valley, the bridge commands a view of the oldest neighborhoods deep below and of the fortifications that ring the city.\n\nThe old city cannot have changed a great deal in the approximately 250 years since Jean Jacques Rousseau used to visit, but that moody Genevan philosopher didn't think much of it. To a modern visitor, Fribourg is striking for its charm and its architectural purity.\n\nMore than a mile of walls, 14 towers and a 15th-century fort are the remains of a system the city constructed at the end of the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance as protection from covetous neighbors.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. Nicholas, built 700 years ago, is acknowledged to be one of Europe's great Gothic churches. Its 165-year-old organ, in the loft above the main entrance, brought international attention early. It \"made me sob,\" confides Dorothea Brooke, the idealistic heroine of George Eliot's \"Middlemarch.\" Like Dorothea, Eliot herself was apparently deeply stirred by the music reverberating in the big Gothic church. She spent several months in the French-speaking part of Switzerland and visited Fribourg after her father's death in 1849.\n\nAt that time the Fribourg organ with its 7,800 pipes -- some of them 32 feet high -- was considered a musical wonder and attracted many visitors to the city. Franz Liszt, who liked to try out the musical instruments he found during his travels, made it sing and thunder.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
