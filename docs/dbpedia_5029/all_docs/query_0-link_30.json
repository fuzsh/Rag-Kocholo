though on some routes the service only operates every other hour.\n\nSo to facilitate an hourly service between destinations on some routes, in hours when there is no direct train service, connections between trains are built into the national timetable.\n\nConnections between trains are designed so that the waiting time between trains across Switzerland is less than 10 minutes; and the private railways also usually follow this pattern.\n\nTrains in Switzerland are VERY rarely more than 5 minutes late, so connections are usually guaranteed.\n\nThough to ensure connections, trains can often spend up to 10 minutes waiting at stations and still depart on time.\n\nInternational daytime trains to and from Switzerland also fit into this regular timetable, when travelling between destinations in Switzerland.\n\nFor example, some of the hourly trains between Basel and Interlaken are ICE trains, which have travelled from Germany, and not SBBâs regular IC trains.\n\nSBB's express trains fall into two categories:\n\n(1) The IC Train Services:\n\nAside from speed, the key distinguishing feature of these trains is that they convey restaurant cars.\n\nMost IC train services are double-deck, but some are single deck; at busy times of the day additional single deck coaches can be attached to the double deck trains..\n\nNew and shiny double deck IC trains are now available on some routes.\n\nThe older double deck trains were beginning to show their age, hence newly modernsied coaches are now being introduced.\n\nThe tilting ICN trains are still in service, but are now also branded as IC services; and they are also being refreshed.\n\n(2) The IR train services:\n\nDifferent types of services are designated IR (InterRegio).\n\nOn the Geneve â Sion â Brig route they are the fastest trains and are no different to the single and double deck IC trains; except for the fact that they donât convey restaurant cars.\n\nOn some routes the IR services are slower than IC services, but the standard ticket price won't be any cheaper.\n\nSome IR trains convey 1st class observation cars in which ordinary 1st class tickets are valid.\n\nAlso some IR services are operated by BLS or SOB.\n\nThe IC route numbers:\n\nSBB has introduced route numbers for its IC and IR services - see the SBB IC/IR Trains route map in the links section above.\n\nThe IC train routes are now numbered as follows:\n\nIC 1 = St Gallen - Winterthur - Zurich Flughafen (airport) - Zurich HB (main station) - Bern - Fribourg - Lausanne - Geneve - Aeroport\n\nIC 2 = Zurich HB - Zug - Arth Goldau - Bellinzona - Lugano\n\nIC 3 = Basel - Zurich HB - Landquart - Chur\n\nIC 4 = Zurich HB - Schaffhausen\n\nIC 5 = Rorsach - St Gallen - Winterthur - Zurich Flughafen - Zurich HB - Olten - Biel/Bienne - Neuchatel - Geneve - Geneve Aeroport AND Zurich HB - Olten - Biel/Bienne - Neuchatel - Lausanne\n\nIC 6 = Basel - Olten - Bern - Thun - Spiez - Visp - Brig\n\nIC 8 = Romanshorn - Winterthur - Zurich Flughafen - Zurich HB - Bern - Thun - Spiez - Visp - Brig\n\nIC 21 = Basel - Luzern - Arth Goldau - Bellinzona - Lugano\n\nIC 51 = Basel - DelÃ©mont - Moutiers - Biel/Bienne\n\nIC 61 = Basel - Olten - Bern - Thun - Spiez - Interlaken Ost - Interlaken West\n\nthe lack of conventional Wi-Fi.\n\nSwiss national rail operator SBB does not provide wi-fi on its trains in the conventional sense; meaning that passengers can't log on to a SBB portal for wi-fi.\n\nInstead SBB has equipped its IC trains and most IR trains with signal amplifiers to enable enhanced connectivity with local mobile networks.\n\nThe coaches/cars equipped with this equipment have symbols by the doors - and SBB suggests that passengers who wish to access wi-fi during a journey, should travel in these coaches in order to access these 'hotspots'.\n\nAlso worth knowing\n\nA yellow band above the doors indicates that a coach is 1st class.\n\nFor journeys within Switzerland, international trains have the same terms and conditions as Swiss trains. Meaning that reservations aren't compulsory for journeys WITHIN Switzerland by Lyria trans, or on the EC trains which have travelled to and from Italy.\n\nPassport checks can be carried out on board international trains to/from Switzerland.\n\nTravellers are singled out apparently randomly, so don't be offended if the customs staff ask to see your passport, but ignore your fellow passengers.\n\nKeep your passport in your hand luggage.\n\nIn Switzerland ticket inspections are carried out on the trains, so there is no need for stations to have barriers, or gate-lines.\n\nAs a result the stations are open to the surrounding streets with multiple access points - so what's unusual is that you usually don't have to pass through station buildings in order to access the trains, or to transfer between buses and trains.\n\nHowever, normally the short-cuts into the station can only be used if you already have a valid ticket.\n\nIf you need to buy a ticket look out for the ticket symbols on any signs that you see; the ticket desks and machines may not be in what looks like a main station building.\n\nOften they're in the passage way beneath the tracks or are housed in the middle of a station.\n\nThe access to and from the trains\n\nElevators and particularly escalators can be rare at Swiss stations - especially in the middle of the platform/track (gleis/voie).\n\nInstead step free access is provided by slopes that connect the platform / track / gleis / voie to passage ways which are located beneath the railway tracks.\n\nSo if you have luggage etc there is always an alternative to using the stairs.\n\nThe core departure info\n\nAt most stations the platforms/tracks/gleis/voies are used by multiple train departures per hour.\n\nSo wait for your train where you can see the electronic displays which show the details of the next train to leave.\n\nAlso keep the departure time front of mind.\n\nIt's not unusual for SBB express trains to be timetabled so that they spend up to 10 mins at a station between arrival and departure.\n\nSo you often don't have to rush and board by the first door you see; even though most people do.\n\nBut if you use the time to move further along the train you can have a greater chance of finding spare seats etc.\n\nAt Swiss stations the older type of electronic departure screens, the paper timetable posters and the station announcements all normally DON'T include every station that a train will be calling at.\n\nSometimes only the next two or three stations that a train will be calling at are shown on the electronic indicators, along with the final destination of the train.\n\nSBB also doesnât use a system of train numbers on its information indicators or tickets, so being aware of the final destination of your train can help save time and confusion â hence we have striven to include it on our journey guides.\n\nIf youâre not sure what train you need to board check at the information desk or ticket office.\n\nUsing the train departure indicators\n\nAt the main stations there are electronic indicators on the platforms/tracks, which indicate in which zone of the platform the 1st class, 2nd class and restaurant car coaches will be located, when the train arrives.\n\nThey don't indicate in which zone a specific coach number will be located and they are also not particularly accurate - in our experience.\n\nWhat they are particularly useful for is working out at which end of a train the 1st class coaches will be located.\n\nThough new screens are now being introduced, which do also show the zones on the gleis (platforms/tracks), in which each specific coach of a train can be found.\n\nMaking connections\n\nIf you will be changing trains at larger stations, seek out, what can be hard to find, paper departure posters that you can find on the platform.\n\nThey list all train departures in consecutive order so you can use then to check which platform / track / gleis / voie, your onward connection will be leaving from.\n\nIf you're in luck you'll be able to remain on the same platform you have just arrived at.\n\nAlso when looking up and booking tickets for the many indirect Swiss journeys, the connections between trains will typically be around 10 minutes.\n\nThis won't be an issue, as the timetable takes into account the time it will take to make a transit from one platform / track / gleis / voie, to another.\n\nThe signage directing travellers is comparatively easy to follow and making the connection will typically take 1 or 2 minutes, though allow around 5 minutes at larger stations such as Bern and Zurich HB.\n\nMaking connections will typically be easier if you don't board into the rear of the trains - the routes to the other platforms and tracks tend to be in the middle of the platforms.\n\nAt Zurich HB its mainly easier to make connections from the front of the train - Except when arriving at the long-distance underground platforms / tracks on trains from destinations to the north of the city, including Munich, St Gallen and Winterthur, when the easiest connections will be from the rear of the trains.\n\nThe larger stations will have coin and card operated left luggage lockers, which can be accessed at any time.\n\nWhen depositing bags you must pay for an initial 24 hours - even if you will be only depositing a bag for a couple of hours.\n\nThen on collection you pay the balance - the charge will rise per day, but keep in mind that you may have pay in excess of 20 francs in coins, though lockers which accept cards are now being installed.\n\nChange machines are usually available, though at the larger stations, with lockers in multiple locations, only one location can have a change machine\n\nIf you are going to be touring Switzerland then you can forward your luggage between stations, you don't have to take it on the trains.\n\nThis can be a particularly useful service if you will be entering and leaving Switzerland at different locations.\n\nThese luggage desks tend to be in a different part of a station to a left luggage office - it's easy to confuse the two."
