        "text": "Switzerland beauty needs no introduction. Being one of the most breathtakingly beautiful countries in the world, I knew I had to pay the Swiss mountains and valleys a visit during my Euro trip.\n\nEven though it is one of the most expensive countries in Europe, as per my experience, I still managed to make the most of my one week there and cover a lot of ground. You can’t really go backpacking here but let me tell you it will be worth every penny you spend.\n\nMy Swiss itinerary looked something like this – Geneva – Lucerne – Titlis – Interlaken – Jungfraujoch – Lotschberger – Zermatt – Gornergrat – Geneva and it was just perfect. I wanted to include a hike to Seealpsee after checking out some amazing photographs of the area. However, since I wanted to spend some time in Croatia as well, one week was just about all I could spare…and afford.\n\nWith this post, I will take my readers down memory lane with me and show some of the most amazing spots in Switzerland, through pictures. The beauty of Switzerland cannot be explained in words so this is the only way to do justice to it.\n\nPhotoblog through the best of Switzerland\n\nThe best mementos of Switzerland natural beauty are capturing stunning Switzerland pictures that you can revisit anytime from your home.\n\nOur journey started with Lucerne and our first impression of Switzerland was made – It was simply incredible. This bustling city was full of scenic views, modern amenities, luxury retreats and relaxing spots by Lake Lucerne. The entire city looks like a Swiss storybook with mountains making for impeccable backdrops.\n\nFrom Lucerne we took the LSE to Engelberg and a small gondola took us further up to Trübsee, Stand and finally to Mt Titlis.\n\nOnce on top, we enjoyed the stunning views from Mt Titlis.\n\nI also had a lovely time on the ice flyer chairlift and going through the glacier caves. It was my first time on a chairlift and it was really exciting. I could see deep valleys and snow covered mountains all around.\n\nHere are some of my favorite beautiful pictures of Switzerland –\n\nThe next day, we headed to Interlaken and I must say all the train journeys are so enjoyable in Switzerland. Here are few snapshots I took from the train –\n\nAll through our Swiss adventure, I really enjoyed the train rides. Usually, I doze off while commuting but the surreal beauty of Switzerland kept me wide awake and clicking.\n\nOnce in Interlaken, our next stop was Jungfraujoch – the top of Europe. The best way to reach there is via Eiger glacier by the Jungfrau railway. If you have time to spare, I would highly recommend a visit to the gateway of Jungfrau region – Lauterbrunnen.\n\nAfter spending a night in Interlaken, we headed towards Zermatt, which was undoubtedly the highlight of our trip. I mean, one look at the mighty Matterhorn and the snow covered landscapes of Gornergrat, had me going ga-ga all over the place.\n\nGornergrat is easily reachable via a cogwheel railway from Zermatt and offers spectacular views of the majestic Matterhorn and other peaks like the Monte Rosa. I was simply star-stuck by the Matterhorn and for me, Gornergrat has, till date, been the most awe-inspiring place I have ever seen.\n\nA lovely short hike from Gornergrat to Rottenboden station takes us through mind-blowing views of valleys and the Swiss alps. This hike is a must do. You just need to skip a station (instead of taking the cogwheel, walk down a couple of stops). It’s the perfect way to indulge in this exotic, tranquil setting and see the Riffelsee up close. These are the kind of views you can expect en-route –\n\nAnd finally… my favorite picture of the trip – The lovely alpine lake Riffelsee with the Matterhorn making for the most perfect view I have ever seen.\n\nWell after Zermatt, we just had a day in Geneva to relax, unwind and catch our flight for our next destination – Croatia.\n\nHere’s a video by a fellow blogger depicting the most beautiful places in Switzerland –\n\nPro Tip – Swiss Travel Pass is an absolute MUST have. You get unlimited access to all panoramic trains, buses, and boats across Switzerland. Book your Swiss Rail/ Travel pass here.\n\nSwitzerland FAQ’s\n\nWhy Switzerland is so Beautiful?\n\nThe secret to Swiss beauty is all thanks to the magnificent Alps, stunning glacier lakes, cute fairytale towns, and gorgeous castles.\n\nWhat is Switzerland Famous for?\n\nA lot of things but mainly the Alps, chocolates, swiss knife, watches, fondue and Heidi.\n\nSo friends, have you ever visited Switzerland? What was the highlight of your trip? Tell me about your Swiss adventures or if you are planning one, what all do you have in mind? I would be happy to share a complete DIY Swiss itinerary with anyone who is interested."
