        "text": "After a long 8 hour flight, few in-flight movies and not so great flight food, we reached Zurich. Somehow the 1st breath of fresh air of another country fills me with a lot of excitement and happiness to see that place.\n\nGuess what was our first shopping from Zurich? A bottle of Martini Asti from duty free !! Our hotel was just 10 mins away from the airport and so there was a shuttle running every hour to and fro, free of cost. We took a shuttle and reached our hotel. By the time we came out for a stroll it had started drizzling but it couldn't dampen our spirit of taking a first view of Zurich (also we were damn hungry so we had no choice ). We walked around , shopped a little and went to this great cafe which had such amazing breads and tarts and pastries and ohh I'm salivating.\n\nWhat a hearty lunch we had there. While coming back we picked up some berries and the quality of fruits will open your eyes wide. Even a non fruit lover will grab them.\n\nWe came back from Zermatt to Tasch by 4 pm and enjoyed some fresh salads and wine and called it a day.\n\nPro tip of the day -\n\n1. Do get down on the stations while going to Gornergrat as you can play in snow and have fun at your leisure.\n\n2. Do try and go to Sunnegga lake . It's a lovely picnic spot.\n\nThis was the saddest day of our trip. Why? Because it was the last day and we JUST DIDN'T want to come back. Not yet! Also it was going to be an eventful day as we had to change 2 trains to reach Zermatt station with our luggage to catch our flight on time. And as the day unfolded,it turned out exactly as we thought..... Eventful!.\n\nSo we'd booked the tickets through an online app SBB mobile which offers great discounts and regular passes. We started in the morning at 9 with our 25 kgs of suitcases each which, considering 2 women shopaholic fashionistas travellers, is light weight luggage. We reached the Tasch station which was hardly 50 metres from our hotel. Turned our we had entered on the wrong platform. The train was 5 mins away and we came out and ran towards the correct platform. We were running on the nick of time and could not afford any delay but I, twice, accidentally pressed a Stop button in the train and it haulted on the next 2 stations. Unlike India, there is no penalty on stopping the train without any reason but I didn't know it then and so when I saw the TC coming towards us,my breath stopped and when she passed us I went Phew! Then we reached the 2nd station and changed the train. We boarded and got relaxed that now we will reach airport and from there it will be a piece of cake but cake and us serial dieters? No chance! As soon as we sat,I saw the app to see how many stations away we are from the airport and it showed that due to some strike the line ,on which we were travelling, is close and we will have to change another train after 3 stations to reach airport. Thankfully the systems are well in place, the timings of trains are impeccably correct and the people in this case this train's TC, are very helpful and they explain things thoroughly. We changed a third train! Remember 25 kgs suitcases? Well!\n\nWe reached airport,ate , shopped and checked in. The gentleman at the check in counter was surprised how our luggage was so precisely packed weight wise. Little did he know how many calculations and efforts went behind it.\n\nWe had a 50 mins layover in vienna. We literally sprinted to catch our connecting flight. We reached to the counter to take boarding pass and lo and behold, a new misery waiting for us. Due to mergers of airlines our airline was over booked, bouble seats allotted and what we could make out from the way they were talking.. our name was not there!!! We waited for some 20 mins , and they finally gave us the seats. Phew!\n\nSo when we reached India, we were quite sure that in all the chaos at Vienna,definitely our suitcases were not boarded and voila!! This time we were right!! They were not boarded and still in Vienna. It took 3 days of following up for us to finally receive our suitcases but when we opened them, all the goodies, collectables and chocolates we'd bought on our trip made and all the memories made everything worth while.\n\nPro tip of the day -\n\n1. Do use SBB app if you are going to use train as it gives good discounts.\n\n2. However meticulously you plan your trip only days like this makes them memorable."
