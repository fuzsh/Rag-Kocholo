        "text": "The main access to/from the trains at Chur train station is typical of many major Swiss stations.\n\nA wide passage way runs beneath the railway lines and both slopes and stairs link the gleis (platforms/tracks) - where most the trains arrive/depart, with this passage way.\n\nNote that you donât have to use the stairs to access the passage way, there will be a slope/ramp providing step free access, but you may have to walk passed the stairs to find it.\n\nHowever, there are no lifts or escalators, which link this passage to and from the gleis (platforms/tracks).\n\nAt the end of this passage way is the main ticket office, the SBB Reisezentrum.\n\nAt Chur this SBB ticket and reservations office also sells tickets for the RhB trains.\n\nNote that if you will be taking a train from Chur, that the main ticket office is at this lower level.\n\nBy the ticket office are escalators, an elevator and stairs that link the passage way to a street level exit, but this is mainly used as the route to track 2, which is used by the trains to Arosa.\n\nAnd when a train to Arosa is in the station it will in effect, block the route to the bus stops and the town\n\nSo if you are heading to/from the town centre or taxi rank, use the escalators, farther ahead at the far end of the passage way, which point the way to Bahnhofplatz, there are also elevators up to street level over to the left.\n\nSo when heading into the station from the town centre, you can also use these elevators, which are to the right of the escalators (that have the map of Switzerland above them).\n\nThere are escalators and lifts that connect the platforms/tracks/gleis in the main station to the Post-Bus terminal which is located above the train station.\n\nWhen arriving by train from destinations to the north including Buchs and Zurich, these escalators/lifts will be towards the front of the train.\n\nThis Post-Bus terminal also has lifts and escalators that connect it to the street below, go to the left as you enter the bus station.\n\nSo if you want/need to use the escalators or lifts, then accessing the trains/street via the Post-Bus terminal is an alternative to using the main passage way at the station.\n\nThis street entrance from the Post-Bus terminal is on the far end of the station area; so using the passage beneath the tracks is a more direct route to the town centre.\n\nThe RhB (Rhaetian Bahn) trains between Chur and Disentis, Klosters, Scuol-Tarasp and St Moritz all depart from/arrive the main part of Chur station.\n\nThe express trains from Zurich tend to arrive at gleis (platform/track) 9, while the RhB trains towards St Moritz use gleis (platform/track) 10 - so usually all you have to do is cross the platform from one side to another, when making this transfer.\n\nThe Glacier and Bernina Express trains both also usually depart from gleis (platform/track)10.\n\nSomething to watch out for is that Glacier Express coaches can be joined to ordinary RhB trains heading to St Moritz.\n\nSo if you see a Glacier Express waiting to depart, but you donât have Glacier Express tickets, you may have to walk along the gleis (platform/track) to find the ordinary coaches.\n\nThe Rhb trains to/from Disentis and Klosters tend to depart from arrive atÂ gleis (platform/track)Â 11 and 12, so you will need to access the passage beneath the tracks, to make this connection.\n\nThe RhB trains to Arosa depart from gleis (platform/track) 2, which is located on the Bahnhofplatz, the square in front of the station -Â they use what will look like tram tracks.\n\nTo access these trains when arriving at Chur on SBB trains, the steps to take are:\n\n(1) Descend from the gleis (platform/track), that you will have arrived at in the main station, down to the passage way that runs beneath the railway lines.\n\n(2) Then ascend from this passage way into the main station hall at street level - the trains to Arosa depart from the street outside this main hall.\n\nDon't use the escalators that will be directly ahead of you, they lead to the town centre, instead follow theÂ signsÂ pointing the way to the Arosa trains on track 2\n\nThe stairs are the most obvious route, but there is an elevator available.\n\nSo donât be surprised on exiting Chur station to see a full size train on the road in front of you.\n\nItâs why when heading to the town centre or taxi ranks, using the escalators at the far end of the passage way is the best option -Â as this route takes you under these railway tracks on the station forecourt.\n\nThe ski resorts at Flims and Laxx can be reached from Chur station on Post Bus route 81 - the stop at 'Flims Dorf, Bergbahnen' is by the cable car station which gives access to the Laax-Flims-Falera ski runs.\n\nThe bus journey to Flims Dorf takes 34 min and Laax is 10-12 mins further on.\n\nSBB will sell tickets for end-2-end journeys which include the train to Chur and the Post Bus to Flims or Laax.\n\nThe Post Buses depart/from arrive at their own dedicated bus station, which is above the platforms/tracks/gleis in the main part of Chur station.\n\nThis bus station is linked to these platforms/tracks/gleis by escalators and lifts.\n\nIf you arrive by SBB train itâs likely that these escalators and lifts will be towards the front of the train.\n\nYou will have have to walk past the escalator to access the lift.\n\nThe local buses to other parts of the town and the surrounding areas, depart from stops at the opposite side of the Bahnhofplatz to the Arosa line railway tracks.\n\nThey don't leave from the Post Bus station that is above the train station.\n\nSo if you will be taking a local bus, there are two routes to the bus stands from the main passage away beneath the railway lines\n\n(1) Follow the signs to track 1 (used by some of the trains to Arosa), on the left is a ramp and to the right there are stairs.\n\n(2) Use the escalator at the far end of the passageway beneath the track, then from this Bahnhof platz exit, turn to the right to access the bus stands, they will be behind you,\n\nThis second version of ShowMeTheJourney is exciting and new, so we are genuinely thrilled that you are here and reading this, but we also need your help.\n\nWeâre striving not to let anything get in the way of providing the most useful service possible, hence a facility has been set up with DonorBox which can be used to support the running costs and make improvements.\n\nInstead of advertising or paywalls, your financial support will make a positive difference to delivering an enhanced service, as thereâs a lot of ideas which we want to make happen.\n\nSo if you have found the info provided here to be useful, please go here to say thank you."
