        "text": "It is the last wastewater railway in Switzerland. No motor powers the funicular instead wastewater from the upper town. A very special fragrance lingers in the air when the water tank beneath this vehicle is once again filled at the station - and the \"Funi\" has certainly earned its place on the list of cultural treasures of national importance.\n\nAscending a total 56.4 climb in altitude, the upper carriage uses filtered wastewater from the city in a 3000 liter tank (weight) to power it - and the driver regulates speed with the aid of cogwheel.\n\nIt's worth making a detour to hear the clanking and creaking of this century-old green railway, still running today thanks to the support of the Fribourg population – just a few minutes' walk from Fribourg station.\n\nAltitude: 605m\n\nAccessibility:\n\nOn the Bern–Lausanne train route; the Funi is reached in just a few minutes from the station\n\nView: from the upper station, view over the Old Town and over the river Sarine.\n\nAttractions: the funicular is a genuine experience; Old Town round tour to the cathedral\n\nCulinary aspects: Speciality restaurants in the Old Town\n\nOvernight stays: Hôtel de la Rose in the lower town (Old Town)\n\nGroups: Urban Golf in the Old Town\n\nWinter: The \"Funi\" also runs in winter\n\nSpecial comments: The over century-old funicular was subject to total renovation and shines today in its original green colour"
