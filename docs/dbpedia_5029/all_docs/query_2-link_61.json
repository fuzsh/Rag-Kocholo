        "text": "The Swiss canton of Fribourg is a little off the beaten tourist track. Located between Geneva and Bern, itâ€™s a region many travellers pass through on the way to somewhere else.\n\nItâ€™s well worth spending some time in Fribourg, however. This area has a rich cultural heritage with charming local traditions and customs. The canton is also abundant in nature and has a burgeoning gastronomic scene.\n\nThere are various attractive towns and villages in Fribourg. From the home of GruyÃ¨re cheese or fine local wines to a range of outdoor pursuits, Fribourg has lots to entertain the international traveller.\n\nThis guide will outline the key features of Fribourg canton, including its most attractive towns and villages, where to enjoy the outdoors, the culinary delights not to miss, how to get there and where to stay.\n\nRead on to discover more about this delightful part of Switzerland.\n\nðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ Learn more about Canton Fribourg on episode 22 of our podcast.\n\n[This post may contain compensated links. Please see my disclosure policy for more information.]\n\nWhere is Fribourg?\n\nFribourg is located in western Switzerland. It is bordered by the canton of Vaud to the west and south, as well as Lake NeuchÃ¢tel. The canton of Bern lies to the east.\n\nThe canton of Fribourg is situated on an elevated Swiss plateau. In the west, the land is largely flat, but rises gradually towards the Pre-Alps in the east and south of the canton. The southerly La GruyÃ¨re district has the highest peaks, including Vanil Noir at 2,389 metres above sea level.\n\nFribourg can easily be accessed from Bern or Geneva, as well as other major Swiss towns and cities.\n\nCharacteristics of Fribourg\n\nThis Swiss canton still practices many traditions reaching far back in time, encompassing art, architecture and agriculture. There are also many gastronomic delights to sample in the canton.\n\nAs something of a melting pot of German and French culture, Fribourg is characterised by aspects of both.\n\nFribourg cantonâ€™s rich cultural heritage is celebrated with the utmost care and pride by its inhabitants. The medieval settlements â€“ including the capital Fribourg, as well as Estavayer-le-Lac and GruyÃ¨res â€“ are picturesque and packed with narrow lanes that are hives of activity.\n\nFor those who appreciate architecture, there are numerous forts, castles, churches, monasteries and manor houses to discover.\n\nThe Fribourg region is also known for its tradition of poya paintings, the ascent (poya) and descent (dÃ©salpe) of its cattle, and seasonal Benichon (Thanksgiving) celebrations.\n\nThe La GruyÃ¨re region is also characterised by farming and its festivals â€“ both are showcased at Bulleâ€™s MusÃ©e GruÃ©rien. K\n\nnown for its famous Swiss cheese, La GruyÃ¨re is also famous for another dairy product â€“ its double cream. There is in fact a festival devoted solely to this, held annually in mid-June.\n\nIn fact Fribourg canton is home to many gastronomic delights, including fondue, GruyÃ¨re cheese and freshwater fish from the many local lakes. Sweet treats include chocolates and meringues served with double cream.\n\nFribourg, capital city of the canton of Fribourg\n\nThe capital of Fribourg canton is the city of the same name. (It is also known by its German name of Freiburg.) Its Gothic architecture â€“ especially St. Nicholas Cathedral â€“ enchants visitors. Fribourg city also boasts over two hundred entire streets with Gothic faÃ§ades dating back to the 1600s.\n\nThe city also has fourteen bridges and twelve fountains, all of which are worth a visit. There is plenty to see and do here, including the Old Town, the cathedral and its tower, and the funicular railway.\n\nWhat to see and do in Fribourg\n\nThe top attractions and things to do in Fribourg include the following:\n\nFribourg Old Town\n\nFribourg Old Town features over two hundred original Gothic faÃ§ades. This makes it one of the biggest remaining medieval settlements in modern Europe. Wandering the narrow lanes is a highlight of any visit.\n\nThere are a dozen historic fountains in Fribourg. These feature columns that support important and historic biblical or allegorical figures, such as Jean Tinguelyâ€™s Jo Siffert Fountain.\n\nFourteen bridges also characterise the townscape, and each is unique in design and appearance.\n\nFribourg Funicular\n\nKnown locally as the â€˜funiâ€™, Fribourgâ€™s funicular forms part of the cityâ€™s public transport system. It dates back to 1899, when it first began taking passengers between the centre of town and the lower town.\n\nListed as a national cultural asset, it is Switzerlandâ€™s sole remaining funicular railway powered by water ballast. The ballast drive uses municipal wastewater, so while this is not entirely odourless, the power source certainly never runs dry.\n\nGothic Cathedral and tower\n\nThe Gothic architecture of St. Nicholas Cathedral also attracts many visitors. Its observation tower is 74 metres high and there are 365 steps â€“ one for every day of the year â€“ to the top.\n\nItâ€™s well worth the effort to climb to the top as the views over Fribourg are spectacular.\n\nConstruction of the cathedral began in 1283 and it is Fribourgâ€™s key landmark. On the main door there is a Last Judgement Bas relief. The structure also boasts breathtaking glass windows and historic organs.\n\nAttractive towns and villages in Fribourg\n\nOther than Fribourg city, the cantonâ€™s most appealing villages and towns include Murten, Vully, Bulle, Charmey, Estavayer-le-Lac and GruyÃ¨res.\n\nMurten\n\nMurten overlooks the lake of the same name and is the capital of Fribourgâ€™s Lake District.\n\nDating back to the Middle Ages, the Old Townâ€™s walls form part of the townâ€™s ancient fortification. The combination of towers, narrow staircases, dungeons and secret rooms really bring history to life here.\n\nAnother draw for history fans is the Murten Museum.\n\nA stroll through the lanes of Murtenâ€™s Old Town is a must, where visitors can see historic fountains and original town houses. From the castle, Mount Vullyâ€™s vineyards can be seen, as well as the lake.\n\nThe wines from Mt. Vully can be sampled in Old Town or lakeside taverns â€“ perfect to wash down a dish of fresh local fish.\n\nVully\n\nVully is directly across the lake from Murten and is known as the areaâ€™s riviera. It can be reached via boat from Murten.\n\nSpectacular views over the lakes, vineyards and Bernese Alps can also be enjoyed from Mont Vully, even though it is just 653 metres high.\n\nThe mountainâ€™s lower slopes are home to various grape-growing villages, and the first vines were established by the Romans around 2,000 years ago.\n\nVullyâ€™s vineyards occupy 1% of Switzerlandâ€™s cultivated area in Switzerland, and the excellent wines produced can be sampled locally.\n\nAround 40 species of vegetable are also grown in Grosses Moos nearby â€“ widely regarded as the countryâ€™s key vegetable-growing area.\n\nDue to these factors â€“ and the local fish â€“ Vully is known as a gourmetâ€™s paradise. There are also scenic walking, hiking and cycling trails and a vineyard path.\n\nCharmey\n\nAs the name suggests, Charmey is a charming Swiss mountain village, offering visitors the chance to sample the authentic lifestyle of Fribourgâ€™s region. Travellers can also partake in a variety of outdoor pastimes.\n\nA tradition not to be missed is the DÃ©salpe festival, which takes place annually on the last Saturday in September. This is when the local farmers bring their cattle down from the Alpine pastures on which they graze in summer.\n\nFor those who wish to relax at any time of year, the â€˜Bains de la GruyÃ¨reâ€™ (thermal waters) offer complete indulgence, with uninterrupted views over the surrounding mountains.\n\nAdrenaline fans, meanwhile, should head for the local zip line which runs between Vounetse station â€“ 1,627 metres above sea level â€“ to the Rapido Sky adventure park 400 metres below.\n\nThere are 11 zip lines, where visitors can ride up to 200 metres against a Pre-Alps backdrop.\n\nFans of adventure can also enjoy hiking, mountain biking and skiing.\n\nClose to Charmey is La Valsainte, a Carthusian monastery dating back to 1294. Around 80% of the monastery was destroyed by the end of the French invasion, so the monks began to reconstruct it in 1863.\n\nThe monks still inhabit the Carthusian monastery today.\n\nThe MusÃ©e de Charmey showcases local art, history, and traditions â€“ as well as an intriguing insight into life as a monk.\n\nBulle\n\nBulle lies at the foot of the Pre-Alps and is the cantonâ€™s second biggest town. Despite Bulleâ€™s modern commercial centre, the La GruyÃ¨re region has a century-old tradition of cattle fairs, now based at â€˜Espace GruyÃ¨reâ€™ â€“ the Congress and Events Centre in Bulle.\n\nDuring late autumn, the â€˜Salon Suisse des GoÃ»ts et Terroirsâ€™ is a national food festival uniting almost 300 producers of Swiss specialities. These include artisans from Fribourg canton.\n\nA traditional weekly market is held in Bulle each Thursday morning, all year round in the market square. This lively gathering offers arts and crafts as well as authentic delicacies.\n\nBulleâ€™s centre is overlooked by its 14th century fortified castle. The MusÃ©e GruÃ©rien is located here and is the ideal place to discover the culture and history of an area so rich in tradition.\n\nBulle offers the visitor a lively calendar of cultural events and a fascinating culinary heritage. Visitors can also take a trip on the fondue train or a self-guided historic walking tour.\n\nEstavayer-le-Lac\n\nEstavayer-le-Lac is a small medieval town on Lake NeuchÃ¢telâ€™s south bank. Its ancient centre is characterised by narrow lanes, where visitors and locals love to stroll. The lakeâ€™s shoreline is also a popular place to spend time.\n\nSwimmers adore the sandy coves and beaches. Estavayer-le-Lac has attracted keen wakeboarders for a long time. The town has an 800 metre cable car, transporting skiers across the water.\n\nThere is also the Alphasurf Water Sports Centre, where sailing, water skiing, stand-up paddleboarding, canoeing and windsurfing can be enjoyed.Visitors can also relax by the lake, perhaps while enjoying a fondue at the waterfront Restaurant La DÃ©rive.\n\nEstavayer-le-Lac is also situated in the Grande CariÃ§aieâ€™s centre. This 3,000 hectare nature reserve offers 50 kilometres of cycling and hiking trails through the wetlands.\n\nGruyÃ¨res\n\nA member of the Most Beautiful Villages of Switzerland, GruyÃ¨res is world famous for its Swiss cheese. It is also known all over Switzerland for double cream.\n\nThe town also has appealing traffic-free streets, with abundant photo opportunities at every turn. It really is a picture-perfect medieval village with an alpine flair.\n\nAt GruyÃ¨res Castle travellers can be taken on a trip through time via a multimedia show. Exploring the 13th century fortress and viewing the exhibitions are also must do activities. There are superb Alpine panoramas from the Castle terrace.\n\nThere are many culinary highlights in GruyÃ¨res (read on for more info) which can be enjoyed at a range of traditional restaurants, the Fondue Academy, La Maison du GruyÃ¨re, the Chocolaterie de GruyÃ¨res and the Maison Cailler nearby.\n\nðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ Read our full guide to GruyÃ¨res here\n\nBest places to enjoy the outdoors in Fribourg\n\nA variety of outdoor activities are popular in the canton of Fribourg. These include hiking, walking, biking and skiing as well as water sports.\n\nMany of the areaâ€™s outdoor pursuits are centred on the lakes. Estavayer-le-Lac, for instance, has an impressive water sports centre, while Vully offers a circular cycle route around the lake. In fact the Vully region is famous for its outstanding cycle networks.\n\nThrill seekers can head to Charmey, where the zip line is hugely popular. There are also hiking, biking and walking trails that are easily accessed from various towns and villages in the region.\n\nMoleson and the Three Lakes areas are also very popular with outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nMolÃ©son\n\nNot far from GruyÃ¨res is the Mount MolÃ©son recreation area, named after the village of MolÃ©son-sur-GruyÃ¨res that overlooks GruyÃ¨res and the plain of â€˜Les Marchesâ€™. The countryside close to Lake GruyÃ¨re offers ideal conditions for hiking and mountain biking tours.\n\nFor skiers, the family-friendly area of La Chia is just five minutesâ€™ from Bulle and features snowshoeing trails as well as ski slopes. The MolÃ©son mountain offers incredible views of the Pre-Alps and is popular in winter for its black ski slope, lengthy snowshoeing trails and a sizeable sledge run.\n\nDuring summer, outdoor enthusiasts descend on the area for hiking, trail running and mountain biking. There is a national cycle route leading towards Les Paccots. Other activities available in the area include a summer toboggan run and outdoor go-karts.\n\nThree Lakes\n\nThe Three Lakes route comprises three hiking stages between Lakes NeuchÃ¢tel and Murten. It is very popular with nature lovers, and the local fauna tend to be most active soon after sunrise.\n\nLa Sauge Nature Conservation Centre and a series of wooden bridges allow visitors to get up fairly close to the local wildlife. There are also sandy swimming beaches to enjoy.\n\nCulinary specialties of Fribourg\n\nSampling culinary specialities and fine wines are a highlight of any visit to the canton of Fribourg. These include the famous GruyÃ¨re cheese, wines from Vully, Swiss fondue, fine chocolates, Vully tart, Nidelkuchen and meringues with double cream, all of which you can read more about below.\n\nGruyÃ¨res Cheese â€“ including fondue\n\nAlso known as â€˜moitiÃ©-moitieâ€™, a speciality of the GruyÃ¨re region is fondue.
