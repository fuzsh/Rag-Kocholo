        "text": "Pierre Trudeau was prime minister of Canada for nearly 16 years beginning in 1968.\n\nA professor before he jumped into politics with the Liberal party, Pierre Trudeau entered office with a brainy charisma and youthful energy which seemed to match the changing mood of the 1960s. (His popularity was dubbed “Trudeaumania” in an echo of “Beatlemania.”) He remained prime minister until 1984, save for a 10-month period in 1979-80 when he was replaced by Progressive Conservative leader Joe Clark. Among his many initiatives as prime minister, Trudeau was particularly known for leading the fight against the separatist movement in Quebec."
