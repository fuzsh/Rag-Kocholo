        "text": "âMaher delivers a full-length treatment of the Prime Minister and his government that is both comprehensive and insightful. . . Stephen Maher has delivered a thoroughly researched and fair-minded accounting of Justin Trudeauâs accomplishments and failings. If journalism is the first draft of history, The Prince is a convincing second draft.â\n\nâ The Globe and Mail\n\nâSensational . . . It deftly captures what went on behind the scenes in Trudeauâs big successes, along with his big failures. The bookâs strengths are in Maherâs interviews with top political players who speak candidly about what itâs really like in political Ottawaâs backrooms. The book is a must-read for anyone interested in politics and the prime minister.â\n\nâ The Hill Times\n\nâAn extraordinary book which traces this descent into hell is becoming a hit in English Canada. It's definitely worth reading if you want to understand how Trudeau got so low in the polls today.â\n\nâ Le Journal de Montreal\n\nâI just finished Stephen Maher's The Prince and highly recommend it, even to those who closely follow Canadian politics. Itâs the best Justin Trudeau biography Iâve read so far, and it is fair, accurate, and balanced.â\n\nâ DON MARTIN, columnist, CTVNews.ca\n\nâ[An] engaging and even-handed book on the prime ministerâ\n\nâ LAWRENCE MARTIN, Public Affairs Columnist, The Globe & Mail\n\nâThis is a compelling examination of Justinâs time in office.â\n\nâ Hello! Canada\n\nâThe Prince is a fast-paced, highly readable political narrative informed by interviews with more than 200 insiders, including Trudeau himself. . . The book carefully plots the downward trajectory of Trudeauâs time in power.â\n\nâ Zoomer.com\n\nâMaher has juicy stuff from behind the scenes.â\n\nâ The Hill Times\n\nâCompelling new book. . . as authoritative as it is newsworthy.â\n\nâ SaltWire.com"
