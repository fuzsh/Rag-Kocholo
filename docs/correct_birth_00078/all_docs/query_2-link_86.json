        "text": "Authorities in Pabna district in Bangladesh initiated an investigation on Thursday and pledged to take action following the discovery of a forged birth certificate bearing the name of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nThe fraudulent document falsely indicated that Trudeau was the offspring of Pierre Trudeau and Margaret Trudeau, mirroring the Canadian premier's lineage.\n\nThe forged certificate, allegedly originating from the Ahmedpur union of Sujanagar upazila in Pabna, appears to have exploited the strong security measures of Bangladesh's national server for registering birth records.\n\nAccording to the false document issued by the union parishad, Trudeau was born in Pabna on December 25, 1971, with the birth allegedly registered on January 1, 2007.\n\nLocal residents accused Niloy Hossain, a computer operator at the union parishad, of being involved in the issuance of many counterfeit birth certificates in exchange for financial gain, raising suspicions about his probable involvement in this case.\n\nHowever, Niloy could not be reached for comment, and Ahmedpur union parishad secretary Awlad Hasan denied any knowledge of the situation.\n\nSukhmoy Sarkar, the upazila nirbahi officer of Sujanagar, confirmed that authorities were actively investigating the incident.\n\n‘I can’t tell you anything in advance about the matter. It might be hacked by someone. Now that the matter is under our investigation, we hope that the real matter will be known after the investigation,’ said Sarkar, the top government officer in the locality.\n\nHe said that whoever was found guilty would be punished."
