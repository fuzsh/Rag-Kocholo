        "text": "Vastel’s book was initially published in Quebec as Trudeau le\n\nQuébécois. That is a much better description of its contents than the\n\npresent subtitle, The Life of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, suggests. This is\n\nnot a life at all; instead it is an analysis, if a diatribe can be so\n\ndignified, of Trudeau’s relations with his native province. The author\n\naims to demonstrate that Trudeau was always an outsider, one who\n\nmistrusted his Québécois compatriots to the point of self-hate.\n\nIt goes without saying that this is a book with a mission. Vastel, born\n\nin France and an immigrant to Canada two decades ago, began as an\n\nadmirer of the former prime minister. His developing nationalisme,\n\nhowever, soon persuaded him that Trudeau was a traitor to his native\n\nprovince. This book is part and parcel of the denigrating attack on\n\nTrudeau and federalism (and, incidentally, Jean Chrétien) that passes\n\ntoday for French-language journalism in Quebec as it seeks the breakup\n\nof the federal union.\n\nThat is not to say that there is nothing useful here. Vastel has worked\n\nhis way through school yearbooks and newspapers to track down\n\nTrudeau’s earliest activities and writings. This is fascinating\n\nmaterial, enough even to justify the purchase of the book. But stop\n\nafter the first few chapters—most of the remainder adds nothing to an\n\nunderstanding of Trudeau or his times."
