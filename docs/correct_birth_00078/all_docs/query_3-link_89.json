        "text": "Pierre Philippe Yves Elliot Trudeau, better known as Pierre Trudeau, was an author, a university professor, a lawyer and a politician. Through his political actions, as well as through his personality, he stimulated a great deal of emotions, both positive and negative, among the Canadian public. Thus making him a very memorable figure. He introduced important political initiatives, which strongly influenced many aspects of Canadian political and private life. His significance is still recognized by Canadians at present, which is illustrated by the fact that in 2004, he was selected as the\n\nPierre Elliot Trudeau was the fifteenth prime minister of Canada. He had many accomplishments that benefited all of Canada which include the official language act of Canada where he made French and English the official languages, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom, and the liberalization of laws on abortion, homosexuality and the legalization of lotteries. These are only a few of the many accomplishments that Pierre Trudeau achieved for Canada while his position in Parliament that was important.\n\nPierre Trudeau was Prime Minister from April 20, 1968, to June 4, 1979, and again from March 3, 1980, to June 30, 1984. He was known as a womanizer and a super star. This was extremely odd for a Canadian politician getting this much attention especially in this time period. While he was an entertainer and a bachelor, he was also a very smart man. He began his journey into joining the liberal party and was appointed Lester B. Pearson’s parliamentary secretary and later became\n\nThe first way that the Charter has improved the quality of life for Canadians is through its section on Fundamental Freedoms, it ensures that Canadians are guaranteed the right to express their opinions, choose their own religion, organize peaceful meetings, and associate with any person or group. These four subsections have gone miles in improving the comfort Canadians now experience, starting off with the right to express your opinions, this has been a big problem for First Nations when they were taken into residential schools and were not allowed to express their opinions on whether they wanted to be a part of them, as in if they did they would\n\nHe was in charge for putting into action a universal healthcare system for all of Canada. “Canadians must have equal access to state-provided medical services. Parliament passed the Medical Care Act in 1966 but financial exigencies postponed its operation for a year”(English, 2005). This form of social welfare was different for the time compared to other countries. With the system that he implemented this has given Canadians a lot of freedom financially. This has changed Canadian citizens in a way where\n\nPierre Trudeau is one of Canada’s most renowned Prime Ministers. He was in office April 20, 1968, to June 4, 1979, and later on March 3, 1980, to June 30, 1984,.¹ An event that Pierre Trudeau is well known for is the enactment of the War Measures Act during the October Crisis. This decision to invoke the War Measures Act during the October Crisis has led to a great deal of controversy on whether the act was justified. The October Crisis was a series of events in October 1970, these events began with the kidnappings of James Cross and later Pierre Laporte by the group known as the FLQ (Front de libération du Québec) the group’s main goals were to create an independent Quebec.2 The group resorted to terrorist acts in order to achieve those goals, this later led to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau invoking the War Measures Act. The War Measures Act was a federal statute adopted by parliament during WWI and has been used 3 times; during WWI, WWII and during the October Crisis. The act gives major power to the Canadian government to uphold security during times of great distress.3 Pierre Trudeau was justified in enacting the War Measures Act during the October Crisis. One reason that Pierre Trudeau was justified in invoking the War Measures Act is that the FLQ was essentially a terrorist organization responsible for the deaths and injuries of countless people. Since the group was formed in the early 1960’s, the terrorist group’s acts had only worsened from mailbox bombings to\n\nPierre Trudeau was the 15th prime minister of Canada. During his time as prime minister he changed a lot of Canadians lives for the better. He also, made history that will never be forgotten by past, present and future Canadians. Pierre Trudeau kept Canada united, avoiding Quebec to separate from Canada. Trudeau passed many the “Official Language Act” in 1969 making English and French Canada’s official languages. This act made government workers to offer services in both English and French. Trudeau passed many bills and acts, which adequately helped Canada to develop more as a nation. He abolished the death penalty in 1976 which didn’t make people die for the crimes they did or did not commit. He strengthened gun control laws so deaths by gun\n\nPierre Trudeau made Canada what it is today in a positive manner by creating the Constitutions Act as well as the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Constitutions Act started in 1982. The act allowed everyone to have fundamental freedoms. Those fundamental freedoms included: freedom of conscience and religion, freedom of thought, belief, opinion, expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and the freedom of association as stated in the Constitution Act of 1982. The Act also includes mobility rights that include: every citizen of Canada has the right to enter, remain in and leave Canada itself with no troubles at all, and to move into any province with no troubles. The constitution act had equality rights as well, some in which were and are that every individual is equal under the law and has the right to protection of themselves and their families, as well as living with no discrimination based on their race, origin, nationality, religion, sex, age, or disability. The Constitution Act included the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the right and freedom to reasonable limits allowed by the law and can be certainly justified in a free and\n\nHaving lived in Canada when I was 8 before the US-Canada magazine dispute occurred, I found myself thoroughly engrossed in Canadian culture. It seemed a perfect culture, built to protect domestic interests and despite the potential division between countries, created a safe environment where people were unafraid to leave doors unlocked, due to almost no crime. The peaceful and respectful nature of most Canadians isn’t just a fluke, the country was designed this way, and one of the primary influencers of this strategy is the media. Watching the news in Canada, the focus is positive, the message is positive, there is no forced fear of sense of doom as we see here in the US. Life is about being sustainable, not so much a struggle to the top of the food chain, but working together, instead of separating and segregating groups. That is except the region of French Quebec; however, Quebec is like a whole new country in itself.\n\nPierre Elliot Trudeau was arguably one of the most vivacious and charismatic Prime Ministers Canada has ever seen. He wore capes, dated celebrities and always wore a red rose boutonniere. He looked like a superhero, and often acted like one too. Some of the landmark occurrences in Canadian history all happened during the Trudeau era, such as patriating the constitution, creating the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the 1980 Quebec Referendum. However, it is Trudeau’s 1969 “white paper” and the Calder legal challenge which many consider to be one of his most influential contributions to Canadian history.\n\nI think Donald Trump has made a big impact on Canadian society in a bad way. Canada’s close relationship with America has been rattled by the election of Donald Trump, Donald Trump made radically overhauling U.S. trade arrangements a key issue in his campaign, and this issue could have the greatest effect on Canada. If trump sticks to his word there will be a Hard-won progress in the fight against climate change will be dramatically rolled back, Trump also vowed to back the United States out of the 2015 Paris agreement, a landmark international climate treaty aimed at curbing emissions and limiting global temperature increases. If anything good is to come out of him being president it is that"
