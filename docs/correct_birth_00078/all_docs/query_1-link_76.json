        "text": "Pierre Elliott Trudeau (1919–2000), the 15th prime minister of Canada,\n\nwas a man of intellect and a charismatic leader who, in 1982, “brought\n\nhome” the Constitution of Canada from Britain and incorporated in it\n\nthe Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nThis biography of him, for the most part, is balanced and well written.\n\nAlthough subjects ranging from the Constitution to the October Crisis to\n\nfamily life receive adequate coverage, the book would have benefited\n\nfrom a fuller discussion of Western alienation, Trudeau’s fiscal\n\npolicy, and his involvement in Quebec’s Quiet Revolution (including\n\nhis Cité libre days). An index would have been helpful, too. Readers\n\nunfamiliar with Trudeau and his political successes and failures will\n\nfind the book interesting and informative."
