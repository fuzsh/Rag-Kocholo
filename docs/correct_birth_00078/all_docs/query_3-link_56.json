        "text": "This weekend marks an important 50th anniversary in Canada and its French speaking province of Quebec.\n\nOn June 24, 1968, Pierre Trudeau was attacked by Quebec nationalists throwing rocks and bottles at the platform during the parade honoring St. Jean Baptiste Day. But the mayhem backfired on the Quebec separatists, as the image of Trudeau standing firm in the face of hostility was a political boon for Trudeau (whose son Justin Trudeau is now the prime minister of Canada).\n\nIndeed, Canada’s national elections were held the next day on June 25, 1968. Trudeau, who had been serving as interim prime minister since April of that year following the resignation of Prime Minister Lester Pearson, was handed a mandate in Canada along with his Liberal Party. He would then be prime minister for the following 16 years, interrupted only by a brief stint out of power between 1979 and 1980.\n\nTrudeau, who died in 2000, forged an ironic legacy in Canada, especially in relation to the United States. He would become the Canadian prime minister best known and most recognizable in the U.S. That was due to his undeniable charisma and a towering intellect. Yet he was more hostile in his relationship with the United States than any other Canadian prime minister.\n\nHis hostility toward the United States was in particular toward President Richard Nixon. The two leaders detested each other. But here is where the irony is overwhelming. For Trudeau’s political mileage he had garnered out of the St. Jean Baptiste Day riot resembled more than anything Richard Nixon’s law and order message during the 1968 presidential campaign, as Trudeau, himself from Quebec, vowed to “put Quebec in its place.”\n\nJust as Nixon exploited racial tensions and demonstrations against the Vietnam War to portray himself standing up to mob rule, Trudeau fashioned himself the one leader who could deal with tumultuous Quebec nationalism. Indeed, he would again put down Quebec nationalists during the October Crisis of 1970 when the militant Front for the Liberation of Quebec took to the streets in Montreal. Trudeau then declared martial law and when asked by a reporter how far he would go in putting down the militant group, he answered, “Just watch me.”\n\nTrudeau never really succeeded in putting Quebec in its place. Indeed, the same year he became prime minister, separatist leader Rene Levesque bolted from the provincial Liberal Party in Quebec to establish the separatist Parti Quebecois. And Levesque (who could match Trudeau in terms of charisma) led the Parti Quebecois to power in 1976. Trudeau did usher through Parliament the Constitution of Canada which repatriated all 10 provinces. But Quebec to this day has yet to ratify Trudeau’s constitution. And though Trudeau soundly defeated the separatists in the 1980 sovereignty referendum in Quebec, the separatists came within inches of victory in the 1995 sovereignty referendum (losing to a bare 50.6 percent majority).\n\nMore important is the fact that the separatists returned for St. Jean Baptiste Day festivities the year following the 1968 unrest and festivities will be vibrant again this year on the streets of Montreal and Quebec City. Despite being down in current polls, separatists have a way of surviving and remaining relevant in Quebec politics. After the 1980 referendum, Trudeau declared that “separatism is dead.”\n\nQuite the contrary, separatism in Quebec is a light sleeper. And 50 years after Trudeau forged himself into Canadian history compliments of the violent wing of Quebec nationalism, the French-speaking province of Quebec remains the wild card in Canadian politics.\n\nQuebec nationalism remains a force even the multi-talented Pierre Trudeau proved unable to suppress.\n\nJohn O’Neill is an Allen Park freelance writer.
