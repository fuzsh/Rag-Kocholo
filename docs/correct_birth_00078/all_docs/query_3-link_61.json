We are a gateway for bold, cutting-edge doctoral researchers to become Engaged Leaders who have meaningful impact in their communities and institutions.\n\nThe Foundation fosters the development of Engaged Leadership skills through a three-year program centered on curriculum taught by Fellows and Mentors in settings that take Scholars outside of a traditional university setting. By working alongside others who have a diversity of perspectives and come from different backgrounds, Scholars learn leadership by stepping outside their comfort zone.\n\nBeyond providing generous financial support the doctoral research of outstanding Scholars, we support the development of future Engaged Leaders who inspire innovative approaches as they blaze new trails in the Social Sciences and Humanities.\n\nMore than a Scholarship, the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation is a gateway for bold, cutting-edge doctoral researchers to become leaders with meaningful impact in their institutions and communities.\n\nTogether, our Scholars, Mentors, Fellows and alumni form a unique community of academics and leaders who come together to explore new ideas, themes, and horizons.\n\nDiscover\n\nThe Foundation’s community is composed of leaders who explore, ask difficult questions, and discover new horizons.
