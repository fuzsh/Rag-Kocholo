He was born on October 18, 1919, at home (5779 Durocher Street in Outremont--a suburb of Montreal). Details of his birth and early years are described by John English in his book Citizen of the World: The Life of Pierre Elliott Turdeau Volume One: 1919-1968 (pp. 7-9).\n\nThe young Pierre spent the first twelve years of his life in this house on Durocher. According to the City of Montreal tax assessment roles, the two-story, two-family building, measuring 7.2m x 30.48m (232.30 m2), was constructed in 1913.\n\nWhen Trudeau died in 2000, the National Post (September 30, 2000) published an article in which a long-time friend and colleague, Roy Heenan, was quoted as saying \"With the exception of his years in Ottawa, Mr. Trudeau lived all of his life on the slopes of Mount Royal. He spent his early years in Outremont on the French side of the mountain, in a modest yellow-brick row house on Durocher Street, then and now an ethnically mixed neighbourhood where Hasidic Jews live alongside Greeks and pure laine Quebecois. \"He once came in here,\" said Joseph Karmel, who now lives in the lower half of the building. \"He came with his sister, he went upstairs. He took some pictures.\" Mr. Karmel, who has lived at the house for about 20 years, did not know when he moved in that it had once been the home of Canada's prime minister.\n\nAlthough there is no plaque at 5779 Durocher, the address is designated a historic site by the Parliament of Canada\n\nPresident Name: Pierre Elliot TrudeauBirth Place?: yesTerm Of Office: 1968-1984Date of Birth: October 18 1919\n\nVisit Instructions:\n\nPost a photo in front of the historical marker or sign that identifies the building.\n\nPost another photo showing the building.
