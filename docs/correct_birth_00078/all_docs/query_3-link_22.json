        "text": "Pierre Trudeau, who has died of prostate cancer aged 80, was Canada's most intellectual and flamboyant prime minister. His disdain for Quebec nationalism, belief in a bilingual, multicultural federation, and commitment to the constitutional entrenchment of civic rights and freedoms were the hallmarks of his 17 years in government.\n\nElected to the Canadian parliament in 1965, he rose meteorically to the leadership of the Liberal party in 1968. He won three successive general elections, lost to the Conservatives in 1979, then led the Liberals back to power in 1980. In his final government he secured a clear \"no\" vote in Quebec's first referendum on sovereignty-association, and entrenched Canada's constitution with a charter of rights and freedoms.\n\nTrudeau was born in Montreal in 1919. His mother had Scottish and French-Canadian roots. His father was pur laine Québécois , an ambitious Montreal lawyer from a long line of unilingual peasant-farmers. Though his early death traumatised Pierre, his shrewd business deals secured the family a $1m fortune.\n\nAfter completing law school in 1943 and articling for a year in Montreal, he took courses in political economy at Harvard, the Sorbonne and the London School of Economics.\n\nBack in Quebec in 1949, Trudeau was shocked to find the province gripped by Catholic nationalism. In 1965 he stood in the federal election, determined to address the French-Canadian question from Ottawa. In 1967 he entered Lester Pearson's cabinet as justice minister. Trudeau modernised laws on divorce, homosexuality and abortion, arguing that \"the state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation\". But it was his liaisons with women that inverted his mantra of \"reason over passion\". There was nightclubbing at Commonwealth conferences, an affair with Barbra Streisand, and his secret marriage in 1971 to Margaret Sinclair. Some 30 years his junior, she bore him three children, helped to win the 1974 election, and then rebelled with doped-out indiscretions.\n\nTrudeaumania took root in February 1968, when he announced his candidacy for the Liberal leadership. His charisma and ability to reason clearly in both languages appealed at a time when Quebec tensions were, literally, exploding in mail-boxes around Montreal. Canadians adored this sexy genius, who wanted to create a \"just society\". In April 1968 Trudeau, now party leader and sworn in as Canada's 15th prime minister, called a general election, and on June 25, 1968, secured the first federal Liberal majority since 1953. He set Canada on an independent foreign policy course, opening diplomatic links with China and reducing its commitment to Nato. But his main aims were to counter Quebec nationalism, build national unity, overhaul government and ensure Canada's constitutional decolonisation.\n\nWhen Trudeau called a general election in 1972 his campaign strategy proved weak. The love-in was over, and unemployment had soared. The Liberals scraped back to power with 109 seats, against the Tories' 107, and Trudeau formed a minority government with support from the New Democratic party. But inflation and unemployment spiralled as the Liberals were hit by the 1973 oil crisis.\n\nIn May 1979 the Liberals' inability to boost the economy brought Joe Clark's Conservatives to minority government. Trudeau was shattered. In November he announced his retirement. But it was not the end. Three weeks later the Conservative government was defeated. Trudeau stayed on, and in February 1980 won another majority government. In that final term there was the second oil crisis, an intensification of energy battles with western Canada, and new tensions in the relationship with the United States. But the May 1980 Quebec referendum produced a clear 60-40 victory for the federalists.\n\nIn 1982 the Queen and Trudeau signed the proclamation of a new Canadian constitution, and the Quebec government was bound by a charter it loathed. In 1984 Canada was made officially bilingual.\n\nIn many senses Trudeau had won his battle against Quebec nationalism, but he had not managed to create the pan-Canadian nation-building instrument that would fully clarify the relationship between all Canadians and the federal state.\n\nTwo years later he left office and joined a Montreal law firm. He re-emerged in 1987 and 1991 to fight constitutional proposals to recognise Quebec as a distinct society. This won him respect in western Canada, but rekindled nationalist loathing in Quebec. Indeed, in October 1995, when the prime minister, Jean Chrétien, staged a rally in Montreal to save Canada from its closest call in the second Quebec referendum, Trudeau, the man who had championed federalism all his life, was asked to stay away.
