        "text": "Maurene Wells has lost herself in a world of romance novels and has settled into being the family’s weary peace-keeper. Burdened by the guilt of a past secret, she often thinks God is punishing her. Yet, as her family is falling apart, a spark of fight emerges and truth may just set her free.\n\nAdam Wells was once a world-renowned child evangelist. His drive for a successful pastorate leads him to a dying church in a sleepy Texas town, while his family is spiraling out of control. When the town’s nativity is torched, the national spotlight shifts to the city and brings him back to his glory days... but it may cost him his family and even his life.\n\nAnne Wells, a Goth teen, hides in darkness, emotionally distancing herself from her parents. The new move to a desolate Texas town has deepened her resentment and defiance against her father as he desperately tries to reach her. A battle rages within her as hidden secrets leave her even more confused while searching for truth.\n\nCalvin Clayman, a former classmate of Adam and Maurene, makes a surprise visit to the town. But the former Class President and Captain of the basketball team has another dubious motive. Calvin has moved from playing ball to playing politics and is willing to share knowledge for the right price.\n\nStephen Miller is the typical All-American small-town boy who is unfailingly polite and eager to make others feel welcome. Unlike any other girl he has met, Stephen quickly falls for Anne. Sensing her deep scars, he has compassion for her and becomes a protector who works to build Anne’s trust.\n\nKyle Tucker is the embodiment of rage. Raised by an alcoholic, abusive father, he has dreams of escaping Leonard, Texas, with his small-town country band, “The Leonard Bullriders.” When Anne Wells moves to town, she affects the two things Kyle cares about - the band and Stephen. Kyle is willing to do almost anything to stop her.\n\nChief Burns is a no-nonsense man with a gruff exterior, but a deep compassion for the people of his jurisdiction. His is the voice of reason amidst the chaos of recent events, but his patience is wearing thin as the media descends upon Leonard and people are divided by what is best for the town.\n\nJoseph Harrison, attorney for the Liberty Institute, is a man with a past...but he found hope via the words spoken by a child over two decades earlier. When that child, now an adult, is in the middle of a national controversy, Harrison is prepared to defend and fight for truth. This time, it is his turn to offer hope.\n\nSenator John Cutter is a power-hungry man who is used to getting his own way. Now retired, his focus is on keeping his young wife happy and dependant upon him. When Candy responds to Pastor Wells message of Hope, Cutter will go to any length necessary to remain in control...no matter what it takes!"
