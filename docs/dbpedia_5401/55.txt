An Independent Uniquely-Inspiring Story On Film!

BEYOND THE FARTHEST STAR is an independent uniquely-inspiring story on film. It stars Renee O’Connor (Xena, Boogeyman 2), Barry Corbin (No Country for Old Men, Northern Exposure), Todd Terry (Arlington Road, Breaking Bad) and Cherami Leigh (Friday Night Lights, Fast Food Nation). RC works with the producers of the film from inception to casting and production to release. Theatrically released through a Gathr Films city-by-city national distribution, the film requires a grassroots effort from fans. The next step is ancillary markets including DVD, digital download, VOD, cable, TV, foreign and others.

RC works social networks such as Facebook & Twitter, blogs, fan video and main website to develop a strong fan base with continual communication. The Facebook site now has over 20,000 fans who anxiously follow the “Beyond The Farthest Star” updates. RC networks with news media through press releases and contacts for internet buzz, articles and media coverage. Through post-production, Robinson utilizes video, contests and news to release updates to a growing fan base.
