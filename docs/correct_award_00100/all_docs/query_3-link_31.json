        "text": "Money, as a paradoxical concept And money is the human civilization , as nobody can deny it and as essential for all human development(s). In such a context, money starts with three paradoxes of its own (Andrei 2007, pp. 15-17). First, it is man made, written matter and old enough. All the other writings, philosophies and philosophical systems, architecture, civilizations, as human creations, die one after another. They may be the older the more highly valuable, but vestiges at the same. On the contrary, money, as a so old creation, is still and very vivid and working. But there is not its long life already its extraordinary point, but the aspect that the money existence looks endless, as seen from both the oldest times and today. And this is for money, as so similarly to . . . the Scriptures. Plenty of coins, banknotes and other money pieces are subjects of numismatics, but money is still not a vestige. On the other hand, there was once an ideology claiming that money was an economic relation among subjects which would end ones time, in a predictable future. That was communism and recent enough—but it was the communism ending first. The second paradox of money is that it measures what? The market value, isn’t it ? And this is for the long thousands of years that it is. Or, the market value, as a concept, was almost clarified in . . . the nineteenth century, by Marxism and marginalism, two currents of thinking of the same age and geographical origins 3 . I say the value concept, as almost clarified, because the two scholar thoughts saw the value sources in some opposite ways: the Marxian view was finding this source in labour—so, in a factor of production, in the production itself, as opposite to consumption —, whereas marginalists here identified utility and rarity—so, it was market and consumption leading this process. The further these irreconcilable theories in the history of economics, in their turn, the less clear the value concept for the next following 20 th century—and that whereas money does its job without any interference of basic economics. All the more, every State, since the ancient times, declares its metric system of measuring, see length, volume, and money market value. Finally, the third paradox here comes when considering the market value measured by money, as a social convention qualified under another concept—I mean the one of the experiment. Money is an experiment of a really special condition from at least two points of view. Firstly, it is an experiment not made, as usually, just once for some other application to come, but an experiment repeated from its very beginning for its own purpose, as implemented. Nobody doubts about the length, volume or electricity that are measured by our conventional specific units, as much as these dimensions are very material—but nobody doubts about money, as measuring value either, in the same circumstances. Secondly, let us admit that all experiments base and develop from fields It is about the so-called “German ideology”, birth and consuming itself in the second half of the nineteenth century. Actually, Marignalism meant three Schools in Europe: (i) the German and Austrian one, that is here referred (Menger; Bohm-Bowerk); (ii) the Swiss one (Leon Walras; Vilfredo Pareto); (iii) the British one (Alfred Marshall). of science, as individuals. In which conditions, money is agreed to result from the economic field. But then, two problems arise. The first is that the economy and economics, correspondingly, are not quite appropriate to laboratories and experiments 4 , as the exact sciences are likely to be developed, in their turn—experiments in economy are very rare and exceptional 5 . But, let us admit an experiment like money, on a so large scale, as an equally exceptional success. Then, another problem remains: money was born as an experiment of economics, whereas economics were coming to become a very science a long time afterwards."
