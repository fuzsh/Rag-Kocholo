        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nOne of the highpoints of Mark Twain’s European tour of 1892 was a large formal banquet at the University of Berlin given in honor of two of the nineteenth century’s scientific giants, Rudolph Virchow, one of the founders of modern biology, and Hermann von Helmholtz, perhaps Europe’s greatest scientific mind since Newton. Mark Twain was an honored guest, seated at the head table with some twenty particularly eminent professors; and it was from this vantage point that he witnessed the following incident:\n\nWhen apparently the last eminent guest had long ago taken his place, again those three bugle blasts rang out and once more the swords leaped from their scabbards. Who might this late comer be? Nobody was interested to inquire. Still, indolent eyes were turned toward the distant entrance; we saw the silken gleam and the lifted swords of a guard of honor plowing through the remote crowds. Then we saw that end of the house rising to its feet; saw it rise abreast the advancing guard all along, like a wave. This supreme honor had been offered to no one before. Then there was an excited whisper at our table—MOMMSEN! and the whole house rose. Rose and shouted and stamped and clapped, and banged the beer mugs. Just simply a storm! Then the little man with his long hair and Emersonian face edged his way past us and took his seat. I could have touched him with my hand—Mommsen!—think of it! . . . I would have walked a great many miles to get a sight of him, and here he was, without trouble or tramp or cost of any kind. Here he was clothed in a Titanic deceptive modesty which made him look like other men. Here he was, carrying the Roman world and all the Caesars in his hospitable skull, and doing it as easily as that other luminous vault, the skull of the universe, carries the Milky Way and the constellations.\n\nIt is doubtful whether any other European intellectual figure of that day could have been thus honored in the presence of such men as Virchow and Helmholtz, and certainly none could have deserved the honor more than Mommsen. For Theodor Mommsen (1817-1903) was the greatest classical historian of his century or of ours. His only rival in any century was Edward Gibbon, whose monumental History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire complements rather than competes with Mommsen’s superb description of the Roman republic. Mommsen had, moreover, the advantage over Gibbon in the extent and validity of the basic historical data (such as the vast collection of Roman inscriptions, which Mommsen himself later edited) at his disposal, and in the advance of the scientific and critical method in historiography, to which Mommsen made fundamental contributions.\n\nThe finest fruit of this toil was Mommsen’s History of Rome, published in some 2,000 pages in 1854-56, which is of greater scholarly value today than Gibbon’s Decline and Fall, yet yields little to Gibbon in its power of direct and forceful expression. Not until he was 86, the year before his death, did Mommsen receive the Nobel Prize for Literature; yet the honor merely set an official stamp on the judgment made decades earlier by the world of letters. The terse tribute of the Encyclopædia Britannica is unequivocal: Equally great as antiquary, jurist, political and social historian, Mommsen lived to see the time when among students of Roman history he had pupils, followers, critics, but no rivals. He combined the power of minute investigation with a singular faculty for bold generalization and the capacity for tracing out the effects of thought on political and social life.\n\nSuch a tribute, especially from a source so unsparingly critical as the Britannica, automatically raises the question, Why is Mommsen’s name and work so little known in the English-speaking world today? That question will be explored more fully later in this introduction. For the moment, however, suffice it to say that the editors of this volume are convinced that it is due to an unhappy set of extraneous circumstances; and in support of that conviction we have spent a great many hours in the preparation of this work.\n\nThe Man\n\nTheodor Mommsen was born in Garding, Schleswig-Holstein, on November 30, 1817—within a year, incidentally, of the birth of two other towering nineteenth century figures, Karl Marx and Otto von Bismarck. Mommsen, the son of a Lutheran pastor, spent his childhood in a bookish atmosphere; but there are no surviving anecdotes of youthful precocity, and it was not until he was at the University of Kiel in 1838-1844 that his powers of research and organization, as well as his brilliant literary style, began to develop conspicuously. At Kiel he first came in contact with men of outstanding intellect, among them J. G. Droysen, the famous historian of Greece and of Alexander the Great.\n\nAt Kiel Mommsen threw himself into the study of jurisprudence (which in Germany meant the study of Roman law), and his later legal and historical masterpiece, the Römisches Staatsrecht (Roman Constitutional Law) was the ripe harvest of a lifetime of study. He also found himself in the thick of student political agitation, in which questions of liberalism and democracy, nationalism and separatism, the future of Germany and the future of Europe, were passionately discussed.\n\nHowever, before the revolutionary wave of 1848 swept the youth of Germany into intense political activity, Mommsen received a research stipend which he used for an extended trip through Italy. There he began the serious collection and study of ancient inscriptions. Previous extensive collections had been made, and Otto Jahn, one of Mommsen’s professors at Kiel, was a leading authority on the subject. But there had been no massive systematic effort to collect, reproduce, edit, and publish them all. This truly gigantic task, requiring the co-ordination of many scholars, became one of Mommsen’s major activities in later life; and the monumental Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (Collection of Latin Inscriptions), which today occupies six feet of folio-size shelf space in every leading historical library, is the enduring result.\n\nMommsen’s Italian years were thus crucial to his intellectual development. His knowledge of Rome broadened and deepened, and personal contact with the massive remains of the ancient world was stimulating in the highest degree. One recalls the famous passage from Gibbon’s autobiography: It was at Rome, on the 15th of October, 1764, as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol, while the barefooted friars were singing vespers in the Temple of Jupiter, that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city first started to my mind. Mommsen has left us no autobiography, and his inner intellectual life is perhaps less known than that of any other comparable figure in his century. Yet it is surely reasonable to assume that the sight of the ruins of the Capitol raised emotions in him similar to Gibbon’s.\n\nReturning to Kiel in 1847, Mommsen found, like many another young genius, that the world was not yet ready to reward the high reputation he enjoyed in special circles. He went back to an obscure teaching position in a girls’ private school in Altona, in the province of Schleswig-Holstein. That province was a focal point of the revolution of 1848. Though nominally Danish, the overwhelming majority of the population were German by language and sympathy, and the province was held under Danish rule by the most tenuous of threads. In the excitement of the day a provisional government was established, declaring independence from Denmark with the ultimate objective of joining the German confederation.\n\nOne of the provisional government’s leaders was Theodor Olshausen, a friend from Mommsen’s student days at Kiel, who recognized his potential as a publicist and sharp political thinker. He persuaded Mommsen to take the editorship of the newspaper Schleswig-Holsteinische Zeitung, which appeared from April through July of 1848. Although the revolution failed, and Schleswig-Holstein remained under Danish control until 1866, these busy months brought Mommsen into the closest contact with practical politicians, and showed him the real world of politics in a way that he could never have learned from books.\n\nBut Mommsen was not born to be a journalist. His friend and teacher Otto Jahn recommended him to the Ministry of Culture in Saxony, and he began his life as a German scholar with an appointment as a special Professor of Law at the University of Leipzig. True, his early university life was not wholly placid: in 1851, after two years of teaching and study at Leipzig, he was dismissed in disgrace along with his sponsor Otto Jahn and another well-known scholar, Moritz Haupt. It was a flick of the tail of reaction. With the collapse of the 1848 revolution came the revenge of the outraged government, and Mommsen lost his job as one who had associated with the wrong people—in short, as a security risk. But there were other and less benighted universities in Europe, and the dismissal from Leipzig was quickly followed by an invitation from the University of Zurich, where Mommsen went in 1852.\n\nThe History of Rome\n\nDespite its unhappy ending, the Leipzig period was the seed-time of the great work on which Mommsen’s world reputation was founded—the History of Rome.1 The Leipzig publisher Karl Reimer had met the young professor, heard some of his lectures, and had become convinced that he was the man to write a popular though soundly scholarly history of Rome, to rival Ernst Curtius’ History of Greece then in preparation. He approached Mommsen with a contract, and the man and the opportunity fused.\n\nOne after another, in 1854, 1855, and 1856, the first three volumes appeared. Their success was immediate and increasing. Never before in Germany, and rarely in any country, had a professional scholar written with such vigor and life, such grasp of detail combined with a wide vision, such self-confident mastery of a vast field of learning. The work was literally epoch-making in two major aspects. It astonished and shocked professional scholars by its revolutionary treatment of the misty beginnings of Rome, sweeping away the old legends of the kings and heroes and along with them the elaborate critical structure deduced from those tales by Barthold Niebuhr, whose reputation as the grand master of Roman history was then sacrosanct. It replaced the critical work of Niebuhr with a far more penetrating criticism and a profounder body of inference.\n\nBut beyond the circles of specialists, a second feature of the work was still more arresting. In the third volume, as Mommsen reached the final period of the republic, with its rich and varied mass of source material, he wrote with a fire of imagination and emotion almost unknown in a professional history. Here was scientific learning with the stylistic vigor of a novel by Scott or Hugo, giving the lie to countless jokes about the pedantic dullness of German professors. In the same decade Macaulay in England was turning out the similarly lively volumes of his History of England, which outsold the novels of Dickens. But Macaulay’s work, though like Mommsen’s based on an enormous learning and written in an equally brilliant style, has not stood the hard judgment of time, and is no longer widely read. Mommsen’s History of Rome can never be superseded in this sense. His philosophical sweep, his depth of penetration, his solidity of judgment will continue to make his work a permanent classic regardless of the rise of new interpretations, new schools of thought, new historical discoveries.\n\nThis quality of permanence in Mommsen’s work is one that he shares with no more than one or two historians of modern times. By its very nature a history becomes outdated. The patient labor of thousands of scholars continually re-examines old points of view and finds new or neglected evidence. Every age must rewrite the history of its past, as new political, social, and economic theories constantly evolve. No historical work can stand forever as the definitive treatment of its field. But there are a few—a very few—infused with a vision that later students will ever find fruitful and stimulating, however they may disagree with details and with points of view. Such a work is Gibbon’s Decline and Fall, and no other history of the past two hundred years except Mommsen’s is solidly in this class. One possible contender might be Macaulay’s History of England, and another is surely Michelet’s History of France. But no other product of the classic age of great historians, the nineteenth century, is even in the running. Carlyle’s History of the French Revolution will long be read as literature, but it cannot seriously be called a history.\n\nThose who read this book will discover Mommsen’s style for themselves, but a few words are in order about his viewpoint and personal participation in his history. Mommsen’s attitude is not that of the cold judge above the battle. His emotions are powerfully engaged; indeed, it is precisely this engagement that makes his history so vivid and exciting. In the last convulsive struggle of the late Roman republic, out of which the republic perished and the empire arose, Mommsen sees the figure of Julius Caesar as the heroic agent of destiny. The republic, having become degenerate and oppressive for the vast mass of the Mediterranean peoples, could not be reformed and did not deserve to be saved. Hence, its destroyer, Caesar, the instrument of historical necessity, is for Mommsen the entire and perfect man—though this does not for a moment prevent Mommsen from recognizing and chronicling Caesar the rake, Caesar the conspirator, and Caesar the groundbreaker for later centuries of absolutism. Caesar’s opponents—in particular his three most famous opponents, Pompey, Cicero, and Cato—seem to Mommsen foolish, petty-minded, and sterile. His contempt of Cicero in particular refuses to let him recognize even Cicero’s literary genius.\n\nBut despite these strong personal feelings, Mommsen is never deliberately guilty of suppressing evidence. His scholarly conscience is ever stronger than his loves and hates, and thus there is no genuine misleading of the reader. Mommsen’s opinions and judgments are there for all to see; but being sharply differentiated from the facts he presents, they do not undermine the reader’s ability to make independent judgments.\n\nIn only one important aspect of the last century of the republic, at least in the opinion of most twentieth century scholars, did Mommsen fall into serious error. This is in his description of the Roman party system. Mommsen frequently speaks of the democratic party and the oligarchic party as if there existed in Rome of 100-50 B.C. organized political movements with clearly recognized programs and organizations. In Mommsen’s account the democratic movement began with the brothers Gracchi, became more and more ideologically organized, and finally found a leader in Caesar. After striving with little success to promote the democratic program by political agitation, Caesar finally turned toward military force. Securing the major command in Gaul in 58 B.C., he single-mindedly pursued the objective of democratic reform, now with military backing.\n\nThe historical research of the past 50 years has greatly weakened this picture of a two-party system vaguely resembling the right and left of modern European politics. There was no such clear political division in the late Roman republic. A hard core of senatorial families, legitimately called the aristocrats or the oligarchy, practically monopolized by family position, wealth, and marriage alliances the chief offices of the state. These men may be said to have formed a party in the sense that they had at least a common outlook—stubborn conservatism. They contended among themselves for personal position and honors, forming cliques and intrigues in what amounted to a private game. Their one unifying principle was no innovations, no change. Their greed and misrule often aroused sporadic and sometimes massive and desperate opposition. But the opposition was never organized into a party with the unity and purposiveness implied by Mommsen’s terms the democracy and the democratic leaders. From time to time more or less able demagogues made use of popular discontent to promote their private ambitions; and of these demagogues Caesar was, of course, the ablest and greatest. But there was no clear political tradition running from the Gracchi through Marius to Caesar, as there is a political tradition running from Thomas Jefferson through Andrew Jackson to Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nThe Roman opposition to the senatorial oligarchy, or optimates, came from dissatisfied and ambitious men of senatorial rank and families, whose tactics were not based on a democratic or even a popular ideology. Contemporary sources speak of certain politicians as populares, and in the older histories—as in Mommsen—this term is interpreted as meaning popular leaders. A closer analysis of this expression in context shows that these men were merely aristocrats pursuing personal ends, and the only thing popular about them was the method which they used to promote themselves. They sought by agitation among the lower classes to bring pressure on the Senate, but not with the aim of a general programatic reform.\n\nThe later years\n\nWith the publication of the third volume of the History of Rome in 1856, Mommsen’s fame became international. He moved from Zurich to Breslau in 1854, and in 1858 settled in Berlin as a member of the Prussian Academy of Science, carrying with him in his mind the plan for the editing and publication of the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, which was to be supported by the Academy. The first volume appeared in 1863. Meanwhile Mommsen had joined the faculty of the University of Berlin. Until the close of his long life in 1903 he made Berlin his home, turning out an astounding series of books and special monographs, and growing into the legendary learned professor whom Mark Twain met in the last decade of the century.\n\nYet his life was hardly that of the buried recluse. His house in Charlottenburg must have been at least lively, since there were sixteen Mommsen children. A story still firmly believed in Germany today is that he met an urchin on one of his walks and, after a short conversation, inquired, And what is your name? Helmut Mommsen, came the reply.\n\nThe three volumes of the History of Rome covered the period to the end of the great civil war and the establishment of the new monarchy of Caesar. The original plan had envisaged an additional volume on the history of the emperors, perhaps down to Justinian and certainly as far as Diocletian. But it was never written. Instead, in 1886 a fifth volume appeared, entitled The Provinces of the Roman Empire, leaving the definite public impression that the missing fourth volume would yet be published. A much discussed mystery of Mommsen’s career is why it never was, and no very convincing explanation has ever been given. The curious reader may find various suggestions in Professor Gilbert Highet’s recent book The Classical Tradition, and in the first volume of Mr. Toynbee’s famous Study of History.\n\nAfter the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and the unification of Germany under Bismarck, Mommsen’s voice was often raised on contemporary political questions, about which he grew increasingly liberal as he grew older. In 1881 he was elected to the Reichstag, where he joined the so-called Radical Party in sharp conflict with Bismarck. (He denounced Bismarck’s policy of a protective tariff as a swindle.) In a personal altercation in the Reichstag Bismarck declared, I can only assume that the profound studies this learned man has made in the time that lies two thousand years behind us have entirely blinded his eyes to the sunlight of the present day. Later Bismarck even brought Mommsen to trial for libeling the government, but the historian was triumphantly acquitted.\n\nIn educational matters, where he spoke with great authority, his influence was consistently on the side of freedom, humanity, and scholarly integrity. He denounced antisemitism with savage vigor. At 84, at the very end of his life, he wrote a fiery essay on university instruction and religion in which he declared that the lifeblood of a university was the untrammeled search for truth, die voraussetzungslose Forschung. The selection of university teachers on religious grounds, he felt, was an axe laid at the root of the tree—the tree of integrity on which depend our self-respect, our social honor, and our influence upon youth.\n\nIn the 1880’s and 1890’s the honor and deference paid to him were perhaps unique in the world; but there are many signs that he was troubled with the emerging Germany, and that he foresaw in some dim sense the tragedy of the following century. When in 1902 he received the Nobel Prize and the wave of applause began, he held his hand up for silence and, gazing at his audience with his piercing eyes, remarked, No applause, my friends—the times are too grave.\n\nAccording to his will his private papers, which would have enabled a satisfactory biography to be written, were impounded for thirty years. Then, when the ban on publication was lifted in 1933, the environment of Hitler’s Germany was such that no attempt was then made to use the documents, and the bulk of them were destroyed in the Berlin bombings of 1944. They had, however, been examined and partly copied by Professor Lothar Wickert, who is now preparing a full-length biography.\n\nOne suggestive and interesting document, first published in 1948, was the note accompanying his will that provided for the disposition of his papers, and enjoined his family to prevent as far as possible the publication of a biography. After thirty years, if anyone were still interested, a biography might be written. But the most moving sentences of the document were these:\n\nIn spite of the outward signs of success, I have not achieved in my life what I ought. Accidental circumstances have placed my name among historians and philologists, although my education and probably also my talents were not sufficient for these studies; and a painful realization of inadequacy in what I have done, that I have seemed more than I was, has been my constant companion through life, and ought neither to be concealed nor displayed in a biography. I have never had and never wished political position and influence; but in my inmost being, that is, with the best that was in me, I have always been ‘a political animal,’ and have wished to be a good citizen. That is not possible in our nation.\n\nThe plan of this work\n\nTo tell how this volume was constructed is also to tell why it was attempted. As editors and classical enthusiasts, we felt that the single overwhelming work on the Roman republic deserved the attention and respect that it had received in Mark Twain’s time, rather than the blank looks with which at least 99 out of every 100 American college graduates today would greet the very name of Theodor Mommsen. His work was obviously passing into limbo when the last available English edition, the four-volume Everyman Library set, went out of print in the mid-1950’s. Even the recent reprinting in the United States did not seem to us sufficient to overcome the obstacles which have hindered Mommsen’s work from receiving at least the same kind of popular appreciation as Gibbon’s Decline and Fall.\n\nThe first of those obstacles is now history, but worth noting for that very reason. For all of Mommsen’s enormous vogue in Germany and on the continent, we do not doubt that he was less popular among literate Englishmen merely because England already had (in Gibbon) a certified Grade A genius among classical historians—and this despite the overwhelming likelihood that at this very moment Gibbon and Mommsen are delightedly comparing footnotes in a quiet corner of the Elysian Fields. This instinctive British attitude toward the redoubtable German was not mollified by Mommsen’s sharp criticism of England during the Boer War, although he was far more temperate than many a leading Englishman.\n\nWe freely admit that the preceding paragraph is speculative, but some of the other obstacles to an appreciation of Mommsen are unquestionably real. Any work of 2,000-odd pages tends at most to be admired and respected today rather than read. Much of the early part of the History of Rome is rendered dubious by the inadequacy of the historical materials—although, despite new archeological data subsequently unearthed, only the boldest authorities dare to disagree with Mommsen’s general approach to the city’s early history. Nevertheless, since all Roman history prior to 250 B.C. is a debating ground for scholars, we felt that we could safely eliminate almost the first third of the History of Rome from a one-volume work intended for nonspecialists.\n\nFurther, goaded by the necessity for maximum compression, we decided regretfully to eliminate the very important, exciting, and well-documented 100 years from 250 to 150 B.C., a period which saw Rome’s victory over Carthage in the Punic wars and the establishment of Roman supremacy over much of the Hellenic world. This we have done partly because we had to, but also because we felt that the period from 150 to 45 B.C., from Tiberius Gracchus to Julius Caesar, witnessed the final overwhelming tragedy of the republic and was therefore the period of keenest interest to the modern reader. If anyone doubts the pertinence of this period to our own time, we urge that he reflect upon the unnerving similarities between the political strategy and tactics of Gaius Gracchus and those of Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nWe concluded very early in the work that still further eliminations could be made, notably Mommsen’s occasional chapters dealing with art, religion, and culture, which do not always sustain the excellence of the political and military history. We also found it both desirable and possible to eliminate several chapters dealing largely or wholly with military campaigns in Gaul and in the East, substituting for them brief italicized bridge passages to tell in capsule form what happened and what effect it had upon the political deterioration of Rome itself, which is the central subject. And finally, even within the chapters which are included we have found it possible to delete occasional sections which seem to us superfluous elaboration of an adequately clear general statement. Each omission in this last-named category is marked by a footnote; the other footnotes comprise mainly brief definitions of Roman words and phrases which may be unfamiliar to the general reader, and which are more fully defined in the Glossary. The only omissions not marked by footnotes (and we warn any literary detectives among our readers that they are extremely rare throughout this volume) are sentences or phrases deleted because they contain classical or nineteenth century references which might be obscure to the modern reader, but where a footnote marking the deleted passage would have required more space than was saved by the omission.\n\nBy these multiple surgeries we have reduced by more than half a chunk of Mommsen which runs nearly 1,000 close-packed pages in the Everyman edition; and yet we feel that the reorganized remainder has complete unity and cohesiveness. In fact, at one point along the way we seriously considered including a few noteworthy sections from other parts of the History of Rome, such as Mommsen’s gripping description of Hannibal’s march across the Alps. But in its final form the present volume seemed to have such internal coherence that we could not bring ourselves to clutter it with extraneous addenda.\n\nSelecting what to include, however, was a trifling matter compared to the editing job on what remained. The History of Rome was, for its day, well translated by Dr. William P. Dickson, a divinity professor at the University of Glasgow. A continental writer once remarked that translations are like women—they can be either beautiful or faithful; and Dickson was as fundamentally on the side of morality as might be expected of a Scottish divine. Moreover, Mommsen, who of course knew English among his other languages both ancient and modern, was a hard man with his translators no less than with his publishers. For this reason Dickson was perhaps even more faithful as a translator than he might have wished to be, and at best his colloquialisms are still those of mid-nineteenth century Britain. At times Mommsen in an excess of zeal would insist on an ill-chosen English equivalent, such as the word burgess for citizen, or client state for satellite state or protectorate. Mommsen also followed the then prevailing scholarly practice of giving each event two dates, one according to the Christian era and one according to the legendary founding of the city of Rome in 753 B.C. Thus the battle of Zama in 202 B.C. would be dated 552/202.\n\nWhether through Mommsen’s pressure or his own scholarly preferences, Dickson followed Mommsen’s paragraphing exactly; and Mommsen’s paragraphs are often a hundred lines long. Dickson also on occasion (though not invariably) followed the Germanic sentence structure, which a wag once described as the sentence diving into the river and coming up on the other bank with the verb in its mouth; and the fact that he did so only spasmodically gives the Dickson translation a curiously uneven quality, with easy colloquialisms, old-fashioned Victorianisms, and weirdly constructed sentences incongruously intertwined.\n\nThe only remedy here, it seemed to us, was complete re-editing and revision of the translation. Therefore we went word by word and line by line over every portion that was to be included; modernized the punctuation; changed from British to American spelling; cut interminable sentences into two or more shorter ones; rearranged sentence structure; substituted modern for archaic phrasing; and made two or more brief paragraphs out of each long one. Any such drastic reworking always raises the question whether the final result may be not only unfaithful to the original, but downright wanton. We have sought to guard against this by checking some hundreds of pages of our revised English version against the original German text. At long last, however, we became convinced that Dickson had at least been supremely accurate; thereafter we contented ourselves with editing from the Dickson translation, checking back to the original German only in the case of obscurities or where we suspected that Dickson might have merely grazed the point.\n\nThis is not to involve Dickson, let alone Mommsen, for any mistakes or shortcomings in the present volume. In large matters or small, in conception or in detail, any blame is ours alone. But we shall regard the risk as having been well taken if this volume serves to introduce a wider group of English-speaking readers to one of the noblest historians and intellects that ever walked upon the face of the earth.\n\nDero A. Saunders\n\nJohn H. Collins\n\nApril, 1958\n\n1. Originally published in German as the Römische Geschichte—literally, Roman History.\n\nI\n\nTHE REFORM MOVEMENT AND TIBERIUS GRACCHUS\n\nFor a whole generation after the battle of Pydna 1 the Roman state enjoyed a profound calm, scarcely troubled by a ripple here and there on the surface. Its dominion extended over three continents; the luster of the Roman power and the glory of the Roman name were constantly on the increase; all eyes rested on Italy, all talents and all riches flowed thither. It seemed as if a golden age of peaceful prosperity and intellectual fruitfulness must surely soon begin. The Orientals told each other with astonishment of the mighty republic of the West, which subdued kingdoms far and near, so that everyone who heard its name trembled; but which kept good faith with its friends and dependents. Such was the glory of the Romans, and yet no one usurped the crown and no one glittered in purple dress; but they obeyed whomsoever from year to year they made their master, and there was among them neither envy nor discord.\n\nSo it seemed at a distance; matters looked differently at closer view. The government of the aristocracy was well on the way to destroying its own work. It was not that the sons and grandsons of the vanquished at Cannae and the victors of Zama 2 had utterly degenerated from their fathers and grandfathers; the difference was not so much in the men who sat in the Senate as it was in the times. Where a few old families of established wealth and hereditary political importance conduct the government, they will display in seasons of danger an incomparable tenacity of purpose and heroic self-sacrifice—just as in seasons of tranquility they will be short-sighted, selfish, and negligent: the germs of both traits are inherent in their hereditary character. The aristocratic rottenness had long existed, but the sun of prosperity was needed to ripen it. There was profound meaning in Cato’s 3 question, What will become of Rome when she no longer has any state to fear?\n\nThat point had now been reached. Every neighbor whom she might have feared was politically annihilated; and of the men who had been reared under the old order of things in the severe school of the Hannibalic wars, and whose words still echoed that mighty epoch so long as they survived, death called one after another away until at length the voice of the last of them, the veteran Cato, ceased to be heard in the Senate and the Forum. A younger generation came to the helm, and their policy was a sorry answer to the question of that veteran patriot.\n\nIn internal affairs the Romans were, if possible, still more disposed than in foreign affairs to let the ship drift before the wind: if internal government means more than the mere transaction of current business, there was in this period no government in Rome at all. The single thought of the governing clique was the maintenance and, if possible, the increase of their usurped privileges. The state did not have the right to get the best man for its supreme magistracy; rather, every member of the clique had an inborn title to the highest office of the state—a title not to be threatened by the unfair rivalry of his peers or the encroachments of the excluded. Accordingly the clique set as its most important political aim the restriction of reelection to the consulship and the exclusion of new men. It succeeded, in fact, in obtaining the legal prohibition of the former about 151 B.C., and thenceforward contented itself with a government of aristocratic nobodies. Even the government’s inaction in external affairs was doubtless connected with this policy of the nobility, exclusive toward commoners and suspicious of individual members of their own order. There was no surer means to keep commoners, whose deeds might become their patent of nobility, out of the pure circles of the hereditary aristocracy than by allowing no one to perform any deeds at all. Even an aristocratic conqueror of Syria or Egypt would have embarrassed so mediocre a government.\n\nIt is true that there was no want of opposition, some of it even partly effective. The administration of justice was improved. The administrative jurisdiction which the Senate exercised either personally or by extraordinary commissions over provincial officials was confessedly inadequate; and the innovation proposed in 149 B.C. by Lucius Calpurnius Piso, for a standing commission to try the complaints of the provincials against the extortions of their Roman magistrates, had a momentous bearing on the whole public life of the Roman community. An effort was made to free the comitia 4 from the domination of the aristocracy. The panacea of Roman democracy was vote by ballot in the assemblies of citizens, introduced first for the election of magistrates by the Gabinian Law (139 B.C.), then for the public tribunals by the Cassian Law (137 B.C.), and lastly for voting on legislative proposals by the Papirian Law (131 B.C.). Soon afterwards the senators were also required by decree of the people to give up their command of mounted soldiers on admission to the Senate, and thereby to renounce their privilege of voting in the equestrian order.5 These measures, directed to the emancipation of the electorate from the ruling aristocracy, may perhaps have seemed to the party which suggested them the first steps toward regenerating the state. In reality, they made not the slightest change in the impotence of the legally supreme organ of the Roman community, the citizenry. That impotence, indeed, was only the more obvious to all, whether it concerned them or not. Equally ostentatious and equally empty was the formal recognition of the independence and sovereignty of the citizens by transferring their place of assembly from the old Comitium below the Capitol to the Forum (c. 145 B.C.).\n\nBut this hostility between the formal sovereignty of the people and the actually existing constitution was largely a sham. Party phrases were in free circulation, but of parties themselves there was little trace in important practical affairs. Throughout the republic’s last century the annual public election, especially to the consulship and censorship,6 was the real focus of political activity; but only in rare and isolated instances did the opposing candidates represent different political principles. Ordinarily the contests were purely between personalities, and it was a matter of practical indifference whether the majority of votes fell to a Caecilian or a Cornelian. The Romans thus lacked the great compensation for the evils of party politics—the spontaneous choice by the masses of the goals which they preferred—and yet endured all those evils solely for the benefit of the paltry game played by the ruling clique.\n\nIt was comparatively easy for the Roman noble to begin a political career as tribune of the people or as quaestor,7 but the consulship or the censorship was attainable only by great exertions prolonged over the years. The prizes were many, but those really worth having were few: the competitors ran, as a Roman poet once said, over a racecourse wide at the starting point but gradually narrowing toward the end. This was right so long as political office was (as it was called) an honor, and so long as men of military, political, or juristic ability competed for the ultimate prizes. But now the exclusiveness of the nobility did away with the benefits of competition, and left only its disadvantages. With few exceptions the young men of the ruling families crowded into the political arena, and their impetuous and premature ambition soon sought channels more effective than mere public service. The first prerequisite for a career came to be powerful connections. Therefore that career began not, as it once had, in the camp, but in the waiting-rooms of influential men. A new and genteel body of hangers-on began to do what had formerly been done only by dependents and freedmen, to come and wait on their patron early in the morning and appear publicly in his train.\n\nBut the populace was also a great lord, and desired its share of attention. The rabble began to demand as its right that the future consul should recognize and honor the sovereign people in every ragged idler of the street, and that every candidate should in his going round (ambitus) salute every individual voter by name and press his hand. The world of quality readily entered into this degrading canvass. The candidate cringed not only in the palace but also on the street, and recommended himself to the multitude by flattering attentions, indulgences, and civilities. A demagogic cry for reform was sedulously employed to attract public notice and favor, and was the more effective the more it attacked personalities. It became the custom for beardless youths of genteel birth to introduce themselves noisily into public life by replaying with boyish eloquence the part of Cato, proclaiming themselves state prosecutors against some man of high standing and great unpopularity. Thus the Romans permitted the courts and the police to become a means of soliciting office. The provision (or still worse, the promise) of magnificent popular amusements had long been the accepted route to the consulship, but now the votes of the electors began to be directly bought, as is shown by the prohibition issued about 159 B.C.\n\nPerhaps the worst consequence of this continual courting of popular favor by the ruling aristocracy was the incompatibility of such begging and fawning with the position which government should rightfully occupy in relation to the governed. The government was thus converted from a blessing to a curse for the people. It no longer ventured to dispose of the blood and treasure of the citizens, as exigency required, for the good of their country. It allowed the people to become habituated to the dangerous idea that they were legally exempt from direct taxes even as an advance: after the war with King Perseus of Macedonia ending in 168 B.C. no further advance was asked of the community. It allowed the military system to decay rather than compel the citizens to enter the hated overseas service; and hard was the fate of officials who attempted strict enforcement of the conscription laws.\n\nIn the Rome of this epoch, the twin evils of a degenerate aristocracy and an infant democracy already cankered in the bud were joined in a fatal marriage. According to their party names, which were first heard during this period, the Optimates wished to give effect to the will of the best, the Populares to that of the community; but in fact there was in Rome of that day neither a true aristocracy nor a truly self-governing community. Both parties contended alike for shadows, and numbered in their ranks none but zealots or hypocrites. Both were equally tainted by political corruption, both were equally worthless. Both were necessarily tied to the status quo, for neither had a single political idea (not to mention a political plan) reaching beyond the existing state of affairs. Accordingly, the two parties were in such entire agreement that their ends and means dovetailed at every step, and a change of party was a change of political tactics rather than of political sentiments. The commonwealth would doubtless have gained if the aristocracy had introduced a hereditary rotation, or if the democracy had produced from within itself a genuine popular government. But these Optimates and Populares of the Republic’s last century were far too indispensable to each other to wage internecine war; they not only could not destroy each other, but would not have done so if they could. Meanwhile the commonwealth, politically and morally more and more unhinged, was verging toward utter disorganization.\n\nThe crisis that sparked the Roman revolution arose not out of this petty political conflict, but out of the economic and social relations which the Roman government allowed, like everything else, simply to take their course. Thus the social infection, which had long been developing, was allowed to come to a head with fearful rapidity and violence. From a very early period the Roman economy was based on two factors, always interdependent and always at odds—the husbandry of the small farmer and the money of the capitalist. The latter, hand in glove with the great landholders, had for centuries waged a war against the small farmer, a war which seemed destined to end by destroying first the farmer class and then the commonwealth. But the struggle was broken off indecisively by the extensive distribution of new lands accruing to the state from successful wars.\n\nIn that same age, which renewed the distinction between patricians and plebeians under altered names, the disproportionate accumulation of capital was preparing a second assault on the farming system. It is true that the method was different. Formerly the small farmer had been ruined by loans of money, which practically reduced him to a mere steward of his creditor; now he was crushed by the competition of overseas, especially slave-grown, grain. The capitalists kept pace with the times. While waging war against labor and against personal liberty, as they had always done to the extent permitted by law, they waged it no longer in the unseemly fashion that converted the free man into a slave through his debts, but on the contrary with slaves regularly bought and paid for; the former usurer of capital appeared in contemporary guise as the owner of commercial plantations. But in both cases the ultimate result was the same: the undermining of the Italian farms; the supplanting of small farming first in part of the provinces and then in Italy by the farming of large estates; the concentration of these large Italian farms upon cattle, oil, and wine; and finally, the replacing of free laborers both in the provinces and in Italy by slaves. Just as the new nobility was more dangerous than the old patricians, because the former could not be set aside by changing the constitution, so the new power of capital was less controllable than that of previous centuries because nothing could be done to oppose it by changing the law of the land.\n\nBefore we attempt to describe this second great conflict between labor and captial, it is necessary to give some account of the nature and extent of the slave system. We do not now refer to the old, and in some measure innocent, rural slavery, under which the farmer tilled the field along with his slave, or, if he possessed more land than he could manage, placed the slave either as a steward or as a sort of share-tenant over a detached farm. Such relationships no doubt persisted (around Comum, for instance, they were still the rule in the time of the Empire), but only as exceptions in privileged districts and on humanely managed estates. What we now refer to is the system of slavery on a grand scale, which in the Roman state as formerly in the Carthaginian grew out of the ascendancy of capital. While the captives taken in war and the hereditary transmission of slavery sufficed to keep up the stock of slaves during the earlier period, this new system of slavery was, like that of America, based on the methodically prosecuted hunting of man. For owing to the manner in which slaves were used, with little regard to their life or propagation, the slave population was constantly on the wane, and even the wars that continually furnished fresh masses to the slave markets could not cover the deficit.\n\nNo country where this species of game could be hunted remained unmolested; even in Italy it was by no means unheard of for the poor free man to be placed by his employer among the slaves. But the Negro-land of that age was western Asia, where the Cretan and Cilician corsairs, the real professional slave hunters and slave dealers, robbed the coasts of Syria and the Greek islands, and where the Roman taxgatherers emulated their feats by instituting manhunts in the satellite states and enslaving those whom they captured. This was done to such an extent that about 100 B.C. the king of Bithynia declared himself unable to furnish the required contingent of auxiliaries to the Roman army, because all his people capable of labor had been dragged off by the taxgatherers. At the great market in Delos, where the slave dealers of Asia Minor sold their wares to Italian speculators, as many as 10,000 slaves are said to have been disembarked in one morning and to have been sold before evening—a proof of how enormous was the number of slaves, and of how the demand still exceeded the supply.\n\nIt was no wonder. The Roman economy of the second century B.C. was based, like all the large-scale economies of antiquity, on the employment of slaves. In whatever direction speculation applied itself, its instrument was invariably man reduced by law to the status of a beast of burden. Trade was in great part carried on by slaves, the proceeds belonging to the master. Tax-gathering in the lower departments was regularly conducted by the slaves of the associations that leased them. Servile hands performed the operations of mining, of making pitch, and others of a similar kind. It early became the custom to send herds of slaves to the Spanish mines, whose superintendents readily paid a high rent for them. The vine and olive harvest of Italy was not conducted by the people on the estate, but was contracted for by a slave operator. The armed, and frequently mounted, slave herdsmen who roamed the great pastoral districts of Italy were soon transplanted to those provinces which were favored by Roman speculation—Dalmatia, for example, had hardly been acquired (155 B.C.) before Roman capitalists introduced there the rearing of cattle on a great scale after the Italian fashion.\n\nFar worse in every respect was the plantation system proper, the cultivation of the fields by a band of slaves sometimes branded with iron, who with shackles on their legs labored in the fields under overseers during the day, and were locked up together at night in their common and often underground prison. This plantation system had migrated from the East to Carthage, and seems to have been brought by the Carthaginians to Sicily, where it appears to have developed earlier and more fully than in any other part of the Roman dominions. The Sicilian territory of Leontini, for example, where about 30,000 acres of arable land were let out by the censors as Roman domain, was divided some decades after the time of the Gracchi among not more than 84 lessees, making an average of 360 acres per lessee; and among these only one was a Leontine, the rest being foreign, mostly Roman, speculators. We see from this instance with what zeal the Roman capitalists walked in the footsteps of their predecessors, and what extensive dealings in Sicilian cattle and Sicilian slave-grown grain must have been carried on by the Roman and non-Roman operators who covered that beautiful island with their pastures and plantations.\n\nItaly, however, still remained substantially exempt from this worst form of slave-husbandry—although in Etruria, where the plantation system seems first to have emerged on the mainland, and where at any rate it was most extensive forty years afterwards, it is quite probable that plantations already existed. Yet Italian agriculture in this age was still carried on chiefly by free laborers or at least by unchained slaves, while larger undertakings were frequently let out to contractors. The difference between Italian and Sicilian slavery is clearly apparent from the fact that the slaves of the Mamertine community, which lived after the Italian fashion, were the only slaves who did not take part in the Sicilian servile revolt of 135-132 B.C.\n\nThe abyss of misery and woe which engulfed this most miserable of all proletariats we leave to be fathomed by those who can bear to gaze into such depths. It is quite possible that, compared with the sufferings of the Roman slaves, the sum of all Negro suffering is but a drop. Here, however, we are less concerned with the hardships of the slaves themselves than with the perils which they brought upon the Roman state, and with the government’s policy in confronting them. It was plain that this proletariat was not created by the government and could not be directly set aside by it, for this would have entailed remedies still worse than the disease. The duty of the government was simply (1) to avert by a vigilant police the direct threat of the slave population to property and life, and (2) to aim at restricting the spread of slavery as far as possible by the support of free labor. Let us see how the Roman aristocracy executed these two tasks.\n\nThe slave conspiracies and wars breaking out everywhere illustrate their management as regards police. In Italy the scenes of disorder which had been among the painful accompaniments of the Hannibalic war were now renewed; in one year (133 B.C.) the Romans were obliged to seize and execute 150 slaves in the capital, 450 in Minturnae, and 4,000 in Sinuessa. Still worse, as might be expected, was the state of the provinces. At about the same period the revolting slaves at the great market at Delos and in the Attic silver mines had to be put down by force of arms. The war against Aristonicus and his Heliopolites in Asia Minor was in substance a war of landowners against the revolted slaves.\n\nBut worst of all, of course, was the condition of Sicily, the chosen land of the plantation system. Brigandage, long a standing evil there, especially in the interior, began to swell into insurrection. Damophilus, a wealthy planter of Enna who emulated the Italian lords in the exploitation of his living capital, was attacked and murdered by his exasperated rural slaves; then the savage band flocked into the town of Enna and repeated the process on a greater scale. The slaves rose in a body against their masters, killed or enslaved them, and summoned to the head of their now considerable insurgent army a juggler from Apamea in Syria who knew how to vomit fire and utter oracles. Formerly named Eunus when he was a slave, as king of the insurgents he was styled Antiochus, King of the Syrians. And why not? A few years earlier another Syrian slave, who was not even a prophet, had in Antioch itself worn the diadem of the Seleucids of Syria. The Greek slave Achaeus, the brave commander of the new king, traveled throughout the island; and not only did the wild herdsmen flock from far and near to the strange banner, but also the free laborers, who bore no goodwill to the planters, made common cause with the revolted slaves.\n\nIn another district of Sicily Cleon, a Cilician slave who had in his native land been a daring bandit, followed the example of Eunus by occupying Agrigentum. Then the leaders came to a mutual understanding, and, after gaining various minor advantages, at length succeeded in totally defeating the praetor Lucius Hypsaeus and his army (mostly Sicilian militia) and in capturing his camp. By this victory almost the whole island fell into the hands of the insurgents, whose numbers, by the most conservative estimates, are put at 70,000 men capable of bearing arms. The Romans found themselves compelled for three successive years (134-132 B.C.) to send consuls and consular armies to Sicily, until, after several indecisive and even unfavorable conflicts, the revolt was finally subdued by the capture of Tauromenium and Enna. The most resolute insurgents threw themselves into the latter town with the determination of men who despair of deliverance or pardon. The consuls Lucius Calpurnius Piso and Publius Rupilius lay before it for two years, and finally reduced it more by famine than by arms.\n\nSuch was the quality of the policing by the Roman Senate and its officials in Italy and in the provinces. While the task of getting rid of such a proletariat all too often transcends the power and wisdom of a government, its police repression is comparatively easy for any large commonwealth. It would be well with states if the unpropertied masses threatened them with no greater danger than from bears and wolves; only the timid, and those who trade upon the silly fears of the multitude, prophesy the destruction of civil order through slave revolts or proletarian insurrections. But even this easier task of restraining the oppressed masses was beyond the capacities of the Roman government, despite the general peace and the inexhaustible resources of the state.\n\nThis was a sign of its weakness, but not of its weakness alone. By law the Roman governor was bound to keep the roads clear and to have the robbers who were caught crucified, if they were slaves, for slavery is not possible without a reign of terror. In this period in Sicily a roundup was doubtless initiated by the governor, when the roads became too insecure. But in order not to disoblige the Italian planters, the captured robbers were ordinarily handed over by the authorities to be punished at their masters’ discretion; and those masters were frugal people who, if their slave herdsmen asked for clothes, replied with lashes and with the inquiry whether travelers journeyed through the land naked. The result of such connivance was that on the subjugation of the Sicilian slave revolt the consul Publius Rupilius ordered all those who came into his hands alive—upwards of 20,000 men, it is said—to be crucified. It was no longer possible to spare capital.\n\nThe efforts of the government in supporting free labor, and thereby restricting the slave proletariat, promised fruits far more difficult to harvest but also far richer. Unfortunately, in this respect nothing was done at all. In the"
