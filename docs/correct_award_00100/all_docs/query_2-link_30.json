William P. Dickson, 1862-75) / History of Rome: An Account of Events and Persons from the Conquest of Carthage to the End of the Republic\n\n(tr. Dero A. Saunders and John C. Collins, 1958)\n\nAlthough Leo Tolstoy’s name was mentioned among the most prominent candidates for the prize, the Nobel committee couldn’t accept his radical views, and Mommsen was the one awarded. Tolstoy died in 1910 without receiving the most famous acknowledgment in literature.\n\nMommsen’s greatest interest was in Roman law, but he also participated in contemporary politics.\n\n“Bismarck has broken the nation’s backbone,” he wrote when Bismarck made Berlin the political capital. “The injury done by the Bismarck era is infinitely greater than its benefits… The subjugation of the German personality, of the German mind, was a misfortune that cannot be undone.”"
