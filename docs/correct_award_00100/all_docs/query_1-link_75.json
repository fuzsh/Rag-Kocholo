        "text": "Theodor Mommsen was a civil law Professor at Leipzig (1848), Zurich (1852) and Breslau (1854). In 1858, he was called to Berlin where he became the general editor of a monumental work entitled Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, which is the foundation of all epigraphic research. He wrote a great many works, most of which have survived the test of time: Roman History (1854-56), Roman Public Law (1871-88), Criminal Law (1899), etc. He was awarded the Nobel Prize of Literature in 1902."
