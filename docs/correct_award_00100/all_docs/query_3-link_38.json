T i i e o d o r M o m m s e n ' s researches into the languages, laws, and institutions of ancient Rome and Italy are now so well known and appreciated by the best scholars of this country, that it may seem presumptuous on my part to step forward for the purpose of introducing his work on Roman history to the English public. 1 should indeed have been glad to leave this duty to others, or have allowed the book to take its own chance, feeling quite sure that no words of mine are likely to attract readers, and that the work itself, in its English garb, will become as popular in this country as it is in the land of its birth. But several years ago I was applied to by more than one enthusiastic admirer of Dr. Mommsen in Germany to do something towards making his History of Rome known in this country, and a repeated perusal of the German original led me to the conviction that its author richly deserved the admiration of his countrymen. I accordingly felt it both a duty and a pleasure, some years back, to prevail upon my friend, Mr. George Robertson, to give to the public at least a specimen of the book, in an English translation of the first, or introductory chapters, on the early inhabitants of Italy —a subject on which no man is better entitled to be listened to with respect and attention than Dr. Mommsen. The specimen which was then published would, I hoped,\n\n8\n\nPreface to the First English\n\nEdition.\n\ncreate a desire for the -whole work, and in this hope I have not been disappointed. The result is the present translation ; of its merits it does not become me to speak in this place. But I may be permitted to remark that, unlike the common run of translations from the German, it was undertaken by M r . Dickson entirely as a labour of love, and that his sole object has been to lay before his countrymen a masterwork of a foreign literature, and to spare no trouble to do justice to its author. Here my functions might ccasc, and I might safely leave the book to tell its own tale ; but for the younger generation of students I would fain venture to add one or two observations on the relation in which Mommsen's work stands to its predecessors, and especially to Niebuhr, for he himself scarcely ever enters into any controversial discussions with those who have laboured before him in the same field, and whose names lie in fact hardly ever mentions. In regard to this point it ought to be borne in mind that D r . Mommsen's work, though the production of a man of most profound and extensive learning and knowledge of the wwld, is not so much designed for the professional scholar as for intelligent readers of all classes, who take an interest in the history of bygone ages, and are inclined there to seek information that may guide them safely through the perplexing mazes of modern history. Much that could not but be obscure and unintelligible in the days of Niebuhr has since been made clear by the more extended researches of numerous scholars in this and other countries; many mistakes unavoidable to the first inquirers have been rectified ; and many an hypothesis has been proved to be without solid foundation; but with all this the main results arrived at by the inquiries of Niebuhr, such as his views of the ancient population of Rome, the origin of the Plebs, thp\n\nPreface to the, First English Edition.\n\n9\n\nrelation between the patricians and plebeians, the real nature of the ager publicus, and many other points of interest, have been acknowledged by all his successors, and however much some of them may be inclined to cavil at particular opinions, it must be owned that the main pillars of his grand structure are still unshaken, and are as such tacitly acknowledged by D r . Mommsen, who in the present work has incorporated all that later researches have brought to light in the history not only of Rome, but of all other nations which in the course of time became subject to the City of the Seven Hills. Many points no doubt are still matters of mere conjecture, and Dr. Mommsen has nothing to offer in such cases but theories ; but whatever ultimately their value may be found to be, they are at all events evidences of progress, and will act as a stimulus to the students of our days as did the views of Niebuhr to his contemporaries half a century ago. L, ScnMitz. EDINBURGH, December,\n\n1*\n\n1861.\n\nPREFATORY NOTE BY THE TRANSLATOR, TO THE FIRST EDITION.\n\nIN requesting English scholars to receive with indulgence this first portion of a translation of D r . Mommsen's \" Romische Gesehichte,\" I am somewhat in the position of Albinus; who, when appealing to his readers to pardon the imperfections of the Roman History which he had written in indifferent Greek, was met by Cato with the rejoinder that he was not compelled to write at all—that, if the Amphictyonie Council had laid their commands on him, the case would have been different—but that it was quite out of place to ask the indulgence of his readers when his task had been self-imposed. I may state, however, that I did not undertake this task, until I had sought to ascertain whether it was likely to be taken up by any one more qualified to do justice to it. When Dr. Mommsen's work accidentally came into my hands some years after its first appearance, and revived my interest in studies which I had long laid aside for others more strictly professional, I had little doubt that its merits would have already attracted sufficient attention amidst the learned leisure of Oxford to induce some of her great scholars to clothe it in an English dress. But it appeared on inquiry that, while there was a great desire to see it translated, and the purpose of translating it had been entertained in more quarters than one, the projects had from various causes miscarried. Mr.\n\nPrefatory Note by the Translator.\n\n11\n\nGeorge Robertson published an excellent translation (to which, so far as it goes, I desire to acknowledge my obligations) of the introductory chapters on the early inhabitants of I t a l y ; but other studies and engagements did not permit him to procced with it. I accordingly requested and obtained Dr. Mommsen's permission to translate his work. The translation has been prepared from the third edition of the original, published in the spring of the present year at Berlin. The sheets have been transmitted to Dr. Mornmsen, who has kindly communicated to me such suggestions as occurred to him. I have thus been enabled, more especially in the first volume, to correct those passages 'where I had misapprehended or failed to express the author's meaning, and to incorporate in the English work various additions and corrections which do not appear in the original. The author has also furnished me with some interesting notes, such as that on the Servian census at page 95, that on the word vates at page 240, and that on Appius Claudius at page 292.*' W i t h reference to the latter I have inserted in an appendix D r . Mommsen's more matured views as embodied by him in a paper on the Patrician Claudii recently read before the Prussian Academy. The note at page 442,f on the treaties with Carthage, has been extracted from the author's work on Roman Chronology—a book which, in addition to its intrinsic merits, derives a peculiar interest from the fact, that it is written in friendly controversy with the author's own brother. In executing the translation I have endeavoured to fol* [The note on the Servian census has been preserved at p. 133, although not quite consistent with Dr. Mommsen's later view in vol. ii.p. ; that on the word vates at p, 305 has been considerably modified; and the view given in the note on Appius Claudius has now been embodied in the text.] f [No v given in Appendix I I . ]\n\n12\n\nPrefatory\n\nNote by the Translator.\n\nlow the original as closely as is consistent with a due regard to the difference of idiom. Many of our translations from the German are so literal as to reproduce the very order of the German sentence, so that they are, if not altogether unintelligible to the English reader, at least far from readable, while others deviate so entirely from the form of the original as to be no longer translations in the proper sense of the term. I have sought to pursue a middle course between a mere literal translation, which would be repulsive, and a loose paraphrase, which would be in the case of such a work peculiarly unsatisfactory. Those who are most conversant with the difficulties of such a task will probably be the most willing to show forbearance towards the shortcomings of my performance, and in particular towards the too numerous traces of the German idiom, which, on glancing over the sheets, I find it still to retain. The reader may perhaps be startled by the occurrence now and then of modes of expression more familiar and colloquial than is usually the case in historical works. This, however, is a characteristic feature of the original, to which in fact it owes not a little of its charm. Dr. Mommsen often uses expressions that are not to be found in the dictionary, and he freely takes advantage of the unlimited facilities afforded by the German language for the coinage or the combination of words. I have not unfrequently, in deference to his wishes, used such combinations as \" Carthagino-Sicilian,\" \" Romano-Hellenic,\" &c., although less congenial to our English idiom, for the sake of avoiding longer periphrases. In Dr. Mommsen's book, as in every other German work that has occasion to touch on abstract matters, there occur sentences couched in a peculiar terminology and not very susceptible of translation. There are one or two sen-\n\nPrefatory\n\n13\n\nNote by the Trmislator.\n\ntences of this sort, more especially in the chapter on Religion in the 1st volume, and in the critique of Euripides in the last chapter of the 2nd volume, as to which I am not very confident that I have seized or succeeded in expressing the meaning.\n\nIn these cases I have translated literally.\n\nIn the spelling of proper names I have generally adopted the Latin orthography as more familiar to scholars in this country, except in cases where the spelling adopted by D r . Mommsen is marked by any special peculiarity.\n\nAt\n\nthe same time entire uniformity in this respect has not been aimed at. I have ventured in various instances to break up the paragraphs of the original and to furnish them with additional marginal headings, and have carried out more fully the notation of the years B.C. on the margin. Two more volumes of still deeper interest bring down the history to the fall of the Republic.\n\nDr. Mommsen has\n\nexpressed his intention of resuming the work and narrating the History of the Empire.\n\nBut the execution of this plan\n\nhas been suspended owing to his other engagements.\n\nHe\n\nis at present occupied, under the auspices of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, in editing a great collection of Latin Inscriptions—a field of labour which he has made peculiarly his own. It is due to Dr. Schmitz, who has kindly encouraged me in this undertaking, that I should state that I alone am responsible for the execution of the translation.\n\nWhatever\n\nmay be thought of it in other respects, I venture to hope that it may convey to the English reader a tolerably accurate impression of the contents and general spirit of the book.

In calculating the corresponding years, the year 1 of the City has been assumed as identical with the year 753 B.C., and with Olymp. G, 4 ; although, if we take into account the circumstancc that the Roman solar year began with the 1st day of March, and the Greek with the 1st day of July, the year 1 of the City would according to more exact calculation correspond to the last ten months of 753 .and the first two months of 752 B.C., and to the last four months of 01. C, 3 and the first eight of 01. 6, 4. The Roman and Greek money has uniformly been commuted on the basis of assuming the libral as and sestertius, and the denarius and Attic drachma, respectively as equal, and taking for all sums above 100 denarii the present value in gold, and for all sums under 100 denarii the present value in silver, of the corresponding weight. The Roman pound ( = 327-45 grammes) of gold, equal to 4000 sesterces, has thus, according to the ratio of gold to silver 1 : 15\"5, been reckoned at 3 0 4 | Prussian thalers [about £ 4 3 ] , and the denarius, according to the value of silver, at 7 Prussian groschen [about 8 w i t h his neighbour, and with Greek char- the whole to which he belongs—admits of as\n\naster.\n\n,\n\n&\n\nmany solutions as there are provinces in our Father's kingdom; and it is in this, and not in the material sphere, that individuals and nations display their divergences of character.

The family and the state, religion and art, received in Italy and in Greece respectively a development so peculiar and so thoroughly national, that the common basis, on which in these respects also the two peoples rested, has been so overgrown as to bo almost concealed from our view. That Ilcllenic character, which sacrificed the whole to its individual elements, the nation to the township, and the township to the citizen; which sought its ideal of life in the beautiful and the good, and, but too often, in the enjoyment of idleness ; which attained its political development by intensifying the original individuality of the several cantons, and at length produced the internal dissolution of even local authority ; which in its view of religion first invested the gods with human attributes, and then denied their existence; which allowed full play to the limbs in the sports of the naked youth, and gave free scope to thought in all its grandeur and in all its awfulness;—and that Roman character, which solemnly bound the son to reverence the father, the citizen to reverence the ruler, and all to reverence the gods ; which required nothing and honoured nothing but the useful act, and compelled every citizen to fill up every moment of his brief life with unceasing work ; which made it a duty even in the boy modestly to cover the body ; which deemed every one a bad citizen who wished to be different from his fellows ; which regarded the state as all in all, and a desire for the state's extension as the only aspiration not liable to censure,—who can in thought trace back these sharplymarked contrasts to that original unity which embraced them both, prepared the way for their development, and at length produced them ? It would bo foolish presumption to desire to lift this veil; wo shall only endeavour to indicate in brief outline the beginnings of Italian nationality and its connections with an earlier period ; to direct the guesses of the discerning reader rather than to express them. All that may be called the patriarchal element in the\n\nChip. II.]\n\n.Earliest Migrations into Italy.\n\n49\n\nstate rested in Greece and Italy 011 the same KndS™'Iy foundations. Under this head comes especially bta tlement of the Claudian clansmen on the Anio ; and that the other districts of the earliest division originated in a similar manner is indicated quite as certainly b y their names. These names are not, like those of the districts ments.\n\n* A French statist, Durcau de la Malle (Econ. Pol. des Romains, ii. 220), compares with the Roman Campagna the district of Limagne in Auvergne, which is likewise a wide, much intersected, and uneven plain, with a superficial soil of decomposed lava and ashes—the remains of extinct volcanoes. The population, at least 2500 to the square league, is one of the densest to be found in purely agricultural districts: property is subdivided to an extraordinary extent. Tillage is carried on almost entirely by manual labour, with spade, hoe, or m a t t o c k ; only in exceptional cases a light plough is substituted drawn by two cows, the wife of the peasant not unfrequently taking the place of one of them in the yoke. The team serves at once to furnish milk and to till the land. They have two harvests in the year, c o m and vegetables ; there is no fallow. The average yearly rent for an arpent of arable land is 100 francs. If instead of such an arrangement this same land were to be divided among six or seven large landholders, and a system of management by stewards and day labourers were to supersede the husbandry of the small proprietors, in a hundred years the Limagne would doubtless be as waste, forsaken, and miserable as the Campagna di Roma is at the present day.\n\nSettlements\n\nCHAP. I I I . ]\n\nof the\n\n63\n\nLatins.\n\nadded at a later period, derived from the localities, but are formed without exception from the names of clans ; and the clans who thus gave their names to the wards of the original Roman territory are, so for as they have not become entirely extinct (as in the case with the Camilii, Oalerii, Lemonii, Pollii, Pupinii, Voltinii), the very oldestpatrician families of liome, the Aemilii, Cornelii, Fabii, Iloratii, Menenii, Papirii, Bomilii, Sergii, Veturii. It is worthy of remark, that not one of these clans can be shown to have taken up its settlement in Rome only at a later epoch. Every Italian, and doubtless also every Hellenic, canton must, like that of Rome, have been divided into a number of groups associated at once by locality and by clanship ; such a clan-settlement is the \" house\" (olxia) of the Greeks, from which very frequently the xw/t«t and Srj/ioi originated among them, like the iribus in Rome. The corresponding Italian terms \" house\" (vicus) or \" building\" (pagus, from pang are) indicate, in like manner, the joint settlement of the members of a clan, and thence come by an easily understood transition to signify in common use hamlet or village. As each household had its own portion of land, so the clan-household or village had clanlands belonging to it, which, as will afterwards be shown, were managed up to a comparatively late period after the analogy of household-lands, that is, on the system of joint possession. Whether it was in Latium itself that the clanhouseholds became developed into clan-villages, or whether the Latins were already associated in clans when they immigrated into Latium, are questions which we are just as little able to answer as we are to determine how far, in addition to the original ground of common ancestry, the clan may have been based on the incorporation or co-ordination from without of individuals not related to it by blood. These clanships, however, were from the beginning regarded not as independent societies, but as the 1 Cantona.\n\npopulus).\n\nf\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nintegral parts of a political community (civitas, This first presents itself as an aggregate of a\n\n64\n\nSettlements of the Latins.\n\n[BOOK I.\n\nnumber of clan-villages of the same stock, language, and manners, bound to mutual observance of law and mutual legal redress and to united action in aggression and defence. A fixed local centre was quite as necessary in the case of such a canton as in that of a clanship ; but as the members of the clan, or in other words the constituent elements of the canton, dwelt in villages, the centre of the canton cannot have been a town or place of joint settlement in the strict sense. It must, on the contrary, have been simply a place of common assembly, containing the seat of justice and the common sanctuary of the canton, where the members of the canton met every eighth day for purposes of intercourse and amusement, and where, in ease of war, they obtained a safer shelter for themselves and their cattle than in the villages : in ordinary circumstances this place of meeting was not at all or but scantily inhabited. Ancient places of refuge, of a kind quite similar, may still be recognized at the present day on the tops of several of the hills in the highlands of east Switzerland. Such a place was called in Italy \" height\" (capitolium, like uxqa, the mountain-top), or \" stronghold \" (arx, from arcere) ; it was not a town at first, but it became the nucleus of one, as houses naturally gathered round the stronghold and were afterwards surrounded with the \" r i n g \" (wrbs, connected with urvus, curvus, perhaps also with orbis). The stronghold and town were visibly distinguished from each other by the number of gates, of which the stronghold had as few as possible, and the town many, the former ordinarily but one, the latter at least three. Such fortresses were the bases of that cantonal constitution which prevailed in Italy anterior to the existence of towns : a constitution, the nature of which may still be recognized with some degree of clearness in those provinces of Italy which did not until a late period reach, and in some cases have not yet fully reached, the stage in towns,' such as the land of the O of aggregation CO © Marsi and the small cantons of the Abruzzi. The country of the Aequiculi, who even in the imperial period dwelt not in towns, but in numerous open hamlets, presents a\n\nOn n*. in.J\n\nSettlements of the Latins.\n\nb'5\n\nnumber of ancient ring-walls, which, regarded as \" deserted towns \" with their solitary temples, excited the astonishment of the Roman as well as of modern archaeologists, who have fancied that they could find accommodation there, the former for their \"primitive inhabitants\" (aborigines), the latter for their Pelasgians. W e shall certainly be, nearer the truth in recognizing these structures not as walled towns, but as places of refuge for the inhabitants of the district, such as were doubtless found in more ancient times over all Italy, although constructed in less artistic style. It was natural that at the period when the stocks that had made the transition to urban life were surrounding their towns with stone walls, those districts whose inhabitants continued to dwell in open hamlets should replace the earthen ramparts and palisades of their strongholds with buildings of stone. \"When in later ages peace was securely established throughout the land and such fortresses were no longer needed, these places of refuge were abandoned and soon became a riddle to after generations. These cantons accordingly, having their rendezvous in s o m o stron Localities of g b o l d , and including a certain number 1 06 cantons ^ ' f ° r m the primitive political unities with which Italian history \"begins. A t what period, and to what extent, such cantons were formed in Latium, cannot be determined with precision; nor is it a matter of special historical interest. The isolated Alban range, that natural stronghold of Latiu.m, which offered to settlers the most wholesome air, the freshest springs, and the most secure position, would doubtless be first occupied by the new comers. Here accordingly, along the narrow plateau above Palazzuola, between the Alban lake (Lago di\n\nGastello) and the Alban mount (Monte Cava\"), extended the town of Alba, which was universally regarded as the primitive seat of the Latin stock, and the mother-city of S o m e as well as of all the other Old Latin communities; here, too, on the slopes lay the very ancient Latin canton-centres of Lanuvium, Aricia, and Tusculum. Here are found some of those primitive works of masonry, which usually mark\n\n66\n\nSettlements of the Latins.\n\n[BOOK I.\n\nthe beginnings of civilization and seem to stand as a witness to posterity that in reality Pallas Athene, when she does appear, comes into the world full grown. Such is the escarpment of the wall of rock below Alba in the direction of Palazzuola, whereby the place, which is rendered naturally inaccessible by the steep declivities of Monte Cavo on the south, is rendered equally unapproachable on the north, and only the two narrow approaches on the east and west, which are capable of being easily defended, are left open for traffic. Such, above all, is the large subterranean tunnel cut—so that a man can stand upright within it—through the hard wall of lava, 0 0 0 0 feet thick, by which the waters of the lake formed in the old crater of the Alban Mount were reduced to their present level and a considerable space was gained for tillage on the mountain itself. The summits of the last offshoots of the Sabine range form natural fastnesses of the Latin plain ; and the cantonstrongholds there gave rise at a later period to the considerable towns of Tibur and Praeneste. Labiei too, Gabii, and Nomentum in the plain between the Alban and Sabine hills and the Tiber, Rome on the Tiber, Laurentum and Lavinium on the coast, were all more or less ancient centres of Latin colonization, not to speak of many others less famous and in some cases almost forgotten. All these cantons were in primitive times politically Tiio Latin sovereign, and each of them was governed by league. jts prjnce the co-operation of the council of elders and the assembly of warriors. Nevertheless the feeling of fellowship based on community of descent and of language not only pervaded the whole of them, but manifested itself in an important religious and political institution—the perpetual league of the collective Latin cantons. The presidency belonged originally, according to the universal Italian as well as Hellenic usage, to that canton within whose bounds lay the meeting-place of the league; in this case it was the canton of Alba, which, as we have said, was generally regarded as the oldest and most eminent of the Latin cantons. The communities entitled to\n\nCHAP.\n\nIII.]\n\nSettlements of the\n\nLatins.\n\n67\n\nparticipate in the league were in the beginning thirty—a number which we find occurring with singular frequency as the sum of the constituent parts of a commonwealth in Grecce and Italy. W h a t cantons originally made up the number of the thirty old Latin communities or, as with reference to the metropolitan rights of Alba they are also called, the thirty Alban colonics, tradition has not recorded, and we can no longer ascertain. The rendezvous of this union was, like the Pamboeotia and the Panionia among the similar confederacies of the Greeks, the \" Latin festiv a l \" ( f e r i a e Latinae), at which, on the \" M o u n t of A l b a \" (Mom Albanvs, Monte Cavo), upon a day annually appointed by the chief magistrate for the purpose, an ox was offered in sacrificc by the assembled Latin stock to the \" Latin god \" (Jupiter Latiaris). Each community taking part in the ceremony had to contribute to the sacrificial feast its fixed proportion of cattle, milk, and cheese, and to receive in return a portion of the roasted victim. These usages continued down to a late period, and are well known : respecting the more important legal bearings of this association we can do little else than institute conjectures. F r o m the most ancient times there were held, in connection with the religious festival on the Mount of Alba, assemblies of the representatives of the several communities at the neighbouring Latin seat of justice at the source of the Fercntina (near Marino). Indeed such a confederacy cannot be conceived to exist without having a certain power of superintendence over the associated body, and without possessing a system of law binding on all. Tradition records, and we may well believe, that the league exercised jurisdiction in reference to violations of federal law, and that it could in such cases pronounce even sentence of death. The equality in respect of legal rights and of intermarriage that subsisted among the Latin communities at a later date may perhaps be regarded as an integral part of the primitive law of the league, so that any Latin man could beget lawful children with any Latin woman and\n\n68\n\nSettlements of the Latins.\n\n[BOOK I.\n\nacquire landed property and carry on trade in any part of Latium. The league may have also provided a federal tribunal of arbitration for the mutual disputes of the cantons ; on the other hand, there is no proof that the league imposed any limitation on the sovereign right of each community to make peace or war. In like manner there, can be no doubt that the constitution of the league implied the possibility of its waging defensive or even aggressive war in its own name ; in which case, of course, it would be necessary to have a federal commander-in-chief. But wo have no reason to suppose that in such an event each community was compelled by law to furnish a contingent for the army, or that, conversely, any one was interdicted from undertaking a war on its own account even against a member of the league. There are, however, indications that during the Latin festival, just as was the case during the festivals of the Hellenic leagues, \" a truce of G o d \" was observed throughout all Latium ; * and probably on that occasion even tribes at feud granted safe-conducts to each other. It is still less in our power to define the privileges of the presiding canton; only we may safely affirm that there is no reason for recognizing in the Alban presidency a real political hegemony over Latium, and that possibly, nay probably, it had no more significance in Latium than the honorary presidency of Elis had in Greece.f On the * The Latin festival is expressly called \" armistice \" (induiiae, Macrob, Sat. i. 16; i/.r/uiiiai, Dionys. iv. 49); and a war was not allowed to be begun during its continuance (Macrob. I. c.). f The assertion often made in ancient and modern times, that Alba once ruled over Latium under the form3 of a symmachy, nowhere linds on closer investigation sufficient support. All history begins not with the union, but with the disunion of a nation ; and it is very improbable that the problem of the union of Latium, which Rome finally solved after some centuries of conflict, should have been already solved at an earlier period by Alba. It deserves to be remarked too that Rome never asserted in the capacity of heiress of Alba any claims of sovereignty proper over the Latin communities, but contented herself with an honorary presidency; which no doubt, when it became combined with material\n\nCHAP.\n\nIII.]\n\nSettlements of the\n\nLatins.\n\n69\n\nwhole it is probable that the extent of this Latin league, and the amount of its jurisdiction, wore somewhat unsettled and fluctuating ; yet it remained throughout not an accidental aggregate of various communities more or less alien to each other, but the just and necessary expression of the relationship of the Latin stock. The Latin league may not have at all times included all Latin communities, but it never at any rate granted the privilege of membership to any that were not Latin. Its counterpart in Greece was not the Delphic Amphictyony, but the Boeotian or Aetolian confederacy. These very general outlines must suffice: any attempt to draw the lines more sharply would only falsify the picture. The manifold play of mutual attraction and repulsion among those earliest political atoms, the cantons, passed away in Latium without witnesses competent to tell the tale. W e must now be content to realise the one great abiding fact that they possessed a common centre, to which they did not sacrifice their individual independence, but by means of which they cherished and increased the feeling of their belonging collectively to the same nation. By sueh a common possession the way was prepared for their advance from that cantonal individuality, with which the history of every people necessarily begins, to the national union with which the history of every people ends or at any rate ought to end. power, afforded a handle for her pretensions of hegemony. Testimonies, strictly so called, can scarcely be adduced on such a question; and least I of all do such passages as Festus v. praetor, p. 07, and Dionys. iii. 10, suffice to stamp Alba as a Latin Athens.\n\nCHAPTER TIIB\n\nBEGINNINGS\n\nIV. OF\n\nROME.\n\nfourteen miles up from the mouth of the river Tiber lulls of moderate elevation rise on both banks of tlio stream, higher on the right, lower on the left bank. W i t h the latter group there has been closely associated for at least two thousand five hundred years the name of the Romans. W e are unable, of course, to tell how or when that name arose ; this much only is certain, that in the oldest form of it known to us the inhabitants of the canton are called not Romans, but (by a shifting of sound that frequently occurs in the earlier period of a language, but fell very early into abeyance in Latin *) Ramnians (Ramnes), a fact which constitutes an expressive testimony to the immemorial antiquity of the name. Its derivation cannot be given with certainty ; possibly \" Ramnes\" may mean \" foresters \" or \" bushmen.\" But they were not the only dwellers on the hills by the Titic? Ln- bank of the Tiber. In the earliest division of ceroe. ^ e burgesses of Rome a trace has been preserved of the fact that that body arose out of the amalgamation of three cantons once probaby independent, the Ramnians, Tities, and Luceres, into a single commonwealth—in other words, out of such a synoikismos as that from which Athens arose in Attica.f The great antiquity of this threeABOUT\n\n^^\n\n* A similar change of sound is exhibited in the case of the following formations, all of them of a very ancient kind: pars portio, Mars triors, farreum ancient form for hoireum, Fabii Fowii, Valerius Volesus, vacuus vocivus. •(• The synoikismos did not necessarily involve an actual settlement together at ono Fpot; but while each resided as formely on his own\n\nCm p. IV7.]\n\nThe Beginnings of Rome.\n\n71\n\nfold division of the community * is perhaps best evinced by the fact that the Romans, in matters especially of constitutional law, regularly used the forms tribuere (\" to divide into three \") and tribus (\" a third \") in the general sense of \" to divide \" and \" a part,\" and the latter expression (tribus), like our \" quarter,\" early lost its original signification of number. After the union each of these three communities—once separate, but now forming subdivisions of a single community—still possessed its third of the common domain, and had its proportional representation in the burgess-foree and in the council of the elders. In ritual also, the number divisible by three of the members of almost all the oldest colleges—of the Vestal Virgins, the Salii, the Arval Brethren, the Luperei, the Augurs—probably had reference to that three-fold partition. These three elements into which the primitive body of burgesses in Rome was divided have had theories of the most extravagant absurdity engrafted upon them. The irrational opinion that the Roman nation was a mongrel people finds its support in that division, and its advocates have striven by various means to represent the three great Italian races as elements entering into the composition of the primitive Rome, and to transform a people which has exhibited in language, polity, and religion, a pure and national development such as few have equalled, into a confused aggregate of Etruscan and Sabine, Hellenic and, forsooth ! even Pelasgian fragments. land, there was thenceforth only ono council-hall and court-house for the whole. Thucyd. ii. 15 ; Herodot. i. 1Ï0. * We might even, looking to the Attic rgPtit's and the Umbrian trifo, raise the question whether a triple ¿ivis ; jn of the community was not a fundamental principle of the Graeco-Italians : in that case the triple division of the Roman community would not be referable to the amalgamation of several once independent tribes. But, in order to the establishment of an hypothesis so much at variance with tradition, such a threefold division would require to present itself more generally throughout the Graeco-Italian field than seems to be the case, and to appear uniformly everywhere as the ground-scheme. The Umbrians may possibly have adopted the word tribus only when they came under the influence of Roman rule ; it cannot with certainty be traced in Oscan.\n\nThe Beginnings of Borne.\n\n[BOOK I.\n\nSetting aside self-contradictory and unfounded hypotheses, we may sum up in a few words all that can be said respecting the nationality of the component elements of the primitive Roman commonwealth. That the Ramnians were a Latin stock cannot be doubted, for they gave their name to the now Roman commonwealth and therefore must have substantially determined the nationality of the united community. Respecting the origin of the Luceres nothing can be affirmed, except that there is no difficulty in the way of our assigning them, like the Ramnians, to the Latin stock. The second of these communities, on the other hand, is with one consent derived from Sabina; and this view can at least be traced to a tradition preserved in the Titian brotherhood, which represented that priestly college as having been instituted, on occasion of the Tities being admitted into the collective community, for the preservation of their distinctive Sabine ritual. It would appear, therefore, that at a period very remote, when the Latin and Sabellian stocks were beyond question far less sharply contrasted in language, manners, and customs than wrere the Roman and the Samnite of a later age, a Sabellian community entered into a Latin canton-union; and, as in the older and more credible traditions without exception the Tities take precedence of the Ramnians, it is probable that the intruding Tities compelled the older Ramnians to accept the synoikismos. A mixture of different nationalities certainly therefore took placc; but it hardly exercised an influence greater than the migration, for example, which occurred some centuries afterwards of the Sabine Attus Clauzus or Appius Claudius and his clansmen and clients to Rome. The earlier admission of the Tities among the Ramnians does not entitle us to class the community among mongrel peoples any more than does that subsequent reception of the Claudii among the Romans. W i t h the exception, perhaps, of isolated national institutions handed down in connection with ritual, the existence of Sabellian elements can nowhere be pointed out in R o m e ; and the Latin language in particular furnishes absolutely no\n\nCHAP.\n\nThe Beginnings\n\nIV.]\n\nof Rome.\n\nsupport to such an hypothesis.* It would in fact be more than surprising, if the Latin nation should have had its nationality in any sensible degree affected by the insertion of a single community from a stock so very closely related to i t ; and, besides, it must not be forgotten that at the time when the Tities settled beside the Ramnians, Latin nationality rested on Latium as its basis, and not on Rome. The new tripartite Roman commonwealth was, notwithstanding some incidental elements which were originally Sabelliau, just what the community of the Ramnians had previously been—a portion of the Latin nation. Long, in all probability, before an urban settlement Romo the arose on the Tiber,' these Ramnians,' Tities,' and emporium\n\nLuccres, at first separate, afterwards united, had their stronghold on the Roman hills, and tilled their fields from the surrounding villages. The \" wolffestival \" (JLupercalia), which the gens of the Quinctii celebrated on the Palatine hill, was probably a tradition from these primitive ages—a festival of husbandmen and shepherds, which more than any other preserved the homelypastimes of patriarchal simplicity, and, singularly enough, maintained itself longer than all the other heathen festivals in Christian Rome. F r o m these settlements the later Rome arose. The character of founding of a city in the strict sense, such as its site. ^he ] e g e n c l assumes, is of course to be reckoned altogether out of the question : Rome was not built in a day. But the serious consideration of the historian may * Although the older opinion, that Latin is to bo viewed as a mixed language made up of Greek and non-Greek elements, has been now abandoned on all sides, judicious inquirers even (c. g. Schwegler, B. G, i. 184, 193) still seek to discover in Latin a mixture of two nearly related Italian dialects. But we ask in vain for the linguistic or historical facts which render such an hypothesis necessary. When a language presents the appearance of being an intermediate link between two others, every philologist knows that the phenomenon may quite as probably depend, and more frequently does depend, on organic development than on external intermixture.\n\n4\n\nThe Beginnings of Rome.\n\n[BOOK I .\n\nwell be directed to the inquiry, in what way Rome could so early attain the prominent political position which it held in Latium—so different from what the physical character of the locality would have led us to anticipate. The site of Rome is less healthy and less fertile than that of most of the old Latin towns. Neither the vine nor the fig succeed well in the immediate environs, and there is a want of springs yielding a good supply of w a t e r ; for neither the otherwise excellent fountain of the Camenae before the Porta Capena, nor the Capitoline well, afterwards enclosed within the Tullianum, furnish it in any abundance. Another disadvantage arises from the frequency with which the river overflows its banks. Its very slight fall renders it unable to carry off the water, which during the rainy season descends in large quantities from the mountains, with sufficient rapidity to the sea, and in consequence it floods the low-lying lands and the valleys that open between the hills, and converts them into swamps. F o r a settler the locality was anything but attractive. In antiquity itself an opinion was expressed that the first body of immigrant cultivators could scarce have spontaneously resorted in search of a suitable settlement to that unhealthy and unfruitful spot in a region otherwise so highly favoured, and that it must have been necessity, or rather some special motive, which led to the establishment of a city there. Even the legend betrays its sense of the strangeness of the fact: the story of the foundation of Rome by refugees from Alba under the leadership of the sons of an Alban prince, Romulus and Remus, is nothing but a naive attempt of primitive quasihistory to explain the singular circumstance of the place having arisen on a site so unfavourable, and to connect at the same time the origin of Rome with the general metropolis of Latium. Such tales, which profess to be historical but are merely improvised explanations of no very ingenious character, it is the first duty of history to dismiss ; but it may perhaps be allowed to go a step further, and after weighing the special relations of the locality to propose a positive conjecture not regarding the way in\n\nChap, iv.]\n\nThe Beginninga of Rome.\n\n75\n\nwhich the place originated, but regarding the circumstances which occasioned its rapid and surprising prosperity and led to its occupying its peculiar position in Latium. Let us notice first of all the earliest boundaries of the Earliest limRoman territory. Towards the east the towns Roman ter- of Antemnae, Fidenae, Caenina, Collatia, and ntory. Gabii lie in the immediate neighbourhood, some of them not five miles distant from the gates of the Servian R o m e ; and the boundary of the canton must have been in the close vicinity of the city gates. On the south we find at a distance of fourteen miles the powerful communities of Tusculum and A l b a ; and the Roman territory appears not to have extended in this direction beyond the Fossa Cluilia, five miles from Rome. In like manner, towards the south-west, the boundary betwixt Rome and Lavinium was at the sixth milestone. While in a landward direction the Roman canton was thus everywhere confined within the narrowest possible limits, from the earliest times, on the other hand, it extended without hindrance on both banks of the Tiber towards the sea. Between Rome and the coast there occurs no locality that is mentioned as an ancient canton-centre, and no trace of any ancient cantonboundary. The legend indeed, which has its definite explanation of the origin of everything, professes to tell us that the Roman possessions on the right bank of the Tiber, the \" seven hamlets\" {septem pagi), and the important saltworks at its mouth, were taken by king Romulus from the Veientes, and that king Ancus fortified on the right bank\n\nthe tile du pont, the \" mount of Janus \" (Ianicvlum), and founded on the left the Roman Peiraeus, the seaport at the river's \" m o u t h \" (Ostia). But in fact we have evidence more trustworthy than that of legend, that the possessions on the Etruscan bank of the Tiber must have belonged to the original territory of R o m e ; for in this very quarter, at the fourth milestone on the later road to the port, lay the gi'ove of the creative goddess (Dca Dia), the primitive chief seat of the Arval festival and A r v a l brotherhood of Rome. Indeed from time, immemorial the clan of the\n\n76\n\nThe Beginnings of Rome.\n\n[BOOK\n\nI.\n\nRomilii, the chief probably of all the Roman clans, was settled in this very quarter; the Janiculum formed a part of the city itself, and Ostia was a burgess colony or, in other words, a suburb. This cannot have been the result of mere accident. The Tiber was the natural highway for the traffic of The Tiber . , . , T and its traf- Latium ; and its mouth, on a coast scantily provided with harbours, became necessarily the anchorage of seafarers. Moreover, the Tiber formed from very ancient times the frontier defence of the Latin stock against their northern neighbours. There was no place better fitted for an emporium of the Latin river and sea traffic, and for a maritime frontier fortress of Latium, than Rome. It combined the advantages of a strong position and of immediate vicinity to the r i v e r ; it commanded both banks of the stream down to its mouth ; it was so situated as to be equally convenient for the river navigator descending the Tiber or the Anio, and for the seafarer with vessels of so moderate a size as those which were then used ; and it afforded greater protection from pirates than places situated immediately on the coast. That Rome was indebted accordingly, if not for its origin, at any rate for its importance, to these commercial and strategical advantages of its position, there are numerous indications to show—indications which are of very different weight from the statements of quasi-historical romances. Thence arose its very ancient relations with Caere, which was to Etruria what Rome was to Latium, and accordingly became Rome's most intimate neighbour and commerical ally. Thence arose the unusual importance of the bridgos over the Tiber, and of bridge-building generally in the Roman commonwealth. Thence came the galley in the city a r m s ; thence, too, the very ancient Roman port-duties on the exports and imports of Ostia, which were from the first levied only on what was to be exposed for sale (proinercale), not on what was for the shipper's own use (usuarium), and which were therefore in reality a tax upon commerce. Thence, to anticipate, the comparatively early occurrence in Rome of coined\n\nCUAF. I V . ]\n\nThe Beginnings of Rome.\n\nT7\n\nmoney, and of commercial treaties with transmarine states. In this sense, then, it is certainly not improbable that Rome may have been, as the legend assumes, a creation rather than a growth, and the youngest rather than the oldest among the Latin cities. Beyond doubt the country was already in some degree cultivated, and the Alban range as well as various other heights of the Campagna were occupied by strongholds, when the Latin frontier emporium arose on the Tiber. Whether it was a resolution of the Latin confederacy, or the clear-sighted genius of some unknown founder, or the natural development of traffic, that called the city of Rome into being, it is vain even to surmise. But in connection with this view of the position of Rome as the emporium of Latium another obdilmcter'of servation suggests itself. A t the time when Kome. history begins to dawn on us, Rome appears, in contradistinction to the league of the Latin communities, as a compact urban unity. The Latin habit of dwelling in open villages, and of using the common stronghold only for festivals and assemblies or in case of special need, was subjected to restriction at a far earlier period, probably, in the canton of Rome than anywhere else in Latium. The Roman did not cease to manage his farm in person, or to regard it as his proper home ; but the unwholesome atmosphere of the Campagna could not but induce him to take up his abode as much as possible on the more airy and salubrious city hills ; and by the side of the cultivators of the soil there must have been a numerous non-agricultural population, partly foreigners, partly native, settled there from very early times. This to some extent accounts for the dense population of the old Roman territory, which may be estimated at the utmost at 115 square miles, partly of marshy or sandy soil, and which, even under the earliest constitution of the city, furnished a force of 3300 freemen ; so that it must have numbered at least 10,000 free inhabitants. But further, every one acquainted with the Romans and their history is aware that it is their urban and mer-\n\n78\n\nThe Beginnings of Rome.\n\n[BOOK I.\n\ncantile character which forms the basis of whatever is peculiar in their public and private life, and that the distinction between them and the other Latins and Italians in general is pre-eminently the distinction between citizen and rustic. Rome, indeed, was not a mercantile city like Corinth or Carthage; for Latium was an essentially agricultural region, and Rome was in the first instance, and continued to be, pre-eminently a Latin city. But the distinction between Rome and the mass of the other Latin towns must certainly be traced back to its commercial position, and to the type of character produced by that position in its citizens. If Rome was the emporium of the Latin districts, we can readily understand how, along with and in addition to Latin husbandry, an urban life should have attained vigorous and rapid development there and thus have laid the foundation for its distinctive career. It is far more important and more practicable to follow out the course of this mercantile and strategical growth of the city of Rome, than to attempt the useless task of analyzing the insignificant and but little diversified communities of primitive times. The course of this development may still be so far recognized in the traditions regarding the successive circumvallations and fortifications of Rome, the formation of which necessarily kept pace with the growth of the Roman commonwealth in importance as a city. The town, which in the course of centuries grew up as The paiaRome, in its original form embraced according tine city. to trustworthy testimony only the Palatine, or \" square Rome \" (Roma quadrata), as it was called in later times from the irregularly quadrangular form of the Palatine hill. The gates and walls that enclosed this original city remained visible down to the period of the empire: the sites of two of the former, the Porta Romana near S. Giorgio in Velabro, and the Porta Mugionis at the Arch of Titus, are still known to us, and the Palatine ring-wall is described by Tacitus from his own observation at least on the sides looking towards the Aventine and Caelian. Many\n\nCHAP. I V . ]\n\nThe Beginnings of Rome.\n\n79\n\ntraces indicate that this was the ecntrc and original seat of the urban settlement. On the Palatine was to be found the sacred s y m b o l of that settlement, the \" outfit v a u l t \" (niundus) as it was called, in which the first settlers deposited a sufficiency of everything necessary for a household and added a clod of their dear native earth. There, too, was situated the building in which all the curies assembled for religious and other purposes, each at its own hearth (curiae veteres). There stood the meeting-house of the \" Leapers \" (curia Saliorum) in which also the sacred shields of M a r s were preserved, the sanctuary of the \" W o l v e s \" (Lupercal), and the residence of the priest of Jupiter. O n and near this hill the legend o f the founding of the city placed the scenes of its leading incidents, and the straw-covered house of Romulus, the shepherd's hut of his foster-father Faustulus, the sacred fig-tree towards which the cradle with the twins had floated, the cornclian cherry-tree that sprang from the shaft of the spear which the founder of the city had hurled from the A v e n t i n e over the valley of the Circus into this enclosure, and other such sacred relics were pointed out to the believer. Temples in the proper sense of the term were still at this time unknown, and accordingly the Palatine has nothing of that sort to show belonging to the primitive age. The public assemblies of the community were early transferred to another locality, so that thenoriginal site is unknown ; only it m a y bo conjectured that the free space round the mundus, afterwards called the Area ApolUnis, was the primitive place of assembly for the burgesses and the senate, and the stage erected over the mundus itself the primitive seat of justice of the R o m a n community. The \" festival of the Seven Mounts \" (septimontium), The Seven again, preserved the m e m o r y of the more cxMounts. tended settlement which gradually formed round the Palatine. Suburbs grew up one after another, each protected b y its own separate though weaker circumvallation and joined to the original ring-wall of the Palatine, as in fen districts the outer dikes are joined 012 to the main\n\n80\n\nThe Beginnings of Home.\n\n[BOOK I.\n\ndike. The \" Seven Rings \" were, the Palatine itself; the Cermalus, the slope of the Palatine in the direction of the morass that in the earliest times extended \"between it and the Capitolinc (velabrum) ; the Velia, the ridge which connected the Palatine with the Esquiline, \"but in subsequent times was almost wholly obliterated by the buildings of the empire; the Fagutal, the Oppius, and the Cispius, the three summits of the Esquiline; lastly, the Sucusa, or Subura, a fortress constructed outside of the earthen rampart which protected the new town on the Carinae, in the low ground between the Esquiline and the Quirinal beneath S. Pietro in Vincoli. These additions, manifestly the results of a gradual growth, clearly reveal to a certain extent the earliest history of the Palatine Rome, especially when we compare with them the Servian arrangement of districts which was afterwards formed on the basis of this earliest division. The Palatine was the original seat of the Roman comoidcst setmunity, the oldest and originally the only ringtiements in wall. The urban settlement, however., began at t h e Palatine ' o and SubuRome as well as elsewhere not within, but under ran regions.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n. .\n\n.\n\n, ^\n\n- I T - I T\n\nthe protection or, the stronghold; and the oldest settlements with which we are acquainted, and which afterwards formed the first and second regions in the Servian division of the city, lay in a circle round the Palatine. These included the settlement on the declivity of the Cermalus with the \" street of the Tuscans \"—a name, which was probably a memorial of the commercial intercourse that subsisted between the Caerites and Romans and was already perhaps carried on with vigour in the Palatine city —and the settlement on the Velia; both of which subsequently along with the stronghold-hill itself constituted a region of the Servian city. Further, there were the component elements of the subsequent second region—the suburb on the Caelian, which probably embraced only its extreme point above the Colosseum ; that on the Carinae, the spur which projects from the Esquiline towards the Palatine ; and, lastly, the valley and outwork of the Subura, from which the whole region received its name. These two\n\nCHAP. I V . ]\n\nThe Beginnings of Rome.\n\n81\n\nregions jointly constituted the incipient city ; and the Suturan region, which extended at the baso of the stronghold, nearly from the Arch of Constantine to S. Pietro in Vincoli, and over the valley beneath, appears to have been more considerable and perhaps older than the settlements incorporated by the Servian arrangement in the Palatine region, because in the order of the regions the former takes precedence of the latter. A remarkable memorial of the distinction between these two portions of the city was preserved in one of the oldest sacred customs of the later Rome, the sacrifice of the October horse yearly offered in the Campus Martha : down to a late period a struggle took place at this festival for the horse's head between the men of the Subura and those of the Via Sacra, and according as victory lay with the former or with the latter, the head was nailed either to the Mamilian Tower (site unknown) in the Subura, or to the king's palace under the Palatine. It was the two halves of the old city that thus competed with each other on equal terms. A t that time, accordingly, the Esquiliae (which name strictly used is exclusive of the Carinae) were in reality what they were callcd, the \" outer buildings \" (ex-quiliae, like inquilinus, from colere) or suburb : this became the third region in the later city division, and it was always held in inferior consideration as compared with the Suburan and Palatine regions. Other neighbouring heights also, such as the Capitol and the Aventine, may probably have been occupied by the community of the Seven Mounts ; the \" b r i d g e of p i l e s \" in particular ( p o n s sublicius), thrown over the natural pier of the island in the Tiber, must have existed even then—the pontifical college alone is sufficient evidence of this—and the tête du pont on the Etruscan bank, the height of the Janiculum, would not be left unoccupied ; but the community had not as yet brought either within the circuit of its fortifications. The regulation which was adhered to as a ritual rule down to the latest times, that the bridge should be composed simply of wood without iron, manifestly shows that in its original practical use it was to be merely a flying bridge, which 4*\n\n82\n\nThe Beginnings of Rome.\n\n[ B O O K I.\n\nmust be capable of being easily at any time broken off or burnt. W e recognize in this circumstance how insecure for a long time and liable to interruption was the command of the passage of the river on the part of the Roman community. No relation is discoverable between the urban settlements thus gradually formed and the three communities into which from an immemorially early period the Roman commonwealth was in political law divided. As the Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres appear to have been communities originally independent, they must have had their settlements originally apart; but they certainly did not dwell in separate circumvallations on the Seven Hills, and all fictions to this effect in ancient or modern times must be consigned by the intelligent inquirer to the same fate with the battle of the Palatine and the charming tale of Tarpeia. On the contrary each of the three tribes of Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres must have been distributed throughout the two regions of the oldest city, the Subura and Palatine, and the suburban region as well: with this may be connected the fact, that afterwards not only in the Suburan and Palatine, but in each of the regions subsequently added to the city, there were three pairs of Argean chapels. The Palatine city of the Seven Mounts may have had a history of its own ; no other tradition of it has survived than simply that of its having once existed. But as the leaves of the forest make room for the new growth of spring, although they fall unseen by human eyes, so has this unknown city of the Seven Mounts made room for the Rome of history. But the Palatine city was not the only one that in ancient times existed within the circle afterwards enclosed by the Servian walls; opposite to it, Romans on theQuninai. . n j m m e < 3i a t e vicinity, there lay a second city on the Quirinal. The \" old strong-hold \" ( Capitoliurn veins) with a sanctuary of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, and a temple of the goddess of Fidelity in which state treaties were publicly deposited, forms the evident counterpart of the later Capitol with its temple to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva,\n\nCHAP.\n\nIV.]\n\nThe Beginnings\n\nof\n\nRome.\n\n83\n\nand with its shrine of Fides Romana likewise destined as it were for a repository of international law, and furnishes clear proof that the Quirinal also was once the centre of an independent commonwealth. The sarao fact may be inferred from the double worship of Mars 011 the Palatine and the Quirinal; for Mars was the type of the warrior and the oldest chief divinity of the burgess communities of Italy. With this is connected the further circumstance that his ministers, the two primitive colleges of the \" Leapers \" (6alii) and of the \" Wolves \" (Luperci), existed in the later Rome in duplicate: by the side of the Salii of the Palatine there were also Salii of the Quirinal; by the side of the Quinctian Luperci of the Palatine there was a Fabian guild of Luperci, which in all probability had their sanctuary on the Quirinal.* A l l these indications, which even in themselves are of great weight, become more significant when we recollect that the accurately known circuit of the Palatine city of the Seven Mounts excluded the Quirinal, and that afterwards in the Servian Rome, while the first three regions corresponded to the former Palatine city, a fourth region was formed out of the Quirinal along with the neighbouring Viminal. Thus, too, we discover an explanation of the reason why the strong outwork of the Subura was constructed beyond the * T h a t the Quinctian Luperci h a d precedence in rank over t h e F a b ian is evident from t h e circumstance that the fabulists attribute t h e Quinctii t o Romulus, the Fabii to Remus (Ovid. Fast. ii. 373, seq.; Yict. De Orij. 22). T h a t the Fabii belonged to t h e Hill-Romans is shown b y the sacrifice of their gens on t h e Quirinal (Liv. v. 46, 52), whether t h a t sacrifice may or m a y not have been connected with the Lupercalia.

Lastly, even the name lias not been lost b y which the men of the Quirinal distinguished themselves f r o m their Palatine neighbours. As tlie Palatine city took the n a m e of \" the Seven Mounts,\" its citizens called themselves the \" m o u n t - m e n \" (montani), and the term \" m o u n t , \" while applied to the other heights belonging to the city, was above all associated with the P a l a t i n e ; so the Quirinal height—although not lower, but oil the contrary somewhat higher, than the former—as well as the adjacent Viminal never in the strict use of the language received any other name than \" h i l l ' ' (collis). In the ritual records, indeed, the Quirinal was not unfrequently designated as the \" hill \" without further addition. In like manner the gate leading out from this height was usually called the \" hill-gate\" (porta collina); the priests of M a r s settled there were called those \" of the hill \" (Salii collini) in contrast to those of the Palatine (Salii Palatini), and the fourth Servian region formed out of this district was termed the hillregion (tribus collina).* The name of Romans primarily associated with the locality was probably appropriated b y\n\n* Although the name \" Hill of Quirinus \" was afterwards ordinarily used to designate the height where the Hill-Romans had their abode, we need not on that account regard the name \" Q u i r i t e s \" as having been originally reserved for the burgesses on the Quirinal. For the earliest indications point, as regards them, to the name Collini; while it is indisputably certain that the name Quirites denoted from the first, as well as subsequently, simply the full burgess, and had no connection with the distinction between montani and collini (comp. chap. v. infra). In fact, Mars quirinus, the spcar-bcaring god of Death, was originally worshipped as well on the Palatine as on the Quirinal • the oldest inscriptions found at what was afterwards called the Temple of Quirinus designate this divinity simply as Mars, but at a later period for the sake of distinction\n\nCHAP. I V . ]\n\nThe Beginnings of Rome.\n\n85\n\nthese \" Hill-men \" as well as by those of the \" Mounts; \" and the former perhaps designated themselves as \" Romans of the H i l l \" (Bomani collini). That a diversity of race may have lain at the foundation of this distinction, between the two neighbouring citics is possible ; but evidence sufficient to warrant our pronouncing a community established oil Latin soil to be of alien lineage is, in the ease of the Quirinal community, totally wanting.* Thus the site of the Roman commonwealth was still at ».elation be- this period occupied by the Mount-Romans of Paiatineand t h e Palatine and the Hill-Romans of the Quirias t w 0 se arate communiP communities confronting tics. each other and doubtless in many respects at feud, in some degree resembling the Montigiani and the the god of the Mount-Romans more especially was called Mars, the god of the Ilill-Romans more especially Quirinus. W h e n the Quirinal is called collis ac/onalis, \" h i l l of sacrifice,\" it is so designated merely as the centre of the religius rites of the Hill-Romana. * The evidence alleged for this (comp. e. g. Schwegler, li. G. i. 480) mainly rests on an etymologico-historieal hypothesis started by Varro and as usual unanimously echoed by the later writers, that the Latin quiris and quirinus are akin to the name of the Sabine town Cures, and that the Quirinal hill accordingly had been peopled from Cures. The linguistic affinity of these words is probable; but how little warrant there is for deducing from it such a historical inference must be obvious at once. That the old sanctuaries on this eminence (where besides, there was also a \" Collis Latiaris \") were Sabine, has been asserted, but has not been proved. Mars quirinus, Sol, Salus, Flora, Semo Sancus or Deus iidius were indeed Sabine, but they were also Latin, divinities, formed evidently during the epoch when Latins and Sabines still lived undivided. If a name like that of Semo Sancus (which moreover occurs in connection with the Tiber-island) is especially associated with the sacred places of the Quirinal which afterwards diminished in its importance (comp. the Porta Sanqualis deriving its name therefrom), every unbiassed inquirer will recognize in such a circumstance only a proof of the high antiquity of that worship, not a proof of its derivation from a neighbouring land. In so speaking we do not mean to deny that it is possible that old distinctions of race may have co-operated in producing this state of things ; but if such was the case, they have, so far as we are concerned, totally disappeared, and the views current among our contemporaries as to the Sabine element in the constitution of Rome are only fitted seriously to warn us against such baseless speculations leading to no result.\n\n86\n\nThe Beginnings of Home.\n\n[BOOK I .\n\nTrasteverini in modern Rome. That the community of the Seven Mounts early attained a great preponderance over that of the Quirinal may with certainty be inferred both from the greater extent of its newer portions and suburbs, and from the position of inferiority in which the former Hill-Romans were obliged to acquiesce under the later Servian arrangement. But even within the Palatine city there was hardly a true and complete amalgamation of the different constituent elements of the settlement. W e have already mentioned how the Subura and the Palatine annually contended for the horse's head; the several Mounts also, and even the several curies (there was as yet no common hearth for the city, but the various hearths of the curies subsisted side by side, although in the same locality) probably felt themselves to bo as yet more separated than united ; and Rome as a whole was probably rather an aggregate of urban settlements than a single city. It appears from many indications that the houses of the old and powerful families were constructed somewhat after the manner of fortresses and were rendered capable of defence—a precaution, it may be presumed, not unnecessary. It was the magnificent structure ascribed to king Servius Tullius that first surrounded not merely those two cities of the Palatine and Quirinal, but also the heights of the Aventine and the Capitoline which were not comprehended within their enclosure, with a single great ring-wall, and thereby created the new Rome—the Rome of History. But ere this mighty work was undertaken, the relations of Rome to the surrounding country had beyond doubt undergone a complete revolution. As the period, during which the husbandman guided his plough on the seven hills of Rome just as on the other hills of Latium, and the usually unoccupied places of refuge on particular summits alone presented the germs of a more permanent settlement, corresponds to the earliest epoch of the Latin stock, an epoch barren of traffic and barren of action; as thereafter the flourishing settlement on the Palatine and in the \" Seven Rings \" was coincident with the occupation of the mouths of the Tiber by the Ro-\n\nCHAP.

B u t the nations t h a t have been most susceptible of culture have diverged widely f r o m each other in their conception and \"treatment of the natural distinctions which the household thus presents. By some they have been apprehended and wrought out m o r e profoundly, b y others m o r e superficially ; b y some m o r e under their moral, b y others more under their legal aspects. N o n e has equalled the I i o m a n in the simple b u t inexorable embodiment in law of the principles pointed out b y nature herself. The family formed an unity.

T h e children of daughters on the other hand were excluded, because, if born in wedlock, they belonged to the family of the husband ; and if begotten out of wedlock, they had no place in a family at all. T o the E o m a n citizen a house of his own and the blessing of children appeared the end and essence of life. T h e death of the individual was not an evil, for it was a m a t t e r of n e c e s s i t y ; b u t the extinction of a household or of a clan was injurious\n\nCHIP,\n\nv.]\n\nOriginal Constitution of Rome.\n\n89\n\nto the community itself, which in tho earliest times therefore opened up to the childless the means of avoiding such a fatality by their adopting, in presence of the people, the children of others as their own. The Roman family from the first contained within it the conditions of a higher culture in the moral adjustment of the mutual relations of its members. Man alone could be head of a family. Woman did not indeed occupy a position inferior to man in the acquiring of property and m o n e y ; 011 the contrary the daughter inherited an equal share with her brother, and the mother an equal share with her children. But woman always and necessarily belonged to the household, not to the community; and in the household itself she necessarily held a position of domestic subjection —the daughter to her father, the wife to her husband,* the fatherless unmarried woman to her nearest male relatives ; it was by these, and not by the king, that in case of need woman was called to account. Within the house, however, woman was not servant but mistress. Exempted from the tasks of corn-grinding and cooking which according to Roman ideas belonged to the menials, the Roman housewife devoted herself in the main to the superintendence of her maid-servants, and to the accompanying labours of the distaff, which was to woman what the: plough was to man.f * This was not merely the case with the old religious marriage (mairimoniwn confarreatione)-, the civil marriage also(matrimonium consensu), although not in itself giving to the husband proprietary power oyer Ms wife, opened up the way for his acquiring this proprietary power, inasmuch as the legal ideas of \" formal deliver}'\" (coemptio), and \" prescription \" (itsus), were applied without ceremony to such a marriage. Until its acquisition, and in particular therefore during the period which elapsed before the completion of the prescription, the wife was (just as in the later marriage by causae probatio, until that took place), not uxor, but pro uxore. Down to the period when Roman j urisprudenee became a completed system the principle maintained its ground, that the wife who was not in her husband's power was not a married wife, but only passed as such (uxor tantummodo habetur. Cicero, Top. 3, 14). f The following epitaph, although belonging to a much later period, is not unworthy to have a place here. It is the stone that speaks:—\n\n90\n\nOriginal Constitution of Rome.\n\n[BOOK I.\n\nIn like manner, the moral obligations of parents towards their children were fully and deeply felt by the Roman nation ; and it was reckoned a heinous offence if a father neglected or corrupted his child, or if he even squandered his property to his child's disadvantage. In a legal point of view, however, the family was absolutely guided and governed b y the single all-powerful will of the \" f a t h e r of the household\" ( p a t e r familias). In relation to him all in the household were destitute of legal rights—the wife and the child no less than the bullock or the slave. As the virgin became b y the free choice of her husband his wedded wife, so it rested with his own free will to rear or not to rear the child which she bore to him. This maxim was not suggested b y indifference to the possession of a family ; on the contrary, the conviction that the founding of a house and the begetting of children were a moral necessity and a public d u t y had a deep and earnest hold of the R o m a n mind. Perhaps the only instance of support accorded on the part of the community in R o m e is the enactment that aid should be given t o the father who had three children presented to him at a birth ; while their views regarding exposure are indicated b y its religious proJlospes, quod dcieo, paidlum est.

Censurable, however, and injurious to the public weal as exposure might be, a father could not be divested of his right to resort to i t ; for he was, above all, thoroughly and absolutely master in bis household and it was intended that he should remain so. The father of the household not only maintained the strictest discipline over its members, but he had the right and duty of exercising judicial authority over them and of punishing them as he deemed fit in life and limb. The grownup son might establish a separate household or, as the Romans expressed it, maintain his \" own cattle \" (peculiwn) assigned to him by his father ; but in law all that the son acquired, whether by his own labour or by gift from a stranger, whether in his father's household or in his own, remained the father's property. So long as the father lived, the persons legally subject to him could never hold property of their own, and therefore could not alienate unless by him so empowered, or bequeath. In this respect wife and child stood quite on the same level with the slave, who was not unfrequently allowed to manage a household of his own, and who was likewise entitled to alienate when commissioned by his master. Indeed a father might convey his son as well as his slave in property to a third person : if the purchaser was a foreigner, the son became his slave; if he was a Roman, the son, while as a Roman he could not become a Roman's slave, stood at least to his purchaser in a\n\nslave's stead (in mancipii causfi). In reality the paternal and marital power was subject to no legal restrictions at all. Religion, indeed, pronounced its anathema on some of the worst cases of abuse. For example, besides the already mentioned restriction of the right of exposure, whoever sold his wife or married son was declared accursed ; and in a similar spirit it was enacted that in the exercise of domestic jurisdiction the father, and still more the husband, should not pronounce sentence on child or wife without having previously consulted the nearest blood-relations, his wife's as well as his own. But\n\n92\n\nOriginal Constitution of Home.\n\n[BOOK\n\nL\n\nsuch provisions as these involved no legal diminution of his powers, for t h e execution of the anathemas was the province of the gods, not of earthly justice, and the blood-relations called in to the domestic j u d g m e n t were present not to judge, b u t simply to advise the father of the household in his judicial office. But not only was the power of the master of the house unlimited and responsible to no one on earth ; it was also, as long as he lived, unchangeable and indestructible. According t o the Greek as well as Germanic laws the grownup son, who was practically independent of his father, was also independent l e g a l l y ; but the p o w e r of the R o m a n father could not be dissolved during his life either b y age or b y insanity, or even b y his own free will, except where a daughter passed b y a lawful marriage out of the hand of her father into the hand of her husband and, leaving her ' o own gens and the protection of her own gods to enter into the gens of her husband and the protection of his gods, became thenceforth subject to him as she had hitherto been to her father. It was easier, according to R o m a n law, for the slave to obtain release f r o m his master than for the son to obtain release f r o m his f a t h e r ; the manumission of the form e r was p e r m i t t e d at an early period, and b y simple f o r m s ; the release of the latter was only rendered possible a t a much later date, and by v e r y circuitous means. Indeed, if a master sold his slave and a father his son and the purchaser released both, the slave obtained his freedom, b u t the son b y the release simply reverted into his father's p o w e r as before. Thus t h e inexorable consistency with which the R o m a n s carried out their conception of the paternal and marital power converted it into a real right of property. Closely, however, as t h e power of the master of t h e household over wife and child approximated to his propriet a r y power over slaves and cattle, the m e m b e r s of the family were nevertheless separated b y a broad line of distinction, not m e r e l y in fact but in law, f r o m the family property. The power of the house-master—even apart f r o m\n\nCHAP,\n\nv.]\n\nOriginal Constitution of Rome.\n\n93\n\nthe fact that it appeared in operation only within the house —was of a transient, and in some degree of a representative, character. Wife and child did not exist merely for the house-father's sake in the sense in which property exists only for the proprietor, or in which the subjects of an absolute state exist only for the king ; they were the objects indeed of a legal right on his part, but they had at the same time capacities of right of their own ; they were not things, but persons. Their rights were dormant in respect of exercise, simply because the unity of the household demanded that it should be governed by a single representative; but when the master of the household died, his sons at once came forward as its masters and now obtained on their own account over the women and children and property the rights hitherto exercised over these by the father. On the other hand the death of the master occasioned no change in the legal position of the slave. So strongly was the unity of the family realized, that even the death of the master of the house did clan (gens). The descendants, who n o t entirely dissolve it. were rendered by that occurrence independent, regarded themselves as still in many respects an unity ; a principle which was made use of in arranging the succession of heirs and in many other relations, but especially in regulating the position of the widow and unmarried daughters. As according to the older Roman view a woman was not capable of having power either over others or over herself, the power over her, or, as it was in this case more mildly expressed, the \" guardianship \" (tutela), remained with the house to which she belonged, and was now exercised in the room of the deceased house-master b y the whole of the nearest male members of the family ; ordinarily, therefore, by sons over their mother, and by brothers over their sisters. In this sense the family, once founded, endured unchanged till the male stock of its founder died o u t ; only the bond of connection must of course have become practically more lax from generation to generation, until at length it became impossible to prove the original unity. On this, Family and\n\n94\n\nOriginal Constitution of Rome.\n\n[BOOK\n\nI.\n\nand on this alone, rested the distinction between family and clan, or, according to the Roman expression, between agnati and gentiles. Both denoted the male stock ; but the family embraced only those individuals who, mounting up from generation to generation, were able to exhibit the successive steps of their descent from a common progenitor ; the clan (gens) on the other hand comprehended all those, who, while claiming to be descended from a common ancestor, were no longer able fully to point out the intermediate links and thereby to establish the degree of their relationship. This is very clearly expressed in the Roman names : when they speak of \" Quintus, son of Quintus, grandson of Quintus and so on, the Quintian,\" the family reaches as far as the ascendants are designated individually, and where the family terminates the clan is introduced supplementarily, indicating derivation from the common ancestor who has bequeathed to all his descendants the name of the \" children of Quintus.\" To these strictly closed unities—the family or household united under the control of a living master, and of the housethe clan which originated out of the breakinghold ' up of such households—there further belonged the dependents or \" listeners \" (clientes, from cluere), This term denoted not the guests, that is, the members of similar circles who were temporarily sojourning in another household than their own, and still less the slaves who were looked upon in law as the property of the household and not as members of it, but those individuals who, while they were not free burgesses of any commonwealth, yet lived within one in a condition of protected freedom. The class included refugees who had found a reception with a foreign protector, and those slaves in respect to whom their master had for the time being waived the exercise of his rights, and so conferred on them practical freedom. This relation had not properly the character of a relation de jure, like the relation of a man to his guest or to his slave : the client remained- non-free, although good faith and use and wont alleviated in his case the condition of non-freedom. Hence\n\nCHAP,\n\nv.]\n\nOriginal Constitution of Rome.\n\n95\n\nthe \" listeners \" of the household (clientes) together with the slaves strictly so called formed the \" body of servants \" (familia) dependent on the will of the \" b u r g e s s \" (pcitrotins, like patricius). Hence according to original right the burgess was entitled partially 01* wholly to resume the property of the client, to reduce him on emergency once more to the state of slavery, to inflict even capital punishment on him ; and it was simply in virtue of a distinction de facto, that these patrimonial rights were not asserted with the same rigour against the client as against the actual slave, and that on the other hand the moral obligation of the master to provide for his own people and to protect them acquired a greater importance in the case of the client, who was practically in a more free position, than in the case of the slave. Especially must the de facto freedom of the client have approximated to freedom de jure in those cases where the relation had subsisted for several generations : when the releaser and the released had themselves died, the dominium over the descendants of the released person could not be without flagrant impiety claimed by the heirs at law of the releaser ; and thus there was gradually formed within the household itself a class of persons in dependent freedom, who were different alike from the slaves and from the members of the gens entitled in the eye of the law to full and equal rights. On this Roman household was based the Roman state, The Roman as respected both its constituent elements and community. j t g f o r r r l i The community of the Roman people arose out of the junction (in whatever way brought about) of such ancient clanships as the Romilii, Voltinii, Fabii, &e.; the Roman domain comprehended the united lands of those clans (p. 39). Whoever belonged to one of these clans was a burgess of Rome. Every marriage concluded in the usual forms within this circle was valid as a true Roman marriage, and conferred burgess-rights on the children begotten of it. Whoever was begotten in an illegal marriage, or out of marriage, was excluded from the membership of the community. On this account the Ro-\n\n9 6\n\nOriginal Constitution of Rome.\n\n[BOOK\n\nI.\n\nman burgesses assumed the name of the \" fathers' children \" (patrkii), inasmuch as they alone in the eye of the law had a father. The clans with all the families that they contained were incorporated with the state just as they stood. The spheres of the household and the clan continued to subsist within the state; but the position which a man held in these did not affect his relations towards the state. The son was subject to the father within the household, but in political duties and rights he stood on a footing of equality. The position of the protected dependent was naturally so far changed that the freedmen and clients of every patron received on his account toleration in the community at large ; they continued indeed to be immediately dependent on the protection of the family to which they belonged, but the very uature of the case implied that the clients of members of the community could not be wholly excluded from its worship and its festivals, although, of course, they were not capable of the proper rights or liable to the proper duties of burgesses. This remark applies still more to the case of the protected dependents of the community at large. The state thus consisted, like the household, of persons properly belonging to it and of dependents—of \" burgesse s \" and of \" i n m a t e s \" or meloeci. As the clans resting upon a family basis were the conTh k' stituent elements of the state, so the form of the body-politic was modelled after the family both generally and in detail. The household was provided by nature herself with a head in the person of the father with whom it originated, and with whom it perished. But in the community of the people, which was designed to be imperishable, there was no natural master ; not at least in that of Rome, which was composed of free and equal husbandmen and could not boast of a nobility by the grace of God. Accordingly one from its own ranks became its \" leader \" {rex) and \" commander \" (dictator), \" master of the people \" (magister populi) and lord in the household of the Roman community. That this was indeed the true nature of his position is evident, for at a Inter period there\n\nCI:AP.

As the house-master was not simply the greatest but the only power in the house, so the king was not merely the first but the only holder of power in the state. H e might indeed form colleges of men of skill composed of those specially conversant with the rules of sacred or of public law, and call upon them for their advice ; he might, to facilitate his exercise of power, entrust to others particular functions, such as the making communications to the burgesses, the command in war, the decision of processes of minor importance, the inquisition of crimes; he might in particular, if he was compelled to quit the bounds of the city, leave behind him a \" city-warden \" ( p r a e f e c l u s urbi) with the full powers of an alter ego ; but all magisterial power existing by the side of the king's was derived from the latter, and every magistrate held his office by the king's appointment and during the king's pleasure. All the officials of the earliest period, the extraordinary city-warden as well as those who were probably nominated regularly— the \" trackers of foul murder \" (quaestores paricidii), and the \" leaders of division \" (tribuni, from tribus, part) of the infantry (milites) and of the cavalry (celeres)—were mere royal commissioners, and not magistrates in the subsequent sense of the term. The regal power had not and could not have any external checks imposed upon it by law: the master of the community had no judge of his acts within the community, any more than the house-father had a judge within his household. Death alone terminated his p o w e r ; and in view of that event it was, to all appearance, not only his lawful prerogative but probably part of his duty to nominate a successor to himself of his own free choice. A formal co-operation in the election of king was not requisite on the part of the council of elders, and the burgesses only concurred after the nomination; de jure the new king* was * Evidence of a direct nature regarding the constitutional preliminaries of the election of king in Rome is not to be looked for.

This unity of the Roman people, represented in the field of religion by the Roman Diovis, was in the field of law represented by the prince, and therefore his costume was the same as that of the supreme god ; the chariot even in the city, where every one else went on foot, the ivory sceptre with the eagle, the vermilion-painted face, the chaplet of oaken leaves in gold, belonged alike to the Roman god and to the Roman king. It would be a great error, however, to regard the Roman constitution on that account as a theocracy: among the Italians the ideas of god and king never faded away into each other, as they did in E g y p t and the East. The king was not the god of the people ; it were much more correct to designate him as the proprietor of the state. Accordingly the Romans knew nothing of special divine grace granted to a particular family, or of any other sort of mystical charm by which a king should be made of different stuff from other men : noble descent nomination of the dictator took place exactly in the mode here described; the nomination of the consul varied from it only in so far as the succession ia this case had reference of course not to the death of the predecessor but to his retirement, and there was conceded to the community a binding right of proposal and to the senate its correlative right of confirmation —an arrangement which beyond dispute bears the stamp of a later origin—while the nomination itself in the case of the consulate was without exception made by the predecessor in office or the interrex; and, as the consulate and the dictatorship were in substance simply continuations of the regal office, the hypothesis which we h a r e embodied above must be regarded as quite certain. Even according to the traditional accounts the previous election by the curies was admissible merely, but b y no means legally necessary, as the story of Servius Tullius proves. It was probably the custom to make the nomination in public [contione advocata), and the acclamation with which it was received might easily be viewed by later writers in the light of an election.\n\n100\n\nOriginal\n\nConstitution\n\nof Home.\n\n[Boos I\n\nand relationship with earlier rulers were recommendations, b u t w e r e not necessary conditions ; the office m i g h t \"be Lawf u l l y filled b y any R o m a n come to y e a r s of discretion and sound in b o d y and m i n d . * T h e k i n g w a s s i m p l y an ordi nary burgess, w h o m merit or fortune, and the p r i m a r y necessity of having one as master in e v e r y house, had placed as m a s t e r o v e r his e q u a l s — a husbandman set o v e r husbandmen, a w a r r i o r set over warriors.
