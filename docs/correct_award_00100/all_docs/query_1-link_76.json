        "text": "I think the Nobel Prize in Literature is a silly and frivolous thing, basically meaningless at the end of the day but kind of a nice symbolic gesture. But I am fucking mad that Bob Dylan just won the Nobel Prize in Literature. What gives? Why do I care so much about something I care so little about?\n\nThe choice is transgressive, but it is a middle-aged dad’s version of transgression. It is Kevin Spacey buying a muscle car in American Beauty.\n\nI have read articles arguing that Bob Dylan deserved to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, and articles arguing that Bob Dylan did not deserve to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. But let me ask you this — did Karl Adolph Gjellerup deserve to win the Nobel Prize in Literature?\n\nBecause he did. In 1917.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate the degree of obscurity that swamps the vast bulk of Nobel-winning writers. I know I have heard of every winner of a Nobel Prize in Literature, because I have more than a few times read over the whole list of winners. But at the same time, I’ve never heard of most of these people.\n\nThe first winner, in 1901, was Sully Prudhomme. Who is Sully Prudhomme? I have no idea. He was some kind of French poet, I guess?\n\nGuess what Sully Prudhomme did with his Nobel prize money? Well, according to wikipedia, he put it toward “the creation of a poetry prize” in France.\n\nThe next year’s winner: Christian Matthias Theodor Mommsen.\n\nWho?\n\nNext: Bjørnstjerne Martinus Bjørnson.\n\nWho?\n\nAt the time, these must have seemed like the right, the only possible, choices. But 1904 put a kind of a kink in things, because the award was split. There were, for the first but not the last time, two winners: Frédéric Mistral and José Echegaray y Eizaguirre.\n\nIn 1905, of course, we all remember, Henryk Sienkiewicz won, according to the committee, “because of his outstanding merits as an epic writer.” Whatever you say, guys.\n\nIn a non-trivial way, the Nobel Prize in Literature is meant to signal that someone is, and has been, quietly underrated. It’s a way of saying, “Hey, if you dig literature, you should check out this guy or gal who might have flown under your radar.”\n\nBob Dylan hasn’t flown under anyone’s radar in, oh, I don’t know, half a century. If you care about art, you have either engaged with Bob Dylan, or made the at-least-semiconscious decision to ignore Bob Dylan. And that’s fine. But one thing Bob Dylan does not need, and the world does not need, is a Bob Dylan Revival.\n\nRemember when Interpol’s first record came out, and it was great, and people loved it? Ok, but then, remember the people who said to the people who loved Interpol, “But have you listened to Joy Division?” Everybody hated those people. They were annoying and snobbish and they talked down to you when you were just trying to enjoy something earnestly and guiltlessly. But, right or wrong, for better or worse, they took it upon themselves to act as the conscience of history, the angel of better judgment on the shoulder of the public.\n\nThat’s what the Nobel Prize in Literature is supposed to be. It is not noble work (pun not initially intended but not entirely regretted). It is annoying, and condescending, and nobody who hates it is entirely wrong in hating it. But it is a worthwhile counterbalance on the trajectory of culture.\n\nYou can argue about the greatness of Dylan all you want. I myself think that, as a poet, he is supremely overrated by the people who rate him very highly. But thinking the winner is overrated isn’t really the problem, at least not in this case.\n\nYou can’t be critical of Dylan without punching up. Dylan is already part of the pantheon. He’s on the mountain with the rest of the gods. To say Dylan isn’t as great at songwriting as people think he is is in the same ballpark as saying Kant isn’t as great at philosophy as people think he is. Who the fuck are you to say that? Edison wasn’t such a great inventor. Who the fuck are you?\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature is a frivolous lottery, a kind of prestige raffle. If you write enough shit, you are automatically entered, whether you want to be or not. Sure, you can turn down the award, like Sartre, but only after it’s offered to you. You can’t preemptively say, “I would rather not be considered.” What makes it worthwhile, then, insomuch as it is ever worthwhile, is that it drags someone upward, from the swamp of anonymity into “immortality,” which is just shorthand for people who don’t know you thinking well of you because they don’t know better.\n\nYou can’t reach down to pull up Bob Dylan — you can only put your hands on the soles of his feet and push.\n\nAt its best — and excuse me, I know this is sentimental nonsense, but its sentimental nonsense I believe — artistic capital is a kind of protest to the real world of real capital. In the real world of real money, the rich get richer, because that’s just what happens. People invest, and they see returns, and the more they invest, the more they rake in. A certain kind of prestige comes with that, inevitably (see, for instance, our current Republican nominee for President). But the beauty of the aesthetic is that it can explode from nowhere and in an instant saturate our thinking. Lord Byron can write down some rhymes and the next day the world is transformed.\n\nWhen the Nobel Prize in Literature goes to someone who genuinely deserves it, we wake up the next day more curious, more willing to investigate something we weren’t sure about.\n\nHere’s how you can tell the Nobel Prize in Literature has gone to someone who doesn’t deserve it — when he or she doesn’t need it. When it has no public utility. When the writer has already done his or her work. When, for instance, this can be said about him or her, as Luc Sante said in celebrating Dylan’s win: “And Dylan accomplished something that few novelists or poets or for that matter songwriters (pace Joni Mitchell) have managed to do in our era: he changed the time he inhabited. Through words, with music as the fluid of their transmission, he affected the perception, outlook, opinions, ambitions, and assumptions of hundreds of millions of people all over the world.”\n\nThe real genius of the Nobel Prize in literature is that it facilitates this kind of transformative transmission where otherwise it would not have occurred. This isn’t about cultural, or even aesthetic, relativism — it’s about the genius of the unknown. Bob Dylan is already a genius. But Nobel Prize Winner Bob Dylan? I feel less inclined than ever to immerse myself in the world and thoughts and words of such a safe, thoroughly vetted, universally validated artist. I resist him, and resent him, through no fault of his own, because I want a tiny bit of danger with my art.\n\nBob Dylan winning the Nobel is entirely unexpected. It caught me totally off guard. So why, in the retrospect of half a day, does it feel so thoroughly inevitable?"
