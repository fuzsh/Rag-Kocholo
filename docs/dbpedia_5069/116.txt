ORGANIZATION BACKGROUND

Little Pink Houses of Hope is a non-profit organization that serves breast cancer patients and their families propelling families to live stronger, laugh harder and love deeper. The organization provides free week-long vacation retreat experiences for breast cancer patients going through treatment and their families.

The Little Pinkâ€™s programming effectively meets families where they are on their journey and provides support for each family member as well as for the unit as a whole. Little Pink responds to the needs of breast cancer survivors so that they can focus on strengthening their family; by spending quality time as a family unit, by meeting other families in the same health condition, and by creating an ongoing support network. Little Pink provides opportunities for families to de-stress from the rigor of appointments and cancer treatments.

Little Pink is headquartered in Burlington, North Carolina and is governed by a 7-member Board of Directors, comprised of members of the local community.
