        "text": "oOh! Business Manager, Karni Maizels’ letter to her 21-year-old self after being diagnosed with the BRCA1 gene and then with breast cancer, has been published on junkee.com with a potential reach of 2.6 million people online and via social media, and her story will be further amplified across screens in office towers, cafés and other Locate by oOh! assets.\n\nThe campaign, which also includes full-motion digital adverts to urge people to buy Pink Hope lipstick for Bright Pink Lipstick Day, is the result of Pink Hope being named as an official oOh! Community Partner. Pink Hope, a health hub that supports those at risk of breast and ovarian cancer, was selected as a Community partner last year, with oOh! running advertising for the Day last year. Since this time, oOh! has broadcast several campaigns across its digital network, most recently the campaign “Know your Risk”.\n\nThis years’ Bright Pink Lipstick Day campaign will be seen by millions of Australians with the advertising appearing more than 7,000 times since it started at the end of August, including more than 280 shopping centres, 290 office towers, 320 cafés and 21 billboards on major roadways across the country.\n\nPink Hope Founder Krystal Barter said each year Pink Hope sought to be more dynamic and innovative than the previous year’s campaign.\n\n“This year’s no different – we created an exclusive, limited edition range of lipsticks inspired by five women in the Pink Hope community, one of whom is Karni, with 100% of proceeds being channeled back in to our critical lifesaving programs and support services,” Ms Barter said.\n\n“Since the oOh! campaign started we’ve experienced an incredibly strong demand for our lipsticks, well beyond what we had hoped for. There is no better outcome than knowing we have created a campaign that is growing year on year and without oOh!’s support, that may not have been possible.\n\n“Since the start of our partnership, we have experienced a 70 per cent increase in the number of people reaching out to us via social media, email and by phone. oOh! has ensured our organisation’s mission and message reaches every Australian and that is a partnership that not only educates, but saves lives.”"
