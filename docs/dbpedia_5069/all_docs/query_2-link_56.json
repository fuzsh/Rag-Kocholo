        "text": "Pink Hands of Hope has been helping women battling cancer since 2009.\n\nThe founder's wife got breast cancer, and they said there weren't a lot of places that would help get wigs, products, and services at a lower price.\n\nSo the founder decided to do it through thrift store when his friends donated items, and he started selling those items--and that's how he founded a Pink Hands.\n\nThe store caters to women, men, and teens--selling clothing, shoes, and more.\n\nSales help support programs offered by Pink Hands of Hope.\n\nOne of the programs is we called Helping Hands. This is where Pink Hands helps patients battling breast cancer who can't pay their medical bills. Pink Hands says they actually send their medical bills to Pink Hands of Hope, and the shop pays the doctors directly.\n\nVolunteers keep the store running and find their way here through different paths, but the big pink chair out front seems to be a beacon.\n\n\"I've been volunteering a little over a year for Pink Hands of Hope. I kept driving by and seeing that large pink chair and thought, I'm going to go in there,\" says one volunteer.\n\nThe biggest reward for all the volunteers is helping other women.\n\n\"We build a relationship with them so they want to come back and tell us how they're doing and where they're at. Then thereâ€™s other products and services we offer.\"\n\nPink Hands of Hope is on Trindle Road in Mechanicsburg and is open Monday 10am-5pm, Wednesday 10am-7pm, and Saturday 11am-3pm.\n\nJust look for the big pink chair!\n\nIf you're interested in learning more or volunteering to help, click ."
