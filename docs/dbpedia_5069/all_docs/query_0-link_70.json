        "text": "Did you know that today is #BrightPinkLipstickDay? This is one of the major fundraising and awareness days for Pink Hope, an organisation that aims to shine the spotlight on breast and ovarian cancer. I spoke to Pink Hope ambassador and talented Australian actress, Mallory Jansen who along with getting behind this amazing charity has also starred in the biopic INXS: Never Tear Us Apart, Galavant and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Here she speaks about her involvement with the cause, her love of fashion and her fave shade of pink lipstick ever…\n\nWhy did you become involved with Bright Pink Lipstick Day?\n\nI wanted to be involved in a cause that empowers, supports and educates women. That is exactly what Pink Hope aims to achieve through encouraging women to know their health risks and by creating a caring and supportive community.\n\nSadly many of us have been touched in some way by breast or ovarian cancer, whether it be a friend or a family member. My mum has had a number of scares with breast and ovarian cancer over the last few years. Sadly she chose not to tell anybody about what she was going through at the time, as she didn’t want anyone to worry about her. I wish she had spoken out, especially to me as I would have accompanied her to every appointment and procedure. Women need to be more open about their health, especially to friends and family members, as we all need support and encouragement in tough and uncertain times.\n\nWhat does being an ambassador involve?\n\nI think my role predominantly is to spread the word and create awareness about breast and ovarian cancer. The key is to have open discussions with our friends and family about our health. I would recommend every woman to go on the Pink Hope website and use their brilliant assessment tools to determine if they are at risk of developing these types of cancers. Knowing your risk could potentially save your life.\n\nAs today is all about pink lipstick… which one is your favourite?\n\nMAC matte ‘Breathing Fire’.\n\nWhat is your favourite fashion piece?\n\nThe trench! One of my favourite pieces in my wardrobe is a navy silk Marc Jacobs trench that I bought about six years ago…..If only I got more use out of it in LA?!\n\nWho do you follow on Instagram?\n\nIt’s a mixed bag really. I follow a lot of women in comedy who I admire, such as Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Amy Schumer and Chelsea Handler. Food is a big part of my life so I follow my favourite LA eateries like Salt & Straw ice cream, Bestia restaurant and Petty Cash Taqueria. In terms of fashion, I’m obsessed with Olivia Palermo, Alexa Chung and I drool over everything on Toni Maticevski’s page.\n\nWhat is your most played song ever?\n\n‘Africa’ by Toto is one of my all time favourite songs, I’ve played it literally HUNDREDS of times. However more recently I’ve had ‘Flawless’ by Queen B [Beyonce] on repeat.\n\nWhere is your favourite travel destination?\n\nItaly, without a doubt! I love everything about that country, the culture, the people, the arts, the history, the beaches, the food…oh good lord the FOOD!\n\nWhat is your favourite food?\n\nPepperoni pizza.\n\nWhat is your top fashion trick?\n\nWell, I don’t know if you would call it a trick, but I never wear super high heels. I just end up uncomfortable and miserable. I stick to the low pump, it’s a few inches shorter, but I’m guaranteed a good night.\n\nWhat was your most recent clothing purchase?\n\nReformation ‘Parisa’ dress, it’s been my LA summer staple.\n\nWhat is your favourite drink to order at a cafe?\n\nA shot of espresso."
