I recently became aware of a payment for our car insurance and a car payment, but I didn’t know who made these payments. Today (I found out) it was from you. Besides all my unexpected medical bills, I lost my job . . . These bills being paid has lifted my spirits tremendously.”\n\nCheck out our segment on Caffeinated Conversations with Brooke Allen, featuring our President Mary Pat Meyers\n\nDid You Know\n\nEach year more than 8,000 Michigan residents are diagnosed with breast cancer. Of those diagnosed:\n\n3,200 will face significant difficulty paying healthcare costs.\n\n2,640 will have problems affording necessary cancer medications, forcing 1,840 patients to cut pills in half or skip doses.\n\n2,000 will use up all of their personal savings for medical bills and 800 will be forced to file for bankruptcy.\n\n1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime.\n\nBreast cancer treatment is one of the most expensive of all cancers.\n\nIt carries the highest out-of-pocket costs ($3.14 billion) and greatest financial impact of all cancers.\n\nAbout 50% of breast cancer patients face financial hardship as a result of their diagnosis, including those with insurance.\n\nWhen you support Shades of Pink Foundation you’re supporting individuals and families in your community…\n\nWe serve Michigan residents only; in recent years we have expanded our client base from the tri-county area to nine counties in Southeast Michigan.\n\nWe have longevity and stability; We were founded 19 years ago and have distributed over $2.5 million in financial support.\n\nOur grants cover the everyday living expenses that aren't covered by most other support organizations.\n\nGrant applications are reviewed and approved promptly and creditors are paid directly.\n\nWhat’s Happening"
