Nutrition is an important aspect of everyone's lifestyle, not least of which those who have been impacted by breast cancer. Food With Strength is a family owned business and we love the closeness of the Going Beyond the Pink community. Together Going Beyond the Pink and Food With Strength can make a meaningful difference in the breast cancer community. We are honored to be a part of this cause.”-Ryan and Susannah Leach, Registered Dietitian Nutritionists, Food with Strength\n\nBodies in Balance\n\n“We are so happy and lucky to have Going Beyond the Pink (GBTP) as a resource! At Bodies in Balance, for 13 years we have been treating patients who have a breast cancer history. Treating those who have side effects from cancer treatments can be challenging at times, and GBTP has helped so many of our patients by helping overcome barriers to getting the best health care. Obtaining medical devices/equipment or high cost sharing from insurance companies are common obstacles for many of our patients. GBTP has been a great partner working through these barriers and helping these patients have the best tools for caring for themselves and improving their quality of life. THANKS GBTP!”-Beth Connell and Michelle DuPree Zumbro, Owners, Bodies in Balance\n\nFleet Feet\n\n“As a locally owned business and someone whose family has been impacted by breast cancer, I, and Fleet Feet, look to support organizations that work in our area to make the Cape Fear community a better place, and work with causes dear and near to our hearts. GBTP does just that as it helps those going through the fight with breast cancer and their support circle vital in helping in the battle with breast cancer.”-Michelle Fogle, Owner, Fleet Feet\n\nAudrey Salzman, Matt Skelly Training\n\n“I am thrilled to partner with Going Beyond the Pink! It is an organization that I feel very strongly about! I am a personal trainer and it is so important to me to help people create a healthy lifestyle and feel good about themselves. Going Beyond the Pink does just that. The care that this organization gives to women and men is unbelievable. Going Beyond the Pink offers so many opportunities and resources to women and men who are going through breast cancer. They also are a family for life even after someone has gone through such a hard situation. This organization is there for its participants both physically and emotionally. I am so proud to partner with GBTP and do what I can to help its \"family\" members. Anything that can be done to make people feel more comfortable is what GBTP does and I am amazed at what they do! This is an important organization that has a heart of gold!”-Audrey Salzman, Personal Trainer, Matt Skelly Training\n\nClary Hollow\n\nI've had ongoing breast health issues since I was in my 20's. Most recently I had to get 2 biopsies done after an abnormal mammogram. There are so many feelings happening while waiting for the results but a recurring thought I had was where do I turn next if these come back cancerous? I wouldn't even know where to start. It was shortly after that I started working with Going Beyond the Pink. I realized that these amazing people would have been part of my support system if my results would have come back differently and they are exactly the type of people I'd want in my corner. Their passion for what they do and the genuine support and compassion they give the breast cancer community is truly amazing. I decided to donate a portion of my sales to them because I want to use my platform to help them keep doing the good they're doing.\n\n-Elaine Riley, Owner"
