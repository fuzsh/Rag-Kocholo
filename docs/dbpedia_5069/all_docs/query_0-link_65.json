        "text": "Scholarship for Graduating Seniors\n\nThe Little Pink Houses of Hope Scholarship is for the children of parents or guardians who have attended any Little Pink Houses of Hope retreat. The applicant needs not to have attended a retreat to be eligible for the scholarship. Recipients will be selected based on a number of criteria, including a personal essay, resume, and high school GPA, but there is no minimum GPA requirement. Financial need is not a criterion for the scholarship. The scholarship is for use at accredited two or four-year colleges and universities based in the United States of America. The scholarship is for one year. Upon receiving the scholarship, additional information may be requested of the recipient. Recipients will have scholarship funds mailed directly to their institution of higher learning.\n\nChildren of Hope Scholarship Application\n\nEach year Little Pink serves more than 200 families and 750 individuals through its signature retreat model. And we are aiming even higher in our goal to support families coping with a breast cancer challenge. Little Pink has more than 350 alumni with children who will be college-ready this year and the number is growing as we expand. This includes our living alumni and those who have passed and now have college-age children who may have put off college due to family hardship. Please join Little Pink in supporting breast cancer survivors and their families with a donation to the Children of Hope Scholarship Fund.\n\nScholarship Donation\n\n2023 Scholarship Winners\n\nGrace Baer – University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh\n\nNoah Buscher – The Ohio State University\n\nAndrew Edick – Michigan Technological University\n\nRiley Lavinder – Central Piedmont Community College\n\nAidan Minute– University of Missouri, Columbia\n\n2022 Scholarship Winners\n\nRyan Farrar – University of Pittsburgh\n\nMolly Maher – Boston College\n\nAmelia Mayle – California State University, Chico\n\nBrextan Tinnell – University of Kentucky\n\n2021 Scholarship Winners\n\nAlexandra Stampfl– University of Massachusetts- Amherst\n\nGarrett Diegnan– Northeastern University\n\nMary Kate Haasz– Virginia Commonwealth University\n\nRegan Lavinder– UNC- Wilmington\n\n2020 Scholarship Winners\n\nIsabella Robb– University of Nebraska- Lincoln\n\nKara Sipe – Campbell University\n\n2019 Scholarship Winners (click on recipient name to read their essay)\n\nEmma Remonsellez-Conde– University of South Florida\n\nMarcus Rivera– Allen Hancock College, CA\n\nAdalyn LaHue- Iowa State University\n\nGlenn Hubbard– Penn State University\n\nChloe Allen– North Carolina State University\n\nZoe Bartholomew– Utica College, NY\n\nAbigail Schlueter– University of Illinois\n\n2018 Scholarship Winners (click on recipient name to read their essay)"
