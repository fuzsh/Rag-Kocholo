We provide evidence-based information to help break the cycle of cancer in Australian families and encourage conversations that save lives.\n\nWe empower people to take charge of their own health by assessing, understanding, and reducing their risk of cancer. And we offer support every step of the way.\n\nOur Mission\n\nWe want to empower all Australians to understand and act upon hereditary cancer risk by educating them about their health history, providing them with evidence-based resources and connecting them to a supportive, nurturing community.\n\nWe work collaboratively with healthcare providers to ensure a better transition for at-risk people as they move through each stage of their journey. We promote open discussion around family health history in Australia through targeted campaigns and education. We also advocate for those at risk of cancer and their families with the aim of earlier diagnoses, risk reduction, and better treatment options."
