        "text": "Calendar of Cancer Awareness Months\n\nWelcome to Choose Hope’s Cancer Awareness Months Calendar. At Choose\n\nHope we are dedicated to bringing you all information to help build awareness\n\nsurrounding the various types of cancer.\n\nCancer Awareness Months\n\nFEBRUARY\n\nFebruary is Gallbladder and Bile Duct Cancer Awareness Month. February is also National Cancer Prevention Month.\n\nJUNE\n\nJune is National Cancer Survivor Month.\n\nOCTOBER\n\nOctober is Breast Cancer and Liver Cancer Awareness Month.\n\nNOVEMBER\n\nNovember is Pancreatic Cancer, Lung Cancer, Stomach Cance, and Carcinoid Cancer Awareness Month.
