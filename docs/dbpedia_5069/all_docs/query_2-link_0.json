        "text": "Our Mission\n\nWe want to empower all Australians to understand and act upon hereditary cancer risk by educating them about their health history, providing them with evidence-based resources and connecting them to a supportive, nurturing community.\n\nWe work collaboratively with healthcare providers to ensure a better transition for at-risk people as they move through each stage of their journey. We promote open discussion around family health history in Australia through targeted campaigns and education. We also advocate for those at risk of cancer and their families with the aim of earlier diagnoses, risk reduction, and better treatment options.\n\nHow it All Began\n\nPink Hope was founded by Krystal Barter, a women’s health activist, speaker and author, who was inspired by her own family’s experience with cancer. Krystal’s family had a history of cancer due to a BRCA1 gene fault (the same one made famous by Angelina Jolie), which predisposes the carrier to a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. As a result, in 2009, at only 25 and with a husband and young family, Krystal made the difficult decision to break the cycle of cancer in her family by having a preventative double mastectomy. Her experience taught her that there was no support system available for at-risk women, and so she started Pink Hope. In 2014, when she was 31, Krystal took the next step in her BRCA journey and had her fallopian tubes and one ovary removed to reduce her risk of ovarian cancer."
