Hope Chest for Breast Cancer Foundation fills an urgent, unmet need: Alleviating some of the financial burdens associated with breast cancer treatment. While patients focus on the fight of their lives, we focus on helping Minnesota breast cancer patients stay in their homes, keep the heat and lights on, and put nutritious food in the fridge. We help make sure that patients can get access to transportation and child care so they can attend treatments.\n\n*This image does not depict the testimonial attestant.\n\nFeelings of gratitude to you all for your very kind and generous support during this extremely challenging time in my life journey.\n\nYour payment of my rent not only lifts my spirits but brings hope and healing in a way that’s difficult to describe.\n\nSuzanne"
