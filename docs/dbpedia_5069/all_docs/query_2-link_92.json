        "text": "Often breweries using the Pink Boots Collaboration Brew Day® logo without permission are confused about the need to officially register for this annual celebration. They may have purchased the Pink Boots Hop Blend and incorrectly assumed that they were authorized to promote beer sales using our trademarked logos. Most just need a friendly conversation and reminder that they need to register in order to participate in this fundraiser.\n\nIf you notice a brewery continuing to use our trademarked logos without an official registration, please contact Pink Boots staff and we will communicate our trademark policy with them.\n\nDonation amounts are at the discretion of each registered brewery. Donations often vary based on the ingredients donated, labor contributed, the size of brew, or other factors. Participating teams can choose to donate either a flat rate or per barrel/pint.\n\nFlat Donations: Most breweries prefer to designate a flat rate to remove any guesswork or tracking efforts.\n\nOR\n\nPer Barrel or Per Pint: Teams that chose to donate based on barrel or pint produced typically donate between $50 and $250 per bbl.\n\nMore information on ways to donate is HERE. Invoices can be generated upon request.\n\nWhile separate actions, Pink Boots Collaboration Brew Day® (CBD) and the Pink Boots Hop Blend go hand-in-hand as both raise funds to support Pink Boots scholarships and our mission.\n\nBy registering for Pink Boots Collaboration Brew Day®, a brewery/team commits to organizing and gathering a group around the brewhouse to brew beer. The participating brewery/team also commits to donating a portion of the proceeds from the sale of their beer to Pink Boots Society. This donation can support their local Chapter and funds a variety of educational activities and scholarships for women and non-binary individuals in the fermented/alcoholic beverage industry.\n\nBy purchasing the Pink Boots Hop Blend, The Pink Boots Hop Blend is a community blend formulated by Pink Boots Society members through a hop rub event sponsored by our partner, Yakima Chief Hops (YCH). Purchasing the Pink Boots Hop Blend also assist Pink Boots Society in our fundraising efforts. YCH produces T-90 pellets and donates $3.00 per pound to Pink Boots Society National Chapter to fund scholarships and offset administrative fees. Any brewery or homebrewer with a YCH account can purchase this unique Hop Blend HERE and brew with it just as they would any other hop. There is no commitment to participate in the official Collaboration Brew Day or directly donate funds to Pink Boots Society if you simply buy the Pink Boots Hop Blend.\n\nIn order to use the official Pink Boots Collaboration Brew Day® logo, our CBD promotional tools and images, or any other Pink Boots intellectual property to promote the beer you brewed with our hop blend, however, you must officially register to participate in Collaboration Brew Day. You are not automatically registered to participate in Collaboration Brew Day when you purchase the Pink Boots Hop Blend.\n\nYou can hold your team’s brew day on any day of the year!\n\nThe official date for Pink Boots Collaboration Brew Day® aligns with the annual celebration of International Women’s Day on March 8. While many teams plan their brew day around International Women’s Day to celebrate along with our wider society, registered teams can hold their brew day on any day of the year! We’re so glad to keep the momentum and spirit of collaboration going year-round.\n\nWe hope Pink Boots members and supporters can view the participating brewery map and find opportunities throughout the year to celebrate brew days within their chapters, regions, or scholarship cohort groups.\n\nBrewers are encouraged to use our annual Pink Boots Hop Blend. These blends are curated by Pink Boots members, Chapters, and Yakima Chief Hops with the final blend selection typically taking place at the Great American Beer Festival. The blend is distributed by Country Malt Group. We sell our limited annual blend until supplies run out!\n\nThis year, our official 7th Annual Pink Boots Hop Blend, features HBC 638, El Dorado®, Ahtanum®, and Idaho 7®. Brewers can expect berry and citrus punctuated with peppery earthiness and floral notes.\n\nSpot order the 7th Annual Blend!\n\nYakima Chief Hops generously donates $3 per pound directly back to Pink Boots Society. These funds are used to support our scholarship program and support the Pink Boots mission to assist, inspire, and encourage women and non-binary individuals in the fermented/alcoholic beverage industry through education.\n\nMaterials to help you plan a successful brew day:\n\nThis CBD page has process information, our brand guide, a brew day checklist, and the Pink Boots Impact Statement to help you understand, promote, and share brew day information with your team, chapter, and brewery.\n\nOnce your team registers, the person owning the email you registered under will receive a full CBD toolkit of resources to help you plan and promote your brew day, including the official CBD logo, social media templates, and promotional tips.\n\nInformation on the Pink Boots Blend:\n\nYou can find helpful information on the annual Pink Boots blend here. This also links to their media kit and order form.\n\nPink Boots Society gear and our official Collaboration Brew Day t-shirt:\n\nYou can find a variety of Pink Boots branded merch and our official CBD t-shirts in our store.\n\nNews about how and when to order the official CBD shirt will go out to all members and registered teams in emails leading up to our celebration on International Women’s Day in March. Keep your eyes out for these emails from Pink Boots, containing valuable tips and trips as you solidify your brew day plans.\n\nPurchasing Pink Boots Blend does not give a brewery or individual the right to use the Pink Boots Society logo or Collaboration Brew Day® logo in any of their marketing or promotion. In order to have the right to use the Collaboration Brew Day® logo, a brewery must register for Collaboration Brew Day®. All registered breweries are listed on this map. Please follow all requirements in the Pink Boots Society Collaboration Brew Day® User Guide."
