A portion of sales from these products support a diversity of initiatives and programs that help improve access to care, prevention, and education for cancer patients.\n\nNow in its th year, the Henry Schein Practice Pink program has donated more than $1.9 million for the fight against breast cancer and all cancers through the Henry Schein Cares Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization that supports and promotes increased access to care globally.\n\nOrganizations receiving support through the Practice Pink sales promotion include the American Cancer Society, Cohen Children's Medical Center of Northwell Health, and Stony Brook Children's Hospital.\n\nAs part of the Henry Schein Practice Pink program, Team Schein Members at multiple company locations wear pink on selected days during October. In addition, Team Schein Members donate their own funds, with matching funds provided by the company.\n\nIn addition to its monetary donations, Henry Schein also provides in-kind support to cancer-related organizations, including the donation of Henry Schein Cares Welcome Kits to the ACS's Hope Lodge, a network of free temporary housing services throughout the country for cancer patients and their loved ones."
