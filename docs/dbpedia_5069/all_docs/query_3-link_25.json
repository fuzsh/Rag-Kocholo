        "text": "In 2003, Howard County’s Office of Tourism & Promotion proposed a tree planting program with Kwanzan cherry trees that would beautify the county’s attractions, its parks, and its roadways. The project was inspired by Washington D.C.’s annual Tidal Basin spectacular and was designed to capitalize on the blossom-mania that descends each year in the neighboring Capital. The goal was 1,000 cherry trees in the ground at select locations in five years which was reached within two years.\n\nEqually important as beautification was the hope to give back to the community in a meaningful way. It was decided that the trees would be used to raise awareness of breast cancer prevention each spring and to raise money to benefit those within the community coping with cancer and facing other life-changing experiences.\n\nThe concept was taken to former Howard County Executive Jim Robey who agreed to champion the project and also provide resources from within both the Department of Recreation & Parks and The Department of Public Works to kick start the initiative on public lands. And thus, Blossoms of Hope… the Howard County Cherry Tree Project began. In addition, the county gave Tourism $75,000 a year earmarked for Blossoms of Hope.\n\nIn 2004, a handful of individuals stepped forward to make the dream of Blossoms of Hope a reality. The Founders Grove, located in Centennial Park was the first planting of 20 trees. 19 years later, approximately 2,900 Blossoms of Hope trees are now blossoming across Howard County, and more than $750,000 has been contributed to the community, with the majority going to the Johns Hopkins Howard County Medical Center earmarked for Claudia Mayer/Tina Broccolino Cancer Resource Center. Over the years, other organizations have been recipients of BOH’s donations, but the board has agreed to always give at least $30,000 to the Cancer Resource Center.\n\nIn its early years, there were many community events that took place in parks, at Columbia’s lakefront, and in Old Ellicott City. One such event was the Lanterns of Hope Parade held in Centennial Park in its first year and then at Columbia’s lakefront in following years. Lanterns were made by people in the community and children at the public library. Community organizations and companies also participated in what became April’s Cherrybration Days, including Clark’s Elioak Farm, Terrapin Adventures, restaurants through Pink Plates (similar to restaurant week), and more. BOH also participated in the Cherry Blossom parade in Washington, D.C. and formed a friendship with the Japanese Embassy.\n\nFundraising events have been added over the years to help raise funds to sustain itself and to distribute to the community, including Power of the Purse; Pretty in Pink (a Turf Valley Resort event benefiting BOH); Beer, Bourbon and Bags; and Pink Greens. Blossoms of Hope also has responded quickly to unique community needs. In 2018, in just three weeks, Blossoms of Hope sponsored a gala raising more than $24,000 for Ellicott City flood victims. In 2020, due to COVID-19, the Scavenger Hunt and The Santa Project (TSP) were founded. TSP saw Santa and his elves visiting the homes of more than 2,300 children in Howard County and the surrounding area in its first year.\n\nSame Name But a New Entity\n\nAt the start of 2014, it was brought to the attention of the Blossoms of Hope board that BOH was not in compliance with its 501(c)(3) designation. Howard County’s Office of Tourism & Promotion, a 501(c)(6), could not have a 501(c)(3) within its organization. The choice was to become a separate entity or to lose the nonprofit designation and become a Tourism program. The Blossoms of Hope board, after several months of discussion, decided to separate from the Office of Tourism and try to make it on its own. However, the county agreed to fund BOH for three years with a reduced amount each year ending with $35,000 in the third year. The funds were funneled through the Office of Tourism but earmarked for Blossoms of Hope. From that point, BOH has considered the Office of Tourism as its “parent” and has continued to work with Tourism (now called Visit Howard County) with a ex-officio seat on the board held for a Tourism representative.\n\nA transition team was formed consisting of: Joe Barbera, Pete Mangione, Becky Mangus, Mimi O’Donnell, Rachelina Bonacci, Michelle Healy, and Anne Towne who created the documents and structure needed for the new organization. That was completed the first quarter of 2014.\n\nIn the spring of 2014, in a room in the basement of Turf Valley Resort, the Blossoms’ executive board including Pete Mangione and Becky Mangus discussed who would be chair of the board. Joe Barbera’s name was brought up and all agreed he would be the perfect choice. Joe had been chair of the Office of Tourism, had been on the Blossoms’ board for two years, and served as chair of the transition team. Becky had his phone number in her contact list and called him on the spot. Putting him on speaker, he was asked if he would be the Blossoms of Hope’s board chair and after a stutter or two, he said “yes.”\n\nShaping an Organization\n\nFor the next three years, the board spent a good amount of time working on the organization itself including the mission, the look of the programs, and the staff and board. Since that time, sponsorships and events have replaced the county’s funding. Programs have expanded from only taking place in April to happening year-round. Donations are distributed to more organizations than the Cancer Resource Center (with funding still being earmarked for the Center each year).\n\nIn 2016, the board held a retreat to strategize board structure and recruitment, causes, and redefine the mission statement, changing the words “support for The Claudia Mayer/Tina Broccolino Cancer Resource Center” to “support for our community; cancer-related and other causes.” This broadened Blossoms’ reach in the community and in 2022, pillars were created representing areas we support.\n\nThe logo was updated in 2019 and the website was redesigned in 2021. Blossoms of Hope and The Santa Project were trademarked in May 2021. Beginning in 2022, programming was expanded to include 3700 Blossoms by 2025, Seeds of Hope, and plans for two countywide art shows in 2024 and 2025 with “pink blossoms” as the theme."
