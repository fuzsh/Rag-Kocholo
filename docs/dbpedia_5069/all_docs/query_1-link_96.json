        "text": "LAGRANGE — Lafayette Square in LaGrange will be awash in a sea of pink on Saturday, Sept. 24, as the medical community, breast cancer patients and survivors, caregivers and supporters rally together for the 11th annual Paint The Town Pink and the H.O.P.E. for a Day Walk.\n\nThe awareness and fundraising event is spearheaded by the Enoch Callaway Cancer Center, WellStar West Georgia Medical Center, the Breast Friends for Life breast cancer support group and H.O.P.E. for a Day Inc. Other sponsors include the West Central Georgia Cancer Coalition and District 4 Public Health.\n\nThis year’s Paint the Town Pink event will be held from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. Paint the Town Pink and the 10-mile HOPE walk are traditionally held the last Saturday of September to kick off October as Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The walk begins at 8 a.m. and ends at 12:30 p.m. on the square.\n\nFunds raised through the event directly benefit breast cancer patients who live in Troup and surrounding counties who may need mammograms as well as assistance with transportation, household expenses, and other financial burdens they may face during their treatment period. The funds also provide educational books on breast cancer treatment and scholarships.\n\nPaint the Town Pink not only educates women on breast cancer but also provides the community education and awareness on a variety of women’s health issues. It offers free clinical breast exams, and some women who receive the breast exam may qualify for a voucher for a free mammogram at WGMC’s Women’s Health Center.\n\nThe event will feature 25 to 30 booths that offer information on prevention and awareness.\n\nDr. Tonya Echols Cole, an Atlanta-area radiation oncologist and breast cancer survivor, will be the keynote speaker.\n\nAs a physician, Echols Cole has treated cancer patients for 20 years and opened her practice in 2004.\n\nCombining her medical expertise and her experience as a breast cancer survivor, Echols Cole enjoys giving talks on breast cancer screening and prevention, radiation treatment and overcoming obstacles.\n\nEchols Cole is the founder of The Beauty of Cancer Foundation and author of the blog, beautyofcancer.com.\n\n“Cancer was just my business, until it became my diagnosis,” she said. “My mission is to show you the ‘real’ beauty of cancer. I want to change the perception of what a cancer diagnosis really means.”\n\nPaint The Town Pink also will include performances by local groups Teen Trio, Stars and Stripes Twirlers, Celtic Traditions School of Irish Dance and the Royal Academy of Irish Dance. In addition, a raffle drawing will be held for a handmade quilt by Sew ‘N Sews and other prizes.\n\nMore information is available by calling 706-812-2191 or visiting wellstar.org/wgmc."
