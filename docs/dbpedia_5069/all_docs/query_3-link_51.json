        "text": "At Manly Eagles, fostering community goes beyond the boundaries of the baseball field.\n\nThere is a power in uniting players, supporters and the broader community in support of causes that matter. Since 2017/2018 Manly Eagles Baseball (MEB) has aligned its Ladies Day celebration with the Pink Hope Charity. Manly Eagles proudly sponsors Pink Hope, who are a breast (and other hereditary) cancer group dedicated to raising awareness and providing support for those affected by the disease.\n\nManly are extremely excited to welcome everyone back to Aquatic Reserve this weekend – Saturday 10th February – for the Pink Hope Ladies Day. Ladies’ Day is a focus and celebration of women in sport and it is Manly Eagles’ goal to encourage women’s participation and provide support to that goal where possible.\n\nThe day will include lots of baseball, plenty of great food and drink available from the canteen all day (including the famous chicken schnitzel burgers!) as well as free champagne, orange juice and nibbles for all ladies from 12.00PM noon. There will be both Manly Eagles and Pink Hope merchandise for sale, and lots of great raffle prizes.\n\nThe collaboration of Ladies Day and Pink Hope provides an opportunity to run several donation driven activities to raise funds for Pink Hope. Over the last 5 years MEB has raised in excess of $13,000 in donations and supporters gear sales all aiding in the financial support of Pink Hope.\n\nThis year, they hope to continue this support and success. Fundraising for Pink Hope will be running this weekend, Friday the 9th and Saturday 10th. The Women’s League game will be played on Friday night against Blacktown Workers and State League on Saturday against Canterbury Vikings.\n\nThe Official Opening is planned for 5.00pm on Saturday 10th February (prior to the 1st Grade game) at Aquatic Baseball Reserve. They can’t wait to see everyone out there celebrating for a good cause!"
