        "text": "From the moment I was conceived, I was destined to get cancer.\n\nMy parents didn't know it at the time. My family carries the BRCA1 gene fault. More than 20 women in my family have been diagnosed with breast and ovarian cancer. We called it the \"family curse\" before we knew what was causing our family's cancer.\n\nMy mum raised me to be a bold and informed woman, so when I was offered genetic testing after my first-born son, I said yes.\n\nI was only 23 and not truly ready for what this knowledge had in store for me.\n\nI decided to have my breasts surgically removed rather than face the risk of breast cancer. I was 25 and this was way before Angelina Jolie.\n\nI later had my fallopian tubes and ovary removed at 31. Laying in my hospital bed, I decided to change preventative health in Australia. I wanted women and families to know their risk and change their future. I created Pink Hope, an organisation built around this mission.\n\nDenied or overcharged\n\nAt the time of my gene testing, genetic counsellors told me about insurance discrimination. I remembered my mum purchasing a health and life insurance policy for me when I was 20. At the time I'd thought that was odd, but now I knew why she did it.\n\nRunning Pink Hope, I watch men and women experience bias every day because of their genetic history and makeup. I really didn't understand how rampant this discrimination was until I created the organisation.\n\nTake for instance Lisa, a young mum in her 30s with two children. Lisa is BRCA mutation positive. Denied insurance.\n\nJames, who is a father of three, carries the gene mutation but has not had cancer. He was offered insurance but at a much higher premium. It was unaffordable in his situation.\n\nTake Sue, who doesn't have a known gene mutation but after many cases of cancer in her family, had preventative surgeries to reduce her risk. Her insurance company will not reduce her inflated premium even after her surgeries. This is despite the fact she is now at lower risk than most Aussie women.\n\nThese stories we hear everyday. Denied insurance. Premiums so high they are unaffordable.\n\nAn industry mindset\n\nI myself have faced the discrimination of the industry. I remember being at a large corporate event just after my breasts were removed. I was discussing my experience with a few people in the insurance industry.\n\nOne said:\n\nWell, I wasn't a horse and I did everything I could to reduce my risk.\n\nActually, I had a lower risk than most women in the room we were standing in.\n\nThat conversation framed my understanding of what the industry thought of us, and the stories I hear validate that.\n\nLagging behind the science\n\nEven if a woman at higher risk reduces her risk with preventative surgeries, she will still be charged more, or denied altogether.\n\nThe insurance industry is not keeping up with modern scientific advances. Genetics is the future and we need to be prepared for it.\n\nThe government needs to ensure families like mine are not discriminated against. We fall behind in this area on the international stage.\n\nI have three beautiful children and my dream is they receive the same opportunities as every Australian. Because we ALL have gene mutations - my family just knows ours.\n\nGenetic testing needs to become more mainstream.\n\nThe changes we make now will greatly affect our future generations."
