        "text": "We can use all the help we can get in the fight against breast cancer. Helping can take the form of donations, but there are plenty of other ways you can express your support.\n\nAre you affected by breast cancer yourself or do you know someone who has (had) breast cancer, and would you like to do something against the disease? You can easily do so by setting up your own action page. This way, you can raise money for Pink Ribbon's projects.\n\nLet your heart speak in the fight against breast cancer! Set up your own action page and help Pink Ribbon. Large or small-scale, alone or with others, your initiative makes a difference. Unleash your creativity and organise an action with friends, family, colleagues or neighbours.\n\nMotivate your friends, family or colleagues and try to move more daily throughout October in the fight against breast cancer. New this edition is the competition between the 10 provinces and Brussels in Belgium. Sign up quickly and put the other provinces offside.\n\n100,000 courageous women are currently fighting breast cancer in Belgium. About 10,500 patients get diagnosed every year in this country. That means 29 new diagnoses a day. 1 in 9 women will develop breast cancer over the course of a lifetime. This makes breast cancer the most common form of cancer in both younger and older women.\n\nIt means a lot to Pink Ribbon that people want to join our fight against breast cancer. We use the money collected from the donations and events for various specific projects.\n\nFor example, we support Belgian drop-in centres that offer professional support to cancer patients during and after treatment.\n\nOur “Geknipt voor haar”/“Coupe de coeur” initiative offers financial help for the purchase of a wig and funds scalp cooling systems for Belgian hospitals to limit hair loss.\n\nWe train walking coaches who help patients and other breast buddies get enough exercise.\n\nThe Mammoquiz aims to inform both men and women about breasts, breast cancer and the 9 warning signs of the disease.\n\nWe support various studies by the Belgian Cancer Registry to improve the quality of (cancer) care in this country.\n\nThe Family Hope project lets young women know how they can have children when living with breast cancer.\n\nOur annual magazine provides information and raises awareness, and patients can find each other on our website and social media.\n\nSo many more great projects are waiting for your support."
