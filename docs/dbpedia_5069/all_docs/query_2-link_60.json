These groups will be on the second Monday evening of every month.\n\nThe group will be from 6:00-7:00, but someone will be there as early as 5:30 to greet you. So, we encourage caregivers to come grab a drink and/or some food, and get acquainted before the group begins at 6:00pm.\n\nWarriors, if you want to accompany your caregiver to Canteen that is wonderful, however the group portion itself will be limited to caregivers only to give them their own space in which to share and support one another.\n\nPlease spread the word, and share with the caregivers in your life. Let‚Äôs help support our caregivers the way they love and support us each and every day! üíï\n\nPink Warrior House, Lovelace Embrace and the Young Survival Coalition co-host this monthly gathering.\n\nWe hope you can join us, as this is a chance to meet other young women who have been through similar diagnosis, treatment and life changes.\n\nGoing through Breast Cancer is difficult at any age, but going through it at a younger age presents some unique challenges.

We are hoping to keep growing this group so please encourage your friends and family to come along, just be sure to include them in your RSVP when you register.\n\nAs with all PWH classes, groups and workshops, this is a free event to anyone personally impacted by breast cancer, and their caregivers/loved ones.\n\nWe can‚Äôt wait to see you on August 23rd for DANCING! üíï\n\nYin Yoga Salt Cave Yoga & Sound Bath.\n\nThe Salt Cave provides an immersive self-care and wellness experience where you can enjoy a variety of services including dry salt therapy in a large salt cave!\n\nThis is a 60-minute yoga session in the salt cave, with Allison Hendricks-Smith as instructor.\n\nThis session is limited to 13 breast cancer thrivers.\n\nWe anticipate that this class will end up on a waitlist.\n\nIf all 13 spots are taken, and you are interested in being added to the waitlist, please reach out to Allison.\n\nWe are paying for each individual slot, so that this can be a free program through PWH. So, if you commit to a space, and are unable to attend, please remove yourself from the RSVP, so that someone from the waitlist may attend accordingly.\n\nYin Restorative Yoga allows for the body to slow down, relax, and turn inward which helps alleviate stress and restore the body‚Äôs energy levels, while improving flexibility, boosting circulation, and reduces tension. The Salt Cave will help alleviate stress and anxiety as well. It provides a relaxing environment with a tranquil atmosphere, making it the perfect haven for mindfulness.\n\nWhile ‚Äúyang‚Äù yoga focuses on your muscles, yin yoga targets your deep connective tissues, like your fascia, ligaments, and joints. It‚Äôs slower and more meditative, giving you space to turn inward and tune into both your mind and the physical sensations of your body. Because you‚Äôre holding poses for a longer period of time than you would in other traditional types of yoga, yin yoga helps you stretch and lengthen those rarely used tissues while also teaching you how to breathe through discomfort and sit with your thoughts.\n\nWe hope to see you on August 24th! üíï\n\nThis is a wonderful opportunity for all of our Warriors navigating the challenges of life on the other side of active treatment. Those navigating their ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù as NED (no evidence of disease) have an opportunity to get together and discuss the mental and emotional challenges that come after chemo, radiation, and/or surgery.\n\nThis group will be IN-PERSON ONLY on the last Wednesday of each month.\n\nWe hope to see you in-person on August 28th! üíï\n\nFor this month‚Äôs art therapy activity, we will be working on creating Towers of Self-Esteem. While this exercise focuses on self-esteem, it can also be used as a way to explore your current strengths and abilities as a foundation to building confidence in all areas of your life!\n\nThis group will be peer hosted by Allison Hendricks-Smith, LMHC, Master‚Äôs in Art Therapy/Counseling, and breast cancer survivor.\n\nNo creative experience is required, and as with all Pink Warrior House offerings, this group is open to anyone personally impacted by breast cancer.\n\nPlease see the artwork in the invitation for an example of our upcoming activity.\n\nThis is an in-person only workshop, and all materials will be provided.\n\nWe hope to see you at Pink Warrior House! üíï"
