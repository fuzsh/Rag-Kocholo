        "text": "Pink Hope is a preventative health organisation working to ensure every individual can assess, manage and reduce their risk of breast and ovarian cancer, while providing personalised support for at risk women. Pink Hope was originally established in response to a gap in the provision of information, relevant guidance and emotional support to women at-risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Our organisation has witnessed an even greater need for us to empower the general population to assess, understand and reduce their risk. As a consequence of this Pink Hope is able to help individuals take charge of their health and the possibility for them to avoid cancer then becomes a reality."
