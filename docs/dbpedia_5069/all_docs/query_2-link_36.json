The Hope in Motion mobile unit will travel to universities, hospitals, large workplaces, community gatherings, fundraisers, churches and health fairs. PRG is excited to get Hope in Motion out into the community! To request Hope in Motion be a part of your event, please email hopeinmotion@pinkribbongirls.org.\n\nPRG clients are also being served with a client transportation vehicle.
