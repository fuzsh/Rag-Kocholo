        "text": "Image source:Â Pink Africa Foundation\n\nPink Africa Foundation is a non-profit organisation with a mission to improve the education of cancer treatment and prevention. They also provide healthcare for African women and Children that are suffering with cancer through worldwide collaboration.\n\nOver the past five years, their funding support had been diminshing. Although they have lots of partners, support has been quite limited and from only few partners. They knew that they needed to widen their audience and increase their reach in order to diversify their income streams.\n\nSince participating in BRIDGE, Pink Africa won their first major structured grant in five years. They credit the training and tools from Lightful, funded by UICC, that has enabled them to make their work more visible and palpable online\n\nThe N10,000,000 (Â£17,378) grant was awarded to Pink Africa Foundation in March 2023 by Aspire Coronation Trust (ACT) Foundation for our End Cervical Cancer Project.\n\nWith this additional funding, the Pink Africa Foundation will be able to run a 12 month project that will impact at least 1,000 direct beneficiaries - African girls and women. Activities will include HPV Vaccination of school girls, free cervical cancer screening across different towns and cities, purchase of a thermocoagulation machine and treatment of pre-cancerous cervical lesions in Nigeria. The grant paying for this is a major leap for the Pink Africa Foundation.\n\nThanks to the Bridge Digital training by Lightful and UICC, they have been able to make their work more visible and palpable online, which helped them to win this grant. The Pink Africa Foundation hope that this project will greatly reduce the mortality rate of cervical cancer in African communities."
