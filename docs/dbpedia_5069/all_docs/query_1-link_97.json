        "text": "Doris Light, President\n\n(joined board in September 2013)\n\nI received the dreaded ‘You have cancer’ call on April 3, 2006, and began the fight for my life on that day. With the prayers and support of my family and friends, I endured a lumpectomy, six rounds of chemotherapy, and 32 radiation treatments. It’s now clear to me that I’m not the person that I was before diagnosis – I’m better! Today I enjoy providing loving support, helpful advice, and a bit of laughter to other women as they fight their battle against breast cancer. It is my sincere hope that I can encourage and uplift those who now travel the road that I once did, and I can be a flashlight into their fearful darkness. Along with the other board members of the Pink Alliance, I aim to make their way easier with the knowledge that they are not alone in their journey.\n\nJanie McDougal, Director\n\n(joined board in...)\n\nIt was not really a huge surprise when I was diagnosed with breast cancer. Both my mother and my sister were already breast cancer survivors, and I knew I was a likely candidate for it sometime in the future. Although filled with certain fear and dread as I faced a bilateral mastectomy and chemotherapy in May 2001, I was comforted by the strength and faith that my mother and sister demonstrated as they underwent treatment and became strong and healthy survivors. Through the prayer and support of my family and friends, the surgery and chemotherapy went well, and I became a very grateful survivor. It is my desire through Pink Alliance to provide compassion, encouragement and helpful information to the women in our community as they receive diagnoses for breast cancer and then move forward through treatment with hope and anticipation to the time that they, too, will be happy and healthy survivors!\n\nDebbie Dunlap, Director\n\n(joined board in September 2017)\n\nAt the age of 61 and with no family history of cancer, I was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma in April 2010, after an annual mammogram. It was a total shock, and I was overwhelmed. After a lumpectomy, I had 6 chemo treatments and 7 weeks of radiation due to lymph nodes involvement. I believe my mammogram saved my life. It was not easy, but with lots of prayers and support from family and friends I did quite well. I love reaching out to other women who are experiencing the same journey and want to make a positive difference in their lives. Today, I am a breast cancer survivor and am very blessed.\n\nPatricia Gerling, Past President and Treasurer\n\n(joined board in august 2011)\n\nAt the age of 44, four words changed my life on October 1, 2002... \"You have breast cancer.\" After dealing with the shock and irony of being diagnosed on the first day of breast cancer awareness month, I found strength to accept the journey in the solitude of my parish's chapel. My mother had faced a similar challenge over 10 years earlier and won the fight, so I was set to join her and other friends in survivorship. I had a bilateral mastectomy and six chemotherapy treatments, and vowed to use my breast cancer journey to help others. Today, I am a breast cancer survivor and... Life is Good!\n\nKay McWhorter, Director\n\n(joined board in may 2014)\n\nThere is no breast cancer in my family but in June 2000, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I learned a new language!! I had received a mammogram 6 months before, but mine was found by looking in the mirror. I had Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma. The tumor was 4 1/2 cm. I chose to have a bilateral mastectomy because of the type of breast cancer that I had. They found that I also had lymph node involvement. I had 8 chemo treatments and 5 weeks of radiation treatments. My husband, Mike, and I decided from the beginning to look for positive things in this journey. Even with the fear of this journey, the unknown, we did have some great laughs! I want to encourage everyone to get your mammograms and don't be shy about drying off in front of a mirror after bathing. My mirror might have saved my life!\n\nCarolyn Oatman, Director\n\n(joined board in january 2015)\n\nI was diagnosed with stage 1 lobular breast cancer in February, 2003 at age 56. I had a lumpectomy to remove the malignant tumor in my left breast and thankfully there was no lymph node involvement. My gynecologist discovered the lump during my annual breast exam. Although the mammogram and subsequent sonogram results did not show the tumor, we could definitely feel the lesion in my left breast. An MRI confirmed the tumor and surgery occurred in March 2003. After recovery from surgery, I started 7 weeks of radiation near the location of the removed tumor. The specifics of this breast cancer journey sound very matter of fact, but there was a great deal of emotion going on during this time. I had wonderful support from my husband, family, medical personal and friends which made my journey more than manageable.\n\nKaren Slater, Director\n\n(joined board in April 2022)\n\nTracy Paine, Director\n\n(joined board in April 2022)\n\nMy mom was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008. Fortunately, they found it early and were able to treat her without chemo. She lived in Iowa at the time, and my sister and I lived in Ohio and Texas, respectively. We felt helpless. We took turns sending her fresh flowers every week, and called, texted, or emailed her daily, but still didn’t feel as though we were really there for her. That was the year that I started volunteering on the Surviving & Thriving Luncheon Committee. I wanted local women to have a support system, even if they have no family nearby. When I later learned of Pink Alliance and the impact they have on the patients and families facing breast cancer diagnoses in our area, I was hooked. I’ve never had breast cancer, but I want to serve as an advocate for those who do. I want to be a part of the support system for everyone facing this battle. I want to be even a small part of what helps them through their difficult journey.\n\nSue Schuelke, Director\n\n(joined board in september 2023)\n\nAugust of 2013 brought a big change to my life! At age 56 with no family history of breast cancer, I was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. This was right in the midst of building our retirement home in College Station while completing my public school administrative career in northwest Houston. It was a huge shock. My lump was found at a very early stage, so after a lumpectomy and four weeks of radiation, life nearly became normal again. But my yearly mammogram made all the difference! Thanks to my husband, family, friends, and coworkers who made my journey much easier. Now I am a 10-year breast cancer survivor!"
