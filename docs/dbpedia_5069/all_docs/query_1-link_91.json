        "text": "Breast Cancer Warriors Unite: Celebrate Resilience, Volunteer Your Heart, and Give Comfort and Hope to Breast Cancer Patients and Survivors\n\nWARWICK, R.I., April 18, 2024 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ — United Breast Cancer Foundation (UBCF) is calling on volunteers and the Warwick, Rhode Island community to join us for a day dedicated to those battling breast cancer! The “Gifts of Comfort and Hope” Mattress & Pink Bag Event on Saturday, April 27th is being held at the Warwick Mall. The highly anticipated event will provide vital resources, thoughtful gifts and an uplifting experience for breast cancer warriors. This very special day is quickly approaching, so if you are a breast cancer patient or survivor, we encourage you to apply today and attend the event to feel the warmth and support blossoming this Spring!\n\nIn collaboration with fellow breast cancer organization, Gloria Gemma Breast Cancer Resource Foundation, UBCF aims to provide a nurturing and restorative day for deserving individuals. Attendees will receive restorative and therapeutic mattresses and pampering gifts at no cost, in a supportive environment.\n\nUBCF needs volunteers to help make this event unforgettable and is seeking passionate individuals to play a vital role in this impactful event. Here are the opportunities available:\n\nPersonal Shopper: Assist attendees in selecting their gifts, creating a personalized and caring shopping experience.\n\nTraffic Control: Ensure the event runs smoothly by guiding attendees and managing the event flow.\n\nWelcoming Committee: Offer a warm welcome, provide essential information, and answer any questions, ensuring attendees feel supported from the moment they arrive.\n\nThe “Gifts of Comfort and Hope” Mattress and Pink Bag Event is for people impacted by breast cancer, and joining UBCF as a supporting community member is a truly rewarding experience. You will be a part of something incredibly meaningful – offering comfort, hope, and empowering those affected by breast cancer. An article on CancerConnect emphasizes that being diagnosed with cancer can stir up a host of emotions — fear, anger, confusion, and sadness. It’s an emotional roller coaster and hard to ride alone. By offering emotional support, encouragement and inspiration, the community becomes a pillar of strength for a challenging journey.\n\nThis event embodies that community spirit, providing an opportunity for human connection and support that can boost mental well-being during treatment and recovery. Sharon V., a breast cancer survivor who attended a previous UBCF Mattress & Pink Bag Event shared, “It was truly a memorable day filled with warmth, support, and inspiration. The opportunity to meet and connect with other breast cancer survivors was truly invaluable. The chance to share our experiences, hopes, and dreams with others who have walked a similar path brought us immense comfort and strength. I made new friends today!”\n\nMany people fighting breast cancer struggle with getting restful sleep due to physical discomforts. The “Gifts of Comfort and Hope” Event seeks to alleviate such hardships by providing patients and survivors with queen-sized mattresses to enhance sleep quality and overall well-being. Due to overwhelming response, all mattresses have been accounted for, but more events are in the works – and Pink Bag “shopping” is still available!\n\n“Chemotherapy has left me with so much bone and joint pain. Surgery, drains, lymphedema and cording have made sleeping very difficult and uncomfortable. Having a new mattress may not be a big deal for other people, but for me? It means the whole world! Just to think that I am finally going to be able to have a comfortable mattress and that I will get a good night sleep is going to change a lot,” exclaimed Emma S., another attendee who benefitted from a previous UBCF Mattress & Pink Bag Event.\n\nBut the comfort doesn’t stop there. Attendees will enjoy Pink Bags filled with delightful goodies, offering a moment of self-care and a reminder that they deserve to be pampered. Kathleen V., Pink Bag recipient from UBCF’s most recent event described her Princess Day, “I attended this event and had not smiled so much in a long time. The ladies were such a joy to work with, made me feel special. I received so many lovely things; skin care, hair care products, clothing, sneakers, household items, etc. So many items and surprise gifts!”\n\nSpread the word and show your support! Share this with friends, family and neighbors and encourage others to join us on Saturday, April 27th for the “Gifts of Comfort and Hope” Mattress and Pink Bag Event. This will be a day of relief, renewal, strength, and inspiration.\n\nEvent Details & Registration:\n\nThe UBCF Mattress and Pink Bag Event is open to all breast cancer patients and survivors. Attendees must be present to receive items, which cannot be stored or shipped. We are still accepting applications for the Pink Bag Shopping portion of the event.
