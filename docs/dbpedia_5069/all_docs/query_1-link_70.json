Donations to The Project PINK Fund allow for “Free Mammography Days” in underserved communities where the need is highest. In partnership with Charlotte Radiology, the program’s state-of-the-art mobile breast center travels throughout the community offering free screenings in a convenient, compassionate environment.\n\nLevine Cancer: Project PINK allows eligible women a free screening mammogram and follow-up care (diagnostic screening, ultrasound, biopsy) if recommended.\n\nLevine Cancer: Project PINK Plus provides women who have an existing breast lump or other concern the opportunity to receive a free diagnostic mammogram and follow-up care.\n\nIf there is a positive cancer finding during either program, the patient will be navigated throughout the entire treatment from diagnosis to survivorship."
