        "text": "Meet the Founder\n\nAbout The Founder of Pink Heals\n\nDave Graybill is a visionary leader who founded Pink Heals, Inc., a grass roots volunteer organization bringing love and hope to people on a local level and Hlthe (pronounced “healthy”) LLC, a worldwide platform that is changing the way individuals, non-profits and businesses donate to one another, making every transaction transparent.\n\nDave believes that our innate calling to serve those in need should be driven directly to the person in need. His vision is to change or replace the systems that do not support the driving force of this great nation, the people, with ones that do support us.\n\nPink Heals was founded on the premise that it is the heart of the woman that holds our families, communities and a country together. It is no mistake that the Statue of Liberty is a woman, that Mother Nature rules the earth or that we refer to our nation as the Motherland.\n\nThe vehicles are pink to signify our women and their passion for selfless giving. Those vehicles drive door to door to bring back the human element of celebrating people, and not the causes or ribbons that have become so commonplace. Hlthe was founded on that same core philosophy of personalized giving. Using technology, Hlthe is able to guarantee that money donated for basic needs, such as healthcare, is used for the exact purpose, and person, it was intended for in the first place. It makes giving safe, secure, and trackable!\n\nDave has been featured on CNN and nationally on countless news stations, newspapers and magazines. He has shared his passion for people with national audiences large and small. His book, Pink Heals, The Mending of America has been in circulation since 2011 and his years of door to door visits via the Pink Heals National Tour can be viewed on YouTube as well as Facebook and his website. His frequent posts about the vision and success of Hlthe can be found there as well."
