SUPPORTING PINK HOPE

What are our Holidays for Hope getaways?

Our Holidays for Hope getaways offer a weekend of canape nights, wine tours and long lunches and catching up with your girlfriends, all whilst raising money for the incredible Pink Hope community. Pink Hope is a preventative health organisation that empowers women to take action against their risk of breast or ovarian cancer by providing them with the necessary tools and emotional support to do so.

To show our support, Girls Getaways donates 50% of all Holidays for Hope ticket profits and any additional fundraising efforts towards wellness retreats for the Pink Hope community. These retreats offer cancer-affected women a chance to escape their daily routines, hospital checkups and current health concerns and indulge in their own, much-deserved getaway.
