The national flag of Portugal is a rectangular bicolour with a field divided into green on the hoist, and red on the fly. The lesser version of the national coat of arms of Portugal (armillary sphere and Portuguese shield) is centered over the colour boundary at equal distance from the upper and lower edges. It was officically adopted in 1911.

Fully sewn flags are made with poly woven fabric, which is also referred to as woven "bunting", they are appliqu√©d, using layers of fabric and custom stitching to make the artwork. Long-lasting, durable, as well as the most elegant and undoubtedly a keepsake item. These are made using the traditional methods of flag making.

Printed on a poly woven fabric similar to the fully sewn flags just a less denier for the ink to penetrate through the fabric, this makes them suitable for indoor and outdoor use, this is the most durable and traditional of the printed flags. These are either screen printed or digitally printed. Digitally printed can be printed on a lightweight satin or a poly knitted fabric, a cost-effective option.

All flags are and finished with double stitched hems with UV stable header tape and UV stable recycled thread. All flags unless specified otherwise are finished with sister clips, other finishes are available such as sleeves for poles, or loop and tail etc, if you require these please put the finish you would like in the notes when you view your cart.
