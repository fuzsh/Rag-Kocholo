        "text": "The Portuguese flag is composed of green and red stripe, and the national coat of arms. The stripes don´t have the same width and the center of the coat of arms is placed at the borderline between these two stripes. The red color symbolizes the blood shed during the Portuguese revolution in 1910 and the green color stands for hope. Five blue emblems on a white field are allegedly reminder of five Moorish kings, who the first Portuguese king Afonso Henriques had to defeat. Its cross position points to the Christian tradition. Seven castles on the larger red emblem symbolize the seven castles that Alfons had to conquer. Golden navigation device in the background of the coat of arms refers to the Portuguese past as a colonial power.\n\nCountry information\n\nSovereign State Yes Country codes PT, PRT (ISO 3166-1) Official name Portuguese Republic Capital city Lisbon Continent Europe Member of United Nations, European Union, NATO Population 10 276 617 (2018) Total area 92 090 km2 Highest point Montanha do Pico on Pico Island (2 351 m, 7 713 ft) Lowest point North Atlantic Ocean GDP per capita $ 23 408 (World Bank, 2018) Currency Euro (€, EUR) Calling code +351 Internet TLD .pt\n\nFlags of neighboring countries\n\nCountry location"
