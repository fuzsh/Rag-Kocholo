Centered in this partition a coat of arms consisting on an armillary sphere charged with the traditional portuguese shield.\n\nAntónio Martins-Tuválkin, 4 June 1997\n\nThe portuguese constitution is extremely laconic regarding flags. The only specifically vex info there is in Article 11 (National symbols), paragraph 1. and reads (my translation):\n\nThe national flag, symbol of the soveregnty of the Republic and of Portugal’s independence, unity and integrity, is the one adopted by the Republic established by the Revolution of 5 October 1910.\n\nAnd that’s it. The Portuguese constitution, by the way, has 299 articles, some of them quite long.\n\nJorge Candeias, 12 Mar 1999\n\nIn fact upon adoption in 1911 by the Constitutional assembly, the flag was described as, and I quote,\n\nbi-partida verticalmente em duas côres fundamentaes, verde escuro e escarlate, ficando o verde do lado da tralha.\n\nWich means «vertically divided in two fundamental colours, dark green and scarlet, with the green in the hoist side.»\n\nJorge Candeias, 24 Nov 1998\n\nDesign\n\nColour shades\n\nHere are the Portuguese flag colours:\n\nRed (fly field)\n\nGreen (hoist field)\n\nGold (castles, armilary sphere)\n\nBlue (escutcheons)\n\nWhite (besants, inner shield, the fimbriation next to the red border)\n\nBlack (lining around all elements, exc. bezants and fields) [ed.]\n\nA. S. Marques, 28 Nov 1998\n\nMy Pantone Book of Colour has a 2 + 4 digits reference plus name. With this one I would point out «Pepper green» (18-5841) as the best approximation to the 1911 booklet by the flag’s author himself [cba11] (my copy is in mint state and apparently not discoloured). Please note this was more or less the tone that one would constantly see in the early depictions of the flag.\n\nA. S. Marques, 25 Nov 1998\n\nThe five escutcheons are in medium or dark blue, never in sky blue. This is not written anywhere, but is quite traditional.\n\nA. S. Marques, 25 Nov 1998\n\nSymbolism\n\nFlag meant to simbolize Hope (green) + Sacrifice (red)…\n\nA. S. Marques, 25 Nov 1998\n\nAbout the symbolism, it’s a fairy tale. The green and red where adopted by the republicans without this symbolism (rather from masonic-carbonarian connections), which was added later to give the flag more “dignity”. It’s a typical case of symbolism emerging from the design.\n\nJorge Candeias, 27 Nov 1998\n\nReverse\n\n2:3 image by António Martins-Tuválkin, 10 June 2008\n\nThe correct image of the reverse of the Portuguese national flag is a mirror image of the obverse , this flag being a two-dimensional object in spite of its design complexity: The ecliptic of the armillary sphere being the only non-symmetrical element of the Portuguese arms, on the obverse its upper end is on the green/hoist side and its lower end is on the red/fly side.\n\nAntónio Martins-Tuválkin, 10 June 2008"
