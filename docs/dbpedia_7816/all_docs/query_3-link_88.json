        "text": "We use words in writing. Shocking, I know! Do you know what else we use in writing? Here is a hint: they have already appeared in this paragraph. In addition to words, we use many different symbols and characters to organize our thoughts and make text easier to read. All of these symbols come in two major categories: punctuation marks and typographical symbols. These symbols have many different uses and include everything from the humble period (.) to the rarely used caret symbol (^). There may even be a few symbols out there that you’ve never even heard of before that leave you scratching your head when you see them on your keyboard!\n\nWhat is punctuation?\n\nPunctuation is the act or system of using specific marks or symbols in writing to separate different elements from each other or to make writing more clear. Punctuation is used in English and the other languages that use the Latin alphabet. Many other writing systems also use punctuation, too. Thanks to punctuation, we don’t have to suffer through a block of text that looks like this:\n\nMy favorite color is red do you like red red is great my sister likes green she always says green is the color of champions regardless of which color is better we both agree that no one likes salmon which is a fish and not a color seriously\n\nPunctuation examples\n\nThe following sentences give examples of the many different punctuation marks that we use:\n\nMy dog, Bark Scruffalo, was featured in a superhero movie.\n\nIf there’s something strange in your neighborhood, who are you going to call?\n\nA wise man once said, “Within the body of every person lies a skeleton.”\n\nHooray! I found everything on the map: the lake, the mountain, and the forest.\n\nI told Ashley (if that was her real name) that I needed the copy lickety-split.\n\nWhat is a typographical symbol?\n\nThe term typographical symbol, or any other number of phrases, refers to a character or symbol that isn’t considered to be a punctuation mark but may still be used in writing for various purposes. Typographical symbols are generally avoided in formal writing under most circumstances. However, you may see typographic symbols used quite a bit in informal writing.\n\nTypographical symbol examples\n\nThe following examples show some ways that a writer might use typographical symbols. Keep in mind that some of these sentences may not be considered appropriate in formal writing.\n\nThe frustrated actor said she was tired of her co-star’s “annoying bull****.”\n\nFor questions, email us at anascabana@bananacabanas.fake!\n\nThe band had five #1 singles on the American music charts during the 1990s.\n\nMy internet provider is AT&T.\n\nTypes of punctuation and symbols\n\nThere are many different types of punctuation marks and typographical symbols. We’ll briefly touch on them now, but you can learn more about these characters by checking out the links in this list and also each section below:\n\nPeriod\n\nQuestion mark\n\nExclamation point\n\nComma\n\nColon\n\nSemicolon\n\nHyphen\n\nEn dash\n\nEm dash\n\nParentheses\n\nSquare brackets\n\nCurly brackets\n\nAngle brackets\n\nQuotation marks\n\nApostrophe\n\nSlash\n\nEllipses\n\nAsterisk\n\nAmpersand\n\nBullet point\n\nPound symbol\n\nTilde\n\nBackslash\n\nAt symbol\n\nCaret symbol\n\nPipe symbol\n\nPeriod, question mark, and exclamation point\n\nThese three commonly used punctuation marks are used for the same reason: to end an independent thought.\n\nPeriod (.)\n\nA period is used to end a declarative sentence. A period indicates that a sentence is finished.\n\nToday is Friday.\n\nUnique to them, periods are also often used in abbreviations.\n\nProf. Dumbledore once again awarded a ludicrous amount of points to Gryffindor.\n\nQuestion mark (?)\n\nThe question mark is used to end a question, also known as an interrogative sentence.\n\nDo you feel lucky?\n\nExclamation point (!)\n\nThe exclamation point is used at the end of exclamations and interjections.\n\nOur house is haunted!\n\nWow!\n\nComma, colon, and semicolon\n\nCommas, colons, and semicolons can all be used to connect sentences together.\n\nComma (,)\n\nThe comma is often the punctuation mark that gives writers the most problems. It has many different uses and often requires good knowledge of grammar to avoid making mistakes when using it. Some common uses of the comma include:\n\nJoining clauses: Mario loves Peach, and she loves him.\n\nNonrestrictive elements: My favorite team, the Fighting Mongooses, won the championship this year.\n\nLists: The flag was red, white, and blue.\n\nCoordinate adjectives: The cute, happy puppy licked my hand.\n\nTry out this quiz on the Oxford comma!\n\nColon (:)\n\nThe colon is typically used to introduce additional information.\n\nThe detective had three suspects: the salesman, the gardener, and the lawyer.\n\nLike commas, colons can also connect clauses together.\n\nWe forgot to ask the most important question: who was buying lunch?\n\nColons have a few other uses, too.\n\nThe meeting starts at 8:15 p.m.\n\nThe priest started reading from Mark 3:6.\n\nSemicolon (;)\n\nLike the comma and the colon, the semicolon is used to connect sentences together. The semicolon typically indicates that the second sentence is closely related to the one before it.\n\nI can’t eat peanuts; I am highly allergic to them.\n\nLucy loves to eat all kinds of sweets; lollipops are her favorite.\n\nHyphen and dashes (en dash and em dash)\n\nAll three of these punctuation marks are often referred to as “dashes.” However, they are all used for entirely different reasons.\n\nHyphen (-)\n\nThe hyphen is used to form compound words.\n\nI went to lunch with my father-in-law.\n\nShe was playing with a jack-in-the-box.\n\nHe was accused of having pro-British sympathies.\n\nEn dash (–)\n\nThe en dash is used to express ranges or is sometimes used in more complex compound words.\n\nThe homework exercises are on pages 20–27.\n\nThe songwriter had worked on many Tony Award–winning productions.\n\nEm dash (—)\n\nThe em dash is used to indicate a pause or interrupted speech.\n\nThe thief was someone nobody expected—me!\n\n“Those kids will—” was all he managed to say before he was hit by a water balloon.\n\nTest your knowledge on the different dashes here.\n\nParentheses, brackets, and braces\n\nThese pairs of punctuation marks look similar, but they all have different uses. In general, the parentheses are much more commonly used than the others.\n\nParentheses ()\n\nTypically, parentheses are used to add additional information.\n\nI thought (for a very long time) if I should actually give an honest answer.\n\nTomorrow is Christmas (my favorite holiday)!\n\nParentheses have a variety of other uses, too.\n\nPollution increased significantly. (See Chart 14B)\n\nHe was at an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting.\n\nRichard I of England (1157–1199) had the heart of a lion.\n\nSquare brackets []\n\nTypically, square brackets are used to clarify or add information to quotations.\n\nAccording to an eyewitness, the chimpanzees “climbed on the roof and juggled [bananas].”\n\nThe judge said that “the defense attorney [Mr. Wright] had made it clear that the case was far from closed.”\n\nCurly brackets {}\n\nCurly brackets, also known as braces, are rarely used punctuation marks that are used to group a set.\n\nI was impressed by the many different colors {red, green, yellow, blue, purple, black, white} they selected for the flag’s design.\n\nAngle brackets <>\n\nAngle brackets have no usage in formal writing and are rarely ever used even in informal writing. These characters have more uses in other fields, such as math or computing.\n\nQuotation marks and apostrophe\n\nYou’ll find these punctuation marks hanging out at the top of a line of text.\n\nQuotation marks (“”)\n\nThe most common use of quotation marks is to contain quotations.\n\nShe said, “Don’t let the dog out of the house.”\n\nBob Ross liked to put “happy little trees” in many of his paintings.\n\nApostrophe (‘)\n\nThe apostrophe is most often used to form possessives and contractions.\n\nThe house’s back door is open.\n\nMy cousin’s birthday is next week.\n\nIt isn’t ready yet.\n\nWe should’ve stayed outside.\n\nSlash and ellipses\n\nThese are two punctuation marks you may not see too often, but they are still useful.\n\nSlash (/)\n\nThe slash has several different uses. Here are some examples:\n\nRelationships: The existence of boxer briefs somehow hasn’t ended the boxers/briefs debate.\n\nAlternatives: They accept cash and/or credit.\n\nFractions: After an hour, 2/3 of the audience had already left.\n\nEllipses (…)\n\nIn formal writing, ellipses are used to indicate that words were removed from a quote.\n\nThe mayor said, “The damages will be … paid for by the city … as soon as possible.”\n\nIn informal writing, ellipses are often used to indicate pauses or speech that trails off.\n\nHe nervously stammered and said, “Look, I … You see … I wasn’t … Forget it, okay.”\n\nTypographical symbols\n\nTypographical symbols rarely appear in formal writing. You are much more likely to see them used for a variety of reasons in informal writing.\n\nAsterisk (*)\n\nIn formal writing, especially academic and scientific writing, the asterisk is used to indicate a footnote.\n\nChocolate is the preferred flavor of ice cream.*\n\n*According to survey data from the Ice Cream Data Center.\n\nThe asterisk may also be used to direct a reader toward a clarification or may be used to censor inappropriate words or phrases.\n\nAmpersand (&)\n\nThe ampersand substitutes for the word and. Besides its use in the official names of things, the ampersand is typically avoided in formal writing.\n\nThe band gave a speech at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nBullet Point (•)\n\nBullet points are used to create lists. For example,\n\nFor this recipe you will need:\n\neggs\n\nmilk\n\nsugar\n\nflour\n\nbaking powder\n\nPound symbol (#)\n\nInformally, the pound symbol is typically used to mean number or is used in social media hashtags.\n\nThe catchy pop song reached #1 on the charts.\n\nReady 4 Halloween 2morrow!!! #spooky #TrickorTreat\n\nTilde (~)\n\nBesides being used as an accent mark in Spanish and Portuguese words, the tilde is rarely used. Informally, a person may use it to mean “about” or “approximately.”\n\nWe visited São Paulo during our vacation.\n\nI think my dog weighs ~20 pounds.\n\nBackslash (\\)\n\nThe backslash is primarily used in computer programming and coding. It might be used online and in texting to draw emoticons, but it has no other common uses in writing. Be careful not to mix it up with the similar forward slash (/), which is a punctuation mark.\n\nAt symbol (@)\n\nThe at symbol substitutes for the word at in informal writing. In formal writing, it is used when writing email addresses.\n\nHis email address is duckduck@goose.abc.\n\nCaret symbol (^)\n\nThe caret symbol is used in proofreading, but may be used to indicate an exponent if a writer is unable to use superscript.\n\nDo you know what 3^4 (3 to the power of 4) is equal to?\n\nPipe symbol (|)"
