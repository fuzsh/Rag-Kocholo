        "text": "Double red flags means water is closed to the public.\n\nRed flag is high hazard meaning high surf and/or strong currents.\n\nYellow flag is medium hazard meaning moderate surf and/or currents.\n\nGreen flag is low hazard meaning calm conditions, exercise caution.\n\nPurple flag means dangerous marine life spotted.\n\nAbsence of flags does not assure safe waters.\n\nWhy does Florida need a uniform warning flag system?\n\nWarning flags are posted by many coastal communities, but, the flags used to identify different tide and surf conditions vary from place to place. Many residents and visitors travel to different parts of the state to enjoy our wonderful public beaches. Differences in flag colors, size and symbols can confuse beach goers, thereby decreasing the effectiveness of efforts to improve public safety.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe beach warning flag program uses the colors adopted by the International Lifesaving Federation, with symbols added to clarify the meaning of the flags. The program also includes the placement of interpretive signs along the beach to explain the meaning each flag used in the warning system.\n\nTo the extent of available funds, the warning flags and interpretive signs are provided free of charge to local governments that provide public beach access. The communities that receive the free warning flags and interpretive signs are responsible for the installation, proper use, and maintenance of the flags and signs. Public beaches utilizing a warning system must adhere to the stateâ€™s uniform warning flag program."
