        "text": "Flags are unique to a country or nation: but languages are often spoken across national borders. By using a flag for a language, you may confuse or even offend users.\n\nConsider these examples:\n\nEnglish\n\nArguably, the flag of England is the most appropriate flag to represent the English language. But how recognizable is the English flag?\n\nHowever, often the British flag is used to represent English. Within Britain, other languages other than English are spoken — including Welsh and Scottish Gaelic.\n\nOften the United States flag is used to represent English — and while the USA has far more English speakers than Britain, English does not originate from the United States.\n\nFurthermore, English is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world: it is spoken in countries including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa to name just a few. How will users from these countries react to an English, British or American flag?\n\nSpanish\n\nThe Spanish flag is often used to represent the Spanish language.\n\nHowever, in Mexico alone there are more Spanish speakers than Spain.\n\nSpanish is also spoken in numerous other countries including Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela. There are also a large number of Spanish speakers in the United States — including Puerto Rico. Is a Spanish flag the best choice for users outside of Spain?\n\nFrench\n\nThe French flag is an obvious choice to represent the French language. While most French speakers live in France, French is spoken in many other countries — including Belgium, Ivory Coast and Switzerland.\n\nFrench is spoken in Switzerland along with other languages — Italian, German and Romansh.\n\nSimilarly, in Belgium French is also spoken with other languages — mostly Flemish/Dutch and German in a small minority.\n\nHow will users from other French-speaking countries — Belgium or Switzerland especially — feel about the use of the French flag?\n\nHindi\n\nHindi is the most popular language in India with over 400 million speakers, but it is only one of 22 official languages of India. There also are over 80 million speakers of Bengali in India and over 70 million speakers of both Telugu and Marathi.\n\nMany other languages share similar issues when combined into a single flag — including Arabic, German and Portuguese. Flags are specific to countries: languages often cross borders.\n\nIf you are targeting users from a specific country, then flags are highly appropriate. However, if you’re targeting users of a specific languages, think again before using flags.\n\nFurther reading (external sites)"
