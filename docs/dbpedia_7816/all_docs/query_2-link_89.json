        "text": "Portucuriosities.Wordpress.com\n\nFacebook/portucuriosities\n\nSo our flag is the last of more than fifteen evolving since the xii century.The first FLAG had a big blue cross with a white SILVER background. Needless to say that the cross was all about christ and the crusades …..Our first flag is the same as the 1918 Finish flag?? That’s weird….\n\nThe actual flag is based on the colors red and green, implemented in 1910 by the republicans and their armed freemason secret society, the cARBONÁRIA. Or should i say terrorists against the monarchy….?Actually the King and his son were murdered at the commerce square, by the Republicans-CARBONÁRIA in Lisboa in 1908. From that point on, republicans started to gain terrain, until the Republic is finally declared in 1910. There was a big discussion , on whether the flag should be Silver and Blue versus Green and Red. Actually silver and blue has always been recognized as the official portuguese flag colors,\n\nbut this instead would represent monarchy, and obviously Republicans-FREEMASONS when they took over power, they wanted their colors,green and red representing their own flag changing completely the previous one, as shown under. So, Portugal was one of the rare countries in Europe that not followed and respected the HERALDRY of the national flag.Not good..\n\nSo in school i was told that the green stands for HOPE and the red for the blood shaded in batail but….Apparently ,that was not so simple as it seems. THE RED FOR THE FREEMASONS can also represent war,heroism, sacrifice.Roman generals use to wear their red robes all the time. There is also a darker side on it, the flames of hell,demons and rage. As for the Green, the resurrection, immortality, rebirth and yes, the Egyptians considered it the color of HOPE. Finally YELLOW….For the masonry it always has been seen as representing GOLD ,the SUN and MEN, opposed to Silver , THE MOON or women.It has been said that stands for wisdom ,as the rays of the sun lighten the day , or lighten the candidate in a educational way.\n\nThen the castles, seven castles conquered in the ALGARVE, against the moorish army describing the FUTURE independence of Portugal as a nation.Only seven? Mystical number for seven colors of the rainbow,seven musical notes , the seven hills and so on..\n\nBy the way the yellow sphere at the center also represents the famous nautical astrolabe,brought by the templars and commonly used by the navigators using the stars as a map during their maritime travellings. The age of maritime discoveries during wich Portugal was considered a big powerful empire …\n\nFinally there are 5 blue shields placed in a shape of a cross.According to my research, represents the five moorish kings that our brave Afonso Henriques defeated in batail, in the name of Christ, during the crusades period.Inside each shield, there are 5 silver dots or, the 5 wounds of Christ, a very powerful devotion for the Christianity sinCe the xii century. Also a Big devotion for Pope Francis nowadays.\n\nSo to conclude our flag altough” ilegal” is very spiritual ,charged of symbolism and mysticism, representing big feats that occured in the past , linked to war, faith and heroism.\n\nDoes mansonry fits in with Cristianity?Maybe the old cristianity is not the same as the actual roman catholic church?\n\nIs it Portugal very important to all of those secret societies that have been rulling behind the cortins ?\n\nWould it be the same if we still had the original silver blue flag?"
