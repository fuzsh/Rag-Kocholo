        "text": "Nylon\n\nOur Nylon flags are made with durability in mind. They are made of 100% heavyweight 200-denier Nylon that is specially treated to resist deterioration, making them great in the harshest of weather conditions. Our Nylon flags can be easily flown outdoors, even in the slightest of breezes. This means that you can confidently and proudly display this flag outdoors to stand the test of time.\n\nPolyester\n\nOur Polyester flags are a heavyweight fabric that looks and feels like cotton. This material is used with higher wind speeds in mind. This means higher durability is accounted for. This material is meant to be flown at great heights and in heavier wind conditions, making this material the best choice for tall flagpoles or high wind areas.\n\nLight Weight Polyester\n\nLight Weight Polyester flags are printed on a lighter, richly colored indoor quality material. These flags can be flown outdoors for short periods of time. They’re perfect for pictures or as a souvenir of a special trip.\n\nHandheld\n\nOur Handheld flags are regular flags, but mobile! They are printed on a lightweight indoor quality material.

We store one flag for each flag you are flying that is associated with your account.\n\nAt the time of your scheduled or requested rotation, we will; travel to you, remove your tattered flag, and respectfully hoist your fresh repaired flag. Your tattered flag is then brought to our facility where it is delicately repaired by our team, and placed in your specially designated bin, awaiting another rotation.\n\nHere’s the best part! When your flag has aged to the point at which it is beyond repair, we will hoist a beautifully and carefully made replacement flag on your flagpole at the time of your next rotation.\n\nFlag Repairs\n\nOur highly experienced flag expert can skillfully repair your flag.
