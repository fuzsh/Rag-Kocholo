        "text": "Tell us if you see abusive content\n\nIf you see something you believe may violate our policies, whether in profiles, posts, messages, comments, or anywhere else, please report it to us. Combined with our automated defenses, these reports help us identify and prevent abuse. Users can report content by clicking on the three dots icon in the upper right-hand corner of the content itself on LinkedIn. Please use the reporting tools responsibly and only for their intended purposes. To learn more about how to report inappropriate content, behavior, or members, visit our Transparency Center.\n\nIn addition to LinkedIn's trained content reviewers, we use automated systems to identify potentially violative content. Violating content can be removed from LinkedIn. Learn more about our approach to content moderation, including our automated systems, here.\n\nViolating our community policies can result in action against your account or content\n\nThese policies apply to all members. Depending on the severity of violation, we may limit the visibility of certain content, label it, or remove it entirely. Repeated or egregious offenses will result in account restriction. If you believe action taken on your content or your account was in error, you can submit an appeal.\n\nLearn more about how we enforce violations of our Professional Community Policies.\n\nDo not post harassing content: We don’t allow bullying or harassment. This includes targeted personal attacks, intimidation, shaming, disparagement, and abusive language directed at other members.

Do not share, post, transmit, or solicit child exploitation material through or using our platform. Do not use LinkedIn in any way to facilitate, encourage, or engage in the abuse or exploitation of children. When we become aware of apparent child exploitation, we report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). Additionally, while we recognize that there may be instances where people share images of non-sexualized child nudity with good intentions, we generally remove these images due to the potential of misappropriation and abuse by others.\n\nDo not promote, sell or attempt to purchase illegal or dangerous goods or services. We don't allow content that facilitates the purchase of illegal or dangerous goods and/or services, prostitution, and escort services. We don't allow content that promotes or distributes fake educational and/or professional certifications, sale of scraped data, proxy test-taking, or instructions on creating forged official documents. You may not use LinkedIn to hold lotteries, contests, sweepstakes, or giveaways. Do not use LinkedIn to sensationalize or capitalize on tragic events for commercial purposes.\n\nLearn more about our illegal and inappropriate commercial activity policy.\n\nDo not share content promoting dangerous organizations or individuals. We don't allow any terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups on our platform. And we don't allow any individuals who affiliate with such organizations or groups to have a LinkedIn profile. Content that depicts terrorist activity, that is intended to recruit for terrorist organizations, or that threatens, promotes, or supports terrorism in any manner is not tolerated.\n\nLearn more about our dangerous organizations and individuals policy.\n\nDo not share false or misleading content: Do not share content that is false, misleading, or intended to deceive. Do not share content to interfere with or improperly influence an election or other civic process. Do not share content that directly contradicts guidance from leading global health organizations and public health authorities; including false information about the safety or efficacy of vaccines or medical treatments. Do not share content or endorse someone or something in exchange for personal benefit (including personal or family relationships, monetary payment, free products or services, or other value), unless you have included a clear and conspicuous notice of the personal benefit you receive and have otherwise complied with our Advertising Policies.\n\nLearn more about our false or misleading content policy.\n\nDo not create a fake profile or falsify information about yourself: We don’t allow fake profiles or entities.

Do not associate yourself on LinkedIn with a business or organization that you are not actually professionally associated with. Do not use or attempt to use another person's LinkedIn account or create a member profile for anyone other than yourself. And do not share your LinkedIn account with anyone else.\n\nDo not scam, defraud, deceive others. Do not use LinkedIn to facilitate romance scams, promote pyramid schemes, or otherwise defraud members. Do not share malicious software that puts our members, platform, or services at risk. Phishing attempts are not tolerated.\n\nLearn more about our scams and fraud content policies.\n\nBe professional\n\nLinkedIn's mission is to connect the world's professionals to make them more productive and successful. We allow broad conversations about the world of work, but require professional expression. To maintain a professional platform, members should treat each other with respect and civility. Do not interact with others or share content in a way that's uncivil, inappropriate, or disrespectful.\n\nDo not be hateful. We don't allow content that attacks, denigrates, intimidates, dehumanizes, incites or threatens hatred, violence, prejudicial or discriminatory action against individuals or groups because of their actual or perceived race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, age, or disability status. Hate groups are not permitted on LinkedIn. Do not use racial, religious, or other slurs that incite or promote hatred, or any other content intended to create division. Do not post or share content that denies a well-documented historical event such as the Holocaust or slavery in the United States.\n\nLearn more about our hateful and derogatory content policies.\n\nDo not engage in sexual innuendos or unwanted advances. We don't allow unwanted expressions of attraction, desire, requests for romantic relationship, marriage proposals, sexual advances or innuendo, or lewd remarks. LinkedIn is a professional networking platform, not a dating site. Do not use LinkedIn to pursue romantic connections, ask for romantic dates, or provide sexual commentary on someone's appearance or perceived attractiveness. Do not send unwanted advances in messages, posts, or comments or send sexually explicit images to anyone on the platform.\n\nLearn more about our sexual harassment and unwanted advances policy.\n\nDo not share harmful or shocking material. We don't allow content that is excessively gruesome or shocking. This includes content that is sadistic or gratuitously graphic, such as the depiction of bodily injury, severe physical or sexual violence. We don't allow content, activities, or events that promote, organize, depict, or facilitate criminal activity. We also don't allow content depicting or promoting instructional weapon making, drug abuse, and threats of theft. Do not engage in or promote escort services, prostitution, exploitation of children, or human trafficking. Do not share content or activities that promote or encourage suicide or any type of self-injury, including self-mutilation and eating disorders.

Do not share material depicting nudity or sexual activity.\n\nLearn more about our violent and graphic content policies and our nudity and adult content policies.\n\nDo not spam members or the platform. We don't allow untargeted, irrelevant, obviously unwanted, unauthorized, in appropriately commercial or promotional, or gratuitously repetitive messages or similar content. Do not use our invitation feature to send promotional messages to people you don't know or to otherwise spam people. Please make the effort to create original, professional, relevant, and interesting content in order to gain engagement. Don't do things to artificially increase engagement with your content. Respond authentically to others’ content and don’t agree with others ahead of time to like or re-share each other’s content.\n\nLearn more about our spam content policies."
