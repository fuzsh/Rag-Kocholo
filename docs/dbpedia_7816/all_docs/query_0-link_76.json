        "text": "Portugal's Directorate-General for Consumer Affairs (DGC) on Wednesday announced its intention to fine three companies for using the national flag to sell alcohol.\n\nThe firms in question, who were in breach of the advertising code, may face fines between €2,493.98 and €24,939.89.\n\nDuring an investigation carried out between 8 and 15 July, a period that coincided with the last round of the Euros football competition, the DGC analysed 232 adverts for alcohol.\n\nThese adverts were published on 53 websites and social networks, including Facebook and Instagram, and a total of 20 companies were surveyed.\n\nThe DGC also stressed that these specific infringements only related to social media marketing, and not to more traditional forms of advertising.\n\nAs in many European countries, Portugal has specific rules surrounding the promotion of alcohol.\n\nIt is forbidden for advertisers to associate alcoholic beverages with national symbols such as the Portuguese flag.\n\nAnother rule bans the promotion of alcohol on radio and TV between the hours of 7am and 10.30pm, and it is forbidden to target minors with this type of advertising.\n\nOn this last point, the DGC added an extra warning on Wednesday.\n\n\"Due to the lack of restrictions in the legislation regarding the times at which advertising for alcoholic beverages is broadcast on digital media, it is not possible to prevent advertising from being presented indiscriminately to minors.\"\n\nIt is not yet clear if the government will take concrete steps to tackle this legislative gap.\n\nThe recent investigations aren't the first time that the Portuguese government has punished companies for using national symbols to promote alcohol.\n\nIn 2023, two similar offences sparked state disciplinary procedures, although these cases have not yet been closed."
