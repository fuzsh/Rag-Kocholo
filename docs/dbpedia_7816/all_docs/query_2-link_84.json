        "text": "Our stock flags are available in three main fabric types: Knitted Polyester, Woven Polyester, and Fully Sewn. Each fabric offers unique characteristics to suit various environments and purposes. It is important to understand the differences in order to choose the right type of flag for your needs.\n\nKnitted polyester is a lightweight fabric that is suitable for indoor and outdoor use and flies easily in the wind. It is recommended for use in calm to moderate environments, as it will fly even in a slight breeze.\n\nWoven polyester is a heavy-duty linen-look fabric that is designed for both indoor and outdoor use. It is considered to be longer-lasting and more durable than knitted polyester, and has a higher UV resistance, making it suitable for harsher conditions.\n\nFully sewn flags are the most prestigious-looking option. They are made from the same woven polyester material as flag bunting, but the design is sewn on rather than printed, giving it a premium look."
