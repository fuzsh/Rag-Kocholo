And also the \"WM\" with the gold stripes\n\nHere we go. I did them without any stripes, so you can do them with standard Editor stripes like you want them.\n\nAttachments\n\nWestern1.svg\n\nWestern2.svg\n\n62\n\nJun 5, 2022\n\n#1,582\n\nGuys, I guess I am not doing this right, so I was wondering if I could get one of you talented artist to create me a racing sticker or livery. I have tried adding my request a couple times to no avail, so I assume I am not using the right format or something.\n\nI just need a simple sticker that would read MRI Racing maybe a cool font maybe a cheeky racing flag in back ground...\n\nBlack or white fonts don't matter to me.\n\nThank you in advanced.\n\n262\n\nUnited States\n\nMilf-Wagon\n\nJun 5, 2022\n\n#1,583\n\nHey, can I get the \"Autech Version\" logo from this:\n\nWRP001\n\nGTP Race Admin\n\n11,921\n\nCalifornia\n\nGTP_WRP001\n\nJun 5, 2022\n\n#1,584\n\nWould appreciate a decal of attached minus white border (minus white outside small black borderline).

Can you please help me with these?\n\n1. Cam Shaft logo, 1 color is fine, no need for the white outline\n\n2. CashCloud, in those colors please. Cash in dark blue and cloud in a light blue. As for the logo, can you leave out the app style border? just the shapes are fine\n\n3. Gemballa racing, as you see it please Gemballa in white and racing in red\n\n4. Gemballa, i can find it in GT7 as a hollowed out logo, but i need it like here in white\n\n5. Gemballa symbol, this is the hardest one probably. Getting as close as possible will make me happy already.\n\nThanks\n\nAttachments\n\nCam shaft logo.png\n\ncashcloud-app-logo.jpeg\n\ngemballa racing.png\n\ngemballa-logo-png-transparent.png\n\nGemballa-symbol.jpeg\n\nWRP001\n\nGTP Race Admin\n\n11,921\n\nCalifornia\n\nGTP_WRP001"
