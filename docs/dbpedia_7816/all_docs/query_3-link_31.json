        "text": "A country is defined by more than its name, by more than its GDP, by more than its geography and even, by more than its history; rather, it is the symbols that make some make sense of “what” and “who” a country is nowadays. The symbols of Portugal talk of a proud, diverse and also fun nation with wonderful people.\n\nWhen we talk of national identity, the flag is a great constituent. Portugal has had its current flag since 1911, after the proclamation of the Republic one year previously. The Portuguese flag features strong colors: the contrasting red and green, along with the coat of arms. The flag symbolizes the colors of the fields, the army and the national pride. Portugal has had flags since the 12th century.\n\nThe Barcelos Rooster (Galo de Barcelos) is maybe the most popular emblems of Portugal. This is a legendary animal, said to have miraculously saved an innocent man from hanging. And if most of the peoples of the world have real national animals, the Portuguese actually have this mythical little vigilante! All around the country, you can find mascots and handicrafts presenting the rooster.\n\nThe national poet of Portugal is Luis de Camoes.\n\nAs for food, Bacalhau, dried and salted cod fish, is the specific dish in Galicia and Portugal. Port wine is the most renowned Portuguese beverage, though Madeira wine is also loved by many.\n\nAnd since we talked about wine, know that cork is another symbol of the country, along with the quercus suber or cork oak, the plant that produces this material.\n\nLisbon city, with its ornate fronts of the Belem tower, is maybe the greatest symbols of Portugal. You are always welcome to book a Lisbon tour and visit the capital city of this amazing country with welcoming, beautiful people\n\nComments\n\ncomments"
