        "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. (Oct. 16, 2012) –Yonkers native and Iona College golf alum Anthony Casalino is attempting to realize his lifelong dream of playing on the PGA TOUR as he continues on Golf Channel's 18th season of its popular reality competition series, Big Break Greenbrier, airing Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nA PGA of America apprentice at Willow Ridge Country Club in Harrison, N.Y.,Casalino is relying on his experience as a PGA of America professional to kick start his tournament career on Big Break Greenbrier. Casalino, who turned his life around and focused on golf after filing for bankruptcy in 2005, recorded a best finish T7 in the Callaway Golf PGA Assistant Championship in 2011, and qualified to compete in the 2012 Met Open in New York in late August by winning a recent qualifier with a 6-under 66.\n\nTuesday's new episode will be the third show in the 11-part series. Derek Bohlen (Fountain Hills, Ariz) and Liam Friedman (Lackawanna, N.Y.) have been eliminated from competition in the first two episodes. On Tuesday, a surprise awaits the competitors at the start of the episode as they choose their opponents to compete in the “Progressive Drive Challenge” and battle for immunity. The competitors receiving immunity will enjoy an afternoon off and take a tour of 'The Bunker,' the former top-secret U.S. Government relocation facility for Congress and an emergency Cold War fallout shelter, located at The Greenbrier. Meanwhile, on the golf course, the other players fighting to stave off elimination receive a twist that threatens to eliminate one of the season's most colorful characters.\n\nThe Big Break show concept pits highly skilled golfers against each other in a variety of challenges that test their physical skills and mental toughness. During Big Break Greenbrier, one contestant will be eliminated each week, with the last player standing awarded his Big Break, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to compete on the PGA TOUR at The Greenbrier Classic in July 2013.\n\nProduced at The Greenbrier resort in West Virginia – the historic retreat known as “America's Resort” – Big Break Greenbrier showcases golfers competing each week in various golf-related skills challenges, with ultimate winner receiving his “Big Break” – an exemption to the 2013 Greenbrier Classic on the PGA TOUR, cash and other prizes.\n\nThe cast of Big Break Greenbrier come from different backgrounds – several have multiple victories on the various mini tours all over the world, while others are resuming their golf careers after stepping away from competitive golf.

Fully recovered, Beaufils is looking to regain his confidence on the course. He is currently competing full-time on the Gateway Tour, where he is a two-time winner and has several top-10 finishes in 2012.\n\nDerek Bohlen (27, Fountain Hills, Ariz.) – Following a successful collegiate golf career at the University of Northern Iowa, Bohlen put his dreams to compete professionally on hold for an office job.
