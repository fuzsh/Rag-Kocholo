        "text": "I first posted about Abbotsford-based Kikkor Golf back in August 2009. They've recently launched their online shop and the buzz is building rapidly. Skate-style golf shoes!? Free shipping both ways!? There's lots of information readily available on the web regarding James Lepp, the mastermind behind it (click on any of these links: #1, #2, #3, #4) so I'm going to skip over the typical questions and go at this interview from a different angle.\n\nVIA: You grew up in the Lower Mainland and Kikkor headquarters are here as well. What is it about Vancouver that keeps you here?\n\nJL: Wow, so many reasons. I think if you ask anybody, whether they are from the area or elsewhere on why Vancouver is so special, you would hear similar reasons – the people, beauty, climate, sports teams (Go Canucks!), recreational activities, and on and on. Add to those attributes that my friends and family are here and really there’s no reason to leave.\n\nHow many prototypes did you go through before you decided on the final Kikkor models? Did you have to visit the factory in (China)? If so, how was that?\n\nI probably went through about 3 prototypes, with the largest change happening between protos 1 and 2. I went to the factory in China right when they had the first prototype finished, and the shoe resembled a boot more than a golf shoe! It was essential for me to be there to communicate all the changes that needed to be made, and the 2nd proto that they made was 100 times better. All in all, going to the factory is a very important process every year and it’s usually quite enjoyable.\n\nKikkors are obviously heavily influenced by skate shoes. Do you have any background in skateboarding or snowboarding? Will we ever see James Lepp bust a 360 flip or a Mctwist?\n\nHow about a busted Tibia and Fibula? Ever heard of that move? Haha. ‘Cause I pulled that one off in 2000 at Sunpeaks. I skateboarded for a few years back in the day and still snowboard now, but sadly, I think I’m more of a poser than anything.\n\nWhat are the main reasons why you think Kikkor will be successful? There really isn't anything like them on the market.\n\nLike you said, there isn’t anything on the market like it, so it gives us a unique opportunity to gain some first mover advantage. That will definitely help us in the long run. Also, we don’t shy away from strictly focusing on the younger demographic. That’s our niche and we’re sticking to it, and I believe our customers appreciate that. Lastly, the shoes are incredibly comfortable, which is the most important characteristic in golf footwear.\n\nNow that the online store is open and shoes are being shipped all over the place, it must feel great for your new passion to reach fruition. How does that feeling compare to winning a tournament? Better? Worse? Or totally different?\n\nIt feels similar to preparing before a tournament when your game feels solid, knowing that you have some confidence and a good chance of winning, but not really aware of what the outcome will be. Right now, Kikkor is still in the preparation stages even though we’re selling online already. I suppose at the end of the year, and we tally our “score” we’ll know if we won or not.\n\nThe Kikkor facebook page is pretty amazing with all the funny videos of trick shots. How did you come up with those!? Saucer pass, change up and the full swing (top the ball?) to catch the ball?\n\nI’ve spent so many years playing golf and hitting all sorts of shots, so if you combine that with my somewhat goofy attitude, eventually you get some craziness! Surprisingly, they didn’t take too much practice.\n\nKikkor’s going to be pitching on CBC’s Dragons' Den. Congrats on getting through the audition! What are you planning to do? Those guys are vultures!\n\nWe’re definitely excited about it, that’s for sure. It’s a great opportunity to show Canada what we’re all about and potentially have some business dragons on our side. The pitch is still in the works. You might just have to wait and see...\n\nSkateboard companies are always doing collaborations with other companies, limited runs etc. Are we gonna see any Kikkor x _______ collabos?\n\nIt’s possible, yes, but not something that we’ve discussed that much just yet. That might be a year 3 or 4 project.\n\nWhat do you think of Freddie Couples' Ecco Street Premier? I think they screwed up with the pricing ($180CAN!!!), which IMO, cuts off a huge segment of their target market.\n\nI think the shoes are great, really. The exposure that they’ve brought to this shoe category helps Kikkor as much as them. Anybody who’s looking for that sort of style but doesn’t want to fork out a couple C-notes, then Kikkor is perfect for them. Ecco is a premier golf shoe company, so I think for them to offer a more inexpensive product would tarnish their branding as a whole, which is why they priced it like they did.\n\nLet's rewind a little bit. When and where did you first start golfing?\n\nLedgeview G & CC in Abbotsford at age 4.\n\nDid you have any golf idols growing up?\n\nProbably Greg Norman while I was a young junior, and then after that, nobody really.\n\nYou did some amazing things at the University of Washington both on the links (NCAA golf champ) and in the class room (business degree). What made you pick that school and what was the key to your success there?\n\nSince I grew up in the Pacific Northwest I wanted to stay close to home, so UW was the perfect choice. I’m really not sure what my keys to success were. I suppose it was a combination of practice, teammates, coaches, and confidence.\n\nWhen you're not golfing or taking care of Kikkor business, what are your interests/hobbies?\n\nAnything involving a ball, puck, or some moving object worth chasing. I’m like a Labrador retriever... it’s stupid. If I could do it all over again I may have given professional soccer a try.\n\nHow often are you golfing these days?\n\nRight now, maybe once a week.\n\nAre you planning to play any tournaments in 2010?\n\nI’m going to be playing a few Canadian Tour tournaments this summer, the first being in Victoria in early June. After that, I’ll just play it by ear.\n\nFavourite Vancouverite?\n\nDoes Henrik Sedin count?\n\nFavourite restaurant?\n\nA&W\n\nFavourite beer?\n\nA&W Rootbeer\n\nFavourite music group/band?\n\nKings of Leon\n\nFavourite golfer?\n\nFred Couples (as of 2 weeks ago)\n\nFavourite golf course?\n\nSahalee GC, Redmond, WA\n\nFavourite club in your bag?\n\n54 degree gap wedge.\n\nAny last words? Shout outs? Virtual fist bumps?\n\nThe shoes are available at all BC Golf Town’s, along with other dealers here. I think that’s everything."
