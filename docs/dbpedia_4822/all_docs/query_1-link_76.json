        "text": "Juliette Massoud Burke (May 23, 1938 – Sept. 2, 2023)\n\nJuliette, lovingly called Julie by most of those who knew her, died peacefully at 7:05 p.m. on Sept. 2, 2023. She was surrounded by her loving family. At her side was her dedicated husband of 61 years, Ron Burke. Also with her were her sons Douglas and Edmund Burke and their wives Valerie and Denise. As a testament to her deep faith, all family members were praying for her and reading Bible verses to her until her last breath. Her sister, Georgette, who was in deep prayer, saw a flash of light go across a picture of Virgin Mary as Julie’s spirit soared past on her way to heaven. Juliette was a kind, loving and jovial person who cared for and lifted others up so they might also live a positive life.\n\nJuliette was born in Jaffa, Palestine on May 23, 1938, the fifth child of twelve for Fadwa El Boury and Elias Massoud. Julie was a very spiritual person who grew up near Jerusalem, “where Jesus walked,” when Palestine was peaceful under British rule. Her Christian family was very loving, and Julie had a carefree childhood until bombs started hitting areas near her home in 1948. When Julie was 10, her father Elias made the tough decision to quickly leave Palestine with a few belongings and take the whole family to Lebanon until the fighting was over. Julie’s family lived in a refugee camp in Beirut for 2 years until they could get an apartment for their large family. They were never able to return to Palestine. For 10 years, the family petitioned to come to the USA, and Juliette was sent by her father to finalize the paperwork. When they arrived in the USA in 1958, Julie’s father told them, “America is our home now.” Several of her brothers served in the U.S. Army, and all of her family became U.S. citizens. Julie was proud to work and help her parents buy their home in New Jersey.\n\nJulie started dating Ron after he returned from serving in Korea. He loved her joy of life, desire to try new things, and energy to tackle tough issues. They married July 1, 1962 and welcomed their eldest son Douglas a year later. Edmund was born two years later, and then baby Gerald arrived to complete their family. All three sons were devoted to their loving mother.\n\nAfter moving to Manassas, VA for Ron’s job with IBM, Julie started selling Avon. She loved the makeup, jewelry, and perfume, and she loved helping people. After several years of being a top “Avon Lady,” she tried her hand at Real Estate. She found her purpose and passion by helping people in Manassas find a home. Julie won many Top Producer Realtor Awards including Life-Time Million Dollar Club, but her most prized trophy was the “Legend Award.” Julie retired from Real Estate when she was 79 years old. She loved all her clients and tenants.\n\nAll Saints Catholic Church in Manassas was her sanctuary, and she prayed daily for her family and friends by name. After she retired, Valerie would take her to mass every Sunday. Over the last three years, Ron played the live-stream mass from All Saints for her. In her final years, Home Instead caregivers assisted her with compassionate care. The family extends a special thank you to Miriam for her kindness, friendship, and devotion.\n\nJuliette is predeceased by siblings Edmund Massoud, George Massoud, Joseph Massoud, Josephine Faris, and Paul Massoud. Surviving siblings are Georgette Kamburov, Raymond Massoud, Robert Massoud, Nabil Massoud, John Massoud, and Pierre Massoud.\n\nJuliette is survived by her children (and their spouses), Douglas (Valerie), Edmund (Denise) and Gerald (Julie) and her five grandchildren: Christine Burke Evans (Andrew), Jennifer Burke Singh (Simarpreet), Nathan Burke (Tiffany Downing), Deanna Burke Medina (Esteban), and David Burke.\n\nVisitation will be held at Baker-Post Funeral Home (10001 Nokesville Road, Manassas, VA 20110) on Friday, September 8th from 5 p.m. – 7 p.m. A prayer service will be held on Saturday, September 9th at 11 a.m. with interment to follow at Manassas City Cemetery. https://www.bakerpostfh.com/memorials/juliette-burke/5264692/obituary.php\n\nDonations in memory of Juliette Burke may be made in person to All Saints Catholic Church or online to the St. Vincent de Paul Society (https://svdparlington.org/).\n\nOur Beloved Terrylynn Harrell was born on September 24, 1964, in Brooklyn,NY.\n\nShe is the youngest daughter of the late George Kelly Harrell Sr. and Dorothy Mae Johnson Harrell.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her brother, Ray Anthony Harrell, niece Tanya Napolean, niece Stephanie Harrell, nephew Curtis Johnson , niece Roxanne Johnson, god-son Jordan Rice, and her loving loyal baby Precious Maxine Harrell.\n\nTerry leaves to mourn her heartbroken siblings: Leonard “June” Johnson, Contrenia Renee’ Harrell, Mildred Valez Harrell, George Kelly Harrell (Essie), and Gail Veronica Harrell.\n\nShe also leaves to mourn her loving sister-friends Zerita Renee’ Shaw and Joycelynn Harrell ; Sister-cousin Shannon Holy; Brother-friends Clinton Abernathy and Charles Joseph Vanarsdale.\n\nAn innumerable host of cousins, aunts, uncles, extended family, friends and colleagues share her loss and will cherish the love, laughs, and moments that they shared forever.\n\nTerrylyn left behind her legacy through her loving nieces and nephews that she adored and cared for as her children: James M.

Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on January 4th, 1943, her family moved to a farm in Illinois for a couple of years during her childhood, but then returned to Albuquerque. After high school she attended and graduated from the Oklahoma College for Women in Chickasha.\n\nLeaving New Mexico behind, Karen moved to the bustling big city of San Francisco and began her career there as a secretary for the JC Penny Company where she met her future husband Arthur. They married on August 30th, 1969 at the First Presbyterian Church of San Mateo, California. Life then took her from California to New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and finally, Virginia.\n\nKaren was a fantastic cook and enjoyed creating cuisines of all kinds. Her Mexican food rivaled the best restaurants. She also had a passion for gardening, beautifying her own yard and growing vegetables and herbs. She enjoyed taking classes to learn more about landscape design. Karen was a skilled seamstress creating many of her own clothes when younger as well as her son Max’s childhood Halloween costumes. She loved classic country music, and 50’s and 60’s rock and always had one of them going in the car.\n\nKaren’s life was defined by service. She was a dedicated member of the Rotary Club of Lakeridge and used the Rotary four way test as a guide for her life and relationships. She was also an active member in the Covenant Presbyterian Church in Woodbridge, helping with service projects in the community.\n\nOutwardly, Karen seemed very upright, but she did have a mischievous streak. In high school she and her friend Sally skipped school one day in senior year and spent the day touring a mortuary having all of the processes explained to them (on the pretext of writing a report for school). In college she hid six packs of beer in the toilet to keep them cold and to keep the house mother from finding them! She was quick to laugh at a good joke and had many funny stories to share.\n\nKaren is survived by her husband of 53 years, Arthur Kruschka and her son Hans Maximilian Kruschka, both of Woodbridge, daughter Gretchen Gray, her husband Ken and their children Kenny and Adam of New Hampshire. She is also survived by her sister Mary St. Claire of Arizona, brother Robert Hutchinson and his wife Lisa of Albuquerque, NM and their sons David, Kevin and Daniel and brother Stan Hutchinson and his wife Kim also of Albuquerque. She was preceded in death by her parents George and Dorothy (Gearey) Hutchinson.\n\nKaren’s memorial service will be held on Saturday, March 25th at Noon, at the Covenant Presbyterian Church, 12700 Black Forest Lane, Woodbridge, VA. The family has requested that guests refrain from wearing black to the service.\n\nIn lieu of flowers donations can be made in her memory to the Rotary Club of Lakeridge, PO Box 7537, Woodbridge, VA 22195\n\nSuzanne (Sue) Frances Brooks of Nokesville, VA passed away peacefully on January 20 at the age of 85. She was born in Baltimore, Maryland to Stephen and Louise Lauer.\n\nSue was preceded in death by her husband of 37 years, Lt. Col. George Walter Brooks III, USMC (Ret.) and her grandson Blake Walter Rhodes. She is survived by her five children: Michael Brooks, Mark Brooks (Christine), Michelle Schneider (Robert), Matthew Brooks (Laura) and Maureen Rhodes (Blake) and her six grandchildren, Sara Brooks, Katie Brooks, Matthew Brooks, Joshua Rhodes, Lexi Rhodes and Jack Rhodes.\n\nIn her late teens and early 20s, Sue worked as a model and won several beauty contests. In 1957, she met George (Walter), the love of her life and they were married 3 and half months later. As the wife of a Marine Corps officer with 22 years of service, Sue lived in various locations including California, Hawaii, and Key West, before finally settling down in Virginia. Her strong will and determination helped her through all the moves, and she worked hard to establish a supportive and loving home life while raising five children, much of which she did on her own during her husband’s overseas military deployments.\n\nIn 1971, Sue began a successful and rewarding career as a realtor, eventually acquiring a real estate broker license. She was very passionate, working hard for her clients well into her 80s. As a lifelong Catholic, she was dedicated to her church and participated often in charity events. Sue was blessed with many friends and a wonderful extended family. As the Matriarch and backbone of the Brooks family, Sue provided her children and grandchildren with countless birthday celebrations, 4th of July parties, and magical Christmas mornings. Her absence will forever be felt throughout the lives of those she raised, nurtured, served, and loved. Her family and friends are thankful to have known her and blessed to have been loved by her. May she forever rest in peace and may she always be remembered as the loving, charitable, beautiful woman she was.\n\nIf you’d like to make a donation in memory of Suzanne Frances Brooks, contributions to the American Lung Association would be appreciated: https://www.lung.org/.\n\nTo view the service details, click here: http://bit.ly/3HnVYNW\n\nDonald Dean Ratterree, Sr. “Don Sr.”, tragically passed away Saturday, November 5th, 2022 at his Fredericksburg home with his wife and son by his side.

As all children are, she was born beautiful…so much so that she outshined the day in June she came into this world. As life went on she was fortunate to have a sister, Mary, join in on the incredible journey and then came baby Santina, aka Sandy.\n\nJosephine never like her name and never thought she was pretty so she changed what she could and became Josie, and then after she met the love of her life at age 17, she married Joe and she became just Jo. She went on to travel throughout the States because of Joe’s Marine Corps career and even ended up living in Paris which opened her up to a world of fashion and style and a different culture from where she started as Josephine. She always had her own special style, was always the belle of every Marine Corps ball. Then she really hit her stride in the City of Lights.\n\nShe had four children-Nancy, Kathy, Robin and Brad. She loved them fiercely. She threw great birthday parties. She was a good wife, packing entire households (maybe nine or ten times) following Joe’s career. She had a very successful career herself as a real estate agent, transitioning to Joanne, as her children went on their own life paths. She was deep and complicated. She worked hard and she faced hardships and challenges as all of us do, but somehow she always landed on her feet. She bought her own home after parting ways with Joe but never forgot their long love. She was courted by a few suitors, but never went back to a permanent union.\n\nAs she aged and retired, she began to write poetry like crazy and filled volumes with her stored up words that flowed like a busy river. She ended up living in Fredericksburg, VA in an independent living environment. She made good friends and rolled out the Canasta cards and Mahjong tiles. She helped write plays and performed in skits, helped arrange special events and settled into Joanne beautifully. She was an influencer. She relished (and prepared endlessly including her wardrobe) attending family gatherings with her children and their spouses Brooks, Dave, Blaine and Krista. All cared for her in their own way.\n\nShe was always bursting with new stories about her grandchildren, Adam, Cara, Lauren, Grace, Nick and Kameryn, all of whom could have their own book of accolades if she had had the time to write. She loved her grandchildren’s husbands, Nick and Matt and Adam’s wife Stacy. She took great pleasure in sharing with her cousins, Joan and Marion and loved their children as well.\n\nAnd how she loved the babies, her great grandchildren, Hudson, Mia, Wyatt, Katelyn and Bennett. She loved her nieces Linda and Donna, Leslie, Wendy Adel, MaryBeth, Karen, Debbie, Dawn and Raeanne and nephews Joe (Buddy), Jackie and Danny, Rusty and Chris and all of her husband’s cousins, including the ten Nunziato children and those who called her Aunt Jo, including Mary, Carol and Stanley, Patty and Marilyn.\n\nAt one point in my last visit with her in Fredericksburg, she began to describe the great ship we traveled on to France. She was quite lucid recounting a visa issue and I felt like she was reliving that journey during that visit. And then she looked at me and asked , “Where is my husband?” I explained that he had gone on before her but she did not have to worry because he was preparing a place for her that would not require any packing or heavy lifting. She gave me a Joanne look.\n\nToday I am reminded of a poem by Henry Van Dyke about the white sails of a beautiful ship heading toward the ocean where the sky meets the blue water. The poem ends…And, just at the moment when someone says, “There, she is gone,” there are other eyes watching her coming, and other voices ready to take up the glad shout, “Here she comes!” And that is dying.\n\nAt the beginning of this glorious day my beautiful mother has gone home to her mother and father Adelaide and Francis Dioguardi, her baby sister Sandy and sister Mary, both of whom she loved dearly. She is reunited with her dear sister in laws Ronnie and Betty and her brother in laws Don and Jack, George and Felix and so many friends from many chapters in her long life. Of course my happy uncomplicated grandparents (my father Joe’s parents, Stella and George Lepp) will be setting the table with good food and an abundance of love.\n\nSo now as Brad and Robin and Kathy and I whisper in her ear, go on mom, we are all fine. We will continue to make you proud. You turned out good children who love and care for each other and those who may need our help. I love and respect you, now and forever. Thank you for giving me such an incredible life.\n\nWait…just a minute Jo, I see your Joe coming for you with all of those who love you and can’t wait to see you home. Godspeed.

From the outset, it was obvious he was the consummate “company guy” with tremendous positive energy, spirit and sense of humor (his laugh unforgettable). He was 100% trustworthy and, without hesitation, the word “ambassador” comes to mind – as loyal as they come.\n\nOne fond memory many will have from recent years is the passion he had for company corn hole competitions! It will be bittersweet to review some of the video we have in the archives! If any of you have images of Pete which you’d like to share, please let me know.\n\nFor a time, Peter brought his son Alex under his wing as a new Realtor – starting at age 18, if I recall correctly – and it was always good to see them working together for that chapter of their lives.\n\nI remember the day he exuberantly announced his retirement from his full-time CPA/CFO job (trade association, I believe)….to go full-time with real estate, and how delighted he was to leave behind his daily I-95 commute from Montclair to Crystal City and back.\n\nPete was a good friend to so many and he will be sorely missed.\n\nHe is survived by his wonderful wife Kathleen (Kathy) Frank, his daughter Elizabeth Ashley Frank, son Alex Frank and extended families.\n\n~ From the Family ~\n\nWe will let friends know when we can secure a date for a Mass and celebration of Peter’s life at his beloved Holy Family Catholic Church\n\nCondolences/cards may be sent to the family\n\nat the following address:\n\n15527 Yorktown Drive, Dumfries, VA 22025\n\nGod Bless\n\nYour content goes here.
