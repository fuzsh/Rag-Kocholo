        "text": "West Coast Conference\n\nMen's Golf 5/1/2024 2:06:00 PM by Athletic Communications\n\nThree Waves Earn NCAA Regional Individual Bids\n\nMALIBU, Calif. – Three from the Pepperdine men's golf team will continue on with NCAA postseason play this season, as sophomores Mahanth Chirravuri and Brady Siravo and freshman William Walsh were selected as individual participants for the NCAA Rancho Santa Fe Regional following the NCAA's selection show on GOLF Channel Wednesday.\n\nThe regional is being hosted by West Coast Conference competitor San Diego at The Farms Golf Club from May 13-15.\n\nIn order of seeding, the individuals selected for the regional were Chirravuri, Tegan Andrews (Cal State Fullerton), Walsh, Siravo and Kevin Li (Seattle). The teams competing in the regional in order of seeding are Arizona State, Washington, Oklahoma, California, Oklahoma State, North Florida, Chattanooga, South Florida, San Diego, West Virginia, Kansas, Wright State, Seton Hall and Winthrop.\n\nThere are six 54-hole regional tournaments. Fourteen teams and five individuals not on those teams will compete at each of three regionals while the other three regionals will have 13 teams and 10 individuals not on those teams. The top five teams and low individual not on those teams from each regional will advance to the finals where the team and individual medalist titles will be decided.\n\nThe finals will be from May 24-29 at Omni La Costa Resort & Spa in Carlsbad, Calif. Texas is the host institution for the 2024 championships.\n\nThe five additional regional sites include:\n\n• Austin, Texas, at the University of Texas Golf Club (host Texas)\n\n• Baton Rouge, La., at the University Club (host LSU)\n\n• Chapel Hill, N.C., at the UNC Finley Golf Course (host North Carolina)\n\n• West Lafayette, Ind., at the Birck Boilermaker Golf Complex (host Purdue)\n\n• Stanford, Calif., at the Stanford Golf Course (host Stanford)\n\nChirravuri, Siravo and Walsh all recently garnered All-West Coast Conference first team honors. Chirravuri (Chandler, Ariz.) led the Waves with an impressive 71.23 scoring average through 31 rounds this season, which ranks 16th in the Pepperdine men's golf record books.\n\nSiravo (Sacramento, Calif.) won the West Coast Conference Championships individual title this season, marking his first collegiate win in the process. He has amassed a 73.42 scoring average this season.\n\nWalsh (San Mateo, Calif.) also tied for first in stroke play at the WCC Championships, marking his best collegiate finish to date, though finished tied for second after the playoff. Walsh has amassed a 72.39 scoring average this season, which currently ranks fifth in the Pepperdine seasonal freshmen records.\n\nThe Waves have sent individuals to the regional without competing as a team twice previously, in 2012 and 2014. In 2012, Pepperdine's Josh Anderson and Johnny MacArthur competed as individuals in the tournament. Anderson finished in first, which tied the program record for best-finish at a regional alongside current Pepperdine Head Coach Michael Beard (2000) and Joe Highsmith (2022). He then advanced to the NCAA finals where he finished tied for 37th.\n\nPepperdine individuals have advanced through the regionals to the finals without the Waves competing as a team eight times (1987, 1992, 1994, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2012, 2018). In fact, Pepperdine's best-ever individual finish came out of the 2005 season when Michael Putnam competed as an individual and finished in second-place. He was tied for first-place after 72-holes at the final, but lost in a three-hole playoff to Washington's James Lepp.\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\nBrady Siravo\n\n5' 8\"\n\nSophomore\n\n1V\n\nMahanth Chirravuri\n\n5' 10\"\n\nSophomore\n\nTR\n\nWilliam Walsh\n\n5' 9\"\n\nFreshman\n\nHS"
