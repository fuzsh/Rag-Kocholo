        "text": "Pros: Lightweight, stylish and durable, the Kikkor Selects are an excellent casual golf shoe for the money at $120 MSRP. Color schemes range from straightforward white or black to some more adventurous blue, black-and yellow and red patterns.\n\nCons: If you’re not into “street” style golf shoes, nothing about Kikkor’s offerings will sway you. Also, the shoe is well constructed, but the leather doesn’t feel as supple as others in the market.\n\nBottom Line: The secondary market of golf shoes is rapidly growing, but Kikkor’s Selects easily provides one of the best values. Even when taking price out of the equation, they are worth consideration for your wardrobe.\n\nOverview\n\nPlaying golf professionally can seem like an all-or-nothing, feast-or-famine sort of life at times. For every famous, fully-exempt and entrenched PGA Tour player, there are a few hundred who toil in the relative obscurity of the mini-tours, scrapping together a living for a time before bowing out and pursuing other work.\n\nCanadian James Lepp won the 2005 NCAA Championship while at the University of Washington and seemed destined to become part of the former group. But aside from a Canadian Tour victory in 2007, he never found enough success between the ropes to reach the game’s biggest stage with any regularity, save for an impressive run on “Big Break: Greenbrier” a couple years ago.\n\nThe Kikkor Selects series reflect founder James Lepp’s relaxed sense of style.\n\nBut whereas many struggling professional golfers turn away from the game — to insurance sales or a job with one of their corporate sponsors — Lepp stayed in the golf industry, founding Kikkor Golf in 2008. Lepp’s decision to make golf shoes was a great one for the feet of style-conscious golfers.\n\n“I always wondered why my golf shoes had to be so different than what I wore off the course,” said Lepp. “I always knew there was a market for it. We came out with our first model early in 2010, a few months before Fred Couples wore his infamous ‘sneakers’ while playing the Masters. That let everybody know that such a shoe exists. Now everybody seems to have a pair, whether they’re made by us, ECCO, FootJoy, Nike, Adidas, and on and on.”\n\nThe Selects are the newest of seven lines of shoes offered by Kikkor, which range from the fairly traditional Player line to the throwback Airstrip line, which more resemble Chuck Taylors than anything else. The Selects are more toward the Player end of the spectrum, but with the wider and more flat-bottomed look that has come to mark most entrants into the casual-looking golf shoe field.\n\nClick here to browse Kikkor Select’s men’s golf shoes.\n\nLooks\n\nI chose the “Black Indy” model, with a black full-grain leather upper, white outer sole and electric baby blue bottom and permanent spikes. Although flashier color schemes are available, a slightly conservative approach suited my liking. The Kikkor Selects line provides enough selection to appease attention-getters who want to make a statement with their footwear, but also those like me who prefer a more understated look.\n\nGolfers with classic tastes aren’t left out of the Kikkor club either. “Saddle” type shoes are offered in the yellow-black-gray color scheme, which provide a little extra flair in color scheme to the old-school style.\n\nFeel and Performance\n\nThe interior features of the shoe, from the tongue to the two sets of insoles—meant to optimize fit since the Selects only come in whole sizes—are soft and comfortable without feeling mushy. They are also wider than most, appealing to players that complain about the typically narrow fit of golf shoes. The delightful lightness of the shoes also helps cut down on foot fatigue throughout a round of golf or long practice session.\n\nThe biggest concern when wearing sneaker-like golf shoes is protection and performance in inclement or overly dry weather, but Kikkor puts those concerns at ease with great support and traction. The level of comfort allows them to be worn off the golf course as well. Hygiene issues aside, you could walk 18 holes wearing the Kikkor Selects, then catch dinner afterwards without feeling the need to change into more comfortable shoes.\n\nNote: It is important to avoid walking on too much rough pavement, as it will wear down the mini-spikes and shorten the life of any “spikeless” golf shoe.\n\nBottomline\n\nDollar-for-dollar, the Kikkor Selects are excellent all-around casual golf shoes. Many golfers have paid $200 or more for shoes that deliver no better performance than the Selects. James Lepp and Kikkor have made a strong case for you not to have to with a comfortable yet street-smart golf shoe, for $120 or less.\n\n[wrx_buy_now oemlink=”http://www.kikkor.com/mens-golf-shoes/” oemtext=”Learn more from Kikkor” amazonlink=”http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ISHBXMG/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00ISHBXMG&linkCode=as2&tag=golfwrxcom-20&linkId=JY5BVYHBDJANPPTA”]\n\nYour Reaction?\n\nLIKE5\n\nLEGIT1\n\nWOW3\n\nLOL0\n\nIDHT0\n\nFLOP0\n\nOB0\n\nSHANK2\n\nOn Monday evening, inside the swanky, second-story “Coach House” event center in the Palisades Village, just minutes down the road from the 2024 Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club, Tiger Woods and TaylorMade officially announced their new apparel/footwear/accessory line, called “Sun Day Red.”\n\nThe Sun Day Red website officially launched on Monday night during the event, and the products are set to go on sale starting May 1.\n\nThe “Sun Day Red,” or “SDR” name will be self-explanatory for most golf fans, since he’s been wearing a victory-red shirt on Sunday’s for his entire professional career, but Woods explained the meaning of Sun Day Red at the launch event:\n\n“It started with mom. Mom thought – being a Capricorn – that my power color was red, so I wore red as a junior golfer and I won some tournaments. Lo and behold, I go to a university that is red; Stanford is red. We wore red on the final day of every single tournament, and then every single tournament I’ve played as a professional I’ve worn red. It’s just become synonymous with me.”\n\nThe Sunday Red outfit has worked to perfection for his 82 PGA Tour victories, including 15 majors, so why not make an entire apparel line based on the career-long superstition?\n\nAs I learned at Monday’s launch event, the new Sun Day Red line includes much more than just clothing. To go along with a slew of different golf shirt designs and colorways, there were also windbreakers, hoodies, shoes, hats, headcovers, ball markers and gloves on display.\n\nThe upscale event was hosted by sports media personality Erin Andrews, with special guests David Abeles (CEO of TaylorMade) and Tiger Woods himself.\n\nAs explained by Abeles, the Sun Day Red brand is an independently-run business under the TaylorMade umbrella, and is based in San Clemente, California (rather than Carlsbad, where TaylorMade headquarters is located), and it’s run by a newly-formed, independent group. Brad Blackinship, formerly of Quiksilver and RVCA, is the appointed president of the new brand.\n\nAs for the logo itself, obviously, it’s made to look like a Tiger (the animal), and is comprised of 15 tiger stripes, which correspond with Woods’ 15 major championships. While the logo may need a 16th stripe if Woods adds a major trophy to his collection, it makes perfect sense for the time being.\n\nThe golf/lifestyle line is meant to combine premium precision and athletic comfort, while still having plenty of wearability and style off the course. Like Woods said on stage at the event, he wants to be able to go right from the course to dinner wearing Sun Day Red, and that was exactly the aesthetic on display at the event on Monday.\n\nFollowing the official announcement from Woods and Abeles, they revealed multiple pieces of clothing, accessories and footwear for the event-goers to ogle (and photograph).

Motocaddy was nice enough to get their M7 Remote and M5 GPS DHC in my hands to try out on the course for a few weeks.\n\nI have had a lot of people stop me to ask about the carts, and the one thing I keep telling them is that these carts are just flat out fun to use on the course.\n\nMotocaddy M7 Remote\n\nThe M7 Remote was very easy to get set up right out of the box. All you have to do is charge the battery, install the wheels, and you are pretty much ready to go. The M7 folds up pretty small, just a little larger than the 3-wheel pushcart that I had been using for years. Getting it to the course should be no problem with just about any trunk space. Now, the one downside to an electric cart is the weight when moving it around, and both carts come in at around 35 pounds each. Even with that extra weight, I didn’t have much trouble lifting them in and out of the back of a pickup.\n\nThe M7 unfolds quickly with the flick of two levers and extends the front wheels automatically. Once unfolded, you drop in the battery, plug it in, and secure your bag. If you own a Motocaddy bag, they have developed a really nice system called EasiLock that involves two metal studs that fit into the bottom of the cart. This system also includes a molded base that prevents the bag from rotating at all, even on the roughest terrain. You can still use the M7 with almost any other golf bag as it includes elastic straps that wrap around the top and bottom of the bag.\n\nAs soon as you plug in the battery the LCD screen comes to life and you are ready to go. You can use the M7 without the remote by using the dial on the handle to control the starting, stopping, and speed. But the M7 has a remote that is activated by a simple press of the power button to get going. The remote is very simple with just five buttons to control where the M7 goes.\n\nGetting a feel for the M7 takes no time at all and by the time you drive it from your car to the 1st tee you will be in complete, and confident, control of the cart. You simply press the “+” button to start moving forward and the cart takes off gently without any rattling of your clubs, and you can press that same button again to increase the speed. The cart will go from a slow crawl, for bumpy or tight areas, too, as fast as I could run with just a few presses of the button. The big red “stop” button in the center stops the cart immediately, and when stopped it is locked in place, even on steep hills. You don’t have to worry about remembering to set the brakes or anything because it is done automatically.\n\nSteering is just as easy: simply press the right or left button to turn the cart. Small, quick presses will just slightly adjust the cart as it moves down the fairway while a long hold of the button can make it turn on a dime to the right or left.\n\nAlmost everyone asked me how stable the cart was and if it would tip over. I can proudly say that it has stayed upright even on some unseen bumps at maximum speed. Side hills, ruts, and even curbs are handled with ease with the help of the small rear wheel.\n\nI really enjoy strolling down the fairway with nothing but the M7’s remote in my hand — it just makes golfing more fun!\n\nMotocaddy M5 GPS DHC\n\nAfter using the M7 and its fancy remote, I was a little nervous that I wouldn’t like not having it. But to be honest the M5 was just as fun to use, but for a different reason.\n\nAs the name suggests, the M5 has a built-in GPS with 40,000 courses preloaded into it. The screen is a good size, pretty responsive to the touch, and easy to read in direct sunlight. Having the GPS directly on the cart is great, you drive up to your ball and immediately have yardage to the front, back, and center of the green as well as bunkers and hazards. You can easily toggle between screens on the GPS and it offers a couple of different views to help navigate the hole. The M5 can also keep score and let you know shot distances right on the screen. Motocaddy even includes nice little touches like a screen protecter kit to ensure durability.\n\nDriving the M5 is just as easy as the M7 with using the dial on the handle. And speaking of the handle, the grips have a great tacky rubber that grips well even in hot and humid conditions. To start the M5 you just press the dial down and the cart will gently start down the fairway. You can turn the dial to increase or decrease the speed — I found between 5-6 to be the most comfortable for me. But the speed can go up to a very fast pace if you are looking to set a record for fastest round of the day.\n\nAs you walk down the fairway, or rough, stopping the cart is as simple as pressing he dial again. When stopped the M5 engages a parking brake automatically so you don’t have to worry about it running down a hill without your approval. The M5 has tons of power to go up just about any hill and the Down Hill Control (DHC) keeps the speed consistent even when going down a steep decent.\n\nSince the M5 has so much power, and it is a little heavy, I thought steering would be a little bit of a challenge. It wasn’t, at all. Guiding the M5 took very little effort and slight adjustments going down the fairway were very easy. Really tight turns took a slight bit more effort as the torque can want to go forward a little more than turn. Again, once you get the M5 from the car to the first tee, you will be a master at driving it.\n\nOverall, Motocaddy has created two great carts that provide additional enjoyment to walking your favorite 9 or 18. Having the ability to walk without carrying or pushing your bag, clubs, and whatever else goes with you. I like them so much that it is going to be hard to get the M7’s remote out of my hands when I go play!\n\nYour Reaction?\n\nLIKE46\n\nLEGIT12\n\nWOW7\n\nLOL2\n\nIDHT1\n\nFLOP5\n\nOB2\n\nSHANK7\n\nAn 18-hole round of golf averages out to just under five miles of walking, which on its own is a good workout. Once you throw in some potential uphill trekking you get some serious cardio too, but if you all looking for a quick workout between rounds of golf look no further than Crossrope.\n\nCrossrope – The details\n\nCrossrope is a system of the weighted jump rope that allows you to quickly switch the weight of the ropes you are using to boost your workout—they range from 1/4 lbs all the way up to 2 lbs depending on the kit you start out with. There is an accompanying app that helps you go through multiple workout routines and is available free, or you can upgrade to the entire library of workout routines along with more workout tracking options.\n\nThis is NOT your middle school jump rope\n\nThe handles are heavy duty and feature precision bearings to allow the rope to move smoothly around as you go through a routine. They are also ergonomic and fit into your hand naturally, which making gripping easy, something that is really nice when you’re swinging a 2 lbs coated steel cable around. The handles also come with a fast clip system to make changing cables depending on your selected workout easier too.\n\nThe ropes themselves are made from braided steel and are almost impossible to tangle, allowing them to be easily transported and stored when not in use. All in you are getting a premium piece of workout equipment that is effective and easy to store—hard to same the same thing about a treadmill.\n\nWhen it comes to a workout, skipping rope is one of the most effective cardio workouts you can do, and with Crossrope, you can get both cardio and low impact weight training when using the heaviest ropes, and follow along with the guided workouts.\n\nAs someone that hadn’t used a jump rope in over a decade, starting out lighter was a nice way to ease in before moving up, and I was pleasantly surprised how easy and fun some of the workouts in the app were. If you are looking for a fun way to add something to your workouts, or you just want to try something new to get you into golf course walking shape, this could be right up your alley.
