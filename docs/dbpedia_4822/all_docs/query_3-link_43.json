        "text": "NEWEST CANADIAN GOLFING PRO MAKES DEBUT IN HIS OWN BACKYARD...2005 NCAA Champion James Lepp Debuts Next Week At Canadian Tour Stop in Vancouver\n\nAfter a brilliant amateur golfing career, one that saw him become the first Canadian to win the NCAA championship in 2005, James Lepp of Abbotsford, British Columbia announced today that he is turning professional and will be teeing it up in his own backyard next week at the Canadian Tour's Greater Vancouver Charity Classic in his pro debut. Lepp also announced that he has signed with IMG Canada for his professional representation.\n\n\"This is obviously an exciting day for me and it makes it even better that I am able to play in front of family and friends in my professional debut at the Greater Vancouver Charity Classic,\" said Lepp. \"I look forward to working hard, earning my stripes as a pro, and one day representing Canada on the PGA Tour.\"\n\nLepp will be returning to the Canadian Tour's Vancouver stop, where he won the 2003 Greater Vancouver Classic by five strokes as an amateur, while IMG confirmed today his exemption from the RCGA to play in the 2006 Canadian Open in September at Hamilton Golf and Country Club.\n\n\"We're excited for James, but also for Canadian golf,\" said Dan Cimoroni, Vice President, IMG Golf. \"His many accomplishments as an amateur speak for themselves and we know that he is bound for stardom as a pro.\"\n\nCimoroni noted that Lepp's intention is to play the maximum number of PGA Tour exemptions allowed in 2006, seven, and that IMG is currently working to secure as many exemptions for him through the PGA Tour as possible.\n\nThe 22-year old Lepp made history in 2005 when he became the first Canadian, and the first player from the University of Washington, to win the NCAA Division I golf Championship after shooting a course-record, 7-under 63 in the final round at Caves Valley Golf Club. His impressive amateur career also saw him win the British Columbia Amateur Championship four straight years from 2002-2005, and in 2001, he won the Canadian Junior Amateur Championship by nine strokes. In 2003, Lepp won the Pacific Coast Amateur by 10-strokes and his 72-hole score of 263 beat the old record by seven strokes. His outing included a 62 that bettered the Capilano Country Club course record by two strokes."
