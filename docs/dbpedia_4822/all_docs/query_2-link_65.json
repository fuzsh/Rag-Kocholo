        "text": "NORMAN, Okla. ? Oregon’s Chris Dukeminier has been selected as a Golf Coaches Association of America All-America Scholar. He was one of only three Pac-10 golfers selected for the national honor, joining 2005 NCAA individual champion James Lepp of Washington and 2003 NCAA medalist Alejandro Canizares of Arizona State on the list.\n\nDukeminier, a junior from Eugene, Ore., owns a 3.43 grade point average in business administration. He played in 11 of 13 tournaments for the Ducks in 2004-05 and was sixth on the team with a 75.1 scoring average. His best finish was a tie-for 34th at the Western Intercollegiate and his career-low round of 69 came at the TaylorMade Waikoloa Intercollegiate.\n\n- www.GoDucks.com -"
