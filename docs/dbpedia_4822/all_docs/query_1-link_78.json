        "text": "In the last post, we discussed the different types of life insurance. In this post we will explore the benefits and disadvantages of life insurance in farm transition planning as well as strategies for using life insurance.\n\nThe Value of Life Insurance in Farm Estate Planning\n\nLiquidity for Estate Taxes and Debts:\n\nWhen a farm estate is passed on to the next generation, estate taxes and debts can create significant financial burdens. Life insurance provides the liquidity needed to cover these expenses, helping to prevent the forced sale of farm assets.\n\nEqualization Among Heirs:\n\nIn many farm families, not all heirs are involved in daily farm operations. Life insurance can be used to compensate non-farming heirs, ensuring fairness while preserving the farm for those who continue the operation.\n\nSuccession Planning:\n\nFor farmers transferring ownership of the farm to the next generation, life insurance can be a crucial part of succession planning. It provides the financial resources to buy out other heirs or business partners, ensuring a smooth ownership transition.\n\nProtection Against Loss:\n\nIn the event of the sudden death of a key family member, life insurance can provide the necessary funds to keep the farm operational during the transition period.\n\nDisadvantages of Life Insurance in Farm Estate Planning\n\nCost of Premiums:\n\nLife insurance, particularly permanent policies like whole or universal life, can be costly. The ongoing premium payments may strain the farming business, especially if cash flow is tight. Also, the premiums are not usually a deductible business expense.\n\nInsurability:\n\nNot everyone qualifies for life insurance. Individuals with pre-existing health conditions may be denied coverage. Additionally, as the applicant ages, premiums increase, potentially becoming unaffordable at some point.\n\nComplexity of Policies:\n\nPermanent life insurance policies, such as universal or variable life, can be complex and require careful management. Without proper oversight, these policies may lapse, resulting in the loss of coverage and forfeiture of premiums paid.\n\nLimited Cash Flow Benefits:\n\nWhile life insurance provides liquidity at death, it may not offer significant cash flow benefits during the policyholder's lifetime. Cash value accumulation can be slow, particularly in the early years.\n\nExamples of Using Life Insurance in Farm Transition Planning\n\nOff-Farm Heirs:\n\nAndy and Betty own Family Farms. Their son Chris has returned to manage the farm, while their daughter Darla has pursued a successful career elsewhere and is not involved in the farming operation. Andy and Betty have a net worth of $3 million, but most of it is tied up in the farm, leaving little liquid cash. They purchase a second-to-die policy for $1 million and name Darla as the beneficiary. Upon their deaths, Darla will receive the $1 million death benefit as her inheritance, while Chris will inherit the farm, ensuring he can continue the operation without financial strain. This plan balances the needs of both heirs, providing liquidity to the off-farm heir while preserving the farm for the on-farm heir.\n\nDebt:\n\nEd and Fran recently purchased a farm and owe $1 million on the property. They worry that if they die prematurely, the farm may struggle to meet the debt payments. To mitigate this risk, they purchase a second-to-die policy for $1 million. The death benefit will be used by their heirs to pay off the land debt, helping to secure the farm's future for the next generation. Any death benefit not needed to pay debt can go to their heirs.\n\nOwnership Buyout\n\nGeorge and Harry are brothers who own and operate Family Farms LLC. They expect to continue farming for another 10 years. If either George or Harry die while they are farming, they want the surviving brother to be able to continue the farming operation by buying out the deceased brother’s ownership. The LLC is valued at $2 million. The brothers want $1 million to go to their family upon their death but do not want to burden the other brother with $1 million of debt.\n\nGeorge and Harry purchase $1 million, 10-year term policies for each other. If either brother dies in the next ten years, the surviving brother will receive $1 million death benefit which will be used to buy the deceased brother’s ownership. The $1 million in sale proceeds will go to the deceased brother’s family. The surviving brother will not need to worry about taking on debt to make the buyout. By using term policies, George and Harry were able to provide buyout funds while keeping the premiums costs significant lower than a whole life, universal or variable policy.\n\nEffect on Estate Taxes\n\nThe death benefit of a policy is included in the estate of the policy owner. For example, if Ida owns a $1 million whole life policy which pays out to her beneficiaries upon her death, the $1 million death benefit will be included in her federal taxable estate. This presents a planning issue if life insurance is purchased to help pay estate taxes. Owning a life insurance policy will compound the estate tax liability of the estate.\n\nA relatively easy solution to this issue is to use an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT). With this strategy, an ILIT is established that will purchase the life insurance policy. The grantor of the trust will pay the premiums on behalf of the ILIT and beneficiaries. Because the ILIT owns the policy and not the grantor, the death benefit is not included in the grantor’s estate.\n\nContinuing the above example, Ida establishes an ILIT and the ILIT purchases a $1 million whole life policy. Ida pays the annual premiums on behalf of the ILIT. When Ida dies, the policy will pay $1 million to the ILIT. The ILIT will then distribute the $1 million to Ida’s heirs. The $1 million is not included in Ida’s taxable estate.\n\nConclusion\n\nLife insurance can be a valuable tool in farm estate planning and transition or succession planning, offering liquidity, equalization among heirs, and protection against financial hardship. However, it is essential to carefully weigh the pros and cons of different policies and consider the long-term costs and management responsibilities. Life insurance is not needed for every transition plan. Farmers should consult financial advisors, estate planners, and insurance professionals to determine how life insurance may or may not fit their specific needs and goals. When structured properly, life insurance can help ensure the farm remains a viable operation for future generations while also providing financial security for heirs.\n\nFarmers often face the challenge of being \"land rich, cash poor.\" While they may have significant wealth tied up in land and other assets, they can lack sufficient cash to cover expenses, taxes, or distributions when planning for the farm’s transition to the next generation. This \"land rich, cash poor\" dilemma can complicate farm transition and succession planning, creating potential obstacles for a smooth handover of the farm.\n\nLife insurance can provide a solution to this problem by introducing liquidity into an estate or trust, which can be used to cover expenses, taxes, and distributions to heirs. By incorporating life insurance into a farm transition plan, legal complexities and costs can be reduced, and the transition process can be streamlined. However, life insurance, like any estate planning tool, may be appropriate in some situations but not in others. This bulletin aims to explain different types of life insurance and how they can be used effectively in farm transition planning. Given the complexities of life insurance policies, it is essential to work with insurance and legal professionals to ensure that life insurance is appropriately included in your plan.\n\nTypes of Life Insurance Policies\n\nTerm Life Insurance:\n\nTerm life insurance provides coverage for a specific period (e.g., 10, 20, or 30 years). If the insured passes away during the term, the policy pays a death benefit to the beneficiaries.\n\nPros: Lower premiums compared to permanent life insurance; simple and straightforward; ideal for temporary needs like covering a mortgage or debt.\n\nCons: No cash value accumulation; coverage ends at the term’s expiration unless renewed, often at a higher premium; not ideal for long-term estate planning.\n\nWhole Life Insurance:\n\nWhole life insurance provides lifetime coverage with a guaranteed death benefit and includes a cash value component that grows over time. Typically, the premiums are fixed for the life of the policy.\n\nPros: Permanent coverage with a guaranteed death benefit; cash value can be accessed through loans or withdrawals; fixed premiums for the life of the policy.\n\nCons: Higher premiums compared to term life insurance; cash value grows slowly in the early years; limited flexibility in adjusting the death benefit or premiums.\n\nUniversal Life Insurance:\n\nUniversal life insurance offers permanent coverage with more flexibility than whole life. Policyholders can adjust premiums and death benefits within certain limits and earn interest on the cash value.\n\nPros: Flexible premiums and death benefits; cash value accumulation with potential for higher returns; can be tailored to specific estate planning needs.\n\nCons: More complex than whole life insurance; interest rates may fluctuate, affecting cash value growth; requires careful management to avoid policy lapse.\n\nVariable Life Insurance:\n\nVariable life insurance provides permanent coverage with investment options for the cash value. Policyholders can invest the cash value in various sub-accounts, such as stocks and bonds.\n\nPros: Potential for higher returns through investment options; tax-deferred growth of the cash value; permanent coverage.\n\nCons: Higher risk due to market exposure; policy performance depends on the chosen investments; requires active management and carries higher fees.\n\nDifference Between Universal Life and Variable Life Insurance\n\nUniversal life and variable life insurance are both types of permanent life insurance, but they differ in flexibility, investment options, and risk. Universal life offers adjustable premiums and death benefits, with cash value growth based on an interest rate set by the insurer. This makes it a more predictable option with lower risk, though it offers moderate growth potential as the cash value isn't directly tied to market performance. Variable life, on the other hand, requires fixed premiums but allows policyholders to invest the cash value in various sub-accounts, offering the potential for higher returns. However, it introduces greater risk as the cash value fluctuates with the market, and there’s no guaranteed minimum cash value. Variable life policies are also more complex, requiring active management and often incurring higher fees. In summary, universal life provides predictability and flexibility, while variable life offers the potential for higher returns with greater risk and complexity.\n\nSecond-to-Die Life Insurance Policy\n\nA second-to-die life insurance policy, also known as survivorship life insurance, covers two individuals, typically a married couple, and pays the death benefit only after both individuals have passed away.\n\nPros: Second-to-die policies generally have lower premiums than two individual life insurance policies since the insurer pays out only after both insured individuals have died, reducing their risk exposure. Additionally, they are often easier to obtain for couples where one partner has health issues, as the payout depends on both individuals passing away.\n\nCons: The death benefit is delayed until both individuals have passed, which may not provide financial assistance when the first spouse dies. This delay makes the policy less useful for covering immediate expenses or providing cash flow to the surviving spouse. Furthermore, second-to-die policies do not offer cash flow benefits during the policyholders' lifetimes, as the payout occurs only after death.\n\nIn the next post, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of life insurance as well as strategies to incorporate life insurance into a farm transition plan.\n\nThe costs of long-term care (LTC) continue to rise, creating potential financial risks for farmers who want to protect their farm assets for future generations. In the last two years alone, the cost of in-home care has increased by more than 20%, while nursing home costs have risen by 10% to 15%. According to the 2023 Genworth Cost of Care Survey, the following are the most recent costs of long-term care services:\n\nU.S., Home Health Aide: $75,552/year\n\nOhio, Home Health Aide: $73,212/year\n\nU.S., Nursing Home – Semi-private room: $104,016/year\n\nOhio, Nursing Home – Semi-private room: $100,380/year\n\nThese figures make it clear why long-term care costs are a significant risk to the continuity of the family farm. Even a short stay in a nursing home can incur substantial costs.\n\nAccording to data from the Administration for Community Living, individuals turning 65 have a 69% chance of needing some form of LTC, with an average of three years of care required. Typically, one of these three years is spent receiving at-home care provided by spouses or family members, one year in paid at-home care, and one year in a nursing facility. For farmers needing LTC, this equates to an average of approximately $180,000 in costs per person, and double that for a married couple. However, some individuals will require more than three years of care, which can cause LTC costs to increase significantly.\n\nMedicaid can help cover LTC costs, but it has stringent eligibility requirements. One major condition is that Medicaid limits the amount of assets an individual can own and still qualify for benefits. In Ohio, an unmarried person cannot own more than $2,000 of countable assets. Most farmers will not qualify for Medicaid without aggressive planning. Another critical factor is the five-year look-back period, during which Medicaid reviews any asset transfers made within five years of applying for coverage. If assets were gifted or transferred below market value during this period, Medicaid may impose penalties, delaying eligibility for benefits.\n\nGiven these costs, statistics, and Medicaid rules, it is crucial for farmers to explore strategies that can minimize the risk of LTC expenses depleting their farm assets. Here are some common strategies farmers can consider:\n\nGifting Assets: Transferring farm assets to family members while retaining enough to cover immediate needs can help reduce exposure to LTC costs. However, this strategy should be approached with caution, as it is subject to Medicaid’s five-year look-back period.\n\nIrrevocable Trusts: Placing farm assets in an irrevocable trust can protect them from being considered in LTC cost calculations, ensuring that the farm remains intact for future generations. However, this plan is also subject to Medicaid’s five-year look-back period.\n\nSelf-Insurance: Farmers with significant savings or assets may choose to self-insure by setting aside funds specifically for potential LTC expenses, thereby reducing the need to sell farm assets.\n\nLTC Insurance: Purchasing long-term care insurance can provide coverage for LTC costs, offering a buffer against the high expenses associated with nursing home or in-home care. However, LTC insurance can be expensive, and not everyone will qualify for coverage.\n\nWait and See: This strategy involves holding back enough assets to pay for five years of LTC while awaiting Medicaid eligibility.\n\nDo Nothing: Some individuals with adequate income to cover LTC costs may not need to take action to protect assets.\n\nCombining Strategies: Often, a combination of these approaches can provide the most robust protection, balancing immediate needs with the long-term preservation of farm assets.\n\nBy understanding the risks and costs of LTC and carefully considering these strategies, farmers can take proactive steps to help ensure their farm's legacy remains intact, even in the face of unforeseen health care costs. Always consult with legal and financial advisors to tailor the best approach for your specific situation.\n\nFor more information and a detailed discussion on LTC, see The Long-Term Care and the Farm publication available at farmoffice.osu.edu.\n\nThe Western Ohio Cropland Values and Cash Rents study was conducted earlier this year from January through April. This opinion-based study surveyed professionals with a knowledge of Ohio’s cropland values and rental rates. Professionals surveyed were rural appraisers, agricultural lenders, professional farm managers, ag business professionals, OSU Extension educators, farmers, landowners, and Farm Service Agency personnel. The study results are based on 131 surveys.\n\nRespondents were asked to group their estimates based on three land quality classes: average, top, and bottom. Within each land-quality class, respondents were asked to estimate average corn and soybean yields for a five-year period based on typical farming practices. Survey respondents were also asked to estimate current bare cropland values and cash rents negotiated in the current or recent year for each land-quality class. Survey results are summarized below for western Ohio with regional summaries (subsets of western Ohio) for northwest Ohio and southwest Ohio.\n\nResults from the Western Ohio Cropland Values and Cash Rents Survey show cropland values in western Ohio are expected to increase in 2024 by 3.3 to 5.8 percent depending on the region and land class. Cash rents are expected to increase from 3.2 to 3.8 percent in 2024 depending on the region and land class. Decreasing profit margins have competed with relatively strong farm equity positions and increasing property taxes to direct values and rents so far in 2024. Cropland values and cash rents are expected to increase although they are projected to be smaller increases than the past two years.\n\nFactors Important to Ohio Cropland Values and Cash Rents\n\nThe primary factors affecting these values and rents are land productivity and potential crop return, and the variability of those crop returns. Soils, fertility and drainage/irrigation capabilities are primary factors that most influence land productivity, crop return and variability of those crop returns.\n\nOther factors impacting land values and cash rents may include field size and shape, field accessibility, market access, local market prices, field perimeter characteristics and potential for wildlife damage, buildings and grain storage, previous tillage system and crops, tolerant/resistant weed populations, USDA Program Yields, population density, and competition for the cropland in a region. Factors specific to cash rental rates may include services provided by the operator, property taxes and specific conditions of the lease. This fact sheet summarizes the survey research data collected for western Ohio cropland values and cash rents:\n\nhttps://farmoffice.osu.edu/farm-management-tools/farm-management-publications/cash-rents\n\nProjected Estimates of Land Values and Cash Rents\n\nSurvey respondents were asked to give their best estimates for long-term land value and cash rent change. The average estimate of cropland value change in the next five years for western Ohio is an increase of 3.6 percent (for the entire five-year period). Responses for the five-year cropland value change ranged from an increase of 50 percent to a decrease of 50 percent.\n\nThe average estimate of cash rent change in the next five years is an increase of 2.7 percent. The cash rent change also had a large range, with responses ranging from an increase of 25 percent to a decrease of 50 percent.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nSurvey respondents were also asked to estimate 2024 interest rates for two borrowing terms: 20 year fixed-rate mortgage and operating loan. The average estimate, according to survey respondents, of 20 year fixed-rate mortgage borrowing is 7.1 percent. According to the same respondents, the average estimate of operating loan interest rates is 8.3 percent.\n\nThe full survey research summary can be found at the Farm Office website: https://farmoffice.osu.edu/farm-management-tools/farm-management-publications/cash-rents\n\nRecently, the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled on a unique and highly publicized case involving a bone found in a \"boneless\" wing. This case has drawn significant attention due to its peculiar subject matter and the broader implications it holds for consumer protection and food labeling practices. It exemplifies the delicate balance the law must strike between protecting business interests and ensuring consumer safety.\n\nCase Background\n\nIn April 2016, Michael Berkheimer ordered boneless wings at Wings on Brookwood, a restaurant in Butler County. Berkheimer cut each boneless wing into smaller pieces before eating. After consuming one piece, he experienced discomfort in his throat. In the following days, he developed a fever and nausea, prompting a visit to the emergency room. Doctors discovered a 1 1/2-inch chicken bone lodged in his throat, resulting in heart and lung damage and a partially paralyzed diaphragm. In 2017, Berkheimer sued the restaurant owners, as well as the chicken supplier and processor. The case was eventually appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio.\n\nLegal Concepts at Issue\n\nThe Court of Appeals previously determined that the bone was a natural part of chicken and thus the restaurant did not breach its duty of care to its customer. The Appeals Court essentially decided that consumers should recognize the inherent risk of bones in chicken, regardless of how the product is labeled.\n\nConversely, Berkheimer argued that a reasonable person would not expect a bone in a boneless wing and, therefore, would not think to inspect the meat for bones. He contended that the restaurant and supplier were negligent by offering a food product labeled as boneless while knowing it could contain bones or bone fragments. Mr. Berkheimer appealed the matter to the Ohio Supreme Court.\n\nThe Court's Decision\n\nIn a 4-3 decision, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled in favor of the restaurant. The court concluded that while the term \"boneless wings\" might not be entirely accurate, it did not constitute negligence under Ohio law. The court noted that \"boneless wings\" is a commonly accepted descriptor for a specific type of chicken product, and reasonable consumers are unlikely to be misled by this term.\n\nThe court also emphasized the importance of context in labeling disputes. They found that the restaurant's menu and advertising provided sufficient context for consumers to understand what they were purchasing. However, the court suggested that businesses should strive for greater clarity in their labeling practices to avoid potential confusion.\n\nImplications and Future Considerations\n\nThe ruling in this case has significant implications for the food industry and consumer protection efforts. It highlights the ongoing tension between industry practices and consumer expectations, particularly in the realm of food labeling.\n\nFor businesses, the case underscores the importance of transparency and clarity in product descriptions. While the court ruled in favor of the restaurant chain, it also suggested that more accurate labeling could help prevent similar disputes in the future.\n\nFor consumers, the case serves as a reminder to scrutinize product labels and ask questions when in doubt. As food labeling practices continue to evolve, consumer awareness and vigilance will be crucial in ensuring that businesses maintain honest and transparent practices.\n\nThis case sets a precedent for how courts might handle similar disputes in the future, emphasizing the need for clear communication between businesses and consumers to avoid misunderstandings and ensure consumer safety.\n\nFeatured Discussion on the Downward Trend in Global Profitability of Crop Farming and a Bearish Outlook for 2024\n\nDuring its annual conference from June 10th to 14th, the agri benchmark Cash Crop Network discussed recent developments in global crop production. I was fortunate to recently attend the agri benchmark conference in Valladolid, Spain. The conference was hosted by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture who together with its operating company Tragsa, established and manages a network of 37 typical crop farms. Approximately 55 international experts from all over the world discussed recent results and topical issues of global crop production.\n\nThe Ohio State University College of Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences is a member of the agri benchmark network and I serve as the network representative for the College. The following are a few selected highlights from the conference.\n\nLast year (2023) was difficult for most typical agri benchmark farms when compared with previous, more profitable, years. Increasing machinery cost and lower output prices many farms experienced a massive downturn in return to land.\n\nThe projections for 2024 for the agri benchmark network, which is coordinated by the German Thünen Institute, are even more bearish. The likely relief provided by lower fertilizer prices will not fully compensate for the increase in machinery costs. In addition, based on global price projections, farm-gate production prices are likely to be lower in 2024 than in 2023. Many typical farms are likely to struggle with returns in 2024.\n\nUS renewable diesel boom – how US soybean production may increase\n\nA number of U.S. states have implemented blending targets for renewable fuels. As a result, renewable diesel production has increased substantially. By 2029 this will lead to an annual demand of 8 million tons of soybean oil renewable diesel production (FAPRI-MU, 2024), a 3-million-ton increase in demand relative to 2020. The respective supply can be generated through more domestic crushing or an increase of soybean acreage; most likely, a combination of both options will be used. To satisfy this increased demand for soybean oil via expansion of soybean acreage, about 5.1 million ha (+15% of current soybean acreage) of additional farmland would be required. An increase in soybean acreage may come from either (a) shifting away from continuous corn rotations to corn-soy and (b) shifting corn-soy rotations toward corn-soy-soy. Based on agri benchmark data, Margaret Lippsmeyer from Purdue University showed that option (a) would require an increase in soybean prices of 6% and option (b) of 8% to make these rotations preferable over existing ones.\n\nUkraine grain exports: No specific effects on Central & Eastern European farm-gate prices\n\nAt the national level, agri benchmark farm-gate data did not yield an indication that growers in Central and Eastern Europe have been suffering from the inflow of Ukrainian grain. As the graph attached indicates, respective wheat margins between Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe actually narrowed. However, agri benchmark partners mentioned that in regions close to the Ukrainian border lower than usual prices have been observed.\n\nEU sugar production: Expanding and rather profitable in 2023\n\nDue to high EU sugar prices in 2022, EU production increased by 7% in 2023. Therefore, the EU became a net exporter again. Since global sugar prices were still rather high, the negative impact on domestic prices was low. Thomas de Witte from Thünen Institute stated that profitability of sugar beet production was extraordinarily high – an advantage of 1.000 to even 2.000 €/ha over other crops could be observed. A possible future cut of 15 to 30 €/t in beet prices (or 20% to 40%) would still make beets competitive at wheat prices of 230 €/t.\n\nRegenerative agriculture – a promising option to reduce environmental footprint?\n\nThe members of the agri benchmark Network discussed the concept and the environmental claims of regenerative agriculture. Many industry leaders and politicians are promoting this idea to address public concerns regarding agriculture; influential global consulting companies try to educate growers regarding the profitability of suggested measures such as cover crops and no-till. One discussion focused on the notion that proponents of regenerative agriculture oversell the potentials, in particular regarding greenhouse gas savings and economics. Furthermore, the two major sources for GHG emissions – nitrogen use and land use change – are not addressed. Considering these shortcomings, the network will be publishing a thesis paper on this topic and will suggest more meaningful indicators to define goals that effectively reduce GHG emissions and reduce pressure on biodiversity.\n\nagri benchmark, a nonprofit, politically independent organization, provides comprehensive information and advice on crop production systems.
