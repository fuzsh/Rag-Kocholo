Minnesota's Antti Ahokas and Arizona State's Niklas Lemke finished two strokes back. Northwestern's Chris Wilson (Dublin, Ohio/Coffman) and Arizona State's Alejandro Canizares, the first Big Ten/Pac-10 Challenge winner and 2003 NCAA champion, both finished 3-under and four strokes behind Merkow.\n\nAfter opening the final round with an eagle on the par-5 first hole, Merkow ran into trouble on No. 3 and 4, where he recorded back-to-back double bogeys. But after those two holes, he played flawless golf the remainder of the round, notching seven pars and six birdies.\n\n\"David just played some tremendous golf against a tremendous field,\" said Goss. \"I'm really proud of the way he performed and maintained his composure after a couple tough holes.\"\n\nWilson fired a 1-under 71 and moved from seventh to fifth on the final day. His birdie on his final hole helped the Wildcats seal their team championship over the Gophers.\n\nNorthwestern received strong final rounds from seniors Dillon Dougherty (Woodland, Calif./Woodland) and Bryson Young (Reno, Nev./Galena), who both carded 1-over 73's. Dougherty finished 23rd with a 4-over 220 (73-74-73) and Young placed 35th at 7-over (74-76-73=223). Sophomore Dan Doyle (Rochester, Mich./Stoney Creek) placed 35th as well with a 7-over 223 (70-75-78).\n\nNorthwestern's Kyle Moore (Dublin, Ohio/Scioto), who was participating as an individual, fired an even-par 72 on Tuesday and placed 53rd (79-77-72=228).\n\nIn the conference challenge, the Big Ten Conference defeated the Pacific-10, and evened the series at 1-1. Each conference counted its six low scores for each round."
