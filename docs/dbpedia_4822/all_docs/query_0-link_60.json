In his first year at Idaho as the associate head coach, he helped Ben Weyland earn second team All-WAC honors; a first for the Vandals’ program. Reehoorn was elevated to head coach following the 2008 season and promptly watched as his first recruit, Jarred Bossio, was selected WAC Freshman of the Year in 2009. The Vandals ended his first season as head coach with its best ranking in eight seasons.\n\nPrior to his stop in Moscow, Reehoorn spent three seasons as the assistant coach at the University of Washington. During his time with the Huskies, he coached four All-Americans, eight All-Pac-10 selections and seven Pac-10 All-Academic selections. In his first year at Washington in 2005, the Huskies won the Pac-10 Championship and finished third at the NCAA Championships. In addition, Erik Olson won the individual title at the conference tournament and James Lepp won a playoff at the national championships to earn the individual title. In 2006, the Huskies finished runners-up at the Pac-10 Championships and ninth at the NCAA Championships.\n\nAs an athlete, Reehoorn walked-on at Washington State before ultimately earning a scholarship during his record-setting playing career for the Cougars. Reehoorn set the school’s single-season scoring average at 72.0 as a senior after notching six top-10 finishes and 12 top-25’s. He was also the team captain of WSU’s first golf team to advance to the NCAA Championships. He wrapped up his career at WSU with 14 top-10 finishes, 28 top-25 finishes and was named to the All-Pac-10 Second Team and the PING Pacific All-Region team. Outstanding in the classroom as well, Reehoorn was a three-time Pac-10 All-Academic performer and was awarded a Pac-10 post-graduate scholarship.\n\nReehoorn earned a Bachelor of Arts in Communication from Washington State in 2002 and added a Master’s of Science in Sport Administration from the University of Louisville in 2004.\n\nReehoorn and his wife, Meghan, live in Corvallis and have a daughter, Zoë, and son, Hudson."
