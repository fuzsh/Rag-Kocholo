        "text": "One of the world’s most celebrated novelists of the 20th century, Vladimir Nabokov was also a devoted lepidopterist. Cornell alumni are invited to explore this fascinating story in a new exhibit in the Mann Library Gallery. During his time as professor of Russian literature at Cornell (1948-1959), Nabokov collected and hand-labelled hundreds of butterfly specimens from across the United States, eventually donating them to the Cornell University Insect Collection (CUIC). In a collaboration between Mann Library and the CUIC, this exhibit features a selection of Nabokov’s extraordinary butterfly collection and celebrates Nabokov’s passion for the study of Lepitoptera as witnessed in his fanciful and scientific butterfly illustrations, his careful taxonomic work, and the insightful scientific theories in butterfly evolution he developed—theories largely dismissed during his lifetime but spectacularly confirmed in recent years.\n\nIn an article written for The New Yorker in 1948, Vladimir Nabokov described vivid childhood memories of his thrilling encounters in a dusty corner of his family’s home with old, and fantastically beautiful natural history tomes of prior centuries. These were works that helped lay the foundation for the modern study of entomology and introduced humankind—including a young Russian boy who would become one of the most consequential novelists of the 20th century—to the mesmerizing beauty of the order Lepidoptera. A new exhibit in the Mann Library lobby introduces a selection of the volumes that guided Nabokov’s lepidopterist interests and helped shape his important contributions towards our current understanding of butterfly diversity and evolution.\n\nThis exhibit showcases some of the accomplishments of James E. Turner (1940-2022). He was a pioneer in the field of Black Studies and the founding director of the Africana Studies and Research Center at Cornell University. Cornell is considered the birthplace of Africana Studies; a term Dr. Turner coined to conceptualize the comprehensive studies of the African diaspora and describe the multidisciplinary analysis of the lives and thoughts of people of African throughout the world. Many of the materials on display are on loan from the Turner family.\n\nWitnessing a total solar eclipse is one of the most humbling experiences that mother nature has to offer. Watching the sun disappear can be frightening if it comes unexpected and glorious if it unfolds as predicted. The mini-exhibit Solar eclipses across the world: from fear to knowledge showcases materials from Cornell’s Rare and Manuscript Collection, taking us on a 1,800-year journey from the first book that gives prescriptions for how to calculate upcoming eclipses, to the famous book by Copernicus, to photos of the eclipse of 1925 as seen from Cornell.\n\nDr. Joyce Brothers '47 was omnipresent in American media for over 50 years. A natural-born entertainer, she was first and foremost a mental health professional—often referred to as “the mother of media psychology”—who sought to do the most good for the largest number of people. This exhibit is a selection of materials highlighting the life and career of one of the most prolific professionals and celebrities of the last century. The exhibit was made possible through the generous support of the Stephen E. ’58 MBA ’59 and Evalyn Edwards ’60 Milman Exhibition Fund, with additional contributions from the Brothers family.\n\nBonsai is the ancient art of growing and grooming trees in pots for the appreciation of their beauty. This art form, a wonderful merging of art, horticulture, and nature, began at least 1,500 years ago when it captivated the passion of many in Asian countries. Today, bonsai is appreciated throughout the world. This exhibit at the Nevin Welcome Center features a variety of unique trees cultivated by members of the Finger Lakes Bonsai Society, including maple, pine, elm, spruce and juniper.\n\nThis is an immersive full-day wine tour for people who are looking for a truly behind-the-scenes personalized experience unlike anything else available in the Finger Lakes. We take you to two family-owned wineries on the east side of Cayuga Lake, where you will receive owner-guided experiences, private, curated wine tastings paired with local cheese and chocolate. This tour includes experiences at Heart & Hands Wine Company, Long Point Winery, and lunch and a flight of beers at Aurora Brewing Co.\n\nThis award-winning documentary shows the parallel lives of two very different people. The Artist, wife of Cornell Football head coach, Jack Musick, gives great insights into campus life during the challenging times of Cornell in the late 60’s and early 70’s. In contrast, through the Astronaut’s career, we can follow the heady days of the early space program at NASA. Because of Jack Musick’s untimely death in 1977, and a divorce 1000 miles away, the Artist and Astronaut eventually “discover” each other in Houston. The evolution of the Artist’s work had embraced increasingly cultural issues, while Jerry Carr, Commander of Skylab IV, found a meaningful post-NASA role in partnering with the Artist. This film has a unique Cornell connection, within the large contexts of the social and political turmoil of the 60’s, the race in space, and the sensitive environmental themes in the artwork of Pat Musick Carr. Includes Q&A panel with the film’s director Bill Muench, composer Todd Hobin, Artist Pat Musick PhD ’74, and Jeff Carr, son of Astronaut Jerry Carr, moderated by Mary Berens ’74.\n\nCelebrate Ithaca’s cultural heritage! Take a walk along downtown Ithaca and explore the wonders of the city’s natural and cultural heritage.

While at Cornell, where he taught Russian literature from 1948 to 1959 and wrote fiction that would gain him world-wide fame, Nabokov immersed himself in the exacting science of lepidoptery, gathering an extensive collection of butterfly specimens from across the United States that he eventually donated to the Cornell University Insect Collection (CUIC). Two new exhibits at Mann Library, “From Nabokov’s Net” and “No Mere Curios” explore this fascinating story. In a guided tour of these installations, Mann librarians will team up with exhibit co-curators Corrie Moreau (CUIC director and the Martha N. and John C. Moser Professor of Arthropod Biosystematics and Biodiversity at Cornell) and Jason Dombroskie (CUIC manager and coordinator of the Insect Diagnostic Lab) to spotlight Nabokov’s contributions to lepidoptery, his important specimen collection, and the old and exquisitely illustrated rare books known to have inspired his lifelong involvement with questions of butterfly evolution and diversity. Cornell alums are warmly invited to join us for a family-friendly multimedia event rich in butterfly science and beauty—all ages welcome!\n\nCo-sponsored with the Cornell University Insect Collection (CUIC) of the Dept. of Entomology.\n\nBonsai is the ancient art of growing and grooming trees in pots for the appreciation of their beauty.

The mini-exhibit Solar eclipses across the world: from fear to knowledge showcases materials from Cornell’s Rare and Manuscript Collection, taking us on a 1,800-year journey from the first book that gives prescriptions for how to calculate upcoming eclipses, to the famous book by Copernicus, to photos of the eclipse of 1925 as seen from Cornell.\n\nDr. Joyce Brothers '47 was omnipresent in American media for over 50 years. A natural-born entertainer, she was first and foremost a mental health professional—often referred to as “the mother of media psychology”—who sought to do the most good for the largest number of people. This exhibit is a selection of materials highlighting the life and career of one of the most prolific professionals and celebrities of the last century. The exhibit was made possible through the generous support of the Stephen E. ’58 MBA ’59 and Evalyn Edwards ’60 Milman Exhibition Fund, with additional contributions from the Brothers family.\n\nOne of the world’s most celebrated novelists of the 20th century, Vladimir Nabokov was also a devoted lepidopterist. Cornell alumni are invited to explore this fascinating story in a new exhibit in the Mann Library Gallery. During his time as professor of Russian literature at Cornell (1948-1959), Nabokov collected and hand-labelled hundreds of butterfly specimens from across the United States, eventually donating them to the Cornell University Insect Collection (CUIC). In a collaboration between Mann Library and the CUIC, this exhibit features a selection of Nabokov’s extraordinary butterfly collection and celebrates Nabokov’s passion for the study of Lepitoptera as witnessed in his fanciful and scientific butterfly illustrations, his careful taxonomic work, and the insightful scientific theories in butterfly evolution he developed—theories largely dismissed during his lifetime but spectacularly confirmed in recent years.\n\nIn an article written for The New Yorker in 1948, Vladimir Nabokov described vivid childhood memories of his thrilling encounters in a dusty corner of his family’s home with old, and fantastically beautiful natural history tomes of prior centuries. These were works that helped lay the foundation for the modern study of entomology and introduced humankind—including a young Russian boy who would become one of the most consequential novelists of the 20th century—to the mesmerizing beauty of the order Lepidoptera. A new exhibit in the Mann Library lobby introduces a selection of the volumes that guided Nabokov’s lepidopterist interests and helped shape his important contributions towards our current understanding of butterfly diversity and evolution.\n\nSelections from the Law Library's special collections and archives will be on display. This will include photos and memorabilia from your student days, available for your perusal. Also during this time, you will see exhibits including medals awarded to Myron Taylor, the library’s collection of Supreme Court bobbleheads, and an exhibit on the model train from the Scottsboro trials. Please note that no food or drinks are permitted within the Edwin S. Dawson Room.\n\nFor the past decade, Ross Brann, the Milton R. Konvitz Professor of Judeo-Islamic Studies, Stephen H.

He will also address the ways in which education remains the best vehicle for combatting hate.\n\nJoin Cornellians and members of Ithaca community for a celebration of the life and legacy of Dr. James E.

A natural-born entertainer, she was first and foremost a mental health professional—often referred to as “the mother of media psychology”—who sought to do the most good for the largest number of people. This exhibit is a selection of materials highlighting the life and career of one of the most prolific professionals and celebrities of the last century. The exhibit was made possible through the generous support of the Stephen E. ’58 MBA ’59 and Evalyn Edwards ’60 Milman Exhibition Fund, with additional contributions from the Brothers family.\n\nOne of the world’s most celebrated novelists of the 20th century, Vladimir Nabokov was also a devoted lepidopterist. Cornell alumni are invited to explore this fascinating story in a new exhibit in the Mann Library Gallery. During his time as professor of Russian literature at Cornell (1948-1959), Nabokov collected and hand-labelled hundreds of butterfly specimens from across the United States, eventually donating them to the Cornell University Insect Collection (CUIC). In a collaboration between Mann Library and the CUIC, this exhibit features a selection of Nabokov’s extraordinary butterfly collection and celebrates Nabokov’s passion for the study of Lepitoptera as witnessed in his fanciful and scientific butterfly illustrations, his careful taxonomic work, and the insightful scientific theories in butterfly evolution he developed—theories largely dismissed during his lifetime but spectacularly confirmed in recent years.\n\nIn an article written for The New Yorker in 1948, Vladimir Nabokov described vivid childhood memories of his thrilling encounters in a dusty corner of his family’s home with old, and fantastically beautiful natural history tomes of prior centuries. These were works that helped lay the foundation for the modern study of entomology and introduced humankind—including a young Russian boy who would become one of the most consequential novelists of the 20th century—to the mesmerizing beauty of the order Lepidoptera. A new exhibit in the Mann Library lobby introduces a selection of the volumes that guided Nabokov’s lepidopterist interests and helped shape his important contributions towards our current understanding of butterfly diversity and evolution.\n\nJoin us for a guided tour of this plant display and exhibit that includes dozens of plants that were grown and used by enslaved Africans and their descendants in the Americas. This garden installation and exhibit illustrate the deep connections enslaved Africans in the Americas had with plants that provided medicines, materials, and supplements to their often-meager food rations, and how today the plants provide joy and hope to generations of descendants of the enslaved and enrich the cuisines enjoyed across American society.\n\nThis exhibit showcases some of the accomplishments of James E. Turner (1940-2022). He was a pioneer in the field of Black Studies and the founding director of the Africana Studies and Research Center at Cornell University. Cornell is considered the birthplace of Africana Studies; a term Dr. Turner coined to conceptualize the comprehensive studies of the African diaspora and describe the multidisciplinary analysis of the lives and thoughts of people of African throughout the world. Many of the materials on display are on loan from the Turner family.\n\nVisit the Johnson Museum to explore the temporary exhibition Armonía de la Esfera (Harmony of the Sphere) before it closes after Reunion weekend. This show focuses on Guadalupe Maravilla, transdisciplinary visual artist, choreographer, teacher, mutual-aid organizer, and healer, as he pairs his most recent installations with works on paper, historical sculpture, and narratives recently collected from migrants held in immigration detention centers.\n\nGuadalupe's personal story of migration—born in 1976, he fled war-torn El Salvador alone at eight years old—and subsequent battle with cancer profoundly informs his work, which spans sculpture, painting, drawing, video, and performance and touches upon themes of migration, trauma, and healing.\n\nAdmission to the Johnson Museum is always free.\n\nOften recognized as one of the greatest literary figures of the 20th century, Vladimir Nabokov was also from early childhood impassioned by a very different subject: butterflies. While at Cornell, where he taught Russian literature from 1948 to 1959 and wrote fiction that would gain him world-wide fame, Nabokov immersed himself in the exacting science of lepidoptery, gathering an extensive collection of butterfly specimens from across the United States that he eventually donated to the Cornell University Insect Collection (CUIC). Two new exhibits at Mann Library, “From Nabokov’s Net” and “No Mere Curios” explore this fascinating story. In a guided tour of these installations, Mann librarians will team up with exhibit co-curators Corrie Moreau (CUIC director and the Martha N. and John C. Moser Professor of Arthropod Biosystematics and Biodiversity at Cornell) and Jason Dombroskie (CUIC manager and coordinator of the Insect Diagnostic Lab) to spotlight Nabokov’s contributions to lepidoptery, his important specimen collection, and the old and exquisitely illustrated rare books known to have inspired his lifelong involvement with questions of butterfly evolution and diversity. Cornell alums are warmly invited to join us for a family-friendly multimedia event rich in butterfly science and beauty—all ages welcome!\n\nCo-sponsored with the Cornell University Insect Collection (CUIC) of the Dept. of Entomology.\n\nWitnessing a total solar eclipse is one of the most humbling experiences that mother nature has to offer. Watching the sun disappear can be frightening if it comes unexpected and glorious if it unfolds as predicted. The mini-exhibit Solar eclipses across the world: from fear to knowledge showcases materials from Cornell’s Rare and Manuscript Collection, taking us on a 1,800-year journey from the first book that gives prescriptions for how to calculate upcoming eclipses, to the famous book by Copernicus, to photos of the eclipse of 1925 as seen from Cornell.\n\nBonsai is the ancient art of growing and grooming trees in pots for the appreciation of their beauty. This art form, a wonderful merging of art, horticulture, and nature, began at least 1,500 years ago when it captivated the passion of many in Asian countries. Today, bonsai is appreciated throughout the world. This exhibit at the Nevin Welcome Center features a variety of unique trees cultivated by members of the Finger Lakes Bonsai Society, including maple, pine, elm, spruce and juniper.\n\nEnjoy this opportunity to visit the Cornell Lab of Ornithology with your family and friends, introduce them to the wonderful world of birds, and take them on our foot-friendly trails and boardwalks through Sapsucker Woods.

The Artist, wife of Cornell Football head coach, Jack Musick, gives great insights into campus life during the challenging times of Cornell in the late 60’s and early 70’s. In contrast, through the Astronaut’s career, we can follow the heady days of the early space program at NASA. Because of Jack Musick’s untimely death in 1977, and a divorce 1000 miles away, the Artist and Astronaut eventually “discover” each other in Houston. The evolution of the Artist’s work had embraced increasingly cultural issues, while Jerry Carr, Commander of Skylab IV, found a meaningful post-NASA role in partnering with the Artist. This film has a unique Cornell connection, within the large contexts of the social and political turmoil of the 60’s, the race in space, and the sensitive environmental themes in the artwork of Pat Musick Carr. Includes Q&A panel with the film’s director Bill Muench, composer Todd Hobin, Artist Pat Musick PhD ’74, and Jeff Carr, son of Astronaut Jerry Carr, moderated by Mary Berens ’74.\n\nWhat’s new with Cornell’s impressive and ever-growing Human Sexuality Collection?
