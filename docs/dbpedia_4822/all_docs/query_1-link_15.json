        "text": "One coast and one week apart, the Cordevalle Tournament, hosted\n\nby the UCLA men’s golf team this past Monday and Tuesday, was\n\na big change from their match last week in Florida where Hurricane\n\nWilma halted play for an entire day.\n\nNot only were there clear skies, but when the two-day Cordevalle\n\nevent came to an end, a first-place finish out of 16 teams was a\n\nwelcome change for the Bruins, who finished in 11th place last\n\nweek.\n\nWhile Northwestern led by two strokes after 36 holes on Monday,\n\nUCLA came through with a solid 18-hole performance the next day to\n\nwin the tournament by a margin of six strokes.\n\nAll five of the Bruin participants contributed to the win, each\n\nplacing in the top 25 out of more than 80 players.\n\n“It was the first time that we’ve ever hosted the\n\ntournament,” said coach O.D. Vincent.\n\n“We did have our team retreat at the Cordevalle course\n\nearlier this season. There is no question that the retreat helped\n\nour win, because it was nice to have the course be a little more\n\nfamiliar.”\n\nThe team’s top finisher, freshman Erik Flores, placed\n\nsecond overall with a score of 4-under par.\n\nNot far behind were his teammates freshman James Lee and\n\nsophomore Daniel Im, tied for fourth place.\n\nAlso representing UCLA was junior Chris Heintz, who scored\n\n1-over par, and just one stroke away from him was freshman Lucas\n\nLee.\n\nJunior Peter Campbell said the team was excited about the\n\nCordevalle Tournament because of the immense booster support.\n\n“All of the players at the tournament performed extremely\n\nwell, as shown by our win,” said Vincent.\n\nJust a week before Cordevalle, five members of the team arrived\n\nin Florida amid rumors that a hurricane might hit on day two of\n\ntheir three-day tournament.\n\n“The officials were good about taking all the precautions\n\nnecessary,” said Vincent.\n\nThe match was ultimately changed so the teams could all take off\n\na day while the hurricane swept through Orlando.\n\n“On Monday, it was blowing a gale out there and none of us\n\nhad ever been in a hurricane before,” said Campbell.\n\n“We weren’t in any danger, but we were staying at the\n\nDisney World Resort, and they closed all the rides down at Disney\n\nWorld when the hurricane came.”\n\nA week later at the hurricane-free tournament in San Martin, six\n\nof the teams that competed were from the Pac-10 conference,\n\nincluding UCLA, Cal, Stanford, Arizona, USC and Washington.\n\nAll five of the UCLA men fared better than defending NCAA\n\nchampion James Lepp from the University of Washington, who also\n\nparticipated in the tournament.\n\n“Since we were in charge of the tournament, we decided to\n\ninvite a lot of our conference schools, including Washington, where\n\nI used to coach and play,” said Vincent.\n\n“Washington was also a great candidate because of the fact\n\nthat they have a top-10 program.”\n\nThe tournament was greatly supported by UCLA alumnus and former\n\nBruin baseball player Jack Gifford."
