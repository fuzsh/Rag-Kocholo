        "text": "KOHLER, WIS. â€“ Georgia State men's golfer Steve Tiley was named to the PING Honorable Mention All-America Team as announced by the Golf Coaches Association of America on Friday, June 10. Tiley becomes only the third Georgia State men's golfer to earn All-America honors, joining senior Ty Harris and former standout Kasper Jorgensen on that list. Both Harris and Jorgensen were honorable mentions last year. Tiley was one of 30 golfers named to the honorable mention team.\n\nThe junior transfer from Southeastern Louisiana played a vital role in Georgia State making its second consecutive NCAA Championship appearance where the Panthers finished tied for 13th among the 30 team competition. Tiley broke the school record for lowest single season stroke average (71.55) and ended with a national ranking of 38th in the Golfweek/Sagarin Ratings. The Canterbury, England, native, recorded top-25 finishes at both the NCAA East Regional (T25th, 212) and NCAA Championships (T24th, 289). He was named to the Atlantic Sun All-Conference First Team after Georgia State won its fourth league title and earned A-Sun Golfer-of-the-Month honors three times during the season.\n\nTiley was previously named to the PING All-Southeast Region Team and competed in the prestigious Palmer Cup for the European team. He won two tournaments in his first year as a Panther and finished in the top-25 in all but two events. Tiley holds the lowest third-round score in school history with a 64 and has the second lowest three-round tournament score in program history with a 198.\n\nDivision I PING All-America Teams:\n\nFirst Team\n\nRyan Blaum, Duke\n\nRoberto Castro, Georgia Tech\n\nRhys Davies, East Tennessee State\n\nMatt Every, Florida\n\nAnthony Kim, Oklahoma\n\nJames Lepp, Washington\n\nSpencer Levin, New Mexico\n\nPablo Martin, Oklahoma State\n\nRyan Moore, UNLV\n\nAron Price, Georgia Southern\n\nMichael Putnam, Pepperdine\n\nSecond Team\n\nOscar Alvarez, Brigham Young\n\nDavid Denham, Georgia\n\nKalle Edberg, Augusta State\n\nJohn Holmes, Kentucky\n\nChris Kirk, Georgia\n\nTyler Leon, Oklahoma State\n\nJeff Overton, Indiana\n\nChan Song, Georgia Tech\n\nNicholas Thompson, Georgia Tech\n\nBrendon Todd, Georgia\n\nThird Team\n\nMark Anderson, South Carolina\n\nAlejandro Canizares, Arizona State\n\nDustin Johnson, Coastal Carolina\n\nJ.J.
