        "text": "Ardmore, Pa. – Medalist James Lepp, 21, of Canada, made winning birdies on the last two holes to overtake Kyle Reifers, 21, of Columbus, Ohio, to become one of the 32 golfers who won first round matches Wednesday at the U.S. Amateur at Merion Golf Club.\n\nThe current Division I NCAA champion, Lepp came back from two holes down to defeat USA Walker Cup team member Reifers by hitting a wedge to 3 feet on the first extra hole and sinking the birdie. But while Reifers wasn’t successful, five of his Walker Cup teammates were able to advance to Thursday’s second round of matches. They were Brian Harman, 18, of Savannah, Ga.; Billy Hurley, 23, of Leesburg, Va.; Nicholas Thompson, 22, of Coral Springs, Fla.; Matt Every, 21, of Daytona Beach, Fla.; and Anthony Kim, 20, of LaQuinta, Calif.\n\n\"When I hit the wedge in, I thought, ‘Oh, it looks good,’\" said Lepp, who is a senior at the University of Washington. \"It felt good. It just spun down the hill perfectly. I didn’t feel real great with the putter today, so it was nice to have that close right-edge putt.\n\n\"I felt like I had the momentum and I was going to win this match.\"\n\nIn addition, three members of the Great Britain and Ireland were winners, including 16-year-old Oliver Fisher of England, who defeated USA Walker Cupper Lee Williams, 5 and 3. His teammates who are still alive are Rhys Davies, 20, of Scotland, and 44-year-old Gary Wolstenholme of England.\n\nThree U.S. Mid-Amateur champions also advanced. They were Austin Eaton, 36, of North Sutton, N.H. (2004); Nathan Smith, 27, of Brookville, Pa. (2003); and George Zahringer, 52, of New York, N.Y. (2002), the oldest player left in the field. In a match of contrasts, Zahringer will face Fisher at 8:30 a.m. (EDT) in the second round.\n\n\"I don’t know how I fit in,\" said Eaton, who is in the house construction business with his father. \"This is uncharted territory for me. Normally, I’m used to playing against guys with jobs.\"\n\nFisher wasn’t the youngest to advance, however. Arnond Vongvanij of Bradenton, Fla., who is three months younger, took that honor after he survived in his match against Tyler Hitchcock, 18, of Clermont, Fla., despite making bogey on the first extra hole. In all, there five matches went extra holes.\n\nPlay continues Thursday with the second and third round matches at the 6,846-yard championship course and runs through Sunday. The winner earns spots in the next U.S. Open, British Open and Masters Tournament.\n\nThe Amateur is one of 13 national championships conducted annually by the United States Golf Association, 10 of which are strictly for amateurs. The Amateur is the Association’s oldest championship, first played in 1895.\n\nStory written by Craig Smith, Director of Media Relations for the USGA.
