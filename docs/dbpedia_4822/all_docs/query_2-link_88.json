Entering 2022-23 he has led ASU to its best NCAA finishes since 1996 with a tie for third in 2021 and last season's runner-up finish to Texas.\n\nLast season (2021-22) saw the Sun Devils make a fantastic run to the finals of the NCAA Championship, have another Sun Devil (Preston Summerhays) win Pac-12 Newcomer of the Year and watch four Sun Devils earn All-America honors for the second straight year while also racking up three team tournament wins, including the NCAA Stockton Regional.\n\nThe 2020-21 season saw two tournament titles in a condensed season with the squad earning a NCAA match play win for the first time, as well as its best finish (tied for third) since it won the 1996 NCAA title. ASU had four GCAA All-Americans, with three of returning in 2021-22 and the other (Chun An Yu) earning a spot on the Korn Ferry Tour through the PGA Tour University program. The spring of 2021 was the busiest five months in the history of Sun Devil men's golf with the cancellation of fall golf in the Pac-12, as the Sun Devils played 41 rounds of golf in 136 days, starting on Jan. 17 with a win at the inaugural Copper Cup and finishing with a tough NCAA match play semifinal loss to top-ranked Oklahoma on June 1. In between much happened as ASU competed in Arizona, California, Hawaii, Texas, Florida and Georgia. The team notched four All-Americans for the first time since 2009, and its NCAA finish (tied for third) was its best since it won the 1996 title.\n\nHis Sun Devils were hot and ready to make a run at postseason trophies in 2020 with three titles, including the highly competitive Cabo Collegiate, but when the Corona Virus canceled the NCAA spring season and the chance to win the NCAA title at Grayhawk Golf right up the road, reality hit and goals were changed.\n\n\"I'm just still so humbled every day to be able to represent Sun Devil Golf, coach these amazing players, and build this program,\" says Thurmond. \"I love doing it and I love seeing and feeling the growth in momentum in any and all areas of our program and especially in our players. I'm more confident than ever in the brightness of the Sun Devil Golf future. Talking about it with our players, recruits, and supporters gives me a rush because it is real and they can all feel it.\"\n\n“Our program is about our student-athletes,” Thurmond has said. “I’m here to serve and help them and to establish a culture where they can achieve their biggest dreams and have the best four years of their lives. We work hard, have fun, improve and build meaningful relationships with the entire ASU Golf Family.\"\n\n\"Coach Thurmond was not just a coach for my four years, he became a really good friend of mine and has an important role in my career. He is willing to do anything for his players throughout their career\" -- PGA Tour Golf and Washington Husky C.T. Pan.\n\nIn his first season, he guided a young Sun Devil squad to the NCAA Championships, as ASU was the only team to have three freshmen in the lineup. Along the way the team won the 2016 Alister MacKenzie Invitational, the 2017 Thunderbird Invitational and had senior Jared du Toit earn second-team All-America honors. He saw Chun An Yu, du Toit and Ki Taek Lee all win individual tournaments. The winning and accolades have continued since.\n\n\"It has been a few really productive years for our program. We've continued to build a foundation that can sustain decades of success. Our Thunderbirds Golf Complex and Phil and Amy Mickelson Player Development Facility have transformed our program. Our players are improving fast as they practice really effectively. It has also brought our team closer together as they spend so much time there together working, studying, relaxing, exercising, and competing. Recruits can feel it and want to be a part of it.\"\n\nTHE PHIL AND AMY MICKELSON PLAYER DEVELOPMENT FACILITY/THUNDERBIRDS GOLF COMPLEX\n\n--A Look At Sun Devil Golf’s Art Gallery (by Maddyn Johnstone-Thomas, sports360AZ.com/Oct. 2, 2020)\n\n--Inside the coolest practice facility in college golf, home of the Arizona State Sun Devils (by Josh Berhow/Golf.com/April 3, 2020)\n\n\"We are really excited about our tournament, the Thunderbird Collegiate, and its growth into one of the top collegiate golf events. Hosting three straight NCAA Championships is a unique opportunity to showcase our program and this amazing golf community as well. Our community continues to be more and more involved in our program. Many people are donating to help us win, following the team in our different tournaments, opening up their doors for our team to play their courses, and just passionately following and advocating for Sun Devil Golf. Our team represents the entire Sun Devil Golf Family and we love to see the pride that our fans, alums, and supporters have in our players. We want them to be very proud of everything our program represents, both on and off the course. Our student-athletes continue to perform well in the classroom and on the course while being good citizens as well.\"\n\nThurmond, who spent the previous 15 seasons at Washington, created a perennial national championship contending program for the Huskies. With 12 total NCAA Championship appearances, Thurmond’s teams averaged a ninth-place national finish, including seven top-10 finishes. The 2009 Golfweek National Coach of the Year and two-time Pac-12 Coach of the Year (’05, ’09), Thurmond coached Washington to three conference titles in 2005, 2009, and 2010.\n\nHe also knows how to hire. Currently five former assistant coaches are leading Division I men's golf programs: Armen Kirakossian (UCLA), Van Williams (Wofford), Jon Reehoorn (Oregon State), Garrett Clegg (Utah) and Michael Wilson (Long Beach State) while Dan Potter led Boise State to impressive wins before stepping away after the 2021-22 season.\n\n“Matt Thurmond’s background at Washington and his record of success was right in line with the direction we were headed with the men’s golf program when we were looking for our next head coach,” Ray Anderson said at the time of his hiring. “He embraces the concept of family and the success that community can bring to a program. Beyond his ability to coach top-level talent, his skill at directing capital projects and fundraising within the golf community remains invaluable in establishing our program’s home at Papago Golf Course.”\n\nAn impressive recruiter, Thurmond has coached three No. 1- ranked world amateurs. In 2010, NCAA Championship runner-up Nick Taylor won the McCormack Award and the Ben Hogan Award, as did Chris Williams in 2012. CT Pan, the top-ranked amateur in 2013, also finished as the NCAA Championship runner-up in 2015 as a senior. Thurmond coached James Lepp to the 2005 Individual National Championship, the first Husky to win the NCAA title. While at Washington, Thurmond coached 25 All-Americans including eight first-team honors.\n\n\"Matt is one of the most competitive people I know,\" says Taylor. \"We had success because we loved to have fun, at the same time no one wanted to win more. He has a great perspective on life and golf which makes you give it your all when you're playing for his team.\"\n\n“I thanked President Crow, Ray Anderson, the Arizona Board of Regents, Scottie Graham, and Don Bocchi right away for entrusting me to lead the ASU men’s golf program. I was inspired by their vision and leadership.\"\n\nThurmond led the fundraising for, and helped direct, Washington’s multi-million dollar Husky Golf Center and “The Playground” practice facility. He coordinated the concept, funding, and construction of the cutting edge, eight-acre practice facility and team center.\n\nThurmond began his coaching career at Washington as an assistant coach to OD Vincent and Mary Lou Mulflur in 2000, before taking over the men’s golf program at the age of 26 in 2001. Prior to UW, Thurmond served one season as an assistant coach for BYU.\n\nHe leads an Arizona State program that has won 12 Pac-12 titles since joining the Pac-10 Conference in 1978-79, the most of any program in that time. ASU won national titles in 1990 and 1996 under head coaches Steve Loy and Randy Lein, respectively. Individually, nine Sun Devil golfers have won 11 Pac-12 individual titles, and four players have won six NCAA individual titles. Recently, Jon Rahm, who graduated in the spring of 2016, became the first two-time winner of the Ben Hogan Award.\n\nThurmond graduated from BYU where he was a four-year letterwinner for the Cougar golf program (1993-99) and was named Western Athletic Conference Freshman of the Year in 1994. Thurmond is joined at Arizona State by wife Kathryn and their three daughters.\n\nCOACH THURMOND NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP FINISHES (UPDATED THROUGH 2022-23)\n\n2023: T-5th (lost in quarterfinals of NCAA
