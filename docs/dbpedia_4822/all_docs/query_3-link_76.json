        "text": "7/21/2006\n\nKansas City, MO. — Vanderbilt rising sophomore Jon Curran will participate in the 2006 U.S. Amateur following his play in the Sectional Qualifier in Kansas City. The U.S. Amateur will be held at the Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minn. August 21-27.\n\nCurran, a native of Hopkinton, Mass. shot a 68 and a 71 for a 36 hole total of 138, putting him four under par. The total allowed Curran to claim medalist honors at the qualifier.\n\n“This feels incredible,” Curran said. “It could have been so easy to return home empty handed, but it feels a whole lot better to be able to move on.”\n\nJon played in the No. 2 spot this past season for the Commodores. His best finish came at the Mason Rudolph Championships where he finished second behind teammate Luke List. He had a 73.2 stroke average for the year and finished tied for 44th place in the Southeastern Conference Championships.\n\n“We are going to have a great season next year,” Curran said. “With a new coach (Tom Shaw) it will give us a fresh new look and feel. Nothing bad can come from this season.”"
