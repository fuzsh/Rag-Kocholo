        "text": "Graham DeLaet isn't the only Canadian professional golfer making his 2011 debut this week. James Lepp is also playing his first tournament. The difference is that there's a good chance Lepp won't play another tournament this year, by choice.\n\nDeLaet, of course, has been recovering from back surgery that he had at the start of the year. He was Canada's top player on the 2010 PGA Tour and is checking his game and his back out at this week's Nationwide Tour event in College Park, Md. The 29-year-old from Weyburn, Sask., will see how he feels before deciding whether he'll play another Nationwide Tour event next week, or rejoin the PGA Tour at its tournament in Memphis.\n\nLepp, meanwhile, is playing the $200,000 Times-Colonist Island Savings Open at the Uplands club in Victoria. He's the founder of the cool, casual, hip Kikkor shoe company that launched last year. Lepp didn't like the traditional, heavy golf shoe that, well, isn't cool, casual and hip. So he came up with the Kikkor shoe. It's light and it's fun and it's even catching on with older golfers. The shoe got a lot of buzz at the PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando last winter. I stopped by for a visit. It was all business, sure, but it was also all fun.\n\n\"Do we really have to wear dress shoes on the course?\" That's a question on the Kikkor website. Good question. The answer is no. The Kikkor shoe is also the answer.\n\nAnyway, Lepp is also a heck of a golfer. He can, well, kick you know what on the course. He won the B.C. Amateur from 2002-2005. He won the Canadian Tour's Greater Vancouver Classic in 2003 when he was an amateur and in 2007 as a pro. In the middle he became the first Canadian to win the individual title at the NCAA Division 1 tournament. He was attending the University of Washington.\n\nBut Lepp eventually decided he was more into business and the competition there than life as a tour player. It's not that he didn't like the competition in tournaments. In fact, he relished it. But he had trouble with an inner competition. Lepp is one of those golfers who thinks too much on the course - no fault of his own, just his nature. His mind races sometimes.\n\nThe result was that he was afflicted with the yips from time to time, right through his bag. It could happen anytime, on a three-footer or a drive. His highly wired, overactive brain went into overdrive, and his game went sideways.\n\nStill, as he wrote in an e-mail this week, this week's tournament has treated him well in the past - he lost in a playoff three years ago - and he loves Vancouver Island. He's been playing more than he usually does, although his business is going very well. It's growing. It's keeping him busy.\n\nBut then there's golf. There's his ability, which is obvious.\n\n\"The game feels decent,\" he wrote. \"If I can keep the ball in play, within the tree line, I'll do just fine. I think what I miss most is hanging with all the friends that I have on the Tour. It's nice to catch up.\"\n\nBut the young man who founded Kikkor is also after something else. He's a professional golfer, right?\n\n\"At the end of the day, though, I still wanna kick their ass in the tournament,\" he said. \"We'll see what happens.\"\n\nIf his mind stays quiet, Lepp could kick some butt and make some noise. Wearing Kikkors, of course.\n\nALSO FROM LORNE RUBENSTEIN:\n\nFast and no fuss golf\n\nIs Weir ready to play his best golf now?\n\nHale Irwin sends a message\n\nThese are Donald's days\n\n---"
