        "text": "The Washington Huskies endure nasty weather to maintain a three-stoke lead; Oklahoma State freshman Jonathan Moore takes over the individual lead\n\nSUNRIVER, Ore. --- The Washington Huskies maintained a three-stoke lead at minus-7 and are one of only four teams that remain under par after a soggy third round at the 109th NCAA Division I Men’s Golf Championships at Crosswater Club. Oklahoma State, tied for second place with Wake Forest and Arizona State at 4 under, made a big jump, led by tournament leader Jonathan Moore, a redshirt freshman.\n\nMoore fired a 3-under 69 on the par-72 course, giving him a 9-under 207 for the tournament. Despite a consistent downpour and windy conditions, Moore carded a 33 on the front nine on Friday. He had five birdies on the day, with his only blemish being a double bogey on the par-5, 687-yard 12th.\n\n“I’m very excited,” said Moore, whose team shot even par on Friday to make up nine strokes on the Huskies. “I’m excited about the move we made as a team. I think the rain is exactly what our team needed, being as far back as we were after yesterday. We wanted people to get pushed out of their comfort zone to hopefully let us make a move like we did today.”\n\nWashington, who led by three strokes after the second round, combined for a 5-over 294 and sits at 857 for the tournament, just ahead of the Cowboys, Demon Deacons and Sun Devils at 860.\n\nUW senior James Lepp, the defending national champion, was the only Husky to score in the red on Friday with a 1-under 71.\n\n“I hate playing in the rain,” said Lepp, who is tied for fifth place at 5 under (211). “I always seem to not feel so good over the ball, which happened today, so I’m very pleased with a 71.”\n\n“We don’t like the rain any more than anybody else,” Washington head coach Matt Thurmond said. “You have to have the attitude that whatever comes your way, you’re going to make the most of it. It was sloppy today and I think we did a good job gutting it out.”\n\nMinnesota and Lamar are tied for fifth with a three-day total of 865 (+1). The Gophers combined to shoot a 287 (+4) on Thursday, while the Cardinals were 2 over par (292).\n\nWake Forest senior Kyle Reifers, who led the field after the first and second rounds, was 1 over (73) on Friday and one stroke back of Moore in second place at 208 (-8).\n\n“I didn’t shoot myself in the foot today, and I just kind of grinded it out,” Reifers said. “I think I have a very good chance tomorrow. If you get down to the final six holes and you’re right in contention, anything can happen.”\n\nOSU sophomore Pablo Martin is a stroke back in third place after shooting a 71 (-1). Martin is 7 under (209) for the tournament despite closing his round with a double bogey on the 18th hole.\n\nAndrew Parr, a Texas A & M senior who fired a 3-under 69 this morning, is alone in fourth place at minus-6 (210), while UW senior Zach Bixler is tied for fifth with Lepp, ASU senior Alejandro Canizares, Coastal Carolina junior Dustin Johnson, and Georgia Tech freshman Cameron Tringale at 211 (-5). Johnson and Tringale took advantage of calmer and drier conditions in the afternoon to shoot a 2-under and 4-under, respectively.\n\nTexas Tech freshman Brandon Lakatta had the tournament’s first hole-in-one when he aced the par-3 3rd. Lakatta started his round with two birdies before carding a one on the 183-yard hole. He finished with a 77.\n\nAfter regulation play, two teams ended in a knot for 15th place and the final berth in the final round. Brigham Young and Coastal Carolina each finished the day with a total team score of 15 over, requiring a one-hole playoff from all five golfers on both teams to decide who would advance to the final round. Brigham Young earned the berth after carding a better aggregate score.\n\nAdvancing to the fourth round is Washington, Oklahoma State, Arizona State, Wake Forest, Minnesota (865), Lamar (865), Clemson (866), Florida (867), Georgia (869), Texas A&M (870), Arizona (870), UCLA (870), Kentucky (870), Duke (871) and Brigham Young (874).\n\nFour out of the eventual six individual qualifiers have advanced from teams that did not make the cut. Tringale (Georgia Tech, -5), Johnson (Coastal Carolina, -5) advanced without a playoff, while Stephen Lewton (NC State) and Ray Sheedy (Charlotte) sit at even par and solidified spots after a seven-golfer playoff which lasted up to dark.\n\nZach Byrd (Coastal Carolina), James Love (Denver) and Taylor Wood (Southern California) will open Saturday at 7 a.m. in a one hole playoff to determine the final two individuals. Dustin Pimm (Utah) and Florian Fritsch (South Carolina) were eliminated on the first and third playoff holes, respectively.\n\nFollowing the playoff, tee times are scheduled to begin at 8 a.m."
