        "text": "TEMPE, Ariz. – Arizona State University has named the University of Washington's Matt Thurmond as the 14th head coach for the ASU's men's golf program, Vice President for University Athletics and Athletics Director Ray Anderson announced today.\n\n\"Matt Thurmond's background at Washington and his record of success is right in line with the direction we are headed with the men's golf program,\" Anderson said. \"He embraces the concept of family and the success that community embeddedness can bring to a program. Beyond his ability to coach top-level talent, his skill at directing capital projects and fundraising within the golf community will prove invaluable in establishing the program's future home at Papago Golf Course.\"\n\nThurmond, who spent the past 15 seasons at Washington, created a perennial national championship contending program for the Huskies. With 12 total NCAA Championship appearances, Thurmond's teams averaged a ninth-place national finish, including seven top-10 finishes. The 2009 Golfweek National Coach of the Year and two-time Pac-12 Coach of the Year ('05, '09), Thurmond coached Washington to three conference titles in 2005, 2009, and 2010.\n\n\"I'm the subject of today's announcement, but our program will be about our student-athletes,\" Thurmond said. \"I'm here to serve them and to establish a culture where they can achieve their biggest dreams and have the best four years of their lives. We'll work hard, have fun, improve, and build meaningful relationships with the entire ASU Golf Family.\n\n\"Coach Mickelson did an excellent job as head coach and he and the team accomplished some great milestones, while also setting up the program for continued success in the future. He and I have been close colleagues for a long time and it's an honor to step into his shoes.\"\n\nAn impressive recruiter, Thurmond coached three No. 1- ranked world amateurs over the last six years. In 2010, NCAA Championship runner-up Nick Taylor won the McCormack Award and the Ben Hogan Award, as did Chris Williams in 2012. CT Pan, the top-ranked amateur in 2013, also finished as the NCAA Championship runner-up in 2015 as a senior. Thurmond coached James Lepp to the 2005 Individual National Championship, the first Husky to win the NCAA title. Overall, Thurmond has coached 25 All-Americans including eight first-team honors.\n\n\"I want to thank President Crow, Ray Anderson, the Arizona Board of Regents, Scottie Graham, and Don Bocchi for entrusting me to lead the ASU men's golf program,\" Thurmond said. \"I'm inspired by their vision and leadership, and I can't wait to get to work.\"\n\nThurmond led the fundraising for, and helped direct, Washington's multi-million dollar Husky Golf Center and \"The Playground\" practice facility. He coordinated the concept, funding, and construction of the cutting edge, eight-acre practice facility and team center.\n\nThurmond began his coaching career at Washington as an assistant coach to OD Vincent and Mary Lou Mulflur in 2000, before taking over the men's golf program at the age of 26 in 2001. Prior to UW, Thurmond served one season as an assistant coach for BYU.\n\n\"I want to thank the University of Washington and my Husky Golf Family, my family and I will forever be humbly indebted and grateful,\" Thurmond said.\n\nThe Arizona State men's golf program has won 12 Pac-12 titles since joining the Pac-10 Conference in 1978-79, the most of any program. ASU also won national titles in 1990 and 1996 under head coaches Steve Loy and Randy Lein, respectively. Individually, nine Sun Devil golfers have won 11 Pac-12 individual titles, and four players have won six NCAA individual titles. Recently, Jon Rahm, who graduated this past spring, became the first two-time winner of the Ben Hogan Award.\n\nThurmond graduated from BYU where he was a four-year letterwinner for the Cougar golf program (1993-99) and was named Western Athletic Conference Freshman of the Year in 1994. Thurmond is joined at Arizona State by wife Kathryn and their three daughters.\n\nASU MEN'S GOLF HEAD COACHES\n\nAaron McCreary, 1931\n\nJoe Selleh, 1932\n\nEarl Pomeroy, 1940\n\nBill Quinn, 1948-1949\n\nAl Onofrio, 1952-1956\n\nJohn Zuchowski, 1958\n\nFrancis E.
