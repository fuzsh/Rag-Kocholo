        "text": "April 24, 2006\n\nRancho Mirage, Calif. - The Cal men's golf team is currently eighth after the first two rounds of the 2006 Pac-10 Championship, played at the Canyons Course of the Bighorn Golf Club (par 71, 7,009 yards) in Rancho Mirage, Calif. The Golden Bears shot a two-round team score of 743 (371, 372, +33), but Oregon and Arizona were not able to complete the second round due to darkness and will finish Tuesday morning. Freshman George Gandranata was Cal's top first-day finisher, currently tied for 16th with a two-over 144 (72, 72).\n\nUCLA, guided by sophomore Daniel Im and junior Chris Heintz, finished and started strong to lead after a 12-hour, 36-hole first day that was cut short by darkness. The Bruins, one of eight teams to complete play, followed an opening round 349 (-6) with a second-round 348 (-7) for a 697 (-13), which included a combined 10-under effort on their final three holes (7-9).\n\nThat enabled UCLA to take the lead back from Washington, which had vaulted into first early in the second round. The Huskies, led by juniors Erik Olson and Alex Prugh and senior James Lepp, barely finished before night fell. Still, the Huskies, the 2005 Pac-10 title winner, played well enough to sit firmly in second at 6-under (704).\n\nArizona was in third at 7-over, but still has a handful of holes to finish, as does Oregon. USC was fourth at 718 (+8) and was followed by Stanford (727, +17) and Arizona State (727, +17), Oregon State (730, +20), California (743, +33), Washington State (745, +35) and Oregon (+40).\n\nIm finished in first with a 135 (-7) after a 67 (-4) and 68 (-3). Washington's Erik Olson, the 2005 Pac-10 individual champion, was two back at 137 (-5), tied with Arizona State's Niklas Lemkes, who opened with a 66 (-5). Heintz checked in with a 139 (-3), tied with Prugh, who had a first-round best 65 (-6).\n\nCal's other participants at the Pac-10's include sophomore Freddy Wolfe, who is tied for 27th with a four-over 146 (74-72); sophomore Michael Jensen, who is tied for 38th with a seven-over 149 (74-75); freshman Romain Payet, who is tied for 48th with a 10-over 152 (77-75); junior Michael Wilson, who is tied for 54th with a 12-over 154 (76-78); and freshman Larry Wong, who is tied for 57th with a 14-over 156 (75, 81).\n\nRound 2 will be completed on Tuesday at 7:30 AM for Oregon and Arizona.\n\nRound 3 Starting Times- #1 TEE Teams 5 & 6 will tee off 9:30-10:10AM Teams 3 & 4 will tee off 10:18-10:58AM Teams 1 & 2 will tee off 11:06-11:46AM Round 3 Starting Times- #10 TEE Teams 7 & 8 will tee off 9:50-10:30AM Teams 9 & 10 will tee off 10:38-11:18AM\n\nTeam Leader Board Course: The Canyons at Bighorn Golf Club : Pac-10 Championship Par 71 - 7009 yards\n\ncurrent position start team scoring all rnds total score to par thru today 1 2\n\n1 1 UCLA -13 F -7 349 348 697 2 2 Washington -6 F -3 352 352 704 3 4 Arizona +7 15 - 18 +2 360 +2 - 4 6 Southern California +8 F -1 364 354 718 T5 3 Stanford University +17 F +14 358 369 727 T5 7 Arizona State U. +17 F +5 367 360 727 7 5 Oregon State U. +20 F +14 361 369 730 8 T8 California, U. of +33 F +17 371 372 743 9 T8 Washington State U. +35 F +19 371 374 745 10 10 Oregon, U. of +40 15 - 18 +22 373 +22 -\n\nPlayer Leader Board Course:The Canyons at Bighorn Golf Club: Pac-10 Championship Par 71 - 7009 yards\n\nposition player team scoring all rnds total score current start to par thru today 1 2\n\n1 T3 Daniel Im UCLA -7 F -3 67 68 135 T2 2 Niklas Lemke Arizona State U. -5 F E 66 71 137 T2 T3 Erik Olson Washington -5 F -1 67 70 137 T4 T8 Chris Heintz UCLA -3 F -2 70 69 139 T4 1 Alex Prugh Washington -3 F +3 65 74 139 T6 T29 Tyler Ley Southern California -1 F -4 74 67 141 T6 T46 James Lepp Washington -1 F -6 76 65 141 T6 T18 Ben Fox Arizona -1 F -2 72 69 141 T9 T8 Jeremiah Oliver Oregon State U.
