I’ll keep a list of those pieces + my responses here.\n\nGoogle DeepMind’s new Gemini model looks amazing—but could signal peak AI hype, Melissa Heikkiläa and Will Douglas Heaven, MIT Technology Review, December 6, 2023\n\nMy remark about Gemini being pitched as an \"everything machine\" gets misconstrued in the lede. This is not a good thing: \"everything machines\" are effectively impossible to evaluate and therefore not effective or appropriate technology. They eventually quote me as saying that much further down, but the lede is misleading.\n\nWhat Is An AI Hallucination?, Ellen Glover, builtin, October 2, 2023.\n\nUnfortunately, this article seems to be written from the perspective that the output of LLMs is a potentially valuable information source that (under the right circumstances) should be trusted.\n\nCan AI Replace Your Doctor?, Serena McNiff, theSkimm', August 2, 2023.\n\nNo, absolutely not. Using \"AI\" for gathering health information is a terrible idea. And you can tell the poor quality of this journlism by the fact that they include a quote from ChatGPT at the end (as if they had interviewed it). I regret speaking to this journalist.\n\nDe kruistocht van Emily Bender: Taal is ons ding, Marja Pruis, De Groene Amsterdammer, July 12, 2023.\n\nI was not interviewed for this piece and there are many cases where the author mis-represents my views.\n\nThe AI Apocalypse: A Scorecard.
