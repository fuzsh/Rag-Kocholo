Lepp needed to work a little overtime to survive a local qualifier at The Home Course in Dupont, Wash. After posting an even-par round of 72, Lepp had to survive a seven-man playoff for the final two of seven spots that were up for grabs.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAbbotsford’s James Lepp survives first qualifier in U.S. Open quest Back to video\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nHe now advances to sectional qualifying on June 8. If Lepp gets through that, he earns a spot in the field at Chambers Bay, the links course overlooking Puget Sound near Tacoma that will play host to the U.S. Open from June 18-21.\n\nLepp turned pro after a brilliant amateur career that included the 2005 NCAA Championship while he was earning a business degree at the University of Washington. He had some early success as a pro, but struggled with the mental side of his game.\n\nLepp has had an on-and-off relationship with the game in recent years and has devoted most of his energy to running his online golf shoe and apparel business, Kikkor Golf.\n\nThe fact the U.S. Open is being played nearby influenced his decision to try to qualify.\n\n“I guess the fact the U.S. Open is local made everyone think about it a little more this year and I haven’t tried to qualify for a while,” Lepp said Tuesday. “I figured why not?\n\n“I have never played it (Chambers Bay). I have been on the grounds before and had a chance to play it, but it was kind of snowing and I decided I’d rather not.”\n\nLepp, who does not play a whole lot of golf these days, warmed up for Monday’s qualifier in a rather unique way.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“I just had my stag in Palm Desert,” said Lepp, who is getting married in July.\n\n“So I played all last weekend and then I was practising a little bit after that. I don’t practise that much and I actually practised quite a bit one day and I tore my hands apart so I couldn’t hold a club for a couple of days … But it ended up working out OK.”\n\nThe Home Course, long and wide open off the tee, suited Lepp’s game. But the pins were set in some tricky locations, which made it play tough.\n\n“You have to try really hard to get into trouble off the tee,” Lepp said.\n\n“So the only way they can really defend it is to put crazy pins out there. But the greens were really firm, so it was tough to get anything close to the hole.”\n\nLepp, who birdied his first two holes of the day, also birdied the first playoff hole to grab the first of the two available spots.\n\nHe expects to play his 36-hole sectional qualifier at Tumble Creek Golf Club at the Suncadia Resort in Cle Elum, Wash. This will be his second trip to sectional qualifying. He failed to advance in 2005 when he was awarded a spot in the sectionals after his NCAA Championship win.\n\nFellow B.C. pros Nick Taylor, Adam Hadwin and Roger Sloan, as PGA Tour members, were exempt through local qualifying and have spots in sectional qualifiers.\n\nCHIP SHOTS: On Tuesday, Victoria’s Cory Renfrew advanced to sectional qualifying when he shot a six-under 66 to win a local qualifier in Durham, N.C.\n\nbziemer@vancouversun.com\n\nTwitter.com/bradziemer\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
