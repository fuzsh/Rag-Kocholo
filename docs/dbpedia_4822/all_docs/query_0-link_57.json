Nine of the teams are ranked in the Top 50 in the latest GolfWeek poll. Twelve players, including defending NCAA individual champion James Lepp of Washington, also are ranked in the Top 50.\n\nThe field is comprised of No. 5 UCLA, No. 43 Arizona, Arkansas, No. 25 Augusta State, California, No. 16 Northwestern, No. 22 Notre Dame, No. 17 Pepperdine, Stanford, No. 29 Texas, Central Florida, North Carolina, No. 50 USC, Virginia and No. 11 Washington.\n\nMills had a low four-day total of 281, after rounds of 72, 67, 70 and 72. He currently leads Texas wit ha 73.5 per round average and tied for 32nd at UT's last outing to The Prestige on Oct. 17-18.\n\nJunior Jhonattan Vegas finished second with a total of 291 after rounds of 76, 71, 73 and 71. Vegas won the last qualifying tournament for The Prestige, and will look to improve upon his 76.7 per round average this week.\n\nSenior Jeff Bell and junior Farren Keenan, who tied with 293s, and sophomore Jace Moore who totaled 294, will round on the five for UT. Moore was only one stroke ahead of senior All-American Matt Rosenfeld entering the final round had to out duel the senior, shooting a 71 to Rosenfeld's 77, to make the cut.\n\nOf the five, four will have played in the each of the three tournaments this fall, while Bell is making his second appearance of the season.\n\nThe format for the CordeValle Collegiate calls for 36 holes of stroke play on Monday, Oct. 31 and 18 holes on Tuesday, Nov. 1.
