        "text": "West Coast Conference\n\nMen's Golf 5/10/2024 11:26:00 AM by Athletic Communications\n\nThree Waves Set for Rancho Santa Fe Regional\n\nMALIBU, Calif. — Three from the Pepperdine men's golf team will continue on with NCAA postseason play on Monday, as sophomores Mahanth Chirravuri and Brady Siravo and freshman William Walsh were selected as individual participants for the NCAA Rancho Santa Fe Regional.\n\nEVENT INFO — The Rancho Santa Fe Regional, hosted by fellow WCC foe and league champion San Diego, will be held at the par-70, 6,962-yard The Farms Golf Club in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif. There will be 18-holes of golf each day Monday through Wednesday (May 13-14). The top five teams and low individual not on those teams from each regional site will advance to the finals, which will be held at Omni La Costa Resort & Spa in Carlsbad, Calif. from May 24-29.\n\nThe Waves' trio will be paired with players from Seton Hall and Winthrop and will tee off for the first round beginning at 9:50 a.m. PT. Live scoring will be available on Golfstat with links found on www.PepperdineWaves.com\n\nFIELD — The five individuals that earned a bid to the regional in order of seeding are Mahanth Chirravuri, Tegan Andrews (Cal State Fullerton), William Walsh, Brady Siravo and Kevin Li (Seattle).\n\nThe teams competing in the regional in order of seeding are #3 Arizona State, #10 Washington, #16 Oklahoma, #22 California, #26 Oklahoma State, #34 North Florida, #38 Chattanooga, #46 South Florida, #50 San Diego, #58 West Virginia, #67 Kansas, Wright State, Seton Hall and Winthrop.\n\nEVENT HISTORY — The Waves have sent individuals to the regional without competing as a team twice previously, in 2012 and 2014. In 2012, Pepperdine's Josh Anderson and Johnny MacArthur competed as individuals in the tournament. Anderson finished in first, which tied the program record for best-finish at a regional alongside current Pepperdine Head Coach Michael Beard (2000) and Joe Highsmith (2022). He then advanced to the NCAA finals where he finished tied for 37th.\n\nPepperdine individuals have advanced through the regionals to the finals without the Waves competing as a team eight times (1987, 1992, 1994, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2012, 2018). In fact, Pepperdine's best-ever individual finish came out of the 2005 season when Michael Putnam competed as an individual and finished in second-place. He was tied for first-place after 72-holes at the final, but lost in a three-hole playoff to Washington's James Lepp.\n\nLAST TIME OUT — The Waves last competed at the West Coast Conference Championships, reaching the WCC title match against San Diego and ending with a second-place finish. Pepperdine highlighted the stroke play portion of the tournament with a pair tied for first-place after 54-holes of golf, entering into a three-person playoff with Pepperdine's sophomore Brady Siravo and freshman William Walsh, as well as PCH Cup rival LMU's Riley Lewis. After a five-hole bout that saw the Lion drop off early, Siravo and Walsh went head-to-head to the finish. Siravo ended things to win the first tournament of his career and became the 15th Wave all-time and fifth in the last nine seasons to earn WCC Championship medalist honors.\n\nThe Waves finished in second-place as a team through stroke play, earning the #2 seed for match play in the newly formatted conference tournament. After winning the match against LMU for a 3-1 victory, Pepperdine reached the final against San Diego, though the Toreros had an early edge and pushed through for a 3-1 win of their own for the title.\n\nRANKINGS — Pepperdine is ranked #51 in the Clipp'd national rankings this week, just one spot behind the team hosting the NCAA Rancho Santa Fe Regional, USD. Mahanth Chirravuri is ranked #70 in the individual rankings.\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\nBrady Siravo\n\n5' 8\"\n\nSophomore\n\n1V\n\nMahanth Chirravuri\n\n5' 10\"\n\nSophomore\n\nTR\n\nWilliam Walsh\n\n5' 9\"\n\nFreshman\n\nHS"
