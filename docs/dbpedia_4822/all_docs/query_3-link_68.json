Washington, Oregon and Alaska were part of District 8 along with California, Hawaii and Nevada. Idaho and Montana were in District 7 along with Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. In 1972, the current Northwest Athletic Trainers’ Association was formed and included the current membership states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Alaska as well as Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan. The Canadian Providences eventually evolved into the Canadian Athletic Trainers' Association and were no longer connected to the NATA.\n\nKey Events and People in our History:\n\nSherry Kosek-Babagian from the University of Washington became the first female to pass the NATA BOC exam in 1971.\n\nIn January of 1972, NATA restructing of Districts lead to the development of the current District 10, which had been just the Canadian Providences.
