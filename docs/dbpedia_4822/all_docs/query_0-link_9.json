That win also gave him a one-shot advantage heading into the five-hole elimination challenge. Isaac Sanchez of Folsom, Calif. was eliminated on Tuesday night.\n\nThe series was shot this past spring in West Virginia and began airing in early October. The competition began with 12 players.\n\nLepp was a highly decorated amateur player who had an outstanding collegiate career at the University of Washington. He cut his pro career short to start his own shoe company called Kikkor Golf.\n\nThe 28-year-old Ledgeview Golf Club product has received considerable attention during the Big Break series by using what he calls his saucer-pass, a chip shot that is more like a hockey wrist shot than a golf shot.\n\nSilvers attended the University of South Carolina and has won 23 tournaments since turning pro in 2009. He competed in the 2010 U.S. Open.\n\nbziemer@vancouversun.com; twitter.com/bradziemer\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
