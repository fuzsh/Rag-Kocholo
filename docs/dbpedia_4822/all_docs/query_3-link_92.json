        "text": "University of Portland head men’s golf coach Bill Winter was one of 18 golfers vying for one berth in the prestigious U.S. Open on Monday, but finished in 10th place with a total score of 154 in the two-round event held at TPC Snoqualmie Ridge. Winter opened with a seven-over 79 in the first round, but improved with a 75 in the second round on the 7264-yard course.\n\nThe Open berth was snared by Troy Kelly, who fired a two-under 70 in the first round and followed it up with a sizzling 68 to finish six under for the event. 2005 NCAA Division I Men’s Golf Championship individual winner James Lepp was among four players who received alternate status.\n\nThe 105th U.S. Open will be held at Pinehurst Resort, in Village of Pinehurst, North Carolina on June 16-19, 2005. The USGA accepted a record 9,048 entries, eclipsing the old mark of 8,726 for the 2004 U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills. The Championship is open top any professional golfer, and any amateur golfers with an official USGA Handicap Index not exceeding 1.4."
