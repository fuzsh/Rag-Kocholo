Every currently leads the Gators with a 71.47 stroke average and has placed in the top-five at five of the team's seven tournaments, including a third-place finish at the Puerto Rico Classic this week. He won the Gators' season-opener at the Inverness Invitational by carding a three-round score of 213 (E) for his fourth career individual medal.\n\nThe Hogan Award is presented annually to the top men's golfer in NCAA Division I, II, III, NAIA or junior college, taking into account all collegiate and amateur competitions during the last 12 months.
