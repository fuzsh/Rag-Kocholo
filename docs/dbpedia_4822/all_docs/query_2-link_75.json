        "meta_description": "Aug. 23, 2005 Ardmore, PA - Clemson red-shirt sophomore Tanner Ervin advanced to the match play portion of the US Amateur with a 144 score for his two rounds of stroke play. The second round was completed on Tuesday and he will face Ryan Blaum of ACC Champion Duke in the first round on Wednesday. The event is being played at the famed Merion Country Club in Ardmore, PA. It is the same course where former Clemson All-American Chris Patton won the US Amateur in 1989, the only time a player with Clemson ties has won this tournament. Ervin had a three-over par 73 on the Philadelphia Country Club course in the first round on Monday, then came back with a one-over par 71 on Tuesday at Merion to qualify in 24th place. He is actually seeded 26th for the match play portion of the event. Ervin had three birdies and four bogeys in his round on Tuesday. His 144 total was nine shots behind medallist James Lepp, the reigning NCAA Champion from the University of Washington, who had rounds of 70 and 65. Two Tigers failed to make the match play portion of the event. Jack Ferguson, a senior on Clemson's 2005 team, had rounds of 75-75 for a 10-over par score and missed the cut by four shots. His next tournament will be in the pro ranks as he has announced the US Amateur would be his last amateur tournament. Stephen Poole, a rising senior on the 2005-06 Clemson team, had rounds of 72-77 and his 149 score was three shots off the cut line. he had a strong 72 at Merion on Monday, but slipped to a 77 at Philadelphia Country Club on Tuesday. Ervin's match with Blaum will begin at 9:50 AM at Merion.",
