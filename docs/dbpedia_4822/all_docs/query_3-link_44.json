        "text": "By Jeff Graham of the Kitsap Sun\n\nNick Taylor was busy putting on a show at the U.S. Amateur Championship at The Olympic Club near San Francisco last month when University of Washington golf coach Matt Thurmond grabbed his cell phone.\n\nHe found the number of former Huskies standout James Lepp — the 2005 NCAA Individual Champion — and began punching buttons at a feverish pace.\n\n\"James and I were text-messaging every shot,\" said Thurmond, who followed the tournament on TV. \"I said, 'James, you better get your act together, because you're about to become the second-best player ever to come out of Abbotsford, (British Columbia).'\"\n\nTaylor's tournament ended in the match play quarterfinals when he fell to eventual champion Colt Knost of Dallas, 5 and 4. But the stellar run has Taylor feeling he's primed for a prominent role with the Huskies after a bumpy freshman season in 2006.\n\n\"This year, with how I played this summer, I think it will be a lot better,\" said Taylor, who makes his season debut tomorrow at the Husky Invitational at Gold Mountain Golf Club in Bremerton.\n\nMuch like that booming drive off the No. 1 tee box, Taylor's career in purple and gold began with promise. He placed 10th at last year's Husky Invite and won the University of British Columbia Men's Invitational two weeks later.\n\nBut with his putter failing him more and more as the season wore on, Taylor ended up making the Huskies' starting lineup just six times in the team's final 12 events.\n\n\"I was in and out of the lineup every tournament,\" said Taylor, who was eighth on the team with a 75.08 stroke average in 24 tournament rounds. \"I felt like I would be playing well, then I'd get into tournaments and end up struggling.\"\n\nTo make matters worse, UW failed to qualify for the NCAA Championships for the first time in Thurmond's seven years with the program.\n\nThe coach is optimistic the Huskies can return in 2008, but they'll have to do so without two of last year's best performers.\n\nLast season's top player Alex Prugh graduated and sophomore Joel Dahmen — Taylor's roommate — is academically ineligible. Dahmen ranked third on the team last season in stroke average and was UW's top finisher at the NCAA West Regional. He also captured this summer's Washington State Amateur title.\n\nWith only eight players on the roster, breaking into the starting lineup won't be as difficult.\n\n\"It's a great opportunity,\" Thurmond said. \"Guys will have a chance to play, qualifying won't be as intense I would imagine. You'll get a chance to play a lot.\"\n\nTaylor, who Thurmond said has one of the best short games he's seen, seems up to the challenge.\n\nPrior to his quarterfinal finish at the U.S. Amateur Championship, he bested the field at the Canadian Men's Amateur at Riverside Country Club in Saskatoon, Sask. The 19-year-old won on the 38th hole to become on the second player in history to win the Canadian Am title a year after capturing the Canadian Junior championship.\n\n\"The whole summer, I was playing pretty well,\" Taylor said. \"At the Canadian Amateur, my putting really came around.\"\n\nWith the victory, Taylor earned a spot in next year's PGA Tour Canadian Open. There, he'll be able to glimpse life on the professional circuit — something Taylor would like to pursue after college.\n\n\"That's going to be a blast,\" Taylor said.\n\nBut before he gets caught up with following a dream of playing golf for a living, he'd like to make his mark as a Husky.\n\nEntering the season at the team's No. 1 golfer after shooting a 5-over 218 during a one-day, 54-hole team scrimmage earlier this month, Taylor knows Thurmond is looking at him to be one of the team's go-to guys.\n\n\"My confidence is there,\" he said. \"Going into tournaments now, I feel (like I can win).\"\n\nHe'll get his chance this week at Gold Mountain.\n\nHusky Invite at a Glance\n\nWhen: Monday and Tuesday. Play begins at 7:30 a.m.\n\nWhere: Gold Mountain Golf Club's Olympic Course\n\nFormat: 54 holes. 36 on Monday, 18 on Tuesday\n\nDefending champ: UW's John Wise was the medalist at 7-under 209; UCLA won the team title.\n\nThe field: Washington, BYU, California, UC Davis, Fresno State, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, Oregon State, Pacific, Pepperdine, San Diego State and Washington State.\n\nHistory: This is the eighth Husky Invitational. UW has won its own title twice in 2001 and 2003.\n\nGreat Eight?\n\nThe University of Washington golf team kicks off its season Monday at Gold Mountain Golf Club's Husky Invitational. Here are the eight members of this year's team:\n\nZach Bixler, sr. Richland, Wash.\n\nTze Huang Choo, fr. Singapore, Singapore\n\nKellen Eakin, jr. University Place, Wash.\n\nChris Killmer, jr. Bellingham, Wash.\n\nKevin Spooner, fr. West Vancouver, B.C.\n\nNick Taylor, so. Abbotsford, B.C.\n\nDarren Wallace, so. Langley, B.C.\n\nJohn Wise, jr. Issaquah, Wash."
