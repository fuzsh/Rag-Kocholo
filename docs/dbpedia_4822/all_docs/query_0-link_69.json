        "text": "EUGENE, Ore. ? Oregon shot a 295 Tuesday and wilted just a bit in the final round of the Oregon Duck Invitational men's golf tournament, but still managed to grab a top-five finish and defeat nine opponents from the West, giving the Ducks a lift in their pursuit of an NCAA Regional bid.\n\nWashington surged to the team title by shooting a 2-under 286 Tuesday at the par-72, 6,854-yard Eugene Country Club in spite of soggy and cold conditions. The Huskies shot 860 over three rounds to beat Nevada and San Diego State by six strokes. No. 2 Georgia Tech finished fourth at 867, while the Ducks took fifth at 869.\n\nThe individual race ended in a tie as Pepperdine's Michael Putnam and Washington's James Lepp each finished at 8-under 208. Lepp fired a 69 Monday to lead the Huskies to the team title, while Putnam countered with an even-par 72.\n\nRoberto Castro of Georgia Tech took third at 210, followed by Ryan Panichpakdee of Long Beach State and Zach Bixler of Washington tied for fourth at 213. Oregon's Matt Ma was one of three golfers tied for sixth at 214. It was the second top-10 finish of the season for the sophomore from Aiea, Hawaii.\n\nJay Snyder, playing in his first tournament as a member of Oregon's counting five, lifted the Ducks on Tuesday by shooting a career-low 71 in the final round. The sophomore from Vancouver, B.C., tied for 16th at 2-over 218, which was far and away his highest finish as a collegian; Snyder's previous best was a 46th-place tie at the 2004 Northwest Collegiate Classic.\n\nAlso for Oregon, junior Gregg LaVoie finished with a 74 Tuesday and tied for 32nd at 221, while junior Chris Dukeminier had a 76 and tied for 37th at 222. It was the best finish as a collegian for the graduate of Eugene's Sheldon High School.\n\nIn terms of NCAA Regional consideration, Oregon scored key points by finishing higher than nine teams in the Ducks' region: Saint Mary's (872), Pepperdine (873), Stanford (876), Oregon State (882), Long Beach State (886), UC Riverside (894), San Jose State (902), Pacific (905) and Washington State (911).\n\nThe Ducks failed to qualify for the 2004 NCAA West Regional for the first time in eight years. The 2005 NCAA West Regional will be held May 19-21 at Stanford.\n\n- www.GoDucks.com -"
