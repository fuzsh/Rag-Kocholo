Abbotsford Sports Hall of Fame Class of 2017

James Lepp’s outstanding golf career included a plethora of high-profile wins as an amateur. He was a two-time Canadian Junior champion (2001 and 2002), won the BC Amateur a record four years in a row (2002 through 2005), topped the Royal Canadian Golf Association order of merit three times (2003 through 2005) as Canada’s top amateur golfer, and earned medalist honours at the 2005 U.S. Amateur.

Arguably his signature accomplishment came in 2005 as a member of the University of Washington Huskies, when he became the first Canadian to win the NCAA men’s individual championship.

Lepp also represented Canada on a number of occasions in international play – he finished 18th at the 2004 World Amateur Team Championship, leading Team Canada to a fourth-place finish, and he helped Canada win the 2003 and 2005 Copa de las Americas titles.

Lepp was a two-time winner on the Canadian Tour, winning the Greater Vancouver Classic in 2003 (as an amateur) and 2007. He stepped away from pro golf in 2008, turning his talents toward entrepreneurial ventures as the founder of Kikkor Golf and Six Hundred Four Shoes.
