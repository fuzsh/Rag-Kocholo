        "text": "VIA PRESS RELEASE | Ringing in the 2023 holidays with a timeless seasonal classic, Verve Records announces a new edition of Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas, the legendary holiday album from Ella Fitzgerald. The collection of festive tunes—now on “ruby red” vinyl with a collectible cover that is unique to this color variant—is sure to enchant fans new and old. The new version also features the official visualizer for Ella’s rendition of “Good Morning Blues.”\n\nHailed as “the best holiday album ever” by Salon, Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas has been a cherished holiday classic amongst jazz aficionados for more than sixty years. Ranking #10 on Rolling Stone’s “25 Greatest Christmas Albums of All Time” and #2 on The Guardian’s “20 Greatest Christmas Albums” this stunning edition introduces a new spirit to this timeless collection of classics from Ella and makes for a perfect gift for any fan.\n\nDubbed “The First Lady of Song,” Ella Fitzgerald (1917-1996) was the most popular female jazz singer in the United States for more than half a century. In her lifetime, she sold more than 40 million albums and received most every honor a performer could dream of winning, including the Kennedy Center Honor (1979), the National Medal of Arts (1987), France’s Commander of Arts and Letters (1990), the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1992), and 13 Grammy Awards. In 2007, the United States Postal Service honored Fitzgerald with a postage stamp.\n\nIn her six-decade long career, the Queen of Jazz recorded more than 200 albums and roughly 2,000 songs, making her the most recorded female—and the second most recorded—performer in history. Fitzgerald’s distinct style has influenced multiple generations of singers and her work transcends generations and musical genres."
