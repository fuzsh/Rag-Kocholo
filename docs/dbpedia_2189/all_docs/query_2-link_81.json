        "text": "Ella Fitzgerald\n\nAllmusic Biography : Recognized worldwide as \"The First Lady of Song,\" Ella Fitzgerald is arguably the finest female jazz vocalist of all time. Blessed with a highly resonant voice, wide range, and near-perfect elocution, Fitzgerald also possessed a deft sense of swing, and with her brilliant scat technique, could hold her own against any of her instrumental contemporaries. She came to initial popularity as a member of drummer Chick Webbs band in the 1930s, scoring a hit with a \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket,\" before ascending to wide acclaim in the 1940s with Jazz at the Philharmonic and Dizzy Gillespies Big Band, and issuing landmark performances like \"Flying Home\" and \"How High the Moon.\" Working with producer/manager Norman Granz, she gained even more acclaim with her series of albums on Verve, recording definitive versions of the music of the Great American Songbook composers, including 1956s Sings the Cole Porter Songbook. Over her 50-year career, she earned 13 Grammy Awards, sold over 40 million albums, and picked up numerous accolades including a National Medal of Arts and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. A hugely important cultural figure, Fitzgerald made an immeasurable impact on the development of jazz and popular music, and remains a touchstone for fans and artists decades after her passing.\n\nBorn in 1917 in Newport News, Virginia, Fitzgerald grew up in a working-class family in Yonkers, New York. Her parents split up soon after her birth, and she was largely raised by her mother, Temperance \"Tempie\" Fitzgerald, and her mothers boyfriend Joseph \"Joe\" Da Silva. She also had a younger half-sister, Frances, who was born in 1923. To help with the familys finances, Fitzgerald often worked odd jobs including, at times, running bet money for local gamblers. By her teens, the self-professed tomboy was active in sports and often played in local baseball games. Influenced by her mother, she also enjoyed singing and dancing, and spent many hours singing along to records by Bing Crosby, Connee Boswell, and the Boswell Sisters. She also began taking the train to see shows with friends at Harlems Apollo Theater. In 1932, her mother died from injuries sustained in a car accident. Deeply distraught over the loss, Fitzgerald went through a difficult period that found her skipping school and getting in trouble with the police. She was subsequently sent to a reform school, where she endured abuse by her caretakers. Eventually breaking free from the reformatory, she found herself on her own in New York during the height of the Great Depression. Despite her struggles, she worked to pursue her love of performing. In 1934, she entered and won an amateur contest at the Apollo, singing Hoagy Carmichaels \"Judy\" in the style of her idol, Connee Boswell. In the house band that night was saxophonist Benny Carter, who took the young vocalist under his wing and encouraged her to keep developing her career.\n\nMore contests followed, and in 1935 Fitzgerald won a weeklong spot singing with Tiny Bradshaw at the Harlem Opera House. There, she met influential drummer Chick Webb, who agreed to try her out with his orchestra at a one-nighter at Yale University. She won the crowd over, and spent the next few years with the drummer, who became her legal guardian and reworked his show to feature the singer. The bands fame grew exponentially with Fitzgerald, as they dominated at the Savoy battle of the bands, and issued a string of Decca 78s, scoring hits \"A Tisket-A-Tasket,\" in 1938, and the B-side \"Taint What You Do (Its the Way That You Do It),\" as well as \"Liza,\" and \"Undecided.\" As the singers career was on the rise, Webbs health had begun to decline. Though only in his thirties, the drummer, who had struggled with congenital spinal tuberculosis throughout his life, would purportedly collapse from exhaustion after playing a set. Nonetheless, he forged onwards, hoping to keep his band working through the Depression. In 1939, not long after undergoing major surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, Webb died. Following his death, Fitzgerald continued to front his band with much success until 1941, when she decided to pursue a solo career.\n\nSticking with Decca, Fitzgerald was teamed with the Ink Spots, Louis Jordan, and the Delta Rhythm Boys for several best-sellers, and in 1946 began working regularly for manager Norman Granzs Jazz at the Philharmonic. Though often regarded as a pop vocalist during her time with Webb, Fitzgerald had begun to experiment with scat singing, a sound she further developed during these years. She toured with Dizzy Gillespies big band, and soon adopted bebop as an integral part of her style, punctuating her live sets with instrumental-style scat solos that wowed audiences and earned her respect from her fellow musicians. Her recordings of \"Lady Be Good,\" \"How High the Moon,\" and \"Flying Home\" during 1945-1947 were released to great acclaim and helped solidify her stature as a major jazz vocalist. It was while working with Gillespie that she met and married bassist Ray Brown, living with him from 1947 to 1953, during which time she often performed with his trio. The couple also adopted a son, Ray Brown, Jr., (born to Fitzgeralds half-sister Frances in 1949) who would go on to his own career as a pianist and vocalist. In 1951, the singer paired with pianist Ellis Larkins for the duets album Ella Sings Gershwin, on which she interpreted George Gershwin songs, prefiguring her later Songbooks series.\n\nAfter appearing in the film Pete Kellys Blues in 1955, Fitzgerald signed with Norman Granzs Verve label. Her longtime manager, Granz had specifically launched Verve with the sole purpose of better showcasing her voice. Beginning with 1956s Sings the Cole Porter Songbook, she would record an extensive series of Songbooks albums, interpreting the music of the Great American Songbook composers, including Cole Porter, George and Ira Gershwin, Rodgers & Hart, Duke Ellington, Harold Arlen, Jerome Kern, and Johnny Mercer. The prestigious albums, which earned Fitzgerald her first four Grammys at the 1959 and 1958 Grammy Awards, further raised her stature as one of the great singers of all time. Other soon-to-be-classic albums followed, including her 1956 pairing with Louis Armstrong Ella & Louis, 1957s Like Someone in Love, and 1958s Porgy and Bess with Armstrong. Also under Granzs guidance, Fitzgerald toured often, issuing a handful of highly regarded live concert albums. Among them, 1960s Ella in Berlin included her off-the-cuff take on \"Mack the Knife\" in which she forgot the lyrics and improvised her own. One of the best-selling albums of her career, Ella in Berlin earned her Grammy Awards for Best Vocal Performance Single Record or Track, Female, and Best Vocal Performance Album, Female. The album was later inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nVerve was sold to MGM in 1963, and by 1967 Fitzgerald found herself without a contract. She spent the next few years recording for a number of labels like Capitol, Atlantic and Reprise. Her albums during these years also found her updating her repertoire with modern pop and rock songs such as Creams \"Sunshine of Your Love\" and the Beatles \"Hey Jude.\" She sang traditional hymns on 1967s Brighten the Corner, while 1969s Ella included her last U.S. chart single with a cover of Smokey Robinsons \"Get Ready.\" Nonetheless, Fitzgerald remained an immensely popular and highly regarded performer. In 1967, she was bestowed with the Bing Crosby Award (later named the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award) at the 10th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nHowever, her later years were again marked by the influence of Granz after he founded the independent Pablo Records. A concert album, Jazz at the Santa Monica Civic 72, featuring Fitzgerald, pianist Tommy Flanagan, and the Count Basie Orchestra, gained popularity via mail-order sales and helped Granz launch the label. More albums followed throughout the 70s and 80s, many pairing the singer with artists like Basie, Oscar Peterson, and Joe Pass, among others. While diabetes affected her eyes and heart during this period, forcing her to take breaks from performing, Fitzgerald always retained her joyful style, and exuberant sense of swing. Away from the stage, she was committed to helping disadvantaged youth, and made contributions to various charity organizations. In 1979, she was honored with a Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts Medal of Honor Award. Also, in 1987, President Ronald Reagan awarded her the National Medal of Arts. More accolades followed, including a Commander of Arts and Letters award from France, and numerous honorary doctorates from Yale, Harvard, Dartmouth, and other institutions. Following a concert at New Yorks Carnegie Hall in 1991, she retired from her career. Fitzgerald passed away on June 15, 1996, at her home in Beverly Hills, California. In the decades following her death, Fitzgeralds reputation as one of the most influential and recognizable figures in jazz and popular music only increased. She remains a household name around the world, and has received a number of posthumous accolades, including four Hall of Fame Grammys and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Fitzgerald was a favored singing partner of Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, Dizzy Gillespie (who had a profound influence on her singing during bebops rise), and Duke Ellington, and achieved both critical and popular success during her lifetime. LULLABIES OF BIRDLAND consists of recordings from 1945 to 1955, offering a cross-section of Swing-era standards, many of which she flat-out owned by the end of her career (\"Oh Lady Be Good\" and \"How High The Moon\" among them).

The arrangements by Buddy Bregman for the string orchestra and big band only border on jazz but she manages to swing the medium-tempo numbers and give sensitivity to the ballads. With such songs as \"You Took Advantage of Me,\" \"The Lady Is a Tramp,\" \"It Never Entered My Mind,\" \"Where or When,\" \"My Funny Valentine,\" and \"Blue Moon,\" it is not too surprising that these recordings (originally released on a two-LP set) were so popular.

Both artists were riding high at this stage in their careers, and Granz assembled a stellar quartet of Oscar Peterson (piano), Buddy Rich (drums), Herb Ellis (guitar) and Ray Brown (bass). Equally inspired was the choice of material, with the gruffness of Armstrongs voice blending like magic with Fitzgeralds stunningly silky delivery. Outstanding are Irving Berlins \"Cheek to Cheek\" and \"Isnt This a Lovely Day,\" and everything else works like a dream, with the golden star going to the Gershwin brothers \"They Cant Take That Away from Me.\" Gentle and sincere, this is deserving of a place in every home.

In this instance, the combination of Cole Porters words and Fitzgeralds interpretation of them created one of the most sought after sessions in vocal history -- embraced by jazz and pop fans alike, transcending boundaries often associated with those genres. Originally released in 1956 on the Verve label, such standards as \"Night and Day,\" \"I Love Paris,\" \"What Is This Thing Called Love,\" \"Ive Got You Under My Skin,\" \"Youre the Top,\" and \"Love for Sale\" secured one of Ella Fitzgeralds crowning moments. The success of these early Porter (and previous Gershwin) sessions brought about numerous interpretations of other songbooks throughout the next several years including those of Rodgers and Hart, Duke Ellington, Johnny Mercer, Harold Arlen, and Irving Berlin.

This 1957 effort is distinguished from Fitzgeralds other songbooks in that it is the only album in which the composer whose work she is singing actively participates. In fact, these recordings are packed with some of the key figures in 20th century jazz. As if Ella and Duke werent enough, Ellingtons arranger/composer Billy Strayhorn, guest musicians Dizzy Gillespie and Oscar Peterson, and brilliant record producer Norman Granz all have a hand in the proceedings. And what better backing band could one want than Dukes orchestra? The usual suspects -- Jimmy Hamilton, Johnny Hodges, Paul Gonsalves, Harry Carney, and Sam Woodyard, among others -- contribute fine performances throughout. Dukes spectacular catalog dazzles, and his sprightly, lush textures are transfigured under Fitzgeralds warm-timbred voice and elegant, precise delivery. Included here are classics like \"Rockin in Rhythm,\" \"Caravan,\" \"Satin Doll,\" \"Sophisticated Lady,\" \"Prelude to a Kiss,\" and \"It Dont Mean a Thing...,\" each tune as familiar as it is delightful to hear in this new context.

(02:36)\n\n15 Porgy & Bess: Oh Lawd, Im on My Way! (02:56)\n\nPorgy & Bess : Allmusic album Review : Producer Norman Granz oversaw two Porgy & Bess projects. The first involved Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong, and came together during the autumn of 1957 with brassy big band and lush orchestral arrangements by Russ Garcia. This is the classic Verve Porgy & Bess, and its been reissued many, many times. The second, recorded during the spring and summer of 1976 and issued by RCA, brought Ray Charles together with versatile British vocalist Cleo Laine, backed by an orchestra under the direction of Frank DeVol. A comparison of these two realizations bears fascinating fruit, particularly when the medleys of street vendors are played back to back. Those peasant songs, used in real life to purvey honey, strawberries, and crabs, were gathered and notated by George Gershwin and novelist Du Bose Heyward in 1934 during a visit to Folly Island, a small barrier island ten miles south of Charleston, SC, known today as Folly Beach. As Charleston Harbor had been one of the major ports during the importation of slaves from Africa, the waterfront was mostly populated by Gullahs, a reconstituted community that retained and preserved its ancestral cultures and languages to unusual degrees. Gershwin, who even learned to chant with the Gullah, absorbed the tonalities of the street cries he heard and wove them -- along with all of the other impressions stored within his sensitive mind -- into the fabric of his opera. Whats really great about the Ella and Louis version is Ella, who handles each aria with disarming delicacy, clarion intensity, or usually a blend of both. Her take on \"Buzzard Song\" (sung 19 years later by Ray Charles) is a thrilling example of this womans intrinsic theatrical genius. Pops sounds like he really savored each duet, and his trumpet work -- not a whole lot of it, because this is not a trumpeters opera -- is characteristically good as gold. This marvelous album stands quite well on its own, but will sound best when matched with the Ray Charles/Cleo Laine version, especially the songs of the Crab Man, of Peter the Honey Man, and his wife, Lily the Strawberry Woman.

Stylistically, Fitzgerald and Armstrong had very different histories; he started out in Dixieland before branching out into classic jazz and swing, whereas Fitzgerald started out as a swing-oriented big-band vocalist before becoming an expert bebopper. But the two of them have no problem finding common ground on Ella & Louis Again, which is primarily a collection of vocal duets (with the backing of a solid rhythm section led by pianist Oscar Peterson). One could nitpick about the fact that Satchmo doesnt take more trumpet solos, but the artists have such a strong rapport as vocalists that the trumpet shortage is only a minor point. Seven selections find either Fitzgerald or Armstrong singing without the other, although theyre together more often than not on this fine set.

The program is familiar, from bouncy singalongs like \"Jingle Bells\" to slinky ballads like a downright sexy \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,\" but Fitzgerald treats each song with exactly as much respect as it deserves. And so Frank Loessers \"What Are You Doing New Years Eve\" is wistfully romantic and Sammy Cahn and Jule Stynes \"Let It Snow\" is kittenishly enticing. As always, Norman Granzs production avoids the schlock that drowns some holiday sets. This is as good as jazz Christmas albums get.

While the arrangements feature brief ensemble passages, the songs are a vehicle for the singer and are deliberately brief. Surprisingly, few of these Broadway tunes became standards for jazz singers. \"Hernandos Hideaway\" found favor with Fitzgerald and she added it to her repertoire for time; this version is entertaining with a prominent role for the bass clarinet, though it is somewhat hampered by its rather mundane lyric. The campy \"Steam Heat\" is inevitably associated with Shirley McClaine, but Ella makes a good effort on a number that would be considered a misfit by most of her fans. \"If I Were a Bell\" is fairly swinging; while the swinging \"Almost Like Being in Love\" is clearly the gem of the date, although both songs feature a distracting backup vocal group that should have been omitted. Ellas enthusiasm and spirited vocals carry the day on this fun-filled CD.

The group doesnt get as much space as they deserve, but with Fitzgerald a commanding presence, its hardly ever felt. And she does give the appreciative crowd the show theyre looking for; whereas most vocalists have treated songs like \"Them There Eyes\" and \"Perdido\" as features for their playful side, Fitzgerald simply rips them apart with twisting, turning wordplay, breakneck tempos the band can hardly keep up with, and scats no listener can digest the first or second time through. She wrings all the selfish joi de vivre from \"The Lady Is a Tramp\" (addressing herself), then, with barely a pause, moves into a carefully paced \"Summertime.\" Two recent crossovers, Barbra Streisands \"People\" and the Beatles \"Cant Buy Me Love,\" serve as pleasant stopgap items between the real show, and Fitzgerald reprises her legend-making rendition of \"Mack the Knife\" from Ella in Berlin, describing the entire sorted Brecht-to-Darin-to-Armstrong history of the song while never losing her sense of swing. Throughout, she never fails to energize or charm her audience.

Together, Fitzgerald and Paich deliver a dozen beautifully sung, carefully arranged standards. An orchestra tastefully backs Fitzgeralds vocals, offering cushy support without overdoing it. Even lighter pieces like \"Sweet Georgia Brown\" and \"Old MacDonald\" are given stately renditions. Theres a fun version of \"I Said No,\" filled with silly double entendres, and a relaxed take on \"Thanks for the Memory.\" Norman Granz takes full advantage of stereo capabilities, creatively mixing the instruments to the right and left tracks while leaving Fitzgeralds voice front and center. Paich adds to the overall sound quality by varying the arrangements from song to song, carefully wrapping each tune in the right package. These fine-tuned arrangements also provide the perfect launching pad for Fitzgerald to place her own stamp on material associated with other singers. While both \"Lover Man (Oh Where Can You Be)\" and \"Youve Changed\" will be recognized as Billie Holiday classics, Fitzgerald delivers light, elegant versions that are distinctly her own. Whisper Not captures two intelligent artists working toward a common goal and creating beautiful music in the process.

Oh, the songs are familiar, with Fitzgerald tackling 13 standards like \"Silent Night,\" \"Joy to the World,\" and \"We Three Kings,\" but in her hands they become vehicles for her precise yet natural-sounding elocution and subtle, confident vocal phrasing. In other words, she sings these songs like theyre fresh and new to the world, and thats no easy task. The end result is one of the best Christmas albums ever made.

Along the way we also hear some fine fills and solo work from Carter, George Auld, Harry \"Sweets\" Edison, and pianist Jimmy Jones. As for Ella, she navigates effortlessly through the material, always swinging and scatting in all the right places and sounding right at home no matter which way the music moves. One of the nicer entries to her latter-day recorded legacy.

One year later, Warner booked studio time at Olympic Studios in London for her to work with producer Richard Perry, a former associate of the Leiber & Stoller crew at the Red Bird label and fresh off a remake of Fats Dominos image (for Fats Is Back). The results here are roughly similar to what he did with Fats; Perry chose songs that were most easily rendered by his artist and most capable of crossing over. Ella submerges herself nearly entirely in the work of rock or R&B stalwarts -- Smokey Robinson, the Beatles, Randy Newman, Harry Nilsson -- and Perry obliges with arrangements anchored by horns, acoustic or electric pianos, and only occasionally, strings. Despite the comfortable backings, its never able to escape the feel of a crossover; on her version of Smokey Robinson & the Miracles \"Ooo Baby Baby,\" Ella makes some wonderful choices during the verses (its easy to see traditional pops influence on Smokey himself), but, on the choruses, shes chained to her backing chorus with poor results.

Produced by Norman Granz and arranged by Gerald Wilson, the album follows on the heels of the full-blown pop session Ella, adopting a similarly groove-oriented contextual approach but drawing on a more diverse pool of material -- evergreens like \"Black Coffee,\" \"Tuxedo Junction,\" and the sublime \"Dont Dream of Anyone but Me\" are made fresh and new, revitalized by Wilsons deeply soulful arrangements and Fitzgeralds breathtaking vocal acrobatics. Hits including \"Sunny\" and \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" are no less rewarding -- Fitzgeralds command of the songs is absolute, adding wrinkles and nuances the hit versions never imagined.

Highlights include \"Just a Sittin and a Rockin,\" \"Teach Me Tonight\" and \"Honeysuckle Rose.\" Album: 42 of 49\n\nTitle: The Best Is Yet to Come\n\nReleased: 1983\n\nTracks: 10\n\nDuration: 39:59\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Allmusic Wikipedia AlbumCover 1 Dont Be That Way (03:58)\n\n2 God Bless the Child (04:42)\n\n3 I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone (03:53)\n\n4 Youre Driving Me Crazy (03:23)\n\n5 Any Old Time (04:19)\n\n6 Good Bye (03:58)\n\n7 Autumn in New York (03:24)\n\n8 The Best Is Yet to Come (05:19)\n\n9 Deep Purple (03:57)\n\n10 Somewhere in the Night (03:06)\n\nThe Best Is Yet to Come : Allmusic album Review : Not a high point lyrically, but her singing is always fine.

Her voice mostly hinted at her former greatness and the setting was perhaps too intimate for what she had left. Fitzgeralds phrasing remained a joy despite the limited range, but there are many more significant records by the singer than this CD reissue despite touching versions of \"Comes Love,\" \"Theres No You\" and \"Gone with the Wind.\" Album: 44 of 49\n\nTitle: Newport Jazz Festival Live at Carnegie Hall, July 5, 1973\n\nReleased: 1985\n\nTracks: 18\n\nDuration: 1:22:56\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nAlbumCover 1 Ive Gotta Be Me (03:04)\n\n2 Good Morning Heartache (05:02)\n\n3 Miss Otis Regrets (Shes Unable to Lunch Today) (04:12)\n\n4 Dont Worry Bout Me / These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You) (05:30)\n\n5 Any Old Blue (04:44)\n\n6 A-Tisket, A-Tasket (02:22)\n\n7 Indian Summer (04:41)\n\n8 Smooth Sailing (03:06)\n\n9 You Turned the Tables on Me (05:20)\n\n10 Nice Work If You Can Get It (02:22)\n\n11 Ive Got a Crush on You (02:19)\n\n1 Medley: Cant Get Started / The Young Man With the Horn / round Midnight (09:00)\n\n2 Star Dust (03:31)\n\n3 \"C\" Jam Blues (11:51)\n\n4 Medley: Taking a Chance on Love / Im in the Mood for Love (03:07)\n\n5 Lemon Drop (05:01)\n\n6 Some of These Days (04:31)\n\n7 People (03:13)\n\nAlbum: 45 of 49\n\nTitle: Easy Living\n\nReleased: 1986\n\nTracks: 15\n\nDuration: 56:55\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Allmusic Wikipedia AlbumCover 1 My Ship (04:26)\n\n2 Dont Be That Way (03:03)\n\n3 My Man (03:30)\n\n4 Dont Worry Bout Me (02:48)\n\n5 The Days of Wine and Roses (03:05)\n\n6 Easy Living (04:16)\n\n7 I Dont Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You (06:07)\n\n8 Love for Sale (04:42)\n\n9 Moonlight in Vermont (04:21)\n\n10 On Green Dolphin Street (03:27)\n\n11 Why Dont You Do Right?

But this CD is not one of her more significant recordings, other than being one of the final chapters.

Her voice was past her prime by this point, but she was able to bring out a lot of the beauty in the ten songs, giving the classic melodies and lyrics tasteful and lightly swinging treatment. Nice Work If You Can Get It is not an essential CD but is a reasonably enjoyable outing.
