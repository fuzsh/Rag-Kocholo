        "text": "This year, we are particularly delighted that Verve Records invited us back to direct and produce not one, but two festive videos for the legendary ‘First Lady of Song’ herself, Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nJingle Bells\n\nFirst up is our animated music video for Ella’s rendition of the Christmas classic “Jingle Bells”. Full of retro charm and drawing inspiration from the animation studios of the mid-century era, our goal was to create a fun visual that matches the track’s infectious energy and personality.\n\nAccompanied by our cheerful team of children and Santa, fans of the album “Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas” may recognise our animated horse/unicorn – which was inspired by Gene Grant’s iconic artwork for the original release in 1960!\n\nWatch the full video here\n\n“What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve?”\n\nStart your NYE plans early with our lyric video accompanying Ella’s gorgeous rendition of “What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve?”. Our video showcases custom illustrations inspired by vintage New Year’s Eve invitations, evoking a bygone era. Plus, don’t miss out on this year’s limited-edition “A Swinging Christmas” LP – a perfect addition to your holiday wish list!\n\nWatch the full video here"
