The ‘cutout head’ graphic style was pretty popular in this era!\n\n❄️ 20 Days to Christmas – Last night’s snowfall reminded me of this serene Count Basie album art. Basie was nominated for 9 Grammies and won every time!\n\n🎅🏻 19 Days to Christmas – Gene Autry introduced the world to “Rudolph” and “Santa Claus is Coming to Town”. He also wrote, “Here Comes Santa Claus”. His “Poppy the Puppy” didn’t quite make it big for Christmas 1951 …\n\n🎼 18 Days to Christmas – “Sing choirs of Angels … !” The Mormon Tabernacle Choir has been singing for an amazing 174 years – back to 1847.

It hit the charts just a week after the Kennedy assassination.\n\n❄️ 14 Days to Christmas – This album cover looks like the houses in Minnesota during last night’s 20” of snowfall. The light, playful George Melachrino strings will be a good accompaniment to addressing Christmas cards today!\n\n🎅🏻 13 Days to Christmas – Scandinavian Yogi Yorgesson (aka Henry Stewart) started as a stand-up / radio act during the 1930s. It wasn’t until almost 2 decades later (1949) that he recorded a song – shooting to the Billboard Top Ten with both sides of this holiday single. I love the mid-century modern moose styling on the album cover.\n\n❄️ 12 Days to Christmas – Bing Crosby’s White Christmas still stands as the #1 song of all time. It debuted in the movie ‘Holiday Inn’, which inspired its namesake sequel. Peggy Lee appeared on the soundtrack album instead of movie lead Rosemary Clooney, who was under contract to another label.\n\n💙 11 Days to Christmas – Written by Willie Nelson, first made a hit by Roy Orbison. ‘Pretty Paper’ is the somber story of a disabled gentlemen Nelson recalled selling wrapping paper & pencils outside Leonard’s Department Store in Fort Worth TX.\n\n🎼 10 Days to Christmas – The King Cole Trio, led by Nat ‘King’ Cole was the first to record ‘The Christmas Song’ in 1946.
