        "text": "Depends on the year. Any 1956-58 stereo, yes, mono is the way to go. First strike against the stereo: Different microphones, less microphones, more distant sound. Second strike against the stereo: Mixed at Radio Recorders, not Capitol and uses too much dreadful reverb. The monos are straight from the Capitol console to the tape machine, no remixing of any kind. The mono sound is dry(er), more dynamic, more balanced presentation, Ella's voice is natural sounding, the orchestra more in the background where it belongs, but still fully miked. The Radio Recorders remixes have really bad midrangey EQ as well, making the distant sounding recordings even more distant sounding. Avoid if possible.\n\nYou might not have seen this thread before...\n\nElla Fitzgerald Sings The Cole Porter Songbook, original Verve 1956 recording and mastering info\n\nThe DCC of Ella Sings The Cole Porter Songbook remains my favorite. Close your eyes and she is in the room singing to you.\n\nHere's the scoop on Ella's stuff done at Capitol for Verve: You cannot go by release date! Why? Because it was common for her to record tracks for multiple albums at one session, which really throws the miking off kilter in terms of the usual Capitol timeline, and the albums may not have been released until years after the initial session, and the miking style was dictated by which album was being finished at a given session, as far as I can tell, which is odd, because it may mean that another album that was done at that session may now have a different recording style. Go figure!\n\nFor instance, \"You've Got What Gets Me\" from the Gershwin Songbook was recorded in 1959, AFTER Capitol abandoned its 3-mics-for-stereo routine, but because that session was also used to complete an album that was started in 1957, Get Happy, and all those '57 tracks were recorded in the 3-mic stereo style, they REVERTED to using 3-mics for that entire session, and so that track, unlike most of the Gershwin Songbook, is a 3-mics-for-stereo recording-- in 1959!\n\nLikewise, the HELLO LOVE album, while released in 1960, actually was recorded back in '57. There's your problem with the stereo version.\n\nMatt,\n\nSo that mono version of HELLO LOVE, (see YouTube clip above) where Ella sounds like she is singing in a dry cardboard box. That can't have been a Capitol mix, not in 1957, the wettest year in their recording history. Correct? Has to be a later RR remix. The guy forgot to patch in the reverb chamber.\n\nOne more thought: I wouldn't be 100% shocked -- but again, I don't own the album -- if whoever did the mono mix in 1960 or so used the Capitol 3-track tapes to create the mono mix on the 1957 tracks, even though in 1957 the mono and stereo version were made on separate systems, and the 3-track tapes were meant for stereo ONLY, with the live-mixed mono version being intended for the mono release (duh). This even happened on at least one Capitol compilation album that I have, so if the mix were being done at, say, Radio Recorders three years after the fact, I wouldn't rule that out. Mono could be really messed up on the 1957 tracks because of that, and on the 1957 tracks just because it was done at Universal or some such place to begin with. Or it could just be a screwy mix; I dunno."
