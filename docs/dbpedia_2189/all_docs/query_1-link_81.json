        "text": "Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas is a 1960 album by the American jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald, recorded in the summer of 1960, with a studio orchestra arranged and conducted by Frank DeVol. It is Fitzgerald's only Verve complete album of Christmas tunes. Verve had issued a 7\" 45rpm single in 1959, featuring \"The Christmas Song\" with \"The Secret of Christmas\" on the B-side, both recorded with Russ Garcia and His Orchestra in September 1959.\n\nThis holiday recording is now available on limited edition 180g White Vinyl with a die cut sleeve.\n\n\"Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas is a charming, warmly humorous -- and yes, swinging -- set of classic Christmas tunes. The program is familiar, from bouncy singalongs like 'Jingle Bells' to slinky ballads like a downright sexy 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,' but Fitzgerald treats each song with exactly as much respect as it deserves. And so Frank Loesser's 'What Are You Doing New Year's Eve' is wistfully romantic and Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne's 'Let It Snow' is kittenishly enticing. As always, Norman Granz's production avoids the schlock that drowns some holiday sets. This is as good as jazz Christmas albums get.\" - AllMusic\n\nFeatures:\n\n• 180g Vinyl\n\n• Limited Edition White Vinyl\n\n• Die cut sleeve\n\n• Import\n\n• Bonus Tracks\n\nSelections:\n\n1.
