        "text": "Ella's 1960 Verve holiday album - featuring \"Frosty The Snow Man\", \"Winter Wonderland\", \"Sleigh Ride\" and many more - has been a swingin' yuletide tradition for over 60 years. The album was recorded in the summer of 1960, with a studio orchestra arranged and conducted by Frank DeVol. An ebullient Ella Fitzgerald exudes warmth, spirit and good cheer, as if to ask: Why not the peace and good will of Christmas the year 'round? These twelve happy, winter songs suggest that yours be a Swinging Christmas - anytime, all the time!\n\nSeeking to offer definitive audiophile grade versions of some of the most historic and best jazz records ever recorded, Verve Label Group and Universal Music Enterprises' audiophile Acoustic Sounds vinyl reissue series utilizes the skills of top mastering engineers and the unsurpassed production craft of Quality Record Pressings. All titles are mastered from the original analog tapes, pressed on 180-gram vinyl and packaged by Stoughton Printing Co. in high-quality gatefold sleeves with tip-on jackets.\n\nTracks:\n\nSide A:\n\nJingle Bells\n\nSanta Claus Is Coming To Town\n\nHave Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\n\nWhat Are You Doing New Year's Eve?\n\nSleigh Ride\n\nThe Christmas Song\n\nSide B:\n\nGood Morning Blues\n\nLet It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow\n\nWinter Wonderland\n\nRudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer\n\nFrosty The Snow Man\n\nWhite Christmas"
