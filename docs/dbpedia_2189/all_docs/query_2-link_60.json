Have a swinging Christmas and a jazzy new year with this joyous 1960 Ella LP in your collection. She sings (and swings) “Jingle Bells,” “Sleigh Ride,” “Winter Wonderland,” and more! She puts her singular stamp on everything from a sultry vamp like “What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve?” to the sweet and cozy “The Christmas Song.” Even potentially shopworn standards like “Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town” sound fresher when they’re coming from Ella Fitzgerald."
