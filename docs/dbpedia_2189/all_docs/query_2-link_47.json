        "text": "All of the Live in Berlin releases (I think there are three, one of which was only recently released.)\n\nThese are recorded beautifully and she is so alive sounding. Amazing. I'm not a fan of big, brassy arrangements, which make these dates with her small band all the better. Her voice is the absolute star.\n\nI quite like the intimate recordings Bing made in a small group settings, so these are a natural pick, thank you.\n\nAs some have already said, for Ella on the Verve label you can't go wrong with the CDs Dennis Drake remastered in the mid to late Eighties. Though it doesn't say everything you can quickly check if you're close by looking at the spine. Those early Verve CDs can be distinguished by being in jewel cases and having a red section on the left hand side. Dennis Drake is mentioned in the credits in the booklet. Here's an example from one of the Cole Porter Songbook volumes.\n\nFor the Songbooks my favourites are the Duke Ellington (a 3CD one), Harold Arlen and Cole Porter ones but all are in one way or another essential.\n\nA nice pre-Verve collection is the Pure Ella CD (Ella Fitzgerald - Pure Ella ). It's basically a compilation of her albums Ella Sings Gerswin and Songs In A Mellow Mood. This is Ella with a small combo so the sound is more intimate. Mastering is also OK.\n\nThis latest release is indeed outstanding —\n\nThere’s a good cheap ‘best of the songbooks’ that hooked me 25 years ago. The Cole Porter song book is fantastic if you don’t want a comp. I prefer the earlier songbooks to the later ones but they all have great stuff\n\nI also love Clap Hands (smaller combo behind her), Like Someone in Love, and Ella and Louis.\n\nThis is all good advice. There are, to a certain extent two Ellas, the more \"pop\" oriented and the more jazz oriented where she scats- using her voice like an instrument to improvise like a n instrumentalist. If you are not a jazz fan you are probably better off with the song book material (though she brought a jazz sensibility to everything she did) rather than, say the later albums on the Pablo label like Fine and Mellow. But I think even her jazz albums are pretty accessible.\n\nA career-spanning compilation like Centennial might also be a good choice.\n\nGood point! I love jazz but I’m not a fan of scat singing.\n\nI only own a couple of Ella albums but I love this Christmas album. I had another one that was more \"spiritual\" material that I didn't like as much, but this one is pure gold, filled with poppy songs like \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town.\"\n\nElla Fitzgerald – Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas (1988, CD)\n\nMore images\n\nElla Fitzgerald – Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas\n\nLabel:\n\nVerve Records – 827 150-2\n\nFormat:\n\nCD, Album\n\nCountry:\n\nUS\n\nReleased:\n\n1988\n\nGenre:\n\nJazz\n\nStyle:\n\nContemporary Jazz, Easy Listening\n\nPerhaps my favorite album of her's is a live album, Live At The Opera House. Check out her rendition of \"Stompin' At The Savoy\". Make sure to listen to it all the way though, how she builds the song up. Her vocal work is stupendous.\n\nShe, admittedly, was not jazz singer who was about the lyrics first and foremost (unlike, say, Carmen McRae or Shirley Horn), the lyrical content, the words. Her thing is mainly being another musician who uses her voice as the instrument. One thing to also notice is that when she does a song, she always does the first verse melodically straight to introduce it, and only then does she go off on it.\n\nThank you for these suggestions,, I'll have to scrounge through Discogs, haha."
