As mentioned in the first post of this series, Adolf-Friedrich I ruled in Mecklenburg-Schwerin and it was his brother Johann-Albert II, who ruled as Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (May 5, 1590 – April 23, 1636).

From 1608 to 1611, Johann-Albert II was the nominal ruler of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; the actual ruler being the regent, his great-uncle Charles I. From 1611 to 1621 Johann-Albert II and his brother Adolf-Friedrich I jointly ruled the whole Duchy of Mecklenburg. From 1621, John Albert ruled Mecklenburg-Güstrow alone.

Johann-Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow

Mecklenburg-Güstrow was created for a third and final time with the partition of 1621, when Johann-Albert II received the Güstrow part of Mecklenburg.

(I) Johann-Albert II was married three times. His first marriage on October 9, 1608 was to his cousin Margaret-Elisabeth of Mecklenburg, daughter of Duke Christopher of Mecklenburg. The couple had the following children:

* Hans-Georg (1610-1660)

* Johann-Christopher (1611–1612)

* Charles-Heinrich (1616–1618)

(II) On March 26, 1618, Johann-Albert II married Elizabeth of Hesse-Cassel (1596 – 1625), daughter of Landgrave Mauritz of Hesse-Cassel. This marriage remained childless.

(III) Johann-Albert II married his third wife, Eleonore-Marie of Anhalt-Bernburg (1600 – 1657), daughter of Prince Christian I of Anhalt-Bernburg, on May 7, 1626. The couple had the following children:

* Anna Sophie (1628 – 1666)

* John Christian (1629–1631)

* Eleanor (1630–1631)

* Gustaf-Adolph (1633–1695)

* Louise (20 May 1635 – 6 January 1648)

Johann-Albert II died in 1636 and was buried in the Minster in Güstrow. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Gustaf-Adolph, by his third wife, Eleonore-Marie of Anhalt-Bernburg.

Gustaf-Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow

Gustaf-Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (February 26, 1633 – October 6, 1695) was the last ruler of Mecklenburg-Güstrow from 1636 until his death and last Lutheran Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Ratzeburg from 1636 to 1648.

A minor upon his father’s death in 1636, his uncle Duke Adolf-Friedrich I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin at first became regent at Güstrow, fiercely opposed by Gustaf-Adolph’s mother. In 1654 he came of age and married Magdalene-Sibylle, a daughter of Duke Friedrich III of Holstein-Gottorp (1597-1659) and his wife Marie-Elisabeth of Saxony (1610-1684).

Magdalene-Sibylle of Holstein-Gottorp

Their marriage produced eleven children:

* Johann, Hereditary Prince of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (1655 –1660).

* Eleonore (1657 – 1672).

* Marie (1659 – 1701), married on September 23, 1684 to Duke Adolf-Friedrich II of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

* Magdalene (1660 – 1702).

* Sophie (1662 – 1738), married on December 6, 1700 to Duke Christian-Ulrich I of Württemberg-Oels.

Hereditary Prince Charles, of Mecklenburg-Güstrow

The death of the only surviving son, the Hereditary Prince Charles, in 1688 at the age of 23, caused a succession crisis in Mecklenburg-Güstrow. Gustaf-Adolph’s daughter Marie married her cousin Adolf-Friedrich II of Mecklenburg, who after the death of his father-in-law claimed the Güstrow heritage, but could not prevail against the ruling duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Christian-Ludwig I. A younger daughter, Louise in 1695 married the Danish and Norwegian Crown Prince and in 1699 became queen consort of Denmark when her husband succeeded to the throne as King Frederik IV.

Gustaf-Adolph died in Güstrow at the age of 62. The subsequent inheritance conflict within the House of Mecklenburg was settled by the establishment of the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in 1701.

Christian-Ludwig I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin was initially born with just the name Christian. He inherited Mecklenburg-Schwerin when his father Duke Adolf-Friedrich I died on February 27, 1658. In 1660, Christian built a Lustschloss near the Ratzeburg Minster. He travelled to Paris in 1662, to the court of Louis XIV. On 29 September 1663, he converted to the Catholic faith. The next day, his godfather Louis XIV gave him the second name Louis (German: Ludwig). Later, however, he often signed only with Christian.

Christian-Ludwig I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin

Christian-Ludwig I married twice. His first wife was his cousin Christine-Margaret of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (1615 – 1666), the second daughter of Duke Johann-Albert II of Mecklenburg-Güstrow. She was the widow of Duke Franz-Albert of Saxe-Lauenburg, whom she had married on February 21, February 1640.

Franz-Albert had died on June 10, 1642 from wounds he had received in the battle of Świdnica. Christine-Margaret married Christian-Ludwig I on July 6, 1650 in Hamburg. However, on October 16, 1660, a divorce was pronounced by an ecclesiastical court composed specifically for this case by Christian-Ludwig I. Christine-Margaret never recognized the divorce. It was, however, declared valid by a committee of ten professors of canon law of the University of Paris the Sorbonne. The divorce was confirmed by Pope Alexander VII on October 3, 1663.

His second wife was Elisabeth-Angelique de Montmorency, Duchesse de Coligny, (b. 1626). She was the widow Gaspard IV de Coligny, the son of Gaspard III de Coligny. Her first husband had died at Charenton-le-Pont on February 6, 1649 during the Fronde. The exact date of Elisabeth-Angelique’s wedding to Christian-Ludwig I is not known with certainty, but it was probably on March 3, 1664. She died on January 23 or 24 1695 in Paris.

Both marriages were childless. When Christian-Ludwig I died, he was succeeded by his nephew Friedrich-Wilhelm, the eldest son of Christian-Ludwig I’s brother Duke Friedrich of Mecklenburg-Grabow and his wife Christine of Hesse-Homburg.

After the extinction of the Mecklenburg-Güstrow line of the dynasty with the death of Duke Gustaf-Adolf in 1695, Friedrich-Wilhelm became embroiled in a violent succession dispute with his uncle Adolf-Friedrich that escalated quickly. It brought the country to the brink of civil war and was settled only through the intervention of foreign powers. The king of Denmark and Norway, Frederik IV, gave up the inheritance request for the Mecklenburg-Güstrow principality in exchange for the Duke’s support for Denmark-Norway in the Great Northern War.

Duke Friedrich-Wilhelm of Mecklenburg-Schwerin

Duke Friedrich-Wilhelm married Sophie-Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel on January 2, 1704 in Cassel. She was one of seventeen children of Count Charles I of Hesse-Cassel and his wife Maria Amalia of Courland (1653–1711), the daughter of Jacob Kettler, Duke of Courland. The couple had no children. Friedrich-Wilhelm had numerous mistresses, with whom he had at least nine children.

Duke Friedrich-Wilhelm was succeeded by his brother, Charles-Leopold of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in 1713, (November 16, 1678 – November 28, 1747) was Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin from 1713 to 1747.

Charles-Leopold was the second son of Friedrich, Duke of Mecklenburg-Grabow, and his wife Christine von Hessen-Homburg (1653–1722).Charles-Leopold married three times. His first wife was Sophia-Hedwig of Nassau-Dietz (1690–1734), daughter of Heinrich-Casimir II, Prince of Nassau-Dietz, and his wife Henriëtte-Amalia of Anhalt-Dessau. They married on May 12, 1709 in Leeuwarden and divorced in 1710. There were no children from this marriage.

Charles-Leopold of Mecklenburg-Schwerin

His second wife was Christine von Lepel (1692–1728), daughter of Nicolaus-Friedrich von Lepel and his wife Leveka von Plessen. They married on June 7, 1710 at Doberau and divorced on October 2, 1711. There were no children from this marriage, either.

His third wife was the Grand Duchess Catherine Ivanovna of Russia, daughter of Czar Ivan V of Russia and his wife Praskovia Saltykova. They married on April 19, 1716 in Danzig. There was one daughter born of this marriage, the Grand Duchess Anna Leopoldovna of Russia. She married Duke Anthon-Ulrich of Brunswick and had 5 children. She served as Regent of Russia for her son Ivan VI from 1740 to 1741.

Charles-Leopold was succeeded by his younger brother Christian Ludwig II of Mecklenburg (May 15, 1683 – May 30, 1756) and he was the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin from 1747 to 1756.

Christian-Ludwig II of Mecklenburg-Schwerin

Christian-Ludwig II married his cousin Duchess Gustave-Caroline of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1694 – 1748) was the the fourth daughter of Adolf-Friedrich II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Princess Maria of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (1659 – 1701), daughter of Gustaf-Adolf, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.

Gustave-Caroline was also a younger sister of Adolf-Friedrich III, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Through her father’s third marriage, she was an aunt of Queen Charlotte of the United Kingdom, wife of King George III.
