Background

John IV was the only son of the Duke Magnus I of Mecklenburg and his wife Elisabeth of Pommern-Wolgast. After the death of his father in 1384 and his cousin Albert IV in 1388, John ruled Mecklenburg jointly with his uncle Albert III (also a King of Sweden).

Career

Ernst Boll incorrectly refers to him as "John III" in his History of Mecklenburg, Participant 1. When Albert III was captured by the Danes in 1389 in connection with his rule in Sweden, John ruled as sole Regent of Mecklenburg until Albert"s release in 1395. After Albert"s death in 1412, John ruled joinly with Albert"s son Albert V. On 13 February 1419, John, Albert V of Mecklenburg and the Council of the City of Rostock founded the University of Rostock, the first university in northern Germany and in the entire Baltic region.

In this case, he probably acted as a leader of the Victual Brothers.

The Germans had 900 infantry, their leader was called Enis, a German and a relative of Albert. Another leader was called "Maekingborg", also a relative of Albert.

This "Enis" is probably John IV.
