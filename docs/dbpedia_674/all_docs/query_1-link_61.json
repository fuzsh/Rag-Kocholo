In 1761 she was selected unseen after the British king asked for a review of all eligible German Protestant princesses. The marriage was a success, and the couple had 15 children, including George IV. After the king was declared insane (1811), Parliament turned to the future George IV, while Charlotte was given custody of her husband."
