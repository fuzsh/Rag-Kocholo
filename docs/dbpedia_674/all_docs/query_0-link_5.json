        "text": "by Susan Flantzer\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2023\n\nSophia Friederike of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Hereditary Princess of Denmark and Norway, the mother of King Christian VIII of Denmark, was born on August 24, 1758, in Schwerin, Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, now in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. She was the second of the two children and the only daughter of Ludwig, Hereditary Prince of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Princess Charlotte Sophie of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Sophia Friederike’s paternal grandparents were Christian Ludwig II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Duchess Gustave Caroline of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Her maternal grandparents were Franz Josias, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and Anna Sophie of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt.\n\nSophia Friederike had one older brother:\n\nFriedrich Franz I, the first Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1756 – 1837), married Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, had eight children including Charlotte Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Hereditary Princess of Denmark, the divorced first wife of her first cousin King Christian VIII of Denmark and the mother of King Frederik VII of Denmark\n\nOn October 21, 1774, 16-year-old Sophia Friederike married 21-year-old Hereditary Prince Frederik of Denmark and Norway, the only child of King Frederik V of Denmark and Norway and his second wife Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. When Sophia Friederike first met Frederik, she was disappointed by his less favorable appearance. She had some difficulty in settling at the Danish court and repeatedly complained of its dullness. Although the couple eventually became fond of each other, they both had lovers and the father of Sophia Friederike’s children was rumored to be her husband’s adjutant Frederik von Blücher (in Danish).\n\nSophia Friederike and Frederik had two stillborn daughters before the birth of their five children. Through their daughter Louise Charlotte, they are the ancestors of the Belgian, British, Danish, Luxembourg, Norwegian, and Spanish royal families and the former royal families of Greece and Romania.\n\nPrincess Juliana Marie of Denmark (born and died 1784), died in infancy\n\nKing Christian VIII of Denmark (1786 – 1848), married (1) his first cousin Charlotte Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, divorced, had one son King Frederik VII of Denmark (2) Caroline Amalie of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, no children\n\nPrincess Juliane Sophia of Denmark (1788 – 1850), married Landgrave Wilhelm of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld (link in German), no children\n\nPrincess Louise Charlotte of Denmark (1789 – 1864), married Prince Wilhelm of Hesse-Kassel, had six children including Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel who married King Christian IX of Denmark, the current Danish royal family descends from this marriage as do the Belgian, British, Luxembourg, Norwegian, and Spanish royal families and the former royal families of Greece and Romania\n\nHereditary Prince Ferdinand of Denmark (1792 – 1863), heir presumptive to the Danish throne from 1848 until his death, married his first cousin once removed Princess Caroline of Denmark, the elder of the two daughters of King Frederik VI of Denmark, no children\n\nAt the time of the marriage, Frederik’s elder half-brother Christian VII, the son of King Frederik V of Denmark and Norway and his first wife, Princess Louisa of Great Britain, was King of Denmark and Norway. Soon after Christian VII’s succession, it became clear that he was not quite normal. It is unknown if Christian’s mental illness was caused by the brutal childhood treatment of his governor Christian Ditlev Reventlow, Count of Reventlow, possible porphyria inherited from his Hanover mother, or schizophrenia. Christian’s symptoms included paranoia, self-mutilation, and hallucinations. It was becoming clearer and clearer that Christian could not fulfill his role as king. Eventually, as a result of King Christian VII’s mental illness, Sophia Friederike’s husband Frederik and his mother Queen Dowager Juliana Maria became involved in major political manipulations. Their actions, of course, would affect Sophia Friederike and her status in the Danish royal family.\n\nOn a trip that had been arranged because it was believed that new environments could change King Christian VII’s behavior, Christian became acquainted with the physician Johann Friedrich Struensee. Struensee was the first person who understood that Christian was seriously ill. When Christian came home from the trip, Struensee accompanied him and was employed as Christian’s personal physician. Because of Christian’s confidence in him, Struensee gained political power. He also became the lover of Christian VII’s ill-treated wife, born Princess Caroline Matilda of Wales, whose marriage was less than satisfactory. When Caroline Matilda gave birth to her daughter Louise, no one doubted that Struensee was the father of the princess. In 1772, Frederik’s mother, Queen Dowager Juliana Maria, maneuvered a coup that would bring about the fall of Struensee and discredit Caroline Matilda. Juliana Maria arranged for King Christian VII to sign the arrest warrant of Struensee after she had already made the arrest in the name of the king. Struensee was executed and Caroline Matilda was exiled for the rest of her life.\n\nAfter the fall of Struensee, Frederik and his mother Juliana Maria took charge of the Council of State. Christian VII was only nominally king from 1772 onward. Crown Prince Frederik (the future King Frederik VI), King Christian VII’s son, had no intention of allowing his uncle Frederik and his stepgrandmother Juliana Maria to continue their rule. In 1784, Crown Prince Frederik reached the age of legal majority and then ruled permanently as Prince Regent. He somehow managed to get his insane father to sign an order dismissing the supporters of his Frederik and Juliana Maria’s supporters from the Council of State and declaring that no royal order was legal unless co-signed by the Crown Prince, thereby deposing Frederik and Juliana Maria. After losing power, Frederik’s political career came to an end, his family’s status in the Danish royal family was greatly diminished, and he and Sophia Friederike lived as private people for the rest of their lives.\n\nOn November 29, 1794, Sophia Friederike, aged thirty-six, died at Sorgenfri Palace in Kongens Lyngby, Denmark, north of Copenhagen. She was buried at Roskilde Cathedral in Roskilde, Denmark, the traditional burial site of the Danish royal family. Hereditary Prince Frederik survived his wife by eleven years, dying at Amalienborg in Copenhagen, Denmark on December 7, 1805, at the age of 52. He also was buried at Roskilde Cathedral. Because King Frederick VI, Frederik’s nephew, the son of his half-brother King Christian VII, had two daughters but no sons, upon his death in 1839, he was succeeded by the son of Sophia Friederike and Frederik, King Christian VIII.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

She was born in Schwerin, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, now in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, on September 20, 1886, to Friedrich Franz III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia.\n\nCecilie had two older siblings:\n\nAlexandrine (1879-1952) – married King Christian X of Denmark, had issue\n\nGrand Duke Friedrich Franz IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1882-1945) – married Princess Alexandra of Hanover and Cumberland, had issue\n\nDuring the wedding celebrations of her brother Friedrich Franz in June 1904, Cecilie got to know Crown Prince Wilhelm who was representing his father Wilhelm II, German Emperor and King of Prussia. On September 4, 1904, Cecilie and Wilhelm celebrated their engagement at the Mecklenburg-Schwerin hunting lodge. Cecilie married Crown Prince Wilhelm in ceremonies held on June 6, 1905, in the Royal Chapel of the Berlin Palace and the Berlin Cathedral in Berlin, Kingdom of Prussia, now in Brandenburg, Germany.\n\nThey had six children:\n\nPrince Wilhelm (1906-1940) – married Dorothea von Salviati, had issue\n\nPrince Ludwig Ferdinand (1907-1994) – married Grand Duchess Kira Kirillovna of Russia, had issue\n\nPrince Hubertus (1909-1950) – married (1) Baroness Maria von Humboldt-Dachroeden, no issue; (2) Princess Magdalena Reuss of Köstritz, had issue\n\nPrince Friedrich Georg (1911-1966) – married Lady Brigid Guinness, had issue\n\nPrincess Alexandrine (1915-1980) – unmarried\n\nPrincess Cecilie (1917-1975) – married Clyde Kenneth Harris, had issue\n\nFollowing their marriage, the couple made their home at the Marble Palace in Potsdam, Kingdom of Prussia, now in Brandenburg, Germany, for the summers, and the Crown Prince’s Palace in Berlin for the winters and court season. Years later they had Cecilienhof built in the New Garden in Potsdam, near the Marble Palace. Construction was completed in 1917 and the family moved in right away. Although seemingly happy at first, the couple soon began to have difficulties. Wilhelm was a perpetual womanizer and made little attempt to keep any of his affairs quiet. He would often boast to Cecilie of his escapades, once even bringing her to the point of considering suicide. Despite this, their family continued to grow with the birth of their six children.\n\nAs Crown Princess, Cecilie was immensely popular and took on charity work. She particularly enjoyed working with organizations that promoted and provided education for women. She traveled extensively, including a visit to the United Kingdom in 1911 to attend the coronation of King George V of the United Kingdom. A friendship developed between Cecilie and the British Queen Mary, and the two maintained a correspondence until Mary’s death in 1953. When the German Empire fell in 1918, Cecilie’s husband and father-in-law went into exile in the Netherlands. Cecilie first left Cecilienhof for the safety of the Neues Palais with her mother-in-law, but was soon given permission to return to her home, and ensured of her safety. However, her husband was not permitted back into the country at that time.\n\nThe family managed to retain numerous personal properties, including Oels Castle in Silesia, where she met her husband in November 1923 after five years of separation. By then, it was a marriage “in name only”. In 1926, a settlement was reached between the German State and the former royal family. Cecilienhof became the property of the state, but Cecilie and Wilhelm were given the right of residence for three generations. Cecilie based herself at Cecilienhof and stayed active in charitable organizations such as the Queen Luise Fund, the Fatherland’s Women Union, and the Ladies of the Order of St. John. All of these were later abolished in 1933 by Adolf Hitler.\n\nCecilie continued to live a private life at Cecilienhof in the years leading up to World War II. In May 1938, her son Ludwig Ferdinand married Grand Duchess Kira, the daughter of the pretender to the Russian throne, at Cecilienhof. This would be the last big family occasion before the war. In the midst of the war, her father-in-law died in 1941 and her husband became head of the House of Hohenzollern. The family spent most of their time at Oels Castle but returned to Potsdam in 1944 to celebrate Christmas. In February 1945, they left Cecilienhof for the last time, fleeing the Red Army. Their beloved home Cecilehof was seized by the Soviets. It would later be the site of the Potsdam Conference in the summer of 1945 – hosting British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, US President Harry Truman, and Soviet leader Josef Stalin.\n\nCecilie settled in Bad Kissingen, Germany for the next several years, while her husband lived in Hechingen until his death in July 1951. The following year, Cecilie moved to an apartment in the Frauenkopf district in Stuttgart. That same year, her memoirs were published and she made another visit to England where she attended the christening of her granddaughter and enjoyed a final visit with Queen Mary. Later that year, her sister, Queen Alexandrine of Denmark, died and Cecilie never fully recovered from the loss.\n\nCecilie, German Crown Princess and Crown Princess of Prussia, died on May 6, 1954 – her late husband’s birthday – while visiting Bad Kissingen. She was buried six days later beside her husband at Hohenzollern Castle in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

She was born at Grabow Castle in Grabow, Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, now in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on May 6, 1685, the only daughter of Friedrich, Duke of Mecklenburg-Grabow and Christine Wilhelmine of Hesse-Homburg. Sophie Luise had three older brothers:\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1675-1713) – married Sophie Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel, no issue\n\nKarl Leopold, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1678-1747) – married (1) Sophie Hedwig of Nassau-Dietz, no issue; (2) Christine von Lepel, no issue; (3) Grand Duchess Catherine Ivanovna of Russia, had issue\n\nChristian Ludwig II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1683-1756) – married Duchess Gustave Caroline of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, had issue\n\nIn Berlin on November 28, 1708, Sophie Luise married Friedrich I, King in Prussia, as his third wife. The couple had no children. Being so much younger than her husband, and close in age to his children, Sophie struggled to find acceptance at the Prussian court. It did not help that her predecessor Sophie Charlotte of Hanover was greatly loved and admired by the Prussian people, and many saw Sophie Luise as a poor replacement. The King surrounded her with courtiers who did not serve her best interests, and she avoided them as best she could, instead of spending most of her time with the lady-in-waiting who had accompanied her from Mecklenburg.\n\nOver time, Sophie Luise became deeply religious, spending the majority of her time in prayer and listening to sermons, and often avoiding her duties as Queen Consort. As time progressed, her devotion became almost obsessive and manic. This caused distance between her and her husband, particularly because of her overzealous attempts to get him to convert from Calvinism to Lutheranism. This led to her husband Friedrich removing her closest confidantes and courtiers, and soon Sophie Luise became even more deeply entrenched in what is described as her obsession with religion, resulting in depression and mental derangement.\n\nFriedrich was mostly unaware of Sophie Luise’s mental decline, until several months before his own death. Deeply ill, he awoke to find his wife standing before him, covered in blood and screaming at him. She had crashed through a glass door while running from her apartments to his, apparently to confront him in a fit of hysteria. Sophie Luise had no recollection of the event afterward, and Friedrich soon sent her back to Mecklenburg to be with her family. He would die just months later in 1713.\n\nSophie Luise, Queen in Prussia, lived the rest of her life with her widowed mother and died on July 29, 1735, at Schwerin Castle in Mecklenburg, Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, now in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. She is buried in the Schelfkirche St. Nikolai in Schwerin.\n\nThe Sophienkirche in Berlin is named for Sophie Luise. Construction began during the reign of her husband Friedrich I, but he died just months before it was completed in 1713. His successor Friedrich Wilhelm I, the son of his second wife Sophie Charlotte of Hanover, refused to name the church after his stepmother Sophie Luise as had been intended, consecrating it as the Spandauischekirche (Spandau Church). Later, when Friedrich Wilhelm I’s son Friedrich II (the Great) came to the throne, he renamed it the Sophienkirche (Sophie Church), which remains the name to this day.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

She was fifth of the six children and the youngest of the two daughters of Friedrich Franz I, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.\n\nCharlotte Frederica had five siblings:\n\nFriedrich Ludwig (1778 – 1819), married (1) Elena Pavlovna of Russia, daughter of Paul I, Emperor of All Russia, had two children (2) Caroline Louise of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, had three children (3) Auguste of Hesse-Homburg, no children\n\nLouise Charlotte (1779 – 1801), married Augustus, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, had one child Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, the mother of Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Queen Victoria’s husband\n\nGustav Wilhelm (1781 – 1851), unmarried\n\nKarl (1782 – 1833), unmarried\n\nAdolf (1785 – 1821), unmarried\n\nDuring a visit to the court of his maternal uncle Friedrich Franz I, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Prince Christian of Denmark (the future King Christian VIII), the eldest son of Hereditary Prince Frederik of Denmark and Sophia Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin fell in love with his first cousin Charlotte Frederica, who was two years younger. Christian and Charlotte Frederica were married at Ludwigslust Palace in Ludwigslust, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, now in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, on June 21, 1806.\n\nChristian and Charlotte Frederica had two sons:\n\nChristian Friedrich (born and died April 8, 1807)\n\nKing Frederik VII of Denmark (1808 – 1863), married (1) Vilhelmine Marie of Denmark, daughter of King Frederik VI of Denmark, no children (2) Caroline Mariane of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, no children (3) Louise Rasmussen, Countess Danner, morganatic marriage, no children\n\nChristian and Charlotte Frederica’s marriage soon became unhappy. Charlotte Frederica had an affair with her singing teacher Édouard Du Puy. In 1809, when Christian found out, Charlotte Frederica was sent into exile in Horsens, Denmark while Du Puy was banished from Denmark. The marriage officially ended with a divorce in 1810 and Charlotte Frederica never saw her son again.\n\nWhile in Horsens and later in Aarhus, both in Denmark, Charlotte Frederica cultivated friendships with the local gentry and allegedly had affairs with army officers. In 1829, she was allowed to travel out of Denmark and moved to Carlsbad, a spa town, then in Bohemia, now in the Czech Republic. She made one last move in 1830 to Rome, Italy where she lived in the Palazzo Bernini on Rome’s main street and converted to Roman Catholicism.\n\nCharlotte Frederica had been exiled when her son, now King Frederik VI of Denmark, was only one year old. She had hoped to once again see her son but she soon became ill. Charlotte Frederica died in Rome on July 13, 1840, at the age of 55. She was buried in a tomb paid for by her son and created by the Danish sculptor Jens Adolf Jerichau at the Teutonic Cemetery, a burial site adjacent to St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City that had been dedicated to the German-speaking residents of Rome.\n\nOn July 11, 2019, the tomb of Charlotte Frederica and the adjacent tomb of Princess Sophia of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Bartenstein were opened to search for the remains of Emanuela Orlandi, a 15-year-old who disappeared in 1983. Not only was there no sign of Emanuela’s remains, but the remains of Princess Sophia and Duchess Charlotte Frederica were missing. Vatican officials said they would research the burial records to try to discover what happened to their remains. It is possible that their remains were moved due to renovations at the end of the 1800s and again in the 1960s and 1970s.

Marie was the only daughter and the third of the six children of Friedrich Franz II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and his first wife Augusta of Reuss-Köstritz.\n\nMarie’s mother died at the age of 40 when Marie was eight years old. The official cause was a heart valve inflammation but there is evidence that Grand Duchess Augusta died from tuberculosis. Tuberculosis was taboo in royal circles at the time and would have reduced the marriage prospects of her children.\n\nMarie had five siblings, all brothers:\n\nFriedrich Franz III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1851 – 1897), married Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia, had three children: his father’s heir Friedrich Franz IV, Alexandrine who married King Christian X of Denmark, and Cecilie who married Wilhelm, German Crown Prince\n\nDuke Paul Friedrich of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1852 – 1923), married Princess Marie of Windisch-Graetz, had four children.\n\nDuke Nikolaus of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1855 – 1856), died in infancy\n\nDuke Johann Albrecht of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1857 – 1920) he married (1) Princess Elisabeth Sybille of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, no children (2) Princess Elisabeth of Stolberg-Rossla, no children\n\nDuke Alexander of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (born and died 1859\n\nMarie’s father married a second time but his wife Princess Anna of Hesse and by Rhine died shortly after giving birth to a daughter, Marie’s half-sister:\n\nDuchess Anna of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1865 – 1882), died at age 16 from pneumonia\n\nGrand Duke Friedrich Franz II married a third time in 1868 and Marie was then raised by a stepmother, Princess Marie of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, who was only four years older than her. Marie had four half-siblings from her father’s third marriage:\n\nDuchess Elisabeth Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1869 – 1955), married Friedrich August II, Grand Duke of Oldenburg, had five children.\n\nDuke Friedrich Wilhelm of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1871 – 1897), a naval officer in the German Imperial Navy, died at age 26 when a torpedo boat capsized in the estuary of the Elbe River\n\nDuke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1873 – 1969), married (1) Viktoria Feodora of Reuss-Schleiz, had one daughter (2) Elisabeth of Stolberg-Rossla, no children\n\nDuke Heinrich of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1876 – 1934), married Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, had one daughter: Queen Juliana of the Netherlands\n\nMarie’s childhood was marked by the wars of German unification. Her father Friedrich Franz II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin was the nephew of King Wilhelm I of Prussia. Friedrich Franz supported Prussia and distinguished himself in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 – 1871. As a result of the war, the German states proclaimed their union as the German Empire under the Prussian King Wilhelm I, finally uniting Germany as a nation-state with Wilhelm I becoming the German Emperor.\n\nIn 1871, while traveling with his family through the various German monarchies, twenty-year-old Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia, the second surviving son of Alexander II, Emperor of All Russia, met his seventeen-year-old second cousin Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. The two young people were descended from Paul I, Emperor of All Russia and Friedrich Wilhelm III, King of Prussia. Vladimir and Marie quickly fell in love and Marie broke off her engagement to Georg Albert, Prince of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt.\n\nHowever, Marie, who was Lutheran, refused to convert to Russian Orthodoxy. This caused a three-year delay in the marriage until Vladimir’s father, Alexander II allowed Marie to remain Lutheran and ruled that Vladimir could still retain his succession rights. The engagement was announced in April 1874. The wedding was held at the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, Russia on August 28, 1874, After marriage, the bride was known as Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna.\n\nThe marriage caused Maria to have some brilliant alliances: She would be the sister-in-law of Alexander III, Emperor of All Russia and Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna who had married Prince Alfred of the United Kingdom, a son of Queen Victoria. She would be the aunt of Nicholas II, Emperor of All Russia and Queen Marie of Romania.\n\nVladimir and Maria had five children:\n\nGrand Duke Alexander Vladimirovich (1875 – 1877), died in early childhood\n\nGrand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich (1876 – 1938), married his first cousin Victoria Melita of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, had three children\n\nGrand Duke Boris Vladimirovich (1877 – 1943), married (1919) his mistress Zinaida Rashevskaya, no children\n\nGrand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich (1879 – 1956), married (1921) his mistress, the famous ballerina Matilde Kschessinskaya (known as Princess Romanovskaya-Krasinskaya after her marriage), her son Prince Vladimir Romanovsky-Krasinsky could be the son of Andrei or his cousin Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich\n\nGrand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna (1882 – 1957), married Prince Nicholas of Greece, had three daughters including Princess Marina of Greece who married Prince George, Duke of Kent, son of King George V of the United Kingdom\n\nVladimir and Maria moved into the new 360-room Vladimir Palace on the Palace Embankment facing the Neva River just down the road from the Winter Palace in St.Petersburg. The yellow facade of the palace is in the Florentine Renaissance style and the interior is a mixture of Moorish, Gothic, and Rococo styles. It was the last imperial palace built in St. Petersburg. Across the Neva River was a view of the Peter and Paul Fortress and within the Fortress, the Peter and Paul Cathedral with its gilded spire with a flying angel at the very top. Vladimir and Maria enjoyed entertaining and Vladimir Palace became the heart of St. Petersburg’s social life. Marie was socially ambitious and established herself as one of the best hostesses in the capital. Her addiction to gambling caused her to defy Nicholas II’s prohibition on playing roulette and baccarat in private homes and she was temporarily banned from Court.\n\nIn 1905, Maria Pavlovna’s eldest son Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich married his first cousin, Princess Victoria Melita of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Victoria Melita was the daughter of Prince Alfred of the United Kingdom, Duke of Edinburgh and Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (second son of Queen Victoria) and Vladimir’s sister Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia. Because Kirill married his first cousin, prohibited by the Russian Orthodox Church, and because he had not received the consent of Nicholas II to marry, he was stripped of his imperial titles, military appointments, and funding. The couple was banished from Russia and settled in France. Grand Duke Vladimir went into a rage after a brief interview with his nephew Nicholas II and resigned from all his posts in the army.\n\nOn February 17, 1909, 61-year-old Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich died suddenly after suffering a major cerebral hemorrhage. His funeral and burial, held on February 21, 1909, was attended by Nicholas II, Vladimir’s widow Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, other members of the Imperial Family, government ministers, and Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria. Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich was buried in the Grand Ducal Mausoleum, adjacent to the Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\nIn 1909, following several deaths within the Imperial Family including Vladimir’s, Kirill was third in line to the Russian throne after Nicholas II’s hemophiliac son Alexei and Nicholas’ younger brother Michael. Nicholas II relented and allowed Kirill to return to Russia, restoring his Imperial titles, his military positions, and his funding. Maria Pavlovna finally decided to convert to Russian Orthodoxy to help Kirill’s possibility of inheriting the throne.\n\nMaria Pavlovna was proud to have given birth to strong sons who were potential heirs to the throne, while Empress Alexandra, her niece by marriage, had four daughters before giving birth to a son with hemophilia, a hereditary disease transmitted by the Empress. Maria Pavlovna was the oldest of the Grand Duchesses and formed an alternative court during the last years of Nicholas II’s reign. Together with her sons, Maria Pavlovna planned a coup against Nicholas II during the winter of 1916-1917, which would force his abdication. However, Maria and her sons found no allies to support their coup.\n\nAfter the abdication of Nicholas II in March 1917 and the advent of the Russian Revolution, Maria Pavlovna still hoped that her eldest son Kirill would one day be Emperor of All Russia. When other Romanovs were leaving Russia, including her son Kirill and his family, Maria spent 1917-1918 with her son Boris, her son Andrei, his lover Matilde Kschessinskaya, and her son Vladimir in the war-torn Caucasus. With the advance of the Bolsheviks, they fled to Anapa, Russia on the Black Sea, where they spent another fourteen months. However, Boris decided to leave Russia once he reached Anapa.\n\nWhen the Commander of the White Army told Maria Pavlovna that the Bolsheviks would win the Russian Civil War, she finally agreed to go into exile. On February 13, 1920, Maria Pavlovna, her son Andrei, his mistress Matilde Kschessinska, and her son Vladimir boarded an Italian ship in the direction of Venice, Italy. They traveled from Venice to Switzerland and then to France, where Maria Pavlovna’s health failed. Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna died on September 6, 1920, aged 66, surrounded by her family at her villa (now the Hotel La Souveraine) in Contrexéville, France.\n\nGrand Duchess Maria Pavlovna was buried in the Chapel of St. Vladimir and St. Mary Magdalene in Contrexéville, France which she had built in 1909. Her son Andrei and his wife were also buried there.\n\nGrand Duchess Maria Pavlovna had a passion for jewelry and her collection was renowned. She was one of the few members of the Romanov family who managed to get her jewelry out of Russia. British art dealer and diplomatic courier Albert Stopford, a family friend, rescued the jewelry from her Vladimir Palace safe and smuggled the jewels out of Russia to England. After Maria Pavlovna’s death, the jewelry was sold by her children to support their lives in exile. Queen Mary of the United Kingdom purchased some of the jewelry including the Vladimir Tiara. Maria Pavlovna had received the tiara as a gift from her husband at the time of their wedding. Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna inherited the tiara from her mother. Queen Mary bought the tiara in 1921 and had the tiara altered to accommodate fifteen of the Cambridge cabochon emeralds. The original drop pearls can easily be replaced as an alternative to the emeralds. Queen Mary personally gave the tiara to her granddaughter Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

In 1701, the last division created the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna recognized both Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz as grand duchies. Friedrich Franz I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin became the first Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. On November 14, 1918, at the end of World War I, Friedrich Franz IV was forced to abdicate as Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Today the territory encompassing the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin is in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.\n\n********************\n\nGrand Duke Friedrich Franz IV was the last reigning Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He was born in Palermo, Italy on April 9, 1882, the only son of Grand Duke Friedrich Franz III of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia. He had two sisters:\n\nDuchess Alexandrine (1879-1952) – married King Christian X of Denmark, had issue\n\nDuchess Cecilie (1886-1954) – married Wilhelm, German Crown Prince, had issue\n\nHe also had a half-brother – Alexis Louis de Wenden – his mother’s illegitimate son, born in 1902.\n\nFriedrich Franz attended the Vitzthum Gymnasium in Dresden, Kingdom of Saxony, and then studied law at the University of Bonn. He became Grand Duke upon his father’s death in April 1897. Because he was still a minor, his uncle Duke Johann Albrecht, served as regent until Friedrich Franz came of age in 1901. Once he had taken control of his government, the young Grand Duke attempted to reform the Mecklenburg constitution. However, his efforts failed when the government of Mecklenburg-Strelitz refused to agree to his ideas.\n\nEncouraged to marry young by his mother, Friedrich Franz married Princess Alexandra of Hanover and Cumberland in Gmunden, Austria on June 7, 1904. She was the daughter of Ernst August, Crown Prince of Hanover and Princess Thyra of Denmark. The couple had five children:\n\nHereditary Grand Duke Friedrich Franz (1910-2001) – married Karin Elisabeth von Schaper, no issue\n\nDuke Christian Ludwig (1912-1996) – married Princess Barbara of Prussia, had issue\n\nDuchess Olga (1916-1917) – died in infancy\n\nDuchess Thyra (1919-1981) – unmarried\n\nDuchess Anastasia (1922-1979) – married Prince Friedrich Ferdinand of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, had issue\n\nIn February 1918, Friedrich Franz IV began to serve as Regent for the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The reigning Grand Duke, Adolf Friedrich VI, had died by suicide, and the heir presumptive was serving with the Russian military and had made it known that he wished to renounce his rights of succession. The regency lasted only nine months, because in 1918, after the end of World War I, Friedrich Franz IV was forced to abdicate as Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, as well as the Regent in Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nForced to leave the grand duchy, Friedrich Franz and his family traveled to Denmark at the invitation of his sister Queen Alexandrine. There, they lived at Sorgenfri Palace for a year, before being permitted to return to Mecklenburg, Germany, and recovering several of the family’s properties. They lived for two years at the Gelbensande hunting lodge (link in German), and then in 1921, took up residence at Ludwigslust Palace in Ludwigslust, Germany. They also spent their summers at the Alexandrine Cottage (link in German) in Heiligendamm, Germany.\n\nAt the end of World War II, with the advance of the Soviet Union’s Red Army, Friedrich Franz, along with his wife and son Christian Ludwig, fled to Glücksburg Castle, in Glücksburg, Germany, the home of his youngest daughter and her husband, with the intention of returning to Denmark. However, the Grand Duke became ill, and while under house arrest at the Castle, he died there on November 17, 1945. He is buried in the New Cemetery in Glücksburg, Germany.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

She was born at the Peterhof Palace in St. Petersburg, Russia, on July 28, 1860, the second child and only daughter of Grand Duke Mikhail Nikolaevich of Russia son of Nicholas I, Emperor of All Russia, and Princess Cecilie Auguste of Baden. Anastasia had six brothers. Her brother Sergei was among the five other Romanovs murdered by the Bolsheviks along with Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna on July 18, 1918. Two of her brothers, Nicholas and George, were among the four Grand Dukes murdered by the Bolsheviks on January 28, 1919.\n\nGrand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich (1859-1919) – unmarried\n\nGrand Duke Mikhail Mikhailovich (1861-1929) – married Countess Sophie of Merenberg, had issue\n\nGrand Duke George Mikhailovich (1863-1919) – married Princess Maria of Greece and Denmark, had issue\n\nGrand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich (1866-1933 – married Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, daughter of Alexander III, Emperor of All Russia, had issue\n\nGrand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich (1869-1918) – unmarried\n\nGrand Duke Alexei Mikhailovich (1875-1895) – unmarried\n\nWhen Anastasia was just two years old, her father was appointed Viceroy of the Caucasus and the family moved to Georgia where she was raised. The favorite of her father, and doted on by her brothers, Anastasia grew to become a very strong-willed and intelligent young woman. Educated privately at home, she developed a love of languages, becoming fluent in French, German, and English at a very young age.\n\nOn May 4, 1878, the engagement of Grand Duchess Anastasia and the future Grand Duke Friedrich Franz III of Mecklenburg-Schwerin was announced. The marriage was arranged by Anastasia’s future sister-in-law Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin who had married Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia. Anastasia and her fiancé were second cousins, both great-grandchildren of King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia. They were married at the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, Russia on January 24, 1879, in both Orthodox and Protestant services. Following their marriage, the couple settled in the Marienpalais in Schwerin, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, now in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany, and had three children:\n\nDuchess Alexandrine (1879-1952) – married King Christian X of Denmark, had issue\n\nGrand Duke Friedrich Franz IV (1882-1945) – married Princess Alexandra of Hanover and Cumberland, had issue\n\nDuchess Cecilie (1886-1954) – married Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, had issue\n\nDue to her husband’s health, Anastasia’s family traveled frequently to warmer climates. They were staying in Palermo, Italy when her husband became Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin on April 15, 1883. When they eventually returned to Schwerin, they took up residence at Schwerin Castle. The Grand Duke reached an agreement with the government that he would stay in Schwerin for five months each year but would travel elsewhere the rest of the year due to his health. They spent six months each year at Villa Wenden, their private home in Cannes, France, and preferred to stay at the Gelbensande hunting lodge when in the Grand Duchy.\n\nThe Grand Duchess was an avid tennis player and had courts built at Villa Wenden where she played quite often. She was also a frequent visitor to the casino in Monte Carlo, Monaco, often gambling away large amounts of her fortune.\n\nFollowing her husband’s death in April 1897, Anastasia inherited Villa Wenden and the hunting lodge in Gelbensande, along with most of his personal property. She spent as little time in Schwerin as possible, preferring Gelbensande and Cannes, and traveled often to St. Petersburg, Paris, and London.\n\nA scandal erupted in 1902 when Anastasia became pregnant from an affair with her personal secretary Vladimir Alexandrovitch Paltov. She gave birth to a son Alexis Louis de Wenden in Nice, France on December 23, 1902. The surname ‘de Wenden’ was granted by King Christian IX of Denmark. Anastasia, who first hid the fact that she was pregnant, raised the child herself. When news of the scandal spread through the royal houses of Europe, Anastasia was shunned by several royal houses, particularly the Prussian court. When her younger daughter Cecilie married the son of the German Emperor, who was particularly outspoken in his disdain for Anastasia, she was only permitted to come to Berlin twice – for Cecilie’s wedding in 1905, and for the birth of her first child the following year.\n\nWorld War I saw her family divided. Her son was a reigning German Grand Duke and her daughter was the daughter-in-law of the German Emperor, while her Russian brothers were on the opposing side. As the Dowager Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Anastasia was unable to remain in France. Because she placed her loyalty with the Russians, she was unable to return to Schwerin. Instead, she settled in Switzerland, living at the Savoy Hotel in Lausanne. The toll of the war was particularly devastating for Anastasia. She saw her son lose his throne and the murders of three of her brothers in Russia.\n\nFollowing World War I, Anastasia returned to France. Unwelcome as a German, she used her Russian passport to sneak into the country as part of her entourage of her cousin Princess Ekaterina Yourievskaya. She settled at Villa Fantasia in Èze, near Cannes, France, where she returned to her hectic social schedule and frequent trips to the Monte Carlo casinos.\n\nDowager Grand Duchess Anastasia died in Èze, France on March 11, 1922, after suffering a stroke. Her remains were returned to Schwerin where she was buried in the Helena Pavlovna Mausoleum (link in German) on the grounds of Ludwigslust Palace in Ludwigslust, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. Her funeral would be the first time her three legitimate children were together since the beginning of World War I.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
