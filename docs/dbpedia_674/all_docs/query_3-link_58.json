        "text": "Frederick Francis II. became heir apparent in 1842 in Schwerin and reigned until 1883. He ruled the country through the revolution in 1848/49 and until unification in 1871. His son, Frederick Francis III., suffered from asthma and lived in Cannes most of the time, where he fell from a balcony in 1897. As Frederick Francis IV. was still a minor his uncle, Duke John Albert, took over the regency until 1901. In 1912 his sister Alexandrine became Queen of Denmark. The younger sister, Cecilie, married William of Prussia, the heir to the throne, and should have become German Empress but this was prevented by the abdication of Emperor William II. in 1918. Frederick William II. ruled in Mecklenburg-Strelitz from 1860-1904 and conservatively and uncompromisingly wrote off the countryâ€™s debts.\n\nPrince William of Preussen (1797-1888) is chosen as successor to the throne as early as 1830, when it appears likely that his older brother Frederick William IV. would remain childless. William accepts the regency in 1858 when the king succumbs to a serious illness. He is crowned in 1861. He becomes German Emperor in 1871, after the victory in the Franco-German War. He is succeeded by his son Frederick III. (1831-1888), the '99-day Emperor'. Wilhelm II. (1859-1941) becomes German Emperor after the premature death of his father."
