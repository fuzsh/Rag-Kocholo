        "text": "Wilhelm Ernst Karl Alexander Frederick Heinrich Bernhard Albert Georg Hermann (10 June 1876 - 24 April 1923) was the last Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.\n\nBiography\n\nHe was born in Weimar, the eldest son of Karl August of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, the Hereditary Grand Duke, and his wife Pauline of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.\n\nHe succeeded his grandfather Karl Alexander as Grand Duke on 5 January 1901 as his father had predeceased him.\n\nWilhelm Ernst created the new Weimar state with the direction of Hans Olde, Henry van de Velde and Adolf Brütt. Also, he renewed the University of Jena by Theodor Fischer from Munich as well as that Weimar theatres.\n\nIn the course of the construction of the monument setting for Karl Alexander by Adolf Brütt the old part of the town was distinguished altogether by a protection regulation from the development area of the new Weimar and the art nouveau. The statue, in marble, was finished in 1911.\n\nThe Dutch throne\n\nAccording to the Dutch Constitution, Wilhelm Ernst was in line to succeed to throne of the Netherlands (he was the grandson of Sophie of the Netherlands) after Queen Wilhelmina. The Dutch people, beginning in the 20th century feared this, for the possibility of German influence or even annexation of the Netherlands.\n\nIn order to prevent this, some lawyers tried to change the Constitution to exclude Wilhelm Ernst of the succession of the throne of the Netherlands. Another way, however, was this: he or his offspring -if Wilhelmina would die childless- would have to choose between the Dutch and the Weimar throne. The birth of Wilhelmina's daughter Juliana in 1909 made the chance for any member of the house Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach to inherit the Dutch throne smaller and with the amendment to the constitution of 1922 -according to which the right to succession was restricted to the offspring of Wilhelmina- disappeared entirely.\n\nAbdication\n\nOn 9 November 1918 Wilhelm Ernst -along with the rest of the German monarchs following the defeat of Germany in World War I- was forced to abdicate. His throne and all his lands were relinquished and he fled with his family to exile in Silesia, where he died four years later.\n\nDespite all his work for Weimar during his government, Wilhelm Ernst was a hated ruler. This was for his private life, where he was known to be a sadist; the day of his abdication, he was called the \"most unpopular prince in all Germany\".
