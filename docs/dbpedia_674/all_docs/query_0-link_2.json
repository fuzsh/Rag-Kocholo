        "text": "Duchess Elisabeth of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nPrincess Elisabeth of Stolberg-Rossla (German: Elisabeth zu Stolberg-Roßla; 23 July 1885, Roßla—16 October 1969, Eutin, Schleswig-Holstein) was the second wife of Duke Johann Albrecht of Mecklenburg, Regent of the Duchy of Brunswick.\n\nBorn into an ancient House of Stolberg, she was second daughter of Prince Botho of Stolberg-Rossla (1850-1893), son of Count Karl of Stolberg-Rossla (1822-1870) and his wife, Countess Bertha of Solms-Rödelheim and Assenheim (1824-1898). Her mother was Princess Hedwig of Ysenburg and Büdingen (1863-1925), eldest daughter of Bruno, 3rd Prince of Ysenburg and Büdingen and Princess Mathilde of Solms-Hohensolms-Lich (1842-1867).\n\nShe was married to Duke Johann Albrecht of Mecklenburg-Schwerin on 15 December 1909, a year after the death of his first wife Princess Elisabeth Sybille of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. Their marriage was childless.\n\nAfter her first husband's death in 1920, Elisabeth remarried to his half-brother, Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg, at Ludwigslust in Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Although this marriage also remained childless, she became stepmother to Duchess Woizlawa Feodora of Mecklenburg, who at the age of 100, was the oldest living royal and the oldest living resident of Gorwihl."
