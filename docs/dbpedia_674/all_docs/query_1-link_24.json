        "text": "Christian the Younger of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (September 20, 1599 – June 16, 1626), a member of the House of Welf, titular Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Halberstadt, was a German Protestant military leader during the early years of the Thirty Years’ War, fighting against the forces of the Imperial House of Habsburg, Royal Habsburg Spain, and the Catholic League.\n\nChristian was born in 1599 at the Gröningen Priory near Halberstadt (in today’s Saxony-Anhalt), the third son of Duke Heinrich Julius of Brunswick-Lüneburg (1564–1613) with his second wife Elisabeth of Denmark and Norway (1573–1625), who was the eldest daughter of the late King Frederik II of Denmark and his spouse Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, the daughter of Ulrich III, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow and Elizabeth of Denmark, the elder daughter of King Frederik I of Denmark and his second spouse Sophie of Pomerania.\n\nScottish ambassadors had at first concentrated their suit on Elisabeth of Denmark as a prospective wife for King James VI of Scotland, but King Frederik II betrothed Elisabeth to Duke Christian of Brunswick-Lüneburg, promising the Scots instead that “for the second daughter Anne, if the King did like her, he should have her”. King James VI of Scotland eventually married King Frederik II’s second daughter Anne in a proxy ceremony in Copenhagen in August 1589.\n\nThere were also other suitors for the princess. In addition to James VI of Scotland, Archduke Matthias of Austria (later Emperor Matthias) also had plans for a marriage to her, and during a visit to Denmark in February 1587, he had spoken to King Frederik II of Denmark about this, but nothing came of it, unknown for what reason. Presumably there have been religious concerns about this.\n\nPrince Heinrich Julius was Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg as well as the ruling Prince of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel from 1589 until his death. He also served as administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Halberstadt from 1566 and of the Prince-Bishopric of Minden between 1582 and 1585. Duke Heinrich Julius died on 30, July 1613.\n\nAfter his father’s death, the new Duke Christian of Brunswick-Lüneburg was educated by his maternal uncle, King Christian IV of Denmark, and attended the University of Helmstedt.\n\nAfter the death of his brother Rudolph in 1616, Christian, at the age of 17, was elected his successor as Lutheran administrator of the Halberstadt bishopric. Though he did not obtain any confirmation by Emperor Ferdinand II or the Catholic Church, this position provided him the necessary finances to start a military career.\n\nIn 1620 Christian joined the army of Prince Maurice of Orange and fought in the Netherlands against a Spanish army. Later he raised his own army and, in liege to Friedrich V, Prince-Elector Palatine of the Rhine he carried out three significant battles: the Battle of Höchst (1622), the Battle of Fleurus (1622), and lastly at the Battle of Stadtlohn (1623).\n\nDuke Christian participated in a number of plunderings and burnings along the France-Holy Roman Empire border and throughout the Netherlands. Christian fought alongside the Count of Mansfeld in the first two engagements, and suffered two losses to the Count of Tilly: an arguable one at Höchst, and his final one at Stadtlohn.\n\nChristian’s major success was at Fleurus, where his actions directly led to the relieving of the Protestant stronghold of Bergen op Zoom.\n\nDuring the Thirty Years War there was a plan that involved Duke Christian, Count of Mansfeld, and King Christian IV of Denmark-Norway, pushing from the United Provinces and from Denmark-Norway, Duke Christian found himself with ample financial backing.\n\nOrdered to advance on the Rhineland, he undertook this mission but quickly found himself checked by Tilly in Hesse, and opted this time to retreat rather than fight. Ill from the outset of the campaign, he died childless from wounds sustained in battle at Wolfenbüttel on June 16, 1626 at the age of 26.\n\nAs mentioned in the first post of this series, Adolf-Friedrich I ruled in Mecklenburg-Schwerin and it was his brother Johann-Albert II, who ruled as Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (May 5, 1590 – April 23, 1636).\n\nFrom 1608 to 1611, Johann-Albert II was the nominal ruler of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; the actual ruler being the regent, his great-uncle Charles I. From 1611 to 1621 Johann-Albert II and his brother Adolf-Friedrich I jointly ruled the whole Duchy of Mecklenburg. From 1621, John Albert ruled Mecklenburg-Güstrow alone.\n\nJohann-Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow\n\nMecklenburg-Güstrow was created for a third and final time with the partition of 1621, when Johann-Albert II received the Güstrow part of Mecklenburg.\n\n(I) Johann-Albert II was married three times. His first marriage on October 9, 1608 was to his cousin Margaret-Elisabeth of Mecklenburg, daughter of Duke Christopher of Mecklenburg. The couple had the following children:\n\n* Hans-Georg (1610-1660)\n\n* Johann-Christopher (1611–1612)\n\n* Elisabeth-Sophie (1613 – 1676) married Duke August II of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.\n\n* Christine-Margaret (1615 – 1666)\n\nmarried firstly on February 11, 1640 Franz-Albert of Saxe-Lauenburg, son of Franz II of Saxe-Lauenburg. Christine-Margaret married secondly, on July 6, 1650 her cousin Duke Christian-Ludwig I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. They divorced in 1663.\n\n* Charles-Heinrich (1616–1618)\n\n(II) On March 26, 1618, Johann-Albert II married Elizabeth of Hesse-Cassel (1596 – 1625), daughter of Landgrave Mauritz of Hesse-Cassel. This marriage remained childless.\n\n(III) Johann-Albert II married his third wife, Eleonore-Marie of Anhalt-Bernburg (1600 – 1657), daughter of Prince Christian I of Anhalt-Bernburg, on May 7, 1626. The couple had the following children:\n\n* Anna Sophie (1628 – 1666)\n\nmarried Duke Ludwig IV of Legnica\n\n* John Christian (1629–1631)\n\n* Eleanor (1630–1631)\n\n* Gustaf-Adolph (1633–1695)\n\n* Louise (20 May 1635 – 6 January 1648)\n\nJohann-Albert II died in 1636 and was buried in the Minster in Güstrow. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Gustaf-Adolph, by his third wife, Eleonore-Marie of Anhalt-Bernburg.\n\nGustaf-Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow\n\nGustaf-Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (February 26, 1633 – October 6, 1695) was the last ruler of Mecklenburg-Güstrow from 1636 until his death and last Lutheran Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Ratzeburg from 1636 to 1648.\n\nA minor upon his father’s death in 1636, his uncle Duke Adolf-Friedrich I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin at first became regent at Güstrow, fiercely opposed by Gustaf-Adolph’s mother. In 1654 he came of age and married Magdalene-Sibylle, a daughter of Duke Friedrich III of Holstein-Gottorp (1597-1659) and his wife Marie-Elisabeth of Saxony (1610-1684).\n\nMagdalene-Sibylle of Holstein-Gottorp\n\nTheir marriage produced eleven children:\n\n* Johann, Hereditary Prince of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (1655 –1660).\n\n* Eleonore (1657 – 1672).\n\n* Marie (1659 – 1701), married on September 23, 1684 to Duke Adolf-Friedrich II of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\n* Magdalene (1660 – 1702).\n\n* Sophie (1662 – 1738), married on December 6, 1700 to Duke Christian-Ulrich I of Württemberg-Oels.\n\n* Christine (1663 – 1749), married on May 4, 1683 to Ludwig-Christian, Count of Stolberg-Gedern.\n\n* Charles, Hereditary Prince of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (1664 – 1688), married on August 10, 1687 to Marie-Amalie of Brandenburg-Prussia, a daughter of daughter of the “Great Elector” Friedrich-Wilhelm of Brandenburg-Prussia from his second marriage with Sophia-Dorothea of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, daughter of Duke Philipp of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg.\n\n* Hedwig (1666 – 1735), married on December 1, 1686 to Duke August of Saxe-Merseburg-Zörbig.\n\n* Louise (1667 – 1721), married on December 5, 1696 to King Frederik IV of Denmark and Norway.\n\n* Elisabeth (1668 – 1738), married on March 29, 1692 to Duke Heinrich of Saxe-Merseburg-Spremberg.\n\n* Augusta (27 December 1674 – 19 May 1756).\n\nHereditary Prince Charles, of Mecklenburg-Güstrow\n\nThe death of the only surviving son, the Hereditary Prince Charles, in 1688 at the age of 23, caused a succession crisis in Mecklenburg-Güstrow. Gustaf-Adolph’s daughter Marie married her cousin Adolf-Friedrich II of Mecklenburg, who after the death of his father-in-law claimed the Güstrow heritage, but could not prevail against the ruling duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Christian-Ludwig I. A younger daughter, Louise in 1695 married the Danish and Norwegian Crown Prince and in 1699 became queen consort of Denmark when her husband succeeded to the throne as King Frederik IV.\n\nGustaf-Adolph died in Güstrow at the age of 62. The subsequent inheritance conflict within the House of Mecklenburg was settled by the establishment of the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in 1701.\n\nFrom the Emperor’s Desk: In response to the post on the Birth of Adolph-Friedrich V, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, I was asked if the Schwerin and Strelitz line of the House of Mecklenburg intermarried. So starting with today’s post I will examine this question in a short series. Today we begin with some back ground information.\n\nLike many German territories, Mecklenburg was sometimes partitioned and re-partitioned among different members of the ruling dynasty. In 1621 Mecklenburg was divided into the two duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Güstrow.\n\nPrior to the Duchy being divided in 1621 Mecklenburg was ruled by Johann VII of Mecklenburg (March 7, 1558 – March 22, 1592) (sometimes called Johann V, that will take another post to explain). Johann VII was the son of Johann-Albert I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow and Schwerin (1525–1576), and his wife Duchess Anna Sophia of Prussia (1527–1591). Johann was eighteen years old when his father died and he succeeded as the Duke of Mecklenburg. A regency council was appointed that ruled in his name for the next nine years.\n\nThe regency handed over the actual rule of his territories to him in 1585. He immediately faced problems that he was ill-equipped to deal with, including massive debt and his uncle Christopher’s demands for territorial concessions. After an especially harsh argument with his uncle, he committed suicide.\n\nJohann VII, Duke of Mecklenburg.\n\nOn February 17, 1588 Johann married Sophia (1569 – 1634), a daughter of Adolf, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, and his wife Christine of Hesse. They had three children:\n\n* Adolf Frederick I (1588 – 1658). Through Adolf-Friedrich I would spring both the Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz lines of the family.\n\n* Johann-Albert II (1590 – 1636). From Johann-Albert II came the short lived Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow line.\n\n* Anna Sophia (1591 – 1648)\n\nJohann-Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow\n\nAfter the suicide of Duke Johann VII, Adolf-Friedrich I and his brother Johann-Albert II reigned jointly under the guardianship of Duke Ulrich III of Mecklenburg-Güstrow and Charles I of Mecklenburg (their father’s uncles). The two brothers took over governance of Mecklenburg-Schwerin beginning on April 16, 1608, after the death of Duke Ulrich III and after the death of Duke Charles I on July 22, 1610 they also governed in the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.\n\nDivision of Mecklenburg and Thirty Years’ War\n\nIn 1621 the Duchy of Mecklenburg was formally divided between the two brothers, with Adolf-Friedrich I ruling in Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Johann-Albert II ruling in Mecklenburg-Güstrow.\n\nAdolf-Friedrich I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nDuring the Thirty Years’ War, Albrecht von Wallenstein ousted both of the dukes after they secretly sided with King Christian IV of Denmark against Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II. Wallenstein ruled the duchies from 1627 until 1631, when the dukes were restored by the Swedes under King Gustaf II Adolph. In 1634 Adolf-Friedrich I succeeded Ulrik of Denmark as last Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Schwerin before its secularisation.\n\nDuke Adolf-Friedrich I died on February 27, 1658 (aged 69) and his eldest son, Christian-Ludwig I, (December 1, 1623 in Schwerin – June 21, 1692 in The Hague) became the reigning Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Christian-Ludwig I’s mother was Anna-Maria (1601–1634), the daughter of Count Enno III of East Frisia.\n\nThe next post will examine the descendants of Duke Adolf-Friedrich I and the Mecklenburg-Schwerin family line.\n\nThe post after that will focus on Johann-Albert II of Mecklenburg-Güstrow which lead to further division of the Duchy."
