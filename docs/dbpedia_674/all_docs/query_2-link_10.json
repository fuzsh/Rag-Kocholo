Luise was a sister to Grand Duke Ludwig II of Hesse and by Rhine and Landgravine Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt 27.1 Princess Luise Auguste of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1779 1784 27.2 Grand Duke Carl Friedrich of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1783 1853 Grand Duchess Maria of Russia 1786 1859 See 4.5 27.21 Prince Paul Alexander \"Carl\" of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1805 1806 27.22 Princess Marie Luise of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1808 1877 Prince Karl of Prussia 1801 1883 See 11.5 27.23 Princess Auguste of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1811 1890 King Wilhelm I of Prussia 1797 1888 See 11.2 - Wilhelm was proclaimed first German Emperor on French soil in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace at Versailles on 18 January 1871 (some sources show 8 January 1871). He succeeded as King of Prussia on the death of his mentally incapacitated brother Friedrich Wilhelm IV in 1861.\n\nA report on the death of King Wilhelm I of Prussia and his subsequent funeral 27.24 Grand Duke Carl Alexander of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1818 1901 Princess Sophia of the Netherlands 1824 1897 See 9.15 - Carl Alexander and Sophia were first cousins, their mothers were daughters of Emperor Paul I of all the Russias\n\nReport on the death of Grand Duke Carl Alexander 27.241 Hereditary Grand Duke Carl August of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1844 1894 Princess Pauline of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1852 1904 See 27.451\n\nCarl August was at one time third in line to the throne of Holland. His mother Sophia of the Netherlands was second in line after her niece Wilhelmina (who eventual succeeded as Queen of the Netherlands).\n\nReport on the death of Hereditary Grand Duke Carl August 27.2411 Grand Duke Wilhelm Ernst of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1876 1923 Princess Karoline Reuss-Greiz 1884 1905 See 43.154 - Wilhelm Ernst who succeeded his grandfather Carl Alexander lost his throne on 9 November 1918. He was known to be a sadist and on the day of his abdication was advised he was the \"most unpopular prince in Germany\". The early death of Karoline is shrouded in some mystery, some sources say she died in childbirth and other say she took her own life.\n\nIt was also mentioned in a newspaper article dated 25 April 1903 that Princess Beatrice of Edinburgh (Saxe-Coburg and Gotha) was likely to be the wife of Wilhelm Ernst, obviously this was way off target since Wilhelm Ernst married Karoline Reuss-Greiz shortly afterwards on 30 April 1903.\n\nWilhelm Ernst and Karoline were married on 30 April 1903 but a couple of months later it was being reported in Newspapers that Karoline had run away from her husband to escape the tyranny of her surroundings in the Royal Palace. She died on 17 January 1905 at the young age of twenty years.\n\n27.2411 Grand Duke Wilhelm Ernst of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1876 1923 Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen 1890 1972 See 29.3161 - Wilhelm Ernst who succeeded his grandfather Carl Alexander lost his throne on 9 November 1918. He was known to be a sadist and on the day of his abdication was advised he was the \"most unpopular prince in Germany\".\n\nThe New York Times reported that Kaiser Wilhelm II has absolutely declined to recognize the marriage of the Grand Duke Wilhelm Ernst (of Saxe-Weimar) with Princess Feodora (of Saxe-Meiningen).\n\nAn unusual article on the imprisonment by Wilhelm Ernst of his 3rd cousin Grand Duke Hermann of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. Some of the finer details seem suspect. 27.24111 Princess Sophie-Louise of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1911 1988 Prince Friedrich Gunther of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt 1901 1971 See 24.73363 - The death of Prince Friedrich brought an end to the Princely House of Schwarzburg 27.24112 Hereditary Grand Duke Karl-August of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1912 1988 Baroness Elisabeth von Wangenheim-Winterstein 1912 2010 27.241121 Princess Elisabeth of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1945 Mindert Diderick de Kant 1934 27.241122 Prince Michael-Benedict of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1946 Renate Henkel 1947 Prince Michael-Benedict is the present Head of the Princely House of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 27.241122 Prince Michael-Benedict of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1946 Dagmar Hennings 1948 Prince Michael-Benedict is the present Head of the Princely House of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.\n\nMarriage Registration of Prince Michael-Benedict of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Dagmar Hennings. For some unknown reason Dagmar's surname is shown as Kohler in the Index, I'm trying to ascertain the reason for change in surname.Was she married previously (Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels (GHdA) for 2004 suggests Dagmar was previously married and divorced but no actual details)?? 27.2411221 Princess Leonie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1986 27.241123 Princess Beatrice-Maria of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1948 Martin Charles Davidson 1940 Birth Registration of Martin Charles Davidson .\n\nMarriage Registration of Princess Beatrice-Maria of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Martin Charles Davidson 27.24113 Prince Bernard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1917 1986 Princess Felicitas of Salm-Horstmar 1920 27.241131 Princess Katharina of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1943 Prince Emanuel Joseph of Hohenzollern 1929 1999 See 6.1134 27.241132 Prince Alexander of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1945 1945 Alexander unfortunately only lived for six weeks 27.241133 Prince Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1946 Eva Katalin (Katharina) Kovarcz 1945 Eva Katalin married secondly Prince Carl Friedrich of Wrede 27.2411331 Princess Desiree of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1974 Count Florian von Hoensbroech 1969 See 20.383536 27.2411332 Prince Georg-Constantin of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1977 2018 Olivia Rachelle Page 1979 Prince Georg-Constantin was killed in a riding accident at Apethorpe Palace, Northamptonshire. 27.24114 Prince Georg of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1921 2011 Gisela Janisch 1930 1989 Prince Georg renounced his rights to Saxe-Weimar on 22 January 1953 and assumed the name Jorg Brena 27.241141 Luise-Ariane Brena 1954 27.241142 Adelheid-Cornelie Brena 1955 Thomas August Landsberg 1945 2010 27.241142 Adelheid-Cornelie Brena 1955 Dietmar Berron 1956 27.241142 Adelheid-Cornelie Brena 1955 William Diaz Cespedes 1965 27.241143 Isobel Madeleine Brena 1959 27.2412 Prince Bernard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1878 1900 27.242 Princess Marie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1849 1922 Prince Heinrich VII Reuss-Köstritz 1825 1906 Heinrich VII in 1877 was appointed the first imperial ambassador to Constantinople. The article referring to the appointment also describes the intricacies of the numbering system of the various branches of the Reuss family. 27.2421 Prince Heinrich XXXII Reuss-Köstritz 1878 1935 Princess Marie Adelheid of Lippe 1895 1993 Princess Marie Adelheid and Prince Heinrich XXXII were married on 19 May 1920 and divorced about 9 months later on 18 February 1921. Princess Marie Adelheid then married secondly Prince Heinrich XXXII's younger brother Prince Heinrich XXXV on 12 April 1921 and they were divorced on 23 June 1923. Wow, strange circumstances!\n\nPrincess Marie's father was Prince Rudolf of Lippe-Biesterfeld (1856-1931) whose brother Count Ernst II of Lippe-Biesterfeld (1842-1904) was a grandfather of Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld (1911-2004).\n\nHeinrich XXXII acquired an academical qualificationa for a commercial career. 27.2422 Prince Heinrich XXXIII Reuss-Köstritz 1879 1942 Princess Viktoria Margarete of Prussia 1890 1923 See 11.5151 - A short report on the intended marriage of Heinrich XXXIII and Viktoria Margarete (column 4) with an explanation of the numbering system of the Heinrichs' in the House of Reuss.\n\nHeinrich XXXIII who had trained as a doctor was involved in the questioning of some English doctors who had been captured by the Germans during the first World War. 27.2422 Prince Heinrich XXXIII Reuss-Köstritz 1879 1942 Allene Tew 1876 1955 Allene Tew (Tew was her maiden name) was firstly married to Theodore Hostetter (who was a noted gambler of his day).\n\nShe married secondly Morton Colton Nichols, In 1905 whilst married to Morton she commissioned C.P.H.

Allene was one of the five godparents of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands 27.24221 Princess Marie Luise Reuss-Köstritz 1915 1985 Eric Theisen 1905 1954 27.24221 Princess Marie Luise Reuss-Köstritz 1915 1985 Alexander Bodey 1920 27.24222 Prince Heinrich II Reuss-Köstritz 1916 1993 27.2423 Princess Johanna Reuss-Köstritz 1882 1883 27.2424 Princess Sophie Renate Reuss-Köstritz 1884 1968 Prince Heinrich XXXIV Reuss-Köstritz 1887 1956 Princess Sophie's father (Heinrich VII 1825-1906) and Prince Heinrich's XXXIV grandfather (Heinrich XII 1829-1866) were brothers 27.24241 Prince Heinrich I Reuss-Köstritz 1910 1982 Duchess Woizlawa Feodora of Mecklenburg-Schwerin 1918 2019; See 23.111J1 - Heinrich I was adopted on 19 January 1935 by Hereditary Prince Heinrich XLV Reuss-Schleiz (1895-1945) 27.242411 Princess Feodora Reuss-Köstritz 1942 Count Gisbert of Stolberg-Wernigerode 1942 See 5.141513 27.242412 Prince Heinrich VIII Reuss-Köstritz 1944 Baroness Dorit von Ruffin 1948 27.2424121 Prince Heinrich XX Reuss-Köstritz 1975 27.2424122 Prince Heinrich XXIII Reuss-Köstritz 1979 27.242413 Prince Heinrich IX Reuss-Köstritz 1947 Baroness Amelie Besserer von Thalfingen 1959 27.2424131 Princess Johanna Woizlawa Reuss-Köstritz 1985 Baron Constantin von Wiedersperg-Leonrod 1983 27.2424132 Prince Heinrich XXVI Reuss-Köstritz 1988 Isabelle Anna Frampton 1989 27.242414 Prince Heinrich X Reuss-Köstritz 1948 Baroness Elisabeth Akerhielm af Margarethelund 1946 27.242414 Prince Heinrich X Reuss-Köstritz 1948 Countess Antoinette von Arnim 1949 27.2424141 Princess Benigna Cecilia Reuss-Köstritz 1980 Óscar de Ascoz y Planes ?

The chauffeur was acquitted.\n\nCould this have been a contributory cause to the suicide of Princess Sophie? 27.453 Prince Bernhard Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1855 1907 Marie Luise Brockmüller 1866 1903 Bernhard Wilhelm renounced his rights on 24 May 1901 and was created Count von Crayenberg.\n\nMarriage Registration of Prince Bernhard Wilhelm and Marie Luise Brockmüller (Marie Luise was the widow of Francesco, Marquis Lucchesini and hence is shown in the registration under surname Lucchesini). 27.453 Prince Bernhard Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1855 1907 Countess Elisabeth von der Schulenburg 1869 1940 27.454 Prince Alexander Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1857 1891 27.455 Prince Ernst Carl of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1859 1909 27.456 Princess Olga Maria of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1869 1924 Prince Leopold Wolfgang zu Isenburg und Büdingen 1866 1933 See 20.3K1 - Leopold was Hereditary Prince and renounced his rights on 2 February 1898 in favour of his younger brother Franz Joseph (1869-1939) 27.46 Prince Friedrich Gustav of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1827 1892 Pierina Marocchia Edle di Marcaini 1845 1879 Pierina was created Baron von Neuperg in 1872 27.47 Princess Anna Amalia of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1828 1864"
