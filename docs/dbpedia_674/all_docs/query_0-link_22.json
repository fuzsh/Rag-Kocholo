He assumed the regency on 5 June 1907. He acted as regent for Prince Ernest Augustus, 3rd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale who was prevented from taking over the duchy in 1884 by Otto von Bismarck due to the rift between the royal houses of Hanover and Hohenzollern. The regency came to an end on November 1 1913 when Prince Ernest Augustus' son Ernest Augustus was permitted to ascend to Duchy following his marriage to Princess Viktoria Luise of Prussia the only daughter of the German Emperor William II which helped heal the rift between the two houses.

He was married secondly in Brunswick on the 15 December 1909 to Princess Elisabeth of Stolberg-Rossla (1885-1969), who would following his death marry his half brother Duke Adolf Friedrich in 1924.
