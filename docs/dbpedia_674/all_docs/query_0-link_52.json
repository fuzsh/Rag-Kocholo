Duke Adolf of Nassau from a collateral branch became Grand Duke Adolphe of Luxemburg.\n\nIt was reported shortly before his death that Willem III had been declared insane by the Dutch Parliament, and was for that reason deposed. The Duke of Nassau has been appointed Regent. However it was his wife Emma who had been appointed Regent.\n\nDeath report of Emma 42.5 Princess Helene of Waldeck and Pyrmont 1861 1922 Prince Leopold of Great Britain (Duke of Albany) 1853 1884 See 1.8 - Leopold suffered from haemophilia and went to Cannes on doctor's orders in February 1884.

In 1947 he was sentenced to life imprisonment, which was later commuted to 20 years although he was released in 1950 on health grounds.\n\nJosias some years earlier in January 1934 was deported from Austria having been found liaising with the Austrian Nazi's in an attempt to overthrow the Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss. Dollfuss was assassinated on 25 July 1934 by Austrian Nazis. 42.611 Princess Margarethe Sophie of Waldeck and Pyrmont 1923 2003 Count Franz August zu Erbach-Erbach 1925 2015 Franz August succeeded his father Franz ALEXANDER (1891-1952) as Graf zu Erbach-Erbach, who in turn had succeeded his older brother Franz Alexander KONRAD ( 1881-1940). Franz Alexander KONRAD in turn had succeeded his first cousin Franz ERASMUS (1883-1920) as Graf zu Erbach-Erbach.\n\nI only mention this succession route to report the sensation and scandal in Germany caused by the marriage of ERASMUS to a \"washerwoman's\" daughter named Dorothea (Dora) Fischer in London in 1905. ERASMUS's father the Graf zu Erbach-Erbach was instrumental in getting his son declared insane and committed to a lunatic asylum not long after he returned home from his marriage.
