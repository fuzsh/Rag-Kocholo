        "text": "The team took a trip to the theatre to see Mamma Mia! this week as it returned to Shanghai for the first time in 17 years. International acts have been returning to China in 2023/24, with a full roster lined-up to play leading venues like Shanghai‚Äôs Mercedes-Benz Arena. The hottest acts are still relatively unknown in the West, with Taiwan‚Äôs Jay Chou latest concerts selling-out quicker than some of Taylor Swift‚Äôs recent tour dates. More than 10 million people registered to apply for the sale of 110,000 tickets. We even heard of some tickets with a face value of RMB 2000 selling for upwards of RMB 100,000 in the run-up to the shows. It‚Äôs not just the superstar acts drawing the crowds, smaller venues and music festivals like Beijing‚Äôs ‚ÄòInfinite Music Festival‚Äô are selling-out faster than ever. Alibaba‚Äôs fliggy travel platform showed that hotel bookings around concert and music venues doubled YoY during this year‚Äôs Labor Day holidays and, according to the China Association of Performing Arts, ticket revenue reached RMB 10.8 billion ($1.5 billion) for 1Q24, up 117% YoY. Driving demand is China‚Äôs Gen Z, who are more willing to splash-out on relatively affordable experiences, rather than save for big-ticket items. Whilst the economy is still experiencing some difficulties, and consumption downgrades are indeed occurring in certain sectors, it‚Äôs encouraging to see sold-out gigs and music festivals again. We hope that this is a sign consumer confidence is finally on the mend. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Investment involves risks, including possible loss of principal.

According to The Music Venue Trust (MVT), an organisation focused on supporting grassroots music, they \"play a vital role in the cultural and economic vibrancy of any town or city lucky enough to have one. Without these music venues, we wouldn't have had the The Beatles, The Clash, Kate Bush, Dire Straits or Radiohead. And if we don't recognise the role they play there won‚Äôt be any more Adeles or Ed Sheerans\". Jamie Johnston, BA Live Event and Festival Management Programme Leader, agrees. He said: \"You simply don‚Äôt get the best new acts without the grassroots music venues. The live music industry can be viewed as a pyramid with Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage at the top, then the arenas, the theatres, large town venues, and grassroots spaces all underneath. This shows how the smaller spaces have cultural significance and importance ‚Äî if you remove the bottom layer of a pyramid, then you are damaging the integrity on which everything is built. These spaces not only help performers hone their skills, but provide jobs and places for local music communities to come together. If we don't have these spaces where artists and professionals can cut their teeth, then we're at risk of losing our music culture.\" Ahead of Independent Venue Week 2024, we have compiled a list of some our favourite independent live music venues. Check them out below üëá https://lnkd.in/eK8vUMw6\n\nElectric Group ‚Äì the live music sector remains buoyant, in talk on two new sites: Dominic Madden, co-founder of the Electric Group, which operates some of the UK‚Äôs leading music venues, has told Propel that the country‚Äôs live music sector remains buoyant and that younger consumers have moved on from the ‚Äúold-fashioned nightclub model‚Äù. The company currently operates Electric Brixton, Bristol‚Äôs SWX venue and NX in Newcastle, while also owning the freehold of The Leadmill in Sheffield. Madden told Propel: ‚ÄúThe live sector is very buoyant. We‚Äôve taken some of the best bits of what would have been historically the late-night model and fused it together with an event focused/live music model. There‚Äôs a huge demand for a curated approach to music programming because the old-fashioned approach, in a world where students and young people have gotten very sophisticated in terms of their approach ‚Äì they know what they want ‚Äì is not working. They go to festivals, they go to Ibiza, but their discretionary and disposable spend is decreasing as a result of the cost-of-living crisis, which means that going to an old-fashioned nightclub session on a Monday night because it‚Äôs cheap is no longer a priority for them. The old-fashioned nightclub model has moved on, students are going out less. That means those buildings are dependent on an economic model based on a 600-capacity Friday, a 1,000-capacity Saturday, and hope for the best for the rest of the week. Obviously, the fixed costs of running these buildings, the rising tide of costs have increased.‚Äù Madden is looking at two other prospective sites at the moment ‚Äì one in London and one in a major regional city. He said: ‚ÄúOur sweet spot from a capacity perspective is 1,200-plus. So, in lots of cities, there are small spaces in pubs and rooms above pubs but there‚Äôs no medium capacity because the Academy-type venues do 2,000 capacity plus, but that sort of 1,200 capacity space is great in the market as there is significant demand for acts touring at that mid-level. We get quite a lot of that, and that‚Äôs really, really good for us.‚Äù\n\nüò± What‚Äôs going on in Live Music?üò± As reported by Chris Cooke (very well, as ever), the Live crisis was discussed in Parliament on Tuesday (see link below). According to the MVT, despite growing ticket demand, 38% of venues operating reported a loss last year. Why? - The costs of performing by artists are now so high, some artists don‚Äôt tour, so venues are dormant for longer (see article) - Venue costs are soaring; in 2023, the Craufurd Arms in Milton Keynes saw electricity costs rise from ¬£16,000 to ¬£72,000 per annum - Music venues are often in formerly run-down areas that are now being gentrified and experiencing huge rent increases (source: Guardian, March ‚Äò24) Why should we care? Demand for Live is not dead: Live Nation's global revenues hit a record last year, with concert and venue attendance up in the UK and elsewhere - the same year 125 grassroots venues closed down. Here‚Äôs the interesting thing: many of the British acts now headlining these major global events (E.g. Coldplay, Dua Lipa) trained, developed and grew through grass roots venues. If we don‚Äôt take action to save our venues, we lose our ability to train, develop and nurture British talent and put them on the global stage and make a huge economic contribution. Grants, funds and bursaries for artists mean little when there‚Äôs no stage to perform on! Support grass roots venues! https://lnkd.in/eZ32CxwU\n\nMCKINNEY‚ÄôS MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR MUSIC VENUE: A nearly quarter-billion-dollar music venue is coming to one of Dallas‚Äô premier suburbs. McKinney is building the 20,000-seat Sunset Amphitheater just northeast of the 75/121 exchange! It‚Äôs going to have 250 luxury fire pit suites, custom-built suites, and a landscaped grass berm. It‚Äôs even going to incorporate technology to warm up outdoor concerts in the cooler months. The Colorado-based developer says they expect the venue to host 50 to 55 shows a year. Let‚Äôs do some math real fast. 50 to 55 shows a year times 20,000+ tickets‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs not counting the money to be made off of concessions and merchandise inside the amphitheater. It‚Äôs not outrageous to predict that this construction could have a MULTIBILLION-dollar impact on McKinney‚Äôs (and the surrounding areas‚Äô) economy. Construction is expected to begin this year and the theater will open in 2026. And on top of that, let‚Äôs imagine for a second the people who are going to be coming into town to build this behemoth of a project. Where do you imagine they‚Äôll be living? Our money is affordable (for now!) homes to the north in Grayson County. This is just another piece of evidence that you need to INVEST NOW in Grayson County.

A common misconception, often perpetuated by general consumers, is that Ticketmaster's additional fees are the sole reason for this spike in costs. However, my exploration revealed that the situation is far more intricate (check out the full op-ed here: https://lnkd.in/eXpdGd2J) My findings highlighted that ticket prices are influenced by a myriad of factors. These include the escalating fees demanded by artists, the scarcity of concert staff and equipment, and a significant imbalance between the high demand for tickets and their limited supply. A particularly striking variable emerged from a Bandsintown Group study, which showed that 87% of fans are willing to reduce spending in other areas to afford tickets to see their favorite artists. This finding was recently corroborated by a HSBC UK study, highlighting that, despite general cutbacks in expenditures like dining out or takeaway meals over the past six months, live music remains an exception. UK consumers are evidently prepared to tighten their belts in other domains to fund their passion for attending concerts and festivals. This underscores the cultural significance and influence of live music. Looking forward to 2024, I foresee that consumers will continue to give live music such priority. This trend is likely to be capitalized upon by superstar artists from various eras, seizing the opportunity to maximize revenue from tours. This explains the flurry of tour announcements from legacy acts like Creed for the upcoming year. However, there's a flip side to this scenario. The high cost of concert tickets raises concerns about the future of independent venues and artists. If fans are budgeting for once-in-a-lifetime shows by megastars like Taylor Swift or Beyonc√©, it begs the question: will they have enough to support smaller acts, whose tickets typically range from $20 to $50? My projection is that this superstar effect in live music will not only tighten consumer budgets but also drive spending towards top artists, putting indie venues in a tight spot. They may need to find more compelling reasons to attract fans, who are otherwise drawn to large-scale arena concerts. This situation calls for widespread industry support to rally around independent venues and artists. As the live music industry reaps the benefits of high demand for superstar-level concerts, it's crucial not to overlook the importance of nurturing future superstars, who have historically emerged from indie venues. https://lnkd.in/eyDAuHZY #livemusic #musicindustry #musicbusiness #bigideas2024\n\nMCKINNEY‚ÄôS MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR MUSIC VENUE: A nearly quarter-billion-dollar music venue is coming to one of Dallas‚Äô premier suburbs.

The survey of 2,000 Brits revealed that two-thirds (67%) of us will be tuning in to the contest this year, nearly three-quarters (72%) of whom will be supporting the United Kingdom‚Äôs entry Olly Alexander, of Years & Years fame. More than one in 10 (11%) won‚Äôt be supporting any country but watching the show for enjoyment. Nearly one in 12 (7%) plan to go out for the evening to celebrate Eurovision ‚Äì the most popular destination for a Eurovision party is a pub or bar (4%), followed by a viewing at a cinema or theatre (2%). Those visiting hospitality venues for events intend to splash the cash, however. Just 4% expect to spend less than ¬£20 on Eurovision night, while the most popular budget for the evening is around ¬£50 (25%). One in five (21%) plan to spend ¬£20, while nearly half (47%) of respondents have budgeted upwards of ¬£50. Almost one in 12 (7%), however, have set aside more than ¬£100 to spend at a Eurovision party. Analysis of respondents‚Äô spending intentions by PPL PRS reveals that the night is set to see more than ¬£72 million pumped into the UK‚Äôs nightlife economy as a result of the Eurovision; the biggest spenders of the night alone could account for a spend injection of more than ¬£21 million. Recent years have seen Eurovision parties gain traction in hospitality venues ‚Äì but many now opt to watch at home or a friend‚Äôs house; PPL PRS‚Äô survey reveals that four in five (79%) Eurovision fans will stay home to watch the contest, while one in seven (13%) plan to visit a friend‚Äôs house for the evening. Cost and comfort drive the trend for avoiding a night on the town; more than half (51%) prefer to stay in for the comfort of being in their own or a friend‚Äôs home, while for almost one in two (48%), it comes down to staying in being cheaper than going out to an event. One in 10 (90%) Gen Z and Millennials are heading out for Eurovision parties this year ‚Äì with an average intended spend of ¬£42 and ¬£44 respectively. Similarly, those in the Gen X bracket are likely to spend an average of ¬£43, but 96% plan to watch Eurovision at home or at a friend‚Äôs house. Despite just 2% of Boomers intending to watch the contest at a public viewing party, purchase intent is much higher; the average spend intent for the generation sits higher than any other at an average of ¬£53 per head. More than one in 10 (89%) Londoners are set to spend the evening in hospitality venues for Eurovision with the second-largest average spend intent at ¬£51 per person ‚Äì with the same to be said for the North East (88%), but with a much lower spend intent of just ¬£35. Only Welsh Eurovision fans plan to spend any more than Londoners, with an average of ¬£51, but just 3% of people in Wales intend on spending the evenin‚Ä¶"
