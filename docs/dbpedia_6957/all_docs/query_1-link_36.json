        "text": "Four arms, four legs, two heads, wood, metal and plastic. JOHN.\n\nIt’s a cryptic and unsearchable band name but it serves an important manifesto. Not only is it logical – with the duo being comprised of John Newton (drums/lead vocals) and Johnny Healey (guitar/backing vocals) – but it’s deliberately mundane, a response to the sensationalism that was often promoted through rock music when JOHN began playing together in 2013.\n\n“It’s a bit like shooting yourself in the foot,” explains Newton, “but it helps remind you that the creative drive is what’s central to the project. The sensational collateral is just cladding that can easily become a hindrance to your intentions'.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the DIY approach of independent enterprises such as Dischord Records, the pair formed in London’s East End opting to self-manage, self-release and self-distribute. The band released their debut LP 'God Speed in the National Limit' on their own imprint Pets Care Records in 2017. Critical praise swiftly followed and led to invites to support likeminded peers including IDLES, Mclusky and METZ.\n\n2019 saw the arrival of a second album, 'Out Here on the Fringes', which catapulted the band into the Top 40 of the UK Independent Vinyl Chart as well as being featured as an Album of the Day on BBC 6Music with three successive playlisted singles.\n\n2021 saw the arrival of their third full length 'Nocturnal Manoeuvres', further expanding the idiosyncrasies of their previous work.\n\n---\n\nSupport line-up announced:\n\nMUMS\n\nSuper fuzzy Noise Rock 3-piece from the North West.\n\nlinktr.ee/Mumstheband\n\nGINNEL\n\nPreston's post-punk primitive noise psych outfit.\n\nginnel.bandcamp.com\n\nuhr\n\nTaut rhythms, cheese-wire guitar riffs and oblique lyrics from this Art-Punk 3-piece.\n\nlinktr.ee/uhr.fyi\n\nBLOW-UP\n\nLo-fi fuzz guitar and experimental psychedelic noise from Blackpool.\n\nsptfy.com/blow-up\n\n________\n\nJOHN\n\n+ guests:\n\nMums + Ginnel + uhr + Blow-Up\n\nThe Ferret | Preston\n\nSat 9th April 2022\n\nDoors open 4pm"
