        "text": "The Devil Wears Prada Announce New Album\n\nThe new, as yet untitled album from The Devil Wears Prada, one of the brightest rising stars in the metalcore world, has been completed and is set for a September 13 release (Ferret). This will be the band’s first full-length album since 2009’s critically-acclaimed With Roots Above and Branches Below; TDWP’s most recent release, last summer’s 5-track conceptual Zombie EP (called the band’s “best release to date” by one media outlet), made its Billboard Top 200 chart debut at #10, the highest chart debut of the band’s career. “Born to Lose,” the first song to be released from the album, will be exclusively premiered on Alternative Press’s website now. Adam Dutkiewicz (Killswitch Engage) engineered and produced the album; singer Mike Hranica described it by commenting, “The new record contains the heavy aspects of the ‘Zombie EP,’ meshed with the melody of the full lengths. ‘Born to Lose’ captures some of those elements and serves as a comprehensive preview to the album. By all means, I’d call it our most emotional, well-written album to date.” TDWP will head out on the road this summer on the Van’s Warped Tour, performing on the festival’s Teggart Main Stage.\n\nTour Dates:\n\n6/21 – Memphis, TN\n\n6/24 – Dallas, TX\n\n6/25 – Houston, TX\n\n6/26 – San Antonio, TX\n\n6/29 – Las Cruces, NM\n\n6/30 – Las Vegas, NV\n\n7/1 – Pomona, CA\n\n7/2 – Mountain View, CA\n\n7/3 – Ventura, CA\n\n7/6 – Bonner Springs, KS\n\n7/7 – Noblesville, IN\n\n7/8 – Detroit, MI\n\n7/9 – Tinley Park, IL\n\n7/10 – Shakopee, MN\n\n7/12 – Darien Center, NY\n\n7/13 – Mansfield, MA\n\n7/14 – Scranton, PA\n\n7/15 – Mississauga, ON\n\n7/16 – Montreal, QC\n\n7/17 – Hartford, CT\n\n7/19 – Milwaukee, WI\n\n7/20 – Cuyahoga Falls, OH\n\n7/21 – Camden, NJ\n\n7/22 – Burgettstown, PA\n\n7/23 – Uniondale, NY\n\n7/24 – Oceanport, NJ\n\n7/26 – Columbia, MD\n\n7/27 – Virginia Beach, VA\n\n7/28 – Charlotte, NC\n\n7/29 – Orlando, FL\n\n7/30 – West Palm Beach, FL\n\n7/31 – St. Petersburg, FL\n\n8/1 – Atlanta, GA\n\n8/2 – Cincinnati, OH\n\n8/3 – Maryland Heights, MO\n\n8/4 – Council Bluffs, IA\n\n8/5 – Denver, CO\n\n8/6 – Salt Lake City, UT\n\n8/7 – Phoenix, AZ\n\n8/9 – Chula Vista, CA\n\n8/10 – Los Angeles, CA\n\n8/11 – Sacramento, CA\n\n8/12 – Boise, ID\n\n8/13 – George, WA\n\n8/14 – Hillsboro, OR\n\nSaving Grace To Release The King Is Coming\n\nSaving Grace have signed to Facedown Records for the release of their brand new full length studio album entitled The King Is Coming. The Facedown debut will be recorded with the band’s long time friend and producer Zorran Mendonsa who engineered both of Saving Grace’s previous albums Behind Enemy Lines and Unbreakable. The band states, “We are extremely pleased to announce our partnership with what we consider to be the most important label and ministry in heavy music. It has been an honor and privilege to have the support of Jason and the Facedown Family since we released Unbreakable in the US in January last year and we couldn’t be happier about putting the new record out with Facedown.”\n\nJason Dunn of Facedown Records adds, “It has been a privilege to get to know and work along side the guys in Saving Grace. Their hard work, determination and integrity shine through in how they live and in their music, and we are blessed to be able to partner with them.” The band heads into the studio in Gisborne City this August and looks forward to an early winter 2011 release date for The King Is Coming. Facedown Records is also making Saving Grace’s first full length release Behind Enemy Lines available digitally worldwide for the first time. Behind Enemy Lines was the band’s first international release back in 2008, and according to the band, “We are still very proud of the release and can’t wait to make it available again digitally.” The digital release of BEL will be available July 12.\n\nFor more information on Saving Grace, visit:\n\nfacebook.com/savingxgrace\n\nAugust Burns Red Post 4th track From Leveler\n\nWith little more than a week to go until the anxiously awaited release of AUGUST BURNS RED’s Leveler, the band continue to tease fans by streaming yet another new track, entitled ‘Poor Millionaire’. While the early buzz has been on the band’s introduction of new elements and expansion of their experimentation, ‘Poor Millionaire’ is a song that will appeal to both old and new fans alike. Guitarist JB Brubaker explains: “While pushing the boundaries of ABR was important when writing Leveler, it was equally important us to not abandon what we as a band and what the fans think of as the ‘core ABR sound’ and that’s why songs like ‘Poor Millionaire’ are just as important to the album as more experimental tracks like ‘Internal Cannon’”. Stream the song here.\n\nMat Kearney News\n\nAs Mat Kearney kicked off a US tour in Nashville recently at the Ryman Auditorium with Owl City, he’s thrilled to announce the details and reveal the cover art for his fourth full-length studio album – Young Love – due out August 2nd on Universal Republic.

The price per piece is $325 per canvas and $425 for custom/ hand-painted prints on canvas. “I want to make sure my work is available in some form to anyone who wants access.

The decision to acquire Integrity Music was motivated specifically by David C Cook’s desire to expand its global impact in the area of worship. Per the agreement, David C Cook has acquired only those assets specific to Integrity Music. Integrity Media, based in Mobile, AL will still exist consisting of Integrity Direct, Integrity Worship Institute, and the international companies in the UK, South Africa and Singapore. Industry veteran C. Ryan Dunham, formerly David C Cook’s senior vice president of sales and marketing, will serve as president of Integrity Music, effective immediately. “At David C Cook we are committed to the Great Commission. Our mission is to ‘Equip the Church with Christ-centered resources for making and teaching disciples who obediently transform today’s generations.’ We are delighted to have Integrity Music join the David C Cook family in serving the body of Christ,” states Cris Doornbos, CEO of David C Cook. “The acquisition of Integrity Music makes sense from both a ministry as well as a business standpoint. Both organizations are widely respected for their international reach and their worship music catalogs,” states Ryan Dunham, Integrity Music president. “David C Cook is no newcomer to the worship music ministry. In 1993 Cook acquired Kingsway, a worship music company in Eastbourne, England, and partnered with EMI Christian Music Group to produce the Thank You Music song catalog. Kingsway artists include Matt Redman, Tim Hughes, Brenton Brown, The City Harmonic, and many others whose original songs are shaping the way a world-wide generation of Christians experiences worship,” continues Dunham. Integrity Music has profoundly influenced the worship music culture over the past 24 years. “Cris Doornbos and I share a deep passion for serving the global church and for the role worship music plays in making disciples around the world,” says Integrity co-founder and CEO Michael Coleman. “As Integrity prepares to celebrate 25 years in ministry, I look forward to seeing the expanding impact of Integrity songs and products around the world.” The acquisition benefits David C Cook by adding an even greater variety of worship titles to the organization’s current offering. It will also benefit Integrity worship artists and writers by providing a fresh perspective and an ownership structure as part of a nonprofit with an expanding realm of influence. Most importantly, it will provide the global church more options than ever for meaningful worship. “I am honored that Michael Coleman, a man whom I highly respect and who has meant so much to the worship music movement, has chosen to entrust us with Integrity Music’s worship catalog,” Doornbos says. “Our vision for Integrity Music songs and recordings is to see them sung by people in their native languages in churches all over the world.” Integrity Music will operate independently within David C Cook as a Strategic Ministry Unit and be relocated to the company headquarters in Colorado Springs after a transition period of 3 months. Distribution of Integrity Music products in the U.S. will continue through Provident-Integrity Distribution and Columbia and Sony Music Distribution.\n\nParamore Update\n\nParamore’s new song ‘Monster’ is featured on the upcoming Transformers: Dark of the Moon – The Album, which is out June 14th.

The band continues to promote the album by launching a music video for “Make A Move,” while the record itself is making an impact on multiple sales charts. Adding to the album’s momentum are early sales numbers, with Black & White debuting at No. 1 on the iTunes Christian & Gospel Albums chart. The record also reached No. 21 on iTunes Top Albums chart, which includes projects of all genres. Black & White landed at No. 6 on SoundScan’s Current Contemporary Christian Overall Chart as well. The disc’s title track, “Black & White,” was selected as iTunes “Discovery Download” from May 31 to June 7, a coveted spot that highlights new music from up-and-coming artists by offering a free single to listeners. Produced by Aaron Lindsey, Chuck Butler, and Daniel Kinner, Black & White showcases Royal Tailor’s distinctive musical blend, highlighting influences that range from Bruno Mars to Maroon 5 to Michael Jackson. The result is 11 high-energy tracks that make audiences want to dance, pray, shout and sing along.
