Beyer's Federal gift tax (gift tax) for his taxable year 2002 of $174,300, $43,575, and $39,217, respectively. Respondent further determined a deficiency in, and an accuracy-related penalty under section 6662(a) on, Edward G. Beyer's gift tax for his taxable year 2005 of $3,933,948 and $786,790, respectively.\n\nThe issues remaining for decision are:\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\nMany of the facts have been stipulated and are so found.\n\nGeneral Background\n\nEdward G. Beyer (Mr. Beyer or decedent) was a resident of Chicago, Illinois, at the time of his death on May 19, 2007. After Mr. Beyer died, the probate division of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, appointed decedent's nephew, Craig E. Plassmeyer (Craig Plassmeyer), executor of [*5] decedent's estate. Craig E. Plassmeyer resided in Thousand Oaks, California (Thousand Oaks), at all relevant times, including at the time he filed the petition in this case.\n\nMr. Beyer, who was born in 1910, never married and had no children. Mr. Beyer had four sisters: Mildred Beyer, Ruth E. Plassmeyer (Ruth Plassmeyer), Lucille V. Wilkinson (Lucille Wilkinson), and Eleanor Beyer and one brother, Robert Beyer. Two of Mr. Beyer's sisters, Ruth Plassmeyer and Lucille Wilkinson, were alive at all relevant times. For a period not established by the record during his lifetime, Mr. Beyer permitted Ruth Plassmeyer and Lucille Wilkinson to live in certain condominium apartments (condos) that he owned and paid certain expenses relating to those condos.\n\nIn addition to Craig Plassmeyer, Mr. Beyer had another nephew, Bruce R. Plassmeyer (Bruce Plassmeyer), and he also had a niece, Doris Kaminski. From 1999 to the date of Mr. Beyer's death on May 19, 2007, Craig Plassmeyer2 traveled from California to Chicago approximately once a month to visit family, [*6] including Mr. Beyer. As Mr. Beyer advanced in age, Bruce Plassmeyer,3 who lived in Chicago, assisted Mr. Beyer in certain day-to-day activities. Mr. Beyer did not have a close relationship with Doris Kaminski.\n\nMr. Beyer spent most of his life working for Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) in Chicago, Illinois. Mr. Beyer ultimately became that company's chief financial officer. Over the course of his employment with Abbott, Mr. Beyer acquired stock options from that company, began exercising those options around 1962, and accumulated a substantial amount of Abbott stock. The only time that Mr. Beyer sold any of the Abbott stock that he had acquired was to purchase a house in the 1970s.\n\nIn June 1999, Mr. Beyer held 800,000 shares of Abbott stock, certain other stock, certain other noncash property, and a certain amount of cash.\n\nMr. Beyer's Estate Planning\n\nAt a time not established by the record, Mr. Beyer was introduced to an attorney named Michael H. Erde (Mr. Erde), who specialized in estate planning. After consulting with Mr. Erde, Mr. Beyer decided to form a trust. On June 8, 1999, Mr. Beyer executed a trust agreement (1999 Trust agreement) that Mr. Erde [*7] had prepared and thereby formed a trust that was designated in that agreement as the \"EDWARD G. BEYER TRUST dated June 8, 1999\" (1999 Trust). In the 1999 Trust agreement, Mr. Beyer identified himself as both the settlor and the initial trustee of the 1999 Trust and recited that the initial 1999 Trust property was $10 in cash. On June 8, 1999, the date on which Mr. Beyer formed the 1999 Trust, he transferred certain assets, including 800,000 shares of Abbott stock, to a brokerage account at Banc One Securities Corp. (Banc One)4 that he had opened in the name of the 1999 Trust (1999 Trust Banc One account).\n\nAs pertinent here, the 1999 Trust agreement provided:\n\nARTICLE II\n\n* * * * * * *ARTICLE III\n\nFollowing my death, the trustee shall pay out of the trust principal all (a) my legally enforceable debts, including debts owed by me to a trustee individually, except debts which are an encumbrance on real property, (b) the expenses of my last illness and funeral, (c) the administration expenses payable by reason of my death, and (d) the estate and inheritance taxes (including interest and penalties, if any) payable in any jurisdiction by reason of my death (including those administration expenses and taxes payable with respect to assets which do not pass under this trust).\n\n* * * * * * *ARTICLE IV\n\n* * * * * * *Article VII\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nIn a letter dated June 30, 1999 (June 30, 1999 letter) from Patrick J. Edwards (Mr. Edwards) of First Chicago Insurance Services, Inc., to Craig Plassmeyer,5 Mr. Edwards identified certain asset transfer strategies that he recommended Mr. Beyer consider, including what Mr. Edwards described in that letter as: (1) intentionally defective irrevocable trusts; (2) family limited partnerships; (3) grantor retained trusts; and (4) irrevocable life insurance trusts. Mr. Edwards indicated in his June 30, 1999 letter that \"[i]n the case of the first [*14] three strategies, the primary reason for their use is to discount the value of assets for transfer purposes. * * * [T]his tends to hinge on lack of control and marketability of the assets which have been transferred.\" He further advised Craig Plassmeyer in that letter that each potential strategy had \"pros and cons\" and that \"[c]oordination with tax counsel could help quickly ferret out the probability [that] one or more of the transfer techniques could assist in minimizing income, gift and estate tax liabilities for all involved.\"\n\nAs Mr. Beyer advanced in age, he desired to give Craig Plassmeyer a power of attorney over his property. On October 29, 2001, Mr. Beyer signed a power of attorney that was to be construed under the laws of the State of Illinois (Illinois law), in which he named Craig Plassmeyer as his attorney-in-fact. That power of attorney stated in pertinent part:\n\nTHE PURPOSE OF THIS POWER OF ATTORNEY IS TO GIVE THE PERSON YOU DESIGNATE (YOUR \"AGENT') BROAD POWERS TO HANDLE YOUR PROPERTY, WHICH MAY INCLUDE POWERS TO PLEDGE, SELL OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF ANY REAL OR PERSONAL PROPERTY WITHOUT ADVANCE NOTICE TO YOU OR APPROVAL BY YOU. * * * UNLESS YOU EXPRESSLY LIMIT THE DURATION OF THIS POWER IN THE MANNER PROVIDED BELOW, UNTIL YOU REVOKE THIS POWER OR A COURT ACTING ON YOUR BEHALF TERMINATES IT, YOUR AGENT MAY EXERCISE THE POWERS GIVEN HERE THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFETIME, EVEN AFTER YOU BECOME DISABLED. * * *\n\n[*15] On December 17, 2001, Mr. Beyer signed a document titled \"FIRST AMENDMENT TO EDWARD G. BEYER DECLARATION OF TRUST\" that Mr. Erde, Mr. Beyer's estate planning attorney at that time, had prepared. In that document, Mr. Beyer amended paragraph (C)(1) of Article II of the 1999 Trust agreement (quoted above) by deleting the words \"best interests, and welfare\" from that paragraph. After that amendment, that paragraph of the 1999 Trust agreement provided:\n\n1. The trustee shall distribute to me or apply for my benefit such amounts of net income and principal, even to the extent of exhausting principal, as the trustee believes desirable from time to time for my health, support in reasonable comfort, considering all circumstances and factors deemed pertinent by the trustee. Any undistributed net income shall be accumulated and added to principal, as from time to time determined by the trustee.\n\nOn May 2, 2002, Mr. Erde sent to Mr. Beyer and Craig Plassmeyer for review and comment a draft copy of a proposed second amendment to the 1999 Trust agreement. Thereafter, on May 21, 2002, Mr. Beyer signed a document titled \"SECOND AMENDMENT TO EDWARD G. BEYER DECLARATION OF TRUST\". In that document, Mr. Beyer amended, inter alia, paragraph (D) of Article IV of the 1999 Trust agreement. After that amendment, that paragraph of the 1999 Trust agreement provided: Mr. Holup wanted Mr. Beyer and Craig Plassmeyer to be aware of certain estate planning options that Mr. Beyer should consider. Consequently, in 2003, Mr. Holup introduced them to Michael J. Stuart (Mr. Stuart), an estate planning attorney who was serving as of counsel to Anthony J. Madonia & Associates, Ltd. (Madonia & Associates).6 In May 2003, Mr. Beyer retained Madonia & Associates to perform services in developing and implementing an estate plan for Mr. Beyer. That firm was still serving in that capacity when Mr. Beyer died on May 19, 2007.\n\n[*17] In an engagement letter dated May 23, 2003 (May 23, 2003 engagement letter) from Mr. Madonia to Craig Plassmeyer,7 Mr. Madonia confirmed that his firm was to prepare a detailed analysis of Mr. Beyer's current estate plan as well as certain alternative estate plans that were to be designed to reduce Mr. Beyer's estate tax without requiring him to relinquish control of his assets. Craig Plassmeyer signed the May 23, 2003 engagement letter.\n\nIn an engagement letter dated July 16, 2003 (July 16, 2003 engagement letter)8 from Mr. Madonia to Mr. Beyer, Mr. Madonia discussed a meeting that took place on July 9, 2003, in which Mr. Madonia presented certain alternative estate planning strategies to Mr. Beyer. In the July 16, 2003 engagement letter, Mr. Madonia confirmed that his firm was to take steps to implement certain estate planning strategies that he had presented to Mr. Beyer at that meeting. Mr. Beyer signed the July 16, 2003 engagement letter.\n\nFrom around May until October 13, 2003, Mr. Stuart, Mr. Madonia, Craig Plassmeyer, and Mr. Beyer held certain discussions regarding various strategies that would minimize the estate tax to be paid after Mr. Beyer died. As of October [*18] 13, 2003, the strategies that Mr. Beyer had decided to use in order to accomplish that objective included two revocable grantor trusts, a limited partnership, and an irrevocable trust. One of the revocable grantor trusts was to be the general partner of the limited partnership, and the other revocable grantor trust was to be the limited partner of the limited partnership. The irrevocable trust, which Mr. Beyer was not to form until some time after the creation of the limited partnership, was to purchase the limited partnership interest of the revocable grantor trust that was to be the initial limited partner of the limited partnership.\n\nIn order to implement the estate planning strategies that Mr. Beyer had chosen, on October 13, 2003, he, inter alia, signed his last will and testament (Mr. Beyer's will) that Madonia & Associates had prepared for him.9 In Mr. Beyer's will, he named Craig Plassmeyer as the executor of his estate. Mr. Beyer gave the following directive in Mr. Beyer's will:\n\nI direct that the taxes imposed by reason of my death upon property passing under and outside my will be apportioned and paid in the manner provided in the EDWARD G. BEYER LIVING TRUST, and I incorporate the tax apportionment provisions of that [sic] the EDWARD G. BEYER LIVING TRUST as part of my will.\n\nIn order to implement the estate planning strategies that Mr. Beyer had chosen, on October 13, 2003, Mr. Beyer also signed three separate powers of [*19] attorney (October 13, 2003 powers of attorney), each of which was to be construed under Illinois law and each of which Madonia & Associates had prepared for him. In each of the three October 13, 2003 powers of attorney, Mr. Beyer named Craig Plassmeyer as Mr. Beyer's attorney-in-fact and granted him: (1) full power and authority to do everything necessary to transfer, assign, convey, and deliver to the Living Trust [one of the revocable grantor trusts that Mr. Beyer was to create] any interest in property owned by Mr. Beyer, (2) the power to make health care decisions on behalf of Mr. Beyer, and (3) the power to act on Mr. Beyer's behalf in the event of his disability.\n\nIn order to implement the estate planning strategies that Mr. Beyer had chosen, on October 13, 2003, Mr. Beyer also signed a trust agreement (Living Trust agreement) that Madonia & Associates had prepared for him and thereby formed the revocable grantor trust that he named the Edward G. Beyer Living Trust (Living Trust), which was to be the limited partner of the limited partnership. In the Living Trust agreement, Mr. Beyer named himself, Craig Plassmeyer, and Bruce Plassmeyer as the three co-trustees of the Living Trust. The Living Trust agreement provided in pertinent part:\n\n[*20] Article OneEstablishing My Trust\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *Article ThreeTrustee Succession Provisions * * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *Article FiveAdministration of My Trust Upon My Death\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nSection 5.05 Payment of Death Taxes\n\nFor the purposes of this Article, the term \"death taxes\" shall refer to any taxes imposed by reason of my death by federal, state or local authorities, including but not limited to estate, inheritance, gift, and direct-skip generation-skipping transfer taxes. For purposes of this Section, death taxes shall not include any additional estate tax imposed by Section 2031(c)(5)(C), Section 2032A(c) or Section 2057(f) of the Internal Revenue Code or any other comparable recapture tax imposed by any taxing authority. Nor shall death taxes include any generation-skipping transfer tax, other than a direct skip [sic] generation-skipping transfer tax.\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Section or elsewhere in this agreement, my Trustee shall provide for payment of all death taxes from the administrative trust [reference to Living Trust after Mr. Beyer's death] without apportionment. My Trustee shall not seek contribution toward or recovery of any such payments from any individual.\n\n* * * * * * *Article SixSpecific Distributions andDisposition of Tangible Personal Property\n\n* * * * * * *Article EightDistribution-of My Exempt Trust Property\n\nName Relationship Share ______________________________________________________________________ CRAIG PLASSMEYER Nephew 40% BRUCE PLASSMEYER Nephew 40% DORIS KAMINSKI Niece 20%\n\n* * * * * * *Article NineDistribution of My Nonexempt Property\n\nName Relationship Share ______________________________________________________________________ CRAIG PLASSMEYER Nephew 40% BRUCE PLASSMEYER Nephew 40% DORIS KAMINSKI Niece 20%\n\n* * * * * * *Schedule A[10]\n\nTen Dollars Cash\n\nAt no time did Mr. Beyer amend the Living Trust agreement to eliminate the Living Trust's obligation, as set forth in section 5.03 and 5.05 of article five of that agreement, to pay so-called death taxes that would be due after he died (death taxes).\n\nIn order to implement the estate planning strategies that Mr. Beyer had chosen, on October 13, 2003, Mr. Beyer also signed a trust agreement (Management Trust agreement) that Madonia & Associates had prepared for him and thereby formed the revocable grantor trust that he named the Edward G. Beyer Management Trust (Management Trust), which was to be the general partner of the limited partnership. In the Management Trust agreement, Mr. Beyer named [*31] Craig Plassmeyer and Bruce Plassmeyer as the two co-trustees of the Management Trust.11 The Management Trust agreement provided in pertinent part:\n\nArticle OneCreation of the Trust\n\n* * * * * * *Article TwoTrust Purposes\n\n* * * * * * *Article ThreeFunding the Trust\n\n* * * * * * *Article FourBeneficial Ownership of the Trust and Trust Distributions\n\n* * * * * * *Article SixResignation, Replacement, and Succession of Trustees\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *Article NineGeneral Matters and Instructions with Regard to the Trusteeship * * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *Schedule A[12]Initial Funding\n\nOriginal Contribution of Capital: $[no amount listed] Designated Percentage of Ownership: 100%\n\nSchedule B[13]Trust Beneficiaries\n\nTrustmaker EDWARD G.

BEYER LIVING TRUST, dated October 13, 2003 The Management Trust did not maintain a bank account until its co-trustees opened one in October 2009, over two years after Mr. Beyer died.\n\nIn order to implement the estate planning strategies that Mr. Beyer had chosen, on October 13, 2003, Mr. Beyer, acting on behalf of the Living Trust (the limited partner), and Craig Plassmeyer and Bruce Plassmeyer, acting on behalf of the Management Trust (the general partner), signed a limited partnership [*41] agreement (EGBLP agreement) that Madonia & Associates had prepared and thereby formed under Illinois law the limited partnership that they named the Edward G. Beyer Limited Partnership (EGBLP).14 The EGBLP agreement provided in pertinent part:\n\nArticle OneCreation of the Partnership\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *Article ThreePartnership Interests\n\n* * * * * * *Article FourCapital Contributions and Capital Accounts\n\nSection 4.01.

The Partners agree that the property described in Exhibit A has the fair market value (net of liabilities assumed or taken subject to by the Partnership to which such property is subject) listed opposite such property.\n\nEach Partner's Interest shall be credited with an initial contribution equal to the fair market value listed opposite that Partner's name in Exhibit A.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *Article FiveAllocations and Distributions\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *Article SixManagement of the Partnership\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *Article SevenThe General Partner\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nc.

Accordingly, the General Partner may not act in any manner contrary to this agreement; commingle Partnership funds; fail to disclose material facts involving transfers to and from the Partnership; take a Partnership opportunity for its own benefit; or derive a secret personal profit from dealing with the Partnership. The General Partner must account to the Partnership for any benefit, and hold as trustee for the Partnership any profits derived by the General Partner without the consent of the other Partners from any transaction connected with the formation, conduct, or liquidation of the Partnership, or from any use by it of Partnership property.\n\n* * * * * * *Article EightThe Limited Partners * * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *Article NineBooks, Records, and Bank Accounts\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *Article TwelveTransfer of Partnership Interests by a Limited Partner\n\n* * * * * * *Article FifteenGeneral Matters * * * * * * *\n\nSection 15.08.

END OF FOOTNOTE TO TABLE At no time after EGBLP was formed on October 13, 2003, was Exhibit A to the EGBLP agreement completed.\n\n[*66] Around six months after the formation of EGBLP, Mr. Madonia sent an email dated April 2, 2004 (Mr. Madonia's April 2, 2004 email) to Craig Plassmeyer and Mr. Holup. In Mr. Madonia's April 2, 2004 email, Mr. Madonia recommended (1) that most of Mr. Beyer's securities be transferred to an account in EGBLP's name and (2) that Mr. Beyer's cash be left in his personal account. Mr. Madonia concluded in that email: \"We need to establish to the IRS that Edward has enough assets outside of * * * [EGBLP] to live on, and, given Edward's modest lifestyle, I think 1.5M will do that.\"\n\nAt least as of April 2004, EGBLP had opened a brokerage account in its name at Banc One (EGBLP's Banc One account). On April 15, 2004, Mr. Beyer authorized and directed the transfer of certain assets from the 1999 Trust Banc One account to EGBLP's Banc One account. On April 20, 2004, Mr. Beyer's directive was implemented, and Banc One transferred (April 2004 transfer) the securities held in the 1999 Trust Banc One account to EGBLP's Banc One account, thereby funding EGBLP for the first time since its formation. (We shall refer to assets transferred from the 1999 Trust Banc One account to EGBLP's Banc One account as EGBLP's assets.)\n\nAfter the April 2004 transfer, the following shares of stocks and of mutual funds were held in EGBLP's Banc One account:\n\n[*67]\n\nStock1 Number of Shares\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Transocean Ltd. 1,161 Abbott Laboratories 800,000 Altria Group, Inc. 2,400 Arbitron, Inc. 800 Ceridian Corp. 4,000 Chevron Corp. 462 ConocoPhillips Co. 525 Constellation Energy Group 1,800 Edison Int'l 2,000 IBM 4,000 Mirant Corp. 788 Nicor, Inc. 1,052 PPL Corp. 600 Pepco Holdings, Inc. 1,200 Schlumberger Ltd. 6,000 Southern Co. 1,984 ______________________________________________________________________ Mutual Funds Number of Shares ______________________________________________________________________ Putnam Municipal Income Fund 10,578.598 ______________________________________________________________________FOOTNOTE TO TABLE 1 We took judicial notice of the official names of the stocks listed above. END OF FOOTNOTE TO TABLE[*68] On April 15, 2004, Abbott had over 1.5 billion shares of stock outstanding. As of that date, the 800,000 shares of Abbott stock that Mr. Beyer contributed to EGBLP as part of his April 2004 transfer represented less than one percent of Abbott's total outstanding stock. EGBLP did not sell any of the 800,000 shares of Abbott stock that it held before Mr. Beyer died.\n\nAfter Mr. Beyer's April 2004 transfer to EGBLP, he retained certain assets, in his name or in the name of the 1999 Trust. In addition, Mr. Beyer maintained at least two bank accounts in his name at Banc One (Mr. Beyer's Banc One accounts), a checking account and a so-called money market account. In July 2004, the name of the account holder of Mr. Beyer's Banc One accounts was changed from Mr. Beyer to the Living Trust (Living Trust Banc One account).\n\nOn January 6, 2005, Craig Plassmeyer, acting on behalf of the general partner of EGBLP (i.e., the Management Trust),18 requested that Banc One issue a $20,000 check to be drawn on EGBLP's Banc One account to each of Bruce Plassmeyer and himself.19 On March 14, 2005, Craig Plassmeyer, again acting on behalf of the general partner of EGBLP, requested that Banc One issue a $12,000 [*69] check to be drawn on EGBLP's Banc One account to each of Bruce Plassmeyer and himself.20\n\nAround a year after EGBLP was initially funded, Mr. Madonia raised again certain additional estate planning strategies in an email dated March 21, 2005 (March 21, 2005 email) to Craig Plassmeyer.21 Those strategies involved (1) EGBLP's use of a restricted management account and (2) Mr. Beyer's formation of an irrevocable trust and the Living Trust's sale to that newly formed trust of its 99-percent limited partnership interest in EGBLP (99-percent limited partnership interest) in exchange for that irrevocable trust's promissory note.\n\nMr. Beyer decided to implement the first step of one of the estate planning strategies described in Mr. Madonia's March 21, 2005 email. On April 30, 2005, Mr. Beyer signed a trust agreement (Beyer Irrevocable Trust agreement) that [*70] Madonia & Associates had prepared and that he named the Edward G. Beyer Irrevocable Trust (Beyer Irrevocable Trust) and thereby formed an irrevocable trust. In the Beyer Irrevocable Trust agreement, Mr. Beyer named Craig Plassmeyer and Bruce Plassmeyer as co-trustees of the Beyer Irrevocable Trust. The Beyer Irrevocable Trust agreement provided in pertinent part:\n\nArticle OneEstablishing My Trust * * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nSection 1.06 My Beneficiaries\n\nThe beneficiaries of my trust are Craig Plassmeyer, Bruce Plassmeyer and Doris Kaminski.\n\n* * * * * * *Article SixTrust Administration * * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *Schedule A[22]\n\nTen Dollars Cash\n\nOn April 30, 2005, Craig Plassmeyer and Bruce Plassmeyer, acting on behalf of the general partner of EGBLP, implemented the other estate planning strategy described in Mr. Madonia's March 21, 2005 email when they entered into an agreement with the Capital Trust Co. of Delaware (Capital Trust) that was titled \"Capital Trust Investment Account Agreement\" (investment agreement). Pursuant to that agreement, the duration of which was four years, EGBLP was required to deposit into a restricted management account (RMA) assets equal in value to 75 [*75] percent of the fair market value of its assets. Nothing in the investment agreement prohibited the sale of assets that the RMA was to hold pursuant to that agreement.\n\nThe investment agreement provided in pertinent part:\n\nWHEREAS, the Depositor [EGBLP] intends to deposit certain property, such as cash, stocks, bonds, securities and other property, in an Account [RMA] with the Agent * * * [Capital Trust], which property is listed on Exhibit A, attached hereto and made a part of this Agreement;\n\nWHEREAS, the assets in the Account (which include the income, dividends and interest therefrom and the reinvestment thereof) are to be held for the Depositor, and are to be managed, invested and distributed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement by the Agent;\n\nWHEREAS, the Depositor desires to obtain long-term investment results on the Account's assets, and the Depositor and the Agent are entering into this Agreement in order to relieve the Agent of the pressure to produce superior short-term investment results possibly at the expense of greater long-term investment results.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nExhibit B attached to the investment agreement, which was titled \"RESTRICTED MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT AGREEMENT STATEMENT OF INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES\", provided: \"The partnership portfolio currently has a significant built in capital gain. Care should be taken in the management of this portfolio to avoid creating capital gains tax to the partners.\"\n\nOn June 30, 2005, Craig Plassmeyer, acting on behalf of the general partner of EGBLP, directed that 5,363 shares of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and the following shares of stock (RMA assets) be transferred from EGBLP's Banc One account to an account at Chase in the name of the RMA (RMA Chase account):\n\n[*80]\n\nStock Number of Shares\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Transocean Ltd. 870 Abbott Laboratories 600,000 Altria Group, Inc. 1,800 Arbitron, Inc. 600 Ceridian Corp. 3,000 Chevron Corp. 693 ConocoPhillips Co. 788 Constellation Energy Group 1,350 Edison Int'l 1,500 Hospira, Inc. 60,000 IBM 3,000 Mirant Corp. 591 Nicor, Inc. 789 PPL Corp. 450 Pepco Holdings, Inc. 900 Schlumberger Ltd. 4,500 Southern Co. 1,488 On July 11, 2005, the directive of the general partner of EGBLP was implemented and the RMA assets were transferred from the EGBLP Banc One [*81] account to the RMA Chase account. The remaining assets in the EGBLP Banc One account were transferred to another account at Chase in the name of EGBLP (EGBLP Chase account).\n\nOn December 30, 2005, after the general partner of EGBLP entered into the investment agreement, the Living Trust and the Beyer Irrevocable Trust implemented the second step of one of the estate planning strategies described in Mr. Madonia's March 21, 2005 email. On that date, they entered into an agreement titled \"PURCHASE and SALE AGREEMENT [of] LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OWNERSHIP INTERESTS\" (Living Trust transfer agreement). Pursuant to that agreement, the Living Trust was to, and did on December 30, 2005, transfer to the Beyer Irrevocable Trust the 99-percent limited partnership interest in exchange for that trust's promissory note in the face amount of $20,866,725 (Beyer Irrevocable Trust promissory note).23 (We shall sometimes refer to the Living Trust's transfer of the 99-percent limited partnership interest to the Beyer Irrevocable Trust as the Living Trust 2005 transfer.) The principal amount of the Beyer Irrevocable Trust promissory note was payable to the Living [*82] Trust on December 30, 2005.24 The Beyer Irrevocable Trust promissory note bore interest at a rate of 4.45 percent, compounded annually.25\n\nPursuant to the Living Trust transfer agreement, the Beyer Irrevocable Trust promissory note was secured by a security agreement (Beyer Irrevocable Trust security agreement) that was attached as Exhibit B to that agreement. The Beyer Irrevocable Trust security agreement provided in pertinent part:\n\nIn order to secure the payment of the principal of and interest at a rate of 4.45% on, and all other sums payable under, the Twenty Million Eight Hundred Sixty-Six Thousand Seventy Hundred Twenty Five 00/100 ($20,866,725) Dollars, principal amount promissory note (the \"Debtor's Note\") of the Debtor, payable to the order of the Secured Party in accordance with the terms of the Debtor Note, the Debtor hereby grants to the Secured Party a security interest in all accounts and accounts receivable, all machinery, equipment, office furniture and office equipment of the Debtor, and all other tangible personal property, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, including [*83] without limitation, all accessions to and substitutions for the same (all of said property being hereinafter called the \"Collateral\").\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nAs used in this Agreement, the term \"accounts receivable\" includes all rights to payment, all sums of money or other proceeds due or becoming due thereon, all instruments pertaining thereto and all guaranties and security therefore.\n\nWhen the Beyer Irrevocable Trust issued the Beyer Irrevocable Trust promissory note to the Living trust on December 30, 2005, the former had only $10 of assets.\n\nAfter the Living Trust 2005 transfer, Mr. Beyer knew that the Living Trust was no longer a partner in EGBLP and that consequently the Living Trust was no longer entitled to any distributions that EGBLP decided to make to its partners pursuant to the EGBLP agreement. Mr. Beyer also knew after the Living Trust 2005 transfer that the Living Trust's total assets consisted of the Beyer Irrevocable Trust promissory note in the face amount of $20,866,725 and the Living Trust Banc One account, which around one month after the Living Trust 2005 transfer contained approximately $600,000.\n\nAfter the Living Trust 2005 transfer, Mr. Beyer did not contribute additional assets to the Living Trust. Nor did he amend Mr. Beyer's will or the Living Trust [*84] agreement to change the Living Trust's obligation to pay any death taxes that would be due after he died.\n\nOn April 15, 2006, Mr. Beyer signed a check drawn on the Living Trust Banc One account in the amount of $659,660 ($659,660 check) that was payable to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The memorandum line on that check stated: \"Gift Tax\". On April 17, 2006, Mr. Beyer filed Form 709, United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return (Form 709), for his taxable year 2005 (2005 gift tax return), in which he showed total gift tax of $659,660. On the same date, when the Living Trust was not a partner in EGBLP and consequently was not entitled to receive any distributions that EGBLP decided to make to its partners pursuant to the EGBLP agreement, $659,660 was transferred from EGBLP's Chase account to the Living Trust Banc One account. Mr. Beyer used the $659,660 check to pay the gift tax due shown in his 2005 gift tax return.\n\nIn an email dated April 26, 2006, from Craig Plassmeyer to Monique Tayyab (Ms. Tayyab), an attorney with Madonia & Associates, Craig Plassmeyer stated in pertinent part: \"[A]ll these trusts are getting confusing. Explain to me how to record this interest payment. Which specific accounts * * * [should] show the movement of cash[?]\"\n\n[*85] In an email dated April 26, 2006, from Ms. Tayyab to Craig Plassmeyer, Ms. Tayyab stated in pertinent part:\n\nThe Limited Partnership is now owned by the [Beyer] Irrevocable Trust, instead of the Living Trust. Therefore, the interest payment to the Living Trust for the purchase of the Limited Partnership Units should come from the Limited Partnership Account.\n\nYou will show a transfer from the Limited Partnership Account * * * to the Living Trust Account.\n\nAfter the Living Trust 2005 transfer on December 30, 2005, and while the Beyer Irrevocable Trust owned a 99-percent interest in EGBLP and consequently was entitled to receive distributions from EGBLP that it decided to make to its partners pursuant to the EGBLP agreement, EGBLP made certain transfers from the EGBLP Chase account to the Living Trust Banc One account on behalf of the Beyer Irrevocable Trust. The respective amounts of those transfers and the respective dates on which EGBLP made them are:\n\n[*86]\n\nDate Amount\n\n______________________________________________________________________ 6/12/2006 $116,071.161 9/8/2006 116,071.16 12/14/2006 116,071.16 2/26/2007 116,071.16 5/18/2007 116,071.16 10/9/2007 116,071.16 12/7/2007 116,071.16 2/21/2008 116,071.16 ______________________________________________________________________FOOTNOTE TO TABLE 1 In an email dated September 29, 2007, from Margareth Smid (Ms. Smid) to Craig Plassmeyer, Ms. Smid stated that on June 12, 2006, a transfer of $117,375.34, instead of $116,071.16, had been made from the EGBLP Chase account to the Living Trust Banc One account. In the same email, Ms. Smid stated that to correct that error Chase transferred the difference of $1,304.18 from the Living Trust Banc One account to the EGBLP Chase account. END OF FOOTNOTE TO TABLE Each of the transfers of $116,071.16 (listed above) was an interest payment on the Beyer Irrevocable Trust promissory note that EGBLP made to the Living Trust on behalf of its limited partner, the Beyer Irrevocable Trust.\n\nDuring January and February 2008, after Mr. Beyer's death on May 19, 2007, EGBLP sold 1,789 shares of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and the following shares of stock:\n\n[*87]\n\nStock Number of Shares\n\n______________________________________________________________________ Transocean Ltd. 203 Abbott Laboratories 100,000 Altria Group, Inc. 600 Arbitron, Inc. 200 Chevron Corp. 231 ConocoPhillips Co. 262 Constellation Energy Group 450 Edison Int'l 500 IBM 1,000 Kraft Foods Group, Inc. 415 Mirant Corp. 17 Nicor, Inc. 263 PPL Corp. 300 Pepco Holdings, Inc. 300 Schlumberger Ltd. 3,000 Hospira, Inc. 20,000 On February 12, 2008, EGBLP transferred $250,000 from the EGBLP Chase account to the Living Trust Banc One account. On the same date, Craig Plassmeyer, as executor of decedent's estate, signed two checks, each for $75,000, [*88] that were drawn on the EGBLP Chase account and that were payable to Craig Plassmeyer and Bruce Plassmeyer, respectively. Each of those checks stated on the memorandum line: \"Administration Fee\".\n\nAs discussed in more detail below, around February 14, 2008, Craig Plassmeyer, as executor of decedent's estate, filed Form 706, United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return (Form 706), (estate tax return). That return showed net estate tax of $9,345,334. On February 18, 2008, Craig Plassmeyer signed a check drawn on the EGBLP Chase account in the amount of $9,345,334 that was payable to the IRS ($9,345,334 check). The memorandum line of that check stated: \"IRS 706\". Decedent's estate used the $9,345,334 check to pay the estate tax due shown in the estate tax return. On February 19, 2008, at a time the Living Trust was not a partner in EGBLP and consequently was not entitled to receive any distributions that EGBLP decided to make to its partners pursuant to the EGBLP agreement, $9,945,000 was transferred from the EGBLP Chase account to the Living Trust Banc One account.\n\nThe Capital Trust investment agreement terminated after the four-year term of that agreement expired. As a result, in August 2009, assets held in the RMA Chase account were transferred from that account to the EGBLP Chase account.\n\n[*89] Section 529 Accounts and Certain Other Gifts\n\nOn December 28, 2001, Mr. Beyer established a so-called section 529 account26 for each of his following relatives: Wendy Aldrich, Mildred Beyer, Molly Buck, Joan Buck-Plassmeyer, Rebecca Buck, Craig Plassmeyer, Bruce Plassmeyer, Mark Plassmeyer, Ruth Plassmeyer, and Lucille Wilkinson. (We shall refer collectively to the section 529 accounts that Mr. Beyer established in 2001 as the 2001 section 529 accounts.) On the same date, Mr. Beyer contributed $10,000 to each of the 2001 section 529 accounts. On January 3, 2002, Mr. Beyer contributed an additional $55,000 to each of the 2001 section 529 accounts.\n\nIn a facsimile dated December 18, 2004 (Craig Plassmeyer's December 18, 2004 facsimile) from Craig Plassmeyer to Mr. Holup, Craig Plassmeyer instructed Mr. Holup to establish additional section 529 accounts for Mr. Beyer. In Craig Plassmeyer's December 18, 2004 facsimile, Craig Plassmeyer stated:\n\nOn December 21, 2004, Mr. Beyer established a section 529 account for each of his following relatives: Sean Fantetti, Robert Fantetti, Scott Kaminski, Richard Kaminski, Jean Fantetti, Heather Fantetti, Tara Fantetti, and Doris Kaminski. (We shall refer collectively to the section 529 accounts that Mr. Beyer established in 2004 as the 2004 section 529 accounts.) On the same date, Mr. Beyer contributed $11,000 to each of the 2004 section 529 accounts. On January 6, 2005, Mr. Beyer contributed an additional $55,000 to each of the 2004 section 529 accounts. Decedent died within five years after he had made the transfers to the 2004 section 529 accounts.\n\nOn May 20, 2005, Mr. Beyer made a gift of $1,250,000 to each of Craig Plassmeyer and Bruce Plassmeyer. Mr. Beyer used certain assets held in the Living Trust Banc One account to fund each of those gifts.\n\nEGBLP's Partnership Returns\n\nEGBLP did not file Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income (Form 1065), for its taxable year 2003. That was because EGBLP had not yet been funded.\n\n[*91] At times not established by the record, EGBLP filed respective Forms 1065 for taxable years 2004 (2004 EGBLP partnership return), 2005 (2005 EGBLP partnership return), 2006 (2006 EGBLP partnership return), 2007 (2007 EGBLP partnership return), and 2008 (2008 EGBLP partnership return). (We shall sometimes refer collectively to the 2004 EGBLP partnership return, the 2005 EGBLP partnership return, the 2006 EGBLP partnership return, the 2007 EGBLP partnership return, and the 2008 EGBLP partnership return as EGBLP's original partnership returns.)\n\nEGBLP attached to the 2004 EGBLP partnership return two Schedules K-1, Partner's Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc. (Schedule K-1). In one of those schedules, EGBLP showed that the Living Trust had a 99-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2004 but did not show the Living Trust's partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year. In the other Schedule K-1, EGBLP showed that the Management Trust had a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2004 but did not show the Living Trust's partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year.\n\nIn the 2004 EGBLP partnership return, EGBLP showed the following with respect to the capital accounts of its partners: (1) with respect to the Living Trust, a beginning capital account balance of zero, capital contributions of $40,956,813, [*92] a current-year increase of $430,842, and an ending capital account balance of $41,387,655; and (2) with respect to the Management Trust, a beginning capital account balance of zero, capital contributions of $413,705, a current-year increase of $4,352, and an ending capital account balance of $418,057.\n\nEGBLP attached to the 2005 EGBLP partnership return two Schedules K-1. In one of those schedules, EGBLP showed that the Living Trust had a 99-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2005 and a 24.75-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year. In the other Schedule K-1, EGBLP showed that the Management Trust had a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2005 and a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year. The 2005 EGBLP partnership return did not include Schedule K-1 for the Beyer Irrevocable Trust, which acquired the 99-percent limited partnership interest during EGBLP's taxable year 2005.\n\nIn the 2005 EGBLP partnership return, EGBLP showed the following with respect to the capital accounts of its partners: (1) with respect to the Living Trust, a beginning capital account balance of $41,387,655, a current-year increase of $464,313, withdrawals and distributions of $32,993,796, and an ending capital account balance of $8,858,172; and (2) with respect to the Management Trust, a [*93] beginning capital account balance of $418,057, a current-year increase of $8,513, withdrawals and distributions of $214,000, and an ending capital account balance of $212,570.\n\nEGBLP attached to the 2006 EGBLP partnership return three Schedules K-1. In one of those schedules, EGBLP showed that the Living Trust had a 24.75-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2006 and a 24.75-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year. In another Schedule K-1, EGBLP showed that the Management Trust had a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2006 and a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year. In the third Schedule K-1, EGBLP showed that the Beyer Irrevocable Trust had a 74.25-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2006 and a 74.25-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year.\n\nIn the 2006 EGBLP partnership return, EGBLP showed the following with respect to the capital accounts of its partners: (1) with respect to the Living Trust, a beginning capital account balance of $8,608,928, a current-year increase of $198,006, and an ending capital account balance of $8,806,934; (2) with respect to the Management Trust, a beginning capital account balance of $207,392, a current-year increase of $8,001, and an ending capital account balance of [*94] $215,393; and (3) with respect to the Beyer Irrevocable Trust, a beginning capital account balance of $33,502,640, a current-year increase of $594,022, and an ending capital account balance of $34,096,662.\n\nEGBLP attached to the 2007 EGBLP partnership return four Schedules K-1. In one of those schedules, EGBLP showed that the Management Trust had a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2007 and a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year. In another Schedule K-1, EGBLP showed that the Beyer Irrevocable Trust had a 99-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2007 and a 99-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year. In another Schedule K-1, EGBLP did not show that the Management Trust had a partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2007 and did not show the Management Trust's partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year. In the fourth Schedule K-1, EGBLP did not show the Beyer Irrevocable Trust's partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2007 and did not show the Beyer Irrevocable Trust's partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year.\n\nThe 2007 EGBLP partnership return contained two inconsistent Schedules K-1 for each of the Management Trust and the Beyer Irrevocable Trust. With respect to the Management Trust, one of those schedules showed a beginning [*95] capital account balance of $214,526, a current-year decrease of $214,526, and an ending capital account balance of zero. The other Schedule K-1 showed with respect to the Management Trust a beginning capital account balance of zero, a current-year increase of $224,177, and an ending capital account balance of $224,177. With respect to the Beyer Irrevocable Trust, one of the Schedules K-1 showed a beginning capital account balance of $42,904,463, a current-year decrease of $42,904,463, and an ending capital account balance of zero. The other Schedule K-1 showed with respect to the Beyer Irrevocable Trust a beginning capital account balance of zero, a current-year increase of $43,859,836, and an ending capital account balance of $43,859,836.\n\nEGBLP attached to the 2008 EGBLP partnership return two Schedules K-1. In one of those schedules, EGBLP showed that the Management Trust had a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2008 and a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year. In the other Schedule K-1, EGBLP showed that the Beyer Irrevocable Trust had a 99-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2008 and a 99-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year.\n\nIn the 2008 EGBLP partnership return, EGBLP showed the following with respect to the capital accounts of its partners: (1) with respect to the Management [*96] Trust, a beginning capital account balance of $7,852,265, a current-year decrease of $26,018, and an ending capital account balance of $7,826,247; and (2) with respect to the Beyer Irrevocable Trust, a beginning capital account balance of $43,859,836, a current-year decrease of $2,575,934, and an ending capital account balance of $41,283,902.\n\nIn the 2008 EGBLP partnership return, EGBLP showed long-term capital gains for taxable year 2008 from the sale of securities during that taxable year. In that return, EGBLP showed that the securities sold during taxable year 2008 had been acquired by EGBLP on November 19, 2007, and had a basis equal to the value of the securities on that date.\n\nIn 2008, EGBLP filed amended Forms 1065 for its taxable years 2005 (2005 EGBLP amended partnership return) and 2006 (2006 EGBLP amended partnership return).27 (We shall sometimes refer collectively to the 2005 EGBLP amended partnership return and 2006 EGBLP amended partnership return as EGBLP's amended partnership returns filed in 2008.)\n\n[*97] EGBLP attached to the 2005 EGBLP amended partnership return three Schedules K-1. In one of those schedules, EGBLP did not show the Living Trust's ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2005 but showed that the Living Trust had a 99-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year. In another Schedule K-1, EGBLP showed that the Management Trust had a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2005 and a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year. In the third Schedule K-1, EGBLP showed that the Beyer Irrevocable Trust had a 99-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2005 but did not show the Beyer Irrevocable Trust's partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year.\n\nIn the 2005 EGBLP amended partnership return, EGBLP showed the following with respect to the capital accounts of its partners: (1) with respect to the Living Trust, a beginning capital account balance of $41,387,655, capital contributions of ($41,768,415),28 a current-year increase of $380,760, and an ending capital account balance of zero; (2) with respect to the Management Trust, a beginning capital account balance of $418,057, capital contributions of [*98] ($4,793),29 a current-year increase of $7,261, withdrawals and distributions of $214,000, and an ending capital account balance of $206,525; and (3) with respect to the Beyer Irrevocable Trust, a beginning capital account balance of zero, capital contributions of $41,773,208, a current-year increase of $339,227, and an ending capital account balance of $42,112,435.\n\nEGBLP attached to the 2006 EGBLP amended partnership return two Schedules K-1. In one of those schedules, EGBLP showed that the Management Trust had a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2006 and a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year. In the other Schedule K-1, EGBLP showed that the Beyer Irrevocable Trust had a 99-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2006 and a 99-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year.\n\nIn the 2006 EGBLP amended partnership return, EGBLP showed the following with respect to the capital accounts of its partners: (1) with respect to the Management Trust, a beginning capital account balance of $206,525, a current-year increase of $8,001, and an ending capital account balance of $214,526; and (2) with respect to the Beyer Irrevocable Trust, a beginning capital [*99] account balance of $42,112,435 a current-year increase of $792,028, and an ending capital account balance of $42,904,463.\n\nIn 2009, EGBLP filed amended Forms 1065 for its taxable years 2004 (2004 EGBLP amended partnership return), 2005 (2005 EGBLP second amended partnership return), 2006 (2006 EGBLP second amended partnership return), 2007 (2007 EGBLP amended partnership return), and 2008 (2008 EGBLP amended partnership return).30 (We shall sometimes refer collectively to the 2004 EGBLP amended partnership return, 2005 EGBLP second amended partnership return, the 2006 EGBLP second amended partnership return, 2007 EGBLP amended partnership return, and 2008 EGBLP amended partnership return as EGBLP's amended partnership returns filed in 2009).\n\nAttached to each of EGBLP's amended partnership returns filed in 2009 was a document titled \"EXPLANATION STATEMENT\". That statement indicated as follows:\n\nThe Capital Accounts in the above-referenced return of partnership income reflected a percentage ownership of one percent (1%) by the [*100] General Partner and ninety-nine percent (99%) by the Limited Partners. Non-pro rata distributions in each of the partnership's years impacted ownership percentage over time, though corresponding adjustments were not reflected in the Partnership's Forms 1065. In November of 2009, a catch-up proportionate distribution in the amount of $31,920.28 was made to the 1% General Partner, bringing the ownership interests reflected in the Partners' capital accounts back to 99% and 1%. Given the de minimus [sic] nature of the proportionate cumulative distribution, in conjunction with the magnitude of accounting necessary to adjust ownership interests at each distribution date, to bring them back to a 99/1 ratio on November 5, 2009, the General Partner of the Partnership has, in this amended return and in all others, maintained the ownership interests at 99% and 1%.\n\nEGBLP attached to the 2004 EGBLP amended partnership return two Schedules K-1. In one of those schedules, EGBLP showed that the Living Trust had a 99-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2004 but did not show the Living Trust's partnership ownership percentage at the beginning of that year. In the other Schedule K-1, EGBLP showed that the Management Trust had a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2004 but did not show the Management Trust's partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year.\n\nIn the 2004 EGBLP amended partnership return, EGBLP showed the following with respect to the capital accounts of its partners: (1) with respect to the Living Trust, a beginning capital account balance of zero, capital contributions [*101] of $36,261,552, a current-year increase of $430,842, withdrawals or distributions of $218,340, and an ending capital account balance of $36,474,054 and (2) with respect to the Management Trust, a beginning capital account balance of zero, capital contributions of $366,278 a current-year increase of $4,352, and an ending capital account balance of $370,630.\n\nEGBLP attached to the 2005 EGBLP second amended partnership return three Schedules K-1. In one of those schedules, EGBLP did not show the Living Trust's partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2005 but showed that the Living Trust had a 99-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year. In another Schedule K-1, EGBLP showed that the Management Trust had a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2005 and a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year. In the third Schedule K-1, EGBLP showed that the Beyer Irrevocable Trust had a 99-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2005 but did not show the Beyer Irrevocable Trust's partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year.\n\nIn the 2005 EGBLP second amended partnership return, EGBLP showed the following with respect to the capital accounts of its partners: (1) with respect to the Living Trust, a beginning capital account balance of $36,474,054, a [*102] current-year increase of $713,620, withdrawals or distributions of $37,187,674, and an ending capital account balance of zero; (2) with respect to the Management Trust, a beginning capital account balance of $370,630, a current-year increase of $7,242, and an ending capital account balance of $377,872; and (3) with respect to the Beyer Irrevocable Trust, a beginning capital account balance of zero, a current-year increase of $3,909, withdrawals or distributions of $36,773,674, and an ending capital account balance of $36,777,583 (not a negative ending capital account balance).\n\nEGBLP attached to the 2006 EGBLP second amended partnership return two Schedules K-1. In one of those schedules, EGBLP showed that the Management Trust had a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2006 and a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year. In the other Schedule K-1, EGBLP showed that the Beyer Irrevocable Trust had a 99-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2006 and a 99-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year.\n\nIn the 2006 EGBLP second amended partnership return, EGBLP showed the following with respect to the capital accounts of its partners: (1) with respect to the Management Trust, a beginning capital account balance of $377,872, a current [*103] year increase of $8,003, and an ending capital account balance of $385,875; and (2) with respect to the Beyer Irrevocable Trust, a beginning capital account balance of $36,777,583 (not a negative beginning capital account balance), a current-year increase of $792,314, withdrawals or distributions of $1,007,873, and an ending capital account balance of $36,562,024 (not a negative ending capital account balance).\n\nEGBLP attached to the 2007 EGBLP amended partnership return two Schedules K-1. In one of those schedules, EGBLP showed that the Management Trust had a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2007 and a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year. In the other Schedule K-1, EGBLP showed that the Beyer Irrevocable Trust had a 99-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2007 and a 99-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year.\n\nIn the 2007 EGBLP amended partnership return, EGBLP showed the following with respect to the capital accounts of its partners: (1) with respect to the Management Trust, a beginning capital account balance of $385,875, a current-year increase of $219,679, and an ending capital account balance of $605,554 and (2) with respect to the Beyer Irrevocable Trust, a beginning capital account balance of $36,562,024 (not a negative beginning capital account [*104] balance), a current-year increase of $741,980, withdrawals or distributions of $464,285, and an ending capital account balance of $36,839,719 (not a negative ending capital account balance).\n\nEGBLP attached to the 2008 EGBLP amended partnership return two Schedules K-1. In one of those schedules, EGBLP showed that the Management Trust had a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2008 and a one-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year. In the other Schedule K-1, EGBLP showed that the Beyer Irrevocable Trust had a 99-percent partnership ownership interest at the end of taxable year 2008 and a 99-percent partnership ownership interest at the beginning of that year.\n\nIn the 2008 EGBLP amended partnership return, EGBLP showed the following with respect to the capital accounts of its partners: (1) with respect to the Management Trust, a beginning capital account balance of $605,554, a current-year increase of $110,591, and an ending capital account balance of $716,145, and (2) with respect to the Beyer Irrevocable Trust, a beginning capital account balance of $37,931,678 (not a negative beginning capital account balance), a current-year increase of $10,948,397, withdrawals or distributions of $486,071, and an ending capital account balance of $48,394,004 (not a negative ending capital account balance).\n\n[*105] In the 2008 EGBLP amended partnership return, EGBLP showed long-term capital gains for taxable year 2008 from the sale of securities during that taxable year. In that return, EGBLP showed that the securities sold during that taxable year had been acquired by EGBLP on November 19, 2007, and had a basis that was equal to the value of those securities on the alternate valuation date that Mr. Beyer's estate had elected.\n\nAll Forms 1065, original and amended, that EGBLP filed were signed by Mr. Madonia as preparer and by Craig Plassmeyer, acting on behalf of the general partner of EGBLP.\n\nAt a time not established by the record, Madonia & Associates prepared, or maintained, the following documents with respect to EGBLP: (1) purported cash summaries for each of the taxable years from 2004 through 2008; (2) purported working trial balances for each of the taxable years from 2004 through 2008; and (3) purported adjusted journal entries for each of the taxable years 2006 and 2008.\n\nDecedent's Income Tax Returns\n\nAt times not established by the record, Mr. Beyer filed Forms 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return (income tax return), for his taxable years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 (2006 income tax return), and 2007 (2007 income tax return).\n\n[*106] At all relevant times, including after Mr. Beyer, acting on behalf of the limited partner, and Craig Plassmeyer and Bruce Plassmeyer, acting on behalf of the general partner, formed EGBLP, Mr. Beyer continued to report in his income tax returns all of the income from all assets that he had transferred from the 1999 Trust Banc One account to the EGBLP Banc One account.\n\nMr. Beyer did not report any interest income with respect to the Beyer Irrevocable Trust promissory note in his 2006 income tax return or his 2007 income tax return.\n\nMr. Beyer's Gift Tax Returns\n\nMr. Beyer did not file Form 709 for his taxable year 2002 and did not pay any gift tax with respect to that taxable year.\n\nLine B of Schedule A, Computation of Taxable Gifts (Schedule A), attached to Form 709 for gifts made during calendar year 2002 contained a box and stated: \"Check here if you elect under section 529(c)(2)(B) to treat any transfers made this year to a qualified state tuition program as made ratably over a 5-year period beginning this year.\" The instructions for Form 709 for gifts made during calendar year 2002 (instructions for Form 709) stated:\n\nAs discussed above, on April 17, 2006, Mr. Beyer timely filed his 2005 gift tax return, in which he showed total gift tax due of $659,660. Mr. Beyer included Schedule A (2005 Form 709 Schedule A) as part of his 2005 gift tax return. In the 2005 Form 709 Schedule A, Mr. Beyer showed that he had made cash gifts of $1,250,000 to each of Craig Plassmeyer and Bruce Plassmeyer. In the 2005 Form 709 Schedule A, Mr. Beyer applied the section 2503(b) annual exclusion amount [*108] of $11,000 to his cash gift of $1,250,000 to each of Craig Plassmeyer and Bruce Plassmeyer.\n\nMr. Beyer did not show in the 2005 Form 709 Schedule A or anywhere else in his 2005 gift tax return the $55,000 contribution to each of eight 2004 section 529 accounts that he had made during his taxable year 2005. Line B of Schedule A attached to Form 709 for gifts made during calendar year 2005 contained a box and stated: \"Check here if you elect under section 529(c)(2)(B) to treat any transfers made this year to a qualified tuition program as made ratably over a 5-year period beginning this year.\" The instructions for Form 709 for gifts made during calendar year 2005 stated:\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nThe box at line B of the Schedule A attached to Mr. Beyer's 2005 gift tax return was left blank.\n\nOn January 24, 2011, pursuant to section 6020(b), respondent prepared a substitute for Mr. Beyer's gift tax return for his taxable year 2002. Decedent's estate did not pay the gift tax due shown in that gift tax return.\n\nEstate Tax Return\n\nAs indicated previously, around February 14, 2008, Craig Plassmeyer, as executor of decedent's estate, filed Form 706 on behalf of decedent (estate tax return). That return showed net estate tax of $9,345,334. That tax was paid by a [*110] check that Craig Plassmeyer signed on February 18, 2008, that was drawn on the EGBLP Chase account, that was payable to the IRS, and that was in the amount of $9,345,334. In the estate tax return, decedent's estate elected to use the alternate valuation date of November 19, 2007.\n\nDecedent's estate included with the estate tax return Schedule G, Transfers During Decedent's Life (Form 706 Schedule G). Decedent's estate showed in that schedule total assets of $24,838,479. Decedent's estate included in the value of Mr. Beyer's gross estate the values of the respective assets that the Living Trust and Management Trust held on the date of his death. That was because Mr. Beyer had reserved for himself the power during his lifetime to amend and revoke each of those trusts. Thus, in Form 706 Schedule G, decedent's estate reported, inter alia, the value of the Beyer Irrevocable Trust promissory note that the Living Trust held and the one-percent general partnership interest in EGBLP that the Management Trust held.\n\nIn the estate tax return, decedent's estate included in the value of the gross estate a portion of the total contributions that Mr. Beyer had made to each of the [*111] 2004 section 529 accounts and noted that the value \"represents [the] unexpired period of the special 5-year averaging election.\"31\n\nNotice of Deficiency\n\nSometime before March 27, 2009, respondent began an examination of the estate tax return. As a result of respondent's examination, on February 8, 2011, respondent timely issued to decedent's estate a notice of deficiency (notice). In that notice, respondent determined a deficiency in estate tax with respect to decedent's estate.\n\nRespondent also determined in the notice a deficiency in, and additions under section 6651(a)(1) and (2) to, Mr. Beyer's gift tax for his taxable year 200232 and a deficiency in, and an accuracy-related penalty under section 6662(a) on, Mr. Beyer's gift tax for his taxable year 2005.\n\nOPINION\n\nDecedent's estate bears the burden of establishing that the determinations in the notice that remain at issue are erroneous, see Rule 142(a); Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111, 115 (1933), unless that burden shifts to respondent under section [*112] 7491(a). The parties disagree over whether the burden of proof in this case shifts to respondent under that section.\n\nIn order for the burden of proof to shift to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) under section 7491(a), the taxpayer must (1) provide credible evidence with respect to any factual issue relevant to determining the tax liability of the taxpayer and (2) comply with the applicable requirements of section 7491(a)(2). Although section 7491(a) does not define the term \"credible evidence\", the legislative history of the statute does. The legislative history of section 7491(a) provides in pertinent part:\n\nCredible evidence is the quality of evidence which, after critical analysis, the court would find sufficient upon which to base a decision on the issue if no contrary evidence were submitted (without regard to the judicial presumption of IRS correctness). * * * The introduction of evidence will not meet this standard if the court is not convinced that it is worthy of belief. * * *\n\nH.R. Conf. Rept. No. 105-599, at 240-241 (1998), 1998-3 C.B. 747, 994-995.\n\nAs discussed below, there are factual issues relevant to determining the estate tax liability of decedent's estate and the gift tax liability of decedent for each of his taxable years 2002 and 2005 with respect to which we conclude decedent's estate did not introduce credible evidence within the meaning of section 7491(a)(1). On the record before us, we find that the burden of proof does [*113] not shift to respondent under section 7491(a) with respect to any respective factual issues that pertain to the estate tax liability of decedent's estate and the gift tax liability of decedent for each of his taxable years 2002 and 2005.\n\nEstate Tax\n\nSection 2036(a)\n\nIt is respondent's position that the value of assets that Mr. Beyer transferred, through the 1999 Trust, to EGBLP and held by EGBLP on the date of Mr. Beyer's death is includible in the value of his gross estate under section 2036(a).33 Decedent's estate disagrees.\n\n[*114] In order to resolve the parties' dispute under section 2036(a),34 we must consider the following factual issues with respect to Mr. Beyer's transfer of property to EGBLP:\n\nDecedent's estate acknowledges that Mr. Beyer, through the 1999 Trust,35 transferred property to EGBLP on April 20, 2004. (Mr. Beyer's April 2004 transfer to EGBLP). In the light of that acknowledgment by decedent's estate, we find that Mr. Beyer's April 2004 transfer to EBGLP was a transfer of property under section 2036(a).\n\nTransfer Other Than a Bona Fide Sale for an Adequate and Full Consideration in Money or Money's Worth\n\nSection 2036(a) excepts from its application any transfer of property otherwise subject to that section which is a \"bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth\" (sometimes, bona fide sale exception). The foregoing exception is limited to a transfer of property where the transferor [*116] \"has received benefit in full consideration in a genuine arm's length transaction\". Estate of Goetchius v. Commissioner, 17 T.C. 495, 503 (1951).\n\nWe have held that the bona fide sale exception in section 2036(a) is satisfied in the context of a family limited partnership\n\nwhere the record establishes the existence of a legitimate and significant nontax reason for creating the family limited partnership, and the transferors received partnership interests proportionate to the value of the property transferred. See, e.g., Estate of Stone v. Commissioner, * * * [T.C. Memo. 2003-309]. The objective evidence must indicate that the nontax reason was a significant factor that motivated the partnership's creation. A significant purpose must be an actual motivation, not a theoretical justification. [Certain citations omitted.]\n\nEstate of Bongard v. Commissioner, 124 T.C. 95, 118 (2005). Moreover, we must \"separate the true nontax reasons for the entity's formation from those that merely clothe transfer tax savings motives.\" Id. at 121.\n\nWe also have held that the bona fide sale exception does not apply \"where the facts fail to establish that the transfer was motivated by a legitimate and significant nontax purpose.\" Id. at 118; see Liljestrand v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2011-259, 2011 WL 5213428, at *11-*12. In Estate of Bongard v. Commissioner, 124 T.C. at 118-119, we discussed a number of factors that support a finding that a transfer was not motivated by a legitimate and significant nontax purpose, including \"the taxpayer standing on both sides of the transaction, the [*117] taxpayer's financial dependence on distributions from the partnership, the partners' commingling of partnership funds with their own, and the taxpayer's actual failure to transfer the property to the partnership\". (Citations omitted.)\n\nIn Liljestrand v. Commissioner, 2011 WL 5213428, at *11-*12, we concluded that the failure to follow partnership formalities also is a factor that supports a finding that a transfer was not motivated by a legitimate and significant nontax purpose.\n\nWe turn now to the respective arguments of the parties with respect to whether, as decedent's estate maintains, Mr. Beyer's April 2004 transfer to EGBLP was a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth within the meaning of section 2036(a). We consider first whether, as decedent's estate contends, Mr. Beyer had legitimate and significant nontax reasons for forming, and transferring assets to, EGBLP. In this connection, the parties agree that \"[i]n creating the Partnership [EGBLP], Mr. Beyer desired to keep the Abbott stock in a block and keep his investment portfolio intact, wanted to transition Craig into managing assets, and wanted continuity of management.\"36 (We shall refer to the desires which the parties agreed Mr. Beyer had when he [*118] formed, and transferred assets to, EGBLP as Mr. Beyer's desires.) According to decedent's estate, certain caselaw has found reasons such as Mr. Beyer's desires to be legitimate and significant nontax reasons for forming, and transferring assets to, a limited partnership such as EGBLP.\n\nRespondent counters that Mr. Beyer's desires do not constitute legitimate and significant nontax reasons under applicable caselaw for forming, and transferring assets to, EGBLP. According to respondent, Mr. Beyer had no legitimate and significant nontax reason for doing so. Respondent maintains that Mr. Beyer's \"[o]nly significant reason for the formation of the Partnership [, and transfer of assets to, EGBLP] was to attempt to generate transfer tax savings.\"\n\nBefore addressing the argument of decedent's estate that certain cases have found reasons such as Mr. Beyer's desires to be legitimate and significant nontax reasons for forming, and transferring assets to, a limited partnership such as EGBLP, we note section 1.03 of EGBLP's agreement contains a list of what appear to be 28 boilerplate purposes that Mr. Beyer wanted to accomplish by forming EGBLP. However, none of Mr. Beyer's desires are in that list.\n\n[*119] We consider now decedent's estate's argument that certain cases37 have found reasons such as Mr. Beyer's desires to be legitimate and significant nontax reasons for forming, and transferring assets to, a limited partnership such as EGBLP. We find the cases on which decedent's estate relies to be materially distinguishable from the instant case and its reliance on those cases to be misplaced. Decedent's estate fails to acknowledge in advancing its argument under those cases that any findings in those cases that reasons such as Mr. Beyer's desires constitute legitimate and significant nontax reasons for forming, and transferring assets to, a limited partnership such as EGBLP were based upon all of the facts and circumstances that the courts found in those cases.\n\nWe address now whether on the record before us any of Mr. Beyer's desires constitutes a legitimate and significant nontax purpose for forming, and transferring assets to, EGBLP for purposes of the bona fide sale exception in section 2036(a). We turn first to whether Mr. Beyer's desire to keep the Abbott [*120] stock in a block and to maintain his investment portfolio intact constitutes such a purpose. Decedent's estate contends that if Mr. Beyer had not transferred to EGBLP assets that the 1999 Trust held in the 1999 Trust Banc One account, those assets would have been divided upon termination of the 1999 Trust and distributed among Craig Plassmeyer and his descendants per stirpes, Bruce Plassmeyer and his descendants per stirpes, and Doris Kaminski and her descendants per stirpes (1999 Trust beneficiaries). The facts that we have found belie that contention. Decedent's estate correctly states that pursuant to the 1999 Trust agreement assets that the 1999 Trust held were to be divided upon the termination of that trust and distributed among the 1999 Trust beneficiaries. However, Mr. Beyer could have amended the 1999 Trust agreement at any time to prevent those distributions from occurring.38 Decedent's estate does not explain, and the record does not otherwise establish, why he did not do so or why he did not even consider doing so.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Beyer's forming, and transferring assets to, EGBLP did not achieve Mr. Beyer's desire to keep the Abbott stock in a block and to maintain his [*121] investment portfolio intact. That is because EGBLP's agreement did not require EGBLP to continue to hold, before or after Mr. Beyer died, (1) the 800,000 shares of Abbott stock as a block or (2) the other assets that he transferred to EGBLP. In fact, decedent's estate acknowledges that \"Craig had the power, if the need arose, to sell the Abbott stock, and he could have exercised that power if necessary.\"\n\nOn the record before us, we find that decedent's estate did not introduce credible evidence, see sec. 7491(a), and has failed to carry its burden of establishing that for purposes of the bona fide sale exception in section 2036(a) Mr. Beyer's desires to keep the Abbott stock in a block and to maintain his investment portfolio intact constitute a legitimate and significant nontax purpose for forming, and transferring assets to, EGBLP.\n\nWe turn next to decedent's estate's contention that for purposes of the bona fide sale exception in section 2036(a) Mr. Beyer's desire to transition Craig Plassmeyer into managing assets of Mr. Beyer constitutes a legitimate and significant nontax reason for forming, and transferring assets to, EGBLP. In support of that contention, decedent's estate maintains that forming EGBLP and designating Craig Plassmeyer as a co-trustee of the Management Trust, which was EGBLP's general partner, would provide him with the opportunity to manage Mr. [*122] Beyer's assets. The facts that we have found belie that contention. Before Mr. Beyer formed, and transferred assets to, EGBLP, Craig Plassmeyer had the opportunity to, and in fact did, manage the 1999 Trust's assets that it held in the 1999 Trust Banc One account. In this connection, on October 29, 2001, Mr. Beyer executed a power of attorney that named Craig Plassmeyer as his attorney-in-fact and gave Craig Plassmeyer \"BROAD POWERS TO HANDLE * * * [Mr. Beyer's] PROPERTY, WHICH MAY INCLUDE POWERS TO PLEDGE, SELL OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF ANY REAL OR PERSONAL PROPERTY WITHOUT ADVANCE NOTICE TO * * * [Mr. Beyer] OR APPROVAL BY * * * [Mr. Beyer].\"39 Moreover, Mr. Beyer could have amended the 1999 Trust agreement and named Craig Plassmeyer (or any other person or company) as the trustee, or as a co-trustee, of that trust during Mr. Beyer's lifetime, regardless of whether he formed EGBLP. Decedent's estate does not explain, and the record [*123] does not otherwise establish, why he did not do so or why he did not even consider doing so.\n\nOn the record before us, we find that decedent's estate did not introduce credible evidence, see sec. 7491(a), and has failed to carry its burden of establishing that for purposes of the bona fide sale exception in section 2036(a) Mr. Beyer's desire to transition Craig into managing Mr. Beyer's assets constitutes a legitimate and significant nontax purpose for forming, and transferring assets to, EGBLP.\n\nWe consider finally decedent's estate's contention that for purposes of the bona fide sale exception in section 2036(a) Mr. Beyer's desire to ensure continuity of management of his assets constitutes a legitimate and significant nontax reason for forming, and transferring assets to, EGBLP. Implicit in that contention is the assumption that if Mr. Beyer had not formed, and had not transferred assets to, EGBLP, the assets that the 1999 Trust held in the 1999 Trust Banc One account would not continue to be managed by the same managers. The facts that we have found belie that contention. As discussed previously, Mr. Beyer could have amended the 1999 Trust agreement and named Craig Plassmeyer (or any other person or company) as the trustee, or as a co-trustee, of that trust during Mr. Beyer's lifetime, regardless of whether he formed EGBLP. Decedent's estate does [*124] not explain, and the record does not otherwise establish, why he did not do so or why he did not even consider doing so.\n\nOn the record before us, we find that decedent's estate did not introduce credible evidence, see sec. 7491(a), and has failed to carry its burden of establishing that for purposes of the bona fide sale exception in section 2036(a) Mr. Beyer's desire to ensure continuity of management of his assets constitutes a legitimate and significant nontax purpose for forming, and transferring assets to, EGBLP.\n\nOn the record before us, we find that decedent's estate did not introduce credible evidence, see sec. 7491(a), and has failed to carry its burden of establishing that for purposes of the bona fide sale exception in section 2036(a) Mr. Beyer had any legitimate and significant nontax purpose for forming, and transferring assets to, EGBLP.\n\nAssuming arguendo that decedent's estate had not failed to carry its burden of establishing that for purposes of the bona fide sale exception in section 2036(a) Mr. Beyer had a legitimate and significant nontax purpose for forming, and transferring assets to, EGBLP, we nonetheless would find on the record before us that decedent's estate has failed to carry its burden of establishing that the bona fide sale exception in section 2036(a) applies to Mr. Beyer's April 2004 transfer to [*125] EBGLP. That is because decedent's estate has failed to carry its burden of establishing that Mr. Beyer received an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth within the meaning of section 2036(a) for Mr. Beyer's April 2004 transfer to EBGLP.\n\nIn support of its argument that Mr. Beyer received an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth within the meaning of section 2036(a) for Mr. Beyer's April 2004 transfer to EBGLP, decedent's estate contends that (1) Mr. Beyer received, through the Living Trust and the Management Trust, an interest in EGBLP proportionate to the value of assets that he transferred to it; (2) the respective capital accounts that EGBLP maintained for the Living Trust and the Management Trust were properly credited with those assets; and (3) in the event of the liquidation and the dissolution of EGBLP the Living Trust and the Management Trust had the right to distributions of property from EGBLP in accordance with their respective capital accounts. On the record before us, we reject those contentions.\n\nEGBLP's agreement required EGBLP to establish and maintain respective capital accounts for all of its partners, including any general partner and any limited partner, and to show in those accounts the respective interests that those partners received in exchange for any initial and subsequent contribution that any [*126] such partner made to EGBLP. The record does not establish that EGBLP satisfied those requirements of the EGBLP agreement. Indeed, the record does not establish that EGBLP established and maintained respective capital accounts for its partners, let alone that it showed in those accounts the respective interests that those partners received in exchange for any initial and subsequent contribution that any such partner made to EGBLP.40\n\nOn the record before us, we find that decedent's estate did not introduce credible evidence, see sec. 7491(a), and has failed to carry its burden of establishing that Mr. Beyer received an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth within the meaning of section 2036(a) for Mr. Beyer's April 2004 transfer to EGBLP.\n\nBased upon our examination of the entire record before us, we find that decedent's estate has failed to carry its burden of establishing that Mr. Beyer's April 2004 transfer to EGBLP was a bona fide sale for an adequate and full [*127] consideration in money or money's worth within the meaning of section 2036(a). Based upon that examination, we further find that the bona fide sale exception in section 2036(a) does not apply to Mr. Beyer's April 2004 transfer to EGBLP.\n\nPossession or Enjoyment of, or Right to Income From, the Property Transferred\n\nUnder section 2036(a)(1), \"[a]n interest or right is treated as having been retained or reserved if at the time of the transfer there was an understanding, express or implied, that the interest or right would later be conferred.\" Sec. 20.2036-1(c)(1)(i), Estate Tax Regs. The existence of an implied agreement or understanding \"is a question of fact that can be inferred from the circumstances surrounding a transfer of property and the subsequent use of the transferred property.\" Estate of Bongard v. Commissioner, 124 T.C. at 129 (citing Estate of Thompson v. Commissioner, 382 F.3d 367, 376 (3d Cir. 2004), and Estate of Reichardt v. Commissioner, 114 T.C. 144, 151 (2000)). In certain estate tax cases involving assets that an individual who later died transferred to a limited partnership, we found that certain facts, including whether the decedents in those cases continued to use assets that they transferred to the partnership and whether they transferred almost all of their assets to the partnership, demonstrated that at [*128] the time of the transfers in question there was an implied agreement to retain the possession or the enjoyment of, or the right to the income from, assets that the decedents in those cases transferred to the partnership within the meaning of section 2036(a)(1). See Estate of Bongard v. Commissioner, 124 T.C. at 129-131; Estate of Reichardt v. Commissioner, 114 T.C. at 151-153; Estate of Miller v. Commissioner, T.C.

Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2002-121, 2002 WL 992347, at *12.\n\nDecedent's estate bears the burden, which is especially onerous for transactions involving family members, of establishing that at the time of Mr. Beyer's April 2004 transfer of property to EGBLP there was no implied agreement or understanding that he retain the possession or the enjoyment of, or the right to the income from, those assets within the meaning of section 2036(a)(1). See Estate of Reichardt v. Commissioner, 114 T.C. at 151; Estate of Turner v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2011-209, 2011 WL 3835663, at *18.\n\nDecedent's estate argues that the totality of the circumstances demonstrates that at the time of Mr. Beyer's April 2004 transfer of property to EGBLP there was no implied agreement or understanding that he retain the possession or the [*129] enjoyment of, or the right to the income from, assets that he transferred to EGBLP within the meaning of section 2036(a)(1).\n\nRespondent's disagrees. According to respondent, Mr. Beyer continued to use assets that he transferred to EGBLP, and he failed to retain sufficient assets outside of EGBLP to pay his anticipated financial obligations.\n\nWe address first respondent's argument that Mr. Beyer continued to use assets that he transferred to EGBLP. In support of that argument, respondent relies on a number of payments that EGBLP made to the Living Trust at a time when that trust no longer held a limited partnership interest in EGBLP. EGBLP made one of those payments on April 17, 2006. On that date, there was a transfer of $659,660 from the EGBLP Chase account to the Living Trust account. Decedent's estate contends that EGBLP's payment to the Living Trust on April 17, 2006, was an interest payment on the Beyer Irrevocable Trust promissory note, which EGBLP made to the Living Trust on behalf of the Beyer Irrevocable Trust, a limited partner in EGBLP at the time of that payment.\n\nThe $659,660 that EGBLP paid to the Living Trust on April 17, 2006, is not equal to the amount of the interest that was payable by the Beyer Irrevocable Trust each calendar quarter on the 15th day of the month (i.e., $116,071.16) on the Beyer Irrevocable Trust promissory note. Moreover, on April 17, 2006, when [*130] EGBLP made the transfer of $659,660 to the Living Trust, no interest was due to be paid on that note.41 In addition, when EGBLP paid the Living Trust $659,660 on April 17, 2006, the Living Trust was not a partner in EGBLP and therefore was not entitled to receive distributions from EGBLP. Finally, we have found that the Living Trust used the $659,660 that it received from EGBLP to pay Mr. Beyer's 2005 gift tax liability of $659,660.\n\nOn the record before us, we find that the transfer of $659,660 from the EGBLP Chase account to the Living Trust account supports respondent's position that at the time Mr. Beyer transferred certain assets to EGBLP there was an implied agreement or understanding that he retain the possession or the enjoyment of, or the right to the income from, assets that he transferred to EGBLP within the meaning of section 2036(a)(1).\n\n[*131] In further support of respondent's argument that Mr. Beyer continued to use assets that he transferred to EGBLP, respondent relies on the following transfers from the EGBLP Chase account to the Living Trust account:\n\nDate Amount\n\n______________________________________________________________________ 6/12/2006 $116,071.161 9/8/2006 116,071.16 12/14/2006 116,071.16 2/26/2007 116,071.16 5/18/2007 116,071.16 10/9/2007 116,071.16 12/7/2007 116,071.16 2/21/2008 116,071.16 ______________________________________________________________________FOOTNOTE TO TABLE 1 In an email dated September 29, 2007, from Ms. Smid to Craig Plassmeyer, Ms. Smid stated that on June 12, 2006, a transfer of $117,375.34, instead of $116,071.16, had been made from the EGBLP Chase account to the Living Trust Banc One account. In the same email, Ms. Smid stated that to correct that error Chase transferred the difference of $1,304.18 from the Living Trust Banc One account to the EGBLP Chase account. END OF FOOTNOTE TO TABLE We have found that at the time EGBLP made each payment of $116,071.16 (listed above) to the Living Trust the Beyer Irrevocable Trust owned a 99-percent limited partnership interest in EGBLP and consequently was entitled to receive distributions from EGBLP. We have further found that at each of those times each of those payments was an interest payment on the Beyer Irrevocable Trust [*132] promissory note that EGBLP made to the Living Trust on behalf of the Beyer Irrevocable Trust.\n\nOn the record before us, we find that none of the payments of $116,071.16 (listed above) that EGBLP made to the Living Trust supports respondent's position that at the time Mr. Beyer transferred certain assets to EGBLP there was an implied agreement or understanding that he retain the possession or the enjoyment of, or the right to the income from, assets that he transferred to EGBLP within the meaning of section 2036(a)(1).\n\nIn further support of respondent's argument that Mr. Beyer continued to use assets that he transferred to EGBLP, respondent relies on a transfer of $9,945,000 made on February 19, 2008, from the EGBLP Chase account to the Living Trust account. Decedent's estate contends that under Estate of Mirowski v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2008-74, EGBLP's transfer of $9,945,000 is irrelevant because \"post-death treatment of the Partnership's assets is irrelevant to a section 2036 inquiry\". Assuming arguendo that Estate of Mirowski held what decedent's estate claims it held, we find Estate of Mirowski to be materially distinguishable from the instant case and decedent's estate's reliance on that case to be misplaced. We must nonetheless address whether the transfer of $9,945,000 made on February 19, 2008, from the EGBLP Chase account to the Living Trust [*133] account supports respondent's position that at the time Mr. Beyer transferred certain assets to EGBLP there was an implied agreement or understanding that he retain the possession or the enjoyment of, or the right to the income from, assets that he transferred to EGBLP within the meaning of section 2036(a)(1).\n\nThe Living Trust agreement that Mr. Beyer signed in order to create the Living Trust, which Mr. Beyer formed on the same day (i.e., October 13, 2003) on which he formed EGBLP, obligated the Living Trust to pay any death taxes due after Mr. Beyer died. Mr. Beyer's will, which he also executed on October 13, 2003, did not obligate his probate estate to those death taxes. After the Living Trust transferred the 99-percent limited partnership interest in EGBLP that it had owned to the Beyer Irrevocable Trust (i.e., after the Living Trust 2005 transfer), Mr. Beyer knew that the Living Trust was no longer a partner in EGBLP and consequently the Living Trust was no longer entitled to distributions that EGBLP decided to make to its partners pursuant to the EGBLP agreement. Mr. Beyer also knew after the Living Trust 2005 transfer that the Living Trust's total assets consisted of the Living Trust account, which contained approximately $600,000, and the Beyer Irrevocable Trust promissory note, which had a face amount of $20,866,725. Nonetheless, after the Living Trust 2005 transfer Mr. Beyer did not [*134] contribute additional assets to the Living Trust, in order to ensure that the Living Trust would have enough assets to satisfy its obligation under the Living Trust agreement to pay death taxes. Moreover, after the Living Trust 2005 transfer, Mr. Beyer did not amend the Living Trust agreement to eliminate the Living Trust's obligation to pay those taxes. Nor did he amend his will to place that obligation on his probate estate. In addition, after Mr. Beyer's death on May 19, 2007, the Living Trust did not attempt to borrow against the Beyer Irrevocable Trust promissory note in order to acquire enough cash to satisfy its obligation under the Living Trust agreement to pay death taxes.\n\nOn the record before us, we find that Mr. Beyer knew not only at the time he formed EGBLP and the Living Trust and executed his will but also at the time and after the Living Trust sold its limited partnership interest in EGBLP to the Beyer Irrevocable Trust that the Living Trust would need to use a very substantial amount of assets of EGBLP in order to satisfy its obligation under the Living Trust agreement to pay death taxes. He also knew after the Living Trust sold its limited partnership interest in EGBLP to the Beyer Irrevocable Trust that the Living Trust no longer had sufficient liquid assets to satisfy that obligation and that the Living Trust was no longer entitled to any assets of EGBLP. See Estate of Miller v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2009-119.\n\n[*135] On the record before us, we find that the payment of $9,945,000 that EGBLP made to the Living Trust after Mr. Beyer died supports respondent's position that at the time Mr. Beyer transferred certain assets to EGBLP there was an implied agreement or understanding that he retain the possession or the enjoyment of, or the right to the income from, assets that he transferred to EGBLP within the meaning of section 2036(a)(1).\n\nOn the record before us, we find that decedent's estate did not introduce credible evidence, see sec. 7491(a)(1), and has failed to carry its burden of establishing that Mr. Beyer did not continue to use assets that he transferred to EGBLP after Mr. Beyer's April 2004 transfer to EGBLP.\n\nWe next address respondent's argument, in support of respondent's position that at the time Mr. Beyer transferred certain assets to EGBLP there was an implied agreement or understanding that he retain the possession or the enjoyment of, or the right to the income from, assets that he transferred to EGBLP within the meaning of section 2036(a)(1), that Mr. Beyer failed to retain sufficient assets outside of EGBLP to pay his anticipated financial obligations. The parties agree that Mr. Beyer retained, either personally or through the Living Trust, and did not transfer to EGBLP, assets valued at approximately $4 million. However, the [*136] parties disagree over whether those assets were sufficient to satisfy Mr. Beyer's anticipated financial obligations.\n\nWe have found that on May 20, 2005, after Mr. Beyer transferred certain of his assets to EGBLP, he made a gift of $1,250,000 to each of Craig Plassmeyer and Bruce Plassmeyer. Those gifts totaling $2,500,000 obviously reduced the total amount of assets that the parties agree Mr. Beyer retained outside of EGBLP (i.e., approximately $4 million) to approximately $1,500,000. We have also found that Mr. Beyer used EGBLP assets to pay his 2005 gift tax liability of $659,660. On the record before us, we find that Mr. Beyer would have not used EGBLP assets to pay his 2005 gift tax liability (1) if, as decedent's estate contends, Mr. Beyer had retained sufficient assets outside of EGBLP to satisfy his anticipated financial obligations and/or (2) if, as decedent's estate also contends, at the time Mr. Beyer transferred certain assets to EGBLP there was no implied agreement or understanding that he retain the possession or the enjoyment of, or the right to the income from, assets that he transferred to EGBLP within the meaning of section 2036(a)(1).\n\nOn the record before us, we find that decedent's estate did not introduce credible evidence, see sec. 7491(a)(1), and has failed to carry its burden of [*137] establishing that Mr. Beyer retained sufficient assets outside of EGBLP to satisfy his anticipated financial obligations.\n\nBased upon our examination of the entire record before us, we find that decedent's estate has failed to carry its burden of establishing that at the time Mr. Beyer transferred certain assets to EGBLP there was no implied agreement or understanding that he retain the possession or the enjoyment of, or the right to the income from, assets that he transferred to EGBLP within the meaning of section 2036(a)(1). Based upon our examination of that record, we further find that decedent's estate has failed to carry its burden of establishing that Mr. Beyer did not retain the possession or the enjoyment of, or the right to the income from, assets that he transferred to EGBLP within the meaning of section 2036(a)(1).42\n\nBased upon our examination of the entire record before us, we find that decedent's estate has failed to carry its burden of establishing that the value of the assets that EGBLP held on the date of decedent's death is not includible in the value of his gross estate under section 2036(a)(1).43\n\n[*138] Value of Assets Includible in the Value of the Gross Estate of Decedent Under Section 2036(a)(1)\n\nThe parties stipulated the net asset value on the alternate valuation date44 of assets of EGBLP in the event that we were to find, which we have, that the value of those assets is includible in the value of the gross estate of decedent. However, they disagree over whether that value should be discounted, as decedent's estate maintains, in determining the value on that alternate valuation date of those assets because certain of those assets were held in the restricted management account (i.e., the RMA).\n\nUnder the terms of the investment agreement of Capital Trust, to which the Management Trust, as the general partner of EGBLP, and Capital Trust, as the agent of EGBLP, agreed, Capital Trust was to hold in the RMA, which was subject to the terms of that agreement, 75 percent of EGBLP's assets for four years. During that four-year period, the Capital Trust investment agreement (1) required dividends and interest on assets held in the RMA to be distributed to EGBLP and (2) prohibited the distribution of principal from the RMA to EGBLP. In addition, the investment agreement of Capital Trust permitted EGBLP to transfer \"all or any part of the * * * [RMA]\" after receiving the written consent of [*139] Capital Trust but only to a permitted transferee, as defined in the Capital Trust investment agreement, who executes certain documents.45 The Capital Trust investment agreement did not prohibit Capital Trust from selling assets held in the RMA.\n\nIt is the position of decedent's estate that a discount should be applied to the stipulated net asset value of assets of EGBLP in order to take into account the restrictions that the Capital Trust investment agreement imposed on the RMA, to which EGBLP had transferred 75 percent of its assets when the RMA was created.46\n\n[*140] In support of respondent's position that the stipulated net asset value on the alternate valuation date of assets of EGBLP should not be discounted to take into account the restrictions that the Capital Trust investment agreement imposed on the RMA,47 respondent relies on Estate of Kahn v. Commissioner, 125 T.C. 227(2005), and Estate of Foster v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2011-95, 2011 WL 1598633, aff'd, 565 F. App'x 654 (9th Cir. 2014).48\n\nIn Estate of Kahn, the value of each of two individual retirement accounts (IRAs), which held certain marketable securities, was includible under section 2039(a) in the value of the gross estate of the decedent involved in that case. One of the issues there was whether it was appropriate to apply a discount to assets [*141] held in each of the IRAs in determining the value of each of those IRAs to be included in the value of the gross estate of the decedent involved in that case. See Estate of Kahn v. Commissioner, 125 T.C. at 228. In Estate of Kahn, although the terms of each of the IRAs prohibited that decedent from selling any interest therein, those terms permitted the marketable securities that were held in those IRAs to be sold. See id. at 229. We concluded in Estate of Kahn that, in determining the fair market value49 of each of the IRAs \"under the willing buyer-willing seller test, we must take into account what would actually be sold -- the securities.\" Id. at 241. On the record presented to us in that case, we held that, in determining the fair market value of each of the IRA"
