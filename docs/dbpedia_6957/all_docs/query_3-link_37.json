        "text": "Once again drawing attention to this because they are so close to meeting their match funding requirement now... Any alumni of Flakefleet Primary School in here? Or a company in need of a good cause to get behind? Those who have followed the mighty Flakefleet's adventures over recent years will have seen their run to the Britain's Got Talent final including a Golden Buzzer and their tilt at Xmas number 1! The point, of course, is to show that kids that you should hashtag #daretodream and that anything is possible regardless of your background. Their next big adventure is to have a music festival on their school field. They did this successful pre-pandemic and it's time for the return. The simple idea is to provide the festival experience for those families without the budget to travel to other festivals and once again show the kids that anything is possible. They are in need of support be it either via donations or with a sponsor. https://lnkd.in/dSAv8QUr. Sponsor wise, I am happy to advise and explore with anyone. Please DM me for details. And anyone else? Please share this. You never know who YOUR share might hit. And why am I involved? Simple. Once a Flakey kid, always a Flakey kid. hashtag #sponsorship #Corporatesocial responsibility\n\nLast night I went to an event called \"The Great Kitchen Party.\" Allow me to set the scene for you: Location: Carlu in Toronto Time: 5pm till......... Charity MusiCounts is Canada's music education charity associated with The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and The JUNO Awards. At MusiCounts, they make music education inclusive, sustainable, and accessible for youth across Canada by providing musical instruments, equipment, and resources. Cause: The MusiCounts Community Music Program provides not-for-profit organizations with grants of up to $15,000 in instruments, equipment, and resources to support music education programs at the community level. Lead sponsor: MNP Idea: A culinary competition of chefs, moving onto the Canadian Culinary championships in Ottawa March of 2024. Silent Auction: Travel, destinations with chefs and musicans like Jim cuddy, 54-40, Steven Page and many more acompanying you on the adventure. Producer: Chad Brincheski of ESP Inc. I enjoy being a guest, because for all the years I attended events for my company called The Idea Hunter, I remember what it felt like to have the perfect day or not. It takes strength, awareness and pure imagination to make an event great and even when you think it's perfect, you can analyze it later to see what you might have done differently. This image is the truth about an event professional. This is where humility takes a front row seat in our industry. The truth is we need to print this on a t. shirt and give them away as a reminder of what the perfect day is like in the life of an event prof. Funny Friday and who knows, this could be your perfect day? #eventprofessionals #meetingprofs #culinarycreativity Lisa Pasin #musicindustry\n\nI just posted this on a Guardian article about the state of the UK music ecosystem, specifically the plight of smaller venues. Most people don’t realise that beneath these ‘grassroots venues’ are the actual grassroots venues. Around 95% of UK music is performed in non dedicated music venues like, pubs, social clubs, churches, community halls etc. THESE are the actual grassroots below the ‘official’ grassroots venues. Sure, they don’t have the kind of outgoings the size of an actual venue but they do have some, (venue hire, advertising, website fees, equipment purchase and maintenance etc) which are often paid for by the volunteers who run the nights, when times get hard. With absolutely zero help in the post Covid ‘Culture Recovery Fund’ many of these clubs have folded because the money has simply run out. What kind of government allows this to happen? I started a charity to help exactly these venues. So far we’ve helped 15 of them. Jazz is my area (I can’t help everyone). If it’s yours too then please consider donating. 100% of donations goes straight to the clubs. I don’t take a wage for this. Thanks https://lnkd.in/e-EmyUEv\n\nWhy Give to the ICO? Our staff, musicians, and board members tell you why they believe in the work the ICO does in this video. Join other supporters who have already donated this morning here: https://lnkd.in/g4bRjQy3. We need your help to raise $20,000 by midnight tonight! 2023 Events and Programs Made Possible By Donors: 1. The 40th Anniversary Season began with nearly sold-out performances on September 30th and November 18th at Schrott Center for the Arts and will continue through May 2024 with 9 additional concerts (more than previous years). 2. The ICO expanded its Mocktails & Masterpieces video series into a podcast with a goal to offer as much free content to the community as possible. 3. The ICO received registration for nearly 2,000 students to attend its November 16th educational concert, distributed virtual education programs to 4,800 students attending schools in our community with little to no music education opportunities, and completed the first full year of our new after-school program. 4. The ICO presented 3 free parks concerts in September 2023 highlighting community partners. 5. The ICO completed a successful 39th season with Beethoven’s “Fidelio” in May 2023 (our first opera production). #givingtuesday #givingtuesday2023"
