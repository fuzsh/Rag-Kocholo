        "text": "HOBOKEN - ALEX SAAVEDRA doesn't quite cut the figure of a family man. A thin steel lip ring glints at the corner of his mouth and, in a mass of tattoos on his left bicep, an anchor bears the letters \"S.S.N.J.\" (for \"Steam Ship New Jersey\"). He spends long nights in the din of rock clubs. During the formative years of his company, Eyeball Records in Kearny, he lived a few lean months out of an old Chevy Blazer.\n\nYet on a recent Thursday night at Maxwell's here, Mr. Saavedra, 28, cheerfully played the part of rock 'n' roll patriarch. An Eyeball Records band -- the earnest electro-pop outfit New London Fire -- had just left a table near the bar and was preparing to play. The Velocet, a band signed to Eyeball's sister label, Astro Magnetics, had already taken the stage. The front room was crowded with musicians, friends and Mr. Saavedra's professional colleagues: the heads of other independent New Jersey record labels. And who knew there were so many of them?\n\n\"Not to be cultish, because we're not cultish, but we're really family-oriented,\" Mr. Saavedra said of his close-knit scene.\n\nScene it is, and incubator, too. Like Seattle at the turn of the 1990's and Athens, Ga., in the early 1980's, New Jersey has become a hotbed for underground independent-label music.\n\nAnd Mr. Saavedra's point about family was amply illustrated by the crowd around him at Maxwell's, where label owners and music fans talked with the fervor of long-lost kin. Among the familiar faces were Marc Debiak, 27, the primary owner of the Astro Magnetics label, which recently celebrated its first anniversary. Mr. Debiak's two brothers, David and Jason, were among the members of New London Fire who had wandered off to prepare their set.\n\nChatting over beers, Chuck Kinahan, 28, and Derek Meier, 25, proprietors of a Union County label called On the Rise Records, said they had met each other at Roselle Park High School and had watched their first hardcore show together. After Mr. Saavedra flashed his tattoo, Mr. Meier did him one better, rolling up his left sleeve to reveal a stark blue outline of the Garden State and its counties.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
