        "text": "This post is preceded by the following entries about shipping:\n\nHow to Provide “Free” Shipping Worldwide on Kickstarter: A Comprehensive Guide: This entry, written after I shipped Viticulture (June 2013), outlines how to plan ahead for backer fulfillment starting with product design and ending with Amazon multi-channel fulfillment.\n\nKickstarter Lesson #47: This Project Is EU Friendly: This guest entry by andvaranaut discusses the importance of shipping to backers in the EU from within the EU. It includes advaranaut’s “EU-friendly” logo that you’ve since seen posted on hundreds of Kickstarter projects.\n\nLessons Learned: Insights, Mistakes, and Solutions for Offering Worldwide Shipping on Kickstarter: This entry, written after I shipped Euphoria (January 2014), delves deeper into some of the nuances of worldwide reward fulfillment.\n\nI’m not going to rehash the details from those previous posts here, but they’re there for you as a resource. If you’re wondering why it’s better to ship to backers in the EU from within the EU (instead of, say, from the US), please read that second post in the above list.\n\nThat said, a lot has changed in the last 10 months in terms of EU fulfillment options (the same goes for Australia and Asia, which I’ll write about soon in a separate entry). Several companies and services have been created specifically for the purpose of fulfilling Kickstarter orders in the EU.\n\nThe great thing about these companies is that they’re a lot more user friendly than Amazon.co.uk or Amazon.de. Overall I’ve been very pleased with Amazon’s customer service, but it’s the difference between learning this extremely complex, nuanced system (at Amazon) versus exchanging a few e-mails with someone at one of these smaller companies.\n\nI’m always looking out for shipping solutions like these for my fellow creators. So now whenever I hear about a new fulfillment company, I send them a long list of questions. Several companies in the EU have been very kind to indulge this effort, so if you end up contacting one of them, please thank them for agreeing to this.\n\nBefore I link to the spreadsheet, I need to mention a few things:\n\nThe information here is the information given to me. If any of it is inaccurate, please let me know and I will promptly fix it. It is certainly not my intention to mislead or misrepresent–I’m trying to help you.\n\nI was not (nor will I be) paid by any of these companies to share this information. I do have a partnership with Morning Players, the parent company of Ideaspatcher, to produce Euphoria’s second printing, but I have absolutely no stake in Ideaspatcher.\n\nThis list is not complete. I’m sure there are other companies in the EU that provide these types of fulfillment solutions. If you’re one of these companies, please contact me and I’ll send you the questionnaire to add you to this list.\n\nThe countries listed on the bottom half of the spreadsheet are meant to be representative of regions in the EU. Denmark is there to represent Western Europe; Slovenia is there to represent Central Europe, and Norway is there to represent non-EU Europe.\n\nThe currency on the bottom half of the spreadsheet is US dollars based on the conversion rates as of November 7, 2014 (1 Euro = 1.24 US dollars; 1 British pound = 1.58 US dollars). If you’re reading this in the future from your flying car, you’ll need to recalculate.\n\nWhen determining the prices at the bottom, I used the highest number in that range for the calculation. For example, in the 0-.99 kg range, I used .99 kg as the weight for determining the price. If your package weight (product plus packaging) is less than 0.5 kg, you will definitely get a better rate than listed here. On a similar note, the trend appears to be that once you get over 2.2 kg, the price doesn’t really change much for most regions.\n\nThe estimate portion of the spreadsheet is divided into two different sections that have the same numbers, just sorted in two different ways. The highlighted green cells contain the best prices in that row.\n\nThe “expected average” is based on a formula using the percentage breakdown of my Treasure Chest backers by region multiplied by the shipping fee for each region: UK (32%), Germany (27%), France (7%), Western EU (27%), Central EU (3%), non-EU Europe + Croatia (3%)\n\nThe prices listed on the spreadsheet don’t include VAT. You (the creator) still have to pay VAT when the games enter the country in bulk, but you only have to pay VAT on the commercial invoice (the manufacturing cost).\n\nOkay, enough foreplay. Here’s the spreadsheet. It includes pricing estimates for each fulfillment company, though you’ll want to get more precise and updated quotes from them.\n\nIt’s a lot of information, so I’ll do my best to analyze each shipping option below so you can decide what’s best for you. I’ll start with the four newer companies and then finish with Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.de.\n\nSPAINBOX\n\nLocation: Spain\n\nBest at: shipping to Spain\n\nUpside: Spainbox offers predictive delivery with an announcement made to a customers e-mail or cell phone when the shipment is about to be delivered so they can be ready or even change the delivery window in real time.\n\nJamey’s experience: A very solid service that helped me in a pinch when another fulfillment company stopped doing their job. Spainbox was easy to work with, reasonably priced, and offered quality communication, speed, and packaging. My only qualm is that they didn’t always use common sense when shipping certain things, but after a little coaching, they were fine.\n\nSPIRAL GALAXY\n\nLocation: UK\n\nBest at: offering distribution services for retail games in addition to fulfillment\n\nUpside: can pack lots of add-ons without a need for bar codes on each one, can handle freight shipping from the manufacturer to their facility if needed, will act on your behalf for VAT accounting in Europe (you don’t need to register your company in the EU), tracking included for free on 2+ kg orders (customers are e-mailed tracking details on dispatch)\n\nDownside: some additional fees for warehousing & setup\n\nWAYLAND\n\nLocation: UK\n\nBest at: shipping small packages, fastest to process and ship games upon receipt\n\nUpside: great endorsement from Cody Miller of Far Off Games (Xia), very specific shipping fees per country (versus per region for other companies), can pack lots of add-ons without a need for bar codes on each one\n\nDownside: tracking costs extra, can’t freight ship for you or act on your behalf for VAT\n\nSHIPHOPPER\n\nLocation: Great Britain\n\nBest at: shipping to Central Europe (EU)\n\nUpside: comprehensive worldwide solution, especially when manufacturing in China (see more pricing details on a separate Google Doc they sent me)\n\nDownside: $99 monthly fee, shipping rates higher than some of the area-specific solutions listed above, untested by anyone I know\n\nAMAZON.CO.UK\n\nLocation: UK\n\nBest at: shipping to the UK and heavier orders\n\nUpside: backers get notification e-mails with tracking numbers (easy for creators to track too), overall great prices, can seamlessly sell overstock on Amazon’s website after backer fulfillment is complete\n\nDownside: very complex to set up and use, not very flexible, sometimes packaging is inadequate, can’t freight ship for you or act on your behalf for VAT, can’t ship to non-EU Europe or Croatia\n\nBGS Distribution and Fulfillment\n\nLocation: UK\n\nUpside: solid prices across the board, can act as a distributor for retailers across Europe\n\nDownside: doesn’t offer the best price for any particular area, untested by anyone we know\n\nAMAZON.DE\n\nLocation: Germany\n\nBest at: shipping to Germany, Central Europe, and medium-weight packages\n\nUpside: backers get notification e-mails with tracking numbers (easy for creators to track too), overall great prices, can seamlessly sell overstock on Amazon’s website after backer fulfillment is complete\n\nDownside: very complex to set up and use, not very flexible, sometimes packaging is inadequate, can’t freight ship for you or act on your behalf for VAT, can’t ship to non-EU Europe or Croatia, some of the website is in German (though you can switch most of it to English–there’s a language button at the bottom left of the seller central page), hard to get goods into the country (at least with Dimero)\n\n***\n\nA few endnotes:\n\nOTX: There are lots of freight shipping companies out there, but I can’t say enough good things about OTX. They are amazing to work with, very communicative, great rates, and they understand the priority on speed for Kickstarter creators. I specifically work with Justin, who previously managed a lot of freight shipments for us through a different company (jbergeron@bos.otxusa.com).\n\nGreater Than Games: If you are a tabletop game creator looking to get your retail games into distribution after backer fulfillment, I’ve really enjoyed working with Paul at Greater Than Games (paul@greaterthangames.com) for their distribution brokerage service.\n\nQuantity: I’d like to continue to dispel the idea that these solutions are only for big companies with thousands of orders. It’s kind of a self-defeating prophecy: If you don’t offer EU-friendly, cost-effective shipping options on your Kickstarter project, you probably aren’t going to get many backers in the EU.\n\nPricing: Please remember that if you offer “free” shipping anywhere (i.e., to backers in the US), what you’re really doing is building $x into the reward price. So when you determine the shipping fee for other backers, you need to deduct $X from that fee because it’s already built into the reward.\n\nIf there are any questions I can help with, please let me know in the comments below. Otherwise I’d recommend contacting the companies directly as listed on the spreadsheet to get quotes for your specific product."
