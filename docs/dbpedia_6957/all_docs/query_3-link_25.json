Just think of the impact that would have on tills ringing and card readers beeping if they hosted just one or two more live music gigs a week. 💳 💷 📉 Looking at it the opposite way round, 35% of operators surveyed for the Live Music Index said that their revenues would be negatively impacted if they were to stop hosting live music. That’d be a huge blow to venues and artists, who mutually depend on those stages being available on every high street. 😎 We’re on a mission to make it as easy as possible for venues to make better revenues and profit margins by booking, managing and staging live music via our GigPig platform. Reach out to me and the GigPig team if your venue would like to start the journey to a simpler way of organising artist bookings to in turn reap the rewards of improved revenues. #gigs #hospitality #LiveMusicIndex #livemusic\n\nNew Post: The Deals: K-Pop Giant Kakao Signs Licensing Pact With NetEase; Lil Durk Teams With AWAL for Label - https://lnkd.in/dvEUEhar - NetEase Cloud Music struck a licensing agreement with South Korean music company Kakao Entertainment that will allow NetEase to distribute Kakao’s catalog in China. Both companies will work together to jointly promote Korean music in the Chinese market. Kakao artists include Jay Park, Chungha, FTISLAND and CNBLUE.

Related Signed: iann dior Makes a Big Noise, Maddox Batson Pacts With WME 05/14/2024 Music Venue Trust announced the second acquisition by its own Music Venue Properties via the U.K. charity’s Own Our Venues scheme: The Ferret in Preston, a 200-capacity venue that has hosted artists including Ed Sheeran, IDLES, Alt-J and Royal Blood. With the purchase, the venue will be placed in permanent protected status via a “cultural lease” — an agreement designed by Music Venue Properties to guarantee that, as long as The Ferret operates as a space for grassroots live music for the local community, they can use the building. Own Our Venues has raised nearly 2.6 million pounds to date from more than 1,200 individual investors. In October 2023, Music Venue Properties made its first purchase when it acquired The Snug in Atherton, Greater Manchester. An additional seven venues across the country have been identified for purchase in this initial phase.

ASM Global invested\n\nAs the music industry fragments into an ever-growing number of royalty streams from different platforms and use-cases, Mogul ’s pitch is that it will track all of your royalty income in one dashboard and also hunt down artists’ unpaid or unclaimed royalties (previously Mogul has intimated that it has been finding its early users an extra 10% of their earnings on average). It launched in February, and since then, Mogul has announced, it has already tracked $100m in royalties from the artists using the platform. It’s not clear how many artists are using Mogul, but, unless one enormous-earning artist is driving a big chunk of that figure, it seems to be finding an audience. One consequence of all this tracking is that Mogul is also placing a value on an artist’s catalogues, and has entered into partnerships with artist/songwriter advance payment platform beatBread to supply advances.
