It cannot and does not contain information about all medical conditions your pet may have and may not be applicable to your pet’s individual circumstances. The Site and the information on it is not intended to diagnose any condition, illness or injury your pet may have and should not be used as a substitute for the advice of a licensed veterinarian. Virbac cannot be responsible for any injury, illness or death of your pet (including but not limited to costs of veterinary care) resulting from your failure to seek veterinary care or your use of any information on the Site.\n\nAuthorized Users\n\nChildren under the age of 13 may not use this Site, and use of this Site is not intended for use by minors older than 13 without parental consent. If you are not legally an adult in the place in which you reside, you must obtain permission of your parent or guardian before accessing and using the Site.\n\nLimited License\n\nProvided that you accept and comply with these Terms, Virbac grants you a limited license to access and use the Site for your personal use or, as appropriate, authorized business reasons. However, this permission does not include the right to download, reproduce, modify or link to any portion of the Site Content. For purposes of these Terms, “Site Content” means any text, graphics, audio, video, data, interactive features and/or other content published on the Site or any page of the Site.\n\nUnless indicated otherwise, Virbac owns and/or has obtained the right to license all Site Content to you for the uses permitted by these Terms. Site Content is protected by U.S. and foreign law to the fullest extent possible, and any unauthorized use of the Site Content is unlawful under copyright, trademark and other laws.\n\nExcept as expressly permitted under these Terms, you may not store, distribute, display, sell or otherwise exploit the Site Content. You may occasionally print one copy of a page of the Site for personal, non-commercial use, but you may not make multiple copies for distribution to others.\n\nAny violation of these Terms – including unauthorized use of the Site Content – will immediately terminate the license granted to you by Virbac to access and use the Site and may subject you to legal action.\n\nIf you would like to use the Site or the Site Content in a way that exceeds the scope of this license, please contact us for permission.\n\nUser-Submitted Content\n\nThis Site may provide an opportunity for you to submit your own content, including but not limited to feedback, comments, photographs, personal stories, and the like (“User Content”). All of your communications with Virbac through personal accounts or otherwise, as well as any attachments to those communications or otherwise submitted to us (such as documents, photographs and videos) are User Content.\n\nIn order to submit User Content, you may be required to create an account and provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, email address, telephone number, home/business address, and the like. Other means of communication do not require that you create an account. To the extent that you disclose personal information, our use of that information will be governed by our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference.\n\nBy submitting User Content to the Site, you grant Virbac a perpetual, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, distribute, display, modify, create derivative works of, and sublicense the User Content in any way, including but not limited to reposting that User Content on the Site.

Virbac may, in appropriate circumstances and in its sole discretion, terminate the rights of any Site user who infringes the intellectual property rights of Virbac or others.\n\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement or are aware of someone doing so, please contact Virbac and include the following information:\n\na physical or electronic signature of the owner of the copyright or a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner;\n\nidentification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on this Site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);\n\nidentification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate the material on our Site;\n\nyour name, mailing address, telephone number and email address;\n\na statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and\n\na statement by you that the information in your notification is accurate, and that you attest under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or that you are authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.\n\nIf you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Virbac a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices with respect to this Site should be sent to our designated agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement: Legal Department 3200 Meacham Blvd., Fort Worth, Texas 76137 or via facsimile at 817-831-8362.\n\nAccounts & Communication\n\nTo the extent you create an account to access portions of the Site or submit User Content, you will use your account for your internal use only. In creating an account, you may not impersonate someone else, create an account for anyone other than yourself, provide an email address other than your own, or create multiple accounts.\n\nBy disclosing your email address and/or mobile telephone number to create an account, you agree that Virbac may contact you for the purpose of advising you of changes or additions to the Site, about any of Virbac’s products or services, or for such other purpose(s) as Virbac deems appropriate. You may opt out of these communications at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the communication.\n\nYou are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information (i.e., user ID, password and/or challenge questions). You are also responsible for all activities that occur in connection with your account, irrespective of whether you personally engage in such activities.
