        "text": "MVD Entertainment Group and Big Daddy Music Distribution have agreed to merge their operations. The new company, which will use the MVD Entertainment name, will have $15 million in annual revenues. The Big Daddy warehouse will be shuttered and all product will be shipped from the Oaks, Pa.-based MVD 20,000 square-foot facility.\n\nMVD CEO Ed Seaman says the company will be taking in most of Big Daddy’s labels as part of the deal. Those labels include Acetate Records, Cutting Records, Cuneiform, Dancing Ferret, the Laser’s Edge Group, Schoolhouse, Uproar, V12, Cherry Bomb Records, and the C Kunspyruhzy.\n\n“We hope to ship our first Big Daddy records from MVD on April 7,” says Big Daddy founder Burt Goldstein, who will be VP of product management at MVD. While MVD began as a music video one-stop in 1987, it expanded into independent music distribution in 2006. With the Big Daddy labels coming onboard, CDs will now comprise about 20% of the company’s overall revenue.\n\nKenilworth, N.J.-based Big Daddy distributes albums by George Clinton, Nils Lofgren, Robin Trower, Sandra Bernhard, Stylistics, Spyro Gyra, Mushroomhead, Peter Holsapple, GG Allin, Dave Van Ronk, Ronnie Spector, Elliott Murphy, The Hives, Soft Machine, Biohazard, Rachael Sage and The Plasmatics, while the artists that MVD has worked with include Sublime, Pixies, Bad Brains, Devo, The New York Dolls, Iggy Pop, the MC5, Dead Kennedys, Danzig, Marillion, Ween, Shane MacGowan, Stryper, and Johnny Winter."
