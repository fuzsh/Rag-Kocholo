        "text": "Mixposure\n\nNice selection of over 6000 tracks for streaming and download, along with useful reviews. Definitely worth a look!\n\nUnited Bands\n\nLots of free downloads from Indie bands around the world, but mostly in America. Lots of community features, voting, friends, online journal and more.\n\nMP3 Raid\n\nWe're generally not a big fan of this type of advertising heavy site, but in this case we're making an exception, since they do actually serve up a lot of tracks for streaming and some for download. Current material is also on offer, and all of it legal.\n\nSoundowl\n\nSuper minimalist music streaming search engine offers a nice range of legal music for streaming. The tracks are split out into genres which makes it easier to locate stuff you'll enjoy, but the Spartan design may put some people off. The site has partnered with Copyseeker to stop infringing tracks being uploaded.\n\nHealing Piano\n\nAn entire \"virtual album\" of solo piano music from a single artist. Available to all, but presented especially with the intent of being freely distributed to those who are grieving or convalescing...\n\nThe Wired CD\n\nThe November 2004 issue of Wired magazine included a copy of a CD with 16 songs produced under the Creative Commons License. If you did not pick up a newsstand copy of the magazine with the CD featuring artists like: The Beastie Boys, David Byrne (radio), Zap Mama, Gilberto Gil and others... Rip, mix, burn. Swap till you drop. Copyrighted for the 21st century. The music cops can't do a thing - it's 100 percent legal, licensed by the bands.\n\nPlayr\n\nUse these bookmarklets to play web pages of mp3's in your browser or preferred media player. Generated playlists are added to the database, which now contains hundreds of links to pages with music files.['Update': actually this is way cool, check it out! Red]\n\nmutopiaproject.org\n\nFree sheet music for download. Over 300 pieces and growing. A sort of hugely laudable Project Gutenberg for sheet music.\n\nWeed music downloads\n\nWeed music distributor offering large collection of legal music downloads.\n\netree.org\n\nHuge FTP based mailing list for exchanging live concert & show recordings from willing bands. No mp3's, music is downloaded via the 'Shorten' format then has to be converted to WAV before being burned to CD. Includes an extensive wiki with information about how to convert those shorten files and set up the FTP transfers. Slower than downloading mp3's, but within reason with a broadband connection. Very cool if you're into jam sessions and other live stuff from artists like Counting Crows, The Allman Brothers and The Tragically Hip.\n\nsongfight.org\n\nThey post a title, the community writes the song, people download or stream the mp3 tracks and vote for favourites. Quirky, cool and fun. Quality is variable, but better than you might expect.\n\nfivetrees.com\n\nA sort of UK promo, marketing type site, with a 'radio' section which offers free downloads of a small eclectic mix of bands.\n\nClose Your Eyes\n\nA cool list of mp3 blogs, which post links to tracks in various music categories. Well worth a visit if you're starting off. See also Thom:Blog for another selection.\n\nKnobtweakers.net\n\nFree electronic music downloads, daily. Techno, electronica, house, drum n bass, IDM, glitch, trance, breakbeat, hardcore, downtempo, minimal, 2-step, garage, even the occasional chip. All legal.\n\n365 Days Project\n\nThe legendary 365 Days Project, in which an mp3 a day -- of mostly outsider, novelty, and oddball recordings -- was made available for the public to download over the course of 2003. It has been archived in its entirety, complete with images and vast commentary on each selection on UBUWEB.\n\nMr Red Penguin\n\nAmusing blog with various free and hard-to-find indie mp3s.\n\nThe Online Music Business Space\n\nAn excellent, up to date and frozen summary of the major info on this page.\n\nBestmp3links\n\nWeb site listing links to web sites with free legal music and mp3 downloads.\n\niTunes freebie downloads\n\nGreat - i.e. comprehensive and growing - list of free music downloads currently available on the iTunes store. Delivered by the good folk on the MacRumors forums. Good on yer!\n\nPump You Up\n\nA nice little Indie streaming and download service which has a nice selection of tracks focused on dubstep, techno, trance and the rest. Nice simple interface, cool music!\n\nClearbits\n\nSite dedicated to 'Creative Commons-licensed, legally downloadable, freely distributable creator-approved files' distributed via BitTorrent. Lots of music, but also movies and books too."
