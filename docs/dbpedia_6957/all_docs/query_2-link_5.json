        "text": "Day 2 of #saastock was next level ü§Ø Fantastic time with the Paddle team, hanging out with fellow SaaStock Founder Membership (SFM) folks, and having so many conversations about the differences between venture backed and bootstrapped. Love it üòç Some takeaways: - with the cost of capital where it is, #venturebacked start ups have a lot to learn from the #bootstrapping community - #profitablegrowth often times has to come at the expense of speed - #pricing continues to be a major topic, with most wanting to understand how often they should make changes and how high they can drive their price Excited to dig into more of these conversations! Ps: ending the day at the Guinness HQ is not a bad way to wrap up.\n\nIn an inspiring narrative that spans continents, the Modern Milkman, a company deeply rooted in sustainability and reducing plastic waste, has embarked on a remarkable journey of growth and international expansion. üåè This journey is beautifully encapsulated in a video they recently shared that delves into both the company's origins and its ambitious merger with its American counterpart, a family business led by Seth Bahler in Ellington, Connecticut. The union of these two companies is not just a business merger; it's a fusion of shared values and visions for a sustainable future. The story, described as a \"beautiful blend of British charm and the American dream,\" is compellingly narrated by Simon M. the founder and CEO of Modern Milkman. From the company's early days of acquiring its first local milk round to its nationwide expansion in the UK, and the serendipitous discovery of their American twin, this tale is one of innovation, perseverance, and a shared commitment to environmental stewardship. To hear the story firsthand from Simon M. and to gain deeper insights into Modern Milkman's journey towards sustainability and international expansion, watch the enlightening video below! Join us in celebrating the milestones achieved by Modern Milkman and stay tuned for more updates on their continued efforts to reduce plastic waste, promote reusable packaging, and empower consumers to shop ethically! #PlasticWasteReduction #Sustainability #VentureCapital #SustainabilityThroughInnovation #Greentech #CleanTech #VCs\n\nLast weekend, Grace Mittl and I spent 8 hours sampling Absurd Snacks with the RVA community at Ellwood Thompson's Local Market. For those of you who know us, you know we‚Äôre always running around town, so this may sound like a lot of time to be in one place. But we wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. And here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶ - Ellwood Thompson's Local Market was one of the earliest supporters of Absurd Snacks. From day one, they put our snacks on shelf and continue to spread the love throughout Richmond. - When they say ‚Äúlocal market‚Äù, they mean it. Ellwood‚Äôs gives back to our community in more ways than one with their sustainability initiatives, vendor appreciation days, focus on local & better-for-you products, and other fun events. - Partnerships are meant to last & take two to tango. Ellwood‚Äôs has taught us so much about how to manage retailer relationships and what it takes from the brand side to maintain and grow those relationships. We‚Äôll show up to support them any day. üôå - We‚Äôll take any excuse to meet, snack, and chat with YOU. Feedback, feedback, feedback :) Long story short, thank you Ellwood Thompson's Local Market (Jordan, Sarah, Mike & the rest of the team). We ‚ô•Ô∏è you. P.S. Aura Bora your end cap is gorg but pls share the love ü§™ü´∂ #startup #demo #snacks #snackabsurdly #foodandbeverage\n\nDripl has just raised 2.2 million euros! üòé A whole bunch of people are starting to see a different future for the beverage industry üîÆ Latest additions to the crew are our brand new investors Spadel Faraday Venture Partners and Philippe Meert. Great, but what is Dripl again? ü§î Imagine an entire new way of drinking soda: no packages, no water transport and no added sugars. This could already be a reality in your office today. Still don't get it? Check out the video below, where our CEO Colin walks you - quite literally - through it. üö∂‚ôÇÔ∏è #fundinground #growth #startupmarketing #expansion\n\nExciting News! üöÄ After a year of dedicated work, I'm thrilled to announce the launch of two new ventures: Bellbird, a cutting-edge digital agency, and Black Sea, a premium green coffee trading company.
