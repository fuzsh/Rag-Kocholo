The truth is, you’re not.\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll learn how to change the domain name of your WordPress site without having to create a new site. By following along, you'll be able to change the WordPress site URL without losing any data.\n\nI'm using SiteGround for this example, but the steps are similar for other WordPress hosting providers.\n\nI'll start by showing you how to get a new domain name pointing to your site in the SiteGround hosting admin screens, and then I’ll show you the changes you need to make in your site’s admin settings. If you just want to see how to update your WordPress admin settings, you can skip to the next section.\n\nDiscount for WordPress Hosting\n\nIf you're looking for a WordPress hosting provider, check out SiteGround. It comes with an easy installer, free support, and automatic updates. We're happy to be able to offer a discount of 70% off self-managed WordPress hosting, thanks to our partnership with SiteGround.\n\nChanging the Domain Name That Points to Your WordPress Site\n\nThe first step is to get your new domain name pointing to your WordPress site.\n\nThis is easier than you may think; in fact, you can have more than one domain pointing to your site. So if you just need an extra domain name, you only need to follow this step.\n\nNote: Any links to your content using the old domain will take people to your 404 page or your home page. To fix this, you’ll need to set up redirections, which you can do with a plugin or in the SiteGround admin screens.\n\nPointing a Domain Name at Your Site From a Domain Registrar\n\nIf you bought your new domain name from a domain registrar that isn’t also your hosting provider, you’ll need to start by telling the domain registrar that the domain name needs to point to the server that your site is hosted on.\n\nIn SiteGround, you can find information about your server’s address by logging in and then clicking on Websites > Site tools > Dashboard.\n\nScroll down to the Site Information section, where you'll see your IP address and nameservers.\n\nUse the nameserver addresses with your domain registrar to have your domain point to the nameservers your site is using on SiteGround.\n\nNote: If you’re using email provided by your domain registrar, you’ll need to use DNS settings instead. If you’re using a third-party service such as Gmail, you can point your domain to SiteGround’s nameservers and then point your MX records to Gmail.\n\nRegistering a Domain Name With SiteGround\n\nIf you want to register the domain with SiteGround, you need to do this before setting it up as the primary domain.\n\nLog in to your SiteGround account and go to Services > Domains.\n\nClick the New Domain button at the top right to be taken to a screen where you register your new domain name.\n\nType in the domain name you want. If it’s not available, keep trying alternatives until you find an available one that’s suitable. Work through the process of paying for and registering the domain name.\n\nIt will now be displayed in your account if you go to Services > Domains.\n\nChanging Your Site’s Primary Domain With SiteGround\n\nLog in to your SiteGround account and click the Websites option at the top of the screen to go to the website management screen.\n\nFind the website whose primary domain name you want to change, and click on the three dots to the right to reveal the shortcut menu.\n\nSelect the Change Primary Domain option.\n\nIn the next screen, type in the new primary domain. This will not register a new domain for you—you need to have already registered the domain and have it pointing to your nameserver at SiteGround.\n\nThe system will then process your request and give you a success message when that’s done.\n\nAdding SSL to Your Domain\n\nBefore you configure your domain in the WordPress dashboard, it’s a good idea to add SSL to it. This means you’ll be using https:// in front of your domain instead of https://.\n\nSSL will enhance security when people are providing data on your site. It’s essential if visitors are going to be inputting personal details to your site or buying products or services from you. And it has SEO benefits too; Google will rank sites with SSL more highly than those without.\n\nThe good news is that adding SSL to your new domain is free using the Let’s Encrypt service. You can either use a plugin to do it, or if you’re with SiteGround, you can do it via the SiteGround dashboard.\n\nAdding SSL With SiteGround\n\nIn SiteGround, click on the Websites tab and then the Site Tools button for the site you want to change.\n\nIn the admin menu on the left, click on Security > SSL Manager.\n\nIn the Install New SSL box, click the Select Domain dropdown box and select your primary domain. In the Select SSL dropdown, select Let’s Encrypt.\n\nClick the Get button and wait for the system to process your request and create your SSL certificate.\n\nAdding SSL With a Plugin\n\nIf you’re not with SiteGround, you may find that your hosting provider gives you access to Let’s Encrypt using their dashboard or the cPanel software. Check with them to find out if it’s available.\n\nIf not, you can use the SSL Zen plugin to add free SSL to WordPress.\n\nStart by installing the plugin. In your WordPress admin, go to Plugins > Add New. Type SSL Zen into the search box.\n\nClick the Install Now button. Once WordPress has installed the plugin, the button will change to say Activate. Click it again.\n\nYou will be automatically directed to the setup screen. If not, go to SSL Zen in the admin menu. Click the Use free version link at the top to be taken to the admin screen for the free version of the plugin.\n\nYour domain name will be pre-populated. Enter your email address, check the terms and conditions radio button, and click the Next button at the top right of the screen. Continue working through the wizard, including verifying domain ownership. Once you’ve worked through it, you’ll have a free SSL certificate on your website.\n\nTelling WordPress to Use the New Domain\n\nNow that you have your domain configured, you need to ensure WordPress knows what the correct domain is. There are a few ways you can do this:\n\nin the WordPress admin\n\nusing WP-CLI\n\nin phpMyAdmin\n\nLet’s take a look at these in turn.\n\nConfiguring the Domain in the WordPress Dashboard\n\nThe final step is to change the settings for your domain in the WordPress admin screens.\n\nIf you used a plugin to install the certificate, this may have already been done for you—but check first.\n\nDon’t do this until you’re satisfied that the new domain name is pointing at your site. Sometimes it can take up to two days for DNS changes to take effect, so you need to check this is working.\n\nYou can check it by visiting the new domain name in your browser or by using the What’sMyDNS site.\n\nOnce your domain name is resolving correctly, it’s time to change your WordPress settings.\n\nIn your site admin, go to Settings > General.\n\nIn the WordPress URL and the Site URL fields, change the URL to your new domain name. Remember to use https:// if you’ve added SSL to your domain (which I would recommend).\n\nNow scroll down and click the Save Changes button. Your site will now resolve to the new domain name.\n\nOnce you’ve done that, you might find that you still have links in your posts that use the old domain name and URL. You need to replace these with links using the new URLs.\n\nUse the Better Search Replace plugin to do this, replacing the old domain with the new domain throughout your site.\n\nConfiguring the Domain Using WP-CLI\n\nIf you’re using WP-CLI to manage your site instead of the WordPress admin, you can set up the new domain at the command line.\n\nStart by connecting to your server using SSH in the way you normally do. Then make a backup of your database before you make the changes, with this command:\n\nThis command will create a backup of your database into an SQL file. Once you’ve done that, type this command:\n\nReplace olddomain.com and newdomain.com with your old and new domains in the command above. This will find all instances of the old domain in your database and replace them with the new domain.\n\nOnce you’ve done this, you need to flush your website’s cache with this command:\n\nAnd that’s it. Your site will now work with the new domain name.\n\nConfiguring the Domain in phpMyAdmin\n\nThe final option is to use phpMyAdmin to configure the new domain name with your site. Before you do this, take a backup of your database using the SiteGround backup tool (Site Tools > Security > Backups) or with your backup plugin.\n\nIn the SiteGround dashboard, go to Site Tools > Site > SQL. Click the phpMyAdmin tab on the screen.\n\nClick the Access phpMyAdmin button to open phpMyAdmin.\n\nClick the Databases tab and select the database for your site. Click on the wp_options table (or the xx_options table if your tables have a different prefix where xx is the prefix, as they will if you used the SiteGround WordPress auto-installer).\n\nIn the option_name column, find the siteurl and home fields.\n\nFor each of them, click the Edit link and then replace the existing domain name with the new domain name. Click Go to save your changes.\n\nExit phpMyAdmin and clear your browser cache, and then check your site on the new domain. It should be working.\n\nNote: If there are links in your posts that use the old domain name, you’ll need to replace those in the database. Use the Better Search Replace plugin to do this.\n\nYour site will now work with the new domain!\n\nSummary\n\nChanging the domain name of your WordPress site does involve a few steps, but it is something you can do.\n\nFollow the guide above to point your new domain at your server and then configure WordPress to use the new domain, and then your site will function on the new domain as if it had always been there.\n\nThe Best WordPress Themes and Plugins on Envato Market\n\nExplore thousands of the best WordPress themes ever created on ThemeForest and leading WordPress plugins on CodeCanyon.
