        "text": "Tooltester is supported by readers like yourself. We may earn an affiliate commission when you purchase through our links, which enables us to offer our research for free.\n\nI don’t know about you, but as I get older I find that time is the most important asset I need to manage and optimize. At the end of the day, being productive is crucial for the success of any business.\n\nI don’t even want to think about the hours I’ve wasted trying to contact hosting providers’ support, updating my plugins or fixing mistakes for WordPress sites – way too many.\n\nA good WordPress hosting provider can help you here, as smart hosts will make your life much easier. And you are probably wondering: Is SiteGround good for WordPress sites?\n\nAt Tooltester.com we think that SiteGround is one of the best affordable web hosting providers out there, and it’s an especially good choice if you’re looking to host WordPress sites on a budget.\n\nSiteGround is recommended by Yoast\n\nHowever, we are not the only ones; popular WordPress-related organizations like Yoast, WooCommerce and WordPress itself recommend SiteGround’s hosting services.\n\nBut, of course, you should not use SiteGround as your host just because a bunch of large companies (or us) endorse it.\n\nSo let me tell you what to expect from SiteGround when you host a WordPress site with them, and when to use it.\n\nPros and Cons of SiteGround for WordPress\n\nLet’s summarize the main pros and cons of SiteGround:\n\nPros\n\nCons\n\nWho is SiteGround for?\n\nBefore I dive deep into SiteGround’s prices, features, support and performance, let me quickly tell you in what scenarios I would suggest considering it as your host:\n\nIf you are looking to host an online store (e.g. using WordPress + WooCommerce)\n\nProfessional bloggers with medium to big sites\n\nCompanies using WordPress for their website\n\nDevelopers and users that need cutting edge features (Git or staging areas) for WordPress\n\nOrganizations that need to give access to several users (e.g. collaborators and clients).\n\nIn general, anyone that needs a well-performing host\n\nHowever, there are a couple of cases in which you should probably not use SiteGround:\n\nYour budget is very limited – check out DreamHost or other cheap WordPress hosting options.\n\nYou need loads of storage (e.g. more than 50 GB)\n\nThose looking for a Windows-based hosting provider (check out A2 Hosting or InMotion)\n\nSiteGround Plans & Pricing\n\nBut before jumping on board with SiteGround, you’ll have to make sure that its prices match your allocated budget. I will also check all the available plans and check their fees.\n\nSiteGround Shared Hosting for WordPress\n\nSiteGround has 3 shared hosting plans, all of which will allow you to host your WordPress site. But let’s check out the prices and what each tier offers.\n\nThe StartUp plan is ideal if you have a single (smallish) WordPress site and don’t need advanced features like staging areas or Git repositories. Additionally, your storage will be limited to 10 GB. This plans comes with static and dynamic content caching.\n\nWhen purchasing the GrowBig package, you’ll have more storage (20 GB). With this plan it’s possible to host unlimited WordPress websites. On top of that, you’ll gain access to a WordPress staging system and Ultrafast PHP enabled (for faster websites).\n\nThe GoGeek tier is ideal for larger WordPress users that need even more storage (40 GB). It’s possible to host unlimited websites. Additionally, it provides interesting perks such as pre-installed Git repositories and a white-label backend (e.g. you want to give access to your clients).\n\nSiteGround Cloud Hosting for WordPress\n\nFor all I know your website may be performing extremely well, meaning that you need an even more powerful solution (e.g. you get over 100,000 visitors per month). If that’s the case, SiteGround Cloud Hosting could be exactly what you are looking for.\n\nSiteGround offers 4 pre-made plans for cloud hosting services (storage and processing power differs). However, as you can see in the above image, you can configure your server to meet your exact needs. Its Cloud Hosting plans start at $80.00 a month and go all the way up to $2,100.\n\nSiteGround Features for WordPress\n\nBut let me mention some interesting (hosting) WordPress features that SiteGround has to offer WordPress site owners.\n\nMigration\n\nThey have an amazing plugin that will help you migrate your WordPress website in a matter of minutes. It’s a very easy-to-use solution that will only require you to add a plugin to the migrated website.\n\nSiteGround WordPress migration interface\n\nUnfortunately, the migration plugin won’t work if your WordPress site (database) is really big. I’ve migrated 3 websites using its plugin without any issues – one of them is pretty big and gets about 50,000 visitors. However, I did have an issue with a fourth site – support helped me with the migration though, this can have added costs.\n\n1-Click installations\n\nAs pretty much every other hosting provider, SiteGround offers an easy way to install WordPress. You can see the whole process in the video below:\n\nOne perk of its WordPress installation script is that you can actually host your website on a free temporary URL provided by SiteGround. This means that you can create a WordPress installation without having a proper domain for it, great if you just want to test things out.\n\nSiteGround add-on suggestion for installations\n\nWP Starter Plugin\n\nI have to confess to you that I haven’t used the starter plugin on an active website, though it sounds like a useful guide for beginners. For the purposes of this article, I did look into it extensively so I can explain to you what to expect from it.\n\nIf you end up using this starter plugin, you’ll follow the following workflow:\n\nChoose one of the SiteGround theme suggestions for WordPress. Most of them are free.\n\nDecide if any of the free suggested plugins (e.g. WooCommerce, JetPack or WPForms) are relevant for your WordPress project. No worries, you’ll be able to add or remove them later on if needed.\n\nSiteGround offers 3 more plugins that will help you optimize and measure your traffic. Not all of these are free.\n\nClick on complete to add all these to your WordPress website.\n\nAnd of course, none of these are mandatory. So, if instead of using the plugins or themes suggested by SiteGround you’d like to use different ones, you will be allowed.\n\nSG Optimizer Plugin\n\nI think this is the most useful WordPress feature that SiteGround offers. Once the plugin is installed, you’ll be able to enable a dozen optimizations for your website easily.\n\nIt is a really effective way to speed up your WordPress site and a good reason to consider using SiteGround as your WordPress host.\n\nSG Optimizer plugin interface\n\nLet me give you a tour of it:\n\nOn the first tab ‘SuperCacher Settings’), you’ll be able to configure how the caching should work on your WordPress site. For example, exclude pages from being cached (e.g. shopping cart), decide when to purge your cache or what caching levels to enable.\n\nFrom the ‘Environment Optimization’ section, the PHP version, SSL activation, browser caching and GZIP compression can be managed.\n\nThe ‘Frontend Optimization’ will allow you to speed up your website by minifying your HTML, JavaScript and CSS, and optimize where scripts load (e.g. the footer).\n\nA neat added bonus is the available media optimizations. This plugin will compress and optimize your images and let you lazy-load images and videos.\n\nSince SiteGround launched this plugin, I’ve been using it. I was able to get rid of several other plugins I used to achieve the same.\n\nWordPress & Plugins Auto-Update\n\nSome time in 2013 WordPress released a feature which meant that you could set your installation to auto-update. This can save you a fair bit of time whenever there’s a new WordPress system release (update).\n\nSiteGround WordPress updates manager\n\nSiteGround has gone one step further and gives you a couple of options to handle updates. It’s pretty cool that they let you choose between ‘major’ and ‘minor’ updates and give you so much flexibility: do the updates as soon as they are available, wait 24 hours, 48 hours or 72 hours.\n\nOn top of that, SiteGround will also manage plugin updates automatically, if that’s what you want. But please, be aware that if there is a plugin conflict, your site could break – that’s why we manage plugin updates manually.\n\nWordPress Staging Areas\n\nFinally, another one of my favorite WordPress features are the 1-click staging areas to test code before pushing it live. You can understand this as an exact replica of your site so you can see how new code (or plugin update) will affect your WordPress site without breaking the live site.\n\nYou only have to name your staging area and click the ‘Create’ button (see image above). Your staging will be available in a couple of seconds.\n\nSiteGround staging areas for WordPress\n\nAnother useful feature is that you’ll be able to replace your live website with the staging copy you created (make sure your site is properly backed up beforehand). Sadly there doesn’t seem to be an option to password protect your staging’s frontend, that would be desirable as you probably don’t want people (or search engines) finding it.\n\nSiteGround & WooCommerce\n\nThis is nothing extraordinary, but you can purchase a WooCommerce SiteGround plan that comes with WordPress + WooCommerce pre-installed. It’s also possible to migrate (import) your elsewhere hosted WooCommerce site.\n\nSiteGround WordPress Performance\n\nOf course, you want your website to load lightning fast and with as few interruptions as possible, regardless of what CMS you use (WordPress or any other).\n\nUptime\n\nBelieve it or not, your hosting provider will have a hard time to guarantee that your site will be available (online) 100% of the time. For instance, sometimes there are maintenance tasks that will cause downtime.\n\nBut, of course, you want your downtime to be as little as possible. Here is where good hosting providers can shine compared to mediocre or bad hosts.\n\nIn this years web host reliability tests, SiteGround got a perfect 100% uptime score:\n\nAnd as you can see below, SiteGround always provides an extraordinarily good uptime, being way over the 99.95% standard mark in every year we’ve been running our tests:\n\n2020 2021 2022 Uptime % SiteGround 99.97 100 100 WP Engine 99.99 99.99 100 Namecheap – 100 100 Kinsta 100 100 100 InMotion 99.73 99.95 100 A2 Hosting 99.99 99.98 99.99 Cloudways 100 100 99.99 HostGator 99.91 99.99 99.98 GreenGeeks 99.98 99.98 99.97 GoDaddy 99.90 99.96 99.95 Hostinger 99.48 99.92 99.95 Bluehost 99.96 99.99 99.95 iPage 98.45 99.85 99.95 Dreamhost 99.99 99.96 99.83 IONOS – 99.93 99.71\n\nIn fact, I’ve used SiteGround for several years now, and I’ve never seen them drop below 99.97%, so I am very happy with its uptime.\n\nSpeed\n\nWebsite loading times can have a huge influence on the success or failure of a website. So it’s nice to see that SiteGround gets things right when talking about speed.\n\nIn our latest tests to find the fastest web hosting, SitGround came 5th with an average page load time of 1.56 seconds:\n\nAnd it has performed well in every year we’ve been testing web host speed:\n\n2020 2021 2022 Page Load Time in Seconds GreenGeeks 2.39 1.56 1.29 A2 Hosting 3.15 2.01 1.30 GoDaddy 3.40 1.94 1.44 Cloudways 2.32 1.73 1.46 SiteGround 2.14 1.54 1.56 Hostinger 4.19 1.61 1.63 WP Engine 2.21 1.65 1.66 Namecheap – 1.60 1.69 Dreamhost 3.28 1.84 1.75 Kinsta 2.98 1.77 1.82 Bluehost 3.07 2.87 2.07 IONOS – 1.95 2.32 InMotion 4.36 2.75 2.58 iPage 4.19 2.76 2.60 HostGator 3.77 2.78 2.72\n\nLoading Speed & SiteGround\n\nBesides the super-useful WordPress SG Optimizer plugin that I’ve talked in-detail earlier, there a couple of general things that SiteGround implements to enhance speed:\n\nLike some of its competitors, SiteGround uses SSD drives for all its servers – SSD can be 4 times faster than regular hard-drives.\n\nAll SiteGround clients can use the latest PHP version for their hosting account. Besides being more secure, it also performs better.\n\nAnother neat option is being able to host your website in several locations, pick a server in the US, Europe or Asia. Hosting your website near your audience (e.g. not in the US if you target Europe), should give you a speed boost.\n\nSiteGround integrates with the Cloudflare CDN that will help you distribute your site more efficiently world-wide. Cloudflare even has a free plan.\n\nOther Useful Features, Unique to SiteGround\n\nSiteGround has many features that other hosting providers offer too. However, there are a couple of unique options that make SiteGround a bit more special. Let me tell you about them:\n\nOn-demand backups: With SiteGround’s system, you’ll be able to create your own backups (e.g. before pushing some new code), and restore if things went wrong. Many hosts will sell you a pricey add-on to have this advanced backup functionality. SiteGround offers this in its GrowBig tier.\n\nGit: The highest SiteGround plan comes with this version control technology pre-installed. Developers use it to record changes and avoid code conflicts when more than one programmer is working on a project.\n\nUser-management: If you opt for the GrowBig (or higher) plan, you’ll be able to create users for your hosting account and assign them roles and projects – pretty useful if you have a team managing a website. With the GoGeek plan, you can also add clients and the SiteGround branding will disappear.\n\nSuccessful WordPress sites hosted with SiteGround\n\nI wanted to share a couple of examples of (really big) WordPress websites hosted with SiteGround.\n\nYoast\n\nThis company creates SEO plugins for WordPress, and it is pretty successful with more than 5 million active WordPress installations. It not only endorses SiteGround as a WordPress host, but it uses it to host its website too.\n\nIts website is huge, and built with WordPress. Ahrefs estimates that they have around 400,000 visitors a month.\n\nSprouts\n\nThis US healthy supermarket chain has over 340 stores in 22 different (US) states and employs over 30,000 people. According to Ahrefs, its (WordPress-based) website receives over 500K visitors a month.\n\nJ.K. Rowling\n\nMaybe J.K. Rowling’s website isn’t the biggest website around – it only gets around 200K visitors a month, according to Ahrefs – but it’s definitely a magical one. Her website is also built with WordPress and hosted on SiteGroud.\n\nSiteGround Support\n\nOne thing I really dislike is waiting; I don’t like it when the bus is late or when I have to wait too long for a meal. Equally, having to wait for a (hosting) support agent to be free when I am having an issue really frustrates me.\n\nI suppose this is the same for you?\n\nGenerally speaking, SiteGround’s support is fast, sometimes I had to wait slightly longer though. I’ve reached out to them over 100 times and I have to say that the quality of the help has been (almost always) good and my issues were fixed.\n\nSiteGround Support Center\n\nBe aware that they can be reached by their ticket system (similar to email), live chat or phone. Personally, I prefer the chat support as I can talk live with an agent without having to stop everything I am doing.\n\nSiteGround WordPress Review: Final Thoughts\n\nNow you should have a pretty good idea of what to expect from SiteGround when hosting a WordPress site.\n\nYou won’t find many shared hosting providers for WordPress that outperform SiteGround, especially at this cost (starts at 15,99€ after renewal). But as I mentioned, you will need to set aside a fair bit of your budget, as it isn’t the most affordable solution – check out DreamHost if you need a cheaper option.\n\nGenerally speaking, it’s safe to go with them, especially if you have a large project and you need some advanced features to help you with the daily upkeep (e.g. updating plugins).\n\nIt’s also good when working with several team members or clients; being able to create users and assign roles and individual projects to users will streamline your workflow process enormously.\n\n> Try SiteGround risk-free for 30 days"
