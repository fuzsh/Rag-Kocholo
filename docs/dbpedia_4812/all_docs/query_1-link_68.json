However, after the transfer, it has created a temporary site and asks me to do something with name servers. I do not understand this point as both domains are registered with site ground so no DNS change is required?\n\nHello @andyscotuk,\n\nIn case, you are transferring your site to a domain that is already pointing to SiteGround, you do not need to make changes to the DNS settings after the transfer.\n\nHowever, if you have any doubts, please feel free to submit a support ticket in your Client Area at Siteground and we will be glad to clarify the situation for you.\n\nRegards,\n\nVladimir"
