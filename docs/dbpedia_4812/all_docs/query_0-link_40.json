Most domain name registrars by default set the status of the domain names to “Locked“, so you need to unlock the domain name first from the control panel of the current registrar.\n\nThere must be more than15 days until the expiration of the domain name.\n\nThe domain name must have beeninitially registered more than 60 days ago\n\nYou must have theEPP code for the domain name. This is used during the transfer to authorize the operation and you can obtain it from the current domain name registrar.\n\nThe requirements are applicable to the gTLDs (.com, .org, .net, .biz, .info). Most of the ccTLDs (country code top-level domains) have their own set of requirements. If you are looking to transfer a .co.uk domain name, you can refer to this dedicated article.\n\nIf your domain name meets all of the above criteria, you can order the Domain Transfer service from your Client Area >Services >Domains > Transfer. Click on Check Status. Our system will automatically check if your domain name meets all of the above criteria and if it does not you will see a warning.\n\nIf your domain name passes all of the checks, then you will have to input the EPP code and check if you have access to your account administrative email address. You will also be prompted to review and update the domain name owner details if necessary. Once the domain name transfer is completed, these details will be automatically applied to your domain name.\n\nIf the EPP key you provided was correct, then the transfer will immediately be initiated and you will be notified when it is completed.\n\nIf the EPP was incorrect, you will receive an email on the account’s administrative email address that should be used to confirm the domain transfer. You have to follow the instructions. You may receive a second email from your current registrar asking you to confirm the transfer again."
