        "text": "In this post, I’ll teach you how to point your NameCheap Domain to SiteGround. All you need to do is update your DNS NameServers (NS) in your NameCheap control panel so they point to your new SiteGround hosting account. It’s super simple!\n\nIf you decided on an alternate domain registrar or hosting service the steps will be similar but please check with your provider for specific instructions.\n\nAmazing WordPress Recommendations\n\nStep 1: Locate your SiteGround NameServer records\n\nTo locate your SiteGround NameServer records you will need to go to sign-in to your SiteGround User Area. Click My Accounts tab then below that, Information & Settings tab. From here you will see Account DNS.\n\nAlternatively, they may have included your NameServers in the email they sent you when you joined. Look for an email titled Important Information about Your New Hosting Account. They look something similar to this.\n\nNS1: ns1.m16.siteground.biz\n\nNS2: ns2.m16.siteground.biz\n\nStep 2: Update your NameCheap NameServers\n\nFirst, sign-in to your NameCheap account. Hover over your account name, top left, and select Dashboard. You should see a list of your domains. Select Manage next to the domain you want to update. Look for the section that says NAMESERVERS.\n\nCurrently, it probably says “Namecheap BasicDNS. Select the dropdown arrow and select “Custom DNS”.\n\nSimply enter the two NameServer Records you found in step 1 into the appropriate fields, Nameserver 1 and Nameserver2. Hit the Green Checkmarks to save.\n\nNote: In the email, they are in brackets or have numbers after them. Only enter the part that looks like this: ns1.m16.siteground.biz\n\nThat’s it! You’re done.\n\nPlease be aware: NameServer changes do not propagate instantly. It may take up to 24 hours for local ISPs to update their DNS caches so that everyone can see your website. From my experience, changes usually only take a couple of hours or less to update.\n\nYou can check your NameServers anytime by going here: https://dnschecker.org/ns-lookup.php\n\nSimply enter the domain to see what NameServers are currently being used.\n\nGet inspired and start a blog with up to 99% off at Namecheap!\n\nDid this help you Point a NameCheap Domain to SiteGround Hosting?\n\nTell us about your experience in the comments below.
