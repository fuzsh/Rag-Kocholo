        "text": "Step #2: Complete the DMARC Setup\n\n1. In your DNS Settings, look for the option to review the list of records already added. If you see a DMARC TXT record already added, congratulations! You're done. You can check to make sure 360MatchPro has correctly identified your DMARC record by checking the \"TXT\" row in 360MatchPro's \"Email Customization - Sending\" tab:\n\nIf you do not see a TXT record in the list, move on to step 2 below.\n\n2. Within the DNS Zone Editor of your SiteGround account, choose TXT.\n\n3. In the DNS Setup Table in 360MatchPro, there is 1 TXT record. Copy the value from the Hostname column, switch to the browser tab containing your DNS settings, and paste it into the Name field.\n\n4. Switch back to your 360MatchPro browser tab. For the same TXT record, copy the value in the Value Should Be column. Back in your DNS browser window, paste the value into the Value field.\n\nPlease note: The sample value provided for your DMARC TXT record is very simple. Your IT team may want to modify it slightly. This value is sufficient for sending matching gift emails through 360MatchPro.\n\n5. Save your changes.\n\nTroubleshooting CNAME records\n\nIf your DNS records still need to be set up or are still being processed, you'll see each record with a CNAME Not Found error displayed for one or all of them. Please check back 24-48 hours later to see if the changes have propagated. If you still see the CNAME Not Found error, please refer to the troubleshooting tips below."
