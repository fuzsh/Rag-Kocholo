        "text": "Are you struggling to make a decision between SiteGround vs. Bluehost? Both web hosting providers are well-known and have their own unique perks.\n\nIn our review of SiteGround vs. Bluehost, we compare how the top options measure up based on user reviews, customer service, additional features and offerings, pricing, and range of hosting options. Read on to learn more about these popular services and find out which one is best for your needs.\n\nBluehost vs. SiteGround: At a Glance\n\nSiteGround and Bluehost are both powerhouses within the web hosting industry. Bluehost is known for working well with WordPress and touts a user-friendly interface for newbies to web hosting. While SiteGround is also a web host that is recommended by WordPress, it’s more known for its speed and customer support than for being beginner-friendly.\n\nHow These Web Hosting Services Stack Up\n\nBluehost is a reliable web hosting option that’s easy to use but falls short in nearly every category of our comparison chart. Bluehost has all of the basics you’d expect from a web host at an affordable price. SiteGround, on the other hand, takes it just one step further in each category.\n\nFor example, SiteGround offers a free website migration plug-in to make moving websites easier while Bluehost only offers a paid professional service. While Bluehost offers free secure socket layers (SSLs) and spam protection, SiteGround offers a whole suite of security protections.\n\nBluehost vs. SiteGround: Which One Is Better?\n\nWhen you stack up all the features and categories of each web host, SiteGround is an attractive option—particularly when it comes to speed, security and customer support. There are also more features available that may attract the more advanced user.\n\nBut, with more features comes a greater price tag. New customers are introduced at a promotional rate and will auto-renew at the regular rate. Bluehost’s most basic plan is $9.99 per month after introductory pricing while SiteGround’s most basic plan is more expensive at $7.99 per month.\n\nThe more expensive price tag is justified when you see that SiteGround offers more and outperforms in multiple areas of web hosting.\n\nWhen To Pick Bluehost\n\nIf your business doesn’t sell products or services online or anticipate a lot of web traffic, you may be better off choosing Bluehost. Although their speed and security aren’t as robust, those categories do not matter as much if your website will be purely informational or if you’re just testing out the waters.\n\nAnother reason you may choose Bluehost is if your business has very high website storage requirements. Bluehost offers unlimited storage on most of their plans, while SiteGround caps out at 40 GB.\n\nWhen To Pick SiteGround\n\nIn business, web page load time matters. Having a speedy website provides a better customer experience, especially when shopping for products or services. Having a higher web page load time can also help improve your website’s search engine optimization (SEO) rank.\n\nSiteGround offers more security features that businesses are likely to appreciate—like extra security protections and automatic daily backups. Having stellar customer support available also makes SiteGround a less intimidating choice for people new to building, migrating or managing a website. Great customer support can make all the difference.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAlthough Bluehost is well-known for being the beginner-friendly choice, SiteGround offers an intuitive dashboard with helpful tips and a top-tier customer support team. If you’re new to web hosting, you should still fare well with SiteGround. Ultimately, the right fit for you will come down to your budget as well as what features you need in your hosting service."
