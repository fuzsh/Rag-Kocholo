        "text": "Hi, like many others have reported, I am experiencing a front-end conflict on my staging website. I’ve tried many of the solutions suggested, but none have been fruitful.\n\nI contacted Siteground, but when trying to replicate the issue, they only encountered the endlessly spinning cornerstone logo. Siteground said there are no blocks from mod_security.\n\nCan you help with this?\n\nAttaching login info in a reply.\n\nHi There,\n\nThanks for writing in! Upon checking, your basic server configurations and settings seems to be alright.\n\nPHP v5.6.31 MySQL v5.6.36 PHP Memory Limit 768.0 MiB PHP Max Script Execute Time 120s\n\nFirst of all, please try purging your all server cache and then try disabling your caching plugin. I also see that you have many 3rd party plugins especially for Cornerstone. Try disabling them as well.\n\nYou need to validate your site as well (https://theme.co/apex/forum/t/setup-product-validation/55)\n\nLet us know how it goes.\n\nThanks!\n\nI completed all of the suggested and still experiencing a conflict on the staging site only.\n\nHello There,\n\nThanks for updating in! With SiteGround staging, the issue is with the Site URL setting in your staging area.\n\nCornerstone is using the Site URL and WordPress Address URL settings in Settings > General. In SiteGround, you are not allowed to change this. Perhaps you can resolve this by manually editing the wp-config.php file of the staging area and add this:\n\ndefine('WP_HOME','http://example.com'); define('WP_SITEURL','http://example.com');\n\nPlease let us know how it goes.\n\nHi RueNel,\n\nHad the same issue and tried your solution. Same result. Conflict on the frontend of the site.\n\nHi @RMnisperos\n\nSiteground hosting mod_security rules could preventing the content builder from working correctly. You’ll need to contact Siteground to get them to exclude all X assets from the mod_security ruleset.\n\nIf that does not help, would you mind providing us with login credentials so we can take a closer look? Please provide following information:\n\nSet it as Secure Note\n\nLink to your site\n\nWordPress Admin username / password\n\nFTP credentials\n\nAll the best!\n\n@RMnisperos were you able to resolve the conflict issue with Cornerstone on SiteGround staging? FYI, I am having the same or similar issue. I am able to edit in Cornerstone if I update wp-config.php to direct WP_HOME and WP_SITEURL to the staging site subdomain, but then I cannot access the staging site itself (I get “too many redirects” error even after clearing browser cache). So i suppose one workaround would be to install the augmented wp-config file before you edit via Cornerstone, and then change wp-config back to its original state when you want to access the site itself. Please let me know if you have found a better solution. Thx.\n\nI decided to spend my time editing the live site instead. Couldn’t figure it out.\n\n@metamedia\n\nUpon investigating this issue further, I see the following error when loading your site (https://snag.gy/lYRn8G.jpg). You may try following this guide (https://theme.co/apex/forum/t/cornerstone-content-builder-migration/126) and replace your Live Site URLs with your staging URL.\n\nIf that does not help, you will need to follow our migration guide and setup a staging server again using your live site copy.\n\nThanks!"
