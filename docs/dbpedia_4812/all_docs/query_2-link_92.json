No plugins needed!\n\nManaged security: We proactively scan and block malware and hacking attempts. We do all of this at the server level, without the need for any plugins or configuration on the part of the customer. And in the unlikely event that your site is hacked, we’ll fix it for you, free of charge.\n\nManaged software updates: We’ll work with you to make sure your site is always running the latest and greatest WordPress software.\n\nExpert WordPress support: Our team of WordPress experts goes above and beyond what nearly any other managed hosting company will help out with. From “hey, I need help, I have a serious problem!“, to “can you recommend a plugin for XYZ,” we’re here to help.\n\nThose are the core pieces of what it means to be a true managed WordPress hosting provider. If you have any questions, let us know!\n\nThere are a number of things that make Flywheel stand out from other companies in the WordPress hosting industry. Here’s a nice, long list:\n\nWe ONLY host WordPress sites. We specialize in WordPress and it’s all we do, day in and day out. Our servers are tuned for WordPress, our support team is staffed with WordPress experts, and our resources are all WordPress-oriented.\n\nFree migrations, free SSL, free demo sites, free malware cleanup. Your Flywheel plan comes with a bunch of brilliant perks for the low, low price of zero cents.\n\nOur plans start at just $13. Most managed WordPress hosts start at much more than that!\n\nWe have a TON of workflow tools for agencies, designers, and developers. Flywheel is so much more than a hosting company. From billing transfer to collaboration tools, we have a suite of fantastic features that are designed to make your clients happier and your life easier.\n\nDedicated resources. You aren’t sharing your server space with anyone else, leading to better performance and security.\n\n99.9% uptime. It really, truly can’t get much better than that!\n\nSupport. Our team is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week via live chat. They’re all experts in the industry, so they can help with everything from an odd error to a recommendation for a plugin.\n\nA custom control panel. Instead of relying on clunky cPanel, we built our own beautiful, intuitive dashboard.\n\nNeed more? Check out our reviews section for a few extra reasons why agencies and creatives have chosen to host with us!\n\nAbsolutely!\n\nWe know how painful it can be to move a WordPress site from one server to another, and that’s why we help our customers move their sites – FOR FREE. Whether you’re moving 1 or 100 sites, our migration team will move your site(s) as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\nCheck out our migrations page for more details or simply fill out our secure migration request form with some details about your previous hosting account, and we’ll get your site transferred and set up as a demo site under your account. You can then review it to see how everything performs, and make sure everything is in place!"
