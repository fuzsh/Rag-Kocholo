The good one also rename all URL's in your database to ones of your new hosting.\n\nI suppose the easiest one is Akeeba backup for Wordpress Akeeba Backup for WordPress\n\ndownload the plugin, install it in your Wordpress and activate it\n\nIn your Wordpress menu you will have Akeeba backup entry click it and create new backup (for bigger websites I recommend split the backup file into smaller parts in plugin settings)\n\nupload all parts of your newly created backup (you will find it in wp-content/plugins/akeebabackupwp/app/backups/) into the new server root through FTP\n\ndownload Akeeba Kickstart Kickstart (Standalone) (this files will uncompress your backup on the server) so copy both files in downloaded zip into server root\n\nvisit in your browser your new hosting domain and add /kickstart.php (example.com/kickstart.php) follow onscreen instruction to complete recovery\n\nin case you are stuck here documentation for Akeeba Backup Akeeba Backup for WordPress"
