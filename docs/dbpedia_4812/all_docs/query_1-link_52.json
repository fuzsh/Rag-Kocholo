I went to create the verification TXT record and all went fine.\n\nThe issue is with the NS records: in SiteGround there isn’t the option to create them in the DNS editor. I then contacted SiteGround help centre that told me that NameServer records cannot be edited unless I’m moving my hosting somewhere else, nor it is possible to edit them on a subdomain level. They ended up referring me to Klaviyo for alternative solutions.\n\nAfter looking further into the documentation, I opted for the static routing because it doesn’t require NS records, and it is working fine.\n\nHowever, I’d be inclined to prefer the dynamic routing (mainly because suggested by Klaviyo itself).\n\nI even tried to create CNAME record with the NS parameters, but obviously to no avail.\n\nIs there anyone with an idea on how to work this round?\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestion!"
