Once there, go to your Client Area → Websites → Site Tools.\n\nYou'll find the necessary nameservers in the Site Information section.\n\nCopy the given nameservers, and specify them in your domain's DNS zone.\n\nNOTE\n\nAlternatively, you can point your domain to SiteGround via A record: you can copy it from the Site Information → Website IP.\n\nOnce you have the required IP address, create an A record in your domain’s DNS zone.\n\nAfter you add a new A record, DNS propagation will start. This process can take up to 24 hours. During this time, it's expected that your website won't work, but give it some time, and it will get online soon.\n\nThat’s it! Now you know two ways of pointing your domain to SiteGround."
