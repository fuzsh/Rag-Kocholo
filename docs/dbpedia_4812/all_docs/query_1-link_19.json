        "text": "Do you want to know if you should buy a domain and hosting plan from SiteGround?\n\nSiteGround is a leading web host and is officially recommended by WordPress.org. In this guide, we’ll take a look at everything SiteGround has to offer and also compare them to other popular web hosts so that you can make the right choice.\n\nLet’s get started.\n\nOverview of SiteGround\n\nSiteGround is one of the most popular web hosts in the world and they’re well known for their superior site experience. They have data centers across the globe, so your site will be optimized for speed and performance no matter where you are.\n\nApart from their hosting service, they also provide SSL, daily backups, caching, Cloudflare CDN, and email service.\n\nComing to customer support, they are available around the clock. Depending on your plan, you can also get priority support where you only need to wait a few seconds to connect with the support staff.\n\nNow SiteGround is a top hosting provider but their plans are a bit expensive. If you’re just getting started, you may find even their basic plan out of budget.\n\nWith that said, let’s first take a look at what SiteGround has to offer then we’ll discuss their pricing plans and the best deals you can get.\n\nSiteGround Highlights\n\nSiteGround has a feature-rich portfolio that they offer to customers. Below, we give you the main highlights that put SiteGround in the best light.\n\nFast and Secure Web Hosting\n\nSiteGround offers a variety of hosting plans that you can choose from depending on the size of your business and budget.\n\nWith the StartUp plan, you can host 1 website with 10,000 monthly visits. You can scale your plan as you grow to the GrowBig plan. This lets you host unlimited websites with 100,000 monthly visits.\n\nThey also have dedicated hosting plans for WordPress sites. This makes installing and managing WordPress a whole lot easier.\n\nIf you want to run an online store, there’s a WooCommerce hosting plan. Under this plan, WordPress and the WooCommerce plugin, plus the popular Storefront theme, are all pre-installed for you. You simply need to log in and start selling.\n\nEvery plan comes with free email, SSL, CDN, and backups. More on that next.\n\nFree Email, SSL, CDN, and Backups\n\nWhile most web hosts charge you separately for add-ons, SiteGround includes it all in their hosting plans. You’ll get the following:\n\nDaily backups: Keeps a copy of your website as a backup that you can restore when things go wrong.\n\nSSL: An added layer of security for your website to encrypt all data transferred from and to your website.\n\nEmail: Get free email boxes that match your domain name. Free spam protection and webmail service are included.\n\nCDN: Free access to a Content Delivery Network to speed up page load speed for users across the world.\n\nTheir CDN includes Tokyo (Japan), Singapore, Sydney (Australia), Warsaw (Poland), Hamina (Finland), London (England), Frankfurt (Germany), Madrid (Spain), Eemshaven (Netherlands), Sao Paulo (Brazil), Council Bluffs (Iowa, US), Moncks Corner (South Carolina, US), The Dalles (Oregon, US), Los Angeles (California, US), Ashburn (Virginia, US), Dallas (Texas, US).\n\nDomains\n\nSiteGround also offers domain registration. You can search for any domain name you want and if it’s available, you can register it right away.\n\nAdded to that, they offer domain transfer and DNS services. You can manage your domain and website from the same place.\n\nUltrafast PHP\n\nOn the higher plans GrowBig and GoGeek plans, you get a custom PHP setup for great TTFB (time to first byte) and overall site speed.\n\nStaging Environment\n\nYou can create a clone of your website and test any changes you want to make there. You can run updates, install new plugins and themes, and so on. Once you’re satisfied with how your site looks and functions, you can roll out the changes on your live site.\n\nThis feature is available on GrowBig and GoGeek plans.\n\nTop-rated 24/7 support\n\nSiteGround has a helpful customer care team that’s always online. You can rely on them for fast pickup and resolution of your query.\n\nYou can connect with them via phone and live chat. Plus, there’s an extensive knowledge base that you can use to find answers on your own.\n\n30-day money back guarantee\n\nEvery plan comes with a money-back guarantee so you can get started without any commitment. If you’re unsatisfied, you can get in touch with the support team and ask for a refund.\n\nThough SiteGround has a lot to offer, it’s not free of drawbacks. We’ll discuss the cons next.\n\nSiteGround Cons\n\nSiteGround has a few drawbacks that may or may not affect your hosting experience.\n\nNo Free Domain\n\nAlmost every popular web host offers a free domain name with their plans. This is usually a 1-year registration.\n\nSiteGround’s hosting plans do not include a free domain. You can register it separately.\n\nHigh Pricing\n\nMany web hosts let you get started for as low as $1.99 to $2.75 per month. Their plans renew at slightly higher rates but at least you can get your website online with a smaller budget.\n\nSiteGround’s pricing is a bit expensive compared to other hosts.\n\nTiered Plans\n\nEach web hosting plan has limited web space. You get 10GB, 20GB, or 40GB depending on the tier you choose. This means if you need more storage, you’ll have to upgrade to a higher plan.\n\nNow that we have a better view of the pros and cons of SiteGround, let’s put their hosting performance to the test.\n\nSiteGround Performance\n\nSiteGround ensures a 99.9% uptime guarantee but we wanted to put it to the test to see if your hosting plan will be worth it.\n\nWe created a standard WordPress site hosted with SiteGround and performed several speed tests on Pingdom, Load Impact, and Bitcatcha. Here are our results.\n\nWith Pingdom’s speed test, our website loaded in less than a second using a server in Dallas, Texas.\n\nWith LoadImpact, we tested how the website performs when there’s a sudden surge in traffic. The tool sends virtual users (VUs) to our test site to build up to 100 visitors at a time.\n\nIn the chart above, the blue line (VUs active) shows the number of virtual users sent to our SiteGround site. There’s also a green line (VU load time) which shows how much time it would take to load a web page for a user.\n\nSiteGround performed well. However, when there were 50 users on the site, there was a spike in load time. It quickly recovered and page load time remained steadily low even with more users.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the site never went down during our speed test.\n\nSiteGround’s Ease of Use\n\nSiteGround makes it easy to create and manage a website. You get easy access to cPanel which lets you customize and manage your site’s settings, files, and database.\n\nThey also offer dozens of one-click installers for popular website scripts such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.\n\nAdded to that, every plan comes with a basic drag-and-drop builder. This makes it easy for anyone to create a website.\n\nSiteGround’s Pricing Plans\n\nSiteGround has very consistent pricing across all the plans it offers. Whether you pick shared, WordPress, or WooCommerce hosting, the pricing plans are as follows:\n\nStartup: $2.99 per month.\n\n1 Website\n\n10 GB Web Space\n\n10,000 Visits Monthly\n\nUnmetered Traffic\n\nFree WP Installation\n\nFree WP Migrator\n\nWordPress Autoupdates\n\nFree SSL, Daily Backup, CDN, Email\n\nEnhanced Security\n\nEcommerce Enabled\n\nWP-CLI and SSH\n\nManaged WordPress\n\nOut-of-the-box Caching\n\nUnlimited Databases\n\nGrowBig: $4.99 per month\n\nEverything in StartUp plus added features:\n\nUnlimited Websites\n\n20 GB Web Space\n\n100,000 Visits Monthly\n\nOn-demand Backup Copies\n\n30% faster PHP\n\nStaging\n\nGoGeek: $7.99 per month\n\nEverything in GrowBig plus added features:\n\nUnlimited Websites\n\n40 GB Web Space\n\n400,000 Visits Monthly\n\nStaging + Git\n\nWhite-label Clients\n\nFree Private DNS\n\nHighest Tier of Resources\n\nPriority Support\n\nThat’s SiteGrounds hosting plans. If you’re looking for domains, it can very depending on how valuable your domain name is. Below is their averages pricing.\n\nDomain Cost\n\n.com: $17.99 per year\n\n.net: $19.99 per year\n\n.org: $19.99 per year\n\n.biz: $19.99 per year\n\n.info: $24.99 per year\n\n.xyz: $12.99 per year\n\nUnsure which domain extension to choose?
