        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nTransferring your domain to the same provider where your website is hosted makes managing your website and all related services such as the domain and the hosting more convenient since it spares you the need to communicate with two separate organizations. When you transfer a domain with any of the most popular top-level extensions (.com, .net, .org, .info, etc.), you get one additional year added to your registration. Here is a list of all domain extensions that you can transfer to SiteGround.\n\nHow to transfer your domains to SiteGround\n\nTo transfer your domain to SiteGround, go to your Client Area > Marketplace > Domain Services tab. In the Add Domain Extras section, search for Domain Transfer > Get.\n\nEnter your domain name in the type-in box and click on Check Status.\n\nOur system will automatically check its status and inform you about the information needed for initiating the domain transfer. You can read more about the different types of Domain Name Statuses in this article.\n\nDomain transfer requirements\n\nFor all gTLDs (.com, .org, .net, .biz, .info) there is a common set of requirements your domain should meet in order for a domain transfer to be initiated. Most of the ccTLDs (country code top-level domains) have their own set of requirements.\n\nThe domain name must be in “Active” status. Most registrars set the status of the domain names to “Locked” by default, so you need to unlock the domain name first from the control panel of the current registrar.\n\nThere must be more than 15 days until the expiration of the domain.\n\nThe domain name must have been initially registered more than 60 days ago.\n\nYou must have the EPP code (authorization code) for the domain. You can obtain it from the current registrar.\n\nIf you are looking to transfer a .co.uk domain name, you can refer to this dedicated article.\n\nInitiating your domain transfer\n\nIn order to initiate the domain transfer, you will also need to specify the domain’s EPP code (also referred to as an EPP key or Authorization code). It’s an authorization code which is unique to each domain and is used as a safeguard against unauthorized domain transfers. You can get the EPP code from your current domain name registrar.\n\nYou will also be prompted to review and update if necessary the domain owner details. When ready, complete the order, and the transfer will be automatically initiated. If the EPP key you provided was correct, then the transfer will immediately be initiated and you will be notified when it is completed. The process itself may take up to 14 days, but usually it’ll be completed in just a few days.\n\nConfirming your domain transfer\n\nIf the EPP was incorrect, you will receive an email on the account’s administrative email address that should be used to confirm the domain transfer. You have to follow the instructions. You may receive a second email from your current registrar asking you to confirm the transfer again. When the operation is complete, you will receive a confirmation email from SiteGround."
