To do that you have to decide what kind of website you want to create â€“ a blog, online store, gallery, forum, etc.\n\nAfter you have decided what kind of website to create, choose how to make your website. There are several ways you can go.\n\nThe easiest one is to use a site builder application, which offers you great looking templates and has a simple and yet efficient navigation.\n\nAt SiteGround there is an included free SiteBuilder in your hosting account.\n\nHow to create a website with Free Open Source Applications?\n\nAlternatively, there are many web applications such as Joomla! 3.x or WordPress, which allows you to create great looking and functional websites. These content management systems are for more advanced users and offer much more features than the SiteBuilder.\n\nSiteGround is compatible with over 250 applications:\n\nContent Management Systems (CMS) like Joomla! 3.x,\n\nBlogs like WordPress and Drupal,\n\ne-Shops such as PrestaShop,\n\nForums such as phpBB and vBulletin,\n\nWikis like MediaWiki, TikiWiki,\n\ne-learning management systems (LMS), etc.\n\nYou can also use a more advanced web development application like Dreamweaver to create your website on your computer all by yourself and upload it to the server. Here you will have to be an advanced HTML user, but you will also have the most control options and space for your creativity."
