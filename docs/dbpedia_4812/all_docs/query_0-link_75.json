I pointed the domains towards siteground as well as registered it however when I try to log in through Siteground’s wordpress link it does not work and it says I have a domain connection. I had already deleted the site (which was transferred to being a .wordpress.com after I refunded my initial one year plan hosting) but I had done the prior steps before. What can I do to solve this?\n\nSelf-declared URL: prayoeats.com\n\nJetpack: Unknown\n\nWP.com: Unknown\n\nThe blog I need help with is: (visible only to logged in users)\n\nHi there,\n\nThis happens because the domain’s name servers still point to WordPress.com. To fix that, log in to Siteground’s domain control panel and update the name servers to theirs.\n\nIf you need more help changing the name servers, please contact Siteground’s support.\n\nHey there,\n\nI’ve checked your domain and it looks like it’s not yet pointed to the name servers of your new SiteGround account.\n\nIf your domain was just recently transferred to SiteGround, you can easily change its name servers directly from your Client Area, by following the steps in this tutorial.\n\nHope this helps!"
