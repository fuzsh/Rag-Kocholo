        "text": "As long as your domain is registered through SiteGround there will be no problem to change its name servers.\n\nThis can be done from Client Area > Services > Domains > Settings.\n\nOpen the Name Servers tab and click on Manage.\n\nIn the pop-up window, choose one of the available options in Nameserver Type.\n\nSiteGround – Choose this option if you want to manage your DNS records with SiteGround.\n\nPrivate – Choose this if you wish to use your own private nameservers as an alias of SiteGround nameservers. Suitable for white-label hosting where you want to manage the DNS records through SiteGround.\n\nCustom – Choose this option if you want to manage your domain through third-party nameservers. You can type the nameserver hostnames in the Nameservers fields.\n\nOnce ready, press the Confirm button.\n\nIMPORTANT! The new DNS settings will need several hours to propagate.\n\nIf you are not a SiteGround customer, you should be able to edit your name servers from the control panel at your host/domain Registrar. For more information on how to do this, you will have to contact your host/Registrar.\n\nIMPORTANT! When you change the name servers of a domain, all advanced records (A-records, CNAME-records, MX-records, SRV-records, and so on) will resolve from the DNS zone of the provider whose nameservers you are setting. Thus, if you are using a custom A-record or MX-record for your needs, it is strongly recommended to add them to the DNS zone of your new provider before switching the nameservers. This ensures minimal downtime and/or propagation."
