        "text": "SiteGround is one of the premium hosting services you can go with. Not only, they are officially recommended by WordPress but it’s a home for more than 2 million domains. There are various hosting packages to suit your need. You can choose any of them.\n\nThis guide will be more focused on the SiteGround server locations. Along with the location, we will also learn what are the features of the server. After the end of the guide, you will have a clear idea about what are the datacenters location and which one you should choose.\n\nSiteGround Server Locations\n\nNow, let’s focus on the SiteGround data centers location and see what are the available locations. SiteGround has 10 data centers in 4 major continents. Here is the list of SiteGround data centers locations.\n\nUSA (East & West Coasts): California, Iowa, Virginia, Texas\n\nAsia: Singapore\n\nAustralia: Sydney\n\nUnited Kingdom: London\n\nGermany: Frankfurt\n\nSpain: Madrid\n\nNetherlands: Eemshaven\n\nNow that you have a clear idea about the locations. We will now see which one you should prefer and why.\n\nTo explain it in short, you should always choose the data center location that is near your visitors’ location. If you have the majority of people coming from the US, it’s always better to select the US as the server location. This will load the website faster and your visitor will get the page faster.\n\nBut what if your target audience is not in these locations? Well, that’s a very good question. We will see the exact solution for this as we move further. As of now, let’s focus on the locations where the data center is available.\n\nWe will now learn a bit more about each SiteGround data center location.\n\n1. USA\n\nLocations (4): Ashburn (Virginia), Council Bluffs (Iowa), Dallas (Texas), and Los Angeles (California).\n\nIt’s the major datacenters located in the United States. People who have a target audience coming from North and South America use this as their main data center location. So, if you have major traffic from Canada or the US, you got the perfect location.\n\n2. Singapore\n\nLocation: Singapore City.\n\nThe number of Asian internet users is increasing at a tremendous speed. If you are getting visitors from any of the Asian countries, you can go with the Singapore server. It includes countries like India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Japan, and gulf countries. Usually, if you have major traffic from China, you should prefer a Chinese server. However, if a small part of your audience is from China, you can go with the Singapore server.\n\n3. Australia\n\nLocation: Sydney.\n\nThe target audience here is very limited. If you have people coming from countries like Australia, and New Zealand, you should go to this location. Basically, it includes all the countries from Oceania. As other locations will be hard to reach from Oceania, people prefer to go with the data center located on the same continent.\n\n4. UK\n\nLocation: London.\n\nThere is a huge popularity for the data center in the United Kingdom. Tons of websites have major traffic coming from the UK. In that case, you can go with the UK data center. Usually, people who have traffic from European countries as well as Russia. The good thing is that there are a few more options you can go with here.\n\n5. Germany\n\nLocation: Frankfurt.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, you got a few other options. One of the SiteGround Datacenters is located in Frankfurt. It can be used as an alternative location for European traffic. More specifically, it’s used by the people who have a majority of their visitors from Germany.\n\n6. Netherlands\n\nLocation: Eemshaven.\n\nYou can always go with Eemshaven. It’s close to Amsterdam. As you can see above, there are three major locations you can choose from in Europe. If you have visitors from the Netherlands, this is the best location to go with.\n\n7. Spain\n\nLocation: Madrid.\n\nThis server is near the African region, website owners who have the traffic coming from Africa should also go with the Spanish data center.\n\nSiteGround Data Centers Server Features\n\nSiteGround is one of the best hosting companies that you can go with. There are many cool features you get here. Along with the location, you also need to see the features. The server features will help you in keeping the data safe.\n\nWe will now see a complete list of these features.\n\nHosted in Google Cloud\n\nSiteGround data centers are hosted in Google Cloud since 2020. Google cloud is one of the best cloud hosting companies you will get. Of course, it becomes hard to manage the cloud all by yourself. Therefore, you can go with SiteGround.\n\nIf your website is hosted on Google servers, you can be sure that it’s reliable and that the network is fast. Therefore, you can certainly go with SiteGround. When you are getting SiteGround web hosting, your websites are hosted in Google Cloud. Hence, the reliability is great.\n\nNow, we will have a look at all the other features you get.\n\nHigh Redundancy\n\nAll the data centers have a reliable component. If the components are not of the highest quality, there is a good chance of server failure. There are on-site power generators. Not to mention, it has uninterrupted network coverage from all the major carriers.\n\nHence, it’s pretty clear that there is no chance that the server will stop working. In case of a power cut, the generator will help you to keep the servers active. There is a backup taken at a different location. So, even if there is any physical danger to the server, your data is safe.\n\nBest Performance\n\nWhen it comes to performance, Google has a record of maintaining a high-speed server. As the website will be hosted in Google Cloud, you can be sure that the speed will be great. Along with the Google Cloud, SiteGround also takes measures to increase the performance of the servers by using NGINX, Dynamic caching, and Memcached.\n\nThey have developed a unique ultra-fast PHP which is 30% faster than the traditional PHP. It also has a unique setup SQL. Further, you will also get a powerful caching system. Hence, you don’t need to worry about the speed when it comes to SiteGround servers.\n\nSecurity\n\nSecurity is an essential part of any server which you shouldn’t ignore at any cost. It comes with a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect your data from any unethical breaches. The team is keeping an eye on the firewall to ensure the safety of your data.\n\nFurther, to protect against you from unknown attacks, it has an AI anti-bot to protect you from hacks and threats. It protects you from 500000 and 2 million attacks daily. With this, the safety of the server will increase. Their team is also monitoring the server 24/7. They will monitor the server to get the best security. With this, the security of the server will be great and you can surely rely on that.\n\nGreen Hosting\n\nIt’s working on 100% green energy. All the energy is 100% renewable. So, when you are hosting your website with SiteGround, you are doing your part in saving the earth. Not only does it save the earth but it will also increase the efficiency of the servers. Hence, it’s a win-win situation here. This gives you yet another reason to go with SiteGround.\n\nIn which data center is my data backed up?\n\nRemember, when we are discussing the features, we saw that the data is backed up at a different physical location. You might be wondering at which location, right? Well, SiteGround has given the details about it.\n\nThey have mentioned where your data is backed up.\n\nIowa, US servers have a backup in Virginia, US.\n\nLondon, UK servers have a backup in Eemshaven, NL.\n\nFrankfurt, DE servers have a backup in Eemshaven, NL.\n\nEemshaven, NL servers have a backup in Frankfurt, DE.\n\nSydney, AU servers have a backup in Singapore, SG.\n\nSingapore, SG servers have a backup in a different server at the same location.\n\nThe Singapore server doesn’t have a different backup location as of now. However, SiteGround is working on it and the service might soon be available.\n\nCan I change the SiteGround data center?\n\nOf course, you can. If you ever feel like you have chosen the wrong data center location, you can surely change it.\n\nFor that, you need to head over to Client Area > Services > Hosting. Now, click on the Manage button right next to the hosting plan. If you can’t find the manage button, you can click on the three dots right next to the “Upgrade” button.\n\nWhen you click on it, you will be asked to choose the location and then you can proceed.\n\nNow, there is something very important to keep in mind here. When you place the request for the relocation, it might take up to 2 business days for the complete transfer to happen. In most cases, the relocation is done within a few hours. However, it’s always better to keep this in mind.\n\nSo, we suggest you choose the right location when you are registering.\n\nWhat if my target audience is not in those locations?\n\nWe will now talk about the question you had a couple of minutes ago. What if the target audience is nowhere near the location? In that case, what is the best SiteGround data center location to choose?\n\nWell, in that case, you can always use a CDN. So, what is CDN?\n\nCDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It will cache your website and keep it in another location. Now, when the user will visit the website, CDN will serve the data from the nearest possible location. CDN will have more locations.\n\nLet’s take an example to understand this in a better way.\n\nLet’s say, you choose to go with the US location of your SiteGround. Now, what if there is a visitor from an African country? If you have activated CDN, the CDN will first check the location of the visitor. Thereafter, it will serve the website from the nearest possible location. Hence, the website is loaded in no time.\n\nJust to make things clear, a CDN has multiple locations from which it can serve the data. Hence, you don’t need to worry about it.\n\nThere are many CDNs you can use. The best one will be Cloudflare. It has a huge amount of data centers. With Cloudflare, you will get coverage of 90 countries with over 194 cities.\n\nIt’s not just about the speed. There are multiple benefits of using Cloudflare. We will see more about it now.\n\nAdvantages of Cloudflare\n\nThe first benefit you will get is speed. Cloudflare has a huge network. Hence, it doesn’t matter where your audience is from, you will get the best nearest location possible. Cloudflare is free to use. You don’t have to get a premium plan to use Cloudflare. You can get started with the free version and upgrade to the paid one if needed. It’s not mandatory.\n\nNow, when it comes to SiteGround, you don’t need to worry about integrating it. SiteGround already has an integration with Cloudflare. Hence, you just need to activate it and that’s it.\n\nLast but not the least, CloudFlare will filter out the visitors from the bot. So, if there is any bot (possible attack), it will automatically implement the security mechanism there and filter it out. It’s very much useful as it will help you in preventing brute force and DDoS attacks.\n\nHence, you will not only get better performance but the security will also increase. Therefore, it’s always better to have Cloudflare.\n\nFinal Words\n\nTo conclude, this was all about SiteGround Data center locations. There are 6 main locations where you can host your website. If you want more, they have got the Cloudflare integration feature.\n\nWith this, your website will be available in many more places. We also saw that you can change the data center location even after selecting the package. However, it might take some time. Hence, it’s recommended that you should select the right package at the time of registration. This will be easier for you."
