While I am an affiliate for Siteground, I only do so because I really LOVE SiteGround.\n\nThis post is applicable as of now (2018), I’ll update this post and may recommend other hosting providers if SiteGround starts deteriorating as we’ve seen with Hostgator previously.\n\nI recommend SiteGround to all my readers – you can check out my step-by-step tutorial here: Blogging For Beginners: How to Start a Blog in 20 Minutes.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s rock!\n\nSiteground Review: Superior 24/7 Support\n\nSeriously. Their support is top-notch. First of all, it is fast. You get connected to a support person that actually knows their stuff in a matter of seconds.\n\nI used to be with Hostgator and it once took me so long to connect with a support personnel I even fell asleep waiting.\n\nSiteGround actually has legit support staff, not outsourced support who don’t have a clue about what’s going on. Yes, I shall not name names but certain big-name hosting providers actually do that.\n\nSometimes I wonder how Siteground manages to run a profitable business because I know quality support does not come cheap. Haha.\n\nHere are just some of the stuff Siteground has helped me with over the months:\n\nWhen I signed up, I accidentally asked for servers located in Asia. I wanted to change it to servers in the US (where majority of my readers are located). They changed it for me for free even though they usually charge for this, because my account was new.\n\nInstalled a SSL certificate for me, fo free.\n\nWent into complications with the SSL certificate, they helped me with it.\n\nRan into temporary problems with my email service provider and had to switch to a custom sending domain, they helped me with really technical stuff.\n\nVery recently, I ran into this problem with Convertkit (which I love btw, this was an anomaly) which required me to tweak some email records on SiteGround’s end, and having them respond immediately relieved so much of my stress.\n\nI have to admit that it was because of SiteGround’s amazing support throughout this issue that prompted me to write this Siteground review, because I felt like they really REALLY over-delivered.\n\nWanted my website backup restored, it happened within a few minutes.\n\nWanted to use gmail for my custom domain email, they helped me with the tech end of it.\n\nThere were multiple occurrences where I screwed up something on my website. You know that moment of panic when your website goes down because you messed up that bit of code?\n\nHaving SiteGround’s support by my side almost immediately helped me so much because I was able to reinstate my backups (done by SiteGround once again) as quickly as possible.\n\nTime is money in business\n\nSiteground’s support alone is priceless and makes them the best of the pack.\n\nMost hosting providers are able to run decently but the support makes all the difference.\n\nWhen something goes wrong I am SO happy that I chose SiteGround as my hosting provider.\n\nTime and again, SiteGround has saved me from so much trouble because their support staff solved my issues in a matter of seconds.\n\nClick here to check SiteGround out.\n\nOR…\n\nClick here to access my tutorial on how to start a blog with SiteGround. I will get you through all the tech so don’t worry. It has been shared more than 50,000 times and has helped thousands of bloggers and entrepreneurs launch their blogs!\n\nThey don’t do funky stuff\n\nYou probably would have heard of hosts that are a nightmare to deal with, doing things like shutting down your site indiscriminately or robbing you of your backups unless you pay.\n\nAnyway, I have yet to hear anything like this from SiteGround. I feel that good communication makes all the difference in a reliable host – and that’s precisely what SiteGround prides itself on.\n\n[Tweet “SiteGround Review: SiteGround has the best support team I’ve ever seen.”]\n\nDecent up-time\n\nMy website gets quite a number of hits every day, so it is pertinent that my site remains online.\n\nOver the past 8 months I would say that my website has been down like, maybe twice for a few seconds?\n\nIn fact, I only notice the outages because I’m using an up-time monitor, which automatically notifies me when my site goes down, even if it’s just for 0.0001 seconds. Otherwise, I probably wouldn’t even notice anything.\n\nThis is very decent and I am very happy with my website’s up-time performance. Most hosting providers promise “99.99% up-time” but do not keep to their promise.\n\nWebsite Speed\n\nMy website speed is great. There was once my site became real slow (due to server side issues), I went to support and they fixed it immediately.\n\nHowever I have to say that most of the time, if your website is slow, it usually isn’t due to your host but what you have on your website. SiteGround also has their own caching system that you can use which will speed up your site significantly.\n\n[Tweet “Siteground Web Hosting Review: After 8 months with SiteGround…”]\n\nEverything else\n\nThere are many other reasons why #TeamSiteGround – such as…\n\nAffordable pricing\n\n30-day risk-free money back guarantee (try and if you don’t like, you get a FULL refund)\n\nFree set-up and transfer (if you’re transferring to SiteGround, it’s 100% fuss-free and they guide you through everything)\n\n1-click WordPress installation\n\nA free domain name (which costs about $10USD annually)\n\nFree daily backups\n\nUnlimited email addresses\n\n…and so much more!\n\nMost importantly, SiteGround’s support is the best.
