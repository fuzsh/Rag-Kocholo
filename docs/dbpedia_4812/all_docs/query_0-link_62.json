        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nSiteGround users can enjoy our sophisticated centralized DNS system, which grants them complete control and flexibility of DNS management.\n\nThis guide will go through the entire process of adding, editing, and managing the DNS records of domains using SiteGround nameservers.\n\nHow to access your DNS zone editor\n\nTo add, edit, or delete your domain’s DNS records, follow these steps.\n\nGo to your Client Area > Services > Domains.\n\nPress the Settings button of the chosen domain. You can choose between your domains registered by SiteGround and domains registered by other companies that you use for websites in your SiteGround account.\n\nOn the next page, select DNS Zone Editor.\n\nIMPORTANT! You can manage DNS records only if your domain is pointed to our name servers. If we believe that the domain you wish to manage is not properly pointed, you will see a warning with information about the proper name servers that you should use.\n\nHow to create a new DNS record\n\nInside the DNS Zone Editor, you can create DNS records following the steps below.\n\nNavigate to the Create New Record section.\n\nClick the tab corresponding to the type of record you wish to create. It can be an A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, SRV, or TXT record.\n\nThen, fill in the required information and click Create.\n\nHow to edit an existing DNS record\n\nYou can edit existing DNS records in your domain’s DNS Zone Editor.\n\nGo to your Client Area > Services > Domains.\n\nClick on the Settings button of the domain you want to edit.\n\nNavigate to the DNS Zone Editor > Manage DNS Records section.\n\nClick the pencil (Edit) icon to edit the selected DNS record.\n\nApply the required changes in the pop-up window that appears and click Confirm.\n\nHow to delete a DNS record\n\nTo delete DNS records that you no longer need, execute the following steps.\n\nGo to your Client Area > Services > Domains.\n\nOpen the Settings page of the chosen domain.\n\nNavigate to DNS Zone Editor > Manage DNS Records.\n\nClick on the Delete (Trash bin) icon of the domain you wish to delete.\n\nIn the following pop-up window, press the Confirm button.\n\nHow to reset your DNS records\n\nYou can only reset individual records to their default values by editing them. Click the pencil icon next to the record you wish to reset, and then adjust the values to the previous default values. If you’re unsure of the default values that were initially configured with your hosting account, you can contact our support team for assistance.\n\nTTL (time to live) setting for DNS records\n\nIn the required information for all record types, there is a drop-down menu called Cache duration setting (TTL). It indicates the time DNS servers store the respective record in the cache.\n\nFor the automatically created default records, we have set this value to what we believe is most efficient. When you create a new record, you may set it to whatever value you believe is ok. If you are not sure, 1 hour is a good choice.\n\nA record settings\n\nThe A record specifies the IP addresses from IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4) corresponding to your domain and its subdomains. By default, this is your site IP address with us.\n\nIf you want to edit an A record so that part of your site points to another server, you need to know the IPv4 address of this server and insert it in the corresponding field.\n\nAAAA record settings\n\nThe AAAA record specifies the IP addresses from IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6) corresponding to your domain and its subdomains.\n\nIf you want to add or edit an AAAA record, you need to add the IPv6 address you wish to use.\n\nCNAME record settings\n\nThe CNAME record maps a domain to the server of another domain/hostname. The destination value of a CNAME is a hostname that serves as an alias to its IP address.\n\nA valid domain/host should be provided as a destination for the CNAME record, as it does not accept IP addresses.\n\nIMPORTANT! You cannot create a CNAME record for a subdomain if you already have other DNS records set for it, for example a TXT record. You must first remove the other DNS records for the subdomain and then create the CNAME one.\n\nMX record settings\n\nThe MX record specifies where the emails for your domain should be delivered.\n\nYou may have multiple delivery options that can be prioritized with the help of the priority setting. This means that the initial delivery attempt will go to the destination with the lowest priority and, if not successful, will try the next one.\n\nWhen creating a new MX record, you are presented with three preset options:\n\nSwitch to Google MX records – sets the MX records for Google Workspace.\n\nSwitch to system default MX records – sets the MX records for our own email service.\n\nAdd your own MX records – lets you set custom MX records for any email service.\n\nIMPORTANT! By default, the DNS Zone Editor has 3 MX records set to our mail service. If you use another mail provider, delete these records and set the MX records for your mail service.\n\nSRV record settings\n\nAn SRV record (Service Record) specifies the location, i.e., the hostname and port number, of servers for specified services. To set it up, you need to provide the following values:\n\nService – the name of the service, without underscore;\n\nProtocol – the protocol of the service (usually TCP or UDP);\n\nTTL – time to live;\n\nPriority – lower values mean more preferred;\n\nWeight – used for records with the same priority (higher value means more preferred);\n\nPort – the number of the port;\n\nTarget – the hostname of the machine where the service is running.\n\nTXT record settings\n\nThe TXT records are used to store text-based information related to your domain. They may be needed for domain ownership verification and are also commonly used for storing SPF and DKIM data also needed for email spoofing prevention."
