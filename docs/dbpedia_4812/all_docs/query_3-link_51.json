        "text": "If you’re looking for a SiteGround alternative for WordPress hosting, Kinsta has you covered. Powered exclusively by the Google Cloud Platform, our unique, powerful solution for managed WordPress hosting is optimized for speed and performance. It’s unlike anything else you’ll find. Let’s explore why!\n\nIntroduction\n\nKinsta is an expert in managed WP hosting for 10+ years and is well-known for top website performance, world-class support, and the powerful MyKinsta dashboard that makes website management a breeze. More than 120,000+ clients all across the world, including some of the biggest companies in the world, rely on Kinsta.\n\nEvery day, we encounter SiteGround clients who are looking for an alternative managed hosting solution that provides better performance with higher quality support.\n\nHow Kinsta Compares to SiteGround in a Nutshell\n\nKinsta’s infrastructure is fully containerized and powered exclusively by the Google Cloud Platform on Google’s Premium Tier network, enabling us to provide you with a large selection of the fastest data servers, incredible performance, server-level caching, dedicated resources, and enhanced security.\n\nWhile SiteGround also uses Google Cloud Platform, they don’t make top-tier products (C2 and C3D VMs and Premium Tier network) available for all plans. Instead, SiteGround uses slower N2 machines across its entire infrastructure.\n\nAll sites on Kinsta are protected by our enterprise-level premium Cloudflare integration, free for all customers. It includes a secure firewall, HTTP/3 support, DDoS protection, free CDN, and other benefits. You also experience transparent resource consumption, costs, and pricing.\n\nFurthermore, Siteground’s CDN was powered by Cloudflare’s free CDN solution, but recently it has been replaced with Siteground’s in-house CDN solution. With this comes a limitation on available CDN locations and bandwidth allowance.\n\nWe are also proud to be among the highest-rated managed WordPress host on G2, the world’s leading software review and comparison site:\n\nFeature Comparison Overview\n\nAt this point, we want to take a moment to look at some of the biggest differences between Kinsta and SiteGround:\n\nEnjoy a 13% Faster Website Simply by Moving From SiteGround to Kinsta\n\nWe measured 3,200+ migrations over the course of a three-month span. On average, client sites that came from SiteGround to Kinsta experienced 13% faster load times.\n\nHow is this possible? Our customers enjoy:\n\nThe latest generation of virtual machines from Google’s Compute Engine general-purpose machine family C3D VMs and The fastest Compute-Optimized C2 VMs, available across all plans in supported regions.\n\nA stack that’s been fine-tuned for WordPress over the past 8 years\n\nGoogle’s Premium Tier Network to deliver website data faster\n\nFree CDN powered by Cloudflare’s global network of 260+ locations\n\nBuilt-in Edge Caching that cuts the time needed to serve cached WordPress HTML by an average of more than 50%!\n\nContainerized sites, meaning no more shared hosting/resources at any plan level.\n\nEarly Hints feature, a modern web standard that can help immediately improve how quickly your pages load by providing additional information on what resources to preload, resulting in faster page rendering speed.\n\nMigrate from SiteGround to Kinsta hassle free with our free expert migration service. With our 30-day money-back guarantee, you can test out the service and improved speeds completely risk-free. You only lose if you don’t give this a try!\n\nKinsta vs SiteGround\n\nLet’s take a look at some of the major differences between Kinsta and SiteGround:\n\nKinsta supports 37 data centers across Google’s global network, whereas SiteGround only supports 11 hosting locations.\n\nKinsta uses C3D and C2 VMs (GCP’s fastest servers) for all plans in supported locations. In our tests, we found that C2 VMs are up to 200% faster than GCP’s lower-tier machines, while C3D machines reduced response times by a further 20% to 50%. SiteGround also uses Google Cloud Platform, but they rely on N2 machines which have slower CPU clock speeds.\n\nKinsta provides automatic continuous database optimization 24 hours a day, backed by an open-source MariaDB relational database. SiteGround doesn’t offer automatic database optimizations.\n\nKinsta never forces automatic WordPress updates on any client site. SiteGround does not allow WordPress auto-updates to be completely disabled. Instead, you have to postpone or skip an update manually. If you ignore release cycles, this type of automatic update can break a site entirely.\n\nKinsta is SOC2 compliant, which provides independent proof that we have established security procedures and adhered to those procedures over time. SiteGround is not SOC2 compliant. See Kinsta’s Trust Report for additional information.\n\nKinsta customers enjoy a free Cloudflare integration powered with enterprise-level firewall and DDoS protection on all plans. SiteGround also offers a Cloudflare integration with CDN and firewall functionality, but it requires you to set up a personal Cloudflare account.\n\nContainerized Solution. Kinsta offers a unique infrastructure that containerizes site resources so they don’t have to share. This increases and levels your performance on a per-site basis. No more worrying about sites you don’t manage potentially stealing your resources. It also helps minimize your time spent troubleshooting performance issues as you no longer have to account for potential resource stealing.\n\nBecause of Kinsta’s unique containerized hosting, you can also host multiple sites on multiple data centers, all within the same plan! No more having to pay for multiple servers just to host sites in different locations. Help your clients get an instant performance boost by simply hosting their site on a server that’s more appropriately located for their customer base.\n\nAll Kinsta plans include free access to our custom application performance monitoring tool (Kinsta APM) for debugging WordPress performance issues. For customers who prefer New Relic, we support that as well, but you must have your own license. SiteGround does not have a built-in free APM tool, nor do they provide support for New Relic on all plans either.\n\nOur custom MyKinsta dashboard includes a variety of useful site management tools that are not available on SiteGround, such as database search and replace, APM tool, free IP Geolocation manager, PHP restart, and more.\n\nKinsta offers six types of backups: free automatic/daily, optional hourly, manual, system-generated, downloadable, and external backups sent automatically to your Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage. We also store two weeks of backups at all times, with the possibility to increase data retention. SiteGround offers nightly backups and downloadable backups but doesn’t offer external backup support.\n\nSites on Kinsta are equipped with a self-healing PHP feature. We monitor all sites on our infrastructure 480 times per day and offer an uptime guarantee.\n\nKinsta lets you run a different version of PHP (we support PHP 8.1, 8.2, 8.3) for each live and staging environment. Switching between PHP versions takes just a few clicks in the MyKinsta dashboard.\n\nKinsta provides the ability to add reverse proxy support on all plans. SiteGround does not support reverse proxy configurations on its servers.\n\nKinsta’s support team is available 24/7/365. Our average response time for support requests is under 2 minutes, and we even offer multilingual support for non-English speaking customers. Furthermore, we don’t have tiered support, which means you’ll always be connected with a WordPress expert who can solve your problem. While SiteGround also offers 24/7/365 support, they don’t have multilingual support. Unlike Kinsta, SiteGround has a tiered support system, which means you may have to deal with escalations to more experienced engineers.\n\nKinsta’s Agency Partner program makes it easy to manage hundreds of client sites and provides a cost-effective solution at the same time, and you can even host your agency site on Kinsta for free when you enroll in the program.\n\nKinsta plans include everything you need to maximize site performance and security, including premium DNS, uptime monitoring, and firewalls.\n\nKinsta offers free migrations from SiteGround handled by an expert engineer. You can rest assured that your site will be migrated safely, securely, and following best practices. With SiteGround, you have to navigate the transfer yourself using a plugin or pay $30 per site transfer.\n\nKinsta CDN takes advantage of our Cloudflare integration and its worldwide network that spans almost 200 cities in more than 100 countries. We don’t need to know where you are to know there is a Cloudflare server near you. That means lightning-fast server requests to your website. It’s available at no extra cost on any Kinsta plan.\n\nKinsta has a unique system that caches pages at the server level. Our built-in Edge Caching cuts the time needed to serve cached WordPress HTML by an average of more than 50%!\n\nFor developers and agencies, Kinsta offers a powerful local development tool called DevKinsta. With DevKinsta, you can clone and develop your projects locally and push updates to Kinsta when ready.\n\nKinsta provides an SLA-backed 99.9% uptime guarantee on all plans.\n\nKinsta offers a 100% Malware Security Pledge.\n\nRead on to see the details of each Kinsta feature and how they compare to SiteGround. Or try it out right now with our risk-free 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nKinsta Is Built for Performance and Scalability\n\nIf you’re looking for a performance-oriented and scalable host, Kinsta’s got you covered. Our custom-built hosting platform is optimized to deliver incredible speed, performance, and scalability, whether you’re running a personal blog or an ecommerce store doing millions in revenue.\n\nAt Kinsta, you can scale up and down between plans with just a few clicks and transparent resource consumption. Best of all, there is no downtime when switching plans, and your hosting bill is automatically prorated with a transparent and controlled cost!\n\nWith GCP’s Premium Tier network, we ensure that the traffic to and from our customers’ sites is routed around the world as quickly as possible. When it comes to page load times and site performance, every millisecond counts!\n\nHigh-performance virtual machines powered by the Google Cloud Platform form the foundation of our hosting infrastructure. Beyond that, our high-performance hosting stack consists of orchestrated LXC containerized software containers and LXD managed hosts and highly tuned configurations for Nginx, PHP, and MariaDB. Our unique containerized infrastructure allows sites hosted on Kinsta to automatically scale CPU and RAM usage in response to traffic surges.\n\nAs part of our Cloudflare integration, Edge Caching saves your Kinsta site/page cache to any of Cloudflare’s global network of 260+ data centers.\n\nEdge Caching is included free with all Kinsta plans, doesn’t require a separate plugin, and cuts the time needed to serve cached WordPress HTML by an average of more than 50%!\n\nKinsta Is Safe and Secure\n\nAt Kinsta, we know that the security of your data is of the utmost importance, which is why we’re dedicated to providing the most secure hosting service by taking a variety of active and passive measures to safeguard your site.\n\nAll sites on Kinsta are protected by our free Cloudflare integration, which includes an enterprise-level firewall with a custom ruleset and DDoS protection. With our Cloudflare integration, you’ll get the benefits of enhanced security and performance without having to manage your own Cloudflare account.\n\nSome of Kinsta’s key security measures include:\n\nMonitoring sites every three minutes for uptime, 480 times a day.\n\nRigid software-based restrictions to stop malicious code from entering your website.\n\nReal-time DDoS attack detection and mitigation.\n\nTwo-Factor Authentication (2FA) support and automatic bans for IPs that have more than six failed login attempts in a minute.\n\nA dedicated Security Team to address malicious attackers, hacks, and exploits.\n\nFree Cloudflare integration with a secure firewall and built-in DDoS protection.\n\nOnly support for encrypted SFTP and SSH connections (no FTP).\n\nCompletely isolated containers (LXC), using LXD to orchestrate them so there’s no chance of cross-infection from other clients.\n\nFree Cloudflare SSL certificates with wildcard domain support.\n\n100% Malware Security Pledge if your site is infected with malware while hosted on Kinsta.\n\nAutomatic security checks for every plugin installed to discover vulnerabilities and/or security issues.\n\nIn the rare event that something were to happen to your site, our Malware Security Pledge means you will get hands-on assistance from our engineers free of charge. We’ll restore your site and make sure it’s free of backdoors that hackers can take advantage of.\n\nKinsta Is Developer-Friendly\n\nWe create a WordPress hosting solution tailored for developers without sacrificing ease of use. Everything from our custom dashboard to our products and tools is built to help improve your productivity.\n\nSome developer-friendly features and tools you’ll have access to as a Kinsta customer include:\n\nSSH, Git, and WP-CLI access on all plans.\n\nCustom setups like Bedrock and Trellis, as well as starter themes such as Sage.\n\nOne-click WordPress staging environments that allow you to easily push changes from staging to production as well as conveniently clone your site.\n\nRun a different version of PHP for each live site and staging site, and switch between PHP engines takes just one click. We currently support 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3.\n\nPost and page revisions enabled by default. While we recommend limiting or disabling these, we believe this should be your choice.\n\nLoad your site over a reverse proxy.\n\nBuilt-in free APM (Application Performance Monitoring) tool for troubleshooting WordPress performance issues.\n\nDevKinsta, a free local development tool.\n\nRestore backups to staging as well as production.\n\nWith Kinsta as your hosting provider, you have all the tools needed to manage your WordPress site, regardless of your technical knowledge.\n\nWith SiteGround, Git is only available on GoGeek plans and higher, and they don’t offer a free, built-in APM tool for debugging WordPress performance issues. Lastly, SiteGround does not integrate natively with any local WordPress development tools for cloning and deploying sites.\n\nUncover Your WordPress Site’s Performance Bottlenecks.\n\nOur experts will run a free performance audit of your website and send you a detailed action plan.\n\nMyKinsta: A Custom-Built Dashboard for Powerful Site Management\n\nAt Kinsta, we believe in empowering our customers with powerful features to make WordPress site management a breeze. MyKinsta dashboard is built with usability in mind.\n\nWith features like search and replace, force HTTPS, URL redirects with IP geolocation support, IP deny, Application Performance Monitoring, Edge Caching, Early Hints, Cron Jobs, PHP workers, and more, you have a wide array of powerful tools for managing your WordPress site.

Whether you’re on our Starter or Enterprise 4 plan, you have access to the same team of WordPress experts.\n\nIn addition to multilingual support and resources available in over 10 languages, we’re also proud to maintain an initial ticket response time average of under two minutes!\n\nWith the standard support, if something were to happen to your site, you would need to submit a ticket in order to receive help. There is no active monitoring like there is on Kinsta plans.\n\nFree Performance Monitoring Tool\n\nAll Kinsta plans come with a free custom-built APM tool that can be easily accessed in the MyKinsta dashboard. Kinsta APM provides you with key WordPress performance insights and metrics without the need to pay for third-party subscriptions to other APM services.\n\nWith the information you get from Kinsta APM, you can debug and troubleshoot performance bottlenecks, These include:\n\nSlow WordPress plugins and themes.\n\nLong calls to external APIs and domains.\n\nUnoptimized MySQL database queries.\n\nPHP execution time\n\nSiteGround plans do not come with a free custom-built APM tool, nor do they support the popular New Relic APM tool.\n\nOptimized for WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads\n\nAs a managed WordPress hosting company, we understand the importance of a platform capable of supporting high-traffic, resource-intensive ecommerce sites. We also recognize the unique and demanding challenges that come with powering online stores. This is why we optimized our platform for WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads.\n\nWooCommerce and other WordPress ecommerce plugins rely heavily on CPU performance because they cannot be efficiently cached. This is where our C3 and C2 compute-optimized VMs really shine with their industry-leading CPU performance. At Kinsta, we make C3 and C2 VMs available on all plans from Starter to Enterprise 4 and beyond.\n\nOur expert engineers are very familiar with WooCommerce and have developed a custom workflow that optimizes performance. Some of the ways we enhance the WordPress ecommerce experience include:\n\nExcluding ‘My Account,’ checkout, cart, and other pages that shouldn’t be cached.\n\nEnsuring a smooth checkout process by automatically bypassing the cache for users when woocommerce_items_in_cart or edit_items_in_cart are detected.\n\nImplementing specific rules to allow EDD and WooCommerce functionality during server-level page caching.\n\nWhile SiteGround has special caching rules for WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads, they do not offer C3 or C2 compute-optimized VMs to their customers. Instead, they rely on slower N2 virtual machines to power their hosting platform.\n\nDevelop Locally With DevKinsta\n\nWith DevKinsta, you can launch WordPress sites with a full hosting stack and SSL support on your local computer (macOS, Windows, and Ubuntu) with just a few clicks.\n\nDevKinsta is fully integrated with MyKinsta and Kinsta’s hosting platform, so you can join the 60,000+ community members using DevKinsta to develop locally and push updates directly to a staging environment on Kinsta!\n\nIf you’re a busy freelance or agency developer, DevKinsta’s advanced features (including multisite support) and MyKinsta integration can be a huge time saver.\n\nSiteGround does not provide customers with a natively integrated local development tool.\n\nStatic Sites for Free\n\nAre you an agency creating static WordPress sites for your clients? Or do you create landing pages for high-traffic campaigns? We got you covered!\n\nStatic site hosting is 100% free at Kinsta. You can create a static or Jamstack site or use a static site generator. We can run the build process for you and deploy your site directly to the edge.\n\nBenefits of hosting Static sites with Kinsta include:\n\nYour site is directly pushed to our edge network with 260+ locations globally, powered by the security and speed of Cloudflare\n\nUse a static site generator, and we handle the build process, which is also included free of charge\n\nAdd custom domains, and we deliver the security (SSL certificates automatically issued and updated)\n\nSign up, connect your git account, and start deploying your static site from your repo.\n\nFree Migrations From Real People\n\nWhether you want to move one site or 100, Kinsta provides hassle-free migrations that are handled by our skilled WordPress experts. You won’t have to deal with complex technology or risk losing critical data.\n\nIf you’re interested in moving your site to managed WordPress hosting, we offer unlimited free migrations from SiteGround! Our migrations are performed by an expert migrations engineer.\n\nTo get started, simply complete our site migration request form, and our experts will reach out to schedule a time. Then you can track the migration’s status directly from your MyKinsta dashboard.\n\nAgency Partner Program\n\nKinsta has an Agency Partner Program specifically designed for agencies looking for a powerful and secure hosting platform with minimal overhead. After joining our Agency Partner Program, your agency will be able to focus on developing client projects and expanding your business while we handle the hosting side of things.\n\nOur Agency Partner Program also comes with a number of perks:\n\nFree hosting for your agency site on a Kinsta Pro plan (a $70/month value).\n\nUnlimited free migrations for your client sites.\n\nWhite-label our cache-clearing plugin with your agency’s logo and branding.\n\nOne month of free hosting, so you don’t have to worry about paying for two hosting plans while migrating your client sites to Kinsta.\n\nAs a member of our Agency Partner Program, all your client sites will receive the same level of support, features, and tooling offered on our normal plan tiers!\n\nAffiliate Program With Recurring Commissions\n\nKinsta is constantly exceeding our client’s expectations. Our satisfied customers are eager to spread the word about our products and services, which has helped us become one of the fastest-growing hosts in the industry.\n\nFor every referral of Managed WordPress Hosting, you earn both:\n\nAn initial one-time bonus, between $50 and $500, is calculated based on the plan of the customer.\n\nA 10% monthly recurring commission is paid every month for the lifetime of the customer. The 10% is calculated out of the plan’s monthly fee (discounts applied). Add-ons are not included.\n\nFor every referral of Application Hosting and/or Database Hosting, you earn a 5% recurring commission every month for the lifetime of the customer. The 5% is calculated out of the customer’s monthly invoice (discounts applied).\n\nThis is a powerful opportunity to earn a passive income!\n\nTo make the Kinsta affiliate experience even more enjoyable, we custom-built our own easy-to-use affiliate dashboard. Therefore, you won’t have to deal with complicated or confusing third-party platforms.\n\nSiteGround has a tiered affiliate program that pays between $50 to $100 per sale (not including custom arrangements). However, they don’t pay recurring commissions for the lifetime of a referred customer. This means SiteGround’s affiliate program doesn’t allow you to build a passive income stream.\n\nJoin Others Making the Switch to Kinsta\n\nAt Kinsta, we offer the fastest, latest technology possible. We’re constantly evolving and adapting to leverage the most innovative solutions available. You can see for yourself simply by checking out our Changelog!\n\nWe are confident in our solutions and want you to be 100% satisfied with your hosting, which is why we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee and free migrations from SiteGround. It’s time to move away from SiteGround and switch to our managed WordPress hosting platform."
