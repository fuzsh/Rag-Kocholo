But Now I would like to switch from wordpress to Static site generator and use Netlify as my preffered hosting service.\n\nNetlify site name - https://flamboyant-chandrasekhar-a83257.netlify.app\n\nMy Custom Doamin - https://jhooq.com\n\nDomain Purchased - I bought the domain from Google\n\nHere is my situation\n\nI am currently affiliated with EZOIC advertisement platform. To use their service they asked me to use their custom name servers. Here is the screenshot from the google domain\n\nSo in short there is PROXY EZOIC server sitting in between.\n\nMy question is - If i would like to switch from Siteground to Netlify then what should be my preferred steps?\n\nEZOIC says - As per them they support Netlify and this is what i found on their website - Nameserver integration is only possible by pointing to an alias record of the load-balancer since Netlify has dynamic IPs. Using Cloudflare integration or contacting Netfly for an alias record is recommended\n\nCould someone help me with the steps that i should use so that there is minimal outage for my users during the migration?"
