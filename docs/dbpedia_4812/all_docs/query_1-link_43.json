        "text": "Want to send emails from your domain hosted on SiteGround?\n\nBy adding a few DNS records to your SiteGround account, you’ll be on your way to sending transactional emails with SendLayer.\n\nIn this tutorial, we’ll show you how to set up SendLayer with a site that’s hosted on SiteGround.\n\nBefore getting started, be sure to:\n\nAdd a domain to your SendLayer account\n\nAccessing DNS Records in SendLayer\n\nWhen you add a domain to your SendLayer account, SendLayer will automatically detect your domain host and generate 5 different DNS (Domain Name System) records that are unique to your domain.\n\nIf it doesn’t detect the correct domain host, click the Change your domain host here link to choose your domain registrar.\n\nIn the overlay that appears, click the Choose your domain host dropdown and select SiteGround from the available option.\n\nHere are the types of DNS records that SendLayer provides:\n\nCNAME\n\nTXT\n\nEach type of DNS record has a HOSTNAME, VALUE, and TTL (time to live) specific to your domain. You’ll need to add each of the 5 DNS records to your SiteGround account, which we’ll go over in the following steps.\n\nLocating DNS Settings in SiteGround\n\nTo access your site’s DNS settings, you’ll first need to log in to your SiteGround account.\n\nOnce you’ve successfully logged in to your account dashboard, click on Websites in the navigation bar.\n\nOn the next page, you’ll see a list of your domains hosted on SiteGround. Click the SITE TOOLS button for the domain that you’ve added to SendLayer.\n\nThis will bring you to the dashboard for the selected domain. From here, click Domain in the side menu.\n\nThen, select DNS Zone Editor from the list of options that appear.\n\nThis will take you to the DNS Zone Editor page where you can add new DNS records and manage existing ones.\n\nAt the top of the page, you’ll see a Create New Record section with options to add the DNS record type, name (hostname), value, and TTL.\n\nIn the next section, we’ll cover how to add SendLayer DNS records to your SiteGround account.\n\nAdding DNS Records in SiteGround\n\nFor each of the 5 DNS records that SendLayer provides, be sure to add the TYPE, HOSTNAME, VALUE, and TTL to the corresponding fields in SiteGround.\n\nAs you can see in your SiteGround DNS settings, SiteGround appends your domain to the name of each DNS record that you add by default.\n\nAs an example, we’ll add our first CNAME record to our SiteGround DNS settings.\n\nFirst, select the CNAME option from the list of DNS record types in SiteGround.\n\nThen, switch back to your SendLayer account and locate the HOSTNAME. Here, you’ll need to copy the sl hostname.\n\nAfter that, switch back to your SiteGround account and add the HOSTNAME to the Name field.\n\nNext, be sure the TTL is set to 5 min.\n\nThen, head back to your SendLayer account and copy the CNAME record’s VALUE by clicking on the copy icon.\n\nAfter that, switch back to SiteGround and paste the VALUE in the Resolves to field.\n\nOnce you’ve added the details for the CNAME record, go ahead and click the CREATE button.\n\nNow that you’ve successfully added your first DNS record, be sure to repeat this process with the remaining DNS records that are in your SendLayer account. You should be adding a total of 4 different CNAME records and 1 TXT record.\n\nAfter you’ve added all 5 DNS records, you should see them listed in the Manage DNS Records table in your SiteGround account.\n\nChecking Your Domain Status\n\nAfter you’ve added the DNS records to your SiteGround account, you can check if they’ve successfully propagated right from your SendLayer account. Remember, it may take up to 24-48 hours for your web hosting account to apply the DNS changes."
