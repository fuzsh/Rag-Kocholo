Our line of work allows us to handle a lot of SiteGround websites for our clients. Based on this experience and our general knowledge of hosting, we offer you this detailed review of SiteGround.\n\nIn this article, you will learn about the origin of SiteGround, its history, and its user interface. We will also share with you the speed test results that we conducted to measure SiteGround's performance.\n\nAdditionally, we will talk about the quality of customer support offered by SiteGround, its pricing plans, and the pros & cons of using SiteGround to host your website. We will then address the most common questions about SiteGround in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) section towards the end of this article.\n\nSo let us begin with a brief introduction.\n\nAbout SiteGround\n\nSiteGround began its journey in 2004 in Sofia, Bulgaria. Starting with only the founder, Ivo Tzenov, and a few of his university friends, the company has now grown to employ 500+ employees all over the globe.\n\nSiteGround offers hosting plans for WordPress, WooCommerce, Joomla, Drupal, Magento, and PrestaShop websites. It also provides hosting for resellers. The host is trusted by 2.8 million domain owners worldwide.\n\nSiteGround User Interface\n\nSiteGround has an excellent user interface that allows fast onboarding for newbies. The intuitiveness offered by the interface helps to build a website quickly even without any technical knowledge.\n\nSiteGround also allows you to add users as collaborators to speed up your workflow. This feature is helpful for website developers, designers, and agencies with multiple resources working on the same project.\n\nSpeed Test Results\n\nWe conducted a few speed tests to measure the performance delivered by SiteGround. Before delving deeper into the test results, it is worthwhile to mention that very few shared hosting providers provide excellent stable performance, and SiteGround is among them.\n\n1. Website speed\n\nWe performed speed tests using the online tool Pingdom and compared two WordPress websites hosted on the GrowBig plan offered by SiteGround.\n\nBefore Speed Optimization\n\nWe tested a website of a multinational company with the intermediate and most popular hosting plan from SiteGround — GrowBig.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the test results:\n\nThe tested page contains a Revolution Slider that generally slows down the loading speed. But SiteGround stands strong despite this shortcoming, even with no initial optimization.\n\nNow let us see how much improvement you can experience in the loading speed by using server cache or a speed optimization plugin.\n\nAfter Speed Optimization\n\nWe chose a big, content-heavy website using the Divi page builder for testing this aspect. The tested page is 4.4 MB, as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nAs you can see from the test result image, SiteGround successfully loads the website quite fast despite its heaviness.\n\nOur Verdict: Our SiteGround website speed test reveals that the host delivers good results both with and without initial optimization. You can choose to use a reliable speed optimization plugin to speed up your website loading time further.\n\n2. SiteGround Server Response time\n\nTo test the SiteGround server performance, we again used the best-selling hosting plan from the host —GrowBig. Bitcatcha is used to measure the server response time.\n\nGenerally, the server response times delivered by many hosting providers reach the hundred mark and can go upwards in 3 digits. It is especially true in the case of the farthest data center locations.\n\nBut as seen above, SiteGround manages to deliver excellent server response times. Even for the faraway data center locations, the response time remains under 70ms.\n\nOur Verdict: Our SiteGround server response test reveals that the host delivers exceptional performance and will offer good response time no matter where your website visitors are. You can choose any data center location with SiteGround since even the farthest one shows good response time.\n\n3. SiteGround Uptime\n\nAlong with the website speed and the server response time, we also reviewed the uptime offered by the host. We utilized the tool UptimeRobot for testing the uptime delivered by SiteGround. Here are the test results:\n\nAs seen in the image above, SiteGround offers an excellent uptime of 100%. We have not experienced even a single downtime in the last two months.\n\nOur Verdict: The hosting services offered by SiteGround are fully reliable. You can expect your website to remain online at all times, thereby preventing any business loss.\n\nSiteGround Support and Customer Service\n\nAfter using SiteGround hosting for such a long time on many websites, we can safely say that they value their customers.

Let’s look at the suitability and pricing of these plans.\n\nShared Hosting Plan\n\nThere are three shared hosting plans with the following pricing:\n\nStartUp\n\nThis entry-level shared hosting plan is suitable for people planning to host only a single website. You can choose this plan for a small blog, local business, or a small website with limited resource needs.\n\nGrowBig\n\nThis intermediate hosting plan from SiteGround is the most popular one since it serves the needs of most website owners. It is suitable for people requiring additional server resources and planning to host multiple websites from a single account.\n\nGoGeek\n\nGoGeek is the highest shared hosting plan from SiteGround. It is suitable for people with more server resource needs. Along with hosting multiple websites, receiving more space, and handling additional website traffic, you will receive priority support and staging plus git features.\n\nFrom the above price lists, it is visible that the 12-month shared hosting plans from SiteGround are the most economical ones. So we would advise you to purchase a year-long hosting package depending on the features you need for your website.\n\nSiteGround Cloud Hosting Plans\n\nSiteGround offers four cloud hosting plans:\n\nJump Start\n\nThe entry-level cloud hosting plan is suitable for people with minimal resource needs.\n\nBusiness\n\nThis cloud hosting plan offers double the SSD space provided by the “Jump Start” plan.
