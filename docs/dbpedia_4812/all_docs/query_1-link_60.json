When I dig into my DNS records, I find\n\n'CNAME' record www.domain.org is an alias of domain.org\n\n'A' record domain.org points to IP xx.xxx.xx.x\n\n...and there's a similar 'A' record for mail, webmail, ftp etc subdomains.\n\nI understand that in migrating, I point CNAME to the new hubspot address.\n\nTo get a my root domain to also point to the new hubspot-hosted site I need to do a domain redirect, correct? I'll try SiteGround's Domain Redirect Tool. But...don't I have to do something with the A record? (Couldn't find anything in KB that mentions that record.) Or do I leave as is, it points to that static current IP address within SiteGround, then hits the Domain Redirect? (And leave the A and MX records for email alone.)\n\n[FWIW, I have a very very low volume site, so any inefficiency with Redirect can be tolerated.]\n\nThanks!\n\nSolved! Go to Solution.\n\nHi @StewC ,\n\nYou can connect your root domain directly with HubSpot instead of using a subdomain, so if you set it up correctly, you won't need a redirect at all:\n\nHowever, if you really want to use a subdomain, you could connect your root domain as a redirect domain in HubSpot and point it to your subdomain:\n\nIf you connect your root domain to HubSpot, the HubSpot UI will show you the IP address you need to set in your A-record. If you only connect a subdomain, it will show you a CNAME record.\n\nLearn more about HubSpot by following me on LinkedIn or YouTube\n\nDid my answer solve your issue?
