        "text": "Most newbie bloggers struggle with one of the crucial steps to starting a blogging business: setting up their blog for the first time.\n\nIf that sounds like you, I hope to shed some light on the topic and make a case for why you should choose self-hosted WordPress as your preferred blogging platform, why pick SiteGround as your WordPress hosting provider, followed up by exactly how to set up your brand new WordPress blog with SiteGround hosting.\n\nAlso, just so you know, I’m a WordPress user on SiteGround hosting myself. This blog? Yeah, it’s hosted on SiteGround. My recommendation comes straight from my personal experience!\n\nNow that that’s settled, let’s take a look at why you should host your blog on SiteGround too.\n\nThe Difference Between WordPress.org and WordPress.com\n\nMany newbie bloggers find it difficult to differentiate between WordPress (.com) and WordPress (.org). So, it makes sense to start there before talking about WordPress hosting.\n\nWordPress is a software and a content management system. Both WordPress.com and WordPress.org are essentially WordPress software. The primary difference is that WordPress.com is a service that allows you to create your website using the WordPress software, and WordPress.org allows you to download and install the WordPress software, then create and manage your website.\n\nThe latter is much more powerful because you’re able to download many other smaller pieces of software (known as plugins) to enhance the features and functionalities of your website.\n\nAnd so, I recommend that you use WordPress.org, also referred to as the self-hosted WordPress.\n\nWhat is WordPress hosting?\n\nTo use a self-hosted WordPress website, you need a platform where you can download the software and associated website assets. That’s where hosting comes in.\n\nThere are many companies out there that provide hosting services. You may have heard the names “BlueHost,” “GoDaddy,” “JustHost,” “DreamHost,” “HostGator,” and many more. In my former life as a freelance web designer and developer, I have used all of those and more. But none of them compared to SiteGround, and they still don’t.\n\nThere are some other hosting companies that can compare with SiteGround in terms of performance, but they’re much more expensive (WP Engine, Kinsta, etc.) So, why would you pay more for performance when you can get that with a cheaper provider?\n\nNo, SiteGround isn’t the cheapest. But it’s also not the most expensive. And yet, it delivers just as much as the more expensive hosting providers.\n\nWhat is the best hosting provider for WordPress?\n\nTo determine the best hosting provider for your WordPress website and blog, look for these features:\n\nEasy to install SSL (SiteGround has free SSL you can turn on with a click.)\n\nHas amazing, 24/7 customer support via email, chat, and phone. (SiteGround has all these.)\n\nProvides scalable web hosting solution\n\nSecure out of the box\n\nHas free CDN (Something like Cloudflare integration)\n\nHas free emails\n\nRuns the latest PHP version and is fast\n\nPreferably does not use cPanel and has in-house hosting solutions (cPanel technology is close to being outdated!)\n\nHas multiple data centers around the world for fast performance anywhere\n\nHas great uptime (SiteGround’s uptime is over 99.99%)\n\nI’m happy to say that SiteGround checks all of these boxes.\n\nWhy I love SiteGround: A Brief Review\n\nIt will be difficult for me to outline all the different features of SiteGround in detail. There are plenty, and as I’ve said, SiteGround checks all the aforementioned boxes. You can also look up many of these features here.\n\nHowever, I’d love to point out a few that have been game-changers for me.\n\nSiteGround is fast!\n\nSlow websites are bad. It’s bad for your readers because they don’t want to wait forever for your website to load. It’s bad for you because when readers get bored or annoyed, they don’t want to stick around. It’s also bad in terms of your SEO; Google and other search engines don’t like poor-performing, slow websites.\n\nNow my website isn’t the leanest on Earth (1.2MB): I use quite a few plugins, I have built my entire site with the Elementor page builder (which is known to be heavy,) and I also use custom fonts and tons of images. And yet, my website loads in under 2 seconds. Which is amazing! One of the reasons behind my fast-loading website is a great hosting company: SiteGround.\n\nHere, take a look at the GTmetrix results of my homepage: The first image shows the overall score, and the second image shows the time it took to load my site (a whopping 1.2 seconds!!!)\n\nIf you want to learn what else I have done (aside from choosing SiteGround as my hosting provider,) to make my site fast, read this blog post.\n\nSiteGround is more secure than others\n\nOut of the box, SiteGround employs a ton of security measures. Because SiteGround uses its own website management tools (known as Site Tools,) as opposed to something like cPanel (which is totally outdated!) it can build tighter security features in-house.\n\nHeck, they even have their own site scanner now (for an additional price) that monitors your website and informs you right away if it senses a threat.\n\nBut even without Site Scanner (especially if you’re a brand new blogger with a limited budget,) you’re still in much better hands with SiteGround than any other hosting company. I know because I have been with them since the dawn of this website, and until recently, my only form of site security was the free WordFence plugin.\n\nOffers free email addresses\n\nA couple of years ago, I finally signed up for Google workspace and now manage my work emails from there. But until then, I used SiteGround’s free email services. It was great as I still wasn’t making enough money and needed to save what I could.\n\nMany hosting companies will make you pay extra for emails, but not SiteGround! So, if you’re a beginner blogger on a budget, you’re in good hands.\n\nTheir support is just amazing\n\nTheir hosting is so amazing that I hardly need to contact their support, but on those rare occasions when I do have to get a hold of a real person, all I have to do is hop on their live chat, and it’s fast! And the support is just amazing. They really care about their customers and try their best to help as much as they can.\n\nAlso, their support is available 24/7. I have reached out to them at 3 in the morning, and also at 6 in the evening, and every time a wonderful, actual human being, has answered all of my questions.\n\nThey have a ton of free features\n\nThey have free SSL (which you must have, and many other hosting companies charge you extra for that,) free integration with Cloudflare basic CDN, a free caching and performance plugin they’ve developed in-house (SG Optimizer,) free emails, free unlimited websites on the GrowBig plan (and higher plans,) and many more cool features. Check out all the SiteGround features here.\n\nSiteGround offers huge discounts to first-time users\n\nAs I’ve said, SiteGround isn’t the most expensive hosting solution, but it isn’t the cheapest either. For example, at the time of writing this, their GrowBig plan (the one I recommend to bloggers) is $24.99 per month. However, if you’re a first-time SiteGround user, then you can enjoy mega discounts on all of your yearly hosting plans.\n\nHow much discount you’ll get depends on when you’re signing up and which offer is running at that time, but you’re almost guaranteed to get a pretty big discount on your first purchase.\n\nLike, seriously, if you’re just starting a blog, or are not satisfied with your current hosting provider, I highly recommend you sign up wth SiteGround. I haven’t regretted my decision to host this blog with them. And I have a feeling that you won’t either!\n\nHow to Set Up Your WordPress Website with SiteGround\n\nIn the next few sections, I want to show you how to get your self-hosted WordPress blog up and running with SiteGround.\n\nSign up for SiteGround hosting\n\nSigning up for SiteGround is easy peasy!\n\n1. Head over to SiteGround.\n\n2. Choose your plan. As you can see in the image below, SiteGround offers three shared hosting plans for WordPress users. The cheapest is the StartUp plan with basic features and functionalities. The GrowBig plan offers a whole bunch of other features including staging, on-demand backup and restore functions, and enhanced security and performance. The GoGeek offers a web solution that’s even faster than GrowBig.\n\nIt may be tempting to go with the StartUp plan as it’s the cheapest, but if you can afford it, I highly encourage you to sign up for the GrowBig plan. This way, you’ll be able to enjoy Siteground with most of its amazing features for free.\n\nAnd of course, you can upgrade any time!\n\nFor example, I started with the GrowBig plan, then moved to the GoGeek plan about a year into my blog, and right now I’m on their Cloud plan.\n\n3. Choose your domain: Once you choose a plan, the next screen will prompt you to pick your primary domain. In this step, you can register a new domain with SiteGround, or use one that you already own. Click “Proceed” after you’ve chosen your option.\n\n(If you have a domain from a different company, you have to transfer or point your domain to SiteGround. I suggest pointing instead of transferring. Different companies have different interfaces, but essentially, you’ll have to point your domain to SiteGround using SiteGround’s nameservers. More on it in the next section.)\n\n4. Now, review everything, and then click the “Pay Now” button to purchase your brand new SiteGround hosting plan!\n\nOptional: Point your third-party domain to SiteGround\n\nSkip this step if you purchased your domain with SiteGround. However, if you own a domain from a different company, you’ll need to point your domain to SiteGround.\n\nYou can do so using nameservers.\n\nThe pointing method is the same no matter which company you purchased your domain with. You’ll need to get the nameserver addresses (there are two of these) from SiteGround, and then edit your domain’s original nameservers to add the SiteGround nameservers.\n\nWhile the method is the same, depending on the company you purchased your domain from, the interface to change nameservers may look different.\n\nA popular company to purchase domains from is NameCheap. In fact, I purchase all my domains from them. Since it would be impossible to show you the interface of all the different companies, I will simply walk you through the domain pointing process for NameCheap. Even if you own your domain with someone else, you should still be able to utilize the same methods to point your third-party domain to SiteGround.\n\n1. The first step is to get SiteGround’s nameservers. They are shown below.\n\nns1.siteground.net ns2.siteground.net\n\n2. In the next step, you’ll need to log into your third-party domain company. In this demonstration, I’m using NameCheap.\n\nLog on to NameCheap, and then click on “Manage” next to the URL that you’re about to point to SiteGround.\n\nIn the following page, scroll down to where it gives you nameserver options. Choose “Custom Nameservers” from the dropdown, and add the SiteGround nameservers. Then, click on the green check mark to save your new nameservers.\n\nAnd that’s it. These new nameservers will now tell NameCheap to point to SiteGround instead of NameCheap.\n\nPlease note that nameserver changes may take a few hours to a whole day to take effect. Wait until the nameserver propagation is complete before you go on to the next steps.\n\nSet up WordPress on your new SiteGround hosting\n\nNow that you’re ready to set up your WordPress blog, you may be tempted to just go and install WordPress. That’s all good and everything, but I want you to pay attention to this part because I want you to do things in a certain order. It will make life a lot easier for you in the long run.\n\nStart with installing SSL\n\nSSL is what makes your URL https:// instead of http://\n\nIt’s important because, in layman’s terms, SSL makes the connection between a browser and server safe.\n\nI see people skipping this part completely. Please don’t!\n\nBefore installing WordPress, install an SSL certificate to your domain. It’s easy, let me show you how.\n\nGo to your SiteGround account, click on “Websites”, and then click on “Site Tools” for the domain you’ll be installing SSL for. And then, click on the three lines next to the SiteGround logo on the top-left to show more options available to you.\n\nFrom this list, click on “Security” to expand, and then click on “SSL Manager”.\n\nOn the following page, choose the SSL certificate from the drop-down (Let’s Encrypt, the first option is sufficient for most blogs), and then click on “Get”.\n\nNow install WordPress\n\nGo back to the dashboard (you can access the dashboard for the selected domain from the options on the left panel which you can access by clicking the three lines next to the top-left SiteGround logo), and then click on “App manager”.\n\nIn the next window, choose the app to be installed from the drop-down. Choose WordPress as that’s what we’re installing.\n\nWhen you select “WordPress”, more options will be shown to you. Fill out the fields and then click on “Install”.\n\nA few notes on the fields to be filled out. If you want WordPress to be installed in the main domain, leave “Installation Path” blank. If you want your WordPress URL to be something like “https://mysite.com/blog”, then add “/blog” in the ‘Installation Path” field. Typically, you’d leave it blank.\n\nPick an admin username that is hard to guess. DO NOT use “admin” or your blog’s name as the username. Those are easy to guess and therefore, not safe for use.\n\nPick a password that is difficult to guess. I’d advise mixing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.\n\nUse a good email address that you have access to that you’ll check regularly.\n\nAnd then, click “Install”.\n\nClean up your WordPress installation\n\nBack in the days, WordPress installation came with a bunch of pre-installed, unnecessary plugins. Thankfully, SiteGround at least has gotten rid of most of them. The only pre-installed plugin now is the SiteGround Optimizer plugin. This is a good plugin to have for beginners as this takes care of caching and some other performance-enhancing issues.\n\nHowever, I personally like to use a premium plugin called WP Rocket for all of my site optimization needs. You can check out the following blog post to learn more about improving your WordPress blog speed and enhancing performance: How to Improve WordPress Speed and Performance with WP Rocket and SiteGround Hosting\n\nInstall your chosen WordPress theme\n\nNow it’s time to install a theme. A theme determines how your blog/website looks and performs. It’s imperative that you choose a good theme, that’s well coded, and from a reputable theme foundry that won’t disappear on you in two years.\n\nThere is no shortage of free as well as paid, premium templates for WordPress. There are also site-builder plugins that you can use to create something completely unique.\n\nThe theme I use is Astra. It’s my base, but I use the Elementor page builder plugin to design most of my pages/posts.\n\nGet Astra here\n\nGet Elementor here (Elementor is optional; Astra itself is pretty powerful and self-sufficient; especially if you’re a beginner blogger. If you’re not getting Elementor, then I highly recommend getting Astra Pro.)\n\nTo install a theme, go to Dashboard > Appearance > Themes, and then click on “Add New”. Follow the prompts to install the theme of choice, and then click on “Activate”. Most themes will require you to do some initial setup, and you can do that by following their support documentation.\n\nFYI, the free Astra theme is available to install from the WordPress theme foundry; just search for “Astra.”\n\nI have a detailed guide to using Astra (Pro) with Gutenberg to design your website. If you do not have Elementor, then this post should help you create a beautiful blog with Astra Pro and Gutenberg.\n\n[FYI, Gutenberg is WordPress’s default page builder solution. It’s pretty neat, but I just happen to prefer Elementor page builder as it’s more versatile and powerful. But for a beginner blogger, you should be fine even with the Astra theme and Gutenberg.]\n\nInstall and activate essential plugins\n\nI have a separate blog post where I’ve shared all the plugins I recommend.\n\n19 WordPress Plugins I Recommend to Bloggers for Boosting Efficiency\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhich is the best hosting for WordPress?\n\nThe best WordPress hosting is scalable, offers SSL, offers email, runs latest PHP, is fast, is secure out of the box, has great support 24/7 via email, phone, and chat, has great uptime, and is within your budget. In my experience, SiteGround checks those boxes.\n\nHow much does it cost to host a WordPress website?\n\nAnywhere from a couple of dollars per month to a couple of hundred, depending on your site's specifications and the price set by your hosting company. SiteGround, for example, has huge discounts for first-time users, and the price starts around $3 - $6 per month for the cheapest plan, and is based on the discount percentage.\n\nIs Wix better than WordPress?\n\nAbsolutely not! WordPress is much more flexible, making it scalable for your growing business needs. WordPress offers unlimited features using small pieces of software called plugins. If you can think of a feature, you bet you can accomplish it with WordPress. And not just Wix, WordPress is superior to most other content management systems.\n\nIs SiteGround slow?\n\nOne of the best things about SiteGround is how fast their websites are. Just out of the box you'll bet a faster and more secure website with SiteGround. So, no, SiteGround is definitely not slow. Also, for better performance and a faster site, consider a caching and performance plugin such as SG Optimizer — SiteGround's free in-house solution for speed optimization, or WP Rocket.\n\nWhich hosting is better? BlueHost or SiteGround?\n\nSiteGround is definitely more focused on performance with better security and higher speed. SiteGround also handles higher traffic more efficiently than BlueHost according many users and testers. Personally, I also love SiteGround's support.\n\nWe’ve now covered all the technical aspects of setting up your WordPress blog with SiteGround.\n\nIf you’re unclear about any of the steps above, or if you have questions and/or comments, leave them in the comments below!
