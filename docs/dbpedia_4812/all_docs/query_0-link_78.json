However, I link to these companies because of their service/product quality, not because of the commissions received.\n\nThe first thing you’ll need when setting everything up is a GoDaddy domain name. If you don’t already have one, head to Google and search for ‘GoDaddy 99-cent domain’ and you’ll see their ad. You’ll also need a SiteGround hosting account. If you don’t have one of those, go to www.siteground.com/go/gmm * and you’ll be able to take advantage of some discounted rates.\n\nAfter you’ve got everything set up, go to your SiteGround account and click on My Accounts.\n\nThen, click on Manage Account and when that opens up, click on Go to cPanel. On the pop-up, click Proceed.\n\nYou’ll need to find your IP address, which is located near the top left of the screen under Account Information.\n\nCopy the IP address.\n\nGo over to GoDaddy and click on Visit My Account.\n\nTo find the domain name you’d like to set up, click on the plus sign next to Domains to see all of your domains. You can also type your domain name in the search bar if you don’t see it.\n\nClick on Manage DNS.\n\nOnce you get to the DNS zone files, you’ll need to find the Type A record and click on the pencil icon on the right.\n\nIn the Points to field, paste in your IP address from SiteGround and click Save.\n\nGo back to your SiteGround account.\n\nClick Add on Domain. Type in your domain name in the first field. The next two fields will automatically populate.\n\nEnter the password with which you’d like the database to be set up. Click Add Domain. Now, you’ve added the domain name to SiteGround.\n\nIf you want to set up WordPress, go back to your cPanel by clicking on the orange cPanel Home button at the top right.\n\nScroll down until you see WordPress Tools and click on WordPress Installer.\n\nWhen that opens, click Install.\n\nSelect the domain name you’d like to set up. I usually leave the In Directory field empty.\n\nUnder Site Settings, type in your site name and description as well as your admin username, password, and email. I usually select the checkbox next to Limit Login Attempts. Then click Install at the bottom.\n\nCongratulations! You’ve just switched over your GoDaddy domain name to your SiteGround hosting and set up WordPress as well."
