        "text": "If you’re reading this article you probably know what is SiteGround and Elementor. Both companies provide WordPress hosting services.\n\nHowever, which one to choose for your website? That is the question. In this comparison I will explain the main differences and eventually help you decide the best one for your needs.\n\nWhat is the difference between Elementor hosting and SiteGround?\n\nSiteGround provides shared WordPress hosting, meaning that the service will share resources with other websites. Elementor hosting is cloud-based, meaning that your website files are stored on different servers located in the cloud.\n\nWhile both hosting services are powered by Google Cloud infrastructure, there are differences. Let’s see what they are.\n\nOverview\n\nElementor hosting\n\nElementor hosting was previously known as Elementor Cloud. It was priced at $99/year for 1 website but was later rebranded to Elementor hosting which is also billed annually and has more pricing plans.\n\nElementor got into the hosting business just recently (in 2022). It was the next logical step, to bundle the plugin with hosting, so users can get a complete hosted solution for website building.\n\nIn 2022, Elementor acquired Strattic – a hosting platform for headless WordPress, meaning that their ambitions are beyond design-related products.\n\nSiteGround\n\nSiteGround on the other hand has been in the hosting business since 2004. It proved to be a quite reliable provider, always changing and willing to improve.\n\nCurrently, they have more than 500 employees from different countries and are headquartered in Sofia, Bulgaria. The company’s main focus is to provide hosting services and according to their data, they host more than 2.8 Mln websites.\n\nI’ve been using the service for quite a while and never had any major issues. I have also followed their evolution as a company and interacted with them on multiple levels (it was always a good experience).\n\nPricing\n\nElementor hosting\n\nElementor provides 4 WordPress hosting plans:\n\nBasic\n\nBusiness\n\nGrow\n\nScale\n\nHere is what you get with every pricing plan:\n\nEven with initial discounts, Elementor hosting is a bit more expensive than SiteGround. However, You get the Elementor Pro plugin with all plans, which is worth at least $59/year.\n\nSiteGround\n\nSiteGround provides 3 WordPress hosting plans:\n\nStartUp\n\nGrowBig\n\nGoGeek\n\nHere is the breakdown of options for every pricing plan:\n\nAs you can see, the introductory prices are very attractive, starting at only $2.99 / month. Keep in mind that these are available for the first 12 months. After that, you will be charged the full price.\n\nEven so, the average price is quite competitive when you calculate it for a few years (about $10 – 12 / month for the cheapest plan).\n\nLearn more about SiteGround WordPress hosting plans and how to choose the best one for your needs.\n\nConnecting a domain name\n\nElementor hosting\n\nPointing a domain name to Elementor hosting is not that easy, but it’s manageable. You will have to add an A and CNAME record in your domain settings with your provider (for example Namecheap).\n\nHere is a handy step by step guide on how to point a domain name to Elementor hosting.\n\nSiteGround\n\nYou can buy a domain name via SiteGround, but I recommend a specialized service like Namecheap.\n\nPointing a domain name to SiteGround is simple. I’ve described the process of pointing a Namecheap domain to SiteGround. The steps are pretty similar for other domain registrars, so use this guide as a reference point.\n\nEase of use and file management\n\nElementor hosting\n\nThe hosting service is quite easy to use and was created for users who don’t have advanced technical knowledge.\n\nElementor hosting doesn’t have a cPanel or a custom hosting control panel, but you can access your database via phpMyAdmin and use SFTP (SSH file transfer protocol) to connect to your website and transfer files.\n\nSiteGround\n\nI find SiteGround pretty easy to use. You don’t need advanced technical skills to setup and manage it. Some technical background is always good to have though.\n\nThey used to provide cPanel for hosting management but later launched their own control panel called Site Tools. The new panel is well organized, intuitive and user friendly.\n\nThe File Manager is also available in the Site Tools area. There is no need to use an FTP client to upload or delete files on your website, you can do it directly in your SiteGround account.\n\nStorage\n\nElementor hosting\n\nElementor offers at least 10 GB of storage for the cheapest plan and up to 40 GB of storage for the biggest plan. They use SSDs (solid state drives) for storage, which are more reliable, power efficient and provide better performance.\n\nSiteGround\n\nSiteGround provides the same amount of storage, from 10 GB to 40 GB, but there are fewer plans. The files are also stored on SSD drives and the servers have pretty solid specs.\n\nNumber of websites\n\nElementor hosting\n\nElementor allows you to host only 1 website with the Basic plan and up to 10 websites with the Scale plan. That is not great news if you have multiple websites.\n\nSiteGround\n\nSiteground allows you to host only 1 website with the StartUp plan, but you get unlimited websites if you go for the bigger plans. If you need to host multiple websites, SiteGround is definitely worth it.\n\nCaching\n\nElementor hosting\n\nCaching is performed on the CDN level and is managed by Cloudflare. It also provides an advanced page caching feature that stores frequently accessed data in the server’s memory.\n\nNo WordPress caching optimizations are provided by default. You will need to use a 3rd party WordPress plugin for that.\n\nSiteGround\n\nSiteGround provides multiple levels of caching. Static and dynamic cache are enabled by default and Memcached memory caching system is available in all WordPress hosting plans.\n\nOptimization plugins\n\nElementor hosting\n\nWhile Elementor doesn’t have a built-in optimization plugin, it works well with most popular performance related plugins, except SG Optimizer and WP Total Cache. See the full list ofincompatible plugins.\n\nSiteGround\n\nSiteGround built an in-house optimization plugin called SG Optimizer. It initially worked with their hosting only, but now it’s compatible with multiple hosting providers.\n\nIts main goal is to improve your website speed and it offers a wide variety of features to achieve that. It’s free to use and is currently used by more than 1 Mln website owners.\n\nI wrote a guide on the best settings for SG Optimizer, so you can use it as a reference to configure it on your website.\n\nPerformance\n\nElementor hosting vs SiteGround, is either fast?\n\nWhen it comes to performance there is no clear winner here, as the plans offer different options and there are so many variables to take into account: users’ location, CDN, caching, optimization settings and many more.\n\nIt basically makes no sense to perform head-to-head speed tests, as the results won’t be accurate.\n\nBoth services provide decent performance, but if you’re crazy about site speed scores, you have 2 options:\n\nChoose a bigger plan\n\nOptimize your website for speed\n\nIf you don’t have thousands of visitors per day, both hosting services will handle your traffic well.\n\nSecurity\n\nElementor hosting\n\nElementor hosting is serious about security and offers multiple features by default. For example:\n\nCloudflare firewall\n\nDDoS protection\n\nSite locks\n\nSiteGround\n\nSiteGround provides enhanced security by default. They made sure that your website is protected and you don’t have to bother too much about basic security.\n\nHere are some available features:\n\nCustom WAF (web application firewall)\n\nAI powered anti-bot system\n\nSiteGround Security plugin\n\nSSL and CDN\n\nElementor hosting\n\nElementor provides a free SSL certificate and CDN from Cloudflare. SSL is a must these days, to ensure that your website is secure and CDN (content delivery network) is good to have if you have multiple visitors from different countries.\n\nSiteGround\n\nSimilarly, SiteGround offers free SSL certificates from Let’s Encrypt. You can install a single certificate or wildcard certificates at no extra cost.\n\nThey used to provide a free CDN (content delivery network) via Cloudflare but later switched to their own default network. It’s free to use and enabling/disabling is very simple.\n\nYou’ll need to use SiteGround’s nameservers though to make it work. Anyway, only enable CDN if you have lots of visitors from all over the world. Otherwise, don’t bother too much about it.\n\nEmail hosting\n\nElementor hosting\n\nFree email hosting is not included in any plan. If you need a custom email address like name@yourwebsite.com, you will need to buy a 3rd party email service. This will imply an additional expense.\n\nSiteGround\n\nSiteGround provides free email hosting in all plans, and you can create as many email accounts with your domain name as you wish. This will save you extra $s.\n\nA free and basic webmail app is provided, but you can connect your email with different email clients like Apple Mail, Outlook, Spark, etc.\n\nThere is also a free email migrator tool, allowing you to quickly and easily migrate your email accounts. No advanced technical skills are required.\n\nBackups\n\nElementor hosting\n\nElementor will store your backup files for a minimum of 14 days with the Basic plan and 30 days with any other plan. There are also on-demand backups, meaning that you can create backups manually whenever you want.\n\nSiteGround\n\nSiteGround will automatically backup your website every day and allow you to restore any backup for the last 30 days. This option is available for free in all plans.\n\nOn-demand backups are only available with bigger plans – GrowBig and GoGeek. Having a backup option is extremely important, trust me, I had to rollback the website a few times and it helped me a lot.\n\nIf you have lots of articles on your website, it’s recommended to manually backup all your WordPress posts, so you don’t rely on default backups only.\n\nSupport\n\nElementor hosting\n\nElementor offers the following support options:\n\nOnline chat\n\nKnowledge base\n\nEmail ticketing system\n\nFacebook group\n\nElementor Academy\n\nThe support is limited to a specific number of users (from 1 to 6 members), based on the plan you have.\n\nThe support is good, but you might sometimes feel that the service lacks full commitment and transparency.\n\nElementor has a 3.5 rate on Trustpilot, which is good but not excellent.\n\nSiteGround\n\nSiteGround provides the following support options:\n\nOnline chat\n\nEmail ticketing system\n\nPhone support\n\nTutorials\n\nKnowledge base\n\nSiteGround was known for its excellent support service. Some users complained about the declining quality of their support, but I’ve always experienced a great service with them.\n\nI still think that their support service is top notch and it’s one of their core values. After all, why invest less in support if it’s one of the main drivers of your business?\n\nThey are currently rated at 4.8 on Trustpilot, which is excellent.\n\nWhich hosting service is better?\n\nIs Elementor hosting worth it?\n\nYes, but mainly if you’ll be using the Elementor website builder and don’t mind paying extra for an email service. There are also some plugins that are not compatible.\n\nYou don’t get free website and email migration and the bandwidth is limited. On the other hand, you get on-demand backups with all plans and free SSL and CDN from Cloudflare + Elementor Pro plugin.\n\nIs SiteGround hosting worth it?\n\nYes, if you want a decent WordPress hosting service, need an excellent support service, free site/email migration, require custom emails at no extra cost and have a tight budget initially (they offer great introductory prices).\n\nSiteGround is also a great choice for those who have multiple websites, require daily backups and powerful speed optimization options via their own plugin SG Optimizer."
