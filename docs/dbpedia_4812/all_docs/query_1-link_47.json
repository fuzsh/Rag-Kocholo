        "text": "When to use SiteGround hosting?\n\nSiteGround offers unbeatable services and I’d recommend it in a heartbeat. It’s suitable for serious projects, and if you need more performance down the line, you can upgrade to one of its premium hosting plans (e.g. cloud hosting or dedicated). I especially recommend it for:\n\nOnline store (SiteGround WooCommerce hosting available)\n\nProfessional bloggers\n\nWebsites that run on WordPress (more information) – to have managed WordPress hosting services.\n\nLarge corporate websites\n\nDevelopers and designers that want quality and good customer support\n\nThose looking for features like staging, Git repositories or SSH access\n\nIn general, anything that will require high-performance solutions\n\nRemember that you can try SiteGround for 30 days with no obligation.\n\nWhen not to use SiteGround hosting?\n\nEven though this hosting company adapts to many profiles, in some cases it might not be the best option, for example:\n\nIf you’re looking for cheap web hosting\n\nIf you want Windows-based servers (check InMotion Hosting or A2 Hosting)\n\nIf you need a lot of webspace and have a small budget\n\nSiteGround specifications\n\nWhat does SiteGround’s backend look like?\n\nAt the beginning of 2020 SiteGround moved away from its old (but good) cPanel to a more modern approach. I have to say that I really like the new system, it looks much nicer than cPanel and it’s intuitive to use.\n\nAs a heavy cPanel user, I thought I’d miss it, but I have to say that it only took me a couple of hours to familiarize myself with the new SiteGround panel.\n\nBesides the new design, my favorite dashboard (they call it Site Tools) enhancement is that now websites are treated (managed) individually. This means that each site will have their own separate admin panel, which makes things easier if you have a couple of projects hosted on SiteGround (e.g. you can back up 1 site as opposed to having to back up the whole account).\n\nOn top of that, it’s possible to add users to your admin panel and assign them to individual sites and roles. As you can imagine, this is a game-changer for big teams and agencies as they will be able to give access to clients.\n\nSiteGround’s approach to Backups\n\nPersonally, I think that backups (alongside performance and a reliable customer support team) are one of the most crucial features of a hosting provider.\n\nTrue, you can connect a 3rd party service that creates backups for you (e.g. UpdraftPlus for WordPress hosting), but I am of the opinion that having it integrated with your host is more efficient and easier to manage.\n\nSo I looked very closely at SiteGround’s backup system, and I have to say, it’s the best one I found for providers in this price range (e.g. WPEngine is better, but also way pricier).\n\nHere is what I liked about it:\n\nThe backup feature is seamlessly integrated with SiteGround’s system. So no foreign system which could create conflicts needs to be used.\n\nBackups for each site are managed individually, which means that you can create a backup for just one of your sites instead of having to create backups for all your SiteGround hosted sites.\n\nHaving the option to create on-demand backups is a dream for those pushing code or system and plugin updates. Before doing so, you can create a backup for your peace of mind.\n\nBackups are useless unless you have an easy and effective way to restore them. SiteGround only requires a couple of clicks.\n\nAnd finally, the on-demand and restore backup options are included in the GrowBig and GoGeek plans at no extra cost – other web hosting companies charge for similar (worse) features.\n\nThere are a couple of things I’d like to be a bit different, for example, there’s a quota limit of 5 manual backups per site (you’ll have to delete an old one if the limit was reached), and there’s no way to download your backups, you can only restore them.\n\nPlease, be aware that the advanced backup capabilities (create on-demand and restoring) are only available with the GrowBig and GoGeek plans. With the entry-level plan, you will have 30-day backups, but you’ll need to contact the customer support team to restore them, no on-demand backup.\n\nTesting SiteGround's web hosting\n\nUptime tests\n\nI used StatusCake to measure the availability (uptime) of SiteGround’s servers. The fewer the interruptions the better. It’s recommended to have uptime figures above 99.95%.\n\nSiteGround’s uptime results in our web host reliability tests, are impressive, as you can see in the chart below:\n\nOnly Kinsta have beaten them for uptime over the last 3 years:\n\n2020 2021 2022 Uptime % SiteGround 99.97 100 100 WP Engine 99.99 99.99 100 Namecheap – 100 100 Kinsta 100 100 100 InMotion 99.73 99.95 100 A2 Hosting 99.99 99.98 99.99 Cloudways 100 100 99.99 HostGator 99.91 99.99 99.98 GreenGeeks 99.98 99.98 99.97 GoDaddy 99.90 99.96 99.95 Hostinger 99.48 99.92 99.95 Bluehost 99.96 99.99 99.95 iPage 98.45 99.85 99.95 Dreamhost 99.99 99.96 99.83 IONOS – 99.93 99.71\n\nTo monitor uptime I use StatusCake, a tool that checks each website every 5 minutes.\n\nAnd this hosting provider refunds you part of your money if your availability falls below 99.9%. If availability is one of your concerns, SiteGround is a hosting provider you can count on.\n\nIs SiteGround fast?\n\nIn my experience, SiteGround is without a doubt one of the fastest and most consistent web hosts. When we compare it to other web hosts in our most recent tests, its loading time is pretty impressive:\n\nAnd SiteGround has consistently performed well in our web host speed tests, for the last three years:\n\n2020 2021 2022 Page Load Time in Seconds GreenGeeks 2.39 1.56 1.29 A2 Hosting 3.15 2.01 1.30 GoDaddy 3.40 1.94 1.44 Cloudways 2.32 1.73 1.46 SiteGround 2.14 1.54 1.56 Hostinger 4.19 1.61 1.63 WP Engine 2.21 1.65 1.66 Namecheap – 1.60 1.69 Dreamhost 3.28 1.84 1.75 Kinsta 2.98 1.77 1.82 Bluehost 3.07 2.87 2.07 IONOS – 1.95 2.32 InMotion 4.36 2.75 2.58 iPage 4.19 2.76 2.60 HostGator 3.77 2.78 2.72\n\nResults in seconds\n\nAs you can see, SiteGround have always had top results. This is great, as our own research consistently shows the importance of website speed for SEO, UX and conversions!\n\nSiteGround’s WordPress Hosting optimization plugin\n\nSiteGround has a plugin for optimizing websites for WordPress, that makes it easy for WordPress users to optimize websites. It’s amazing – it does the work of 3 or 4 plugins. On top of managing your website’s cache options, this SiteGround WordPress hosting also gives you options for:\n\nCompressing HTML, CSS, JavaScript and images\n\nLazy loading images\n\nCombination of CSS files\n\nOptimization of browser cache\n\nGZIP Compression\n\nWordPress speed optimization SiteGround plugin\n\nThe results are exceptional. That’s why I think thatSiteGround is one of the quickest web hosting services I have ever tried. If you need high-speed WordPress hosting for your project, I’d really recommend it.\n\nSiteGround tutorial on how to install WordPress\n\nCheck out the following video-tutorial to see how to install WordPress with SiteGround:\n\nCDN tests\n\nEven though SiteGround now has its own CDN, I’d still say that one of SiteGround blessings is, that it has CloudFlare’s CDN pre-integrated. Cloudflare is one of the most popular services, and they offer a completely free account. I have to say that the free plan has some limitations, but it can still significantly improve your loading speed.\n\nI tested how a single webpage loads with the enabled CDN and without it. The test website is on a server in England, and I wanted to check how it loaded from a geographical point further away. For this, we decided to perform loading tests from Dallas. We used the free Pingdom tool.\n\nTest without CDN\n\nWe can see that even without the CDN, we get acceptable results. The total loading time was 3.20 seconds, we loaded 1.2 Mb and it received a score of 80 out of 100.\n\nHere are the results with the CDN enabled:\n\nTest with CDN\n\nRepeating the test with Cloudflare’s CDN activated (in its free version), we see how loading time improves by nearly half a second. The size of the page is the same and our final loading score is better by 12 points.\n\nSo, if you’re going to use SiteGround for your website, it may prove very useful for you to activate Cloudflare’s CDN. Even the free version would help improve your website’s performance."
