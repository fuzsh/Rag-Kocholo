Update your DNS settings at your current domain registrar\n\nThe SiteGround name servers that you should use to point your domain to us are:\n\nns1.siteground.net\n\nns2.siteground.net\n\nBy using these servers you will have the best experience with our platform: you will start using our super fast central DNS service; you will be able to easily manage all your DNS records (A record, MX records, CNAME record, etc.) through your Site Tools; you will be able to use email services with this domain on our servers. If you use email with this domain, it will be handled by our servers with no additional DNS records pointing.\n\nIf you have Private DNS activated you can find your DNS information in your User Area > Services > Domains > Settings (for the associated domain) > Extras."
