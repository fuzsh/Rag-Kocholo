Or If you want to host multiple websites get the Growbig)\n\nStep 2: Navigate to “Websites” on the top right\n\nStep 3: Select Transfer Domain\n\nStep 4: Add your domain name. E.g. yourdomain.com > “Skip & Create Empty Site”\n\nStep 5: Login to Godaddy Account\n\nStep 6. Navigate to your domains and click on DNS (You’ll need to find Manage DNS – as sometimes the user interface can change)\n\nStep 7. Copy & Paste nameservers from Siteground to Godaddy\n\nStep 8. Save.\n\nStep 9. To install WordPress, navigate to Site Tools > WordPress > Install & Manage\n\nStep 10. Select WordPress and Fill in details then Install\n\nStep 11. Navigate to Security > SSL Manager > Install Free SSL\n\nStep 12. Login to WordPress\n\nNote: It may take 15 minutes for it to connect. So take a break and come back.\n\nStep 13. Go to Plugins > Add New > Really Simple SSL > Install & Activate\n\nStep 14. Re-Login by going to yourdomain.com/wp-admin\n\nStep 15. Now you are done, and can start building your blog or website.\n\nP.S. if you want to hide your site to the public – you can use this coming soon plugin. So only you will be able to view it – if you’re logged in.\n\nThank you!"
