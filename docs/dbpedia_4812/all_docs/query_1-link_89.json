        "text": "Here at ETNHost, we recommend that you keep your domain name where you host your website. It is easier to manage, fewer passwords to worry about, better security, and last but not least this way you get a piece of mind. You will receive regular notifications from us, via e-mail, reminding you when the renewal date for your domain name is due, so you will not miss to renew it and risk your website becoming inaccessible.\n\nDomain name transfers may take anywhere between 3 and 10 days until completion. Before initiating a domain name transfer of a domain name registered with SiteGround, you will need to make sure that the following conditions apply:\n\nThe domain must be more than 60 days old. This is not an ETNHost, nor SiteGround specific rule but rather a rule implemented by ICANN, the organization that governs domain registrations.\n\nThe domain has been Unlocked for transfer from SiteGround.\n\nThe domain is showing your current e-mail for the admin contact in the whois as that is where the authorization email will be sent. You can find the valid administrative e-mail for your domain name by using the WHOIS lookup tool available at: http://whois.domaintools.com/\n\nThe domain must not be too close to its expiration date, as SiteGround will normally auto renew domains 15 days prior to expiration.\n\nIf the above link shows the administrative email is newdomains@siteground.com or similar, you have to change it to yours in order to complete the transfer successfully. (View step 4: Change your contact information if needed, listed below)\n\nTo prepare your domain name to be transferred away from SiteGround you must engage in the following steps:\n\nLog into your SiteGround Customer Area\n\nGo to My Accounts Section. Your domains are listed at the bottom of the page with a Manage button next to each domain.You can either scroll down, or use the drop down at the top of the page for faster navigation. Once you click the Manage button, you will access the management section for the particular domain.\n\nUnlock your domain name\n\nTo unlock your domain name for transfer go to My Account find Domain names and click on Manage. There will be a button Update next to the Status of the domain name. Change the status to \"Active\" and allow 24 hours for this change to propagate.\n\nDisable the domain privacy/ ID Protect\n\nTo deactivate the ID Protect feature of the domain name you would like to transfer, you have to contact SiteGroundâ€™s support team and request for them to disable it for you.\n\nChange your contact information if needed\n\nTo update the contact information of the domain name you would like to transfer go to My Account find Domain names and click on Manage. Under the Your Domain Administrative Contact Information section, you will find the corresponding fields. Update where necessary and then click on the Update button.\n\nObtain the EPP code/ Authorization code\n\nTo request the EPP/Auth code to be sent to your administrative email simply go to My Account section find Domain names and click on Manage. Find the Obtain EPP Code section and click on the Send button.\n\nAfter completing the preparation, let some time pass (a day or so) before you initiate the transfer. You can also check the Whois info for your domain. You can do this at http://www.whois.net or http://whois.domaintools.com or similar sites, to make sure everything shows up and is correct.\n\nOnce ready, you can now submit a transfer request for the domain:\n\nStart within your ETNHost account .\n\nProceed with posting an order for the domain name transfer by clicking on the Domains tab.\n\nUpon the request of the domain name transfer, you will need to enter the Authorization/EPP code. Once the code is entered then the process will begin.\n\nNote that you will also receive a transfer approval email to the listed administrative contact for the domain. After the transfer is confirmed the losing registrar (SiteGround) has 7 days to release the domain. If everything is OK, the domain will be released and added to the Domains Section in your ETNHost account."
