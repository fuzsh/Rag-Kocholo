Click on the “Manage” button.\n\nIn the popup window, select “Custom” in the “Nameserver Type” select menu. You will enter the Pressable nameservers in the provided fields:\n\nns1.openhostingservice.com\n\nns2.openhostingservice.com\n\nns3.openhostingservice.com\n\nns4.openhostingservice.com\n\nns5.openhostingservice.com\n\nand then press “Confirm” as shown below –\n\nOnce the Nameservers are updated, you can manage the DNS records of the domain with us. Once added your NS should look like this:\n\nNote: If you already have email hosting for your domain, we recommend getting in touch with us prior to changing the nameservers to minimize/prevent any email downtime.\n\nPointing SiteGround.com A Records to Pressable\n\nLog into your Siteground.com account and navigate to Services → Domains.\n\nPress the “Settings” button on the card of the domain you want to point to your Pressable site.\n\nSelect the “DNS Zone Editor” tab.\n\nDelete any existing records for *, @, or www A records. Select the “A” tab and enter one of your Pressable IP addresses into the IPv4 Address field:\n\nCreate a second A record in the same manner, for the other Pressable IP address. Next, create two A records in the same fashion for the www versions of your domain name.\n\nOnce complete, your records should look like the following:\n\nAlternatively, instead of creating two separate A records for the www version of the domain, you could instead point the www via a CNAME record. To do that, select the “CNAME” tab. Enter “www” into the “Name” field, And then in the “Resolves to” field, enter your domain name.\n\nOnce saved, your records should look like this:\n\nAdd Your Domain at Pressable\n\nAfter you have updated the DNS settings at your registrar using one of the methods listed above, you will need to add your domain to your Pressable site. However, if you use the Domain Setup Wizard option it will automatically add the domain for you.\n\n(Optional) Re-provision SSL Certificate\n\nThis step will only apply if you added your domain on the Pressable control panel (Step two) a considerable amount of time before pointing the domain via DNS (Step one). If this is the case, you may find that your site doesn’t have an SSL certificate and you will need to re-provision one. You can do that from the Domains tab on your control panel.\n\nClick the Actions button to the right of your domain, then click Retry SSL:\n\nIf you already have a valid SSL certificate you may see an error message, but if your site does not yet have a valid certificate this should generate one. You only need to click the icon once, we will include all secondary domains attached to the site in the certificate.\n\nIf you are still having trouble with SSL not working as expected please contact our support team for further assistance.\n\nYoast Indexables"
