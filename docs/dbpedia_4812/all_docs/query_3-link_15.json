        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nList of SiteGround Data Centers\n\nLondon, UK\n\nIowa, US\n\nEemshaven, Netherlands\n\nFrankfurt, Germany\n\nMadrid, Spain\n\nSydney, Australia\n\nSingapore\n\nHere’s a map of all the SiteGround data centers:\n\nList of SiteGround CDN Locations\n\nSingapore\n\nTokyo, Japan\n\nSao Paulo, Brazil\n\nSydney, Australia\n\nFrankfurt, Germany\n\nLondon\n\nMoncks Corner, US\n\nDalles, US\n\nLos Angeles, US\n\nCouncil Bluffs, US\n\nMadrid, Spain\n\nEeemshaven, Netherlands\n\nWarsaw, Poland\n\nHamina, Finland\n\nHere’s a map of all the SiteGround CDN locations:\n\nAs you can see, every data center is also a CDN, but most CDNs are not data centers.\n\nSiteGround’s Default Data Center Depends on Where you Are\n\nDepending on where you live, SiteGround will choose a data center for you. Based on your credit card information or the address you provide, SiteGround knows your location. So if you’re not careful, you might purchase hosting on a data center far from your intended customers.\n\nHow to Switch SiteGround Data Centers\n\nSuppose you accidentally got the wrong data center when you signed up or want to relocate your server to a new data center. In that case, you can do so by requesting a “Hosting Relocation” via the customer SiteGround control panel at Client Area > Marketplace > Hosting services > Hosting relocation.\n\nNote that this isn’t free. Last I checked, it cost me $30 to relocate my server from the Netherlands to Chicago. So this isn’t something to be taken lightly! In addition, your IP address will change, so plan accordingly.\n\nNo SiteGround Data Center in India\n\nUnfortunately, SiteGround doesn’t have a data center in India, despite having two locations in the east – one in Singapore and one in Australia. I’ve often preferred Singapore to India for hosting, but sometimes you don’t have a choice but to host a server in a specific country for legal reasons. For this reason, if you want a server in India, I suggest you choose HostArmada. In my HostArmada review, you can see that it has a server in Mumbai, India. Here’s the complete HostArmada vs SiteGround comparison.\n\nAlternatives to SiteGround for Data Centers\n\nVery few web hosts have as many data centers as SiteGround. As I’ve shown above, one is HostArmada, and the second is Kinsta. However, if you host multiple sites, Kinsta is even more expensive than SiteGround. Kinsta has data centers in 35 locations all over the globe, which dwarfs SiteGround’s choice of locations.\n\nSiteGround’s CDN Plan – Two Tiers\n\nAll SiteGround customers get access to the CDN. These will serve your static content and cover your primary domain. However, there are bandwidth limitations on the free tier. With a premium CDN plan, you can also host dynamic content on the EDGE, similar to Cloudflare and QUIC.cloud, and you get unlimited traffic through the CDNs.\n\nSiteGround’s CDN Plan Isn’t Worth it\n\nUnfortunately, I can’t recommend the paid CDN plan. With QUIC.cloud and Cloudflare, you get the same functionality with more features. Since it already has server-side caching, CDN caching is a huge step up. But SiteGround is too expensive, and paying extra for a CDN for functionality that should be included by default is too much to ask.\n\nMore Data Centers Coming Soon\n\nNow that SiteGround is running on Google’s Compute network, I expect them to roll out more data centers and CDN locations, depending on how much business they expect from the various regions. So if you don’t find a data center in your location yet, keep your eyes open for one opening soon."
