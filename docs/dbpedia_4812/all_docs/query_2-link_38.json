We have carefully selected the best plugins for the most common website needs based on our years of expertise.\n\nClick the Add button for the functionality that you want to have on your website. Note that you can choose to have more than one or even all of them installed.\n\nOnce you have picked the desired plugins, click Continue at the bottom of the page to proceed to the next step.\n\nStep 4: Add marketing automation tools\n\nHere you can choose from the most powerful marketing tools available for WordPress. These tools are great for your website’s SEO and provide you with different methods for analyzing your website’s traffic.\n\nOnce you have picked the desired tools, click the Complete button to initiate the final step of the process.\n\nStep 5: Sit back while we set up everything\n\nOnce you press the Complete button we will start installing and setting up the desired theme, plugins and tools that you chose on the previous steps.\n\nDepending on the number of functionalities you selected the process could take a few moments.
