        "text": "Hello all. I’m a rank beginner. I’ve had a workpress.com site for a few years. Recently I migrated to Siteground using their site migrator. I’d paid various people to help improve the site and begged them to keep it simple. Unfortunately, they didn’t. So now I have a complex site with issues. In exasperation, I trashed lots of the pages – I only wanted five. I tried to restore them but could only restore four. One page, the ‘about me’ page, I trashed and rewrote but when I look at the site, the old ‘about me’ page is still there, even though it’s in the trash. Please help if you can. I’ve spent a lot of money, from my perspective, on this site, but I’m at my wits’ end.\n\nThe page I need help with: [log in to see the link]\n\nHi @lucyweirphd – Siteground is notorious for their memcache, so first thing you should do is login to Sitegroud, and clear the caches, see here:\n\nhttps://postimg.cc/bd4Dj18L\n\nYour About Me page is throwing a 404:\n\nhttps://knowyogaireland.com/?page_id=1952\n\nCheck the URL Slug in this page, and then re-save your Permalinks, see here:\n\nhttps://postimg.cc/3dCKbGwk\n\nhttps://postimg.cc/TKNvZJv3\n\nYou also have images that are being referenced from your old wp.com accont – see here:\n\nhttps://i1.wp.com/knowyogaireland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cropped-logo_wide.png\n\nYou’ll want to update this to:\n\nhttps://knowyogaireland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cropped-logo_wide.png\n\nOr, delete the JetPack plugin from your site.\n\nLastly, I would delete the WooCommerce plugin since you don’t need it, and the cart icon is displaying in your header. (unless you use it for people to pay for your classes.)\n\nThis is just a quick overview.\n\nIt’s a drag the class schedule is not displaying – you’d think this would be the most important thing!\n\nOK. I cleared the cache but am stuck on the second step. You’ll have to forgive me. I can’t follow the link. I’m in the dashboard. The other thing that was driving me crazy is that it asked if I wanted to test Elementor as a site editor and I stupidly said yes and now I can’t get rid of it. But I can’t get past the second of your suggestions because I can’t find the url slug for About me. I’ll keep looking …\n\nI found the permalink and it says ‘about-me’ and I’ll check the trashed page to see if it says the same. I really need to pay someone to do this but I can’t really afford it. The courses and classes page I had to trash because it came up with a fatal error. One step forwards, two steps back… but I’ve said on the front page where I’m teaching. I do want a courses and classes page at some point soon, and to advertise my books, and consultancy work, but slowly, slowly (I’m 55…) … and keep smiling, eh?\n\nYeah. No. You really don’t want me to reach out. I’m miserable already. I just don’t understand what’s going on. I have paid two people to upgrade the site and I don’t understand what they’ve done. I really wanted five pages, home, about me, courses and classes, journal and contact me. When the last person changed it I had all these sub pages. Siteground migrated the site and it was corrupted in small ways which I thought I could fix – no donate buttons, links not working, some corruption in the text – but I’ve spent time I just don’t have battling to correct the errors and each time I just get deeper mired into problems. It’s really not simple from where I’m sitting.\n\nOK. Now the whole site has failed. I just give up. `Your site appears to be down\n\nknowyogaireland.com did not load when Jetpack Monitor last checked on it.\n\nWhat’s happening?\n\nYour site is responding intermittently, or extremely slowly. This can indicate an overloaded, under-powered, or misconfigured server. Your site is probably loading for some users, but not for everyone.\n\nError reference: 200675342/intermittent\n\nWhat should you do now?\n\nStart by visiting your site to see if you’re able to load it. Jetpack Monitor may have just recorded a momentary glitch that’s since been resolved, and you can ignore this email.\n\nIf you’re unable to load your site, check your host’s control panel or contact their support team: they’ll have more detail about what is happening. Be sure to share the error information above with them.\n\nGet more help\n\nControl and monitor these alerts in your Jetpack Monitor settings.\n\nAutomattic, Inc.\n\n60 29th St. #343, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA\n\nManage your email preferences at WordPress.com.`\n\nI see the site is completely down now.\n\n> wanted to test Elementor as a site editor and I stupidly said yes and now I can’t get rid of it\n\nElementor makes me want to run away. It’s awful.\n\n> I found the permalink and it says ‘about-me’ and I’ll check the trashed page\n\nBe sure to go into the Trash – and Permanently Delete them all if you don’t need them.\n\nOtherwise, the URLs will continue to not behave the way you want.\n\n> I have paid two people to upgrade the site and I don’t understand what they’ve done\n\nThat’s a real drag.\n\nPeople like to overcomplicate things bc then a) you back to them to fix it (and pay for it), and b) to make themselves looks smarter than they are!\n\nBased on what I see, you’re entire site should take a good expereinced developer 6 to 8 hours to complete.\n\nThis reply was modified 2 years, 7 months ago by corrinarusso.\n\nThanks but this doesn’t help, sadly.\n\nI came here for help and now I don’t know how to undo what I’ve done.\n\nI deleted a load of plug ins because the site said that if I had inactive plugins it would be subject to attack.\n\nI got a message from Jetpack which I did not delete to say my site was down and to get a security key from somewhere but I can’t get the key.\n\n> I’ve lost the post I wrote\n\n> and the work I did on the About Me page which took me most of yesterday afternoon\n\nI doubt that very much. All the data will still be there if you don’t restore.\n\nYes agree with you – these are all very simple tasks to resolve ‘if you know what you’re doing’."
