        "text": "Would you like to add DNS records for your WP Mail SMTP mailer setup with your domain hosted on SiteGround? Adding the DNS records provided by your mailer helps with domain verification and improves email deliverability.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll walk you through the process of adding DNS records for WP Mail SMTP on SiteGround.\n\nBefore getting started, make sure WP Mail SMTP is installed and activated on your WordPress site.\n\nUnderstanding How DNS Records Work in SMTP\n\nThe Domain Name System (DNS) is like the internet’s address book. DNS provides a means to map a domain name (e.g., example.com) to its corresponding IP address (e.g., 123.123.80.20). Just like how you store a person’s phone number with their name on your smartphone to easily remember them.\n\nDNS records act as a storage system for the settings needed to map a domain name to its corresponding IP address. This means each domain has its unique set of DNS records.\n\nMost mailers in WP Mail SMTP use DNS records as a means to verify your domain on their platform. In some cases, it can be used to improve email deliverability, as in the case of adding SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records.\n\nIn the next sections, we’ll cover the steps for adding DNS records for sites hosted on SiteGround.\n\nAccessing DNS Settings in SiteGround\n\nTo start, log in to your SiteGround hosting dashboard.\n\nAfter logging in to your hosting dashboard, click on Websites in the navigation bar.\n\nOn the next page, you’ll see a list of your domains hosted on SiteGround. Click the SITE TOOLS button under the domain you’d like to add the DNS records.\n\nThis will bring you to the dashboard for the selected domain. From here, select Domain from the sidebar menu.\n\nAfter that, select DNS Zone Editor from the list of options that appear.\n\nThis will take you to the DNS Zone Editor page where you can add new DNS records and manage existing ones.\n\nAdding DNS Records in SiteGround\n\nUnder the Create New Record section, you’ll see options to add A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, SRV, or TXT records. You’ll need to choose the specific record required by your mailer.\n\nAs an example, we’ll add one of the CNAME records SendLayer provides when setting it up with WP Mail SMTP.\n\nTo do so, select the CNAME option from the list of DNS record types in SiteGround.\n\nAfter that, enter the SendLayer Hostname into the Name field in SiteGround.\n\nFor the TTL (Time To Live), select 5 min from the Cache duration settings (TTL) dropdown.\n\nNext, add the SendLayer Value to the Resolves to field.\n\nOnce you’ve added the details for the DNS record, go ahead and click the CREATE button.\n\nAfter adding the first record, repeat the steps above to add the remaining DNS records provided by your mailer.\n\nVerifying Your DNS Records\n\nOnce you’ve added the DNS records to support WP Mail SMTP, we recommend verifying that they’ve been implemented correctly. This step helps ensure optimal email deliverability by confirming that your outgoing emails are authenticated.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to verify your DNS records:\n\nSending a test email: Utilize WP Mail SMTP’s built-in tool for sending a test email. If there’s an issue with your DNS records, an error notification will pop up.\n\nUsing the Site Health tool: The WordPress Site Health tool can help identify any DNS verification problems. If there’s a verification issue with your DNS records, you’ll see a message that provides actions you can take to help resolve it.\n\nTo learn more about using these tools, be sure to check out our complete guide to verifying your DNS records.\n\nThat’s it! Now you know how to add DNS records on domains hosted with SiteGround."
