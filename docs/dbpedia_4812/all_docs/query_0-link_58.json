        "text": "I am also trying to connect a Siteground domain to shopify, but this method doesn't seem to work anymore unless I'm doing it wrong. When I go to DNS settings at siteground, my only option is \"Manage Nameservers,\" where I can change Nameserver1 and Nameserver2 no Cname or A record. I also found some instructions from Siteground saying I should unlock registrar lock and get an EPP code. I did that, and it's been two days and Shopify says my domain is still not verified. What am I doing wrong? I've looked this up online and just keep getting the instructions you gave.\n\nThe bottom line is this: there is no way to add nameservers that will be adequate. Shopify has no nameservers to give you. My solution was to just completely transfer my domains to Shopify. You will have to pay up front for one year, but that isn't very expensive, and then you don't have to renew for a year or more BECAUSE if you've already renewed your domain with Siteground or whomever, paying for a year on Shopify means you are ADDING another year to what you've already paid for. You don't lose that renewal time from the old host. That's something I didn't understand fully. Also, when it comes time to renew your domains, Shopify tends to be cheaper anyway. If you have a bunch of domains to transfer, just do a couple at a time, if that's more comfortable for you. Nothing bad will happen to your domains on the old host in the meantime. That's what I did. You will find that some domains are more expensive to renew (.org, .biz, etc.). It's $14 for a year for .com. You could chat with support to see what the other types cost. I believe the most expensive are .info and .biz, which are between $20-$25 per year. Anyway, this was my solution. It's pretty cheap and a lot less hassle. Believe me, there-are-no-nameservers-you-can-use. And frustratingly, support people and forum users will just keep telling you over and over and over about changing A Records and CNAMES like they just aren't hearing/reading your question. It made me want to bang my head against a wall. Good luck to you."
