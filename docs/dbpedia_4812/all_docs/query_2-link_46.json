        "text": "Why I Use SiteGround — Primary Reasons\n\nWhen I first started out building my own WordPress websites (using self-hosted WordPress.org open source software, not the WordPress.com option), I used Bluehost as my WordPress website hosting provider.\n\nI started with Bluehost based on recommendations from other WordPress pros I knew. And even though I am on SiteGround now, I still think Bluehost is a decent choice for many WordPress users.\n\nMoving from Bluehost to SiteGround\n\nAfter reading and learning more about website hosting, I decided a few years ago to move several sites to SiteGround shared servers. I wanted a performance boost compared to Bluehost, and moving my sites to SiteGround seemed like an affordable way to accomplish that.\n\nHere are several insights into my experience so far with SiteGround.\n\nSmooth Website Transfers\n\nMy experience transferring sites from Bluehost to SiteGround was good. I had a main site (this one) plus a few other sites via ‘add-on domains’, and all of them came over seamlessly as part of a free website transfer service from SiteGround.\n\nSo, effectively, I got several free website transfers in one batch operation from SiteGround support. That was a pleasant surprise!\n\nIf you’re a new customer (with existing sites) just getting started with SiteGround, be sure to ask if they will help move your websites over for free.\n\nIf you’re on WordPress, also see their free plugin for migrating existing WP sites to SiteGround.\n\nSiteGround Site Tools for Simpler Admin\n\nI always found cPanel-based hosting administration to be a bit of a pain, so I was happy when SiteGround moved over to their own in-house ‘Site Tools’ environment for website and hosting maintenance tasks.\n\nThis is a much simpler site admin toolkit and user interface (vs the typical overloaded cPanel workspace), which I think will satisfy the majority of typical SiteGround customers.\n\nI also think the Site Tools admin area is much better for small business owners who don’t spend most of their work time on website admin tasks. SiteT\n\nHere’s a look at the main Site Tools interface. Pin the tools you need the most, while leaving others out of the way (but still very easy to access).\n\nSiteGround Delivers Nearly Perfect Uptime\n\nOver the last few years, I’ve had zero website downtime that I can clearly attribute specifically to SiteGround.\n\nI did suffer a website outage that was Cloudflare CDN and SSL-related, but this turned out to be a Cloudflare settings issue and not really a SiteGround problem.\n\nOn that topic, read more here about how website downtime can hurt your SEO.\n\n(That issue, by the way, is partly what prompted me to try SiteGround’s free CDN.)\n\nPro Tip: Check your Google Search Console crawl errors report from time to time to see if Google’s crawlers have encountered any server outages. They have ‘acceptable limits’ for such things, and you want to stay below those limits. SiteGround’s nearly 100% uptime record will help you here.\n\nExcellent SiteGround Customer Support\n\nI’ve had just a few occasions when I needed quick technical support from SiteGround, and their chat support team came to my rescue each time.\n\nI’ve found their chat support to be quick and efficient, offering site analysis, tips, and hands-on tweaks when needed to fix my rare site issues.\n\nI will note that SiteGround’s chat and phone support options are not exactly front-and-center. I’ve had to hunt a bit for these.\n\nThis is no doubt by design, to help keep SiteGround’s human support staff efficient, not overloaded with ‘simple’ problems, and able to maintain their exceptional support ratings overall.\n\nSiteGround really encourages users to utilize their support articles and knowledge base first, with live chat and phone options secondary.\n\nIn September 2023, SiteGround added new AI (artificial intelligence) capabilities to its support arsenal. Learn about SiteGround’s AI Assistant for customer support here.\n\nAlso, visit the SiteGround Knowledge Base here for common hosting support questions and answers.\n\nThe good news for me: I rarely need to use SiteGround’s support resources, which is great overall. I just need to re-learn how to initiate a chat session each time I really need it.\n\nTightly Integrated SiteGround-Developed Features\n\nMore recently, I’ve started to think about SiteGround as sort of like the ‘Apple’ of website hosting.\n\nApple is famous for its tightly integrated tech ecosystem, and it seems that SiteGround has taken a page or two from the Apple playbook and philosophy.\n\nThroughout this post, you’ll see highlights covering several SiteGround features and capabilities that are built in-house by their engineers and software devs.\n\nIn addition to pure hosting services, SiteGround offers an integrated site speed optimization plugin, an integrated CDN, integrated security scanning and other defense mechanisms against bad internet actors, customized ultrafast PHP and MySQL, and now an integrated email marketing service.\n\nHence my thinking about SiteGround as an ‘Apple-like’ hosting company. They have lots of in-house developed components that are designed to work perfectly together while hiding the complexity from website admins.\n\nLike Apple, SiteGround has a large global fan base of loyal users and supporters. And some who don’t care for SiteGround, for various reasons.\n\nIntegration and Flexibility — You Can Have Both with SiteGround\n\nBut, unlike Apple, which has a famously locked-down device ecosystem (and premium pricing to match), SiteGround does not lock you into using its various add-ons.\n\nFor example, if you prefer another 3rd-party CDN to the SiteGround CDN, go ahead and use it. The same goes for the SiteGround caching and speed optimization plugin, the security plugin, or SiteGround’s email marketing services.\n\nIf you find better options than what SiteGround offers, go ahead and use them with your SiteGround-hosted website.\n\nYou’ll still get all the baseline advantages that come with every SiteGround hosting account.\n\nMoving right along, here are more of the main reasons I like and use SiteGround today.\n\nFree SSL Certificates for HTTPS\n\nLike many hosting providers, SiteGround also offers free SSL certificates with its hosting plans.\n\nI have free SSL certificates from SiteGround on multiple sites now and have had no problems with them.\n\nThey have been renewing automatically, so I have not had to intervene manually, other than to check periodically that they are still active and not set to expire.\n\nPro Tip: Consider using good SEO audit software tools to detect any HTTPS issues with your website. Also, check your Google Search Console ‘Experience’ reports for any HTTPS problems noted there.\n\nBuilt-In Caching and Speed Optimization\n\nThe SiteGround-developed speed optimization plugin for WordPress does a good job in all the main aspects of website caching. Main features include:\n\nCaching — Based on SiteGround’s advanced ‘SuperCacher’ technology, including static and dynamic caching, file-based caching, and memcache for faster database queries\n\nWordPress Environment Optimizations — A group of settings for a more secure and efficient website environment, including HTTPS enforcement\n\nFrontend Optimizations — Settings to optimize CSS, JavaScript, and other code elements. Includes minify, combine, preload, defer, and other options as appropriate. Can also optimize and pre-load fonts, do DNS pre-fetch for external domains, and configure other speed-maximizing tweaks.\n\nMedia Optimizations — Image compression, using compact WebP images, Lazy Loading, and related settings to reduce page sizes and load times.\n\nSite Performance — A simple utility to test specific URL page speed using Google’s PageSpeed Insights tools (without leaving the plugin interface)\n\nOther 3rd-party WordPress caching plugins are also known to be good, either alone or in some careful combination with the SiteGround Optimizer plugin.\n\nI currently use the SG Optimizer by itself, with no other 3rd-party caching plugins.\n\nI also use ShortPixel for image optimizations, typically before uploading images to the WordPress media library. As a result, I don’t use the image optimizations provided by the SiteGround plugin.\n\nPro Tip: Learn more here about website image optimization tips, plus how to do a WordPress image SEO audit.\n\nFast Page Loading Times (Low TTFB, etc.)\n\nYour website loading time is the most obvious visible end result of your hosting environment and website structure and content, so all of these areas need to be in good shape for a positive user experience — and potential SEO benefits related to website hosting.\n\nHere are some example GTmetrix page performance stats for one of my typical blog posts, served by my SiteGround hosting environment.\n\nRelated: Get SiteGround’s free guide to speeding up WordPress websites, including 25 expert tips for a faster WordPress site.\n\nWebsite Hosting Is Just One Aspect of Page Speed\n\nRemember that having super-fast website hosting is just one component of page speed and loading times.\n\nOther factors — such as page design and structure, using page builders (or not), image sizing and quantity, video embeds, etc., all play important roles in page speed.\n\nUse good website SEO auditing tools, as well as speed-testing tools like PageSpeed Insights and GTmetrix, to get a complete picture of your website’s loading times and speed-related problem areas.\n\nPage Speed Improvements and Diminishing Marginal Returns\n\nFor some websites (e.g., large e-commerce sites), achieving every possible page speed improvement can be worthwhile, providing measurable direct impacts on user engagement, conversions, revenue, etc.\n\nFor many sites, however, there is definitely a point of diminishing marginal returns for making page speed improvements.\n\nIn other words, spending time, effort, and money on squeezing out another 100 milliseconds of loading speed may not produce any measurable business improvements.\n\nNo measurable impact on search rankings or clicks (SEO effects), no discernible change in user behaviors, site revenue, etc.\n\nThis is of course a site-specific issue. You’ll have to decide for yourself when a ‘fast enough’ website is also good enough for your website and business goals.\n\nFree Automatic Daily Backups\n\nKnowing that your entire website is being backed up daily is a good feeling.\n\nThat’s another thing I like about SiteGround. They back up my site for free and keep a month’s worth of daily backups available (via Site Tools) for quick restoration if needed.\n\nUse SiteGround’s Manual Backups Too\n\nIn addition to SiteGround’s automatic daily backups, you can (and should) use their manual backup option as well.\n\nFor example, when you’re busy making lots of changes or new content additions to your site and then also want to update WordPress core files, themes, or plugins, it’s really smart to make a manual backup immediately before making major WordPress updates.\n\nTrust me, I learned this the hard way and was properly reminded (‘schooled’) by the helpful SiteGround chat support expert.\n\nAfter a WordPress update problem (initiated by me) that took my site down, I restored the previous day’s backup but lost a day’s worth of content work that I had to redo.\n\nI could have easily avoided the rework simply by taking advantage of SiteGround’s painless manual backup feature before making major WordPress updates.\n\nNote: SiteGround’s manual ‘on demand’ backup feature is available at the GrowBig and higher plan levels.\n\nHere’s what the SiteGround Backup and Restore admin area looks like. It has a simple, user-friendly interface, like other tools in their Site Tools collection.\n\nFree Daily Site Security Scanning\n\nSiteGround has a number of in-house, proprietary tools and firewalls deployed to protect against malware, hackers, and other bad actors that may try to compromise your web presence.\n\nThis happens at the infrastructure level, behind the scenes and not visible or obvious to website owners or admins.\n\nThey also provide a security scanning service, powered by Sucuri, with both free and paid options.\n\nSee below for the main SiteGround Site Scanner admin interface.\n\nThe free version of this add-on service focuses on daily URL scanning. The premium version adds advanced file scanning for more complete protection, including automated scanning of new files uploaded.\n\nRelated: Get SiteGround’s free ‘best practices’ guide to keeping your WordPress site secure, including 25 expert security tips for WordPress.\n\nSiteGround’s Free/Premium CDN — Global Site Speedup\n\nAfter partnering with CDN-provider Cloudflare for quite a while, SiteGround launched its own in-house developed CDN service (content delivery network), with both free and paid options.\n\nI started with the free SiteGround CDN and then used a CDN promo offer to upgrade to the paid plan.\n\nThe transition from using Cloudflare (free level) to SiteGround’s CDN was quick and painless. I experienced zero downtime while making the switch, and my website performance seems as good or better than it was when I was on the Cloudflare CDN.\n\nThe SiteGround CDN (physical network) is not as large as Cloudflare’s, and it may be lacking some of Cloudflare’s more advanced premium and enterprise-class features, but it’s a quick and easy-to-use CDN solution for SiteGround customers who just want a basic and robust CDN to better serve a global website audience.\n\nUltrafast PHP and Custom MySQL\n\nI was originally using SiteGround’s feature to automatically manage the PHP version of my sites, and this worked fine for a long time. It was a simple ‘set it and forget it’ option for me.\n\nI then took their advice to try the Ultrafast PHP setup developed by SiteGround, which promises to significantly reduce TTFB and cut overall page loading times by up to 30%.\n\nNote: SiteGround’s custom PHP implementation is available at the GrowBig and higher plan levels.\n\nIn addition to having an in-house turbocharged PHP, SiteGround’s MySQL customizations help database-driven sites achieve greatly improved SQL query response times."
