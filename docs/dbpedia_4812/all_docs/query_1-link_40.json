        "text": "SiteGround claim to host more than 2,800,000 domains. However, every day, we encounter SiteGround customers who are looking for an alternative hosting solution for their great domain name that provides better performance with higher quality and responsive support. So if you’re not happy with your SiteGround domain registrar — no need to worry! You can easily transfer your domain to another registrar. One of the best things about transferring your domain over to FastComet is that you can manage all your domain settings and billing from your FastComet account. You will have everything you need in one place. Additionally, you can use the domain name as a Private DNS, or you can choose to set it up with Google Apps. Furthermore, we send all our clients emails when their domains are close to expiration to avoid any downtime because of missed domain renewal. You will be no exception.\n\nHere at FastComet, we make it super easy to transfer a domain registered with SiteGround by guiding you through each step with simple instructions.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nPrepare to Transfer the Domain Safely and Easily\n\nReview Domain Name Transfer Requirements\n\nSteps to Transfer A Domain From SiteGround\n\nUnlock the Domain Name\n\nObtain EPP/Authorization Key\n\nPurchase Your FastComet Hosting Plan\n\nUpdate the Nameservers to Point to FastComet\n\nSubmit a Domain Transfer Request to FastComet\n\nCheck the Status of a Domain Transfer\n\nPrepare to Transfer the Domain Safely and Easily\n\nBefore you continue with the domain transfer, take note that whenever a domain name is transferred away, the nameservers associated with it stay the same during its transfer from one registrar to another. Say your domain is using the default SiteGround nameservers, they will be preserved during the domain transfer, which is why you will not be able to change them until the transfer is finalized.\n\nThis means that if you switched to another web hosting provider and your website was already migrated, make sure that your domain name is pointed to the new hosting provider before initiating a domain transfer. Again, you won’t be able to change the nameservers until the domain transfer is complete.\n\nKeep in mind that Domain Name Registration and Web Hosting are two separate services. The domain name transfer process will not migrate your website automatically. If you’re a FastComet customer and you want to transfer your website from SiteGround, go ahead and submit a migration request from your client area. Our transfer experts will move your existing website(s) and email(s) free of charge, seamlessly, and without any downtime.\n\nThe details listed here are only for transferring your domain’s registration to another registrar. The transferring of the hosting for your site is a completely different process. Read more about the process in the following article: How to transfer your website to FastComet.\n\nReview Domain Name Transfer Requirements\n\nDue to ICANN's Transfer Policy, domain names must have been registered for more than 60 days in order for them to be eligible for transfer. This 60-day registrar lock is to prevent fraud and theft of domains;\n\nYou cannot transfer your domain if it's within 60 days of а previous transfer;\n\nUsually, the domain name should have more than 15 days before its expiration date.\n\nFor more thorough information, you can check our tutorial on domain transfer requirements.\n\nPrior to attempting to transfer a domain away from SiteGround, you must complete the following steps.\n\nSteps to Transfer A Domain From SiteGround\n\nYou should start by accessing your SiteGround account where your domain is currently registered.\n\nTo transfer your domain to another registrar, follow these steps:\n\nUnlock the Domain Name\n\nTo unlock the domain, you need to follow the steps below:\n\nLog into your Client Area → Services → Domains:\n\nNext, click the 3 dots to the right of the domain you wish to transfer.\n\nIn the menu that appears, click Manage Domain:\n\nThe Domain Management area will open. To the right of the renew button, click the 3 dots to open the menu, then click Registrar Lock:\n\nThe registrar lock modal will appear. Be sure the registrar lock is toggled OFF, then click Confirm to save:\n\nInitiate the transfer at your new registrar and regularly check the administrative email for your domain.\n\nYou can find the valid administrative e-mail for your domain name by using the WHOIS lookup tool available here. If this tool shows the administrative email is [email protected] or similar, you have to change it to yours in order to complete the transfer. This can be done from your Client Area → Services → Domains → Manage next to the domain you want to transfer. There change the email address for your domain name.\n\nIf you have Domain Privacy activated for your domain, and the gaining registrar fails to send a message to your administrative e-mail account you should cancel it. This can be completed from your Client Area → Services. Allow up to several hours for the modification to propagate and the real administrative e-mail account will be shown in the WHOIS lookup.\n\nUp until April 2021, removing the Domain ID Protection (aka Domain Privacy, Private Registration, etc.) was one of the requirements for a domain transfer. The requirement was in place because when you transfer a domain name from another registrar to FastComet, ICANN requires us to send a transfer verification email to the current registrant's email address. In case you initiate a domain transfer while still having ID Protection enabled at your current domain registrar, there is a high probability the transfer verification email won't be delivered. That has now changed. As of April 2021, you do not need to pause or disable Domain ID Protection when you transfer your domain name. The domain transfer can proceed with ID Protection enabled.\n\nObtain EPP/Authorization Key\n\nWhen you're at the Manage My Domain screen, to the right of the renew button, click the 3 dots to open the menu, then go Get EPP Code → Send Code:\n\nThe EPP Code will be sent to the domain’s primary registrant’s email address.\n\nPurchase Your FastComet Hosting Plan\n\nThe first thing you should do (if you haven’t already) is to choose from our hosting plans. You can check our price list on your own, but you should consider contacting one of FastComet’s Customer Care specialists, who will help you pick the best plan for your online project.\n\nOnce you have chosen your starting plan with FastComet, you can click on the GET STARTED button:\n\nNext, choose the option “I already Have a Domain,” and then click on the USE THIS DOMAIN button:\n\nYou will get to a screen where you have to input all your contact and billing info. Make sure that all the information is correct. Once you are ready, please go through our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you agree with our terms, check the box, and finish by clicking on the button COMPLETE ORDER:\n\nThe transfer needs time to process. As your previous provider should release the domain to FastComet, it is a good idea to point your domain to the FastComet nameservers or via A record to the IP address, provided to you in your Welcome email, so that be able to start working on your website.\n\nChanging your name servers while your domain is being transferred may cause the transfer to fail. Be sure that you have updated your name servers before the transfer begins so that your domain will be working as soon as possible.\n\nSubmit a Domain Transfer Request to FastComet\n\nAs you may have already seen during purchasing your FastComet hosting plan, we provide domain transfer services to all existing customers. After transferring your domain to FastComet you get access to our user-friendly domain management interface and you can take full control of your domain.\n\nTo initiate the transfer process for your domain name, please make sure that you have access to your domain administrative email address. In case you no longer have access to that email address you may request to have that email changed by your current domain registrar.\n\nWhen you have done everything in this post up until now and you are sure that all requirements are met, continue with the following steps:\n\nLogin to your FastComet Client Area;\n\nClick on the Domain Transfer link under the Domains section in your Client Area:\n\nInput your domain and select your domain extension to check if the domain transfer is available for your domain:\n\nIf you don’t find your extension on the list, contact our technical support for further information. You can do that by submitting a new support ticket.\n\nIf your domain is available for transfer, click on the Add to Cart button to proceed:\n\nInsert your Authorization (EPP) Code in the field shown in this screenshot:\n\nIf all requirements for the successful domain transfer are met, you should receive your domain transfer confirmation email shortly.\n\nCheck the Status of a Domain Transfer"
