Geographical proximity helps reduce the number of hops and Internet connections, hence impacts the loading times experienced by your users. For example, if the majority of your visitors are strictly North-American, it is recommended that your host server is located in North America as well. However, if your visitors are scattered globally, then the data center locations don’t have such an impact and you may activate a service called CDN in order to speed your site for all of your visitors."
