From the list of your websites, locate the one you want to check and click the kebab menu, then press the Website Settings button.\n\nThen click on the kebab menu and select Server Details.\n\nThe light-box which will appear on the screen will display the IP address of the website, and its Name Servers (NS 1 and NS 2).\n\nTo see IPs of the nameservers, go to Website Settings > click on the kebab menu and select Server Details. Then click the Show IP Addresses button.\n\nWhen you point your name servers to SiteGround, your domain DNS records (A record, MX records, CNAME record, and all) and emails will be managed from your SiteGround account from thereon.\n\nIf you have any custom DNS records you need to keep, you can use the DNS Zone Editor in your Client Area to set them before you change the name servers."
