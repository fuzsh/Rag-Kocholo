        "text": "As a web host, SiteGround provides the foundation of hardware, software and service you need to publish a website online. SiteGround hosts your website’s files on its servers and the internet, which allows anyone accessing your site to see it.\n\nA website is vital for any business to have to increase current and potential customer awareness of your company. A digital presence can help you be found locally for brick-and-mortar businesses and is paramount for e-commerce businesses. Individuals use websites to host their résumés, photos or announcements for events. It’s one of the best ways to communicate anything to a large group of people.\n\nWordPress, a content management system (CMS), is one of the most popular platforms on which you can build a website. SiteGround offers managed WordPress hosting as a package, which costs a bit more than its standard shared hosting but makes it easier for new users to run a website. SiteGround handles all the updates and maintenance of the CMS, so you don’t have to worry about security exploits.\n\nAlthough SiteGround offers free domains with all of its shared, WordPress and WooCommerce hosting packages, you may already have a domain you want to use. Connecting your domain to SiteGround is easy enough, and the web host offers a WordPress installer that further simplifies the migration process.\n\nFeatured Partners\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1\n\nBluehost\n\nStarting price\n\n$1.99 per month\n\nStorage Limit\n\nUnmetered bandwidth, SSD storage starts at 10GB\n\nStandout Features\n\nFree domain name & SSL for a year\n\n1\n\nBluehost\n\nLearn More\n\nOn Bluehost.com's Website\n\n2\n\nHostGator\n\nStarting Price\n\n$2.75 per month (for first 36 months)\n\nMoney-Back Guarantee\n\n30 days\n\nStandout Features\n\nFree SSL certificate, free website transfer\n\n2\n\nHostGator\n\nLearn More\n\nOn HostGator's Website\n\n3\n\nWeb.com\n\nStarting price\n\n$2.75 per month\n\nWebsite Building\n\nYes\n\nStandout Features\n\nCustomizable templates, Easy drag-and-drop technology, SSL certificate\n\n3\n\nWeb.com\n\nLearn More\n\nOn Web.com's Website\n\nStorage and Bandwidth Limits\n\nSiteGround limits storage and the number of site visitors per plan, which is uncommon. The StartUp plan only allows 10GB of storage, which is low compared to most other web hosts. Upgrade one level to double your web space to 20GB, or bump it up to GoGeek, which will get you 40GB. Although it seems stingy, these allowances should be enough for most small businesses.\n\nAlthough SiteGround doesn’t offer unlimited bandwidth, it does allow unmetered traffic. It doesn’t mean you can be hit with a spike of traffic and expect your site to load quickly or not crash. The data you transfer is defined as your site’s content and your visitor traffic. So your host isn’t going to monitor how much data your site transfers but your speed may be affected.\n\nSiteGround estimates that you’ll have a limit of 10,000, 25,000 or 100,000 site visitors per month, which is generous. Most web hosts won’t put a limit on site visitors, but this is a good way to quantify what bandwidth should look like for most individual or small business websites.\n\nFree CDN\n\nAll plans include a free CDN feature from Cloudflare. Some of SiteGround’s competitors offer this feature as a plugin in the control panel, and it’s free to use up to a certain point. SiteGround puts a larger emphasis on speed, so it highlights the CDN and other features that increase site response times.\n\nHaving a global network of servers that essentially host copies of your site makes it easier for users from all corners of the world to quickly access your site. So, if your site lives on a server in Chicago, and someone from Finland goes to your website, a CDN ensures your site loads quickly because there’s a copy of it on a server nearer to Finland.\n\nUsing SiteGround as your web host with the Cloudflare CDN can also help protect against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, thanks to the distributed traffic among other servers.\n\nCloud Hosting\n\nSiteGround doesn’t offer virtual private servers (VPS) or dedicated hosting, unlike many of the best web hosts. It does offer cloud hosting, though. So, if you find you’re outgrowing a shared hosting plan, there’s no medium plan, such as a VPS. You’ll have to move directly into a cloud hosting plan, which starts at $100 per month.\n\nWith cloud hosting, you won’t have a physical server all your own, as with a dedicated server. It’s essentially the same, though. SiteGround’s lowest-priced cloud hosting plan starts you with four CPU cores, 8GB of RAM and 40GB of storage. If you need more processing power, RAM or storage, you can configure that and pay only for what you need.\n\nExtras and Inclusions\n\nSiteGround offers several extras at no added charge. The company has recently included a free domain name for the first year for all shared hosting packages. You can also expect a free secure sockets layer (SSL) certificate, free CDN, site statistics, multiple caching options (static and dynamic), free email and a free email migrator.\n\nEase of Use\n\nSiteGround makes everything easy to do, from ordering a service to installing an app. Choosing a plan is self-explanatory, and you can pick your term length before checking out. The marketplace includes extras you may want to add, including a premium CDN, dedicated IP and domain privacy.\n\nUser Dashboard/cPanel\n\nThe dashboard to your account is a reimagined version of cPanel. The site tools you use most get pinned to the top, or you can set which tools you want to pin. You get a one-click install for some of the most popular apps added to websites, including WordPress, Drupal, OpenCart, Moodle and osTicket. All the tools are aptly named, such as SSL Manager, Backups and Site Scanner, so it’s easy to figure out what to use.\n\nSecurity\n\nThere are multiple security features you employ from your SiteGround account, including backups, SSL certificates and a site scanner. The backup manager lets you create up to five manual backups (on mid- and high-tier plans) to save on the server in addition to the automatic daily backups the system creates. You can access up to about a month’s worth of backups at any time.\n\nThe protected URLs option lets you password-protect a page that you want to keep from the public. You can add a premium SSL certificate or manage your current SSL certificates under security. And you can block specific IPs or countries from accessing your website, if needed.\n\nSiteGround’s site scanner acts as an antivirus for your website. It’s a paid add-on that lets you scan your site for any malware.

You get one website, 10GB of disk space and data transfer is unmetered but allows up to about 10,000 site visits per month. You get a domain name free for the first year ($19.99 per year thereafter) and a free SSL certificate.\n\nSiteGround provides free daily backups, use of a CDN for free and as many professional emails as you need. The cPanel is simple to use and includes one-click installs of WordPress and other CMS. There’s a 30-day money-back guarantee with this plan and it includes 24/7 support via tickets, phone or live chat.\n\nSiteGround GrowBig\n\nSiteGround’s GrowBig plan is a great pick for small businesses with multiple websites because it doesn’t limit how many websites you can create and host and you get 20GB of disk space. Your unmetered bandwidth translates to about 100,000 site visitors per month and you get all the same extras as in the StartUp plan.\n\nNew features include on-demand backup, which allows you to create up to five manual backups of your sites, a staging environment for developers and 30% faster PHP, which affects your page load speed.\n\nSiteGround GoGeek\n\nThe GoGeek plan includes everything in the other two shared hosting plans, but SiteGround increases your disk space to 40GB and unmetered bandwidth allows for around 400,000 site visits per month. Additional perks include Git integration for site developers, white labeling of your account (helpful for agencies selling sites and site design), a private DNS to brand your name servers (so it looks like you own the host server) and priority support, which puts you at the front of the line for support issues.\n\nSiteGround A2 Hosting Hostwinds IONOS\n\nForbes Advisor Rating\n\nStarting Price\n\n$2.99 per month\n\n$2.99 per month\n\n$5.24 per month\n\n$1 per month\n\nContract Length\n\nOne month, 12 months, 24 months\n\nOne month, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months\n\nOne month, three months, six months, 24 months, 36 months\n\nOne month, 12 months\n\nStorage Limit\n\n10GB\n\n100GB\n\nUnlimited\n\n10GB\n\nBandwidth Limit\n\nUnmetered\n\nUnlimited\n\nUnlimited\n\nUnlimited\n\nFree Domain Name\n\n✔ ($19.99 per year after first year)\n\nX\n\nX\n\n✔ ($40 per year after first year)\n\nFree SSL Certificate\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\nBusiness Email\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\n✔\n\nUptime Guarantee\n\n99.90%\n\n99.90%\n\n100.00%\n\n99.90%\n\nMoney-back Guarantee\n\n30 days\n\n30 days\n\nProrated refund (after 72 hours)\n\n30 days\n\nCustomer Support\n\n24/7 live chat, phone, ticket system\n\n24/7 live chat, phone, ticket system\n\n24/7 live chat, ticket system\n\n24/7 live chat, phone, ticket system\n\nLearn More\n\n–\n\n–\n\nRead Reviews\n\n–\n\nAlthough this SiteGround review shows that it’s a great choice for fast, reliable web hosting, it isn’t always the best choice overall. Still, when you compare SiteGround alternatives, you may find that SiteGround is worth the extra cost.\n\nSiteGround vs. A2 Hosting\n\nThe obvious standout here with A2 Hosting is its disk space offering for the low-tier plan because it gives you 10 times more gigabytes than SiteGround. However, its regular pricing is almost as much as SiteGround and it offers “unlimited” bandwidth, which is misleading—there’s always a limit, even if you don’t see it. Plus, SiteGround gives you a free domain for the first year.\n\nSiteGround vs. Hostwinds\n\nIf you’re looking for a more affordable web host, Hostwinds is a better pick than SiteGround. With that said, you won’t get a free domain for the first year if you choose Hostwinds and its unlimited space and bandwidth could be more limiting than you realize. Additionally, Hostwinds’ refund policy is confusing and you won’t get a full amount back if you aren’t satisfied while SiteGround has a solid 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nSiteGround vs. IONOS\n\nComparing SiteGround to IONOS is difficult because it’s almost a tie with the features we highlight above. IONOS is more affordable and both web hosts give you a free domain the first year but the domain renewal cost is double for IONOS than SiteGround. That alone could make SiteGround a better pick for you—especially if you take advantage of a long-term introductory rate.\n\nRelated: SiteGround Vs.
