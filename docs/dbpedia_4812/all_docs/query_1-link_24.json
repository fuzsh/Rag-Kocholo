        "text": "Historically, SiteGround has not offered a free domain name with hosting. However, for February 2023, SiteGround offers a free domain name with SiteGround’s shared hosting.\n\nIt is still being determined how long this offer will last, so we recommend you take advantage of it while you can. However, be assured that we will update this article if the offer changes.\n\nIn this article, we will show you the following:\n\nWhat domain extensions qualify for the free domain offer.\n\nHow much you will save by taking advantage of the offer.\n\nHow to get a free domain with SiteGround.\n\nBrief summary of how easy it is to manage your domain with SiteGround.\n\nFinally, we will answer some frequently asked questions about the offer.\n\nLet’s get started.\n\nWhat domain extensions qualify as free domains at SiteGround?\n\nThe exact domain extensions that qualify for the free domain offer depend on your location. For instance, .co.uk is only free for UK customers.\n\nHowever, the most popular domain extensions are free for all customers, including .com, .org, .biz, .info, .nl, and .net.\n\nWhen you sign up for SiteGround, any domains that are part of the offer will be displayed in a green box under the “Popular” heading. When you select a domain, the price will be displayed as “Free”.\n\nHere is a screenshot showing the free domain extensions for UK customers:\n\nTMD Hosting Domain Pricing: How much can you save with a free domain?\n\nThe table below gives you an idea of how much you can save (versus SiteGround domain renewal prices):\n\nExtensionPrice.com$19.99.org$21.99.biz$19.99.info$24.99.nl$17.99.net$21.99.co.uk (UK only)£14.99\n\nIt gets even cheaper if you deduct the monthly cost of a .com domain of $1.67 ($19.99 / 12) from the first year hosting cost.\n\nThe table below gives you an idea of the effective monthly hosting cost for the first year of a 12-month GrowBig plan:\n\nPricing PlanPromo Code PriceFirst Year Effective PriceShared$4.99$3.32\n\nHow to get a free domain with SiteGround\n\nTo get a free domain with SiteGround, you must sign up for a hosting plan. The free domain is only available with their shared hosting plans.\n\nYou must order your domain at the point of signing up to include it in your hosting plan. You cannot add a free domain to an existing hosting plan or add a free domain later.\n\nIf you need inspiration for your domain, check out our list of random domain name generators.\n\nYou can find a complete list of SiteGround’s current deals here.\n\nRight, let’s get that free domain right now.\n\nHow to Get a Free Domain with SiteGround\n\nSign up for a SiteGround Hosting Plan.\n\nClick the link below to be taken to SiteGround’s shared hosting page.\n\nGet up to 80% off and a free domain with SiteGround’s shared hosting plans.\n\nIf the offer is active, you will see a banner at the top of the page stating the initial discount plus the free domain.\n\nSee the screenshot below to see what the offer looks like.\n\nChoose your plan\n\nIf you scroll down the page, you will see the pricing tables for the different hosting plans. Again, you will clearly see that a free domain is included with all hosting plans.\n\nThe first “StartUp” only allows one website on the account and has limited resources (sufficient for approximately 10k visitors per month).\n\nThe other plans allow unlimited websites and significantly more resources (sufficient for approximately 100k visitors per month).\n\nYou can check all the differences between the two plans by clicking the “Compare Hosting Plans” link underneath the pricing tables.\n\nWe recommend the “GrowBig” plan in most cases, as this will give your more resources, 30% faster PHP, site staging, and on-demand backup copies.\n\nOnce you have decided on your chosen plan, click “Get Plan”.\n\nChoose your Free Domain\n\nHere, you can choose your free domain, use a premium extension, or use a domain you already own.\n\nAs discussed previously, the free domain extensions are located in the green box under the “Popular” heading. You will see this list by clicking on the drop-down menu for the domain extension.\n\nChoose your domain extension and enter your domain name.\n\nThen click “Proceed”. You will be taken to the next step if your domain is available.\n\nCheck your order and enter billing information\n\nThere are a few things that you should check here before using completing your purchase:\n\nHosting plan - Make sure you choose the right hosting plan for your needs.\n\nLocation - We recommend you choose a location close to most of your visitors. This increases website performance as your website files have less distance to travel from the server to the user.\n\nBilling period - With the discount on SiteGround hosting, the longer you pay upfront, the more you save. Make sure the SiteGround discount is applied. The discount only applies to the 12-monthly plans.\n\nExtra services - Most web hosts will try and up-sell with additional services, and SiteGround is no different. Choose carefully, as this will increase the price of your hosting. Here you will see that your free domain is included in the price.\n\nOnce you have checked all the information and entered all your billing and personal information, proceed to payment.\n\nManaging your Free Domain at SiteGround\n\nManaging your domain at SiteGround is very easy with their client area and their custom-built control panel called Site Tools.\n\nYou will find further information about the relevant parts of these interfaces via the links below:\n\nSiteGround Client Area: Here you can manage nameservers, auto-renew, and other domain settings.\n\nSiteGround Site Tools: Here, you can add parked domains, subdomains, and redirects. You can also manage DNS records.\n\nHowever, as you have purchased your domain with SiteGround, your domain should be automatically configured to work with your hosting account once you create your website.\n\nSiteGround Free Domain FAQs\n\nWhat is the SiteGround free domain offer?\n\nThe SiteGround free domain offer is a promotional deal that gives you a free domain for one year.\n\nWho is the free SiteGround domain name offer available for?\n\nThe SiteGround free domain offer is available to new and existing customers when you sign up for a new hosting product.\n\nI made a mistake when choosing the domain name. Can I change it?\n\nAccording to SiteGround’s refund policy, domain names are not refundable. Here is what they say:\n\nDomain name fees are not refundable and may be due upon cancellation, even if waived initially as part of a special promotion.\n\nI didn't register a free domain on sign-up. Can I still get a free domain?\n\nNo, you must choose your free domain when you sign up.\n\nI have a domain at another registrar. Can I transfer it and take advantage of the free domain offer.\n\nNo. Their offer during the sign-up process is only for new domains."
