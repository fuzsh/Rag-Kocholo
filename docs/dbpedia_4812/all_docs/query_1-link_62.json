        "text": "This guide explains how to transfer a domain from Siteground.\n\n1. Please check your domain contact information is correct, especially the administrator's email address as all emails regarding the transfer will go to there.\n\nLogin to your SiteGround User Area.\n\nGo to the My Accounts tab.\n\nGo to the Domains section.\n\nClick the 3 dots to the right of the corresponding domain name.\n\nClick Manage Domain.\n\nOn the new page you will be able to edit this information.\n\n2. Unlock your domain:\n\nLog in your SiteGround User Area.\n\nGo to the Domains section.\n\nClick the 3 dots to the right of the corresponding domain name.\n\nClick Manage Domain.\n\nThere will be a link \"Registrar Lock\" next to the Status of the domain name.\n\nChange the status to \"Off\", the toggle should be to the left.\n\nClick confirm.\n\n3. Obtaining an authorisation code:\n\nLog into your SiteGround User Area.\n\nGo to the Domains section.\n\nClick the 3 dots to the right of the corresponding domain name.\n\nClick Manage Domain.\n\nThe EPP Code section is marked \"Get EPP code\".\n\nClick \"Send code\".\n\nOnce you click this, you will get an email to the administrator's email address with your EPP code on.\n\n4. Transferring a .uk Domain:\n\nLog in to your User Area.\n\nGo to the My Accounts tab.\n\nGo to the Domains section.\n\nClick the 3 dots to the right of the corresponding domain name.\n\nClick Manage Domain.\n\nLastly, Select Domain Name Tag and update this to STACK.\n\n5. Initiate the transfer by ordering the transfer through lyricalhost.com:\n\nSelect 'Domains' at the top of the site.\n\nSelect 'Transfer in a Domain' on the left hand side.\n\nEnter your domain name and the authorisation code (This is not required for .uk domains).\n\nSelect 'Add to Cart'.\n\nThis will charge you the equivalent of one years renewal of the domain, as we have to renew the domain during transfer.\n\nDon't worry - you will not lose any time you already have left on the domain, instead you will obtain an extra year on top of the expiry date.\n\nPlease note the domain transfer will take up to five full days to complete. Keep an eye on your emails as any information will be sent to the Administrative contact.\n\ndomain, domain names, domain transfer, transfer\n\n7 Users Found This Useful\n\nWas this answer helpful?"
