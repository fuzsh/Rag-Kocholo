        "text": "Description\n\nSiteGround Migrator: the easiest way to move your site to SiteGround\n\nThis plugin is designed to automate the transfer of a WordPress instance to a SiteGround hosting account. It can’t be used to transfer a WordPress instance to another hosting provider.\n\nImportant: This solution is not suitable for migrating localhost WordPress sites or for Full Multisite installations (separate Multisite blogs are fine).\n\nHow to Use\n\nFirst, you need to get a transfer token from your SiteGround account. You can do this through the WordPress Migrator tool located in the WordPress section of your SiteGround hosting control panel.\n\nOnce you select the domain name that you want to initiate the transfer for, our system will generate a transfer token for you.Paste the token in your SiteGround Migrator plugin and press Initiate Transfer. That’s all!\n\nScreenshots\n\nInstallation\n\nAutomatic Installation\n\nVisit Plugins -> Add New\n\nSearch for “SiteGround Migrator”\n\nActivate SiteGround Migrator from your Plugins page.\n\nGo to Plugins -> Activate SiteGround Migrator.\n\nManual Installation\n\nUpload the “siteground-migrator” folder to the “/wp-content/plugins/” directory\n\nActivate the SiteGround Migrator plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress\n\nGo to Plugins -> Activate SiteGround Migrator.\n\nWP-CLI Support\n\nIn version 1.0.13 we’ve added WP-CLI command for migrations.\n\nwp migrator start transfertoken –email=your@email.com\n\nFAQ\n\nDoes it work with Localhost environments?\n\nWe download your site content directly on the SiteGround server, that’s why we can’t access your content if it’s hosted on a local environment.\n\nDoes it work with WordPress.com?\n\nNo, the plugin is designed to migrate from stand-alone WordPress installations. If you want to migrate from WordPress.com, please check the Guided Transfer service they offer.\n\nDoes it work with Multisite?\n\nDue to the complexity of MS sites we don’t migrate full MS networks at this point. However, separate blogs from a MS network can be migrated successfully.\n\nWhat content is migrated?\n\nWe move only your WordPress content – themes, plugins, uploads. If you have other applications or content outside WordPress it will not be migrated\n\nDoes it work only with cPanel hosts?\n\nNo, we strive to make our plugin work flawlessly on every hosting environment.\n\nTransfer is completed but I didn’t get a notification?\n\nThe plugin uses your current site admin email to notify you that the transfer is completed. If it fails to send emails you may not receive one upon completion.\n\nI am getting transfer errors, now what?\n\nUnfortunately, our plugin works on environments that we have no control over. That’s why it can fail or some hosts. In such cases, please contact our support team via a ticket in your Help Desk and we will assist you further!\n\nReviews\n\n1 reply\n\nI have tried to use this plugin so many times, with so many different websites, and never once have I ever had this be successful. I always end up manually migrating sites.\n\nMy first site migration I did with the plugin UpDraft Plus, but this migration tool works much better! Love the ease of use and speed that it works.\n\n1 reply\n\nThis is one of the main reasons for me going with SG, but I find myself transferring manually more and more. Garbage.\n\nI’ve used this plugin a couple of times in the last week. It went perfectly both times.\n\nJust started using this plugin and so far so good. It is user friendly and definitely hassle free. If things change I will add a new review.\n\nI have used this plugin over a dozen times on large sites and small and it always performs exactly as advertised.\n\nRead all 368 reviews\n\nContributors & Developers\n\n“SiteGround Migrator” is open source software.
