        "text": "There is no doubt, both SiteGround and DreamHost are the two best web hosting companies today. Also, both hosting providers are official recommendations of WordPress.org.\n\nHowever, it can be extremely confusing to choose from the two best hosting providers if you are a new user.\n\nIf you have the same confusion, here is our review on SiteGround Vs. DreamHost. We have compared these two hosting providers based on their performance, customer support, hosting plan price, and much more.\n\nWe have carefully categorized the comparison in different rounds. By the end of this writeup, you will have a clear-cut idea of which is better. Let us begin with a short introduction to both these hosting providers.\n\nSiteGround Vs. DreamHost – Overview\n\nAbout SiteGround\n\nSiteGround, located in Sofia, Bulgaria, started its web-hosting service in 2004. It has data centers on three continents and offices in six different locations. Also, it has more than 400 employees and hosts two million-plus domains.\n\nAbout DreamHost\n\nDreamHost is an LA-based web hosting provider and domain name registrar. The company started on April 10, 1996. Today, DreamHost has around 200 employees and hosts 1.5 million websites.\n\nDreamHost won PCMag’s Business Choice Awards for Web Hosting Service from 2014 to 2016. The company is also carbon-neutral certified and a member of the US Green Chamber of Commerce.\n\nSiteGround Vs. DreamHost – Comparison\n\nWe will measure the differences between SiteGround and DreamHost in five different rounds based on their performance, usability, distinguishing features, customer support, and hosting price.\n\nRound One: SiteGround Vs. DreamHost – Performance\n\nHere, we will compare SiteGround and DreamHost’s performance, based on their speed and uptime.\n\nSiteGround – Speed and Uptime\n\nSiteGround offers the latest hardware and software solutions, like SSD disks, SG Optimizer and HTTP/2. SiteGround takes an average of 673 ms to load.\n\nThe Service Level Agreement (SLA) of SiteGround guarantees an uptime of 99.99% annually. Any dip in this benchmark makes you eligible for compensations by the company as follows:\n\nFrom a drop between 99.99% to 99.00% uptime network, it offers one month of free hosting services.\n\nFor every 1% drop below 99.00% uptime network – an additional month of free hosting services.\n\nBut, there are specific terms for this uptime compensation policy. SiteGround is not liable to compensate the users for uptime drops under the following conditions:\n\nScheduled maintenance\n\nEmergency maintenance\n\nAny hardware and software failure that the company resolves in under an hour\n\nDowntime caused by IP address or DNS changes, about which the company had notified, but you failed to set the configurations accordingly\n\nHacker attacks, DDOS (Distributed Denial of service) attacks, or other similar events\n\nDowntime as a result of your configuration or by the use of any third-party applications\n\nDowntime due to consumption of the highest resource allocated for your chosen plan\n\nDowntime due to the violation of the TOS\n\nDowntime during upgrade/downgrade of your Cloud or Dedicated Server resources\n\nDowntime while carrying out your technical support request(s)\n\nAny event and condition beyond the company’s control\n\nDreamHost – Speed and Uptime\n\nDreamHost provides an average page loading speed of 648 ms. Likewise, the company’s Terms of Service guarantees a 100% uptime network. Any drop below it makes you eligible for a credit equal to your current hosting plan. For each hour of interruption, you get a day of hosting service.\n\nHowever, you may need to pay up to 10% of your next hosting renewal fee.\n\nWinner\n\nAlthough both SiteGround and DreamHost deliver above-average performance, we found DreamHost more consistent even during the rise of visitors at a time.\n\nThen we followed up the test with Bitcatcha to see each hosting provider’s performance at different locations. We found DreamHost was more efficient as compared to SiteGround.\n\nThus, DreamHost wins our first round.\n\nRound Two: SiteGround Vs. DreamHost – Usability\n\nSiteGround offers cPanel with a simple layout in all of its hosting plans. You can easily manage your hosting accounting using this control panel.\n\nDreamHost, on the other hand, offers a custom control panel dashboard. You can access the features and manage your hosting from its control panel dashboard. However, it lacks the traditional cPanel.\n\nLacking cPanel may not seem much of an issue for beginners. But if you are accustomed to cPanel, this drawback can be troublesome. You need to tackle a learning curve with DreamHost.\n\nMoreover, no cPanel means there isn’t an easy process to migrate your site straight from the dashboard. You need to transfer your site and files through MySQL and FTP, which is quite a lengthy process.\n\nWinner\n\nSiteGround wins the usability round owing to its user-friendly cPanel.\n\nRound Three: SiteGround Vs. DreamHost – Notable Features\n\nBoth of the hosting companies offer multiple features based on the hosting plan you choose. This section will look at the features that give each company an upper hand over the other.\n\nSiteGround – Features\n\nHere are a few features where SiteGround excels:\n\n1. Customer Service\n\nSiteGround provides better customer support as compared to DreamHost. They offer 24/7 live chat and phone support to their customers. You can reach out to the support team via any method that you find convenient.\n\nSiteGround also offers high-quality tutorials and guides for customers. You can quickly find a solution to your problem.\n\n2. Multiple Server Locations\n\nSiteGround has data centers in Asia, Australia, America, and Europe. Such decentralization lets you choose between the data centers you prefer during the signup.\n\n3. Multiple Startup Features\n\nIf you choose the minimal startup plan, you get multiple features such as:\n\nUnmetered traffic\n\nWP auto-updates and backups on demand\n\nFree WP installation\n\nFree CDN\n\nUnlimited database and\n\nWP-CLI and SSH\n\nDreamHost Features\n\nNow let’s look at some of the signature features of DreamHost:\n\n1. 97 Day Money-Back Guarantee\n\nSiteGround offers a 30-day money-back policy. However, DreamHost pushes this policy for up to 97 days.\n\nYour hosting company cannot be more liberal than this. Also, they don’t have any hidden terms for your claim.\n\nThere are only two exceptions to the refund policy:\n\nOnly credit cards are eligible for a refund. The company will not refund any other payment methods, such as cash or cheques.\n\nThe company will not refund any additional purchases from the third party. For example, domain name, AdWords credit, and SSL certificates.\n\n2. More Hosting Package\n\nDreamHost has multiple hosting packages to suit various levels of users. The packages include a shared hosting plan, VPS hosting plan, Managed WordPress hosting plan, Cloud hosting, and Dedicated hosting plan.\n\nSiteGround also offers all the above hosting plans except VPS.\n\n3. No Extra Renewal Price\n\nSiteGround’s lowest sharing plan sign up costs around $6.99 per month. During the renewal of this plan, the price hikes up to $14.99 per month.\n\nHowever, with DreamHost, there isn’t any extra cost during the renewal of any plan. You need to pay the same price as during the signing up process. Further, DreamHost offers a lower price if you sign up for three years straight, rather than a month or a year.\n\nWinner\n\nSiteGround offers more features needed to set up a decent website. It lists advanced features as compared to DreamHost. Moreover, prompt customer service and multiple server locations make SiteGround a better choice.\n\nRound Four: SiteGround Vs. DreamHost – Customer Support\n\nAs mentioned above, SiteGround offers round the clock service to its customers. You can reach out to the support team via phone, live chat, or email at any time of the day. Moreover, they provide extensive documents along with high-quality tutorials and guides.\n\nSimilar to SiteGround, DreamHost also claims 24/7 support to its clients, including live chat. Despite their claim, their actual active hours are from 5:30 AM till 9:30 PM. It goes only for Pacific time. If you live in any other region, catching up with the support team can be troublesome. Moreover, if you need support at any other time except for their active hours, they leave you with a ticket system.\n\nAlthough DreamHost aims to respond to all the requests within the next 24 hours, some users find it frustrating to wait. Also, such a system is not an option during emergencies.\n\nWinner\n\nSiteGround wins this round without any second opinion.\n\nRound Five: SiteGround Vs. DreamHost – Hosting Price\n\nHere, we will look at the hosting plans of each hosting provider.\n\nShared Hosting Plan of SiteGround\n\nShared Hosting Plan of DreamHost\n\nOther Hosting Plans – Side By Side Comparison\n\nWinner\n\nIf you want a budget-friendly hosting provider, DreamHost is the best fit. It offers a wide range of pricing plans as compared to SiteGround. Also, there is no added renewal cost with DreamHost.\n\nSiteGround Vs. DreamHost – Our Verdict\n\nClearly, our comparison shows that SiteGround wins three out of five rounds. The primary benefit of SiteGround over DreamHost is the 24-hour support system and easy-to-use cPanel.\n\nHaving it said, choosing between these two hosting providers comes down to your personal choice. It’s like a music genre.
