This time delay is dependent on your domain host.\n\nYou may also find that within this period of time, some users will see the new site, some will see the old site.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf your domain is pointing to Limecube correctly, it should show our IP address in this tool as per the screenshot below, and show a result of 35.197.188.96.\n\nTo use this tool, simply enter your domain name in the first field where you see 'limecube.co, and press 'search'.\n\nIP address not showing\n\nNot showing 35.197.188.96 If you don't yet see 35.197.188.96 showing, and 2 hours have passed, we recommend going back and checking your domain settings against the instructions above. Only some countries show 35.197.188.96 If it is simply a case that 35.197.188.96 is showing on some countries and not others, that indicates your domain has started updating correctly, but not yet fully updated everywhere yet, and will just need more time.\n\nIf you are still having trouble, please create a support ticket by clicking the button at the top of this page."
