On the page that opens input the new desired domain name and click Confirm. Make sure that the new domain name is registered and pointed to your SiteGround website. Note that you can not select a SiteGround temporary domain name at this step. It is available only upon new site creation.\n\nThe new domain name should be registered and pointed to your SiteGround website before the primary domain name change.\n\nNote that if you are collaborating on this website with someone else, the change should be made by the website owner."
