        "text": "SiteGround: A Quick Overview\n\nSiteGround was founded in Bulgaria around eighteen years ago, and it wasn’t long before this web host started making waves in the web hosting space.\n\nIt stands apart from other web host due to its commitment to delivering quality at every level.\n\nOur Review\n\nBefore we delved deep into the review, our team determined the benefits and disadvantages of SiteGround to help you decide if it suits your needs.\n\n1. Excellent Security + Backups\n\nAfter diligent research, we determined that SiteGround has an in-house team of dedicated server security experts, and they also invest quite heavily in their infrastructure.\n\n2. SiteGround Uses Google’s Cloud Platform\n\nAfter personally using the hosting service, I learned that SiteGround leverages Google’s C2 Cloud server technology to deliver scalable managed cloud hosting for growing businesses of all sizes.\n\nThe prime advantage of using Google Cloud is that it guarantees premium availability and reliability and is simply one of the fastest networks out there.\n\nIt is, however, more expensive than shared hosting, but the benefits delivered by this type of hosting are indeed superior.\n\nSince SiteGround also manages the technical setup and infrastructure, their clients do not need to configure and maintain their own servers.\n\n3. 24/7 Outstanding Customer Support\n\nAfter countless interaction with SiteGround’s customer support, I can vouch that they remain dedicated to providing excellent customer support. We rated their priority support team quite high compared to the hundreds of hosts we’ve put to the test over the last year.\n\n4. Beginner-Friendly Custom Dashboard\n\nIf you are currently using a different web host, it may be likely that they use a traditional cPanel dashboard. However, SiteGround developed its own custom dashboard that I find much more intuitive and easy to use than cPanel.\n\nWith this custom dashboard, SiteGround solves a few key problems that many experience with their hosting accounts from other providers:\n\n5. Amazing Uptime\n\nSiteGround averaged 100% uptime in 2022, most hosts don’t even begin to come close!\n\n6. Decent Global Speed Performance\n\nAfter recommending SiteGround to one of my clients, they vouched that their business websites had received commendable speed performance. This is in large part thanks to its “blazing-fast” global in-house CDN.\n\nSiteGround also has servers in multiple locations around the world so you can easily find a server location closest to your target audience.\n\nIt also invests in its server-side caching technology and also provides a performance optimization plugin for WordPress users to get even better website performance.\n\n7. Officially Recommended by WordPress\n\nIt is one of three web hosts to be officially recommended by WordPress, the world’s most popular platform for building websites. We also did a SiteGround and WP Engine comparison which you can check for additional features analysis.\n\n8. Free SSL Certificates\n\nAfter in-depth research, our team learned that SiteGround was one of the first hosting providers to integrate Lets Encrypt (a provider of free SSL certificates).\n\nThe company also went a step further and integrated automatic issuing and renewals of SSL certificates within its platform.\n\nWith its 1-click SSL installation option, SiteGround has made it incredibly easy for everyone to secure their websites.\n\n9. Expensive Renewals\n\nOne of my clients claimed that although SiteGround offers up to 80% discount on its shared hosting services, the hosting service charges five times as much for renewals.\n\nThere are far cheaper hosting providers out there who also offer discounted rates for longer than SiteGround does.\n\nHowever, this comes with a giant caveat because very few cheap hosting providers actually offer as much value as SiteGround.\n\nTake a look for yourself in these head-to-head comparisons we’ve written comparing SiteGround with two of the cheapest web hosts in the market: Bluehost and Hostgator:\n\n10. No Free Domain Name or Other Business Services\n\nSiteGround doesn’t offer a great range of different services for businesses to manage all their website-related needs.\n\nFor instance, it does not include a free domain name with your hosting, nor does it offer separate email hosting or any marketing add-ons.\n\nWhile you can purchase and transfer domains to SiteGround, their domain prices are also quite high (much higher than the industry average).\n\nSo if you’re looking for an all in one web host, perhaps companies like GoDaddy or Namecheap are more suitable options for you to consider.\n\n11. No VPS Hosting or Dedicated Servers\n\nSiteGround offers cloud services instead of VPS or dedicated hosting.\n\nWe consider SiteGround’s cloud services superior to most VPS and dedicated hosting solutions on the market at the moment.\n\nWith either VPS or dedicated hosting, your website is stored on a single server and if anything were to happen to that server, chances are that your website would go down with the server.\n\nHowever, cloud services distribute files across a global network of servers so that you can experience greater safety, security and unparalleled uptime.\n\n12. Limited Storage on Shared Plans and WordPress Hosting\n\nWhile SiteGround allows you to host unlimited sites on most of its shared and WordPress hosting pans, it offers very little storage for you to do so.\n\nWhen compared to companies like Hostinger that give you from 50GB of SSD storage on the lowest tier, some might find SiteGround’s limited storage a little restrictive.\n\n13. No “In-Between” Hosting Options\n\nIf you decide the shared hosting plans don’t have enough storage but you don’t want to scale up to SiteGround’s cloud hosting which starts at $100/month, there simply aren’t any other options you can consider that are in between.\n\nThat’s perhaps the gap that most VPS and dedicated server plans fill for other hosting companies, they provide those ‘in-between’ options in both price and resources available.\n\nIf this is a deal-breaker for you, perhaps you can check out our article on the best unlimited web hosting providers for a list of companies that provide great value and unlimited storage for more affordable prices instead.\n\nSiteGround Hosting Plans\n\nIf you’ve decided that SiteGround sounds like a decent company for your needs, here are the details on each of their services.\n\n1. Shared Hosting\n\nSiteGround offers promotional pricing on all its shared plans. Based on my experience and client feedback however, you will need to pay one year of hosting upfront to secure the cheapest rates.\n\nUnlike other web hosts that offer up to 3 year terms for the cheapest rates, you will need to pay the renewal pricing which can be as much as 5 times the cost of the promo prices.\n\n2. WordPress Hosting\n\nSiteGround offers two types of WordPress hosting services:\n\nIn both cases, the prices and package inclusions match the shared plans with additional WordPress specific features included.\n\nThis is great value if you run a WordPress site as you essentially get a stack of extra features for free.\n\nThese include:\n\n3. Cloud Hosting\n\nThere are four cloud hosting options to choose from which really raise the bar compared to SiteGround’s shared plans.\n\nYou can also configure your own Custom Cloud setup which offers the following:\n\nAll of SiteGround’s cloud hosting plans run on Google’s scalable and reputable C2 cloud technology.\n\nHowever, if you’re seeking a solution that lets you manage your own sever setup, that’s not available with SiteGround.\n\n4. Reseller Hosting\n\nSiteGround offers a reseller web hosting which also replicates the shared hosting plans.\n\nHowever, the most notable difference is that you can manage unlimited sites on all plans.\n\nYou can also register your clients as users in your account and give them white-label (they can use their own branding) access to the websites (and the associated site tools) you build for them.\n\nThis means that you can customize SiteGround’s dashboard to show only your logo.\n\nThey won’t see SiteGround’s branding anywhere so you can provide a truly white-labeled web hosting service.\n\nSiteGround’s reseller hosting plans are best suited to agencies and freelancers that sell web design or web-related marketing services.\n\nFeatures\n\n1. Disk Space\n\nSince I’ve used SiteGround on one of my websites, I acquired the mid-tier storage the company offers. I also learned that the hosting service offers limited disk space on both it’s shared and WordPress web hosting services.\n\nCompared to other companies that offer 50GB on their smallest tiers for only $1.99/month, SiteGround sure seems to be overcharging for what it delivers.\n\nIf you do want storage-optimized hosting through SiteGround, we recommend customizing your own cloud setup as you can choose anywhere between 40GB and 1TB of SSD storage!\n\n2. Backups\n\nHaving used the service myself, I can attest that SiteGround offers automated backup plans daily without additional charges and enhances security by storing data on multiple platforms.\n\n3. Security\n\nSiteGround offers ecellent security features.\n\nIn fact, we’re so impressed by their commitment and steadfast dedication to providing top-tier security that we crowned SiteGround as one of the best web hosting companies in 2024.\n\nHere are SiteGround’s security features in a nutshell:\n\nFor anyone who wants extra security included, SiteGround also offers an additional paid (and optional) tool called SiteScanner which runs scans to detect malware and common security threats.\n\nWe have always considered security as one of our top priorities as a web hosting provider. We go above and beyond when it comes to securing the server and each and every one of our customer’s accounts.\n\n-SiteGround Customer Support\n\nSiteGround isolates your site from other custom patches on the same server to enhance security. Company specialists monitor web applications to counteract potential vulnerabilities and ensure the safety of the client’s website.\n\n4. Servers & Locations\n\nFor anyone targeting audiences in a specific location, it’s worth looking at where your website’s servers are located.\n\nSiteGround’s data center locations.\n\nIf your audience is primarily based in the US, there’s generally no issue for you as most web hosts have at least one data center in the US. Paired with a CDN, you can still easily distribute your content all over the world.\n\nIf your audience is not primarily based in the US, however, you need a more flexible approach and SiteGround offers exactly that with the 7 locations of their data centers around the world.\n\nThey currently have servers located in:\n\nIn addition, they offer 7 CDN locations between the US, South America, Europe and Japan.\n\nTheir data centers are all green (carbon-neutral) and feature multi-layered security to prevent unauthorized access to your data.\n\nPerformance\n\nTo determine SiteGround’s website speed and performance, our team will share the results of our tests.\n\n1. Speed\n\nWith website speed being among the most critical factors for user experience, it’s no surprise Google has also made it an official ranking factor.\n\nBelow are the results of the test:\n\nOur tests with both GT Metrix and Pingdom showed some minor performance drops from London servers.\n\nTo be fair, though, we didn’t set up the test website on SiteGround’s London servers so you’re likely to be able to get great performance in the UK if you opt for the local servers instead of US-based ones.\n\nOtherwise, these scores from different locations around the world are far better than most of SiteGround’s competitors.\n\nThere are some global hosting companies that have way better performance.\n\nFastComet is at the top of our list as it has been at the top of our list for the best web hosting in Nigeria, Australia, South Africa, and even Nepal.\n\n2. Uptime\n\nSiteGround has one of the best uptime performance with a record average of 100%.\n\nHere’s the data and we’ve compared it to FastComet to follow on from the above point.\n\nThat’s why SiteGround is one of the best web hosting providers we recommend because they excel where most others fail.\n\nSiteGround Pricing\n\nSiteGround’s pricing can be considered on the expensive side.\n\nThe average specs of these plans are listed below, side by side with SiteGround’s.\n\nSiteGround effectively costs more than double the industry average to deliver the same resources.\n\nSupport\n\nAfter I’ve personally interacted with their customer support, I inferred from feedback that they are among the top companies we’ve considered.\n\nBased on our inquiry, here’s what SiteGround’s customers have to say:\n\nWith over 92% of customers who have left a review rating SiteGround as “excellent” on TrustPilot, that’s not something many other hosting companies can compete with.\n\nSiteGround remains dedicated to delivering quality at every turn, both with priority and regular customer support.\n\nAll of SiteGround’s customers get:\n\nIf you opt in for the GoGeek plan, you also get priority support.\n\nThis means that any of your customer support requests that come through via the live chat or ticketing function are assigned as high priority and passed to the most experienced customer support agents available at the time of your query.\n\nThat’s how SiteGround is able to maintain exceptional customer support quality and resolves many issues very quickly.\n\nThe site tools features that SiteGround offer include site builder, CDN management and site scanner.\n\n1. Drag & Drop Builder\n\nThe drag & drop builder it features allows beginners with no technical skills to create a professional website. You simply have to drag and drop content elements like photos, graphs, videos and text to add them to the website.\n\n2. CDN Management\n\nSiteGround CDN is a site optimization feature designed for clients and customers who receive their signal from various locations.\n\nIt increases the website loading speed between 20% to 100% by utilizing Google network and anycast routing.\n\n3. Site Scanner\n\nSite scanner automatically performs daily checks for any detected threats before it could reduce incoming traffic and create substantial damage. This feature would help maintain your website’s integrity and business reputation.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQS)\n\nWhat SiteGround Tools Will Speed Up Your Site?\n\nSuperCacher, NGINX Web Server, Cloudflare Content Delivery Network are SiteGround tools that will speed up your site.\n\nDoes SiteGround Support WooCommerce?\n\nSiteGround supports WooCommerce.\n\nSiteGround is an expert WordPress and WooCommerce host. SiteGround’s WooCommerce-specific optimizations ensure reliable and consistent performance, making them a solid choice for whatever online shop you may be creating.\n\nCan I Cancel My SiteGround Account and Get a Refund?\n\nYou can cancel your SiteGround account and get a refund. They offer a 30-day refund policy for all shared hosting plans and a 14-day money-back guarantee for cloud hosting accounts.\n\nOur Verdict on SiteGround Review\n\nBased on my experience with SiteGround and the results of our tests, I must say I’m genuinely impressed with the hosting service. The company’s reliability, efficiency and the positive feedback they garnered from clients are proof why they’re a top choice.\n\nIf you’re looking for a blend of reliability, speed, and top-notch support, SiteGround is a contender that’s hard to overlook. In my books, they’re definitely worth considering for your hosting needs in 2023."
