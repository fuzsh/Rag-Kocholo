Don’t break the 5-second rule\n\nThe moment a visitor lands on your website you only have 5 seconds to make a good impression.\n\nThat’s 5 short seconds to convince your visitor to stay on your website – and don’t hit the ‘back’ button.\n\nMake sure the text on your website is appealing and gets your visitor excited. Don’t waste the first 5 seconds of somebody’s visit with unnecessary fluff.\n\n2. Don’t confuse your visitor with too many call to actions\n\nGreat call to actions draw the attention of your visitors.\n\nThat said, you don’t want your call to action buttons fighting for the attention of your visitor. Pick the most important call to action for that page, and go with it.\n\nIn case you want to show multiple call to actions anyway, make sure to give them a different design, with your primary call to action being the most notable one.\n\n3. Design mobile-first\n\nLast year over 52% of all the website traffic worldwide came from mobile devices.\n\nMore than half of the website visits are on a mobile device.\n\nThis percentage will only increase in the coming years, therefore the mobile design of your website is crucial for the success of your Siteground website.\n\nWhen designing your website, think about mobile design before you build your desktop website.\n\n4. Watch people using your website without telling them what to do\n\nOnce your website is ready it’s time to launch. Well, almost.\n\nInvite some friends or colleagues and put them in front of a computer. Ask them to pretend to be potential customers and have them visit your website.\n\nNow sit next to them, and don’t say anything (this will be harder than you think).\n\nDo this with at least 5 people and learn from their behavior:\n\nDid they follow the steps you expected them to?\n\nDid your website load fast enough?\n\nWas everything clear to them?\n\n5. Collect real testimonials from real members\n\nBy now you probably realized social proof is extremely important when it comes to building a great website. Take it to the next level, and add testimonials from your members.\n\nDon’t write them yourself, don’t ask your friends to write them. Everybody will feel something is off.\n\nWant to go for the perfect score? Include video testimonials. Trust me, this will turn your website into a conversion machine."
