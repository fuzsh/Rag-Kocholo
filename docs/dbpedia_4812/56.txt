SiteGround Introduction:

SiteGround has spent the past several years growing from humble beginnings in a college dorm room to the preferred hosting provider for 1.6 million websites.

Their customer service is award-winning, providing 24/7 support and on top of that, they offer 7 different server locations (including the UK).

In the following SiteGround review, I’ll share my own first-hand experience of being a SiteGround customer (this site is hosted on a GrowBig plan with SiteGround).

SiteGround has consistently come up as the number 1 rated hosting company on the WordPress Hosting Facebook Group which has over 8000 members.

There are almost 1300 reviews that we have collected from users like yourself and 99.9% are positive ones.

1. Reliable Web Hosting (100% uptime)

One of the main reasons I rate SiteGround so highly is because their server performance and reliability have never failed me. Although this website is hosted with SiteGround, I signed up for their StartUp plan with a test website so I could unbiasedly monitor my test site’s uptime and performance.

In order to track my website’s uptime and server response time, I signed up to UptimeRobot. UptimeRobot allows you to input any number of URLs to monitor uptime, response time, and other performance metrics.

UptimeRobot checks my test site every 5 minutes, and to date, SiteGround has never left me with any downtime. I’ve used SiteGround to host multiple websites over the years, and these kinds of results come as no surprise to me.

SiteGround has always been a solid and reliable web host which is why I rate them #1 in the best web hosting for 2024.

2. SiteGround Has Quick Server Response Times

To assess my test website’s server response time, I used a variety of tools so I could show you different aspects of this measure. Server response time, in a nutshell, is how quickly a server responds to a request.

So, if someone visiting your website inputs your site’s URL, this is the time it takes for the server to respond and deliver your website’s content to them.

I used Pingdom’s Website Speed Test to see how my un-optimised website would grade. This test is important to me because this is my website without any WordPress plugins or optimisation tools installed.

I tested my website using Europe’s London, U.K. server as this is the closest one to my host’s server and the majority of my website traffic. Considering I had literally installed WordPress’s Twenty-Seventeen theme and hadn’t optimised my website in any way, I thought the results were quite good.

Both my UptimeRobot and Pingdom tests have reassured me that my faith in SiteGround certainly isn’t misguided. They are one of the best web hosts we’ve tested so far and their uptime, speed, or performance is impressive. Kissmetrics support the notion that many studies have found.

My next test was using Bitcatcha’s server speed checker test. All you have to do is enter your website’s URL and Bitcatcha will ping multiple server locations across the world and provide you with your server’s response times.

I took the results and calculated a worldwide average server response time of 132.4ms which is incredible! This is well below Google’s recommended 200ms, giving me (and you) confidence that SiteGround server really does perform well.

Next up I wanted to see the real impact that SiteGround’s SuperCacher would have on my website. Again, this is bearing in mind that I haven’t done anything to optimise my website at this stage.

I used dotcom-tools to test my website speed across 24 worldwide locations.

SuperCacher caches static content, meaning the second time you visit a web page, the content will load faster. Static content refers to content that is unlikely to change, like images, HTML, and JavaScript. If someone from the U.S. visits my website, where the server is located in the U.K., they will massively benefit from cached content to experience faster loading times.

There is a clear difference between the first visit and repeat visits on these results.

5. You Can Migrate Your WordPress Website For Free

If you’re moving from one web host to another, it’s good to look out for free site migration. Why? Well, it just makes everything a lot easier! I know I wouldn’t feel comfortable transferring all my files from one server to another!

Before signing up to SiteGround I had previously heard that they offer free site migration for WordPress websites.

If you know what you’re doing then the process doesn’t require much effort at all. But for people like me, it’s nice to know your web host has your back if something goes wrong!

I spoke to SiteGround’s live chat to ask them about the migration process. As you can see they answered everything

I asked in one message and confirmed that the free site migration is available to all customers on the GrowBig and GoGeek plans.

If you have a WordPress site that you want to migrate to SiteGround, it couldn’t be simpler to move your site across. There are two methods in which you can do this:

Using SiteGround’s automatic migration for WordPress sites using their Migrator Plugin

Professional migration by a SiteGround expert

To transfer an existing site using WordPress Automigration, simply click on Migrate Website from step 2 of the Website Setup Wizard and then select WordPress Automigration.

Alternatively, if you wish for one of SiteGround’s experts to manually transfer your website, you’ll need to submit a ticket to the support engineers (which is a paid-for service) and they will do the rest.

6. Site Tools Is Beginner Friendly

SiteGround’s control panel has recently seen some updates, making it more intuitive than ever before. If you’re a beginner or you’re not that confident in your technical ability, SiteGround’s dashboard makes the process incredibly easy.

You can manage all of your websites individually using SiteGround’s control panel, meaning you can access each of their site tools separately. If you’re a collaborator for any websites (mostly used by developers), you can access these on a separate tab so as not to get confused. I know this is only a simple feature but it’s really helpful if you have a lot of websites.

It’s now easier than ever to manage all of your SiteGround services, including web hosting and domains. SiteGround’s revamped control panel makes everything easy and super obvious, meaning you shouldn’t have to contact their customer support as much (though if you do, they are great).

If you want to add any extras to your hosting or domain accounts, you can easily install extra apps using SiteGround’s marketplace. For example, if you want to add domain privacy to your existing domain, you can literally click a button and install this feature.

All-in-all, I am loving SiteGround’s new control panel updates. They’ve made everything beginner-friendly so you can manage your websites and domains all from one place, without any confusion.

7. Daily Backups Are A Life Saver

With any website, big or small, it’s so important to have a backup of your files. If I had spent a couple of hours or even days working on my website, only for something to go wrong and lose all my work, I’d be pretty gutted!

SiteGround backup every customer’s website on a daily basis. If you run your own backup and it goes wrong, or you forget to do it, you can speak to their support team to get your data recovered. Manual and automated backups are kept for 30 days once they’ve been created on SiteGround’s shared plans.

Simply log in to your SiteGround account, select Websites then choose Site Tools on the website you wish to backup. This will take you to SiteGround’s Site Tools where you can select Security from the left-hand panel, then Backups to access a list of your website’s backups.

I purchased their StartUp plan, so I get one backup each day if required. If you think you may need more than that, their GrowBig and GoGeek plans offer entire website backups with restoration options.

1. Limited Storage

This is something that other web hosts offer more of, but I’ll explain why I don’t think it really deserves to be a con in a moment.

You’ll probably notice each plan offers the following in terms of storage:

StartUp: 10GB, suitable for 10,000 visitors per month (small non-WordPress site)

GrowBig: 20GB, suitable for 25,000 visitors per month (medium WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal sites)

GoGeek: 30GB, suitable for 100,000 visitors per month (WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and eCommerce sites)

That’s a lot of information that probably means nothing to you, so I’ve identified what type of website would be suitable for each plan. If SiteGround labelled their plans similar to the above, they’d probably make more sense!

No, SiteGround’s plans aren’t as generous as others when it comes to storage, however, most web pages don’t exceed 3MB in size! That’s the point I was getting at to start off with. 10GB might not sound much, but you’d need a pretty hefty website to exceed that even if you tried really hard!

2. Prices Hike At Renewal

I’ve only come across a few web hosts who don’t hike their prices up at renewal.

Although new customers get to enjoy around a 67% discount on their hosting plans with SiteGround, these prices don’t last forever. When it comes to renewal, you’re going to have to dish out the full price of SiteGround’s shared hosting which starts at £11.99 per month (although this is common practise with most web hosts).

Recently, SiteGround made a pretty unpopular decision to raise their prices when they moved over to the Google Cloud Platform that I mentioned earlier. Although the price increase is frustrating, it’s clear this host is doing what they can to deliver the best service possible by using the latest and fastest technologies so you and I can enjoy faster speeds.

If you want to make the most of SiteGround’s introductory discounts, I would suggest signing up for the longest term possible. I’ve worked in this industry for a long time and I can vouch that SiteGround is worth the £2.99 per month they advertise, but if you can save for longer, why not!

SiteGround Hosting Plans:

Now that I’ve covered what I think about SiteGround, it’s time to decide whether it’s the right web host for you! If you think it is, it would only be right to assess which hosting plan suits your website’s needs.

I’ll be honest SiteGround isn’t the cheapest web hosting BUT you do get what you pay for and I can safely say that about SiteGround.

Questions I often get asked are:

How much space do I need?

How many websites should I have?

Do I need multiple databases?

What plan is right for my business?

STARTUP

£1.99 /mo

GROW BIG

£3.99 /mo

GO GEEK

Visit SiteGround.com (£3.99/Month)

StartUp

This is the plan that I chose for my website hosting to write this review. At a bargain price of £1.99 per month, it felt silly to miss out on! Plus, you actually get tonnes of features for your money.

This is clearly SiteGround’s cheapest plan, but again they don’t shy away from offering all of their customers something decent for their money.

GrowBig

It’s time to step things up a notch! But really, is it that big of a leap? Not in terms of price, no! SiteGround’s GrowBig plan is only £3.99.

But for the extra money, you do get quite a lot more. Firstly you can have up to 25,000 visitors on a monthly basis, an extra 10GB storage, and you’ll open the doors to SiteGround’s premium features:

Unlimited websites (useful if you’re using sub-domains or a separate blog to your site)

Premium speed (the SuperCacher is definitely worth the extra money)

Premium backup (free backups if something goes wrong at the click of a button)

Free site migration (great if you’re moving files from another web host)

GoGeek:

It’s kind of in the name this one… if you’re ready to take your website to the next level, you’ll notice the difference in price. BUT you do get a lot more for your money.

If you’re going to set up an eCommerce website, this is 100% the option I’d suggest for you. If you’re just running a small or medium website, business, or blog, it’s not worth spending the extra.

The main purpose of this plan like I said is for eCommerce users. Your website will be on a server with fewer users, so there won’t be such a battle for resources, making your website faster (much better if you have people online shopping).

SiteGround doesn’t offer a free trial. Their shared web hosting plans start from just £5.99 per month, so if you did want to give them a try, you won’t be forking out much money. If you want a completely free web host then there are some free options (but we don’t recommend it!).

On top of this, SiteGround offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you sign up for them and aren’t keen (though I’m sure you will be), you can try their services risk-free.

Their money-back guarantee is applicable to all shared accounts.

SiteGround has 24/7 telephone support. You can contact SiteGround by phone for sales, billing, and technical queries.

In some cases, an issue may require more investigation. SiteGround say that they will escalate issues like this to their advanced technical support team. If this happens, you’ll receive a response via the Help Desk which you can find in your User Area.

Most support tickets are responded to within 15 minutes, and telephone calls answered within 5 seconds.

They have a toll-free telephone number, so if you have any issues, get in touch with them or use their live chat option.
