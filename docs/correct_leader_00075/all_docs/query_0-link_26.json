        "text": "Finland's first female prime minister, who quit last year accused of using leaked documents on Iraq to win an election, actively sought secret information, the court heard on the first day of her trial yesterday.\n\nAnneli Jaatteenmaki faces a possible fine for inciting or assisting the breach of official secrets. Prosecutors say she repeatedly asked a presidential aide for information on US-Finland talks on Iraq, an allegation she has denied.\n\nThe former aide accused of leaking the documents, Martti Manninen, also faces a potential fine. He has said Ms Jaatteenmaki pressed him for documents and even gave him a secret fax number. \"I did not think that receiving faxes or sending them could be wrong,\" Ms Jaatteenmaki told the court yesterday.\n\nMr Manninen's lawyer told the court the information sent was not secret and Mr Manninen had no idea how it would be used.\n\n\"This is a thoroughly political trial,\" lawyer Matti Wuori said. \"The fact that (Ms) Jaatteenmaki...used (the information) in a way that some people found sensational and contrary to our established political culture is not a punishable deed.\"\n\nThe trial, in which Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja is due to testify for the defence, is scheduled to conclude tomorrow and a ruling is expected two weeks later.\n\nIt is one of the many aftershocks of the Iraq war and comes a week after Britain dropped charges against a translator for leaking a top secret US memo.\n\nIt shows how far the repercussions of the Iraq conflict reached, rattling even a small non-aligned Nordic country on the edge of Europe usually known for its straight-laced politics and lack of corruption.\n\nMs Jaatteenmaki resigned in June 2003 after only two months in office, denying to the end she had asked for details of secret foreign ministry documents on talks held between her predecessor Paavo Lipponen and President George Bush in December 2002.\n\nMr Bush thanked Mr Lipponen for his support as tension mounted ahead of the war against Iraq, comments that struck a nerve in Finland where the public fiercely opposed military action against Baghdad and suspicion of US intentions ran deep."
