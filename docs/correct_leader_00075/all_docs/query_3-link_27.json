        "text": "In March 2003, Ms Jäätteenmäki and her Centre Party clinched a narrow election victory over the ruling Social Democrats (seeEURACTIV 16 April 2003). Finnish MPs are now questioning her over allegations she used confidential information, leaked from the Foreign Ministry, to unseat former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen. Ms Jôteenm© denied she had asked for classified documents about Finland's Iraq policy.\n\nMs Jäätteenmäki has been criticised for using the information in election debates with Mr Lipponen, accusing him of changing Finland's neutral foreign policy line by giving US leaders the impression Finland was part of an anti-Iraq war coalition. Excerpts from these documents were posted on Ms Jäätteenmäki's web site, which is illegal.\n\nWhile she did not admit any wrongdoing in the scandal, dubbed \"Iraq-gate\" by local media, Ms Jäätteenmäki handed in her resignation to President Tarja Halonen. It was not immediately clear how soon a new coalition government would be formed."
