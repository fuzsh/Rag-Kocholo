Barton Palmer Founding editor: Steven Jay Schneider Traditions in World Cinema is a series of textbooks and monographs devoted to the analysis of currently popular and previously underexamined or undervalued film movements from around the globe. Also intended for general interest readers, the textbooks in this series offer undergraduate- and ­graduate-level film students accessible and comprehensive introductions to diverse traditions in world cinema. The monographs open up for advanced academic study more specialised groups of films, including those that require theoretically oriented approaches. Both textbooks and monographs provide thorough examinations of the industrial, cultural, and socio-historical conditions of production and reception. The flagship textbook for the series includes chapters by noted scholars on traditions of acknowledged importance (the French New Wave, German Expressionism), recent and emergent traditions (New Iranian, post-Cinema Novo), and those whose rightful claim to recognition has yet to be established (the Israeli persecution film, global found footage cinema). Other volumes concentrate on individual national, regional or global cinema traditions. As the introductory chapter to each volume makes clear, the films under discussion form a coherent group on the basis of substantive and relatively transparent, if not always obvious, commonalities. These commonalities may be formal, stylistic or thematic, and the groupings may, although they need not, be popularly\n\ntraditions in world cinema\n\nidentified as genres, cycles or movements (Japanese horror, Chinese martial arts cinema, Italian Neorealism). Indeed, in cases in which a group of films is not already commonly identified as a tradition, one purpose of the volume is to establish its claim to importance and make it visible (East Central European Magical Realist cinema, Palestinian cinema). Textbooks and monographs include:\n\nAn introduction that clarifies the rationale for the grouping of films under examination ● A concise history of the regional, national, or transnational cinema in question ● A summary of previous published work on the tradition ● Contextual analysis of industrial, cultural and socio-historical conditions of production and reception ● Textual analysis of specific and notable films, with clear and judicious application of relevant film theoretical approaches ● Bibliograph(ies)/filmograph(ies) ●\n\nMonographs may additionally include:\n\nDiscussion of the dynamics of cross-cultural exchange in light of current research and thinking about cultural imperialism and globalisation, as well as issues of regional/national cinema or political/ aesthetic movements (such as new waves, postmodernism, or identity politics) ● Interview(s) with key filmmakers working within the tradition. ●\n\nxv\n\nINTRODUCTION: NORDIC GENRE FILM AND INSTITUTIONAL HISTORY Tommy Gustafsson and Pietari Kääpä\n\nThe demand for all areas of Nordic film and television culture outside the borders of the Nordic countries may come as no surprise. The popularity of television shows such as The Killing (Forbrydelsen, 2007) and The Bridge (Bron|Broen, 2011) both domestically and internationally have increased the profile of Nordic media while the crime novels of Henning Mankell and Stieg Larsson have penetrated the American market – the barometer for global ­commercial ‘relevance’. The Guardian in the UK has published several articles on the craze, noting how the protagonist of the original Danish version of The Killing, detective Sarah Lund, has become an unlikely fashion icon with her knitted sweaters. While a certain type of Nordic film – the existential artistry of a Dreyer, a Bergman or a Kaurismäki – has existed at the periphery of this global consciousness, such perceptions are clearly shifting as the contemporary situation seems to be more characterised by Nordic contributions to global popular culture instead of the more traditional frameworks of artistic or experimental relevance. How did we get to this situation? In short, how did the media products of this small region of the world become part of global popular culture? In order to understand the international emergence of the Nordic media of the twenty-first century, we must turn to the ‘revival’ of the Nordic film industries in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Specifically, we must focus on the history of the Nordic genre film and its relationship with governmental support and film institutes. Previous international scholarship on Nordic cinemas has been carried out through a dense focus of art house cinema, often with a small number of auteur films with international distribution as\n\n1\n\ntommy gustafsson and pietari kääpä\n\nits preferred examples (see, for example, Hardy 1952; Cowie 1992; Thomson 2006). This institutionalised history is largely based on the concept of film as a national art cinema, a concept that relies on a sharp contrast with Hollywood’s fordianesque output of genre films. The notion of the national art film is so prevalent that a historical dictionary on Scandinavian cinema published in 2012 states as fact that ‘the production of genre film was sparse and, instead, a production of art house films and social problem films was favored’ during the period from 1960 to 1990 (Sundholm et al. 2012: 3). However, a look at the actual output of Nordic films before, during and after the period mentioned reveals that the productions of genre films have always surpassed the productions of art house films by a wide margin. On the whole comedies have without competition been the prevalent genre in all Nordic countries with films like the Finnish musical comedies starring Tauno Palo and Ansa Ikonen, the Swedish smash hit Love Mates (Änglar, finn dom?, Lars-Magnus Lindgren, 1961), Icelandic 101 Reykjavík (Baltasar Kormákur, 2000), Danish Olsen Gang films (Olsen Banden, 1968–98) and the Norwegian The Man Who Could Not Laugh (Mannen som ikke kunne le, Bo Hermansson, 1968), closely followed by the popular countryside melodrama, children’s films, and war films like the Finnish The Winter War (Talvisota, Pekka Parikka, 1989). The confusion between Sundholm et al.’s assertion and the realities of cinematic output seems to arise from what exactly is meant by the term ‘genre’. Indeed, the term is contested within the body of scholarship on genre. For example, Jane Feuer considers genre as ultimately ‘an abstract conception rather than something that exists empirically in the world’ (1992: 144). For David Buckingham, genre is a culturally flexible term as ‘it is in a constant process of negotiation and change’ (1993: 137). If we were to define genre in the Hollywood sense of a marketable commodity with preset advertising conventions and audience demographies, often considered to consist of horror, action, science fiction, the western or the like, it would certainly be the case that Nordic productions are sparse. While it is true that the horror genre, for one, is a distinct rarity in Nordic film culture pre-2000s (see below for more discussion of this), it is also clearly overstating the case to argue that genre – as both a set of cinematic conventions and an industrial strategy – has not held a key place in Nordic film cultures. Historically, genre films like the two Danish international sensations The White Slave Trade (Den hvide slavehandel, August Blom, 1910) and The Abyss (Afgrunden, Urban Gad, 1910) were the first Nordic films that entered the international film market. Nordisk Films Kompagni, the leading Danish film company at the time, specialised in entertaining thrillers and melodramas, often with equivoque elements. In Danish and international film history the period between 1910 and 1917 has also been dubbed a Golden Age (see, for example, Soila, Söderbergh Widding and Iversen 1998: 7–9). Likewise,\n\n2\n\nintroduction\n\nSweden had a Golden Age, usually placed between 1917 and 1924, when Swedish films successfully were exported to all known countries in the world. In retrospect this Golden Age has been linked to some twenty high-budget ‘art films’ that were typically based on a recognised novel and where the filmmakers every so often exploited Nordic nature in the narrative. Then again, this vast export of films, mainly due to the demand for film programming that the First World War had created, did in reality mostly consist of straightforward genre films, like the comedy Love and Journalism (Kärlek och journalistik, Mauritz Stiller, 1916) or the crime thriller The Death Kiss (Dödskyssen, Victor Sjöström, 1916). The biggest export success of all during these years was not a canonised film like The Phantom Chariot (Körkarlen, Victor Sjöström, 1921) but instead the immensely popular animations of Captain Grogg (Gustafsson 2007: 23–5). Finland, Norway and Iceland did not have similar periods of export success although Finland and Norway have had their own domestic Golden Ages, both in the 1930s and 1940s (Solia, Söderbergh Widding and Iversen 1998: 42–8, 110–13). Genre film has not only dominated Nordic film production; genre films have also, with few exceptions like The Silence (Tystnaden, Ingmar Bergman, 1963), been the most successful ones at the domestic box offices year after year. In Sweden, for example, only one out of the thirteen films that have topped the annual box office list since 2001 (SFI 2014) can be labelled as an art film, or at least as a medium-concept film according to Andrew Nestingen’s definition of films that linger between the genre and the art house (Nestingen 2008). That film was As It Is in Heaven (Så som i himmelen, Kay Pollak, 2004), which became a huge art house hit in Europe with 3.5 million tickets sold (Lumiere 2014). Yet that pales in comparison with the success of the genre film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Män som hatar kvinnor, Niels Arden Oplev, 2009) with a ticket sale that exceeded 10 million worldwide (Hedling 2014: 94), not to mention the American $90 million remake, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (David Fincher, 2011). However, up until the turn of the new millennium domestic genre films were generally not exported. There were only a few exceptions, including the wave of Danish and Swedish sexploitations films in the 1960s and 1970s (see Stevenson 2010) and the production of direct-to-VHS genre films in the 1980s. Instead, beginning during the silent age and continuing up until today, the Nordic countries started to ‘export’ film talent to Hollywood, and the list of actors, actresses, directors and technical personnel is extensive with names like Ingrid Bergman, Renny Harlin, Nicolas Winding Refn and Swedish sound editor Paul N. J. Ottosson. This phenomenon is further discussed by Arne Lunde in this collection (see also Lunde 2010). What was exported from the mid-1950s and onwards were films meant for the worldwide art house cinema circuit, which poorly reflects the actual\n\n3\n\ntommy gustafsson and pietari kääpä\n\nfilm production in the Nordic countries. It was mainly Swedish and Danish films that got this international attention but art house films were exported among the Nordic countries. This development came about as a result of the difficulties that the Nordic film industries faced from competition with the introduction of television in the mid-1950s and early 60s. In order to save their national film industries, Nordic governments offered support in various forms, most commonly with the creation of influential film institutes that steered parts of film production towards the production of ‘valuable’ films, that is, art house films and social problem films (Soila 2005: 3). This is significant as Nordic countries make for small nation cinemas that have had to rely more and more extensively on governmental support because the small size of the domestic audiences makes financial success purely based on domestic returns very unlikely. Several studies have discussed the implications of domestic institutional structures for the type of cinema produced in these countries, and this has also consolidated the strong notion that cinema became a predominantly artistic endeavour which prioritised experimental or stodgy national histories over more commercially minded productions (see, for example, Cowie 1992; Solia, Söderbergh Widding and Iversen 1998; Thomson 2006). This type of national film politics persisted until the late 1980s in the case of Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland, with Iceland only finding its film industrial bearing in the late 1980s. Changes started to take place in these politics as the organisations adopted more lenient views towards commercial production, with the film institute in Finland, for example, granting funding for the populist Uuno Turhapuro films (1973–2004) in 1987. Norway increased its investment in feature films, and in 2001 the Norwegian Film Institute was replaced by Norsk Filmfond. This new governmental body introduced a support structure that asserted that if the film producers could find private funding for 50 per cent of the budget then Norsk Filmfond would automatically cover the remaining 50 per cent (Iversen 2011: 293–4), a model also implemented by the Finnish Film Foundation in 2011. And in Sweden the creation of a number of regional film centres, with support from the European Union, broke and eventually changed the Swedish Film Institute’s supremacy over film production (Hedling 2008: 8–17). A significant adoption of these new politics can be seen by the early 2000s as genre productions of a range of varieties became mainstream in all the Nordic countries. If art house, social problems or historical films were the norm before, nowadays it would not be overstating the case to suggest that domestic productions more often than not follow competitive genre strategies, successfully catering to domestic viewers as well as gaining a measure of international recognition, both on the film festival circuit and commercially. As several chapters in this collection emphasise, the restructuring of the Nordic film institutes plays a key role in the emergence of the new Nordic genre film.\n\n4\n\nintroduction\n\nComedy and Nordic Cultural Closeness The Nordic countries are often lumped together as Scandinavia or the ‘Norden’, and in correspondence with this perception, the film industries are often considered as one homogeneous film culture. Considering this ‘cultural closeness’, the export and import of genre films within the region ought to be more frequent than they actually are. However, almost mechanistically, it is claimed that films do not travel between the Nordic countries, but this is a truth that has to be modified. First, historically, the export scene has been rather lively even though the flow of films has been in certain directions. For example, both Denmark and Sweden have been able to export considerably more films to the other Nordic countries than Denmark and Sweden have imported from those other countries (Soila, Söderbergh Widding and Iversen 1998: 236). The films that have been exported usually belong to Nestingen’s mediumconcept category where the notion of valuable cinema has operated as a decisive factor in decisions to import a film from one of the neighbouring Nordic countries. That is, these are the same type of films that would have the chance to be exported to countries outside the Nordic region as well, often playing on the international art house cinema circuit. However, according to the statistics of the Swedish Film Institute, Swedish distributors brought in no fewer than 111 Danish films, 71 Norwegian films, 71 Finnish films and 13 Icelandic films between 2001 and 2014 (SFI 2014). Several of these films are co-productions such as the Norwegian/Swedish animated children’s film Hokus Pokus Alfons Åberg (Torill Kove, 2013), and the majority can be characterised as mediumconcept films like the Oscar-winning Danish film In a Better World (Hævnen, Susanne Bier, 2010). But also represented are straightforward popular genre films like the Norwegian horror vehicle Dead Snow (Død snø, Tommy Wirkola, 2013) and Finnish sci-fi Iron Sky (Timo Vuorensola, 2012). Undoubtedly, it is not difficult to observe significant export patterns within the Nordic region, and the discrepancy between the statistics and the persistent notion that few films are exported must therefore be examined. When considering these 266 Nordic films that were screened at Swedish cinemas, the most obvious observation is the fact that only a handful of these films can be labelled as commercial successes. If one draws a tentative line at 100,000 visitors as a mark of success, only 6 out of the 266 films meet that criterion.1 In fact the average number of tickets sold per film is 9,563. That means that Swedish distributors imported many of these films even though they probably knew by experience that they were not going to have a runaway success on their hands. Accordingly, a majority of the distributors that imported Nordic films catered mainly to the alternative Swedish cinema circuit, that is, to cinemas outside of Svensk Filmindustri’s near-monopoly (SFI 2014). Thus, although there is clear\n\n5\n\ntommy gustafsson and pietari kääpä\n\nevidence of a higher export/import rate than the general perception suggests, these films still have a hard time finding paying audiences in their neighbouring countries. This especially goes for the popular genre films that often gain international recognition on different levels (at film festivals/artistically/commercially), but that nonetheless bomb at the box office in their neighbouring countries. As discussed by Tommy Gustafsson in his chapter on the Nordic horror film in this collection, well-made genre productions like the Norwegian Cold Prey (Fritt Vilt, Roar Uthaug, 2006), the Swedish Wither (Vittra, Sonny Laguna, Tommy Wiklund, 2013) or the Finish Rare Exports (Jalmari Helander, 2010) have been noticed internationally but are often not even exported to the other Nordic countries. A paradox is that the most popular genre, that is, the comedy film in its many different forms and subgenres, also is the most problematic when it comes to export. Jaakko Seppälä’s chapter on the ‘unromantic comedy’ in this collection is a case in point. In order to discuss the question of why popular genre films have had such problems travelling within the Nordic region we will explore two comedy films in relation to national/transnational implications of genre formations and preferences. Significant here are the ways genre acts as a sort of battleground (or alternatively, a more productive soil) for developing domestic film culture as a dynamic part of an international system of cinema. We start with an exception to the rule, the Oscar-nominated Norwegian film Elling (aka Me, My Friend and I, Petter Næss, 2001), a film that managed to cross borders and attract large audiences in all Nordic countries. Elling is a comedy about two men who try to cope with life in Oslo after a long period of institutionalisation. In Norway the film became one of the most widely viewed ever with 769,923 tickets sold (Kino 2014), and in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland it received respectable ticket sales of 91,178, 37,236, 18,819 and 10,657 respectively (SFI 2014; DFI 2014; Lumiere 2014). Elling was an adaptation of Norwegian author Ingvar Ambjørnsen’s novel Brødre i blodet (1996), and although this book was subsequently translated into several languages, Ambjørnsen is more known internationally as a writer of children’s books. Hence, Brødre i blodet, being the third part in a series of four books, could not be used as a selling point for the film version in the other Nordic countries and the main character, Elling, was unknown to people outside Norway. Although reviews do not represent public opinion they are nevertheless important, not least in introducing new films that do not easily fit within the spectrum of domestic productions or Hollywood imports. When reading reviews for Elling, different national sentiments and points of friction, which are closely connected to historic neighbour relations, become quite apparent. In Norway Elling was, not surprisingly, hailed as a ‘beautiful’ and ‘funny’ film, and one reviewer started his review by declaring: ‘Just rejoice: we have a Norwegian audience winner at the movies!’ (Selås 2001). In Denmark the\n\n6\n\nintroduction\n\nreviews had a more condescending tone, perhaps due to historic big–little brother relations as Norway had been a part of the Danish kingdom for several hundred years until 1814. In Politiken, one of Denmark’s biggest daily newspapers, Elling was presented in negative terms: ‘you can hardly call this Norwegian cinema success a work of art’, but the same reviewer nevertheless used typical art house cinema vocabulary when referring to Elling as a ‘chamber play’ and comparing the film with iconographic artworks such John Steinbeck’s novel Of Mice and Men (1937) and Milos Forman’s film One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975) (Skotte 2002). In Sweden, on the other hand, Elling got rave reviews and was considered to be an ‘intelligent comedy’ and a film that ‘represents the best of the new European comedy: saucy, nontrivializing in an easy way, visually distinctive and particularly well played’ (Gentele 2001). However, the Swedish reviews were surprised that Norway even could produce such a film: ‘They not only have oil and lusekoftor, those Norwegians, now they also show that they have humor. And who could have believed that?’ (Hördin 2001), and in Aftonbladet the reviewer tried to explain to its Swedish readers that Elling ‘made you happy’ despite the fact that it was made in Norway (Peterson 2001). While the Norwegian reviews focused on the national pride of an actual Norwegian genre hit in competition with films like that year’s Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (Chris Columbus, 2001) and Bridget Jones’s Diary (Sharon Maguire, 2001), both the reviews in Politiken and Aftonbladet firmly position Elling as a medium-concept film that just happens to be a comedy. That is, this genre film transformed into an art film of sorts when it left the Norwegian national sphere. This is also in line with how Ellen Rees analyses Elling in her chapter on the Nordic ‘quirky feel-good’ genre included in this collection. In an anthology on contemporary Nordic cinema, Nestingen and Elkington ask why the concept of national cinema seems to be more resilient in the Nordic countries than elsewhere, and summarise the reasons for the national concept very widely as a ‘tradition of production and audience taste, institutionalized support for national cinema, and critical and scholarly cinema discourse’ (Nestingen and Elkington 2005: 10). Yet we would like to propose that Elling, and especially the reception of the film, first and foremost is a result of fifty years of institutionalised film politics where national film institutes have sustained a strong emphasis on the qualities and centrality of the idea of ‘valuable’ national cinema on the one hand, and on the other created a distance that has undermined any perceivable cultural, geographical and historical closeness between the Nordic film cultures. However, this cultural closeness is complicated and as Soila, Söderbergh Widding and Iversen assert, ‘[i]deas, novels and the like can be brought from a neighboring country, but they must be subjected to national decoding and\n\n7\n\ntommy gustafsson and pietari kääpä\n\nbe given specific national characteristics’ (1998: 236). The second example where the national complicates the transnational genre ingredients is the most popular series of films that has been produced in Denmark, namely the fourteen instalments of the Olsen Gang series (Olsen-banden) made between 1968 and 1998. The Olsen Gang is a fictional criminal gang led by the ‘genius’ and habitual offender Egon Olsen with his accomplices Benny and Kjeld. The film series portrays the gang’s criminal activities, which often fail, in a harmless and humorous way that appeal to family audiences. For example, three out of the eleven films that have had more than 1 million viewers in Denmark since 1976 have been Olsen-banden films: Olsen-banden ser rødt (Erik Balling, 1976), Olsen-banden deruda’ (Erik Balling, 1977) and Olsen-banden går i krig (Erik Balling, 1978) (DFI 2014). Despite this overwhelming success these films proved impossible to export to the other Nordic countries, even on VHS or DVD.2 The first Danish i­ nstalment, Olsen-banden (Erik Balling, 1968), was exported to Norway where it failed miserably. This, however, inspired Norwegian director Knut Bohwim to make a Norwegian version, Olsen-Banden (1969), that became a huge success and it was followed by thirteen sequels made between 1970 and 1999. The Norwegian versions closely followed the Danish originals story-wise, even though they were not released in the same order. As film scholar Gunnar Iversen points out, the Norwegian Olsen Gang films ‘became more Norwegian over time’, which created vital nationally coded differences, including perceptions that the Norwegian versions were less sentimental than their Danish counterparts, that the jokes were not as rough, and that there were fewer sexual encounters and more scenes that revolved around jokes about alcohol. Accordingly the Norwegian Olsen Gang films became increasingly childfriendly over the years (Iversen 2011: 223–4). Eventually the Olsen Gang emerged in a Swedish version as the Jönsson League in Varning för Jönssonligan (Jonas Cornell, 1981), which was followed by a further seven hugely popular instalments between 1982 and 2000. The first three Swedish films are adaptations of the Danish originals, while the latter are based on Swedish original stories, for example in Jönssonligan dyker upp igen (Mikael Ekman, 1986), where the Jönsson League tries to conduct a heist at IKEA with an elaborate plan. The Swedish versions are even more child- and family-friendly than the Norwegian ones. Alcohol jokes are kept down to a minimum and sexual encounters are absent. Instead, mainly through the acrobatic work of comedy actor Gösta Ekman, the Swedish versions concentrate more on inoffensive slapstick and word-play jokes. Interestingly enough, in Sweden a series of four spin-off children’s films, starting with Lilla Jönssonligan och cornflakeskuppen (Christjan Wegner, 1996), were produced between 1996 and 2006. Here, the main characters from the Jönsson League are portrayed as criminal kids who, in turn, had\n\n8\n\nintroduction\n\na spin-off television series (2001) and no fewer than six popular children’s films (2003–10) in Norway called Olsenbanden jr. (Olsen Gang Jr). And to come all the way to the starting point, this in turn inspired a Danish children’s film version, Olsen Banden Junior (Peter Flinth, 2001), which had moderate success compared with the original films. And to take it even further around the block, a Swedish reboot is in production, Den perfekta stöten (Alain Darborg, 2014), where the story is updated from a comedy to a thriller, and where the criminal characters’ traits are changed to balance altering global and social stratifications, both ethnically and also gender-wise, as the ­exclusively white male constitution of the gang is now challenged by the inclusion of black and female characters. These genre adjustments are in line with those that Michael Tapper discusses in connection with the Easy Money trilogy (Snabba ­cash-­trilogin 2010–13) in this collection, that is, that the ethnic ‘Nordic’ homogeneity has been transformed into a transnational heterogeneity. The step from comedy to the thriller/gangster genre does, although perhaps ­unintentionally in this case, also enhance this film’s odds in the ­international film market, possibly even in the neighbouring Nordic countries – even though it seems more likely that history repeats itself with another round of Danish and Norwegian remakes of this darker version of the Olsen Gang. The Context for Genre: Experimental Examples While certain types of genre films have been the lifeblood of the Nordic film industries, genre has also provided the space of contestation for other forms of cultural politics. The role of popular genres – including horror or science fiction films – has proven especially problematic. Certainly, successful cases of popular Nordic genre productions can be traced back to the silent era. Others, such as the Finnish film The White Reindeer (Valkoinen peura, Erik Blomberg, 1954) combined rudimentary ethnographic filmmaking with horror film ­conventions and went on to considerable accolades at the Cannes Film Festival, amongst others. The White Reindeer, in theme and reception, is a rare example of early popular Nordic genre film due to the fact that it was a critical and commercial success. Had such genre productions been more common during the era, it may not have maintained such an imposing reputation, despite the fact that the film is undoubtedly a very impressive, atmospheric contribution to the genre. Even so, it was often discussed, at least up until the 2000s, as precisely the first of its kind, rather than for its unique qualities as part of a wider corpus of similar genre productions. This success did not, however, set a pattern for other Finnish or Nordic filmmakers to follow, even though sporadic attempts at horror were made. Of these, the Norwegian Lake of the Dead (De dødes tjern, Kåre Bergstrøm,\n\n9\n\ntommy gustafsson and pietari kääpä\n\n1958) combines conventions from the psychological thriller and horror film to atmospheric effect. Drawing in large part on the whodunit genre, but peppering the film with well-chosen ‘fantasy’ sequences, Lake of the Dead has maintained an imposing presence even in the contemporary Nordic film scene, evoking homage in more recent horror films such as Wilderness (Villmark, Pål Öie, 2002). While horror does permeate some of the more artistic works of Ingmar Bergman (the surreal atmosphere of Hour of the Wolf/Vargtimmen (1968) most famously), and Finland saw its first science fiction film with Time of Roses (Ruusujen aika, 1968), the role of such popular genre conventions largely mirrored film politics of the 1960s, the era of the ­establishment of the film foundation structure. During this era, the e­mphasis was squarely on valuable cinema: finding room for popular genre forms p ­ redominantly came in ways where experimentations with these forms made them ‘artistic’ and disassociated them from any popular cultural connections. While a range of popular genre emulations continued to be produced in the 1970s and 1980s, we have only seen intermittent attempts at producing popular genre cinema, from the Icelandic adaptations of the Norse Sagas as revenge narratives to Norwegian attempts at conspiracy thrillers (Orion’s Belt/Orions Belte, Ola Solum, 1985) or Finnish emulations of the slasher (The Moonlight Sonata/Kuutamosonaatti, Olli Soinio, 1988). Underlying the production of these films was an attempt to connect with international trends and compete at the domestic box office. Genre was thus seen as a marketing strategy that would be useful for strengthening the status of domestic film. For example, The Moonlight Sonata took its shape from well-known horror films such as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (Tobe Hooper, 1974) and the concurrently popular slasher genre. For many of its Finnish critics, it was to be commended for its attempts to ground these conventions in Finnish confines, with some even calling it ‘fundamentally Finnish’ (Lumirae 1988). The snowy landscapes and a pervasive sense of the rural gothic were undoubtedly key to achieving this effect even as it was commended for its ability to play with genre conventions. Somewhat surprisingly, half of the film’s 4 million Finnish mark production budget came from the Finnish Film Foundation and the producers went on to receive quality bursaries from the same source. It was not however a major success domestically, with only 37,217 viewers, yet the institutional support enabled a sequel – The Moonlight Sonata II: Street Sweepers (Kuutamosonaatti 2: Kadunlakaisijat, Olli Soinio, 1991), a film with even more input from institutional sources but considerably fewer paying customers as the ticket sales stopped at 12,211. The Moonlight Sonata II: Street Sweepers is emblematic of the circumstances of Nordic popular genre in this period of institutional transformation. While occasionally such popular genre productions did get off the ground in more\n\n10\n\nintroduction\n\nor less all the Nordic countries, overall, the institutions have been hesitant in supporting these sorts of films. This is especially the case when compared to heritage epics – or the so called ‘valuable’ genre productions. While domestic audiences have had a tendency to frequently support both heritage films and popular comedies, imported counterparts of these popular domestic genre productions clearly both dominate the markets and provide a more or less uneven level of competition for them. The problems come from two main areas – the realities of small nation film cultures, operating with small budgets, and the persistent negative reputation accompanying attempts that dare to ‘emulate’ popular genre forms from the confines of domestic production. Action Film in the Global North To explain the difficulties of creating domestic popular genre films capable of competing with imported productions head on, as well as the repeated arguments that films from small nation film cultures ought to reflect their own unique qualities, we turn to two examples of the action film produced in the mid-1980s: the Swedish martial art film The Ninja Mission (Mats Helge, 1984) and the Finnish exploitation film Arctic Heat (Renny Harlin, 1985). They are very consciously moulded from their international counterparts, including the use of action film iconography and violence in ways that were largely perceived as culturally alien in the Nordic countries at the time of production. The Ninja Mission illustrates this well with its somewhat nonsensical narrative focusing on a band of CIA-trained Ninjas who rescue a scientist from the clutches of the KGB. The film is dubbed in English and has in later years been a topic of much fascination on the cult film circuit, receiving VHS releases in several international markets. And certainly it is a product of its time, ironically in the sense that it succeeds well in emulating the standards of popular Cannon fare, down to the sleaze that was often a key ingredient in their success. At the time, though, The Ninja Mission became a hit on the international VHS market that had expanded rapidly from the early 1980s, and Mats Helge directed another eight direct-to-VHS action films in the following years without support from the Swedish Film Institute. Yet, it did not prove to be much of a success at the domestic cinemas, and typically the Swedish Censorship Board made no fewer than ten cuts in the film. Arctic Heat also takes as its theme the contemporaneously popular Cold War tensions between the US and the USSR – a theme that was especially popular with films produced in the US. Produced by the duo of Markus Selin and Renny Harlin, the film’s narrative focuses on three Americans who must break out from a Soviet prison after accidentally crossing over the border from Finland. As an approximation of the currently popular one-man’s-war action genre, exemplified by productions such as Rambo: First Blood Part II (George\n\n11\n\ntommy gustafsson and pietari kääpä\n\nP. Cosmatos, 1985), Arctic Heat provides a prominent showcase for its director’s skills, combining over-the-top action spectacle with a clear sense of the snowy milieu. It is not surprising that Harlin went on to have a lucrative career in directing such snowbound blockbusters as Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990) and Cliffhanger (1993). Yet, the (in)significance of these productions in their domestic context signals the difficulty of producing such pure genre films in small nation contexts. Importantly, they were produced independently of the key institutional organisations of their respective nations – the Swedish and Finnish film institutes. While Arctic Heat would have its most important significance in initiating the path of the Nordic director going on to comparative success in Hollywood (see also Arne Lunde’s chapter in this book), it ran into problems with the media as well as domestic censorship. The problems with the latter are especially intriguing as the fragile balance of the contemporaneous Cold War politics in Finland did not mesh well with the film’s unabashedly anti-USSR arguments. The film was initially banned for its delicate political message, but later was released in truncated form, edited for its violent content. Ultimately, it is a sort of premature attempt to construct a Finnish blockbuster, a notion made apparent by the refusal of the Finnish Film Foundation to finance the film, its problems with censorship in the domestic market, its relative commercial success internationally, and its lack of real impact on the domestic industry. Synergies of Art and Genre The commercial and institutional problems of The Ninja Mission and Arctic Heat are significant for patterns of development within the Nordic film industries. In many ways, these experiments emphasised the difficulties facing producers interested in more explicitly commercial genre production. Markus Selin, the producer of Arctic Heat, for example, faced bankruptcy because of the losses he experienced in the domestic market. Considering all these difficulties, it is no wonder that the role of such genre productions remains on the sidelines for what is considered valuable cinema. These problems have also led to the dominance of the medium concept as a distinctly pragmatic approach to producing genre-ish films. Of course, the work of such ‘auteurs’ as Aki Kaurismäki, Lars von Trier, Thomas Vinterberg, Bent Hamer and others combine genre patterns with experimental characteristics and result in films that lie somewhere between commercial–experimental hybrid and deconstructions of mainstream cinema (see, for example, Ann-Kristin Wallengren’s chapter in this collection). In many ways, such inventive uses of genre continue to structure the ways contemporary filmmakers approach genre, but Nestingen sees the medium concept as something that combines genre patterns from the ‘high\n\n12\n\nintroduction\n\nconcept’ films produced in Hollywood, for example, with relevant and specific social and political themes endemic to the Nordic countries (Nestingen, 2008). He lists a wide range of films in his study of the phenomenon, ranging from the Danish gangster trilogy, Pusher (Nicholas Winding Refn, 1996–2004), to the Finnish romantic war film Ambush (Rukajärven tie, Olli Saarela, 1998). What characterises all these films is the dialogue they construct between imported genre formulas and local material in ways that allow them to be simultaneously relevant for the various institutes that provide them with the official seal of approval, as well as a substantial part of their production capital, even as they promise to deliver something new to the domestic theatres. The dominance of the medium concept is reflected in the chapters included in this collection. They range from ones focusing on the road movie (Römpötti) to horror (Hakola, Gustafsson), from Nordic noir (Norðfjörð, Åberg, Schubart and Tapper) to comedies (Seppälä), docudramas (Lehtisalo) and even the porn industry (Larsson). Underlying all these very different perspectives is the notion that Nordic genre productions combine the politics of the welfare state in transition with thematic areas familiar from international counterparts. In doing so, they work in between art and the popular in ways that set them apart internationally. Such comparisons with international patterns are relevant for understanding the particular contributions Nordic productions bring to developments of film culture on a global scale, and we will return to these debates in the concluding chapter. For now, it may be enough to suggest that the role of Nordic film culture is in a state of flux. Even as more traditional genre productions continue to be extremely popular at the domestic box offices (witness discussion in chapters by Iversen, Laine and Hedling), especially historical and comedic films, it would not be too out of place to suggest that the contemporary scene in the Nordic countries is dominated by the medium concept. Yet the dynamic between art and commerce continues to transform as international-style popular genre productions challenge the role of genre in the Nordic media industries. In the past five years or so, productions that could be characterised as ‘pure’ genre films or ones that flaunt and subvert genre consciously have become ever more visible. These range from spy thrillers such as the Swedish Hamilton (Hamilton: I nationens intresse, Kathrine Windfeld, 2012) to science fiction films like Denmark’s The Substitute (Vikaren, Ole Bornedal, 2007). While the specificities of their respective domestic contexts are inevitably a significant part of these films, the aesthetic and narrative choices they take rarely fit in with the type of sociopolitical commitment seen and preferred in the medium-concept films. For example, whereas in other science fiction, such as the Finnish Lipton Cockton in the Shadows of Sodoma (Jari Halonen, 1995), where the fate of the protagonist, a sort of facsimile of Deckard of Blade Runner (Ridley Scott, 1982), is to inexplicably self-combust whilst lying in bed dressed up as Marilyn\n\n13\n\ntommy gustafsson and pietari kääpä\n\nMonroe, The Substitute has a band of teenage kids defeating the alien menace in a very ‘Spielbergian’ manner. Similarly, Hamilton’s semi-fascist take on protecting his country reminds one more of the antics of 24’s Jack Bauer than the contemplative detectives that characterise much of Nordic noir. Yet, as both of these productions were successful at the domestic box office, their clear genre roots do indicate an increased acceptance of films with unabashed genre aspirations by the domestic finance institutions, but to a much lesser extent by the audiences. A particularly innovative aspect of contemporary genre production has been their international networking (this is addressed in more depth in Kääpä’s chapter on Iron Sky, Timo Vuorensola 2012, and Norwegian Ninja/ Kommander Trehjolt og ninjatroppen, Thomas Cappelen Malling, 2010). The strategies involved are multifaceted. They may be to do with individual producers constructing thinktanks and online platforms for collaboration, or with financing organisations such as the Nordic Film and Television Fund who support integration between the different countries. Often, these areas act in support of one another with the Finnish Film Foundation and the Norsk Filmfond respectively providing support for the producers precisely on the basis of their capabilities in pushing domestic cinema in new directions. Infrastructural transformations are key to understanding the uses of genre as both a domestic marketing strategy and a way for international networking. Indeed, a film like Iron Sky, with little in the way of direct thematic material connecting it to Finland, its context of production, can operate as a vital part of national cinema rhetoric precisely because it shows Finland as a hive of technological and formative innovation. Here, genre provides a platform from which to demonstrate such innovation, as large-scale computerised visual spectacle is ideal for providing a rationale for such shows of talent. What is for sure is that Nordic genre film has conclusively attained such diversity that old delineations between the valuable and the popular genres do not match its complexity. Small Nation Film Cultures in the Global Marketplace In Cannes 2013, a group of Nordic producers headed by Finland’s Tero Kaukomaa (Blind Spot Pictures) and Norway’s Kjetil Omberg (Tappeluft Pictures) publicised a co-production venture called Nordic Genre Invasion. In practice, this was a marketing venture designed to utilise the increasing profile of popular genre in the Nordic countries. Drawing on such international successes as Iron Sky and Dead Snow, the venture was a one-stop shop for Nordic networking. Combining Tappeluft Pictures and Blind Spot with Finland’s Fisher King Production, Sweden’s LittleBig Productions, Germany’s 27 Films Productions and effects company Troll Vfx, the Nordic Genre Invasion\n\n14\n\nintroduction\n\nventure would be a source for international distributors and production companies to participate in such wide-ranging undertakings as the TV series Iron Sky: Houston, We Have a Problem and Dead Snow 2 (Død snø 2, Tommy Wirkola, 2014). By using the reputations generated by their previous successes, as well as the interests of the production houses participating in the venture to produce popular genre film, this venture suggests that Nordicness has now attained a marketable aspect in addition to providing a way to pool production resources from the region. This venture, in all, is one particularly visible aspect of the region’s international aspirations. As Nordic film production becomes more diversified, it is an increasingly obvious fact that the need for a critical collection exploring Nordic genre film and television from a multitude of angles is pressing. Hardly anything is written in English on contemporary Nordic film culture, and even less on popular genre films. Previous scholarship often consists of historical recollections that concentrate on art house films, that is, on ‘valuable’ films. To challenge the canon of literature on Nordic film, this is the first collection to focus on contemporary popular genres. In addition, as we suggested above, Nordic film production and distribution is increasingly based on transnational flow, necessitating that we challenge the focus of much of the Nordic film literature on specific national film cultures. To these ends, Nordic Genre Film explores the five small Nordic cinemas through a transnational perspective. Accordingly, each chapter of the book contains comparisons between the Nordic countries in terms of, for example, style, themes, production, reception, international distribution and intra-Nordic export (or lack thereof). The purpose of this structure is to expand the existing theoretical and methodical use of the space between the local and the regional as well as the international and the transnational. By discussing the transnational circulation of cultural influences and creative industrial frameworks, the chapters take a range of approaches to genre in the Nordic context, from analysing the textual features of individual films to exploring industrial tactics in capitalising on cultural reputations by way of analysing the production, distribution and reception of contemporary genre films. Another aim is to make use of and expand the scope of genre theory, and especially how ‘genre’ can be connected to the regional/transnational implication of genre formations and preferences – a notion of importance considering the transnational scope of collaborative projects such as Nordic Genre Invasion. Significant here are the ways genre acts as an arena within the international system of cinema, and how domestic film cultures adapt to and interact with this forever elaborate genre system, whether the outcomes are mediumconcept films or popular genre films. The notion and the recognition of genre, so often downplayed within the Nordic film cultures, are therefore vital for the understanding of how the media products of a small region of the world\n\n15\n\ntommy gustafsson and pietari kääpä\n\nbecame part of global popular culture. As Nordic film cultures are reaching an increasing level of global recognition, their popular dimensions need critical interrogation in the English language aimed at a wide readership beyond the region – indeed Nordic Genre Invasion is just one particularly visible example of these international dimensions. In addition, Nordic film industries can offer academic film studies an alternative model for understanding globalisation from a small nation perspective. The necessity to take into account this context and its audience/industrial realities allows our discussion to remain relevant even beyond the Nordic countries as they contribute to the ongoing dialogue on the complex flows of cultural circulation and globalisation.

SIBELIUS AND THE RE-EMERGENCE OF THE GREAT MAN BIOPIC Kimmo Laine\n\nThe popular Finnish biopic film Sibelius (Timo Koivusalo, 2003) about the composer Jean Sibelius (1865–1957) is a textbook example of a biopic – so obvious, in fact, that there is a touch of banality involved. There seems to be very little in the film we do not already know – ‘we’ referring here primarily to Finnish audiences or experts on biographies of classical composers. Despite the fact that parts of the film were shot in Latvia and Italy, the film is quite clearly targeted at domestic markets, as it relies on a nationally oriented and nationally limited knowledge of the past. Every element we may expect to be in the film is there: every character involved in cultural life around the fin de siècle, every piece of music, every political event. Up to a point, this is typical of many historical films. In her book Cinematic Uses of the Past Marcia Landy (1996: 19) stresses the element of foreseeability in the genre: ‘Melodrama and history feed on familiarity, ritualization, repetition, and overvaluation of the past to produce a déjà vu sense of “Yes, that is the way it was and is”.’ Further, we might see here a connection to the notion of banal nationalism as introduced by Michael Billig (1995), nationalism as conscious and unconscious everyday practices and habitual patterns of social life that likewise rely on familiarity and unending repetition. And yet, in all its banality Sibelius does tell us about the past and it does resonate with what we think about certain aspects of Finnish, Russian and European history. The aim of this chapter is to consider Sibelius as a popular historical narrative, discussing it in relation to the mechanisms of historical explanation as well as the mode of argument and address used in the film. As\n\n21\n\nkimmo laine\n\nreference points I shall discuss certain other Nordic biopics made during the last few years. Biopic seems to be one of the prominent genres in Scandinavia in the 2000s. Monica Z (2013), for example, has been a huge success in Sweden, and Kon-Tiki (2012) – on the Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl – broke into international markets and became a Norwegian Academy Award nominee. As a genre, biopic seems to be both culturally specific and universal at the same time. While addressing a predominantly national audience, Sibelius also shares many, if not most, of the generic characteristics analysed by George F. Custen (1992) in his classic study of the genre, even if Custen is talking about Hollywood films. And indeed, Hollywood has also produced countless biopics about non-Americans, including Scandinavians like the author Hans Christian Andersen (1952) or the composer Edvard Grieg (Song of Norway, 1970). Return of the Great Man Sibelius premiered in 2003, in the middle of what has been considered a high tide of Finnish film production. After a low point in the early and mid-1990s, there was a dramatic turning point at the end of the decade. By 1999, the top 10 list in Finland was dominated by domestic films. While in 1996 the market share for domestic films was less than 4 per cent, in 1999 the figure was 25 per cent, and has stayed relatively high ever since (Finnish Film Foundation 2014). The reasons for this rise are complex and have been widely discussed in Finland. For now, I shall only mention the strong investment in marketing and positive publicity, audience research and audience targeting – all of which were virtually non-existent in public film policy during the previous decades (see Salmi 2003 and Pantti 2005). One notable characteristic of the film boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s was that a remarkable share of the films either took place in the past or reworked traditional domestic film genres like the lumberjack film (Kuningasjätkä/A Summer by the River, 1998), the ‘rillumarei’-film (Kulkuri ja Joutsen/The Swan and the Wanderer, 1999) or the ‘häjy’-film (Häjyt/The Tough Ones, 1999).1 The boom of domestic films was thus also a boom of historical films and genres. Not only did the turn of the millennium witness a rise in historical films at the expense of films handling contemporary issues, but also the number of biopics grew higher than ever. While the tradition of Finnish biopics originated in the studio era, the output was never very high: Anneli Lehtisalo’s study on biopics lists a mere thirteen feature films made between 1937 and 1955 (Lehtisalo 2011a), and a handful of others were produced during the following decades. In the period between 1999 and 2010 the number of biopics was\n\n22\n\nsibelius and the great man biopic\n\nfourteen. Many of the recent biopics have also been among the highest grossing films of their production years. The increase of interest in the past was not only a cinematic concern. One might argue that around the millennium there was a general rise of attraction to phenomena that historians have referred to as historical culture, public history or heritage industry, in Finland as well as in other parts of Scandinavia and Europe. In Finland this phenomenon has manifested itself in popular history books, historical novels, television series (both fiction and fact), countless debates in newspapers and journals, and on television and Internet sites – involving not only professional historians – over issues like the Finnish civil war of 1918, Finland’s alliance with Germany during the Second World War, or the pro-Soviet politics of the 1970s. Of special interest with regard to biopics is the Great Finns vote that was held in 2004 and surrounded by huge publicity (YLE 2014), arousing a lot of debate. As in the Great Britons vote (2002) that served as a model for the Finnish variant as well as many others, the top of the list was dominated by political and/or military persons like Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim (commander-in-chief during the Second World War and later president) and Risto Ryti (president during the Second World War). Sibelius was number 8, making him the highest-ranking artist on the list. If we take a look at recent biopics, there is a remarkable parallel with the results of the Great Finns vote. Apart from Sibelius, many others on the ‘top 100’ list have been portrayed in recent biopics, among them the author Aleksis Kivi (Aleksis Kiven elämä/The Life of Aleksis Kivi, 2002), the ski jumper Matti Nykänen (Matti, 2006), the singer-songwriter Irwin Goodman (Rentun ruusu/ The Rose of the Rascal, 2001), the author Kalle Päätalo (Päätalo, 2008) and singers Tapio Rautavaara, Reino Helismaa and Olavi Virta (The Swan and the Wanderer, 1999). Several historical minor characters in the Sibelius film, like the author Eino Leino and the fine artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela, were also high on the list. Besides correlating with the Great Finns vote, there are some common themes in most of the recent biopics. First, they are predominantly not only about Great Finns but also about Great Men, which of course is nothing new.2 The protagonists of the biopics produced during the Finnish studio era were invariably men, reflecting an imbalance in Hollywood too: two thirds of the American biopics surveyed by Custen (1992: 103) are about men. Further, many of the recent biopics (for example The Swan and the Wanderer, The Rose of the Rascal, Badding, 2000) concentrate on profound friendships between the protagonist and his male friends, rather than on the heterosexual romance typical of the studio era biopic. A few notable exceptions have been produced lately, however, including Hella W (2011), a biography of the playwright Hella Wuolijoki, and Putoavia Enkeleitä/Falling\n\n23\n\nkimmo laine\n\nAngels (2008), a joint biography of the authors Aila Meriluoto and Lauri Viita. Second, most Finnish biopics, as well as most other historical films made since the late 1990s, take place in the relatively recent past, usually in the post-Second World War decades and sometimes up to the 1980s or 1990s. Therefore, in the terms used by Andrew Higson (2003) in his English Heritage, English Cinema, they would count as period films, historical films or costume dramas, even if classifying them as heritage films would not be as easy: they do not take place among the upper or middle classes, and the issues of national past are not as central to these films as they are to heritage films ‘proper’. In that sense, Sibelius and The Life of Aleksis Kivi are exceptions, the main characters being born around the mid-1800s, and the films being very much about the building of national culture. A third common characteristic is that, in the terminology used by Leo Lowenthal (2006) in his classic study on biographies in American magazines in the early decades of the twentieth century, recent Finnish biopics do not take place in the sphere of political life, nor in the sphere of business and professions, but rather in the sphere of entertainment – that is, they focus on consumption rather than production. Once again, there seems to be a parallel between these films and Hollywood biopics. Custen (1992: 84–5) observes that whereas Hollywood biopics made before the Second World War are dominated by figures from politics, royalty, science and so on, after the war the emphasis shifts to entertainment. In Steve Neale’s (2000: 61) words, ‘the pre-war biopic tends to address its spectators as citizens whereas the postwar biopic tends to address its spectators as consumers of popular culture.’ A similar shift emerged in Finland in the post-war era (Lehtisalo 2011a: 242), but around the millennium the emphasis on entertainment was stronger than ever. Sibelius is arguably a borderline case in this sense. In Lowenthal’s (2006: 127) terms, Sibelius can be characterised an entertainer, even if he hailed from the serious arts rather than the mass entertainment industry. Also, the film addresses its spectators both as consumers (Sibelius was a celebrity with many of his compositions growing very popular in Finland) and as citizens (the film frames Sibelius’s life conventionally in the context of the nineteenth-century national awakening). An emphasis on arts and entertainment can also be seen in recent biopics made in Denmark and Sweden. Besides the idiosyncratic series of biopics by the Swedish veteran director Jan Troell – Hamsun (1996; about the controversial Norwegian author Knut Hamsun), Maria Larssons eviga ögonblick/ Everlasting Moments (2008; about a little-known pioneering photographer), Dom över död man/The Last Sentence (2012; about the journalist Torgny Segerstedt fighting against Nazism) – some of the most notable Nordic biopics have focused on entertainment. Cornelis (2010) and Monica Z are about iconic\n\n24\n\nsibelius and the great man biopic\n\nSwedish popular singers Cornelis Vreeswijk and Monica Zetterlund, respectively, both blurring the boundaries between high and low culture. Dirch/A Funny Man (2011) is a biopic of the popular Danish stage and film comedian Dirch Passer – who in a noteworthy sequence fails when trying to become a serious actor in a stage adaptation of John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men. All of these films share many generic characteristics with Sibelius, as we shall see.\n\nSibelius as a Biopic Sibelius fits perfectly in many of the contemporary trends: it is a historical film and a heritage film, more so, in fact, than most other Finnish historical films of the period; it touches upon issues from the national past, of the ‘origins’ of Finnish cultural life; it is a biopic about the best-known Finnish composer of all; and finally, Sibelius is probably the best-known Finnish person ever, globally. Whether it was because of or in spite of its conventionality, Sibelius turned out to be a success: with its almost 300,000 spectators in cinemas it can be considered a domestic hit. Further, as a biopic Sibelius is in many ways like a prototype of the genre. I would argue that the main difference between Sibelius and the other recent Nordic biopics mentioned above is that while the latter tend to pick one or two narrative threads as their dominant theme, Sibelius tries to cover all the conventional storylines of the genre. One of these is the importance of the family as a source of either support or opposition (Custen 1992: 152–6). As for Jean Sibelius, his childhood family offers opposition, wanting him to pursue the bourgeois career of a lawyer instead of becoming a musician. On the other hand, once he establishes a family and a career in music, his wife Aino turns out to be a faithful muse. In Monica Z the role of the family is clearly the most important source of narrative tension: the unsupportive attitude of Monica’s father is presented as the major hindrance to her rise to the top, and the culmination comes only when the father finally admits that his daughter has an unusual talent. The role of old friends in a biopic is often as dualistic as that of the family (Custen 1992: 161–5). A case in point is Jean’s colleague Robert Kajanus who is at the same time a good friend and an envious fellow composer, ready and willing to manoeuvre himself into a teaching job at the university, yet knowing well enough that Jean would deserve it better than him. In A Funny Man this is highlighted, arguably, as the dominant theme of the film: the professional as well as personal relationship between Dirch Passer and his fellow comedian Kjeld Petersen is often quarrelsome and filled with envy, but all the same, it is presented as the crucial factor behind Dirch’s success as a comic. Further tensions in a biopic typically emerge between the protagonist and members of a given community (Custen 1992: 72–4). In Cornelis these are the s­ tructuring\n\n25\n\nkimmo laine\n\nelements of the narrative: Cornelis Vreeswijk is nonconformist not only as a songwriter but also in his private life, and his impulsive behaviour and heavy drinking lead him into constant conflict with many people, including the authorities. In Sibelius such tensions involve Jean’s teachers who have trouble accepting Jean’s radical musical ideas – this of course is familiar from Amadeus (1984) and many other biopics about artists. Since an important theme involves the national awakening of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, antagonistic relations also rise between the nationally minded artists and Russian officials representing the tsarist power. In a key scene an orchestra plays Jean’s composition Finlandia, which his compatriots recognise as a highly political nationalistic hymn, while the Russian officials are led to believe it is an innocent piece called ‘Fantasy’. On a more personal level, the film follows the generic convention of ‘normalizing genius’ (Custen 1992: 121–8). Besides being exceptional, a person above his contemporaries in his talent and his foresight, Jean is also depicted as a passionate and caring family man. Finally, as Custen (1992: 75–6) reminds us, in a biopic it is customary that with an unusual gift comes unusual suffering. According to a press release ‘Sibelius’s life contains not only success, but also crushing losses and misfortunes.’ Jean encounters money and drinking problems, and he also suffers for his country, first under Russian suppression and later divided by a bloody civil war. The death of his little daughter drives him to despair, and his final tragedy stems from the loss of inspiration and the ability to write music. In addition the film uses cinematic devices typical of biopics, and central among these are flashback structures and montage sequences (see Custen 1992: 182–6). The latter are usually quite short – most often a sequence that condenses a certain event like Jean and Aino’s wedding into a few shots, backed by Sibelius’s music – but flashback is a central structuring element of the whole narrative, as we shall see in a moment. There are, however, other features in the film that are less obvious for a biopic of a classical composer. The most notable is probably an extra-­cinematic one: the background of the auteur, the director/writer/producer of the film, Timo Koivusalo. He started his public career as an entertainer, a popular songwriter, a television show host and a lowbrow comedian whose childlike character Pekko Aikamiespoika (Pekko the Bachelor) starred both in a television sitcom and a series of five films (1993–7). As a film director he is entirely self-taught: having started out directing his own Pekko comedies he gradually made his way to biopics and other more highbrow genres around the turn of the millennium. From biopics about post-war popular singers (The Swan and the Wanderer and The Rose of the Rascal) he moved on to Sibelius and a two-part adaptation of Väinö Linna’s epic novel Täällä Pohjantähden alla/Here, Beneath the North Star (2009–10), but his cultural status still remains somewhat ambiguous. With all the public talk about the blurring boundaries between high\n\n26\n\nsibelius and the great man biopic\n\nand low ­cultures, the in-between ground often seems to be the most difficult to deal with. Thus, the reviewers’ sentiment towards Koivusalo remains close to Dwight Macdonald’s (1983: 37) classic denouncement of ‘Midcult’ as something that ‘pretends to respect the standards of High Culture while in fact it waters them down and vulgarizes them’. Accordingly, some reviewers felt that Koivusalo would be better to focus on what he knows best and leave classical music be (see Suomen kansallisfilmografia 2014). Another less obvious feature of the film is that, as many reviewers complained, there seems to be a lack of drama in the film: there are a few dramatic conflicts, but no such central conflict that would give the film the cohesive structure expected by critics. whereas a typical biopic centres on a turning point in the hero’s life, like the moment of breakthrough (Custen 1992: 206–8), Sibelius tries to cover the whole life of the composer, who died at the age of 91. As a result, the structure of the film is fragmentary, even for a biopic – at least more fragmentary than the structure of a well-made ­mainstream film is supposed to be. Explanation and Argument All of these characteristics of the film – the overall obviousness, the loose structure of the film, the ambiguous position between high and low culture – are relevant when we look at Sibelius as a historical film. As such, Sibelius is undeniably a part of the heritage industry, and it does affect the way we think about the past, about national culture, about social classes, about high and low, and so on. Therefore, it is worth attempting to formulate a way to analyse the film as historical narration. To start with its fragmentary form: what is it that ties the fragments into a story or historical narrative? A fragmented historical account is often referred to as a ‘chronicle’. In Metahistory Hayden White (1990: 5–7) sees the chronicle as something which precedes historical narratives. A chronicle is simply an arrangement of events in the temporal order they happened. When this series of events is shaped into something with a beginning, a middle and an end, and when some of the events are characterised by different kinds of motifs, we are involved with a story. This, however, does not yet constitute historical narration. A story becomes historical writing only when it is provided with the different forms of explanation. Bearing in mind that, according to the reviewers, one of the problems with Sibelius was that the narrative was fragmented, we might say in White’s terminology that Sibelius is not really a historical film but merely a chronicle or – at most – a story film with a beginning, a middle and an end. In this case its mode of argument would be extremely simple: basically a series of separate and unique events put together. But in fact, the film is not quite as fragmented as\n\n27\n\nkimmo laine\n\nthat: there are several narrative and cinematic devices that work in the opposite direction and do provide this film with a slightly more solid form. One of these is the flashback structure, which can be seen as the dominant narrative technique of Sibelius. The film begins with black and white images from a documentary short film made of Sibelius’s funeral with thousands of people honouring the ceremony. The concluding image of this introductory sequence turns into colour, showing the ageing Aino and Jean – played by actors – watch a wedge of cranes fly south. With a quick dissolve we see Jean as a child, also watching cranes fly by. This is, once again, a fairly conventional transition in biopics: the protagonist as an adult pays attention to something allegedly meaningful or metaphorical that brings back memories from an earlier period of his or her life. A strikingly similar transition can be seen in Cornelis, which starts with the protagonist introducing a song about a boy and his parents over the opening credits. We hear the sound of a siren, followed by a flashback that opens with the young Cornelis looking at German bombers flying over his head in the wartime Holland of his childhood. After the introduction, Sibelius is organised as a series of flashbacks. Every now and then we go back to the aged Aino and Jean, living an assumedly harmonious life in their home Ainola, darkened only by Jean’s loss of musical inspiration. The film ends with Aino and Jean once again watching the cranes. One of the cranes breaks away from the wedge and then fades into the blue sky, while the camera tilts down and shows Ainola with the national flag at half-mast as a sign of Jean’s passing away. The image turns into black and white, thus closing the narrative circle, as well as marking the documentary, ‘true-to-history’ quality of the framing shots. These last images are accompanied by Sibelius’s Finlandia, as if to reassert that the fates of the nation and its most celebrated artist are eternally connected. Flashbacks not only organise the narrative structure of a biopic but also affect the modes of argumentation and explanation of the film. Hannu Salmi (1993: 231–2) sees flashback as a most ‘suitable’ device for a historical film. As with historical research, we start with a known result, ask a question, and then with flashbacks explore the historical processes that lead to the result. On the other hand, as Marcia Landy (1996: 20–1) stresses, ‘flashbacks, especially in biopics, often serve to create an organic sense of unfolding events and especially a sense of inevitability.’ While the former mechanism – the historical process of questioning, exploring and answering – is definitely there in Sibelius, I would argue that it is overpowered by the latter. The sense of familiarity is, again, so strong that the historical questions asked by the film are token rather than real, and the overarching flashback structure underlines the goal-oriented, teleological and nationalistic mode of argument (see White 1990: 11–21): the initial flashback scene ends with Jean as a child running\n\n28\n\nsibelius and the great man biopic\n\nafter the cranes and then almost bumping into a troop of marching Russian soldiers, which reminds the spectator of the fact that Finland was still part of the Russian Empire. The circular structure of the film closes not only the composer’s life but also the seemingly inevitable trajectory of the nation into an independent state. Another central means of giving form to the fragments is the strong reliance on intertextuality. The most obvious functions of intertextuality in Sibelius relate to recognition, repetition and ritualisation. We are supposed to recognise, at least up to a point, the different elements referred to: the music, the paintings, the photographs, the characters and so on. In some instances recognition is vital for a basic understanding of the narrative – for example, it might be difficult to comprehend the role of the painter Gallen-Kallela without any preconception of him – but in other cases the basic functions of recognition are about creating verisimilitude on the one hand, and providing the spectator with the pleasure of recognition on the other (see Lehtisalo 2011b). Such pleasure is on offer in other biopics too: typical for the genre is a party scene in Monica Z, where the protagonist, on the verge of rising to stardom, is introduced to the crème de la crème of Swedish cultural life of the sixties, one by one. In terms of intertextuality, the film relies, first, narratively on the commonsense assumptions of history. As Pierre Sorlin (1980: 20) writes: The cultural heritage of every country and every community includes dates, events and characters known to all members of that community. This common basis is what we might call the group’s ‘historical capital’, and it is enough to select a few details from this for the audience to know that it is watching an historical film and to place it, at least approximately. In Sibelius the audience is expected to realise that the civil war has broken out, for example, from the front page of a newspaper that dates from January 1918 and from images of marching men with red armbands. It is this relatively strong dependence on the historical capital of the spectators that makes Sibelius next to inexportable. Second, aurally the film relies on the familiarity and the connotations of Sibelius’s music. The obviousness of the film is further accentuated by a strong emphasis on foreshadowing events, especially with music: many of Sibelius’s compositions are strongly coded in the national consciousness, and when we hear this or that music starting to play on the track, we already know what is bound to happen in the next scene. A case in point is the song Jääkärin marssi (‘The Jaeger March’) that for a Finnish spectator immediately connotes the events of 1917 and 1918: the declaration of independence and the civil war.\n\n29\n\nkimmo laine\n\nThe third form of intertextuality is visual. Stylistically Sibelius can be instantly recognised as a European historical film, since it strictly follows the visual conventions of the genre, relying on what Andrew Higson (2003) has termed ‘mise-en-scène of the modern past’. The colour scheme of the film, for example, tends to emphasise the warmish browns, yellows and reds as a contrast to the blues and greys that often connote the technologised modern society. Another visual intertextual point of reference is the film’s reliance on well-known photographs and paintings. To take just one example, the film dramatises, almost in a tableau-vivant style, the famous painting Symposion (1894) by Akseli Gallen-Kallela, showing Sibelius, Kajanus, the author Adolf Paul3 and the painter himself, boozing up in the restaurant Kämp. The frequent use of paintings and photographs gives the film a specific sense of history as a series of tableux. However, these tableaux are not static and immovable. On the contrary, there is a lot of movement involved: the camera moves almost constantly. There are countless tracking shots, crane shots, pans and tilts in the film that seem to be taking us near the characters or away from them, sweeping the skies or displaying the surroundings. Often a scene begins with a close-up, and then the camera pulls back and reveals a wider view of the site of action. Conversely, a scene might open with an establishing shot that is followed by closer framings, more often within a long shot and a moving camera than by classical decoupage. In terms of historical argumentation, by oscillating between details and wide views, as well as supposedly subjective and objective views, such camera movements tend to emphasise the relation between what is particular and what is general (see Salmi 1993: 225–9). A typical example in Sibelius is a scene where Jean, having just had his family’s blessing to become a musician, passionately plays music with his brother and sister in the tower room of his family’s house. Within one long crane shot the camera pulls out of the window and starts descending, until it shows the tower from a low angle against the sky, once again implying that Jean’s music is more than just ordinary compositions, that is has an almost divine quality. To sum up, together with certain cinematic devices like flashbacks and montage sequences, these intertextual relations provide Sibelius – the first impression of which is unusually fragmented – with a certain form: relying on the historical capital of the audience and the visual imagery and music supposedly familiar from different sources not only ties the scenes together, but also foreshadows the upcoming events. At the same time these intertextual relations also affect, if not actually create, the mode of historical argument employed in the film, however obvious and banal it is in its tendency to rely on what we think we already know.\n\n30\n\nsibelius and the great man biopic\n\nConclusion: This Is How It Was Historical films constitute not only different modes of explanation but also different modes of address, for example, enquiring (‘what was it like?’), ­challenging (‘is this really how it was?’) or counterfactual (‘what if it had been different?’). In the case of Sibelius, and arguably most other mainstream biopics, the mode would rather be between affirming-educational (‘this is how it was’) and affirming-entertaining (‘this is how it felt’). Yet, however limited the scale of most of the contemporary biopics is, there is something conspicuous in the film industry’s and filmmaker’s obsession with the past. Compared with the period from the 1960s until the early 1990s, a much larger proportion of Finnish films have been period films of some kind. This change has been widely noted, and critics have explained this turn to the past in different ways. Most often it has been seen as a ­counter-reaction to large issues like globalisation, Finland joining the European Union in 1995, the collapse of Soviet Union in 1991, millennium anxieties and so on (see Hietala 2003 and Nestingen 2003). All of these phenomena, it is argued, have increased the need to turn back to the issues of national past, national and local identities, and longing for some kind of nostalgic contemplation. I believe that all of these are valid explanations. Certainly, it is easy to agree that history in these films is, in the words of Pierre Sorlin (1980: 208), ‘a useful device to speak of the present time’. However, these explanations are partial, at the most. While a boom of period films definitely seems to exist, the emergence of such a boom is too complex a phenomenon to be reduced to simple cause– effect chains. For now, for the purpose of this chapter, I would like to rephrase the explanation in different terms: all of the aforementioned ­contextual factors – the growing market orientation of film funding and production, the flourishing of heritage industry and different forms of public history, the large-scale changes in national and international politics and economics – have created an atmosphere in which turning to the past is both easy and likely, and in which the filmmakers are more or less encouraged to turn their interest from contemporary issues to those of the preceding decades. Notes 1. ‘Rillumarei’ refers to a cycle of films – as well as popular songs – from the 1950s that featured down-to-earth hobos and gold-diggers and that displayed populist and anti-urban sentiments. ‘Häjy’-films were historical films that took place in the Ostrobothnia region in the late nineteenth century, focusing on conflicts between farmers, officials and outlaws – not unlike westerns. 2. It is worth noticing too that three-quarters of those on the Great Finns list were men. 3. In the painting – or paintings: there are actually two somewhat different versions – the fourth person is usually thought to be the composer Oskar Merikanto instead of Paul.\n\n31\n\nkimmo laine\n\nReferences Billig, Michael (1995), Banal Nationalism, London: Sage.

MAX MANUS: MAN OF WAR AND FLAME & CITRON (FROM A SWEDE’S POINT OF VIEW) Erik Hedling In 2008, both Norway and Denmark delivered major contributions to the cinematic genre of the ‘occupation drama’ (Norwegian), or ‘occupation film’ (Danish): the Norwegian film was Max Manus: Man of War (Max Manus, Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg, 2008) and the Danish Flame & Citron (Flammen og citronen, Ole Christian Madsen, 2008). In Scandinavia, these generic markers refer to many films set during the Second World War and depicting the fates of Danes and Norwegians in the years 1940–5, when their respective countries were occupied by Nazi Germany. Thus, both Norway and Denmark eventually came to be on the victorious allied side of the war. The other Nordic countries had different obligations. Finland was between 1941 and 1944 fighting on the side of Nazi Germany in a savage war against the Soviet Union. This struggle was bound to be lost, and Finland came to switch sides in 1944, making peace with the Soviets and agreeing to evict a German army in northern Finland by military force.1 Sweden, most importantly in the present context, was neutral and kept its independence throughout the war. This chapter will study how Max Manus: Man of War and Flame & Citron can be understood in a Swedish context, referring to Swedish history during the war, textual analyses of mainly the scenes from Sweden in the films, and the reception of the films in Sweden. That is, I analyse Norwegian and Danish perceptions of Sweden during the war, but strictly from a Swede’s point of view. It should be noted that films about the occupation of Norway and Denmark have been very common particularly in Norway, where the occupation drama\n\n33\n\nerik hedling\n\nhas flourished and evolved in the cinema since 1946, including classics like the docudrama Kampen om tungtvannet (Titus Vibe-Müller and Jean Dréville, 1948) and the artistically refined Kalde spor (Arne Skouen, 1962) (Iversen 2011: 145–55). In Denmark, the first occupation film, Den usynlige hær (Johan Jacobsen, 1945) came shortly after the liberation, and the genre peaked in the early 1990s, with films like Drengene fra Sankt Petri (Søren KraghJacobsen, 1991) (Schepelern, 2001: 136, 327). Few films, however, can match the domestic successes of Max Manus: Man of War or Flame & Citron. Sweden’s Relations with Norway and Denmark During the War Research on Swedish actions during the Second World War has become more accessible lately due to several modern scholarly projects being summarised in a single volume written by Swedish historian Klas Åmark; the title of the book can be translated as ‘To Be Neighbour with Evil: Sweden’s Relationship to Nazism, Nazi Germany and the Holocaust’ (Åmark 2011). This chapter will need some recounting of history, and here this will be based on Åmark’s insights. On 9 April 1940 Denmark and Norway were attacked and occupied by Nazi Germany in Operation Weserübung. The aim was to seal off Scandinavia, particularly the northern Swedish iron ore fields, on which the German war effort at this stage was dependent, and especially the sea route from the ice-free shipping harbour at Narvik, from where the iron ore was shipped to Germany in the winter season. Denmark capitulated more or less immediately; Norway resisted for a while, particularly in the sensitive Narvik area, where the Norwegians were aided by the British fleet as well as by allied ground troops. Operation Weserübung caused shock not only in Norway and Denmark, but also in Sweden. Since Narvik was inaccessible by land from inside Norway, and the British navy blockaded the harbour from the sea, the best way to send German reinforcements was by train through Sweden. The Germans demanded three political concessions from the Swedish government: not to organise a corps of Swedish volunteers to go to Norway to fight against the Germans (as the Swedes had done to help the Finns against the Soviets in 1939), not to mobilise its armed forces, and to allow for German transits by Swedish rail to Norway. Sweden conceded, but not entirely. The army was indeed partly mobilised and Sweden also challenged the idea of transiting German soldiers to Norway while there was still fighting going on. In the end Germany did send war materials and soldiers to the battle zone, disguised as ‘humanitarian aid’. When the Germans had successfully concluded the fighting in June 1940, and Norway was fully occupied, regular transit traffic of soldiers on leave from Norway th"
