        "text": "Among those attentively listening in the chamber on Wednesday (5 July), when Vanhanen addressed the European Parliament, was Anneli Jaatteenmaki, one of Finland’s 14 MEPs.\n\nShe was prime minister for a mere two months back in 2003, until forced to resign over suggestions that she had been using leaked secret information against her rival for the premiership Paavo Lipponen. It was Vanhanen who took over as prime minister, which is why he was addressing the European Parliament as president of the European Council and not her. So he has something in common with his Polish counter-part Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz: neither prime minister campaigned in his country’s most recent general election as a prime ministerial candidate."
