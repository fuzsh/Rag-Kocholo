        "text": "Manninen was charged with breaching the official secrets act, while Jaatteenmaki was accused of inciting or assisting him to break the law by leaking the classified documents.\n\nBoth defendants claim they were innocent in the trial at the Helsinki District Court. Jaatteenmaki, who was briefly Finland’s first female prime minister, resigned in June after she was accused of lying about leaking documents to the media relating to the country’s Iraq policy ahead of national elections in March 2003.\n\nShe became prime minister in April after leading her Centre Party to a narrow victory. While campaigning she used the documents to accuse then-Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen of compromising Finland’s neutrality by supporting the US-led war against Iraq.\n\nJaatteenmaki published excerpts from the documents on her website about a meeting between Lipponen and US President George W Bush in December 2002. Parts also were leaked to tabloids.\n\nSpeaking in court yesterday, Jaatteenmaki repeated claims she had not asked Manninen for any papers.\n\nManninen said Jaatteenmaki asked him for information, including documents, about Lipponen’s meeting with Mr Bush.\n\nThe case continues."
