        "text": "The new coalition government of Finland is preparing to appoint a woman as prime minister for the first time in the country's history.\n\nThe centre-left government – formed after four weeks of talks between three political parties – will be led by the Centre Party leader, Anneli Jaatteenmaki, and make Finland, the only nation in Europe with women serving as president and premier. Tarja Halonen was sworn in as the country's first female president in March 2000.\n\nAfter eight years in opposition, the Centre Party gained seven seats in the 16 March election, giving it control of 55 seats in the 200-seat parliament. The Social Democrats, who were formerly in control and who are led by the outgoing Prime Minister, Paavo Lipponen, won two spots to control 53 seats, and agreed to form a government with the Centre Party.\n\nThe Swedish People's Party, which has eight seats and was part of the previous government, agreed to be the third coalition member, giving the new government a majority. The remaining 84 seats are held by several of the 18 parties that ran in the election. After coalition talks ended early yesterday, party officials said the 18-member Cabinet will be split almost evenly, with eight seats apiece going to the Centre Party and Social Democrats. The Swedish People's Party will have two seats.\n\nLaw makers are expected to appoint Ms Jaatteenmaki as Prime Minister today and coalition members will name their government ministers. President Halonen will officially swear in the new government on Thursday.\n\nMr Lipponen, who headed two governments from 1995 to 2003, said he was \"very satisfied with the results\" after the talks ended, but later told Social Democrats that he would not be part of the new Cabinet.\n\n\"After the prime minister question was resolved, I held many talks with good friends and after careful consideration reached the conclusion that I will take duties other than in the government,\" Mr Lipponen said. But he did not clarify what those duties might be.\n\nMs Jaatteenmaki, who led the talks to form the coalition, said compromises were made on all sides to give the parties a fair say in how the government will be run.\n\nThe new government has promised to reduce unemployment, cut corporate and income taxes and increase family allowances. The details are to be released later."
