        "text": "In May, two partners, respectively NOC of Finland and France, visited the premises of the EOC EU Office to organise a study visit in Brussels. The two groups got the opportunity to learn more about EU sport policy by meeting with several representatives of the EU institutions.\n\nOn 16-17 May the French Olympic Committee (CNOSF) organised a visit in Brussels for the participants of its programme “Parcours Ambition Internationale”. Created in 2013, this programme intends to support, every year, French high representatives in their commitment and activities within European and international sport organisations. The 2016/2017 edition of the programme, called “Amélie Mauresmo” promotion, gathered more than 20 participants from different national federations.\n\nParticipants received a comprehensive overview on the EU sport policy with a presentation made by the EOC EU Office, followed by intervention from Luciano Di Fonzo, EACEA, Yves Le Lostecque, Head of the Sport Unit of the European Commission as well as Virgine Rozière, French MEP and Alexandre Husting, attaché at the Luxembourg Permanent representation.\n\nThe objective of the Parcours Ambition Internationale is to improve participants’ ability to evolve in an international environment by exchanging with actors involved in international sport organisations.\n\nOn 24 May the NOC of Finland visited the EOC EU Office as part of their study trip to Brussels. The group consisted of representatives of the member federations of the NOC, and they were provided with an update on the EU sport policy as well as on the EU funding opportunities for sport. In addition, to the Office staff, Policy Officer of the EU Sport Unit, Agata Dziarnowska, gave a presentation to the group. As part of their study trip, the group also visited e.g. the European Parliament, hosted by Finnish MEP Anneli Jäätteenmäki, and the Permanent Representation of Finland to the EU."
