        "text": "Finland's opposition Center Party won Sunday's parliamentary election, putting its leader Anneli Jaeaetteenmaeki in pole position to become the country's first woman prime minister.\n\n\"It's fantastic!\" Jaeaetteenmaeki told AFP after the election\n\nresult was known.\n\n\"Now our work starts. Such support from the people requires us to work for the people and make everyday day life for the Finns better,\" she added.\n\nIn the end, fewer than 7,000 votes separated the winner from the loser, and observers called the outcome the closest result in Finnish election history.\n\n\"The race has been pretty close, I think (Prime Minister Paavo) Lipponen and Jaeaetteenmaeki tried to make the election a fight between the opposition and the government, like in a two party system,\" Tumo Martikainen, a leading political commentator, said.\n\nAs a consequence, the smaller parties suffered from the fight between the two largest parties.\n\nAccording to the final result, the Centre Party won with 24.8\n\npercent of the vote, 2.4 percentage points more than in the 1999 election, giving it 55 seats in the 200-seat parliament.\n\nLipponen's Social Democrats lost, getting 24.5 percent, 1.6\n\npoints more than in 1999, according to the estimate, translating into 53 seats.\n\nAs the Center Party won most seats, the parliament is excepted to ask Jaeaettenmaeki next week to form a government, most likely a conservative coalition encompassing the National Coalition Party, the liberal Swedish People's Party and the Christian Democrats, with\n\n110 seats in total.\n\n\"The Center Party has now the upper hand, and it would be\n\nlogical that it would try to form a conservative government,\"\n\nMartikainen pointed out.\n\nAlternatively, the Greens might be a minor coalition partner,\n\nobservers said.\n\nHowever, observers would not rule out the possibility of the\n\nCentre Party forming a coalition with Lipponen's Social Democrats.\n\nJaeaetteenmaeki herself declined to comment on whom she would prefer having in her coalition cabinet.\n\n\"Now I want to have a little break, and then the real negotiations can start next week,\" she said.\n\nA veteran parliamentarian for the Center Party, the last six\n\nmonths as its chairman, she said she had been working for 16 years to become the Nordic country's first female prime minister.\n\nFinland has already had a woman president for three years, but with limited powers.\n\nThe Conservative National Coalition Party -- a partner in\n\nLipponen's four-party left-right coalition -- became the election's biggest losers, dropping six seats to 40, constituting a 2.5 percentage-point drop in support to 18.5 percent.\n\nThe smaller coalition partners the Left Alliance and the Liberal Swedish Party both showed slides of less than a percentage point in popularity.\n\nThe Greens, the second-largest opposition party, increased its following by 0.7 percentage points, getting 8.0 percent of the votes, or an estimated 14 seats in parliament."
