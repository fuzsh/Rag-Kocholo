        "text": "Just two months after she became Finland's first female prime minister, Anneli Jaatteenmaki said she was resigning yesterday, amid claims that she lied to MPs and the public about the leak of confidential foreign ministry files she used to topple her predecessor.\n\nMs Jaatteenmaki, whose Centre party won a narrow electoral victory in March over the previously ruling Social Democrats, said she would hand in her government's resignation to the president, Tarja Halonen. Leaders of the three coalition parties, the Centre party, the Social Democrats and the Swedish People's party, said they would try to form a new coalition.\n\nThe resignation capped a tumultuous two days triggered by a presidential aide's admission that he had leaked government information to her at her request on talks on Iraq between her predecessor, Paavo Lipponen, and President George Bush.\n\nShe had spent the day being grilled by MPs over allegations that she used the information to falsely accuse Mr Lipponen in election debates of changing neutral Finland's foreign policy, by giving the impression that Finland was part of an anti-Iraq war coalition.\n\nShe told parliament she had not actively sought the secret documents, but a few hours later, Martti Manninen, an aide to the president, said she had asked him for the papers in the run-up to the poll. \"It's impossible for me to serve Finnish citizens in the present circumstances,\" she said. \"The situation has become intolerable.\""
