        "text": "Ms Jaatteenmaki will receive her sentence in two weeks\n\nThe trial of Finland's ex-Prime Minister Anneli Jaatteenmaki has ended with the prosecution's call for fines for her and a former presidential aide.\n\nThey are charged with misappropriating secret foreign ministry documents.\n\nThe information from the documents is widely believed to have helped Ms Jaatteenmaki win last year's elections.\n\nShe had to step down after only two months as Finland's first female prime minister following the allegations and now her career hangs in the balance.\n\nMs Jaatteenmaki was charged with illegally acquiring and leaking confidential documents.\n\nIf found guilty, her political enemies will want her out of parliament and her plans for a seat in the European parliament will be at the very least weakened.\n\nConflicting evidence\n\nIn court the two defendants have been giving conflicting evidence.\n\nMs Jaatteenmaki said she had never asked to see the documents, which detailed talks between her predecessor as prime minister, Paavo Lipponen, and the US President, George W Bush.\n\nThe presidential aide who faxed the documents to her maintained she did ask to see them.\n\nMs Jaatteenmaki had accused Mr Lipponen of undermining Finnish neutrality by promising President Bush to support the Iraq war.\n\nThis information is widely believed to have secured her narrow win against Mr Lipponen, who was her main rival in the parliamentary elections last spring.\n\nSentencing in the case is expected in two weeks."
