The President of Finland is the Grand Master of all three orders. The orders are administered by boards consisting of a chancellor, a vice-chancellor and at least four members. The orders of the White Rose of Finland and the Lion of Finland have a joint board.\n\nThe Order of the White Rose of Finland was established by Gustaf Mannerheim in his capacity as regent (temporary head of state) on January 28, 1919. The name comes from the nine roses argent in the coat of arms of Finland. The order's rules and regulations were confirmed on May 16, 1919, and its present rules date from June 1, 1940. The revised scale of ranks was confirmed most recently in 1985. The original decorations were designed by Akseli Gallen-Kallela. The swastikas of the collar was replaced by fir crosses in 1963, designed by heraldic artist Gustaf von Numers. The honour can be granted for military as well as civilian merit. The ribbon for all classes is ultramarine. The motto of the Order appears on the medallion and is Isänmaan hyväksi, which means in Finnish: \"For the Well-Being of the Fatherland\".\n\nThe President of Finland wears the Grand Cross of the White Rose of Finland with Collar (a neck chain). The Collar is worn four centimetres from either side and hangs at equal distances at the front and back. To the Grand Cross, like also to the Commander marks is awarded with the Brisket Star.\n\nClasses[]\n\nThe classes of the Order of the White Rose of Finland are:\n\nGrand Cross of the White Rose of Finland with Collar\n\nGrand Cross of the White Rose of Finland\n\nFirst Class Commander of the White Rose of Finland\n\nCommander of the White Rose of Finland\n\nFirst Class Knight of the White Rose of Finland\n\nKnight of the White Rose of Finland\n\nCross of Merit of the White Rose of Finland\n\nFirst Class Medal of the White Rose of Finland with golden cross\n\nFirst Class Medal of the White Rose of Finland\n\nMedal of the White Rose of Finland\n\nRecipients[]\n\nGenerally the Grand Cross with Collar is awarded only to foreign heads of state, e.g. to Charles de Gaulle (1962), Josip Broz Tito (1963) and King Birendra of Nepal (1988).
