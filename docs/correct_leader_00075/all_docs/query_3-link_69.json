        "text": "Just three months after she became Finland's first female prime minister, Anneli Jaatteenmaki resigned amid accusations she lied to lawmakers and the public about the leak of sensitive political information during the campaign.\n\nJaatteenmaki, whose Centre Party won a narrow victory in March elections over the ruling Social Democrats, spent the day being grilled by Finnish lawmakers over allegations she used information gleaned from leaked confidential Foreign Ministry documents to unseat former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen.\n\nShe denied she had asked for classified Foreign Ministry documents about Finland's Iraq policy.\n\nShe used the information in the documents in election debates with Lipponen, accusing him of changing neutral Finland's foreign policy by giving American leaders the impression that Finland was part of an anti-Iraq war coalition.\n\nSome of the excerpts were posted on her website.\n\nLipponen and Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja - both Social Democrats - have vehemently denied any change in the country's Iraq or foreign policy.\n\nThey have said that Finns could help in any Iraqi reconstruction but not take part in military actions.\n\nThe scandal, dubbed \"Iraqgate\" by local media, took a new turn when Jaatteenmaki spoke to a full parliament saying she had not actively sought the secret documents.\n\nBut a few hours after the debate in parliament, Martti Manninen, an aide to President Tarja Halonen, said Jaatteenmaki had asked him for the papers.\n\nParty leaders from the Centre Party and the Social Democrats, both in the coalition government, held separate meetings to discuss the fate of the Jaatteenmaki's cabinet.\n\nLawmakers from across the political spectrum demanded a vote of confidence or her personal resignation.\n\nJaatteenmaki's appointment as prime minister in April made Finland the only European country with a female prime minister and president.\n\nHalonen became the country's first woman president in March 2000."
