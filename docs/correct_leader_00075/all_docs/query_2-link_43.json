Context\n\nO\n\nIntroduction – Constitution in Finland – Constitutional Field – History of Constitutional Law – Sources of Constitutional Law – International and European Borderlines – Conclusion INTRODUCTION\n\nThis book about the Finnish Constitution is intended to be a resource for international students and teachers of constitutional law and government. Accordingly, certain groups of readers with a public law background may regard this book as different or at least non-mainstream. The author has relied heavily on his experience in comparative law while struggling to create a volume which is easily accessible to those who know nothing or only very little about the Finnish system. This has to do with the international and comparative tenor of the book. In accordance, national doctrinal experts may feel that some of the stresses here are not fully in concert with national doctrinal constitutional law. Yet, this is something that cannot be avoided in a book that is intended for an international audience and not for national doctrinal purposes. The writing style and emphasis in this book has drawn theoretical inspiration from a great Scandinavian legal realist Alf Ross (1899–1979), instead of from a nationally based doctrinal study of constitutional law. Ross understood the concept of valid law more broadly than is normal in the doctrinal study of law. While this author is not perhaps a devoted follower of all the ideas of legal realism, he has certainly drawn inspiration from some of Ross’s ideas. For the most part, realism is considered to be the tendency to stress the actual workings of the system instead of the written rules. Besides touching on realism, constitutional culture (or\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 1\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\n2 Constitution in General Context\n\nmentality) is stressed throughout this book. Constitutional culture refers here to the cognitive long-term social or mental structure which makes it possible for politicians, civil servants, judges and lawyers to grasp the constitutional environment in which they exist. The choice to follow a modestly realist and culture-oriented path has been made in the spirit of the series entitled ‘Constitutional Systems of the World’ and seeks to offer a realistic and critical overview of the Finnish constitutional system while also discussing fundamental questions about the very nature of constitution and constitutionalism. The text of the Finnish Constitution can be easily downloaded these days from the internet by anyone interested, but the text of the Constitution Act is just a part of the whole system.1 The real trick is to understand law in context. These choices distinguish this book from the one published in the series entitled ‘International Encyclopaedia of Laws’: this book does not follow any set format, but rather a contextual and critical approach is adopted.2 This opening chapter examines the Finnish definition of the field, main features of constitutional history, sources of constitutional law, and finally international and especially European dimensions from the Finnish point of view. The function of this first chapter is to provide a base for later discussions concerning constitutional institutions, rule of law, fundamental rights, constitutional change, and the challenges of the future. This book provides a critical outline of the main principles and doctrines which make up the living Finnish Constitution. The approach entertained covers historical context, institutions, processes, main sources and key principles of valid constitutional law. The focus is on the main characteristics of the system, but nonetheless some import­ant and internationally interesting features are specifically introduced and discussed in order to highlight some of the critical issues of constitutional law in action. First of all we will consider the scope of ‘constitution’ and ‘constitutional law’. WHAT IS THE CONSTITUTION IN FINLAND?\n\nIf we start not from black-letter law but from the constitutional mentality we may say that ‘As to its central parts constitutional law is perfectly well 1\n\nwww.om.fi/21910.htm. I Saraviita, Finland—Constitutional Law: International Encyclopedia of Laws (Kluwer, Alphen, 2009). 2\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 2\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\nConstitution in General Context 3\n\npolitical.’3 This quote comes from the most influential Finnish constitutional lawyer and professor during the twentieth century, Paavo Kastari (1907–91). Many of his ideas are still present through his disciples and through his numerous influential writings. The above quoted sentence starts his extensive book’s preface concerning the Finnish constitutional system and it reflects his general thinking about constitutional law as a whole. His idea encapsulates much of the Finnish manner of conceiving constitutional law as profoundly connected with the political system, yet at the same time highly regarded even in the sense of a binding set of normative rules and principles. This is why this quote serves as an excellent point of departure for this book which analyses and describes the Finnish constitutional system as a living constitution and not merely as a set of written rules or rigid normative principles. Accordingly, instead of detailed description of formal constitutional documents, the text here seeks to outline the context of the Constitution and concentrates on its practical working and interpretations. This book is—and let this be once more underlined—written for an international audience, not for national doctrinal purposes. Consequently, there is not much doctrinal material concerning the proper interpretation and application (ie what ought to be the content of the Constitution) of Finland’s foundational laws. However, due to the legal nature of constitutional law the normative element is not missing even though its role is not crucial to this book. The hard core of Finnish constitutional thinking is easy to detect, at least, if one simplifies it a great deal. In Finland the Constitution is conceived as a sort of a cornerstone of all legislation and exercise of public power. It is regarded as being important by lawyers and politicians as well as citizens and other private parties. In short, the Constitution matters. It contains basic rules and principles on the organisation of the State, checks and balances between government branches and fundamental rights. From the point of view of constitutional comparison and history, the Finnish Constitution Act is a fresh one, which entered into force on 1 March 2000. Even though the written constitutional document is this recent it does not include all of the relevant constitutional rules or principles. Doctrines and practices (even customs) play a considerable role in defining the scope and content of the Constitution. 3 P Kastari, Finnish Constitution [‘Suomen valtiosääntö’] (Suomalainen lakimiesyhdistys, Helsinki, 1977) v.\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 3\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\n4 Constitution in General Context\n\nFrom a purely formal point of view the Constitution is mainly rigid, but in practice it has proved to be somewhat flexible, allowing for different interpretations and practices. Our discussion begins by defining the field, ie what the Constitution means in Finland and what its typical characteristics are, as well as how the Finnish manner differs from other ways of understanding it. However, before discussing the Finnish Constitution it is important to be familiar with the legal system in general, as within the Finnish legal system constitutional law occupies systematically defined place. Private Law and Public Law As is well known, continental European law in the Roman-Germanic legal culture (or so-called civil law) is heavily influenced by the distinction between private law and public law. Often this distinction is said to be based on the Roman law tradition and especially the ius commune tradition which appeared in the Middle Ages and used Roman law as an intellectual and sometimes even substantive point of departure. Basically, in civil law culture private law is regarded as being different from and opposed to public law. The traditional common law attitude has normally resisted this kind of categorical approach to law.4 At the rudimentary level private law deals with matters that are private (eg marriage, heritance, contract, tort, etc) whereas public law deals with the use of public power. In Finland constitutional law, administrative law, tax law, penal law and criminal procedure law are all public law in the strict sense: they deal with the relations between private parties and public power. In practice the term public law normally tends to refer only to administrative and constitutional law. These two areas of law are intertwined in several ways and often it is difficult to draw a clear line between them. Demarcations are shady: for example, environmental law is a mixture of public law and private law but also a mixture of national and international law. So, in general, Finland belongs to the ‘civil law’ culture, as do all the Nordic systems; but the division into public law and private law is not regarded nearly as fundamental as is the case in the heartlands of 4 See JWF Allison, A Continental Distinction in the Common Law (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1996).\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 4\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\nConstitution in General Context 5\n\ncivil law, ie Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands and Spain.5 Private law (yksityisoikeus) in Finland is very much similar to other civil law countries when it comes down to the substance: private rights tend to be defensive protecting mainly private ownership and in general property rights. Public law (julkisoikeus) is traditionally regarded as a barrier protecting private rights against intrusion from public power. Generally speaking, Finnish public law deals primarily with the State itself. This traditional picture has, nevertheless, changed during the last decades: administrative law and public power have experienced privatisation and the ideology of so-called ‘New Public Management’ has brought public procedures closer to those of private corporations. Yet, Finnish public power is still very much governed by the rules of public law. However, the mere distinction into public law and private law has lost some of its earlier significance; sometimes fundamental rights and general rules of administrative law may also have an effect on private organisations (if public duties are privatised). During the last 15 years constitutional law has extended its reach to various branches of law. These developments have been coined as constitutionalisation of the legal system. However, how are the Constitution and constitutional law conceived in Finland? DEFINING THE FIELD\n\nTo start, we may claim that constitutions are generally collections of normative-type rules and principles which lay out the fundamental and superior law of a state. So, if one seeks to analyse or even to describe in a reliable manner a constitutional system one must normally start from the concept of the State.6 This is simply due to the modern state and constitution being closely knitted together, especially in German-Nordic legal culture; and without the State it would prove to be very difficult to grasp the idea of constitution itself.7 This is so because constitutions derive their life-force and legitimacy from certain political communities: they do not live or succeed without a defined political community within which they function. Put simply, a constitution regulates the 5 The expression ‘Nordic’ refers to the Nordic countries which are Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Iceland. 6 See eg, F Venter, Constitutional Comparison (Juta/Kluwer, Lansdowne, 2000) 8–9. 7 See H Kelsen, Reine Rechtslehre (Verlag Österreich, Wien, 1960/2000) 283 ff.\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 5\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\n6 Constitution in General Context\n\nactions and form of this public political community. Ancient Greeks called this politeia (πολιτεα) and they regarded it to be a kind of a soul of the polis (πλης).8 The reasons for this are obvious. A constitution is accepted by and for this same community, and to a large extent it deals with self-regulation of a polity or community, ie the State. This feature does not depend on legal-technical matters, ie is the constitutional document written or unwritten, codified or un-codified, or are there many constitutional documents or just one, etc? We may perhaps claim that in the world of international public law the concept of state seems to be somewhat clear, ie at least there are certain basic ingredients that are normally conceived as being integral elements of a state as a legal entity. Unfortunately, the same does not apply to the concept of constitution. German and Swedish Conceptual Ingredients In Finnish law, as in many other legal and political systems, the concept of constitution (or constitutional law for that matter) is difficult to define in a precise manner. One of the main problems is conceptual and is caused by the constitutional history of Finland. The Finnish concept means literally ‘rule of the state’ or ‘state-order’ (valtiosääntö); it originates from the Swedish statsförfattning of which the Finnish concept is a direct translation. Both the Finnish concept and its Swedish mother-­concept have their background in the German concept of Staatsverfassung. Accordingly, the Finnish ‘rule of the state’, ie constitution means pretty much the same thing as the word constitution in other European countries belonging to RomanGerman legal culture. However, Nordic systems have certain differences with other Roman-German legal-cultural constitutions. Importantly, the expression ‘constitution’ does not mean the same as the more narrow and formal concept of basic law (perustuslaki), which also stems from the German-Swedish conceptual heritage of Grundgesetz/grundlag.9 In the Finnish system there is one separate written enacted constitutional document having the formal hierarchical Grundnorm status. Grundnorm ( perusnormi) here refers broadly to the idea of Basic Norm 8 By far, the most famous of these discussions is the one by Aristotle, Politics, Book III (Αριστοτλης, Πολιτικ, βιβλο Γ ) (Nomiki Bibliothike, Athens, 1993). 9 But see B Auffermann and S Laakso, ‘Gesetzgebung im politischen System Finnlands’ in W Ismayr (ed), Gesetzgebung in Westeuropa—EU-staaten und Europäische Union (VS Verlag, Wiesbaden, 2008) 65–97, 65.\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 6\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\nConstitution in General Context 7\n\nwhich is a legal rule or rather collection of legal key norms that form the underlying basis for the whole legal system. There is no single Basic Norm in the Finnish constitutional system, unlike Hans Kelsen’s (1881–1973) assumption in his legal theory, but mutatis mutandis the written constitutional rules have superiority over other legal norms. The legal-linguistic problem is that this ‘Basic Law’ describes itself as the Constitution of Finland in its section 1, even though it does not cover all that is understood to be material constitutional law. Paradoxically, the document which regards itself as the Constitution of Finland is actually only ‘the Basic Law of Finland’.10 Importantly, the official Swedish translation is Finlands grundlag which translates literarily as ‘Basic law of Finland’.11 Due to these reasons, it would be inaccurate to call this constitutional document the Constitution of Finland, even though this seems to be the translation which Finnish constitutional experts commonly use. Nonetheless, this translation is functionally not accurate. For the benefit of present purposes and to minimise unnecessary conceptual traps, ‘Basic Law’ is henceforth called the Finnish Constitution Act or in short the Constitution Act (abbreviated sometimes as CA). Importantly, the Constitution Act refers to a certain statutory Act and not to the whole Constitution which is clearly a broader concept. Constitutional law, accordingly, is the body of law which governs all such things which are constitutional in a substantive sense. Constitution Act of Finland The Finnish Constitution Act (2000) covers the codified core material regulating the use of public political power and consists of provisions on key organs of the State, how these key organs are appointed, what their main functions are, competences and interconnected 10 Kelsen separated material constitution (materielle Verfassung) and formal constitution (formelle Verfassung). In his theory of law he states that the first one was partly written and partly unwritten (teils aus Normen geschriebenen . . . teils aus Normen ungeschriebenen), whereas the latter was purely a written constitutional document (geschriebene Verfassung), Kelsen, Reine Rechtslehre (1960/2000) 228–29. 11 Constitution Act stipulates that all Acts must be promulgated both in the Finnish and the Swedish language (section 79.4). Accordingly, both languageversions are authentic versions. For Finnish and Swedish as legal languages in Finland, see H Mattila, Comparative Legal Linguistics (Ashgate, Aldershot, 2006) 55–58.\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 7\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\n8 Constitution in General Context\n\nrelations.12 It also deals, although in a broader and more abstract manner, with the organisation of the machinery of public power in general, and the basic principles concerning the structure and usage of its competences. Administrative law deals with similar questions but in more detail. Moreover, the Constitution Act also deals with the constitutional rights and freedoms, setting out the rights and duties of individuals (see chapter four for more detailed definitions). From a theoretical point of view the Act contains norms (altogether 131 sections, in Finnish called ‘pykälä’, ie paragraph) regulating organisation, behaviour of state, competences and rights. It is divided into 13 chapters as follows: (1) fundamental rules, (2) constitutional rights and liberties, (3–4) the Parliament and its activities, (5) the President and the Government, (6) legislating, (7) state finances, (8) international relations, (9) judicial functions, (10) supervision of legality, (11) general outline of public administration, (12) national defence, (13) and final provisions of a legal-technical nature. For an outsider struggling to comprehend the Finnish constitutional system and its peculiarities, the Constitution Act is a reasonably good starting point: it is easy to pinpoint since it calls itself the Constitution Act; it is hierarchically superior in its relation to other Acts and regulations; and it can be changed, amended or repealed only using the same qualified procedure which is required while enacting the Constitution Act itself, ie it must be approved by two parliamentary sessions in between which elections are held, and in the final decision-making the proposal must receive the support of two-thirds of the votes cast in the Parliament. Nonetheless, it must be repeatedly stressed that the Constitution Act covers the Finnish Constitution only partially.13 The Constitution Act is a single piece of legislation which is easy to recognise on a formal basis, whereas the Constitution of Finland is a larger totality which can be recognised only on a substantive basis. In a word, the Finnish Constitution Act is very much a typical, codified, and modern-day constitutional act.14 12 Suomen Perustuslaki 731/1999 [the numerical identification refers to Suomen säädöskokoelma (The Statutes of Finland) which is the official collection of enactments and ordinances, and here it indicates that this Act was passed by the Parliament as Act number 731 in the year 1999. However, it came into force on 1 March 2000]. 13 According to section 1.2, ‘The Constitution of Finland is established in this Constitutional Act’. 14 For a brief overlook see RL Maddox, Constitutions of the World (Routledge, London, 1996) 79–82.\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 8\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\nConstitution in General Context 9\n\nFor the purpose of the Finnish doctrinal study (‘oikeusdogmatiikka’ as in German Rechtsdogmatik) of constitutional law it might be enough, although not according to all writers, to narrow the concept of Constitution merely to the legal-positivistic Constitution Act. Broader sense covers not only the formal Constitution Act but also all those (hierarchically below the Constitution Act) legal regulations that deal with the form and organisation and competencies of the State and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals in their relation to public power. Basically, it encompasses everything that concerns the Constitution in a material sense. Further, this broad material sense of Constitution also covers rules, principles and doctrines created by constitutional practice. These are customary-law-type norms that are conceived as a part of the legally binding Constitution of Finland. The problem with the customary type of rules is that they are difficult to place in the hierarchy of norms; mostly they fill gaps which the codified system leaves empty (see chapter eight). In the Finnish doctrinal writing on constitutional law there have traditionally been differing opinions about the nature and even the very existence of customary constitutional law.15 Partially, this reflects an even more fundamental distinction within constitutional law: the demarcation of law and politics. Some have acknowledged customary rules while others have been more critical towards the concept of binding customary constitutional law. According to Professor Emeritus Antero Jyränki, who was once a disciple of Kastari and today is the leading expert on Finnish constitutional law: ‘The distinction between legal and political Constitution is a sliding one.’16 Debate over customary elements clearly proves this. Be that as it may, the constitutional system itself has been relying and relies to this day partially on certain unwritten and informal rules and principles—this cannot be denied by anyone who cares to really look at how the system actually works and functions, many times in concert but sometimes even in opposition to the text of the Constitution Act (see chapter eight). This fact comes certainly as no surprise to nonpositivistic comparative constitutional research, or as KC Wheare once said: ‘what the Constitution says is one thing, and what actually happens in practice may be quite another’.17 As chapter five will reveal, the 15\n\nSee S Matsui, The Constitution of Japan (forthcoming).

Today this channel for altering constitutional texts indirectly has become a rarity. Even though constitutional culture has transformed the legacy of exceptive Acts it is still present, as we will later see in more detail: this legacy may be regarded as a constitutional ruin, but all the same very much a living ruin (see chapter eight).\n\nConstitutional Culture How can the Finnish system be characterised from a broader comparative point of view? The Finnish constitutional system may be usefully seen in parallel with other Nordic systems. Comparatively speaking, the Finnish constitutional system belongs to Nordic systems which are based on political and constitutional consensus in which there are typically longestablished constitutions combined with legally binding interpretation, added together with some lesser binding customary law features. None of the parliamentary Nordic unitary state constitutions are as difficult to amend or to change as is the constitutional system of the United States, where the written Constitution (1789) is often merely a starting point for constitutional interpretation by judicial organs. What separates the Nordic constitutions from the German and continental European constitutional culture is the fact that there are no separate constitutional courts in any of the Nordic countries. In addition, the Nordic approach differs—perhaps with the exception of Norway—sharply from the American Constitution in the sense that the substance of constitutional law is not mainly based on the decisions of the courts which decide on concrete cases dealing with relations between the public and private sphere. However, even within the Nordic constitutional sphere, Finland’s system seems to be a bit peculiar since instead of a constitutional monarchy it is a republic with a President possessing some significant constitutional competences. Against this backdrop, it may be stressed that the Finnish constitutional system also has certain features that are unusual in today’s constitutional world, as we will see later. In sum, Finland belongs to the sphere of Nordic unitary state constitutions in which the main bulk of the constitutional law is written, but which also gives room and partially recognises the binding force of\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 10\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\nConstitution in General Context 11\n\ndoctrines and some customary constitutional law. Even though Finland has a formal Constitution Act, some important elements of the formally rigid, yet partially flexible Constitution are based on un-codified constitutional rules, principles and some practices having a customary character. Academic study of constitutional law also plays a role, but not to the same degree as in German constitutional culture. Finally, there is no separate constitutional court for interpreting constitutional law in a judicially authoritative manner. In fact, the question of constitutional judicial review of parliamentary legislation has always been a very delicate question in the Finnish system. By and large, a weak form of presidentialism and parliamentary concentrated control of constitutionality of legislation are culturally fundamental characters of the system. Notwithstanding, some of the key features of constitutional culture are facing growing internal criticism; European Union membership and European human rights have stirred much domestic doctrinal discussion and debate. SHORT HISTORY OF FINNISH CONSTITUTIONAL LAW\n\nToday, the Republic of Finland (Suomen tasavalta) has a population of about 5.4 million people; of these 80 per cent belong to the Evangelical Lutheran Church. Finland is an economically prosperous and a politically stable unitary state with a multiparty system. This has not always been the case. Due to the fact that constitutions are intertwined so closely with states means that the history of a state or a nation is of importance while trying to understand a constitutional system. This is also true with the Finnish constitutional system. In spite of this, even though the present Constitution Act entered into effect as recently as 1 March 2000, some parts of the present Act itself may be properly conceived only if constitutional and political history are taken pertinently into account. In short, substantive continuity was all but broken in 2000. Some would say that there is something special in constitutional law in general, whereas for areas of law such as contract law or criminal law the relevance of history is not so crucial. Broadly speaking, we may claim that ‘institutions of government with which public law is concerned develop in very specific ways’.18 This fact forms an obstacle for 18 J Bell, ‘Public Law in Europe’ in M Van Hoecke (ed), Methodology and Epistemology of Comparative Law (Hart, Oxford, 2004) 259–69, 267.\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 11\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\n12 Constitution in General Context\n\ncomprehending foreign constitutional systems without difficulties. Yet, sensitivity toward historical and social contexts is of considerable help while trying to obtain this kind of comprehension. Further, one may even claim that the importance of history within the field of constitutional law is of the utmost importance. Simply put, to understand foreign peculiarities demands knowledge of history, ie knowledge of the contexts of a constitution.19 Without this context the picture of a constitutional system would be too restricted to the mere wording of a formal Constitution Act. How things came into being is an important piece of information in any analysis which claims to be contextual. As famous legal historian RG van Caenegem put it, ‘Today’s constitutional debate would be shallow without knowledge of the historical antecedents.’20 This book is based on the idea according to which constitutional history is of too much importance to be left alone in the scholarly ivory tower; it should be seen as a crucial element if one wishes to understand the different layers of a constitution. In this sense, constitutions are like icebergs of which only the tips are easily seen. The Finnish system, specifically, contains layers from the Swedish rule, Russian rule, period of independence, and the present EU Member State-driven phase. A perfect example is the Code of Procedure (Oikeudenkäymiskaari) which was originally enacted as a part of the Swedish Code of 1734. During the Russian period the Code of Procedure stayed in force and it continued to do so after Finland gained her independence. In fact, this Code is still in force today although in a much different form than originally. However, we may take another example which is closer to the constitutional system: the Constitution Act’s section 125.1 concerns the general qualifications for public office which are ‘skill, ability and proven merit’ (kyky, taito ja koeteltu kansalaiskunto). These qualifications have remained basically the same since they were first introduced in the Form of Government 1772. The layers are dealt with here in chronological order but also in a thematic manner. These layers are intended to set the scene for the discussion in subsequent chapters, not to provide a full historical account.\n\n19\n\ncf F Venter, Constitutional Comparison (Juta/Kluwer, Lansdowne, 2000) 44.

Furthermore, the story of Nordic cooperation in the late 1900s in the legislative field is well known. But, how far back in history should we go for the present purpose? In practice, the knowledge concerning the law of ancient Finns is scarcely known, in accord, actually the constitutional history as we understand it today begins in the Middle Ages. It should be borne in mind that Finland was governed in accordance with Swedish traditions for more than 600 years. Finland was not merely occupied or ruled by Sweden; it was genuinely part of the Swedish realm. This fact carries many significant explanations for anyone trying to understand the Finnish system and its contextual background. For example, constitutional language rights and the legal status of the Swedish speaking part of the population would be impossible to understand without knowledge of the common Finnish-Swedish history. Early Phases Talking about early phases is difficult not only due to the obvious chronological reasons but also due to the terminology; in the modern sense the oldest rules were constitutional in a material sense. Otherwise the old rules would not be regarded as genuinely constitutional in the modern sense as they were temporary and there was no legal hierarchy. Finland became a part of the Swedish State in around the thirteenth century. Constitutional rules, if there were any, were limited to changing customs of personal rule. From the fourteenth century there were different ‘laws of the land’ (maanlaki) or sort of general laws and Royal Codes (kuninkaankaari) in force which all contained various legal rules; some of these were of a constitutional nature regulating the appointing of the Monarch and use of the Crown’s power. The King normally gave, while taking the throne, the King’s Oath or King’s Affirmation (kuninkaanvala) in which certain temporary rules were agreed upon on concerning the reign of the Monarch in question. One may say that these oaths and affirmations were, in their nature, forms of agreement with the Monarch and estates concerning the share and use of power. Their constitutional significance was diminished due to their ad hoc nature. Free\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 13\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\n14 Constitution in General Context\n\nFinnish commoners gained the right to take part in electing the Swedish king in 1362. Yet, these rights were not constitutional in the modern sense, but were like medieval privileges of the estates as corporate bodies. When a new Monarch took the throne, new oaths were taken and agreed upon. In fact, monarchs ruled with the help of the powerful nobility. In other words, rules of governance changed depending on the Monarch in power. The relationship between the ruler and the ruled was pre-constitutional in the sense that it was of a personal nature. In 1544 Sweden was organised permanently in a form of hereditary monarchy by strong-man Gustavus Vasa (ruled 1523–1560). Later, in 1611, the Estates got the King to recognise the partial competency of the Estates to take part in the legislative function in a form of irregularly convening Diet of the Estates (säätyvaltiopäivät). Then, a quasi-constitutional document was enacted in 1617 when a specific Parliament Act (valtiopäiväjärjestys) was formally adapted and entered into force. Looking back, we may claim that the first genuine constitutional document appeared in 1634 when the Estates of the State declared a specific legal document to confirm how the Government must be organised and how it must function when the Monarch is under-aged or outside the country. The real importance for the later development of the constitutional system was, however, in the 1634 document’s rules which laid out the structure of the central government in assisting the Monarch in ruling the State. Constitutionally, the period 1680–1718 has been called the Age of the Sovereign Rule (itsevaltiuden aika). This is the period when Finland’s constitutional history properly started. Nevertheless, no matter what the semi-constitutional documents declared, the State was ruled in a rather autocratic manner from 1693–1719. However, during 1719–23 the first modern constitutional documents came into force and the system was profoundly changed. These constitutional documents were the two Forms of Government (Hallitusmuoto) and novel Parliament Act. This phase really embodied a true separation from the old tradition which contained personal constitutional agreements between the estates and the Monarch. The most important change was made in the 1719 Form of Government which required the Monarch to always comply with the common decision of the Diet of the Estates. This meant, in practice, that the highest political power shifted from the Monarch to the Royal Council and to the estates themselves. Comparatively speaking, these documents and the system\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 14\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\nConstitution in General Context 15\n\nthat they brought about were rather novel in Europe even though they contained the medieval structure of estates. From the point of view of constitutional history, the period 1718– 72 has been called the Age of Freedom (vapauden aika). From today’s perspective we may discern certain weak features of the parliamentary system taking place, which explains why any monarch had difficulties in accepting it. However, the right to take part in using the public power was in fact in the hands of the clergy and nobility; it was by and large their freedom, not the freedom of the peasants. This system was nevertheless completely overturned in 1772 when Gustavus III’s (ruled 1771–92) constitutional revolution in effect dragged the SwedishFinnish Constitution from the frontier-line of constitutional modernisation back to the autocratic past. Constitutional continuity was clearly broken in both letter and spirit. Constitutional Step Back The Form of Government of 1772 practically placed the Monarch in the position of estates and, also, at the apex of the State’s power. In a sense this was a coup d’état in which the Monarch took power away from the Diet of Estates; this was truly the end of the Age of Freedom. The King threatened the estates with the blunt use of military force and several people were arrested as a preventive measure. This backward constitutional development was further strengthened in 1789 when the Deed of Association and Security (yhdistys- ja vakuuskirja) entered into force. The document of 1789 placed hardly any meaningful constitutional restrictions on the competences of the Sovereign. In 1789 Sweden was placed in the constitutional periphery; the rights of the estates were defined according to the borders of the estates. Small glimpses of well hidden enlightment philosophy shown by Gustavus III were not reflected in any questions of great constitutional significance. However, the consent of the Diet was required for new legislation and the imposition of new taxes. This was the constitutional sovereign-friendly landscape when 20 years later Finland was separated from Sweden and annexed to the Russian Empire. The period 1772– 1809 has been called the Gustavian period (kustavilainen aika), although in Finland it lingered all the way up until 1919. There are even today some visible traces of this period in the present Constitution Act and in the constitutional culture: bilingualism,\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 15\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\n16 Constitution in General Context\n\ncontrol of constitutionality and, most importantly, the specific manner for conceiving constitutionalism in general. Obviously, it would be too grand to claim any direct historical line from the 1700s to the 2000s and yet some kind of legal-mental continuity cannot be denied. However, in order to understand how the grip of the Gustavian period came to be exceptionally resilient, a look into the Russian period is needed. Russian Rule—Autonomy (1809–1917) Due to the harsh actions by Gustavus III, Finland’s constitutional documents and the system they brought about lagged behind constitutional developments elsewhere in Europe. Revolutionary ideas were a far cry from the Finnish perspective. After the war, the Russian Emperor Alexander I called the representatives of Finnish estates to the city of Porvoo (Diet of Porvoo, Porvoon valtiopäivät) in which the estates acknowledged the change in highest public power and took an oath in which they promised loyalty to the Emperor, the Russian Czsar. In turn, the Emperor declared to the estates that he would leave in force the traditional (Swedish) constitutional and legal system. In a constitutional sense, this was originally an anachronism: a kind of medieval treaty in which the ruler and the estates agreed on the constitutional basic arrangements in a manner which was completely alien to post-grandrevolutionary constitutional thinking elsewhere in Europe.21 This, too, was the constitutional clock going backwards. Nevertheless, no matter how constitutionally outdated the Act of Porvoo was, later it did have a great amount of significance. Thus, the Grand Duchy of Finland (Suomen suuriruhtinaskunta), being an autonomous part of imperial Russia under the throne of the Emperor, came into being. In Porvoo, Finland for the first time was established as a united political entity which can be called a nation (kansakunta), if not in the strictest legal sense. Constitutionally, this idea of becoming a nation was fundamental: ‘a nation has a right to establish a Constitution’ as Thomas Paine once wrote.22 Perhaps surprisingly, it was during the era 21 O Brunner (Land und Herrschaft 5. Auflage. Rudolf M. Rohrer Verlag, Wien, 1965) spoke of dominion (Herrschaft), accordingly, saying that this sort of pact between the ruler and the estates is not a modern constitutional document but a ‘dominion-pact’, ie Herrschaftsvertrag. 22 T Payne, Rights of Man (Wordsworth, Hertfordshire, 1996/originally published in 1791) 153.\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 16\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\nConstitution in General Context 17\n\nof the Grand Duchy when the development towards the liberal model of constitutional government actually began. However, it was not only the constitutional documents that changed: the political environment brought change into the constitutional sphere also. Constitutionally, the most relevant factor was that the Emperor was understood—at least by the somewhat legalistically and nationalistically oriented Finns—to promise to govern Finland according to its existing constitutional laws. There was a touch of genuine national luck in this: if the constitutional laws had not been so lenient to the very strong position of the Sovereign, the Emperor would most likely not have been so willing to confirm the old constitutional order publicly in Porvoo and in a written form. Finns had now, so it was later largely assumed at least, a kind of Form of Government of their own and thus, for some, even their own Constitution. If this was a kind of constitutional revolution, it was a peculiarly silent one: nothing seemed to happen; no internal political violence broke out even though the 600-year-old connection with Sweden was severed. Constitutional Continuity and Innovations The small relevance of legal and cultural change is a striking feature here. Little was changed when Finland moved under the rule of the Russian Emperor after more than 600 years of union with Sweden. To take an example, the age-old privileges of the Estates were not only preserved as they were but were even extended. However, Finland was spared from Feudalism and land slavery being profound social features of imperial Russia. Instead, in Finland, one of the crucial and striking elements was the factual constitutional continuity and the simple fact was that the large majority of the high public officials remained in their posts. Today, we may realise the bitter irony of a situation in which the Swedish-Finnish troops still fought and died in the North when the elite wowed its loyalty to the new Russian ruler hoping to ensure good positions. This, if anything in Finnish constitutional history, reveals one core-feature of constitutional mentality; a pragmatic approach combined with formal legal points of view and the difference between the elite and the people (ie peasants actually wanted to be loyal to the Swedish Crown). Of course, some organisational changes took place concerning the high level governance. The Czar ruled as the Grand Duke and he was represented in Finland by the Governor-General who acted through the\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 17\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\n18 Constitution in General Context\n\nagency of the Senate.23 The highest domestic governmental organ during this period was the Senate which consisted of two departments: judicial (ie supreme court) and economic (ie ministry). This quintessential structure is even today part of the Finnish constitutional design. From the constitutional point of view, the situation was challenging to say the least. As a result, some innovations were also crafted alongside the continuity. As the Form of Government (1772) and the Deed of Association and Security (1789) were originally engineered for Sweden-Finland, they could be applied only partially. Many of the holes in the system were patched with the help of the Emperor’s Decrees. Nevertheless, Finns later started, during the 1800s, to assume that when Finland was annexed to Russia in 1809, an autonomous state took birth. So, this state of a sort was conceived as an internally sovereign unit, but all foreign policy-related matters belonged under the direct Russian rule. In accordance, Finns thought that the nation’s constitutional Acts could be changed, amended or repealed by the Emperor but only with the express consent of the Finnish Diet of the Estates. This was the old Swedish constitutional tradition, a remnant from the Age of Freedom. In fact, old Swedish ideas were tightened up: Professor Johan Jakob Nordström (1801–74) argued already in 1838 that the constitutional documents of 1772 and 1789 could be touched only with the consent of all four estates. However, the Diet was not called to assembly for a session until the 1860s. Clearly, in the space of 50 years, constitutional pressures were sure to mount even in the silent Grand Duchy. Especially after the 1860s many fundamental features of Finnish constitutional law took birth under Russian pressure, on the basis of Swedish constitutional heritage combined with a slowly growing political consciousness of an awakening nation. However, it must be underlined that all this was possible due to Russian remaining largely a foreign language in Finland and the number of Russians dwelling in Finland remaining low throughout this period. Culturally, the country remained pretty much as it had been during the Swedish period, with the exception that Finnish as an official language started to gain a foothold in a manner which would not probably have been possible under the Swedish Crown. 23 The Governor-General was in fact rather close to the British Monarch’s personal representative in a country, ie Lord Lieutenant. Actually, in historical comparison we may see a certain parallel between the Governor General of Finland and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 18\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\nConstitution in General Context 19\n\nConstitutional Ideology in the Making The Russian period was not always tranquil and constitutionally there were always tensions, although they were not constantly clearly visible. In the constitutional struggle—which was of course fought with political weapons—against the Russian views, professors of public law also gained a new heightened status because they could provide legal arguments backing Finnish interpretations. During those times within what was known as the period of Autonomy, many high profile professors stood against all forms of so-called Russification (ie forced means for making the Finnish system adapt to Russian rules and procedures), this fight started to take on more serious dimensions only in the 1900s. In this legal struggle, learned constitutional arguments were displayed constantly so that, as a by-product, the general Finnish constitutional consciousness also grew remarkably.24 A constitutionally, politically, and historically important milestone was the booklet by Leo Mechelin (1839–1914) entitled, Précis du droit public du Grande-Duché de Finlande (1886) which shaped the understanding of the late 1800s and early 1900s concerning the nature of Finnish constitutional arrangements. During this period, the academic study of constitutional law took it first steps, as a part of the struggle over the existence of a nation. For the later constitutional law doctrine and its academic development, Professor Robert Fredrik Hermanson (1846–1928) was of great importance: he brought many of the central ideas and theories of German public law and 1800s legal positivism to Finland. Hermanson’s actual point was to operate with the concept of state (valtio) and to perceive the Gustavian constitutional documents from the point of view of something which did not actually exist, ie the State of Finland. This creative constitutional engineering by doctrinal experts slowly paved the way to an idea of an independent State. For anyone looking outside the Finnish constitutional system, it is of importance to conceive that some of these autonomy-period originating features have, even today, some role in the constitutional system and more importantly in the constitutional culture; we may speak about the deep roots of Finnish constitutional thinking. The most important of these was the idea that constitutional documents bound the actions of the legislator (ie the Diet and the Grand Duke) and the constitutionality control of 24 See HT Klami, ‘A History of Finnish Legal Science’ in Oikeustiede-Jurisprudentia XIX (Suomalainen lakimiesyhdistys, Helsinki, 1986) 125–276, especially 179–234.\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 19\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\n20 Constitution in General Context\n\nbills started to take place before the Acts came into force, ensuring that Russian-nominated courts could not interfere with this crucial controlfunction. This constitutionality control was taken care of by one of the special committees of the Diet which is still the case today. Finally, an alternative doctrine was crafted to deal with the question of how to resolve a normative conflict between an ordinary Act and constitutional documents without changing written constitutional documents (see chapter eight). Moreover, the weight of constitutional argumentation in general and constitutional attitudes upheld by Finnish political culture originates from the Russian period; later Russification attempts were always countered by legalistically oriented arguments derived from the constitutional documents and the following constitutional doctrine. Finnish constitutional ideology which took shape in the 1800s was later put in use in the 1900s when open and active Russification actually started. Against Amounting Russian Pressure History taught that it would be better to fight political battles through constitutional argumentation. This differs from Sweden where the weight and significance of constitutional law is traditionally generally regarded as something of lesser importance in its relation to democratic institutions and especially the national Parliament (ie Riksdag). The Finnish experience is different from the Swedish. So, even though there was now a constitutional basis the political system was helplessly lagging far behind the European developments of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The main problems were the autocratic governance of the Emperor and the scarcely democratic, corporate, basis of suffrage. In 1905, the massive General Strike led to the Manifesto of November 4 (drafted by Mechelin in the capacity of a leading Finnish constitutionalist) by the Emperor who had been weakened internally by the defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. The Manifesto led to Finnish constitutional reform. The Emperor was not politically strong enough to resist the constitutional pressure at that time. The Manifesto led to the abolition of the Diet of Finland of the four Estates and to the creation of the modern Parliament. Importantly, this also resulted in a temporary halt to the Russification policy. The Manifesto promised and preceded the extensive parliamentary reform of 1906. In this important and far-reaching reform included a unicameral Parliament, guarantees for the political rights of the citizens with\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 20\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\nConstitution in General Context 21\n\nuniversal suffrage, freedom of association and assembly, and freedom of speech and press. These were not so much a genuine sign of liberal constitutional modernism but rather an attempt to create by constitutional means a unified Finnish political front to oppose the Russian pressure. In practice, however, the new freedoms could not be fully exercised due to a lack of final consent from the Emperor. Nevertheless, the establishment of a unicameral Parliament which was elected on the basis of universal suffrage was a huge leap towards a modern political and constitutional system. Later, when the Imperial Government of Russia became paralysed due to the social and political turmoil of 1917, Finns faced a completely novel situation. When the Emperor fell in 1917 the political situation in Finland was in a parallel state of severe crisis: independence was declared on 6 December 1917 and recognised by the Russian Government on 31 December, but the ensuing tragic maelstrom with strong constitutional ingredients simply exploded out of control and bloody internal armed hostilities took place. The birth of the first truly national constitutional document was facilitated by bitter hatred, severe hostilities and a great loss of life. When the new Russia started to transform itself into the Soviet Union, Finland was at the start of its journey to an independent state. The liberation from Russia had occurred in a peaceful manner; however, a violent internal conflict could not be avoided. A bitter Civil War, also known as the War of Independence or Rebellion between the ‘Whites’ and the ‘Reds’, took place in the early months of 1918. In general, the years 1917–19 were a time of grave confusion of all sorts, political and constitutional included.25 To begin with, nobody really knew whether or not the old Swedish constitutional documents were in force fully, partially or not at all. The period of constitutional uncertainty ended after the bloody Civil War; but the dividing lines between the political right (Whites, who won the war) and political left (Reds) persisted long after the war and resembled later happenings in Spain and Greece. Accordingly, even today some features in the Finnish constitutional system may be fully understood only against this historical backdrop. In practice, the Form of Government (Hallitusmuoto) of 1919 ended the constitutional crisis during the infancy of independency.26 25 Obviously, the Civil War was not separate from the general European political, military, social, and national turmoil in 1914–1918. More concretely, the Reds received assistance from the Russians and the Whites from the Germans. 26 The Form of Government (Hallitusmuoto) 1919/94.\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 21\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\n22 Constitution in General Context\n\nIndependent State with a Constitution (1919–) The constitutional compromise of 1919 accurately reflects the sort of middle-way which later made it possible to face the challenge from extreme right-wing and left-wing radicalism. Unlike in Spain and Greece, authoritarian rule was avoided: some sort of constitutionalism, rather slim in many regards, triumphed. From the point of view of later constitutional history, a crucial test for the system was when Finland managed to deflect a coup attempt of the extreme right movement (so-called Lapuan liike) in 1930; legalism and parliamentary democracy were the victors. This was the time when Finland, like many other states after the First World War, was facing a conflict between liberal democracy and the threat of political dictatorship. In Finland the threat of far-right dictatorship was met successfully; legalism prevailed with a partially limited democracy until 1944. This success greatly facilitated the legal-cultural justification of the 1919 Form of Government and evolving constitutionalism. Once again, legal arguments were used instead of weapons. This important constitutional document of 1919 had two central features: first, it constructed a kind of a compromise between presidential and parliamentary models in a manner which was not really familiar elsewhere.27 Second, it reconnected the nation with the continental European constitutional traditions followed by other Nordic countries, and such countries as Belgium, Prussia, and France. Many of the features of the 1919 Form of Government are still present in the contemporary Finnish Constitution, even though in many places the roots reach much earlier than 1919. For example, the President of the Republic enjoys even today relatively extensive competences inherited directly from the Grand Duke, ie the Emperor of Russia which, in turn, were inherited from Gustavus III’s 1772 Form of Government. System Takes Shape The most relevant constitutional differences with the constitutional past were obviously the national sovereignty and republican principle. Even though the 1919 Form of Government included a sharing of executive power between the President and the Council of State (Valtioneuvosto, 27 Yet, there are similar types of arrangements containing similar ingredients as, eg the Greek Constitution (1975) according to which Greece is a ‘presidential parliamentary democracy’ (‘Προεδρευμενη Κοινοβουλευτικ Δημοκρατα’).\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 22\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\nConstitution in General Context 23\n\nie Government in a narrow sense), the Act also contained a parliamentary system: government ministers were made politically responsible to the Parliament. Thus, the Finnish model mixed two markedly different sets of constitutional principles: Montesquieu’s model of separation of powers and the parliamentary model. Accordingly, the system may be characterised as a genuinely mixed form of government. This created a lasting inborn constitutional tension within the institutional design of the system, which is partially still present today (see also chapters two and four). The 1920s was a period of constitutional reform and three other constitutional documents having the formal Grundgesetz position were enacted. These were the Parliament Act of 1928, the Act on the High Court of Impeachment of 1922, and the Ministerial Responsibility Act of 1922.28 To put it concisely, the general constitutional mentality that all of these documents embody is that of the formal principle of the rule of law (laillisuusperiaate), a feature still evidently present in the constitutional culture.29 Each of these four documents was in force as constitutional Acts up until 2000. The tradition of multiple-constitutional-documents was ended by the Constitution Act of 2000 when Finland departed from the Swedish tradition of many hierarchically superior formal constitutional Acts. During their lifespan, these constitutional documents were changed and amended many times, but their basic characteristics remained largely intact until 1995 when the total reform of the system of constitutional rights entered into force, completely changing the Form of Government’s list (one whole chapter of the Act) of constitutional rights and freedoms. Undoubtedly, this transformed the general constitutional atmosphere so that the concept of rights moved much closer to the mainstream hardcore of constitutional law (see chapter seven). However, it would be a great mistake to argue that nothing of interest took place during the period 1920–2000. Actually, in many cases, the Constitution was first interpreted in practice; and later a number of the changes that took place in the living constitutional system were 28 Parliament Act (Valtiopäiväjärjestys 1928/7), Act on the High Court of Impeachment (Laki valtakunnanoikeudesta 1922/273) and Ministerial Responsibility Act (Ministerivastuulaki 1922/274). [The last mentioned Act is referred here under its short title.] 29 A prime example of this is section 2.2 in the present Constitution Act which says that ‘In all public activity, the law shall be strictly observed.’\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 23\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\n24 Constitution in General Context\n\nalso codified into the texts of constitutional documents as formal text amendments. Characteristically, the first steps were taken in practice and only after this in the written form. However, some limited elements remained mainly on the basis of constitutional practice and some traces of customary law emerged even throughout this period dealing with control of constitutionality and powers of the President. It should be underlined that customary law dimensions stemming from the past are not that numerous or practically significant. One may claim that it is a typical Finnish feature to gradually adopt piecemeal changes through consensual political practices and then only later transform these practices into part of a written formal constitutional document. This may be coined ‘constitutional pragmatism’, aided by a certain degree of a somewhat conservative attitude towards formally changing constitutional documents, ie touching the letter of an Act. Nevertheless, when Finland entered the 1990s it was clear that the road of small gradual changes following state practice was beginning to end; not least because of its fragmented nature lacking internal coherence. However, it was Europeanisation that truly triggered the developments which were to come next.\n\nTowards Eurostate and Constitutional Reform (1992–) After the fall of the Soviet Union, Finland had more political freedom than in previous decades. Political freedom in this context refers almost exclusively to the freedom to manoeuvre with regard foreign policy. In 1995, Finland acceded to the European Union together with Sweden and Austria. Nevertheless, the transformation into a ‘Eurostate’ actually started in 1989 when Finland joined the Council of Europe. For a Nordic country, this step was taken relatively late. It was facilitated by the evaporation of fear of negative Soviet reactions after the Soviet Union grew weaker in the years before its demise. In the following year, 1990, Finland formally joined the rest of Europe in the fields of basic rights and liberties. Since 1990, the use of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and referrals to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) have gradually grown from being a rarity to almost normal judicial business. A few years after the accession to the Council of Europe, Finland joined the European Economic Area in 1994 and only a year later the European Union. Both of these\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 24\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\nConstitution in General Context 25\n\nintegrative movements increased pressure toward constitutional reform. Although, it may also be noted, that many of the pressures concerning the Constitution were to a large extent domestic as to their nature. The internationalisation merely provided proper impetus for the domestic pressures to dissolute. As a matter of fact, reform on the Constitution was under consideration long before the Euro-phase took place. Originally the serious work started at the beginning of the 1970s, when the Council of State established an ad hoc Commission of the Constitution (Valtiosääntökomitea 1970). The task was to prepare a draft for the full reform of the Constitution. Even a second ad hoc commission (1974) was appointed for the same task, but harsh political disagreements between left and right wings concerning the role of Government, President and Parliament caused the full reform to fail completely in 1975. Moreover, the President of the Republic withdrew, downright cynically, his earlier backing for the reform, as he feared losing powers, which was a killer blow for the whole reformation process. After this grand failure, preparation of partial reforms was then started and after a long process certain changes were made during the 1980s and more importantly in the1990s. All of the institutional changes were designed to slowly strengthen the parliamentary dimensions and, simultaneously, to gradually weaken the power of the President. However, the basic structure of the constitutional system was left unchanged, reflecting a certain constitutional conservatism while dealing with the essentials of the system. Interestingly, the Finnish system resembled in some of its main characteristics the ideas which the French Constitution of the Fifth Republic also embodies: semi-presidentialism combined with a parliamentary system and a certain innate reluctance to grant power of constitutional judicial review to the courts of law. The period of strong President Urho Kekkonen (in office 1956–81), especially, has been compared with the France of De Gaulle. Today, it is generally accepted in Finland that Kekkonen’s unnaturally long term in office and his personal style of using influential official and unofficial power are the main reasons why the Constitution has been consciously developed in a more parliamentary direction. However, when dealing with the period of Kekkonen one must be careful to avoid too much hindsight. As a matter of fact Kekkonen was not a tyrant: he enjoyed great popularity among the Finnish voters and also among (then) Soviet leaders; it must be said, however, that there were no real alternatives. He had democratic backing\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 25\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\n26 Constitution in General Context\n\nof the voters even though his actions sometimes seemed to bend or go around constitutional rules. Undoubtedly, the most significant reform during the 1990s was the full reform of constitutional rights. This reform meant remodelling the list of constitutional rights in accordance with the ECHR. Whereas to the position of the President it became clear that the Constitution had become outdated because it centralised—according to the prevailing interpretation—the exercise of power in the field of foreign affairs in the President. So, the delegation of power, which would have followed because of the accession to the European Union, would have ripped power from the Parliament and placed it in the hands of the President. To avoid this, some amendments were enacted to the Form of Government ensuring that parliamentary cooperation in matters concerning the European Union was secured. Nevertheless, this was short of meeting the requirements of true constitutional reform. The strategy of small sequential changes to the written constitutional documents had finally come to an end. Reform was also facilitated due to the fact that the President in office at the time, Martti Ahtisaari (in office 1994–2000), was de facto weak when it came to his capability to bar the parliamentary-favouring constitutional reform in making: his sharp protests were mostly ignored as he was an outsider to the political elite and lacked the necessary connections and means. Yet, Ahtisaari was able to leave his imprint on the present Constitution Act’s section 93 which still seems to secure the key role for the President in questions concerning traditional foreign policy. Towards Total Reform All of a sudden things started to move with unexpected speed. In 1996 a parliamentary commission (The Constitution 2000 Commission) was appointed to prepare a proposal for a full constitutional reform at very short notice.30 This work was preceded by the paper of the working group of experts and officials (The Constitution 2000 Working Group), preparing and pinpointing the focal points for the later reform. Among these were the deconstitutionalisation of regulation concerning the 30 Committee Report 1997:13 (Komiteamietintö). [This large report is a detailed paper which concerns the total revision of codified constitutional Act. The number 1997:13 indicates that it is report no 13 in 1997 belonging to the series of Official Printings.]\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 26\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\nConstitution in General Context 27\n\ninternal organisation and activities of the Parliament, a reassessment of the relationship between the highest organs of Government, whether or not Finland’s accession to the European Union should be incorporated in written constitutional law, and how the control of constitutionality of Acts should be arranged. The moment was even surprisingly good for the reform and in fact many of those involved were amazed at the speed and fluidity of the process: attitudes of major political parties were open toward constitutional reform. There were hardly any political differences at all, in sharp contrast with the 1970s. However, this was far from being a miracle: what was attempted was clearly not as ambitious as it had been in the 1970s. The Government Bill (hallituksen esitys) for a new Form of Government was introduced to the Parliament at the beginning of 1998.31 During the procedure the name was changed according to the will of the Parliament into ‘The Constitution of Finland’ (Suomen perustuslaki) and also some minor changes were made to the original text-version of the Bill. The Constitution Act entered into force on 1 March 2000. According to the Act itself, the ‘constitution of Finland is established in this constitutional act’ (section 1). Notwithstanding this, the Act contains only part, even if perhaps the main bulk, of the Constitution of Finland, which also has some other elements to it. To be sure, not all sources of constitutional law are included in the text of the Constitution Act. To give an example, the parliamentary system developed from a President-led version to a normal majority parliamentary system partially without the formal, key constitutional sections being changed, and, this happened before the total reform in 2000. In a characteristically Finnish pragmatic manner, changes took place in the form of actually following constitutional practices. Thus, the new Constitution Act did not alter fundamental constitutional principles already assumed in the political culture. Importantly, when looking at the overall institutional balance, we may claim the following: ‘Parliamentary government did not triumph completely.’32 The long shadow of the Civil War, motivating constitutional engineering covertly, still existed. 31 Government Bill 1998/1. [The Bill submitted to the Parliament on the revision of the Constitutional Act. Numbers indicate that it is no 1 governmental bill in 1998, belonging to the series of parliamentary documents.] 32 A Jyränki, ‘Finland: Foreign Affairs as the Last Stronghold of the Presidency’ (2007) 3 European Constitutional Law Review 297.\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 27\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\n28 Constitution in General Context\n\nSOURCES OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW\n\nIt has been stated that a constitution is by definition ‘a primary source of State law. If it were to lose that essential characteristic it would cease to be a Constitution’.33 This is also true with Finland, even though it does not really answer the question of what the sources of constitutional law are. The Finnish Constitution and the accompanying body of law were defined earlier in this chapter. In Finnish law, the courts of law are normally the interpreters of law and the sources of law (oikeuslähteet) are those which courts (and public officials) turn to in order to judge what the content of law actually is. However, within the constitutional field there are also other important actors, such as the legislator and the executive branch. Unsurprisingly, Finnish general doctrine on the (internal) sources of law is not exactly the same in constitutional law as, generally speaking, in other areas of law. Thus, Finnish law allows for a certain degree of polycentrism concerning different areas of law and the accompanying doctrine on sources of law. Constitutional law in Finland, as in other Nordic countries, has always carried a certain hallmark of constitutional realism in the sense that it has been recognised ‘that not all law is positive in the sense of “formally established”’, as Alf Ross has pointed out in his general theory of law.34 Finnish general doctrine divides the sources of law into three kinds: authoritative strongly binding sources, semi-authoritative weakly binding sources and permitted sources of law that can be used. This same doctrine on sources of law is also used in Sweden and its most famous representation was built by Swedish and Finnish legal theorists Professors Aleksander Peczenik and Aulis Aarnio. We may utilise this division while describing constitutional sources in the following text. However, readers should be notified that this doctrine fits constitutional law only partially. Yet, it is useful especially to foreign readers with scarce knowledge about the Finnish system.\n\n33 F Delpérée, ‘Complementary Sources to Old Constitutional Texts’ in E Smith (ed), Constitutional Justice Under Old Constitutions (Kluwer, The Hague, 1995) 253–66, 253. 34 A Ross, On Law and Justice (University of California Press, Berkeley, 1958) 101.\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 28\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\nConstitution in General Context 29\n\nClassification of Sources The first constitutionally important group of authoritative sources contains formal Acts of Parliament (concerning Parliament, government, the President, judicial organs or fundamental rights) and at the apex there is the Constitution Act which is hierarchically higher than an ordinary parliamentary Act (laki): to enact or to change the Constitution Act requires a two to three parliamentary majority. In a strict legal sense the Constitution Act is the highest internal source of law that holds formal constitutional primacy. Ordinary Acts are ordinary statutes which are passed by the Parliament and are based almost always on the Government’s bill. There are also lower regulations which are also statutes in a material sense, ie this form of legislation also has generally binding legal force, although the issuing authority is not the Parliament. This kind of lower decree-law or in short decree (asetus) is issued by the Government (ie the Cabinet), President of the Republic or ministry. Power to issue decrees is specifically based on direct stipulation in the Constitution Act itself or Parliamentary Act (CA section 80.1). However, if this kind of piece of legislation concerns rights and obligations of private individuals or some other matter which belongs to the scope of parliamentary Acts by virtue of Constitution, then decrees cannot be used. The second group of semi-authoritative sources contains institutionalised sources that actually complement the first group; here there are preparatory works of legislation (lainsäädännön esityöt) and key decisions of the Supreme Court and Supreme Administrative Court. Preparatory works consist of Government bills and Reports of the Parliamentary Committees. Statements by the powerful Constitutional Law Committee of Parliament have a special role as a source of law and especially as a source of the Constitution; namely, these statements are formally only weakly binding sources of law, but in practice they have a much stronger position as de facto authoritative sources for constitutional law interpretation (see chapter three). Generally speaking the role of travaux is crucial to the courts: it is a source which helps to find the actual intention of the legislator. Concerning the Constitution, the Government Bill 1/1998 and Committee Report (Komiteanmietintö) 1997:13 are the most relevant travaux préparatoires. The third group of permitted sources normally consists of the general principles of law, legal doctrine, morality, and comparative arguments. However, in the field of constitutional law these have, generally\n\n(B) Husa Ch1.indd 29\n\n12/11/2010 11:38\n\n30 Constitution in General Context\n\nspeaking, a rather weak position. Instead, the state organ practice and different convention-type rules and principles created by the constitutional actors (government, president, prime minister, and parliament) themselves have a position as permitted sources of constitutional law. These kinds of sources have de facto validity in decision-making because of the material weight of the practical constitutional argument they contain, even though they do not constitute such a distinct and clearly recognised source as constitutional conventions in the United Kingdom.35 However, there have been some changes of importance in the doctrine and in practice. Actually, the ECHR and European Union have created an atmosphere where the legitimacy of the rules and principles seems to be derived m"
