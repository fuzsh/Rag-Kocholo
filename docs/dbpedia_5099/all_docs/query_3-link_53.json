        "text": "IT'S been six long years since the final Harry Potter film came out - and the child actors from the movie are all grown up.\n\nEllie Darcey-Alden and Alfie McIlwain played the young wizard's parents Lily Evans and James Potter in flash back clips from Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part II.\n\nWe already brought you the dramatic transformation of their co-star, Benedict Clarke who played the young Severus Snape, so what do Ellie and Alfie look like now?\n\nEllie was 11 and Alfie 13 when the film came out.\n\nFlame-haired Ellie was already a child actress, having appeared in Holby City and a number of stage productions before her big Blockbuster break.\n\nEllie went on to star in the 2012 Doctor Who Christmas special and started working as a model, voice-over star and advert actress.\n\nThe Oxford-born actress moved to Los Angeles, USA, in 2013.\n\nEllie is now a competitive ballet, jazz and contemporary dancer and, hilariously, a fan of Muggle Quidditch - a bizarre sport often played by university societies.\n\nShe told CNN: \"I think it's brilliant, it's really fun to watch! I didn't realise it was so rough and tough and it's great to just have a go!\"\n\nAlfie, meanwhile, went back to his normal life. He now lives in West London where, according to Wikia, he is one of six kids - and has two dogs and a cat.\n\nThe teen is currently travelling in Thailand - along with hundreds of other Brits his age.\n\nOne things for sure - both youngsters look dramatically different from their big breaks in 2011.\n\nIn more Harry Potter news, your old books could be worth up to £40,000."
