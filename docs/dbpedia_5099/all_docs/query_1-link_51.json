        "text": "Hey all! This post will be about the world‚Äôs biggest Harry Potter convention that is taking place in TWO of the USA‚Äôs biggest cities: Dallas, TX, and Boston, MA.\n\nLeakyCon started in 2009, in the city of Boston and has since traveled all over the globe to cities such as Dublin, London, Orlando, and Chicago. This year the convention celebrates its 10th year.\n\nLast year‚Äôs guests included Devon Murray (plays ‚ÄúSeamus Finnigan‚Äù in the Potter films), Chris Rankin (‚ÄúPercy Weasley‚Äù), Scarlett Byrne (‚ÄúPansy Parkinson‚Äù), Ellie Darcey-Alden (‚ÄúYoung Lily Evans‚Äù), and Dan Fogler and Alison Sudol (‚ÄúJacob Kowalski‚Äù and ‚ÄúQueenie‚Äù of the Fantastic Beasts films). The actors presented in panels, discussing their roles in the Wizarding World movies amongst other things. There were opportunities to purchase s photo with the actors or get their autograph. Although I didn‚Äôt buy any autographs or photos, I randomly saw Devon Murray at the airport and got a free photo with him there! The actors that they bring in every year are different, so if you‚Äôre planning on coming this year, don‚Äôt expect the same people to be there.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of LeakyCon 2017 was the Team Starkid performance. For those of you who don‚Äôt know, Starkid is the theater company who created the Very Potter Musical series. During one of the hour-long panels, 8 of the Starkids performed a number of the songs from the 3 musicals. My family got a picture with them which was a surreal experience for me in particular because I know most of their shows forwards and backwards.\n\nOther panels included house-specific meetups, discussions about obscurials and the future Fantastic Beasts movies, talking about dealing with convention anxiety, specific character discussions, talks with actors and wizard rock artists, and much much more. Every year the panels are different, but there are often one‚Äôs that are repeated.\n\nThe marketplace has hundreds of vendors, selling everything from art, to tee-shirts, to bath bombs, to pins. You never know what interesting things you‚Äôll find! The marketplace is a wonderful place to get a gift for your Potter-loving friends.\n\nOn first full day of programing, there is usually a wizard rock concert. In 2018, artists like Harry and the Potters, Draco and the Malfoys, Tonks and the Aurors, Lauren Fairweather, The Mudbloods, and the Lovegoods were there and performed a ton of songs. It‚Äôs even more fun if you know their music and can sing along with all the other people who love Harry Potter and wizard rock just as much as you do!\n\nIf you live anywhere near Texas or Massachusetts and are a huge Harry Potter fam, I highly recommend that you at the very least check out the tickets: https://www.leakycon.com\n\nHope to see you there!\n\n‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®\n\n-Anna\n\nTonks and the Aurors playing at the wizard rock concert\n\nLauren Fairweather playing at the concert\n\nThe best Boggart Snape cosplay in history!!!\n\nICONIC STARKID COSPLAY\n\nOur Family and the Starkids\n\nMeeting up with friends from a camp in Maine!\n\nme freaking the hECK OUT due to pure joy\n\nmy mom‚Äôs Professor Trelawny costume.\n\nHey all! It‚Äôs been a hot sec since I‚Äôve done a HP related post, and I figured I would talk about one of the best experiences of my entire life: seeing Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on Broadway with my friends and family.\n\nThis February, I had the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see Cursed Child with the OBC (original Broadway cast, for all you non-theater kids out there) and OH MY GOOOOOOOSH words cannot express how much I LOVED IT! I have to keep the secrets, so I can‚Äôt go super into detail, but ahhhhh the magic was surreal.\n\nThe only book premiere I‚Äôve ever been to was for Cursed Child was back in July of 2016, so I feel super connected to the story. I was up all of the next day just reading and rereading the script because it was NEW POTTER, which I hadn‚Äôt been around for before.\n\nAnyways, we getting the tickets was a process, let me tell you. My mom, dad, and I all put our names into a lotto pool to get into another pool, to get a code that gives you the chance to get tickets. We ended up getting them for more than a year ahead, so we had plenty of time to prepare for the trip. We also went to Puffs (another Potter play that I may do a post about later) and Dear Evan Hansen.\n\nAgain, I can‚Äôt say too much about the production because I need to Keep The Secrets, but the show was beyond words. We saw Act 1 on one day and then Act 2 the next day, because each was around 2 ¬Ω hours, so it was a pretty long show. That means that there‚Äôs time for all of the little details that movies leave out. I didn‚Äôt realize how much I was going to love the music either! It was phenomenal and so very powerful!\n\nPossibly my favorite part of the show was the stage door experience we had after the second act. For those of you who don‚Äôt know, the stage door is a place you can go after a show to meet some of the actors. We billeted out of the theatre after the show was done and just barely got out in front of the bars that keep the crazy fans (myself included) away from the actors. After a few minutes, the actors started coming out. We got the chance to exchange a few words with them, have them sign our playbills or posters, and get a quick picture. They were all so kind and gracious and took the time out of their busy schedule to talk to the audience. One man in particular who had played Dumbledore amongst others and talked with us for a solid 2 minutes, which may not sound like much time, but when there are hundreds of people waiting in line, it wasn‚Äôt a common thing to happen. He took a picture with my sister, friend, and I along with one with my parents. The kindness that they all showed us truly made the experience.\n\nThe whole thing still feels surreal even though it‚Äôs been like, 3 months. I definitely want to see it again so I can compare casts, but it almost positively won‚Äôt happen. A gorl can hope though :)\n\nIf any of you ever have the chance to see the show, I highly recommend it! The OBC aren‚Äôt there anymore, but still guys, it‚Äôll be incredible!\n\nBelow are a crapton of pictures of us with the cast and of the theatre ahhh it‚Äôs beautiful üòç\n\nSam Clemmett - Albus Severus Potter\n\nAnthony Boyle - Scorpious Malfoy\n\nPaul Thornley - Ron Weasley\n\nEdward James Hyland - Albus Dumbledore\n\nPoppy Miller - (THE BOOOOK) Ginny Weasley Potter\n\nKathryn Meisle - Dolorus Umbridge"
