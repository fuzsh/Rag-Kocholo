        "text": "We watch several movies a week. Every Friday, we'll talk a little about some of the movies we watched that we felt were Worth Mentioning.\n\nCody endured a whole lot of thrills.\n\nIf you've watched any Lifetime thrillers, you probably know what to expect from Poolboy Nightmares, and Kanefsky delivered exactly the movie viewers tuned in to see. This is a fun movie to watch, and Zagarino gives a great performance as his very off-balance character. He's convincing and captivating as Adam turns Gale and Becca's lives upside down with his insanity.\n\nSCARE ME (2020)\n\nWhen aspiring author Fred (Josh Ruben, who also wrote and directed the movie) rents a cabin in the snowy countryside hoping to be able to get some writing done, despite not having much of an idea for his novel, he finds that a neighboring cabin is occupied by another writer, bestselling author Fanny (Aya Cash). Soon after Fred and Fanny first cross paths, Fred's latest unsuccessful writing session is interrupted by a power outage - and then Fanny shows up at his door.\n\nFred and Fanny quickly decide to pass the time by telling each other creepy stories, and this sort of set-up would have usually been presented as the wraparound story for an anthology film. The two authors would tell each other stories, and we'd actually see the stories they tell get brought to life by other cast members - and, if we saw the things Fred and Fanny were talking about, special effects artists would have had quite a job to do as well. But Scare Me is not an anthology movie, instead it comes off as an acting exercise for Ruben and Cash. There are no cutaways to show the stories they tell, the film stays with them the entire time. We watch Fred and Fanny tell each other several stories.\n\nA lot of viewers will probably be wanting to see the stories brought to life, they might find just watching Ruben and Cash tell the stories to be dull. However, both actors turn in impressive, entertaining performances, so I was perfectly fine with watching them deliver all of this dialogue. To help keep things fresh, they also get a brief visit from a pizza delivery guy named Carlo (Chris Redd), who is enthusiastically on board with this \"tell each other stories\" idea.\n\nShe has a small role, but I have to mention that Rebecca Drysdale also contributes a great, funny performance to the film as Bettina, the woman who drives Fred to the cabin and has some story ideas of her own.\n\nWerewolves, zombies, trolls, revenge - Fred and Fanny tell each other some good stories, and then their interactions fall apart.\n\nWhile I had fun watching Scare Me, I find its 104 minute running time to be a bit much. After all, we are just watching a couple people talk to each other in a cabin for the majority of those 104 minutes. It could have been trimmed down a bit, but it still didn't feel like it was dragging too often."
