        "text": "England 1842\n\nThe Snowman: Don’t need anyone else. I can help you.\n\nWalter (Cameron Strefford): How?\n\n50 Years Later\n\nDr. Simeon (Richard E. Grant): The last of the arrivals has been sampled.\n\nThe Snow Entity: The great swarm is approaching. As humanity celebrates, so shall it end. Will the final piece be ready?\n\nDr. Simeon: It’s in hand. I serve you in this, as in everything else.\n\nThe Snow Entity: And do you keep my secrets, those men who helped us tonight?\n\nDr. Simeon: Won’t be a problem. I promised to feed them.\n\nDr. Simeon: I said I’d feed you. I didn’t say who to.\n\nClara (Jenna-Louise Coleman): Did you make this snowman?\n\nThe Doctor: No.\n\nClara: Well who did? ‘Cause it wasn’t there a second ago. It just appeared… from nowhere.\n\nThe Doctor: Maybe it’s snow that fell before. Maybe it’s snow that remembers how to make snowmen.\n\nClara: What? Snow that can remember. That’s silly.\n\nThe Doctor: What’s wrong with silly?\n\nClara: Nothing. Still talking to you, ain’t I?\n\nThe Doctor: What’s your name?\n\nClara: Clara.\n\nThe Doctor: It’s a nice name. Clara. You should definitely keep it.\n\nClara: Oy. Where are you going? I thought we was just getting acquainted.\n\nThe Doctor: Those were the days.\n\nMadame Vastra (Neve McIntosh): How refreshing to see you taking an interest again. Was she nice?\n\nThe Doctor: I just spoke to her.\n\nMadame Vastra: And made your usual impact no doubt.\n\nThe Doctor: No, no impact at all. Those days are over.\n\nMadame Vastra: You can’t help yourself. It’s the same story every time and it always begins with the same two words.\n\nThe Doctor: She’ll never be able to find me again. She doesn’t even have the name “Doctor”. What two words?\n\nClara popping in: Doctor? Doctor who?\n\nCaptain Latimer (Tom Ward): Who are you? What do you want here?\n\nDr. Simeon: The pond is yours, Captain Latimer. But what is growing inside it—when it is ready—is ours.\n\nJenny (Catrin Stewart): Well Dr. Simeon. You’re out very late tonight.\n\nMadame Vastra: Almost makes you wonder what you’ve been up to. But then I have often wondered about the activities of Dr. Simeon and his exceptionally secret institute.\n\nDr. Simeon: Well I am honored this evening. The veiled detective. And her fatuous accomplice.\n\nJenny: At your service.\n\nDr. Simeon: You realize Dr. Doyle is almost certainly basing his fantastical tales on your own exploits. With a few choice alterations of course. I doubt the readers of The Strand Magazine would accept that the great detective is in reality a woman. And her suspiciously intimate companion.\n\nMadame Vastra: I resent your implication of impropriety. We are married.\n\nJenny: More than can be said for you, eh dear?\n\nMadame Vastra: Now then. This snow is interesting, don’t you think? The ice crystals seem to have a low level telepathic field. Almost as if it can detect and respond to the thoughts and memories of the people around it. Memory Snow. Snow that learns.\n\nDr. Simeon: How fascinating.\n\nMadame Vastra: I hope it’s listening to the right people. It could be a terrible weapon in the wrong hands. Don’t you think?\n\nDr. Simeon: I think winter is coming. Such a winter as this world has never known. The last winter of humankind. Do you know why I’m telling you all this?\n\nMadame Vastra: I’m intrigued.\n\nDr. Simeon: Because there’s not a single thing you can do to stop it.\n\nMadame Vastra: Perhaps I can’t, but I know a man who can.\n\nDr. Simeon: I look forward to meeting him. {he walks off}\n\nJenny: Do you mean The Doctor? He won’t help us. He never helps anymore, you know that.\n\nMadame Vastra: Yes my dear. I do. So pray for a miracle because I think we are going to need him.\n\nStrax (Dan Starkey): They’ve taken samples from snowmen all over London. What do you suppose they’re doing in there?\n\nThe Doctor: This snow is new. Possibly alien. When you find something brand new in the world—something you’ve never seen before—what’s the next thing you look for?\n\nStrax: A grenade!\n\nThe Doctor: A profit. That’s Victorian values for you.\n\nStrax: I suggest a full-frontal assault with automated laser monkeys, scalpel mines and acid!\n\nThe Doctor: Why?\n\nStrax: Couldn’t we at least investigate?\n\nStrax: Sir, permission to express my opposition to your current apathy.\n\nThe Doctor: Permission granted.\n\nStrax: Sir, I am opposed to your current apathy.\n\nThe Doctor: Over a thousand years of saving the universe, Strax, you know the one thing I learned? The universe doesn’t care.\n\nThe Doctor: Sontaran. Clone warrior race, factory-produced. Whole legions at a time. Two genders is a bit further than he can count.\n\nClara: Sir, do not discuss my reproductive cycle in front of enemy girls. It’s embarrassing!\n\nThe Doctor: Typical middle child of six million.\n\nClara: Who are you?\n\nThe Doctor: It doesn’t matter because you are about to forget that you and I ever met. {to Strax} We’ll need the worm.\n\nThe Doctor: Where is it?\n\nStrax: Where’s what, sir?\n\nThe Doctor: I sent you to get the memory worm.\n\nStrax: Did you? When? Who’s he? What are we doing here? Look! It’s been snowing!\n\nThe Doctor: You didn’t use the gauntlets, did you?\n\nStrax: Why would I need the gauntlets?\n\nThe Doctor: Oy! Don’t try to run away. Stay where you are.\n\nClara: Why would I run? I know what’s gonna happen next and it’s funny.\n\nThe Doctor: What’s funny?\n\nClara: Well you’re little pal for a start. He’s an ugly little fella, isn’t he?\n\nThe Doctor: Maybe. He gave his life for a friend of mine once.\n\nClara: Then how come he’s alive?\n\nThe Doctor: Another friend of mine brought him back. I’m not sure all his brains made the return trip!\n\nClara: Neither am I.\n\nThe Doctor: And you’re still not trying to run.\n\nClara: I don’t understand how the snowman built itself. I’ll run… once you’ve explained.\n\nThe Doctor: Clara who?\n\nClara: Doctor who?\n\nThe Doctor: Oo, dangerous question.\n\nClara: What’s wrong with dangerous?\n\nClara: What about the snow? Shouldn’t we be warning people?\n\nThe Doctor: Not my problem. Merry Christmas.\n\nVoice of the Great Intelligence (Ian McKellan): Tonight, the thaw. Tomorrow, the snow will fall again yet stronger. The Drowned Woman and the Dreaming Child will give us form at last. Tomorrow the snow shall fall and so shall mankind. She is coming!\n\nClara: Children are not really my area of expertise.\n\nCaptain Latimer: They are, however, your children.\n\nClara: Everything else is thawed but this pond is still frozen.\n\nClara: Franny, this is important. You dream about her. What do you dream?\n\nFrancesca (Ellie Darcey-Alden): She’s cross with me. She says I’ve been bad and she’s going to coming out of the pond to punish me.\n\nClara: When?\n\nFrancesca: She said she’d come back for Christmas. Tonight.\n\nDigby (Joseph Darcey-Alden): I think Franny’s gone mad, don’t you? I think she needs a doctor.\n\nJenny: Now then! That’s enough noise! We don’t want to attract, attention do we?\n\nClara: I’m looking for The Doctor. Do you know about him? The Doctor?\n\nJenny: Doctor who?\n\nJenny: Madame Vastra will ask you questions. You will confine yourself to single word responses. One word only. Do you understand?\n\nClara: Why?\n\nMadame Vastra: Truth is singular. Lies are words. Words are words. You met The Doctor, didn’t you?\n\nClara: Yes.\n\nMadame Vastra: And now you’ve coming looking for him again. Why?\n\nJenny: Take your time. One word only.\n\nClara: Curiosity.\n\nMadame Vastra: About?\n\nClara: Snow.\n\nMadame Vastra: And about him.\n\nClara: Yes.\n\nMadame Vastra: What do you want from him?\n\nClara: Help.\n\nMadame Vastra: Why?\n\nClara: Danger.\n\nMadame Vastra: Why would he help you?\n\nClara: Kindness.\n\nMadame Vastra: The Doctor is not kind.\n\nClara: No?\n\nMadame Vastra: No. The Doctor doesn’t help people. Not anyone, not ever. He stands above this world. And doesn’t interfere in the affairs of its inhabitants. He is not your salvation nor your protector. Do you understand what I am saying to you?\n\nClara: Words.\n\nMadame Vastra: He was different once. A long time ago. Kind, yes. A hero even. A saver of worlds. But he suffered losses which hurt him. Now he prefers isolation to the possibility of pain’s return. Kindly choose a word to indicate your understanding of this.\n\nClara: Man.\n\nMadame Vastra: We are The Doctor’s friends. We assist him in his isolation but that does not mean we approve of it. So. A test for you. Give me a message for The Doctor. Tell him all about the snow and what fresh danger you believe it presents and above all, explain why he should help you. But do it in one word. You’re thinking it’s impossible such a word exists or that you could even find it. Let’s see if the gods are with you.\n\nMadame Vastra: Miss Clara and her concerns about the snow. I gave her the one word test.\n\nThe Doctor: That’s always pointless. What did she say? Well? Well.\n\nMadame Vastra: “Pond.”\n\nDr. Simeon, sir. There’s someone demanding to see you.\n\nDr. Simeon: No callers. Not in here, not ever. Did he leave his name?\n\nSir. It’s Sherlock Holmes!\n\nThe Doctor: Oh hello! Nice office. Big globe-y thing. Now shut up. Don’t tell me. I see by your collar stud that you have an apple tree and a wife with a limp. Am I right?\n\nDr. Simeon: No.\n\nThe Doctor: Do you have a wife?\n\nDr. Simeon: No.\n\nThe Doctor: Bit of a tree? Bit of a wife? Some apples? Come on, work with me here.\n\nThe Intelligence: We are the Intelligence.\n\nThe Doctor: Oo. Talking snow! I love new things.\n\nThe Intelligence: You are not of this world.\n\nThe Doctor: Takes one to snow one.\n\nDr. Simeon: You must leave here now.\n\nThe Doctor: Shut up. I’m making deductions. It’s very exciting.\n\nThe Doctor: Now, what are you? Eh? A flock of space crystals. A swarm! But the snowmen are foot soldiers. Mindless predators. But you. You’re the clever one. You’re Moriarty. So you turn up on a planet, you generate a telepathic field to learn what you can. When you’ve learned enough… what do you do? You can’t conquer the world using snowmen. Snowmen are rubbish in July. You’ll have to be better than that. You’ll have to evolve. You need to translate yourself into something more, well, human. But to do that you need a perfect duplicate of human DNA in ice form. Where do you find… that?\n\nThe Doctor: What are you doing here?\n\nStrax: Madame Vastra wondered if you were needing any grenades.\n\nThe Doctor: Grenades?\n\nStrax: She might have said help.\n\nThe Doctor: Don’t be clever, Strax, it doesn’t suit you.\n\nStrax: Sorry sir.\n\nThe Doctor: I’m the clever one. You’re the potato one.\n\nStrax: Yes sir.\n\nThe Doctor: Now go away.\n\nClara: There’s a man called The Doctor. He lives on a cloud in the sky. And all he does, all day every day, is to stop all the children in the world ever having bad dreams.\n\nFrancesca: I’ve been having bad dreams.\n\nClara: He’s been on holiday.\n\nDigby: Where did she go? Will she come back?\n\nThe Doctor: Oh don’t worry. She’s currently draining through your carpet. New setting: antifreeze.\n\nClara: It’s cooler.\n\nThe Doctor: Yeah, it is, isn’t it? Bow ties are cool.\n\nClara: No, the room. The room’s getting colder.\n\nDigby: She’s coming back!\n\nFrancesca: What’s she going to do? Is she going to punish me?\n\nThe Doctor: She’s learned not to melt. Of course she’s not really a governess, she’s just a beast. She’s going to eat you. Run.\n\nAlice (Liz White): Captain Latimer, in the garden, there’s snowmen. And they’re just growing. Out of nowhere all by themselves. Look! {she opens the door to}\n\nVastra: Good evening. I’m a lizard woman from the dawn of time. And this is my wife.\n\nStrax: This dwelling is under attack. Remain calm, human scum.\n\nThe Doctor: So. Any questions?\n\nCaptain Latimer to Clara: You have a gentleman friend?\n\nThe Doctor: Your current governess is in reality a former barmaid called Clara. Meanwhile your previous governess is now a living ice sculpture impersonating Mr. Punch.\n\nVastra: You missed this, didn’t you?\n\nThe Doctor: Shut up.\n\nStrax: Sir, please do not noogie me during combat prep.\n\nVastra: Sir, there’s something here they want.\n\nClara: The ice woman.\n\nThe Doctor: Exactly.\n\nClara: Why’s she so important?\n\nThe Doctor: Because she’s a perfect duplication of human DNA in ice crystal form. The ultimate fusion of snow and humanity. To live here the snow needs to evolve and she’s the blueprint. She’s what they need to become. When the snow melted last night, did it melt in the pond?\n\nClara: No.\n\nThe Doctor: Living ice. It will never melt. If the snow gets hold of that creature on the stairs it will learn to make more of them. It will build an army of ice. And it will be the last day of humanity on this planet.\n\nDr. Simeon: Release her to us. You have five minutes.\n\nClara: Doctor, what are you doing?\n\nThe Doctor: Between you and me, can’t wait to find out.\n\nThe Doctor: That was stupid!\n\nClara: You were stupid too!\n\nThe Doctor: Yeah, but I’m allowed. I’m good at stupid!\n\nThe Doctor: No, I do the hand grabbing! That’s my job, that’s always me!\n\nClara: After you.\n\nThe Doctor: After you.\n\nClara: After you. I’m wearing a dress. Eyes front soldier.\n\nThe Doctor: My eyes are always front.\n\nClara: Mine aren’t.\n\nThe Doctor: Stop it!\n\nClara: No.\n\nClara: So you can move your cloud. You can control it.\n\nThe Doctor: No. No one can control clouds. That would be silly. The wind… a little bit.\n\nThe Doctor: So, barmaid or governess, which is it?\n\nClara: That thing is after us and you want to chat?\n\nThe Doctor: Well we can’t chat after we’ve been horribly killed, can we?\n\nClara: How did we get up so high so quick?\n\nThe Doctor: Clever staircase. It’s taller on the inside.\n\nThe Doctor: It’s called the TARDIS. It can travel anywhere in time and space. And it’s mine.\n\nClara: But it’s… Look at it, it’s…\n\nThe Doctor: Go on, say it. Most people do. {she runs around it}\n\nClara: …smaller on the outside.\n\nThe Doctor: Okay. That is a first.\n\nClara: Why are you showing me all this?\n\nThe Doctor: You followed me, remember? I didn’t invite you.\n\nClara: You’re nearly a foot taller than I am. You could have reached the ladder without this. You took it. For me. Why?\n\nThe Doctor: I never know why. I only know who. {he hands her a TARDIS key}\n\nCaptain Latimer: We have to get her inside.\n\nVastra: Those things will kill you.\n\nCaptain Latimer: She’s hurt!\n\nVastra: She’s dead.\n\nThe Doctor: It was my fault. I am responsible for what happened to Clara. She was in my care.\n\nClara: What is the point of blaming yourself?\n\nThe Doctor: None. Because she’s going to live.\n\nClara: The green woman, she said you were the savior of worlds once. Are you going to save this one?\n\nThe Doctor: If I do, will you come away with me?\n\nClara: Yes.\n\nThe Doctor: Well then. Merry Christmas.\n\nThe Doctor: I have in my hand a piece of the ice lady. Everything you need to know about how to make ice people. Is that what you want? See you at the office!\n\nVastra: So then, Doctor. Saving the world again? Might I ask why? Are you making a bargain with the universe? You’ll save the world to let her live.\n\nThe Doctor: Yes. And don’t you think, after all this time and everything I have ever done, that I am owed this one!\n\nVastra: I don’t think the universe makes bargains.\n\nThe Doctor: It was my fault!\n\nVastra: Well then. Better save the world.\n\nThe Doctor: Do you know what this is, big fella?\n\nThe Great Intelligence: I do not understand these markings.\n\nThe Doctor: A map of the London Underground 1967. Key strategic weakness in metropolitan living, if you ask me. But then I have never liked a tunnel.\n\nThe Great Intelligence: Enough of this. We are powerful but on this planet we are limited. We need to learn to take human form. The governess is our most perfect replication of humanity.\n\nVastra: What’s happening to its voice?\n\nThe Doctor: Just stripping away the disguise.\n\nThe Great Intelligence: No, stop! Stop! Cease! I command you!\n\nVastra: It sounds like a child.\n\nThe Doctor: Of course it sounds like a child. It is a child. Simeon as a child. The snow has no voice without him.\n\nThe Great Intelligence: Don’t listen to him. He’s ruining everything.\n\nThe Doctor: How long has the intelligence been talking to you?\n\nDr. Simeon: I was a little boy. He was my snowman. He spoke to me.\n\nThe Doctor: Snow doesn’t talk, does it? It’s just a mirror. It just reflects back everything we think and feel and fear. You poured your darkest dreams into a snowman and look—look what it became!\n\nVastra: I don’t understand.\n\nThe Doctor: It’s a parasite feeding on the loneliness of a child and the sickness of an old man. Carnivorous snow meets Victorian values. And something terrible is born.\n\nThe Great Intelligence: We can go on and do everything we planned.\n\nThe Doctor: Oh yes, and what a plan. A world full of living ice people. Oh dear me. How very Victorian of you.\n\nThe Great Intelligence: Did you really think it would be so easy?\n\nThe Doctor: That’s not possible. How is that possible?\n\nThe Doctor: But you were just Dr. Simeon. You were not real. He dreamed you. How can you exist?\n\nThe Great Intelligence: Now the dream outlives the dreamer and can never die. Once I was the puppet, now I pull the strings.\n\nThe Doctor: There was a critical mass of snow at the house. If something happened there…\n\nVastra: It’s salty. Salt water rain.\n\nThe Doctor: It’s not raining. It’s crying. The only force on earth that could drown the snow: a whole family crying on Christmas Eve.\n\nThe Doctor: We saved the world, Clara. You and me. We really really did.\n\nClara: Are you going back to your cloud?\n\nThe Doctor: No more cloud. Not now.\n\nClara: Why not?\n\nThe Doctor: It rained.\n\nVastra: And what about the Intelligence? Melted with the snow?\n\nThe Doctor: No, I shouldn’t think so. It learned to survive beyond physical form.\n\nJenny: Well we can’t be in much danger from a disembodied intelligence that thinks it can invade the world with snowmen.\n\nVastra: Or that the London Underground is a key strategic weakness.\n\nThe Doctor: The Great Intelligence. That rings a bell.\n\nClara: Run. Run you clever boy. And remember…\n\nThe Doctor: I never knew her name. soufflé Girl. Oswin. It was her. It was soufflé Girl again.\n\nThe Doctor: Something’s going on. Something impossible. Something… Right, you two stay here. Stay right here. Don’t move an inch.\n\nVastra: Are you coming back?\n\nThe Doctor: Shouldn’t think so.\n\nVastra: But where are you going?\n\nThe Doctor: To find her. To find Clara.\n\nJenny: But Clara’s dead. What’s he talking about? Finding her?\n\nVastra: I don’t know. But perhaps the universe makes bargains after all.\n\nFriend (Sophie Miller-Sheen): Don’t you think it’s creepy?\n\nClara: Nah. I don’t believe in ghosts."
