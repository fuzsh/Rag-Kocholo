Press kit here Dec. 1, 1979 Los Angeles California Continental Hyatt House The Doctor Who Convention (Gallifreyan Irregulars) Tom Baker, Graham Williams, Terrance Dicks, Gerry Davis, Don Gallacher (music producer of Mankind's disco version of the theme-tune) Baker and Williams showed up at the eleventh hour; the studio sessions for Shada had been cancelled and they had nothing else to do that weekend. Video room included The Daemons and Nightmare of Eden 1. Baker stayed until the next day to do a signing at Venice Beach. Extensive con report and interview with Baker in Starlog 34. Interview with Dicks in Starlog 37. Ad in LA Weekly. Mar. 1-2, 1980 Los Angeles California Hyatt Regency Who 1 (Gallifreyan Irregulars) Ian Marter, Elisabeth Sladen, Terrance Dicks, Pat Dunlop Report and interviews in Starlog 42. Sladen's appearance mentioned in the Liverpool Echo.

Guests are only there on the 16th, due to an air-traffic controllers strike that delayed their flight. Videos shown include The Edge of Destruction, The Rescue, An Unearthly Child 1. Interviews with JNT and Davison in Fantastic Films 28, Fantasy Empire 4, and Davison in Starlog 62, article in Tulsa World. Con organizer Barbara Elder was interviewed by Variety Feb. 5-7, 1982 Fort Lauderdale Florida Oceanside Holiday Inn Omnicon III John Nathan-Turner, Jeremy Bulloch (Boba Fett), Nicholas Courtney (1st con) Generic SF convention. It was here that Bulloch hinted to JNT that he'd like to appear in Doctor Who again. It didn't happen. Courtney often spoke of his first-ever US convention where he encountered lots of female fans dressed as the Brigadier. (In his autobiography, \"Still Getting Away With It\" (2005), Courtney says his first US con was at the Holiday Inn in Fort Lauderdale, in 1982 - soon after he'd finished filming Mawdryn Undead. However, this event was six months before he worked on Mawdryn Undead; we feel sure Courtney is misremembering things. He isn't getting the year wrong and mixing this up with the 1983 Omnicon IV (see below) because he wasn't there; indeed none of the newspaper or fanzine reports on that event mention him. July 16-18, 1982 Chicago Illinois Americana Congress Panopticon West II John Nathan-Turner, Sarah Sutton, Elisabeth Sladen, Terry Nation, Anthony Ainley, Terry Sampson (BBC Enterprises) Also known as \"Sweatcon\". There were between 3,000 and 6,000 attendees each day, and no air-conditioning! Recording on Arc of Infinity had just been completed; Nathan-Turner announced the pre-sale to the US of 78 Peter Davison episodes (i.e. three seasons worth). It was while at this event that Nathan-Turner sounded out Nation for permission to do a Dalek story to close the 20th season. The KRMA documentary Once Upon a Time Lord was filmed. Season 19 shown in video room. Reports in DWM 76 and Fantasy Empire 6. Presumably the interview with JNT in Starlog 62 was conducted here. Preview in the Chicago Tribune. Brief mentions in the Daily Express, the Aberdeen Evening Press and the Liverpool Daily Post. AP photo of Ainley and fans appeared in several newspapers. Aug. 21-22, 1982 New Orleans Louisiana Terrance Dicks On the morning of 22 August, Dicks was woken by a telephone call from script editor Eric Saward to sound out his availability to write The Five Doctors Sept. 18-19, 1982 Denver Colorado Star Con-Denver VI John Nathan-Turner It was while at this convention, that Doctor Who Fan Club of America president, Ron Katz, established an \"agreement\" with John Nathan-Turner for the club to sell \"unofficial\" DWFCA merchandise.

(After being in the US for over a week, JNT flew back to the UK on 14 Feb.) Photos of Nathan-Turner with the costumed fans appear in the Radio Times 20th Anniversary Special. Photo of JNT in DWM 83. Feb. 19-20, 1983 Chicago Illinois New Fantasy Shop Peter Davison, Sandra Dickinson More of a signing than a convention; signing sessions ran from noon-2pm, then 4-6pm on the first day, and noon-2pm, 3-5pm on the second. A (delayed) story was run in the 6 May 1983 Daily Herald. Photos in DWM 83, and HERE, and HERE (from the 20th).

Pertwee gave JNT some candy called \"Mounds\", asking him to give these to his old friend Ingrid Pitt, who JNT would be seeing a few days later at rehearsals for Warriors of the Deep.

On 28 November, various UK news bulletins, such as BBC 1 News and Newsround reported on the event, one of which was used in the 29 November edition of Video Dispatch in New Zealand. Also on 29 November, Entertainment Tonight reported on the convention. On 3 December, Entertainment This Week ran the same story, but with an edit that omitted the majority of the clips from The Five Doctors. That same edition of ETW aired in New Zealand on 17 December 1983, and in Australia on 8 January 1984. The existing elements of Shada were shown for the first time. A full con report appeared in DWM \"Merchandise Special\" 1984. Pertwee recorded a voiceover for the con's TV commercial.

In her autobiography Second Generation, Tamm mentions being the sole DW guest at a general SF con held in New York, her first-ever visit to that city (although she recalls seeing people dressed in Star Trek The Next Generation costumes, that must be a mixed memory, as that series didn't start until 1987) Nov. 23-25, 1984 Chicago (Rosemont) Illinois Hyatt Regency O'Hare TARDIS 21 (Spirit of Light) Patrick Troughton, Jon Pertwee, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Anthony Ainley, Nicholas Courtney, Nicola Bryant, Janet Fielding, Elisabeth Sladen, Lalla Ward, Mark Strickson, Frazer Hines, John Nathan-Turner, Terrance Dicks, Ian Marter, John Levene, Richard Franklin, Mary Tamm TARDIS 21 stands for The Annual Reunion of Doctors In Season 21.

(It was reported in several fanzines in late 1985 - such as DWB 26 - that Colin Baker and JNT had been to a poorly-attended convention in Tampa; there were only three cons held in Tampa in 85, and the one-off Who Fest is the best fit - but see also Spokane in August 1986.)

Michael Keating? During October and November 1986, Jon Pertwee was to undertake a series of events around the east coast to celebrate his time as the Doctor. These were sponsored by the British American Television Society. He would be joined at various times by Patrick Troughton, Peter Davison, and Paul Darrow and Michael Keating (from Blake's 7) who were also in the US attending other events.\n\nPertwee was to make appearances in Trenton, New Jersey; Baltimore, Maryland; Boston, Massachusetts; Albany, New York, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Nashville, Tennessee; New Orleans, Louisiana; Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, and finally in Tampa, Florida.\n\nHowever, the actor fell ill during the tour and was unable to make it to some events. Troughton, Davison, Darrow and Keating did still attend without him.\n\nThe tour was not deemed to be a success, with low turn-out, not helped by Pertwee's absence from his own show!\n\nThese Pertwee Tour shows are marked ## in the table\n\nOct. 19, 1986 Baltimore Maryland Baltimore Convention Center A Day with Jon Pertwee (British American Television Society) (## Pertwee Tour) Jon Pertwee?; Patrick Troughton?\n\nIt's known that Patrick Troughton was a replacement for Pertwee (who fell sick) at an event in Baltimore; it is likely to be this show, as it's the only 1986 convention that was in Baltimore prior to Troughton's death the following year, unless there is a further Baltimore event we don't know about?\n\nOct. 25-26, 1986 Niagara Falls New York Best Western Red Jacket Hotel Fall-Con I 86 Janet Fielding, John Nathan-Turner, ad says \"Colin Baker or Patrick Troughton\" DW and general SF.
