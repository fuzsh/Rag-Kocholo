(We actually planned to rename the convention “Gallifrey One’s Nightmare on 34th Street” if any powers-that-be got shirty with us about the original name, but thankfully didn’t have to do it!)\n\nGallifrey One 33 1/3: Long Live the Revolution\n\nFebruary 17-19, 2023\n\nLos Angeles Airport Marriott Hotel, Los Angeles, CA\n\nAttendance: 3,104\n\nGuests: Jodie Whittaker, Chris Chibnall, Colin Baker, Bonnie Langford, Janet Fielding, Sophie Aldred, Katy Manning, Wendy Padbury, Frazer Hines, Jon Culshaw, Michael Troughton, Daniel Anthony, Craige Els, Jamie Magnus Stone, Arwel Wyn Jones, Daf Shurmer, Patrick O’Kane, Tim Treloar, Stephen Noonan, Daisy Ashford, Lauren Cornelius, Jeff Cummins, Richard Price, Simon Carew, Tim Dane Reid, Mickey Lewis, Chase Masterson, Gigi Edgley, Dan Slott, Gary Russell, Matthew Sweet, Joseph Lidster, Tony Lee, Paul Cornell, Peter Anghelides, Matt Fitton, Jody Houser, Simon Guerrier, Lisa McMullin, Lizbeth Myles, Kenny Smith, Rob Ritchie, Matthew Jacobs, Vanessa Yuille, David & Samantha Howe, Christopher Jones, Blair Shedd, Jason Haigh-Ellery, Laurette Spang, Sarah Rush, Eric Pierpoint, Casey Biggs, Steve Rankin, Ben Browder, Joe Flanigan, Alaina Huffman, David Gerrold, Marv Wolfman, Barbara Hambly, Julie & Shawna Benson, Cherry Cheva, Javi Grillo-Marxuach, Dan Peck, Gillian Horvath, Trina Ray, Kim Steadman, Sarah Milkovich, Anita Sengupta, Jessie Christiansen, Robert Napton, Craig Miller, Larry Nemecek, Emily Davis, Dominic Martin, Lizzie Worsdell.\n\nName references the revolution speed of a standard vinyl LP (33 1/3 revolutions per minute). “Long Live the Revolution” was the much-preferred choice over an earlier idea which was simply “For the Record.”\n\nGallifrey One: Thirty-Second to Midnight\n\nFebruary 18-20, 2022\n\nLos Angeles Airport Marriott Hotel, Los Angeles, CA\n\nAttendance: 2,153\n\nThis event was originally scheduled for February 12-14, 2021, but was postponed by one year due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Due to continuing concerns over transmission of the virus — the convention took place toward the end of the Omicron variant surge — approximately 800 additional ticketholders, as well as many invited guests and about a third of our regular staff, chose not to attend.\n\nGuests: Sylvester McCoy, Mandip Gill, Matt Strevens, Jo Martin, Sacha Dhawan, Frazer Hines, Jonathan Watson, Eric Roberts, Sophia Myles, Tommy Knight, Anjli Mohindra, Bhavnisha Parmar, Michael Jayston, Stephen Gallagher, India Fisher, Sadie Miller, Christopher Naylor, Lauren Cornelius, Clem So, Mickey Lewis, Jon Davey, Colin Spaull, Gigi Edgley, Dominic Keating, Andrew Robinson, Chase Masterson, Jody Houser, Lisa McMullin, Robert Mukes, Tony Lee, Gary Russell, Paul Cornell, Matthew Sweet, John Peel, Matt Fitton, Mark Corden, Rob Ritchie, Jason Haigh-Ellery, Martin Geraghty, Emily Cook, Heather Challands, David J.

Briant, Margot Hayhoe, Anjli Mohindra, Geoffrey Beevers, Tilly Steele, Mark Dexter, Anna-Louise Plowman, Tracie Simpson, Connor Trinneer, Nicole de Boer, Jeffrey Combs, Anthony Montgomery, Vaughn Armstrong, Robert O’Reilly, Suzie Plakson, Michael Collins, Mark Corden, James DeHaviland, Mark McQuoid, Gigi Edgley, Rhianne Starbuck, Matty Cardarople, Emma Reeves, Una McCormack, Chase Masterson, Jon Davey, Richard Ashton, Matt Rohman, Marcus Gilbert, Gary Russell, Jody Houser, Scott Gray, Paul Cornell, Tony Lee, Matt Fitton, Richard Dinnick, Russell Minton, Anne Lockhart, Christopher Jones, Jason Haigh-Ellery, David Gerrold, Marv Wolfman, Brannon Braga, Peter Anghelides, David J.

Woodward, Scott Tipton, Craig Miller, David Tipton, Bob Miller, Hayden Black, Trina Ray, Kim Steadman, Sarah Milkovich, Anita Sengupta, Jessie Christiansen, Phil Hopkins, Larry Nemecek, Arne Starr, Robert Napton, Keith Barnfather.\n\nName inspired by, yes, Baskin-Robbins ice cream (but we kept the British spelling of flavours in honor of our convention’s theme)… and it was one of the few convention names we knew we’d eventually want to use during the foundation of the convention in 1989-90, assuming we’d get that far. Christopher Jones designed the TARDIS ice cream cone.\n\nGallifrey One: 30 Years in the TARDIS\n\nFebruary 15-17, 2019\n\nLos Angeles Airport Marriott Hotel, Los Angeles, CA\n\nAttendance: 3,827\n\nGuests: Colin Baker, Catherine Tate, John Barrowman, William Russell, Carole Ann Ford, Nicola Bryant, Katy Manning, Frazer Hines, Richard Franklin, Walter Koenig, Michael Jayston, Tony Curran, Caitlin Blackwood, Jamie Childs, Rachel Talalay, Wayne Yip, Nicholas Briggs, Ben Wheatley, Bruce Boxleitner, Mira Furlan, Claudia Christian, Patricia Tallman, Gigi Edgley, Yasmin Bannerman, Lisa Greenwood, Sophie Hopkins, Blair Mowat, Tim Treloar, Sarah Dollard, Paul Cornell, Lisa McMullin, Mickey Lewis, Jon Davey, Rusty Goffe, Rachael Stott, Jody Houser, James Peaty, Rob Williams, Lance Parkin, Alex Paknadel, Jacob Dudman, Simon Guerrier, Tony Lee, Richard Dinnick, Nick Robatto, Mark Ayres, Steve Roberts, Paul Vanezis, Richard Molesworth, Stuart Manning, Chris Chapman, Rob Ritchie, Rosie Jane, Christopher Jones, Christel Dee, Chase Masterson, Anne Lockhart, Edward Russell, Jason Haigh-Ellery, Geoffrey Blake, David Gerrold, Marv Wolfman, Cherry Chevapravatdumrong, Javi Grillo-Marxuach, Barbara Hambly, Greg Weisman, Brittany Winner, Brianna Winner, Erin Maher, Kay Reindl, Marc Scott Zicree, Sam Watts, Gillian Horvath, Lars Pearson, Julie Benson, Shawna Benson, Dan Peck, Lilla Zuckerman, Nora Zuckerman, Kim Shumway, Rebecca Kirsch, Sam Stone, Karl Martin, Daniel Keys Moran, Darin Henry, JK Woodward, Scott Tipton, David Tipton, Craig Miller, David Wise, Bob Miller, Charlie Kirchoff, Hayden Black, Trina Ray, Anita Sengupta, Kim Steadman, Sarah Milkovich, Larry Nemecek, Arne Starr, Travis Richey, Robert Napton, Joseph Scrimshaw, Chris Thompson.\n\nName is an homage to Kevin Davies’ beloved Doctor Who documentary “Thirty Years in the TARDIS”. The Gallifrey landscape incorporated into the logo was created by Christopher Jones.\n\nThe 29 Voyages of Gallifrey One\n\nFebruary 16-18, 2018\n\nLos Angeles Airport Marriott Hotel, Los Angeles, CA\n\nAttendance: 3,954\n\nGuests: Steven Moffat, Sylvester McCoy, Matt Lucas, David Bradley, Jemma Redgrave, Murray Gold, Sophie Aldred, Camille Coduri, Brian Minchin, Wendy Padbury, Frazer Hines, Terry Molloy, Lisa Bowerman, Rona Munro, Martin Jarvis, Andrew Cartmel, Sarah Dollard, Jamie Mathieson, Peter Harness, Rachel Talalay, Lawrence Gough, Wayne Yip, Hayley Nebauer, Lindsey Alford, Jessica Martin, Stephen Wyatt, Philip Martin, Mike Tucker, Mark Ayres, Jenny Colgan, Chris Achilleos, Carrie Henn, Chase Masterson, Dee Sadler, Colin Spaull, Richard Ashton, Robert Shearman, Simon Fraser, George Mann, Cavan Scott, Jon Davey, John Dorney, Matt Fitton, Edward Russell, Gigi Edgley, Rekha Sharma, Todd Haberkorn, Michelle Specht, Peter Anghelides, Hayden Black, Graeme Burk, Cherry Chevapravatdumrong, Paul Cornell, Richard Dinnick, Scott Edgington, Jane Espenson, Dick Fiddy, David Gerrold, Javi Grillo-Marxuach, David J Howe, Jason Haigh-Ellery, Barbara Hambly, Gillian Horvath, Deric Hughes, Marv Wolfman, J.K.

We’d wanted to do a nautical/cruise ship theme for many years and it seemed the best time, since we couldn’t come up with anything else with 29 in the title. Christopher Jones designed the lovely TARDIS ship.\n\nGallifrey One: 28 Years Later\n\nFebruary 17-19, 2017\n\nLos Angeles Airport Marriott Hotel, Los Angeles, CA\n\nAttendance: 3,868\n\nGuests: Paul McGann, Lalla Ward, Louise Jameson, Katy Manning, Gareth David-Lloyd, Naoko Mori, Catrin Stewart, Anneke Wills, Frazer Hines, Philip Hinchcliffe, Peter Purves, Hattie Hayridge, Daphne Ashbrook, John Leeson, Deep Roy, June Hudson, Howard Burden, Roger Murray-Leach, Mat Irvine, Danny Webb, Prentis Hancock, Simon Fisher-Becker, Jimmy Vee, Michael Troughton, Amy Pemberton, Nicholas Briggs, Nicholas Pegg, Barnaby Edwards, Rachael Stott, Nick Abadzis, Dominic Glynn, Sam Watts, Seán Carlsen, Christine Adams, Ryan Carnes, Anna Shaffer, Chase Masterson, Paul Cornell, John Peel, Gary Russell, Tony Lee, Jason Haigh-Ellery, Chris Thompson, Richard Dinnick, Scott Handcock, David J.

Christopher Jones did such an amazing job on the logo for this convention (the first we asked him to do) that we kept it as the official logo for our organization, Gallifrey One Conventions.\n\nThe 24 Hours of Gallifrey One\n\nFebruary 15-17, 2013\n\nLos Angeles Airport Marriott Hotel, Los Angeles, CA\n\nAttendance: 3,578 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Freema Agyeman, Sylvester McCoy, Philip Hinchcliffe, Mark Strickson, Peter Purves, Deborah Watling, Frazer Hines, Ben Browder, Mark Sheppard, Saul Metzstein, Douglas MacKinnon, June Hudson, Anjli Mohindra, Dick Mills, Daphne Ashbrook, Frances Barber, Michael Jayston, Stephen Thorne, Shaun Dingwall, Neve McIntosh, Dan Starkey, Ian McNeice, Nicholas Briggs, John Noble, Nicholas Pegg, Andrew Smith, Nina Toussaint-White, Lisa Bowerman, Chase Masterson, Finn Jones, Gary Russell, Paul Marc Davis, Richard Hope, Jason Haigh-Ellery, Dan Hall, Ed Stradling, Jane Espenson, Ashley Eckstein, Sarah Douglas, Julian Holloway, Julie Caitlin Brown, Andrea Thompson, Tony Lee, Denton Tipton, Joshua Hale Fialkov, Charlie Kirchoff, Blair Shedd, Charlie Ross, Scott Handcock, Len Wein, Marv Wolfman, Brad Bell, Barbara Hambly, Nancy Holder, Peter Anghelides, Sam Stone, Javier Grillo-Marxuach, Natalie Morales, Gillian Horvath, David Wise, Craig Miller, Darin Henry, Trina Ray, Steve Roberts, Sarah Milkovich, Bridget Landry, Richard Dinnick, Kim Steadman, Scott Edgington, David J Howe, Richard Dinnick, Travis Richey, Paul Hanley, Graeme Burk, Stacey Smith?, Scott Alan Woodard, Paul J Salamoff, Arne Starr, Eric Hoffman.\n\nName inspired by… well… of course it was going to be 24 hours. We knew in 1990 that if we ever got to #24, this would be the name. The clock face in the logo is actually the Prague Astronomical Clock (Prague Orloj) in the Czech Republic! (The 24 in the logo is an homage to the TV series “24”.)\n\nGallifrey One’s Network 23\n\nFebruary 17-19, 2012\n\nLos Angeles Airport Marriott Hotel, Los Angeles, CA\n\nAttendance: 3,183\n\nGuests: Paul McGann, Camille Coduri, William Russell, Louise Jameson, Maureen O’Brien, Mark Sheppard, Caitlin Blackwood, Richard Franklin, Tony Curran, Daphne Ashbrook, Yee Jee Tso, Eric Roberts, W.

The con was originally subtitled “20,000 Years into the Future” as in this logo (a phrase also inspired by Max Headroom), but we eventually dropped the subtitle during convention planning as we couldn’t find a way to make it work.\n\nGallifrey One’s Catch 22: Islands of Mystery\n\nFebruary 18-20, 2011\n\nLos Angeles Airport Marriott Hotel, Los Angeles, CA\n\nAttendance: 2,186 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Peter Davison, Janet Fielding, Sarah Sutton, Matthew Waterhouse, John Leeson, Frazer Hines, John Levene, Tracie Simpson, Cush Jumbo, Paul Kasey, Neill Gorton, Rob Mayor, Ian McNeice, Gareth Roberts, Waris Hussein, Pamela Salem, Sarah Douglas, Chase Masterson, Alaina Huffman, Jane Espenson, Doris Egan, Phil Ford, Joss Agnew, James Moran, Daphne Ashbrook, Virginia Hey, Daniel Logan, Emilie Ullerup, Larry Niven, Rick Sternbach, Gareth Skelding, Gary Russell, Jason Haigh-Ellery, Clayton Hickman, Barbara Hambly, Tony Lee, Marv Wolfman, Len Wein, Blair Shedd, Gillian Horvath, Richard Starkings, David Gerrold, Denton Tipton, Javier Grillo-Marxuach, Jose Molina, Wendy Pini, Nancy Holder, James Kerwin, David J.

Blumberg, Kevin Grazier, Trina Ray, Sarah Milkovich, Bill Ernoehazy, Paul Salamoff, Audry Taylor, Aimee Major Steinberger, Arne Starr, Craig Miller, Daryl Frazetti, Eric Hoffman, and Chris Hardwick.\n\nName inspired by the common phrase “catch 22”. The subtitle Islands of Mystery was something Shaun Lyon came up with, along with the name, and he doesn’t remember where is came from… but it made for a lovely stylized map program book cover, and added a nice change of pace in the promotional side of things. (Incidentally, we still think this is the best Gallifrey One convention logo there ever was or ever will be.)\n\nGallifrey One: Blackjack 21\n\nFebruary 26-28, 2010\n\nLos Angeles Airport Marriott Hotel, Los Angeles, CA\n\nAttendance: 1,595 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Katy Manning, Tommy Knight, Georgia Moffett, Graeme Harper, Louise Page, Deborah Watling, Anneke Wills, Frazer Hines, John Levene, Bob Baker, Andrew Hayden-Smith, Nicholas Briggs, Phil Ford, John Fay, Colin Teague, Alice Troughton, Daphne Ashbrook, Yee Jee Tso, Rob Shearman, Paul Cornell, Gary Russell, Jason Haigh-Ellery, John Pickard, Tony Lee, Pia Guerra, Matthew Dow Smith, Paul Tams, Stephanie Beacham, Amber Benson, Marv Wolfman, Javier Grillo-Marxuach, Mark Waid, Wendy Pini, Nancy Holder, David Wise, Scott Handcock, Steve Roberts, Kate Orman, Jonathan Blum, David J.

Salamoff, Richard Dinnick, Aimee Major Steinberger, Audry Taylor, Richard Starkings, Joshua Hale Fialkov, Dr. Robert Gounley, Tanuki Suit Riot, Dr. Jim Busby, Eric Hoffman, Doctor Who: Podshock.\n\nName inspired by gambling, logo inspired by gambling… lots and lots of gambling. Named in honor of our late colleague Michael Mason, who enjoyed running the blackjack table at our convention casino night parties.\n\nGallifrey One: 20 To Life\n\nFebruary 13-15, 2009\n\nLos Angeles Airport Marriott Hotel, Los Angeles, CA\n\nAttendance: 1,347 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Colin Baker, Nicola Bryant, Phil Collinson, Wendy Padbury, Frazer Hines, Gareth David-Lloyd, Kai Owen, Naoko Mori, Daphne Ashbrook, Phil Ford, Keith Temple, Paul Cornell, James Moran, Toby Hadoke, Rob Shearman, Gary Russell, Laura Doddington, Ciara Janson, Jason Haigh-Ellery, Tony Lee, Wendy Pini, John Levene, Tracy Scoggins, Claudia Christian, Amber Benson, Marv Wolfman, Damian Samuels, Callum Blue, David Gerrold, Marc Scott Zicree, Dorothy Fontana, David J Howe, Simon Guerrier, Peter Anghelides, Steve Roberts, Scott Alan Woodard, Caroline Symcox, Mark Wright, Nev Fountain, Arne Starr, Aimee Major Steinberger, Joshua Fialkov, David Wise, Trina Ray, Cindy Pickett, Gregg Berger, Jeff Rector, Darin Henry, Arnold T Blumberg, Bill Ernoehazy, Steve Bartlett, Bob Gounley, Eric Hoffman, Doctor Who: Podshock.\n\nName inspired by… well… the criminal justice system (don’t ask) and suggested by Kris Bauer.\n\nGallifrey One’s Nineteenth Symphony: Opus 2008\n\nFebruary 15-17, 2008\n\nLos Angeles Airport Marriott Hotel, Los Angeles, CA\n\nAttendance: 1,080 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Sylvester McCoy, Sophie Aldred, Steven Moffat, Daphne Ashbrook, Andrew Cartmel, Lisa Bowerman, Moya Brady, Sean Gallagher, Derek Riddell, Joel Hodgson, Josh Weinstein, Paul Cornell, Rob Shearman, James Moran, Gary Russell, Jason Haigh-Ellery, Mark Ayres, Steve Roberts, Simon Guerrier, Andy Lane, Bob May, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Richard Chavez, Jennifer Rhodes, Luca Bercovicci, Andrew Sewell, Mojo, Caroline Symcox, Scott Alan Woodard, Arnold T Blumberg, David J Howe, Keith Topping, Lars Pearson, Christa Dickson, Robert Gounley, Khaled S Ali, Trina Ray, Arne Starr, Thomas Powers, Jill Sherwin, Steve Bartlett, Hidden Frontier, Eric Hoffman.\n\nName inspired by Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, which would have been used ten years prior for #9… but since it was still out there, and nineteen isn’t really easy to use in a title, it stuck. (Matthew Mitchell wanted to call it Nineteenth Nervous Breakdown, but we really didn’t want to jinx our chances.)\n\nThe Eighteenth Amendment of Gallifrey One\n\nFebruary 16-18, 2007\n\nLos Angeles Airport Marriott Hotel, Los Angeles, CA\n\nAttendance: 808 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Colin Baker, Caroline John, Steven Moffat, Terry Molloy, Eric Roberts, Geoffrey Beevers, Maggie Stables, John Levene, Ben Aaronovitch, Mike Tucker, Tom MacRae, Gary Russell, Jason Haigh-Ellery, Paul Cornell, Bill Mumy, Angela Cartwright, Richard Herd, Richard Chaves, France Nuyen, Peter Anghelides, Steve Roberts, Keith Topping, Simon Guerrier, Caroline Symcox, David J Howe, Darin Henry, Scott Alan Woodard, Arnold T Blumberg, Lynn Borden, Hank Garrett, Carol Lynley, Lana Wood, Ursula Burton, Carolyn Edwards, Bill Baggs, Jill Sherwin, Lars Pearson, Christa Dickson, Eric Hoffman, The OFFSTAGE Theatre Group.\n\nName inspired by Prohibition, logo inspired by the Repeal of Prohibition. And our guests. Lots and lots of guests who like sitting in the bar… Various attempts to do something with 18 led to phrases having to do with being legal, etc., but we couldn’t work the number into the title, hence us backing into the prohibition angle.\n\nGallifrey One in the Seventeenth (and a half) Century\n\nFebruary 17-19, 2006\n\nLos Angeles Airport Marriott Hotel, Los Angeles, CA\n\nAttendance: 748 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Louise Jameson, Noel Clarke, Mary Tamm, Philip Olivier, Pamela Salem, David Warwick, John Schwab, Alan Ruscoe, Nicholas Briggs, Steven Moffat, Mark Gatiss, Rob Shearman, Paul Cornell, Keith Boak, Gary Russell, Jason Haigh-Ellery, Billy West, Vaughn Armstrong, Tracy Scoggins, Natalija Nogulich, Michael Muhney, Deanna Lund, Don Matheson, Don Marshall, Leonard Stone, William Gregory Lee, David Gerrold, Bob May, Steve Roberts, Caroline Symcox, James Swallow, David Bishop, Nev Fountain, Keith Topping, Scott Alan Woodard, Darin Henry, Ian Hallard, Jon de Burgh Miller, David J. Howe, Arne Starr, Anna Wilding, Ursula Burton, Arnold T Blumberg, Roxy Darr, Bill Blair, Jill Sherwin, Bill Baggs, Eric Hoffman.\n\nName inspired by Duck Dodgers and was pretty much decided by committee. Logo inspired by the revived Doctor Who series; we liked the concept a lot more than its eventual execution.\n\nThe Sixteen Swashbucklers of Gallifrey One\n\nFebruary 18-20, 2005\n\nAirtel Plaza Hotel, Van Nuys, CA\n\nAttendance: 737 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Elisabeth Sladen, Katy Manning, Nicholas Courtney, Richard Franklin, Terrance Dicks, Barry Letts, Robert Shearman, Paul Cornell, Jason Haigh-Ellery, Gary Russell, Lisa Bowerman, Amber Benson, Toby Longworth, Simon A. Forward, Craig Hinton, Martin Day, Keith Topping, Scott Alan Woodard, Caroline Symcox, Darin Henry, Nev Fountain, Marv Wolfman, Len Wein, David Gerrold, David J. Howe, Arnold T. Blumberg, Nigel Fairs, John Binns, John Ainsworth, Bill Baggs, Virginia Hey, Tessa Shaw, Ursula Burton, Bob May, Erin Gray, Mark Donovan, Peter Ware, Arne Starr, Bill Blair, Lars Pearson, Christa Dickson, Celeste Yarnall, Jack Donner, Leonard Stone, Jill Sherwin, Stephen Austin, Paul Lawrence, Eric Hoffman.\n\nName largely inspired by the fact that none of us could come up with a good name (as nobody wanted the angst surrounding The Sixteen Candles of Gallifrey One) but we had talked for years about doing a pirate-themed convention. We think Suze Campagna suggested the final name but we’re not sure. But we definitely had the pirates!\n\nGallifrey One’s Fifteen Minutes of Fame\n\nFebruary 13-16, 2004\n\nAirtel Plaza Hotel, Van Nuys, CA\n\nAttendance: 742 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Paul McGann, Sylvester McCoy, Janet Fielding, Paul Darrow, Yee Jee Tso, India Fisher, Jason Haigh-Ellery, Gary Russell, Susannah Harker, Philip Segal, Danny Strong, Robia LaMorte, John Ainsworth, Helen Baggs, Lee Binding, David Bishop, Bill Blair, Jonathan Blum, Arnold T. Blumberg, Julie Caitlin Brown, Paul Cornell, Jon de Burgh Miller, Christa Dickson, Paul Ebbs, Samantha Eggar, Nigel Fairs, Michael Forest, David Gerrold, Dorothy C. Fontana, Virginia Hey, Clayton Hickman, David Howe, Steve Johnson, Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier, Bob May, Mojo, Iona Morris, Kate Orman, Len Wein, Stuart Pankin, Lars Pearson, Tessa Shaw, Robert Sheckley, Jill Sherwin, Brinke Stevens, James Swallow, Caroline Symcox, Andrea Thompson, Keith Topping, Camden Toy, Robert Trebor, Eric Hoffman.\n\nName inspired by the legendary Andy Warhol and suggested by many parties. The logo was designed to be fun and very much a 70s throwback, and yes, the font we used is indeed the font used on The Price is Right.\n\nGallifrey One: Episode XIV – The Faction Paradox\n\nFebruary 14-17, 2003\n\nAirtel Plaza Hotel, Van Nuys, CA\n\nAttendance: 760 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Peter Davison, Colin Baker, India Fisher, Caroline Morris, Andrea Thompson, Virginia Hey, Linda Harrison, David Franklin, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Marv Wolfman, Len Wein, Brinke Stevens, Julia Nickson, Jeff Conaway, Neil Dickson, James C. Leary, Bob May, Julie Caitlin Brown, Mark Rolston, Gary Russell, Jason Haigh-Ellery, David J. Howe, Stephen James Walker, Mark Donovan, Clayton Hickman, Robert Trebor, Maggie Egan, Lisa Wilcox, Andras Jones, Celeste Yarnall, Kathy Garver, Herb Jefferson Jr., David Gerrold, Bill Blair, Lance Parkin, Kate Orman, Jonathan Blum, Peter Anghelides, Nev Fountain, Paul Cornell, Caroline Symcox, Lloyd Rose, David McIntee, Dale Smith, Keith Topping, Paul Ebbs, Mark Wright, Jon de Burgh Miller, Daniel Harcourt, Bill Baggs, Laura Palmer, Karen Parks, Lars Pearson, Arnold T Blumberg, Keith Hartman, Jill Sherwin, Eric Hoffman.\n\nName inspired by Faction Paradox from the BBC Doctor Who novels and spinoff audios; logo inspired by the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The name was suggested in a fit of pique by Shaun Lyon, who now disowns it as the worst Gallifrey One convention name of all time. There is no truth to the rumor that “The Fourteenth Peanut” suggested by Diana Dougherty and Suze Campagna was ever given any serious consideration, though in retrospect, maybe that wouldn’t have been such a bad idea… Fourteen is a really irritating number.\n\nThe Thirteenth Floor of Gallifrey One\n\nFebruary 15-18, 2002\n\nAirtel Plaza Hotel, Van Nuys, CA\n\nAttendance: 696 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Carole Ann Ford, Frazer Hines, Anneke Wills, Maggie Stables, Mira Furlan, Judson Scott, Gordon Michael Woolvett, Keith Hamilton Cobb, Virginia Hey, Mark McDonnell, Dan Freedman, Jason Haigh-Ellery, Celeste Yarnall, Bob May, Julie Caitlin Brown, Marjorie Monaghan, Richard Lynch, Nicholas Briggs, Philip Segal, Robert Trebor, Mojo, Betsy Baker, Sarah York, Iona Morris, Andras Jones, Bill Baggs, Keith Barnfather, Jonathan Blum, Keith Topping, Paul Cornell, Paul Ebbs, David J. Howe, Rob Shearman, Caroline Symcox, Dave Stone, Beata Pozniak, Carrie Dobro, Stephen Austin, Bill Blair, Lisa Getto, Joe Reinkemeier, Robert Engels, Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz, Ethlie Ann Vare, Carleton Eastlake, Dave Owen, Emily Skopov, Jim Swallow, Marc Scott Zicree, Elaine Zicree, Keith Hartman, Nigel Fairs, Paul J. Salamoff, Nev Fountain, Paul Condon, Arnold T. Blumberg, Jeff Cioletti, Steve Johnson, Jill Sherwin, Martin Trickey, Rob Francis, Phideaux Xavier, Laura Palmer, Eric Hoffman.\n\nName inspired by the SF/horror film “The Thirteenth Floor” and the paranoia around the number 13. We think this was suggested by either Alan Hale or Matt Mitchell.\n\nThe Twelfth Regeneration of Gallifrey One\n\nFebruary 23-25, 2001\n\nAirtel Plaza Hotel, Van Nuys, CA\n\nAttendance: 778 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Bonnie Langford, Mark Strickson, Sarah Sutton, India Fisher, Lisa Bowerman, Justin Richards, Jason Haigh-Ellery, Alistair Lock, David J. Howe, Philip Segal, Keith Barnfather, Bill Baggs, Jo Castleton, Nigel Fairs, Peter Anghelides, Arnold T. Blumberg, Simon Bucher-Jones, Stephen Cole, Paul Cornell, Sue Cowley, Gary Gillatt, Craig Hinton, Chris Howarth, Steve Lyons, Jon De Burgh Miller, Dave Owen, Lance Parkin, Lars Pearson, Steve Roberts, Philip Segal, Dave Stone, Keith Topping, Nick Walters, Mojo, Mira Furlan, Brad Dourif, Peter Woodward, Robert Trebor, Jeffrey Willerth, David Allen Brooks, Tim Choate, Denise Gentile, Marjean Holden, Daniel Dae Kim, Herb Jefferson Jr., Richard Hatch, Marjorie Monaghan, Iona Morris, Maggie Egan, Bob May, Beata Pozniak, Larry Niven, Frank Kelly Freas, Mark Altman, Stephen Austin, Bill Blair, Jeff Cioletti, Steve Kriozere, Matt Kiene, Robert Burnett, Joe Reinkemeyer, Steve Melching, Kay Reindl, Mark Allen Shepherd, Jill Sherwin, Zack Stentz, Ashley Miller, Ethlie Ann Vare, Dan Vebber, Harry Werksman, Gabrielle Stanton, John Bro Wilkie, Eric Hoffman.\n\nName inspired by what used to be the Doctor’s final renewal, suggested by Christian McGuire… An earlier idea for a convention name was The Twelve Days of Gallifrey One, but we didn’t want anyone to hold us to the advertising.\n\nThe Eleventh Hour of Gallifrey One\n\nFebruary 18-20, 2000\n\nAirtel Plaza Hotel, Van Nuys, CA\n\nAttendance: 745 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Peter Davison, Terrance Dicks, Justin Richards, Gary Russell, Jason Haigh-Ellery, Stephen Cole, Paul Cornell, Dave Stone, Kate Orman, Jonathan Blum, Mike Tucker, Keith Topping, Jonathan Miller, Bill Baggs, Gary Gillatt, Jo Castleton, George Telfer, Simon Gerard, Peter Woodward, Carrie Dobro, Erin Gray, J. Michael Straczynski, Robert Trebor, Julie Caitlin Brown, Gary Graham, Michelle Scarabelli, Terri Treas, David Allen Brooks, Michael Forrest, Tiny Ron, Mark Alan Shepard, Bob May, Scott MacDonald, Robert Hewitt Wolfe, Marc Scott Zicree, Michael Reaves, Elaine Zicree, Noel Wright, Mojo, Glenn Campbell, Kristian Sorensen, Lisa Getto, John Bro Wilkie, Mark Altman & Robert Burnett, Geoffrey Mandel, Fiona Avery, Christy Hardin Smith, John deChancie, Frank Kelly Freas, Jill Sherwin, Amberwolf, Eric Hoffman.\n\nLogo inspired by a clock; name inspired by the Doctor Who story “The Eleventh Hour” which actually aired many years after the convention, but that’s our story and we’re sticking to it (wibbly wobbly timey wimey). Name suggested by Robbie Bourget.\n\nThe Tenth Planet of Gallifrey One\n\nFebruary 12-15, 1999\n\nAirtel Plaza Hotel, Van Nuys, CA\n\nAttendance: 730 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Nicholas Courtney, Wendy Padbury, Daphne Ashbrook, Lisa Bowerman, J. Michael Straczynski, Andrew Cartmel, Stephen Cole, Wayne Alexander, Joshua Cox, Maggie Egan, Robin Atkin-Downes, Tucker Smallwood, Gerard Christopher, Casey Biggs, Philip Segal, Richard Hatch Anne Lockhart, Herb Jefferson Jr., Kent McCord, Jack Stauffer, Gary Russell, David McIntee, Mike Tucker, Paul Cornell, Keith Topping, Gary Gillatt, Bjo Trimble, Mojo, Franklin Ruehl, Warren James, John Ainsworth, Bill Baggs, Tim Saward, Amberwolf, Charles Jackson II, Robert Gounley, Glenn Campbell, Eric Hoffman.\n\nName inspired by the Doctor Who story and suggested by Shaun Lyon; logo inspired by “Space: 1999”. In order to pay homage to the 70s TV show, this is the only time the word Gallifrey appears in a convention logo without One immediately following it (on the top line); however, the official convention name didn’t include that part. Our original plan was to call this event The Ten Commandments of Gallifrey One, but we later thought that might get us into trouble.\n\nThe Nine Lives of Gallifrey One\n\nFebruary 13-15, 1998\n\nAirtel Plaza Hotel, Van Nuys, CA\n\nAttendance: 690 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Colin Baker, Deborah Watling, Matthew Waterhouse, J. Michael Straczynski, Stephen Cole, Jeff Conaway, Julie Caitlin Brown, Erin Gray, Richard Hatch, Anne Lockhart, Herb Jefferson Jr., Jack Stauffer, Stephen R. Donaldson, David J. Howe, Gary Russell, Andy Lane, David McIntee, Paul Cornell, Martin Day, Keith Topping, Gary Gillatt, Paul Simpson, David Gerrold, Dorothy C. Fontana, George Johnsen, David Owen, Phil Brown, Mark Allan Shephard, Steve Stockbarger, Amberwolf, Adam Mojo Lebowitz, Eric Hoffman.\n\nName inspired by Colin Baker’s cat pin (seriously!) and suggested by Christian McGuire. We originally planned to call it Gallifrey One’s Ninth Symphony but this alternative somehow won out…\n\nGallifrey One Across the Eighth Dimension\n\nFebruary 14-16, 1997\n\nAirtel Plaza Hotel, Van Nuys, CA\n\nAttendance: 455 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Philip Segal, Michael Craze, Anneke Wills, Yee Jee Tso, Joe Straczynski, Ed Wasser, Julie Caitlin Brown, Spice Williams, Charlie Dierkop, Richard Herd, John Levene, Gary Russell, David McIntee, Robert Hewitt Wolfe, Mojo, Mark Altman, Jean-Marc & Randy Lofficier, Amberwolf, Eric Hoffman.\n\nName and logo inspired by “The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai,” suggested by Alan Hale and Tony Benoun when it became obvious this convention wasn’t going away any time soon.\n\nThe Seventh Seal of Gallifrey One\n\nFebruary 16-19, 1996\n\nAirtel Plaza Hotel, Van Nuys, CA\n\nAttendance: 474 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Sylvester McCoy, Sophie Aldred, John Levene, Philip Segal, Patricia Tallman, Aron Eisenberg, Terry Walsh, Spice Williams, Richard Herd, Jonathan Haze, Mojo, Henry Vanderbilt, Steve Stockbarger, Amberwolf, Jean-Marc & Randy Lofficier, Eric Hoffman.\n\nName inspired by “The Seventh Seal”, we don’t remember who suggested it during our original con discussions.\n\nThe Six Wives of Gallifrey One\n\nFebruary 24-26, 1995\n\nRadisson Plaza Hotel, Irvine, CA\n\nAttendance: 420 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Peter Davison, Philip Segal, John Levene, Nigel Bennett, Brinke Stevens, Harry Harrison, Larry Niven, Harry Turtle-dove, Julie Ann Sczesny, Gary Anderson, Jean-Marc & Randy Lofficier, Steve Stockbarger, Eric Hoffman.\n\nName inspired by Henry VIII, suggested by Christian McGuire during our original con discussions.\n\nA Fifth of Gallifrey One\n\nFebruary 18-21, 1994\n\nRed Lion Hotel, Glendale, CA\n\nAttendance: 302 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Colin Baker, Terrance Dicks, Barry Letts, John Levene, Jean-Marc & Randy Lofficier, Forrest J. Ackerman, J. Michael Straczynski, Jonathan Glassner, Larry Stewart, Mojo, John McElroy, Chris Chulack, Mike Moore, Steve Stockbarger, Eric Hoffman.\n\nName inspired by the alcohol measurement, suggested by Tony Benoun. The original convention name during our initial con planning was Gallifrey One Takes the Fifth.\n\nGallifrey One Goes Fourth\n\nFebruary 26-28, 1993\n\nBurbank Airport Hilton Hotel, Burbank, CA\n\nAttendance: Approximately 350 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Nicola Bryant, Frazer Hines, John Levene, David Gerrold, J.M. Dillard, Jean-Marc Lofficier, Julie Ann Sczesny, Brinke Stevens, Larry Stewart, J. Michael Straczynski, Arthur Holcomb, Daryl Mallett, Eric Hoffman.\n\nName inspired by the number 4 (so says the Count!); the name was part of our original discussions. Early information suggested it was to be called “Goes Forth” but we added the U for the nitpickers.\n\nGallifrey One in 3-D\n\nFebruary 21-23, 1992\n\nLos Angeles Airport Hilton & Towers, Los Angeles, CA\n\nAttendance: Approximately 380 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Nicholas Courtney, Sophie Aldred, John Levene, Larry Stewart, David Gerrold, Larry Niven, Barbara Hambly, Mel Gilden, Gar & Judy Reeves-Stevens, Jonathan Post, John Vornholt, Eric Hoffman.\n\nName inspired by many 3-D films; the name was part of our original discussions.\n\nGallifrey One: The Sequel\n\nMay 3-5, 1991\n\nPasadena Hilton Hotel, Pasadena, CA\n\nAttendance: Approximately 450 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Sylvester McCoy, Deborah Watling, Richard Franklin, John Levene, Larry Niven, Barbara Hambly, Larry Stewart, Eric Hoffman, John Vornholt, Jonathan Post, Gar & Judy Reeves-Stevens.\n\nName inspired by Airplane II: The Sequel and other sequel films; the name was part of our original discussions.\n\nGallifrey One\n\nMay 25-28, 1990\n\nLos Angeles Airport Hilton & Towers, Los Angeles, CA\n\nAttendance: 660 • Photo Gallery\n\nGuests: Jon Pertwee, John Nathan-Turner, John Levene, Ronald D. Moore, John Vornholt, Larry Stewart, Eric Hoffman, Hilary J. Bader, Don Marshall, Gary Conway, Peter Greenwood, Steven Stockbarger, Jonathan Post, Jean-Marc Lofficier.\n\nGallifrey One was named after an earlier, aborted convention attempt in Ottawa, Canada in the 1980s by our co-founder Robbie Bourget. The logo inspired by multiple SF genres popular at the time, and was hand-drawn by Shaun Lyon (including the lettering). Many years later, Bob Mitsch gave us a cleaned up, electronic version of the original drawing, for which we are very grateful.\n\nAll of our convention logos were designed by Shaun Lyon, except #25. Art design for #28-31, and the full logo design for #25, was by Christopher Jones."
