        "text": "Ellie Darcey-Alden (b. 4 September 1999)[1] is an English teen film, stage and television actress who is best known for playing young Lily Evans in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. She is also known for playing Francesca \"Franny\" Latimer in the Doctor Who series 7 Christmas special, \"The Snowmen.\" Before joining such large franchises as Harry Potter and Doctor Who, she appeared in minimal parts in British theatre and television. She has also done small time modelling, commercials, voice over work and competitive dancing.[1]\n\nCareer[]\n\n2007–2009: Early work[]\n\nDarcey-Alden first broke into the world of acting around 2007, appearing in small bits on the British stage and television, including her stage debut in Aladdin, directed by Peter Duncan for the Oxford Playhouse and followed by an uncredited cameo role in the 2008 mini-series Tess of the D'Urbervilles.[1][2][3]\n\nShe began training in specialised dancing much earlier in 2005, with the Dance 10 Theatre School within Edward Feild Primary School in Kidlington.[4]\n\nIn 2009, she appeared in her first guest-starring role as Mary in one episode of Robin Hood and in select episodes as Emma Walker in Holby City—for the BBC, respectively. She auditioned for the latter part earlier in June that year, accompanied by her mother, and was cast at the age of 9. Commenting on the experience, Darcey-Alden said:[4]\n\nThat year, she appeared in further stage credits, including Adrian Noble's musical production of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang for the New Theatre Oxford which was a revamped production of the original 2002 London production[5] and the Mardi Gras Challenge, a UK dance competition at the Sadler's Wells Theatre.[6][1]\n\nShe later commented at a 2013 LeakyCon panel in London on which form of media she preferred more—theatre, TV or film:[7][8]\n\n2009–2011: Harry Potter[]\n\nOf course, Darcey-Alden's most notable role came in December 2009, when she attended an open audition for the latest Harry Potter installment (a year before she was actually needed due to the producers' decision to split the book into two parts). In January 2010, she was called back for a second audition (known as a recall). She subsequently received a screen test with then 13-year-old Benedict Clarke (who would be cast as young Severus Snape) at Leavesden Studios and just a few weeks later, she was contacted by the producers and was told that she received the part of young Lily Evans, cast at age 10, in the commercially successful Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.[9][10][11]\n\nIn the film, Darcey-Alden appears in a flashback sequence as Harry's mother in her schooldays and reveals how she befriended Snape as child, which is crucial in explaining the back story of the shady professor and his complex relationship to Harry's deceased parents, particularly his bitter resentment to his father James.[12][13]\n\nIt was revealed in a 2011 article for the Oxford Mail that years before landing the part Darcey-Alden was tipped for future success by her agents at Enfield, London-based casting and theatrical agency A&J Management, although her parents decided to not treat her passion for acting seriously until she was more mature. Despite this, she resisted her mother for a chance in the business, especially for a part in Harry Potter, a role which her mother initially did not believe she would eventually win. In the same article, it was further reported that she was not allowed to tell her close friends of her part in Potter as she left school for Leavesden Studios and Hatfield House to film her scenes in 2010, where she met then 21-year-old actor Daniel Radcliffe on her first day on set. She was quoted:[3][14]\n\nAt a 2013 LeakyCon panel in Portland, Oregon, Darcey-Alden further elaborated on her meeting with Potter co-star Daniel Radcliffe. She said:[15]\n\nShe also mentioned in the same panel session that she met Dame Maggie Smith and was quoted, jokingly:[14]\n\nShe later said in detail:[16]\n\nFilming her scenes along with Benedict Clarke (young Snape), Ariella Paradise (young Petunia Dursley), Alfie McIlwain (young James Potter I) and Rohan Gotobed (young Sirius Black) took place in April 2010.[17]\n\nAccording to Darcey-Alden and Clarke at a 2013 LeakyCon cast junket in London, production alternated between sets at Leavesden Studios and on location shooting by the River Lea in the gardens of Hatfield Park near Hatfield House—both set in Hertfordshire, respectively. Of the river scene in particular, Clarke elaborated by saying:[18]\n\nDarcey-Alden added:\n\nShooting only lasted four days where one scene was shot per day.[19]\n\nTo satisfy the look of her character as described in the books, Darcey-Alden is naturally red haired although she was required to wear blue contact lenses to match Daniel Radcliffe's eyes given her eyes are brown.[1][20] In the novels, Harry is described as having his mother's eyes, which are in fact green although Radcliffe never sported any colour-correcting contacts in the films due to a negative reaction to them; J.K. Rowling later commented on this by saying it was not an absolute need that Harry have green eyes in the films, as long as there was a resemblance between his and his mother's.[21] However, the method of using blue contacts ultimately backfired and Darcey-Alden's natural eye colour showed through when captured on camera. For an unknown reason, this error was not digitally corrected in post-production.[20][22]\n\nWhen later asked by a fan of what it was like to be apart of a popular movie franchise, Darcey-Alden commented:[23]\n\n2012–present: Upcoming projects[]\n\nDarcey-Alden has been cast in a variety of independent and larger budget films. It was announced on 20 July 2011 via the official A&J Management Twitter that she had been cast in a cameo role in Welcome to the Punch, a British thriller co-starring James McAvoy, Mark Strong and Harry Potter alum Peter Mullan.[24] She appeared briefly in the aeroplane scene seated in the opposite aisle from Elyes Gabel.[25] Other roles include Pranks, a children's ghost story about a 12-year-old orphan named Katie confronted by the spirit of her foster mother's dead son, which also co-starred her real life brother Joseph Darcey-Alden[26] and was shot in four days in St Albans;[27] and Sam & Isobel, a coming of age tale of the titular characters—two young children brought together within the confines of a woodland through childlike innocence and naivety. Although, Sam eventually realises that Isobel is not as innocuous as she seems. For the latter, filming began on 9 April 2012 and wrapped production the following week on the 15th.[28][29] The official teaser trailer was released online on 2 April 2013 by director Brendan Lyle Moles. According to the video description, the film was making its circuit at film festivals that year and will be released to the public afterwards.[30] In early 2014, the film was officially released publicly online via Vimeo and YouTube by the production crew.[31][32]\n\nShe has also landed other big TV breaks. In 2012, she returned to the BBC for the Doctor Who series 7 Christmas special, \"The Snowmen\" as Francesca Latimer reuniting with real life brother Joseph Darcey-Alden as her on-screen sibling and co-starring alongside Jenna-Louise Coleman and Matt Smith.[33][34] In the episode, set in London in 1892, Francesca \"Franny\" Latimer and her brother Digby are wards being cared for by their governess Clara Oswin Oswald under the alias \"Miss Montague\". The children share a much closer relationship with Clara than they do their own father and Franny decides to relate a troubling experience to her: she has been having frequent nightmares of her late governess who has been tormenting her in her dreams of a promised return on Christmas Eve; it is revealed that years earlier, the governess drowned in the Latimers' pond, now frozen. Through a series of events, Franny's nightmare manifests under the Great Intelligence's influence, the Ice Governess is destroyed with the help of the Doctor, and Clara tragically succumbs to internal injuries, mourned by the Latimers.[35]\n\nAt a Chicago TARDIS 2014 panel, Darcey-Alden revealed that it was her brother who secured her the role. She said:[36]\n\nJoseph elaborated by saying:[36]\n\nEllie continued:[36]\n\nThe read-through took place on 2 August 2012 and was filmed later in the month in BBC Wales' Roath Lock studios and Newport.[34][37] To date, Darcey-Alden is the latest in a line of Harry Potter cast members to have appeared in both Potter and Doctor Who, including David Tennant, Michael Gambon, Helen McCrory, John Cleese, Zoe Wanamaker, Jim Broadbent, Toby Jones, Roger Lloyd Pack, Bill Nighy, Shirley Henderson, Adrian Rawlins, David Bradley, and John Hurt.[38]\n\nThe same year, it was confirmed that she would guest star in the second season of Tom Fontana's French-German-Czech historical television drama Borgia (not to be confused with Showtime's The Borgias) as Felice della Rovere, on-screen and illegitimate daughter to Dejan Čukić's Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere (better known as Pope Julius II).[39][40] Series two was shot on location in Prague and Italy in March through November 2012.[41] Darcey-Alden filmed her scenes in Italy that October over the span of three days, sharing the screen alongside Matt Di'angelo and Mark Ryder.[42][43] The show premiered on Canal+ on 18 March 2013[44] and Netflix on 1 May 2013.[45]\n\nAlthough Felice is considered a powerful and influential historical figure, Darcey-Alden's part in the show is reduced to a minimal appearance in the shadow of her powerful father; based on documentation, Felice was married as early as 14 years of age and was widowed shortly after, years before she remarried Gian Giordano Orsini and subsequently became a prominent figure of the Italian Renaissance.[46]\n\nWhile Darcey-Alden filmed minimal scenes for episodes 11 and 12, they were eventually cut from the final version, yet her name still appears in the credits of the Season 2 DVD (Region 2).[47][48] The show has been renewed for a third season, which is currently in pre-production; it has been confirmed that this will be the final of the series,[49] although it is currently unknown whether Darcey-Alden's character will return to the show.\n\nHer latest stage credits include Ellen Kent's Aida Verdi for the New Theatre Oxford[1][50] and The Nutcracker Twisted which was presented by Elite Dance Studio and performed at the Norris Theatre on 30 November 2013.[51][52][53]\n\nOn 17–18 January, she competed in the 47th Annual Miss Dance Drill Team USA: California dance competition and pageant.[54] On 7–9 March, she participated in the KAR: Kids Artistic Revue Redondo Beach, CA 2014 Competition, a national dance competition, which took place at the Centinela Valley Center For The Arts in Lawndale, California.[55][56]\n\nOn 23–26 May, she appeared in the Showstopper! Competition 2014, a major dance competition, which took place at the Disneyland Hotel in California.[57][58] She competed in a ballet solo, ballet group, jazz group and contemporary group.[59] She and her group were later awarded two Platinum 1st Place prizes with scores of 114.2 and 114.0, respectively for their performances \"Stranded\" and \"Hold It Against Me\" presented by the Elite Dance Studio.[60]\n\nOn 6–8 February, she appeared in the KAR: Kids Artistic Revue Long Beach Beach, CA 2015 Competition, which took place at Millikan High School.[61][62][63]\n\nOther work[]\n\nOutside of screen and stage credits, she modelled small time, including an ad for the Morleys Stores Ltd c. 2009-10[64] and the British children and pre-teen magazine Girl Talk in 2012.[65]\n\nShe has appeared at many Harry Potter events and other fan conventions over the years, including the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 world premiere on 7 July 2011 in Trafalgar Square in London,[3][66][67] LeakyCon 2011 in Orlando, Florida,[68] the Warner Bros. Studio Tour London: The Making of Harry Potter in October 2012,[69][70] LeakyCon Portland 2013, LeakyCon London 2013[71] and Misti-Con 2013 in Laconia, New Hampshire.[72] In December 2012, she along with Potter alum Ryan Turner (Hugo Weasley) participated in the Leighton Christmas Festival.[73][74]\n\nOn 21 December 2013, she along with the Elite Dance Studio performed for the Halftime Show NBA, Los Angeles Clippers.[75][76]\n\nMost recently, she was scheduled to appear as a guest at Gallifrey One 2014, a science fiction and Doctor Who fan convention, which took place 14–16 February at the Los Angeles Airport Marriott.[77] It was announced that she would be returning to LeakyCon 2014, which took place in Orlando, Florida from 30 July to 3 August.[78] She and her brother Joseph appeared as guests at the Midwest's Premier Doctor Who event, Chicago TARDIS 2014 from 28–30 November at the Westin Lombard Yorktwon Center.[79][80] In January 2015, she acted as a special guest in a Harry Potter celebration at the Riverview Middle School in New Brunswick, Canada via Skype of a live Q&A with a winning classroom.[81][82] She and her brother are scheduled to appear as guests at the the Twin Cities' premier Doctor Who convention, CONsole Room 2015 from 29-31 May at the Hilton Minneapolis/St. Paul Airport.[83]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nDarcey-Alden is originally from Yarnton in Oxford, Oxfordshire[4] although she moved to the United States with her immediate family in late 2012 to early 2013 when she was 13 years old[84][85] and she now currently resides in Los Angeles[86] in the city of Rancho Palos Verdes.[87] Her parents are Sarah (née Darcey) and Philip \"Phil\" Alden[3][88] who runs a charity website.[89] She has a younger brother, Joseph (b. 2002) who is also an actor[90] and two older half-siblings, Becki and James Alden.[91][92] Her extended family includes her maternal uncle Chris Darcey[93] and her paternal uncles Martin and Jeremy Alden.[89]\n\nShe is a former pupil of the Dance 10 Theatre School within the Edward Feild Primary School named after Bishop Edward Feild, respectively in Kidlington which she attended from September 2005 to July 2011 based on English education.[3][4][94] From the autumn of 2011 to the autumn of 2012, she attended Gosford Hill School for the first year and a half of her secondary education—Year 7 and the first semester of Year 8—before moving to the U.S.[95][96] Since moving to the States, she finished her middle school education at Ridgecrest Intermediate School, which she attended from early 2013, starting at the second semester of Grade 7, and graduated in June 2014.[97] In late August 2014, she began attending Palos Verdes High School and is set to graduate in 2018.[98] She currently attends the Elite Dance Studio in L.A. for dance classes.[99]\n\nShe is also a big fan of Muggle Quidditch, and was taught to play by members of the five National teams that participated in the 2012 IQA Summer Games (Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, France, and the United States).[100][101] She commented to CNN:[102]\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm and Television[]\n\nYear Format Title Role 2008 Television Tess of the D'Urbervilles (Series 1, Episode 1) Modesty 2009 Television Robin Hood (Series 3, Episode 1) Mary 2009 Television Holby City (Series 12, Eps. 1-2, 11) Emma Walker 2011 Film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 Young Lily Evans 2012 Short Film Pranks Katie 2012 Television Doctor Who (Series 7, Episode 6) Francesca \"Franny\" Latimer 2013 Film Welcome to the Punch 12-Year-Old Girl 2013 Short Film Sam and Isobel Isobel 2013 Television Borgia (Series 2, Eps. 11-12, deleted scenes) Felice della Rovere\n\nTheatre[]\n\nYear Format Title Role Notes 2007 Stage Play Aladdin Street Urchin Dir.

She stated, \"I think because a lot of the characters, the main characters in Harry Potter, they're all kind of [points to Scarlett Byrne and Devon Murray ] your age now growing up... so, it's kind of hard for me. But I think I'm probably part Ginny, part Hermione. Hermione, because she's, 'Books, books, books! School, school, school!' That's kind of me because I'm very 'school', very 'books.' But then Ginny, because she's a really friendly person, she likes to have a bit of fun. She's a bit 'risk takey', sometimes she'll take risks and stuff, which is me sometimes, depending. [...] Yeah, probably between those two, because it's kind of difficult for me because also they [Scarlett and Devon] are a lot older.\"[120]\n\nHer parents share the same first names as fellow English actress Rachel Hurd-Wood's parents—Sarah and Phil.\n\nReferences[]\n\nNotes[]\n\nMcCabe, Bob.
