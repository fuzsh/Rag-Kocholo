The ONLY way to assure a safe and speedy signing procedure for everyone is below, and we are counting on your participation!\n\nLeakyCon is one of very few conferences that offers autograph sessions at no additional cost; however, registration for LeakyCon does not guarantee you access to any autograph session. In an effort to eliminate waiting time and run the signings at LeakyCon 2013 more efficiently, we have borrowed a procedure from one of the only other conferences to offer free signatures, a large conference you may have heard of called Comic-Con.\n\nPlease note the following procedures only pertain to regular guests and most autograph events. LeakyCon Lit signings are only open to those LeakyCon guests who have registered for Leaky Lit. Fandom rock signings will be done on a first-come, first-serve basis. If you are a RockStar, then you have a special plan in place, and the following only concerns you if you would like to enter the drawing for an additional signing pass.\n\nAccess to all autograph sessions will be granted via drawings on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday mornings. Attendance at this drawing is the only way to assure your spot in the signing, unless you are a RockStar (see above).\n\nDrawing Times:\n\nFriday at 8:00 AM in the Exhibit Hall\n\n9:30 AM: Team StarKid\n\n12:00 PM: Scarlett Byrne, Devon Murray, Jackie Emerson, Tom Lenk, Ellie Darcey-Alden\n\n2:00 PM: Lizzie Bennet Cast & Crew\n\n6:00 PM: Anthony Rapp, Jaime Lyn Beatty, Lauren Lopez, Julia Albain\n\nYou may also pick up a pass for the following photo booth opportunities:\n\n1:00 PM Devon Murray\n\n2:00 PM Ellie Darcey-Alden\n\nSaturday at 8:00 AM in the Exhibit Hall\n\n11:00 AM: Jackie Emerson\n\n12:00 PM: Lizzie Bennet Cast & Crew\n\n1:00 PM: Devon Murray, Scarlett Byrne, Ellie Darcey-Alden, Curt Mega, Dominic Barnes, Titus Makin\n\n2:00 PM: Tom Lenk, Amber Benson, Anthony Rapp\n\nYou may also pick up a pass for the following photo booth opportunities:\n\n12:00 PM Scarlett Byrne\n\n1:00 PM Jackie Emerson\n\n2:00 PM Tom Lenk & Amber Benson\n\nSunday at 8:00 AM in the Exhibit Hall\n\n11:00 AM: Team StarKid\n\nSo here’s how it works:\n\nDrawing Procedure\n\nPlease line up in the Exhibit Hall at the time listed above to enter the drawing for the signing pass you wish to have. There will be multiple lines, each marked with the pass you may obtain.\n\nThere will be a volunteer at the front of each line with a mystery bag of passes.\n\nWhen you reach the front of the line you will pull a pass out of the bag.\n\nYou will either pull a winning or a non-winning pass.\n\nIf you pull a winning pass, then you have gained access to that signing and should reconvene at the Exhibition Hall at the time of the signing.\n\nIf you pull a non-winning pass, then put it back in the bag. You have not gained access to that signing and should try again the next day or you may return to the end of the line if you wish.\n\nThere will be enough passes in the bag to help assure that all of the signings are full and that no one waits in line unnecessarily.\n\nAll of the drawings for the day’s signings and photo booths will take place at the same time. When you arrive for the drawing, you should choose the signing session you are most interested in and stand that line first. Once you have drawn a pass for that signing, you may stand in the other line, if you like. (For example, On Friday you could head to the Team StarKid line, draw a pass, and then join the HP Actors line for a chance at that signing.) This should be a very fast process so please don’t worry about not getting on the line you want!\n\nOk, so you have your pass... what next?\n\nSigning Procedure\n\nIf you won a pass at the morning lottery, please line up at the signing room at the allotted signing time. There is no need to line up early. Everyone who receives a pass will be granted access to the appropriate signing. However, it is recommended that you line up closer to the beginning of the signing rather than closer to the end. The signing will end at its appointed time, and we need to move things along - we know you’re ready to go to your next bit of programming, so we don’t want to hold you up!\n\nYou may only have one item signed at each signing. You may not bring in items from your friends who didn’t get passes. One person - one item. This is the only way we can get things going with the speed they need to be respectful to everyone.\n\nAfter you get your items signed, please leave the signing area promptly.\n\nYou may not take photographs or videos of yourself with our special guests, or engage in any other activity that will hold up the lines. If you do so, then your pass may be revoked.\n\nPlease remember that there will be a lot of LeakyCon guests at each signing. Respect your fellow fans - they are just as excited as you are!\n\nWe want to allow as many guests to attend each signing as possible, but in order to do so, we need your help. We need your patience, your calm, and your awesome attitude. Thank you so much for your cooperation!\n\nOur signing procedure is adapted from the one used at Comic-Con, of which we at LeakyCon are big fans. If they can get through that many people fairly, we can work together to make it happen, too!\n\nPlease remember that autographs are not guaranteed as part of your LeakyCon experience; this is how we make sure you don't have to pay for them!

Attendance at this drawing is the only way to assure your spot in the signing, unless you are a RockStar (see above).\n\nDrawing Times:\n\nFriday at 8:00 AM in the Exhibit Hall\n\n9:30 AM: Team StarKid\n\n12:00 PM: Scarlett Byrne, Devon Murray, Jackie Emerson, Tom Lenk, Ellie Darcey-Alden\n\n2:00 PM: Lizzie Bennet Cast & Crew\n\n6:00 PM: Anthony Rapp, Jaime Lyn Beatty, Lauren Lopez, Julia Albain\n\nYou may also pick up a pass for the following photo booth opportunities:\n\n1:00 PM Devon Murray\n\n2:00 PM Ellie Darcey-Alden\n\nSaturday at 8:00 AM in the Exhibit Hall\n\n11:00 AM: Jackie Emerson\n\n12:00 PM: Lizzie Bennet Cast & Crew\n\n1:00 PM: Devon Murray, Scarlett Byrne, Ellie Darcey-Alden, Curt Mega, Dominic Barnes, Titus Makin\n\n2:00 PM: Tom Lenk, Amber Benson, Anthony Rapp\n\nYou may also pick up a pass for the following photo booth opportunities:\n\n12:00 PM Scarlett Byrne\n\n1:00 PM Jackie Emerson\n\n2:00 PM Tom Lenk & Amber Benson\n\nSunday at 8:00 AM in the Exhibit Hall\n\n11:00 AM: Team StarKid\n\nSo here’s how it works:\n\nDrawing Procedure\n\nPlease line up in the Exhibit Hall at the time listed above to enter the drawing for the signing pass you wish to have. There will be multiple lines, each marked with the pass you may obtain.\n\nThere will be a volunteer at the front of each line with a mystery bag of passes.\n\nWhen you reach the front of the line you will pull a pass out of the bag.\n\nYou will either pull a winning or a non-winning pass.\n\nIf you pull a winning pass, then you have gained access to that signing and should reconvene at the Exhibition Hall at the time of the signing.\n\nIf you pull a non-winning pass, then put it back in the bag. You have not gained access to that signing and should try again the next day or you may return to the end of the line if you wish.\n\nThere will be enough passes in the bag to help assure that all of the signings are full and that no one waits in line unnecessarily.\n\nAll of the drawings for the day’s signings and photo booths will take place at the same time. When you arrive for the drawing, you should choose the signing session you are most interested in and stand that line first. Once you have drawn a pass for that signing, you may stand in the other line, if you like. (For example, On Friday you could head to the Team StarKid line, draw a pass, and then join the HP Actors line for a chance at that signing.) This should be a very fast process so please don’t worry about not getting on the line you want!\n\nOk, so you have your pass... what next?\n\nSigning Procedure\n\nIf you won a pass at the morning lottery, please line up at the signing room at the allotted signing time. There is no need to line up early. Everyone who receives a pass will be granted access to the appropriate signing. However, it is recommended that you line up closer to the beginning of the signing rather than closer to the end. The signing will end at its appointed time, and we need to move things along - we know you’re ready to go to your next bit of programming, so we don’t want to hold you up!\n\nYou may only have one item signed at each signing. You may not bring in items from your friends who didn’t get passes. One person - one item. This is the only way we can get things going with the speed they need to be respectful to everyone.\n\nAfter you get your items signed, please leave the signing area promptly.\n\nYou may not take photographs or videos of yourself with our special guests, or engage in any other activity that will hold up the lines. If you do so, then your pass may be revoked.\n\nPlease remember that there will be a lot of LeakyCon guests at each signing. Respect your fellow fans - they are just as excited as you are!\n\nWe want to allow as many guests to attend each signing as possible, but in order to do so, we need your help. We need your patience, your calm, and your awesome attitude. Thank you so much for your cooperation!\n\nOur signing procedure is adapted from the one used at Comic-Con, of which we at LeakyCon are big fans. If they can get through that many people fairly, we can work together to make it happen, too!\n\nPlease remember that autographs are not guaranteed as part of your LeakyCon experience; this is how we make sure you don't have to pay for them!

The signing will end at its appointed time, and we need to move things along - we know you’re ready to go to your next bit of programming, so we don’t want to hold you up!\n\nYou may only have one item signed at each signing. You may not bring in items from your friends who didn’t get passes. One person - one item. This is the only way we can get things going with the speed they need to be respectful to everyone.\n\nAfter you get your items signed, please leave the signing area promptly.\n\nYou may not take photographs or videos of yourself with our special guests, or engage in any other activity that will hold up the lines. If you do so, then your pass may be revoked.\n\nPlease remember that there will be a lot of LeakyCon guests at each signing. Respect your fellow fans - they are just as excited as you are!\n\nWe want to allow as many guests to attend each signing as possible, but in order to do so, we need your help. We need your patience, your calm, and your awesome attitude. Thank you so much for your cooperation!\n\nOur signing procedure is adapted from the one used at Comic-Con, of which we at LeakyCon are big fans. If they can get through that many people fairly, we can work together to make it happen, too!\n\nLeakyCon 2013 Signing & Photo Booth Procedures\n\nHey everyone: this is very important info that applies to every LeakyCon guest! The ONLY way to assure a safe and speedy signing procedure for everyone is below, and we are counting on your participation!\n\nLeakyCon is one of very few conferences that offers autograph sessions at no additional cost; however, registration for LeakyCon does not guarantee you access to any autograph session. In an effort to eliminate waiting time and run the signings at LeakyCon 2013 more efficiently, we have borrowed a procedure from one of the only other conferences to offer free signatures, a large conference you may have heard of called Comic-Con.\n\nPlease note the following procedures only pertain to regular guests and most autograph events. LeakyCon Lit signings are only open to those LeakyCon guests who have registered for Leaky Lit. Fandom rock signings will be done on a first-come, first-serve basis. If you are a RockStar, then you have a special plan in place, and the following only concerns you if you would like to enter the drawing for an additional signing pass.\n\nAccess to all autograph sessions will be granted via drawings on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday mornings. Attendance at this drawing is the only way to assure your spot in the signing, unless you are a RockStar (see above).\n\nDrawing Times:\n\nFriday at 8:00 AM in the Exhibit Hall\n\n9:30 AM: Team StarKid\n\n12:00 PM: Scarlett Byrne, Devon Murray, Jackie Emerson, Tom Lenk, Ellie Darcey-Alden\n\n2:00 PM: Lizzie Bennet Cast & Crew\n\n6:00 PM: Anthony Rapp, Jaime Lyn Beatty, Lauren Lopez, Julia Albain\n\nYou may also pick up a pass for the following photo booth opportunities:\n\n1:00 PM Devon Murray\n\n2:00 PM Ellie Darcey-Alden\n\nSaturday at 8:00 AM in the Exhibit Hall\n\n11:00 AM: Jackie Emerson\n\n12:00 PM: Lizzie Bennet Cast & Crew\n\n1:00 PM: Devon Murray, Scarlett Byrne, Ellie Darcey-Alden, Curt Mega, Dominic Barnes, Titus Makin\n\n2:00 PM: Tom Lenk, Amber Benson, Anthony Rapp\n\nYou may also pick up a pass for the following photo booth opportunities:\n\n12:00 PM Scarlett Byrne\n\n1:00 PM Jackie Emerson\n\n2:00 PM Tom Lenk & Amber Benson\n\nSunday at 8:00 AM in the Exhibit Hall\n\n11:00 AM: Team StarKid\n\nSo here’s how it works:\n\nDrawing Procedure\n\nPlease line up in the Exhibit Hall at the time listed above to enter the drawing for the signing pass you wish to have. There will be multiple lines, each marked with the pass you may obtain.\n\nThere will be a volunteer at the front of each line with a mystery bag of passes.\n\nWhen you reach the front of the line you will pull a pass out of the bag.\n\nYou will either pull a winning or a non-winning pass.\n\nIf you pull a winning pass, then you have gained access to that signing and should reconvene at the Exhibition Hall at the time of the signing.\n\nIf you pull a non-winning pass, then put it back in the bag. You have not gained access to that signing and should try again the next day or you may return to the end of the line if you wish.\n\nThere will be enough passes in the bag to help assure that all of the signings are full and that no one waits in line unnecessarily.\n\nAll of the drawings for the day’s signings and photo booths will take place at the same time. When you arrive for the drawing, you should choose the signing session you are most interested in and stand that line first. Once you have drawn a pass for that signing, you may stand in the other line, if you like. (For example, On Friday you could head to the Team StarKid line, draw a pass, and then join the HP Actors line for a chance at that signing.) This should be a very fast process so please don’t worry about not getting on the line you want!\n\nOk, so you have your pass... what next?\n\nSigning Procedure\n\nIf you won a pass at the morning lottery, please line up at the signing room at the allotted signing time. There is no need to line up early. Everyone who receives a pass will be granted access to the appropriate signing.
