        "text": "For years as a kid, I longed to know the Baby-Sitters Club. My sister would read of their adventures in Ann M. Martin’s blockbuster middle-grade book series and relay them to me, but something—probably some lame, inculcated belief that the novels were for girls—kept me from reading them myself. (I threw all that pretense away for the Sweet Valley High books, which I just could not resist.) So I only knew dimly of Kristy’s great idea to start a baby-sitting club, of Claudia’s artsiness, of Stacey’s Manhattan origin story, of Mary-Anne’s burgeoning step-sisterhood with Dawn. All the early teenage (and some tweenage) goings-on of Stonybrook, CT glimmered as a faint, homey reality, always slightly outside my grasp.\n\nI was excited, then, when, at age 12, the Baby-Sitters Club movie came out. It was my chance to get some distilled view of Martin’s world—with its careful descriptions of bedroom color schemes, of mild interactions with boys, of fussy kids who needed their baby-sitters’ resourceful mollifying—in just 95 minutes.\n\nBut upon seeing the film, my sister informed me that it didn’t get the books right. She said the movie was trying too hard to be “cool”—but not succeeding, unlike the previous summer’s Camp Nowhere, beloved in our home. (I’m yours forever, Mud.) My sister was done reading the books by then, and the movie hadn’t done the trick. So I was consigned—I thought, for many years—to forever only half get the BSC references, to never really understand this coalition of busybody kids who ached for the approving awe of adults impressed by their prim, ordered maturity. (For truly, that was one of the ultimate fantasies of the Baby-Sitters Club books, no?)\n\nBut! What we think is lost can sometimes be found. No, I did not spend quarantine reading the books. Instead, I’ve used this lonely time revisiting other childhood characters in new and updated forms: polished and prettified versions of Mario and Link, in their respective Nintendo Switch games. (A true pleasure, by the way. Who knew video games could have such a therapeutic effect on someone in their late 30s who’d long ago forsaken the medium?)\n\nThe Baby-Sitters did still find me, though, in their new Netflix series—a ten-episode triumph of children’s programming (premiering July 3) that is, I hope, as winning and quaint and charming as the books themselves.\n\nThe series was created by the writer Rachel Shukert, with whom I share some kinship as she, like me, used to be a professional TV recapper. (Her magnum opus was covering NBC’s woebegone musical series Smash.) You’ll find little, or maybe none, of that snark in Shukert’s Baby-Sitters Club, which instead takes a sweet and sensitive—but often laugh-out-loud funny, really!—tack to adapt several of the books into a season of television. What results is something that is dismayingly rare in TV and film: a depiction of kids at a particular age that does not force them to grow up too fast or drown them in precociousness.\n\nThe small miracle of Shukert’s series is how free it is in its earnest assessment of the liminal time of middle school, when many kids (not all, certainly) are stuck between the trappings of childhood and the wilds of adolescence—both its excitement and its creeping cynicism. The Baby-Sitters Club addresses that shift in a way that I’d imagine will be quite palatable to and processable by its intended young audience, while also nudging them forward into new understandings.\n\nAs Kristy and her pals start their baby-sitting agency—one compromised by early curfews and a general inability to operate motor vehicles—their individual lives all shift in various ways. Some meet boys (Stacey and Mary-Anne in particular); others deal with family turmoil like an ailing grandmother and a divorced mother’s remarriage. And they have the tricky mechanics of eighth-grade friendship to contend with, as each kid lurches at her own pace into a new stage of life, sometimes leaving another behind for a bit while she scrambles to catch up. The Baby-Sitters Club has no impatience for them to get there, but rather takes sage and compassionate interest in the process.\n\nFrom a certain angle, sure, The Baby-Sitters Club depicts an unreachable utopia. Everyone is mostly kind and financially comfortable. Contemporary social issues still vexing for many adults are met and handled with open-minded calm. The patter of life in Stonybrook is almost strenuously amiable, full of productive lessons to learn and pretty houses in which pleasant people dwell. But within that gentle framing, Shukert and her writing staff find plenty of complexity and shading, smoothly reshaping the now slightly dated vernacular of Martin’s era into something that makes responsible sense in 2020. Again, this is a show for kids (and, yes, nostalgic adults), and its approach to that demographic’s interests is neither harsh nor dishonestly rosy.\n\nThe show’s mission lives or dies by the actors cast to play the members of the club. Thankfully, a quintet of natural, lively actors has been assembled. As Kristy, Sophie Grace brings to mind Lindsay Lohan’s memorably perspicacious debut in The Parent Trap. She’s smart and spiky and has an easy command of the show’s bouncy dialogue. Malia Baker makes Mary-Anne’s anxiety about getting older and leaving kiddie stuff behind heartbreakingly relatable; she perfectly communicates all the itch to grow up because everyone else is, while not wanting to lose the relatively innocent comforts of the past. (Mary-Anne is also grieving her mother, a fact the show approaches gracefully and poignantly.) Shay Rudolph and Xochitl Gomez, as Stacey and Dawn, add welcome energy as well, somehow bringing a bit of wisdom to re-creations of experiences that they have, one would assume, lived themselves only very recently.\n\nMy favorite of the bunch is Momona Tanada as Claudia, whom Netflix viewers the world over might recognize as young Lara Jean in the To All the Boys movies. Tanada is a delight as Claudia, witty and warm and adept at creating a credible bond between Claudia and the other girls. Her performance is a good representation of what the whole series does well: Claudia still seems like a kid, because she is, but also seems ably poised and ready for what lies ahead. There are stumbles to be had, hard things to be endured, but with Claudia and her pals leading the charge, we trust that the show will get us through safely.\n\nNo, not all young people in the unscripted world will see such a turbulence-free transition into their teen years, or out of their childhood ones. But The Baby-Sitters Club is not smarmy or prescriptive in its sunniness. It instead offers—just as the books did, I’m told—a window into an imagined realm where difficult things can play out in a controlled environment, a sort of terrarium of nascent adolescent girl life that may provide some armor or insight to those endeavoring to do the real thing. That task is taken seriously by the show’s entirely non-teen (I think) staff, without condescension or any ironic gesture. Though there is one little meta wink to the realities of the teen continuum, and to the adults watching the show: Kristy’s mom is played by 90s Clueless queen Alicia Silverstone. Here’s our Cher, all grown up just like us, saying it’s okay to get older—as long as you don’t forget how it all used to feel, and what it all seemed to mean.\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— The 10 Best Movies of 2020 (So Far)\n\n— Review: Spike Lee’s Da 5 Bloods Is Gold\n\n— The Wild Life and Many Loves of Ava Gardner\n\n— Inside Pete Davidson and John Mulaney’s “Make-A-Wish” Friendship\n\n— Now Streaming: Over 100 Years of Black Defiance at the Movies\n\n— Is TV Sabotaging Itself With Shrinking Shows?\n\n— From the Archive: Exposing MGM’s Smear Campaign Against Rape Survivor Patricia Douglas\n\nLooking for more?
