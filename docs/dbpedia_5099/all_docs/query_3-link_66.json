Clarke was born in Hammersmith, West London. Clarke made his film debut in the commercially successful “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” when it was announced in late 2010 that he had been cast as the younger version of Severus Snape, played by fellow late British veteran Alan Rickman as an adult in all eight films and Alec Hopkins as a teenager in 2007‘s “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix”. Then 13-years-old, a casting director visited Latymer Upper School in which Clarke was in attendance at the time, and invited a selection of students a chance to attend an open casting call. Clarke auditioned for the parts of either young James Potter or young Snape. On 25 January 2010, he was called back at Pinewood Studios where he met director David Yates and worked with a number of other potentials for the parts of young James Potter, Sirius Black, Severus Snape and Lily Evans. During the process, the children were asked to improvise short conversations.\n\nAnother recall took place and he subsequently received a screen test with then 10-year- old Ellie Darcey-Alden (who would be cast as young Lily Evans) at Leavesden Studios “as well as an associated costume, hair and makeup meeting“. In February, he and Ellie were notified they had received their respective parts. When asked by a fan of how he might have received the role, Clarke honestly admitted: “I guess [the filmmakers] just liked my awkwardness. At the first audition, I was going for either young Snape or young James. It wasn‘t until I was recalled to audition in front of David Yates at Leavesden that I was told I‘d be auditioning for the role of young Snape. And being a Harry Potter nerd, my description of Snape‘s character was pretty good. My acting on the other hand...“ Since completing Potter, he has appeared in many short films, including lead parts in “In the Wake of Sirens” – a modern interpretation of William Golding‘s “Lord of the Flies”set within the confines of a locked car and was completed in late 2012 – and “Andys”. The latter was loosely based on Philip K. Dick‘s 1968 science fiction novel, “Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?”, and was directed by fellow Harry Potter alum Alec Hopkins, best known for playing the teenage incarnation of Snape in “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix”. In August 2017, he joined the cast of Cambridge University American Stage Tour‘s “A Midsummer Night‘s Dream” in the supporting role of Oberon, King of the Fairies.\n\nIn 2022, his most recent film “Murder in Provence” was published..\n\nCHRIS RANKIN\n\nChris is recognized internationally as Percy Weasley, a role he played in the Harry Potter film franchise. At the age of 16, Chris wrote a letter applying for an audition for Harry Potter, and has never looked back. Chris has more recently taken a step behind the camera and helped coordinate many high-end TV productions. Recent work includes “A Discovery of Witches’’ (Sky / Bad Wolf), “Downton Abbey” (ITV / Carnival), “The Bastard Executioner” (FOX), “Atlantis” (BBC / Urban Myth), and directed his first short film ‘Dad’, which has been shortlisted as part of the 2020 Cardiff International Film Festival.\n\nAs well as screen projects, Chris remains committed to live performance, both heading up the Brecon Little Theatre company and appearing in pantomime. He continues to appear regularly at fan-related events across the globe from the smallest arts festivals to massively franchised shows. Chris is also a keen blogger, traveller, musical theatre buff, fan boy, LGBTQ+ ally, and dog lover. He is a patron of the charity “Transfiguring Adoption” and regularly supports the work of the Albert Kennedy Trust.\n\nJAMES PAYTON\n\nJames Payton is best known for his performances as Frank Longbottom in “Harry Potter & The Order of the Phoenix” (2007), USO Hitler in Marvel's “Captain America: The First Avenger” (2011), Tony Blair in the Nick Moran directed film of Alan McGee's life, “Creation Stories” (2021), as himself in Oliver Guy-Watkins award winning documentary, “Who is James Payton?” (2020), & as Gabriel in two episodes of “Wedding Season” (2022) on Disney+ Upcoming work includes Luc Besson's “Dogman” (2023), alongside Caleb Landry-Jones, Rian Johnson's “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” (2022) and several other projects for companies such as Netflix. He cites Peter Sellers, Alec Guinness, David Niven and Noël Coward as influences. James continues to work in Film, Television and Commercials despite numerous attempts to stop him. He still lives in London, even though he should know better!\n\nTIANA BENJAMIN\n\nA British actress, best known for her role as Angelina Johnson in the Harry Potter trilogy and Chelsea Fox in BBC's “Eastenders”. Tiana made her acting debut aged 11 on stage at the Jackson’s Lane Theatre before going on to study at the acclaimed Anna Schers Theatre School in the late 90’s. She has since gone on to appear in BAFTA winning BBC children’s drama, “The Dumping Ground” and before her star turn in EastEnders, she appeared in a number of British drama series including “Rose and Maloney” alongside Sarah Lancashire, “Dalziel and Pascoe” with the late Warren Clarke as well as notable performances in “Casualty, Holby City“ and “The Bill”. What followed was Tiana's formidable 4 year reign over the residents of the fictional E20 as troublesome Chelsea Fox in “Eastenders“. Over 400 episodes later and the character remains etched in a generation as her complex and tough performance makes her unforgettable. Most recently, Tiana has performed over the pond in Hollywood with Oscar nominated actor Peter Bogdanovich in the, as yet, unreleased art house film The Creatress. Tiana describes it as a “Woody Allen- ish romantic comedy with a twist” and says her role as Jessica Morrison is a first venture into the character actress phase of her career. Additionally, Tiana travelled to Italy to shoot on Feature Film, “Love In Verona” (currently in post-production) playing lead role, Melissa Jones."
