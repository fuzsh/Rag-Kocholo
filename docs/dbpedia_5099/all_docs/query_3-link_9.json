Robertson is a veteran actress having appeared in many primetime episodic dramas including: Six Feet Under, Grey’s Anatomy, True Blood, 90210, The Mentalist and Good Trouble to name but a few.\n\nSo, just how will Cornelia and Famke figure into the adventure of Carly and Felicia, and where it leads them?

Wactor, 37, came upon a scene where a crew of seemingly three men were trying to steal the catalytic converter from his vehicle, when one of the masked men shot Wactor in the chest and killed him.\n\nNow, Johnny’s mother, Scarlett Wactor, spoke to Fox 11 News in Los Angeles to give an update on the case and to clarify a key moment leading up to her son’s murder.\n\nScarlett shared that her son was unable to see what the suspects were doing clearly; due to a streetlight which had been burned out for weeks. She also said that Johnny did not physically confront or try to stop the catalytic converter thieves as had been previously reported. The LAPD reported Wactor was shot without provocation.\n\nThere are some breaks in the case, but as Scarlett revealed, the police don’t tell much to her, for fear, she might say something while she is doing media that might hinder the investigation.\n\nWactor said, “They definitely have a pretty good photo that they’re not releasing, but that they’ve seen this and so this tells me that they’re going in the right direction, that somebody knows something. And we need help from the community to get them arrested and put away and convicted.”\n\nLast week, the LAPD released a few surveillance photos of the suspects. along with images of an allegedly stolen vehicle the suspects are believed to have escaped in. Of note: is that one of the suspects had a tattoo above the left eye and on the right cheek.\n\nJohnny’s mom is also calling for stricter crime laws noting that Los Angeles needs to, “Definitely hire more police. You need more presence, you need more cameras, you don’t need burnt out streetlights. People that work there after midnight, the businesses should be made to provide protected and guarded parking. Definitely change that catalytic converter law. There are things out there that can be done. You need to lower the felony threshold and stop dumbing down the laws.”\n\nAs to how she wants her son and the former GH star to be remembered, Scarlett said that Johnny was a good, compassionate person who helped everyone and loved life. Sadly, she concluded, “He had a very big zest for life. And to me, I believe he still had a very big future. And they stole it from him and stole him from us.”\n\nAnyone with information about the suspects is urged to call the LAPD’s Central Station at 213-486-6606. During business hours, LAPD homicide detectives can be reached at 213-996-4143 or 213-996-4173.

I Think Because I Didn’t See it Coming.”\n\nBy\n\nAs previously posted, Jacqueline Grace Lopez made her exit on ABC’s General Hospital when during the Tuesday, August 13th episode, Blaze and Kristina (Kate Mansi) broke up, and then Blaze, for all intent and purposes, broke up with her mother, Natalia (E, who is also her music manager, Natalia (Eva LaRue). That set the stage for the character to leave Port Charles to embark on a world tour performing as the opening act for Miquel Morez (aka Ricky Martin).\n\nOn Wednesday, August 14th, Lopez confirmed her exit from the soap opera, taking to Instagram to share her parting words, which included she was surprised that GH wrote Blaze off the canvas.\n\nJacqueline began, “Not gonna lie, this goodbye hurts. I think because I didn’t see it coming. That and when you spend almost two years with this group, you start to feel like part of the fabric.”\n\nHowever, she remained so thankful to the GH creatives for the opportunity to be a part of the iconic show. “I’m so grateful to Frank (Valentini, EP, GH) for asking me back. I am grateful to everyone I got to tell stories with, both in front and behind the camera,” she related. “This cast and crew work so hard and have taught me so much. Jobs come and go, but it’s the people you miss. I’m definitely going to miss this bunch.”\n\nSpeaking to inclusivity on television, Jacqueline added, “I’ve mentioned that as a brown girl, it’s so hard to see ourselves in media, period. To have writers introduce Latiné story elements because of my character? Even adding a Latiné last name to my character’s name? Getting onscreen family and backstory as a non-contract actor? Being a part of the opening titles?! Turning a 10 episode part into almost two years??? Babyyy, she done did that! Sometimes we have to be the change we don’t see.✨”\n\nFinally, Lopez gave major kudos to the audience at home, saying, “GH FANS!!! My heart is so full. Especially fans that embraced Blaze’s journey as a gay woman and formed community around each other as a result: Y’all got me through some moments. I poured myself into this story because I knew it was going to matter. I just didn’t know how much. You have humbled me, reminding me the need for feeling seen onscreen is absolutely universal to all marginalized communities. I learned that through Allie. Through you. Thank you for sharing your stories, your words of encouragement, and for the generous gifts! Know I carry all of that with me always. I hope I did right by you. That’s all I wanted to do.”\n\n“Ultimately, my joy in this work is to help people feel seen. And for that reason alone, this chapter of Blaze was an absolute gift,” Jacqueline concluded. “It feels so sudden, but I have to trust in timing. Heading out of Port Charles with nothing but gratitude. Thank you General Hospital.”\n\nJacqueline first played Blaze back in 2022. Following that, she came to the soap a few times before her last run which took her through to this summer.\n\nWhat do you think about Jacqueline’s parting thoughts? Will you miss her as Blaze? Was her departure part of a show reset from the latest co-head writing regime?
