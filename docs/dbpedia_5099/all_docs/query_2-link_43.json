A reclusive child that prefers to keep to herself, Katie moves into her new room unaware that the ghost of a mischievous little boy with a penchant for tricks and games also inhabits her home. Katie continuously falls victim to the boy’s childish pranks and is unable to convince her new foster mother that another presence resides in the house with them. This sets her on a quest to obtain proof of the boy’s existence. What develops is a territorial feud between Katie and the ghost, as Katie tries to stop the ghost from encroaching on her new home.\n\nThe Cast\n\nEllie Darcey-Alden\n\nEllie Darcey-Alden is an amazing young actress who is best known for her role as young Lily Evans in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2.
