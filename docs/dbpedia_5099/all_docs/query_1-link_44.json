        "text": "Harry Potter fans already know where Harry, Ron and Hermione ended up – but not everyone can be the Boy Who Lived or the Boy Who Lived's best friend, or the Boy Who Lived's best friend's girlfriend, OK?!\n\nAnyway, remember the Potter family parents Lily Evans and James Potter? Of course you do.\n\nWell, child stars Ellie Darcey-Alden and Alfie McIlwain, who played their younger selves during flashbacks in Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part II, are grown-ups now.\n\nRelated: Harry Potter – What 12 of the movie's young stars look like now\n\nEllie, who took on the role of young Lily when she was just 11 years old, is now aged 17 and living in LA.\n\nAfter starring in the Harry Potter franchise, the Oxford-born child star went on to appear in the Doctor Who 2012 Christmas special 'The Snowmen', playing Francesca.\n\nShe's also featured in adverts, and worked as a model and a voiceover artist.\n\nBut now, Ellie is a competitive ballet, jazz and contemporary dancer – and, hilariously, a massive fan of Muggle Quidditch.\n\n\"I think it's brilliant, it''s really fun to watch,\" she told CNN.\n\n\"I didn't realise it was so rough and tough and it's great to just have a go!\"\n\nRelated: See how the Harry Potter movies would look with the cast they were meant to have\n\nAnd as for Alfie – who starred as young James Potter at the age of 13 – he's now stepped away from acting.\n\nThe 19-year-old is currently travelling in Thailand."
