        "text": "The Harry Potter cast collectively created one of the greatest franchises of all time. Notably, all of the Harry Potter cast members stuck around for the entire series. Here’s a list of all Harry Potter cast members, and where the biggest stars of the series are now.\n\nThe only significant actor who had to be replaced was Richard Harris, who unfortunately passed away after Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was filmed. He was replaced by Michael Gambon for Prisoner of Azkaban onward.\n\nThere was one other replacement, albeit a minor one: Crabbe actor Jamie Waylett did not appear in Deathly Hallows because he got in trouble for growing marijuana.\n\nSee a complete list of Harry Potter cast members below. For added fun, we’re sharing where the biggest Harry Potter cast members like Dan Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Maggie Smith are now. For the latest Wizarding World movie, book, and theme park news and analysis, click here! Or, why not study a list of Harry Potter spells?\n\nNo matter what you think of the adaptations in terms of loyalty to J.K. Rowling’s books, there’s no doubt that the Harry Potter cast members were a remarkable assembling of actors. Major British actors and actresses, and plenty of new faces, teamed up to create one of the most epic film stories in the history of Hollywood.\n\n‘Harry Potter’ Cast Members: The Kids\n\nAre you a big Harry Potter fan? Listen to MuggleCast, the weekly Harry Potter podcast discussing Fantastic Beasts, the original Harry Potter books, and so much more!\n\nHarry Potter – Daniel Radcliffe\n\nAbout: Daniel Radcliffe (actor)\n\nArticle Continues Below\n\nThough Radcliffe did not need to continue working after playing the one and only Harry Potter, the actor ended up having a very fruitful post-Potter career.\n\nRadcliffe had great roles in The Woman in Black, Horns, What If, and Now You See Me 2. Outside of filmmaking the actor has also had a major theater career: He’s starred in Equus (Broadway), How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (Broadway), The Cripple of Inishmann (on both Broadway and the West End), and The Lifespan of Fact (Broadway).\n\nIn 2020 Daniel Radcliffe had roles in Escape from Pretoria, Miracle Workers, and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs the Reverend. So far it looks like he hasn’t signed on for any projects in 2021, however that’s most likely due to the current pandemic that has greatly affected the entertainment business.\n\nAbout: Harry Potter (character)\n\nHarry Potter is the main character of the entire Harry Potter series, hence the name on all the books. He was the only child of James and Lily Potter, who were members of the original Order of the Phoenix. When Voldemort (an evil wizard) killed his parents, baby Harry Potter was sent to live wit his muggle aunt and uncle who refused to tell him the truth about his family.\n\nYears later, Harry Potter started to receive his letters from Hogwarts — and eventually learned the truth once Rubeus Hagrid came to find him. He had to no idea that he was known as the “Boy Who Lived” by the Wizarding world as the only sole survivor to the killing curse. He began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and his connection to Voldemort began to return.\n\nRon Weasley – Rupert Grint\n\nAbout: Rupert Grint (actor)\n\nOf the trio, Rupert Grint has been in the smallest projects after Harry Potter.\n\nHe’s appeared in several TV series including a pilot called Super Clyde, The ABC Murders, Snatch, and Sick Note. On the film side of his career he co-starred in Postman Pat and CBGB. He hasn’t totally left the world of HP — he’s contributed his voice to a couple of Wizarding World theme park projects at Universal.\n\nMost recently he’s been starring on the television series Servant. In his personal life, Rupert Grint has been dating actress Georgia Groome since 2011 – and in 2020 the couple had a daughter together.\n\nAbout: Ronald Weasley (character)\n\nRonald Weasley, also known as Ron, is a pureblood wizard and the sixth child of Arthur and Molly Weasley. Unlike many other pureblood wizards in the series, his family isn’t well off and they are also friendly with muggles/muggle born wizards. His siblings include Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George, and Ginny Weasley.\n\nHarry Potter and Ron quickly became friends at Hogwarts where they were both sorted into Gryffindor House. They met Hermione Granger early on, but didn’t officially become friends with her until sometime later in the year after a bit of a rough patch with Ron.\n\nHowever, once the three became friends they were inseparable. Ron’s greatest quality is perhaps his loyalty, much like his Patronus which is a dog.\n\nHermione Granger – Emma Watson\n\nAbout: Emma Watson (actress)\n\nWatson hasn’t starred in as many films as Radcliffe did after Harry Potter, but she’s been involved with several high-profile projects. She starred in the book-to-film adaptation of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Disney’s live-action re-telling of Beauty and the Beast, and The Bling Ring.\n\nFollowing starring in the Harry Potter series, the actress also attended Brown University. She took some time off over the years in order to make room for acting projects but eventually did graduate with an English literature degree in May of 2014.\n\nIn more recent years Emma Watson has devoted a lot of her time to activism and women’s rights work. She became the UN Women Global Goodwill Ambassador for HeForShe. She also began a feminist Goodreads book club titled Our Shared Shelf in 2016 to encourage the spread of feminist ideas. In 2019, she helped to set up Rights of Women, a legal hotline for people who have suffered sexual harassment at work.\n\nAbout: Hermione Granger (character)\n\nHermione Granger is the only muggle-born witch of her best friends, Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley. Despite both of her parents being muggles, Hermione goes on to become the top of her class. A fact that leads many of her classmates to dislike her, including Harry and Ron at least.\n\nAlthough they are not friends from the start of the book, they do become close friends by the end of the first book. Hermione ends up being a key player in the war against Voldemort, helping Harry and others work against him in the years to come. Even when Ron leaves Harry, Hermione is always there for Harry — a decision that is heartbreaking for the young woman given her romantic interest in Ron.\n\nDraco Malfoy – Tom Felton\n\nAbout: Tom Felton (actor)\n\nDespite not being one of the “big three,” Felton has had a great career in the years since the Potter films wrapped. He’s starred in Rise of the Planet of the Apes and the TV series Origin, plus he had a big role on The Flash season 3 as Julian Albert. He’s also kept up a busy fan convention schedule and has participated in numerous events surrounding the Harry Potter franchise, including several Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park attraction openings.\n\nAbout: Draco Malfoy (character)\n\nAside from Voldemort, Draco Malfoy might be the top nemesis to Harry Potter in the series. Early on, he tries to make friends with Harry — but when Harry snubs that invitation they become enemies. It doesn’t help that they were also sorted to rival houses — Gryffindor for Harry and Slytherin for Draco.\n\nThrough the years the rivalry continues and only seems to get worse. Draco, a pureblood Wizard, chooses to fight beside Voldemort with his family which really makes him an enemy for Harry. Though Harry still showed sympathy for his situation by the end of the war they never really moved past all the events that happened between them.\n\nNeville Longbottom – Matthew Lewis\n\nAbout: Matthew Lewis (actor)\n\nKnown as That Actor Who Had The Best Glow Up, Lewis has also had a great career after his time as Neville Longbottom came to a close. He co-starred in the TV series Ripper Street, Girlfriends, and Happy Valley. He also appeared in the popular film Me Before You alongside Game of Thorones actress Emilia Clarke and The Hunger Games actor Sam Claflin.\n\nIn 2018 Matthew Lewis married Angela Jones, whom he actually met at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter where she was working as one of the event coordinators.\n\nAbout: Neville Longbottom (character)\n\nNeville Longbottom is introduced as the scaredy-cat wizard that was somehow sorted into Gryffindor like Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Raised by his grandmother, Neville is seen throughout the schoolyears as clumsy, nervous, and self-conscious thanks to constantly being compared to his parents who were also part of the original Order of the Phoenix much like Harry’s parents.\n\nIn later years, he is shown gaining more confidence as he joins the others in their battle against the rise of Voldemort and becomes an important member of Dumbledore’s Army. Neville also took part in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, the Battle of Hogwarts, and killed Voldemort’s most precious Horcrux — Nagini.\n\nGinny Weasley – Bonnie Wright\n\nBonnie Wright’s Ginny Weasley portrayal is definitely a source of debate within the Harry Potter fandom, but she has also kept busy post Potter. She’s starred in a few smaller movies, including a 2018 retelling of A Christmas Carol, but she’s also moved behind the camera and has written, directed and produced a few shorts.\n\nLuna Lovegood – Evanna Lynch\n\nEvanna Lynch has always been a symbol of hope for Harry Potter fans, getting hired on for Order of the Phoenix as a massive fan of the series. Besides appearing on MuggleCast several times, she has also starred and appeared in several smaller movies since Deathly Hallows wrapped, including 2015’s Addiction, starring Pretty Little Liars actor Ian Harding. Notably, she also came third in season 27 of Dancing with the Stars. She currently hosts a vegan and sustainability podcast called The ChickPeeps.\n\nDean Thomas – Alfred Enoch\n\nDean Thomas was more of a background character in the Harry Potter movies, but Alfred Enoch’s career has blossomed since they wrapped. He has appeared in many TV shows, and has even starred in two, including the extremely popular How to Get Away With Murder, airing on ABC.\n\nCedric Diggory – Robert Pattinson\n\nIf there’s only one actor you’ve kept hearing about post-Harry Potter, it’s probably Robert Pattinson. Cedric Diggory only featured in Goblet of Fire, but he still left a huge mark on the series, even coming up in a big way in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. On top of starring in the Twilight saga as the iconic Edward Cullen, Pattinson has starred in tons of movies, including The Lighthouse. Even more importantly, he’s been cast as the DCEU’s new Batman!\n\nFred Weasley – James Phelps & George Weasley – Oliver Phelps\n\nThese fake red-heads have been keeping active in the Harry Potter community since Deathly Hallows: Part 2 was released. They frequently attend openings of various Harry Potter related events, including the grand opening of Universal Orlando’s new ride, Hagrid’s Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure. You can also find them doing Q&As and signing autographs at conventions throughout the year, like at Montreal Comiccon 2019 or Silicon Valley Comic Con 2019.\n\nPercy Weasley – Chris Rankin\n\nAfter playing the pompously-reformed Percy Weasley in the Harry Potter films, Chris Rankin largely put acting aside. Instead he took on work behind the camera, working as a production coordinator for Atlantis, Downton Abbey, and A Discovery of Witches. He did, however, make an appearance as Mycroft in the Hillywood Show’s parody of Sherlock. If you’d like a chance to meet Rankin, you’re in luck! Like his fellow Weasley brothers, Rankin can also be found at many fan conventions throughout the year.\n\nSeamus Finnigan – Devon Murray\n\nThis Gryffindor had a penchant for blowing things up in the Potter films, but he’s now put acting on the back burner. You can occasionally find Devon Murray making appearances at fan conventions, but he has mostly traded in films for horses, currently running a stable yard and competing in show jumping.\n\nCho Chang – Katie Leung\n\nHarry Potter’s first love interest in Harry Potter has continued to pursue acting after Deathly Hallows: Part 2. She had roles in both the Trainspotting sequel and The Foreigner (alongside Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan). She’s also had television roles, like Amazon Prime’s White Dragon and Channel 4’s Chimerica.\n\nFleur Delacour – Clémence Poésy\n\nPoésy’s first Harry Potter appearance was midway through the franchise, with Goblet of Fire. She wasn’t seen again until Deathly Hallows: Part 1, and Part 2, for her wedding to Bill Weasley and Dobby’s funeral at Shell Cottage. After Potter, Poésy has had consistent work, namely a lead role on The Tunnel for 3 seasons. She’s also set to star in Christopher Nolan’s new film, Tenet, set for release summer 2020.\n\nVincent Crabbe – Jamie Waylett\n\nWaylett’s only acting roles were in the Harry Potter. He does not, however, get to boast having been in every Potter film, as his time was cut just short and he did not appear in either Deathly Hallows film. In 2009, Waylett was charged with possession of cannabis, and was sentenced to 120 hours of community service. Most recently he was arrested for participation in the 2011 England riots, and was sentenced to two years in prison.\n\nGregory Goyle –Josh Herdman\n\nHerdman played the other half of Malfoy’s cronies in the Harry Potter series (the half that wasn’t arrested in real life), and is one of the few actors who has been in every film. He’s had a few acting roles since then, including 2018’s Robin Hood. He’s next set to appear in the television adaptation of Anthony Horowitz’s Alex Rider book series. In addition to acting, Herdman also began a career as an MMA fighter in 2016.\n\nPadma Patil – Afshan Azad\n\nAzad joined the Harry Potter cast in Goblet of Fire, just in time for the Yule Ball. She continued to appear in the subsequent Potter films, but has not pursued acting since. Soon after her Potter time, Azad was also going through personal troubles. Her brother was arrested for assaulting her and was sentenced to six months. On a lighter note, Azad got married in 2018, and fellow Potter actors Bonnie Wright and Katie Leung were in attendance.\n\nParvati Patil – Shefali Chowdhury\n\nLike her in-film sister, Chowdhury first appeared in Goblet of Fire, and returned for Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince. She did not, however, continue with either Deathly Hallows film. It would appear acting has not been on her radar, as her only roles post-Potter were in three short films: two in 2015 and one in 2019.\n\nOliver Wood – Sean Biggerstaff\n\nSean Biggerstaff bookended the Harry Potter franchise with appearances in the first two and final films. He’s had roles in a few short films since Harry Potter ended, as well as a role in Mary Queen of Scots, Whiskey Galore, and Hippie Hippie Shake which was never properly released.\n\nCormac McLaggen – Freddie Stroma\n\nFreddie Stroma may not have had a large part in the Harry Potter series, but he left an impression. It’s hard to forget his less than subtle romantic advances towards Hermione in Half-Blood Prince, of which Stroma played with the perfect amount of charm and slime. After Deathly Hallows, Stroma earned a role in Pitch Perfect, Game of Thrones, Unreal, and is set to be in Bridgerton alongside Julie Andrews, airing sometime this year.\n\nLavender Brown – Jessie Cave\n\nJessie Cave did an unforgettable job as Lavender Brown in Half-Blood Prince, it’s no wonder she’s had so many roles in various films and tv shows since Potter ended. Some of her most notable projects include 2012’s Great Expectations with Ralph Fiennes, Pride, Call the Midwife, Black Mirror, and Father Brown. Her next project is, coincidentally, called The Potters, though not much is known about it as this time. Aside from acting, Cave also published a book of cartoons in 2015, some of which have also been made into greeting cards.\n\nTom Riddle – Hero Fiennes Tiffin/Christian Coulson/Frank Dillane\n\nYoung Voldemort has had a few actors over the years. The youngest iteration of Tom Riddle was played by Hero Fiennes Tiffin in Half-Blood Prince flashbacks. If that name sounds familiar it’s because Hero is actually the nephew of Voldemort actor Ralph Fiennes. Hero Fiennes Tiffin can most recently be seen as the lead in Hulu’s After, based on the best-selling book. He’ll be reprising that role in the 2020 sequel After We Collided.\n\nDiary!Tom Riddle in Chamber of Secrets was played by Christian Coulson (pictured above). He made multiple television appearances over the years, including Gossip Girl, The Good Wife, and multi-episode arcs in The Good Wife and Mozart in the Jungle.\n\nThe Hogwarts-aged version of Tom Riddle in Half-Blood Prince was played by Frank Dillane. Dillane (son of Game of Thrones star Stephen Dillane) went on to star in Ron Howard’s whale blockbuster In the Heart of the Sea, as well as nabbing one of the lead roles in the Walking Dead spinoff show Fear the Walking Dead. Post Fear, Dillane has also had starring roles in three films, including How To Build A Girl alongside fellow Potter actress Emma Thompson.\n\nColin Creevey – Hugh Mitchell\n\nThe Harry Potter obsessed kid-photographer, Colin Creevey, had a memorable role in Chamber of Secrets, but unfortunately didn’t get a cameo during the Battle of Hogwarts (or maybe fortunately, given his fate). Creevey actor Hugh Mitchell has had a low-key acting life since Potter. He appeared as young Silas in The Da Vinci Code, as well as tv appearances in some British favorites including Parade’s End, The White Queen, and Wallander. If you like landscape photography though, Mitchell’s Instagram has plenty of it.\n\nAngelina Johnson – Tiana Benjamin\n\nAngelina Johnson was played by a different actress for the first three films (Danielle Tabor). For Goblet of Fire, Tiana Benjamin was cast, although that was the only Harry Potter film she appeared in. Benjamin’s previous commitment to British soap Eastenders prevented her from continuing the franchise, although she did voice Angelina Johnson for the Order of the Phoenix video game.\n\nViktor Krum – Stanislav Ianevski\n\nHermione’s first boyfriend was played by Stanislav Yanevski in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. He filmed scenes with Emma Watson for Bill and Fleur’s wedding in Deathly Hallows: Part 1, but this scene was cut from the film. After Potter, Yanevski has had a quiet career in the film and tv industry, but he is set to attend LeakyCon Orlando this summer.\n\nOther Harry Potter Cast Members\n\nKatie Bell – Georgina Leonidas\n\nBlaise Zabini – Louis Cordice\n\nPansy Parkinson – Scarlett Byrne\n\nNigel – William Melling\n\nLee Jordan – Luke Youngblood\n\nErnie MacMillan – Louis Doyle\n\nHannah Abbot – Charlotte Skeoch\n\nJustin Finch-Fletchley – Edward Randell\n\nMarcus Belby – Robert Knox\n\nRomilda Vane – Anna Shaffer\n\nLeanne – Isabella Laughland\n\nSusan Bones – Eleanor Columbus\n\nGabrielle Delacour – Angelica Mandy\n\nSlytherin twins – Amber Evans, Ruby Evans\n\nRoger Davies – Henry Lloyd Hughes\n\nPenelope Clearwater – Gemma Padley\n\nPiers Polkiss – Jason Boyd\n\nDudley’s friend Malcolm – Richard Macklin\n\nGryffindor Quidditch team – (Angelina Johnson) Danielle Taylor; (Alicia Spinnet) Leilah Sutherland/ Rochelle Douglas; (Katie Bell) Emily Dale\n\nSlytherin Quidditch team – David Holmes, Will Theakston, Scott Fearn\n\n‘Harry Potter’ Cast Members: The Adults\n\nAlbus Dumbledore – Michael Gambon\n\nAn actor like Michael Gambon needs no introduction. He joined the Harry Potter film series with Prisoner of Azkaban after the untimely death of the original Dumbledore actor Richard Harris.\n\nGambon continues to star in numerous film and TV projects. Of interest to Harry Potter fans, Gambon co-starred in the book-to-TV adaptation of J.K. Rowling’s first post-Potter novel, The Casual Vacancy. Outside of Rowling’s world he’s starred in the TV series Little Women and Fearless, and had roles in Kingsman: The Golden Circle and voiced Uncle Pastuzo in Paddington 2.\n\nSeverus Snape – Alan Rickman\n\nRickman unfortunately passed away in 2016 at the age of 69. The actor had a huge career outside of the Harry Potter film series, starring in well-known films like Die Hard, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and Love Actually. His final film was a voice role in Alice Through the Looking Glass as Absolem. He also voiced the Blue Caterpillar in Disney’s 2010 iteration of Alice in Wonderland.\n\nProfessor McGonagoll – Maggie Smith\n\nThe actress who played Dumbledore’s right-hand man has slowed down her Hollywood career after Harry Potter. Still, she’s had some big roles: She co-starred in the Downton Abbey TV series as the hilarious Violet Crawley, and will appear in the upcoming movie. She also starred in the two The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel films as well as 2015’s The Lady in the Van.\n\nLord Voldemort – Ralph Fiennes\n\nRalph Fiennes was a very established actor before the Harry Potter films, so naturally, that has continued since the series wrapped. Let’s be honest, it’s not like his nearly unrecognizable appearance as Lord Voldemort was going to increase his cred among the youth. When he’s not starring in Wes Anderson films and Bond movies, he’s kept up his Voldy chops by voicing the character for the Wizarding World rides, including “Escape from Gringotts.”\n\nBellatrix Lestrange – Helena Bonham Carter\n\nBellatrix Lestrange is an exceptionally wild woman, but she’s actually not that much more eccentric than a lot of the other characters Helena Bonham Carter has taken on. If you’ve ever seen a Tim Burton move, she was likely the woman at the helm, often alongside Johnny Depp, She was once married to the director, although the two split in 2014. She also starred in Ocean’s 8, and you can see her in The Crown season 4 as Princess Margaret, among many other projects.\n\nSirius Black – Gary Oldman\n\nGary Oldman might have been unrecognizable as Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour, but you definitely recognized him when he won the Oscar for the role! He’s starred in many acclaimed movies since he wrapped on HP, the most notable being The Dark Knight Rises as Commissioner Gordon, The Hitman’s Bodyguard and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.\n\nLucius Malfoy – Jason Isaacs\n\nSince Lucius Malfoy made his cowardly exit from the Harry Potter series, Jason Isaacs has enjoyed many roles. Some braver than the blonde Death Eater, and some not. Isaacs has appeared in some movies, but he’s largely found his homes on TV. He’s starred in Netflix’s The OA and Star Trek: Discovery, and has lent his iconic voice to Star Wars Rebels and The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance.\n\nRemus Lupin – David Thewlis\n\nDavid Thewlis went from playing Remus Lupin, everyone’s favorite Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts, to Sir Patrick, everyone’s least favorite villain in Wonder Woman. In between, he starred in many movies and has since held important roles in Fargo and even Netflix’s Big Mouth (he voices the Shame Wizard). Thewlis will also appear in the upcoming Avatar sequels.\n\nRubeus Hagrid – Robbie Coltrane\n\nThings have been quieter for Robbie Coltrane since Harry Potter ended, but he has still lent his voice and acting chops to a few projects since. He’s also kept up his role of Hagrid by filming the short that now plays before the new Wizarding World ride, “Hagrid’s Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure.”\n\nAlastor Moody – Brendan Gleeson\n\nGleeson has mostly stayed out of the big spotlight since Mad-Eye Moody’s death in Deathly Hallows: Part 1, but he’s been consistently busy, with multiple acting projects a year. Some of those projects include starring alongside one of his sons (and fellow Harry Potter actor), Domhnall Gleeson in Calvary, and more widely released films such as Edge of Tomorrow, In the Heart of the Sea, and Paddington 2. He’s also set to play Donald Trump in A Higher Loyalty, an adaption of James Comey’s book of the same name.\n\nDolores Umbridge – Imelda Staunton\n\nAfter a perfect performance as the villain you loved to hate, Imelda Staunton went on to star in multiple theatre roles in London in which she received 5 Olivier Award Nominations, including a win for her performance in Gypsy. She has also kept up appearances on the silver screen with roles in both Maleficent films, both Paddington films, and an appearance in the Downton Abbey movie, alongside her husband, and Downton Abbey star, Jim Carter.\n\nMrs Weasley – Julie Walters\n\nEveryone’s favorite Wizarding World mom ended her Harry Potter career on a high note. Molly Weasley survived the final film, and had one of the most iconic lines in the series, “Not my daughter, you bitch!” Unsurprisingly, Walters acting career never faltered post-HP. She continued to star in many UK-centric projects including The Hollow Crown, both Paddington films, Brooklyn, Mary Poppins Returns, as well as both Mamma Mia films.\n\nMr Weasley – Mark Williams\n\nMark Williams seems to have largely transitioned from the silver screen to the small screen. Post-Potter he had a couple of appearances on Being Human and Doctor Who, and has been keeping busy with the BBC series Father Brown, which will be on its ninth season early next year.\n\nNymphadora Tonks – Natalia Tena\n\nTonks may have been sidelined in the Harry Potter films more than we would have liked, but Natalia Tena did a wonderful job with what she had. Her talents did not go to waste, as she moved on to star in another hugely popular fantasy series, Game of Thrones. Tena also co-starred in Origins alongside a fellow Harry Potter cast member, Tom Felton. Unfortunately, Youtube did not pick up the show for a second season. Most recently she joined yet another massive franchise, having appeared in an episode of The Mandalorian on Disney+.\n\nKingsley Shacklebolt – George Harris\n\nIt’s been a while since you’ve heard this name. Harris’ most famous role was starring as Kingsley in the Harry Potter films, though he also had roles in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Black Hawk Down, and the 2011 Royal National Theatre adaptation of Frankenstein alongside Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller. Since Potter, Harris has kept a low profile.\n\nPeter Pettigrew – Timothy Spall\n\nA household name before and after Harry Potter, Timothy Spall has been in countless films and television shows over the course of his career. Since Deathly Hallows: Part 2 his most notable roles were in both Alice in Wonderland films alongside numerous other Harry Potter stars, as well as starring in Mr. Turner in which he was nominated for many Best Actor awards.\n\nNarcissa Malfoy – Helen McCrory\n\nOriginally cast to play Bellatrix, McCrory had to step down from the role due to pregnancy. Fortunately she had another chance to star in the Potter films, and was later cast as Narcissa Malfoy. McCrory’s continued to hit it big post-Potter, scoring major roles in Penny Dreadful and Peaky Blinders, as well as voicing Stelmaria in His Dark Materials\n\nProfessor Slughorn – Jim Broadbent\n\nJim Broadbent was a late edition to the Harry Potter cast, first appearing in Half-Blood Prince, but he certainly made his mark in a short time. The prominent roles continued after Potter, where Broadbent was cast in films such as The Iron Lady, Cloud Atlas, Brooklyn, the Paddington films, and a return as Dad in Bridget Jones’s Baby. He also managed to snag a role on Game of Thrones before the series’ end, as Archmaester Ebrose of the Citadel.\n\nProfessor Flitwick – Warwick Davis\n\nNever one to pump the brakes, Warwick Davis is keeping professionally. He’s had roles in multiple Star Wars properties following the release of Deathly Hallows: Part 2. Additionally, Davis still hasn’t completely shed Potter from his life. He’s been known to make appearances at various Harry Potter events, most recently at the opening of Hagrid’s Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure.\n\nProfessor Trelawney – Emma Thompson\n\nAfter her final appearance as Trelawney in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Emma Thompson has (unsurprisingly) had steady work in the film industry. She’s had plenty of acting roles like two Men in Black films, Beautiful Creatures (another book-to-film adaptation), voice acting roles in Brave and Dolittle, as well as writing credits for Bridget Jones’s Baby and Last Christmas. She also starred in Beauty and the Beast with fellow Harry Potter actress Emma Watson.\n\nGilderoy Lockhart – Kenneth Branagh\n\nIt’s been a long time since Branagh’s first and last Harry Potter appearance in 2002’s Chamber of Secrets. Since then he’s had plenty of acting and directing work in films, as well as starting his own theatre company, the Kenneth Branagh Theatre Company, where he would be actor and manager for five shows between October 2015 – November 2016. His plethora of acting roles include My Week With Marilyn, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, and Dunkirk; directing credits consisting of Cinderella, Murder on the Orient Express, and 2020’s book-to-film adaptation of Artemis Fowl.\n\nUncle Vernon – Richard Griffiths\n\nRichard Griffiths perfectly portrayed the narrow-minded, unsympathetic Vernon Dursley, right up until his last appearance in Deathly Hallows: Part 1. Before his passing in 2013, he also appeared in the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean film, On Stranger Tides, Hugo, and in The Hollow Crown, the BBC’s adaptation of Shakespeare’s historical tetralogy.\n\nAunt Petunia – Fiona Shaw\n\nThe matriarch of the Dursley family has had a noteworthy television career post-Potter. Fiona Shaw has starred in some of your favorite shows like True Blood and Killing Eve. She even made an appearance on Fleabag as the Counsellor.\n\nDudley Dursley – Harry Melling\n\nAfter playing the Dursley with the biggest redemption, Harry Melling has had appearances in a few notable titles. Most recently you’ll have seen Melling get put in his place by a polar bear in His Dark Materials, but he’s also appeared in The Ballad of Buster Scruggs on Netflix, The Lost City of Z, and The Musketeers.\n\nAunt Marge – Pam Ferris\n\nMost Harry Potter fans will know of Pam Ferris prior to her appearance as Aunt Marge in Prisoner of Azkaban. Ferris played the evil Trunchbull in the children’s classic Matilda back in 1996. Post-Potter, Pam Ferris had a 4-year run on Call the Midwife, and most recently had a role in Tolkien, the adaptation of the early years of Lord of the Rings author JRR Tolkien’s life.\n\nLily Potter – Geraldine Somerville\n\nGeraldine Somerville had a spattering of appearances throughout each Harry Potter film, and continued after Potter with a variety of roles. She recently appeared in The Gentlemen, Guy Ritchie’s latest film, alongside many Hollywood A-listers. She also had roles in My Week With Marilyn and The Riot Club, as well as in more British-centric projects like 2012’s Titanic, and 2017’s Prime Suspect 1973.\n\nJames Potter – Adrian Rawlins\n\nAdrian Rawlins may not have had a lot of screen time, but he does have the honor of being in all but one of the Harry Potter films, Half-Blood Prince. Since then he’s had numerous television roles including The White Princess and Chernobyl. He also had a role in The Woman in Black 2, the sequel to Daniel Radcliffe’s first film, alongside fellow Harry Potter actress Helen McCrory.\n\nMr Ollivander – John Hurt\n\nJohn Hurt is British acting royalty who unfortunately passed away in January 2017. He’s had roles in over 200 films and television shows, and has the unique honor of having played the most characters that have died on screen. He bookended the Harry Potter franchise, having appeared in the first and last films. Aside from Potter, his notable roles are truly countless. You name it, he’s been in it.\n\nArgus Filch – David Bradley\n\nDavid Bradley is another veteran actor who has the honor of having been in all but one Harry Potter film, the first Deathly Hallows. He’s been in many big name projects including The Strain, Doctor Who, Broadchurch, and playing one of the most hated characters in Game of Thrones. Most recently he played Ricky Gervais’ dad in After Life on Netflix, and he’s set to voice Geppetto in Guillermo Del Toro’s Pinocchio.\n\nCornelius Fudge – Robert Hardy\n\nAnother Harry Potter actor who sadly passed away in 2017 is Robert Hardy. His last Potter film was Order of the Phoenix. He also had roles in Sense and Sensibility with fellow Harry Potter actors Emma Thompson, Gemma Jones, and Alan Rickman; Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein with other Harry Potter actors Kenneth Branagh, Helena Bonham Carter, and John Cleese; Little Dorrit; and Lassie.\n\nRufus Scrimgeour – Bill Nighy\n\nNo doubt you’ve seen a movie with Bill Nighy in it. It’s a shame he only makes one appearance in the Harry Potter films, in Deathly Hallows: Part 1, but there are plenty of other great roles to see him in. Love Actually, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Underworld are just a few of his prominent film credits. Coming up, Nighy has Minamata with Johnny Depp, and right now you can see him in the latest iteration of Jane Austen’s Emma.\n\nProfessor Sprout – Miriam Margolyes\n\nThe perfectly portrayed Pomona Sprout has had an illustrious career in film, television, and theatre. Aside from two appearances in the Harry Potter films, Margolyes has most recently appeared in season 8 and 9 of Call the Midwife, and in 2019 played Miss Shepherd in a production of Lady in the Van. Interestingly, the 2015 film version starred Margolyes’ fellow Potter professor, Maggie Smith.\n\nProfessor Quirrell – Ian Hart\n\nAll the way back in The Sorcerer’s Stone, Ian Hart played the first Potter villain. Since that role in 2001, Hart has been in many recognizable television series including Bates Motel, The Bridge, Boardwalk Empire, My Mad Fat Diary, and The Terror. Most recently he’s been featured in Netflix’s The Last Kingdom, as well as Mary Queen of Scots.\n\nOther Harry Potter Cast Members\n\nMadame Pomfrey – Gemma Jones\n\nThe Fat Lady – Elizabeth Spriggs/Dawn French\n\nMadame Hooch – Zoë Wanamaker\n\nDobby – Toby Jones\n\nMoaning Myrtle – Shirley Henderson\n\nNearly Headless Nick – John Cleese\n\nGriphook – Vern Troyer/Warwick Davies\n\nBill Weasley – Domhnall Gleeson\n\nScabior – Nick Moran\n\nXenophilius Lovegood – Rhys Ifans\n\nKreacher – Timothy Bateson/Simon McBurney\n\nAberforth Dumbledore – Ciarán Hinds\n\nHelena Ravenclaw – Kelly McDonald\n\nMundungus Fletcher – Andy Linden\n\nElphias Doge – David Ryall\n\nAuntie Muriel – Matyelok Gibbs\n\nAlbert Runcorn – David O’Hara\n\nReg Cattermole – Steffan Rhodri\n\nMafalda Hopkirk – Sophie Thompson\n\nMary Cattermole – Kate Fleetwood\n\nMadame Rosmerta – Julie Christie\n\nRita Skeeter – Miranda Richardson\n\nBathilda Bagshot – Hazel Douglas\n\nBarty Crouch – Roger Lloyd Pack\n\nBarty Crouch Jr. – David Tennant\n\nMadame Maxime – Frances de la Tour\n\nIgor Karkaroff – Pedja Bjelac\n\nYaxley – Peter Mullan\n\nFenrir Greyback – Dave Legeno\n\nAmos Diggory – Jeff Rawle\n\nPius Thicknesse – Guy Henry\n\nCharity Burbage – Carolyn Pickles\n\nMr Granger – Ian Kelly\n\nMrs Granger – Michelle Fairley\n\nMrs Figg – Kathryn Hunter\n\nBogrod – Jon Key\n\nAmelia Bones – Sian Thomas\n\nGregorovitch – Rade Serbedzija\n\nYoung Gellert Grindelwald – Jamie Campbell Bower\n\nOld Gellert Grindelwald – Michael Byrne\n\nStan Shunpike – Lee Ingleby\n\nShrunken Head – Lenny Henry\n\nErnie Prang – Jimmy Gardner\n\nFrank Bryce – Eric Sykes\n\nGrawp – Tony Maudsley\n\nAragog – Julian Glover\n\nWeird Sisters – Jarvis Cocker, Jonny Greenwood, Philip Selway, Steve Mackey, Jason Buckle, Steve Claydon\n\nLondon Underground Waitress – Elarica Gallacher\n\nMrs Cole – Amelda Brown\n\nDawlish – Richard Leaf\n\nThe Executioner (Walden Macnair) – Peter Best\n\nAntonin Dolohov – Arben Bajraktaraj\n\nThorfinn Rowle – Rod Hunt\n\nAlecto Carrow – Suzanne Toase\n\nAmycus Carrow – Ralph Ineson\n\nAriana Dumbledore – Hebe Beardsall\n\nTom the Innkeeper – Derek Deadman/ Jim Tavare\n\nYoung Witch Maid – Abby Ford\n\nMr Mason – Jim Norton\n\nMrs Mason – Veronica Clifford\n\nAstoria Malfoy – Jade Gordon\n\nSir Cadogan – Paul Whitehouse\n\nMafalda Hopkirk – Jessica Stevenson\n\nThe Sorting Hat – Leslie Phillips\n\n“Barman” (Aberforth Dumbledore) – Jim McManus\n\nMr Borgin – Edward Tudor Pole\n\n‘Harry Potter’ Cast Members: The Flashback Actors\n\nThe following Harry Potter cast members appeared in key scenes that helped illustrate important backstories.\n\nBaby Harry – Saunders Triplets/Toby Papworth\n\nYoung Lily Evans – Ellie Darcey-Alden\n\nYoung Petunia Evans – Ariella Paradise\n\nYoung Severus Snape – Benedict Clarke\n\nYoung James Potter – Alfie McIlwain\n\nYoung Sirius Black – Rohan Gotobed\n\nTeenage Severus Snape – Alec Hopkins\n\nTeenage James Potter – Robert Jarvis\n\nTeenage Sirius Black – James Walters\n\nTeenage Peter Pettigrew – Charles Hughes\n\nTeenage Remus Lupin – James Utechin\n\nYoung Hagrid – Martin Bayfield\n\nAnd in the ‘Deathly Hallows’ epilogue…\n\nThe following Harry Potter cast members appeared in the “19 Years Later” section of Deathly Hallows, Part 2, showing Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco sending their children off to Hogwarts.\n\nAlbus Severus Potter – Arthur Bowen\n\nLily Luna Potter – Daphne de Beistegui\n\nJames Sirius Potter – William Dunn\n\nScorpius Malfoy – Bertie Gilbert\n\nRose Weasley – Helena Barlow\n\nHugo Weasley – Ryan Turner\n\nWho are your favorite ‘Harry Potter’ cast members from the movies and those that you continue to follow?"
