Our home is full of love with our three daughters and we couldn’t be happier.\"\n\nHefner added on Twitter: \"Scarlett and I are overjoyed to share that we welcomed Marigold Adele Hefner and Blossom Pearl Hefner into the world on Saturday, March 26th. Today, we are settling back in at home. How blessed we are to be gifted with their life. How lucky we are to be given this love.\"\n\nRead more: Harry Potter's Jessie Cave welcomes fourth child with surprise inspiration behind name\n\nEllie Darcey-Alden — who played a young Lily Potter in the films — was among those to share their congratulations on social media.\n\nShe wrote: “So proud of you Scarlett! Those girls are so lucky to have you.”\n\nThe couple - who married in 2019 - welcomed their first child, another daughter named Betsy in 2020.\n\nHefner and Byrne – who have been dating since August 2015 – tied the knot at a registry office in Ventura, California, in November 2019.\n\nByrne — who made her debut in the sixth movie in the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince in 2009 — posed nude for Playboy magazine in February 2017.\n\nIn 2018, she joined Harry Potter co-star Evanna Lynch on Dancing With The Stars for the trios dance.\n\nCooper is the youngest of the late Hugh Hefner’s four children. He has a brother Marston, who is just one year older than him, who the Playboy mogul fathered with second wife Kimberley Conrad.\n\nHe also has a half-sister Christie, 68, and 66-year-old half-brother David, who Hef had with his first wife Millie Williams.\n\nCooper is a businessman and was previously the chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprises. In July he announced he is running as a Democrat for the California Senate.\n\nRead more: Harry Potter's Bonnie Wright marries boyfriend Andrew Lococo\n\nHugh Hefner died in 2017 aged 91, leaving behind an estimated $50m fortune and a business empire based around the Playboy brand."
