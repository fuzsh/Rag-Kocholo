        "text": "The Devil's Stone, the latest film from Willington's Dean Midas, received its first showing at the Odeon Luxe cinema in Durham last night (Thursday, October 12), ahead of it's release on YouTube today - Friday the 13th.\n\nAmong the cast, crew and supporters who attended the premiere was actress Ellie Darcey-Alden - who played Lily Potter in Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2 and appeared in a Doctor Who Christmas special.\n\nIn Mr Midas's film, she plays Maria, a conspiracy theorist researching the legend of The Devil's Stone, a real feature outside the council offices in Crook, County Durham.\n\nIt is called The Devil’s Stone because it is said if you run seven times around it, the devil himself will appear and is the central theme of the film.\n\nMiss Darcey-Alden is one of a number of familiar names from the horror genre Mr Midas persuaded to record a cameo in the film.\n\nIt also features Roger L Jackson - the voice of Ghostface in the Scream franchise - and Dick Warlock, who portrayed Micheal Myers in Halloween 2.\n\nMr Midas has made a number of other horror shorts, featuring his characters Rag Dolly and Eve Valentine, but feels this is his best film yet.\n\nHe said: \"I was a bit nervous before the premiere because The Devil's Stone is a legend in my area so I had to be really careful because the locals wouldn't like it if I didn't do a good job.\n\n\"But the feedback so far has been 100 per cent positive. Everyone has said it's my best one yet.\"\n\nThe low-budget horror was filmed in locations across County Durham, including The Witham community arts centre in Barnard Castle, the Park Head Hotel in Bishop Auckland and the Blue Stone Tea Shop in Crook.\n\nMr Midas said persuading so many big names to appear has been a bonus, especially Miss Darcey-Alden.\n\n\"From the first time I spoke to her, she has completely embraced the project,\" said Mr Midas.\n\n\"I told her I didn't want to disrespect myself, but I don't have a Harry Potter or a Doctor Who budget - she said she'd seen I have a passion for this.\"\n\nMr Midas said he was grateful to all those who had agreed to contribute, adding: \"They realise that everybody needs help and a bit of assistance because it's a big industry and it's a hard industry.\n\nRead more:\n\nHarry Potter and Doctor Who actress joins cast of new County Durham horror film\n\nThe voice of Ghostface is added to the cast of new County Durham horror film\n\nShooting begins on County Durham horror short - due for release on Friday the 13th\n\nOFFER: Click here to get more from The Northern Echo with a Premium Plus digital subscription - £5 for 5 months until October 18.\n\n\"It's good for any upcoming filmmakers as well. I'm no whippersnapper, but for anyone coming, they might think 'wow' and it could help encourage them in the future.\"\n\nThe Devil's Stone introduces the character of Sayer Hicks, played by Wayne Thompson, and Mr Midas says if his latest effort is a success, the mask-wearing Hicks could feature in future films - maybe as part of a new franchise."
