        "text": "On the planet Skaro, the Doctor looks out at the ruins. Why has he been brought to this, the home planet of the Daleks? In no time at all, he is reunited with Amy and Rory and they are brought before the Parliament of the Daleks. Expecting to be exterminated, the Doctor is surprised when the Daleks ask for his help.\n\nThere is a legend of a planet, a place where insane Daleks are kept. Despite everything, it appears that the Daleks don't or cannot destroy those of their number who become insane. Now, a ship has crashed on the asylum planet. Somehow it has breached the asylum's forcefield. If something can get in, then it is possible that something may get out. The Daleks want their sole predator, the Doctor, to help them destroy the asylum before anything does escape...\n\nA cyborg gunslinger destroys a drone and closes in on Kahler-Mas. The gunslinger offers him the chance to make peace with his gods and Kahler-Mas reaches for his weapon. Shooting Kahler-Mas, the gunslinger reveals that there is one more person he has left to kill: the Doctor!\n\nThe Doctor, Amy and Rory are standing outside the town of Mercy, population 81. Surrounding the town is a boundary made of wood and stone. A scan with the sonic screwdriver reveals that the boundary is indeed made of wood and stone - no force fields or anything starnge. Stepping over the boundary, the three travellers enter the town. They can see people keeping to the shadows and lurking indoors. Sparks from an electric lamp result in the Doctor stating, \"Anachronistic electricity, keep out signs, aggresive stares! Has someone been peeking at my Christmas list?\"\n\nVenturing into the saloon the Doctor orders a strong tea. When the preacher asks who he is and the Doctor replies, the other people in the saloon stand up. When someone else asks if he is an alien and the Doctor confirms it, he soon finds himself being carried out of the town and dumped outside the boundary, evidently to be left to the mercy of whatever the town fears...\n\nSam Garner works in New York City, and his latest job is for a man known as Grayle. Grayle has told him of statues; living statues, statues that move in the dark. Garner agress to take the case, though Grayle can tell that he doesn't believe him when he talks about living statues, about statues that move when you are aren't looking. Arriving at the apartment block at an address given to him by Grale, Garner understands that Winter Quay is supposed to be where the statues live. Now Grayle is the scariest guy Garner knows, but anything that scares Grayle - he wants to shake his hand. The doors open for him and when he enters the block Garner is greeted by just silence...and the arrival of the elevator. One the floor he gets out at, Garner walks along until he spots a name tag on one of the rooms - \"S Garner\". Inside the apartment he finds a wallet containing his own ID, albeit older. Further inside, he finds an old man, dying, who claims to be him. Leaving the room, Garner finds himself being hemmed in by statues...\n\nIn present day New York City, the Doctor is reading a book out loud, much to the annoyance of Amy. As the conversation turns to why Amy is wearing glasses, Rory decides it might be a good time to go and buy some coffee. Amy asks the Doctor to go back to reading the book, as long as he does not say \"yowzah!\". The Doctor tears out the last page, citing that the book won't end and he doesn't like endings. Reading the book it suddenly becomes clear that they are reading about Rory! It is evident that there is only one way that Rory could have ended up in New York City in April 1938...\n\nIn the winter of 1842, a young boy called Walter is building a snowman, by himself. He ignores the other children playing in the snow and the pleading of his mother to go join them or even talk to them. As his mother walks away, Walter says that he doesn't want to talk to them because they are so silly. A voice echoes that sentiment. Walter begins to run away but the voice speaks again \"don't need anyone else.\" Walter stops and begins to walk back towards the snowman. \"I can help you,\" it says. \"How?\" asks the boy.\n\nFifty years later Dr Simeon watches as samples of snow are collected from snowmen. He takes a jar into his laboratory, to a sphere containing some snow. \"The great swarm is approaching. So as humanity celebrates, so shall it end,\" booms the voice of the snow. Simeon assures the voice that he will take care of the men who helped tonight - he has promised to feed them. Sure enough, when Simeon emerges onto the balcony and looks down upon the men he carries out his promise...\n\nAt the Rose and Crown pub, Clara is going outside when a snowman appears. She asks a passing man if he made the snowman, his answer is simply \"no\". When Clara comments that it wasn't there a second ago, that it just appeared, the man turns back to have a look. Intrigued by the things the man says, Clara follows him just missing him climbing into a stagecoach. Jumping onto it, she hears the man being called the Doctor...\n\nWherever you are, at home, on a train, in a cafe and you see the wi fi...well, some people have appeared to collapse and then die later. Sometimes you can here voices in the wi fi, crying out, wondering where they are. So, when you see the wi fi symbol and strange symbols next to it...don't click on it.\n\nA young woman is having problems connecting to the internet so she uses a telephone number given to her to contact a helpdesk. The man at the other end is not very happy to be interrupted for such a trivial query - but when he hears the woman at the other end try to come up with a suitable nemonic for her password, he realises that the woman is Clara Oswald. Satisfied that she is now able to gain access to the internet, Clara found a wi fi connection that appears to work, she responds to noises downstairs and finds a strange man, dressed as a monk, at her front door. Identifying himself as the Doctor, the man seems very pleased to see Clara. It soon turns out that someone, or rather something else is also pleased to find Clara. It appears that something exists in the wi fi...\n\nA young man is walking along, intent with his own affairs. A leaf blows into his face and just as he is about to walk in front of a bus...a woman saves him. Years later, their daughter sits on the stairs waiting to see if a mysterious man will fulfil his promise. Sure enough, the Doctor arrives and asks her where she would like to go, anywhere in time and space? Clara finds herself stumped for an answer and decides that she wants to see something amazing. So the Doctor takes her to see the Rings of Akhaten.\n\nWandering around the bazaar, waiting for the ceremony to mark the alignment at the Rings, Clara spots a frightened girl, trying to hide from some people. Hiding with the girl, Clara tries to find out what she is fraid of and perhaps offer a way to help her.\n\nThe van Baalen brothers trail through space searching for salvage. An alarm alerts them to potential profit for validation - though initially it appears to be nothing of value. Tricky comments that its a waste of their time - there is no salvage this far out. Bram remarks that Tricky is lucky - androids don't get bored. Tricky reminds him that Gregor won't go back with half a cargo, he will stay out here until he finds something of value.\n\nThe Doctor tries to convince Clara that the TARDIS does not dislike her and decides that he will set the ship to basic mode. As a consequence the TARDIS is spotted by the van Baalen's ship and the magno-grab is activated, drawing it inside. The Doctor is concerned that Clara is trapped inside the TARDIS somewhere and he must convince the salvage team to venture inside to help find her. However, something else appears to be lurking within the interior of the ship...\n\nSomewhere near Bradford towards the end of the 19th century, Edmund is determined to uncover the mystery at the heart of Sweetville: a community set up by Mrs Gillyflower as a last stand against the oncoming judgment. His wife begs him not to go but he ventures through a door into the heart of the factory. Mrs Gillyflower arrives and extends her condolences...and a scream is heard from beyond the door.\n\nEdmund's brother is visiting the mortuary - and is horrified to find that the corpse is bright crimson. Nor is he the first body that has been found in such a state. Concerned at what is happening he takes photographs of his brother's eyes, believing firmly that they retain the image of the last thing they see. These photographs are presented to Madame Vastra and Jenny, and they conclude that they must travel north to Yorkshire. The blown-up image from the eyes clearly shows the Doctor...\n\nThe Doctor brings Clara, Angie and Artie to Hedgewick's World: the greatest amusement park in the universe. Or, at least it was. Now it has fallen into disrepair. Impressario Webley greets the travellers, hoping that they have come to take him away from this planet. A small platoon arrives demanding to know why they are there. Using his psychic paper the Doctor moves the platoon on so that he, Clara and the children can enjoy what the park has to offer. Noting their interest in what entertainment the park still has to offer, Webley asks if any of them are good at chess? The Doctor enthusiastically tries to volunteer, but Webley notes Artie's interest and invites the boy to try and beat his special chess player. Bringing them through to the parlour, Webley builds up his player and unveils...a Cyberman.\n\nMadame Vastra visits Clarence De Marco in prison. He informs her that he wants to make a deal that will save him from the hangman. Vastra initially states that there is nothing he can say that will allow her to agree to such a deal. Then Clarence mentions \"the Doctor\" and that his secret is discovered.\n\nMadame Vastra and Jenny enter a special sleep: the start of a conference call across time and space. Strax then Clara become members of the conference and, finally, River Song. As they discuss the revelations and how they can help the Doctor, Jenny becomes aware of something. She realises that she forgot to lock the door...and now something has entered the house. Something is in the room with them...and then she disappears from the conference. Either Jenny has been awoken or she has been killed. The Whisper Men have arrived and Clara must return to wakefulness and warn the Doctor. Somehow she must help him - but it appears that the only way the Doctor can help Jenny, Vastra and Strax is by going to the planet of Trenzalore...\n\nThe Doctor and Clara are minding their own business when the TARDIS starts moving, and not of its own accord. Kate Stewart advises the Doctor that she has retrieved the TARDIS and arranged for it to be flown direct to the scene of an incident. She had not realised anyone was still on board! Arriving at the Nation Gallery, the Doctor is presented with a message from Queen Elizabeth the first and told that credentials confirming the letter are inside the gallery. Both the Doctor and Clara are astonished to find that the Queen's credentials are a Gallifreyan picture named \"No More\" and also known as \"Gallifrey Falls\". Like other Gallifreyan technology it is bigger on the inside than on the outside and displays an image of the destruction of Arcadia, Gallifrey's second city. It is something the Doctor remembers well...\n\nThe previous incarnation of the Doctor is enjoying a picnic with Queen Elizabeth the first. He even proposes marriage to her, but when she accepts the Doctor takes this as confirmation that she is not the Queen, but a Zygon instead. The Zygons, their world destroyed have come to earth to make it their world. Unfortunately its not advanced enough for them and so they intend to use Time Lord technology to put themselves into stasis until the time is right to emerge and conquer Earth.\n\nOn the last day of the Time War, armies of Daleks are destroying the planet piece by piece. Gallifreyans try to escape the carnage and a family find themselves surrounded by Daleks. Then something else gets the Daleks' attention - they had detected their oldest enemy, the Doctor. The Doctor leaves a message for Time Lord and Daleks alike: \"No More\" - the universe is at stake and it is time for the war to end. Stealing an ancient Gallifreyan artefact from the Omega Vaults, the Doctor finds a quiet place to activate it. The Moment: the most powerful and the most terrifying weapon devised by the ancients. There is a story that it developed a conscience. The Time Lord who once called himself the Doctor believes he no longer has the right to that name - and the time has come to sacrifice all the Time Lords and all of the Daleks for the good of the rest of the universe.\n\nOn a quiet planet a message is transmitted throughout the universe. Various races: Daleks; Cybermen; Sontarans; and many more converge on the planet but go no further. No-one can translate the message, not even the Doctor, also in orbit around the planet. A call from Clara barely distracts the Doctor from trying to find out more about the planet below. While the information stored in the head of a Cybermen gets to work on the message, the Doctor speaks to Clara. It is Christmas and she is at home with her gran, her dad and his girlfriend. For some reason she has informed them that her boyfriend is also coming to dinner - so the Doctor must return and pretend to be her boyfriend. Additionally, any assistance he can provide in relation to cooking the turkey perfectly would be greatly appreciated. So, storing the turkey within the console area, the Doctor and Clara travel back to the planet. When the Cyberhead identifies the planet of origin of the message, the Doctor finds it hard to believe.\n\nA meeting with Tasha Lem, mother superious of the Church of the Papal Mainframe has been arranged to enable the Doctor to get down to the planet. The Papal Mainframe arrived first and put up a shield around the planet in order to protect it. The message also seems to generate a fear response and this is one of the reasons why all the orbiting ships are waiting. Tasha agrees to transport the Doctor down to the planet: he has one hour to locate the source of the message and decipher it. Taking Clara with him, the Doctor is surprised when he finds himself unable to tell the locals his cover story. Instead, he speaks the truth. None can lie on the planet known as Christmas..."
