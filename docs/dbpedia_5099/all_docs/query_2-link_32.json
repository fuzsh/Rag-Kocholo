        "text": "Hi there! Welcome to the LeakyCon Sched.org! Please note, that signing up for this site or indicating which sessions you will be at is not at all required. You cannot reserve a seat to a session on this site; if a session looks \"full\" it’s only because we input the capacity of the rooms. All sessions at LeakyCon are first-come first-serve except for the autograph and photo-booth sessions that indicate otherwise. Lit programming may still only be attended by those who have a Lit badge (these are now sold out). Again: you do not have to sign up for this site or use it in any way in order to go to any event at LeakyCon. it’s a way for you to find other people who are interested in the same things you are, and a way for you to show your friends on Facebook, Twitter, and beyond what you’re interested in at the conference. But it is not in ANY way a ticketing system. We hope you enjoy surfing the schedule!\n\nSign up or log in to bookmark your favorites and sync them to your phone or calendar.\n\nMainStage clear filter\n\n5:00pm PDT\n\nOpening Ceremony\n\nEvery year we open LeakyCon in our own crazed wizardly way.
