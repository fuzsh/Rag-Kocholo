        "text": "The Making of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2\n\nCast\n\nThe Trio\n\nHarry Potter is played by Daniel Radcliffe.\n\nHermione Granger is played by Emma Watson.\n\nRon Weasley is played by Rupert Grint.\n\nThe Weasley’s\n\nArthur Weasley is played by Mark Williams and Molly Weasley is played by Julie Walters.\n\nGinny Weasley is played by Bonnie Wright, Fred and George are played by James and Oliver Phelps. If you want to tell them apart, Oliver has got a mole on the side of his neck. Percy is played by Chris Rankin, Bill is played by Domhnall Gleeson, the son of Mad-Eye Moody actor Brendan Gleeson, and his wife Fleur Weasley is played by Clemence Poesy.\n\nHogwarts Students\n\nNeville Longbottom is played by Matthew Lewis, Seamus Finnigan is played by Devon Murray and Dean Thomas is played by Alfred Enoch. Romilda Vane is played by Anna Shafer, Katie Bell is played by Georgina Leonidas and Leanne is played by Isabella Laughland. Lavender Brown is played by Jessie Cave, Padma Patil is played by Afsha Azad and Cormac McLaggen is played by Freddie Stroma. Cho Chang is played by Katie Leung and Luna Lovegood is played by Evanna Lynch\n\nGoyle is played by Josh Herdman, Blaise Zabini is played by Louis Cordice and Pansy Parkinson is played by Scarlett Byrne.\n\nOne actor who doesn’t appear is Jamie Waylett who since the first potter film has played Crabbe. Before filming took place in early April, Jamie and another man were found in possession of cannabis. It was also discovered that Jamie was growing cannabis at his mother home, Jamie has said they weren’t to sell, only for his own personal use. He was sentenced to 120 hours of community service. In 2012 Jamie went on to take a small part in the London riots in London. He drank stolen champagne and carried a bomb device.\n\nHogwarts Teachers\n\nProfessor Flitwick is played by Warwick Davis. Warwick also plays Griphook, the goblin. It took 4 hours every day to put all of the prosthetic make up on to turn from Warwick to Griphook.\n\nMinerva McGonagall is played by Maggie Smith.\n\nProfessor Slughorn is played by Jim Broadbent.\n\nProfessor Sprout is played by Miriam Margolyes.\n\nMadame Pomfrey was played by Gemma Jones.\n\nSybil Trelawney is played by Emma Thompson.\n\nOrder of the Phoenix Members\n\nKingsley Shaklebolt is played by George Harris.\n\nRemus Lupin is played by David Thewlis and his wife Tonks is played by Natalie Tena.\n\nHagrid is played by Robbie Coltrane and Sirius Black is played by Gary Oldman.\n\nDeath Eaters\n\nSeverus Snape is played by Alan Rickman.\n\nDraco Malfoy is played by Tom Felton, his father, Lucius Malfoy is played by Jason Isaacs and his mother, Narcissa Malfoy is played by Helen McCrory.\n\nBellatrix Lestrange is played by Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nScabior is played by Nick Moran and Fenrir Greyback is played by Dave Legeno. In Half Blood Prince, Fenrir has prosthetic make up on around 50% of his face, in this film, his entire face is covered apart from a portion of his lips and the whites of his eyes, although he is still wearing contact lenses. This decision was made to show how much more feral he is becoming.\n\nDave’s other job apart from being part human, part werewolf is a cage fighter. Dave has since passed away due to heat stroke while he was hiking in California.\n\nWormtail is played by Timothy Spall. Wormtail only appears for a second in a flashback scene.\n\nPius Thicknesse is played by Guy Henry, Alecto Carrow is played by Suzanne Toase and Amycus Carrow is played by Ralph Ineson.\n\nLord Voldermort is played by Ralph Fiennes.\n\nWith each destruction of the Horcruxes, Voldemort looks that little bit more broken and bruised, showing how the lack of Horcruxes is slowly making himself mortal.\n\nOther\n\nLily and James Potter are played by Geraldine Somerville and Adrian Rawlins and baby Harry is played by Toby Papworth.\n\nBogrod is played by Jon Key.\n\nHelena Ravenclaw is played by Kelly MacDonald. The role was reportedly offered to Kate Winslet, but her manager made the decision herself to turn down the role as she didn’t feel as though Kate would want to be in something as common as the Harry Potter franchise.\n\nAberforth Dumbledore is played by Ciarán Hinds, his sister, Ariana Dumbledore is played by Hebe Beadsall.\n\nDumbledore is played by Michael Gambon.\n\nOlivander is played by John Hurt.\n\nDevelopment\n\nIt wasn’t always assumed that the final book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows would be split into two films, but when the script was over 500 pages long, and the estimated run time was over 5 hours, they decided that they had no choice but to split the book into two films.\n\nThis was the only film in the franchise to be released in 3D. It was filmed in 2D because they didn’t get the go ahead on it being in 3D until Avatar was released in 3D half way through filming Deathly Hallows, and they realised how many people would be enticed to watch a film if it was in 3D. filming. The film was converted into 3D and released in both IMAX 3D and 2D.\n\nGringotts\n\n210,000 coins were made for the scene inside of the Lestranges vault.\n\nHufflepuffs cup was made out of a soft pewter material and then painted gold.\n\nThe majority of the items that fill up the Lestranges vault are made of rubber because rubber is easier to mass producer and safer for the actors to work with.\n\nAlthough the Goblins are on screen for under 10 minutes, each of the goblins looks were designed and planned out months in advance, the absolute best makeup artists were brought in and each hair on the goblins was put in by hand one by one to make sure they looked authentic.\n\nThe Room of Requirement\n\nThe Room of Requirement is made out of props from other the other films in the series, which is why you can find a lot of easter eggs from other films in the franchise. For example Gilderoy Lockhart dumped the Cornish Pixies in there after his disastrous Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson back in Harry’s second year at Hogwarts. There are in fact around 2000 chairs. You can find lamps from Slughorn’s Christmas party, chess pieces from the Philosophers stone and much more.\n\nIn the scene where Harry Ron and Hermione are all on brooms racing away from the Fiendfyre, to make the brooms more comfortable for Ron and Hermione (Rupert and Emma) casts were made of their bottoms so that bicycle seats could be attached to the brooms to make them easier to sit on.\n\nIn the Room of Requirement Draco turns up saying that he has been using his mothers wand, however it is clearly seen in the previous film that Dobby steals Draco’s mothers wand.\n\nThe Kiss\n\nEmma and Rupert were told about that they would be filming the kiss the day before it happened. It was filming in what looks like the Chamber of Secrets, but the only part of that set that was built was the floor. The special effects were able to use enough footage filmed from Chamber of Secrets to make it look like Ron and Hermione were really there.\n\nBother Rupert and Emma said it was a bit of an awkward moment because they see each other more as like siblings.\n\nThe kiss between Ginny and Harry on the stairs was very spontaneous, it wasn’t written into the script, Dan just thought that it would be an appropriate place to put in a kiss, seeing as they may never see each other again.\n\nThe Pensieve\n\nYoung Lily Potter in the pensieve was played by Ellie Darcey Alden and young Snape is played by Benedict Clarke.\n\nYoung Petunia Dursley is played by Ariella Paradise\n\nA lot of creative liberties were made with the scene in which Harry looks into the memories of Severus Snape. For example Snape would have never seen Lily saying goodbye to Harry moments before she’s killed.\n\nThe Battle at Hogwarts\n\nThe Battle at Hogwarts began with the fight between Minerva McGonagall and Severus Snape. It was planned that Harry was going to take over from McGonagall, however JK Rowling put a stop to that because she wanted this to be McGonagall’s moment.\n\nAlso during this fight McGonagall fires the Avada Kadavra curse towards Snape, but he deflects it and aims it towards the Carrows, two death eaters watching over Hogwarts. Snape could have sent the curse towards the students of Hogwarts or one of the many other professors but he didn’t he aimed them at the death eaters as a nod to his true alliance.\n\nIn the scene where Voldemort gives Draco a hug, this was completely unscripted and showed Tom Felton’s/Draco’s real reaction. This scene was filmed several times and each time Voldemort acted differently because he wanted to shock the audience around him so it would look like they were all scared of him.\n\nMolly was written in to the story to defeat Bellatrix Lestrange because a reader of the series once mentioned to JK Rowling that she didn’t think Molly would be much use in the battle because she is stay at home mum. This allowed Julie Walters (Molly Weasley) to deliver her most favourite line ever “Not my daughter you bitch!”\n\nBoth Helena and Julie (Bellatrix and Molly) had to go for physiotherapy after filming there fight scene because of all the movement and work they needed to do. Bella further injured herself during a take by falling off the end of the table she was walking on, luckily she had the smarts to ask for someone to stand at the end to catch her, which they did.\n\nSean Biggerstaff who played Oliver wood the first two films returns to lead an aerial assault on the death eaters. He is the one that shouts “Come on”.\n\nDeleted Scenes\n\nThere is a deleted scene where Ron, Harry and Hermione are in Shell cottage contemplating breaking into Gringotts and Ron asks how they will know which item in the Lestrange vault is the Horcrux. The scene ends with Bill warning the trip not to trust Griphook.\n\nAnother deleted scene shows Luna comforting Harry at Dobby’s grave before she leaves to return to Hogwarts. In the same scene Harry tells Ron that he thinks he’s seeing Dumbledore in the mirror before Hermione enters dressed as Bellatrix.\n\nThe scene where Ron, Harry and Hermione converse with Aberforth was cut short. In the deleted scene Aberforth warns Harry about not continuing Dumbledore’s mission.\n\nA deleted scene at Hogwarts showed the student marching down the stairs with a concealed Harry in the middle of them.\n\nA further deleted scene showed Seamus and other Hogwarts students putting the explosive devices on the bridge.\n\nA scene where Tonks runs into the loving arms of Remus at Hogwarts just before the battle was cut. In this scene we would have learnt that Tonks had given to birth to a boy named Teddy and was sleeping at home, safe and sound.\n\nA scene of Argus Filch locking up the Slytherins in the dungeons was cut out rather sadly as it showed them escaping out by use of explosion. However the scene also shows Draco apparating into the school, which isn’t actually possible as Hermione points out to repeatedly in the books.\n\n19 Years Later\n\nAlbus Severus Potter is played by Arthur Bowen. Surprisingly this isn’t his only role in a Harry Potter film. He can be seen in Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. He is in the Diagon Alley scene collecting nuts into a paper bag that have just been warmed by a fire breathing dragon.\n\nLily Potter, Harry and Ginny’s daughter is played by Daphne de Beistegui.\n\nJames Potter, Harry and Ginny’s son is played by Will Dunn.\n\nBoth Bonnie (Ginny) and Rupert (Ron) had to wear padded suits to make it look like they had put on weight in their older years.\n\nAstoria Malfoy is played by Jade Gordon, Tom Felton’s (Draco’s) real life girl friend.\n\nScorpius Malfoy is played by Bertie Gilbert.\n\nRose Weasley is played by Helena Barlow\n\nHugo Weasley is played by Ryan Turner.\n\nLondon Premiere\n\nThis is the last film of the Harry Potter series and so for the London premiere which took place on 7th July in Trafalgar Square. It was the largest premiere that the UK has ever seen. Some people waited for 4 days for a chance to see some of the stars of the film arrive. They expected 18 thousand people to turn up.\n\nFor the people who didn’t camp out, Sky put out a TV release and a 3D release! When the premiere was being filmed live it was sent out to 18 cinemas for people to watch live at the cinema.\n\nOne mistake they did make during the premiere was that the narrator Craig Stevens called Luna Lovegood, Luna Lovejoy.\n\nLucius admitted that that he hit his son with his cane a little too hard in their first film together during an interview at the premiere. It was also revealed that secret escapes were built into the walls of the great hall for fire safety.\n\nThe End\n\nHere end the end of my The Making of Harry Potter and the…. Series. I have covered all the films in the series and I just want to take a moment to say I’ve loved it. They are some of my most viewed blogs and they have been so worthwhile to create because I’ve learnt so much about a world I already love."
