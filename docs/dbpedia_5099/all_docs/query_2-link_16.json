        "text": "The wizards and witches behind MISTI-Con, the Harry Potter fan convention coming to Laconia, NH this May, are excited to announce the addition of two very special guests: Ellie and Joseph Darcey-Alden. Fans will no doubt remember Ellie from her performance as young Lily Evans in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, seen during Snape’s “The Prince’s Tale” memory sequence. What they may not realize is that she and her brother Joseph had the amazing opportunity to star in 2012’s Doctor Who Christmas special “The Snowmen,” which was recently shown in the UK and US. Playing Francesca and Digby, respectively, Ellie and Joseph got to be a part of the Doctor’s first meeting with his new companion Clara, a landmark episode.\n\nThis will mark the first time a Harry Potter conference features a special guest who has been a part of both the Harry Potter and Doctor Who universes on screen. In this regard, Ellie joins such illustrious talent as David Tennant, Michael Gambon, John Cleese, Helen McCrory, Bill Nighy, Toby Jones and Zoë Wanamaker, to name a few. Her credits include stints on BBC’s Robin Hood and Holby City, as well as the upcoming film Welcome to the Punch, while her brother was seen in I Spy and the short film Pranks.\n\nEllie, thirteen, made her debut in 2007 in the Oxford Christmas Panto. Harry Potter has been a big part of her life, and her acting dreams came true when David Yates asked her to play Lily, an experience that she will cherish forever. She was particularly pleased to work with her brother Joseph alongside Matt Smith and Jenna-Louise Coleman this past year in Doctor Who. While dancing and drama take up most of her time, she is also learning to play piano and attending karate classes with Joseph, where she has worked very hard for her blue belt. Ellie loves animals and adores her family’s Cocker Spaniel, Lola.\n\nIn addition to acting, Joseph, ten, has a particular talent for tap dancing and has earned the title of BDTA All-England Junior Champion for the last three years. With his other film, theater, and television credits, he became the envy of all his friends when he worked on the Doctor Who 2012 Christmas special. Like his sister, he loves their dog Lola, is learning piano, and has just earned a blue belt in karate.\n\nYou can see Hi-Res photos of Ellie and Joseph right here:\n\nEllie Darcey-Alden\n\nJoseph Darcey-Alden\n\nThe two performers will be appearing at MISTI-Con with planned signings and photo opportunities, details of which will be available closer to the event. Members of the press can register for MISTI-Con here in order to have the chance to interview the Darcey-Alden siblings. Press pass distribution will happen upon check-in. There are limited number of passes available, so please apply as soon as possible.\n\nRegistration for MISTI-Con is nearing sold-out capacity! If you haven’t yet got your tickets, organized your shuttle, or purchased one of our special event passes, visit www.misti-con.org to get sorted. Remember, this is a limited-attendance event to keep the conference small and reduce wait times, so we will sell out. Don’t wait – register today!\n\nAbout MISTI-Con:"
