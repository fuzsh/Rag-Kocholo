If you’re going to reblog this with snide comments such as “This is fake, who would do this?” and so on—don’t bother. You’ll only fuck up the number generator and if for some reason your post number was chosen, I’ll simply run the program again to pick a new post number for a new winner. I decided to do this simply because I believe Dramione shippers deserve a treat—an award if you want to call that. We have amazing graphic designers, talented authors, and an amazing fan-base. I myself am not very talented in the graphics department (Still teaching myself PS) and I want to contribute to our fan-base somehow—and I saw this as a good opportunity to do so.\n\nRules:\n\nYou do not have to be following me. Feel free to check out my blog, but following me is not necessary to win this item. I’m not doing this to gain followers.\n\nYou can reblog this a maximum of two times—I will check to see how many times you posted this if you’re chosen. I want everyone to have a fair chance, and it’s not exactly fair if you reblogged it 20 times versus someone who only reblogged it twice.\n\nWell this is a bit obvious—You need to be a Dramione shipper. I don’t really see why you’d be interested in this in the first place if you aren’t one.\n\nThe deadline is September 30th. I will be drawing a winner October 1st.\n\nThis is international. I will be paying for the shipping.\n\nWinner will be selected by a Random Number Generator, the number it generates I will look for the person with that post number. If you and the generator have the same number, you win the shirt.\n\nLikes don’t count. I want as many Dramione shippers as possible to see this & have a chance to win it.\n\nYou must have your ask box open. You will have 48 hours to respond. If you don’t respond within 48 hours I will generate a new number and move on.\n\nI might throw some other random goodies in there when I send it, I’m not sure yet so don’t count on it. Just count on the shirt.\n\nHere’s a larger photo of the Shirt:\n\nOnce I find a winner, I will ask you your shirt size and order the shirt to ship it to you.\n\nYou have the option of four different cut styles:\n\nScoop Cut:\n\nFringe Sleeves:\n\nOff the Shoulder:\n\nor Muscle Cut (Sleeveless)\n\nAny questions? Ask me here.\n\nGood luck to all of you!\n\n—Dracosredemption\n\n“We have different paths, but the same destiny.”\n\nHey there!\n\nFirst off, this is a legitimate giveaway.
