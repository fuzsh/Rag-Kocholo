        "text": "Something about Ellie's face reminds me of Shailene Woodley but with a thinner face.\n\nYeah, I see it.\n\nBeautiful and pure\n\nshe reminds me of a more ethereal looking taylor momsen :/\n\nYeah, I suppose they have similar features.\n\ni see!\n\nI'm pretty sure that kid will turn out to be a serial killer.\n\nEvanna looks so pretty! She's just so adorable to me. I love her twitter.\n\nI thought so many of the HP kids were miscast but she will always be the perfect Luna.\n\n+1 I love her\n\nHer voice too is everything.\n\nSo many photo's but the same face in all of them.\n\nBecause all human\n\nEvanna is lovely.\n\nPerfect Luna but I do get why people don't think she's conventionally beautiful. I'm glad she's doing theatre, she deserves a better career than some of her far less talented co stars.\n\n(no subject) - nabuch Expand\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nI agree, although I may be a little biased because personally, Evanna's eyes/shape/form/colour and lashes are her best features, even without make-up. And she has little freckles that you hardly ever see; they're cute. But I like her unique face overall.\n\nIt looks like she's getting more work now than she tried to the first year and a half or so post-Potter. She posted to her Twitter about some of the (failed) auditions she went to around L.A., not in great detail and weirdly humourous, but she sounded disappointed. She really didn't want to give up. I think it's paying off. Even though two of her projects were ultimately cancelled; this kind of thing really isn't unusual in this business, however. She most likely won't ever be ''big'' but I would love to see her be ''successful'' even if it's just indie projects and small theatre productions - and ''success'' isn't necessarily synonymous with ''Hollywood fame.''\n\nI kind of hope this success for most of the young HP cast. They're deserving people.\n\nI don't think she's ugly by any means but she's doing a lot of photo shoots and I don't think she has the profile to get the respect she needs yet. Emma Watson can do it because she's conventionally pretty, even though her acting is poor, whereas Evanna will probably need to get her acting career going first because I don't think it'll be long before the alternative magazines get bored of her.\n\nShe needs a career like Tilda Swinton or Christina Ricci like you said, then she'll be able to have a profitable mix of both. Plus she really needs better photographers and makeup on her shoots because they're really not doing her justice, a bit like Bonnie.\n\nI think people are far more beautiful when there's something different or interesting going on in their look. To me beauty is in the imperfections rather than symmetry, I'm always drawn to the weird and wonderful lol!\n\n(no subject) - jdnightghobhadi Expand\n\nSomething about the Lily actress in this post reminds me of Alana Bloom on Hannibal.\n\ndamn i was wondering if she was young Lily when the DW episode was on\n\nI desperately want a remake ten or twenty years from now but Evanna would be the only one I'd miss from the cast.\n\nI kind of want an animated version.\n\nIt'll either be a Downton Abbey/GoT type series on HBO, a small Brit production for the BBC, or an anime for me.\n\nAnd Evanna could possibly contribute something.\n\nEvanna needs to play Leslie Sharp's daughter or a younger version of her\n\nOoh, yes.\n\nEvanna also looks like she could possibly be a younger version of Jo Rowling. It's eerie.\n\nEvery muggle in that first pic...\n\nI was annoyed that young Lily didn't wear green contacts. Or they could have digitally colored her eyes or something.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nDan's eyes are blue, and he wore green lenses for the first two films. He had legit problems with the contacts though, so fair enough, he stopped wearing them and his eyes are light enough anyway. But with all of the special effects in these films, digitally painting his and Ellie's eyes should have happened anyway. It was such a major plot point.\n\n(no subject) - jdnightghobhadi Expand\n\n(no subject) - h0tfuss Expand\n\n(no subject) - jdnightghobhadi Expand\n\n(no subject) - h0tfuss Expand\n\n(no subject) - jdnightghobhadi Expand\n\nFunny, Benedict Clarke (young Severus) commented on this:\n\nDo you know why they decided to not give the young Lily green eyes?\n\nBenedict Clarke (young Snape): In the books, Lily and Harry’s eyes are green. However, Dan has blue eyes and reacted badly to contacts so Dan has his normal eyes in the films. Ellie did wear blue contacts to match Dan’s eyes, but unfortunately the brown showed through in the film. She was wearing blue contacts though.\n\nhttp://benedictclarke.tumblr.com/post/8869330668/do-you-know-why-they-decided-to-not-give-the-young-lily\n\nThey could have fixed this problem digitally, however.\n\n(no subject) - h0tfuss Expand\n\n(no subject) - jdnightghobhadi Expand\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nEllie's been in a couple period pieces already. Mostly for TV. She has unique, ''vintage'' features for these kind of parts, I think.\n\nEvanna could easily be in a period/costume piece too, though. As a 1920s Siren of some sort, with the right kind of make-up.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - jdnightghobhadi Expand"
