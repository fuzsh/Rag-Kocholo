TEL Art in Transit: “Orchard Road from ION Sky” by Mintio

See the lights of Orchard Road from the vantage point of ION Sky. When this image was created, ION Sky was the highest point in Orchard Road. Tracking in a south-east direction, the artist captured the night lights as a form of cartography (map-making) as well as mark-marking. With a panoramic camera and medium format photographic film, the lights were captured layer by layer, with multiple exposure. The multiple exposures render the bird’s-eye view of Orchard Road into abstraction, as if one is looking into the night sky, gazing at the stars.
