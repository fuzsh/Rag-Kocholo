Due to the soft marine clay, open excavation was not possible. Divers had to cut the 20m trenches, where the MRT tunnels were to be laid, in zero visibility and very muddy water. A concrete base for the tunnels was then laid with the water pumped out for the tunnels and the station to be built on. The tunnels were then covered with another layer of concrete before the seabed was refilled.[3][4] During the construction, a World War II-era bomb was found at the work site. The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Bomb Disposal Unit was called and the bomb was safely detonated elsewhere.[5]\n\nGround freezing will also be applied for the first time in Singapore rail construction when building the Thomson–East Coast Line part of this station, where it under-cross the existing North–South Line and Circle Line tunnels.[6]\n\nArtworks[edit]\n\nNorth–South Line: National Day Babies in 2015 by Tay Kay Chin\n\nThese 50 photographed images featured 53 Singaporeans born from year 1965 to 2014 as a birthday gift to Singapore in celebrating SG50. The 53 Singaporeans chosen reflects Singapore's demography in terms of gender, ethnic, and occupation. Sharing these photographs of people born on August 9, our National Day, who take different routes to success, the artist hopes to inspire all who passes by the artwork to strive and believe in one self and succeed in doing something extraordinary for the benefit of our nation.\n\nCircle Line: Train Rides on Rainy Days by Nah Yong En\n\nJust as rain brings cool relief and wash the city anew, this collection of images brings a refreshing element of nature into the underground station. The 14 raindrop photos depict scenes that commuters can see if they looked out of the window during a rainy train ride above ground.[7]\n\nCircle Line: Flowers in Blossom II by Tay Chee Toh\n\nThe mobile of delicate sculptures resembling flowers was originally hung in Orchard station. It was re-commissioned as homage to the legacy of art in Singapore’s MRT train stations, even before the Art in Transit programme was launched in 1997 for the North East Line.[7]\n\nArchitecture[edit]\n\nVisibility, integration and efficiency as the focal points when designing the Circle Line portion of the station. The design also has provisions for a future underground pedestrian network and connections to future developments. The translucent canopy acts as a skylight to allow natural light into the underground hall. The large entrance also allows large amounts of natural light to enter the station.[8] To limit the visual impact of the station to the surrounding park landscape, only the lift, escalators, the lightweight ETFE canopy and the reflective pool are visible from street level, giving users a full view of the park from the station entrance. The reflective pool also provides a smooth transition between the exits and the park.[9]\n\nThe station design was the winner of the Small Project Award at the World Architecture Festival in 2012.[9] Other awards includes the Land Transport Excellence Awards 2012,[10] the 2013 UIPT Asia-Pacific Grow with Public Transport Award[11] and honourable mention for the Singapore Institute of Architects Architectural Design Awards 2012.[12]\n\nLayout[edit]\n\nL1 Street Level B1 NSL Concourse Faregates, Ticketing Machines, Passenger Service Centre TEL Concourse Faregates, Ticketing Machines, Passenger Service Centre Transfer Linkways between Circle Line Concourse, North–South Line Concourse and Thomson–East Coast Line Platforms Service Level\n\nCPlatform ➔ CC29HarbourFrontCC1Dhoby Ghaut via CC4Promenade Service Map\n\nCE2Marina Bay CE1Bayfront CC1Dhoby Ghaut CC2Bras Basah CC3Esplanade CC4Promenade CC5Nicoll Highway CC6Stadium CC7Mountbatten CC8Dakota CC9Paya Lebar CC10MacPherson CC11Tai Seng CC12Bartley CC13Serangoon CC14Lorong Chuan CC15Bishan CC16Marymount CC17Caldecott CC19Botanic Gardens CC20Farrer Road CC21Holland Village CC22Buona Vista CC23one-north CC24Kent Ridge CC25Haw Par Villa CC26Pasir Panjang CC27Labrador Park CC28Telok Blangah CC29HarbourFront\n\nPlatform C/D\n\nDPlatform ➔ CC29HarbourFrontCC1Dhoby Ghaut via CC4Promenade Service Map\n\nCE2Marina Bay CE1Bayfront CC1Dhoby Ghaut CC2Bras Basah CC3Esplanade CC4Promenade CC5Nicoll Highway CC6Stadium CC7Mountbatten CC8Dakota CC9Paya Lebar CC10MacPherson CC11Tai Seng CC12Bartley CC13Serangoon CC14Lorong Chuan CC15Bishan CC16Marymount CC17Caldecott CC19Botanic Gardens CC20Farrer Road CC21Holland Village CC22Buona Vista CC23one-north CC24Kent Ridge CC25Haw Par Villa CC26Pasir Panjang CC27Labrador Park CC28Telok Blangah CC29HarbourFront\n\nB2 CCL Concourse Faregates, Ticketing Machines, Passenger Service Centre Transfer Linkway between Circle Line Concourse and Thomson–East Coast Line Platforms\n\nAPlatform ➔ NS1Jurong East Service Map\n\nNS27Marina Bay NS26Raffles Place NS25City Hall NS24Dhoby Ghaut NS23Somerset NS22Orchard NS21Newton NS20Novena NS19Toa Payoh NS18Braddell NS17Bishan NS16Ang Mo Kio NS15Yio Chu Kang NS14Khatib NS13Yishun NS12Canberra NS11Sembawang NS10Admiralty NS9Woodlands NS8Marsiling NS7Kranji NS5Yew Tee NS4Choa Chu Kang NS3Bukit Gombak NS2Bukit Batok NS1Jurong East\n\nPlatform A/B\n\nBPlatform ➔ NS28Marina South Pier Service Map\n\nNS28Marina South Pier NS27Marina Bay\n\nB3 Transfer Hall between North–South Line Concourse, Circle Line Concourse and Thomson–East Coast Line Platforms B4 Platform E\n\nEPlatform ➔ TE29Bayshore Service Map\n\nTE29Bayshore TE28Siglap TE27Marine Terrace TE26Marine Parade TE25Tanjong Katong TE24Katong Park TE23Tanjong Rhu TE22Gardens by the Bay TE20Marina Bay\n\nB5 Platform F\n\nFPlatform ➔ TE1Woodlands North Service Map\n\nTE20Marina Bay TE19Shenton Way TE18Maxwell TE17Outram Park TE16Havelock TE15Great World TE14Orchard TE13Orchard Boulevard TE12Napier TE11Stevens TE9Caldecott TE8Upper Thomson TE7Bright Hill TE6Mayflower TE5Lentor TE4Springleaf TE3Woodlands South TE2Woodlands TE1Woodlands North\n\nExits[edit]\n\nExit Disabled-Access Location/Nearby 1 Central Boulevard, Marina One Residences 2 Bayfront Avenue 3 Bayfront Avenue/Park Street 4 Sheares Avenue 5 Park Street\n\nTransport Services[edit]\n\nFirst/Last Train Timing[edit]\n\nDestination First Train Last Train Mon − Fri Sat Sun & P.H.
