From the National Day concert to flypast information, NDP activities at the Padang and Marina Bay on 9 August, new parade segments, fireworks, NDP heartland events and more!\n\nThis year’s National Day Parade is promising to be a big one! With the theme ‘Together, As One United People,’ the 2024 NDP will celebrate Singapore’s 59th birthday with parades at two venues on 9 August—the Padang and the Promontory @ Marina Bay. This means stunning fireworks displays across both areas, promising some of the biggest NDP fireworks yet. Plus, the festivities will extend beyond 9 August with NDP events at heartland locations around the island. What makes this year even more exciting is the introduction of new segments, including a ‘war fighting’ air-land-sea display! Here’s what to expect at NDP 2024, from crowd favourites like the Red Lions, the Presidential Gun Salute, fireworks, and much more.\n\nRead more: Where to Watch NDP Fireworks for Free\n\nJump to:\n\n– NDP 2024 Celebrations at the Padang and the Promontory @ Marina Bay\n\n– NDP 2024 Celebrations in the Heartlands\n\n– Where to catch NDP 2024 Flypast\n\n– Other National Day 2024 Events, Buffets and Dining Offers\n\n– Where to Watch NDP Fireworks\n\nDisclaimer: This is an external event not owned or managed by Sassy Mama.

This year, NDP 2024 brings the festivities to five heartland locations on 10 August 2024, each with a unique theme. Head to the open field opposite Bishan Circle Line MRT station for “Unity in Diversity”, the Waterway Point for “One HOME”, FutsalArena @ Yishun for “Moving Forward, Cherishing Our Past”, Paya Lebar Quarter 1 for “Lights Up, Power Up” and Buona Vista MRT Station for “Heart ToGather”.\n\nNDP 2024 Heartland celebrations will feature carnival games, family activities, live performances, static displays of SAF, SCDF, and SPF vehicles, and fireworks!

The main parade will be held at the Padang, and viewers can expect immersive programmes that extend from the Padang to Marina Bay. Look forward to crowd favourite programmes such as the Red Lions, State Flag Flypast, the Presidential Gun Salute and more. There will also be a few firsts at NDP 2024, including the new Total Defence 40 Dynamic Defence Display, which will feature an exciting air-land-sea display to depict a whole-of-government and community response to various threats and disruptions against the nation.

There will also be a sail-past by the President Gun Salute, along with stage performances and a live telecast of the NDP 2024 at the Padang.\n\nNDP 2024 will incorporate exciting new technologies, including wrist-worn LEDs and extended multimedia screens.
