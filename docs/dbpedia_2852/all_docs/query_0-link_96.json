        "text": "A few decades ago when only the North South Line (NSL) and East West Line (EWL) existed, City Hall MRT Station and Raffles Place MRT Station served as the only interchange stations in Singapore, bridging the distances between the extreme ends of our island. These two stations make it possible for commuters to switch from the red line (NSL) to the green line (EWL), cutting travelling time significantly.\n\nToday, many other MRT stations join the ranks of City Hall MRT Station and Raffles Place MRT Station as interchange stations, with the commencement of new lines such as the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) and the Downtown Line (DT). Nonetheless, City Hall MRT Station remains a station with high foot traffic because of its central location and the important landmarks and establishments around it. Other than the travel information relating to this station, this post will cover its history and information about the surroundings.\n\n1. City Hall MRT Station Brief Info\n\n2. First & Last Train Timings\n\n3. History And Facts Of City Hall MRT Station\n\nIn the original plan for the MRT network, this station was named St. Andrew’s. However, for a more appropriate representation of the locality served and for historical reasons, it was renamed City Hall MRT Station in November 1982.\n\nThe contract for the construction of the station, valued at S$77.65 million, was awarded to the joint venture between Lum Chang and Nishimatsu.\n\nThe joint venture between Keppel Shipyard and Kajima Corporation was awarded the contract for the building of the four 800-metres long tunnels which run between City Hall MRT Station and Raffles Place MRT Station. The contract was valued at S$35.65 million.\n\nConstruction works commenced on 7 September 1984. The tunnels would cross over one another and pass through a shallow part of Singapore River, which necessitated the draining of the river.\n\nAfter some delay in the construction, the MRT System was inaugurated on 12 March 1988 by the then Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. The plaque can be found just outside the station control at City Hall MRT Station.\n\n4. The Surroundings Of City Hall MRT Station\n\nExit A Of City Hall MRT Station\n\nThe escalators at Exit A of the station will bring you directly to Raffles City Shopping Centre where you can shop at over 200 premium stores spread over five floors offering established jewellery and luxury watch brands, fashion labels and beauty concepts.

Here, you will see CHIJMES, Raffles Hotel and Carlton Hotel.\n\nCHIJMES is a popular night spot which offers an excellent variety of dining options. Anglo Indian Café & Bar, Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ Restaurant, Senor Taco and the Michelin Star winning Lei Garden are some restaurants where you can really satiate your taste buds. To end the night, head over to some of the bars, such as Harry’s bar, for a drink or two.\n\nIndulge in a pleasing selection of international and local dishes at Café Mosaic, located on Level 1 of Carlton Hotel. Do check out their 1-for-1 buffet promotions for selected credit cards. Tuxedo Café & Patisserie is another lovely place to check out if you are keen on a good brew of coffee paired with freshly baked pastries and sweet treats.\n\nRaffles Hotel surely requires no introduction.

Do come by and appreciate the neo-Renaissance architecture of this hotel!\n\nExit B Of City Hall MRT Station\n\nExit B will bring you to North Bridge Road where you will be greeted by Eden Residences Capitol, a residential block.
