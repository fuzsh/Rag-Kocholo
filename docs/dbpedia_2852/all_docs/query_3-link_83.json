        "text": "Yes, this is a “Basics” post. This blog draws quite a decent amount of content from transit consultant Jarrett Walker from Portland, USA on his blog Human Transit. Although the context of public transportation in Singapore and the United States are vastly different, often his “Basics” posts are still gold. Especially when planning new routes.\n\nJarrett has also done a post on branching and its shortfalls, of which the effects are most particularly felt in dense cities with high transit ridership numbers, requiring operators to run vehicles at high frequencies.\n\nUnfortunately for Singapore, planners didn’t quite think about the effects of branching when they planned the routes here. And mistakes were made, countless times. LTA fell into its own hole repeatedly that on hindsight it just looks hilarious, capacity fails aside.\n\nWarning: This post is extremely long. Be prepared to spend 30 minutes here.\n\nWhy branching is a terrible idea\n\nI won’t exactly go into the theory of branching and frequency, because that has already been covered by the Human Transit post.\n\nInstead I’ll do a few case studies from rail systems all around the world.\n\nHong Kong MTR – Tseung Kwan O Line\n\nThe Tseung Kwan O Line is a feeder MTR line intended to serve residents in the East Kowloon and Tseung Kwan O areas, by joining up the Hang Hau regions to the Kwun Tong and the Island lines at Tiu Keng Leng and North Point respectively. It is also the only MTR line to carry out branching operations (pre-merger, the East Rail Line also has a branch to Lok Ma Chau and Lo Wu).\n\nTseung Kwan O Line (Wikipedia)\n\nAs we all know, the MTR, other than operating its trains, is also a somewhat successful landlord, owning a sizeable amount of housing properties scattered around Hong Kong. (I will casually ignore SMRT’s monumental failure at real estate) So the LOHAS Park project is just like any other MTR real estate plan, albeit somewhat isolated.\n\nAs any capitalist person will tell you, use any opportunity available to earn more bucks! So the MTR Corporation, being both a transport operator and landlord, decided to rope in more cash by extending the MTR system to LOHAS Park. The cheapest option, of course, was to extend the already under planning Tseung Kwan O line with a branch to the residential development.\n\nFor those already familiar with the topic of branching and are bemoaning “Why don’t you just extend the Kwun Tong Line to LOHAS Park instead??”, bear in mind that when the TKOL was under planning the KTL ran from Yau Ma Tei to Quarry Bay (and to North Point). The Tiu Keng Leng extension was only open to the KTL upon completion of the TKOL, with the Eastern Harbour Crossing handed over to the TKOL.\n\nBased on the Wikipedia article I gave above, the frequencies are honestly, trash.\n\nFor the tl;dr:\n\nDuring off-peak hours, trains run as a shuttle service between LOHAS Park and Tiu Keng Leng. Frequency: 12 minutes.\n\nDuring peak hours, every 3rd train runs through to LOHAS Park from North Point. Frequency: 7.5 minutes\n\nAll other trains run through to Po Lam on the “mainline”\n\nCombined frequency on the North Point – Tseung Kwan O stretch during peak hours: 2.5 minutes.\n\nSome may try arguing that the frequency is a result of lack of demand. Well, that’s sort of true, but also because of the huge loophole in the system (designed to cut costs ethically): The tracks converge at Tseung Kwan O Station and share them for the journey to Tiu Keng Leng.\n\nMTR track diagram pdf\n\nThis means that if we can afford to run x mins frequency between TKL and TKO, the maximum frequency we can afford from Tiu Keng Leng to North Point, as well as the branch points to Po Lam and LOHAS Park, is 2x min, or half as many trains.\n\nYup. You saw that. If you were waiting for a train to LOHAS Park (Because you live there, let’s say), you have to wait anywhere between 7 and 12 minutes. (Edit: Just checked the MTR page. The maximum frequency they gave is 14 minutes)\n\nThis puts the Tseung Kwan O line at roughly the same standard as most ‘light rail’ (legit LRT, at least) in the United States. Basically, if you don’t travel during peak hours, you have to kind of plan your schedule around the MTR timetable!\n\nFor instance if the train to Tiu Keng Leng departs at 9am, you probably have to be out of the apartment by, say, 8.50 AM to avoid having to wait up to 15 mins for the next one (and risk being late). Such a system would sort of destroy the spontaneity associated with public transportation (especially rail rapid transit).\n\nNo wonder there was a comment on the TKOL page of Checkerboard Hill (another railfan blog for HK) saying: LOHAS Park *is* the landfill 🙂\n\nThe good thing is, there is only 1 station on the branch line, so the only people affected are those living in LOHAS Park. Even then, there’s buses, but given how mad traffic there is, they probably won’t ride it.\n\nAnd for those asking why the Po Lam branch isn’t talked about here, it’s because the service pattern is such that 66.7% (or 2/3) of all trains head down there, so the waiting time is at max 5 minutes (when there’s the gap left due to the train heading the other way). Still acceptable. Though they had to further sacrifice service to LOHAS Park.\n\nRapid KL – Ampang/Sri Petaling LRT lines\n\nSome big brain guy at Rapid KL decided to hide his geometrical crimes by branding the former STAR LRT as 2 separate lines, Ampang Line (orange) and Sri Petaling line (dark maroon). Actually, he can’t be blamed because he didn’t plan these lines when they were still under the former operator. Still, what does this mean for commuters using this line?\n\nFirstly, the frequencies are, a mess.\n\nBecause operationally, the “2” lines are actually just ONE line with 2 branches i.e. the 4 tracks of the two branches converge into just 2 tracks at the common section.\n\nSentul Timur – Chan Sow Lin: Common section\n\nAmpang – Chan Sow Lin: Ampang Branch\n\nPutra Heights – Chan Sow Lin: Sri Petaling Branch\n\nThe LOHAS Park example I gave earlier was a bit overrated. But the impacts of branching the single LRT line here, especially the most used one in Kuala Lumpur, are quite profound on commuters. Especially during rush hour. I’ll let the tweets speak for themselves.\n\nBut why does this happen? Basic math. On the common section up to Chan Sow Lin, the LRT operates with only 2 tracks (for each direction, duh!) So pretty much you have the 2 “separate” LRT lines sharing tracks, which as we all know, constrains frequency by a decent bit. And before RapidKL can hopefully re-signal the entire mess properly, train frequency on the common section is at most 3 minutes (Safety first, always!). So even if we run the trains at minimum headway, the points on the branches will have only half the number of trains as the common section! 6 minutes for a train is a distant memory for many cities, but very real in Kuala Lumpur. Add that to some cost-cutting involved, and you have a system which you don’t have much flexibility to work with. I mean, would you like to wait 10 minutes for a train if you are just running an errand to someplace barely 3 stops down? If the stations were air-conditioned, I might 🙂\n\nHere’s an infographic from the Human Transit post on service level with branching, albeit applied in a wye configuration.\n\nUpdate: After 20+ years of ignorance, RapidKL has finally done away with the branching system on the Ampang and Sri Petaling lines. The Ampang to Chan Sow Lin stretch will run as a shuttle, requiring a connection at the latter. However they are constrained by the fleet size – they have only 50 trains, down from the original 90.\n\nUpdate #2: It’s unfortunate that the above-mentioned arrangement was a mere stop-gap for the duration of the signalling upgrade. Now that they’ve reverted to the the old branching arrangement, RapidKL has literally defeated the entire purpose of the new signalling system, i.e. improving frequencies, as the mainline constitutes… less than one-fifth of the total combined line length! So you spend that much… only on having 20% of the line getting decent headways. Not stonks at all.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nSimple. LTA has screwed up some of its planning decisions really badly due to this mathematical principle of branching. There’s a few examples, and one of them matters particularly, because it is in the CBD. And remember, a network is more than the sum of its parts!\n\nLet’s start off with the not so-oh wait, all of these examples are showing ugly results.\n\nSengkang/Punggol LRT APM\n\nSide note: Read my earlier post to understand why I refuse to call them “LRT”. In short: LRT here, is APM elsewhere, and APM usually doesn’t get used outside of airports. Clearly from the start we’ve messed up the technology choice.\n\nAt least these maps are good in one thing – they honestly show the effect of branching on frequency.\n\nLTA appears to be covering up their mathematical crimes just like RapidKL 20 years ago, the current map doesn’t reflect this fact:\n\nI’m lazy to rewrite the whole explanation again, but here is what I wrote in the post on how our “LRT” is not true light rail, on its terrible frequencies:\n\nThis is on the extreme in the Sengkang/Punggol APM systems – the mainline segment is only at the – wait for it – the central station! (i.e. all stations on the loops are branches!) This means that while a 100 second frequency can be afforded at the central stations, out in the loops the minimum waiting time is 200 seconds – 3 min 20 sec. Add this to an already overworked system with hundreds waiting at each station for 2 mini-pods only capable of carrying 200 passengers. You know what happens next (intense flashback)\n\nLRT: Except when it is not. (SG Transport Critic) 2: The damn service pattern\n\nI explain it further:\n\nEven with the new signalling upgrade in place, the minimum headway is still 100 seconds. This means that along the two loops of the SPAPM (or along the single loop of the BPAPM), the minimum waiting tie is 3:20 mins. Each train consists of 2 pods joined together, giving about a capacity of 200 (according to Land Transport Guru) Fine, we’ll push that a bit, and say each 2-car train can pack 250 passengers.\n\n3 1/3 minutes frequency gives about 18 trains per hour. Assuming all trains run in a 2-car configuration, this gives us 4500 passengers per direction per hour! Multiply this in 2 directions along 2 loops, we get a 18000 passengers in total that can be moved to the central hub stations within an hour, the usual window for morning/evening peak hour commutes. Meanwhile the population of Sengkang/Punggol (sorry Bukit Panjang, I neglected you a bit! E:( ) is somewhere around 250000, so the APM system isn’t of much use to like what, 93% of the town’s population? (18000/250000 gives 7.25%)\n\nYeah, if you want those pods to be remotely useful at least a sizeable portion of town residents should be able to use it – somewhere around 30% at least. Even tripling the frequencies (not doable after factoring in safety today) only a measly 21% of residents will be able to get on the APM system.\n\nLRT: Except when it is not. (SG Transport Critic) 5: Pathetic frequency\n\nYes, that pretty much sums it all up. Read the full article if you are interested.\n\nSo what happens?\n\nAlamak!\n\nCircle Line\n\nCrossposted with the CCL6 post\n\nThis is the elephant in the room we need to address today\n\nIf our rail network is a family, we can say that the CCL is often the sick child – oft-plagued with problems despite it being fairly new. (The NSL is the ageing ah kong having cough every 2 days or so)\n\nAnd to add on to that, one more commuting woe those travelling on the CCL regularly have is – the trains are so. damn. crowded. Even during off-peak hours. Well you can blame that on LTA’s poor planning when they initially came up with the “Marina LRT“, and that was a legacy that carried over into the CC and DT lines, evident in the 3-car trains (they probably learned that an APM is NOT a LRT).\n\nThe branching issue isn’t exactly serious today, but in the future it may have some disastrous consequences if not addressed (and LTA’s mathematically unsound plan for CCL6 taken carte blanche).\n\nPresently, there are 2 types (actually no, it’s 3) of services running on the CCL:\n\nMainline: Dhoby Ghaut (8) to HarbourFront (9)\n\nBranch (off-peak): Stadium (no EDN) to Marina Bay (10)\n\nBranching Service (Peak only): HarbourFront (9) to Marina Bay (10)\n\nAnd here’s LTA’s “mathematically unsound plan” come 2025 (I have my reasons, read on!)\n\nAnti-clockwise\n\nClockwise (I’m not sure how the (8) and (9) destination circles will be dealt with after this though)\n\nThis weird arrangement running from Dhoby Ghaut to Prince Edward, then turning back to DBG from there.\n\nIn a shellnut, the Dhoby Ghaut to Promenade section becomes the branch, and Marina Bay-Bayfront section becomes the mainline\n\nNoticed anything?\n\nIn both arrangements, the branch and mainlines share tracks.\n\nThis means that the frequency on the branch lines is constrained by the frequency on the mainline. Operationally, this means that the lowest headway possible on the branch is 200 seconds, twice that of the mainline’s 100 (based on the constraints of CBTC signalling). That translates to 3 min 20 seconds at least. But in the context of the Circle Line, the minimum frequency is 2 mins (presumably due to the fleet shortage – 64 trains running on 71 km of track.)\n\nMind you – when the service pattern is such that only a short section of track is shared, it is a very wasteful arrangement. This is exemplified in the Circle Line (and the Tseung Kwan O line I mentioned earlier). With only the Promenade – Stadium section being shared, essentially, the rest of the line are “branches”.\n\nThe peak arrangement today is fairly straightforward in terms of defining “mainline” and “branch line”, so I won’t delve too deeply into that.\n\nCome 2025, with the opening of the Circle Line Stage 6 and the completion of the circle, we have a even more mathematically incoherent plan put forth by none other than our big-brained Land Transport Authority. Recap: Besides the continuous loop services, the CCL post-2025 will have a shuttle service operating from Dhoby Ghaut to Prince Edward. On first glance, it looks pretty ok. But this arrangement leaves a gaping hole right smack in the middle of the Marina Bay Financial Center. And worse of all, this leaves the CBD, where MRT service should be highest, with ironically the least service of all the CCL. Happy commuting.\n\nBut the woes don’t end there.\n\nFar out west, there is a booming new town that will be developed in the next decade. (For the ignoramuses, that is Tengah) Already, the western side of the East-West Line is, safe to say, screwed up. So pretty much you have an overcrowded western side which is going to further fill up in the next decade, and the only option into the CBD being the EWL.\n\nFor the longest time imaginable since the entire Jurong Region Line mania started, talk has been floating around of a possible extension to Haw Par Villa on the Circle Line. This could have been an alternative route, to at last bring some relief to the EWL, by sending commuters down the JRL + CCL path directly to Marina Bay with the completion of CCL6.\n\nBut do you remember this infographic from the Branching article?\n\nLook at the “Branching box”. The proposed service pattern for the Circle Line post-2025 would see something similar to the diagram on the left, except that it is just the line width halving at Prince Edward due to every other train turning back there. This creates a bottleneck, except that it is a transit bottleneck, hindering the movement of commuters. With just one station short of Marina Bay, most commuters would still go by the JRL + EWL instead as it (1) brings them directly into the CBD, (2) doesn’t dump them barely 1 stop before their destination.\n\nOr, they might just flock to the JRL + CCL alternative in large numbers. When that time comes, will we see a repeat of Bishan at Prince Edward (AM Peak) and Marina Bay (PM Peak)?\n\nIt’s chilling. Either way, the MRT network is screwed with the increasing population (cough White Paper 2013 cough). Hopefully someone decides to change the service plan before it is too late.\n\nCross Island Line – Punggol Branch\n\nI’m genuinely concerned about this one, given the complete silence on the branching matter amidst all the CRL hoo-hah going on about the CCNR and the western extension. This leaves many question marks.\n\nHow will the Punggol spur line operate in relation to the CRL mainline?\n\nWhat will be the minimum headway of the CRL?\n\nWill there be any “express” services? (Don’t be so ready to believe LTA’s denial, they may change their minds at the last minute)\n\nIf so, how will the express and local services be integrated into one line?\n\nLet’s try answering these questions one by one.\n\nHow will the Punggol spur line operate in relation to the CRL mainline?\n\nThis, my friends, is the largest question of them all. LTA is really as opaque as a black box – we have absolutely no idea what the hell is going on, making us rely on “construction blogs” aka undercover spies to tell us what is going on.\n\nEdit: Old news, but the CRL construction blog has released a video on the configuration of Pasir Ris station, showing a stacked-island formation being used, resembling those at the well-known cross-platform interchange stations, hinting at the idea of the CPL being operated as a “shuttle” (i.e. separate from the mainline) instead of a “branch”. It’s a step in the right direction, and hopefully this is what we get come 2031.\n\nBut even spies can’t get all of the information for us. Especially on how Pasir Ris station is to be organized.\n\nIt better not adopt the Circle-esqe branching style we currently see today. That’s because doing that will mean that the frequency on the majority of the line length will be greatly reduced! And this, is determined by the answer to the next question, which we don’t have an answer to either, sadly. Because if the branching style is to be adopted, we may see wait times for 1 million commuters (the expected daily ridership) go up to the 6-minute mark – unheard of ever since SMRT got into a frenzy of buying CRRC Qingdao Sifang trains.\n\nWhat will be the CRL’s minimum headway?\n\nI’m going off topic, I know. But we need to address this for one important reason.\n\nRemember the LRT APM?\n\nWhat is the frequency constraint of the APM system? That’s right, the signalling!\n\nSo the signalling will determine the maximum frequency on the main section, if the branching option is exercised. And that will answer the question: Can we afford to branch the line at Pasir Ris?\n\nHonestly I’m not very optimistic about the whole talk of CBTC magically decreasing headways. That’s because of simple physics laws. With the usage of overhead power lines (like NEL) instead of 3rd rail, and spacing the stations further apart, it wouldn’t be a stretch to think that the operational speed of the CRL would be far higher than that on our current lines, in the league of “suburban commuter trains” like the Kowloon-Canton Railway in Hong Kong, running at speeds greater than 100 km/h comfortably.\n\nAnd that means two possibilities, both of which would increase braking distance and thus the safety space required between trains.\n\nThe first, would be that rapid transit rolling stock is still used, albeit customised for higher speed. This would mean trains with braking rates of 1.1 m/s^2, consistent with that of the other lines, making speed the only variable. Basic math/physics: With the same braking rate it takes much longer to slow down from a higher speed.\n\nThe second, and likely the option exercised by LTA, would be that suburban rail rolling stock is employed, similar to the CRH6F product line offered by CRRC Zhuzhou – essentially a slower cousin of their high-speed counterpart.\n\nLike their high-speed counterparts, these trains have slower braking rates due to the way they’re intrinsically built, hovering around 0.8m/s^2. With slower braking, and higher speed both at play, one should know that the required safety distance, would increase by a large margin. This, by the way, explains why, despite the famous Shinkansen trains having been running on CBTC-level technology since their inception in 1964, have only been able to manage 3 min headways even during the most busy of times, despite there being demand for more service, simply because with greater speed, comes the requirement for greater space!\n\nMight as well shut up the talk about CBTC being a “silver bullet” and actually get to work making sure every part of a rail line gets equally good service, by de-branching everything! After all, even if you implement it, but don’t actually utilise it, the money is as good as gone!\n\nWill there be any express services on the CRL?\n\nAlthough LTA (and the Khaw himself) says no, given how the LTA has periodically surprised us in their projects, I continue crossing my fingers on this topic.\n\nWhy would I address this? Because in the context of heavily-used rail lines, every express train is one less train that could be used to transport passengers on local services. When talking about high-frequency services you could expect an express train to hold up a local train, or vice versa, if the express tracks are not specially built, as in the case of the East Rail Line in Hong Kong (with through trains only stopping at Hung Hom), or even more acutely felt in the Tung Chung/Airport Express lines where TCL trains (local) hold up the AEL trains (express) or vice versa, especially at the Sunny Bay station, as they share the tracks except at stations. Hey, I’ve answered the fourth question too!\n\nOuch.\n\nEast West Line – Tuas South Extension\n\nTalk about obscurity. Talk about the TSE. We have literally no idea what is going on and how this proposed thing would even interface with the current line at Gul Circle.\n\nNewsflash: Gul Circle has 2 platform levels. Currently, one direction of the East West Line takes one level.\n\nNewsflash 2: If you want to terminate a service at a station with stacked tracks, be prepared to endure a “masochistic” ride.\n\nSo if LTA does decide to go ahead with the TSE after all, to avoid political controversy again, they most definitely would branch the EWL at Gul Circle. But there’s a catch: every other train is already being turned around at Joo Koon, one stop before Gul Circle. And, I suppose SMRT knew internally that they messed up by opening an extension to some place that has practically zero demand outside peak hours (plus maybe the lunch peak), so after the TWE opened every other train (or 2 in 3, depending) still terminated at Joo Koon, leaving headways as bad as 15 min down the TWE, essentially defeating the purpose of running an MRT line there. Given how profit-first SMRT Trains is (SMRT Buses is another matter, thankfully), I severely doubt they would actually want to incur more losses by running more empty trains down to Tuas South by moving the JKN short trip there, so it is only realistic to expect double branching, one by halving the frequency of trains at Joo Koon, and the other by splitting the line at Gul Circle, just so each train looks ever-so-slightly-fuller. (Transportational austerity at work, I’ll get a post soon on this). Well then, you’ve successfully defeated the purpose of placing a rail line in Tuas! Even a 4 min headway through the CBD would mean a 16 min headway at Tuas… might as well run a dedicated Joo Koon – Tuas trunk bus that would actually be more useful for SMRT Trains’ profit-first mindsets.\n\nEdit 12/6/23: Said post on transportational austerity is finally out, 3 years after this post was first released. Here it is.\n\n(And then there’s all that talk about CRL/JRL coming into Gul Circle or taking over the TSE but I’ll ignore that for the sake of this post)\n\nConclusion\n\nBasically, for those tl’dr, branching is a bad idea.\n\nSimply because the math doesn’t permit so.\n\nOnce again, I present this infographic:\n\nOr for the chem students, High Ridership + Branching –> Chernobyl 2.0\n\nLiked this article?
