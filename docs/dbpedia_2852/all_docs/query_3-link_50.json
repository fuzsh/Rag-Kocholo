We reserve the right to change, modify or amend this Statement and Policy from time to time. Any changes will be included in the latest Statement and Policy published on our Websites so that you will always understand our current practices with respect to the information we gather, how we might use that information and disclose that information to third parties. You will know when this Statement and Policy was last updated by looking at the date at the top of this Statement and Policy. Any changes to this Statement and Policy will become effective upon its posting on our Websites. Continued access and use of our Websites and/or services following any changes also constitutes your acceptance of the revised Statement and Policy then in effect. Nevertheless, we will seek your consent to any substantial changes if required by relevant laws and regulations or any changes made to the use of Personal Data you provided to us in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection.\n\n1. Purposes of collecting your Personal Data\n\nWe limit the collection, use and retention of your Personal Data to the specific information we need. We might use your Personal Data collected from you or gathered from our Websites, strictly for the performance of our agreements with you and for our legitimate purposes such as:\n\nto communicate with you generally;\n\nto deal with your suggestions, enquiries or complaints;\n\nto process, confirm, provide and charge for hotel arrangements and restaurants and our goods and services;\n\nto administer, support, improve and develop our business;\n\nto disclose the winner of contests conducted by us or on our behalf;\n\nto provide you with quality service;\n\nto provide you with access to all parts of our Websites;\n\nto conduct market research, surveys and analysis so as to provide you with better products and services;\n\nto provide for the safety and security of our guests;\n\nto prevent, detect or investigate suspicious or illegal activities;\n\nto meet legal and regulatory requirements and administer general record keeping;\n\nto process your application for, and manage, operate and maintain, membership of the Dorsett loyalty program, and to provide you with information on the activities and benefits of it; and\n\nto adhere to applicable laws, court orders, directions, codes or guidelines.\n\nUnless you have expressly opted not to participate when providing us with your Personal Data, we may share these with our carefully selected partners or merchants.\n\nAlso when using our services or participating in our events and activities, there are chances that you may be photographed by our staff or other participants or guests. By accepting our services or submitting the application to participate in such events and activities, you unconditionally agree to be photographed, and further agree to the use and/or uploading of such photographs by us on our Websites and/or our promotional and marketing materials.\n\nWhere you have consented, we might also use your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, for example, we will periodically contact you by post or via email and provide information about our special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. If you have changed your mind in receiving such promotional materials, please refer to section 8.4.\n\n2. Personal Data we collect and how we use it\n\nYou are always offered options as to whether to provide your Personal Data to us and/or our business partners during our collection of your Personal Data. The provision of Personal Data or any information is voluntary and we may not use your Personal Data unless with your consent. However, if you do not provide the mandatory data required, we may not be able to process your enquiries or requests or provide you with the requested products, services, activities or facilities.\n\n2.1 Anonymous Browsing\n\nVisitors to our Websites do so on an anonymous basis. We do not collect Personal Data from you unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us, for example when you reach our Websites through our electronic direct mail, or where you have created a profile or account under our Websites and/or when you are making inquiries or reservations/bookings.\n\n2.2 Making a room reservation and check in at our hotels\n\nIf you would like us to make a reservation at one of our hotels, we will request for your Personal Data for payment purposes and to administer our business. We may also ask for your travel details and room preferences to better prepare ourselves for your arrival and to serve you better before your departure. Such Personal Data will be made available to the applicable hotel for the purpose of completing your reservation request. If reservation is made through our Websites, such Personal Data will be passed via a third-party system to our hotel operating systems under data encrypted environment. We may also need to collect certain Personal Data as required by local laws such as passport numbers, type of entry visa and driver’s licence details.\n\nThe same type of Personal Data may be requested when you make any online enquiries.\n\nWe will also use your email address to send an email confirmation of your booking, and a pre-arrival message summarising your confirmation details and preferences. Such pre-arrival message will include other information about the hotel, the area and the weather.\n\nUpon check in, your Personal Data will be verified by our staff or via mobile devices (including but not limited to electronic tablets and robot self check-in kiosks) through Wifi or any wireless internet connection and you will be requested to indicate whether you wish to opt-in and receive hotel promotional literature. With your consent, we may also make certain Personal Data available to strategic business partners such as mail houses and email service providers for the sole purpose of mailing and dissemination of promotional materials for us, such as invitation to participate in our online survey and/or with promotion materials for your next booking. Your Personal Data will not be shared with third parties for their own marketing purposes.\n\nIf you are making a reservation or completing check-in through Wifi or any other wireless internet connection, you should understand and accept the risk of entering personal data through these internet connection methods, which is out of our responsibility. For reservations, data encryption process begins when you arrive and accept the secure sockets layer (“SSL”) certificate at the booking engine page and when data is passing from the third-party payment card industry (“PCI”) compliant central reservation system to our PCI compliant operating systems. Please bear in mind that no security system or system of transmitting information over the internet is guaranteed to be secure.\n\n2.3 Making a room reservation by calling us\n\nYou can make a reservation by calling one of our hotels. When making a reservation, you will be asked to provide your Personal Data for payment purposes and to administer our business. If you choose to provide us with your email address, a confirmation and a pre-arrival message of your reservation will be sent to you by email.\n\n2.4 During your stay at our hotels\n\nWe record your itemised spending to properly assemble your folio during your stay, which includes your room rate and other expenses billed to your room. We also record the information to comply with financial reporting requirements and those imposed by our auditors and government authorities. In order to assure your future comfort and attention to your individual needs, other stay specific information may also be stored in the property management system, such as your food and beverage preferences and other special requests. Certain information regarding your service preferences may be made available to our other hotels through our central database.\n\n2.5 Accessing our websites from mobile devices\n\nYou can access our Website from mobile devices to find our hotels and/or restaurants and make a reservation. When you make a reservation or complete check-in using mobile devices (including but not limited to electronic tablets and robot self check-in kiosks), you may need to provide certain Personal Data for guarantee purposes. You should understand and accept the risk of entering your Personal Data through Wifi or any wireless internet connection, which is out of our responsibility. Please bear in mind that no security system or system of transmitting information over the internet is guaranteed to be secure.\n\n2.6 Creating and updating your account information\n\nFor hotel related services, upon completing an online room reservation, you can set up, review or update your information online. When enrolling for our newsletter or loyalty program, you will be required to provide certain Personal Data such as name, email address, mailing address, room preferences and service requests. Such Personal Data will be stored in our email marketing tool service provider which follows strict data privacy laws and be used strictly by our business units for communication to subscribers and marketing promotion only. Please bear in mind that no security system or system of transmitting information over the internet is guaranteed to be secure.\n\n2.7 Food and beverage outlet reservations\n\nWe collect your Personal Data when you make a reservation at our food and beverage outlets. If you are a repeat guest at our food and beverage outlets or have filled out our food and beverage questionnaire, we may store your Personal Data in our databases used by our business units’ operation to serve you better upon your return.\n\n2.8 Non-hotel related services\n\nFor our non-hotel related operations including but not limited to residential and commercial leasing, we may ask for your Personal Data for payment purposes and administer our business. With your consent, we might also offer various related products or services that may be of interest to you as a patron, tenant or club member.\n\n2.9 Third Party Providers\n\nThis Statement and Policy does not apply to our processing of your Personal Data on behalf of third party providers who may collect your Personal Data from you and provide it to us. In this situation, we would merely act as a data processor and thus you should review applicable third party providers’ privacy policies before submitting your Personal Data to them.\n\n2.10 Fraudulent emails\n\nPlease note that we will never send you an email requesting your Personal Data, for example password, credit card number or passport, personal identity card or social security number. If you receive any suspicious emails that look like they are from us but ask for your Personal Data, it is likely a fraudulent email or ‘phishing’. We recommend that you do not reply to the email or click onto any links or pop-up messages and report to the local authorities which handle fraudulent emails. If you believe ‘phishers’ have gained access to your Personal Data or financial information, we recommend that you change your password(s), alert your credit card service provider and bank and review credit card and bank account statements to check for unauthorised charges.\n\n2.11 Unsecure communication\n\nIt is important to note that all email communication is not secure. There is a risk inherent in the use of email. Please be aware of this and when requesting information or sending forms to us by email, or when using email or using any public computers/public Wifi, we recommend that you do not include any Personal Data or sensitive information including credit card details. Our email responses to you will not include any sensitive or confidential information. Please bear in mind that no security system or system of transmitting information over the internet is guaranteed to be secure.\n\n3. Internal Controls\n\nThis Statement and Policy is updated as required to reflect any changes in applicable laws and developments in best practice procedures. Further, we limit the access to your Personal Data and only share your Personal Data with our internal staff who are directly involved in the process of providing quality service to you.\n\n4. How we store and transmit Personal Data?\n\nAll Personal Data gathered is stored in our secure server and all practicable steps have been taken to ensure that your Personal Data is protected against unauthorised or accidental access, disclosure or alteration and to keep such Personal Data up to date. However, we cannot be held responsible for unauthorised or accidental access which is beyond our control.\n\n4.1 Our databases and operating & marketing systems\n\nWe store your Personal Data in our databases used by operation and marketing systems. These systems, owned and managed by us or by selected third party vendors, are carefully selected to secure your Personal Data. Systems with databases that will be storing credit card information are PCI compliant. We may also store other information such as your room, food and beverage, other preferences and transaction history. This information may be shared and/or used by our business units for research, understanding and analysing customer behaviour and customer profiling to enhance customers’ experience and communication with them prior to, during, and after the stay. Laws and regulations applicable to Personal Data protection vary by country, therefore we may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements.\n\n4.2 Contests\n\nFrom time-to-time, we may request Personal Data from you through contests. Participation in these contests is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose your Personal Data. They may include contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information gathered from contests will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Demographic information will be used for purposes of monitoring and improving your experience on our Websites.\n\nWe may co-sponsor some contests on our Websites with other companies. If you enter one of these contests, our co-sponsor may receive or collect your Personal Data. In such cases, we will tell you who is collecting your Personal Data, how our co-sponsor may use the information and how you can contact our co-sponsor.\n\n4.3 Secure transmission and storage of data\n\nWe treat all the Personal Data that you provide to us as confidential information. We use an industry standard for encryption over the internet, to protect your Personal Data. When you type in your Personal Data such as credit card details, it will be automatically encrypted and transferred over a SSL connection. This ensures that your Personal Data is encrypted as it travels over the internet. You will know that you are in a secure mode when the security icon (such as a lock) appears in the window browsers.\n\n4.4 Data transmission across international borders\n\nAs a global company, we endeavour to provide you with outstanding services. To achieve this goal, we have established a global network comprised of properties, offices, trusted service providers, and trained associates in locations where we operate, including Hong Kong, Mainland China, the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Germany, Austria and Czech Republic. The nature of our business and our operations require us to transfer your Personal Data to other group companies, properties, centres of operations, data centres, or service providers that may be located in countries outside of your own for the purposes mentioned in this Statement and Policy, including Hong Kong, Mainland China, the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Germany, Austria and Czech Republic. Although the data protection and other laws of these various countries may not be as comprehensive as those in your own country, we will take appropriate steps to ensure that your Personal Data is protected and handled as described in this Statement and Policy. Therefore, in addition to the implementation of this Statement and Policy, we will implement, where necessary appropriate measures, including contractual clauses, to secure the transfer of your Personal Data to recipients (which may be our internal or external parties) located in a country with a level of protection which may be different from the one existing in the country in which your Personal Data is collected.\n\nPlease note that we endeavour to deal only with responsible third parties, but we have no control over the acts of these third parties This Statement and Policy ceases to apply to any information which is disclosed to such third parties in accordance with this Statement and Policy and we assume no responsibility for the privacy protection provided by such third parties.\n\n4.5 Disclosure of information to third parties\n\nIn addition, we use the services of third party agents, such as email service providers and mail houses for the purpose of mailing materials to you. These parties are contractually prohibited from using your Personal Data for any purpose other than for the purpose specified in their respective contracts. We do provide non-Personal Data to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. We do not permit the sale of Personal Data to business units/entities not owned by, managed by, and/or affiliated with us for any use unrelated to our group operations or use of Personal Data by third party for their own purposes. We will implement, where necessary, appropriate measures, including contractual clauses, to secure the transfer of your Personal Data to the third party service providers located in a country with a level of protection though different from the one existing in the country in which your Personal Data is collected.\n\nHow we track your usage on our Websites\n\n5.1 Cookies\n\n“Cookies” are text files that we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. To understand site usage, improve the content and offerings on our Websites and enhance your experience on our Websites, some of our web pages may use cookies. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to our Websites), save your username and/or password in password-protected areas, and to offer you products, programmes, or services. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your Personal Data unless you choose to provide it to us by, for example, registering for one of our services. However, once you choose to furnish our Websites with your Personal Data, it may be linked to the data stored in the cookies.\n\nWe may have engaged some web analytics services providers (“Web Analytics Services Providers”) to design and provide us web analytics services. They may use small invisible images known as “web beacons” or “tracking pixels” (in the next point”) in their digital products and services when providing us those services. These web beacons are used to count the number of times something has been seen but are anonymous and do not contain or collect any of your Personal Data.\n\nOur Web Analytics Services Providers may also use cookies and similar technologies to make the information collected by the web beacons more useful. When you are viewing our Websites, a cookie is transferred to your browser by the web server and is stored on your computer. It can only be read by such web server that gave it to you. Similar technologies may operate in other digital products, services, email, and survey.\n\nCookies allow our Web Analytics Services Providers to recognize your browser or device and, for example, identify whether you have visited our Websites before, what you have previously viewed or clicked on, and how you found us. The information is anonymous and only used for statistical purposes. Such information allows us to track information, such as how many individual users we have and how often they visit our websites. It also helps us to analyze patterns of user activity and to develop a better user experience. For example, we might see that many people who viewed “Special Offer” also viewed “Local Guide” on our Websites.\n\nWeb analytics data and cookies cannot be used to identify you as they never contain your Personal Data such as your name or email address. However, if you have registered and signed in to your registered account with us, we may combine your Personal Data from your registration with the data we received from our Web Analytics Services Providers to analyze how you and our guests use our Websites in detail and, where you have opted in to receive communications from us, to send you email and other communications that might be of interest to you. The combined information may include information that is collected by the Web Analytics Services Providers while you are not signed in, and information that was collected using cookies and similar technologies before you registered or signed in. Where the combined information can be used to identify you, we use it in accordance with this Statement and Policy.\n\nWe also use cookies to assist in targeted advertising in the following ways:\n\nCookies may be placed on your device by our third party service providers which remember that you have visited a website in order to provide you with targeted advertising which is more relevant to you and your interests. This is often called online behavioural advertising (“OBA”) (also known as “behavioural targeting”, “remarketing”, ”retargeting” or ”interest based advertising”) and is done by grouping together shared interests based upon previous web browsing activity. Advertising may then be displayed to you when you visit our Websites or other websites, that are built with these third-party service providers’ advertising elements, which matches these interests. Your previous web browsing activity can also be used to infer things about you, such as your demographics (age, gender etc.). This information may also be used to make the advertising on any of these websites more relevant to you.\n\nPersonalised retargeting is another form of OBA that enables our advertiser partners to show you advertising based on your online browsing away from our Websites. For example, if you visited the website of a retail company you may start seeing advertisng from the same retail company displaying special offers or showing you the products that you were browsing when you come to our Websites. This allows companies to advertise to people who previously visited their website. These cookies will usually be dropped by third-party advertising networks.\n\nAlthough these cookies can track your visits around the web they don't know who you are. Without these cookies, online advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and your interests.\n\n5.2 Other third party cookies\n\nPlease note that on some pages of our Websites you may notice that cookies have been set that are not related to us or our authorised service providers. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Facebook, these service providers may set their own cookies on your web browser. These anonymous cookies may be set by that third party to track the success of their application or to customize their application to you. We do not control the use of these cookies and cannot access them due to the way that cookies work, as cookies can only be accessed by the party who originally set them. You should check with these third-party websites for more information about their cookies.\n\n5.3 How to control your cookies\n\nPlease remember that we do not use cookies to collect your Personal Data although, as explained above, we may combine information from your registration with the data we get from the Web Analytics Services Providers to analyse how you and our guests use our Websites and digital services and products in detail. These cookies are set to improve your experience on our Websites and enable you to benefit from specific features and set preferences.\n\n5.3.1 Managing cookies in your browser\n\nMost modern browsers will allow you to:\n\nSee what cookies you've got and delete them on an individual basis.\n\nBlock third party cookies.\n\nBlock cookies from particular sites.\n\nBlock all cookies from being set.\n\nDelete all cookies when you close your browser.\n\nYou should be aware that any preferences will be lost if you delete cookies. Ironically, this includes where you have opted out from cookies, as this requires an opt-out cookie to be set. You may also set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to do this), although doing so will affect your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionality, and access certain content on our Websites. Therefore, we do not recommend turning all cookies off. Also, many websites will not work properly if you block cookies completely. If you are primarily concerned about third party cookies generated by advertisers, you can turn these off separately.\n\n5.4 Pixel Tags\n\nWe and our third-party service providers may use pixel tags (also known as ‘clear gifs’, ‘beacon gifs’ etc.), tracking links and/or similar technology to:\n\nTrack customer response to our advertisements and website content;\n\nDetermine your ability to receive HTML-based email messages. Our email service provider includes a pixel tag, which they refer to as a ‘coded sensor’ in all of the HTML-based messages sent on our behalf. The sensor activates when the email message is opened and flags the email address of the user as one that is capable of receiving HTML-based email messages. This capability helps our service provider to send the email in a format you can read. The sensor does not collect or use any other information. If you cannot receive HTML, you will not receive a functioning sensor;\n\nKnow how many users open an email and allow our service provider to compile aggregated statistics about an email campaign for us; and\n\nAllow us to better target interactive advertising, enhance customer support and site usability, and provide offers and promotions that we believe would be of interest to you. Your Personal Data will not be collected apart from what you voluntarily provide us.\n\n5.5 Google Analytics\n\nGoogle analytics is a web analysis service provided by Google. Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of all domains owned by us (i.e. our Websites) and all websites pages under these domains to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services.\n\nGoogle may use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the advertising of its own advertising network. Please refer to Google’s privacy policy for more information.\n\n6.
