        "text": "Raffles Place MRT Station (NS26/EW14) is an underground cross-platform interchange station along the North South Line (NSL) and East West Line (EWL). It is located near Battery Road and D’Almeida Street.\n\nThe station opened along with City Hall in December 1987 and both stations serve as cross-platform interchanges between the North South Line and East West Line, allowing commuters to switch trains at the appropriate station without having to ascend or descend platform levels. Raffles Place station offers Eastbound EWL & Northbound NSL trains on the upper level, and Westbound EWL & Southbound NSL on the lower level.\n\nRaffles Place Station serves the financial district of the same name, at the mouth of the Singapore River. Named after the founder of modern Singapore, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, the area was at the heart of Singapore’s financial centre, with low-rise buildings housing mercantile offices, banks and trading companies in the past, which have made way for the tallest office buildings in Singapore. At street level, Raffles Place Park just above the station forms a green space nestled within Singapore’s iconic city landscape.\n\nBelow ground, a network of pedestrian underpasses connect the station to many nearby developments, hence the large number of exits. It also serves the subterranean Marina Bay Link Mall (Exit J), which extends further via an underground pedestrian mall network and eventually connects to DT17 Downtown station.\n\nFirst / Last Train Timings\n\nNorth South Line – (NS26) Raffles Place\n\nDestination First Train Last Train Weekdays & Sat Sun & Public Holidays Daily NS1 Jurong East 6:03am 6:28am 11:53pm NS7 Kranji – – 12:08am NS28 Marina South Pier 5:56am 6:21am 11:55pm East West Line – (EW14) Raffles Place\n\nDestination First Train Last Train Weekdays & Sat Sun & Public Holidays Daily EW1 Pasir Ris 5:59am 6:27am 12:08am Connecting to CG2 Changi Airport – – 11:24pm EW33 Tuas Link 6:00am 6:26am 11:58pm\n\nStation Layout\n\nL1 Street Level Bus stops, Taxi stand, pick-up/drop-off point B1 Shops Raffles Xchange, Retail Shops, Linkways to other exits B2 Ticket Concourse Faregates, Ticketing Service Kiosks, Passenger Service Centre, SimplyGo Ticket Office B3 Platform A East West Line towards EW1 Pasir Ris Platform B North South Line towards NS1EW24 Jurong East B4 Platform C East West Line towards EW33 Tuas Link Platform D North South Line towards NS28 Marina South Pier\n\nPlatforms\n\nNorth South Line & East West Line (B3):\n\nPlatform A: East West Line towards EW1 Pasir Ris via EW13NS25 City Hall (→)\n\nPlatform B: North South Line towards NS1EW24 Jurong East via NS25EW13 City Hall (→)\n\nNorth South Line & East West Line (B4):\n\nPlatform C: East West Line towards EW33 Tuas Link via EW15 Tanjong Pagar (←)\n\nPlatform D: North South Line towards NS28 Marina South Pier via NS27CE2TE20 Marina Bay (←)\n\nRaffles Place station has a total of four platforms, arranged in two stacked island platforms. The North South Line (NSL) and the East West Line (EWL) occupy two tracks each, enabling cross-platform interchange between lines. In particular, passengers arriving on the EWL from the West can conveniently transfer to the NSL towards Orchard and Toa Payoh by walking across the platform, and vice-versa for NSL (Southbound) to EWL (Westbound).\n\nConcourse\n\nThe station has a combined ticket concourse located at Basement 2.\n\nEscalators, stairs and lifts connect the concourse with the platforms below. There are escalators that lead to Basement 3 and others that lead straight to Basement 4, and commuters are advised to follow the signage to the correct escalator.\n\nCivil Defence shelter\n\nRaffles Place station is designated as a Civil Defence (CD) shelter, which will be activated in times of national emergency. Apart from reinforced construction, the station is designed and equipped with facilities to ensure the shelter environment is tolerable for all shelterees during shelter occupation. These facilities include protective blast doors, decontamination facilities, ventilation systems, power and water supply systems and a dry toilet system.\n\nGift of Art: “Symphony” by Rosa Serra\n\nDonated by City Developments Limited, 2024.\n\nThis art piece was originally commissioned by City Developments Limited for its flagship 280-metre skyscraper, Republic Plaza at Raffles Place, and is now located at the entrance of Raffles Place station. Symphony represents the changes in the city over time, resembling a person in motion and celebrates the people who have helped make Singapore a global city. The bottom sphere represents Singapore’s past achievements while the sphere above symbolises the country’s ambition for the future. Sculpted in bronze by renowned Spanish artist Rosa Serra, Symphony captures her signature fluid forms to express motion.\n\nStation Amenities\n\nPublic Toilets and Retail Shops at Raffles XChange (B1)\n\nATMs and Self-service Machines within the station\n\nTop Up Kiosks\n\nSimplyGo Ticket Office\n\nExits\n\nRaffles Place MRT station has 13 exits, some of which are surface exits and others linking to basement levels of adjacent buildings.
