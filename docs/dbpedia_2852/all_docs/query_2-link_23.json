        "text": "Orchard MRT Station (NS22/TE14) is an underground interchange station along the North South Line (NSL) and Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL). With the opening of TEL on 13 Nov 2022, it is the third interchange station connecting the NSL and TEL, the other two being Woodlands and Marina Bay. The station complex is located near the junction of Orchard Road, Paterson Road, and Orchard Boulevard.\n\nThe station was named after various orchards and plantations formerly located in this area. Orchard Station now serves the Orchard Road shopping belt, bringing rail connections to the retail and entertainment hub, with many shopping centres, hotels, office buildings and upscale condominiums in the vicinity. An underground pedestrian mall network connects the Basement 2 ticket concourse seamlessly to nearby developments.\n\nThe TEL station was originally targeted for completion and opening in Year 2021. However, it was delayed till 2022 as mentioned in the SMRT Operations Review 2020. TEL 3 opened for passenger service on 13 Nov 2022.\n\nFirst / Last Train Timings\n\nNorth South Line – (NS22) Orchard\n\nDestination First Train Last Train Weekdays & Sat Sun & Public Holidays Daily NS28 Marina South Pier 5:48am 6:13am 11:46pm NS1 Jurong East 6:11am 6:36am 12:02am NS7 Kranji – – 12:17am Thomson-East Coast Line – (TE14) Orchard\n\nDestination First Train Last Train Weekdays & Sat Sun & Public Holidays Daily TE1 Woodlands North 5:52am 6:12am 12:13am TE9 Caldecott – – 12:25am TE29 Bayshore 5:55am 6:15am 12:03am TE27 Marine Terrace – – 12:08am TE22 Gardens by the Bay – – 12:14am TE17 Outram Park – – 12:20am\n\nStation Layout\n\nL1 Street Level Bus stops, Taxi stand, Pick-up/drop-off points B1 Orchard Xchange Retail Shops Underpass Underpass at Exit 7 leading to ION Orchard Level 1 & Orchard Turn / TEL Ticket Concourse / NSL Ticket Concourse B2 NSL Ticket Concourse Faregates, Ticketing Service Kiosks, Passenger Service Centre (NSL), SimplyGo Ticket Office TEL Ticket Concourse Faregates, Ticketing Service Kiosks, Assisted Service Kiosks, Passenger Service Centre (TEL), Retail Shops B3 NSL Platform A North South Line towards NS1EW24 Jurong East NSL Platform B North South Line towards NS28 Marina South Pier TEL Platform C Thomson-East Coast Line towards TE29 Bayshore TEL Platform D Thomson-East Coast Line towards TE1 Woodlands North B4 Linkway to NSL/TEL Paid transfer link between TEL & NSL\n\nPlatforms & Train Services\n\nNorth South Line (B3):\n\nPlatform A: North South Line towards NS1EW24 Jurong East via NS21–DT11 Newton (→)\n\nPlatform B: North South Line towards NS28 Marina South Pier via NS23 Somerset (←)\n\nOrchard station has two underground NSL platforms in an island platform arrangement.\n\nThomson-East Coast Line (B3):\n\nPlatform C: Thomson-East Coast Line towards TE29 Bayshore via TE15 Great World (→)\n\nPlatform D: Thomson-East Coast Line towards TE1 Woodlands North via TE13 Orchard Boulevard (←)\n\nOrchard station has two underground Thomson-East Coast Line platforms in an island platform arrangement.

A pair of travelators at the paid link facilitates commuter flow between both rail lines. In addition, a set of escalators directly connects the TEL Ticket Concourse (B2) to the NSL Paid Link (B4) via an intermediate landing, bypassing the TEL Platform Level.\n\nTEL Art in Transit: “Orchard Road from ION Sky” by Mintio\n\nSee the lights of Orchard Road from the vantage point of ION Sky. When this image was created, ION Sky was the highest point in Orchard Road. Tracking in a south-east direction, the artist captured the night lights as a form of cartography (map-making) as well as mark-marking. With a panoramic camera and medium format photographic film, the lights were captured layer by layer, with multiple exposure. The multiple exposures render the bird’s-eye view of Orchard Road into abstraction, as if one is looking into the night sky, gazing at the stars.\n\nStation Amenities\n\nPublic Toilets at Orchard Xchange Level (B1)\n\nRetail Shops at NSL Orchard Xchange (B1) & TEL Ticket Concourse Level (B2)\n\nATMs and Self-service Machines at NSL Ticket Concourse unpaid areas (B2)\n\nTop Up Kiosks\n\nSimplyGo Ticket Office at NSL Ticket Concourse\n\nAssisted Service Kiosks at TEL Concourse\n\nWheelchair Accessible Toilet & Baby Care Room in paid areas at Linkway to NSL/TEL (B4)\n\nExits\n\nOrchard MRT station has 13 exits branching out from both NSL & TEL Ticket Concourses.
