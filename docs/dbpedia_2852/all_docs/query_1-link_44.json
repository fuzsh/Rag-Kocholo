        "text": "Are you traveling to Singapore and wondering where to stay? Then look no further; here, we give you the ultimate guide on where to stay in Singapore. It includes accommodation guides to Singapore’s most popular neighborhoods and our favorite hotel picks at all price ranges.\n\nIf you’re flying into Singapore straight from the US or Europe, it may at first feel like you have not traveled very far at all. On the surface, it is perhaps the most “non-Asian” of all Asian countries. The radio hosts speak English, the cab driver will insist that you wear your seatbelt, and prices are just as high as back home.\n\nBut dig a little beneath the surface, and Singapore will reveal its charm, diversity, and ethnic roots. Even though the island city-state of Singapore is quite small, it has many unique neighborhoods and a well of accommodations. Therefore, deciding where to stay in Singapore can feel a bit overwhelming.\n\nIt is almost like you are visiting several different countries and cultures just by walking between the different neighborhoods of Singapore. From the lively and colorful Little India to the charming hipster-like Kampong Glam, to the enormous shopping malls along Orchard Road, the impressively posh and futuristic Marina Bay, the bustling nightlife of the Quays, the beautiful colonial buildings of the Colonial District, and the kid-friendly entertainment and beach hub Sentosa Island with Universal Studios.\n\nWe first visited Singapore many years ago after finishing our studies in Australia as a stopover on the way to Norway. We immediately fell in love with this exciting city. We try to visit Singapore every time we are in Asia, which means almost every year, and we have stayed in many different hotels all over the city and at different price ranges.\n\nFor a while now, we have wanted to write more articles about Singapore. However, things can change fast, and we did not want to rely on past experiences. So, we booked a flight and spent a month in Singapore exploring the city like never before.\n\nOne of the results is this guide on where to stay in Singapore with all the little hotel gems we could find. Here we reveal what we think are the best areas to stay in Singapore and why. We have listed our favorite hotels at any budget for each area – Top-End, Mid-Range, and Budget.\n\nLatest Updates: We last visited Singapore in February 2024 to thoroughly update this guide to Singapore’s best hotels and areas. We wanted to see if our old hotel favorites were still going strong, and along the way, we also discovered some new favorites that we are excited to share with you! We have also added Katong, a new upcoming area that is quickly becoming popular with visitors.\n\nWhere To Stay In Singapore\n\nWhether you are looking for that once-in-a-lifetime luxury hotel, a small, intimate boutique hotel, a value-for-money mid-range hotel, or a budget guesthouse, Singapore has it all.\n\nYou must be warned, though, that Singapore is among the most expensive cities in Asia. Singapore has been dubbed the world’s most expensive city to live in for the fifth year in a row, which is also reflected in the hotel prices. However, in this guide, we will also reveal some good value options for your money, so there is no need to panic. 🙂\n\nSingapore is also the only major city where we have experienced landing at the airport, only to be told that the city’s hotels are all fully occupied and no rooms are available anywhere! Thankfully, it turned out to be a slight exaggeration, but there was a huge dentist conference in town, and every major hotel was full. We managed to find a place to stay in the end, but we had to pay far more than we had budgeted, and ever since then, we have always booked ahead when visiting Singapore.\n\nThe hotels recommended in this article are primarily places we have stayed at ourselves. However, to make this as complete and helpful a resource as possible, we have included some recommendations from travelers we know personally and whose opinions we trust.\n\nImportant: None of the hotels in this guide are paid placements or have sponsored our stay in any way. We have paid for these accommodations ourselves. If you book through any of our links, we earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. This helps keep our site going – so thank you in advance for your support! ♥\n\nWe hope you find this guide helpful in choosing the best place to stay in Singapore.\n\nSingapore’s 9 Best Areas To Stay In\n\nAlthough Singapore is rather small, 728.6 km², it has almost 6 million inhabitants from all over the world. The different neighborhoods have their own character, which reflects their people and culture in a unique way.\n\nWhere you base yourself matters, both when it comes to whether or not the attractions are within walking distance and if you have many different restaurants, cafes, and shops to choose from. That said, Singapore is a fairly easy city to get around in, both by taxi/ Grab and public transport like the metro and buses.\n\nWe have decided to divide Singapore into nine areas that are suitable for tourists and visitors to stay in.\n\nHere is an overview of Singapore`s nine most popular areas to stay in (updated in 2024):\n\nOrchard Road Area\n\nSingapore’s main shopping area. The whole street is lined with huge modern shopping malls. The most central area to stay in, you can walk to most of the main attractions. Several of the big international hotel chains are located here.\n\nColonial/ Historic District\n\nBeautiful old colonial buildings, museums, and art galleries. Here, you will find some of Singapore’s most iconic and luxurious hotels, like the Raffles.\n\nMarina Bay Area\n\nThe iconic Marina Bay Sands shopping mall and hotel are designed like a ship. Staying at the futuristic luxurious Marina Bay Sands Hotel is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, so if you can afford it – go for it!\n\nChinatown\n\nA unique historical area with a mix of Chinese architecture, temples, shops, cafes, and modern highrises in the nearby CBD. A wide range of upscale and mid-range hotels.\n\nBugis & Kampong Glam\n\nSingapore’s hippest area has plenty of cool coffee shops, cafes, restaurants, and pubs. Budget-friendly hotels and hostels are also available.\n\nThe Quays Area\n\nSingapore’s canal and river area is nightlife central, packed with restaurants, cafes, and bars. It is a fun area to stay in, with some fantastic hotels and nightlife.\n\nLittle India\n\nA vibrant area with lots of delicious Indian food. Budget-friendly hotels and hostels.\n\nSentosa Island\n\nThis kid-friendly area includes Universal Studios, the Singapore Aquarium, and a string of relaxing beaches. Sentosa offers a mix of large resort hotels and smaller elegant boutique hotels at a price.\n\nKatong\n\nBeautiful old shophouse architecture, a residential feel with cozy cafes and eateries, a seaside park, excellent hotels, and a brand-new MRT line makes Katong an up and coning area with visitors.\n\nRead on to find out where you want to stay when visiting Singapore. We have also listed our favorite hotels in each area below:\n\nThe 9 best areas to stay in Singapore: 1. Orchard Road, 2. Colonial/ Historic, 3. Marina Bay, 4. The Quays, 5. Bugis & Kampong Glam, 6. Chinatown, 7. Little India, 8. Sentosa Island, 9. Katong\n\n1. Orchard Road\n\nOrchard Road is home to what is arguably the world’s best upscale shopping district. Along the wide Orchard Road (2,5 km long), enormous modern shopping malls line both sides of the street. If you can’t find what you are looking for here, chances are you will not find it anywhere in the world.\n\nWhy stay in the Orchard Road area?\n\nTo sum it up in one word – shopping! Most visitors stay in the Orchard Road area for the shopping! From luxury fashion clothing brands to electronic and camera shops, Orchard is a shopper’s dream destination.\n\nBut there is more to Orchard than just shopping. Venture into the smaller side streets, and you will discover plenty of cool bars, restaurants, and a more relaxed atmosphere. We love walking along Emerald Hill Road with its beautiful, well-preserved heritage buildings.\n\nInside the shopping malls, you’ll find cinema multiplexes and plenty of restaurants, food courts, and cafes for that shopping break. Food courts are a particularly good value for money in a city famous for its high prices.\n\nIf you are a book lover like us, do not miss a visit to the Singapore branch of the Kinokuniya Book Store inside the Ngee Ann City Mall (on level 4). It is the world’s largest bookstore, and we have spent more hours than I care to admit digging for book treasures there.\n\nJust north of Orchard Road, you can escape the city´s hustle and bustle in the green lung Istana Park, where you will also find the President’s Residence.\n\nMRT lines connect the area well, and you are never far from the nearest station, making it easy to get around the rest of the city from here. There are currently four major MRT stations in the Orchard Road area: Orchard, Orchard Boulevard, Somerset, and Dhoby Ghaut MRT stations.\n\nThings to see and do in the Orchard Road area\n\nShopping, shopping, and some more shopping, as well as eating, are the main things to do in the Orchard Road area. It indeed is a shopping mecca! Orchard Road is one of the best shopping streets in Asia, maybe the best.\n\nCathay Gallery\n\nCathay Gallery is the perfect museum for us film nerds! Here you find cool old movie posters, local Singapore film history, and cameras.\n\nIstana Park\n\nA lovely little landscaped park of 13 km² that opened in 1996. Istana Park’s centerpiece is the Festival Arch (26 m tall), surrounded by a reflecting pool. The arch symbolizes the gateway to Orchard Road.\n\nIstana Heritage Gallery\n\nInside the park, the Istana Heritage Gallery (opened in 2017) showcases the history of Istana’s transition from being the Colonial Governor’s House to its present role as the President’s Official Residence. Here, you can see a range of heritage displays with state artifacts, artworks, and a collection of gifts presented by foreign countries to Singapore’s Presidents and Prime Ministers.\n\nION Orchard Mall\n\nSingapore´s top-notch mega mall. Check out its observation deck, ION Sky, on level 56, with an amazing view over the city.\n\nEat At Food Courts\n\nCheck out the many food courts in the Orchard Road area. Almost all the malls have one selling cheap, freshly cooked food from around the world. Our favorite food courts in Orchard are:\n\n– Takashimaya Food Village – At B2 in Takashimaya Department Store\n\n– Food Republic – At level 4 in Wisma Atria\n\n– Food Opera – At level B4 in ION Orchard Mall\n\nSingapore Botanic Gardens\n\nSingapore Botanic Gardens is the world’s only tropical garden declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is free to visit (with some exceptions) and is open daily from 05:00 a.m. until midnight. Our favorite part of the garden is the National Orchid Garden (last entry at 18:00/ 6 pm, ticket: 15 SG$).\n\nEmerald Hill Road\n\nGo for a walk and admire these beautiful heritage architectural buildings. Some popular and cozy bars are also in the old renovated shophouses near Orchard Road.\n\nWhat’s the catch?\n\nOrchard Road gets busy, particularly on the weekends and holidays, and while there are plenty of cinemas, the nightlife is a little limited.\n\nThe hotel prices here are on the higher end, and there are very few hostels and cheap hotels for budget travelers.\n\nWhere To Stay Around Orchard Road\n\nThere are plenty of quality hotels around Orchard including from the top international hotel chains. Some of our favorites include:\n\nTop End\n\nFour Seasons Hotel\n\nThe Four Seasons Hotel has been one of Singapore’s classic five-star hotels for thirty years, but since completing its refurbishment a few years back, it’s looking better than ever. It has everything a top-notch five-star hotel should have: great service, excellent food (two restaurants and a lobby bar), beautiful rooms, a well-equipped gym, and a stunning rooftop swimming pool on the 20th floor. There are even two outdoor tennis courts!\n\nThe Four Seasons is centrally located on Orchard Road, in the middle of everything. Staying here, you’re within easy walking distance of all the shopping, cinemas, cafes, and restaurants. You can easily access the MRT/ trains to get around the rest of Singapore. It is by far one of the best and most luxurious hotels in Singapore.\n\nClick for latest prices\n\nGoodwood Park Hotel\n\nThe Goodwood Park Hotel is one of Singapore’s grand old heritage hotels with a lot of history. Walking onto the grand grounds, we felt we were stepping back in time. Although the hotel is newly renovated, they have kept the old and grand vibe and decor.\n\nThe building dates back to 1900 and was built as the headquarters for The German Gentlemen’s Club. Everything from the lobby to the restaurant and the room design is super elegant and classy! The hotel oozes old-world colonial charm, from the lush landscaped garden, marble tiles, and colonial architecture to the wide stairways.\n\nThe hotel has only three floors with a mix of modern and heritage rooms. We stayed in Heritage Room no. 4 on the 2nd floor, which was spacious (31 sqm) and designed with warm, elegant colors in a classic style. The bed was super comfortable.\n\nMaria enjoyed soaking in the classic bathtub and the small luxuries like toiletries by Salvatore Ferragamo. On the downside, the bathroom did not have a separate shower, meaning you must stand in the tub when showering.\n\nWe were also a bit unlucky, as some teenagers had booked the neighboring room and were throwing a birthday party. These old buildings don’t exactly have the best soundproofing, so if you’re a light sleeper, this is something to consider.\n\nWe loved the swimming pool on the ground floor, set in a green and lush garden with plenty of sunbeds, perfect for relaxation. The hotel also has studio apartments with a kitchen available. The hotel’s L’Espresso Cafe serves a popular English-style afternoon tea buffet from 11 until 19, which is worth checking out even if you are not staying there. The Goodwood Park Hotel has a great location, and Orchard Road is just a 5-minute walk away.\n\nClick for latest prices\n\nArtyzen Singapore\n\nThe new kid on the block is the five-star Artyzen Hotel (which opened in late 2023)! We’ve watched the highrise slowly take shape during the building process, and the tower’s unique design, with its many stacked gardens spiraling upwards, is striking!\n\nThe hotel is built on the former site of Villa Marie, an old heritage mansion built in the 1940s. The new hotel’s design (by Singapore architects ONG&ONG) is inspired by the old villa. They had the idea of stacking multiple villas on top of each other, each with its own lush green garden. This unique design gives guests easy access to lush green gardens throughout the hotel.\n\nArt adores every corner of the hotel, from the artwork in the lobby to the elevator’s backdrop depicting Singapore’s historic shophouses. The rooms are beautifully designed with eye-catching artwork, including headboards embroidered with motives from Singapore’s Peranakan legacy.\n\nThe spacious rooms, starting at 48 sqm, have high arched ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city. Modern hotel comforts include a huge 55-inch flat-screen TV, a Nespresso coffee machine, a fully stocked minibar, 24-hour room service, and a balcony.\n\nThe luxurious bathrooms have a rainforest shower with Heeley Paris shower products and a grand bathtub. If you opt for a Terrace Suite, you’ll even have your private tropical garden!\n\nOn the fifth floor is the wellness area. It includes a 24/7 fitness center, a luxurious spa, and daily guided meditation and yoga classes. Take the elevator up to the top floor, and you’ll find the rooftop terrace garden. Enjoy a drink or a snack at the bar, relax on one of the many sunbeds, or swim in the 25-meter-long infinity pool with spectacular views.\n\nThe hotel is on the quiet Cuscaden Road, within walking distance of Orchard Road and the Botanical Gardens. A complimentary chauffeur service will drive you anywhere within a mile of the hotel.\n\nClick For Latest Prices\n\nShangri-La Hotel\n\nThe luxurious Shangri-La Hotel is located at the west end of Orchard Road, right in the middle of all the amazing shopping opportunities Singapore offers.\n\nWhat sets the Shangri-La Hotel apart is that the hotel grounds and garden cover an incredible six hectares of tropical gardens in the middle of the city! Inside this green oasis, you’ll find a gorgeous swimming pool, a pond with a small waterfall, orchids galore, and plenty of palm trees.\n\nThe hotel has three distinctly different wings from which to choose. Staying in one of the rooms in the bungalow villa-styled oasis Garden Wing is like staying at a resort. The Tower Wing has newly renovated rooms, each with a unique theme. The exclusive Valley Wing is for those who want the most exclusive, private stay possible. The American president chose to stay at Shangri-La during the summit with North Korea’s leader in 2018.\n\nClick for latest prices\n\nMid Range\n\nJEN Singapore Orchardgateway by Shangri-La\n\nOh boy, what an infinity swimming pool the JEN Singapore Orchardgateway Hotel has! It must be one of the best in Singapore! It is huge and located on the rooftop with an excellent view of Singapore’s skyline. And it is open until 23:00, so it’s the perfect place to enjoy a drink or a swim under the stars. We ♥ it!\n\nThere are no less than three pools, including a children’s pool! And unlike most hotels we’ve ever stayed at, a lifeguard is on duty.\n\nWe had only booked two nights at the JEN Singapore Orchardgateway Hotel, but we liked it so much that we extended our stay. This is one of our favorite hotels in Singapore.\n\nThe location of the JEN Singapore Orchardgateway Hotel is perfect! The hotel is located on the upper floors of the Orchard Gateway Mall on Orchard Rd (the reception is on the 10th floor of the mall).\n\nThe Orchard Gateway Mall also houses the MRT Somerset Station, which is convenient for getting around Singapore. Just take the hotel elevator down, and you are in the middle of all the restaurants and shops that Orchard Gateway Mall, Orchard Central Mall, and 313 Somerset Mall have to offer (they are all connected).\n\nBehind the hotel is a street called Killiney Rd, with cozy and cheap restaurants serving delicious Indian, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Malaysian food. It’s great for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\nOur room was big, comfortable, modern, and extremely quiet. We could not hear anything from our neighbors or the cleaning staff in the morning. The internet was fast and free. And the hotel even has a robot (!), the cute Jeno, which delivers room service food, etc. We called reception and asked for some water, and Jeno, the robot, came to our rescue. 🙂\n\nClick for latest prices\n\nQuincy Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality\n\nThis boutique hotel is a budget-friendly option close to Orchard Road (just a 7-minute walk away) and is located on a quiet side street. We booked a Premier Room, which was spacious (32 sqm) and comfortable, with a great city view (our room was on the 14th floor). I loved relaxing on the sofa by the window and enjoying the view.\n\nThe hotel offers plenty of free perks, which makes this hotel a good deal. We especially enjoyed the free drinks (2 glasses of beer, wine, or mocktails each) and delicious canapes between 18/ 6 pm and 20/ 8 pm every evening.\n\nThere is also 24-hour lounge access with complimentary light refreshments like tea, coffee, sodas, snacks, and fruits in the cafe by the reception.\n\nThe mini-bar is complimentary, and you can choose what items to stock it with from a selection of drinks and snacks!\n\nOn check-in, we got free ice cream sandwiches from Sinapore’s local ice cream brand, The Ice Cream & Cookie Co. We chose Mint Chocolate, which was delicious!\n\nWe also highly appreciated the excellent Wi-Fi, which was super fast —300/220Mbit! We could stream all the movies and series we wanted.\n\nThe 12th floor has a swimming pool, gym, lounge area, and sauna. The pool is, however, shaded under a roof, so it is not ideal for sunbathing. However, there are a few sunbeds next to the pool. On the plus side, the pool is open 24/7, which is awesome!\n\nWe found the complimentary breakfast very tasty and loved that we could order it until 3 pm/15:00! This is awesome if you want to sleep in a bit and get over the jetlag. We had breakfast after checking out at 12:00, which was so convenient. I had the avocado toast with smoked salmon and porched eggs—so good!\n\nAll in all, Quincy is a great hotel with lots of awesome free perks, great service, and high-class food!\n\nClick for latest prices\n\n2. Colonial / Historic District\n\nWhy stay in the Colonial/ Historic area?\n\nThis is our favorite area to stay in Singapore as it is very central and has easy access to Singapore’s other areas. From here, you can easily walk to the bars and restaurants in the Quay area and Marina Bay, enjoy the delicious street food in Bugis & Kampong Glam area or Little India, and get to Orchard Road with all the great shopping.\n\nThe area has many beautiful architectural masterpieces and classic buildings and is lovely to explore on foot. Should you tire of the city, Fort Canning Park, one of central Singapore’s finest parks, is perfect for a run or an afternoon walk among the tall trees.\n\nSingapore has some of the world’s finest museums and galleries, most of which are located in the colonial area. The iconic National Museum and the National Gallery are located here.\n\nThe area has several MRT stations and two lines (from City Hall Station), making traveling throughout the rest of Singapore easy.\n\nThings to see and do in the Colonial/ Historic District\n\nBattle Box at Fort Canning Park\n\nBattle Box is an underground bunker with 30 rooms built inside the hill as a commando central. In 1942, the decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese was made here. Today, the bunker (formerly the Underground Far East Command Centre) is known as Battle Box. You can join an organized tour of the bunker.\n\nNational Museum of Singapore\n\nThe National Museum of Singapore is Singapore’s oldest museum, dating back to 1849 when it was called Raffles Library and Museum. It is housed in a beautiful old colonial-style building, and here you can learn everything about Singapore and its history and culture. They also have special exhibitions and events. We joined a guided tour, and it was great! They run English-guided tours on Monday – Friday at 11:00 am and 14:00 and Saturday – Sunday at 11:00, 14:00, and 15:00.\n\nNational Gallery Singapore\n\nThe National Gallery Singapore has the largest collection of modern Southeast Asian art in the world. But here you also find the biggest collection of Italian Renaissance paintings (outside of Italy). Including paintings by European masters from the 15th to the 19th century, such as Turner, Leonardo, Velázquez, Titian, Constable, Botticelli, Monet, Caravaggio, and Vermeer. The top three most popular paintings at the National Gallery Singapore are van Eyck’s Arnolfini Portrait, Holbein’s Ambassadors, and Van Gogh’s Sunflowers. We also loved the photography exhibitions at the gallery.\n\nBuy your tickets to National Gallery online here, and skip the ticket line.\n\nFort Canning Park\n\nFort Canning Park is beautifully situated on a hill and has a fascinating history. Here was once the center of Ancient Singpura (in the 14th century) and housed the palace of the King. Centuries later, this is where the Union Flag was hoisted to mark the signing of The Singapore Treaty with Stamford Raffles and the birth of Singapore. Later, in 1823, Raffles built his residence on the hill. He also established Singapore’s first botanical garden on the hillside. Later, in 1861, Fort Canning was built on top of the hill to defend the harbor. The fort was, however, a failure and was demolished in 1907. Today, you can see the gateway of the fort and two nine-pound cannons here. By the way, don’t miss visiting the Thiong Bahru bakery located just inside the park!\n\nRaffles Hotel\n\nThe stunning British-colonial-style luxury hotel Raffles was first built in 1830 as a beach house. It became a hotel in 1878. The Raffles Hotel underwent a major two-year renovation and reopened in 2019, with all 115 rooms refurbished and soundproofed. Head to Raffles’s historic Long Bar for its famous Singapore Sling drink.\n\nSt Andrew’s Cathedral\n\nThe beautiful white Neo-Gothic architectural style of St Andrew’s Cathedral is a centerpiece of the district. It was first built in 1836 before being struck and destroyed by lightning twice (!) in 1852. Today’s church building was constructed between 1856 and 1861. The church was used as an emergency hospital during World War II, after the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. Saint Andrew’s Cathedral was declared a Singaporean National Monument in 1973 and is a fantastic sight to visit.\n\nWhat’s the catch?\n\nThe central district is not an area with much action; it is quiet, especially in the evening after 22:00. The accommodations here are quite expensive, and there are very few budget or hostel options.\n\nWhere To Stay in Singapore’s Colonial/ Historical District\n\nTop End\n\nRaffles Hotel\n\nSingapore’s most famous hotel, the iconic Raffles Hotel, is open again after being closed for years for a complete renovation. The beautiful white colonial-era building and the lush green garden have been beautifully restored, and the Raffles Hotel appears again in all its glory.\n\nThis is as old-world luxury as you can get, and no other hotel in Singapore can match its historical nostalgia. Here is the Long Bar, where the now world-famous Singapore Sling drink was created in 1915. Legends such as Ernest Hemingway, Charlie Chaplin, and Michael Jackson have all stayed at the Raffles.\n\nThe beautifully renovated spacious suites (the smallest is 45 sqm!) have maintained their classic, elegant colonial style with high ceilings, teak wood floors, oriental rugs, balconies, and four-poster beds while adding every modern comfort you’d expect at a modern five-star hotel. The service is world-famous, with a 24-hour butler service that has perfected the art of always being discretely available.\n\nPamper yourself at the spa, spend a day by the gorgeous tropical garden swimming pool, or treat yourself to Raffles’s famous Afternoon Tea service served in The Grand Lobby. With eight in-house restaurants, bars, and cafes, there is no shortage of dining options.\n\nLocation-wise, you’re right in the city’s heart, five minutes away from Raffles Mall and the MRT station, and within easy walking distance of all the sights in the Colonial district.\n\nStaying at the Raffles Hotel is by no means cheap, but it’s a true classic, a one-of-a-kind luxury hotel for that once-in-a-lifetime special holiday or celebration!\n\nClick for latest prices\n\nPullman Singapore Hill Street\n\nSinagpore’s newest five-star hotel celebrated its grand opening in October 2023 and has received rave reviews ever since. We haven’t had a chance to stay here yet, but it’s definitively on our list for our next Singapore visit! With 350 guest rooms and suites, this is the brand’s new flagship hotel.\n\nThe hotel’s design is a nostalgic love letter to Pullman’s roots as a 19th-century luxury railroad provider. It looks gorgeous, from the stylish lobby with classic artwork to the well-appointed, relaxing guestrooms. Deluxe Room sizes start at 25 sqm, which is on the smaller side for five-stars in Singapore, but if you need extra space, more spacious King rooms are also available.\n\nThere are two large swimming pools, but the real standout is the rooftop pool, which has a fantastic view across Singapore Harbour. The gym is open 24/7, modern, and well-equipped, including gear for more functional training.\n\nSingapore landmarks such as Fort Canning Park, St Andrews Cathedral, and the National Gallery surround the hotel, putting you in the heart of the historic colonial district. The City Hall MRT Station is a five-minute walk away, making it easy to explore the city.\n\nClick For Latest Prices\n\nSwissotel The Stamford\n\nThe 5-star Swissotel The Stamford is in a perfect location in the heart of central Singapore. It is just next to the Raffles City Market (connected at level 3 of the hotel), which has many shops and eateries. The nearest MRT station is just a few steps from the hotel and has a direct line to Changi Airport.\n\nThe hotel is Singapore’s tallest and one of South East Asia’s tallest at 226 meters. All 1252 guest rooms have private balconies and breathtaking city and harbor views. On a clear day, you can see all the way to Malaysia and Indonesia from the upper floors!\n\nThe hotel underwent a full refurbishment a few years ago, and all guest rooms are now updated and refreshed with modern comfort and thoughtful touches like free Nespresso and TWG tea. Although the hotel is in a busy area, the rooms are soundproofed and quiet.\n\nThe hotel has two large circular swimming pools set in a green garden on the sixth floor. There is also a well-equipped fitness center and a staggering six (!) tennis courts.\n\nEven if you’re not staying here, the SKAI restaurant and bar on the 70th floor is worth a visit for its fantastic 360-degree view of Singapore!\n\nClick for latest prices\n\nMid Range\n\nCitadines Connect City Centre Hotel\n\nThe 4-star Citadines Connect Hotel is like a breath of fresh air centrally located in the historic district of Singapore. When it opened its doors in July 2022, we knew we had to check it out on our next Singapore trip.\n\nWe booked a Deluxe Queen Room (18 sqm) and got one on the 4th floor. They also have some really cute loft rooms, which are a bit larger. Our room was fresh, new, stylish, compact with a smart layout, and had a cool 60’s vibe.\n\nThe complimentary minibar with free chips, soda, water, and juice was a nice surprise. The bed was very comfortable, and our room also had a large flat-screen TV, a sofa and table, an ironing board, and slippers, although no robes.\n\nUnfortunately, we checked into the hotel pretty late in the evening, as we arrived by bus from Melaka in Malaysia. We immediately headed up to the rooftop swimming pool where the hotel’s restaurant is located – the Edition Rooftop Bar & Restaurant (open 07:00 – 02 at night). It is such a cozy little restaurant and bar, where Espen had a delicious hamburger, and I had a tasty pasta bolognese and some wine.\n\nThe next day, we got to try out the rooftop swimming pool, open from 07 until 21. It’s a nice place to hang out and relax, with sunbeds and seating groups. There is a small gym next to the pool. Some of the gym equipment (like the rowing machine) is actually in the pool, which they call Aqua Gym! The first time we have seen that in a hotel.\n\nThe cozy cafe downstairs serves a fusion of European and Japanese food (open 08:30 – 17:30). We did not get to try it out as we walked over to the Tiong Bahru Bakery in the neighboring Fort Canning Park to grab some lunch instead.\n\nThe hotel is conveniently located next to Fort Canning Park, with Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station just across the road (a 3-minute walk, exit B). The National Museum is just a 10-minute walk from the hotel, and you can easily walk to the shopping malls on Orchard Road in 10 minutes or so.\n\nThis hotel is a great choice if you want to do our recommended Singapore itinerary. The starting point of Day 1 of the itinerary (Singapore breakfast at Killiney Kopitiam) is just a 9-minute walk from Citadines Connect City Centre Hotel. This is one of the cheapest hotels in this central area of Singapore and is such a great value.\n\nClick here for the latest prices\n\nRendezvous Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality\n\nWith an excellent location just opposite the road from the Bencoolen MRT Station and on a side street from the National Museum of Singapore, the Rendezvous Hotel was a positive surprise for us. Although the Rendezvous Hotel is not the newest in town, it was completely refurbished in 2018. We think it offers good value in a central and otherwise expensive location.\n\nWe stayed here for three nights and found the hotel very conveniently located. It is within walking distance of the shopping on Orchard Road.\n\nOur favorite was the hotel’s swimming pool in the lovely little garden on the 3rd floor. We loved chilling out here after shopping in Orchard Road. There is also a gym on the same floor.\n\nWe stayed in a Superior Double Room, which was spacious (26 sqm) and clean. Although the interior design of our room was not the most modern, it had its cozy charm, and we had a modern Samsung TV.\n\nThere are some restaurants and cafes, including a 7-Eleven in the hotel’s basement and a Foodrepublic food court with lots of excellent and cheap food just opposite the road. We had lunch there several times, and the food was delicious. It is easy to get to the Rendezvous Hotel from Changi Airport by bus no. 36, which stops right outside the hotel.\n\nClick for the latest prices\n\n3. Marina Bay\n\nIf you continue east along the river from the Quay area, you will get to the booming, modern, futuristic Marina Bay.\n\nIt is home to some of Singapore’s biggest landmarks and attractions like Marina Bay Sands (the big skyscraper that seems to support a gigantic ship), the Merlion Statue (a mythical creature created by the tourism board of Singapore in the 1980s, a half fish, half lion), Gardens by the Bay (a breathtaking futuristic botanic garden with Supertrees straight out of the movie Avatar), and Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay (an architectural masterpiece with theater performances and concerts).\n\nIf you don´t plan to stay in this area, visiting here is a must! Make sure to be at Gardens by the Bay at 19:45 or 20:45 when the Supertrees glow and perform a spectacular light and music show. Also, the 15-minute light and music show in front of the Marina Bay Sands is amazing! It is played every evening at 20:00 and 21:00. On Fridays and Saturdays, there is an extra show at 22:00.\n\nWhy stay in the Marina Bay area?\n\nThe hotels in this area have a great view of the bay and the city. You will find some of Singapore’s biggest and most luxurious hotels in Marina Bay. It is a beautiful area overlooking the harbor. This area is quite central, and you can easily walk to many of Singapore’s top attractions.\n\nThings to see and do in Marina Bay\n\nGardens By The Bay\n\nVisiting the ultra cool “Avatar Trees” park and futuristic botanic gardens are our favorite thing to do in Singapore. It is a must-visit! The garden consists of two domes: Flower Dome (the world’s largest greenhouse) and Cloud Forest (with the world’s largest indoor waterfall at 35 meters tall). The Supertree Observatory (where you get to go up into the artificial trees) is also fantastic! Read all about why we love Gardens By The Bay so much here.\n\nBuy your tickets online here, and skip the ticket line.\n\nMarina Bay Sands\n\nThis “ship”-designed Marina Bay Sands hotel and gigantic shopping mall is the icon of Singapore, and you cannot avoid noticing this out-of-the-world futuristic building right by the harbor.\n\nCheck out the Marina Bay Sands Observation Deck (on the 57th floor) with the most awesome infinity pool (the pool can unfortunately only be used by guests staying at the hotel) and view of the city. Buy tickets online here, and avoid the ticket line.\n\nThe Merlion Statue\n\nAs you go for a stroll around the harbor area of Marina Bay, you will notice this white statue spitting water. The Merlion Statue is a mythical creature created by the tourism board of Singapore in the 1980s. It is white, half fish and half lion, and has become the symbol of Singapore. Taking a selfie with The Merlion is a must-do.\n\nHelix Bridge\n\nThe Helix Bridge (or just The Helix) is a pedestrian bridge linking Marina Centre with Marina South. You have a great view of the Singapore skyline on the bridge.\n\nArtScience Museum\n\nThe ArtScience Museum looks like a giant white lotus from the outside. Inside, however, this cool museum connects art, media, design, technology, and science. They had a Marvel Studios exhibition when we visited, which was awesome.\n\nEsplanade\n\nSingapore’s main theater and concert hall, the Esplanade runs theaters, music shows, concerts, and workshops every day.\n\nWhat’s the catch?\n\nMarina Bay is a costly area; everything from hotels and food to activities is on the upper end of the money scale. There are no budget or even mid-range accommodation options here.\n\nWhere To Stay in Marina Bay\n\nTop End\n\nMarina Bay Sands\n\nWith its iconic shape of a ship and the fact that you can see it from all over Singapore, Marina Bay Sands must be Singapore’s most easily recognizable hotel. It has everything that one would expect from 5-star accommodation.\n\nThe rooms are great, spacious, and spotless, but the infinity pool is the real star of this hotel. The view from this pool on the 54th floor is AMAZING!\n\nThere is so much to do at this hotel that you don’t necessarily have to leave it at all. It has a huge mall with a casino, a water ride (yep, the mall has an indoor canal with boats), several restaurants, a club, a bar, and everything you need! Staying at the Marina Bay Sands is a once-in-a-lifetime experience you will never forget. If you can afford it, go for it!\n\nClick for latest prices\n\nParkroyal Collection Marina Bay\n\nThe Parkroyal’s interior is as stylish as if taken from an interior design magazine! The reception is on the 4th floor, along with a cafe, bar, and restaurant. This area is popular with local photographers, and we ran into several wedding couples having their wedding photos taken among the trees. I love the design of this hotel, with its big, airy reception area and lots of greenery, making the hotel a greenish jungle-like experience.\n\nThe building housing Parkroyal Collection Marina Bay was once the Marina Mandarin Hotel. It underwent a complete renovation and rebranding before it reopened in December 2020.\n\nWe had booked a Signature Marina Bay room and got one on the 13th floor with A-M-A-Z-I-N-G views of Singapore Harbor, the iconic Marina Bay Sands, and the Gardens by the Bay! We even had a small balcony, perfect for taking photos of the water and light show Spectra (every evening at 20:00 and 21:00, Fridays and Saturdays also at 22:00).\n\nOur room was quite large (32 sqm) and super comfy (the beds were heavenly good, and the blinds completely darkened the room). The bathroom was also spacious, with a bathtub, a separate shower, and a bide. A nice touch was the separate tap with filtered drinking water.\n\nThe TV was gigantic, and the room had a workspace/ desk, an electric water kettle, and a Nespresso capsule coffee machine. We don’t usually order room service, but the menu was very tempting, with a large selection of food and drinks. Thankfully, the food turned out to be excellent!\n\nThere is also a big swimming pool, a well-equipped gym (including a bike spin room) where you can book a personal trainer and a spa on the 5th floor. The pool area is like a large open terrace with a cozy bar/ cafe (the Skyline Bar) and many sun beds, sitting groups, and lounge beds.\n\nThe hotel has one of the best locations, close to Marina Bay and the Historic district of Singapore. The National Gallery is, for instance, only a 10-minute walk from the hotel. And if you get hungry for delicious hawker food, the Makansutra Gluttons Bay food night market is just on the other side of the road. The breakfast buffet is excellent, with plenty of options.\n\nClick here for the latest prices\n\nThe Fullerton Bay Hotel\n\nThe Fullerton Bay Hotel, currently ranked as the number one Singapore hotel by travelers on Tripadvisor, offers pure luxury in a great riverfront location. The pool is terrific, and the staff is friendly and professional, always on hand with cool and wet face towels, iced water, lychee lollies, and chilled fruit.\n\nApart from the high price, this is close to the perfect hotel. Everything from the lovely rainfall shower in the bathroom to the bathrobes (I love fluffy hotel bathrobes!), which are the softest and fluffiest I have ever tried!\n\nThe breakfast is superb (try the pancakes!). An evening visit to the rooftop Lantern bar for a glass of champagne and a view of the Marina is a must!\n\nClick for latest prices\n\nHotel Telegraph\n\nNote that the Hotel Telegraph is closed until September 2024 for renovations! We’ll share more details as soon as possible. Bookings are however open from September onwards.\n\nThis 5-star luxury boutique hotel is located in a beautifully restored old heritage building from 1927. Singapore’s oldest architectural firm designed it, and the building used to house Singapore’s telecommunication company, therefore the hotel name.\n\nIn 2022, it was fully refurbished and turned into this lovely hotel. With its 134 rooms, Hotel Telegraph is a member of the prestigious Small Luxury Hotels of the World.\n\nWe booked the smallest room, the Cosy Room (24 sqm), and loved the design. They have kept the heritage “look,” yet it is still fresh and modern. The ceiling was particularly cool, and I loved the wooden floor. The complimentary minibar filled with juice, water, and snacks is a welcome touch.\n\nThe rooftop swimming pool was one of our favorite parts of the hotel. The pool area was relaxing, with a good vibe and a cool bar.\n\nLocation is key to this hotel, as it is within walking distance of Chinatown, the Central Business District (CBD), Marina Bay, and the Quays. The Metro station is also only a 5-minute walk away.\n\nThe famous hawker center, Lau Pa Sat (with its iconic Victorian area-style roof), and popular Satay Street are just across the road from the hotel. The concierge was fabulous and made us feel right at home.\n\nClick for the latest prices\n\n4. Chinatown & Central Business District (CBD)\n\nChinatown lies in the shadow of the ever-expanding Central Business District (CBD) with its tall skyscrapers packed with offices. The houses in Chinatown are much lower, more like three to four stories tall, and many have been beautifully preserved.\n\nAlthough Chinatown has some beautiful temples, it lacks world famous attractions and sights. However, in our opinion, the neighborhood’s atmosphere and delicious food are enough reasons to stay and visit this area of Singapore. You can find everything from cheap hawker food to top-notch fancy restaurants serving food from all over the world.\n\nWhy stay in the Chinatown area?\n\nIf you stay in Chinatown, you’ll be in the middle of the action. Wander the streets and admire the beautiful temples, historic Peranakan-style shophouses, and gorgeous street art. You’re rarely far from one of Chinatown’s many fantastic eateries. As night sets, head to Ann Siang Rd and Club Street, filled with bars, restaurants, and great nightlife.\n\nChinatown is one of Singapore’s most atmospheric areas, with its old Chinese medicine shops, markets, and hawker food centers.\n\nRegarding accommodation, Chinatown has many options, from high-priced, top-end boutique hotels to budget hostels. It is the perfect place to stay for backpackers seeking cheap accommodation, business travelers working in the nearby Central Business District (CBD), and those who want to see the cultural sights and explore the roots of Singapore.\n\nSeveral MRT stations (Chinatown Station, Telok Ayer Station, Outram Park Station, Tanjong Pagar Station, and Raffles Place Station) make this area a great place to stay for quickly getting around the city.\n\nThings to see and do in Chinatown\n\nChinatown Street Market\n\nThe Chinatown street market is set along Pagoda Street, Trengganu Street, Sago Lane, Smith Street, and Temple Street. It is mostly a day market, and most stalls close around 20/ 8 pm. Here, you can find souvenirs, clothes, and some handicrafts.\n\nChinatown Heritage Centre\n\nThe Chinatown Heritage Centre is a lovely museum that explains the history and culture of Chinatown using old photos and the personal stories of the families that used to live there.\n\nBuddha Tooth Relic Temple\n\nThe Buddha Tooth Relic Temple was completed in 2007 and houses what is claimed to be Buddha’s tooth relic. The tooth is 7,5 cm long, so way too long for any human. You can view the tooth on the 4th floor of the temple. The temple is huge and consists of four stories. You will find a theatre and a dining hall in the basement (vegetarian meals only, which are free, but a donation is welcome).\n\nThian Hock Keng Temple & Mural Street Art\n\nThian Hock Keng Taoist Temple is Singapore’s oldest Chinese temple, built in 1839. It is stunning and a grand example of traditional Southern Chinese architecture. We love the temples’ small details, the beautiful carvings, and statues of dragons, deities, phoenixes, and other creatures. The temple has been declared a Singaporean National Monument.\n\nAlso, you cannot avoid noticing the fantastic 44-meter-long mural on the outside rear wall of the Thian Hock Keng Temple. It was made by the Singaporean artist Yip Yew Chong and tells the story of Singapore’s early Hokkien immigrants.\n\nSri Mariamman Hindu Temple\n\nThe Sri Mariamman Hindu Temple was founded in 1827 by the government clerk Naraina Pillai from Penang. He first arrived in Singapore with Sir Stamford Raffles (the founder of Singapore) and started Singapore’s first construction company and textile trading. He quickly became the leader of Singapore’s Indian community. The temple is so colorful and full of details. It is declared a Singaporean National Monument.\n\nSingapore City Gallery\n\nAt Singapore City Gallery you can learn about Singapore’s impressive urban development over the last 50 years and the philosophy behind creating this modern and futuristic city. The gallery also shows future plans for Singapore. We love how they have managed to make the exhibitions interactive and fun. It was also fun getting an overview of the entire city center of Singapore on the scale replica (you find it on the second floor).\n\nAnn Siang Rd and Club Street\n\nThe two streets, Ann Siang Road and Club Street, are the perfect place to head for dinner and a drink at a rooftop bar. The streets are lined with beautifully restored old Chinese shophouses, which now house restaurants, cafes, shops, fitness studios, and bars. Here, you will find some of the best restaurants and bars in Singapore.\n\nWhat’s the catch?\n\nIt can be a crowded and noisy area, especially in the evenings and weekends when many tourists head to Chinatown for the nightlife.\n\nWhere To Stay in Chinatown / CBD District\n\nTop End\n\nThe Clan Hotel\n\nFrom the minute we walked into The Clan Hotel entrance and were greeted by the concierge, we knew we would like this hotel. The friendly service and the stunning and delicate interior made us feel like we were back in Japan! After check-in, we were even given a tea ceremony by a real tea master—such a cool way to serve a welcome drink!\n\nWe stayed in a corner room on the 12th floor (room 1206). It was very spacious and we loved the floor-to-ceiling windows, from which we had a fantastic view of Chinatown and the Business District.\n\nI loved the gigantic Samsung smart TV and the free snacks in the minibar (chips, fudge, exclusive Chinese tea beautifully wrapped in a small box, and The Clan Beer!). The room was light and airy, with a super comfortable bed, work desk, and a sofa. There was an ironing board, umbrellas, bathrobes, slippers, a tea maker, and a Nespresso coffee machine. In short, everything you could possibly need!\n\nOur bathroom was also huge, with a Japanese-style toilet (with heating, bidet, air, and everything) and a filtered water tap for drinking water—so convenient.\n\nThe rooftop infinity pool, Sky Pool, on the 30th floor was amazing and, to our surprise, open until midnight! Also, the Sky Gym, on the same floor was huge and extremely well-equipped.\n\nThe breakfast in the restaurant on the 4th floor was great too, not buffet, but we could order from a set menu. We went with the “Chef Daily Special,” which on this day was beef in pita bread with a salad and potatoes; delicious! The hotel also arranges different workshops and free guided tours of Chinatown. We highly recommend this hotel! It is one of our absolute favorite Singapore hotels; we will certainly be back!\n\nClick for the latest prices\n\nParkroyal Collection Pickering\n\nThe fresh and earthy architecture of the Parkroyal Collection Pickering Hotel blew us away. A green hanging garden covers the whole building facade. The walkway to our room was open-air and full of greenery, so cool! Even though it is a big 5-star hotel, it has an impressive focus on being Eco-friendly. We loved the complimentary water in glass bottles (refilled daily), saving nature from even more plastic bottles.\n\nThe infinity swimming pool was excellent, with a fantastic view of Singapore and the hotel’s beautiful hanging gardens. There is also a gym by the pool. We loved the hotel’s 275-meter garden rooftop walk, too; it felt like we were in a park and not in the middle of Singapore.\n\nWe booked a Lifestyle Premier King Room, which was spacious (32 sqm) with a sofa, a table and chair, and a fantastically colossal bathtub. We had a fantastic view of Singapore City. I loved lying in the bathtub overlooking the Singapore Skyline.\n\nThe wifi is stable and fast. Their restaurant, Lime, serves excellent Asian and Western food, and the breakfast was the best we had in Singapore; it contains just everything you can imagine. We found the Parkroyal Collection Pickering Hotel to have a very convenient location. It is located right beside the MRT Chinatown Station. A mall is next door with several excellent restaurants, bakeries, cafes, a big supermarket, and shops. I can’t wait to revisit this hotel!\n\nClick for latest prices\n\nMid Range\n\nAMOY by Far East Hospitality\n\nIf you are looking for a unique boutique hotel full of charm that is a little different from ordinary hotels, then AMOY is it! When stepping through its entrance, which is through the Fuk Tak Chi Chinese temple from 1824, you really feel like stepping back in time.\n\nThe old temple is restored into a small museum where you can see model ships of old Chinese trading ships and models of how the streets surrounding the hotel looked like in 1800. So cool!\n\nThe renovated and modern Amoy hotel only has 37 rooms. All rooms have a unique layout and design inspired by old China and the Zhangzhou people who came from China to settle in Singapore. We loved the custom-made beds, furniture, and room decor.\n\nWe stayed in a Deluxe Room (22 sqm) facing the courtyard, so there was no car noise. Such a cozy room, and we loved the tall old-style windows. Other highlights were the rainfall shower (Espen’s favorite!), several Western TV stations, a capsule coffee machine, and fast wifi. We particularly loved the FREE minibar! Yay! 🙂\n\nWe had breakfast included in our hotel booking and got a delicious breakfast at the neighboring Dean and DeLuca Cafe. We got to choose from a set breakfast menu, which was then freshly made for us, so not a buffet.\n\nWe found the Amoy Hotel to have a convenient location right in the heart of Chinatown and the Central Business District of Singapore. There are many bars and restaurants close to the hotel. The Telok Ayer MRT Station (the blue Downtown Line) is located across the road from the hotel, and the Chinatown MRT Station (the blue Downtown Line and the pink North East Line) is only a few blocks away, making getting around the city and to all the attractions a breeze. You can easily walk to the river, Marina Bay, and the Quays.\n\nClick for latest prices\n\nCapri by Fraser China Square\n\nCapri by Fraser is one of our absolute favorite hotels in Kuala Lumpur. So when it opened in Chinatown in Singapore in 2019, we knew we had to try it out. And it did not disappoint!\n\nWe stayed in a Deluxe Double Room (26 sqm) on the 11th floor, which was fresh and airy. It had a small kitchenette (with a microwave, a fridge, a tea kettle, and an espresso machine). We loved the huge TV with a soundbar. The bathroom sink was integrated into the room, which was fine by us, as there was a separate shower room and toilet room.\n\nThere is a rooftop infinity swimming pool (on the 16th floor) and a well-equipped gym (open 24 hours). The pool is open until 22 /10 pm, which is great as we love evening swims.\n\nThe hotel does not offer room service, but since all rooms have a kitchenette with utensils, bringing takeaway food to our room was no problem. The kitchen also has filtered drinking water. Our room was very quiet, but we heard others with connecting rooms (door to the neighboring room) complain about the noise. The hotel has a great location, close to many restaurants and cafes.\n\nClick here for the latest prices\n\nBudget\n\nAtelier\n\nWalking into the Atelier Hotel feels like walking into someone’s home!

Bugis & Kampong Glam\n\nBugis and Kampong Glam, or Arab Street as it’s often called, offers an attractive mix of traditional Islamic eateries and hipster chic cafes and restaurants. It is the place to head to for third-wave cafes, cool boutiques, hip and trendy cafes and restaurants, and cool street arts.\n\nThe streets of Kampong Glam, especially Haji Lane, really come alive in the evenings with live music gigs and a bustling nightlife.\n\nBugis & Kampong Glam has many excellent restaurants, including Malaysian, Italian, Mexican, Vietnamese, and Chinese, in all price ranges. There is plenty to choose from, and Little India is just a short walk away.\n\nJust north of Kampong Glam is the hip and cool street Jalan Besar, where old architecture meets new hip and cool hipster Singapore.

This street is lined with cozy restaurants and cafes.\n\nMalay Heritage Centre Museum\n\nThe Bugis & Kampong Glam area of Singapore was the seat of the royal family of Malaysia back when Singapore was a part of Malaysia. The beautiful palace was built for the last sultan of Singapore and is now a museum – Malay Heritage Centre Museum.\n\nKwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple\n\nThis is a traditional Chinese Buddhist temple founded in 1884.\n\nBugis Street Market\n\nIt is a popular place for both locals and tourists to go shopping. Here, you can find cheap souvenirs, clothes, accessories, electronics, houseware, and cosmetics. You can also find different types of food and drinks. Best of all, the market is covered by a roof, so you can head here to escape the heat and rain. The market is open until late in the evening (around 22).\n\nKonditori Artisan Bakes This small bakery on Arab Street makes some delicious baked goods. We especially love the cinnamon buns!\n\nHaji Lane\n\nA tiny lane decorated with street murals and packed with cool small shops, restaurants, and cafes, it is one of our favorite streets in Bugis. And it is pedestrians only.\n\nProjector Cinema\n\nThe Projector Cinema is one of Singapore’s few independent cinemas. It shows both international and Asian movies. It has a cool bar, too, where you can buy food and snacks. We saw a super cute Asian animation movie here.\n\nWhat’s the catch?\n\nA little bit far away from the city center (25 min by MRT to Orchard), and since it is popular in the evening, it can be a struggle to get a taxi. But the area has several MRT stations.\n\nWhere To Stay in Bugis & Kampong Glam\n\nTop End\n\nInterContinental Singapore\n\nWe were very impressed by the service, decor, restaurants, and, most importantly, the room at this hotel. The design and decor take you back in time but with a modern and elegant feel. Loved it! Our room was spacious and newly refurbished.\n\nWe loved the delicious Chinese food at the Man Fu Yuan in-house restaurant. The city view from the rooftop garden and pool is spectacular, and we used the well-equipped 24-hour gym several times. The pool area is a lovely retreat from the hustle and bustle of the streets, and there is a poolside service so you can have a tasty lunch and a cocktail.\n\nAnother highlight of the InterContinental is the lounge – it’s amazing! Breakfast, afternoon tea, and cocktail hour are great. Booking a club room gives you free access to the exclusive club lounge and free cocktails and canapés each evening.\n\nClick here for the latest prices\n\nHotel Naumi\n\nThere is something special about a well-run small boutique hotel that is hard to replicate at a larger property. Naumi has that, from the friendly, personable service to the beautiful art and design that meets you the moment you step through the door. This is a super chic little hotel!\n\nWe especially liked the infinity pool on the rooftop, with fantastic city views and a lovely little pool bar – the Cloud 9. The hotel also has an excellent Indian restaurant, Table by Rang Mahal, on the ground floor by the lobby.\n\nWe stayed in a Habitat Room (26 sqm), which was very modern and fresh and chic. They also have rooms with a little garden, The Patio rooms, which look gorgeous. Our room had a minibar and a Nespresso coffee machine. The minibar was complimentary and refilled daily with juices, sodas, and water.\n\nThe room’s layout is a little unusual, although we are seeing it more and more often now. The bathroom sink is a part of the bedroom, while the toilet and shower (rainwater shower) are in two separate rooms separated by glass walls and doors. It was a little unsettling at first until we realized that the glass walls will change from transparent to opaque at the touch of a button for privacy.\n\nThe Naumi Hotel has a great location, close to shops, museums, MRT stations, and the Marina Bay area. The neighboring street, Purvis Street, has many nice restaurants at all price levels. We ate there many times and loved it!\n\nClick for the latest prices\n\nAndaz Singapore – A concept by Hyatt\n\nWe only stayed one night at this modern 5-star hotel and had a great stay! Our room, a King Room, was enormous (38 sqm) and beautifully decorated with impressive city views. I loved lying in bed looking at the view from the huge roof-to-ceiling windows. Our room also had a couch/ day bed by the window. The hotel is designed by the award-winning André Fu from Hong Kong.\n\nAnother highly appreciated perk was the complimentary mini-bar with snacks and soft drinks (no alcohol). Espen particularly loved the rain shower in the bathroom.\n\nThe rooftop infinity pool on the 25th floor has fantastic views. We could see all the way to the sea! There are plenty of comfortable sunbeds by the pool, too, so it is a great place to relax.

The Andaz Hotel is quite conveniently located, only a few minutes walk from the Bugis MRT Station, making it easy to get around the city.\n\nClick for latest prices\n\nMid Range\n\nHotel Gin Bugis Singapore\n\nThe old Hotel G is now the Hotel Gin Bugis and is currently undergoing refurbishment. We stayed at the old Hotel G a couple of times and liked it for what it was: an affordable mid-range hotel in a great location with very small but stylish and quite comfortable rooms.\n\nBencoolen MRT station is right around the corner, and you can easily walk to the museum area, the shopping on Orchard Road, and Little India.\n\nThe cheapest rooms (Double Room) are very small, so we upgraded to Great Room King, a slightly bigger room to fit all our luggage, and our room size was ok for the two of us (13 sqm). The hotel is modern, chic, and cool interior-wise and is good value for the money.\n\nIt has two restaurants on the ground floor, and if you are coming to the hotel by the MRT or bus, you must walk through one of the restaurants, the Ginett Restaurant & Wine Bar, to get to the elevator and take it up to level 2 to get to the lobby. The restaurant is currently undergoing a refurbishment as of April 2024.\n\nIf you come by taxi as we did, the taxi drives through the parking center to level 2. We loved the 25 Degrees Burger & Liquor Bar and ate there three times! 🙂 You HAVE to try their burgers!\n\nIn our opinion, the only real drawbacks to this hotel are the small rooms and the fact that it does not have a swimming pool (there is a gym).\n\nClick for latest prices\n\nBudget\n\nDream Chaser Boutique Capsule Hotel\n\nThis is a beautiful budget hotel with a great location in Kampong Glam. In addition to the capsule dorms (both gender-separate and mixed dorms are available), there are also small and medium-sized private rooms (some with private bathrooms). The hotel interior is cozy and homey and feels more like a private house than a hotel.\n\nThe shared bathrooms are fresh and modern and kept very clean.

The Quays – Clarke Quay, Robertson Quay & Boat Quay\n\nConnected by the Singapore River and occupying roughly the area in between the old Colonial District and the Central Business District are the three Quays of Singapore:\n\nClark Quay\n\nRobertson Quay\n\nBoat Quay\n\nOnce the heart of commercial trade along the river and an important trading station for ships coming into the harbor, the Quays gradually lost its importance. By the late 80s, the area consisted of old abandoned warehouses.\n\nToday, the area is transformed into an entertainment center with many bars, tourist shops, microbreweries, restaurants, and nightclubs lining the river on both sides, as well as the smaller side streets.\n\nWhy Stay In The Quays Area?\n\nThe Quays is Singapore’s nightlife center, so if you want to stay in an area with plenty of dining and late-night partying options, this is an excellent choice. Another tip is to explore the side streets to find the best restaurants.\n\nMarina Bay and Chinatown are both within walking distance of the Quays. The Clarke Quay and Fort Canning Park MRT stations are nearby, making it easy to reach other parts of Singapore.\n\nThings to see and do in The Quays area\n\nBoat Quay\n\nThis is the closest area to the old harbor and is declared a conservation area by the government of Singapore. It is packed with upscale bars (a bit touristy), shops, and waterside restaurants.\n\nClarke Quay\n\nClarke, the second colonial governor of Singapore, named this harbor area after himself. It is the most popular area on the Quay and has many nice bars, clubs, and restaurants.\n\nRobertson Quay\n\nStorage buildings once dominated this harbor area, but now you will find bars and members-only party places here. It has a more sophisticated and calm vibe than the other two Quays, with more upscale restaurants than party places.\n\nAsian Civilisation Museum\n\nThe Asian Civilisation Museum has Asia’s most comprehensive collection of Asian treasures. It is well worth a visit. They had an exhibition about Angkor in Cambodia when we visited, which was fantastic!\n\nCavenagh Bridge\n\nThis beautiful bridge was made in Scotland and reassembled in Singapore in 1869. It is illuminated at night.\n\nWhat’s the catch?\n\nIt’s fun for an evening out, but the menu-clutching touts continually trying to usher you into their riverside restaurants and the over-the-top colorfully designed nightclubs can get a bit much. You won’t find that many cultural attractions in this area.\n\nWhere to stay in The Quays\n\nTop End\n\nThe Fullerton Hotel\n\nThe Fullerton Hotel is widely regarded as one of Singapore’s most exclusive hotels. Located in an old building that used to be Singapore´s general post office, it is a grand and majestic hotel that oozes classic 5-star luxury.\n\nThe rooms are elegant and beautiful, but the real diamond at this hotel is the 25 m-long terrace pool. The hotel is centrally located and has excellent views of Marina Bay. The Italian rooftop restaurant and bar are well worth a visit, even if you are not staying here.\n\nClick for latest prices\n\nMid Range\n\nThe Robertson House managed by The Ascott Limited\n\nThe Robertson House is Ascotts’ newest Singapore property. After a long and extensive refurbishment, the hotel opened its doors at the end of 2023.\n\nThis used to be the old Park Hotel Robertson Quay Hotel, which we have stayed at several times. The new hotel retains our favorite part of the original hotel, mainly the fabulous large swimming pool, while giving the rest of the property a much-needed makeover and rebranding.\n\nThe hotel’s new design is perhaps best described as old-world colonial, drawing inspiration from the Singapore River history and the neighborhood’s history and importance in shaping the city.\n\nThe rooms that looked pretty dated on our last visit have been given new life and look stylish and fresh. The Riverview rooms offer a fantastic view overlooking the Singapore Quays. Be aware that the standard rooms are on the small side.\n\nClick for latest prices\n\nBudget\n\nKINN Capsule Hotel\n\nThis fresh, stylish, and modern capsule hotel is spotlessly clean and in a perfect location in Boat Quay. Here, you get your own little air-conditioned capsule to sleep in in a room with ten capsules (male-only, female-only, or mixed). The capsules have privacy blinds, a folding table, and electric sockets beside the bed. The hotel has a great shared lounge and a rooftop terrace where you can hang out and socialize with other guests and travelers.\n\nThe shared bathrooms are clean and have hot water showers. You can also use the laundry machines and a shared kitchen. I love the interior design of this capsule hotel, which is clearly inspired by Japan. It even has a tree inside! So cool!\n\nClick here for the latest prices\n\n7. Little India\n\nLittle India is a lively, vibrant ethnic district north of the Singapore River.\n\nWhile the area is predominantly Indian, Mosques and churches stand alongside Hindu temples and posters for the latest Bollywood blockbusters.\n\nHead to Serangoon Road to experience Little India’s colorful shops selling textiles, cheap fashions, spices, and bargain electronics. Spice racks on display fill the air with mouth-watering smells, and the eateries along Serangoon Road serve up a mix of Indian, Chinese, and Arabian cousins.\n\nWhether you are looking for a tasty, cheap curry served on a banana leaf South Indian style or an upscale dining experience, Little India rarely disappoints.\n\nIn the evenings, the streets fill up, the colorful street light comes on, and Little India becomes a lively place popular with locals and visitors. Little India is as close to India as you will get without actually going to India.\n\nWhy stay in Little India?\n\nMany of Singapore’s best guesthouses and hostels are located here, making it a popular destination for budget travelers. There are also some excellent mid-range boutique hotels available here.\n\nLittle India is the place to stay if you are looking for cheap accommodation options and love eating delicious Indian food.\n\nWhereas parts of Singapore can feel a bit “sterile,” Little India is an excellent place to stay if you want to escape the modern shopping malls and experience Singapore’s ethnic roots.\n\nLittle India’s two MRT stations (Little India Station and Rochor Station) also make it a convenient base from which to explore the rest of the city, only 15 min to the city center.\n\nThings to See and Do in Little India\n\nTekka Centre\n\nExplore the lively market stalls of Tekka Centre. If you are hungry, head to the ground floor. Here, you will find stalls selling vegetarian dishes from India, China, and Malaysia. There is also a wet market on the same floor, with many vegetables, seafood, and fruits.\n\nSri Veeramakaliamman Temple\n\nVisit the colorful Hindu temple Sri Veeramakaliamman, one of Singapore’s oldest and most famous Hindu temples, constructed in 1881. There are several other temples in this area too.\n\nMustafa Centre\n\nLittle India’s landmark shopping center is old, packed, noisy, and unmissable.\n\nWhat’s the catch?\n\nLittle India can get extremely packed and noisy, especially on Sunday evenings when all the Indian foreign workers have their day off. Nightlife is quite limited and restaurants tend to close fairly early.\n\nWhere To Stay in Little India\n\nTop End\n\nOne Farrer Hotel & Spa\n\nWe were surprised when we checked into the One Farrer Hotel, as we had not expected this big, modern, comfortable, and posh hotel in Little India!\n\nWe loved this hotel from the moment we stepped into the lobby. It is an excellent value for your money, as it is cheap compared to other 5-star hotels in Singapore. The service is also fantastic.\n\nOne Farrer Hotel is located next to Farrer Park MRT station and is only a short walk from the big shopping center, Mustafa Centre; that is open 24/7 and is quite an experience. The hotel has a fantastic view over Singapore from the upper levels all the way to Marina Bay.\n\nThe huge swimming pool on the 3rd floor is bliss, with plenty of sunbeds and seating groups, a bar, and a cafe with delicious hamburgers. The gym is huge, almost as big as a gym center.\n\nThe mini bar in the room is free; yay! 🙂 We got a free room upgrade (I don’t know why it was our lucky day, I guess), and our club room was terrific. To conclude, this is how we felt about our stay at the One Farrer: We did not want to leave! 🙂\n\nClick for latest prices\n\nMid Range\n\nWanderlust\n\nWe stayed in a wonderful Studio Loft apartment (Loft 408) at the Wanderlust Hotel and loved it. The bed was on the loft, while we had a living room (with a sofa, TV, and desk), a fully-equipped kitchen (with a fridge, microwave, coffee machine, and tea kettle), and a comfortable bathroom (with rainwater shower) downstairs. The kitchen sink had filtered tap water for drinking. Our room was 24 sqm but felt bigger due to the smart layout.\n\nThe Wanderlust Hotel is a fantastic, small boutique hotel (29 rooms) housed in a renovated 1920s heritage Art Deco-style building. The interior design is like something out of a design magazine. I loved it!\n\nThe rooms have different sizes and designs, and some have bathtubs. We particularly appreciated the complimentary washing machines and dryers (with detergent, open 24h) in the common areas on the 2nd floor; they were such a lifesaver. There is also a kitchen on the 2nd floor, which all guests can use.\n\nOur room was so fresh and stylish. I could have stayed there forever. We also loved the rooftop lounge area with seating groups and green plants. It was a lovely place to chill and relax, with the small plunge pool (open from 9 am until 21/ 9 pm) offering a place to cool down from the heat.\n\nThe hotel’s ground-floor Kotuwa restaurant serves delicious food, a fusion of Srilankan curry and Asian (the chef is from Sri Lanka, and his previous restaurant got a Michelin star). The restaurant is extremely popular (you should pre-book a table if you want to eat there). But there is also plenty of street food and restaurants around the hotel.\n\nYou get a portable phone allowing you to use Google Maps on your way around Singapore, which is very handy! The hotel is right around the corner from the Jalan Besar MRT station and close to the hipster enclave of Jalan Besar. This beautiful boutique hotel is such a gem with a great location!\n\nClick for th latest prices\n\nBudget\n\nDream Lodge Hostel\n\nIf you are looking for affordable hostel accommodation, this is perfect – clean, tidy, and quiet. The dorms have single and double beds for couples, all with a curtain for some privacy. You get a lockable locker that easily fits a backpack. There are plenty of (shared) bathrooms that are kept spotlessly clean. The kitchen area is downstairs and free to use. There is a supermarket nearby and several cafes and restaurants. The closest MRT Station is about a 10-minute walk away.\n\nClick for latest prices\n\n8. Sentosa Island\n\nSentosa Island is a favorite resort island just south of downtown Singapore. The island was once a British military fortress but was renamed “Sentosa” and handed over as a part of Singapore after World War II.\n\nSentosa means “tranquility and peace” in Malay. Its white tropical beaches and beautiful landscape make it easy to see why it was once named so.\n\nHowever, these days, it is decidedly less peaceful. Developed as an entertainment center, the small island of Sentosa is packed with activities and experiences to keep you busy. There are two golf courses, a couple of Casinos, and several theme parks, including Universal Studios Singapore and SEA Aquarium. There are also boardwalk cafes, restaurants, and a 2 km-long human-made white sand beach. You will never have a dull moment at Sentosa!\n\nYou can quickly get to and from Sentosa with the cable car, the monorail Sentosa Express, or by walking over the nice pedestrian bridge (a 10 min walk), all from HarbourFront Station (purple North East Line and orange Circle Line).\n\nWhy stay on Sentosa Island?\n\nIf you want to combine Singapore’s big city sightseeing with some beach time, then Sentosa is the place to stay. The beach and all the entertainment offered here make Sentosa popular among families traveling with children, as well as golfers (Yep, there is a golf track here).\n\nThere are three beaches in Sentosa, each with its unique charm and character. Head to Siloso Beach for bustling restaurants and attractions. Palawan Beach is the place to head for kids’ playgrounds, parks, and a lagoon, and it is very popular among families with children. Tanjong Beach is ideal for those looking for more peace and quiet.\n\nSentosa Island has some top-notch luxury resorts, making it the perfect place for families with kids to stay. There are also a couple of fantastic high-end boutique hotels, like The Barracks Hotel, which is perfect for a romantic getaway .\n\nAnd of course, there are Sentos’s star attractions, Universal Studios, and the SEA Aquarium.\n\nThings to see and do on Sentosa Island\n\nBeaches\n\nThere are three beaches on Sentosa Island: Siloso Beach, Palawan Beach, and Tanjong Beach. Tanjong is the quietest and most peaceful, while Siloso is all about enjoying good food and drinks at the many restaurants, pubs, and cafes. Palawan, with its playgrounds, parks, and lagoon, is perfect for families with kids.\n\nUniversal Studios\n\nSentosa houses South East Asia’s only Universal Studios, Universal Studios Singapore. Here, you can visit one of the world’s most famous theme parks, which features mummies, dinosaurs, and the world’s tallest dueling roller coasters. We’ve been a couple of times and had a great time!\n\nSEA Aquarium\n\nSentosa has one of the world’s largest aquariums, the SEA Aquarium. It houses over 100,000 sea animals and fish, and it is great fun for kids and adults!\n\nSingapore Cable Car\n\nTaking the Singapore Cable Car is the most fun way to get to Sentosa Island. We took this, and the view is breathtaking.\n\nMegazip Line\n\nIf you are not scared of heights and want a thrilling experience, try the Megazip on Sentosa. The zip line is 450 m long and 75 m high.\n\nMadame Tussauds Singapore\n\nAt Madame Tussauds Singapore on Sentosa, you can “meet” many celebrities, famous sports athletes, and film stars. If you are into Marvel (who isn’t?), you can experience a cool 4D show of the Marvel universe. You can get up close here with Loki, Captain Marvel, Thor, Black Panther, Rocket, Spider-Man, Ant-Man, and the Wasp.\n\nSentosa Waterpark\n\nSentosa has a huge waterpark called Adventure Cove Waterpark. In addition to thrilling water slides and tunnels, you can meet dolphins and huge manta rays at the park.\n\nGogreen Eco Adventure Sentosa\n\nAt Sentosa’s Gogreen ECO Adventure, you can rent bicycles or kick scooters to explore Sentosa Island. You can rent per hour, day, or overnight (24 hours).\n\nSentosa Golf Club\n\nSentosa Golf Club has two huge and beautiful golf courses – Serapong and Tanjong. It was ranked in Golf Digest World’s 100 Greatest Golf Courses 2022-23.\n\nCasino\n\nSentosa has a casino as a part of the Resorts World Sentosa.\n\nWhat’s the catch?\n\nStaying on Sentosa Island is not very convenient if you’re in Singapore to explore the city’s sights and attractions. You can’t exactly pop into your hotel room for rest between sightseeing excursions. But if you have the time, consider spending a night or two out here for beach time and visiting a theme park.\n\nThe island can sometimes feel like a colossal theme park. It can get quite busy on weekends and public holidays, with long queues and hefty waiting times, especially on public transport. The Island only has top-end resorts, with no budget or even mid-range accommodation options.\n\nWhere To Stay on Sentosa Island\n\nTop End\n\nThe Barracks Hotel Sentosa\n\nWe had two fantastic days at Sentosa and the wonderful Barracks Hotel! The hotel used to be a British artillery outpost (constructed in 1904) where soldiers would stay. The buildings have been beautifully restored and converted to The Barracks luxury hotel.\n\nWe stayed in a Premier Room on the second floor. We L-O-V-E-D our private balcony, where we could enjoy a glass of wine. We also ordered in-room dining, which they set up for us on the balcony. The room was huge (39 sqm) and super comfortable, with a high ceiling, a fantastic bathroom, and a stunning black granite bathtub.\n\nThe bedroom and bathroom are like one big open room, but with sliding doors that can be closed for privacy. There is a separate shower room and a Japanese-style electronic toilet (I’d love to have one back home!).\n\nThe room had a tea kettle and a Nespresso coffee machine with complimentary coffee capsules. I loved the high-class tea from Pryce Tea. The internet was fast and reliable.\n\nThe free canapes and drinks in the afternoon (the receptionist will ask you which time you prefer to check in, between 17:00 and 20:00) were delicious! There were so many cocktails to choose from, as well as wines, beers, and mocktails. The breakfast was also delicious; we could choose from a set menu.\n\nThe hotel has two huge 30-meter swimming pools on the ground floor with plenty of sunbeds and lounge beds, perfect for relaxation and tanning.\n\nThe Barracks Hotel has a convenient location in Sentosa. We walked down to the beach in about 15 minutes, but you can also take the Sentosa Express train from Imbiah Station to Beach Station (Monday-Sunday 07:00 am—midnight) or the bus (routes A and C, same operating time as the train). Universal Studios and the SEA Aquarium are about 15 15-minute walk away. A 7-Eleven and several restaurants are in the same building complex as the hotel.\n\nClick for the latest prices\n\nCapella Singapore\n\nWith two swimming pools set in a green and lush garden, the Capella Singapore is the perfect luxury getaway retreat to relax and unwind. You can even opt for The Pool Villa, which has a private pool. Everything about this hotel is just perfect.\n\nLocated on the top of a little hill, the Capella Hotel is surrounded by trees, flowers, and grass. You can’t see any other hotels or buildings, but you can catch a glimpse of Singapore on the horizon. The food, service, and atmosphere is fantastic! If you can bear to leave the hotel, the beach is just a five-minute walk away.\n\nClick for latest prices\n\nShangri-La’s Rasa Sentosa Resort & Spa\n\nRasa Sentosa Resort is huge, with an even more gigantic swimming pool (with an adult-only area) set in a lovely garden. The hotel also has a Kid’s Zone where the kids can play. This hotel is excellent for families!\n\nIf you want to go for a stroll along the beach, swim in the ocean, or work on your tan, Siloso Beach is only a few minutes’s walk away.\n\nAsk for a sea view room with a lovely balcony to sit and enjoy the fantastic beach and sea view. The cable car entrance is just next to the hotel, and free buses run just outside the hotel to get you around the island.\n\nResorts World Sentosa – Beach Villas\n\nThe private villas here are just gorgeous! Love the private jacuzzi in front of each villa. The resort is located 8 minutes from the beach on foot and has a fantastic sea view. The pool is stunning, surrounded by green trees, which gives you a jungle feeling. The Beach Villas are located within Resorts World Sentosa, which houses Universal Studios Singapore, the S.E.A. Aquarium, and Adventure Cove Waterpark. So everything is within a short walk.\n\nClick for latest prices\n\n9. Katong / Joo Chiat\n\nKatong is our last neighborhood in this guide, and it’s not one that you’ll see talked about a lot. It is a residential area where high-rise apartment buildings and modern condos stand alongside traditional Peranakan shophouses. While it may not be on most tourists’ radar, it is a trendy area among expats and those who prefer staying in a neighborhood with more of a local feel.\n\nKatong’s main sight is the well-preserved Chinese shophouses along Joo Chiat and Kong Seng Road. These have become world-famous for their colorful facades and attract photographers from all over the world.\n\nKatong also has quite the blossoming cafe scene, with new cool coffee shops and eateries popping up every time we visit.\n\nThe ever-popular East Coast Park stretches along the coastline and is a mecca for anyone who loves outdoor sports. We love to rent bikes and spend an afternoon riding along the coast before stopping at one of the many hawker centers for some delicious food.\n\nThere is a wakeboard waterpark, running trails, and plenty of room for playing ball or just having a picnic on the grass while watching the windsurfers do their thing. For kids, the Coastal Playgrove is very popular, with Singapore’s tallest outdoor play area and slide.\n\nThere is even a man-made beach, with breakwaters making it safe for swimming!\n\nIt is easy to see why Katongh has long been a favorite among expats, with its low-key residential feel, cozy cafes, and seaside park. In recent years, some excellent new hotels have also opened up. And with several new MRT stations, getting to and from the city center will become much faster.\n\nWhy Stay in Katong?\n\nWith the opening of the Thompson East-Coast MRT line and the new MRT stations drastically cutting down on transport time, using Katong as a base for exploring Singapore has become a more attractive option.\n\nThe neighborhood has a quieter, more residential feel than downtown Singapore, with excellent cafes and restaurants. Lastly, hotel prices are generally cheaper here than in more central parts of the city.\n\nWalking distance to East Coast Park, with all it has to offer, means you can combine sightseeing with spending some time on the beach or relaxing by the seaside. It may be time to consider staying in Katong on your next Singapore visit!\n\nThings to see and do in Katong\n\nEast Coast Park\n\nThis coastline park has a man-made beach, green lawns, a wakeboarding lake, bicycle rental shops, a children’s play area, and several hawker food centers.\n\nBeautiful Peranakan shophouses\n\nWalk around Joo Chiat and admire some of Singapore’s best-preserved Peranakan-style architecture.\n\nParkway Parade\n\nParkway Parade has been an iconic neighborhood mall since 1984. It has plenty of eateries, supermarkets, and shops, including an excellent food court on the ground floor.\n\nAwfully Chocolate Bakery & Cafe\n\nWe love chocolate, so whenever we are in this part of the city, we have to stop by Awfully Chocolate for some delicious chocolate treats and pastries.\n\nChoice Cuts\n\nA hidden gem and one of our absolute favorite stops, this small Pizza place combines excellent New York-style pizzas with a cool vinyl record store and co-working space upstairs.\n\nChin Mee Chin\n\nThis cute and colorful little breakfast spot specializes in traditional Singapore breakfasts, such as Kaya toast with soft-boiled eggs.\n\nWhat’s the catch?\n\nThe new Katong MRT stations on the Thompson East Coast Line have not yet opened. If there are no further delays, they will open in June 2024.\n\nWhere To Stay In Katong\n\nMid Range\n\nHotel Indigo Singapore Katong, an IHG Hotel\n\nThis is Katong’s most popular hotel by a mile and one of the reasons why Katong is attracting more visitors. The Hotel Indigo has consistently been ranked among Singapore’s best hotels since it opened its doors in 2020.\n\nThe grounds once housed the old Joo Chiat police station, and the hotel is heavily inspired by its historic neighborhood. From the moment you enter the lobby, you’re surrounded by beautiful Peranakan-inspired artwork and design.\n\nThe spacious (from 30 sqm), cozy, and modern rooms feature Peranakan-inspired wall art, colorful decor, hardwood floors, a large flat-screen TV, a minibar, and wall-to-ceiling windows with great views of the city and harbor.\n\nThe view from the rooftop bar and infinity pool is even more impressive, especially at sunset. The fitness center is also quite excellent and open 24-hours.\n\nThe in-house restaurant Baba Chews serves traditional and modern Peranakan-inspired dishes. There is also a cool rooftop bar. The hotel is pet-friendly, so you might run into a few furry guests around the lobby.\n\nLocation-wise, you can easily walk to East Coast Park, and with the opening of the new Marine Parade MRT station, travel times to the city center will be cut roughly in half. All in all, Hotel Indigo is excellent value for the money.\n\nClick For Latest Prices\n\nBudget\n\nSanta Grand Hotel East Coast, a NuVe Group Collection\n\nThe Santa Grand Hotel is a budget-friendly alternative with a great location five minutes from Hotel Indigo. It is housed in a lovely Perankan-style building with small, modern, clean rooms. If you need more space, consider upgrading to their Deluxe rooms, which are more spacious. Be aware that their so-called Skylight rooms lack windows, so I’d recommend avoiding those.\n\nThe rooftop swimming pool is great for a refreshing swim after sightseeing, but with only a few sunbeds, it is not ideal for sunbathing. There is no room service or breakfast serving, but the area has plenty of restaurants and cozy eateries to explore.\n\nClick For Latest Prices\n\nHoliday Inn Express\n\nThis is a no-frills, clean, modern budget hotel. The rooms are compact but comfortable and well-decorated, with a flat-screen TV, air conditioning, and minibar. Hotel facilities include washing machines and a small but well-equipped gym. Breakfast is served buffet style with a good range of options. Overall, if you’re looking for a budget-friendly place to stay with friendly service and a great location and don’t mind the lack of a swimming pool, this might fit the bill.\n\nClick For Latest Prices\n\nThe End\n\nThere you have it—a guide to all our favorite areas and hotels in Singapore.
