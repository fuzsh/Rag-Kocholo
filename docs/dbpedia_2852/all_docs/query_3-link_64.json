        "text": "Explore Singapore on your own!\n\nBefore you get drawn into the next tab that says the magic word “FREE“, I recommend doing this DIY Singapore layover tour by yourself if you rather want the flexibility to choose the places that you actually want to go to.\n\nAfter all, the free tours offered by Singapore Changi Airport typically don’t give you enough time to explore the city and its stops. This is aside from the fact that they have limited tour time slots.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n– Much like I’ve already mentioned above, this kind of Singapore layover itinerary is ideal if you have at least 6 hours in between your flights (8 hours being the safest) — this is taking into account traffic, transit, check-in, and immigration times.\n\n.\n\n– Don’t forget to leave your luggage at the airport. It’s best to leave your carry-on too, as well as any other heavy backpacks because they will be a pain to carry when you explore the city.\n\n.\n\n– It’s also best that you have all of your flights under the same airline, if not operated by airline partners so that you can have your checked-in luggage go all the way to your destination. (This saves you the hassle of checking in your luggage again after your Singapore layover or stopover).\n\n.\n\n– To know how to get in and around the city, scroll up and check the “Travel Guide” section below.\n\n.\n\n– Check out this great-for-value Singapore Pass that will allow you to visit 2, 3, 4, or 5 attractions in Singapore for a discounted package deal! Choose from any of these places: Universal Studios Singapore, Gardens by the Bay Singapore, Singapore Cable Car, Skyhelix Sentosa Singapore, Singapore Flyer ticket, Singapore Zoo, Singapore River Cruise, Big Bus Singapore tour, and many more! The pass has a long validity period of 30 days so it will offer you some flexibility on your schedule.\n\nThe Fun Top Things to Do in Singapore?\n\nCome and check out this list of the top things to do in Singapore which features the best activities and tours in the city and more! (Use code AILEENKLOOK to save 5% off when checking out!)\n\nREAD NOW\n\nNow, I’m NOT telling you to do all of the below activities in one go, because that’s just impossible. Sure, Singapore may be a small mega city but it still holds tons of attractions and activities.\n\nSo what I suggest instead is that you pick 1 or 2 categories below (colored green, depending on your preference), and then you either do all the activities under it or a few (depending on how long your layover is).\n\n◘◘ The Typical Hotspots\n\nMarina Bay Sands: This is an iconic resort complex that faces Marina Bay in Singapore and it features The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands Mall, a museum, two large theatres, restaurants, Crystal Pavillions, art-science exhibits, casinos and so much more!\n\nSkyPark Observation Deck = Providing breathtaking panoramic views over the city, this observation deck also has the world’s longest elevated swimming pool with a vanishing edge (a.k.a. infinity pool) that’s located 191 meters above the ground. (You can only swim in it though if you’re a guest of the hotel; but still and the same, this is a great spot to be in and you can buy entry tickets through this link).\n\nSpectra Light Show = This is an amazing outdoor light and water show that’s displayed along the promenade. The show happens at 8PM and 9PM on Sunday to Thursday, and at 8PM, 9PM and 10PM on Fridays and Saturdays. (If you ask me, it’s better to watch this show from the other side of Marina Bay Sands).\n\nGardens by the Bay: This mystical oasis features more than 500,000 plants and about 18 Avatar-like Supertrees that will take your breath away! To book entrance tickets for this as a part of your Singapore layover, go here. Take note that there are a LOT of attractions here but notable of which are the following…\n\nSuperTree Grove: These Avatar-ish trees light up at night and have a music and light show at 7:45PM and 8:45PM daily! It’s even possible to have your dinner inside this SuperTree and feel like a modern Tarzan and Jane (or Jake Sully and Neytiri, in line with the Avatar feel).\n\nCloud Forest: This features the world’s tallest indoor waterfall at 35 meters as well as a scenic mist-filled Treetop and Cloud Walk!\n\nFlower Dome: This is the largest glass greenhouse in the world as listed in the 2015 Guinness World Records!\n\nOCBC Skyway: Placed 22 meters above the ground, this is an amazing stroll that goes through the Gardens and gives you a great view over the Marina Bay skyline as well.\n\nMerlion Park: A landmark that you must NOT miss! Located at One Fullerton, you will find here the iconic Merlion, a mythical creature with a lion’s head and the body of fish — a widely used mascot of Singapore\n\nSingapore Flyer: Reaching a height of 40 stories, I recommend riding this Ferris Wheel at night to have an amazing view over the entire Marina Bay. You can also try their signature drinks here such as the famous ‘Singapore Sling’ that dates back over 100 years! Also, unlike typical Ferris Wheel rides, the capsules here are huge. (Book your tickets here).\n\nSingapore Botanic Gardens: A 158-year-old tropical garden that is honored as a UNESCO World Heritage Site (Singapore’s first!). You will love the fact that entrance here is FREE from 5AM to 12AM (except for the National Orchid Garden – the park’s crown jewel – which is open 8:30AM to 7PM and charges SGD 5).\n\nArtScience Museum: This place is that giant white flower-like building that you see on Marina Bay and it is famous for its varied art and science exhibitions. One of the most popular of which is the Future World exhibition for its impressive light set-ups (in collaboration with teamLab, a renowned Japanese interdisciplinary art collective). Entrance here typically starts from USD $9~ and you can grab discounted rates if you book online.\n\nS.E.A. Aquarium: This is said to be the biggest aquarium in the world that features state-of-the-art facilities that let you explore the depths of the oceans and glimpse at several sea creatures. (Book your tickets here).\n\n– – –\n\n◘◘ For Shopaholics\n\nThe Shoppes in Marina Bay Sands: As one of the largest shopping malls in Singapore, this should be on your Singapore layover itinerary if you want to do some luxurious shopping\n\nOrchard Road: This is a 2.2-kilometer-long major road in the city that is regarded as a famous shopping street. It holds a lot of fashion favorites, specialist stores, and so much more\n\nHaji Lane: Considered a ‘hipster’ neighborhood, you will love the boutique shops in this area (not to mention the impressive wall art).\n\n◘◘ For Nightlife\n\nClarke Quay: This is a historical riverside in the city that is now a hotspot for bars, clubs, and restaurants\n\nOrchard Road: After dark, the party animals come out to play at Orchard Road too! Be sure to check out Emerald Hill Road.\n\n◘◘ For Foodies\n\nSingapore is passionate about food and you will find some of the best places in the following areas:\n\nThe Old Airport Road Hawker Centre: This is one of the biggest hawker centers and which a lot of Singaporeans swear by given its long history! You can never go wrong in any of the stalls as you try some of the famous Singapore food items such as chili crab, chicken rice, char kway teow (stir-fried rice cake), lor mee (noodle dish), satay (skewered and grilled meat), and rojak (salad dish) among many others.\n\nKampong Glam: This is a neighborhood in the city that’s filled with watering holes, cafes, and restaurants to fill up your tummy. One of the places you must not miss is Zam Zam in order to try their murtabak (stuffed pancake) that has been famous since 1908.\n\nChinatown: This ethnic enclave is also a place that you must witness, other than its distinct Chinese cultural elements, you should enjoy the area by grabbing a bite at one of the hawker stalls and a drink too in places such as Tea Chapter. Don’t forget to buy some Chinese souvenirs! (Want a guided tour? Reserve your spot online now!)\n\nLittle India: As the name suggests, this is the center of the Indian community in Singapore. While here, head over to Serangoon Road to enjoy the atmosphere, and don’t forget to try fish head curry!\n\nSingapore Cable Car and Sky Dinner: If you’re still in the city during nighttime, I suggest riding the Cable Car Sky Network to soar above the city’s views and then have a romantic dinner. (Book this experience here).\n\nWondering what Singapore food or dishes that you must absolutely try?\n\nCheck out this blog post to find out: Top Singapore Food Dishes to Try & Where\n\n– – –\n\n◘◘ For Out-of-the-City Places\n\nPulau Ubin: If you’ve got the time during your Singapore layover, go ride a bumboat to reach Pulau Ubin, a nearby island that is famous for its wildlife, cycle trails, and footpaths. Truth be told, this might just be the last real ‘kampung’ (village) in Singapore and you will love its unspoiled and rustic charm.\n\nMacRitchie Nature Trail: This is a gateway to the city’s natural reserves and it is a well-known spot for nature lovers and exercise enthusiasts. One of the things you must try here is their Treetop Walks, a 250-meter aerial suspension bridge that spans the two highest points within MacRitchie. (Nearest train station: Marymount).\n\n◘◘ For Families\n\nSentosa Island: Not only for the kids but also for the ‘kids-at-heart’, this island resort off the southern coast is a leisure place filled with fun and recreation! (Nearby train station: Harbourfront). Here are just some of the many things you can do here…\n\nUniversal Studios Theme Park = Go beyond the world of cinematic entertainment to enjoy the seven themed lands here in Singapore’s very own Universal Studios!\n\n(Book your tickets here.)\n\nSkyline Luge: Ride this fun half-go-kart and half-toboggan-like sled through two different trails. This is the only Asian site of New Zealand’s famous luge activity.\n\n(Book your tickets here.)\n\nResorts World Adventure Water Cove: Escape the summer heat and visit this must-see attraction in Resorts World! Your young ones will love the Riptide Rocket and Rainbow Reef!\n\n(Book your tickets here.)\n\nSingapore Zoo: Occupying 28 hectares of land within the city’s heavily forested area, this zoo has an “open concept” which means that you and your kids will get to closely experience the wonders of nature given that the animals here roam freely in their natural habitats. (Book your tickets here).\n\nNight Safari: This is the best way to see the world’s nocturnal animals. As a unique night safari experience and the world’s first nocturnal zoo, you can also board a tram that goes through the 86-acre rainforest! Don’t miss out on this unique experience! (Book your tickets here).\n\nRiver Safari: Can’t get enough of the wildlife? Make a stop at Asia’s first and only river-themed wildlife park where you can encounter manatees, giant pandas, and other creatures! (Book your tickets here.)\n\n◘◘ NEW: Visit Changi Airport’s Jewel\n\nOpened in 2019, Jewel Changi Airport is the newest 10-level glass-dome complex that has an array of attractions not limited to gardens, a hotel, aviation facilities, and 300 retail and dining facilities. Some things that you must NOT miss out on are…\n\nHSBC Rain Vortex: The world’s tallest indoor waterfall at 40 meters high and the nucleus of Jewel. Open daily from 8AM to 12:30AM.\n\nCanopy Garden: Take a stroll along creative garden trails, glide down giant slides, or hide in bowls of gentle mist!\n\nCanopy Bridge: Suspended 23 meters above ground, with a glass bottom at the center portion for a gripping vantage point, the Canopy Bridge is sure to thrill and impress.\n\nManuLife Sky Nets: Experience the thrill of being almost weightless as you leap about this giant net! Stretching 250 meters long, even little ones can safely indulge in free play. At its highest point 8 meters above Canopy Park, you’ll feel like you can reach the sky.\n\nDiscovery Slides: As the name implies, this is a fun playground but also an amazing work of art!\n\nFoggy Bowls: Let your child slip in among puffs of cloud and hide away in gentle bowls of non-toxic mist. Kids will love the chance to play in this dreamy setting and let their imaginations take flight.\n\nShiseido Forest Valley: A lush green sanctuary and retreat in the core of Jewel.\n\nHedge Maze: Have a field day weaving your way through Singapore’s largest hedge maze. Be rewarded with a bird’s eye view of the maze’s intricate windings when you reach the watchtower at its core.\n\nNOTE: Jewel is found landside of Changi Airport so you need to clear immigration in order to explore this complex. But if you are short on time, you can still get a glimpse of this amazing building if you take the Skytrain that passes from Terminal 2 to Terminal 3 and back — or you can join a FREE tour (just click the second tab above for more details). Anyhow, Jewel is easily connected to the Arrival Hall of Terminal 1. A free airport shuttle bus service also goes between Terminal 4 and Terminal 2.\n\nTOP TIP: Check out this great-for-value Singapore Pass that will allow you to visit 2, 3, 4, or 5 attractions in Singapore for a discounted package deal!\n\n.\n\nChoose from any of these places: Universal Studios Singapore, Gardens by the Bay Singapore, Singapore Cable Car, Skyhelix Sentosa Singapore, Singapore Flyer ticket, Singapore Zoo, Singapore River Cruise, Big Bus Singapore tour, and many more! The pass has a long validity period of 30 days so it will offer you some flexibility in your schedule.\n\nExplore Singapore Changi Airport’s wonders!\n\nAs I’ve previously mentioned, Singapore Changi Airport is so huge that it can be a destination in itself, making it a perfect place to spend your Singapore layover. It’s no wonder that it’s the world’s best airport!\n\nSo if you ever find yourself with less than 6 hours’ worth of flight layover/stopover, below are the number of things that you can do to fill up the time.\n\nTIP: Are you flying with Singapore Airlines, SilkAir, or Air New Zealand…? If you are, don’t forget to claim your transit reward that is valued from SGD $20 at any of the iShopChangi Collection Centers at the transit areas of Terminals 2 and 3 (open 24 hours daily).\n\n.\n\n– Just present your passport, boarding pass, and e-tickets that show your full itinerary.\n\n.\n\n– Transit means that you have a layover at the airport that is not more than 24 hours.\n\n.\n\n– Your e-ticket numbers must begin with 618 or 629 or 086 and you must be on transit in Changi Airport on both legs of your journey — so no, one-way journey tickets are not eligible. If you’re flying with Air New Zealand, flight numbers are SQ4281, SQ4282, NZ281, or NZ282. If with Scoot, flight numbers are TR597 or TR596\n\n.\n\n– This transit reward can be used at all retail outlets in transit and public areas of Changi Airport. Or you can use it for a one-time access to the Ambassador Transit Lounge located in the transit areas of Terminals 2 or 3 for up to two (2) hours.\n\n.\n\n– For more information on this, go here\n\n◘◘ All Terminals\n\nPhotos by: Singapore Changi Airport\n\nAll of Singapore Changi Airport’s terminals (1 to 4) have the following things which sure makes for a fun Singapore layover…\n\nDuty-free shopping and dining shops (see a full list here).\n\nFREE foot massage on OSIM machines.\n\nPlay Area and/or Family Zone Fun for families with kids\n\n24-hour paid lounges with facilities for shower, foot reflexology, spa massages, etc. (best to have a Priority Pass on hand).\n\nPrayer rooms\n\nCharging points.
