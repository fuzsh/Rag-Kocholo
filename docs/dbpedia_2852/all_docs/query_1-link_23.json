This fully automated and driverless line, which opened in stages from 2010 to 2012, is known for its distinctive circular shape and serves as a key transportation link for residents and tourists alike. In this blog post, we will take a closer look at the Circle Line and all it has to offer.\n\nWhat is the Circle Line and where does it go?\n\nThe Circle Line is a 37-kilometer-long MRT line that connects major residential, commercial, and recreational areas in Singapore. It serves 29 stations, which are spread out across the city-state and are located in areas such as Bishan, Serangoon, and Paya Lebar.\n\nOne of the key features of the Circle Line is that it serves as a “loop line,” meaning that trains travel in a circular direction and passengers can board and alight at any station along the route. This makes it an ideal transportation option for those who are looking to travel within a specific area or want to connect to other MRT lines.\n\nThe Circle Line is also connected to other MRT lines, such as the North-East Line, the East-West Line, and the Downtown Line, providing convenient transfer options for passengers.\n\nWhat are the highlights of the Circle Line?\n\nThe Circle Line offers a range of amenities and attractions for passengers. Some of the highlights of the line include:\n\nConnections to major shopping centers: Several stations on the Circle Line are connected to major shopping centers, such as Nex Mall, Plaza Singapura, and Bugis Junction. This makes it easy for passengers to access these popular destinations.\n\nConnections to tourist attractions: The Circle Line also provides convenient access to popular tourist attractions, such as the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the National Museum of Singapore, and the ArtScience Museum.\n\nArt in Transit: The Circle Line is home to a number of art installations, which are part of the MRT’s “Art in Transit” program. These installations, which are located in various stations along the line, are designed to provide a visual feast for passengers and enhance the overall travel experience.\n\nConnections to parks and nature reserves: Several stations on the Circle Line, such as Botanic Gardens and Dover, are located near parks and nature reserves, making it easy for passengers to access these green spaces.\n\nWhat are the operating hours of the Circle Line?\n\nThe Circle Line operates from 5:30 a.m. to midnight on weekdays, and from 6:00 a.m. to midnight on weekends and public holidays. Trains on the line run at intervals of between 3 and 15 minutes, depending on the time of day.\n\nHow do I pay for my fare on the Circle Line?\n\nThere are several options for paying for your fare on the Circle Line. One option is to use an EZ-Link card, which is a prepaid smart card that can be used for travel on the MRT and other public transportation in Singapore. EZ-Link cards can be purchased at MRT stations and at various retail outlets.\n\nAnother option is to use a Tourist Pass, which is a special EZ-Link card that is specifically designed for tourists. Tourist Passes are available in 1-day, 2-day, and 3-day denominations and provide unlimited travel on the MRT and other public transportation in Singapore.\n\nYou can also pay for your fare using a cashless payment option, such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Samsung Pay."
