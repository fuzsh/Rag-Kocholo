An invitation awaits you to experience the rich tapestry of flavors and history at the Chinatown Hawker Centre on a sunny Sunday afternoon. This is not just an invitation to a meal. It is a gateway to understanding the essence of Singapore’s celebrated hawker culture, a cherished UNESCO-recognized heritage that brings together communities and flavors from around the world.\n\nThe story of Singapore’s Chinatown is a narrative of hope, resilience, and entrepreneurship. It began with Sir Stamford Raffles’ visionary 1822 Master Town Plan, which laid the foundations for the Chinese Campong, a settlement that would become the nucleus for Chinese immigrants seeking new opportunities in this land of promise. These pioneers, drawn from various dialect groups and provinces, formed a vibrant, self-contained community, with each enclave developing its own unique identity and contributing to a bustling ecosystem of trades and traditions.\n\nChinatown’s development surged in the nineteenth century as the area became a mosaic of cultural and commercial activity, with streets like Pagoda, Temple, Smith, and Trengganu becoming synonymous with the diverse enterprises of its inhabitants. This rich history has imbued the streets of Chinatown with a sense of identity and belonging, laying the groundwork for the bustling Chinatown Hawker Centre we see today.\n\nEstablished in 1983 and rejuvenated in 2019, the Chinatown Hawker Centre stands as Singapore’s largest, boasting over 700 stalls. It is a living museum of culinary artistry, where traditional recipes are handed down through generations and new flavors are constantly being forged. Among its famed stalls is Hawker Chan, a humble hawker stall that soared to international acclaim by earning a MICHELIN star in 2016, a testament to the quality and passion that defines Singapore’s hawker culture.\n\nThis lunch-around at the Chinatown Hawker Centre offers more than just a taste of Singapore’s best, it is an opportunity to walk through the pages of history, to see firsthand the entrepreneurial spirit that thrives in every stall, and to share in the communal joy that food brings in Singaporean culture.\n\nLet’s come together to share this experience, to be inspired by the stories of perseverance and innovation, and to enjoy the company of fellow entrepreneurs in the heart of Singapore.\n\nRegister Here\n\nDate: 12:30 PM, 21 April 2024 — 3:30 PM, 21 April 2024 ((GMT+08:00) Kuala Lumpur, Singapore)\n\nLocation: Chinatown Complex\n\nChampion: Don Tan\n\nCo-Champion: Lan Sin Ang\n\nPre 2024 GLC Singapore –Hosted Dinner by EO Couple, Annie & Jacob & CK Phua\n\nYou are invited for dinner at home hosted by Annie Yap, Jacob Lieu, and CK Phua!\n\nAnnie and Jacob are a dynamic husband and wife team who jointly helm a HR Tech business, empowering companies to expand their workforce into the Asia Pacific region.\n\nWith over a decade of experience in Entrepreneurs’ Organization (EO), Annie currently serves as the Forum Chair and incoming Membership and Accelerator Chair for EO Singapore.
