        "text": "Standing at 43km long and with 32 stations, the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) may be the newcomer of Singaporeâs rail lines, but itâs definitely raising the bar for the future!\n\nWhen completed, TEL is expected to serve around one million commuters in years to come and also promises faster access to the cityâa particular perk for those living in the east and along the North-South Corridor of Singapore. Travelling from Woodlands to Orchard, for instance, which now takes 50 minutes by bus and MRT, will be cut to just 35 minutes on one direct line.\n\nBut even if you donât live in these areas, there are plenty of reasons to celebrate TEL and the newly-opened Phase 3 (TEL3)âin fact, weâll give you 10.\n\n#1 More options, less crowds\n\nTEL is the first MRT rail line spanning eight interchanges that connect to all major lines: the East-West Line (EWL), North-South Line (NSL), North East Line (NEL), Circle Line (CCL) and Downtown Line (DTL).\n\nWith TEL3, Outram Park station will connect commuters with EWL, NEL and TEL, and has been upgraded to include wider travelators and walkways to ease the human traffic flow! Stevens station integrates with DTL, while those working in the CBD can also enjoy greater accessibility from Marina Bay station to intersect with CCL, NSL and TEL.\n\nWhat this means is that it can relieve the rush hour crowds on other lines, giving you more options for enhanced connectivity and more comfort on your daily commute.\n\n#2 Size matters\n\nCompared to the 70m-long Circle Line (CCL) and Downtown Line (DTL) trains, TEL trains are around 93m longâpractically the length of a football field. Each train also weighs 150 tonnes, which is as much as 32 adult elephants!\n\nThat equates to being able to carry more people and offer more space. Which coupled with how it has fiveâinstead of four doorsâon each side for boarding and alighting, makes it a more comfortable ride than what youâve had before!\n\n#3 Youâll always stay on track\n\nDo you sometimes get so engrossed playing with your phone or listening to music that you forget which station youâre atâ¦ and even miss your stop?\n\nThis can be avoided with TELâs new LCD Dynamic Route Map Display (DRMD). By showing you key information like the station map, arrival time and which side the train doors will open on, all you need to do is look up and youâre in the know.\n\n#4 Walking home is a breeze\n\nTEL stations are designed with more entrances, and longer pedestrian underpasses. Expect shelter from the sun and rain, and shorter walking times with new travel access optionsâ giving you even more reason to travel on foot and clock in your daily steps.\n\n#5 The first underground bicycle parking facilities\n\nJust like the other MRT lines in Singapore, TEL comes with priority boarding areas and barrier-free routes. And as a plus, every single station has family-friendly toilets with features like child-sized wash basins and baby care rooms, making it easier for you to bring your kids on public transport.\n\nAlso, did you know? There are special âHeart Zonesâ located at Outram Park station which allow wheelchair patients to visit the hospital(s) in the vicinity much more easily!\n\n#7 Each station has a unique character\n\nOur TEL stations are distinctive, each in its own right. They are also home to some pieces of LTAâs Art in Transit (AIT) programme, Singaporeâs largest public art showcase that integrates work from the countryâs leading local artists.\n\nSimply look up the next time youâre entering one of our MRT stations and youâll be sure to spot something special around the platform!\n\nCelebrate Singaporeâs nature and biodiversity at Gardens by the Bay and Napier stations, which feature green walls showcasing hundreds of indoor plants! Check out the natural lighting and ten umbrella-like columns at Gardens by the Bay that support the stationâs structure. Commuters and tourists alike can also enjoy natural ventilation that allows the sea breeze to flow through.\n\nWith Napier station located close to Singapore Botanic Gardens (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), commuters can find inspiration on all things plants, culture and history here. Feast your eyes on the tapestry of beautiful century-old paintings that serve botanic information, located on the interior walls of the station.\n\nWhat makes Napier really special too? Itâs the one and only station on TEL that had its architecture, structure and road alignment fully designed by LTA! This is unlike other locations that include working with external consultants for the designing of our stations.\n\nTake a stroll down memory lane at Great World station with nostalgic photographs based on old advertisements, re-enacted with present day participants who are choral singers, sports wrestlers, an opera performer and a film curator.\n\nSo keep your eyes peeled for the artworks the next time youâre at this station, and travel back to the wild and exciting time of the old Great World Amusement Park, bringing a part of Singaporeâs history alive!\n\nOther stations on TEL\n\nLentor station incorporates organic shapes, bamboo tree clusters and earthy tones reminiscent of the natural tropical settings of the area.\n\nWoodlands South station, true to its position as a gateway station to Singapore in the north, has on the other hand adopted a red and white colour scheme inspired by our national flag.\n\nThe next time youâre in the area, look out for Song-Ming Angâs 22 bird sculptures at Mayflower stationâs seven entrancesâa display inspired by the thriving songbird watching community in the neighbourhood. And if youâre passing Springleaf station, pause to revel in the beauty of Koh Hong Tengâs banyan tree, juxtaposed with buildings and artefacts around the estate!\n\n#8 Furthers Singaporeâs sustainability mission\n\nUpper Thomson station in particular, stands out for being a recipient of BCAâs Green Mark Platinum accolade. An underground station would be reliant on air-conditioning, but Upper Thomson station has ameliorated this by cutting its carbon footprint in other areas with its effective use of energy-saving technology like motion-sensor LED lighting systems and automatic dual-speed escalators and more.\n\nClick here to find out what makes our MRT stations green!\n\n#9 Saves land for our land-scarce nation\n\nTEL will in the future be part of a four-in-one train and bus depot. This comprises three train depots (including the Downtown Line and East-West Line) and one bus depot, with the capacity to house 220 trains and 760 buses in multi-storey complexes and saving over 60 football fields worth of land!\n\nItâs also the first of its kind, which leads us to the next point.\n\n#10 Full of firsts\n\nLast but not least, TEL is testament to the ingenuity and boldness of our engineers. It is no mean feat to ensure safety while developing our complex rail system, and theyâve courageously pioneered new methods to overcome the obstacles in their way."
