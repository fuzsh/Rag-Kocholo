        "text": "City Hall station has a total of four platforms, arranged in two stacked island platforms. The North South Line (NSL) and the East West Line (EWL) occupy two tracks each, enabling cross-platform interchange between lines. In particular, passengers arriving on the EWL from the East can conveniently transfer to the NSL towards Orchard and Toa Payoh by walking across the platform, and vice-versa for NSL (Southbound) to EWL (Eastbound).\n\nThe station has a combined ticket concourse located at Basement 1.\n\nEscalators, stairs and lifts connect the concourse with the platforms below. There are escalators that lead to Basement 2 and others that lead straight to Basement 3, and commuters are advised to follow the signages to the correct escalator."
