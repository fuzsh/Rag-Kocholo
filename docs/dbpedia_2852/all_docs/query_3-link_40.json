It’s a refreshing way to begin the day.\n\nLate Afternoon: In the late afternoon, from 4 pm to 6 pm, the weather begins to cool down, making it a pleasant time for outdoor activities. Plus, you can catch the beautiful sunset.\n\nAvoid Midday: Singapore can get very hot and humid in the midday sun, making it less comfortable for walking or cycling. It’s best to avoid the hours between 11 am and 3 pm.\n\nWeekends: Weekends are great for outdoor activities because you have more time to explore without rushing. Popular spots like East Coast Park and Sentosa are often bustling with cyclists and pedestrians on weekends.\n\nJaywalking is Illegal\n\nJaywalking in Singapore has been illegal since 1977. Offenders can face fines ranging from USD 20 to USD 2,000 (INR ₹20,000-₹16 lakh) or even imprisonment for up to 6 months. This strict law aims to ensure pedestrian safety and maintain smooth traffic flow. Crossing the road outside designated crossing zones is a serious offence, emphasising the importance of following traffic regulations in the city-state. So, when in Singapore, it’s essential to use pedestrian crossings and obey traffic signals to avoid penalties."
