        "text": "When one mentions Singapore, familiar tropes come to mind. Over-the-top mansions in Crazy Rich Asians, the infinity pool at Marina Bay Sands and incredibly expensive cars. When the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) Cost of Living survey declared Singapore as the world’s most expensive city – tied with Zurich – no one was surprised.\n\nBut what does it really cost to live in Singapore?\n\nWe break down the components behind EIU’s cost of living survey and what it really costs to live in the world’s most expensive city.\n\nFirst, it’s important to understand the methodology behind how EIU calculated cost of living in its survey.\n\nDesigned to help HR managers build compensation packages for relocated employees or ‘the international businessman’, the Worldwide Cost of Living survey does not include tax liabilities, home prices or rent. It also doesn’t include goods from local markets, bazaars and online marketplaces.\n\nInstead, it weighs the prices of more than 200 products and services, some of which are exceptionally costly in tropical and land-scarce Singapore. Its three biggest components are shopping basket (25%), transport (19.5%) and recreation and entertainment (18%), which includes green fees on golf courses, three-course dinners, prices of cars and their maintenance, and seasonal clothing.\n\nThis works against what life in Singapore looks like for the average resident. For example, it’s true that prices of car ownership is much higher in Singapore. However, with public transport easily accessible and much more affordable than other cities like London and New York, owning a car is not a necessity.\n\nGreen fees on golf courses are naturally much higher in a land-scarce city, and there is no need to account for seasonal clothing when it’s summer all year round.\n\nLike most cities, rent in Singapore is determined by proximity to the city centre and popular schools, the neighbourhood’s character and history, age of property and access to transport.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an upward trend in rent, triggered by shortages resulting from COVID-19 related construction delays, but this has since eased off to stable levels.\n\nPrivate apartments in Singapore’s glamorous city centre neighbourhoods like Tanglin and Marina Bay, the equivalent of New York’s Upper East Side or Wall Street, can set you back from $3,718 to $11,155 per month.\n\nWhat sets Singapore apart is the abundance of public housing (HDB) blocks in city fringe districts. Those in Farrer Park, Bukit Merah or Marine Parade are only 1 to 4 train stops or 5 to 15 minutes away from the city core. Many have a wealth of facilities such as eateries and clinics, as well as easy access to train stations, parks and places of worship.\n\nApartments in these blocks are owned by citizens and permanent residents, but they offer an affordable rental option for foreigners, particularly those flying solo.\n\nIf public housing isn’t to your fancy, many also live on the fringes of the city center instead. This opens your rental options to condominiums, apartments and even landed property. Given Singapore’s size and expansive public transport network, you’ll find that you’ll still be able to reach the Central Business District (CBD) or town centre within 30-45 mins for most of Singapore.\n\nRent in Singapore’s mid-tier and city-fringe neighbourhoods, like Paya Lebar and Redhill, can be cheaper than their equivalents in Shepherd’s Bush in London and Brooklyn, New York.\n\nAnother beneficial tax condition here is that income earned from employment outside of Singapore is not taxable. This includes income received in a Singapore bank account.\n\nThis contrasts with countries like the UK, where foreign income and capital gains are taxed if they are remitted to or used in the United Kingdom.\n\nIt’s also easy to file taxes in Singapore, where everything is digital and can be completed online. If your company is part of the auto-inclusion scheme, your taxes are automatically populated in IRAS’ system, and you’ll be able to file your taxes within 10 minutes!\n\nFor the latest information on taxes in Singapore, refer to the IRAS website here.\n\nWith one of the cheapest public transport systems in the world, Singapore comes out on top by a significant margin when compared to New York and London. New York’s base fares for subway and buses start at $2.90, while London’s peak-hour fares go up to a staggering $6.06.\n\nWait times between trains are short, averaging 4-6 minutes off-peak and 2-3 minutes during rush hours. Fun fact: the sleek and polished designs of our newer stations have been featured in international productions like HBO’s Westworld and the Netflix backed Korean drama, Little Women.\n\nOwning a car in Singapore is certainly pricier than in other countries – no argument about that! This is because the certificate of entitlement (COE) that every car owner must purchase averages a whopping $75,000 for a sedan – and that excludes the cost of the car, road tax, fuel, and insurance.\n\nIt’s a major contributing factor to Singapore being ranked the most expensive city in the EIU survey.\n\nThere’s a reason for it, though. Given Singapore’s small size, the volume of traffic on the road is carefully controlled to ensure we meet sustainability goals as well as avoid traffic gridlocks common to dense cities.\n\nPaired with Singapore’s compact size, an efficient and affordable public transport infrastructure means there is no need to own a car. This is unlike larger cities where driving an hour or more to your destination is common.\n\nIf you really need a car from time to time, rental services like GetGo are an affordable alternative that starts at $2.20/hour and go up to $65.50/day. Longer-term rentals start at $283/week for non-luxury models.\n\nTaxis and ride-hailing services like Grab, CDGzig or Gojek are readily available in Singapore for around $11 to $26 per trip, less if you opt for shared rides. They peak during rush hour and after the last train service, but if you’re out exploring the best of Singapore’s nightlife, you probably shouldn’t be driving anyway!\n\nFrequent flyers will be pleased to know that rides to and from Changi Airport are significantly cheaper compared to many major cities. The airport is also easily accessed via the MRT.\n\nIf you use a mix of these options, say a daily commute on public transport, a 3-hour rental every fortnight, ride-hailing twice a week and one round trip to the airport, you’ll average only about $260 to $300 per month.\n\nFor restaurant dining, the vast range in Singapore is a highlight for a nation of foodies. Casual dining costs about $15 to $26 per person, while world-class establishments like Odette will set you back by $311-$446 per pax for a 7-course dinner, not including wine.\n\nOther top-rated options at enclaves like Dempsey Hill and Marina Bay will cost you $72 to $224 per pax. These prices are mostly aligned with the dining scenes of other Asian cities like Hong Kong and Shanghai.\n\nIf you’re looking to immerse your children in local culture while experiencing Singapore’s renowned education system, public schools are an attractive choice. These schools offer more accessible fees and provide a strong bilingual foundation in English and mother-tongue languages.\n\nFor early childhood education, government-run kindergartens are subject to availability for foreigners. More than likely, you’ll have to depend on private operators, who charge anywhere from $520 up to $2,231 per month.\n\nLiving in Singapore may not be cheap, but it also isn’t necessarily as expensive as other top-tier cities. There are fewer hidden costs, public transport is affordable, taxes are lower, and it’s also a great base from which to explore the rest of Asia.\n\nSo why not tap into the hyper-convenience of Singapore and its stellar tax benefits?\n\nFor insights into picking the right school for your kids check out our guide to international schools in Singapore.\n\nThinking about which neighbourhood to move into?
