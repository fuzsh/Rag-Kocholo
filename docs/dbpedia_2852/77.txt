Raffles Place MRT Station (NS26/EW14) is an underground cross-platform interchange station along the North South Line (NSL) and East West Line (EWL). It is located near Battery Road and D’Almeida Street.

The station opened along with City Hall in December 1987 and both stations serve as cross-platform interchanges between the North South Line and East West Line, allowing commuters to switch trains at the appropriate station without having to ascend or descend platform levels. Raffles Place station offers Eastbound EWL & Northbound NSL trains on the upper level, and Westbound EWL & Southbound NSL on the lower level.

Raffles Place Station serves the financial district of the same name, at the mouth of the Singapore River. Named after the founder of modern Singapore, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, the area was at the heart of Singapore’s financial centre, with low-rise buildings housing mercantile offices, banks and trading companies in the past, which have made way for the tallest office buildings in Singapore. At street level, Raffles Place Park just above the station forms a green space nestled within Singapore’s iconic city landscape.

Below ground, a network of pedestrian underpasses connect the station to many nearby developments, hence the large number of exits. It also serves the subterranean Marina Bay Link Mall (Exit J), which extends further via an underground pedestrian mall network and eventually connects to DT17 Downtown station.

Gift of Art: “Symphony” by Rosa Serra

Donated by City Developments Limited, 2024.

This art piece was originally commissioned by City Developments Limited for its flagship 280-metre skyscraper, Republic Plaza at Raffles Place, and is now located at the entrance of Raffles Place station. Symphony represents the changes in the city over time, resembling a person in motion and celebrates the people who have helped make Singapore a global city. The bottom sphere represents Singapore’s past achievements while the sphere above symbolises the country’s ambition for the future. Sculpted in bronze by renowned Spanish artist Rosa Serra, Symphony captures her signature fluid forms to express motion.
