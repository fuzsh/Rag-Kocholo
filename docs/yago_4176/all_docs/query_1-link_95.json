        "text": "My husband has been getting screeners all month, we’ve been enjoying some great films—Manchester by the Sea, LaLa Land, Loving, Hacksaw Ridge*, Lion—last night we watched Silence, the long awaited Martin Scorsese adaptation of Shusaku Endo's acclaimed 1966 novel of the same name. While I usually like to see movies in the theatre, especially if I’m sharing my thoughts here, I didn’t want to wait until its January 6th release date to give it a look.\n\nWhat to say? It’s not a walk in the park. It’s a heavy, morose long look at Catholicism and the idea of renouncing ones faith. The story takes place in 17th century Japan after Christianity has been banned, priests expelled. Prior to the expulsion, Japanese Christian converts numbered in the hundreds of thousands. After the crackdown, the practice of Christianity was forbidden, its practice dangerous and yet some Catholic peasants held on to their beliefs, praying at night, in secret.\n\nTwo young priests, Padre Rodrigues (Andrew Garfied) and Garrpe (Adam Driver) go on a mission to Japan to find their mentor, Father Ferrara (Liam Neeson) rumored to have renounced his faith and taken a Japanese name and living with a wife and children, his religion buried.\n\nMost of the film is about the two young priests who risk their own lives to save him and his soul, and in doing so encounter remaining Japanese Christian peasants who must hide their religion or risk torture and death. Scorsese is relentless in pursuit of this theme—the idea of apostasy—and we see countless peasants who struggle with the idea of stepping on a small tablet engraved with Christ’s image. If they refuse to do this, it is proof they are Christians, and therefore they are imprisoned, tortured and put to death. If they tread on the tablet, it proves they are not Christian and they are set free.\n\nOther methods used are tying the suspected Christian to a stake at the water’s edge and leaving him there until he gives up and renounces Christ or dies. Sometimes, to convince the Japanese peasants the overlords mean business, they are wrapped in grass mats and hung upside down with their heads in dark holes.Then there’s the ever-popular wrap them in grass mats and light them on fire.\n\nAll to prove one’s lack of faith in God. Crosses, religious carvings, any kind of Christian image is forbidden. These are scenes that recur time and again. And again.\n\nSilence is Martin Scorsese’s passion project, one that has haunted him for over thirty years so I suppose you can’t begrudge him the two hour forty minute length but oof, that’s a lot of relentless darkness.\n\nThere is much to admire. Garfield and Driver, who I’m most familiar with as contemporary actors, surprised me with their ability to dive so deeply into the roles of two Portuguese Jesuit priests. The actor who played Kichigiro, the former Christian and their guide (Yôsuke Kubozuka), the Japanese inquisitor Inoue (Issey Ogata) who provides almost comic relief and the translator (Tadanobu Asano) were all compelling, intriguing characters. But. Ultimately it is too dark, too weighty, and especially too redundant. We welcome movies that question big ideas, tackle weighty issues, but movies are not essays. Movies need to move.\n\nI hate to say I didn’t love what Scorsese would no doubt wish to be a masterpiece but I didn’t. For all the burning at the stake and tortured cries, I remained distant, horrified intellectually but not terribly moved.\n\nI am aware the movie was released this month in order to qualify for the Academy Awards. Sadly, Silence, is not golden.\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\n*If you want to see Andrew Garfield in a really stunning tour de force, check out Hacksaw Ridge.\n\nRing in the New Year with War and Peace starring Lily James, Paul Dano and James Norton\n\nWar and Peace: on the set of the BBC's epic Tolstoy adaptation With a cast that includes Lily James and Paul Dano, the BBC's War and Peace is as grand as its subject matter. Lucinda Everett goes behind the scenes I don’t know why The Telegraph didn’t include James Norton in the headline for their article about the upcoming six part series. Norton plays Prince Andrei, the dark, moody—frankly sexy—third part of the love triangle between Natasha (Lily James) and nice guy Pierre Bezhukov (Paul Dano). I would have thought that he’d rate some headline action, especially for a British paper. Anyone who has seen Norton in Happy Valley knows he has good looks, certainly, but also the deep dark chops that are soon going to make his the mandatory name to include if you want to draw in readers. That being said, grumble grumble, the report from the set is a great read, whetting my appetite for this lavish period drama made on the cheap.

A trip through the Parisian locations used in the classic film Gigi, based on the book by Colette, and one of my favorite film classics . Originally published 3/30/2015 \" Gigli ?\" my son asks, wondering why I'd be at all interested in the Ben Affleck, J-Lo disaster, the epitome of a bad romance, made even worse because its epic failure has been immortalized on film. \" No! Not Gigli. Gigi . Very famous movie musical? Takes place in Paris during the Belle Epoque? Won 9 Oscars? Starred Leslie Caron and Louis Jourdan? Vincent Minelli directed? \" \" Hmmm\" he nods, a shrugging respect for the director, meaning maybe he'll watch it with me one day especially as he's also curious about the Belle Epoque and wouldn't mind going back to Paris and getting a\n\nJane Fonda's big fake boobs and 5 more things you need to know about the movie 'This is Where I Leave You'\n\nI really can't wait to see the adaptation of Jonathan Tropper's This is Where I Leave You which I discovered and blogged about a year ago . It's mostly because I'm a major fan of the legendary Jane Fonda who stars as Hillary Foxman, the celebrity child shrink who compels her family to sit shiva after her husband and the father of their four adult children dies. Sitting shiva, fyi dear gentile readers, is the traditional Jewish way to mourn the death of a close family member, and calls for the family to gather together for 7 days (shiva = seven) while friends and other relatives come, often bearing food, to pay their respects and share memories. Seven days together with your family. In the case of the Foxmans, the four adult children -Judd (Jason Bateman), Wendy (Tina Fey), Phillip (Adam Driver) and Paul (Corey Stoll) - come in various stages of reluctance and wariness, depending on their personal baggage, which they all bring in spades.
