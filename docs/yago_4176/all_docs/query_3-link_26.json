        "text": "Napoleon\n\nFront Row at the Movies by Shirrel Rhoades\n\n[mr_rating_result]\n\nWith Ridley Scott’s new “Napoleon” hitting movie houses, we can’t help but think about Abel Gance’s 1927 silent masterpiece of the same name.\n\nGance’s original film ran nine hours and 40 minutes when first shown at the Apollo Theatre in Paris. However, with much of the footage lost or destroyed, that version hasn’t been seen since. What’s left is still remarkable. The restored film runs only five hours and 32 minutes.\n\nBy comparison, Elizabeth Taylor’s “Cleopatra” was four hours and 8 minutes. “Gone With the Wind,” three hours and 58 minutes. “Lawrence of Arabia,” three hours and 36 minutes. “Titanic,” three hours and 14 minutes.\n\nDon’t panic.\n\nRidley Scott’s “Napoleon” only runs two hours and 38 minutes. However, his four-hour director’s cut will later be released on Apple TV+.\n\nBack in the day, Abel Gance’s “Napoléon” created a Cinemascope-like widescreen format by projecting three images side by side. It was quite innovative – and spectacular – for its time.\n\n“The film is recognized as a masterwork of fluid camera motion, produced in a time when most camera shots were static,” noted Francis Ford Coppola. “Many innovative techniques were used to make the film, including fast cutting, extensive closeups, a wide variety of hand-held camera shots, location shooting, point of view shots, multiple camera setups, multiple exposure, superimposition, underwater camera, kaleidoscopic images, film tinting, split screen, and mosaic shots, multi-screen projection, and other visual effects.”\n\nThe new rendition holds its own, utilizing the improved cinematic techniques available to today’s filmmakers. As Sony Pictures describes it: “Against a stunning backdrop of large-scale filmmaking orchestrated by legendary director Ridley Scott, the film captures Bonaparte’s relentless journey to power through the prism of his addictive, volatile relationship with his one true love, Josephine, showcasing his visionary military and political tactics against some of the most dynamic practical battle sequences ever filmed.”\n\nMany like it. “It’s almost as if the trajectory of Ridley Scott’s career was leading up to this film, but I don’t think I was expecting ‘Napoleon’ to leave me this moved. As this very well could be the best film he’s ever directed….”\n\nNot every moviegoer agrees. “Making a movie on a charismatic person like Napoleon is a huge undertaking. It requires an in-depth study of his life and then choosing specific events of his life to show and connecting them to perfection. The film maker is short on time; therefore, it is important for the movie to be precise, fluent and with a purpose. In this movie, the director, Ridley Scott, fails to determine which points of his life he wishes to portray and consequently it results in a piece-by-piece movie that lacks cinematic flow and confuses the audience.”\n\nThe Washington Post calls it “a mash-up of Leo Tolstoy, Edward Albee and Wikipedia.” USA Today says, “Satirical comedy, battlefield brutality, and personal tragedy mix, yet never completely gel ….”\n\nRotten Tomatoes gave Ridley Scott’s “Napoleon” a 61% rating. Abel Gance’s “Napoleon” maintains an 88% Tomatometer ranking.\n\nAside from its scope of battle scenes, the main reason to catch the new movie is that it stars Joaquin Phoenix as Napoleon Bonaparte. This is the first time Phoenix and Ridley Scott have been reunited since “Gladiator” (2000).\n\nAn Academy Award-winner, Joaquin Phoenix (né Joaquin Rafael Bottom) is as talented as he is quirky. The New York Times names him as one of the greatest actors of the 20th Century. You’ll remember his performances in “Walk the Line,” “The Master,” “Hotel Rwanda,” “Her,” and “Joker.”\n\nHis portrayal of Napoleon has received mixed reviews. The New York Times described it as the portrait of “a lumpy, grumpy little man.” Australian Broadcast Corporation says, “Joaquin Phoenix brings neuroticism and complexity to Ridley Scott’s epic.” The New York Post calls it “Another Joaquin Phoenix looney tunes.” And Variety says Phoenix gives “a mumbly and oddly anti-charismatic performance….”\n\nNonetheless, The New York Times concludes, “Joaquin Phoenix is oddly mesmerizing as the French emperor in Ridley Scott’s historical epic.” The Guardian declares, “Joaquin Phoenix makes a magnificent emperor.” And Collider tells us, “Joaquin Phoenix delivers a commanding performance as Napoleon, portraying the character’s brilliance on the battlefield and his complex relationship with Empress Joséphine, played by Vanessa Kirby.”\n\nVulture sums it up: “Ridley Scott’s new historical epic ‘Napoleon’ isn’t good, but at least it gives us an unforgettably weird Joaquin Phoenix performance.” India Today adds, “It is one of those performances which makes you flinch and applaud at the same time.”\n\nIn contrast, Abel Gance’s “Napoléon” is considered to be one of the greatest and most innovative films of the silent era. Albert Dieudonné plays the titular role to perfection.\n\nBoth movies tell us how an obscure French army general became one of history’s most powerful men. But only one of them is available this week at your local movie house."
