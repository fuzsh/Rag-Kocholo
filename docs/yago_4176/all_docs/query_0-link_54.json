        "text": "Last month, the big recurring theme was vampires, and we're gonna have a few more of the undead this month, as well. But first, we're taking a trip to Paris, for Mario Bava's Hatchet for the Honeymoon, released in Italy on June 2nd.\n\nIt centers on a demented photographer who murders his models, and his relationship with his domineering wife. Ah, the good old days when you could refuse to grant your spouse a divorce, basically holding them hostage. And don’t think this was just a European problem, you can also see this in The Psycho Lover from the United States. Land of the Free!\n\nThis film is definitely a step up from Bava’s last film, Five Dolls for an August Moon, a return to form, to an extent. It has more of Bava’s signature visual style, with wide angles, vibrant colors, and heavy shadows. More importantly, the story is far more entertaining, the standout being Laura Betti as the monstrous wife that makes you root for her killer husband to finish her off.\n\nThen, on the 7th, Crescendo was released in the United Kingdom. It's Hammer Time once again!\n\nThis one stars Stefanie Powers as a woman visiting France to write her thesis who decides to stay at yet another old villa with a strange family.\n\nIt's very much a hodge-podge of Hammer's greatest hits, with a character in a wheelchair being manipulated and gaslit by their guardian like in Taste of Fear, and Powers once again dealing with a domineering mother like in Die! Die! My Darling.\n\nWhile this film certainly lacks a powerhouse performer like Tallulah Bankhead or the visual flair of a Douglas Slocombe, it's still a serviceable enough thriller. There's enough to keep you entertained, like a British actress doing an over-the-top French accent who strips down multiple times. And if there's one overarching theme this month, it's old French houses with a room full of mannequins.\n\nIf you can't get enough of those old French houses, then the film Midi minuit has got you covered. It was released in France on the 10th.\n\nThis is another film about a group of eccentric upper class folks staying in an old European house where there’s a killer stalking around, and this one has more lame quips and French snobbery. It is quite dull, with the one highlight being the murder weapon, this clawed armature ala Freddy Krueger, or Cüneyt Arkin as Lionman.\n\nNow we're gonna fly back to the United States, to Los Angeles to be exact, where, on the same day, Count Yorga, Vampire was released, or as it was titled originally, The Loves of Count Iorga, Vampire.\n\nThe film is narrated by George Macready, best remembered as General Paul Mireau in Stanley Kubrick’s Paths Of Glory. It’s a Macready family affair, with George’s son Michael in the cast. Michael also produced the film. Don’t be fooled by the prestige of the Macready name, because this is a cheap film.\n\n“Good morning, soldier. Ready to kill more vampires?”\n\nIt features a young Michael Murphy, two years before his electrifying breakout performance as the whistle-blower in What's Up, Doc?\n\nHere, he's hanging out with his girl in their van, bickering for a while before being attacked by Count Yorga. This was when the average American woman resented the notion of having a fat ass.\n\nThe two of them survive the attack, and the next day, Murphy comes home and is shocked to find his girl eating some pussy.\n\nThis one’s a pretty schlocky low-budget affair that might be worth seeing if you like vampires, or wanna see L.A. in the early '70s, or hear the rich voice of Robert Quarry as the Count. Apparently, it was successful enough back in the day to gain a cult following and even a sequel.\n\nWe're gonna stay in L.A. on the 10th for the even lower-budget sexploitation stinker Sinthia: The Devil's Doll. It was directed by schlockmeister Ray Dennis Steckler (under the pseudonym Sven Christian). You can tell how proud most of the crew was to be working on this, since their credits last less than two seconds each.\n\nIt's about a woman meeting with her psychiatrist, trying to resolve her trauma after killing her parents when she was a girl. This therapy session takes us on a psychotronic journey inside her mind, where she meets Lucifer in Hell, among other acid-fueled oddities. If hearing a shrill grown woman cry out for \"Daddy!\" over and over is your idea of a good time, then knock yourself out, I guess.\n\nUp next, we return to West Germany for the premiere of the Brazilian film Prophet of Hunger at the Berlin International Film Festival, although, according to IMDb, it did play in Brazil the previous year.\n\nThe film follows the misadventures of a circus troupe, with the standout character being a daredevil played by the infamous Jose Mojica Marins. I had a decent chuckle at first when they bring out a man in a lion costume, trying to pretend it's a real lion by playing a record of a roaring lion, which then proceeds to skip, causing the audience to mob the lion cage.\n\nIt soon goes downhill, however, and becomes rather a chore. I struggled to stay awake by the end. It's very loose on story and dicks around too much.\n\nIf you wanna see Jose Mojica Marins in the role that made him a star, then you can see him in Awakening of the Beast, released on an unspecified date in 1970.\n\nDepending on who you ask, this is either the third film in a trilogy starring Marins' Coffin Joe character, or it’s rather one of the many spin-offs featuring the character. Coffin Joe doesn’t appear until the last third. Marins also directs the film, as he did with most of the Coffin Joe films.\n\nThe majority of the film consists of Marins, as the filmmaker, attempting to be as provocative and profane as he can, beginning with a woman stripping for a group of old bums before relieving herself into a bowl. This is then followed by another group of perverts climbing up a woman’s skirt and removing her underwear, before a man dressed as Moses arrives with a wooden staff to pleasure the woman.\n\nWhen Coffin Joe finally appears, he brings some select members of his audience down to Hell, where the film goes to color, and Joe subjects them to all manner of imaginative torment.\n\nFinally, we shall end on the 20th with the premiere of Blind Woman's Curse in Japan. The film was directed by Teruo Ishii, who made a name for himself in the late '60s by making a series of films that are best described as torture porn.\n\nWith this film, he brings us an early 20th century yakuza story with a blind woman joining a crime family in order to take revenge on the matriarch of the opposing crime family for blinding her with a sword. There's sufficient blood, but it's not as graphic and cruel as Ishii's earlier work.\n\nThe blind woman's revenge consists of killing members of the clan and skinning their backs to steal their dragon tattoos. The skin is then carried away by a black puppet cat.\n\nIt reaches a climax when the two women finally face off in a duel of resting bitch faces."
