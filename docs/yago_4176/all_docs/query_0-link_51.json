        "text": "As hard as it is to believe, I've known Owensboro-based filmmaker PJ Starks for more than 15 years. From his early short films to feature-length horror movies, I've watched him evolve into an accomplished independent movie director.\n\nHorror has always been Starks' domain of choice, and come June, he'll be walking the red carpet as his and his partner Eric Huskisson's latest work New Fears Eve enjoys a premiere at Owensboro's RiverPark Center. It's a film that's already been showcased at the Chicago Horror Film Festival where it won Best Horror Comedy.\n\nAlso, New Fears Eve has just been chosen as an official selection at the Wolf Media Festival. It has also racked up a number of nominations.\n\nThis time around, PJ ventures into horror comedy in the tale of three friends who decide to attend a New Years Eve party being thrown by the company they work for. As the clock moves ever closer to striking midnight, the blood begins to spill...accompanied, of course, by lots of laughs. Here's a preview:\n\nOf the film and the work put into its creation, Starks said, \"This film has been over two years in the making. A ton of insanely talented creatives, local and abroad, worked tirelessly to bring this thing from script to screen. I don't think I could be more excited about our community getting to see our new holiday slasher. It has laughs. It has scares. It has drama. But one of things it has most, is home. Owensboro is all over this film. It's a true testament to the level of creativity we have in our area. June 15th is going to be one helluva night.\"\n\nJeffrey Reddick, a Kentucky-based actor and a co-producer, was thrilled to work on a project here in the Commonwealth:\n\nI had an amazing time working on New Fears Eve, which is a great blend of comedy and horror. Being from Eastern Kentucky, I hope that my involvement in this indie film helps shine a light on all of the amazingly talented people across The Bluegrass State. Both to inspire creative people to follow their dreams and to show the state how important it is to support the arts... which in so many ways, and riches, peoples hearts and soulsâ€¦and can bring grade up economic opportunities to Kentucky.\n\nNew Fears Eve will premiere at Owensboro's RiverPark Center on Saturday, June 15th. The doors will open at 7 PM; the film will begin at 7:45. Afterward, there will an After Party in the lobby from 9:30 PM until 11 PM.\n\nThe carpet will, of course, be red...maybe BLOOD red?"
