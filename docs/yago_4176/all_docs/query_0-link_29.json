        "text": "Walter Kerr, now retired, is a winner of the Pulitzer Prize for criticism and the author of ''The Silent Clowns,'' a study of comics in pre-sound films. He was formerly drama critic of The New York Times.\n\nHAVE YOU BEEN wondering what it is that's missing from the movies lately? I think I have a clue. A little more than a year ago I took a plane to Jamaica and then, after eight days of midwinter hiding out on the sands, took another plane back to New York. It just so happened that the in-flight movie on both trips was ''The Verdict,'' starring Paul Newman and directed by Sidney Lumet. And it just so happened that I'd already seen it.\n\nSo I didn't ask for earphones, planning to read the trip away. Alas, even if nothing is occupying your ear, that projected image has a way of sidetracking your eye - it's the cutting that does it, the constant and violent alterations of light - and both times I wound up watching far more of the film than I'd planned to. Not because it was riveting without its voice. It wasn't. But because in addition to its initial bid for attention, it was presenting me with a problem. Hearing nothing and being able only to see, I was watching shot after shot waiting for one that would give me a degree of visual satisfaction, visual pleasure. There were none.\n\nI don't mean to suggest that Lumet had failed to keep his actors on the move or to provide them with a plausible world through which to move. Characters hurried along corridors, paused by carved newel posts, climbed and descended staircases, passed in and out of courtrooms and bars and whatnot. But I gradually realized that everything they were doing might have been done just as well in other hallways, rooms, bars. Their relationship to their visual environment was arbitrary, irrelevant - as though actors and director were obliged to make use of whatever stairwells in whatever official-looking buildings chanced to be available that day.\n\nAnd, worse, their relationship to the spaces in which they moved could afford to be arbitrary and irrelevant for the simple reason that everything of importance to the film was contained in its dialogue, nothing in its visual texture. I was looking at a motion picture, but the essential thing about any motion picture - the moving image - had no real function to perform. The actors' words told the story; the actors' words revealed character. The picture was left with little to do. I finally realized, with some alarm, that I was watching a film made up of images that were not in themselves expressive.\n\nHow dumb, I thought. And how long has this been going on, I wondered. I did not put myself to the torture of running 20 or 40 contemporary films with the sound turned off just to see how widespread the indifference to a meaningful fusion of sound and sight might be. But, jogging my memory a bit and trusting to instant recap, I was surprised to remember how often I'd concentrated on listening rather than looking when I'd needed a clue to the unfolding narrative, how rarely - of late - I'd felt mysteries of behavior in stantly resolved by a gesture, a glance, a thing done in a space that lent the deed special weight.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
