        "meta_description": "The Martin Scorsese film Silence is a fairly faithful adaptation of a novel of the same name written by the Japanese writer Endō Shūsaku (1923-1996) in 1966. Previous academic reviews of this film have provided excellent hindsight into the historical background surrounding the events it depicts. However, while the book Silence is based on some research, above all, it is a work of fiction; that is, historical elements are largely adapted to fit the purpose of the story. As one can infer from E...",

        "text": "Historical Context\n\n4However, with the centralization of local political power since the mid-sixteenth century that followed a period of long civil wars inside the Japanese archipelago, authorities banned the practice of the Catholic faith from the whole country. At that time, the main destination of the missionaries shifted to China or to Southeast Asia. In Europe, Japan became the subject of hagiographical stories of heroic Christian martyrs who had been the targets of cruel “persecutions” conducted by oriental “tyrants.” It was thus no longer an actual field of evangelization. Under these circumstances, European missionaries could only enter the country clandestinely – just as Sebastião Rodrigues and Francisco Garrpe are depicted in the film.\n\n5Endō himself actually studied the history of Japanese Christianity under one of the best specialists of his time, the Jesuit Hubert Cieslik, who was a professor at the Sophia University in Tōkyō. The general context in the film is thus concordant with what contemporary sources tell us. However, as in most fictional works, depicting actual history was not his goal, and many details were adapted or modified to better fit the story. He follows a very complex narration scheme, sometimes using a third-person point of view, and most of the book relates the view of the main protagonist, mostly through letters.\n\nThe Missionaries\n\n7In the book, Endō uses a similar blend of history and fiction on several occasions. In fact, the main character, Sebastião Rodrigues, Rodrigo in the film, is the alter ego of an actual historical figure, an Italian Jesuit called Giuseppe Chiara (1602–1685). Alongside such characters based on history, we also find purely fictional characters, such as Francisco Garrpe, who was invented by Endō in order to provide a contrast with Rodrigo.\n\nKichijirō, the Judas\n\nGovernor Inoue and His Dialogue with Rodrigo\n\n17The Japanese proceedings of this interrogation can also be seen in a source called the Kirishitoki. However, the rhetoric used to persuade Chiara and his companions is slightly different. It focuses on the absence of miracles after another missionary’s death (p. 655). In the book and the film, very little is said about miracles. This is a major departure from actual historical sources, where they are omnipresent, especially the Western ones. Endō’s story is more in line with a twentieth-century mentality, in the sense that he tends to avoid depicting paranormal or supernatural elements. However, such elements were very much part of the world view of missionaries in the seventeenth century.\n\nA Pornography of Torture ?\n\nThe Interdiction of Christianity\n\nConclusion - “Kakure Kirishitan”, Faith and Conversion\n\n29In the film, Rodrigo and Garrpe are deeply moved when they see local Christians who kept their faith in secret, despite all the risk. While this was initially true when the Hidden Christians (Kakure Kirishitan) were rediscovered in the nineteenth century, in fact their unusual set of beliefs was quickly deemed as incorrect. They were thus encouraged to re-baptize and join the true faith."
