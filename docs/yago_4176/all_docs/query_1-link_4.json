        "text": "Martin Scorsese’s new film, “Silence,” opens with a depiction of horrors—the torture, crucifixion, and execution of Christians in Japan in 1633—along with a description, in voice-over, by a Portuguese missionary named Ferreira (Liam Neeson), who witnessed the terrifying events. In Scorsese’s movies, pain is the standard by which to measure truth, and both the nature of pain and the notion of truth, the physical struggle to survive and the moral struggle to bear witness, are at the center of the story.\n\nScorsese has never made a Western, but “Silence” is the closest thing to it—it’s his version of John Ford’s “The Searchers.” Two Portuguese Jesuit priests, Fathers Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garrupe (Adam Driver), who are Ferreira’s disciples, are summoned by their superior, Father Valignano (Ciarán Hinds), to read Ferreira’s letter about the campaign of extermination against Christians that he has witnessed in Japan. They are informed that Ferreira subsequently renounced his Christian faith (or “apostatized,” a word that dominates the film throughout) and then disappeared. Hearing this, Rodrigues and Garrupe decide to go to Japan and find him. These priests, however, are no grizzled and hardened John Wayne-esque battlers; young and unworldly, they pursue their mission into the whirlwind of persecution with a boyishly naïve confidence that's quickly shattered by the array of torments that they observe and endure.\n\nThe Western is the philosophical and political genre par excellence, because it considers a pre-bureaucratic state in which societal functions are realized onscreen in direct, physical action. In “Silence,” Scorsese borrows the genre’s stripped-down framework in order to observe the physical exertion of brutal power. He depicts Japanese society thinly but unfolds in elaborate, obsessively repetitive yet finely varied detail the agonies inflicted upon Japan’s Christian converts and the European missionaries who minister to them, as well as the intellectual arguments mustered by Japanese officials to justify their exactions and by missionaries to defend their own activities.\n\nThe cruelties that Rodrigues and Garrupe encounter in Japan reach to the core of Scorsese’s cinematic identity. These afflictions conjure bitter, wild, almost absurd ironies regarding faith and devotion that cast a strange, self-mocking glint over his entire career. Adapted from a 1966 novel by Shusaku Endo, “Silence” approaches grave philosophical, political, and psychological matters unflinchingly. It rises to a harrowing crescendo of overlapping strains of agony—physical and emotional, spiritual and moral—that is among the strangest, most intricately tangled of all of Scorsese’s creations.\n\nYet it takes two hours for Scorsese to reach that inspired height. Until that point, the movie suffers from literary-ism, a mode of direction that illustrates a set of events with a relentlessly expository, nearly impersonal tone. (One detail that exemplifies the constraint is the Portuguese accent with which Garfield and Driver are saddled.) Much of “Silence” seems inhibited by Scorsese’s devotion to the subject, as if it risked corruption by the intervention of cinematic hedonism. The quasi-anonymous direction of much of the film paradoxically flattens precisely the intimate connection to its ideas and emotions that inspired his adaptation. “Silence” is only a near-great film, one in which the very power of its subject—and of Scorsese’s devotion to it—appears largely to restrain his distinctive artistry.\n\nRodrigues and Garrupe make their way to the Portuguese colony of Macao and, from there, are smuggled into Japan on a Chinese boat; their guide is Kichijiro (Yôsuke Kubozuka), a Japanese Christian in exile who was monstrously victimized by the government yet longs to return home despite the agonies that he endured there. Kichijiro saw his entire family put to death by the authorities for refusing to renounce their faith; Kichijiro, however, saved himself by apostatizing, and—as horrified by what he did as by what he saw, as tortured by his survival as by his grief—is left a broken man. Upon his return to Japan, Kichijiro rejoins the small band of clandestine, cave-dwelling Christians who welcome Rodrigues and Garrupe. Yet Kichijiro recurs throughout the film as a mildly comedic foil as well as a relentlessly tragic plague, a fragile and cowardly man whose weakness itself is a test of the priests’ own faith. (Rodrigues’s dream of saving Kichijiro’s soul gives rise to a sublime vision of religious vanity—the priest, looking at his own reflection in a standing pool, becomes a Christian Narcissus, who imagines his own bearded face morphing with the face of Jesus.)\n\nEventually, Rodrigues and Garrupe separate—Garrupe heads off in search of Ferreira, while Rodrigues remains with the clandestine Christians. Scorsese stays with Rodrigues, who becomes the movie’s protagonist, ministering to the isolated Christians while also bringing danger upon them. Much of the movie’s action depicts the increasingly horrific persecutions visited upon them in an effort to break them of their faith, which Rodrigues’s presence has reinvigorated.\n\nWhen Rodrigues himself is arrested, he seeks to confront his (and all Japanese Christians’) main persecutor, Inquisitor Inoue (Issey Ogata). Even as Inoue engages Rodrigues in extended intellectual debates about religious doctrine and national character, he also conceives elaborate tortures—mental and moral as well as physical—with which to break Rodrigues’s will, to besmirch his faith, and, ultimately, to extirpate the very roots of Christianity from Japan. Their relationship, which dominates the climax of the film, is the movie’s crucial one. The priest’s ultimate reunion with Ferreira—another victim of Inoue’s machinations—is itself a crucial stage in those tortures.\n\nInoue is a master of communications as well as power; he understands and manipulates the popular power of symbols. He doesn’t shrink from the most monstrous inflictions—he orders Christians to be crucified in the sea and left to drown in a rising tide, wrapped in mats and tossed from a boat to drown, burned alive, beheaded, or, in the ultimate punishment, called “the pits,” hung upside-down by the feet as their blood slowly drips out from a small incision behind the ear. But the baseline act of apostasy that Inoue demands of Christians is ludicrously simple: he places them before a small embossed-metal portrait of Jesus and orders them to step on it. Yet most of the coerced Christians refuse even this small gesture and suffer agonizing torture and death instead.\n\nBoth Inoue and the Christian resisters themselves understand that the essence of apostasy isn’t the insult to the sacred image but the very fact of acting against their will; he challenges their faith by challenging their freedom. Scorsese depicts the spiritual trial of a band of Christian Bartlebys who prefer not to step on a portrait of Jesus; the pain that they’re willing to endure for their refusal is what defines their faith. The silence of the title is God’s—a silence that is the subject of Rodrigues’s anguished lament at his apparent impassivity in the face of human suffering. For the priest, the most horrific suffering isn’t his own torture but observing the suffering of others. That’s why Inoue reserves for him the cruellest torture of all: the threat to harm other captive Christians if Rodrigues won’t renounce his faith.\n\nIt’s only after Rodrigues is arrested by Inoue that Scorsese’s inspiration bursts uninhibitedly forth—launched by a single shot, in which Scorsese’s camera identifies, audaciously and agonizingly, with Rodrigues at a moment of nearly unendurable emotional pain. The prison in which Inoue confines Rodrigues is a masterwork of design, a sort of panopticon that works both ways: the cells are small freestanding pavilions set around a courtyard, and their walls are vertical slats that leave a constant yet obstructed view of the horrific exactions that occur in the courtyard. Scorsese’s inspiration involves a tensely anguished sequence of terrifying violence, which he films from Rodrigues’s point of view in an extended and nervously rapid pan shot, back and forth, that’s as much dominated by the slats blocking that view as by the unendurable events that the priest is forced to behold. (It’s a reminder that the primal meaning of “martyr” is “witness.”)\n\nWhile “Silence” is structured like a Western, it evokes the tone and the substance of Second World War dramas, starting with the repeated mention of Nagasaki as the center of anti-Christian persecutions. The depictions of the torture and execution of members of one religious group bring to mind the Holocaust; the character of Inoue, with his unctuous justifications of his murderous reign, suggests generations of dapperly ironic and intellectual screen Nazis, and, for that matter, the sardonic and nasal pomposity of Ogata’s performance makes for a perfect replica of a classic Nazi movie villain—it closely resembles both Dan Seymour’s, as a Vichy official, in Howard Hawks’s “To Have and Have Not,” and Christoph Waltz’s, as an S.S. officer, in Quentin Tarantino’s “Inglourious Basterds.” Kubozuka plays Kichijiro with an agitated and fawning manner that’s reminiscent of Peter Lorre’s performance in “Casablanca.” What’s more, when a Japanese Christian greets Rodrigues by making the sign of the cross, he does it close to his neck, so that it looks rather like the miming of a throat-slitting—a gesture distinctly reminiscent of a moment in Claude Lanzmann’s “Shoah.”\n\nThe last half hour or so of “Silence,” in which Rodrigues confronts horrors and torments such as he could never have imagined, is one of the most terrifyingly hectic sequences in all of Scorsese’s work—and its frenzies are all the more wrenching for being rendered in something close to stillness. The emotional equivalent of ear-blasting guitars, head-banging drums, and screams of broken rage fill a series of scenes in which Scorsese dramatizes soul-murder with a chillingly self-repressive moderation. The howling confusion of faith and destruction, life force and political terror, builds to an inchoate fury of self-doubt and bravado, reverence and bewilderment, that both sharpens and threatens to shatter Scorsese’s own cinematic passion for self-destructive martyrs.\n\nThe movie’s extraordinary conclusion—anchored by a letter to parallel the one by Ferreira that begins the film—redefines the very notion of martyrdom and of the bearing of witness. With a shiver of irony, Scorsese reaches far within himself and far beyond himself, beyond even the scope of his formidable technique, to test the very threshold of the cinema. At its terrifying best, even when Scorsese’s mighty power of invention falters or his efforts show, “Silence” is beyond good and bad."
