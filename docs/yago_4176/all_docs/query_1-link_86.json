        "text": "When Words Offer No Comfort\n\nHuman suffering extends beyond the truth we know in our minds. While in prison, Rodrigues faces an onslaught of psychological torment. Endo writes,\n\nA terrible anguish rose up in his breast. Violently he shook his head trying to control the ugly imaginings and the words rose up to his throat like nausea… Repeating the prayer again and again he tried wildly to distract his attention; but the prayer could not tranquilize his agonized heart. ‘Lord, why are you silent? Why are you always silent…?’ (140-141).\n\nIn this moment of mental distress, Rodrigues cries out to the Lord for peace, but receives no answer. Toward the end of his imprisonment, Rodrigues is confronted by an old mentor, Father Ferreira, who apostatized during extreme torture and began working for his persecutors to demoralize Japanese believers. Ferreira describes how he was forced to watch his congregation bleed: “I did pray. I kept on praying. But prayer did nothing to alleviate their suffering. Behind their ears a small incision has been made; the blood drips slowly through this incision and through the nose and mouth…Prayer does nothing to alleviate suffering” (255).\n\nFerreira is wrong, but not wholly. Sometimes Scripture and prayer can bring comfort in a way that truly nothing else can, but not always. Sometimes mere words, no matter how heartfelt, cannot mitigate pain. Often the only thing we can do is be present with those in sorrow. Mourn with those who mourn, weep with those who weep (Rom. 12:15). These words affirm the most comforting thing we humans can offer to an aching friend: company.\n\nThe Root of Suffering: Isolation\n\nThe nature of human suffering is that it divides, it isolates. It pushes us to seek solitude, away from our loved ones, our community, even our God. This solitude is not always physical. Sometimes it manifests in the way we desire to grieve alone, emotionally shutting others out because they cannot feel what we feel.\n\nThe most excruciating element of Rodrigues’s anguish lies not in the torture of his Japanese congregation, but rather in his feeling abandoned by God. Over and over he asks the Lord why He does nothing and says nothing in response to the evil persisting in Japan. At one moment of sorrow, he cries out:\n\nWhy have you abandoned us so completely?… Even when the people are cast out of their homes have you not given them courage? Have you just remained silent like the darkness that surrounds me? Why? At least tell me why (96).\n\nRodrigues continually laments the affliction of the Japanese Christians to God. But at various moments in Endo’s book, Rodrigues closes his eyes and feels “the face of Christ looking intently at him. The clear blue eyes were gentle with compassion; the features were tranquil; it was a face filled with trust” (106). However, only three times in the narrative does Rodrigues receive the impression of Christ’s voice in his thoughts, never audibly, and never when he aches most for God to speak.\n\nThe key to combatting despair in suffering is lamenting. David, Job, Habakkuk, Jeremiah, and Jesus—they all lamented their agony or the agony of others. They took their cries of grief and pain to the Lord, trusting He would hear them. The presence of the Book of Lamentations in the Bible means that grieving with the Lord and asking “why” is okay. Lamentations does not shy away from the rawness of tribulation. In chapter 3, the author begins by mourning that “his hope from the Lord” has perished. He grieves his circumstances and describes his affliction in brutal detail, but then his tone changes. He writes, “I called on your name…you heard my plea.” The passage concludes with the author relinquishing his anger toward his oppressors to God. If we cannot invite God into our grief, if we choose to cut ourselves off from Him—we will fall into despair. Offering up our anger, laments, and questions allows us to draw closer to the Lord by trusting Him with the honest state of our hearts.\n\nKnowing who God is, specifically His omnipresence and omnipotence, leads us to trust Him to hear our laments and never abandon us. The Psalmist proclaims, “You have kept count of my tossings; put my tears in your bottle. Are they not in your book?…This I know, that God is for me…in God I trust; I shall not be afraid. What can man do to me?” (Ps. 56:8-11). We serve a God who sees us, and a God who answers our laments, though rarely in ways we expect.\n\nAt the climax of Endo’s book, Rodrigues apostatizes to end the torment of four fellow believers. Like Ferreira, he then begins working for the government to quell the rise of Christianity in Japan. In the last few pages, Rodrigues confesses, “Lord, I resented your silence.” A voice responds: “I was not silent. I suffered beside you.”\n\nEndo concludes his novel with these words:\n\n…even if [Rodrigues] was betraying [his fellow priests], he was not betraying his Lord. He loved him now in a different way from before. Everything that had taken place until now had been necessary to bring him to this love. “Even now I am the last priest in this land. But Our Lord was not silent. Even if he had been silent, my life until this day would have spoken of him” (190-191).\n\nWhen we know the surpassing love of Jesus Christ, we can trust that everything we endure is not only preparing us for whatever lies ahead, but ever-deepening our love for Him. And above all, we can trust that God is never silent—He speaks precisely when we must hear His voice."
