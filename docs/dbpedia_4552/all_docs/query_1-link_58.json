        "text": "American video streaming service\n\nPeacock is an American over-the-top video streaming service owned and operated by Peacock TV, LLC, a subsidiary of NBCUniversal Media Group. Named after the NBC logo, the service launched on July 15, 2020.[3][4][5] The service primarily features series and film content from NBCUniversal studios and other third-party content providers, including television series, films, news, and sports programming. The service is available in a grandfathered free ad-supported version with limited content, while premium tiers include a larger content library and access to additional NBC Sports, Hallmark Channel, and WWE content.\n\nIn December 2022, the service reached 20 million paid subscribers.[6] In March 2023, Peacock reached 22 million paid subscribers.[7] As of October 2023, Peacock reached 30 million paid subscribers.[8]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 14, 2019, NBCUniversal announced plans to launch an over-the-top streaming service in 2020, which would feature original and library content, and be available in free advertising-supported and paid ad-free versions.[9] The service would be led by chairman Bonnie Hammer, under the division NBCUniversal Direct-to-Consumer and Digital Enterprises.[9]\n\nOn September 17, 2019, it was announced that the service would be named \"Peacock\", an allusion to the NBC logo. The service announced further details on its initial slate of original programming, including sci-fi series Brave New World (moved from USA Network's slate), limited series Angelyne, crime drama Dr. Death, comedy Rutherford Falls, teen drama One of Us Is Lying, talk show The Amber Ruffin Show, and reboots and continuations of Battlestar Galactica, Punky Brewster, and Saved by the Bell. It was also announced that library rights to the NBC sitcoms The Office and Parks and Recreation would move exclusively to Peacock in October 2020 and January 2021, respectively.[3][10]\n\nPeacock soft launched for Comcast Xfinity cable subscribers on April 15, 2020, beginning with X1 and Xfinity Flex customers. The service then launched nationally on July 15 of that year.[11][12]\n\nAs of August 2021, the service had reached at least 54 million signups.[13] In April 2022, the service reached 28 million monthly active accounts and 13 million paid subscribers, an increase of 40% from the previous quarter. It also reported a 25% increase in engagement year-over-year.[14][15] In September 2022, the service had 30 million monthly active accounts and 15 million paid subscribers, a 70% increase in paid subscribers since the start of 2022.[16] As of December 2022, the service has reached 20 million paid subscribers, with its coverage of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Spanish having been credited for an increase in the fourth quarter of 2022.[6]\n\nDistribution\n\n[edit]\n\nPeacock has three tiers of service: Free, Premium, and Premium Plus. The Premium tiers are subscription-based and include Peacock's full library of content, while the Free tier contains a subset of its content. The Free and Premium tiers are advertising-supported, with commercials limited to five minutes per hour. Peacock Premium is included in some services from television service providers, such as Cox, which ended January 15, 2023, and Xfinity. Subscribers to Peacock Premium, whether subscribing directly or receiving service through a provider, can upgrade to the ad-free Premium Plus tier for an additional monthly cost.[12] In January 2023, NBCUniversal discontinued the Free tier for new users: only subscription-based plans are available, with the Free plan only available to existing users, and those whose Premium subscription has lapsed.[17]\n\nOn May 6, 2020, a distribution deal with Apple made Peacock available on iOS devices and Apple TV on-launch. Peacock content is also available on the Apple TV app, and the Premium service is available as an in-app subscription.[18] On July 20, 2020, Peacock launched an app for PlayStation 4.[19] On September 21 of that year, Peacock became available on Roku.[20] The company's September 18 agreement for the service narrowly averted a blackout of NBCUniversal's TV Everywhere apps on Roku devices due to a dispute over revenue sharing and advertising inventory assignment.[21][22] On June 8, 2021, Peacock launched an app for Samsung smart TVs.[23][24] On June 24, 2021, Peacock launched an app for Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Fire tablets, such as Fire HD.[25]\n\nIn April 2023, as part of its multi-year partnership with Meta Platforms, a Peacock app was launched for Meta Quest 2 and Quest Pro Virtual reality headsets.[26]\n\nDirecTV customers can now watch Peacock TV through their DirecTV subscription. To do this, they must sign up for Peacock Premium or Peacock Premium Plus.[27][28]\n\nIn November 2023, Peacock partnered with Instacart to bring content to Instacart+ members.[29]\n\nContent\n\n[edit]\n\nThe service is drawn primarily from the NBCUniversal library, including subsidiaries such as Universal Pictures and Universal Television. It is said to include at least 15,000 hours of content on-launch without a subscription, and an additional 5,000 hours of content for Premium subscribers.[30][19][31] Current episodes of NBC series are available on Peacock the day after their premiere for Premium subscribers; non-subscribers will receive them on a week's delay.[19]\n\nPeacock also offers a lineup of about 25 curated digital linear channels, including long-form and digital-originated programming content from NBCUniversal's broadcast and cable properties (such as Today All Day, a digital extension of NBC's morning show Today),[32] as well as third-party content providers. They are designed to emulate a traditional broadcast programming experience (similar to services such as Pluto TV and Xumo, the latter of which was purchased by NBCUniversal parent Comcast in February 2020).[33]\n\nOn January 26, 2020, NBC announced plans to stream The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Late Night with Seth Meyers at 8 and 9 p.m. ET, respectively, ahead of their television premieres on NBC. Many of NBC's affiliate groups criticized the decision out of concern that the \"pre-airs\" of both late-night talk shows on Peacock would cannibalize viewership for the shows on local NBC stations, and the plans never came to fruition.[34]\n\nOn July 6, 2021, Universal announced that it would not renew its pay-one output deal with HBO in favor of bringing its films to Peacock during the pay-one window beginning in 2022. All films will exclusively be available on Peacock during the first and last four months of the 18-month pay-one window (with Universal licensing its live-action films to Amazon Prime Video and its animated films from Illumination and DreamWorks Animation to Netflix in between those two exclusivity windows). The pay-one window for Universal films was initially brought forward to four months after a film's initial theatrical release with this move, but it was later announced on December 9, 2021, that the pay-one window would be brought forward to as little as 45 days after a film's initial theatrical release (though Universal's deals with theater chains regarding the premium video on demand window for these films would be unaffected by this move).[35][36][37]\n\nIn January 2022, NBC's Spanish-language sister network Telemundo announced TPlus, a new \"content hub\" for Spanish-language programming on Peacock Premium that will launch later in the same year to coincide with the FIFA World Cup.[38]\n\nIn May 2022, Universal Pictures announced that it would shift three of its films to Peacock in 2023: Shooting Stars, a biographical feature about LeBron James based on his memoir; Praise This, about a youth choir music competition; and a remake of John Woo's 1989 crime drama The Killer.[39][40][41][42][43][44]\n\nIn August 2022, NBC announced that its long-running soap opera Days of Our Lives would move exclusively to Peacock Premium beginning September 12 of that year, after a 57-year run on the network. The miniseries spin-off Days of Our Lives: Beyond Salem had previously premiered as a Peacock original series.[45][46] It also announced that next-day streaming of Bravo programs would move to Peacock for the upcoming television season, as NBCUniversal had invoked its option to end an agreement with Hulu for next-day streaming rights for NBC and Bravo programming.[47][48]\n\nOn November 30, 2022, live streaming of local NBC stations was added for Premium Plus subscribers. This function was available at launch in 210 markets.[49]\n\nOriginal programming\n\n[edit]\n\nThird-party content\n\n[edit]\n\nLionsgate licenses library content to Peacock which Comcast negotiated during renewal of its carriage of Starz. In turn, NBCUniversal would license content to StarzPlay in the United States and internationally.[50][51] On January 16, 2020, Peacock acquired the streaming rights to the Warner Bros. Television series Two and a Half Men and George Lopez, the Paramount Network series Yellowstone, as well as The Matrix films.[52][53] In February 2020, A&E Networks licensed some titles from the A&E and History libraries to Peacock.[54] Peacock also had rights to the Harry Potter film series as part of an existing deal with NBCUniversal networks from October 2020 until August 2021, before WarnerMedia (now Warner Bros. Discovery) took them back on September 1 of that year. The films were then placed on HBO Max.[55][56]\n\nOn July 1, 2020, ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global) non-exclusively licensed some of its television series and films to Peacock, such as Everybody Hates Chris, Ray Donovan, and Undercover Boss. The service also held rights to several Paramount Pictures films under a limited exclusivity window from 2021 to 2023.[30]\n\nOn July 14, 2020, the service acquired the Canadian drama Departure for a U.S. premiere.[31]\n\nOn July 17, 2020, Cinedigm licensed over a dozen films and three streaming channels for Peacock's launch, with hundreds of other films and television episodes to follow.[57]\n\nIn January 2021, Peacock added Claudia Rosencrantz and Adrian Woolfe's streaming entertainment news channel LIT, with the platform serving as its U.S. launch partner for an exclusivity period.[58]\n\nOn May 18, 2021, NBCUniversal announced that it had acquired the U.S. streaming rights to the Eurovision Song Contest for Peacock under a two-year deal, beginning with the 2021 edition (whose first semifinal was held later that day).[59] The agreement came shortly after NBC reached an agreement with the European Broadcasting Union, which organizes the event, to produce an U.S. music competition series based on the Eurovision format.[60] For 2022, NBC's lead figure skating analyst, Johnny Weir, was added as a commentator for its Eurovision broadcasts.[61] The streaming rights for the contest were renewed for 2023.\n\nOn June 10, 2021, Peacock added content from anime streaming service RetroCrush.[62]\n\nOn October 31, 2022, NBCUniversal announced an SVOD agreement with Hallmark Media, under which Peacock Premium would add a hub featuring content from Hallmark Channel, Hallmark Movies & Mysteries and Hallmark Drama. The agreement includes both on-demand content from Hallmark's library of original series and made-for-TV movies, and the live, linear feeds of all three networks.[63][64] A similar agreement with Reelz (including true crime programming such as On Patrol: Live) was announced on February 28, 2023. However, due to conflicts with Peacock's exclusivity agreement with WWE, the linear Reelz channel would be blacked out on Peacock when it carries MLW Underground Wrestling.[65]\n\nOn April 13, 2023, Peacock added films from Magnolia Pictures.[66]\n\nWWE content\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: WWE Network\n\nOn January 25, 2021, NBCUniversal, which already televised WWE's professional wrestling weekly programs Raw and NXT on the USA Network, acquired the exclusive U.S. distribution rights to the WWE Network streaming service beginning March 18, 2021. WWE content is carried within a branded channel on Peacock, which includes a selection of WWE content on Peacock's free tier.[67] Premium subscribers have access to the full WWE library, including WWE Network original programming, archive content and all premium live events (pay-per-views) live and on-demand.[68][69] Some WWE content on Peacock has been edited to meet NBCUniversal standards and practices, particularly to remove content considered inappropriate under current standards.[70][71] The standalone WWE Network service for existing U.S. subscribers was shut down on April 4, 2021.[67]\n\nIn May 2021, Peacock announced that it had ordered WWE Evil, a documentary series created, produced, and narrated by John Cena that chronicles WWE's most prominent antagonists.[72]\n\nWWE committed to produce a \"signature documentary\" for the service annually beginning in 2022;[68][69] the first—Wooooo! Becoming Ric Flair—was released in December 2022.[73]\n\nSports programming\n\n[edit]\n\nPeacock carries NBC Sports and Telemundo Deportes programming, including live events either in simulcast with NBC or Telemundo, or exclusive to the service. Many of the standalone subscription services offered under the NBC Sports Gold banner were merged into Peacock Premium shortly after its launch, including Premier League Pass,[74] IndyCar Pass,[75] Figure Skating Pass,[76] Rugby Pass, Snow Pass,[77] motocross[78] and speed skating.[79]\n\nIn August 2020, Peacock launched NBC Sports on Peacock, a content hub featuring sports talk shows and radio simulcasts such as PFT Live with Mike Florio, The Dan Patrick Show and The Rich Eisen Show.[80] In September 2020, NBC Sports on Peacock added Brother From Another, a sports and pop culture-themed show co-hosted by former ESPN reporter Michael Smith and sports writer Michael Holley.[81] In the 2021 NFL season, the channel added an NFL studio show, Sunday Night Football Final, hosted by Kathryn Tappen and Chris Simms.[82] Fantasy Football Happy Hour and Fantasy Football Pregame with Matthew Berry premiered for the 2022 season.[83]\n\nIn August 2023, EverPass Media signed a multi-year deal to distribute selected Peacock-exclusive sports programming to commercial establishments in the U.S. under the branding Peacock Sports Pass.[84]\n\nNotable sporting events carried or simulcast by Peacock include:\n\nOlympic Games: During the 2020 Summer Olympics, Peacock carried coverage of selected events, as well as a \"Tokyo Now\" channel featuring exclusive studio programs.[85][86] At the 2022 Winter Olympics, all events were streamed live on Peacock Premium.[87] In April 2023, NBCUniversal announced its preliminary 2024 Summer Olympics broadcast plans.[88] In March 2024, it was revealed that Peacock would feature content online automated programmatic marketing for the first time at the Paris Olympics, in partnership with The Trade Desk.[89]\n\nNational Football League:\n\nAll Sunday Night Football and playoff games in simulcast with NBC beginning in the 2021 season.[90][91]\n\nPeacock will carry one exclusive game per-season beginning in 2023, and add a hub featuring NFL Films library content. Per NFL rules, these game is carried on broadcast television stations in the participating teams' primary markets.[90][91] Peacock also exclusively carried one Wild Card game during the 2023 playoffs, marking the first NFL playoff game to be exclusive to streaming outside of local markets.[92][93][94]\n\nSoccer:\n\nPremier League: 175 Premier League matches not on linear television per-season, all matches available on-demand.[74]\n\nFIFA World Cup: Simulcasts all matches in Spanish from Telemundo and Universo beginning in 2022 (English-language rights are held by Fox Sports).[95]\n\nUnited States Soccer Federation: Simulcasts all matches in Spanish from Telemundo and Universo beginning in 2023, such as United States men's and women's national team home matches and the U.S. Open Cup (English-language rights are held by TNT Sports).[96]\n\nCollege football:\n\nNotre Dame football: Simulcasts all NBC games beginning in 2021, and one exclusive game per-season.[97][98][99]\n\nBig Ten Conference: Simulcasts NBC's Big Ten Saturday Night games beginning in the 2023 season, and carries eight exclusive games per-season.[100][101]\n\nCollege basketball:\n\nBig Ten Conference: 47 men's basketball games and 30 women's basketball games beginning in the 2023–24 season, and the opening night doubleheaders of the men's and women's conference tournaments.[100][101]\n\nIndyCar Series: Coverage of practice sessions, qualifying sessions, and Indy NXT series events beginning in 2021.

At launch, these included The Majority Report with Sam Seder, The Mehdi Hasan Show, and Zerlina.[120][121][122] In July 2021, the channel was rebranded as \"The Choice by MSNBC\".[123] In 2022, The Choice was folded into a new MSNBC hub, featuring original content and on-demand streaming of selected MSNBC programs.[124]\n\nIn January 2021, Peacock premiered The Overview, a weekly series hosted by Gadi Schwartz that features conversations on news topics and \"paradigm shifts\" impacting the world.[125]\n\nIn January 2022, Peacock launched 24/7 streaming local news channels from the NBC Owned Television Stations division.
