It's slow because it's always slow. <Gachet> Who is in the UN Foyer? Three billions users surfing WP? :-) <Slizor> It's slow because of single mothers and asylum seekers <FennecFoxen> it's slow because we are insufficiently rich to keep it fast with as many users as use it. <Slizor> (FennecFoxen) : And we are insufficiently rich because of single mothers and asylum seekers! <OldakQuill> Yes, \"ASYLUM SEAKERS CAUSE HOUSE PRICES TO PLUMET AND WIKIPEDIA TO SLOW DOWN\" - Daily News <FennecFoxen> SEAKERS, seekers, or sneakers? * FennecFoxen wants asylum sneakers! <MykReeve> THE NEW SEEKERS CAUSE WIKIPEDIA TO SLOW DOWN <FennecFoxen> I want *squeaky* asylum sneakers! <VascoDaGama> Asylum speakers? <FennecFoxen> Asylum STREAKERS! <Slizor> Asylum streaky bacon, yum <yath> Buff Haitians zooming across the Atlantic % <enrc> The Universe N http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Universe Kevyn (New Redirect Page; points to Universe (Cool!
