        "text": "Becky Worley has been a tech reporter/producer since 1998. She is currently the technology contributor for ABC’s Good Morning America and a contributor for Yahoo! Tech\n\nHer goal is to bring information about technology to as many people as possible, she says “Technology is as much a lifestyle issue as fashion and health. It’s become a part of our everyday lives.” She blends consumer reporting and tech/gadget reviews unlike any other national network reporter and has been called “the Martha Stewart of technology.”\n\nBecky started her TV career fresh out of college, working in news for Seattle's KOMO-TV. In 1998, the creation of an all technology network called ZDTV was a dream come true: TV + Tech.\n\nDuring her 6 years at ZDTV /TechTV, Worley produced 3 different shows, hosted a live, hour-long computer help call-in show, and when TechTV created an 8 hour technology news format, Worley was tapped as an anchor.\n\nFrom there she started making guest appearances on Good Morning America as a tech expert and was eventually hired as the network’s technology contributor. She has appeared on World News with Diane Sawyer, Nightline, and 20/20 along with her regular reports for Good Morning America. Worley is a frequent Guest on the Dr. Oz Show.\n\nShe has hosted shows for the Travel Channel, the National Geographic channel and the Fine Living Network.\n\nShe is the author of \"Security Alert: Stories of Real People Protecting themselves from Viruses, Identity Theft, and Scams.\"\n\nWorley has a master's degree from Stanford University . She graduated through a program called \"Learning, Design, and Technology\" that focuses on technology and education.\n\nWorley was raised on the island of Maui, attended Middlebury College in Vermont, and currently resides in Oakland, CA with her partner and 7 year old twins."
