Hail, hail the gang's all here and there is absolutely no news. You know what that means? It's going to be a really great show. Why you should be cleaning your Apple Watch band. We talked a little bit, not very briefly about new versions of Mac oss. Are we getting close to a Gold Master in the passing of a legend in the business? It's all coming up.

We cover the latest news from Apple and as we inch our way [00:01:30] into September, there's less and less news, but that's okay. I have people who can make it up as we go, including Jason Snell from six colors.com just off his time\n\njason Snell (00:01:41):\n\nFrom Apple. I'm hearing breaking news. Yes. No, there's nothing. Sorry.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:01:46):\n\nNo invite. No invite yet.\n\njason Snell (00:01:48):\n\nNot yet. It wouldn't come if it's when we think if the events when we think it is. We won't get those until one. By we you mean me, I guess next week\n\nLeo Laporte (00:01:55):\n\nWe think it's September 12th, so yeah, you would get it probably on the 29th [00:02:00] or 30th. Yeah,\n\njason Snell (00:02:01):\n\nThey usually do two weeks notice if you're going to be there in person. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:02:05):\n\nHello? Jason also here with us from WG in Boston or as they just call it now G B H because no one needs the w Andy not coming.\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:02:14):\n\nYeah, well the traffic report here is well light traffic. We saw a guy on one of those three wheel motorcycles a half hour ago, but that was a long time. Hey, there's Mrs. Stellar. She has, oh, she's walking. She's walking her dog.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:02:30):\n\n[00:02:30] It's a small town\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:02:31):\n\nI think the dog was in.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:02:32):\n\nIt's a small town.\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:02:34):\n\nI mean the dog was lost. It was on the face grouper, but I'm glad she found the dog. I don't know what the specials are. The cafe across the street. A lot of smoothies I think are,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:02:46):\n\nThere's not a lot to say.\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:02:48):\n\nI have nothing else to contribute to this week's show unfortunately, but I try to do my part. Thank you. If I get any more news on the smoothie front,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:02:56):\n\nYou are on the second floor, so you actually do have that helicopter view [00:03:00] of a beautiful New England town in the late summer. Pretty much. Exactly,\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:03:06):\n\nAnd my writing desk is right next to a huge window and so it's like, if anything, it's amazing that I'm not on one of those neighborhood apps because I would be the person who's like, oh, at the optician's place, they're supposed to get their recycling out, but it looks like their bar's overflowing. They're the [00:03:30] guy only comes on Tuesday. What He's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:03:33):\n\nThink the aboard and Mr. From Office hours, doc Global, Mr. Alex Lindsay. Hello, Alex.\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:03:41):\n\nHello. Hello.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:03:41):\n\nYour color is good. Did you get some sun today?\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:03:45):\n\nThis week? This week, yeah. I was outside\n\nLeo Laporte (00:03:48):\n\nYou some mantan\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:03:49):\n\nOver the weekend. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:03:50):\n\nIt looks like you might've done some yard work\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:03:52):\n\nWorking on the pool. I don't do a lot of yard work, but I do spend a lot of time trying to keep my pool clean, so that's usually\n\nLeo Laporte (00:03:58):\n\nThe thing. That's why we do not [00:04:00] have a pool.\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:04:02):\n\nIt's so nice when it's clean.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:03):\n\nIt is, but then you have to clean it. The hot tub, at least I can drain it and that's a good way\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:04:09):\n\nStart. I've gotten good at the water\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:11):\n\nIs fine\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:04:12):\n\nThat I'm next to a whole bunch of pine trees and so it's just like this constant attack, so it's almost, I've got a lot of tools for it though. I've gotten very good at it, but\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:04:20):\n\nOh, that's crazy. So you come out of the pool like smelling like a freshly polished wood floor. That's great.\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:04:26):\n\nIt really does feel like that sometimes. So\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:29):\n\nAlright. [00:04:30] In the past at Tech TV when stories were light and shows were long, we would often resort to,\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:04:40):\n\nYou need to like wind.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:42):\n\nWe would often resort to bits of cleaning your mouse ball, things like that. We are now reduced to that here, but the modern mouse ball is your apple watchband, and according to nine to five Mac, apple watchbands are [00:05:00] covered in bacteria.\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:05:03):\n\nAll watchbands. To be clear, mine, every watchband, including the Apple\n\nLeo Laporte (00:05:07):\n\nWatch band, this is Hey folks, this is from the Advances in Infectious Diseases Journal, which really should be called the Adventures in Infectious Diseases, but that's all right. That's all right. Different 12 researchers from the prestigious Florida Atlantic University, which I think is above a gas station in beautiful\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:05:28):\n\nJackson, Florida Man reports,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:05:30):\n\n[00:05:30] The study consists of bands for the Apple Watch and other wearables made from rubber cloth, leather, plastic, gold, and silver. The goal was to find a between the material of the wristband and bacteria buildup, which is not even a logical sentence, but okay. Right off the bat, the study found 95% of all bands warned obviously not from the store, but had been warned by people contaminated with all kinds of dangerous bacteria. The most common staphylococcus S P P [00:06:00] found on 85% of the bands. However, that was not unexpected said researchers. What was found more notable was the 30% prevalence of the pseudomonas areosa, a type of a germ that c, d C says can cause pneumonia infections in the blood and more. 60% of the wearables tested contained e coli. Do not wear your watch to the restroom, I guess, or if you do wash it, so what did I do yesterday?\n\njason Snell (00:06:29):\n\nSo wash [00:06:30] it.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:06:30):\n\nI washed my band. I\n\njason Snell (00:06:31):\n\nDid do that\n\nLeo Laporte (00:06:33):\n\nAnd I took an old toothbrush\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:06:36):\n\nAnd\n\nLeo Laporte (00:06:36):\n\nI scrubbed the in interstices and I was tempted to dip it in alcohol. It is titanium. It should survive a solvent. Does it feel better\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:06:44):\n\nNow? Do you feel\n\nLeo Laporte (00:06:46):\n\nMore? Yeah, I'm so much more healthy.\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:06:48):\n\nYeah. As Jason reminded me before the show, I did read the paper and the paper didn't specify Apple watches. They have a photo of all the things they tested. A couple of 'em are obviously Apple [00:07:00] watches, but all they're basically saying is that if there's something that you wear every single day that you sweat into, maybe you should clean it every once in a while and just dunk that. Do you can take the band off, just dunk the band in 70% alcohol or Lysol, you're good, but I have to, if I were writing this headline, if I had to do this, wouldn't you just have to go for local TV station local news just before the break headlines [00:07:30] is your Apple watch killing you? Tune in. I was scientific research for,\n\njason Snell (00:07:36):\n\nI mean we really boil this down, right? Clean your watch band, you monsters, okay, just clean. If you've got the stretchy kind like the fabric, those start to get really dusky After a little while, you\n\nLeo Laporte (00:07:50):\n\nKind of know what I just weightless smells you clean, hang them up,\n\njason Snell (00:07:54):\n\nWipe the plasticy ones down. Just clean your watchband every so often. [00:08:00] Do you good monsters\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:08:02):\n\nAs someone who used to spend hours cleaning horse stalls and then just go in for lunch and then go back out and do it. All I\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:08:08):\n\nCan say is, yeah, I know.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:08:11):\n\nI don't think I've ever been sickened by my watchband, but there's always, apparently this is not news to Apple because support document 2 0 4 5 2 2, how to Clean Your Apple Watch has all the deets you need. This has been around for a couple of years. Is it okay to use a disinfectant [00:08:30] on my Apple watch using a 70% Isop Propyl alcohol wipe as Andy recommended 75% hel alcohol wipe or Clorox disinfecting wipes. Gently watch the exterior surfaces of your watch. Now, this works with the solo loop, the sport band, the Nike sport band, the OSHA band or the metal band do not use on fabric or leather bands. Do not use bleach or hydrogen peroxide. Avoid getting moisture in any openings.\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:08:56):\n\nNow, I will admit the reason, that's just good advice in general. The reason I don't have a fabric band [00:09:00] is because I was afraid that they would smell, but can't\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:02):\n\nYou throw them in the washing machine? You probably could, but\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:09:05):\n\nI was like, oh, that's, it's going to be a big mess\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:08):\n\nThere. Study didn't\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:09:09):\n\nMention one\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:10):\n\nAs the widely ignored issue of dirty digital crowns. Apple, however, has an important note on that. If the digital crown gets stuck or won't move, it's time to clean it. Check. Yeah,\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:09:27):\n\nThat's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:29):\n\nCheck for debris [00:09:30] and wipe down your Apple watch. If you find substances around the digital clown crown, they didn't mention which substances\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:09:37):\n\nClean it. I wonder if you swim in a pool with it if the chlorine\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:40):\n\nOh yeah, probably disinfects it. Yeah,\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:09:42):\n\nSee, don't,\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:09:44):\n\nThere's another story that confused the hell out of me because again, bad headline that's saying Apple issues warning about Don't sleep with your head, your apple near your iPhone.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:55):\n\nOh dear. That's scary.\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:09:56):\n\nYeah, and it was just, oh, by the way, when it's charging, [00:10:00] they pointed to some sort of tech note somewhere on the site that happens to mention that yes, it's going to get a little bit warm while it fast charges, so maybe don't hold it in your mouth while you're charging or something like that. It was nothing related to actually what the headline made you think. I'm like, okay, I feel as though I would've heard about this if there was a thing where for God's sakes, don't charge it on your nightstand because that's, that's when the goblins come in. They opens the portal to David [00:10:30] Bowie coming in and stealing children and\n\nLeo Laporte (00:10:31):\n\nAs the New York Post,\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:10:32):\n\nAlthough be cool to meet David Bowie\n\nLeo Laporte (00:10:34):\n\nPoints out, do not put your iPhone in a dryer at the laundromat because well, things could go wrong dramatically. Watch, boom, holy come. That was in Spain when God is on your side opening scene to an action movie. [00:11:00] Of all the things I was expecting to happen in the video that wasn't even in the top 20, it was caused by a clipper lighter. Do not leave lighters in your clothing\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:11:12):\n\nIn the dryer. Yeah, that would be\n\nLeo Laporte (00:11:15):\n\nA little butane. Yeah.\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:11:16):\n\nMy guess is that would, if you're unlucky enough, it would come open, it would fill, it would evaporate, take as and then it would be really powerful. That's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:11:28):\n\nThe worst kind, right?\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:11:30):\n\n[00:11:30] You could use that in a movie.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:11:32):\n\nYeah. It's the vapor that really just as a tip that's really explosive of any kind of, does that\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:11:37):\n\nVolatile, does Apple have a stated opinion on iPhone cases made of oily regs?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:11:44):\n\nThey make a wonderful Molotov cocktail.\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:11:48):\n\nYou get a pretty good high off of it. I'm just saying if it's bad for the phone, I was afraid this's going to hurt the oleophobic coating on the screen.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:11:55):\n\nOkay, so we've learned two things here. Do not sleep with your head next to your charging iPhone [00:12:00] and wash your gosh darn watch band if nothing else. I think that was worth watching today's show or listening, wasn't it after all.\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:12:10):\n\nSee you next week. See, good show everybody.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:12:13):\n\nReally.\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:12:13):\n\nWe did a lot of good today, honestly.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:12:15):\n\nThat's pretty much it. Wow.\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:12:19):\n\nYeah, it's funny. It's funny because this is the week where suddenly everybody has an explosive, not in the literal way, new iPhone [00:12:30] rumor and it's like, yeah, it's because you work for a phone store in Iowa and you got some press materials that you're not supposed to talk about and it's always nothing content, but it's everywhere and tricks you into thinking that hey, well, oh no, there isn't. Hey, well, oh no, there isn't.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:12:49):\n\nHow about this beta six of Sonoma macOS 14 for developers, they call it the release candidate.\n\njason Snell (00:13:00):\n\n[00:13:00] Really? I mean, I don't know. macOS has generally only been released in October, right, so\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:07):\n\nThey got some time.\n\njason Snell (00:13:08):\n\nIs this the release candidate? I don't know. It doesn't feel like it.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:12):\n\nHow about the seventh beta of iOS 17 and iPad OSS 17? That's got to be it, right? I've only gotten a couple of iOS. I did the public beta on my iPhone and I only have, I think twice have I had updates. They [00:13:30] don't update the public beta as much as the developer beta. Is that right? Or we don't know.\n\njason Snell (00:13:36):\n\nYeah, usually once it releases, they usually do. Yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:41):\n\nIt's pretty stable.\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:13:42):\n\nPretty stable, yeah. Yeah. I've had the screen become unresponsive a couple times and I had a problem where the messages you start typing and then you wouldn't see your response. You can just type into space for a little while and messages. I think those are the only two big things that I've [00:14:00] had so far. I've\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:00):\n\nHad blank widgets, which clean up after a while and there was one thing that would crash it every time, but I can't remember what it was now. I guess it didn't do it enough.\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:14:14):\n\nDo they have battery optimization on lock right now? Usually, that's one of the few things that's a bad thing about signing up for public beta. They have battery optimization, but they haven't fine tuned it yet, so you might lose like 45 minutes to an hour off your runtime.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:28):\n\nI haven't really noticed that, but\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:14:29):\n\nThat's [00:14:30] just a general thing.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:30):\n\nIt's got so much battery life. Yeah. One thing\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:14:34):\n\nThough, done a really good job with this.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:37):\n\nYeah. This tells you how good a job they did. The one thing people didn't like was that the end call button was moved to the right and now it's back in the middle. Yeah. Wow. That's why we do the beta testing, right?\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:14:54):\n\nYeah. That could have screwed up a lot of people though. That's like I wonder.\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:14:59):\n\nI'll tell you, [00:15:00] it reminded me of one other bug it called the last person I called over and over. Oh, that's a bug and over again. Fortunately it was a good friend of mine, but it just kept on calling time. We were in the hotel setting up for Seagrave and so he just kept on calling his phone over and over and over again. I mean every 30 seconds it would just call. Every time I'd hang it up, it would wait for a second then call again, but I haven't seen that since the last update.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:15:28):\n\nI wonder, I bet it's a little harder [00:15:30] these days for Apple to test phone features because I don't know about you, but I mean obviously you're a little different, Alex, you actually phone people, but I rarely call or talk\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:15:39):\n\nVery rarely on purpose\n\nLeo Laporte (00:15:42):\n\nOnly by accident. Yeah.\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:15:45):\n\nThere's only a handful of people that can call me unscheduled. Don't text first. There's this thing that I thought my kids were crazy when they did that. Text me before you call. I'll tell you if it's okay to talk, and now I'm totally that way. If we don't have a meeting, I kind [00:16:00] of expect you to text me before, is this a good time? And then I go, yeah, yeah, sure, but calling me straight out, you've got to be pretty close.\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:16:06):\n\nYeah, you need some time to spin up. Just boot up your own social software for handling out a phone call. It's difficult and also it's also kind of too bad that Apple\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:17):\n\nIs the introvert's complaint. I know\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:16:20):\n\nExactly. Like if someone asks you, if you're working with somebody on a project, they text you and they ask a question, it's perfectly fine to say, wow, [00:16:30] that's a good question. Let me take a look at that and get back to you as opposed to on the phone it's like, okay, why don't you hang up this call so I can go take a look at it? Oh no, that's okay. I'll stand by. Why don't you take a look at it right now? It's the worst and I'm like, well, I could come back to you in eight seconds. I could come back to you in eight hours. I don't think I want to keep the phone on quite that long, but it is too bad that Apple isn't looking at better phone features.\n\n(00:16:57):\n\nThere isn't a whole lot of different, there are only [00:17:00] a few signature features that Apple has that a Google Pixel phone and vice versa, but one of them is when I switch to test out another phone when I lose all of that call screening that is built into a pixel phone, I miss it. It is so good at saying, yeah, this is nobody I, I'm going to let you know that someone's calling, but I'm going to tell you you don't want to answer the phone or Hey, why not? Instead of answering the phone, you just tap this button and listen to the voicemail message that he or she's trying to leave and if it's a language that you don't understand, [00:17:30] it's like it is, but actually that kind of fits into what we've been talking about because all of these features that I love about pixel's phone app are basically ones that prevent me from talking to people on the phone, so maybe we're still making the same case.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:17:46):\n\nApple Insider took their life in their hands and so did some unnamed developer who gave them hands-on on their vision despite of course all of the restrictions. They'd agreed to [00:18:00] the developer. I mean, insider didn't have any qualms and they shouldn't because that's a journalistic thing, but I kind of feel like the developer really, you promised man, you promised.\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:18:12):\n\nOh God, that is exactly it. I think that especially in a device like this, if there were a device that is causing harm to people and Apple is trying to put the lid on this news story getting out everyone, the sky's the limit, but when it's a pre-release piece of hardware, it's perfectly [00:18:30] fine for Apple Insider to if someone reaches out and say, Hey, you want to spend two hours with this piece of hardware unsupervised and without Apple looking over your shoulder and telling you what to do, they almost have responsibility to do it, but as someone who's, I've signed a bunch of agreements to say that this is not my property, this is Apple's property. I'm agreeing that Apple gets to dictate everything I do with this and 20 of the 20 and a half pages of the instructions are, I don't get to show it to anybody else. Certainly not a reporter. That's [00:19:00] like, again, on these kinds of stakes where it's not as though this is a whistleblower who's trying to get attention to a problem that Apple's trying to stifle. That's no good. You don't do that. I\n\nLeo Laporte (00:19:12):\n\nWill also point out that I don't think we learned anything. I don't know. No, we didn't. Yeah, it's everything we've already,\n\njason Snell (00:19:18):\n\nIt's kind of a nothing. I mean the biggest story is that somebody got a hold of one, but his impressions are not really appreciably different than the impressions we all got from our canned demos at Apple during ww [00:19:30] d c week. It's just a different person writing about the same kind of things and without the demo you don't get the Apple demo Here. It's just sort of the hardware and saying, yeah, it looks good, and the iPad apps are just iPad apps and we looked at Safari and it was fine and it's fine as long as, I mean again, it is Apple Insider's job. As long as they didn't induce somebody, right? We're like, Hey, anybody out there want to break their N D A? That starts to get unethical, but assuming somebody that this writer knows came and said, I got this. You can look at it. [00:20:00] That's on the developer who got it, but this didn't change how we look at the Vision Pro. It's just sort of like, oh yeah, it's what we thought it was and it's a developer unit\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:20:11):\n\nAnyway for all of that. The developer undermined the entire developer program. It's not yet and try to get support from Apple now.\n\njason Snell (00:20:20):\n\nWell, what I would say is Apple, when Apple does something like this, they know this is going to happen. They know this is going to happen, and in fact their best defense for stuff like this is don't include things in [00:20:30] the developer unit that you don't want to leak, that they'll leak. They'll leak. Maybe they won't leak in a first person like this. I think what's extraordinary is that the writer of the story is like, I used it and let me go through my experience. There are other ways to couch this stuff and be like, oh, there's a report that, or we are hearing that, or a developer told us that this thing is the case, but they're going to come out. Right. It's inevitable that they're going to come out. I think you go into it. If your Apple just knowing constrain what's [00:21:00] you want to tell them, don't share it, but some of that stuff is going to leak and it's just like anything that's precious, don't put it in the developer product, just don't do it and they didn't.\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:21:09):\n\nAnything that doesn't work yet is not going to be in that unit for exactly this reason, so no one can say, oh my God, I turned on that eyeballs on the outside of the goggles. Oh my God, that's terrible. It was a nightmare. Yeah, that's because we only turned it on for one person. Congratulations, you just got caught in the flight trap.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:21:29):\n\nAlso, [00:21:30] I think this is another vision pro leak of French tech news website. iPhone Soft says that a source who tried the Vision Pro at one of Apple's public developer lab saw the one terabyte figure listed as storage in the devices settings app. We're really grasping at straws here, folks. Well, but\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:21:50):\n\nWe know that there's larger storage available. It's just that it's not necessarily going to be on board. I think that that's the whole thing is\n\njason Snell (00:21:59):\n\nThat's why it [00:22:00] starts at, right? The price was starts at and we all focused on that price,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:22:03):\n\n3,500. It starts at Yeah, you want a terabyte that's going to cost you a little more, I think.\n\njason Snell (00:22:08):\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:22:09):\n\nAlthough it is interesting to wonder about the architecture of this, and this is why this kind of a number isn't really valuable right now because one of the things that's on a lot of people's mind is how often is this device going to have to phone home to get more data to render an environment or do whatever like that? The idea, if we found out that, oh, but the Apple thought that the base model was going to be 512 gigabytes and they decided [00:22:30] to make it one terabyte instead, that might be an interesting data point about the latency that they were the Apple was experiencing when it had less memory rather than more, but as it is right now, we have nothing to compare it to, so we don't know if that's a lot, if that's going to be how much you get for the base model law or how much it's going to be if you spend an extra thousand dollars, so interesting. This is way too early to get anything interesting out of it.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:22:55):\n\nDid James Thompson get a Vision Pro? Do you know Jason?\n\njason Snell (00:22:59):\n\nI mean, would [00:23:00] he be able to say if he did, but I don't actually know. He might be able say, I think he went to the developer labs in London. He had a mysterious tweet that was very obvious about going to batter sea, so I think he was in that lab, but I don't know, and if he did, he didn't tell me. Put it\n\nLeo Laporte (00:23:14):\n\nWay, so the developers who get knowledge, these are not even allowed to say, you can't come into my house now. You could say that or, well,\n\njason Snell (00:23:23):\n\nYeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:23:23):\n\nRight. I have a special room now in my house that you're not allowed\n\njason Snell (00:23:26):\n\nTo. It's locked with a Pelican case in it and you're not allowed in there. Yeah, probably they [00:23:30] could say that James works at home, so you'd have to be one of visiting James in Scotland to get that non together.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:23:36):\n\nWhatever you do, do not go in that room, that door. Do not go through that door. Whatever you do, you can do else in the house. That's a guarantee that door's going to get opened. I've written enough\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:23:50):\n\nPrompt injection works really well with humans, I find. Yes.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:23:54):\n\nWell, and I think for\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:23:55):\n\nMost of many of these, it's these are going to be larger companies that have a room [00:24:00] that they're going to dedicate to this. Oh, yeah, put something in there. That's what\n\nLeo Laporte (00:24:03):\n\nApple special key card access and all that, and we know who saw it and who was in there and who gave it to Apple Insider, that kind of thing. Wow. Boy, this is so scant when I start with watch your watch band, it's going to be,\n\njason Snell (00:24:19):\n\nI mean, we could probably kill an hour just talking more about Disney and Apple if we want to do that.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:24:25):\n\nLet's do Wes. Let's break first. I did that. I like that. I like your thinking [00:24:30] stranger. I like where you're going. By the way, I hate that story. Is it just me or that? That is an example of August fatigue. There's nothing to say. The speculation even Gruber has fallen for this that Apple might buy. Well, I think he was in E S P N, right? Wasn't that the thinking?\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:24:53):\n\nThat's because the Disney c e o has been fielding questions about selling off units and [00:25:00] he's been protesting that no, Disney is not for sale. However, we are considering selling off units of basically channels that are not streaming content. Things are to have live events like a conventional TV channel, and he specified e s ESPN as something that they're considering, and when you see articles, they're saying, oh, don't do Apple buying Disney. That's not as ridiculous as it might seem. It's like, well, until you wonder how Apple is going to run a theme park, and I don't know if they're going to do that, but yeah, when you consider, if they do decide to break [00:25:30] things up and people just like in a estate sale where people just send upon saying, I'm here to buy the furniture. I'm here to buy linens. I'm here to buy kitchen stuff. That could then Apple could show up at that estate sale and say, I'm going to buy S P N,\n\njason Snell (00:25:42):\n\nI have a hot take on this, but maybe I should save\n\nLeo Laporte (00:25:44):\n\nIt for, let's take a break and then the hot take. Ladies and gentlemen, this is why you listen to this show, Jason Snell's Hot takes\n\njason Snell (00:25:52):\n\nGot to be a reason.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:25:54):\n\nThere's going to be some reason. Andy and aco, Jason Snell, Alex Lindsay, [00:26:00] we will delve into Disney and Apple in just a little bit. There's also somebody put this in and I think it's kind of cool history of presentations, that kind of cool video. We could talk about that too, but first a word from our sponsor, a company, a piece of software I use not just every day, but several times a day. It's great software attaching to a great server and [00:26:30] it solves the problem that I think a lot of people have. My almost motto over the last few years is if you value email, don't use a free service. The free emails, almost everybody's using Gmail, maybe outlook.com, that kind of thing. They don't provide any support because it's free. You're at their mercy and if something goes wrong, you got a problem and the features really are not, you're not defining the features that the user base isn't.\n\n(00:27:00):\n\n[00:27:00] Advertisers are. That's why I use FastMail. I love FastMail, been using FastMail for more than 10 years. For a while I was using Gmail because of the spam fighting feature. Then I just filtered my mail through Gmail and back into FastMail, which is very easy to do, but FastMail is so good. I finally said, I don't even need Gmail at all your email, and it's worth it. Look, it's as little as $3 a month. It's not a huge expense, but if you have a business, your email [00:27:30] address says so much about you, even as an individual, and I talk to people all the time who still have@aol.com or hotmail.com, you need FastMail. FastMail is real email. They use an open source IMAP server called Cyrus. They contribute back to it, by the way, all the time, and that means you're getting true imap, but FastMail has added some features that I think are fantastic.\n\n(00:27:53):\n\nFor instance, if you like the way you can label emails in Gmail, you'll love FastMail because [00:28:00] you can use folders or labels. They have a very powerful search bar and oh yes, the spam filtering is second to none. In fact, I even have written scripts because they use the open source against SIV program, and siv scripts mean that you could have absolutely fine control of your email spam fighting, not just spam fighting, but filtering, so you can organize your email. The FastMail apps, iOS, Android are fantastic. The web app is fantastic, but [00:28:30] you can use any email app. It works with them all. I've actually prefer the FastMail app, especially on iOS. It has quick settings from the quick settings menu. You could choose a theme switch between light and dark mode, change your text size. You don't even leave the email screen. It's just boom, quick settings.\n\n(00:28:47):\n\nAlso offer options related to the FastMail screen you're viewing. You can use FastMail to generate masked email addresses. This is fantastic, an extra security step so that instead of using your real email, when you sign up for something, [00:29:00] you use a masked email that doesn't reveal who you are. This works by the way, with our sponsor, bit warden with One Password and others. I love this because basically, not only do you have a unique password, you have a unique email for everybody. You can auto save contact, so when you reply to somebody, it automatically adds them to your contacts. I use that in my sieve because if somebody's in my contact list, I move them to a special folder, an important [00:29:30] folder. I know, Hey, somebody, this is a real person. This is somebody I've been talking to. You can have public images of senders from external services, including I love that.\n\n(00:29:41):\n\nI like to see what you look like. You could set default reminders for events, change how invitations are handled, turn on notifications for calendar alerts. Oh, did I mention? Yes, calendar and contact support is fantastic in FastMail. In fact, I replaced my Google calendar and Google contacts with FastMail and it syncs [00:30:00] with all my devices, all my Apple iOS devices at Linux two, it's great. FastMail sells domains. You can now buy a domain or add a domain through FastMail. I have almost all my domains that I want email to, whether they're a website or not. In FastMail, they're the D N SS server because FastMail sets it up so that it has full authentication and all the special complicated email authentication [00:30:30] protocols. FastMail just does it. It's easy, which means more people get my email. I hear complaints more and more from people who say, my email's not going through.\n\n(00:30:39):\n\nThat's because there's so much spam on the internet that most providers now are requiring authentication, that you really are that person on that server for over 20 years. Now, fast Mail has been a leader in email privacy. They your customers to them, you're not the product, you're the customer. No advertising, [00:31:00] no advertisers. You pay for free email with your privacy fast mail, your data stays yours better productivity features, as I said, as little as $3 a month, better productivity. I mean, I can go on and on. I just love FastMail. I've been using it nonstop. I wouldn't dream of any other email service, and I highly suggest you take a look at FastMail. It's very easy to take your data from the old email provider and move it over or even set up a forward [00:31:30] so that people still use your old address. It goes into FastMail.\n\n(00:31:34):\n\nI use Fast, for instance, because I have domains associated with FastMail. I have an infinite number of emails, so every time I sign up for something, I make it be that company at my email, which makes it really easy to figure out who's selling my name. Among other things. I really like it. FastMail is moving email forward with new internet standards and open source innovations that power many email services other [00:32:00] than their own. There are leaders in the open source email movement. They are the gold standard. Reclaim your privacy, boost productivity with FastMail. Try it now free for 30 days, fastmail.com/twit. I have just scratched the surface of the things FastMail can do. It is fantastic. FastMail, remember that name. When it's time to make email yours, go to fastmail.com/twit. We think of so much where there's some support of Mac Break [00:32:30] Weekly, and I thank them personally. I've been using them, as I said, for more than 10 years, and I've been trying to get them to buy ads. I said, you're getting the recommendations for free. I know. Please cut me a little check, would you? And they have, even though they're not rich, they're not Google Rich. So it all started with an August 9th article in the Hollywood Reporter, a Disney sale to Apple. Don't count it out this time. Now, Alex, [00:33:00] Lindsay, you've been saying Apple should buy Disney forever and ever. Does Apple have enough cash to buy Disney? I mean outright?\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:33:10):\n\nI don't, no, they'd have to borrow it, but they could do that or they could do stock transfer. I mean, there's a lot. I mean think that Pixar was bought by Disney with stock, I don't think in some cash, but I think it was a split of those things. I think that's how Steve Jobs ended up with 7% of Disney or\n\nLeo Laporte (00:33:26):\n\nDisney's market cap is 156 billion. [00:33:30] Apple only\n\njason Snell (00:33:31):\n\nHas\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:33:31):\n\nOne\n\njason Snell (00:33:31):\n\n20th, only 50 billion in cash, but they could probably, they're good for\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:33:35):\n\nIf they held their breath, if they held their dividend breath for three quarters, they'd have enough to buy Disney.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:33:40):\n\nBut I don't like anybody's proposing that they buy Disney outright or even that Disney is for sale outright. It's just that Bob Iger might want to sell parts off that don't make sense.\n\njason Snell (00:33:50):\n\nOr potentially, depending on how Bob Iger sees the end game, he wants to sell parts off. The theory of the Hollywood reporter article is Iger may want to sell some parts off into places that [00:34:00] are declining businesses, and that might be prepping it for sale to a partner like Apple for what remains, and that would be his exit. Famously can't find a successor, so maybe his successor is handing the company to Apple and running away. But the t h R story, I thought it was a really balanced story because it says right in the headline, we've heard this before, why is it different this time? And there are a few reasons it's different this time. Disney is under stress. Their biggest cash [00:34:30] machine for the last 15, 20 years. E S P N is in decline because cable subscriptions are in decline, and they invested a huge amount of money in launching Disney Plus, which I would say was successful.\n\n(00:34:40):\n\nBut they have a bunch of pressure saying, you got to show profit, you got to make more money on this. Even though that was never the original goal, the goal was to stake out the territory and build a product. That would be one of the last ones standing. But the big thesis in that t h R story is the Hollywood Insider who basically says, look, all these entertainment industry companies are now [00:35:00] going to be streaming companies and streaming as technology, and the tech industry has so much more money and power than the entertainment industry that in the end, the tech industry is going to eat the entertainment industry alive. What's going to happen? And that they said something like, in the end, all you're going to get is Apple, Amazon, Netflix and one other streamer will be the only ones to survive because Apple, Amazon, Google, these companies have so much more money and so much more market cap than the entertainment [00:35:30] industry, which we think of as giants like Disney looms large in our minds.\n\n(00:35:34):\n\nBut if you look at the balance sheet and you look at the stock and you compare it to the tech giants like Apple, it's not even close. So I think that the most interesting part of the premise is if it's inevitable because of the world we live in right now, that tech companies are going to swallow the entertainment industry whole, there's not a better companion for Disney than Apple because they are two of the most similar companies [00:36:00] culturally in existence. And a lot of what Disney has is stuff that Apple wants. But I think what I see in a lot of the criticism of this when people are like, no, no, it's never going to happen, and I was one of those people 10 years ago, it was like, this is not going to happen. But it's different now. And I think one of the reasons is Apple's a much larger company than they were 10 years ago.\n\n(00:36:19):\n\nThey're huge. And also in relationship to Disney, in relationship to Disney and then in relationship to itself as well. And they still have enormous pressure by investors to show [00:36:30] growth. And we can debate whether that's healthy for companies to have endless growth pressure. I think it's not, but that's the way the world works. And so that's where we are. And one of the things that Apple has done is gone into completely new markets that would've seemed ridiculous even 10 years ago, like Apple TV plus. And the fact that an Apple TV movie won an Oscar and they won the Emmy for best comedy with Ted lasso Apple's playing in all sorts of games that they never did before, and they're a size [00:37:00] unlike the company even 10 years ago. And when you start to think about that and think about avenues for growth, I don't think it's unreasonable to say Apple might want to buy a big chunk of Disney and use it to fuel future growth if they believe they can do it.\n\n(00:37:14):\n\nI still don't think it's super likely unless there's a feeding frenzy. And Apple was like, well, nobody else is going to buy Disney. We're going to buy it. But Andy mentioned theme parks earlier and it's like, I don't know, I think theme parks kind of potentially [00:37:30] fit. I don't think it would be an Apple theme park, it would be a Disney theme park, but Apple might own Disney at that point. Apple and Disney are both really good at focusing on the customer experience. The imagineers are right at that same intersection of liberal arts and technology that Apple is. They're very good at focusing on the customer experience and also getting as much money out of the customer as possible in all of those situations. I know it seems super bizarre, the idea that Apple as a corporation might end up owning Disneyland [00:38:00] and Disney cruise lines and things that are like, how is that even possible?\n\n(00:38:04):\n\nBut what I would say is the Apple lift today is not the apple that lives in most of our minds. It's already changed so much. It's so huge, and the pressure on it to continue to grow is so great that they are opening up whole new areas. And I think 10 years ago we would've said an Apple movie, what's that? And let alone that it won best picture, but that's where the world we live in today. So I think that it's plausible, but I personally think [00:38:30] I actually understand why Bob Ger might want to sell to Apple. I don't think I can see the case for Apple to spend 150 billion on some of the assets of Disney right now unless it's a situation where everybody in tech is buying the entertainment industry out at which point, Disney and Apple are the best partners.\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:38:51):\n\nAnd I think some of the timing, it'll depend on some of the strikes as well, because the movie industry, if the strikes continue that are happening in Hollywood right now [00:39:00] until January or February, which some people think could happen, the movie industry will be in a free fall. It's like c o level. People are talking a lot about it right now. It's that, but Apple and Amazon and Netflix actually are in a better position, which they're the ones that are holding the strings to the strike. That's the real problem with the whole thing. And so they're in a really good position. So the timing is really defensive because Disney may be as valuable as is ever going to be [00:39:30] like right now. So that's probably something that Iger may be looking down. The problem is that there's a lot of really valuable assets and for Apple across the entire ecosystem, Ironman and Marvel and Pixar and Star Wars and all those things across the entire ecosystem with ar, vr interfaces, games, educational materials, stickers, everything, those are very valuable.\n\n(00:39:57):\n\nThey have probably run most of their value. [00:40:00] Disney by overusing them has probably run most of their value out of that system. So the problem is is that can Disney actually continue to make the kind of money it's been making in the past and it's starting to falter because where do you take Marvel now? Where do you take Star Wars now? Where do you take those things now they're not clear that there's an end product there that, not that it won't be valuable. The question is will it be has as guaranteed as it was before? And that's becoming unclear. So I think that everyone's starting to not quite [00:40:30] hit on all cylinders. And so I think that if you're looking at that, you have to be kind of worried. Also, if you're doing location-based ar, you're doing all kinds of other stuff, there's no better place to do that than a Disneyland.\n\n(00:40:42):\n\nSo if you wanted to add value to something and have it be like, Hey, if you're using an iPhone, all this other stuff is available at Disneyland. That is a pretty, it's a great r and d space because of the way that Disneyland is built in Disney World. But Disneyland, I mean the way it's built, you can see [00:41:00] people using it all. There's a lot of things about it because it's a known product and it's something that Apple could really take advantage of. So I think that in a lot of ways Disney is more valuable to Apple than it is to Disney. And so because they can use it as a magnifier in a way that Disney can't do by itself,\n\njason Snell (00:41:19):\n\nThat's the argument for tech companies to buy these companies is that the tech companies have an engine of money and for the Apple, it's the iPhone that the standalone entertainment companies just don't have. And [00:41:30] so you look at what Disney can do and they are now constrained by everybody saying, how are you going to make money? Instead of, we're going to spend billions in order to establish Disney Plus, it's now how are you going to make money? How are you going to deal with linear TV like E S P N going down? And Apple is like, well, we got all that money from the iPhone.\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:41:47):\n\nDon't ask us and we can sell. Apple could just sell more iPhones and make it worth buying Disney. If all of those Disney products and everything else suddenly were mostly just you got all the special stuff on the Apple [00:42:00] platform that were related to those things, it's worth it by itself. I think the biggest problem Apple would have is actually antitrust. It is will cinch up so many things for Apple that because it's two different markets, I think that they might be able to do it, but they're under so much pressure right now. I think people could see an end run here of Apple really closing, especially that sub 18, that they're already at 87%. They could bump that a bit higher with all of those product lines. So that's the thing that I think Apple [00:42:30] has. I think it's a very valuable purchase. I think it's probably 50 50, maybe 30 50 that they would actually do it. Apple's never done more than I think Beats. I think Beats is the biggest one. They did three and a half billion. It's a huge cultural. Disney as Jason said, is probably the closest to Apple and culture in many, many, many ways. And so it'd probably be the easiest one. You have a C E O that is ready to leave. So it's not like he's going to be trying to figure out how he remains in play already\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:42:58):\n\nLeft once,\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:42:59):\n\nSo he's already left [00:43:00] once. So you already have, so there's a bunch of things about it that make sense. Obviously it's just such a, everybody, I think just about every time someone's done this, it hasn't turned out well. So I think that that's the biggest problem is that Apple would've to prove that they can do it better than everyone else, which they do often. But Apple has generally resisted large purchases because of trying to assimilate the culture has been difficult.\n\nAndy Ihnatko (00:43:23):\n\nYeah. I'm glad you brought up Beats because that's one of my stumbling blocks in all this. I think one of the reasons why the Beats [00:43:30] acquisition worked and got Apple into streaming music services is that they didn't just buy a headphone manufacturer and a fledgling startup music service. They've also bought Dr. Dre and they bought Jimmy Iovine who came in saying, we have the knowledge of this industry that is major place. I should point out, ran away as quickly as they could from the company. They took the cash, they had [00:44:00] an office, but again, but they didn't show up. Well, they both contributed to the launch. They weren't, it's not as the launch.\n\n(00:44:09):\n\nThey were around long enough to make sure that Apple knew how to run that business. One of my problems I have imagining Apple's, a wide acquisition of Disney is who at Disney can basically bring aboard, here is how things work at Disney. Here is why. No, you are not going to treat Disney cast members on the theme parks that [00:44:30] way. Just college kids who come in and work for three weeks and you can fire them at will. These are people that are there because they love Disney, and we both benefit from that and we also know how to exploit that correctly. So you're not going to basically say that just because your ability to shut down certain workers in your Apple stores worked there, that's how you're going to help the, that's how you're going to keep control of the people that are the last interface between a five-year-old child and their parents having a great time at our theme parks.\n\njason Snell (00:44:59):\n\nI would think [00:45:00] that if Apple would make a purchase like this, they would know that one of the things they were doing is entering areas they don't know about and lean on the executives who run those parts of Disney to be the experts and join whatever the team is to do that. And my example would be everybody likes to talk about the early days of Apple TV and they say, oh, you mean Carpool karaoke and Planet of the apps? It's like, well, that was the, no, I don't mean that because that was the objective lesson of them as people who don't know [00:45:30] anything about TV or the entertainment industry throwing something against the wall. What they did do, that was the smart thing after those two shows were in process was hire the two guys from Sony who run Apple TV to this day. And those guys are entertainment industry experts.\n\n(00:45:47):\n\nThey're the subject matter experts. They work for Eddie Q, but it's very clear that Eddie Q, although he's thinking about strategy and who knows, may be thinking about buying Disney right now, he lets those guys [00:46:00] run that division and they're the experts. And so they've listened to the subject matter experts. And it's one of those examples where although there are all those stories about, oh, Tim Cook doesn't want you to swear on TV or whatever, the truth is that Zach and Jamie, the guys who run Apple tv, the Sony executives formerly they're doing their thing and they know how to do it and they've been successful with it. So I think that could potentially be the model. The other thing I would throw out there is I think it's an interesting [00:46:30] thought exercise, and I don't know where I come down on this, but okay, 150 billion.\n\n(00:46:37):\n\nIf they said to Zach and Jamie, here's a hundred billion dollars and in a year or two we want Apple TV plus to be Disney plus, they couldn't do it. They couldn't do it in four years, they couldn't do it in eight years. That would be the reason you buy something, whether it's Disney or Paramount or something else, is you want to really grow your streaming service [00:47:00] and growing it with no catalog and no intellectual property, bit by bit, year by year, show by show isn't growing it fast enough for your purposes and that's why you would make a big sale. So that would be my argument, but I doubt they would make the mistake given how they behave with TV Plus, if they did suddenly come in and say, we want to micromanage how the poorest paid people at the parks division are managed, yeah, that's going to be a disaster. But I'm not sure that that would happen.\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:47:28):\n\nAnd even with [00:47:30] Beats and with other things that Apple's taken over in the past, it usually was a pretty light step at the beginning. It's like where we're going to figure this out for a little while and then we're going to start doing stuff. And again, I think they probably leave. I think Apple's interest in Disneyland for instance, is going to be more about how do we add ar extra phone tools? They probably wouldn't touch how the Disneyland works because Apple's pretty good at knowing that you don't always know exactly what makes something successful and not successful. So I think that, and they've been pretty good at that kind of thing of not messing with things [00:48:00] unless they can figure it out. So I don't have any real concern that Apple would do anything odd with that. I think that it's mostly just could they figure out how to assimilate the overall Disney culture into the Apple culture and just all the people and everything's just with any of these, there's just a lot of politics and a lot of people who have, when you merge it, who gets to run this division versus that division and is it an Apple person?\n\n(00:48:25):\n\nIs it Disney person? And it's two massive ships [00:48:30] getting merged together. And so I think it's just the overall culture and I would say more executive culture than the Edge that they'd have to figure out who goes where to make that happen. But I do think that, again, the advantage for Apple, as Jason said, the advantage for Apple to fill up, suddenly you have an entirely full subscription service\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:53):\n\nThat\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:48:53):\n\nHas got all the bits and pieces that it needs and E S P N. And so I think that that's [00:49:00] so valuable to Apple. And I think that Apple and Amazon, they don't have to make money selling movies. This is all like Glow. Someone was talking about Prime, someone asked, when are you going to get rid of Prime? There was something that I saw and someone asked me, I was like, never. I'm never going to get rid of Prime. Do you see how many books packages come into my house? There's no way I'm going to get rid of Prime. And that's the point. Amazon is giving me video with my delivery and Apple has got [00:49:30] products and this whole side angle of it makes it. That's why all these technology companies are going to do so well. And again, I do think a reckoning is coming because even for me, I'm looking at how many times am I actually going to these subscription services? And the reality is I'm not going to Disney very often. I'm not going to Max very often. I'm spending most of my time in Amazon, apple, Netflix, and I'm not sure if it makes sense to keep all of these subscriptions.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:53):\n\nI think that you guys are forgetting the mess that Uncle Mo made at cruises. I think Godrick is just not the greatest [00:50:00] mascot for parks and a t N is just, wait a minute, I'm confusing this with succession. I'm sorry. That's a different show. Some of this comes from, and by the way, this is again the article from the Hollywood Reporter by Kim Weber and Alex Weran. It comes from ER's book The Rite of a Lifetime in 2019. He wrote, I believe that if Steve were still alive, we would've combined our companies, or at least discussed the possibility very seriously. I believe that Bob Iger really wants this. I [00:50:30] do not believe that Apple does. Look at the size, these dots on the article are fantastic. The size comparison of Big Tech, and you could add Google and Microsoft and the others to the size comparisons of these media companies, Netflix, Comcast, Disney, Warner Brothers, Fox Paramount are tiny compared to this.\n\n(00:50:50):\n\nI think Apple could reasonably say we would like the streaming library of Disney Plus maybe we'd like because we want to get into sports E S P N. But Tim Cook has always [00:51:00] said historically that the biggest, the reason he doesn't do big acquisitions is the culture clash. He says it's very hard to combine cultures, and as much as Disney is a similar culture, there are two different unions for Park employees. For instance, apple doesn't like unions. There's also, and you Glancingly mentioned this, the F T C would absolutely sue to stop this. I mean, there's not even a question about it. Whether they would win is another matter, but Microsoft's [00:51:30] gone through hell with their Activision acquisition and yeah, it'll probably end up going through in the long run, but it was not fun. And I don't think Apple has a real taste for going back to court after their epic\n\njason Snell (00:51:43):\n\nList. I dunno. I mean, I just look at the Disney acquisition of Fox where they divested of some stuff, and that was a huge overlap. I think that this would even not have the overlap that Microsoft and Activision has. So maybe I'm, I'm sure politically there would be [00:52:00] fallout from this, but I honestly can't see how they would stop it because there's so little overlap between the two companies.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:52:10):\n\nThere's another speed bump that the Hollywood reporter brings up, which is the shareholders. The uproar from Disney shareholders would be insane.\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:52:25):\n\nOnly the uneducated ones. I mean, Disney's about as good as, I mean this is a good time to sell. [00:52:30] The waters could get a lot rougher.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:52:34):\n\nThat's true. I mean, the succession analogy isn't completely wrong because you really have kind of an old school media company and a new school technology company. And that was kind of the thesis of all four seasons of succession was that old media is dying and tech, big tech is taking over. And how we incorporate\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:52:54):\n\nThat. I think one of the big problems is that Disney undoubtedly has an enormous [00:53:00] amount of value right now, but the question is, is content going to continue to be valuable in itself? And it's very unclear that it will be. And so that content is, we may be going through kind of a hyperinflation of content where the stuff that you were sitting on may not be nearly as valuable 10 years from now or five years from now, or three years from now than it is now. But\n\nLeo Laporte (00:53:21):\n\nThen why would Apple want?\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:53:23):\n\nBecause the Glow, all of those things, while we may not care about that individual piece, but it attached [00:53:30] to the platform, is very valuable to Apple because again, you have all of this IP that you can use inside of your platform. You have all this IP that you can use inside of your marketing. You have all this IP that you can go through that system and you have things that, again, each piece isn't valuable, but filling out your entire catalog is. So having a wide catalog is valuable to Apple, wider than what Apple TV Plus has right now. And E S P N just keeps giving if you're looking at live, because live is the one thing that you can [00:54:00] still making money. So there's a lot of things that are there. So I think that, again, the content in itself isn't valuable. The magnifier of it being attached to Apple's, all of other apple's, other products that make it valuable for Apple and don't know, I don't even know who else could extract that value from Disney as efficiently as Apple could. Again,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:54:25):\n\nI agree that from Disney's point of view, this is a match made in heaven. I just don't think it's the same. [00:54:30] I think Tim Cook is going to need a lot of persuading.\n\njason Snell (00:54:32):\n\nYeah, it's a tougher call for, I think all of the stories and all the discussion about this make a pretty decent case for why this might be something Bob Iger wants. Why it's something that Tim Cook and Eddie Q want is it would be an enormous gamble. It would be huge. The reason, basically what I keep coming back to, and it's not much of a hot take, but this is what it is, is I think people who dismiss it out of hand don't understand, haven't recalibrated what [00:55:00] Apple is today. Apple has grown so much, it has so much power, it has so much money, it has so much value and there's so much pressure for them to keep growing as they've built that services business. Like the services business is bigger than Apple was 12 years ago. I mean, they feel pressure to grow and at some point the only way for them to grow is to be more than they are today.\n\n(00:55:26):\n\nAnd that is the wild card here for me is [00:55:30] today's Apple, apple of the 2020s. Does it say, sure, we will become an entertainment powerhouse by making these acquisitions or does it look at its competitors in the tech space and say they're all going to buy this stuff so we might as well? Or do they say, no, it's overpriced, it's not worth it. We'll pick some stuff off later when they're selling it for parts. I think that that's a fair argument. That's why I'm not convinced, [00:56:00] but I would say if you dismiss it out of hand, I think you should pay attention to how Apple has changed the last decade. I don't believe Apple of 2014 would do anything like this, but Apple at 2023, wow. It is such a different company that I think you can't rule it out\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:56:17):\n\nAnd just the value you have a good\n\nLeo Laporte (00:56:18):\n\nPiece. By the way, in Mac World last week, apple buying Disney isn't the fairytale it once was. When you're as big as Apple, you need to get creative\n\njason Snell (00:56:25):\n\nFairytale, huh?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:56:26):\n\nI get it.\n\njason Snell (00:56:27):\n\nWhen you\n\nLeo Laporte (00:56:29):\n\nNeed to get [00:56:30] creative in order to seek growth, so that's really the question is what is the problem Tim Cook has that this would solve\n\njason Snell (00:56:38):\n\nAnd it's supercharging the services business and adding a whole bunch of other new businesses that they think they can generate a lot of revenue and profit out of using their flywheel of their ecosystem. That would be\n\nLeo Laporte (00:56:50):\n\nArgument. Their biggest problem right now is this flywheel spinning really fast with momentum from the iPhone, but they've got to keep that going. They got to find the next thing [00:57:00] and honestly it ain't Vision Pro, but it's not the Apple car.\n\njason Snell (00:57:04):\n\nThe investors want growth and the biggest growth right now isn't services. So they're saying, well what if Disney plus and Parks even and cruises or whatever and other kind of entertainment that's very profitable, what of these are things that can help us point to a number and say, look at how profitable we are. Look at our huge growth in revenue.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:22):\n\nIt turns Apple into a correct suit though. It turns it into one of those Korean mega corporations that makes bulldozers, TVs and [00:57:30] microwave s I don't feel like it fits in with Apple to,\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:57:34):\n\nI think there's a lot of integration that's possible cruises. I think the parks and the cruises, I mean if you look at what they want to do, if\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:40):\n\nThey'd else\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:57:41):\n\nMakes sense,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:42):\n\nBuy E P n. Yeah, for the content and for sports, that makes a lot of sense. And you know what company, because of the ftc, you could also look down the road and say, well, if somebody's going to buy Disney, they're going to have to spin off parts of it and if it's a media company, they may well have to spin off Disney Plus and E S P N and we could just wait until that happens [00:58:00] and pick those little fruits up off\n\nAlex Lindsay (00:58:01):\n\nThe ground. It could be, I just think that if someone asked me What do you want to build? What would you love to build AR assets against? I would say Star Wars, Pixar, Marvel, these are incredible IP for Apple to build for its headset as well as all the things that going to insert into it. I think that the hardest part is the culture clash of just any company taking two companies and merging them together, but I think the math [00:58:30] is there, so it's just a matter of Apple figuring out whether they can get over the culture. This\n\nLeo Laporte (00:58:33):\n\nIs a huge acquisition though. The Microsoft Activision acquisition was 70 billion and people were going like, wow, it's the biggest thing. We're talking almost triple that. I mean this a very, would be a huge acquisition with lots\n\njason Snell (00:58:47):\n\nOf speed bump unless Bob Iger sells off a big chunk. I mean the premise in the t h R story is that he's going to sell off a, B, C and a B, C news and he might sell off E S P N or part of e espn. He might sell off Hulu [00:59:00] that there are parts of the business that he would sell off and then there would be a slimmer, more profitable Disney that he could either keep or that he could sell to a buyer like Apple. And that again, I think is within the realm of possibility for him. I would also argue that the idea that Apple becomes an unwieldy company that makes toothbrushes and bulldozers sort of went out the window when they started doing TV plus and Fitness Plus and things like that. I mean that services business, that aspect of it is weird [00:59:30] for a hardware and software company. So I think that's what I mean. I think they've been headed in this direction, but that they can't grow that business fast enough necessarily for what the investors want to sell. I\n\nLeo Laporte (00:59:41):\n\nDon't think it's, I\n\njason Snell (00:59:42):\n\nDon't totally,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:59:42):\n\nThere's a good argument that orthogonal because it's basically putting stuff on the hardware that they sell, which is what they've always done with Mac oss and system seven and that you got to put stuff, you can't just sell hardware, you got to put stuff on it and having a content arm makes perfect sense, especially since you could charge for the content and hardware [01:00:00] sales are slowing down. Hardware margins are much tighter. I feel like that's very consonant with what they're doing. I don't think cruises and parks are at all, not\n\njason Snell (01:00:11):\n\nTo mention if you're an, but they're not an intellectual property owner right now. And so I guess that would be the question is do you want to own Star Wars and Pixar and all the Disney stuff and Marvel? Because if you do, the argument would be do you want to let somebody else handle the parks experience and all of that and have it not be you or do you want to exert [01:00:30] complete control like you would and Disney does and have this extended experience where you part even more money from your customer and their wallets? It may be maybe not. Again, I think it's weird. I think it's super weird, but I think we are in weird times where this, I think the core question here is does Wall Street's insatiable need for growth, even from the most valuable and one of the most profitable companies in the world, cause it to distort itself in ways that make no sense. [01:01:00] And I think the answer might be yes, but I think it's super distorted and weird for them to even consider something like this. But they\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:01:06):\n\nMight. I mean the big thing is is that on top of whatever happens with the AR headset, the AR experiences at locations, the next 10 years, you're going to see a big explosion of that and there would be no lab better than Disneyland. So that being able to have phones to tell you where to go, how long the line is, when to get there, how to do, and having all of these services that you could build in, and [01:01:30] you have a place that you own that you don't have to keep on arguing about whether you can do another laser scan of it or figure things out. Or you could put, if they put ultra wide band in the entire Disney, Disney World in Disneyland, about 160 kids get lost a day having something that just, they find them obviously they really\n\njason Snell (01:01:54):\n\nGood at it and only 150 of them are found. Where are the other No\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:00):\n\n[01:02:00] Boys. I don't think that that's a big suck of money.\n\njason Snell (01:02:05):\n\nYeah, I think I can see the argument. My counterargument would be though, they could also give Bob Iger a cash infusion by licensing and having a strategic partnership about their content and about Apple in Disneyland and they could, the question is, do you need to spend all that money? Don't think, could you be a partner? Mr.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:28):\n\nPartner think has signaled he wants to sell it off for [01:02:30] parts. I think that's very clear. He was talking about that at the Allen, Alan and Co. And I think that really there's two choices for him either to do it himself or to bring into big private equity companies buys the whole thing and that's what private equity does. And then they polish it up and they sell off the parts. I think that's the future of Disney. Whether Apple wants to play or not is another matter. And I think there are some parts that Apple might reasonably want to include the content arms, but this is pretty, if this weren't August, I don't think we'd be talking [01:03:00] about this. When I say that, lemme put it that way. I know you Alex always have wanted, I always\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:03:04):\n\nPoint out, I've been talking about this. I know\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:05):\n\nYou love this idea. Yeah,\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:03:09):\n\nI just see that there's so much value for Apple to that ip, especially if it\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:13):\n\nWeren't so expensive. It's very expensive. That's a lot of\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:03:17):\n\nMoney for many companies. Apple is the largest publicly traded company in the world, and so they're\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:24):\n\nNot historically known for big acquisitions. The Beats acquisition was three or 4 billion. It [01:03:30] it was a fraction. They\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:03:31):\n\nJust peeled a couple dollars off the other edge.\n\njason Snell (01:03:33):\n\nThis is a big pill for them to swallow. It's like a horse pill, so maybe they won't do it. But I will say this, I am not confident in saying even giving the odds that Alex gave for a purchase like this, I have a hard time imagining that by the end of this decade, apple hasn't bought some giant intellectual property library, whether it's Disney or Paramount or something else. I have a hard time imagining that they won't use some of their cash to buy content because right now they've launched the service and it's very nice.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:04:00):\n\n[01:04:00] But isn't the timing bad? I mean, aren't streaming companies bleeding right now? No.\n\njason Snell (01:04:04):\n\nWell, that's why the timing is good because they're all bleeding and\n\nLeo Laporte (01:04:09):\n\nGoing to be Apple survive. But why should Apple build a streaming business?\n\njason Snell (01:04:13):\n\nWell, they already have it. They've already built it. They're doing it because it's extra revenue and it's very, very profitable. The margins are great and it's part of the whole iPhone revenue flywheel because their investors don't care that they lose money on streaming because they make it up somewhere else. And because they're building a huge business, whereas the tiny Hollywood [01:04:30] companies, their investors are freaked out that they're spending so much money on streaming content. Good point. So huge advantage for Apple. I think they will pick some stuff up, but the question is what's it going to be? But I have a hard time, a lot of the truth of that premise of are they going to eat all of Hollywood? I don't know that, but a lot of the libraries here are going to get snapped up by companies with big wallets.\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:04:51):\n\nI don't know if they need anything other than Disney. I think for Apple, if they bought Disney, they'd be like, okay, that's what done. That's what we have to work with. And then everybody else has to because it will [01:05:00] be, I think a turning point and Hollywood of suddenly everybody kind of figuring things out about what happens next. Because again, the challenge really with the strike is that the strike continues. It keeps on applying leverage to this and it puts a lot of these studios in a really complicated position because they don't really know how to make money outside of releasing the theaters. And if they empty the theaters, the theaters are going to have to find something else to do with themselves and they'll either close or come into a new business and they'll be a lot less interested in movies in 2026.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:29):\n\nThe story that's [01:05:30] of Strays is a cautionary tale. A movie which came out this weekend did very poorly because they say none of the stars could promote it, which is very, I think, yeah, that's telling there's trouble ahead. It seems to me that as you've already talked about both of you, Alex and Jason, the advantage big Tech has in content is overwhelming. And it strikes me that probably all the content will [01:06:00] be eventually owned by Amazon, Microsoft, apple, Google and Netflix. Netflix. You think Netflix is going to stick around?\n\njason Snell (01:06:08):\n\nYeah, I think they've built a wall for themselves that is not going to come down. I think that they're the winner of the Gold Rush and then everything else, all the other Gold Rush stuff happening in the entertainment industry, they all put themselves in a hole and now they've made themselves weak trying to be Netflix and it feels like maybe they're all just going to get bought up by Netflix as\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:06:27):\n\nCompetitors. And the problem is Netflix [01:06:30] did what no one else had the guts to do, which is spend 18 billion a year on content. I mean, I talked to a producer a couple of years ago and he's like, well, there's 900 producers and we're 900 short and we're just jamming out incredible amounts of content at a fairly high quality. And so I think that that's the Netflix built that up and now they have a reservoir to sit on for a long because a lot of stuff, I just keep finding new things. There's a new series that was three years old or five years old or whatever, and we start watching it and so [01:07:00] they've got a lot to sit on for It's true, true.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:07:02):\n\nIt's a good point. The strike is probably good for Netflix, isn't it?\n\nAndy Ihnatko (01:07:06):\n\nOne of the reasons why I dropped Disney Pluses because I realized that it is still possible for me to navigate their entire library and check off the things I want to see, and there's just no sense of surprise or discovery. It doesn't hurt that they make a lot of stuff that I'm just not interested in, but at least with Netflix, if I'm going to keep one, if I'm going to keep one commercial streaming service as something that, Hey, there's a new show that people are talking [01:07:30] about, maybe it'll be on this or Hey, wow, if I keep digging into documentaries, maybe it's going to recommend something that's going to be interesting on a night when I don't know what I want to watch. That's the one that's going to keep, I think Alex is right there. They are the brand right now and everybody else right now is just the, and in addition to Netflix, maybe I'll also have x, a lot of people, I'm auditing all my streaming this month, and the only two that are safe from elimination that have immunity idols [01:08:00] are Netflix and YouTube premium only because so much of my content is through YouTube and I don't want to see any of their damn commercials.\n\n(01:08:09):\n\nEverything else though, Hulu is on the block.\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:08:11):\n\nI've had a couple of times where my credit card, I changed my credit card or whatever, I lost my credit card usually, and my YouTube TV thing goes back to it's the worst premium. Oh my God. And you're\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:22):\n\nLike\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:08:22):\n\nFor two or three days and you're like, oh my gosh, I got to get a new credit card in there because you're just like, it is. I don't even know how, I don't even know how you could watch [01:08:30] that. Is that Apocalyp so frustrating? It's horrible. But I will say the one that we didn't talk about that is the other thing that will probably continue to succeed is YouTube tv. I agree. That's going to be the way there. So when you say that, if there was one that I had to choose from, I'd pick YouTube tv, I'd be like YouTube premium YouTube tv because that is, it's just\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:47):\n\nYour new cable company. That's your new cable company.\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:08:50):\n\nI mean those two are probably 80% of my viewing are just YouTube and YouTube TV at this point. And so it's,\n\njason Snell (01:08:58):\n\nWell just [01:09:00] to throw some cold water on that, the stats are that even the replacements for cable, like YouTube TV are going down. Cord cutting is hitting them too. So in the long run, that's all just going to go away and there'll be other ways to do it, but as somebody who subscribed, I subscribe to fuo, but it's the same thing, right? It's a cable replacement for now, but all that stuff is getting drained out of the cable bundle or at least replicated elsewhere. And it's possible for some people that paying for something like a cable bundle will still be the best deal [01:09:30] depending on what you want to watch. But in the long run, it's all going to fade away into nothing. But YouTube itself is huge. And why you can't discount, when we talk about Apple and Amazon and that story that's at Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and somebody else is like, well, no, no, no. Also Google will be there with YouTube at the very least, and YouTube is very different, but it's still huge.\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:09:53):\n\nThe level of specificness that you can be in YouTube always kind of amazes me. I'll just search for something. [01:10:00] I think I mentioned before I got really into the Battle of Corp for a little while. I was like, I was watching Henry the Fifth as you do, as you do, and I got into the Battle of Aging Corps and I watched four or five different 15 minute videos that were done about the battle so that I understood what was going on. I was watching Henry the Fifth and I was like, what really happened in this battle? And it was just amazing that five people had spent so much time building, one person had unreal engine people fighting. What the beauty of that showing [01:10:30] you the thing. And I love\n\nLeo Laporte (01:10:31):\n\nYouTube, paid nothing for that content,\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:10:34):\n\nPaid nothing for that content. It free. It was so good. Well, they pay advertising dollars against it. That person's getting, yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:10:41):\n\nThey pay a fraction of develop that they make on it, they pay to it and they have to pay for the stream, I guess. But it's a lot cheaper than buying Bridgeton. Oh yeah. I\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:10:52):\n\nMean, pretty amazing. YouTube tried to build their own content where they did all that didn't\n\nLeo Laporte (01:10:57):\n\nReally work. They were smart,\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:10:59):\n\nDidn't, [01:11:00] I don't think they really understood the cost per minute. The cost per minute that they wanted to pay was much lower than what everybody else pays and that they thought that they could make it incrementally better, but really there is YouTube, copper\n\nLeo Laporte (01:11:11):\n\nK Works though, right? Was that a it?\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:11:13):\n\nYeah, but\n\njason Snell (01:11:14):\n\nIt was a real hidden, and then Netflix picked it up, right? It actually worked better on Netflix because it was the kind of content that Netflix makes, and we see that a lot. That's part of the power of Netflix and why they will survive is Netflix is so powerful that they'll put anything in front of you to a certain degree and you will [01:11:30] watch it. And the best example is Suits a TV show that ran on the U S A network like a decade ago and was available on Peacock for years and years and years, and it is the most watched TV show of this summer. Really? It's just reruns of an old show. And why is it that? Because N B C Universal licensed it non exclusively to Netflix? Netflix, Netflix put it in their promotional spots, boom. It's a huge hit because that's the power of Netflix\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:11:56):\n\nAnd every time I open up Netflix, I've not opened that show, but every time [01:12:00] there's a woman in a bra on Netflix, they know how to\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:02):\n\nPromote.\n\njason Snell (01:12:03):\n\nThey know how,\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:12:04):\n\nSo\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:05):\n\nIt\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:12:05):\n\nShould be called, and I'm like, oh, I God, birthday suits Move on.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:08):\n\nExactly.\n\njason Snell (01:12:09):\n\nZing, take that old TV show that's been canceled for five years.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:14):\n\nThat's Amy\n\njason Snell (01:12:15):\n\nMarkle show. She was on that show.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:16):\n\nOh, that's right. Reason some people know about it. I've never seen it. I think if you're interested in this, you should be listening to Jason's podcast downstream with Julie Alexander because I'm guessing that you're, a lot of your insight is expressed in this particular\n\njason Snell (01:12:30):\n\n[01:12:30] Show and she's so smart. We're doing a new episode Thursday. She's an expert at this, and it is a fascinating time to be covering streaming media. Kidding? It is bananas out there.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:40):\n\nThis is really the topic of the day I just read, and this is completely peripheral, and then we're going to do a break, but I just read that Ronan Pharaoh's, wow, interesting profile of Elon Musk and the New Yorker, Elon Musk's shadow rule, how the US government came to rely on the tech billionaire and is now struggling to reign him in. And it [01:13:00] really reminds me of the sci-fi future where these big tech companies, and in some cases individuals are going to be the global power, not governments. And so in some ways we may look back on this 10, 20 years from now and say, this is Apple beginning to start to dominate in a way that,\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:13:21):\n\nI mean the thing is is that I don't know in that article, he's the one that had the satellites there and they act like he held everybody over, [01:13:30] but he told them for months that he needed someone else to pay for this. I didn't sign up for this. And he finally had to turn it off to get them to pay. And the D o D should have been paying for that from day one or used their own satellites. It was just crazy what our government did there was dumb. And so the fact that they were relying on a commercial entity to provide their services and their satellites for free, it was just a nutty thing for them to do. And I don't even know what thought process was [01:14:00] going on that we're going to allow a commercial entity, we're not going to pay for it. We're just going to hope that it stays there.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:14:06):\n\nWell, as Faroh points out, this is kind of what happened from Reagan on, which is a lot of government stuff was transferred to private industry. What's interesting now, the government's going, oh shoot, we don't have that capability, do we? So\n\njason Snell (01:14:21):\n\nThat story, the fascinating thing about that story is, and it's an example where you can't really count out Elon Musk, despite the fact that his Twitter stuff is a [01:14:30] complete dumpster fire is somebody, whether it was him or somebody at SpaceX, realized that SpaceX had essentially cornered the market on cheap access to space and they got so, so many much money out of it and business out of it from commercial satellite launches and from government stuff. And yet they built this reusable spacecraft and it's so cheap to launch it. And at some point they had that moment, which is, you know what? We can launch this thing so often for so cheap that we have enormous [01:15:00] unsold excess capacity. What could we do with it? And somebody said, why don't we just build a bunch of internet satellites and launched thousands of satellites and they did it.\n\n(01:15:09):\n\nThey've done that with their cheap access to space that nobody else has, and they've essentially created an entire other huge and important company inside SpaceX, which is starlink, and it's all because right now as that article points out, they are the biggest launcher of mass to space this year is going to be SpaceX [01:15:30] followed by China and then the rest of the world with about 10%, and they're using it to build other businesses now so they're dominant in other areas. It's really, somebody did something very smart, but it's also extremely disturbing that this one guy has access to everything on the internet around\n\nAndy Ihnatko (01:15:50):\n\nThe world, especially when you consider that starlink is responsible for tripling the number of objects in orbit. Right now up until before starlink, there's [01:16:00] something like fewer than 1800 objects total in orbit, and they alone have added about 5,000 and of course, but they're being good sports about it and saying, oh, well in the US government you shouldn't be allowing Boeing to create their own constellation for competing service because there's not enough room up there for us and any other competitor. It's only logical a bunch of\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:16:19):\n\nJerks. Well, the thing is, we've been pushing this. The government has been saying we're going to keep on paying for really hard things and then we want everyone else to do the other stuff. We want to outsource [01:16:30] that, and that's been actually pretty cost effective for the government. So the thing is that NASA works on getting to Mars, building the infrastructure. Artemis is the first step to that process of building a station for that, but we don't want deal. NASA didn't want to deal with continually putting up, NASA used to have to deal with, it was a big distraction for them to continue to do the satellite work, and so they got rid of that. We've been using, we used M C I satellites for a long time, so these are commercial satellites [01:17:00] that we would use for communication. One of the problems they had is that if you suddenly had a blackout, if you were out of the United States and there was suddenly a blackout in some of your connectivity, you knew that special operations were somewhere they're doing something because they'd have priority access to those satellites. And so we would buy all this stuff up and it's been something that hasn't, definitely not anything even remotely new. I mean, this is 30, 40 years old of us doing this and the United States puts up, we put up our own satellites, but our satellites are hard, and then we want to keep them secret and [01:17:30] we don't want, but we've commoditized. The other things are commoditized. G P S is basically a government funded technology that was then commercialized, which the government still can use at a slightly higher precision than our phones.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:17:45):\n\nYeah, let's take a little break. When we come back, we'll find something else to talk about. I'm sure that was a good one though. Thank you, Jason. Our show today brought to you by Discourse. If you go to our forums, [01:18:00] TWIT community, you're using Discourse. When I wanted to set up forums, it was Jono Bacon who convinced me that we really ought to have a place where people could go comment on shows and that kind of thing. I looked at a variety of stuff, but Jono said, don't even look at the other forum software. Look, this is the one Discourse Discourse hosts it for me. They make it easy. It is. The online home for the Twit community should be the online home for your community. I am fully convinced as a [01:18:30] longtime discourse user now for over a decade Discourse has made it their mission to make the internet a better place for online communities by harnessing the power of discussion they've got now, they just added real time chat ai, yes, disk AI discourse makes it easy to have meaningful conversations and collaborate with your community anytime, anywhere.\n\n(01:18:52):\n\nPodcasting's all about community. I mean that was the lesson. It's about the community. You build around you and [01:19:00] we want to make sure our community can interact with us in a way that they love and that's why we use discourse. Would you like to create a community? Go to discourse.org/twit. You'll get one month free on all self-service plans. It is open source, trusted by some of the largest companies in the world. It powers more than 20,000 online communities, and I have to say, the hosting at Discourse saves me so much energy that I just let them do it because they [01:19:30] do such a good job. They keep it up to date, they keep it secure. All the new features get added in a prompt fashion. It just works beautifully. Whether you're just starting out or want to take your community to the next level, there's a plan for you.\n\n(01:19:42):\n\nThere's a basic plan if you want to have a small private invite only community, very affordable. The standard plan, if you want unlimited members and a public presence, we of course use the business plan for active customer support communities. Jonathan B whose developer advocacy lead at Twitch [01:20:00] says, yes, Twitch uses a discourse is the most amazing thing we've ever used. We've never experienced software so reliable ever. I have to say I never really thought about the reliability of discourse except that I've never had a problem. I haven't had to think about it. Our Twich community runs on discourse. This is one of many themes you can use. This is one I like a dark theme, but not only can you choose your theme when you use discourse on the twit.community, you could choose your theme [01:20:30] as you set up your discourse community, and there are a lot of themes that can make it look like whatever you want it to look like.\n\n(01:20:36):\n\nA discourse is just fantastic. One of the biggest advantages to creating your own community with discourse. You own your own data. You always have access to all the conversation, history and discourse pledges. They will never sell your data to advertisers. Discourse gives you everything you need in one place with world-class hosted customer support. Make discourse the online [01:21:00] home for your community@discourse.org slash twit, DSE discourse like we're having a nice discourse here, discourse.org/twit. Get one month free on all self-serve plans. I'm such a fan, and if you want to try a discourse forum, go to TWIT community sign up. I think you'll see what a great place it is and it's all running on discourse discourse.org/twit. [01:21:30] I am a big, big fan as an administrator of our discourse instance, and by the way, I do it all by myself. Well, we have a volunteer, Paul, I'm sorry, I forgot you help a lot Paul Holder, but really it's easy to maintain and easy to run.\n\n(01:21:44):\n\nIt doesn't take a huge amount of manpower, and I really credit them for that discourse.org/twit. Alright, let's see here. I have a few shorties. This is actually kind of cool. Apple is now, I [01:22:00] guess it's Tesla really is adding Apple shortcuts, iOS shortcuts to the Tesla app, which I think is great. I wish Ford would do this. I wish all manufacturers would do this. Tesla's iOS app with Apple shortcuts means you can write your own command, have Siri, lock your doors, start your car, whatever it is you want to do. You can access the vehicle controls and climb it from the Apple shortcuts app. That's version four point 24.0.\n\njason Snell (01:22:28):\n\nYeah, so for example, you could [01:22:30] use your Apple watcher, your phone to use a Siri command to tell it to open the FR or unlock the doors or set the thermostat or there's a lot of things you can do. And then you could also set up automations that are based on triggers. Anything you can do with shortcuts in order to you connect to this, you entered this location, do this thing to the car. It's all, it doesn't look like a reed state. It only writes state, so it'll let you do something like say if the temperature goes [01:23:00] above this inside the car, then turn on the ac. That's not capable in this. That's too bad. There are other apps that do stuff like this that are like scraping the Tesla a p i, but Tesla seems to have finally gotten the news that shortcuts exists after a long time and it'll be useful because there are things that the Tesla app won't let Tesla owners do that on. There's no watch app, for example, so having the ability to run a shortcut or give a Siri command using [01:23:30] a watch when you don't have your phone with you, that's a nice to have. It's a good modern app thing, so it's nice if\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:37):\n\nThey add it. Yeah, I'd love to have it go both ways. Or you could say How much gas is left in my Tesla? That kind of thing would be really,\n\njason Snell (01:23:43):\n\nYes. Well, very little. But yeah, the idea of do you need to charge it? And it says, well, no, you've got 80% or whatever.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:49):\n\nWell, you can do that anyway in the Tesla app will tell you what you're charging. Yeah, you\n\njason Snell (01:23:53):\n\nCan look at the app, but you can't do it as a shortcut or ask Siri or something like that.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:58):\n\nRight. [01:24:00] Let's see, Mac, oh, this is a weird story, but I like eclectic light.co. They dig deep into the contents. Actually I should say he digs deep into the contents of the Mac oss. He noted that MAC OSS updates for Apple Silicon Max are larger than reported, and there's an easy way to tell. It turns out, I guess that the updates [01:24:30] include the intel content and then there's a second download for the silicon, apple silicon. So for instance, in the case of the 13.5 0.1 update, 500 megabytes for Intel reported as 700 megabytes for apple silicon, but there's a second component only downloaded by apple silicon, which is 1.1 gig. So really apple silicons was 1.8 gigs compared to 500 megs for Intel, [01:25:00] and you can tell that when you use the software update command. This is a command line command, but there's a switch. Include config data, which I played with and it tells you some interesting stuff. Don't know what it means, don't know why we care, but if you've noticed that you're getting these massive updates on your M one and M two max, what's going on? No comment. I guess it would be multiple code bases. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:25:30):\n\n[01:25:30] I don't think I would notice if it, you turn on the update and then you go, I just\n\nLeo Laporte (01:25:34):\n\nLet it go.\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:25:35):\n\nYou come back then. But there are people you don't really think about\n\nLeo Laporte (01:25:38):\n\nIt who bandwidth is constrained or they pay for their bits and those people would probably be,\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:25:44):\n\nIt takes a long time. I mean, I definitely am conscious to the fact that I usually start an update before I go to bed and then I sign whatever it needs to sign and then I go do my thing. Yeah,\n\njason Snell (01:25:54):\n\nI wonder if there's a security issue here where there's a sealed volume or something that has to be downloaded in [01:26:00] its entirety, right? In order for some sort of security, it's signed and sealed. That is different in a way. They did some of that stuff on Intel, but I wonder if there's some aspect of what has happened with Apple Silicon that they have to do a more or a less efficient, let's say, kind of download for some security reason.\n\nAndy Ihnatko (01:26:18):\n\nPart of the installation process involves in running something under rev VMs or something like that,\n\njason Snell (01:26:24):\n\nOr there's a sign volume that they aren't going to update it piece by piece. They're just going to swap in the whole volume, [01:26:30] and so they have to download the whole volume. Even I would be, if some of it changes,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:26:33):\n\nI wouldn't be at all surprised the way A P F SS divides your volumes into these hidden volumes data and system.\n\nAndy Ihnatko (01:26:42):\n\nI mean, the reason why I have an update waiting for me on my MacBook, one of the reasons why I haven't installed it yet is that, oh, I'm visiting someone's house and the power could go out because there are storms coming and the thing that everybody fears [01:27:00] is what if there's something that interrupts a system update right in the middle of it? So they've been getting better and better at preventing that sort of thing from happening, but the idea of let's build the entire thing first, get that stable, and then as a last step we will write it to the volume.\n\njason Snell (01:27:14):\n\nActually, the curious, the most curious thing about this report is that you can set up a content caching server so that your one Mac on your house will download the update and then all the other Macs will just download it from that Mac. It's a eclectic feature for eclectic light co, but some people do it. [01:27:30] The second download for Apple silicon won't be cached. It always has to be download. It has to be downloaded from Apple, which again feels like a security thing to me that they're trying to prevent people from setting up a fake image somewhere and having that be downloaded instead. But it does mean that that great caching server you set up is not going to prevent that 1.1 gigabyte download on every computer in your house.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:27:51):\n\nI think you nailed\n\nAndy Ihnatko (01:27:52):\n\nIt. It's right. I think we get confirmation by visiting a Macintosh forum and see how upset they are [01:28:00] about something that's happened in the past three or four days. Because anytime Apple's, a lot of the reasons why Apple makes these big changes to the way installations and updates happen is because someone has found a bug or a trick and they want that bug or trick to go away,\n\njason Snell (01:28:17):\n\nAlthough this is apple silicon, right? So not Intel where the Macintosh people are, so maybe they don't care, but you're, that's a classic is the Macintosh people find a loophole and then Apple closes the loophole and then they find another loophole. [01:28:30] Inevitably\n\nAndy Ihnatko (01:28:31):\n\nCould be a security thing just in general too. Yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:28:33):\n\nI think you're right. I think it's a signed blob and that would make perfect sense. By the way, Howard Oakey and Eclectic light.co is an amazing website because he's a painter too, and it's truly eclectic, but this is not it, but I will show you the site. There you go. He also has a series of four paintings by Eugene de Laqua and the story of that, which he published this week as well. So [01:29:00] it's a very eclectic max painting and more. Very interesting. Well,\n\nAndy Ihnatko (01:29:06):\n\nOf course, the payoff is that he has great content in late August, whereas we were talking\n\nLeo Laporte (01:29:10):\n\nAbout the thing is\n\nAndy Ihnatko (01:29:13):\n\nYou can go out on the all season radials until maybe October, but in New England, if you don't switch to the snow tires, I mean you don't want to cheap out on tires. That's all I'm saying. That's where most of your breaking comes from in handling,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:29:26):\n\nAnd if you want to know, the\n\njason Snell (01:29:26):\n\nGood news for eclectic is that just when the iPhone comes [01:29:30] out, that's actually the slow period for painting news. So it all works out. It's perfect\n\nLeo Laporte (01:29:35):\n\nPainting the rest of the year in September, it's iPhones, so let's see. I don't know who put this in, but it's really interesting from the m I T technology review, Claire Evans article, by the way, I love the M I T technology reviews. I pay for it on the front. The picture is from the 1987 reveal of the Saab 9,000 CD sedan, [01:30:00] 2,500 people in the audience, they were treated to an hour long. This is Saab an hour long operetta involving 26 foot tall projection screens, a massive course, the entire Stockholm Philharmonic and 50 performers to announce a car. This is the history of the corporate presentation for million dollar slideshow to Steve Jobs introduction of the iPhone.\n\nAlex Lindsay (01:30:28):\n\nI feel like you almost have to start [01:30:30] by looking at Mad Men and watching Carousel. That's what started this idea. It's not history, but the idea, I just find Carousel to be one of the coolest\n\nLeo Laporte (01:30:46):\n\nPieces of tv. In 1948 with the end of prohibit"
