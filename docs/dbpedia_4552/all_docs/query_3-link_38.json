He is the creator of TwitFlash.\n\nHe is portrayed by David Blue.\n\nDescription\n\nRick is an adult who has brown hair and eyes. He wants to destroy the internet because he feels that people spend too much time on their phones and laptops.\n\nHistory\n\nIn Part 1: A New Evil, Rick Twitler is seen being taken hostage by a villain called the Beekeeper in the Swellview Honey Factory. After Captain Man takes out the Beekeeper, he frees Rick and he asks where Kid Danger is. Captain Man tells him that he isn't there and Rick takes out a remote that instantly traps Captain Man. He then reveals that he stole the Worlds Most Poisonous Cactus from Cactus Con in which the Gas from the Cactus is what is trapping Captain Man. Captain Man tells Rick that he has fought a lot of bad guys and he always wins which Rick then responds with, \"I'm not your average bad guy, Ray Manchester\". He then tells Captain Man that he hacked the Man Cave while he was at Cactus Con and reveals that he knows everything about him including his name, where the Man Cave is located and his age. Later on, Rick explains to Captain Man that he is going to take away his indestructible powers with a chemical called AMORE. It is revealed that when Henry and Ray were sprayed with Flabber Gas, it never actually left their bodies even after the effects of it were gone, then on Halloween night when the two re-entered our universe, they were covered in interdimensional bio residue which takes years to wash off your skin. Then when Whistlin' Susie was delivered to the Man Cave it dosed Ray and Henry with gamma rays and finally on Henry's birthday the tenth layer of his Diez Leches Cake was what brought it all together creating AMORE.\n\nAfter Rick explains to Captain Man about how he will steal his power, Kid Danger drops onto Rick and zaps him. Rick then tells Captain Man and Kid Danger about how he was going to destroy the internet because he is tired with people constantly looking at their screens and even admits that it was partially his fault since he created Twitflash. He then shows the two his machine that would create a living organic virus that would infect every piece of technology on the planet. Kid Danger zaps him again and Captain Man asks him why he wanted their powers. Rick tells them that if he had an indestructible virus with super fast reflexes, the virus could never be stopped. After Kid Danger zaps Rick once again and partially frees Captain Man who is now stuck under the broken machine, he heads over to Rick and Rick then springs another trap on Kid Danger and steals his Power. He then leaves the two and tells them \"see you in the dark ages\" and leaves the factory.\n\nMoving forward in Part 2: A New Darkness, he appears on the screens in the man cave, telling Ray and Henry that he sent goons to Henry's house. Later, he appears on the screens again, telling Ray and Henry to enjoy their internet while they can, and they'll soon have to read a book if they want information. A couple minutes later, all the power in Swellview is out.\n\nFinally in Part 3: A New Hero, Rick Twitler touched the living computer virus, which takes over his body and turning him into Virus, a creature that could turn other people like him by sneezing on them. He then proceeds to sneeze to the goon on the floor, taking over their body as well. The two proceed to sneeze towards Captain Man and Kid Danger. Kid Danger eludes him but the virus falls on Captain Man, who is not affected as his power protected him. But the virus falls on Kid Danger in his hands, so he took off the gloves he wore before he becomes a virus.\n\nThen, he goes to the ceiling to stop Rick's plan with the antivirus, while the Captain fights against the other infected with the virus. When Kid Danger tries to use the antivirus Rick causes it to fall to the ground and breaks, Kid Danger does not know what to do and Rick begins to execute his plan to destroy the internet, then Kid Danger makes the decision to grab the antivirus with his hands to take him to Rick to stop him, in this way he loses his powers again. Then the virus leaves the body of Rick and he returns to normality, being defeated and losing his memory.\n\nIn Escape Room, it is revealed that he made a video in case his plan failed. He sent the blueprints of The Omega Weapon to The Messenger to give to the right villain to drain Captain Man's powers and destroy him.\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nHacking Skills: Rick was able to hack the Man Cave.\n\nConversion Sneeze: When the computer virus got on him he was able to turn others into an angry virus by sneezing on them.\n\nHigh Intelligence: Rick Twitler has a cunning mind and developed a complicated plan to destroy the internet, as shown by his developing all the ingredients for the AMORE molecule, which he used to take Ray/Captain Man and Henry/Kid Danger's superpowers, but he only ended up taking Henry's. He also has incredible hacking skills, as he hacked the Man Cave's computer, which was unhackable, and knows the heroes' identities. He also created his own living organic computer virus and designed an Omega Weapon that can take away Captain Man's superpower just long enough for the right villain to destroy him. Since he no longer has his memory he possibly doesn't have this ability anymore.\n\nSkilled Thievery: It was revealed that he was the one that stole the World's Most Poisonous Cactus from Cactus Con. It is unknown how he got in the convention and stole it when Ray, Henry, and Charlotte were stopping people, in addition to hacking the Man Cave all at once. Since he thinks people were on their phones all the time it's possible he easily snuck in when they weren't looking.\n\nComputer Virus: He created his own living organic computer virus that can spread and infect any computer in the world. His body touched it after Captain Man punched him, thus he became a living computer virus that could spread and destroy humanity. It had Henry's Super-Fast Reflexes as well its own power to sneeze on people to turn them into viruses. His computer virus was destroyed and both Rick Twitler and his goon turned back to normal when Kid Danger gave it the Anti Virus. Rick Twitler no longer has any memory of who he is or who Ray and Henry are, as the virus scrambled his brain cells.\n\nSuper-Fast Reflexes: When his virus took his body, it had Henry's Hyper Motility. It dodged all of Captain Man's surprise punches and defeated him in battle. It was also able to hold its own against Kid Danger, whose speed matches his. After Henry gave him the Anti-Virus, he lost this power.\n\nAppearances\n\nPart 1: A New Evil\n\nPart 2: A New Darkness\n\nPart 3: A New Hero\n\nEscape Room (After Credit Scene Only)\n\nTrivia\n\nRick is the fourth villain to know Kid Danger and Captain Man's true identities, the other three being Brad Belcher, Gwen, and Drex Stinklebaum.\n\nHowever, he briefly lost his memory in Part 3: A New Hero and did not remember it.\n\nHis catchphrase is \"Game On!\"\n\nHis name is a reference to the popular social media platform Twitter.\n\nThe initial letters of his name RT are a reference to the ReTweet of Twitter.\n\nHe only lured Captain Man and Kid Danger to his secret lair to trap them and steal their powers, not to be saved.\n\nHe continued with his plan even though he only stole the power of Kid Danger, his original plan was to steal the powers of Captain Man and Kid Danger.\n\nHe is a member of Evil Science Corp.\n\nIt is unknown if Barge was working for him.\n\nIt is also unknown if Vice Mayor Willard was helping him since he sent the bomb to the Man Cave.\n\nHe opposes the very existence of which he created (TwitFlash itself).\n\nIt was revealed that he was the one that stole the World's Most Poisonous Cactus from Cactus Con.\n\nIt is unknown how he got in the convention and stole it when Captain Man, Kid Danger, and Charlotte were stopping people, in addition to hacking the Man Cave all at once.\n\nIt is unknown if he's prone to bad luck when Henry lands onto him and when Henry zapped him repeatedly.\n\nHe hates bees.\n\nHe is right-handed.\n\nHe has a mother who lives in Boca, Florida.\n\nRick Twitler looks and dresses similar to another villain, Dr. Minyak.

He is the former CEO of TwitFlash and tried to control the internet. He is a returning villain from Henry Danger.\n\nHe is portrayed by David Blue.\n\nDescription and Personality\n\nRick is an adult who has brown hair and eyes. He is a very dangerous scientist who tried to destroy the internet because people spent a lot of time on their laptops, but was defeated by Kid Danger. Rick is a difficult enemy to defeat because he managed to save an emergency video and transported his consciousness to a virtual reality helmet to ensure that his threat remained valid.\n\nTwitler is very deceptive as he was able to ally himself with Drex, whom he uses as a thug to trap Henry, using Drex's hatred for Henry to capture him and use his power. In his cyborg form, Twitler has cybernetic enhancements and his left eye is cybernetic, with which he points a laser and has a robotic part in his head.\n\nHistory\n\nYears before, Rick Twitler created TwitFlash and tried to eliminate the internet from Swellview because people were always using their phones and laptops. Twitler tried to carry out his plans with a dangerous virus, coming into conflict with Captain Man and Kid Danger, who lost his hypermobility in his battle, but Kid Danger managed to defeat Twitler, erasing his memory and eliminating the virus.\n\nIn An Imposter Among Us, Rick Twitler used a virtual reality headset to control Mika's mind. While beginning his plan, Rick Twitler (as Mika) encountered Drex, Chest Monster and Tiny Ray in a cell. Drex argued with Twitler about who was Captain Man's arch-enemy. Rick explains that he saved his consciousness, made it into a video game and sended it to Danger Force. Twitler, inside Mika's body, takes revenge on Ray, sending him into space with a trash rocket, but he manages to return and deduces that someone was behind it, mentioning along with the Danger Force several enemies until Twitler reveals himself.\n\nTwitler explains to his enemies about his saving consciousness and is easily immobilized, before being taken to the Macklin House at night, where Schwoz and Danger Force performed an exorcism to expel the consciousness from Twitler's body, resulting in success, freeing Mika. Even though the Danger Force believed that Twitler's threat had disappeared, his consciousness was still in the virtual reality headset, laughing evilly.\n\nIn A Danger Among Us, Rick Twitler possessed helper monkey in order to put his consciousness into the body of a cyborg and became Cyborg Rick Twitler. To distract the Danger Force, Twitler frees Drex from his cell so he can take revenge on his enemies, while he gets used to his new robotic body. Twitler launched the Man's Nest into space with the help of the trash rockets.\n\nIn A Cyborg Among Us, Twitler had an interview with Mary and Trent to reveal their goals of destroying the internet. By taking the reporters hostage, Twitler was ready to initiate his plan and infect the KLVY satellite with his virus. Twitler faced Brainstorm and AWOL until he was defeated. When the Danger Force went virus, Twitler was happy that his plan worked, but Volt saved everyone. Twitler and Drex kidnapped Chapa and Mika for their plan.\n\nIn A Henry Among Us, Twitler had kidnapped ShoutOut and Volt and turned them evil at Nakatomi Tower. Drex was about to throw him off the roof until he said he can help Drex get revenge on Henry Hart. Twitler told Drex that after Captain Man left the KLVY, he called Henry for his help, revealing his survival and convincing Drex to go after Henry. Twitler indirectly told his plans to his enemies, as he planned to control the internet and it would give him the ability to control the world with different weapons. He straps Henry to a machine to steal his force field powers.\n\nTwitler is confronted by Drex by not allowing him to fight Henry, but Drex agrees to the revenge style. When Captain Man, AWOL and Brainstorm arrive, they all face off. Twitler, evil ShoutOut and evil Volt confront Henry, AWOL and Brainstorm, who free the two heroines and avoid being shot by Twitler's laser. After AWOL and Brainstorm turn ShoutOut and Volt back to normal, Twitler attempted to attack Henry, but he was able to free himself, allowing ShoutOut and Volt to attack Twitler, defeating him. After destroying the machine, Cyborg Twitler's head is separated from his body and locked by Schwoz in a cube never to be seen again. However, Twitler's body runs through the Nest, being chased by Schwoz, while the Danger Force and Henry laugh.\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nHacking Skills: Rick was able to hack the Man's Nest.\n\nHigh Intelligence: Rick Twitler has a cunning mind and developed a complicated plan to destroy the internet, as shown by his developing all the ingredients for the AMORE molecule, which he used to take Ray/Captain Man and Henry/Kid Danger's superpowers, but he only ended up taking Henry's.

He also created his own living organic computer virus and designed an Omega Weapon that can take away Captain Man's superpower just long enough for the right villain to destroy him.
