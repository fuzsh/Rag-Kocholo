The reason for this is a lack of references. While scanning the article, I noticed quite a few errors in the discography section. Looking over its talk page showed me why: Nobody there knows all that much about Them. There was actually a debate over just which releases are the 11 studio albums. The consensus was that Long Tall Weekend and Here Come the ABCs were not in that list, but that STD was. Needless to say, I was floored. There is an entire category on Wikipedia for They Might Be Giants and, frankly, most of them could use work. Very few of them are stubs. Most of them are inaccurate or vague. This looks like a job for...US! What does everyone say? — User:ACupOfCoffee@ 03:46, 23 Feb 2006 (CST)\n\nIt's pretty much been cleaned up, Now it just needs a bibliography. Help on this part would be especially appreciated. — User:ACupOfCoffee@ 21:24, 26 Feb 2006 (CST)\n\nNot to revive a sorta old issue, but I've been adding infoboxes to any album or EP page I find that doesn't have one. So, HOORAY! Melchior 16:12, 16 Mar 2006 (CST)\n\nMain Page Help?[edit]\n\nHow come the edit is gone on the main page? I had an article I wanted to post, but I can't seem to do so... --Sir_Zman\n\nClick Add a news item on the bottom of the main page. -CapitalQ 15:26, 5 Jan 2006 (EST)\n\nOdd how its different from every other page...oh well, thanks for the info... --Sir_Zman\n\nThe Main Page has been \"protected\". I'm guessing so that it won't get any spam or vandalism. Whenever I visit a wiki for the first time and the first thing I see is spam, I know that there's either littlre interest in that particular wiki, that nobody cares about it enough to clean it up, or that there's hardly anybody active on it, that it's basicaly \"dead\" and what's the point of trying to join a dead community? — User:ACupOfCoffee@ 15:11, 6 Feb 2006 (CST)\n\nPics from NYE[edit]\n\nI saw on the newsgroup that Mizary has pics up at http://www.elvis77.com/tmbg2005nye/. I have some at my website too, http://www.jwoltman.net/news.php?extend.86 .\n\nNice pics, thanks! I especially love the Auld Lang Syne video. I've added a link to your page to the wiki page for this show—feel free to edit/emend/remove as you like, of course. — aliste\n\nWhy is it that you guys don't care about giving away audio that's for sale at the official store? It seems like if there's video attached to it, that makes it okay?? Is your justification that it's lower quality... ?-TDK 21:49, 14 Jan 2006 (EST)\n\nCan you buy a fan-made video of TMBG performing there? ;) -Ecks\n\nIf someone official doesn't want it online, they can tell me. I uploaded it for my friends who were at the show with me. - repugnant\n\nNew Song Category[edit]\n\nI have an idea for a new song category, how do I go about creating it? -Martorano\n\nThe category would be for songs written by one of the Johns yet sung by the other. For example, \"The World's Address\" (written by Linnell/sung by Flans) and \"Man It's So Loud In Here\" (written by Flans/sung by Linnell).\n\nReally? \"Man, It's So Loud In Here\" was written by Flans? Well, if you can think of a bit more than 2 songs that fit that description, just find the template (the link's on the main page somewhere), fill in the songs on that, and then add the song theme (manually) to each song page. -Magbatz\n\nWell, in Gigantic, the demo that Flans plays is him singing it (besides saying that no other band member had heard the demo before). -Ecks\n\nActually, the band had just not yet heard the final (dance) mix of the song, which is what's on Mink Car. It's not a demo, and it's not Flansburgh singing it. I'm not sure why you thought it was. -TDK 08:52, 15 Feb 2006 (CST)\n\nSpiffy. To whoever came up with this idea, there's also Subliminal (Flansy wrote the words, and then JL came up with the music and ending up doing the vocals) and Rat Patrol (Flans sings on the demo, but Linnell sings on the album) if you still want to do that page. -Magbatz\n\nI guess I should log in before I post a wonderful new idea. Anyway, what should I call the new category, any suggestions? -Martorano\n\nSorry it took so long, but I added a new category called \"Swapped Vocals\". -Martorano\n\nTwo things about TV appearances[edit]\n\nFirst, if anyone knows a lot of them please make a page for them.\n\nsecond, if anyone has any videos or mp3's of TV appearances please post them here. I, for one really want to see the they'll nedd A Crane performance which i think was on Letterman. Anyways, please help!\n\nVideos. Though, there are some missing, such as Boss Of Me and Your Racist Friend and She's Actual Size. Man, It's So Loud In Here has an MP3 of a very good performance on Conan. -Ecks\n\nI have Birdhouse in Your Soul and Istanbul (Not Constantinople) from The Tonight Show from around '90-'91 and Your Racist Friend from Late Night with David Letterman from the same year but no video capture card. Should I bother to find a way to digitize them?\n\nIt souldn't be too hard to get just the audio.\n\nI'm on it then (it's mono :( ). I also MAY still have an MTV performance of \"Why Does the Sun Shine?\" but thus far have not been able to find it. After this and the Exquisite Dead Guy demo I don't have any other rare (?) stuff.\n\nNew files--OdiamosTMBG 18:20, 27 Jan 2006 (EST)\n\nThe Tonight Show:\n\nThe_Tonight_Show_1990_01_Birdhouse_in_Your_Soul.mp3 Birdhouse in Your Soul\n\nThe_Tonight_Show_1990_02_TMBG_Interview.mp3 TMBG Interview\n\nThe_Tonight_Show_1990_03_Istanbul_(Not_Constantinople).mp3 Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\n\nLate Night:\n\nLate_Night_1990_01_Your_Racist_Friend.mp3 Your Racist Friend\n\nThere are a bunch of TV appearances here. There are still some missing though like They'll need a crane from Letterman and probbably others. By the way, if anyone knows how to make realplayer videos into windows media player ones please do on the ones on that page. Some of them are in windows media but not all and wenevr i try to look at ones in real it just sits there and wen i klik play it just does nothing. if anyone can help in anyway please do. i really wanna watch sum of these videos.\n\nI know nothing about They Might Be Giants[edit]\n\nCan someone explain that logo to me?\n\nThat guy is William Allen White - Artnchicken\n\nThe logo also pays homage to the MediaWiki logo. The double square brackets are used in WikiCode to make a link. See http://www.mediawiki.org/ for more information. - Scott Redd\n\nLi'l Help?[edit]\n\nHey,\n\nCool site, I run a wiki too at: http://www.wikiguitar.net\n\nI am really trying to get the thing off the ground and I wondering if anyone wants to help...But more specifically the tabs on this site would be extremely helpful! Is there anyone who would have a problem with me adding the tabs from here...to my site?\n\nJust let me know. Danielecook@gmail.com\n\nIt's a wiki, of course you can. Everything on here is licensed via the GFDL (Gnu Free Documentation License), and is free to take as long as appropriate credit is given. Actually, if anything on here isn't GFDL/fair use it's got to go, because we could get our asses sued off otherwise. Now if TMBG gave this site their blessing like The Brothers Chaps did with HRWiki.... I think you get my point. — User:ACupOfCoffee@ 04:33, 8 Dec 2005 (EST) LEGAL EDIT: No it's not. It's licensed with CCby-nc-sa2.5 And I was the one who wrote the Project:Copyrights page. — User:ACupOfCoffee@ 22:34, 30 Mar 2006 (CST)\n\nAttention: Everybody Whose Username Begins with a Lowercase Letter![edit]\n\nAll of you will no longer have access to your user accounts after the upgrade is complete. There is a bug in MediaWiki 1.5 which allows usernames to only begin with a capital letter. I have seen this happen at HRWiki. Look here to see what we had to do to fix it. — User:ACupOfCoffee@ 15:04, 30 Nov 2005 (EST)\n\nI had reviewed that HRWiki page on Tom's suggestion, and I didn't really see any userids that would be affected in our user-list. If they show up with a upper-case letter in the user list, I would assume they are ok, then, correct? --Duke33 15:15, 30 Nov 2005 (EST)\n\nYep. Watchlists should be reset, too. And some users might have a tough time getting their user talk pages off of their watchlist, and consequently, getting the \"you have new messages\" box to go away. I kind of figured you admins knew about this, so this particular notice was mostly posted for the forewarning of everyone else. — User:ACupOfCoffee@ 18:00, 30 Nov 2005 (EST)\n\nAhhh, the wiki's down![edit]\n\nAhhh the wiki's going down intermittently! What's going on? I got this just a little bit (maybe 45 minutes) ago.\n\nA database query syntax error has occurred. This may indicate a bug in the software. The last attempted database query was:\n\n(SQL query hidden)\n\nfrom within function \"MediaWikiBagOStuff:_doquery\". MySQL returned error \"1062: Duplicate entry 'tmbwnet_wikidb:messages:Sitenotice' for key 1 (localhost)\"\n\nWhat's going on? — User:ACupOfCoffee@ 05:17, 8 Dec 2005 (EST)\n\nYes, I frequently find the site down in the late night/early morning hours. It was down a few nights ago as well.\n\nWe're working on it...it's not just our site, it's our hosting provider, and it's affecting all of the sites that they host. We hope to have it resolved soon. --Duke33 11:26, 8 Dec 2005 (EST)\n\nOkay, good to know. — User:ACupOfCoffee@ 14:39, 8 Dec 2005 (EST)\n\nPodcast[edit]\n\nThe podcast is supposedly out. Where does one sign up for this? --BlarJotunn\n\nThe url is on the mainpage (at least for signing up through itunes). Ok, so we had someone throw together a page for the first podcast. Does someone want to take a stab at cleaning it up, and coming up with a podcast template? Also, i would assume that we would create pages for all the songs within the podcast. (by the way - i haven't downloaded it and listened yet...) --Duke33 10:52, 9 Dec 2005 (EST)\n\nI'll tackle it with the Songs template too, I suppose. -Ecks\n\nLyrics template, you mean? --Duke33 11:12, 9 Dec 2005 (EST)\n\nBastard Video[edit]\n\nIs it just me, or is this a really great video? I watched it 3 times in a row! The art is creative, it's edited on the beat of the song perfectly, and it's kind of funny. Thoughts?\n\nYeah, it's a great video, but I must say, it looks much better on a TV. The DVD to Flash conversion process sure can take a chunk out of the quality. -CapitalQ\n\nTV Appearances[edit]\n\nI think it would be a pretty cool idea if someone could make up a page of all of They Might Be Giants' TV aapearances. So, if anyone knows a lot of their TV appearances please make this page.\n\nBemanistyle Error \"Topic does not exist\"[edit]\n\nIf you log in to at Bemanistyle.com and you recieve an error saying \"The topic or post you requested does not exist\" then just go back to tmbw.net and click the link again. They seem to be having troubles with cookies. --Droffats 16:51, 1 Nov 2005 (EST)\n\nIs there anyway to see the entire list of TMBG songs rated by TMBW and how they fall in the lineup?\n\n{{{1}}}Link Removed - Ecks\n\n=donkeysWhy isn't there any entry on \"Two Plus Three Equals One\"? It's the only song where Flansy's ever shown off his mad rapping skeels...\n\nToo Plus 3 R One. Search just doesn't like that song. - Ecks\n\nI guess no ideas to put this interview then?\n\n-try Archived Radio Appearances -Badqueso 22:34, 30 May 2005 (EDT)\n\nOk thats a good idea i admit. However it only streamed for 7 days but i have the interview. So i can't put a link as i don't have a link to put it to anymore\n\nWhere can you find \"Power Of Dial-A-Song\"? is it a CD?--Pnihill2000 18:43, 10 Jun 2005\n\nWhat is the deal with this? A list of songs and this album is listed on this site, but no one seems to have them or be willing to share if they do. :-(\n\n-It is a bootleg of old Dial-A-Song recordings. I have it and I'll give you a copy if you like. -BlarJotunn\n\n- BlarJotunn, I have a lot of the songs you're looking for and I'm very, VERY interested in getting the old Dial-A-Song recordings! E-mail me: noveus@hotmail.com\n\nsure! How will you send it? Will you send it online, or do I have to buy a CD from you? email me at pnihill2000@yahoo.com\n\n-thanks\n\nWhats the story on \"88 Lines about 44 Women\" and \"I be an Reatarted\" Why arn't they on any TMBG albums? Whats the story on this?--Pnihill2000 18:43, 10 Jun 2005\n\nUh...the story is that those songs aren't TMBG songs. — aliste\n\nCheck out Songs Incorrectly Attributed To TMBG --Duke33 21:04, 3 Jun 2005 (EDT)\n\n-ah ok thanks.\n\nDoes anyone know if that Clarissa Explains it all Flood Wall Fixture thing ever existed? Or did they just make it for the show? Because I was always envious of that....\n\nSomeone needs to make a They Day Page.\n\nSome of the lyrics pages look funny, with <p> tags appearing in them somehow (see Boss Of Me for an example). And the spacing given with <br> looks kind of silly in the current style sheet.\n\nI was going to fix it, but then I realized we may want to talk about it first. Perhaps this time around we can agree on what a lyrics page is supposed to look like? I've always thought the <pre> enclosed pages looked silly for lyrics, and they look even sillier now, with the dotted border around them. Thoughts? --Veloso\n\nWhy not use <p> tags with a class of \"lyrics\"? Then you can edit now and worry later with the magic of CSS.\n\nI noticed that the news about the TMBG Radio tribute was posted on the 22nd, but marked as being for the 21st. SO, is that radio show at 10pm going on on the 23rd, or the 22nd?\n\nI'd think that it would be on the 22nd, as the schedule page on kxua says that there's a special artist feature every Wednesday.\n\nThe stuff they're playing right now is awful. Dozen-minute songs of slow-paced melodically disgusting humming and whistling is hardly something I'd want to listen to.\n\nOh, and I guess this is Arkansas time?\n\n---\n\nIs there any /dev/null to move pages to? I know administrators can delete, but I'm guessing there's no way for users to? Because the old Recent Changes is still there with abandoned text. User:Random\n\nDial-A-Song's revival?[edit]\n\nI was just listening to the TMBG Clock Radio and just surfin' when I caught the end of an announcement about listening tgo your favorite TMBG songs on your cell phone. I can only assume this means Dial-A-Song is coming back. They also said it coming very soon. The clock radio has been known to repeat old announcements, so I don't know what this means. Anyone else have any information? I'll keep an ear out for the announcement to repeat. --User:Droffats\n\nInstruments?[edit]\n\nwhat instruments (like brand) do each member play, im a drummer and want to know what kind of drums marty and/or dan used. - cyclopswithbangs\n\nCheck the liner notes. I know they gave special thanks to several companies, like Yamaha, in Here Come the ABCs (at least). - Ecks\n\nNope...sorry[edit]\n\nSorry Random...there's nothing you can really do to delete it. What i might suggest however, is tag the page with a category of \"To be deleted\" or something, and then drop the admins a line, if you come across something like this in the future. -- Duke33\n\nI thought this would fit best here. Anyone know why there are these Chinese links each time I visit a song page like... James K. Polk (Dial-A-Song Anthology Version)? - Blitz\n\nI'm not exactly sure where to put this, but on the song ratings page, shouldn't it just be limited to bona-fide TMBG songs? It's kinda wierd to have the State Songs up there with Birdhouse and the like. - Drumstick\n\nA Mediawiki trick[edit]\n\nThe best way to sign comments in talk pages, etc, is by typing four tilde characters (~) in a row. These are replaced with a wiki-link to your talk page, and a timestamp of when you made the change. See? Veloso 11:40, 19 Nov 2004 (EST)\n\nTrue And Amazing Lyrics Documented[edit]\n\nI recorded an episode of The Travel Channel show, Amazing Vacation Homes, just to get the theme music. It's pretty good.\n\nLyrics:True And Amazing - True And Amazing - Mmnatas 16:50, 28 Nov 2004 (EST)\n\nVenue Songs Theme vs. Venue Songs Album[edit]\n\nI started trying to fix this ambiguity to add a Venue Songs album but chickened out. I'm not quite sure what the best way to handle this is, so I'm leaving it to those with more wiki mojo. Veloso 14:33, 10 Dec 2004 (EST)\n\nGeekier Instruments[edit]\n\nHas anyone ever considered having a page for piano/accordion chords/tabs intstead of just the usual guitar and bass?\n\nI'm not sure that that would work. That would be sheet music which can't be put up as text as far as I know. To upload files would be troublesome, I don't think there is any standard filetype. Some sheet music can be obtained through midi files, which are readily available on the internet. They tend to be roughly made, but piano/accordion parts can easily be extracted from them. -Augie 22:08, 19 Jan 2005 (EST)\n\nWe could just right the keys. Like A A A B G G G A, or something like that. I'm not sure, but I think we could make it work\n\nI don't think so. Maybe if there was a link to download a midi file on the main song pages. The problem is, the music would only be accesible to people with the right software. We could also upload images of sheet music, but that would not be editable. -Augie 19:05, 20 Jan 2005 (EST)\n\nUm, I don't think a separate page for piano chords is necessary. To tell the truth, our \"Guitar Tabs\" page is a heinous lie. There's maybe 10 actual guitar tablatures in that section. The rest are chord progressions, which are useful for any instrument. Rarely will you find extensive sheet music on a given band, without it either being the product of one prolific (and lifeless) devotee or a blatant copyright infringement of published material. And, as any musician who's looked for TMBG before knows, this barely exists for Them. For most people with halfway decent chops, most melodies included in a given song can be figured out using the chords as your starting point. -Charlie June 14, 2005\n\nDial A Song[edit]\n\nHas anybody else noticed that Dial A Song has been down for at least a month? What's up with that?\n\nYou know the motto...\n\n\"Always busy, often broken.\"\n\nR3D 13:44, 16 Oct 2005 (EDT)\n\nShows a song has been played at[edit]\n\nHow about a new page on each song page that lists each show the song has been played at? For example the TLA venue song would link to the TLA show in 2004 and 2006, etc. It would be handy to see how rarely a song is played live and the last time they played it. Just a thought.\n\nClick \"What links here\" on the bottom left of any song page. -CapitalQ ♫ talk ♪ 19:07, 20 Jun 2006 (MDT)\n\nNews RSS?[edit]\n\nI think it'd be nice to have the Current Events available as an RSS feed, too. Would this be a good idea? -Ecks\n\nSounds like a good idea to me. -CapitalQ ♫ talk ♪ 21:31, 31 Jan 2006 (EST)\n\nAny idea on how to do that? I don't know if there is a way in mediawiki to create an RSS feed for a single page. If someone can find out, let me know.--Duke33 22:06, 31 Jan 2006 (EST)\n\nHere. I dunno, good information is strangely scarce. -Ecks\n\nAccording to meta (a treasure trove of mediawiki info), there's no way to do it for a single page, at least for right now. If this is something we're really interested in, I could probably create one using PHP though. --Duke33 09:19, 1 Feb 2006 (EST)\n\nTry this - Link Removed . Please let me know how it looks...This is just a first stab, so if it's not working, i'm not surprised! --Duke33 23:04, 2 Feb 2006 (EST)\n\nWell, I don't have Firefox with me, but on Google's personalized home page, all of the titles came up as \"Current Events\". So while it worked, I vote to tweak it so that it shows some of the news. -Ecks\n\nOk, I have two solutions for you guys. First is Wotzwot. With Wotzwow, you point them to a webpage and pick out unique strings from the HTML source to mark where RSS items start and end. I played with it for a little while and came up with this. The genereator split up the items fine, but it did not detect the Titles from the Desctiption. Which makes for ugly RSS in the aggregator. So I did a little more searching and found a program called RSS Wizard. Which does the exact same thing as Wotzwot except it allows you to choose strings for the Title. The drawback though is you have to schedule the program to generate the RSS instead of it constantly updating online like Wotzwot. But RSS Wizard does have an option to upload the generated RSS file to an FTP server. Hope this helps you guys. Edit: I found another program that, with a quick glance, looks like RSS Wizard.

He talked about WikiNews for a little and some of the problems they have with RSS not being part of the MediaWiki code (which this is based on). What he said they do is do RSS through FeedBurner.com.

I am also dying to hear this. Please tell me what to do! mail@peterfritzen.dk\n\nRemix/Mashup category?[edit]\n\nI wonder if there should be a category for remixes and mashups (like, for instance, the incredibly dirty- yet hilarious- Lil Kim mashup linked to in the latest Flans e-mail). I think TMBG fans would be interested to hear fan-made remixes and mashups, and this page could list and perhaps link to them, as well as track offical remixes (by Joshua Fried, the Dust Brothers, etc.). The only problem is the legality of linking to these songs- although, judging from the amused response to the Lil Kim mix I don't think the Johns mind things like mashups. -Martorano\n\n--I agree, I have about a dozen different mashups/unauthorized remixes that I listen to on my TMBG playlist, right along with all the TMBG songs. there are some way cool ones, and some I don't know much about and about which I would like to know more, like one by Spencer Owen called TMBG Soundbite Collage. There are some TMBG sounds in there that I don't know from where they come. What do others think? We do have a page for covers of TMBG songs, maybe they could go there? We also have a Fans In Bands page that I think of as more of a comunity page, which are nice things to have that keep people coming here. Maybe if there enough people out there that use this wiki that make mixes or mashups of their own, we could have a page for that. I don't know what the legality is here or not, or what Operator Dot thinks. I know that we removed all of the TMBG mp3s, but we still have the Covers available for download. Is that okay? If it is, then mashups should be too. I was also thinking that I have seen alot of fan art out there. We don't do all that much with images (yet), but maybe we could build a fan art gallery page. I have also seen and made some tour maps of TMBG using Google maps. I think it could be cool to build a map/maps like this for TMBG here. Does anyone know if there are such things like map wikis? It could be cool to have a map that people could edit, especially one of New York City and all the places that reference TMBG with links to show pages, year pages, and so on. I have only been wikiing for a few months, but maybe some others here know if any of this could work or be helpful.

I hesitate to take this at face value. I'm thinking that the reporter may have heard someone ask them about doing a follow-up called that durring their publicity tour for the ABCs set and misunderstood. -Cronny\n\nActually, I was thinking the exact same thing, because this seems to be the only recorded place that says anything about this. I'm sure there would be something else about it somewhere, because it is spring already, after all. -INeedACrane\n\nSpring just started. I'm sure we'll start hearing more about it soon.

We don't like our Bush up here in the Pacific Northwest. Also, Call Connected Thru the NSA is pretty awesome, too.

Between this and hearing about them being jerks to a fan, I find it hard to listen to the music.\n\nDo you really want to open up this can of worms? Here is just a short list of complaints I have about the current administration: 1. The gradual reduction of freedoms in the name of \"preventing terrorism\". The truth is, none of us are really safer. 2. There have been accusations of trying to find the source of leaks (NSA story). Why would the government do this unless it had something to hide? 3. What people don't realise is that our government is supposed to be working for us, we appoint them to protect our best interests, and I feel the government is moving alarmingly quick to totalitarian mode. 4. The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer. This administration is in the back pocket of big businesses, so much so that the average American is well aware of and considers it normal. This is an atrocity. 5. I believe that George Bush has committed treason against his country, and continues to lie to us. The fact that he isn't behind bars for the death of thousands of soldiers troubles me. 6. As Benjamin Franklin said, \"Those who are willing to trade freedom for safety do not deserve either.\"\n\nAs soon as I have the required work experience, I'm moving to Canada. America is quickly moving toward a dictatorship. Did you hear about Bush talking about why his brother Jeb would be a good successor? Can you say \"monarchy\"?--tehbagel ( o ) 15:00, 19 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nI wonder if there are liberal Alan Jackson fans? Or liberal Toby Keith fans? Can you be a fan of Eminem and not be a homophobe? Can you like Bob Marley and not smoke pot? I think this is an interesting discussion. And tehbagel has only skimmed the surface of what is drastically wrong with the current administration. What about Katrina? What about the constitutional admendment banning gay marriage? The erosion of church and state, the castration of life-saving scientific research involving stem cells? I hope that there are a lot of non-Americans on this wiki, because I want you guys to know a lot of people in this country feel the same way about Dubya that you do. I'm not a fan of the Democrats, either (I'm a Libertarian), but if we don't start seeing the tide change a little bit I'm going to write my own protest album. -Martorano\n\nI don't want to get into trouble on here, because like everyone else here, I love TMBG, so I don't want to make enemies. But could someone explain to me (briefly) exactly how they think the separation of church and state is being messed up? Also, George W. Bush is a conservative, so you have to expect him to support conservative political policies--like banning gay marriage and stopping stem cell research. So saying that his support of these policies are examples of what's \"drastically wrong with the current administration\" is like me saying that support of legalized abortion is an example of what was \"drastically wrong with former administrations.\" Sure, that may be my opinion, but supporting abortion is a liberal policy, so it should be expected of liberal administrations. So while someone may think that Bush's conservative policies are examples of things wrong with the world, that's just that person's opinion. And as much as someone may hate those policies, there are a lot of people who support them, and Bush's support of them shouldn't come to anyone as some kind of outrageously unexpected surprise. Some of the other points brought up above may seem a bit more grey, but does everyone at least see my point?\n\nSo with that said, I have to now second the idea that this is a can of worms we may not want to spend too much time on. Some people love Bush and some people hate him. But we all love TMBG, so let's focus on that (though you can still answer my question about \"the erosion of church and state\"). Also, I'd be pretty surprised if the Johns really ever treated fans like jerks just because the fans were conservatives. (Assuming the fans didn't start some kind of fight themselves . . .) ~Drew\n\nPS: I get the point of the quote, but it's probably not a Franklin quote, and it's also a misquote. For more on that, go here\n\nDrew, the erosion of the seperation of church and state is pretty evident. The president has changed regulations preventing faith-based groups from recieving federal funding- in fact, 2.1 billion dollars were awarded to faith-based groups last year alone, which is about 11% of federal money awarded to community groups. The whole gay marriage ban is based upon the Biblical theory of homosexuality as an abomination, and the religious tradition of marriage being between a man and a woman. George Bush means to alter our Constitution based on a religious principle, and I find this supremely troubling. You make some good points about Bush's policies being conservative policies, and I guess some of them are a matter of opinion, but discrimination and human progress shouldn't be liberal or conservative issues. By discrimination I mean the denial of rights to certain Americans- in this instance, gays, who can now join the ranks of Native Americans, African-Americans and women who have been afforded less rights than the majority. Once, women weren't allowed to vote or own land, and now gay people can't marry or adopt a child. To me, this is clearly discrimination, and anyone who supports discrimination is always in the wrong. And when I talk about human progress I of course mean stem cell research, which scientists estimate could save millions of lives, drastically increase our lifespans, and virtually eliminate many common bodily ailments. I understand that this site probably isn't the best forum to openly and freely discuss these issues, but it was brought up, so I'm merely stating what I (and, apparently, a lot of TMBG fans) believe. -Martorano\n\nExactly. The argument that conservatives give for being against stem cell research basically boils down to \"we shouldn't have to sacrifice the innocent lives of the few for the good of the many\", even though it is debatable how \"alive\" fetuses are. However, isn't what we are doing in Iraq, sacrificing the lives of innocent troops in order to set up some kind of government, the same thing? There is a level of hypocracy in Government that makes me red in the face. Listen: I am ALL FOR you being against abortion. I don't care if you think it's \"right\" or \"wrong\", but don't push your beliefs upon others by making them law. If you don't like abortion, fine, don't be involved in them, but why should your beliefs be law to anybody? Why do conservatives feel the need to force their opinions and beliefs (especially ones that are backed up by, \"God says ______ is wrong/right\") upon the masses? How religion can EVER be used as an argument in any kind of debate appalls me. Just because of the fact that one may think homosexuality is wrong, doesn't mean they can discriminate against gays. They are people and deserve the rights guarenteed to them by the constitution. I guess that's my libertarian streak showing. The founding fathers were very afraid of government doing exactly what it is doing right now, and it's why they wrote in the Second Amendment, the right to form a militia (the whole point of bearing arms) so the government has to fear the people. It is every true patriot's duty to question the government at every step, and fix what is broken.--tehbagel ( o ) 10:33, 20 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nI'm not sure if some of you guys really understand the purpose of the separation of church and state. When it was created, it had to do mainly with preventing what has happened so often in Europe and other areas of the world in the past--one religion gaining control of a nation and persecuting or outlawing all other religions, etc. It had nothing to do with federal funding to faith-based (or non-faith-based) community groups, etc. It also had nothing to do with protecting the \"right\" of atheists to not have any exposure to religious material in puplic places, schools, etc.--an argument often used recently by those who think that all traces of religion should be erased from public life and that every religious person is some kind of crazed fanatic. But I'm going to leave the rest of these issues alone to avoid contention and anger on the wiki, other than to point out that enough people agree with Bush and traditional, conservative Judeo-Christian values for Bush and others like him to get elected. As someone said above, \"our government is supposed to be working for us,\" so you can't blame a conservative official for supporting the conservative policies of the millions of conservative people that elected him or her, whether or not you agree with them. So liberals have to remember that the liberal beliefs and opinions they might have are not as \"self-evident\" or unquestionably \"correct\" as they may think, since about half of the nation seems to disagree with them. And, of course, the reverse side of that is true as well--about half of the nation disagrees with conservatives. ~Drew\n\nDrew, you make a good point about the origin of the church/state seperation in the United States. However, and this is something of a cliche, how would a Christian feel if Vishnu or Allah were represented on the currency, or in the Pledge, or uttered by the President following the State of the Union address? How would a Catholic feel having to swear upon the Koran or even \"Dianetics\"? (That was a lame joke, sorry.) The seperation of church and state is to protect everybody, so that, like you said, no one religion gains too much control, which is unfortunately what we're seeing in the current political climate. The religious right has a lot of sway in our country, and are constantly pandered to by conservatives for fear of losing their votes. You point out that there are a lot of people that agree with Bush, and that's true, but a lot of people agreed that the world was flat. A lot of people packed the Roman colosseums to watch Christians being fed to lions. A lot of people owned slaves. Just because something is popular does not in any way make it right. --Martorano\n\nSimilarly, the fact that gay marriage and other such issues are popular among many people now does not make them right. That argument goes both ways. ~Drew\n\nYes, it does, but in the case of gay marriage I'd argue that anyone not in favor of it perhaps needs a bit of a history lesson. Like I said, this country has a very sad history of denying rights to certain sectors of its population- women, African-Americans and other minorities. Interracial marriage was illegal until 1967. Not to mention slavery or segregation, or forcing Native Americans onto reservations. Or Asian-Americans into internment camps. I'm certainly not going to compare slavery to the proposed ban on gay marriage, but how is denying a gay couple the right to get married any different than not allowing an African-American the right to vote? Or would you have that right stripped away? I know that was a low blow, but it's a question that has to be asked: if you support certain people having more rights than others based on who they are, what's to say you're not opposed to allowing only white Christian males to vote? Or own land? --Martorano\n\nWhile I don't agree with any of the types of discrimination you mention from America's past (which, in reality, isn't any sadder than anyone else's past, since large portions of the world still had the same types of discrimination when we did, and some still do NOW), I don't think banning gay marriage is discrimination because, among other reasons, I think marriage, by definition, has to involve a member of each sex. And a lot of Americans (among others) agree with me, as I've mentioned and as many recent elections prove. Slaves were denied freedom, while others had freedom. Blacks were denied the right to vote, while others had that right. But gays are denied gay marriage, as is everyone else. There's no difference between \"white freedom\" and \"black freedom\" or between \"white voting\" and \"black voting.\" But there is, in my opinion, a fundamental difference between traditional marriage and gay marriage, as much as people now are trying to \"redefine marriage\" (hence the re- in the phrase). So I guess I'll have to use a couple cliches and say that this is neither the time nor the place for this discussion, so we'll just have to agree to disagree. ~Drew\n\nIf I may, though: you say that marriage has to, by definition, involve a member of each sex. I wonder what you base that on? Religion? Tradition? I'm not trying to be hostile, I'm honestly curious. By the way, even though we obviously disagree, thank you for being clear, concise, and respectful- so many times it's easy to resort to childish name-calling and finger-wagging, and I admire someone who can stand up for what they believe in in a mature fashion. --Martorano\n\nMarriage is a religious observance, hence the wedding. Marriage was created by and for religion. If homosexual couples feel they must share the same benefits as a marriage, almost all states offer civil unions.\n\nTo Drew: Oops! I think I should have been more clear. The Johns weren't (supposedly) mean beacause the fans were conservative. They were just all around (supposedly) unfriendly. JUST SO EVERYONE KNOWS, I AM NOT SAYING I BELIEVE THEY WERE JERKS. I DO NOT MEAN TO SPREAD RUMORS. I JUST READ IT ON TOONZONE FROM SOMEONE WHO I FIND TO BE RELIABLE. I DO LIKE TMBG! I'LL STOP TALKING IN CAPS... now. To Martorano: While my opinion on gay marriage is different than yours, I respect your respect for Drew's respect for your opinion.\n\nI, too, am thankful for how respectful this conversation has been all around. Internet discussions about politics can be notoriously hateful, childish, and disrespectful, so I'm glad this one has been anything but. My beliefs on gay marriage are personal beliefs that are largely faith-based. \"Tradition\" strikes me as the wrong word, because I've seen what blind tradition can do to people. You've seen it--the person who can only explain his or her religious beliefs by saying, \"I'm ________ (insert any given religious denomination here) because my parents are/were _________. It's a tradition.\" Or some variation thereof. Informed, personal religious beliefs would be a better term for my beliefs. Also, in large part I agree with the comment above that \"Marriage is a religious observance, hence the wedding. Marriage was created by and for religion.\" And, if you're not against dragging out this conversation, Martoano, I think it would be only fair if you explained the origins of your beliefs a bit. I'd be interested to hear what you have to say.\n\nI also appreciate the above explanation/clarification about the Johns being \"jerks\" from the unnamed creator of this thread. And, again, I appreciate the respectful discussion from Martorano and everyone else involved here. ~Drew\n\nThere is a personal reason I feel very strongly about this particular issue. I worked for about a year with a man in his sixties, a gay man who has been with the same partner for about forty years. Forty years! And they aren't allowed to marry, yet any heterosexual couple can go and get a quickie marriage from a drive-thru in Las Vegas. So that's why gay marriage kind of hits close to home for me. But, Drew, I think you're right: we should agree to disagree. --Martorano\n\nIt's agreed, then! :) Thanks for all of your comments. (Oh, and I'll try to briefly address everything below later.) ~Drew\n\nI must put my two cents in: Drew, your statement that marriage is by religion for religion is grossly wrong. The word marriage was never used in religion until the goverment coined the phrase. The word that religion used for marriage was a hebrew word meaning \"ownership\", in that the man traditionally owned his woman; she was property. I don't recall the word right now, but I could get you the word tomorrow in my Bible As Literature class. Anyway, if you think marriage is just between a man and a woman, then don't be involved in same sex marriages. How does two gay men being married hurt you exactly? I don't understand why religious beliefs are being made into law that all have to follow. As Stephen Colbert greatly summed up a stab at the neo-cons, \"I accept all, be you Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Hindu or Buddhist, no matter which path you choose to accepting Jesus Christ as your personal savior.\"--tehbagel ( o ) 14:25, 21 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nI'm not touching the political debate, but I'm rather curious about what you heard \"about them being jerks to a fan.\" What did they do exactly that was so terrible? I've had nothing but positive experiences when I've had the opportunity to interact with them, and I think the vast majority of fans would say likewise. — aliste 23:53, 19 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nDrew: http://forums.toonzone.net/showthread.php?t=166729 Read Zubby's post for even more clarification.

But if the guy's source is correct, they may just be waiting until the album comes out to release the Beardo live shows. -Cronny\n\nThe guy had no source other than the fact that the theymightbegiants.com shows page lists \"Not available\" for the Beardo shows. Someone might've wrote that instead of \"Coming soon\"... -CapitalQ ♫ talk ♪ 14:12, 4 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nMaybe it was an insider... or not... -Cronny\n\nHee, I made the front page! I feel so special. —aliste\n\nI certainly hope TMBG eventually releases the downloads from this tour. It would be a waste of a new digital mixer to keep the shows under wraps. And besides, they released shows that contained performances of songs from \"Here Come the A-B-C's\" before it had been released. -Reynoldbot\n\nSeriously, it seems like goofy logic to hold them. I don't think anyone's going to say, \"I've got live recordings of two tracks from the new album. I guess I won't buy it.\" Similarly, people likely would buy the downloads to get a couple tracks early. -Buschap\n\nIt may sound like goofy logic, but maybe the Johns noticed that a common complaint by reviewers about Mink Car was that so many of the songs on the album had already been available in other forms and on other releases, etc. Similarly, if you look at the \"What songs do you hope will be on Their next album\" section of the TMBG's Mysterious Next Album page, you'll notice that several people have put or supported things like \"something new\" or \"something we've never heard before,\" etc. The Johns seem to be quite aware of their fans--and their reviewers, I'm sure--so they're probably just trying to learn from their past experiences. ~Drew\n\nThere could be a legal reason behind it.. remember, They don't even list the titles of the ABCs songs on their download page in shows that occured before the album came out.. maybe this time out, They can't even give us the live music. -TDK 06:10, 10 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nI'm really disappointed about this... especially for all the US Servicemembers overseas who are unable to enjoy this year's tour through the live downloads. I hope that that doesn't mean that this tour will be lost forever, and that they can release it when their new album is out. -jesseg\n\nKoL references[edit]\n\nI just fixed one but I'm not eager to do them all. I'm not even sure if you want them on the wiki. If you do, however, and anyone wants fill them in, here's a comprehensive list and table of TMBG references in Kingdom Of Loathing: http://pop.shinketsu.net/search.php?seek=giants - Whirrrlwind (Woosh!) 09:15, 6 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nMusicVid Announcement[edit]\n\nI realize it's innapropriate to post a news item about a fan-vid, but would anyone be offended if I announced it here? This is more of an open forum, so I think it would be okay, but I'd like to know what you think before I do it. -Cronny\n\nTheres been huge debates over whether fan vids should be allowed to be posted on the main page, or even on the specific song page. Im pretty sure that no one will be offended if you write it on this Talk page, but as far as I know the arguement favours that fan-made vids dont get mentioned on the Front Main Page. To read up on the arguement: Talk:Videos --AnklePants 22:07, 16 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nThanks, I was actually part of that discussion, but we never really touched upon the talk pages. Anyway, here's the link: http://newgrounds.com/portal/view/313104 if anyone gets mad I can blame you ;) -Cronny\n\nDeal--AnklePants 06:17, 17 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nGreat video :) - repugnant\n\nUser locations[edit]\n\nI was just wondering how far (gloabally speaking) TMBW users span. Maybe this could become a misc page. Please discuss. I was specific wondering if I am the sole user who is representing the entire continent of Oceania (what a responsability!)--AnklePants 06:25, 17 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nMaybe \"Location\" could be one of the babel boxes for the user pages. -Martorano\n\nThats a good idea, coz then it doesnt have to specific, it can be rather general, such as American states or countries outside the US. I have no idea how to make babel boxes though. If anyone else is interested and know how...--AnklePants 08:07, 17 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nI could get started on those tomorrow. Leave me a list of places on my talk page. Alternatively, I could set up a Frappr map. — User:ACupOfCoffee@ 03:34, 21 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nNo Frappr. Another Wiki I know of does that and I hate it, since you have to give city too (right?) Personally I vote Babel boxes, ones for all 50 American states, the Canadian provinces, and then other countries. (Well, you know, other countries you'd -expect- to access a TMBG Wiki, and then if someone from say Slovenia comes up here and asks for a Babel box we can make him one.) I can help. - Doug the Aquacell Guy 10:07, 26 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nWhat, you don't expect someone from Slovenia to like TMBG? That's rude! (P.S. Slovenia is a country right? It sounds like something from The Lord of the Rings). --Martorano 12:59, 26 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nYep. It's actually a new country that came out of the end of the Cold War. Actually, quite a few people over there may like the band. It's quite a bit better off than most other new (1990+) nations. (If Lord of the Rings took place on October 11th, Gandalf would've had THEY printed on his forehead. They're popular there too.) - Doug the Aquacell Guy 21:05, 26 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nOr we could just type in what ever place we're from, like we would type in what ever our username is for one of the Wiki babel boxes. --Droffats 21:08, 26 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nA Poll Question, Sort Of[edit]\n\nI'm curious to see people's answers... a lot of unreleased TMBG songs are only circulating in really bad quality. Which one of these songs would you like to hear in prime quality?\n\nI vote for \"What Is Everyone Staring At?\" Even in its early form, 'Sleepwalkers' had the making of a great tune.\n\nI'd say either What Is Everyone Staring At, or maybe The Bloodboat. They both would've sounded great, and they still do, even if they're low quality. ~ magbatz\n\nHow about No Answer? Or--though I know it'll never happen--the adult version of Four Of Two? ~Drew\n\nHow could I have forgotten No Answer? That definitely trumps my other two favorites. And although I prefer the suicide version of Four Of Two, the No! one satisfies all my broken clock needs.\n\nI have the pretty bad quality of No Answer on my mp3 player, and I absolutely love that song. =) I would love to have a nice quality version (or studio!) of that. --Lemita 11:27, 20 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nI'd also like to hear studio versions of Coffee Table Of Love, A TMBG Song, Hi, Live Like Pigs, Reminder, Side 2, Welcome To The World, The Sun Is On Fire, The Writing's On The Wall, We Love All The People, and Titanic Fog. Then again, I'd also just like to hear the Dial-A-Song versions of those songs. Anybody have them? :)\n\nTake a sneak peek to this page: Talk:Power Of Dial-A-Song. Our dearest fellow Liam uploaded some of these songs. - Whirrrlwind (Woosh!) 05:12, 21 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nCOOLNESS! Thanks! :) That's a really cool Web site. Whenever I finally find a job and therefore have more (guiltless) free time, I'll have to post some of the rare stuff I have. BTW, Whirlwind, any more links like that on random pages/talk pages on here? ~Drew\n\nNone that I know of. - Whirrrlwind (Woosh!) 06:34, 21 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nOkay, okay--that wasn't really on topic. But really, would anybody else love to hear an album version of I'm Your Boyfriend Now, Kids Are Different Now, or Kings Of The Cave? Maybe even Sally Boy Candy Bar? (And you can still answer my question about having those DAS songs above . . .) ~Drew\n\nTumbleweed. -TDK 07:53, 21 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nI'm going to have to say \"No Answer\", too. Awesome song. --Martorano\n\nI'm Your Boyfriend Now, Kids Are Different Now, and Sally Boy Candy Bar. Three of my favoritest songs. And I only have them in crappy 32kbps quality. --Valerie 17:35, 23 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nKids Are Different Now always sounded way too...pop-punk for me. Does that makes sense? It sounds like Sum 41 or something. --Martorano\n\nIt's mimicking the style of 1994 (Dookie-era) Green Day. -CapitalQ ♫ talk ♪ 18:58, 23 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nThat's always been one of my favorite things about TMBG--they can write songs in so many different musical styles! ~Drew\n\nWilliam Allen White's head[edit]\n\nOkay, so TMBG used it in a few concerts and video projects. It was always put in a context of other surreal and bizarre imagery. When I come here, I have to stare at that fuckin' head everywhere: as a background, site icon, everywhere. Even if the guy's supposed to be a mascot, that picture is way too ubiquitous. Where's the diversity of strange imagery that is the visual hallmark of TMBG? Why do you ONLY use that guy's head? TMBG's website is delightfully odd. This one is just... creepy and disturbing. 66.90.73.96 01:46, 24 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nI would just like to note that User:Drew took it upon himself to censor the above comment, but did not feel it necessary to admit doing so or post attribution for the change. The word censored was the evil \"f-word,\" you know, like the one in the TMBG concert favourite \"Sorry I Fucked Up The Show\". Thankfully, User:Drew has not yet seen fit to reprimand the Johns themselves for their horrible, horrible use of such vulgarity. Next time you see fit to alter someone else's comments, User:Drew, at least have the cojones to follow-up and admit what you've done. Puritans are supposed to be forthright, not cowardly. 66.90.73.96 06:06, 24 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nSo who went back and uncensored it? - Doug the Aquacell Guy 09:47, 24 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nChecking the page's history or looking at the Recent changes would show you that the original poster put it back. -CapitalQ ♫ talk ♪ 14:27, 24 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nIt would, but, that would involve actual effort ;) - Doug the Aquacell Guy 17:41, 24 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nIf you consider three or four clicks effort. :D -CapitalQ ♫ talk ♪ 18:38, 24 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nIf you don't like the logo, you can always change your skin under your preferences. --Duke33 07:41, 24 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nI like the WAW head. Just my two cents. --Martorano 08:06, 24 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nAgreed. Black-and-white 40's/50's heads are just wonderful. - Doug the Aquacell Guy 09:47, 24 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nThe picture was most likely taken during the 30's actually, judging by William Allen White's age in the image and the fact that he died in 1944. -CapitalQ ♫ talk ♪ 14:27, 24 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nI'm sorry if I offended anyone, but I felt no need to mark a change like that, given the ease with which the source of the change could be found by checking the page's history or using the Recent Changes page and the fact that I wasn't adding a comment myself. You'll also note a little warning/disclaimer at the bottom of the page every time you edit or add to a page, which goes like this: \"Please note that all contributions to This Might Be A Wiki may be edited, altered, or removed by other contributors. If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly, then don't submit it here.\" People edit the spelling, phrasing, grammar, and other content of my posts all the time, and I make minor changes (especially spelling) to others' posts as well. And given the fact that lots of kids like TMBG (like I did as a kid, though I didn't know them well), I just try to keep a public forum like this as free as possible from needless profanity. So sue me. I do, however, draw the line at changing the names of songs that I had nothing to do with the writing of. Just curious, but does anyone else have an opinion on this matter? I'm open to feedback. ~Drew\n\nEditing someone else's work on an article and changing their signed comments on a talk page do not seem to fall into the same category. As far as \"kids\" and profanity are concerned, if it's not used to abuse or demean other posters I don't see the problem. They're just words, right? As a \"kid\" I read Mark Twain, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Heinlein, Salinger... all sorts of profane literature. Somehow I managed not to sprout horns and cloven hooves...\n\nI personally don't see much wrong with swearing (well, with the exception of a few words, the f-bomb not being one) some people do, and it's best just to respect their wishes and keep the actual TMBW.net content clean. However, songs, song titles, shows, et cetera...keep them as they are. Puppets gonna screw you up =D - Doug the Aquacell Guy 14:37, 25 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nCommission Junction[edit]\n\nI noticed in the latest news post has a redirect-thingy in the front of the address. And that when Ecks attempted to get rid of it, it was reverted. Could you tell us what this is, Duke33? Doing a little research on it leads me to believe it's some sort of advertising technique. --Droffats 14:24, 26 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nYes - We have an affiliate program with eMusic, Napster, iTunes, Amazon, and other sites...We get paid for people that click through to emusic and then open up a subscription with them. So, i try to make sure that all emusic links on the site go through our affiliate program, in case someone clicks through and then signs up. --Duke33 14:27, 26 May 2006 (CDT)\n\nHeh. My dad used to be the CFO of Commission Junction. I'd never actually seen them in action before.--Salt-Man Z 19:39, 14 August 2006 (UTC)\n\nRandom page[edit]\n\nWhat about making the Lyrics, Chronology and Interpretations namespaces accessible for the Random page function? Is that possible at all? - Whirrrlwind (Woosh!) 10:39, 3 Jun 2006 (CDT)\n\nPage Idea[edit]\n\nWOuld anybody mind if I created a page \"Tab Squad\" where users who regularly create guitar tabs. It would contain a sign up sheet for regular contributators as well as a count of how many tabs they've created and then a list of songs that still need tabs and tabs that users think need improvement. Does this sound good? Can I go ahead and make it? -AtionSong 12:28, 3 Jun 2006 (CDT)\n\nSounds fine to me. :) -CapitalQ ♫ talk ♪ 13:00, 3 Jun 2006 (CDT)\n\nAn Idea...[edit]\n\nHOw come there isn't a \"related songs\" area in each music page? I think it would be helpful if you found your way to a live version of a song, when you wanted the album recording. Sorry if this is already somewhere and I missed it.--71.240.7.23 15:10, 4 Jun 2006 (CDT)\n\nYou were right but you don't have to be sorry for that. It's the chronology page for each song. - Whirrrlwind (Woosh!) 15:21, 4 Jun 2006 (CDT)\n\nOh, thanks. I really should have searched thoroughly before I asked.\n\nIt's not really a matter of searching, there's a Chronology link on the bottom right of every song page. :) -CapitalQ ♫ talk ♪ 16:43, 4 Jun 2006 (CDT)\n\nI have no idea what to title this...[edit]\n\nWell, a problem I've been seeing is things like Your Own Worst Enemy (Demo)'s song name is \"Your Own Worst Enemy (Demo)\", but the song's name is Your Own Worst Enemy, Your Own Worst Enemy (Demo). So, I guess I think we should just take off the \"(Demo)\" part out of song names, and stuff like that, because it's not the song's name, I guess. I could be totally wrong about this, but that's what I think and if there is a specific reason why the demo portion of the song name is totally intelligent and isn't really retarded, just explain it to me. --liam 09:20, 22 Jun 2006 (MDT)"
