It was founded in 2008 by early employees of BitTorrent, including Samba TV's current chief executive officer, Ashwin Navin.[1] The company develops software for televisions, set-top boxes, smart phones and tablets to enable interactive television through personalization. Through its portfolio of applications and TV platform technologies, Samba TV is built directly into the TV or set-top box and will recognize onscreen content—live or time-shifted—and make relevant information available to users at their request.\n\nThe service is available only after a user activates it on a device, and is supported by interest-based advertising delivered on the television or on devices within the household. Through APIs and SDKs for mobile application software developers, Samba TV is usable on a second screen or the TV itself. Samba TV has a global addressable footprint of 46 million devices globally, 28 million of which are in the United States.[2] Its devices are distributed in roughly 118 countries.[3]\n\nThe company has raised over $40 million in capital from Disney, Time Warner, August Capital, Interpublic Group, Liberty Global, Stagwell, A+E Networks as well as individuals like Mark Cuban, Kun Gao, founder of Crunchyroll, James Hong, founder of Hot or Not, Charles Huang, founder of Guitar Hero, angel investor Tom McInerney, and others.[4][5]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe company was founded as Flingo in 2008, to help media companies like Showtime, Fox, A+E Networks, TMZ, Revision3, PBS and CBS develop apps on Smart TVs that synchronize with linear broadcast programming and non-linear media.[6] In January 2012, Samba TV launched one-click sharing on social networks like Facebook and Twitter from the television.[7] In January 2013, the company announced further developments and features and named its interactive TV platform Samba.[8]\n\nAcquisitions\n\n[edit]\n\nIn September 2013, the company adopted the Samba TV name.[9]\n\nIn October 2017, The Walt Disney Company became a strategic investor in Samba TV to better understand TV viewership and engagement with advertising.[10][11]\n\nIn December 2018, Samba TV acquired Screen6,[12] a firm offering real-time, cross-device identity resolutions.\n\nIn August 2019, Samba TV acquired Wove,[13] to help direct-to-consumer brands TV ad targeting.\n\nIn August 2019, Samba TV acquired, Axwave, an international software development company.\n\nPartnerships\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2016, Samba TV partnered with MediaMath.[14]\n\nIn 2017, Samba TV partnered with video ad serving platform SpotX[15] and media/advertising research company Kantar.[16]\n\nIn 2019, Samba TV partnered with Twitter to help measure the social network's effectiveness in driving tune-in.[17] That same year, Samba TV also partnered with video streaming aggregator Reelgood.[18]\n\nIn 2020, Samba TV partnered with global programmatic media partner MiQ, [19] global technology company The Trade Desk,[20] media measurement and analytics company Comscore,[21] as well as Amazon Web Services.[22] and TiVo.[23] That same year, Samba TV also partnered with point-of-sale data provider Catalina and paper product manufacturer Georgia-Pacific to measure cross-channel media spend.[24]\n\nIn 2021, Samba TV partnered with online advertising software company Pubmatic,[25] as well as television measurement and analytics company 605.[26]\n\nIn 2024, Samba TV partnered with Snap Inc.[27] to help brands further understand the value of advertising on Snapchat.\n\nProducts\n\n[edit]\n\nIn July 2021, Samba TV launched its global Real-time TV Viewership Dashboard, an interactive TV analytics dashboard featuring geographic and demographic analysis of viewership in real-time across the world, starting with four of the largest media markets: the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Australia.[28]\n\nAlso in 2021, Samba TV announced its proprietary identifier, SambaID,[29] as part of its Samba TV Identity solution, giving marketers, publishers and platforms the ability to transact with each other using a variety of different currencies to optimize against.
