        "text": "Steve: They've set up a large block of IPs specifically to monitor the behavior of worms and viruses and things. And as we remember from talking about tarpitting, what a tarpit is, is Conficker sent out a connection-opening SYN packet, and the responding server or service sent back an acknowledgment saying, yeah, I'd be happy to accept your connection. But, oh, I don't have any available buffer space. So hold on a second. And what that does is that shuts down the connection, but prevents it from timing out. And so for days now an increasing number of connections which my little copy of Conficker has sent out have stumbled into tarpits. There's actually two different ranges that I've seen that have grabbed those connections and never let go of them.\n\nSo, now, again, the author is so responsive that, if this became commonplace, we know that he'd update the payload. And it's easy to disconnect those connections. All you have to do is look at how long they've been open versus how much data has been transferred. And if that falls below a certain threshold, you abortively disconnect a TCP connection, which can be done easily enough. But that hasn't happened at this point.\n\nSo anyway, next week we're going to talk all about Conficker, and I'll basically give a complete technical explanation. Okay, I mean, it's got many different things it's doing. It's probing my local network for any other machines on the LAN by sending out ARP queries, looking for IPs, so we can talk about that. It's very patiently sending out UDP packets scattered all over the Internet, but carefully avoiding a bunch of Class A networks that it knows it shouldn't waste its time on. It's just doing all kinds of things. So it'll be fun to talk about what I've seen and what the whole industry has seen.\n\nSteve: Yes, exactly. It's a bad thing. I mean, it's causing all kinds of concern. And it's obviously very effective at infecting and holding onto machines that it commandeers, which in no way am I condoning this behavior. But I respect its authorship. So, yes.\n\nSo here we are, a couple days from the second Tuesday of April, where we had the standard big monthly update - five critical vulnerabilities, two that were important, and one that was moderate, so a total of eight patches from Microsoft on Patch Tuesday. Everyone needs to do this sooner or later. There were a couple bad ones where there were problems found in the HTTPS protocol on the client side, meaning that if you were induced to - you, a Windows user, were induced to going to a malicious secure website, you could have a remote code exploit against your machine based on the certificate, the security certificate that has been exchanged.\n\nSo it's an interesting type of exploit we haven't seen before, I mean, in these details. But fundamentally it's the standard math problem buffer overflow, integer overflow type problem. But it's something you definitely want to get your machine patched against because, just as we've seen with Conficker, where back in October this was fixed, a bunch of machines haven't been patched. We've got some interesting Q&A about that also. And speaking of SSL, many people are wondering, I mean, I'm reading in their feedback, hey, Steve, whatever happened to the SSL protocol podcast that you promised? And my answer is, it's coming. But this is Security Now!, and so I'm giving priority to things that are newsy and happening now, like Conficker, for example, which is happening now. The SSL protocol, well, that's, you know, something I want to talk about, but it's static technology that we will get to, I mean, literally as soon as something doesn't preempt us with something that is now.\n\nSteve: It's not going anywhere. Also, for anyone using VMware, there was the first major set of security updates in quite a while for VMware Workstation, both for Linux and for Windows, VMware Server and Player, ESX, ESXi, and ACE. So I was on 6.5.0, that is, Workstation for Windows. Anyone using VMware needs to go over to VMware and make sure they're current. If they haven't updated for a while, you're going to want to because there were some interesting exploits. And in fact one is interesting enough that I've got it queued up for a podcast soon because there are some problems with VMware which have been discovered. And they're not fundamental problems with virtual machines. But as always, if mistakes are made in virtual machine implementation, and those are found, they can be leveraged. So I don't regard it as a huge, glaring problem like we have if a Windows user goes to a malicious website because certainly the cross-section of VMware users is much smaller than all Windows users. On the other hand, many people are using VMware specifically for the security encapsulation it provides. And in this case it's not. So you want to make sure you update VMware Workstation.\n\nAlso, many people wrote to tell me, if I didn't already know, and I do, something that I wanted to share anyway. And that is that Phorm, the evil, behind-your-back, intercepting your web connections, and loading your machine with cookies in order to track you technology, which was surreptitiously tested by BT over in the UK, it was on its way back. There was some news about Phorm returning. And the European Commission, the EC, has decided, eh, not so fast. We're going to initiate legal proceedings against British Telecom because we feel that their prior tests, which were undisclosed, involving Phorm violated privacy rights, which are well understood and established. Phorm is saying, we did nothing wrong. Both we and BT consulted our legal counsel before executing these tests, and we think we're going to be fine. Anyway, the EC says, eh, we're not so sure, let's put this to the test. So basically the problem was there was non-consent, there were non-consent complaints raised, and the EC is going to look at those and say, well, we agree that there's a problem with consent, which was not clearly given before.\n\nThe other interesting change we're seeing, sort of in the security landscape, aside from of course Conficker's happening, is something we've talked about but never really addressed directly. But one of my favorite security columnists, Brian Krebs, who I've referred to frequently here, who writes a security column for the Washington Post, talked about how one of the newest sort of latest changes is this notion of scareware, which is causing people to visit bogus AV sites and install and register bogus AV software. What's happening is that referral fees turn out to generate tens and in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars per month for anyone who is able to get people to visit and install this basically bogus AV software.\n\nSo essentially what's happened is viruses happened. The AV industry then responded. Then awareness was raised so that everyone who's using PCs now is aware of the virus problem, and we've worked on educating people about how to avoid being taken over by viruses. And then almost, in retrospect, almost obviously, what's then happened is fake antivirus tools and warnings and so forth have occurred. So people are now being confronted with pop-ups, for example, that say this system is acting like it has a virus, please check to see, you know, click this link to have your system scanned. So that will install something which then beats on them to register until they finally do. And affiliation fees are, like, on the order of 50 percent in these cases. So there's a strong incentive for the people who want these affiliate fees to do whatever they can to generate the scareware warning because there's real money in it now. So unfortunately we know that, where there's strong economic motivation, those things tend to happen more than when there isn't. And now we have that for this kind of - sort of this new class of scareware.\n\nSteve: We've been bent so far away from what is reasonable. And we've gone kicking and screaming, one insult after another after another. Old-school people, when this whole auto update started, said oh my goodness, no, I want control of this, I'm going to decide what goes in my computer or not. And now, I mean, and IT got pissed off because they were sending updates all over the place, and they began lumping them up in groups. And, I mean, where we are is ridiculous.\n\nNow, I take my hat off to Microsoft. I salute them for somehow managing to keep this massive Hindenburg called Windows aloft as long as they have. I mean, it is becoming unbelievably cumbersome and burdensome, even for Microsoft to understand their own creation. And it's a consequence of evolution. Again, they're still running programs from the early '80s and carrying all of that technology forward, which is not an easy thing to do. And they're only slowly removing those old features from their newer systems. And we talked about, for example, the eventual loss of 16-bit Windows support. So, I mean, I understand that this is not an easy thing for them to do. But where we are today is just - it's an atrocity. It's just - it's ridiculous.\n\nAnd then, for example, you mentioned last week, Leo, that the electrical power grid of this country has been taken over, and essentially there's spyware that's been installed, apparently, the news reports say, by China and Russia. I haven't reported much on that here because not much is known, I mean, not much is known publicly. I'm sure that our intelligence community has much better information about that. But again, what you find when you look is that these systems are running Windows. Somebody built some nuclear reactor control system on top of Windows. Which is just like, oh, my goodness. It's inexcusable.\n\nSo when I read this posting I just thought, okay, wait, time out. Let's have a little reality check about what it is that we're all dealing with and how ridiculous this is. I mean, this is ridiculous. But it's what we've got. And so that's what we're using.\n\nSteve: I've continued to study computer instruction set architectures for the last few months. And actually I'm finding myself feeling really interested in the PowerPC, which I think was a really spectacular piece of work. And it's sad that we've seen its arc sort of diminish, as it has over time. But Intel is where they are today because they're still supporting an instruction set that basically still runs 8080 or 8008 instructions and have dragged it all forward. If they were to start from scratch today, they could design a spectacular chip, because they know how, which would be far more powerful and require much less energy, much less heat, much less drive space. It would be much less expensive. They're paying an awful price for their backward compatibility several decades back.\n\nBut we use the Intel chip because of the compatibility. I mean, that's the benefit for us. And just as we do with Windows, for its compatibility, the fact that it runs - anything it ever ran, it still runs today, while Microsoft attempts to bring new technology into it. I mean, we grumble about all this .NET stuff that's having to be loaded now. Well, that's like the next, the next way of talking to Windows, the next API layer, while they're still supporting the old ones. So, I mean, I really do see that, too, Leo. But I just - this note sort of said, wait a minute, let's understand how bad the situation has become. And some of the other notes that we're going to be talking about in our Q&A today highlight additional aspects of this. It's just ridiculous. But...\n\nSteve: It is a good question. And I think I agree that I'm probably too trusting. It is certainly the case that I take a look at sort of the motivation, the site where the plug-in came from, try to get some feeling, as soft and fuzzy as that is, it's certainly not scientific. But get some feeling for where this came from and for why, what the user designed it for. Often their sites will say, yeah, I was struggling with this for some time, and I decided just to write my own sort of thing. Now, it's absolutely the case that there could be a security problem with a plug-in. That is, an inadvertent problem as opposed to something malicious. On the other hand, established companies have those just as often as guys working from their bedroom and publishing these. So I don't think there's any reason to believe an established company's plug-ins are going to be in any way more fundamentally secure than something that an individual writes.\n\nAnd again, it is the case also that things that have very low yield tend not to be targets. I mean, Windows is a much bigger target than the Mac because it's what 90-something percent of the world is using. And as we'll find out later in this podcast, a big chunk of the world isn't using legitimate copies of Windows, and those are even a bigger problem. So it's the case that it seems very unlikely that, were there to be a problem in my hierarchical tab tree organizer, that some malicious software is going to target that because the chance of someone using that is diminishingly small, even among Firefox users, who are still in the minority of all browser users. So I agree with J.T., I think I tend to be too trusting. I also think that the actual target surface is small for these, relative to the whole browser or the whole operating system that have much larger attack surfaces.\n\nLeo: All right. Moving on. Taylor Schreck - no relation - in Rochester, Minnesota - I made a little joke, a little funny there - in Rochester, Minnesota shares some thoughts on Conficker: Hi, Steve. I'm a few episodes behind, so I\n\napologize if you've already discovered this. In the episodes I've listened to recently you've commented on how amazing it is that it's taking so long for computers to be updated with critical security patches. I agree with your assessment that the corporate review of Microsoft patches may be partially responsible. However, I read a blog post this morning that brought up another probable factor. Many people cannot install updates.\n\nHere's the relevant excerpt, quote, \"Relatively few of the infected computers, about 4 percent, are in the U.S., according to a report issued by SRI International in March. About half the Conficker infections were Chinese computers, at more than 10 times the rate of U.S. infections. That makes sense, Wisniewski said, because there are now more web-connected computers in China than anywhere else. There's also a high incidence of pirated copies of software in China, meaning users there cannot keep their machines up to date with security patches.\" I just wanted to provide that as food for thought. Thanks to you and Leo for the work you do on Security Now. It's been a great way for me to learn and stay current. That's a good point. If you don't, well, is that true? If you don't have a legitimate copy, you can't update?\n\nLeo: In Hattiesburg, Mississippi. He says that people never cease to amuse: Hey, Mr. Gibson, let me start by saying that I really enjoy your weekly podcast, Security Now!, with Leo Laporte. It's always very informative. Lately you've been discussing the newest version of the worm known as Conficker and the importance of always staying up to date with the latest Windows updates in order to make your PC as secure as possible, though we all know that Windows PCs are never really totally secure.\n\nWell, as I've been listening I've noticed that a great deal of the time those who get infected or hacked by worms and viruses like Conficker are those who do just the opposite of what I just said. Now, to be honest, in the back of my mind I have been saying to myself, come on, who is really dumb enough to deny Windows Updates? I mean, for me, every time that little balloon in the task bar appears I get excited, like I've got a gift. All right, so I'm easily amused.\n\nWell, as the title of this post says, people never cease to amaze me. I noticed the other day as I was using one of the computer labs on my college campus that auto updates were turned off. Needless to say, the first thing that came through my little mind was, what idiots. So as any responsible geek would do, I proceeded to correct the issue. I came to find out that the machine I was using hadn't even updated to Service Pack 3. Yes. It didn't even have Service Pack 3. I was totally at a loss for words. Needless to say, I then immediately proceeded to Microsoft's website, downloaded and installed all available updates. This leads me to wonder how many other computers on this campus are in the same predicament? Anyways, all this to say you were indeed correct about the fact that many Windows machines are running unsecure and on outdated software. Thanks again for your helpful info, and please continue to keep us updated on everything security.\n\nThat's a case, I think a common case, of neglect. Machines that are on big networks that nobody's responsible for just get neglected.\n\nSteve: Yeah, and computers in a lab would be a good case. You can imagine, I mean, we don't know specifically and when auto updates were turned off and why. We know that Microsoft has them on by default, prompts you, bugs you until you turn them off. And it's difficult to have them off. But something somewhere deliberately said I want auto updates off on this machine. Maybe they were in the middle of something, they didn't want to be forced to reboot. I mean, we just don't know. But it certainly is the case that in this instance there was this important system, which is arguably very important, was disabled.\n\nNow, you might say, oh, well, certainly they're on a big private network behind a big university routing system. They probably don't have public IPs. Incoming traffic is probably heavily filtered and blocked. That may be so. But one of the things that Conficker is now doing is sending out ARP probes across the entire subnet where it's located. So even if that machine was protected, if there was any other instance, for example, of a machine being outside the network, getting infected, which is then brought into campus, that machine can infect across the entire sub-network through this next-generation LAN technology that Conficker has that we'll be talking about in detail next week. So it really is the case with state-of-the-art malware that things can get you even when you believe it's safe to depend upon further exterior resources, like the fact that you're behind a router, and all the machines in your own network can be trusted. If one stops being trustworthy, then the rest of your network can go down.\n\nLeo: Moving to Jesse in Madison, Wisconsin, who says, \"I know why Windows machines don't get patched\": Steve, I'm sure that you have been reading the stories about how many Windows computers aren't yet patched for Conficker. I think you know why computers aren't patched, even though the default Windows settings might even be set to automatically install. I think \"I\" know why, he says. I was helping my mom with her laptop, which is running Windows Vista Home Edition. I noticed that Windows Update hadn't installed any patches since [fanfare] November. I confirmed her settings. It was indeed set to automatically download and install updates. So I ran Windows Update manually. It failed. I didn't write down any error messages, but the gist of it was it couldn't find or download any updates. This is bad. I Googled for hours to see if anyone had seen this problem and if there were any solutions that worked. I found hundreds of forum postings with people having this problem. No one had a surefire solution that worked for me or other commenters on the forums.\n\nI tried many things to fix the problem. I won't bore you with the details. But be assured, as a Linux user I am not afraid to get into the guts of the system. I even ran SpinRite. There's a little happy face there. In the end, the only solution, reinstall Windows. Luckily, my mom only used the computer for browsing the Internet and checking her email, so the reinstallation was relatively painless. However, if I hadn't been around to help her, I'm sure she would have never even, not only not fixed the problem, she may have not known. Her computer would have just been another drone in a botnet army. Or worse, her identity might have been stolen. Most people are no more computer literate than my mom. So if Windows is failing to update itself for a significant portion of the population, this could explain why so many Windows computers are not being patched properly. Thanks for the show. Wow.\n\nSteve: Legality and ethics aside, yes. The first, I mean, I'm glad he said that because you're right, we've discussed many times the idea of white hats going in and leveraging the worm against - or the virus or the trojan or whatever against itself and using it for \"good,\" unquote, as opposed to evil. And remember we had the one story about the BBC who - I think it was the BBC that used a botnet and demonstrated that it worked, sent spam, did a denial of service attack against a willing ISP, and then modified all of the bots' screensaver to inform their owners that their system was infected and please go here to find a cure. I mean, that was a controversial thing to do, and arguably everything that the BBC did was against the law.\n\nWas it unethical? I don't think probably. And probably maybe not even illegal, depending upon what country you're in and who wants to form a complaint. But, and I referred to this earlier in the show, one of the things that Conficker does is very clever. And that is, it specifically blocks this kind of effort, not only being taken over by good guys, but by other bad guys who would like to commandeer the Conficker worm army that's been built. And that is, I mean, exactly as Zurahn says, you've got 50,000 domains. The worm's going to check every day for a small subset of those. So you could potentially set up your own server at some of those domains, and Conficker would, statistically, some Confickers would contact that domain. In which case you've got a connection to it. Why not do something?\n\nWell, the reason is that the authors are on the top of their game. They have a requirement that any packages coming into Conficker contain a valid digital signature, signed by them. And because this is public key technology in a digital signature, even reverse-engineering Conficker, all we could get - and we have determined all we can get, we'll be talking about this next week - is the public key. There's no way, and this is how public key technology works, asymmetric cryptography, there's no way even from having the public key for us to know what the private key is. The author of Conficker, or authors, have the private key. So anything that they want their worm to update, they package up, and they sign with their private key, and they stick it out on the Internet on these prearranged servers for it to be discovered by the worm. The worm discovers it, downloads it, and then uses its public key contained in its own code to verify the signature before it allows it into the system.\n\nSo, I mean, it's the same way, frankly, Windows Updates work. Windows Updates are signed by Microsoft's private Windows Update key. That prevents Windows from being spoofed and us accepting any malicious Windows Update packages. Conficker does exactly the same thing. So, I mean, it's using state-of-the-art cryptography to protect itself.\n\nSteve: Well, I've been doing a lot of that, thanks to the newsgroups that I run at GRC.com. This DNS benchmark owes many of its features to ideas that people have had. I mean, there is a tradeoff because it tends to be - I have to guard against people saying, oh, but what about this; and what about that; and, hey, I'd like to have this and so forth. I mean, you can end up running around in circles. And so I have to control myself not to endlessly be adding features.\n\nOne of the things that I'm going to do with CryptoLink is do the UI last, that is, deliberately have a temporary interim user interface so that I don't invest in UI design until all the features are there that I want to have there. Because what I've noticed over time is one of the most expensive things to do is for someone to say, oh, here's a great - how about this idea? And I'm thinking, oh, that's fantastic, but I don't have anywhere to put the button. So, I mean, an amazing amount of time gets spent in, like, reengineering, rejiggering the UI in order to accommodate great ideas. So I've decided I'm going to deliberately forestall the UI side. There will be a UI, but it'll just be just enough to exercise the product and have it all working. And my intention is to have, to very quickly get something going, and then have a timeline of other features, and just add feature after feature after feature until it's feature complete. At that point we'll let everyone play with it, see if there's anything I've forgotten. And when it looks like it's stable, I'll put the UI on it, and we're done.\n\nSteve: It's a really nice idea. I'm aware of people who use the \"keep cookies until I terminate my browser\" option. It is right there in the user interface. There's Allow First-Party Cookies, Allow Third-Party Cookies, and then underneath that is a dropdown box where you're able to choose the option Allow Until the Browser Is Terminated, some logic or some statement to that effect. And so what it does is it allows, it holds the cookies in memory, never writes them to disk, so your system is fully functional until you terminate. In which case it flushes all of those cookies out.\n\nI did pursue the Permit Cookies add-on because I've become [clearing throat] admittedly something of a Firefox add-on junkie. And it's exactly as Brad said. If you put \"permit cookies\" into the Find Add-ons dialogue built into Firefox, it'll say that nothing is there. But there's a link that says, like, find all versions or something to that effect. If you click that, it will take you to the page. And if you click the author's name, it takes you to the author's page, which is sort of a different name, it's like Gloria's something or other [Gorgias' Firefox Extensions]. And he's done a bunch of different kind of add-ons. Down toward the bottom is Permit Cookies.\n\nThat one - and he acknowledges the fact that there's a version problem, that his latest one on his site installs. Permit Cookies is a very small add-on. It puts a little \"C\" down in your toolbar. And what I like about it is, if you visit a site which you have whitelisted, or in this case greenlisted, the little \"C\" turns green. So if I go to Amazon.com, it's green. It knows that I have got Amazon.com in my whitelist saying I'm going to allow persistent cookies of whatever kind. And the same thing for eBay or for other sites you visit. When you go to a non-allowed site, the little \"C\" is just gray or white, not green. And then you're able to click on it, and it pops up a dialogue if you want to change that site's permission to allow persistent cookies.\n\nSo it's another - I would recommend this for people who like the idea of having that kind of control. Allow all cookies, first- and third-party cookies. Flush them when you leave Firefox so they don't persist across startup sessions of Firefox, which means you're not going to be tracked more than across your current session, and then whitelist the sites where you want to keep cookies permanently. That's another nice solution.\n\nLeo: We will dissect it all. Now, if you want to know more about what we just talked about, you can find a transcript, 16KB versions of all the shows, show notes, and more at Steve's site, GRC.com. That stands for Gibson Research Corporation. That's where you'll also find SpinRite, that great program we always talk about, the hard drive maintenance utility that is just - there's nothing better. Just the king of the hill, has been for years. And of course a lot of free stuff that Steve gives away, useful tools like Shoot The Messenger, ShieldsUP!, DCOMbobulator, Unplug n' Pray, Wizmo. It's all at GRC.com.\n\nWe also have show notes at wiki.twit.tv. They're created by the listeners, which is always handy, usually with lots of links in there. We have a FriendFeed room now called TWiT Conversations, if you're on FriendFeed it's TWiT-conversations, that people partake in during the live taping, and you can comment after the fact, as well. And of course the live show is every Wednesday afternoon at 2:00 p.m. Eastern, that's 11:00 a.m. Pacific or 18:00 UTC at live.twit.tv or twit.am, if you just want to listen to the audio. And that way you can listen, comment in our chatrooms. We have many of them on Stickam, on Ustream, on IRC, and on FriendFeed now so that you can comment. And we monitor them all and try to feed the comments back into the show. So we always appreciate it when you do that. If you aren't listening to the show every week, you might want to subscribe. In iTunes you can get it automatically by going to the iTunes store and searching for TWiT. You'll find all the TWiT shows there, including this one, Security Now!. They're free. You get them automatically the minute they ship. Security Now! comes out next. Thank you, Steve."
