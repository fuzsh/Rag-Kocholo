        "text": "American author, actor, and humorist\n\nJohn Kellogg Hodgman (born June 3, 1971) is an American author, actor, and humorist. In addition to his published written works, such as The Areas of My Expertise, More Information Than You Require, and That Is All, he is known for his personification of a PC in contrast to Justin Long's personification of a Mac in Apple's \"Get a Mac\" advertising campaign, and for his work as a contributor on Comedy Central's The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.\n\nHis writings have been published in One Story (to which he contributed the debut story \"Villanova\"), The Paris Review, McSweeney's Quarterly Concern, Wired and The New York Times Magazine. He has also contributed to This American Life, CBC Radio One’s, and Wiretap. His first book and accompanying audio narration, The Areas of My Expertise, a satirical tongue-in-cheek almanac that contains almost no factual information, was published in 2005. His second book, More Information Than You Require, went on sale October 21, 2008. His third book, That Is All, went on sale November 1, 2011. Vacationland: True Stories from Painful Beaches, a collection of \"real life wanderings\" about Hodgman's life experiences (especially in Western Massachusetts and coastal Maine) was published on October 24, 2017.[1] Vacationland was a finalist for the 2018 Thurber Prize for American Humor.[2] His most recent book, Medallion Status was released on October 17, 2019.\n\nHodgman was the headline speaker at the 2009 Radio and Television Correspondents' Association dinner in Washington, D.C.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nHodgman was born and raised in Brookline, Massachusetts, the son of Eileen (née Callahan), a nurse and educator, and John Francis Hodgman, the President and CEO of the Massachusetts Technology Development Corporation and a professor at Tufts University.[3][4][5] He attended the Heath School and Brookline High School, where he edited the underground magazine Samizdat, named for the grassroots dissident publishing movement produced under the Soviet Bloc.[6][7] During his last year of high school, he hosted the weekly Radio Consuelo show on freeform station WMFO in Medford.[8]\n\nIn 1994 Hodgman graduated from Yale University with a degree in literature, focusing on literary criticism.[9][10] Before gaining fame as a writer, Hodgman worked as a literary agent at Writers House in New York City, where he represented Darin Strauss, Deborah Digges, and actor Bruce Campbell, among others. Hodgman has used his experience as an agent in his column \"Ask a Former Professional Literary Agent\" at McSweeney's Internet Tendency.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nHodgman appeared on The Daily Show on November 16, 2005, to promote his book, The Areas of My Expertise. Host Jon Stewart described the book as \"very funny\" and said that the section on hobo names in particular was written with \"a certain kind of genius.\" Hodgman has returned to the Daily Show numerous times for \"resident expert\" interview segments,[11] and has been listed on the show's web site as a contributor.[12]\n\nIn 2005, Hodgman played a character named \"The Deranged Millionaire\" in They Might Be Giants's Venue Songs DVD/CD, narrating in between songs with dialog he co-wrote with the band. The Deranged Millionaire character also appeared on The Daily Show on April 2, 2014.[13] He also narrated a number of Venue Songs-themed setlists during the band's live shows in 2005, and has introduced the band while in the role of The Deranged Millionaire up to May 16, 2007. Hodgman appeared again with They Might Be Giants on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, on December 11, 2009. Hodgman performed the spoken-word portions of the song \"Why Does the Sun Shine?\"\n\nIn February 2006, Hodgman appeared on Attack of the Show, a show that aired daily on G4, to share some insight with the host and promote his book The Areas of My Expertise. In this appearance, Hodgman recounted the sad tale of the lobster (which he said were actually a small, furry, extinct species, killed and replaced by the creatures we think of as lobsters today) and brought along Jonathan Coulton, a frequent Hodgman collaborator and musical director of the Little Gray Book lectures. Coulton performed a song called \"Furry Old Lobster.\"[14] Also, on October 18, 2008, Hodgman appeared again on Attack of the Show to talk about his newest book, More Information Than You Require.\n\nHodgman appeared in the North American Get a Mac advertising campaign for Apple Inc., which ran from May 2006 through 2010. In the ads he plays the personification of a PC alongside his Mac counterpart, played by actor Justin Long. In reality, however, Hodgman himself became a Mac user in 1984.[15] On November 10, 2020, he made a surprise brief appearance at the 45:27 mark of Apple's virtual \"One More Thing\" event, where Apple unveiled its first Macs based on its own Apple silicon chips.[16]\n\nIn 2007, Hodgman appeared in the \"Bowie\" episode of the HBO television series Flight of the Conchords. He played the manager of a musical greeting card company who was considering using one of the band's songs for a greeting card.\n\nOn October 1, 2008, Boing Boing's Xeni Jardin announced the official debut of the web series SPAMasterpiece Theater. Hodgman himself described it as \"true tale[s] of romance, adventure, infamy, and low-cost prescription drugs, all culled from the reams of actual, unsolicited emails, received here by us and people like you – what we call SPAM.\"[17][18][19]\n\nHodgman appeared in the episode \"No Exit\" of Battlestar Galactica, appearing as the civilian neurosurgeon, Dr. Gerard. He had earlier visited the set in 2005 to write about the show for The New York Times Magazine.[20]\n\nOn June 19, 2009, Hodgman was the headline speaker at the 2009 Radio and Television Correspondents' Association dinner in Washington, D.C. Hodgman referred to this event as a \"Nerd Prom.\" Many of his jokes were on the topic of President Barack Obama as the first nerd president, and quizzed the president on his knowledge of Frank Herbert's novel Dune.[21]\n\nHodgman appeared in the last two episodes of the first season of Bored to Death, \"The Case of the Stolen Sperm\" and \"Take a Dive,\" as a literary reviewer who wrote a bad review that offended the main character.[22] He returned in the second and third seasons.\n\nHodgman voice-acted on The Venture Bros. in the episode \"Self-Medication\" as Dale Hale, an ex-boy detective in therapy following the death of his father. He has since had multiple appearances in Season 5 as O.S.I. operative Snoopy, along with other roles.\n\nAlso, during the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards in September 2009, Hodgman provided color commentary with made up trivia about the winners.[23] He reprised this role for the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards in August 2010.\n\nBecause of his continuing support for QI, the BBC's intellectual comedy quiz, to be shown on BBC America,[24] Hodgman was invited to appear on the show. He was the first “fifth panelist\" on the program broadcast December 3, 2009 (the usual line-up being Stephen Fry as host, Alan Davies as regular panelist and three guests)—and won, continuing the tradition of a guest winning their \"rookie\" appearance on the show.[25]\n\nIn 2012, Hodgman guest-starred in an episode of Delocated called \"Reunion Show,\" acting as the host of a fictional show-within-a-show. Also in 2012, he appeared as a psychiatrist in an episode of Community called \"Curriculum Unavailable.\"\n\nHodgman made a guest appearance on the sitcom series Husbands in its second season.[26]\n\nIn 2013, Hodgman starred as \"Special Agent Henry Topple\" in Wired's first scripted web series Codefellas.[27][28][29]\n\nHodgman appeared as public radio personality August Clementine in the episode \"Anniversaries\" of Parks and Recreation, which aired in February 2014.\n\nHodgman has a supporting role in the FX comedy Married, which premiered in July 2014. In December 2014, Hodgman appeared in three episodes of the Amazon Studios series Mozart in the Jungle.\n\nIn 2014–2015, Hodgman appeared for three episodes as a fictionalized version of psychiatrist and medical doctor Henry Cotton on the Cinemax series The Knick.[30]\n\nIn 2016, Hodgman played the role of Travis, a local television station manager, in four episodes of the second season of Amazon's Red Oaks series.[31]\n\nIn November 2017, Hodgman was named one of Portland Magazine's \"10 Most Intriguing Mainers.\"[32]\n\nNetflix special\n\n[edit]\n\nNetflix, the American streaming media website, aired the comedy special John Hodgman: Ragnarok on June 20, 2013, as a \"Netflix Original\".[33][34][35] The special featured material from Hodgman's most recent book, That Is All, and his December 21, 2012, show at The Bell House in New York.[33][36]\n\nJudge John Hodgman podcast\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2010, Hodgman began hosting a weekly, comedic court show podcast called Judge John Hodgman.[37] The program features Hodgman acting as a judge (with Jesse Thorn as bailiff) adjudicating real-life disputes within a fictional courtroom setting. The cases answer questions like, \"Should the kitchen sink's built-in dispenser be filled with dish soap or hand soap?\" and \"Can you stop family members from using your childhood nickname?\"[38]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2008 Baby Mama Fertility Doctor 2009 Coraline Father/Other Father (voice) 2009 The Invention of Lying Wedding Overseer 2010 The Best and the Brightest Henry 2011 Arthur Candy Store Manager 2013 Movie 43 The Penguin Segment: \"Super Hero Speed Dating\" 2013 The English Teacher Unmotivated Man 2014 Learning to Drive Car Salesman 2015 Pitch Perfect 2 Tone Hanger 2020 Class Action Park Narrator 2023 The Venture Bros.: Radiant Is the Blood of the Baboon Heart Snoopy (voice)\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2006–2015 The Daily Show Himself (contributor) 73 episodes 2007 Flight of the Conchords David Armstrong Episode: \"Bowie\" 2008 SPAMasterpiece Theater Himself 5 episodes 2009 QI Himself 1 episode 2009–2011 Bored to Death Louis Greene 8 episodes 2009–2018 The Venture Bros.
