Reportedly, Morrone quit The Screen Savers to raise a family and write for one of Microsoft's consumer websites. She made occasional guest appearances after departing.\n\nWith Microsoft, Morrone was a writer and editor for 11 years, developing and writing for Microsoft Safety and Security Center, writing for the Security Tips & Talk blog, writing for one newsletter, and managing content for another.\n\nShe previously ran the Jumping Monkeys website devoted to her three children and to child-raising issues. She announced in February 2009 that the podcast, at one point on hiatus, would not be returning.[3]\n\nFollowing the 2004 merger of G4 and TechTV, Screen Savers host Leo Laporte created a podcast and video network called TWiT.tv. Morrone guest co-hosted Inside the Net in late 2006.[4] From 2007 to 2008, Morrone co-hosted the Jumping Monkeys: Parenting in the Digital Age program with Laporte.[5]\n\nShe returned to TWiT in 2015,[6] hosting the final year of both iFive for the iPhone and Tech News 2Night, co-hosting iOS Today with Leo Laporte (2015 on), and co-hosting a relaunched Tech News Today with Jason Howell, starting in 2016. The program was reformatted in October 2017 as Tech News Weekly.[7]\n\nOn June 28, 2019 Morrone announced she was leaving TWiT to pursue other opportunities.[8] She worked for Medium until 2021 when she announced she would be joining Protocol, a news website owned by Capitol News Company.[9]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nMorrone earned a BA from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.[10] She currently lives in Northern California with her husband, Marco, and their three children, Annabella, Milo, and Huck.[10]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
