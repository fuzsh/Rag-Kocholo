It was the second show to premiere on the TWiT Network, launching in summer 2005. The first episode, “As the Worm Turns”, was released on August 19, 2005.[3]\n\nSecurity Now! consists of a discussion between Gibson and Laporte on issues of computer security and, conversely, insecurity. Covered topics have included security vulnerabilities, firewalls, password security, spyware, rootkits, Wi-Fi, virtual private networks, and virtual machines.\n\nPodcast feed\n\n[edit]\n\nSecurity Now! is distributed via its main podcast RSS feed and on the GRC Security Now! page. In addition to audio, text transcriptions are published, along with Gibson distributing a low-bandwidth 16 kbit/s version of the show on his own for those with low-bandwidth sources such as satellite internet or dial-up.\n\nThe podcast runs for approximately two hours, typically starting with security news. Then Gibson reads a testimonial for his software SpinRite. The remainder of the show is spent on a particular theme. During the show some advertisements for 3rd party commercial products or services are read out, by co-host Leo Laporte.\n\nBi-weekly \"Mailbag\" episodes answer questions and respond to feedback submitted by listeners.[4]\n\nPopularity\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 2007, Security Now! won in the People's Choice Podcast Awards Technology/Science category.[5] In August 2006, Security Now! ranked fourth in the \"Top 40\" of all podcasts listened to via the PodNova service.[6] Security Now! averaged around 100,000 downloads per episode throughout 2006.[7][8] At the end of 2015, Security Now was number 4 on the Top 40 US Technology Podcasts, making it the highest weekly TWiT.tv podcast.[9] In October 2021 it was #6 on Apple Podcasts — US tech news,[10] and #330 of global all podcasts.[11]\n\nWindows Metafile controversy\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Windows Metafile vulnerability\n\nIn January 2006, Steve Gibson accused Microsoft of intentionally putting a backdoor into the Windows Metafile processing code in Windows 2000 and Windows XP. Gibson claimed that while reverse engineering the Windows Metafile format, he could run arbitrary code by using a \"nonsensical\" value in the metafile, and concluded Microsoft had intentionally designed Windows this way so it could run code on Windows computers without the user's knowledge.[12] Microsoft's Stephen Toulouse responded in a Microsoft Security Response Center blog post the next day, saying the behavior was not intentional.[13]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
