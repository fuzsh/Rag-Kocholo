        "text": "TCP/IP application layer protocol\n\nThe Gopher protocol ( ) is a communication protocol designed for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents in Internet Protocol networks. The design of the Gopher protocol and user interface is menu-driven, and presented an alternative to the World Wide Web in its early stages, but ultimately fell into disfavor, yielding to Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The Gopher ecosystem is often regarded as the effective predecessor of the World Wide Web.[1][2]\n\nUsage\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Gopher protocol was invented by a team led by Mark P. McCahill[3] at the University of Minnesota. It offers some features not natively supported by the Web and imposes a much stronger hierarchy on the documents it stores. Its text menu interface is well-suited to computing environments that rely heavily on remote text-oriented computer terminals, which were still common at the time of its creation in 1991, and the simplicity of its protocol facilitated a wide variety of client implementations. More recent[when?] Gopher revisions and graphical clients added support for multimedia.[citation needed]\n\nFirefox 1.5 (2005)\n\nGopher's hierarchical structure provided a platform for the first large-scale electronic library connections.[4] The Gopher protocol is still in use by enthusiasts, and although it has been almost entirely supplanted by the Web, a small population of actively-maintained servers remains.[2]\n\nOrigins\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Gopher system was released in mid-1991 by Mark P. McCahill, Farhad Anklesaria, Paul Lindner, Daniel Torrey, and Bob Alberti of the University of Minnesota in the United States.[5] Its central goals were, as stated in RFC 1436:\n\nA file-like hierarchical arrangement that would be familiar to users.\n\nA simple syntax.\n\nA system that can be created quickly and inexpensively.\n\nExtensibility of the file system metaphor; allowing addition of searches for example.\n\nGopher combines document hierarchies with collections of services, including WAIS, the Archie and Veronica search engines, and gateways to other information systems such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Usenet.\n\nThe general interest in campus-wide information systems (CWISs) in higher education at the time,[6] and the ease of setup of Gopher servers to create an instant CWIS with links to other sites' online directories and resources, were the factors contributing to Gopher's rapid adoption.\n\nThe name was coined by Anklesaria as a play on several meanings of the word \"gopher\".[7] The University of Minnesota mascot is the gopher,[8] a gofer is an assistant who \"goes for\" things, and a gopher burrows through the ground to reach a desired location.[9]\n\nDecline\n\n[edit]\n\nThe World Wide Web was in its infancy in 1991, and Gopher services quickly became established.[10] By the late 1990s, Gopher had ceased expanding. Several factors contributed to Gopher's stagnation:\n\nIn February 1993, the University of Minnesota announced that it would charge licensing fees for the use of its implementation of the Gopher server.[11][9] Users became concerned that fees might also be charged for independent implementations.[12][13] Gopher expansion stagnated, to the advantage of the World Wide Web, to which CERN disclaimed ownership.[14] In September 2000, the University of Minnesota re-licensed its Gopher software under the GNU General Public License.[15]\n\nGopher client functionality was quickly duplicated by the early Mosaic web browser, which subsumed its protocol.\n\nGopher has a more rigid structure than the free-form HyperText Markup Language (HTML) of the Web. Every Gopher document has a defined format and type, and the typical user navigates through a single server-defined menu system to get to a particular document. This can be quite different from the way a user finds documents on the Web.\n\nFailure to follow the open systems model, bad publicity[16]\n\nGopher remains in active use by its enthusiasts, and there have been attempts to revive Gopher on modern platforms and mobile devices. One attempt is The Overbite Project,[17] which hosts various browser extensions and modern clients.\n\nServer census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2012 , there remained about 160 gopher servers indexed by Veronica-2,[18] reflecting a slow growth from 2007 when there were fewer than 100.[19] They are typically infrequently updated. On these servers Veronica indexed approximately 2.5 million unique selectors. A handful of new servers were being set up every year by hobbyists with over 50 having been set up and added to Floodgap's list since 1999.[20] A snapshot of Gopherspace in 2007 circulated on BitTorrent and was still available in 2010.[21] Due to the simplicity of the Gopher protocol, setting up new servers or adding Gopher support to browsers is often done in a tongue-in-cheek manner, principally on April Fools' Day.[22]\n\nIn November 2014 Veronica indexed 144 gopher servers,[18] reflecting a small drop from 2012, but within these servers Veronica indexed approximately 3 million unique selectors.\n\nIn March 2016 Veronica indexed 135 gopher servers,[18] within which it indexed approximately 4 million unique selectors.\n\nIn March 2017 Veronica indexed 133 gopher servers,[18] within which it indexed approximately 4.9 million unique selectors.\n\nIn May 2018 Veronica indexed 260 gopher servers,[18] within which it indexed approximately 3.7 million unique selectors.\n\nIn May 2019 Veronica indexed 320 gopher servers,[18] within which it indexed approximately 4.2 million unique selectors.\n\nIn January 2020 Veronica indexed 395 gopher servers,[18] within which it indexed approximately 4.5 million unique selectors.\n\nIn February 2021 Veronica indexed 361 gopher servers,[18] within which it indexed approximately 6 million unique selectors.\n\nIn February 2022 Veronica indexed 325 gopher servers,[18] within which it indexed approximately 5 million unique selectors.\n\nTechnical details\n\n[edit]\n\nThe conceptualization of knowledge in \"Gopher space\" or a \"cloud\" as specific information in a particular file, and the prominence of the FTP, influenced the technology and the resulting functionality of Gopher.\n\nGopher characteristics\n\n[edit]\n\nGopher is designed to function and to appear much like a mountable read-only global network file system (and software, such as gopherfs, is available that can actually mount a Gopher server as a FUSE resource). At a minimum, whatever can be done with data files on a CD-ROM, can be done on Gopher.\n\nA Gopher system consists of a series of hierarchical hyperlinkable menus. The choice of menu items and titles is controlled by the administrator of the server.\n\nSimilar to a file on a Web server, a file on a Gopher server can be linked to as a menu item from any other Gopher server. Many servers take advantage of this inter-server linking to provide a directory of other servers that the user can access.\n\nProtocol\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Gopher protocol was first described in RFC 1436. Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has assigned Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 70 to the Gopher protocol. The protocol is simple to negotiate, making it possible to browse without using a client.\n\nUser request\n\n[edit]\n\nFirst, the client establishes a TCP connection with the server on port 70, the standard gopher port. The client then sends a string followed by a carriage return followed by a line feed (a \"CR + LF\" sequence). This is the selector, which identifies the document to be retrieved. If the item selector were an empty line, the default directory would be selected.\n\nServer response\n\n[edit]\n\nThe server then replies with the requested item and closes the connection. According to the protocol, before the connection closes, the server should send a full-stop (i.e., a period character) on a line by itself. However, not all servers conform to this part of the protocol and the server may close a connection without returning a final full-stop. The main type of reply from the server is a text or binary resource. Alternatively, the resource can be a menu: a form of structured text resource providing references to other resources.\n\nBecause of the simplicity of the Gopher protocol, tools such as netcat make it possible to download Gopher content easily from a command line:\n\n$ echo jacks/jack.exe| nc gopher.example.org70 > jack.exe\n\nThe protocol is also supported by cURL as of 7.21.2-DEV.[23]\n\nSearch request\n\n[edit]\n\nThe selector string in the request can optionally be followed by a tab character and a search string. This is used by item type 7.\n\nSource code of a menu\n\n[edit]\n\nGopher menu items are defined by lines of tab-separated values in a text file. This file is sometimes called a gophermap. As the source code to a gopher menu, a gophermap is roughly analogous to an HTML file for a web page. Each tab-separated line (called a selector line) gives the client software a description of the menu item: what it is, what it is called, and where it leads to. The client displays the menu items in the order that they appear in the gophermap.\n\nThe first character in a selector line indicates the item type, which tells the client what kind of file or protocol the menu item points to. This helps the client decide what to do with it. Gopher's item types are a more basic precursor to the media type system used by the Web and email attachments.\n\nThe item type is followed by the user display string (a description or label that represents the item in the menu); the selector (a path or other string for the resource on the server); the hostname (the domain name or IP address of the server), and the network port.\n\nAll lines in a gopher menu are terminated by \"CR + LF\".\n\nExample of a selector line in a menu source: The following selector line generates a link to the \"/home\" directory at the subdomain gopher.floodgap.com, on port 70. The item type of 1 indicates that the linked resource is a Gopher menu itself. The string \"Floodgap Home\" is what the client will show to the user when visiting the example menu.\n\n1Floodgap Home /home gopher.floodgap.com 70\n\nItem type User display string Selector Hostname Port 1 Floodgap Home /home gopher.floodgap.com 70\n\nItem types\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a Gopher menu's source code, a one-character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect. This code may either be a digit or a letter of the alphabet; letters are case-sensitive.\n\nThe technical specification for Gopher, RFC 1436, defines 14 item types. The later gopher+ specification defined an additional 3 types.[24] A one-character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect. Item type 3 is an error code for exception handling. Gopher client authors improvised item types h (HTML), i (informational message), and s (sound file) after the publication of RFC 1436. Browsers like Netscape Navigator and early versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer would prepend the item type code to the selector as described in RFC 4266, so that the type of the gopher item could be determined by the url itself. Most gopher browsers still available, use these prefixes in their urls.\n\nCanonical types 0 Text file 1 Gopher submenu 2 CCSO Nameserver 3 Error code returned by a Gopher server to indicate failure 4 BinHex-encoded file (primarily for Macintosh computers) 5 DOS file 6 uuencoded file 7 Gopher full-text search 8 Telnet 9 Binary file + Mirror or alternate server (for load balancing or in case of primary server downtime) g GIF file I Image file T Telnet 3270 gopher+ types : Bitmap image ; Movie file < Sound file Non-canonical types d Doc.

To search fake (NULL) 0 ifor a county, use the name plus County -- for instance, fake (NULL) 0 iDallas County. fake (NULL) 0\n\nThe gopher menu sent back from the server, is a sequence of lines each of which describes an item that can be retrieved. Most clients will display these as hypertext links, and so allow the user to navigate through gopherspace by following the links.[5] This menu includes a text resource (itemtype 0 on the third line), multiple links to submenus (itemtype 1, on the second line as well as lines 4-6) and a non-standard information message (from line 7 on), broken down to multiple lines by providing dummy values for selector, host and port.\n\nHistorically, to create a link to a Web server, \"GET /\" was used as a pseudo-selector to emulate an HTTP GET request.[26] John Goerzen created an addition[27] to the Gopher protocol, commonly referred to as \"URL links\", that allows links to any protocol that supports URLs. For example, to create a link to http://gopher.quux.org/, the item type is h, the display string is the title of the link, the item selector is \"URL:http://gopher.quux.org/\", and the domain and port are that of the originating Gopher server (so that clients that do not support URL links will query the server and receive an HTML redirection page).\n\nGopher+\n\n[edit]\n\nGopher+ is a forward compatible enhancement to the Gopher protocol. Gopher+ works by sending metadata between the client and the server. The enhancement was never widely adopted by Gopher servers.[28][29][30] The client sends a tab followed by a +. A Gopher+ server will respond with a status line followed by the content the client requested. An item is marked as supporting Gopher+ in the Gopher directory listing by a tab + after the port (this is the case of some of the items in the example above).\n\nOther features of Gopher+ include:\n\nItem attributes, which can include the items\n\nAdministrator\n\nLast date of modification\n\nDifferent views of the file, like PostScript or plain text, or different languages\n\nAbstract, or description of the item\n\nInteractive queries\n\nClient software\n\n[edit]\n\nGopher clients\n\n[edit]\n\nThese are clients, libraries, and utilities primarily designed to access gopher resources.\n\nClient Updated License Language Type Notes ACID 2021 ?

Similarly, certain server packages such as GN and PyGopherd have built-in Gopher to HTTP interfaces. Squid Proxy software gateways any gopher:// URL to HTTP content, enabling any browser or web agent to access gopher content easily.\n\nFor Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey, Overbite[17] extensions extend Gopher browsing and support the current versions of the browsers (Firefox Quantum v ≥57 and equivalent versions of SeaMonkey):\n\nOverbiteWX redirects gopher:// URLs to a proxy;\n\nOverbiteNX adds native-like support;\n\nfor Firefox up to 56.*, and equivalent versions of SeaMonkey, OverbiteFF adds native-like support, but it is no longer maintained\n\nOverbiteWX includes support for accessing Gopher servers not on port 70 using a whitelist and for CSO/ph queries. OverbiteFF always uses port 70. For Chromium and Google Chrome, Burrow[38] is available. It redirects gopher:// URLs to a proxy. In the past an Overbite proxy-based extension for these browsers was available but is no longer maintained and does not work with the current (>23) releases.[17] For Konqueror, Kio gopher[43] is available.\n\nAs the bandwidth-sparing simple interface of Gopher can be a good match for mobile phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs),[44] the early 2010s saw a renewed interest in native Gopher clients for popular smartphones.\n\nGopher popularity was at its height at a time when there were still many equally competing computer architectures and operating systems. As a result, there are several Gopher clients available for Acorn RISC OS, AmigaOS, Atari MiNT, Conversational Monitor System (CMS), DOS, classic Mac OS, MVS, NeXT, OS/2 Warp, most Unix-like operating systems, VMS, Windows 3.x, and Windows 9x. GopherVR was a client designed for 3D visualization, and there is even a Gopher client in MOO.[45][46] Most such clients are hard-coded to work on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 70.[47]\n\nServer software\n\n[edit]\n\nBecause the protocol is trivial to implement in a basic fashion, there are many server packages still available, and some are still maintained.\n\nServer Developed by Latest version Release date License Written in Notes Aftershock Rob Linwood 1.0.1 22 April 2004 MIT Java Apache::GopherHandler Timm Murray 0.1 26 March 2004 GPLv2 or any later version Perl Apache 2 plugin to run Gopher-Server.
