        "text": "List of programs for downloading podcasts, video, newsfeeds and other media\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nA podcast client, podcatcher, or podcast app, is a computer program or mobile app used to stream or download podcasts, via an RSS or XML feed.[1][2][3]\n\nWhile podcast clients are best known for streaming and downloading audio podcasts, many can also download video podcasts, newsfeeds, text, and pictures. Some of these podcast clients can also automate the transfer of received audio or video files to a portable media player. Although most include a searchable directory of podcasts (usually populated by either Apple Podcasts or Podcast Index), they also allow users to manually subscribe directly to a podcast RSS feed by providing the URL.\n\nThe core concepts were developing since 2000, and the first commercial podcast client software was developed in 2001.[4][5]\n\nPodcasts were made popular when Apple added podcasts to its iTunes 4.9 software and iPod portable media player in June 2005.[6] Apple Podcasts is currently included in all Apple devices, such as iPhone, iPad and Mac computers.\n\nPodcast clients\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Description License Operating system Amarok Music player and podcast client GPL FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, Windows AntennaPod Podcast manager for Android MIT Android Apple Podcasts Podcast software developed by Apple, built into Apple devices Proprietary iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, Windows Audacy Broadcast, Internet radio and podcast platform Proprietary Android, iOS, Web Audible Audiobook and podcast app Proprietary Android, iOS, macOS, Windows Breaker[7] Social podcast app Proprietary iOS Castbox A podcast distribution network and player Proprietary Android, iOS, watchOS Castamatic Freemium podcast client for Apple Watch, iPad, and iPhone Proprietary iOS, watchOS Clementine A cross-platform fork of Amarok GPL Linux, macOS, Windows CPod A multi-platform desktop podcast player Apache Linux, macOS, Windows Deezer Streaming music and podcast app Proprietary Android, iOS, Windows, Web doubleTwist Android music player with podcast directory and podcast support.
