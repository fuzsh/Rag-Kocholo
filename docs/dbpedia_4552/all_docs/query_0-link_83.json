We have a very special guest. You'll remember her from a website Web three is going just great. She writes about crypto. She's an expert in all sorts of interesting things, including web design. Molly White is here. We will talk, of course, about cryptocurrency, about SPF I'll ask her who she thinks Satoshi Nakamoto is. We'll talk about the latest Google News. Yes, we even have a Google Change Log, a fun show coming up next with Molly White Podcasts you love. From people you trust.\n\nThis is twig. This is twig this week in Google, episode 756, recorded Wednesday, february 21st 2024. Good sort and be it on this week in Google is brought to you by Rocket Money. If I asked you how many subscriptions you have right now, would you be able to list them all and would you know how much you're paying on all of them Now? If you'd asked me that question, I would have confidently answered, but I would have been wrong. Until I started using Rocket Money, I had no idea. Rocket Money has literally saved me thousands of dollars by finding and canceling subscriptions that I've been paying for for years. Rocket Money, it's a personal finance app that finds and cancels your unwanted subscriptions. It also monitors your spending, and I use it for that. It helps lower your bills. Rocket Money now has more than 5 million users and has helped save its members an average of $720 a year more than $500 million half a billion dollars in canceled subscriptions. With Rocket Money, you can see all your subscriptions in one place. If you see something you don't want, you can cancel it with a tap. You never have to get on the phone with customer service. So stop wasting money on things you don't use. Cancel your unwanted subscriptions by going to rocketmoneycom slash twig. That's rocketmoneycom slash twig. Rocket Money rocketmoneycom slash twig.\n\nIt's time for twig this week in Google, the show. We cover the latest for going on in the world, except for everybody except Google, because Google's gotten less interesting over the years. So we've inherited the name. Paris Martino is here. She is from the information. See, that's a good name. It's always information. You could cover anything, it would always be information.\n\n0:02:35 - Paris Martineau\n\nThat's true. I like how the title of this show kind of goes off the rails more and more. It's getting worse and worse. The longer you do it. It really just takes a nosedive as soon as you intro it.\n\n0:02:46 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, the advertisers. If we say this week in Google, they go oh good. But if we say, well, it's not about Google, they go what? So I don't know. I don't really know where to go with this. Jeff Jarvis is also here. Have I retired?\n\n0:02:59 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nIt doesn't take a nosedive Paris, it takes a flight, a fancy, a flight of new reasons. That's true.\n\n0:03:04 - Paris Martineau\n\nA beautiful spiral dive that gets 10 points.\n\n0:03:08 - Leo Laporte\n\nSpeaking of spiral dives. He was the Lennartown professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Craig Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.\n\n0:03:21 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nNow deorbiting what do you think you didn't sing in Paris?\n\n0:03:26 - Paris Martineau\n\nWhat do you think? I didn't?\n\n0:03:28 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nsay anything.\n\n0:03:28 - Paris Martineau\n\nSorry, I was reading the chat. Should I keep this?\n\n0:03:30 - Leo Laporte\n\nlaminated card, jeff, or we're going to replace it? No, I think we'd do something new. I would tear it up, but it's so nicely laminated.\n\n0:03:39 - Speaker 6\n\nIt's laminated.\n\n0:03:40 - Leo Laporte\n\nI can't Now. We're very serious here because we have got a very important guest and I don't want her to get the wrong impression we started talking about. Web3 is going just great, Probably three years ago I don't know when you started it but Molly White, the creator, is here. Hello, Molly, Good to see you, Welcome.\n\n0:04:02 - Molly White\n\nHello, thank you for having me.\n\n0:04:04 - Leo Laporte\n\nBrilliant site that basically chronicles the demise of crypto Web3, nfts. And you have this wonderful little dollar amount in the lower right of how much money has been burned in the Web3 debacle.\n\n0:04:23 - Paris Martineau\n\nI love the flame.\n\n0:04:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nIsn't that great it is it is.\n\n0:04:26 - Molly White\n\nYeah, I worked hard on this.\n\n0:04:28 - Leo Laporte\n\nAre you? Do you have web design background?\n\n0:04:32 - Molly White\n\nNot really design, but I'm a web developer by sort of career history.\n\n0:04:36 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, because I know I remember you said anybody who wants to use this template. There are other people using that same template of kind of the scrolling history and all that. Right, I mean I think that's cool that you gave that away.\n\n0:04:51 - Molly White\n\nYeah, there are a bunch of sort of spin off is going great websites that are not controlled by me which I was delighted by.\n\n0:04:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhat are like? What Like Boeing is going great, or what is it.\n\n0:05:02 - Molly White\n\nTwitter is going great. It was like the big one. Yeah, I think there was one for Reddit, maybe when they started to really like close down the API, but I think Twitter is really the big one.\n\n0:05:14 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's perfect for it. It's one of those things where the story is just mounted up Very nice. It's a franchise. Yeah, you got a franchise, but I did not know this. I went to Molly Whitenet, your website. I did not know that, for instance, you've been editing Wikipedia. I think it must have been since you were in grade school. It says for over 15 years.\n\n0:05:37 - Molly White\n\nYeah, just about.\n\n0:05:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nI was like 13 when I started, oh my God, what was the impetus to start editing Wikipedia?\n\n0:05:46 - Molly White\n\nI learned that I could and I was just kind of that kind of kid that liked doing stuff like that. I'm going to mess with it and as soon as I realized I could, I was yeah, I was off to the races at that point.\n\n0:05:57 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nUnder the. Did you tell your friends or hide this from your friends?\n\n0:06:01 - Molly White\n\nI don't know how soon I told them, but eventually they knew yeah, that was going to make me?\n\n0:06:06 - Paris Martineau\n\nWas it a big part of your identity as a child?\n\n0:06:09 - Molly White\n\nBigger than you might expect. Yeah, I mean I didn't try to make it a big part of my identity, but people, like, as soon as they learned that I was editing Wikipedia in like high school, they got very excited about that, because a lot of people at that point didn't really know you could and they thought it was really fun that, like a high school kid was writing Wikipedia.\n\n0:06:28 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nDo you remember the first citation that you edited?\n\n0:06:33 - Molly White\n\nIt was about unicycles, which is also an interest of mine at the time.\n\n0:06:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, and as we all know, jeff Bezos' father was a famous unicyclist, so as we all know, as we all know what does. Yeah, you didn't know that. Maybe you want to get on his Wikipedia page and yeah, I should go update the page You're a notable unicyclist. It says on your Wikipedia user page that you are both an administrator and oversightor. What the hell is that?\n\n0:07:04 - Molly White\n\nWhich one, the administrator or the administrator.\n\n0:07:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nI kind of get. Well, I don't know what, tell me, but what's an oversightor?\n\n0:07:12 - Molly White\n\nIt's part of a group of people that are called functionaries on Wikipedia. That are people who have sort of the highest level of administrative tooling, I guess, and so oversightors have the capacity to sort of permanent not permanently, but very strongly hide information that's been put on Wikipedia that needs to be removed for legal reasons or things like that.\n\n0:07:35 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo that's present very high, that's a job, that's a high title. Can I just thank you, because we don't get to thank the people behind. I mean, I've thanked. Jimmy Wales, but we don't normally get to thank the people who really are doing the day-to-day work on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is the greatest thing ever. I donate to it every month. We use it like crazy and it's people like you kind of unsung volunteers. It's a miracle. It's a miracle, Let me ask you too. Yeah, I love it.\n\n0:08:01 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nYeah, when you started, was that the time when librarians were still saying oh, beware of Wikipedia.\n\n0:08:07 - Molly White\n\nOh yeah, I mean they still are. Even more than yes, but I would say they had more reason to back then too. It was definitely more nascent.\n\n0:08:17 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nI don't hear that much anymore. I think that Wikipedia is now a miracle of human knowledge and, with the obvious caveats, an incredibly trusted source.\n\n0:08:29 - Molly White\n\nI think, yeah, I think librarians and educators have gotten more understanding about it and they recommend to use it as, like you would any encyclopedia or that kind of tertiary source, look at the references section and cite from there that kind of thing.\n\n0:08:47 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nIf I may, I'm curious now. So I say this with the highest honor Did your nerddom start with Wikipedia?\n\n0:08:57 - Leo Laporte\n\nRemember, we're all nerds here, so it's not an insult?\n\n0:09:00 - Molly White\n\nOh no, it's a term I use for myself, yeah yeah, yeah.\n\n0:09:04 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nDid it start with technology or Wikipedia, Would you say? Where were you nerdy first?\n\n0:09:11 - Molly White\n\nThat's a great question, probably with Wikipedia, honestly. Well, I mean, I always was the kid who wanted more time on the computer, so, and actually I was writing like sort of mini websites on Neopets before. Wikipedia oh yeah.\n\n0:09:28 - Leo Laporte\n\nI think maybe I had technology first. That's what I wanted, but it's between my Technically, that was my first HTML.\n\n0:09:35 - Molly White\n\nExactly.\n\n0:09:35 - Paris Martineau\n\nOn Neopets.\n\n0:09:36 - Molly White\n\nIt was even my special Neopets. Yeah, a shocking number of people in my sort of like computer science class in college got their start on Neopets, so I think we have Neopets to thank for, like my generation of web developers.\n\n0:09:52 - Leo Laporte\n\nActually, yeah, my daughter was into Neopets. It's still around, by the way.\n\n0:09:57 - Molly White\n\nSo I heard they tried to get into crypto briefly.\n\n0:09:59 - Paris Martineau\n\nI should have chagrined over there for me, I think, because of crypto. I think it's the 25th anniversary this year.\n\n0:10:05 - Leo Laporte\n\nI guess next year yeah, counting down, get ready. Mirror 267 days we're almost as old as Neopets Twitter's. So anyway, molly, you are almost a visionary when it comes to a crypto and web through. When did you start? Web three is going just great.\n\n0:10:28 - Molly White\n\nIt was in late 2021.\n\n0:10:30 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt was like December 2021, I think it's when I first so people kind of knew that maybe web three was hyped by that point.\n\n0:10:38 - Molly White\n\nBoy, I didn't feel like it no there was a lot of life.\n\nI felt like I was swimming upstream for a while with that website. But yeah, I mean it was. It was starting to get to the very inflated levels I would say. But things you know, we're still pretty high up there for a while. But actually, if you look at it, I almost like I looked back at the timing one time and one of my first tweets ever about crypto or web three was like almost perfectly the top of the crypto market. So I like I called it pretty closely.\n\n0:11:11 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd it's been all downhill. It's your fault.\n\n0:11:13 - Paris Martineau\n\nMaybe some might blame you, I think, I think it might be has, Wow yeah you started it right in between the period of board a NFTs and Facebook changing to meta, which is really just, you know, the apex of web three.\n\n0:11:29 - Molly White\n\nYeah, it was definitely. It was like I had finally gotten so sick of reading about it that I was like I have to do something.\n\n0:11:36 - Leo Laporte\n\nI love it. By the way, molly's Twitter handle is is also a geeky joke Molly's zero X, f, f, f, which, of course, is hex for white. Shouldn't it have one more F, though? No?\n\n0:11:50 - Molly White\n\nwell, it could have six, or it can have three, since they repeat OK, I would three, just make it shorter.\n\n0:11:56 - Leo Laporte\n\nLet's make it simpler. Yeah, very nice. By the way, your timing is good because my, my good friend, kevin Rose, is 47 today. Happy birthday, kevin. And he got a nice big birthday present on February 16th. Kevin is the founder of the proof collective. Along with people and some other NFT folk, they created something called Moonbirds, which wasn't even like the first. There were board apes before them and there were what was the crypto punks. In fact, I remember Kevin was so proud that he owned some very valuable crypto punks. So a couple of years ago, he formed the proof collective and created Moonbirds, including mythics, oddities, eggs, grails and, as I remember, in the first I think it was a month he made $50 million, so much so that Kevin had to make a video saying wait, wait, we're going to use that money for good stuff. Anyway, I don't know what happened to Moonbirds, but I know what's happened to Kevin All those shmucks Because he just sold it to you, galab, the creators of the board apiak club. They won't say for how much. Oh God.\n\nDo you have any idea, molly, how much he got for that, I wonder I don't know it's probably, by the way, like hashtag shady business.\n\n0:13:26 - Speaker 6\n\nJust in case you're wondering.\n\n0:13:30 - Leo Laporte\n\nProbably it was a fire sale. I can't imagine. Nfts are pretty much over, aren't they? Nobody's? Nobody thinks there's any value in these things anymore, right.\n\n0:13:39 - Molly White\n\nI mean you would be surprised at how much these, at least ostensibly, are trading for these days. There's some sort of blue chip NFT collections, like the board apis, for example, that still change hands for people's dollars yeah. Not, not at the levels that they once were Like. You probably won't hear about a million dollar board ape transaction anymore, but they're definitely still spending more money than you might expect.\n\n0:14:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nJust just so, people understand you're not buying anything at all except the nominal ownership of one of these low res cartoons.\n\n0:14:17 - Paris Martineau\n\nHey Leo, that's a right clicker mentality. These things are worth a lot.\n\n0:14:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nI am a right clicker, I'm an old yeah, what's. How much is 2.28 Eastworth nowadays? That's a lot. That's still money.\n\n0:14:28 - Molly White\n\nIt's. Yeah, I mean that's pushing $10,000 these days, wow.\n\n0:14:32 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's the most valuable, of course, because he's got a cowboy hat, number 762.\n\n0:14:38 - Molly White\n\nI have to say I do think the moonbirds are cuter than the board apes.\n\n0:14:41 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nI will give them credit. The apes are vaguely racist, not a hard scale.\n\n0:14:46 - Leo Laporte\n\nI think you can make a decent case that the apes are a little bit racist, aren't they?\n\n0:14:50 - Molly White\n\nAnd there's I've certainly heard people made that kind of case yeah.\n\n0:14:53 - Leo Laporte\n\nThere's Nazi symbolism in some of it, and it's it's a little anyway.\n\n0:15:00 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nIs Gary Vader Chuck still gung-ho as his, his want?\n\n0:15:06 - Molly White\n\nAs far as I know he's, he's certainly still talking about it, but I don't know if it's his primary. I wonder he's a good friends with Kevin.\n\n0:15:14 - Leo Laporte\n\nI wonder if he was part of the proof collective. He might have been. It was a number of number of people. There is an art angle on this, right I mean. In fact, initially we thought maybe this would be a valuable way to support, kind of to be a patron of the arts, to support artists. I, I have a beautiful remember, the fail whale, probably before your time.\n\n0:15:43 - Paris Martineau\n\nYes, I remember well when you were in kindergarten. Yeah, the fail whale looms large in my memory.\n\n0:15:50 - Leo Laporte\n\nLeah. So, okay, good, All right. So the fail whale was actually from a drawing by a great artist, Yi Ying Lu, and she had drawn it before. Twitter actually stole it. Basically she had drawn it before, but, and we have. She drew for us, my wife and me. She drew us one of these. We have it on our wall. We wanted to buy some others.\n\n0:16:14 - Paris Martineau\n\nAnd now she has a custom fail.\n\n0:16:16 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, I can't remember if it's a fail, wait something from Yi Ying, but anyway, yes, she brought it to us. We had her on the show some years ago, but you can't buy her stuff physical anymore. We wanted to buy some more. You can only buy NFTs Now. Maybe she's changed her tune by now, but yeah, that's weird. But I would support her because she's a great artist and it's fun. But I would prefer to buy something I can hang on the wall. And printing out a moonbird and putting on the wall just doesn't have the same cashier you can buy one of those TVs that shows NFTs now, oh yeah, nftv, nftv.\n\nOh geez, that's our next million dollar business idea.\n\n0:16:58 - Molly White\n\nI don't know why I didn't go with that branding, because I've heard about the NFTVs but I've never heard the call of that, it's a missed opportunity.\n\n0:17:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd I'm looking at when I go to the proof, collective proofxyz I see really exhibitions of I know it's not great art, but they're trying their best.\n\n0:17:20 - Paris Martineau\n\nNo, I'm serious.\n\n0:17:22 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis is a vision, a first solo exhibition by Otherworld. Anyway, happy birthday, Kevin. I hope you buy a very large birthday cake for yourself.\n\n0:17:34 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nProbably all he'll get for it.\n\n0:17:36 - Molly White\n\nI feel really it's like an NFT of a birthday cake.\n\n0:17:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh yeah, that's right, let's not actually bake.\n\n0:17:41 - Paris Martineau\n\nLet's not bring this into the physical world.\n\n0:17:44 - Leo Laporte\n\nMolly, when are you going to do AI is going just greatcom.\n\n0:17:49 - Molly White\n\nI get asked that a lot. It's not on my to-do list but I do try to point people to there is a project called the AI Incident Database which is really quite valuable. Oh. I do love that. Yeah, it does sort of a similar thing. It doesn't have the sort of sarcastic editorializing that I put into my stuff, but it does a good job of capturing some of the going great of the AI world.\n\n0:18:16 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nSo you both know of F Company.\n\n0:18:19 - Molly White\n\nYes.\n\n0:18:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nBy Pud Philip Kaplan.\n\n0:18:22 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nDo you know that Paris?\n\n0:18:24 - Paris Martineau\n\nNo, what is F Company?\n\n0:18:26 - Speaker 6\n\nOh, wow.\n\n0:18:26 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nThis was a great website. Well, that's actually a TV show. We're going to have F Company. It's an F-T company. I would say it out loud.\n\n0:18:33 - Leo Laporte\n\nSpread it out, you know, in the vernacular of the streets F.\n\n0:18:36 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nCompany was a show that Leo could probably show you a clip from, but we can reminisce about, but we won't go there. So it was the web. It was the 2000 crash all of the companies that just exploded.\n\n0:18:53 - Paris Martineau\n\nOh, it's a parody of fast. No, it's not a parody, yeah.\n\n0:18:57 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, the name was, but what it was made up of was memos from these companies, real memos.\n\n0:19:03 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nYes, actual foldings and layoffs.\n\n0:19:06 - Paris Martineau\n\nOh, I love this, oh it was great.\n\n0:19:08 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nI have a mug somewhere here from F Company. I remember.\n\n0:19:11 - Leo Laporte\n\nPud's telling me.\n\n0:19:12 - Paris Martineau\n\nThat's great.\n\n0:19:14 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat his goal in life was to create a series of sites like this, that he didn't have to do. Once he created it he didn't have to do anything, that all the content would be provided by people sending in memos, and so forth. It's interesting because F Company was started in 2000, during the bust, and went out of business in 2007, right about when Twitter started to ascend, and, in a way, pud was a genius, because isn't that, after all, what Facebook, twitter, reddit are is the next generation of you. Do all the work, we'll collect the money. Basically, speaking of which, reddit has signed a deal with an unknown AI entity for $60 million a year. We know the number because they're headed towards an IPO to ingest their content, our content. Oh, did I say their content, our content?\n\n0:20:08 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nIs there a furor over that?\n\n0:20:11 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou know, I don't. No, there isn't. I think people don't yet really Haven't really ingested the notion, even with what happened to Twitter, that these companies are really just using you. Youtube does the same thing, right, and they highlight the people, all the people like it.\n\n0:20:28 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nYoutube shares revenue.\n\n0:20:30 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, they highlight the hundred or so people who make money, but I could tell you, I mean, most of us on YouTube are not making a lot of money.\n\n0:20:39 - Molly White\n\nOr AI companies not already using Reddit's data? Yeah, I would have just assumed that that was a part of the big corpus that they all used.\n\n0:20:47 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nWell, they, like Medium, turned off the robotstxt for AI companies. The AI companies say they're respected, but while they're right, You're probably right. What was it for the original training sets?\n\n0:21:00 - Paris Martineau\n\nRight yeah.\n\n0:21:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo maybe Well.\n\n0:21:03 - Paris Martineau\n\nI do think it's important to know you're on a podcast with two AI accelerationists here. Leo and Jeff have been read.\n\n0:21:10 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nHey, there's no, there's kind of just one Okay.\n\n0:21:13 - Paris Martineau\n\nJeff, you've been getting over there, I'm gonna be honest, I'm putting you in the bucket.\n\n0:21:19 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nI am no Andreessen, I still have my fingers.\n\n0:21:22 - Paris Martineau\n\nI am the sole person with a brain cell remaining here, whoa.\n\n0:21:26 - Molly White\n\nThe doomer, as they call it, yeah.\n\n0:21:29 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo Molly was a doomer, in fact. I thought the whole thing was just spicy auto correct For the longest time, and then I started creating little GPTs and stuff and I got one over and then, very famously, I went on a walk with an AI accelerator.\n\n0:21:44 - Paris Martineau\n\nYou went on a walk with like Sam Oltman or something it wasn't anybody's face.\n\n0:21:47 - Speaker 6\n\nHe won't tell us who it was, but you went on a walk and he came back, a changed man With a guy who was from San Francisco.\n\n0:21:53 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt was absolutely an AI accelerator. I figured that out and he convinced me. Over this hour period, over this two mile walk, that Deutized Leo. That it's, you know, the thing that stays with me. I think about all the time he says the next 10 years are going to be really weird. He also.\n\n0:22:12 - Paris Martineau\n\nThat is the thing that convinced you I could go with that Leo.\n\n0:22:19 - Leo Laporte\n\nBut in a good way. He also said it's going to be like first contact with an alien species. Oh for Christ's sake.\n\n0:22:30 - Paris Martineau\n\nSee.\n\n0:22:30 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nParis, I'm not the life of. Leo.\n\n0:22:32 - Paris Martineau\n\nIt's now. Leo and Jeff both think that AI should have access to everything, and AI is right, I do think that's where she's been.\n\n0:22:40 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nSee, she's the writer for the site and does one of the precious words used to trade the machine we got the answer she's actually.\n\n0:22:48 - Paris Martineau\n\nI don't think we should give this stuff away for free to mega corporations.\n\n0:22:51 - Leo Laporte\n\nSee, here's the difference.\n\n0:22:52 - Molly White\n\nI mean, I've been writing Wikipedia for a long time. Yeah, you like giving it a round and you're the only copyright.\n\n0:22:59 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nYeah, I gear Paris.\n\n0:23:01 - Paris Martineau\n\nI'm not a copyright hag. I'm going to put that in my Twitter.\n\n0:23:05 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nThat's so mean, joe Esposito.\n\n0:23:07 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo mean I think you could make the case that Jeff and I are at the end of our creative ropes. I got books coming out, and so we care a little bit less than you younger people who have many years ahead of you and you will hope to make a living on your conscience.\n\n0:23:29 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nNo, like Molly, we're generous. I'd like you, paris, behind the high paywall Famously ungenerous.\n\n0:23:35 - Leo Laporte\n\nYes, as I move more and more of our stuff behind a paywall. Hey you just lose some shows out from the paywall.\n\nWe did it. Really, I dislike paywalls, I really do, and I it's funny because I'm also a utopianist I think Wikipedia is the best example of what the internet hath wrought. I mean, it's incredible. And yeah, there's mistakes and there's errors in Wikipedia. For a long time my Wikipedia article said I wrote for Hustler magazine Not true, but it's self-correcting. The people like Molly who put that energy in to make sure that content is good, there is an amazing gift. I mean, that's all volunteer work, right, molly?\n\n0:24:23 - Molly White\n\nYou don't get paid to do that Right, that's correct.\n\n0:24:26 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nDid I tell you my Wikipedia story, what the student thought from it? No no. One day I'm walking down the hall at school, student comes out and we're excited and says Jeff, jeff, I just read on Wikipedia that you're polyamorous. Would you like to join a coven? Well, yeah. So I said no. Can you correct that for me, because I can't do it?\n\n0:24:52 - Paris Martineau\n\nThat's very funny.\n\n0:24:53 - Leo Laporte\n\nI am always very I've never touched my Wikipedia page. I'm always very careful not to do that. I think I may be unique in that regard, because I think there are a lot of people who are especially politicians, who are going in there pretty regularly fixing their stuff up. Every once in a while you come across a page, you read it and it's that's definitely. The company wrote that.\n\n0:25:16 - Paris Martineau\n\nThat's terrible. Yeah, I like when it has a little note up top that it's like.\n\n0:25:20 - Molly White\n\nthis reads like the company wrote yeah, the shame banner that goes up there.\n\n0:25:28 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, always read the talk section on any page that you have suspicion about, because people like Molly are very good at that Indicating. I wonder what they say here. It's a B class. I'm a B class in the.\n\n0:25:44 - Molly White\n\nA B class of writing is a B class.\n\n0:25:46 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh well, I didn't write it so I don't take responsibility. A photograph should be included, Can? I send them a photograph. Look at that header though? What's the header here?\n\n0:25:57 - Molly White\n\nIf you scroll down you've got kind of a salacious oh my goodness, oh, that's interesting.\n\n0:26:08 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo there's a bait about sex scandals to go in here right Back in 2011. Yeah, by the way, if you're waiting for sex scandals about me, you got a long way to. I wish there were, but anyway, this is interesting. Huh, I actually haven't looked at this. Probably shouldn't look at it on here either, but no, I think this is. What's great about Wikipedia is and it works. How come it works when so much else is crap?\n\n0:26:40 - Molly White\n\nIt's honestly such a good question. I don't think any of us know.\n\n0:26:45 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd the other thing about it is there's a very small number of editors. Right, it's a small number of people keeping this afloat.\n\n0:26:52 - Molly White\n\nVery small in terms of people who edit regularly, but we get a lot of people right, but there are a lot of people who will edit once or fix a typo when they see it, and so there's a substantial amount of that as well.\n\n0:27:07 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nDo they love the teachers? Who bring classes in to do it. Students feel very empowered when they do it.\n\n0:27:13 - Molly White\n\nYeah, some in college professors have started having students write Wikipedia articles for coursework and stuff like that too, which is really interesting.\n\n0:27:23 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo you don't have any theories about why Wikipedia has survived.\n\n0:27:30 - Molly White\n\nI do. I mean, I think it helps that it's a non-profit. You know, a model like this I don't think would work well as a for-profit entity. You know people, I think it was partly timing, you know it emerged at a time where there was a need for something like this. And then you know, I think, that a project like this really sort of plays to people's sort of altruistic impulses, where you know people want to be able to help when they see something that's wrong or you know that's missing from an encyclopedia, and so it attracts people who have that kind of impulse and are really strongly motivated to keep it. You know this sort of beautiful resource that they want it to be. But yeah, I mean, I think it's really unique.\n\nI think a lot of platforms have tried to emulate it and have really not had a very successful time of it. I remember when Twitter was debuting there I guess it was Used to be called Birdwatch, now it's Community Notes, I think and they were like, yeah, it's going to be just like Wikipedia and people are going to go out of their way to write good facts to fight off the bad facts. And I was like, oh, good luck. You know, now it's sort of become a. It works sometimes, but you see a lot of sort of missing pieces in there.\n\n0:28:49 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, one of the sites I think about is Quora, which was, I thought, a really interesting idea. People ask questions and then answer them, and it's also volunteers. They're under kind of a salt from AI. Same with a stack. Quora has a bad how does Quora make money?\n\n0:29:09 - Paris Martineau\n\nIs it just ads?\n\n0:29:11 - Leo Laporte\n\nI think it's ads. It's just raised $75 million. From what, really?\n\n0:29:18 - Molly White\n\nWhy? From Andreessen Horowitz? Nice, of course. Oh my gosh, andreessen.\n\n0:29:22 - Paris Martineau\n\nHorowitz, isn't there something better you could be doing with your money? No, this is.\n\n0:29:26 - Leo Laporte\n\nAI. This is their whole thing.\n\n0:29:28 - Paris Martineau\n\nI have a poll Poe is a chatbot For their AI chatbot.\n\n0:29:32 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd the idea, of course, is Poe is taking all of the stuff that people contributed to Quora and turning it into a chatbot right.\n\n0:29:41 - Paris Martineau\n\nPoe will be the go-to chatbot for asking how is babby formed?\n\n0:29:46 - Molly White\n\nHow do women get pregnant?\n\n0:29:49 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat was Yahoo questions. Let's be fair, right, we've come a long way since then.\n\n0:29:55 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nSo in 2005, I went to an event at Harvard with bloggers and the New York Times was there and Jimmy Wales got into it with Gill Abramson, then the managing editor of the paper. She said you don't understand how expensive it is to have a bagged up bureau. And Wales then said and I'm quoting this in my next book he said five years ago, if I sat here in front of this group or any other group and we discussed the exacto pedia Britannica which are the latest numbers I can find now, in 1996, they had a budget of 350 million. And if I said to you, I'm going to get together a whole bunch of people on the internet and we are going to write an exacto pedia that is going to kick butt on a second people Britannica you would have said that's crazy. How could you possibly do that? It would cost you millions and millions of dollars. It didn't cost millions and millions of dollars. We did it. I love that spirit.\n\n0:30:43 - Paris Martineau\n\nPretty powerful and Jimmy.\n\n0:30:45 - Leo Laporte\n\nWales has always said you know, I mean people said you could make a billion dollars a year if you'd take advertising.\n\n0:30:50 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nI remember Jason Calacana is yelling at him. Yeah Say, you should put ads you're wasting.\n\n0:30:57 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo who wins now? I think in hindsight, Jason was the idiot and Jimmy was the bright guy by the way, not just in hindsight, not just at the time, even slight, had an article this month about Quora dying, because this is exactly what hasn't happened to Wikipedia Users are leaving, it's flooded with spam and bots and low quality stuff. Is it because Wikipedia exists that Quora couldn't, or is it because there's? They took ads, or is it just like?\n\n0:31:33 - Paris Martineau\n\nQuora is fundamentally very different than Wikipedia. Yeah, I don't think it's there in the same question, is it?\n\n0:31:40 - Molly White\n\nnot just the existence of Wikipedia precludes something like Quora. I think they're two fairly different use cases, but yeah, I mean, I think there's definitely two different models there. I think one thing that helps when you're talking about volunteers is with Wikipedia, I don't feel like some big corporation is making money off of the work that I put into that, whereas with something like Quora or, you know, community notes on Twitter, it's like why am I doing this for free for a company that is profiting from my contributions, exactly.\n\n0:32:16 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nYeah, the other thing too is that aboutcom was really the first competitor, commercial competitor to Wikipedia.\n\n0:32:21 - Leo Laporte\n\nSame idea right, but also commercial yeah.\n\n0:32:24 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nYeah, if people are asking questions, we're going to have the answers. Right Was the idea, so we had guides right and I can some full disclosure, as I consulted for them when the times bought.\n\n0:32:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt was an SEO play right. The idea was it was absolutely, it was the first SEO play Yep, that's one of the times.\n\n0:32:37 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nBought them was to learn SEO, and so it was trying to play that game. Others learned that from them. That created the content farms that ruined it for everybody. That was the Panda update to Google search.\n\n0:32:49 - Leo Laporte\n\nThe first big update that our friend met cuts yeah, degraded all of that, whereas Wikipedia always stood apart.\n\n0:32:57 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nIt was a different thing. It wasn't trying to play a game.\n\n0:32:59 - Leo Laporte\n\nBless it, we're here with answers. It's. Somebody's got a, I don't know. Is there a documentary? Is there? I feel like this needs to bunch of books, yeah, because it's such a case study in what the internet could be. Yes, and there's an ask and there's somebody poses so many questions about why and how you get communities to do this. I think it also tells you that people are fundamentally good, that they will act.\n\n0:33:29 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nbefore I included my book, our Wikipedia, craigslist, reddit and WordPress yeah, our examples, I think, of the web done fairly right. Which book the web we weave coming out. This fall from basic books.\n\n0:33:44 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, as long as we're plugging, Molly Wood has a newsletter. Molly Wood Molly White. I used to work with Molly Wood, Molly White has a newsletter.\n\n0:33:52 - Molly White\n\nI get confused with her fairly regularly.\n\n0:33:55 - Paris Martineau\n\nI know Molly Well she's she's different Molly, molly Well, molly Wood and Molly.\n\n0:34:03 - Leo Laporte\n\nMolly Well was my favorite, though right, I love Molly Molly White's newsletter. I'm so sorry, is citation needed? And if you want to subscribe, please do by going to citation needednews.\n\n0:34:18 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nHave you been approached for a book on your site, Molly?\n\n0:34:23 - Molly White\n\nI have not.\n\n0:34:24 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nNo, I'm surprised, I think. I think there's one in the. I think it's a fun one. Actually, I will start with F company and go through.\n\n0:34:32 - Molly White\n\nOh, you mean on on web three is going just great. I see yeah yeah, yeah, I have been approached for a book. I'm at a couple of times, but I don't know. It didn't really speak to me. It didn't feel like I could sort of tell that there was going to be a flood of the crypto crash books which there have been, and I didn't necessarily feel like you know they're needed to be another one for me specifically.\n\n0:34:58 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nI think there's something bigger here. I think it's. I think it's about boys and their stupid ideas.\n\n0:35:03 - Paris Martineau\n\nI think that there's a great book on boys and their stupid ideas. Yeah, yeah, and also kind of the the cult of Silicon Valley ambition.\n\n0:35:12 - Molly White\n\nYeah, yeah, I've written more broadly about that. You know I've written a little bit about some of the venture capital stuff, some of this weird like Silicon Valley ideology that has emerged but all in sort of shorter formats.\n\n0:35:29 - Leo Laporte\n\nWould you like to write a book?\n\n0:35:32 - Molly White\n\nI don't know it's a lot of work. I like I like the, the short form format, a lot, and I'm not sure Spoils a person. Yeah, I don't know if I would love to write a tweet recently about starting.\n\n0:35:45 - Leo Laporte\n\nI don't know if you're it was tongue in cheek, but you were quoting in the web about you should have your own blog and your own CMS and then but it looked like you were starting your first blog, right or no?\n\n0:35:55 - Molly White\n\nit's not my first blog, it's probably my 20th. Yeah, no, I've been working on a project to sort of do more of a if you know what like the posse approaches for the web post posts on your own site, yeah, yeah.\n\nYeah, so I've been working on a project to do a little bit more of that on my own website, to just call it, because I post in a lot of places but there isn't one good, like you know, unified place for it, and so I've been working on just a little project to tinker on in my spare time.\n\n0:36:31 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nWhich of the social networks do you like best?\n\n0:36:34 - Molly White\n\nI like. I'm right now. I like Mastodon and Blue Sky a lot and I don't know if I like one more than the other at this point and they're very different. What would you say?\n\n0:36:43 - Paris Martineau\n\nwhat instances on Mastodon are you in and how would you describe the difference tonally between Mastodon and Blue Sky?\n\n0:36:51 - Molly White\n\nSo I'm on the hacky-derm instance on Mastodon, which I think is the best one personally.\n\n0:36:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, I might disagree with you. I certainly like Twitter and social, also know hacky-derm is very good, but the nice thing is you can follow Molly White on any, on any of them, right? You don't have to right. You don't have to be on any of them.\n\n0:37:11 - Molly White\n\nYou don't have to join the hacky-derm one, but it is really nice.\n\n0:37:14 - Leo Laporte\n\nI think it's not as important, I think, because then then you get a certain personality from the people who are local, but you can still follow the rest. What makes hacky-derm good? Tell us why I should move everybody over to hacky-derm right now.\n\n0:37:32 - Molly White\n\nI think they've done well at moderation. It's a very sort of balanced approach. I think it attracts a lot of software people and I like software people on my timeline and I think a lot of them have really interesting things to say. You know a lot of like security folks who I always find very interesting. Even though that's not my own niche and I don't know, it just feels like a really friendly community to me, you know that's what I love about Mastodon you have that sense of a smaller community, but you can also follow people on every community.\n\n0:38:05 - Leo Laporte\n\nI think that's fantastic, and nobody owns it. Moderation's interesting because some sites are not well-moderated Right now. We're going through another one of those bad phases on Mastodon over the last few days where the smaller sites are letting spammers on and they're spam. I don't know if you guys experienced it, but I've had a swat about 30 or 40 spam accounts.\n\n0:38:27 - Paris Martineau\n\nYou've had to swat them. You called the FBI.\n\n0:38:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nI called the FBI and sent it to their homes Exactly.\n\n0:38:34 - Molly White\n\nOnly a handful. The only way. No, I just suspend their accounts.\n\n0:38:38 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nYou're a powerful than you know. No, I just suspend their accounts. It's all.\n\n0:38:42 - Leo Laporte\n\nI do. Here's Molly on Hackyderm. It's Molly also XeroXFFF at Hackydermio, I'm proud to say I was already following yes, as was.\n\n0:38:54 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nI.\n\n0:38:55 - Leo Laporte\n\nActually that's how I got it. I thought about getting Molly on the show. She followed me. I don't know why, but when I saw that I said, oh, maybe I can get her on the show. If I do that, oh, you do your own. Is it a show? Crypto critics corner? I guess show is the right word.\n\n0:39:11 - Molly White\n\nThat's not mine. I was just a guest.\n\n0:39:13 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, you're on it, okay.\n\n0:39:14 - Molly White\n\nYes, yeah. It's a wonderful podcast, though, for anyone who's looking for more crypto skeptics in their life.\n\n0:39:21 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nDo you find any about the hurt feelings of the crypto boys in you? They must come to you and just say you just don't want to. It's more hurt wallets.\n\n0:39:33 - Leo Laporte\n\nI would guess than hurt feelings right.\n\n0:39:36 - Paris Martineau\n\nYeah, it depends on the month.\n\n0:39:38 - Molly White\n\nYeah, I got a lot of that. I just don't understand it after two years or something like that my favorite one is well.\n\n0:39:50 - Leo Laporte\n\nthe technology, though the underlying technology, is really good, and you're conflating what people are doing with it with blockchain. Blockchain is so much going for it Every time, I say no, it doesn't.\n\n0:40:04 - Paris Martineau\n\nThe next 10 years are just going to be really weird. You don't get it? Hey, stop it. That's true.\n\n0:40:13 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah.\n\n0:40:14 - Molly White\n\nYeah, I get. Or the other one I love is it's still early, you have to get it some more time. It's been 15 years.\n\n0:40:23 - Leo Laporte\n\nI have to say one thing about pyramids it's a start yeah, yeah. Pyramid schemes. It can never be too early. It's too late, almost always by the time you hear about it, so don't do it, that's all. Do you think? Who do you think? Satoshi, nakamoto, nakamoto, what is it Nakatomi? No, that's a Nakamoto. We had it the first time. What is Satoshi? Do you think that Craig Wright is really Satoshi?\n\n0:40:51 - Molly White\n\nNo, Absolutely not. That's ridiculous.\n\n0:40:54 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah.\n\n0:40:56 - Paris Martineau\n\nI actually have an answer to this, which is for the long, like God. This is probably a year or two ago. Everyone at the information or at least all the reporters started getting the same weird email from someone being like, in all caps Like I know who Satoshi Nakamoto is, I know who he is. Like I might have gotten the same. Listen, I'm sure you did, because we also then got it on signal. You got LinkedIn messages and you clicked through. It was like I've put together all the clues.\n\n0:41:24 - Speaker 6\n\nOh God.\n\n0:41:26 - Paris Martineau\n\nIt's Elon Musk. Who else was in San Francisco at this time? They both use double spaces at the end of their pyramid Period. Clues are all there, people.\n\n0:41:39 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd if you add, I definitely got that same email.\n\n0:41:44 - Paris Martineau\n\nIt was a doozy. It really entertained me for quite a few weeks Wow.\n\n0:41:49 - Leo Laporte\n\nWow, we don't know who Satoshi is, but I think. Well, first of all, if Craig Wright were Satoshi, he's right now in a in a. He's suing somebody for libel, Is it, or I don't know? There's a court case.\n\n0:42:01 - Molly White\n\nThere's a there are a lot of court cases going on with Craig Wright, but I think he's actually being sued right now he's being sued, okay, and he has Dorsey by Jack Dorsey. What it's like. Yeah, it's a group that's funded by Jack Dorsey, among other people, that's suing Craig Wright because he keeps Craig Wright keeps filing basically IP lawsuits against Bitcoin developers and Jack Dorsey and all these people are really fed up with him basically scaring away the Bitcoiners or the Bitcoin developers.\n\n0:42:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis is the trial going on in England right now, and the thing is, wright could easily if he were Satoshi it'd be easy to prove you're Satoshi just move a fraction of a Bitcoin from one of those debt accounts.\n\n0:42:43 - Molly White\n\nWell, he claims that he destroyed the hard drives. Oh, isn't that convenient. It's very convenient. Yes, there's a lot of convenient explanations in this trial.\n\n0:42:55 - Leo Laporte\n\nThe fact that there is so much money in those early Bitcoin accounts, presumably controlled by Satoshi Nakamoto. If that's a person or group or what and they haven't been moved, they're worth billions. Does that imply that it was a person is gone or that they're sitting on it waiting for the waiting for it to go up, or what?\n\n0:43:18 - Molly White\n\nIt depends who you ask, but personally I think there's a reasonable chance that he's dead and that's why the money hasn't moved.\n\n0:43:27 - Paris Martineau\n\nOr also, I mean, if those accounts had any sizeable movement, like if someone suddenly started selling the Bitcoins in those accounts, bitcoin's worth would crash.\n\n0:43:39 - Leo Laporte\n\nYes, that's an interesting point yeah, it's 1.1 million Bitcoins, worth about well depends on the time of day, but about 30 to $40 billion. I don't know if I were Satoshi Nakamoto. If I'm some guy, he has to be some sort of cryptographer, mathematician. That's pretty sophisticated stuff. If I'm that person, you might just say well, I'll cash in right now and buy an island. That's what I'd do I mean? So what Right? What does he care if it crashes? You think he has some sort of vested interest in it succeeding, I don't know.\n\n0:44:24 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nAnyway, have you read Chris Texan's book Molly.\n\n0:44:28 - Molly White\n\nI have. I wrote a review of it. Actually, what?\n\n0:44:31 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nyou had, what did you think?\n\n0:44:33 - Molly White\n\nI did not enjoy it.\n\n0:44:35 - Leo Laporte\n\nTell us first of all what it is and who he is, and all of that, chris Dixon.\n\n0:44:40 - Molly White\n\nYeah, so Chris Dixon is a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nHe does a lot of their crypto investing and there has been a lot of it, and he recently wrote a book called Read Right Own, which is basically laying out his philosophy and his belief that there have been two eras of the web thus far.\n\nThere was the read era, in the sort of earlier days, and then the right era with the advent of social media and things like that that have made it easier for more people to post online. And his theory is that the third era of the web will be the own era, which will be enabled by blockchain technology. And so he writes this manifesto kind of on how blockchains will somehow become the future of the web and enable all of these wonderful things that we currently are not able to do. And it's sort of half this I don't know sort of revisionist history of the web in my opinion and sort of screed against big tech and a lot of the same tech companies that Andreessen Horowitz has funded. And then it's a half you know this very hand wavy vision of what blockchains could enable around. You know paying artists better and you know creating communities around interests and fair AI and all these different things like that. But I can't stand about that, sorry, no, continue.\n\n0:46:17 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nWhat I can't stand about that is that I just want we should be going away from everything being behind paywalls, unless, of course, it's Paris is writing to more open world and so that the whole blockchain NFT argument is everybody can own something they can sell it right, and it's the beginnings of copyright that turned everything into a tradable asset, rather than the joy we had on the Internet of doing like you would look at media doing things where other people sharing learning, all that nice kind of crunchy, wonderful stuff.\n\nThose guys want to just put a wall around everything.\n\n0:46:58 - Molly White\n\nIt's also fascinating because Dixon gives some sort of lip service towards the open web. You know he speaks positively of Wikipedia, he you know he talks about things like that. And then he speaks about blockchains being sort of this future version of the web. So it's, it's. There's a lot of right. Yeah, there's a lot of that in the book where it's like I don't get from A to B here, Like how are you drawing this conclusion? I?\n\n0:47:27 - Leo Laporte\n\nthink there's also some suspicion, like with Marcus Streason's weird manifesto a few months ago. There's always some suspicion that these guys have all these investments in these technologies, that anything they say is is conditioned by their their own, you know, interest, financial interest in its success. But they're absolutely yeah, but, but I'll play. I'll play Chris Dixon for this episode. What about the vast number of unbanked people in developing nations for whom, you know, fiat currency isn't, isn't a good choice.\n\n0:48:05 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nBanks aren't available. Well, when I was in Nigeria, I know there's M-Pace.\n\n0:48:11 - Leo Laporte\n\nBut, but it doesn't. Doesn't a decentralized blockchain ledger system kind of benefit them Somehow? Hand waving?\n\n0:48:22 - Molly White\n\nMy biggest how.\n\n0:48:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nI'm waving Chris's hands.\n\n0:48:27 - Molly White\n\nOh that makes sense.\n\nSorry, I mean, I think the biggest problem with that argument is that when you say, okay, here's an unbanked community, we're going to solve problems for them by giving them crypto, that's not the same thing as giving them banking, and what they need is banking, and a lot of the services that you get in crypto are these sort of weird approximations of banking that don't actually have the benefits that you need.\n\nSo like a good example is you know people think about banks, they think about savings accounts, but you know it's really important that banks extend credit to people, and when people don't have access to that, crypto is not really giving it to them, because in crypto, lending is pretty much always over collateralized, which means that you have to have more assets than you're borrowing, and that's not really something that is solving problems for unbanked communities, who typically need more assets than they have. So you know, when you say, okay, we're going to give them crypto lending, you know that's that's basically solving a problem that they they typically don't have. They don't usually have piles of Bitcoin sitting around that they can take out loans against.\n\n0:49:38 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nBut in my rate that there's also a transaction cost that would, that has gotten worse yeah.\n\n0:49:43 - Molly White\n\nI mean, it depends very much on the, on the blockchain, but there are very high transaction costs.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, it depends, but yeah, the transaction costs are huge. You know the security ramifications are huge. You typically have to spend a lot of money to get you know into crypto to do whatever it is that you want and then back out of crypto because no one accepts. You know, bitcoin or Ethereum for a gallon of milk. There's privacy concerns, I mean, you know I can really go on, but you know, I think when we talk about solving issues for unbanked communities, it's it's a much better idea to look at the actual problems that they have and the reasons why they're unbanked and then go about addressing those problems, rather than starting with saying you know, I've got this blockchain company and I need to figure out what to do with it, which I think is how a lot of the industry has gone about things.\n\n0:50:42 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhat about Sam Altman and Worldcoin?\n\n0:50:44 - Molly White\n\nI thought that was oh my goodness, she's size.\n\n0:50:48 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nDid you have? To say that to the poor person.\n\n0:50:50 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo, for those that don't remember, we talked about it Altman is the spear, is sending the sphere around. That you give them your an orb, that you give them your iris reading and he gives you some Worldcoin, which is a cryptocurrency, and then it sounds like an old timey curse.\n\n0:51:08 - Paris Martineau\n\nYou give the orb your eye and you receive money in return Profit.\n\n0:51:14 - Leo Laporte\n\nI don't know, but it's, it's some. That's what's so interesting about all of this is somehow all hand waiving Lee interspersed with universal basic income and unbanked communities, and we're going to solve the world's problems. And oh, by the way, ai is going to mean infinite wealth, so we don't have to worry. And it's, it's what? Uh, unfortunately, jeff keeps calling test creole. Uh, we, I've got to get a better acronym. Maybe Molly would. Molly White couldn't create a better acronym than test for us.\n\n0:51:47 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nThat's a different crowd, right? Is it different crowd? I feel like there's all their old buddies I feel like they are, but but it, but it kind of advanced, oh um the world coin is a part of that boys became AI boys, but not all of them they're they're cousins.\n\n0:52:05 - Molly White\n\nMolly, would you disagree here that, in the terms of the the Venn diagram of all these people, I think there are people in the test creole movements who are crypto bros and who are AI people, um, but I don't know if they're necessarily completely overlapping circles.\n\n0:52:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nThere's an intersection in the Venn diagrams, but they're not a hundred percent. This is worse.\n\n0:52:25 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nIt came off it came off Molly's tongue with test creole Just came off. I know, I know Okay all right okay.\n\n0:52:32 - Paris Martineau\n\nTest, creole, we can get up, we can get a choir.\n\n0:52:36 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhat does it stand for?\n\n0:52:39 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nTranshumanism, uh, extoprianism, uh, singletarianism or whatever you say that, uh, uh, uh.\n\n0:52:48 - Paris Martineau\n\nTESC Cosmism, rationalism, effective altruism and long term we skipped the R, but yeah rationalism and then, and then long termism.\n\n0:53:01 - Leo Laporte\n\nI liked just making him do that every few months. It's good.\n\n0:53:05 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nUh. The other thing is that Emil Torres, uh, and. And Tim Nick Ebru, who came up with the acronym. That is also a chronology of it. One led to, the next led to, the next led to the next.\n\n0:53:16 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, that may be more accurate than saying there's, they're the same. That's just that they, uh, they evolved from one to the next, they evolved and and what.\n\n0:53:24 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nwhat Emil we should want to have on the show um is is really really good at is explaining, uh, how it really is. Uh, utilitarianism and eugenics that's what makes this so scary. That's scary.\n\n0:53:39 - Leo Laporte\n\nThese people, the eugenics word is scary Very.\n\n0:53:42 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nAnd it's, and he, he, they I'm sorry, emil's they. Uh, they are very convincing and and Emil was a long termist then saw the light and said, oh my God, what is this crap? And really has reported on it and dug into it Um and um.\n\n0:54:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo, yeah, what about let's actually let's take a little time out because, uh, I forgot to do that, but if we were to have ads, they'd go here. Um, we're, you're watching this week Google, uh, jeff Jarvis, paris Martino and our very, very special guest, molly White. Uh, of the web three is going just great. Her website, molly whitenet. Um, we were talking I want I we didn't completely get off of world coin, and then I want to talk about SPF. So there are currently, according to world coinorg, 3.5 million people who have scanned their irises in the orb Shmucks.\n\n0:54:45 - Paris Martineau\n\nIs your, are your eyes in the orb Leo.\n\n0:54:47 - Leo Laporte\n\nNo, my eyes are not in the orb.\n\n0:54:49 - Paris Martineau\n\nThat's actually really surprising to me. If you would have had some of the large sum of money. I would have bet that your eyes were in the orb.\n\n0:54:55 - Leo Laporte\n\nIf I had been at. The most of the orb eyes are over. There's some in South America they. This is a very nice map.\n\n0:55:01 - Paris Martineau\n\nThey. They don't know not a lot of. How have they brought you? Is it just one or are there multiple? That's where they tested.\n\n0:55:07 - Molly White\n\nA lot of the original software was in developing countries.\n\n0:55:11 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, yeah, I'm not done, though I like doing this.\n\n0:55:16 - Paris Martineau\n\nThat's you know that's that's another orb. That's for the money.\n\n0:55:22 - Speaker 6\n\nThat's where the eyeballs are.\n\n0:55:23 - Molly White\n\nThat's where the eyeballs are.\n\n0:55:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nThere's the orb. Is it all a scam? Yeah, I mean yes.\n\n0:55:35 - Molly White\n\nI don't think world coin. The convenient thing about world coin is they haven't actually said what they're trying to do yet, and so it's hard to say, well, they haven't done it because they haven't actually said what it is that they're doing.\n\n0:55:46 - Leo Laporte\n\nHere's what they say on their website. See if you can figure this out. World coin is designed to become the world's largest digital identity and financial network. Giving ownership to everyone. World coin aims to provide universal access to the global economy, no matter your country or background is that a place for every human to benefit in the age of AI. Well, I'm in Finally.\n\n0:56:15 - Molly White\n\nI've been following world coin for a while now and I think it's really interesting sort of how their messaging has shifted over the last handful of years, because they started out by saying, oh, we're going to solve these like crypto problems.\n\nThey were super focused on cryptocurrency and what's called the civil problem, which is where it's really hard to know for sure that there's only one unique person in a network, because it's so easy to just make a hundred crypto wallets and then you can have a hundred of so-called you in the network.\n\nSo that used to be what they talked up all the time when crypto was really big, but then crypto started to be kind of passe and now they're all about AI and they are talking about how you know they're going to be all these problems that AI is going to create that world coin will solve by providing this sort of universal basic income adjacent thing to people. And they've very much been able to play on the AI hype to try to market world coin, while also, you know Sam Altman is, you know, playing to both sides here where he is sort of creating the problem with AI, and you know his various efforts over in open AI world while then selling the solution to this problem, he says, is going to be requiring universal basic income in the form of, apparently, a cryptocurrency where you get your retina scant.\n\n0:57:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nThere's a certain synergy to creating the problem and solving the problem.\n\n0:57:42 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nThat's what journals do.\n\n0:57:43 - Leo Laporte\n\nThen solving the problem. There has been a blade I just saw an article in Wired about. Actually was an interview with Andy Greenberg, who's just written a book about or actually not just this a couple of years ago.\n\n0:57:55 - Paris Martineau\n\nHe's always writing a book, yeah.\n\n0:57:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis, but his point is that crypto is not as anonymous as people often think.\n\n0:58:05 - Paris Martineau\n\nI mean it's, yeah, you can very clearly track all the transactions. That's kind of the whole point.\n\n0:58:11 - Speaker 6\n\nYeah.\n\n0:58:13 - Molly White\n\nYeah, I mean depends. It's one of those things where, depending on who you ask and how you ask it, people will argue that it's both very anonymous and also not anonymous at all, and somehow those two things can both be true at the same time it's anonymous until you want to get your money out. Right or in, or in.\n\n0:58:32 - Leo Laporte\n\nBut if you, if you just let it float around, it's just a number, it's until you actually try to access. But that's what I've got. You know I happen to have eight Bitcoin in a wallet I can't access. Yeah, it's probably pretty anonymous.\n\n0:58:48 - Molly White\n\nI was just having this kind of argument with some Monero people because the Monero community, that Monero is a privacy coin and so they try to be much more anonymous than Bitcoin even tries to be. And recently law enforcement body claimed that they had traced some Monero. And then all these people in the Monero community were like no, no, no, they didn't trace it. Monero is. You know, the privacy of Monero is completely uncellied. It's just that he tried to cash out and that was where he went wrong, and it was like well as long as you don't try to use the money, you're perfectly safe.\n\n0:59:28 - Leo Laporte\n\nNow, meanwhile, again creating the problem and solving the problem. Sam Altman and world coin have this idea for a world ID which is a universal proof of personhood. All you need is this human. I would like to try to cross a border with this passport.\n\n0:59:50 - Paris Martineau\n\nThey immediately tackle you and bring you to it Very interested in what happens.\n\n0:59:56 - Leo Laporte\n\nDo you get a lot of arguments, Molly, with these people? I'm surprised that you even waste your energy on that.\n\n1:00:03 - Molly White\n\nI mostly don't. It's one of those things where, like, people want to argue the same thing over and over again and I don't have boundless energy for that, but everyone's been a while, I give in.\n\n1:00:14 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nYeah, it's hard Do you get tired of it. What's up? Are you tired of the topic yet? Do you see a day when you just say enough?\n\n1:00:23 - Molly White\n\nNot really. I find it pretty fascinating and I find the the pattern really fascinating of like hype in the technology world and playing on, you know, lay people's lack of understanding of technology, and so I think that is sort of that helps me have an enduring interest in it, even if some of the specifics are less interesting or changing underneath me.\n\n1:00:49 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nIs that a difference between web one and web three? Is the web one took VC's money and web three takes real people's money?\n\n1:00:57 - Molly White\n\nI think probably web two takes VC's money as well. But yeah, I mean, a lot of it's about the funding model and you know that's something Chris Dixon was sort of talking up in his book is how you can use crypto to really bootstrap projects in a way that people used to have to take venture money or you know some other source of funding, and he speaks about that like it's a good thing, but he sort of ignores the fact that losses also are impacting individuals in ways that they don't necessarily when it comes from VC. So you know he he was speaking of, like the helium project, which he doesn't disclose, but Andre St Horowitz is an investor in Again my problem with all of this?\n\nYeah, Right and how you know helium is created. You know they claim that they're creating this network through these sort of router type devices that people put in their homes, but he fails to mention that all of these people spent all this money on these devices, being told that you know you'll be able to use them to mine this cryptocurrency token and it'll pay for itself, and then you'll have this thing in the corner of your house that's just generating money for you, which people were very excited about, and then, of course, the token price tanked and people had put all this money into these pieces of hardware that they have no use for at this point, and it's those people who lost a lot of money, not Andre St Horowitz.\n\n1:02:26 - Leo Laporte\n\nI think Stacy, our our the predecessor to Paris as host on the show, had a helium router, right, Jeff, and she was at Bainbridge Island, so she had a lot of ship traffic going by and so they would. They would attach to her helium router, but this was all before the currency tank, so I wonder if she.\n\n1:02:47 - Molly White\n\nWell, and also the. The network that they were trying to bootstrap was for something called Lora WAN, which is a low energy sort of internet of things Long range, low energy, wild wired, wide area network.\n\nYeah yeah, she was a Luran fan. But they found I think the helium company discovered that there wasn't really that much demand for it and so, despite the company being valued at like over a billion dollars, they were getting like a thousand dollars of fees from people who are actually using the Lora WAN network. So they had to do this like last minute pivot to they call it 5G but it's not actually 5G. It's like this really weird sort of scamception type of thing.\n\n1:03:30 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah Well, you know anybody's been in the technology business for any length of time. I've seen a lot of things like this coming. It's not always malicious or malintent or greed or or a ripoff, sometimes it's just it didn't work. Seemed like a good idea at the time. You know, I think they were using Stacey's internet connection, so she's not only paying for the hardware but for internet connection. When she was on the show, she I think she was of the opinion she was making money, but I suspect she's not making money, yeah, but it was it was a little play, it was a small amount of money.\n\nShe was more interested in the technology of the Lora WAN technology. All right, we got some stories. Molly, if you want to stick around, we could. You, we can get your comments and all sorts of things, Would you? Would you like to join in From the UK?\n\n1:04:23 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nthe phone book. This is such an old fart story.\n\n1:04:28 - Leo Laporte\n\nI said the phone book is going the way of the fax machine. Of course this is from the Daily Mail, but it is not already no British telecom behind there, british telecom, for 150 years has been delivering a phone book to its customers. This is the original.\n\n1:04:47 - Paris Martineau\n\nWhat are people going to rip to show that they're very?\n\n1:04:50 - Leo Laporte\n\nstrong. This is. This is. This is the one that came to people's door this week. This is from Glasgow South. Our look at this final edition. Hold on to it forever. Our last book has landed at your door. 18 million of them Will be handed out all over the UK, but then that's it.\n\n1:05:15 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nSo I asked students oftentimes how many of them have used yellow pages and surprised more than I would have thought I've used yellow pages. Have you.\n\n1:05:23 - Paris Martineau\n\nYeah.\n\n1:05:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nFor actually looking stuff up.\n\n1:05:26 - Paris Martineau\n\nYeah, oh Paper yellow pages.\n\n1:05:28 - Leo Laporte\n\nI don't remember what it was, but yeah paper, yellow pages.\n\n1:05:30 - Paris Martineau\n\nI remember having to go through it all the time as a child and teen Wow.\n\n1:05:35 - Molly White\n\nYeah, they were definitely still a thing when I was a kid.\n\n1:05:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nI can remember I use whitepagescom all the time. Well, that was the funniest thing. There actually is a company called Yellow Pages and they tried to move to the web Like, oh yeah, that's what I'll do. I'm looking for the phone number of business. I'm going to go to yellowpagescom and look it up.\n\n1:05:56 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nWell, I hate to say it, but when I started local sites with Advance back in 2004, 2005, we thought, as a company, yellow pages is going to be it. We wasted a huge amount of money developing yellow pages software. Oh my God, we were trying to get the directories and trying to get the directories and the oh my God, because it was a beautiful business. Right, you had to be there. Right, if you butcher down the street was there and you're not there, you're going to suffer.\n\n1:06:23 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd you pay to be in it. So it was a fear cell to all these guys. Yeah, and you could buy a display. You could buy bigger or littler. Oh, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:06:31 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nAnd we could sell you a little art.\n\n1:06:33 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnother thing Google has ruined for the world. If it weren't for Google, we'd still have yellow pages. Rap Probably. Probably AI would even. No, it'll give you a little hallucinator.\n\n1:06:48 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nWell it's basically I'm writing about the California Journalism Preservation Act and it's basically if the yellow pages had tried to get back at Google, that's what it would be it's newspapers trying to get back. Yeah.\n\n1:07:04 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou ruined. You ruined our business model. Eric Canada thought it'd be a good idea to put a chat bot on their website so you know you could. You could ask it about fairs, book, book stuff, already book stuff and things like that.\n\nA fella named Jake Moffat is sad. His grandmother passed. He wanted to fly to Toronto to be there for the funeral. He went to Eric Canada's website to book a flight from Vancouver and he didn't understand it. There are every airline has a bereavement rate. So he asked the chat bot explain the bereavement rate. The chat bot went oh yeah. So he said. The chat bot said book the flight right now, as long as you ask for a refund within 90 days, we'll give you the money back. Well, it turns out, eric Canada, that way. They made that up. The chat bot made that up. Eric Canada's policy explicitly says you have, you can only get the refund before the flight's booked, not after. Moffat followed the request for months he tried to get Eric Canada to give him the refund. He even had a screenshot, smart man, of the chat bot.\n\n1:08:18 - Molly White\n\nTelling him I'm totally planned ahead. That's what I was really surprised about getting this.\n\n1:08:23 - Leo Laporte\n\nMaybe he was a little suspicious, I don't know. He did a screenshot.\n\n1:08:26 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nBecause Eric Canada is a jerk airline, so he couldn't believe that they were going to do this.\n\n1:08:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nI'm sure it says. Eric Canada argued that because the chat bot's response elsewhere linked to a page with the actual bereavement travel policy, moffat should have known bereavement rates could not be requested retroactively. So the best air Canada would do is promise an update to the chat bot. We'll fix that and give him a $200 coupon. They blamed the chat bot.\n\n1:08:55 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nThey said it's not our problem, the chat bot, they're the one who screwed up.\n\n1:08:59 - Leo Laporte\n\nEric Canada said the chat bot is a separate legal entity that's responsible for its own actions. The court Throw him through the shot, it was worth it. Court said no, in fact that's not true and you're liable, and Eric Canada did in fact give him a refund, and that's that they were forced to by the court.\n\n1:09:25 - Molly White\n\nYeah, I wonder what would have happened if he had convinced, like the chat bot, to give him a plane or something like what they have made him. Honor that too.\n\n1:09:34 - Paris Martineau\n\nLike that chat bot that was working for the car dealership right. That essentially kept making deals to sell a Tesla for $1 or something.\n\n1:09:45 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nNo, give backs right.\n\n1:09:47 - Molly White\n\nYeah, no, give backs. I hope everyone's screenshot of that and they can bring it to court.\n\n1:09:54 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, that's the advice screenshot everything. If a chat bot tells you, screenshot it. Yeah, this is the. This is the story of car dealership that added an AI chat bot to its site. Was a Chevrolet dealership. And this is the story from business insider Katie Natopoulos, writing. A car dealership added an AI chat bot to its site. Then all hell broke loose.\n\n1:10:21 - Molly White\n\nIs this the one that was writing code for people?\n\n1:10:23 - Leo Laporte\n\nYes.\n\n1:10:24 - Molly White\n\nYes.\n\n1:10:24 - Paris Martineau\n\nYes, yes.\n\n1:10:28 - Leo Laporte\n\nThey asked for Python code because he was powered by chat GPT so it can write Python code. Somebody bought a 2024 Chevy Tahoe for a dollar, by the way not legally binding, it turns out.\n\n1:10:44 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nOh what's interesting here is is is the debate over responsibility, because you have legislation in California being proposed saying that the model must be responsible for everything bad done with it. Then the next question is is the application layer? Is it? Is it air Canada making a bad application or is it the Schmuck lawyer who used it for his citations? And it's a really interesting discussion about who's responsible and who is the author.\n\n1:11:09 - Leo Laporte\n\nIn the lawyers case, the lawyer was the one who got fine, not chat GPT.\n\n1:11:13 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nYes, because the judge said when I covered it, you should have said the technology is not at fault here. Right, straight out Right, though I would argue that Microsoft was at fault for giving the lawyer the impression that he was going to get credible answers from it, as one would a search engine.\n\n1:11:36 - Leo Laporte\n\nHave you seen?\n\n1:11:37 - Paris Martineau\n\nsearch engines are never wrong.\n\n1:11:39 - Leo Laporte\n\nBy the way, you were mentioning Sam Almond. Am I misreading that? Is he asked? Is he trying to raise $7 trillion dollars?\n\n1:11:48 - Molly White\n\nI think he may have upped it to eight. That's evil. I don't know if you were serious.\n\n1:11:55 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis is to create AI chips. Yes. Trillion with a T.\n\n1:12:02 - Speaker 6\n\nTrillion.\n\n1:12:03 - Leo Laporte\n\nOkay, fine.\n\n1:12:05 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nSoftbank is going for 100 million to work on chips. Yeah.\n\n1:12:09 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, it's expensive, I acknowledge that, but it seems like an awful lot of money.\n\n1:12:14 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nIt's. The hubris is just incredible.\n\n1:12:17 - Paris Martineau\n\nIt's the power.\n\n1:12:18 - Leo Laporte\n\nWas he joking?\n\n1:12:18 - Paris Martineau\n\nChat GPT prompts.\n\n1:12:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nWas it, was it. Was it tongue and cheek.\n\n1:12:24 - Paris Martineau\n\nI don't think so.\n\n1:12:26 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nWhat is that?\n\n1:12:27 - Molly White\n\nI think he joked about making it eight after people Bawked at seven, but I think seven was legitimately what he was asking for.\n\n1:12:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nUnless the Wall Street Journal is lying. Sam Altman seeks trillions of dollars to reshape the business of chips and AI. Of course UAE has some money. Seven trillion, though, that must be over 30 years. I mean, what is that? What is the defense budget? The United States is not that high. That's a lot of money, kids, all right. How about Sora? This is their new open AI's new video from text. Now, I have to say, the videos I'm going to show you were generated by Sora without modification, according to the website, but they have not released the model. Still pretty impressive. This is the text prompt A stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street, filmed with warm, glowing, neon and animated city signage. She wears a black leather jacket, long red dress and black boots, and carries a black purse where sunglasses red lipstick. She walks confidently and casually, as street is damp and reflective, creating a mirror effect of the colorful lights many pedestrians walk about. This looks about right, although there is a certain AI I heard her arms too long.\n\nYeah, look at this hand.\n\n1:13:46 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nThey are pretty long, everybody's moving at the exact same speed. That hand is weird.\n\n1:13:51 - Molly White\n\nI also did you guys see, I think her arm is stretching. She walks so, but it's clearly right now it's AI.\n\n1:14:00 - Paris Martineau\n\nOne of these examples was a stylish colorful bird pecking about and someone's like, yeah, this looks good, but if you also look at, I think it was like Getty or something, which is one of the sources.\n\n1:14:11 - Speaker 6\n\nYou'll find a they have.\n\n1:14:12 - Paris Martineau\n\nthat's that bird they're like there is a photo that is like that bird exactly on Getty. So I think I'm curious, once they release more information about this model, how much of this is like existing content that they've just kind of animated in some way.\n\n1:14:29 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, notice, there is a bug of some kind. I don't know if it's the Getty watermark, but there's something in the lower right hand corner that is changing around. So maybe it is the Getty watermark. Still, this is, or maybe that's, sora, I don't know. I guess it's in all of them, some of it's, you know, hallucinatory there's a guy doing something. I think physically impossible.\n\n1:14:50 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nThere's a dog that goes from window to window in a way you just couldn't.\n\n1:14:53 - Molly White\n\nWell, and this guy that has like three legs.\n\n1:14:56 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd you can't. I don't know of any treadmills that go that direction.\n\n1:15:01 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nBack. Well, it could, it could create, it's a creation machine.\n\n1:15:05 - Paris Martineau\n\nIt could have it says weakness, sora sometimes creates physically implausible.\n\n1:15:10 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nThat is a weakness, Never the less a good post saying that, that, that, that, yeah, this, these, these pups were looking at all. There's three, there's four, there's five. It changes by the second.\n\n1:15:23 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's going to get very world over the next weird over the next 10 years.\n\n1:15:26 - Paris Martineau\n\nI told you that it's true, it's true 10 years, 10 minutes, 10 days.\n\n1:15:32 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nIt can't solve for time or space or causality, Cause it doesn't so when they're, when they're arguing that oh my God, I saw the stories. Oh, my God. Agi is just three weeks in the way now. I think it's what he actually said. Three months away it doesn't. It's not a real world model. That's the weakness of this. It has no sense of fact and text. It has no sense of reality here.\n\n1:15:54 - Leo Laporte\n\nArcheologists discover a generic plastic chair in the desert, excavating and dust.\n\n1:16:00 - Paris Martineau\n\nWhy is it hovering? It's moving. They're really concerning it's really creepy.\n\n1:16:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's really creepy, but you know what I want to see a movie made with all these clips. I think there would be some really somebody's going to in Hollywood's going to do this at some point. Just wild, weird. This is the world we're moving into. I don't need a micro dose, I can yeah. It's true.\n\n1:16:27 - Paris Martineau\n\nOh, this is haunting.\n\n1:16:29 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo this grandmother with neatly combed gray hair stands behind a colorful birthday cake with numerous candles at a wood dining room table. Expression is one of pure joy and happiness. The happy glow in her eyes. She leans forward and glows out the candles.\n\n1:16:44 - Paris Martineau\n\nThis video- feels like you're on acid. Yeah, all of it does.\n\n1:16:48 - Speaker 6\n\nDoesn't it all feel that way? She's got doll eyes.\n\n1:16:52 - Paris Martineau\n\nOf course she's got doll eyes. It's just like sweaty.\n\n1:16:55 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nSweaty, sweaty, grandma, all of this stuff had been positioned as a creativity machine, We'd be wild period the fact that they tried to make it act as if it could do anything real.\n\n1:17:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, it is early days, it is.\n\n1:17:09 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nIt's amazing.\n\n1:17:10 - Molly White\n\nI like watching the girl on the left.\n\n1:17:11 - Leo Laporte\n\nTry to figure out how to clap.\n\n1:17:14 - Molly White\n\nYeah, the hands and the pants.\n\n1:17:17 - Paris Martineau\n\nThey're so creepy.\n\n1:17:19 - Leo Laporte\n\nThey're so creepy. You know, this is. The cake is so short. Everything looks normal until you kind of move closely.\n\n1:17:27 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nShe has no breath. She's trying to blow out a candle. She blows but nothing happens to the candle it has no sense of causality.\n\n1:17:34 - Leo Laporte\n\nI did, like the one of that's a California, a footage of California doing the gold rush.\n\n1:17:40 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nIt looks like drywall.\n\n1:17:42 - Leo Laporte\n\nI'd be fooled by that, to be honest. Maybe it's because I'm an idiot, I don't know, but I you know, you could say I colorize things. It's an impossible shot.\n\n1:17:51 - Molly White\n\nI think one of the scariest things about this technology.\n\n1:17:54 - Leo Laporte\n\nThey had drones back then, didn't they?\n\n1:17:56 - Paris Martineau\n\nThat's true. Yeah, they had drones back then. Laos, You're right, but only in black and white. Go ahead.\n\n1:18:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nMolly Sorry.\n\n1:18:04 - Molly White\n\nI was just saying. I think one of the scariest things about the technology is not necessarily what it can produce, but the fact that it now introduces so much doubt into any video that you see. You know, I think we've seen that to some extent with AI generated, you know, still images, where now people will see images and they'll have to sort of double take and go is that AI or is that, you know, actually something that happened in real life? And that's what I really worry about with the video stuff as well, as, like now, everyone's going to look at a video with that sort of piece of doubt in their mind, wondering, you know, is this something I can trust or not?\n\n1:18:39 - Leo Laporte\n\nI think that's already happened, right. But I mean, should we stop it because of that? I mean that's not a reason to stop it.\n\n1:18:46 - Molly White\n\nNo, not necessarily, but I think that you know it's one of those things that we have to just be really cautious now about things that once were generally seen, as you know, a trustworthy source, you know. But I mean, I think if people can learn to be cautious about just believing everything they see, that's going to be a good thing. But I have some doubt as to whether or not you know an average people will actually learn that.\n\n1:19:14 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nI feel like this is a bit. New institutions will have to create new institutions. The in the Gutenberg parenthesis.\n\n1:19:19 - Leo Laporte\n\nI haven't plugged it for a few weeks. That's not the solution.\n\n1:19:22 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nin the Gutenberg parenthesis I told the story of the first alleged call for censorship by Niccolò Perotti in 1470. And he saw a shoddy translation of Pliny. He said to the Pope you got to do something. And what he was really asking for is not censorship at all, he was asking. He was anticipating the creation of the institutions of editing and publishing. Oh that kind of institution come as the yeah, as these needs arise, they come, and right now those institutions are inadequate to the scale of speech.\n\n1:19:52 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, molly is an expert in something more modern the institution of Wikipedia and the editing policies which is an example of an institution that was invented with an opportunity to deal with that I mean don't, don't, don't you all the time, molly, deal with false Uh information in Wikipedia, of course, yeah, absolutely.\n\nThat's one of the chief things, right? Um, here's an interesting article that got a lot of people sent to me, uh, from a site called house freshcom. This is a website, like many websites, that specializes in reviews, in this case, of air purifiers. The article, though, is interesting how Google is killing independent sites like ours, and I would say it's Google, it's not Google, I would say it's companies creating, now, with the aid of AI, uh, artificial content, and that's to follow on with what you're saying, molly. That's really we're going to be. We're in the midst of getting flooded. We got flooded with spam. We came up with some ways to deal with it, but spam never went away. That was a drip from the faucet compared to the tsunami, the flood of garbage information that is going to start to persist on the internet.\n\n1:21:06 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nLeo, I talked to somebody. Yeah, Go ahead. I talked to somebody who was at one of those companies that, uh, that used AI and was known for it I won't say who and they said you don't understand, Jeff. We're in a war over reviews, which is triply ridiculous, because I would think that a review of all things would be a human opinion, but it's not. It's this junk. It's this junk. I get the SEO. It's all about air purifiers. Yep, yeah.\n\n1:21:35 - Leo Laporte\n\nGiselle Navarro and Danny Ashton from housefreshcom provide a bunch of examples. They say big media publishers are inundating the web with subpar product recommendations. You can't trust Google heats it too.\n\n1:21:48 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nGoogle doesn't want this junk. They want to have decent search results.\n\n1:21:51 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, in fact, they don't know what to do. What they talk about is how Google, realizing there was a lot of you know kind of phony we tested 83 air purifiers and here's the best set up some standards for this, like there have to. You have to mention a lab, you have to mention the products, you have to show pictures of the testing, and so forth. So the problem is immediately these phony sites. They're actually, they're not phony sites, they're better. House and gardens, they're well known sites, better. Just said, okay, fine, and they and they filled it up with that kind of content and Google said, oh, okay, I guess it's real.\n\n1:22:31 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nIt's just like aboutcom. It's the same exact story. Yes, is it about? Did wonderful work, it was really good, and then the content farms ruined it for everybody. Same thing with Buzzfeed. Buzzfeed had really fun viral stuff. Then others learned the same trick there was no barrier to entry and then they ruined it for everybody, including Buzzfeed, who today had to sell half their business.\n\n1:22:52 - Leo Laporte\n\nThey mentioned Buzzfeed in this article.\n\nSo. So here is the example with better homes and gardens. Better homes and gardens never mentioned conducting tests prior to the Google product review update, july of last of 2022. You can see clearly and they have the screen captures always do the screen captures, kids on July 6. There were no mentions of air purifiers being tested by July 26. The day before the announcement of the Google update, they say, oh yeah, we tested 38. And then, with photos, which all are credited to somebody named Harry War, talk on multiple sites. It turns out these are all sites run by your favorite Meredith Jeff and Meredith Dot, dash, dot, dash, meredith, they call him now the owner of what's left of timing and what's left of Meredith.\n\n1:23:49 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nSo Dot dash Meredith hired a guy by the way, which is also the successor company to, about dot com, and it goes full circle.\n\n1:23:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt goes full circle. They hired this guy, Harry, to take these pictures and it appears. Look at all the places it appears health people, better homes and gardens, the spruce pets real simple. These are all basically websites pretending they did the testing, but they have. The tests are all from the same place with the same people. Wow, here's real simple. Here's people, Megan. Look at the matching with all credited to Harry War talk.\n\n1:24:27 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nWell, real simple, and people are in the same company.\n\n1:24:30 - Leo Laporte\n\nThe other thing is all that this is not advertising.\n\n1:24:32 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nThis is all affiliate revenue, yeah.\n\n1:24:35 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd incidentally, house freshcom Same thing they say, but we actually test. But they say at the very top it's affiliate. The way we pay for this is affiliate revenue.\n\n1:24:44 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nI wonder what's happened to the New York Times site to wire cut? Wire cutter. Yeah.\n\n1:24:48 - Leo Laporte\n\nOkay, I you know. I think there is a point that there is considerable pressure on these companies, especially since it's private equity companies that have bought up these companies and now need to pay off this huge debt they incurred to buy these companies. But there's pressure to generate income.\n\n1:25:07 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nThey're ruining the web and the internet for all of us. There's a lot of crap and it's got to get worse, and so that's what I you know people talk about. Ai was going to ruin Google and and chatbots. I don't think that's the issue. I think that the issue is the web is getting ruined and Google gets blamed for it. Google searches are as good as they used to be. That's because of this junk. So what happens to be able to, um, to change that?\n\n1:25:32 - Leo Laporte\n\nI don't know, in 2020, popular science was sold to a private equity firm, north equity LLC. This is also from the house fresh article. A year later, they introduced a new arm of their business that runs all the media brands they acquired and they they stopped printing a magazine. They've started putting up websites with phony reviews.\n\n1:25:55 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nSee that same thing right, yeah.\n\n1:25:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nNow the problem is and I think this is legitimate from house fresh is legitimate complaint. I think they're wrong saying Google is the problem, but it is hurting sites that actually do testing, that are independent sites. They just don't show up. They don't have the Google food that real simple and people magazine and better homes and gardens and popular science have, so they're not going to show up on those on those brands and that tells us a signal to Google.\n\n1:26:23 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nOh, it must be okay, they clicked on, it Is that is that how Google is enough.\n\n1:26:27 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo if you search for best air purifier for pet hair, uh, you're going to find all of those sites, but you're not going to find house freshcom. What do we?\n\n1:26:36 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nfind, let's look for it.\n\n1:26:37 - Paris Martineau\n\nLet me see what first comes up. First is a sponsored thing, but the first organic one is better homes and gardens.\n\n1:26:44 - Speaker 6\n\nThere you go.\n\n1:26:46 - Paris Martineau\n\nOne of the real simple spruce dash Meredith reddit Reddit Good.\n\n1:26:50 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, that's good, buzzfeed, buzzfeed.\n\n1:26:53 - Molly White\n\nI read the article, though. They talk about how Reddit's getting brought into this too, because now people are spamming reviews and things like that on Reddit.\n\n1:27:01 - Leo Laporte\n\nI've noticed that on Reddit. You really it's terrible. You can really tell to uh, certainly when somebody goes in there, science of the list. So it's very sad.\n\n1:27:12 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nIt is. It's our web and and they're messing it up. Well, there's business opportunities here. There's finding new ways to do things. I mean?\n\n1:27:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nwhat is Google's responsibility? Which are how does Google solve this, can they?\n\n1:27:25 - Paris Martineau\n\nI mean it's less a Google problem than more media. I mean, jeff can talk about this much more eloquent, wrote a whole book about this, but you know that media have for a long time relied on advertising revenue and that the bottom is not only fallen out of that, but it is like crumbled away, and so all of these companies are searching for something to fill that gap.\n\n1:27:47 - Leo Laporte\n\nWe should have. You know, matt cuts for a long time. Was that Google? He's been on the show many times in charge of fighting spam, fighting, uh, you know, click farms and things like that. Um, I'm sure there's some. There are people at Google, maybe Danny Sullivan's doing it, I don't know. There's still people at Google who are doing that. But uh, it's gotta be hard with a tsunami of crap. No effort, clickbait. It's very hard.\n\n1:28:10 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nYeah, and and, but I think that's the um I I'm going to do my other thing by other book. Thank you for the plug there.\n\n1:28:17 - Paris Martineau\n\nUh, paris in magazine I talk about listen, we gotta get the trifecta.\n\n1:28:21 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nI got him here, I'll have. I'll have galleys, the next one soon, um, jeff Jarvis $7 trillion in royalties just seven copies, People, seven copies, and it made me look good.\n\nUm, when media exploded with mechanization and industrialization in the mid 19th century, Harper's was invented to solve this. Harper's said there's a little, there's all this new stuff out there. We got to find the good stuff for you and I think that there'll be ways that people will be verified as actual product testers and there'll be ways that somebody will go out there and do the work to say, uh, the new consumer, maybe consumer reports would say we test it and we know those who actually do and we'll certify the certifiers. That'd be an opportunity for them.\n\n1:29:07 - Leo Laporte\n\nMolly, I think this is a business. Your eyeball. Yeah.\n\n1:29:11 - Paris Martineau\n\nI think if we scan their eyeballs, this would all go away.\n\n1:29:16 - Leo Laporte\n\nUh, walmart's buying Visio, the well-known television brand. Uh, the Walmart's probably the number one uh company selling Visio TVs. We've recommended them for years. Why is Walmart buying them for the ad business?\n\n1:29:30 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nAmazing huh.\n\n1:29:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nOf course, $2.3 billion. They don't care about the TVs. Walmart has their own house brand. But but the the? When you buy a Visio TV, it's cheap, right?\n\n1:29:43 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nBecause I won't buy them anymore. Because of this, because it's spies on you.\n\n1:29:47 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's got a camera in it. It knows what you're watching when you're watching. It knows if there's anybody in the room. It uses its microphones to figure out what you're watching and it's so valuable. Walmart said yeah, that's worth $2.3 billion to us. We believe we believe Visio's customer centric operating system provides great viewing experiences at attractive price points, said Seth Delaer, executive vice president and chief revenue officer of Walmart. We also believe it enables a profitable advertising business that is rapidly scaling.\n\n1:30:28 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nAt least they admit it right In house advertising. I'm surprised I don't hear that as a as a genre.\n\n1:30:34 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt can offer. Once we acquire our Visio, we'll be able to offer quote, innovative television and in-home entertainment and media experiences. Media experience. It's going to be innovative when you see those ads popping up on your screen. You're just trying to watch TV, man, I just. It's like they're saying the quiet part out loud. I don't. They're not even hiding it, they are.\n\n1:31:00 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nI bought one for my father and then I returned it because I couldn't get it to. It was good. It was insisted on giving me all its junk.\n\n1:31:07 - Paris Martineau\n\nEven I, for years, have been trying to buy a new TV because I have I don't know some crap TV that a roommate roommate left an apartment once, but I don't know. I'm like I will shell out good money for a TV, but I don't want it to have spyware, I don't really want it to be internet connected and there aren't really any options for that. You want a computer monitor, then Parris. I know, although it sucks, they won't sell.\n\n1:31:30 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nYou know they won't, but they won't sell smart.\n\n1:31:31 - Paris Martineau\n\nTVs, but they will sell me like a 55 inch computer monitor?\n\n1:31:34 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell they do, at thousands of dollars, Much more expensive than a TV. I know that's great. I guess that changes the substance.\n\n1:31:39 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nWhy don't you? I do want to connect it because I want to stream things, Parris, Because I can connect something to it to stream no no, here's how it works the.\n\n1:31:45 - Paris Martineau\n\nTV itself does not need to stream.\n\n1:31:47 - Speaker 6\n\nDo not connect the TV to the internet my Roku and Amazon or.\n\n1:31:48 - Paris Martineau\n\nApple TV, that's right.\n\n1:31:52 - Leo Laporte\n\nLet Roku spy on you. You don't need Visio and Roku spying on you.\n\n1:31:56 - Paris Martineau\n\nListen, I'm going to choose one to three companies to spy on me for any viewing activity and no more.\n\n1:32:04 - Leo Laporte\n\nI mean really, if you don't most TVs, you don't have to connect them. They'll complain, but every once in a while you connect them. If you want to update firmware or whatever, They'll complain, but you don't have to connect them. And, just as you say, let the Apple TV and this is where Chromecast I hope Apple doesn't, it doesn't go down this path too far. They already have started putting advertising on their stores and so forth, but there's a big opportunity for them to say look, we'll be the place you can stream this stuff from safely, without they try to pretend they're doing that. But I, you know my Apple TV. I don't want to see any Major League Soccer, but there's constant ads for Major League Soccer because they own it. So I don't know. That's what Philip K Dick wrote about many years ago ads on every surface of everywhere.\n\n1:32:53 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nMolly, do you have a TV?\n\n1:32:56 - Molly White\n\nI do.\n\n1:32:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nNot exactly good for productivity. Do you watch the TV?\n\n1:33:01 - Paris Martineau\n\nWhen is the last time you watched a TV on a TV. I'd like to pose a different question to the chat.\n\n1:33:10 - Molly White\n\nI turn on my TV like once a month Same.\n\n1:33:14 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's how you get productive. Meanwhile, I'm watching TV five, six hours every single night. Youtube is now. Youtube TV is now the number one streamer, in case you had any doubts about that.\n\n1:33:30 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nSpeaking of TVs and how the business operates now 12 months straight, according to Nielsen.\n\n1:33:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's beating. What Netflix? Everybody? Yep, that's YouTube, tv, youtube. So that's the thing you do, you're watching, and I think it's because of you young people. It's all your fault.\n\n1:33:53 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nYou kids, you're riddling on networks. We used to have three places.\n\n1:33:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nWe used to have petticoat junction in my mother's car. But no, you had to watch Marquez Brownlee and Mr Beast, the Twitter TV. The Twitter TV, by the way. Congratulations to Marquez Brownlee, because in the YouTube official blog, celebrating, crowing that they are the number one streamer, they have a big ass picture of Marquez Brownlee Next to a Cybertruck. Next to a Cybertruck. Wow, anyway, nice work if you can get it. Congratulations, marquez. But that doesn't surprise me. We saw this coming. I mean, I, you know, I would. When Henry, 10 years ago, was in high school and his and his buddies came over, they didn't watch TV, they had YouTube running, all you know, all in the background, auto-playing in the background all the time, and that's why he's a terrorist.\n\n1:34:48 - Paris Martineau\n\nAnd now Salt Hank makes how much for YouTube videos.\n\n1:34:51 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou know, kid, you're right, my son, you don't know this well, marley important context is that Leo's son is a TikTok influencer food influencer called. Salt Hank. He's much bigger than I than I ever was.\n\n1:35:04 - Paris Martineau\n\nWe famously received tens of thousands of dollars for promoting a Cheetos brand, duster.\n\n1:35:12 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nParis, Paris. The guy who was impressed with Salt Hank is not the same guy who thought I was a 90 year old.\n\n1:35:19 - Paris Martineau\n\nNo, two different guys that guy, the guy who thought this is a bit that started before we started recording the show, which is a different guy I was seeing. I sent a photo of the podcast the other week when we had Micah on and he goes oh, leo, the port, I loved him. And then sees the photo of Jeff and is like and is that Noam Chomsky? I was like no, no, no no.\n\nYou know different guy and the guy who didn't know either of you but knew Salt Hank Sounds like an opening streak, though, yeah.\n\n1:35:54 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nI mean, I will say Noam Chomsky.\n\n1:35:59 - Leo Laporte\n\nNow, it's not bad to be compared to Noam Chomsky. Honestly, he's grumpy as hell.\n\n1:36:04 - Paris Martineau\n\nHe's 95 years old.\n\n1:36:07 - Leo Laporte\n\nListen, he looks just like you, jeff. I don't know what you're, she's. Look at him. There he is. He looks barely alive.\n\n1:36:13 - Paris Martineau\n\nYeah, yeah, he looks like you, I'm so Paris, paris, I'm sorry.\n\n1:36:26 - Jeff Jarvis\n\nListen to this guy please, oh Lord, oh, that depresses me so much more than I'll use the Wikipedia picture because you look that's a little bit better. He doesn't look quite so but that's from 40 years ago.\n\n1:36:43 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, it's pretty old. That's not that old.\n\n1:36:51 - Paris Martineau\n\nJeff, you're a young spry spring chicken.\n\n1:36:54 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, I really like this Pierce Morgan interview with Noam Chomsky. This was from last year.\n\n1:37:02 - Molly White\n\nIt looks like Jiman.\n\n1:37:05 - Paris Martineau\n\nHe looks like someone put one of those AI age filters on that photo of Jack Dorsey.\n\n1:37:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo for those who don't know, noam Chomsky brilliant linguist, semi-autistic, early AI, pioneer, brilliant.\n"
