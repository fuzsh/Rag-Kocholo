Granta Books, 2009; USA Publ Faber and Faber Inc. 2009). On page 34 the author mentions that Edison's original ideas concerning the application of phonograph included recording the voices of famous people, amongst other uses which \"emphasized the act of preserving information\". Lloffiwr (talk)\n\n@Lloffiwr: That's a fantastic find! Thank you for letting us know. Could I trouble you for a scan of the page, emailed to me, please?\n\nI've transposed the invitation to Meta: Meta:Template:Voice Intro Project invitation--1Veertje (talk)\n\nI got my file uploaded just fine but I noticed that Matt Cutts has captions on his that spell out what he is saying which is great for accessibility. I'll go look up how to do that but was wondering if it's something simple if it could be added to the descriptions on how to do this? Thanks Jessamyn (talk)\n\nPlease see commons:Commons:Timed Text --1Veertje (talk)\n\nThe suggested script at the moment currently seems to include the line, \"My name is...\" I would suggest that this is actually a very bad script for this project, because one useful derivative work that can be taken from these voice intros is pronunciation guides (see File:Mitch Kapor voice.ogg and File:En-Mitch Kapor.ogg). The problem with this is that the \"z\" sound at the end of \"is\" tends to bleed into the next word on the recordings with no natural pause, making it difficult to cleanly separate the end of the word \"is\" from the beginning of the name. I would suggest changing it to \"I am <name>...\" or something of that sort for future recordings. 0x0077BE (talk Â· contrib)\n\nIs there a standard way of adding something to an article's talk page to indicate that the subject would be a good one to record for the Voice Intro Project? Similar to {{photo requested}}. Sam Wilson\n\nThe closest I have come is a PetScan of a category intersecting with 'Living people' and not intersecting with 'Articles with hAudio microformats', e.g.. Sam Wilson"
