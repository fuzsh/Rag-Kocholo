The show premiered on November 4, 2002, as a replacement for Unscripted with Chris Connelly, and has aired daily at 5:00 p.m. ET on ESPN ever since. The show has been recorded in New York City since September 8, 2014, and has had over 4,000 episodes aired as of 2020. The program emanated from Washington, D.C., where it was located in the same facility as Pardon the Interruption (PTI). Production still is based in Washington, D.C.[2] The moderator for the show is Tony Reali, who has hosted the program since 2004, replacing Max Kellerman, and also served as the statistician on Pardon the Interruption until the show's relocation to New York.\n\nBroadcast history\n\n[edit]\n\nAround the Horn premiered on November 4, 2002.[3] From its premiere until January 30, 2004, the show was hosted by Max Kellerman, who at the time was largely known strictly as a contributor to ESPN's Friday Night Fights. In late 2003, Kellerman announced that he would depart from the network for Fox Sports;[4][5] after the show tried out several replacements, current host Tony Reali was named the permanent host on February 2, 2004, three days after Kellerman's last episode aired.[6] As of September 23, 2019, Woody Paige has the most wins in the history of the show, with more than six hundred.[7] Despite early negative reviews due to its now-defunct argumentative formatting,[8] the show has lasted more than twenty years on the air, remaining a staple on ESPN.[9] The show became less combative and more playful over the years, and in 2018, changed its look with augmented reality of the panel with Reali standing in an enhanced studio at ESPN's South Street Seaport studios with a continuation of the relaxed tone of the show since the mid-2010s.\n\nThe show went on hiatus from March 16, 2020, to May 8, 2020, as a result of a national emergency being declared due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused the suspension of sports leagues around the world. Between May 11, 2020, and July 10, 2020, Around the Horn aired for 20 minutes with commercials at 4:40 p.m. EDT as Around the Home under a new format where Tony Reali, along with three panelists, discussed sports issues from their own homes. The Around the Home format became semipermanent beginning with the July 13, 2020 episode, which saw the show expand back to its normal length. The show returned to its regular format when it returned to the studio in September 2020, although the Around the Home format is still used occasionally.\n\nThe set\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original set was in the same Atlantic Video complex as the set for Pardon the Interruption.[10] It featured the host's desk with the point triggers[11] and mute buttons.[12] The judge of the show scores four panelists, that are shown on four different screens.[13] Behind the host's desk was a map of the contiguous United States of America with the cities the sportswriters on the show appeared from. The map, divided into time zones, displayed the names of five newspapers representing each time zone. The Los Angeles Times represented the Pacific Time Zone, the Denver Post the Mountain Time Zone, the Dallas Morning News and Chicago Sun-Times both represented the Central Time Zone, and the Boston Globe represented the Eastern Time Zone. This was to create a regionally biased discussion, but this was later phased out.\n\nWhen panelist Woody Paige was based in New York, the logo of Cold Pizza was added to the Eastern Time Zone side of the map as Paige also appeared on that program. Eventually, the logo of the Boston Globe was replaced by the word \"Boston\" as many of the contributors from Boston were no longer writing for the Globe. The map was eventually revised in this way for the other cities on the map, but there cities of other contributors were not added to the board (possibly due to a lack of space) before the map was removed. Panelists still appear from left to right as on a map of the United States, from the westernmost on the left to the easternmost on the right.\n\nOn September 27, 2010, Around the Horn and Pardon the Interruption began broadcasting in high definition and moved from the Atlantic Video complex to facilities in the ABC News Washington bureau, where high definition sets were built for both shows.[14] In 2014, Reali relocated to New York, with a studio built in ABC's Times Square Studios.[15] In 2018, in conjunction with the conclusion of Reali's work on Good Morning America, the show moved to ESPN's South Street Seaport Studios with an enhanced set featuring augmented reality.\n\nEach panelist appears either in the offices of their newspaper, in front of a screen representing the city in which they are located, or in another studio. Dallas, Denver, and Los Angeles (when Bill Plaschke is appearing) still use their newspaper offices as studio space while Washington, Miami, Chicago, and Boston each have their own screens. (Los Angeles employs this as well when J.A. Adande is a panelist.) Newspaper office space is rarely used in today's iteration.\n\nRounds\n\n[edit]\n\nThe current Around the Horn format consists of the following:\n\nIntroduction: Three sports headlines that will be discussed during the show are previewed; this is followed by the show's open.\n\nThe First Word: Current sports headlines are discussed. The panelists give detailed arguments and can also give rebuttals to other panelists. This round lasts until the first commercial break.\n\nBuy or Sell: A rapid-fire segment in which the panelists are asked to \"buy\" or \"sell\" (be for or against) two to three different concepts, also drawn from current sports headlines. In the first few months of this format and sometimes used with three panelists, four topics were discussed, with each having a shorter time limit to fit between the first and second commercial breaks. In the case of a scoring change happening during the first commercial break, Reali will tell the scores and announce the panelist or panelists that committed the \"commercial break violation\" before the first \"Buy or Sell\" topic. Between 2010 and March 2020 and again starting in September 2020, the 2 lowest scoring panelists were eliminated after this round; on the Around the Home format, the lowest-scoring panelist was eliminated.\n\nShowdown: Mentioned above, the two remaining panelists take sides on any sports or cultural stories remaining. There are usually two or three topics, sometimes one or four, depending on the amount of time left. Usually, the westernmost panelist goes first for the first topic, with the other speaking for the second half. The panelists then alternate going first for the remaining topics. Each topic is timed between 15 and 30 seconds each depending on time remaining. Reali usually gives a panelist one point per topic, although he occasionally gives more than one point or deducts points depending on the strength or weakness of the argument. Only once there was a one-person showdown and a four people showdown.\n\nFace Time: The winner of the showdown and therefore winner of that particular episode gets around 30 seconds (more or less depending on time left in show frame) to talk about any issue. Most of the time these are sports related, but often their own personal life or an issue in pop culture or the news is discussed. Formerly, Lounge music is played in the background as the winner talks. The lounge music is not played in serious Face Time (deaths, major news (both sports and non-sports related)). Since 2018, the theme song plays throughout Face Time.\n\nGoodbye: Reali says how long it will be until the next episode, for example, \"we're on a 23-and-a-half hour break.\" On Fridays, he will sign off by saying \"a 71-and-a-half-hour break.\" If there is an extended period until the show comes back on, Reali may simply say, \"You do the math!\"\n\nPaper Toss: Signature sign-off of the show, with Reali crumpling his notes and throwing them towards the camera. As he does this, the panelists will often continue to chatter in the background as the show ends. Since the summer of 2016, Reali has gone more towards throwing paper airplanes or flicking paper footballs toward the camera.\n\nPTI Next: This simply tells viewers just that: that Pardon the Interruption is up next.\n\nPrevious formats\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore the format of the show was changed in early 2003, the format was similar, wherein the first two rounds were largely the same but with different titles. There was a bigger difference after that. The show ran like so:\n\nThe Opening Round: The two biggest headlines of the day.\n\nThe Lightning Round: A quick-moving round with four topics where players had to make their points quickly or risk getting muted by Max Kellerman, the former host. Somewhat similar, though not entirely, to the Lightning Round used from 2009 to 2015.\n\nThe Bonus Round: One final topic, with the panelists trying to earn some last-second points, followed by a sports trivia question for each panelist, worth five points.\n\nThe Medal Round: The panelists earned Face Time equal to their scores converted to seconds, in reverse order of their placing. The winner wins a gold medal, the runner up received silver, third place got bronze, and the last-place finisher was given a foil ball. More often than not, due to time restrictions, the panelists were given less time than they earned, or at least one panelist would not be given any time at all. During this round, panelists could appeal to the Disembodied Voice for more points.\n\nDespite the change in format, Reali still occasionally announces \"ten topics, one winner\" at the beginning of the show regardless of the number of topics.\n\nThis format ran from 2003 thru 2015:\n\nIntroduction: A commercial-free transition to the opening moments of the show starts with the host, Reali, introducing the panelists as \"four of America's most (themed) sportswriters.\" For example, if the \"theme word\" is \"indifferent\", the four panelists would all do their impressions of an indifferent sportswriter. The show itself is then introduced with Reali mentioning three topics to be discussed, then exclaiming \"Ten topics, one winner. Horn me!\" The opening theme plays, and cuts to Reali for an introduction. The panelists are then individually introduced and given time for an opening statement. Most of the panelists use this time for jokes or criticism of the host or other panelists, which can lead to points or mutes. (One such example is when Woody Paige used his time by blowing a miniature plasticine horn, as a pun towards the show's name; this resulted in Paige being muted by Reali). Also any scoring changes that can be seen on ATH's YouTube page, Reali will tell the scores and announce the panelist or panelists that committed the \"Pre-Show violation\" before the first \"First Word\" topic.\n\nThe First Word: Two current sports headlines are discussed. The panelists give detailed arguments and can also give rebuttals to other panelists.\n\nBuy or Sell: A rapid-fire segment in which the panelists are asked to \"buy\" or \"sell\" (be for or against) three different concepts, also drawn from current sports headlines. In the first few months of this format and sometimes used with three panelists, four topics were discussed, with each having a shorter time limit to fit between the first and second commercial breaks. In the case of a scoring change happening during the first commercial break, Reali will tell the scores and announce the panelist or panelists that committed the \"commercial break violation\" before the first \"Buy or Sell\" topic.\n\n1st Cut: The panelist with the lowest point total is eliminated. In the case of ties, Reali often breaks them by miscellaneous things, like whose hair is better combed. If the awarding of a point causes a tie for the two lowest panelists, Reali sometimes gives the same panelist a second point to break it. Sometimes on shows with three panelists, the lowest score is spared from elimination.\n\nOut of Bounds: This round, always played as the third round, is dedicated to talking about one story which is indirectly sports-related. Serious and controversial topics, such as steroid use and suspensions, are usually discussed in this round, and few to no points are awarded. This was a daily feature from the time of the format change until late October 2009. It is occasionally tied together with the \"Lightning Round.\" \"Out of Bounds\" is now used in ATH today.\n\nThe Lightning Round: Another third round, this being a continuation of the sports discussion with two or three rapid-fire topics. Reintroduced to the show in November 2009, a different \"Lightning Round\" was part of the original ATH format.\n\n2nd Cut: The next contestant with the lowest point total is removed, leaving just two. (In the event all four contestants were in the third round (mostly an important Out of Bounds), the two lowest point totals are eliminated). The camera then reveals the final two contestants and Reali typically says something to the effect of, \"Two men enter, one man wins!\" right before the cut to commercial.\n\nShowdown: Mentioned above, the two remaining panelists take sides on any sports or cultural stories remaining. There are two or three questions, depending on the amount of time left. Usually, the westernmost panelist goes first for the first topic, with the other speaking for the second half. The panelists then alternate going first for the remaining topics. Each topic is timed between 15 and 40 seconds each depending on time remaining. Reali usually gives a panelist one point per topic, although he occasionally gives more than one point or deducts points depending on the strength or weakness of the argument. Only once there was a one-person showdown and a four people showdown.\n\nFace Time: The winner of the showdown and therefore winner of that particular episode gets around 30 seconds (more or less depending on time left in show frame) to talk about anything he or she wishes to discuss. Most of the time these are sports related, but often their own personal life or an issue in pop culture or the news is discussed. Lounge music is played in the background as the winner talks. The lounge music is not played in serious Face Time (deaths, major news (both sports and non-sports related)).\n\nGoodbye: Reali says how long it will be until the next episode, for example, \"we're on a 23-and-a-half hour break.\" On Fridays, he will sign off by saying \"a 71-and-a-half-hour break.\" If there is an extended period until the show comes back on, Reali may simply say, \"You do the math!\"\n\nPaper Toss: Signature sign-off of the show, with Reali crumpling his notes and throwing them towards the camera. As he does this, the panelists will often continue to chatter in the background as the show ends. Since the summer of 2016, Reali has gone more towards throwing paper airplanes or flicking paper footballs toward the camera.\n\nPTI Next: This simply tells viewers just that: that Pardon the Interruption is up next.\n\nHosts\n\n[edit]\n\nMax Kellerman (November 4, 2002 - January 30, 2004)\n\nTony Reali (February 2, 2004 – present)\n\nGuest hosts\n\n[edit]\n\nZachariah Selwyn (June 8, 2004 - June 11, 2004)\n\nDuke Castiglione (July 3, 2006 - July 5, 2006)\n\nRob Stone (June 30, 2008 - July 4, 2008 and July 28, 2008 - August 1, 2008)\n\nWoody Paige (April 1, 2009 and April 1, 2019, both as April Fools' Day pranks)\n\nPablo S.
