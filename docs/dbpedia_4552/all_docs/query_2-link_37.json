        "text": "This is the article about the character. For the episode, see Queen Bee.\n\nBeelzebub, or more commonly known as Queen Bee, is a minor character in Helluva Boss who made her debut in \"Queen Bee\".\n\nShe is the girlfriend of Vortex and one of the Seven Deadly Sins, embodying the sin of Gluttony.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nBeelzebub is a tall and foxlike demon with shapely hips and insect-like features - such as two pairs of arms, a pair of antennae attached to her ears, and a small pair of insect wings which are light yellow with pink outlines. Her long hair and tail appears to be made out of lava lamp fluid colored in bright pink, aqua-blue and orange, with her waist also resembling a lava lamp. Atop of her head is a pink, black and white tuft which resembles a small, flame-like crown.\n\nHer fur is light yellow with dark fuchsia stripes and small markings located on her ears, the sides of her face, and between her eyes respectively, with white from her upper torso up to her muzzle with a small black nose. She also has a dark fuchsia stripe on her head that opens up into a third eye when she enters her full demon form.\n\nHer eyes have very pale yellow sclera and hot-pink pupils, as well as faded light maroon upper eyelids and thick eyelashes with two protruding that resemble antennae. She also has black, dripping-like markings from her eyes, and over her four arms and digitigrade legs, resembling fingerless gloves and thigh-high stockings.\n\nBeelzebub wears a black choker around her neck, a low-cut black bra under a small, off-the-shoulder pink crop-top with lighter markings below the heart-shaped cutout, and a set of light pink shorts with the trim being the same color as her top.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nBeelzebub presents herself as a highly extroverted and energetic party girl, as she proven to be optimistic, cheerful and loud, yet welcoming when it comes to being the host for her own parties. With her lively attitude, she keeps a bright environment for her guests, allowing them to heavily indulge in food and alcohol, such as her beelzejuice.\n\nDespite being one of the Seven Deadly Sins, she is arguably laid-back and is comfortable to strike a conversation to a new face. She can be rather expressive as she is the \"Too Much Information\" type-person, as when Vortex introduced her to Loona for the first time, she talks about having a \"rainbow in her vagina\" and her past experience with encountering Satan being shirtless.\n\nShe is also shown to be competitive when challenging Blitzo to a drinking contest, but shows respect to him when losing. She has shown to care about others' well-being and also concern for her guests, and does not like it when they indulge for self destructive reasons.\n\nBeelzebub also doesn't like it when people make snide or unkind comments about her, such as when she asked Loona to go check on Blitzo, and the former insults her under her breath. She is also not afraid to show dominance, as she uses her Full Demon form to intimidate Loona and told her to \"not fuck with her\". However, she can be apologetic for using her full powers for petty reasons, such as when she apologized to Vortex for almost starting a fight with his friend.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nFlight - Beelzebub possesses small, insect-like wings which allow her to fly.\n\nDemonic transformation - Beelzebub can enter a larger bee-like form, one that towers over Loona and is unable to stand indoors.\n\nObject materialization - Beelzebub is shown to be able to materialize items, namely confectionery like cotton candy, from seemingly nothing. This also seems to include non-tangible things, such as rainbows.\n\nEmpathic taste - Beelzebub can detect everyone’s sense of taste within her vicinity and can become energized off it. But she can also pick up on bad vibes from troubled individuals, such as when Blitzo is making out with other imps while battling the need to puke.\n\nSize manipulation - Beelzebub is shown enlarging various types of food, including tacos and alcoholic drinks, including their container, and also appears as different sizes herself.\n\nMélikinesis - Beelzebub can manipulate a honey-like substance freely, levitating, moving, expanding, and shrinking it.\n\nPrehensile hair and tail - Beelzebub's hair and tail, which is made of a honey or lava lamp based substance, is constantly seen moving and seems to be manipulated at her will.\n\nEnhanced metabolism - Beelzebub's digestive system is constantly burning what she consumes, keeping her constantly indulging.[2]\n\nSkillset[]\n\nPerforming arts - Beelzebub is shown to be an exceptional performer, going so far as to use her talents to host lavish parties for imps and hellhounds, where she is the entertainment.\n\nMusical talent - Beelzebub is shown to be an incredible singer as seen during her song, Cotton Candy.\n\nGallery[]\n\nBeelzebub/Gallery\n\nTrivia[]\n\nBeelzebub is based on the popular demon of the same name known for having multiple renditions, which are referenced in the character's depiction in the series.[3]\n\nIn Binsfeld's classification of demons, Beelzebub is one of the seven Princes of Hell, representing Gluttony. Likewise, Beelzebub in Helluva Boss is the embodiment of Gluttony.\n\nThe name \"Beelzebub\" is derived from Hebrew meaning \"Lord of the flies\". This may have influenced Beelzebub's interpretation as an insect, although in Helluva Boss she's a bee instead of a fly due to their association with honey.\n\nBeelzebub is the second of the deadly sins to debut.\n\nThe emblem in the episode thumbnail and Beelzebub's mansion interior is the Seal of Bael from the Ars Goetia, but with some minor design modifications and the name \"Beelzebub\" rather than \"Bael\" encompassing it. This implies a relationship between Beelzebub and Bael, however it is unclear if they are the same or separate individuals.\n\nThis connection is drawn from the name Beelzebub, being derived from Ba'al-zəbûb, and associated with the Canaanite god Baal, with \"Baal\" being an alternate spelling of the Ars Goetia demon, Bael.\n\nAdditionally, Beelzebub (and Belphegor) of the Hellaverse are portrayed as female, as opposed to their real-life demonology counterpart, who are males.\n\nBeelzebub's design resembles the ZooPhobia character, JayJay, who is known for appearing in Vivienne Medrano's well-known animated music video adaptation of Kesha's song \"Die Young\". This is most apparent during \"Cotton Candy\", where Beelzebub is briefly blue underneath the neon lighting.\n\nAccording to Vivziepop, Beelzebub's lava lamp theme was for a few reasons, the main one is that Vivziepop wanted her to have \"a very 60s' hippy free spirit kind of party vibe\", and adding that her belly is essentially constantly burning what she consumes, keeping her constantly indulging.[2][4]\n\nIn a reply to a Tweet, Sam Miller states she calls Beelzebub the \"Queen of the Never-Shuts-The-Fuck-Up Club\".[5]\n\nIn an official artwork posted by the Helluva Boss Twitter in celebration of Pride Month 2024, Beelzebub is confirmed to be pansexual.[1]\n\nIncidentally, the same art piece has her wings missing.\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nBeelzebub's ears are designed after beehives and end in antennas, and she is a fox to slightly separate her from hellhounds.[6]\n\nWhen Beelzebub goes full demon form, the insect aspects are more on display,[6] which makes her eyes insectoid.[7]\n\nAccording to Vivziepop, originally Beelzebub's tail had more stripes, but for sake of complexity they were removed.[7]\n\nAccording to Sam Miller, Bombproof was designed with the fire mane and lava belly as a test to see if Beelzebub's hair and lava belly were possible to do.[8]\n\nAdditionally, as revealed in the rough drafts from the official artists, Beelzebub's lava lamp-like body is green screened onto her character.[9]\n\nBeelzebub's lava lamp hair and tail had a rigged looping asset which was used by the animation team for her appearances throughout the episode.[10]\n\nAccording to Vivienne Medrano, each of the Seven Deadly Sins represents a circus act, with Beelzebub representing the animal tamer/animal shows, with her mansion being decorated with circus hoops and rings.[11][6]\n\nIn one of Vivziepop's Instagram posts made some time before the premiere of \"Murder Family\", several sketches of Beelzebub can be seen around her traditional drawing of Blitzo.[12]\n\nReferences[]"
