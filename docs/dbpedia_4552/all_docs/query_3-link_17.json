        "text": "Once upon a time...\n\nLeo LaPorte used to be just another daytime radio host, but he ended up specializing in tech talk radio and TV shows, which led to a gig on TechTV at the turn of the century. That ended after a reorg, and while he continued to do radio and TV projects, he also started dabbling in the then new art of podcasting. His podcasting sideline quickly grew into a profitable business that outgrew its original studio and moved into a new million dollar studio last year, producing, streaming, and uploading up to 40 hours of content a week from http://www.twit.tv , including productions for other podcast studios. Also has a live camera on between shows, as well as a 2nd 24/7 silent monitor cam on random parts of the studio.\n\nSo, I've been catching content from the site for the past couple of years, starting out with podcasts, then moving to video and audio streams. I like many of the shows, but get tired of Leo himself. Wondering if there were many others here who either like him or don't like him.\n\nElectric taco.\n\nHe is neither tired nor wired. But I've only been catching his podcasts for about the past year. Still, I maybe hear him once or twice a week. He's got a pretty solid stable of folks that provide a variety of viewpoints.\n\nSometimes, he seems a bit wishywashy. There've been times I've heard him say something and think \"I swear you took the opposite position last week.\". And that doesn't apply to times when he plays devil's advocate. He tends to be soft on guests, too.\n\nBut as far as an overall stable of folks with differing viewpoints, I think the TWIT folks do a good job.\n\nI haven't followed his career or projects but on a personal level I found him to be a very nice guy. We met maybe 3 times - the first and last were at Comdex when he was doing the ZDTV thing. I got an autographed picture of Kate & Leo the first time. The middle time was at a Battlebots competition, here in Vegas during the week of Comdex. Leo came in to watch for awhile, and then approached my wife and I to chat (We were away from most of the spectators, eating dinner in the raised dining area at one end of the venue. Best 'dinner & a show' ever!). He was very interested in our opinions on the possibilities of Battlebots on TV. ZDTV was pursuing a deal with them at the time. By the next time I saw him, Battlebots had aired on Comedy Central, who of course ruined it. I asked him what went on and he said they had just simply been outbid.\n\nNice guy.\n\nI don't have any issues with Laporte in general, I have a generally favorable opinion of the man and his work, but I have little use for his shows.\n\nI just never really caught on to the \"netcast\" craze, I'd really rather read my tech news. Every time I've tried listening I've found myself bored quickly, it's just so slow-paced and conversational. The information density is far too low.\n\nI can basically get 10x the information on the same set of topics by reading the Ars Technica front page for 10 minutes, than I'd get from listening to an hours worth of podcasts.\n\nAfter hearing a rumor that they were using Techmeme.com to source stories for TWiT, I started skimming it too. The format's useful - they aggregate like stories and opinion articles. But then I started reading allegations that a lot of Silicon Valley journalists were turning into VC backers, and using their blogs as bully pulpits to push their opinons, and that some of them were tight with Techmeme and with other major bloggers. So I started getting turned off on that.\n\nI guess never having met him, I can't say how nice Leo is or not. From what I've seen he's a great host, but not exactly a great studio head. Has good brains around him though.\n\nHe does a short segment with Bill Handel every Friday morning just before eight, which I catch on my way to work. I also listen to his show on the weekends sometimes if I'm in the car at the time.\n\nI like him, and find him to be informative, but I can't take him for very long. Especially when he takes callers. But then again, I usually can't take most radio shows when they have listeners call in.\n\nI remember him from the TechTV days and as the industry was in its relative infancy, us tech nerds were very much more on our own than now. He was interesting to listen to and watch but I remember a recurring feeling that when he covered a topic he used a broad brush and often left things out for the sake of brevity and/or showmanship. Those things, some minor and some major, meant that if you embarked on a task he recommended, at some point, you were SOL. I cannot give an example (this being so long ago) but that was my impression.\n\nI agree with ClydeJr on This Week in Tech. But they have several other podcasts I really like: Windows Weekly, Tech News Today, MacBreak Weekly, iPad today, Frame Rate, Triangulation often has interesting guests, and a couple of others from time to time. All About Android was good when I was more into Android devices. They have a couple of new shows in development, too.\n\nI try to balance things out with 5by5 podcasts and Bagel Tech (soon to be British Tech) podcasts.\n\nGenerally, I like podcasts that are more informal, informative, and with some sense of humor. CNET and NPR tech podcasts bore the hell out of me and seem to be rote readings of this week's tech news. Very little depth or opinion. I tried The Verge for a while but really couldn't stomach them.\n\nHopefully, Ars will have a podcast soon. They've been working on one, and it would be great to have that as another option. Jacqui Cheng giving the smackdown on all things tech! Booyah!\n\nI could swear he was involved with another show that I watched in the mid-90s, but I do not see it in the list on his Wiki page. He was interesting at times, but I felt his show fell short when it came to details. He would introduce a topic that really sounded interesting, and then give it the five minute treatment. I felt the same about Call for Help and Screen Savers, and so I have not followed anything recent that he has been working on.\n\nCrombie\":1ehbat14 said:\n\nI could swear he was involved with another show that I watched in the mid-90s, but I do not see it in the list on his Wiki page.

I felt the same about Call for Help and Screen Savers, and so I have not followed anything recent that he has been working on.\n\nI see that as an endemic problem, really.\n\nIt's a different sphere, of course, but I'm on the board of our local PASS (Professional Association for SQL Server) chapter, and this is a challenge every month. Those of us on the board and some members are really looking for deep dives into technology, but any individual topic tends to only appeal to a subset of that subset (if you don't write ETL packages, a deep look into SSIS programming isn't of interest to you). Broad topics at a high level, however, end up appealing to most people (if you use SQL Server, it's good to know something about BI, for example).\n\nSo we end up with speakers presenting breadth more often than speakers presenting depth, because that way we keep more members engaged more of the time. I imagine you face a very similar problem when producing a tech podcast, and I'm not sure how you solve it.\n\nOnce upon a time, TechTV used to be this thing that made my life hell, because at the time I was working end-user support and every once in a while some asshole user trying to show off would waylay me or one of my coworkers while we were elbows-deep in their computer and couldn't escape, and they'd drop some ridiculous bullshit like, \"So, I was watching the Screen Savers last night, and they said that that the internet uses D-C-H-P for T-P-C-I-P, which is a network technology for allocating mack addresses. It's some real high performance stuff. I was wondering if you guys have heard of it, and if we're using it on the network here at work, because everything is always so slow. Oh, don't delete that--I use that Bonzi Buddy thing all the time.\"\n\nAnd then the Screen Savers was cancelled, and I howled with joy, because fuck that shit."
