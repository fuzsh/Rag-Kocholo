        "text": "Sonic is a telecommunications company and internet service provider based in Santa Rosa, California, acting as a competitive local exchange carrier in the San Francisco Bay Area, Sacramento, and Los Angeles.[2][3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSonic began as an effort to bring network connectivity and Internet access to staff and students at the campus of Santa Rosa Junior College. In 1994, Sonic began formal Internet operations by way of a partnership between Dane Jasper and Scott Doty, both of whom had worked on the network at the college.[4] In 1995, Sonic moved into its downtown Santa Rosa location.[5]\n\nIn 2011, after becoming concerned about increasing requests for users' data by private law firms, mostly related to copyright infringement involving pornography, Sonic cut the time it stores logs of user activity to two weeks.[6][7]\n\nLater in 2011, the US federal government forced Sonic and Google to provide e-mail addresses of people who had corresponded with WikiLeaks volunteer and Tor developer Jacob Appelbaum. Sonic and Google fought the secret court order, which CEO Dane Jasper characterized as \"rather expensive, but the right thing to do,\" and the court agreed to lift the seal on the Sonic order to give Appelbaum a copy of it.[8][9]\n\nIn 2012, Jasper told TorrentFreak that Sonic would not be participating in the so-called \"six strikes\" plan, in which major US internet service providers would begin to warn and punish people suspected of infringing copyrights, saying that ISPs are not equipped to police the actions of individuals, and that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) had not invited small, independent ISPs to participate.[10]\n\nIn late 2014, Sonic.net rebranded as Sonic, after acquiring sonic.com and the @sonic Twitter handle.[11]\n\nIn April 2015, the company partnered with AT&T to expand service, using fiber-to-the-node. Due to this partnership, Sonic customers connected via that service are required to comply with AT&T's upstream policies, and may be subject to government spying. Sonic customers can utilize a VPN to avoid AT&T policies, and Sonic requires a lawful court order for any information requested by law enforcement.[12]\n\nIn December 2018, Sonic announced a partnership with Eero—now owned by Amazon—creator of the first whole-home WiFi mesh system, to improve WiFi connectivity across the entire home.[13][14]\n\nServices\n\n[edit]\n\nSonic offers a number of services including:\n\n10 Gigabit Fiber – residential product[1]\n\nGigabit Fiber – combined voice (VoIP) and data service offering up to 1,000 Mbit/s per line using Passive Optical Networking,[1] with unlimited nationwide land line voice. Sonic has full control of the line: subscribers are on Sonic's IP space. Available in select markets, currently only Northern California locations.[15]\n\nFusion ADSL2+ – combined voice (POTS) and data service offering up to 20 Mbit/s per line, with unlimited nationwide land line voice. Sonic has full control of the line: subscribers are on Sonic's IP space.\n\nFusion VDSL2 – combined voice (POTS) and data service offering up to 75 Mbit/s[16] with the same limitations as Fusion ADSL2+. This subscription is served from a CO where Sonic has full control of the line cards and therefore remove any artificial limitation in speed that a subscriber can get. The requirement for getting this service is an individual has to be relatively close to the CO, up to 4000 feet.[17] X2 is also available which will roughly double the speed.\n\nFusion FTTN (VDSL2) – combined voice (VoIP) and data service offering from 20 Mbit/s up to 75 Mbit/s through bonding (X2), with unlimited nationwide land line voice. This is resold AT&T U-verse. Single pair connection is limited to 50 Mbit/s even if the line is capable of more than that; bonded pair is limited to 75 Mbit/s. Sonic has some control of the line such as not enforcing transfer caps, but customers are on AT&T's IP space. VoIP connection defaults to G.729ab[18] and uses less than 50 Kbps.[19]\n\nFlexLink – midband Ethernet service offering symmetric speeds from 1.5 Mbit/s to 500 Mbit/s.\n\nAT&T DSL – ADSL service delivered over an AT&T voice line. This service is obsolete and Sonic is no longer accepting legacy ADSL1 subscriptions.\n\nHosting – website hosting services.\n\nColocation – datacenter colocation in Santa Rosa, CA.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of broadband providers in the United States\n\nITU G.992.5\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
