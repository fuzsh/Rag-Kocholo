Bank holiday weekend and car starts making funny noise when idling or in low gears.

Anyone recommend a garage southside Glasgow? - Pollokshields, Shawlands, Cathcart area and into Ibrox.

In reply to Flinticus:

Try this guy at Whitecraigs train station http://www.rossmaitlandwhitecraigs.co.uk

Slightly further out but at least you can get the train back if you need to leave the car
