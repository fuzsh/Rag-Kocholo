        "text": "TRAGIC schoolgirl Heather Still posted farewell messages online minutes before she was killed by a train, it emerged yesterday.\n\nThe 13-year-old wrote a series of posts to friends on social networking website Tumblr.\n\nPolice are investigating the messages as part of their inquiry into Heather’s death on Tuesday.\n\nHeather was killed when the 2pm Neilston to Glasgow Central service hit her at Whitecraigs train station near the city. Police and paramedics raced to help but she died at the scene.\n\nYesterday, her devastated family, including mum Pamela, dad David and sister Kerry, 15, released a statement through the British Transport Police.\n\nThey said: “We are devastated at the senseless loss of our ­beautiful and much loved daughter and sister. Words cannot express our pain and despair.\n\n“We would also like to thank everyone for their kind messages and support we have received.”\n\nFellow pupils as well as staff at Mearns Castle High School in nearby Newton Mearns have been offered counselling services to help them come to terms with Heather’s death.\n\nThe S2 pupil was not at school on Tuesday because it was an in-service day, with only teachers attending.\n\nHeadteacher Dean Smith said the school was “deeply saddened” by Heather’s loss and told how support was being provided to pupils and staff who were “understandably shocked and upset”.\n\nHe added: “Our thoughts are with Heather’s family.”\n\nFlowers were laid at the station yesterday by friends.\n\nOne card said: “You’ll be greatly missed and never forgotten. RIP Heather, love Kirsteen.”\n\nAnother said: “Everyone will miss you so much. Rest in peace. Fiona.” A third said simply: “Gone but not forgotten.”\n\nFriends also paid tribute online to Heather, who was a fan of boy band 5 Seconds of Summer.\n\nTwitter user @5SOSjellybabies said: “Heather, I love you so, so much you beautiful angel.”\n\nAnd Instagram user boo.tay said: “I waited outside maths so we could talk, like we sometimes did. The entire year is in tears. We need you back beautiful.”\n\nBritish Transport Police said there were no suspicious circumstances into Heather’s death and inquiries were ongoing."
