        "text": "NiallGray Sat 11 Apr 2020, 4:14 pm\n\nHi all, been a while!\n\nI'm not saying I'm reviving the route, let's get that out of the way first, merely I've find myself with a lot of time on my hands at the moment...\n\nAnyhow, I've been having a little tinker with the route, just to see if any desire for route building returns.\n\nSpent the last week on a station called Whitecraigs, which is on the Neilston line. Up to V4, the total extent of the Neilston line was a few hundred yards past Cathcart junction.\n\nWhen I downed tools 4 years ago, I had only fully completed the following;\n\nGiffnock to Clarkston on the East Kilbride line (along with 1/2 mile of scenery heading out of East Kilbride)\n\nAnd from Muirend to Williamwood on the Neilston line.\n\nMore details on this old link.\n\nhttps://forums.uktrainsim.com/viewtopic.php?f=240&t=146088\n\nWhitecraigs is the next station along from Williamwood and the extent of the trackwork.\n\nHere are a few pics.\n\nWith that done, I'm now trying to add a station on another line, just struggling with the platforms (as was always the case!).\n\nHope all my old friends on here are well, stay safe!\n\nNiall\n\nRe: Glasgow Carlisle...\n\nMarkh5682 Sun 12 Apr 2020, 9:36 am\n\nGood to hear from you Nial, all the best and stay safe.\n\nMark\n\nRe: Glasgow Carlisle...\n\nNiallGray Mon 13 Apr 2020, 1:54 pm\n\nHi Mark, Bob, glad to see you're both doing ok.\n\nThis station is, and will continue to be a nightmare, there are many reasons why I did not put it in V4.\n\nFor some reason the distant mountains look awful here, so if the route is ever finished, I'll put a note in to turn off distant mountains if starting at this location (or stay in cab until a mile up the line). Odd thing is it is fine if you are heading to this station from the Glasgow direction.\n\nIt's a hard a station to replicate, a bridge under the station was a nightmare (fixing by cloning a shape and playing about in SFM) and I'm trying to give a feel of the real-life location, even though I don't have anything that looks like the station buildings.\n\nHave downed tools while I go off to try and source a signal box, as this is a location which actually has one!\n\nThe reason I really want to try and complete this station is because it has a working terminus bay platform, so even though the main line continues, commuter services start from here which would be good for activity writers.\n\nNiall\n\nRe: Glasgow Carlisle...\n\nNiallGray Thu 16 Apr 2020, 9:58 pm\n\nStation is starting to come to life now, and looking a little more like the real thing. It is above ground level so putting in walls down to ground level.\n\nSlow progress as experimenting with different scenery, but will be worth it.\n\nRe: Glasgow Carlisle...\n\nianmacmillan Fri 17 Apr 2020, 10:43 am\n\nBAURHEED\n\nThe signal box was the clue.\n\nRe: Glasgow Carlisle...\n\nNiallGray Fri 24 Apr 2020, 3:53 pm\n\nRe: Glasgow Carlisle...\n\nNiallGray Thu 18 Jun 2020, 2:41 pm\n\nAlas, progressed has stopped again. My last computer that ran MSTS is broken.\n\nCan't even get anyone to look at it right now due to the current situation.\n\nRe: Glasgow Carlisle...\n\nslipperman12 Thu 18 Jun 2020, 5:51 pm\n\nHi Niall,\n\nSorry to hear that, mate\n\nIs it physically broken or could it be a software malfunction? If it's the latter, it could possibly be repaired. Can you please tell us the symptoms of the 'breakdown'?\n\nCheers,\n\nGed\n\nKeep Safe !!\n\nIntel i5 4690K (3.5GHz), Gigabyte GA-Z97P-D3 m/b, 12GB RAM, NVIDIA GTX 750ti (2GB), ASUS Xonar DS Sound Card, Win 10 Pro 64 bit."
