But, he asks, what if the beloved is false but gives no sign of defection?\n\nBut do thy worst to steal thyself away,\n\nFor term of life thou art assurèd mine,\n\nAnd life no longer than thy love will stay,\n\n4For it depends upon that love of thine.\n\nThen need I not to fear the worst of wrongs\n\nWhen in the least of them my life hath end;\n\nI see a better state to me belongs\n\n8Than that which on thy humor doth depend.\n\nThou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,\n\nSince that my life on thy revolt doth lie.\n\nO, what a happy title do I find,\n\n12Happy to have thy love, happy to die!\n\nBut what’s so blessèd-fair that fears no blot?\n\nThou mayst be false, and yet I know it not."
