        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) â Kelsea Ballerini is beaming. It's not a nervous smile, though she admits to feeling scared. She's been hard at work at her fifth full-length album, âPatterns,â and on Oct. 25 the world is finally going to hear it â hear her, in a collection of songs she describes as an âaccurate snapshotâ of her life. And lately, people have been curious. The story they're going to get, she assures, is not the one they're anticipating.\n\nâI think that people probably expect this really happy-go-lucky, love, mushy, gushy record from me. Thatâs not the case,â she tells The Associated Press. âAnd Iâm really proud of that. It would have been easy to, I think, just collect the really beautiful parts of my life that Iâve dusted off and found the last couple of years. But thatâs not the fullness of my experience.â\n\nShe's referring, in some ways, to 2023's super-successful âRolling Up the Welcome Mat,â an EP and short film that told the story of the dissolution of a marriage, a not too-thinly-veiled reference to her own life, where, in 2022, Ballerini found herself divorced from Australian country singer Morgan Evans. These days, she's partnered with âOuter Banksâ star Chase Stokes, a relationship the public has fallen in love with. But her love life is not the sole heart of âPatterns.â\n\nâThereâs a lot of narrative of learning how to go from fighting with something or with someone, to fighting for something or for someone. And thereâs a lot of that journey for the whole record,â she says.\n\nUnlike âRolling Up the Welcome Mat,â which she describes as a reflective release, âPatterns\" is active and in the moment. âThe heartbeatâ of the album is about \"analyzing yourself and the people that you love the most in order to grow.â\n\nThat comes across in the previously released track âCowboys Cry Too,â featuring Noah Kahan â the only collaboration on the album and an empathic look at toxic masculinity from a female perspective â and the new single âSorry Mom,â out Friday. It is a swaying, guitar-pop confessional with intergenerational appeal, and it will no doubt strike a chord.\n\nâItâs an intimate song,â she says. âThe first line is, âSorry, mom, I smelled like cigarettes.' You know, itâs the things that your mom doesnât really want to hear. But then you get to the chorus and the meat of it and the heart of it, and itâs a letter of thanks to my mom for raising me the way she did.â\n\nâSorry Mom\" is one of many love songs on the album: Like âCowboys,â which was written for the men in her life, or a lush song of self-preservation and celebration called âFirst Rodeo,â that's romantic in theme. These are the kind of songs that can be realized in a safe writing and recording environment.\n\nTo make âPatterns,â Ballerini enlisted an all-woman team. She co-produced and co-wrote the album with Alysa Vanderheym, and also worked with songwriters Jessie Jo Dillon, Little Big Town's Karen Fairchild and Hillary Lindsey. âIâve never felt so safe making an album before, top to bottom. There was more pressure on this record just because of all the ears and eyeballs that âWelcome Matâ got,\" Ballerini says. âAnd so, I wanted to safely make this one where I didnât feel the pressure from the inside.â\n\nThey went on writing retreats together, and the process âproduced something that felt streamlined without feeling too monotonous, and something that naturally has a lot of warmth and empathy and heart,\" she says. \"Because thatâs what we do as women.â\n\nThat level of comfortability allowed for exciting experimentation as well. Ballerini is a country musician, through-and-through, but she has is unafraid to take genre-bending risks, particularly on this album. âTo me, what makes me undoubtedly country is my storytelling and my songwriting. And that will never waver or change. But, per usual, I didnât overthink whether there was a banjo or a beat drop. And there are both on this record, as there have been on my other ones,\" she says. \"I think lyrically and content wise, I really just was team no rules. Nothingâs off limits.â\n\nThere are lighter songs here, and darker ones, self-discovery and insecurity, as well as different geographies. New York and South Carolina are characters, Ballerini exploring her âhair down human me and the more dressed up, nervous, outward facing me,â she says.\n\nâIt's my job to make a record that has something for everyone. But that comes from making a record thatâs true to me, and thatâs what I did,â she concludes. âAnd so, I just hope people feel something,â while listening. âWhatever it is.\""
