        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Here’s another hot title for Berlin. Penelope Cruz and Diane Kruger are in final talks to star in This Man, This Woman, a script by Frederic Raphael that will be helmed by Isabel Coixet. Her new film, Nobody Wants The Night, opens the 2015 Berlin International Film Festival. The film is backed by Fortitude International co-founders, Nadine de Barros and Robert Ogden Barnum and founder Daniel Wagner, and producer Mike Lobell. Fortitude is financing and handling foreign sales at the market. Lobell is producing and De Barros and Barnum are exec producing. CAA will make the domestic deal.\n\nThis is a beloved script by the writer of Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut. An estranged man, Matt Heller, and a woman, Martha Parks (Cruz) encounter each other by chance on a plane, and relive memories of their turbulent romantic relationship. Kruger will play Kirsty Sachs, a talk show host who has an affair with Heller and changes the course of his whirlwind relationship with Parks. They will land their male lead quickly and the whole thing’s on a fast track.\n\nLobell has been shepherding this one for a long time and he said: “It feels like a minor miracle to finally bring this passion of mine to the screen and to put together this dream cast including the superbly talented Penelope Cruz and Diane Kruger who are the perfect actresses to bring these multi-layered characters to life. Combined with an extraordinary director to help realize Freddie’s amazing script, there must be a movie God after all.”\n\nSaid de Barros and Barnum: “Frederic Raphael has written a mesmerizing script which closely examines a couple’s rollercoaster relationship over the years which will be brilliantly brought to life by the talented filmmaker Isabel Coixet. We can’t wait to introduce this hot title to buyers at EFM.”\n\nCoixet’s Nobody Wants The Night stars Juliette Binoche and is the seventh film she directed to play the Berlin fest. Cruz is repped by CAA and Untitled Entertainment and Kruger by UTA and Untitled Entertainment. Coixet is repped by CAA."
