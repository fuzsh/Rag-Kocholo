        "text": "ROME – The International Rome Film Festival on Monday announced the first four competition titles for its upcoming eighth edition, including Spike Jonze‘s Her and Out of the Furnace from Scott Cooper.\n\nAlso on tap for the Nov. 8-17 festival: Dallas Buyers Club, directed by Jean-Marc Vallee and starring Matthew McConaughey as an HIV-infected man who locks horns with the medical establishment over treatment, and Another Me, a mystery thriller from Isabel Coixet starring Sophie Turner (Game of Thrones). The film was originally rumored to be headed to Cannes under the title Panda Eyes.\n\nHer, meanwhile, stars Joaquin Phoenix and Amy Adams (along with the voice of Scarlett Johansson) in a romantic comedy about a man in love with his computer operating system.\n\nCooper’s Out of the Furnace features Christian Bale and Casey Affleck as brothers in a star-studded thriller that also features Woody Harrelson, Forest Whitaker, and Zoe Saldana.\n\nMonday’s announcement is the third – and biggest – in less than two weeks related to the lineup at the Rome festival, which has so far taken the unusual tack of announcing lineup selections in dribs and drabs rather than holding them for a single big announcement.\n\nEarlier, the fest said it would be part of the international launch of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire eight days before the film opened in the U.S., and before that it revealed that Jonathan Demme‘s latest feature film, Fear of Falling, would have its world premiere at the event.\n\nOrganizers did not say how many of the stars of the four films would make the trip to Rome to stroll down the festival’s red carpet ahead of the premieres.\n\nOf the four, only Coixet’s Another Me may be a world premiere. The film, which will be distributed by Fox International Pictures, is currently set to premiere in London on Nov. 15, near the end of the Rome festival.\n\nThe other three titles will all have been seen elsewhere ahead of their Rome premieres – at October’s New York Film Festival in the case of Her, via an October release in Norway for Out of the Furnace and a Toronto Film festival premiere earlier this month for Dallas Buyers Club. Still, the festival screenings will be a key part of the international launch for all the films.\n\nThe Rome festival is being run by former Venice artistic director Marco Mueller and former Warner Bros. Italia head Paolo Ferrari for the second year."
