        "text": "A self-described \"writer, teacher, advocate, and human person,” Rebekah Taussig grew up in the Midwest as the curious, resilient, imaginative youngest child in a family of eight. Born in Manhattan, Kansas, in the mid-1980s, Taussig was 14 months old when she was diagnosed with a malignant cancer that attacked her spine. After two years of intense treatments, chemotherapy, radiation, and two surgeries to treat the cancer, she was cancer-free, but had begun to lose mobility below the waist. As she details in Sitting Pretty, her parents, though loving and supportive, made no special accommodations for her in their modest home, and several years passed before she received her first wheelchair: a bright hot pink that she adored. Taussig continued to sleep in a bedroom on the top floor of the house in a top bunk—a hard-won spot among six siblings—pulling her body up without the assistance of ramps or handrails. All of that, Taussig explained to Kansas Alumni Magazine, shaped her youth. “On the one hand, it shaped me pretty scrappy and kind of adaptable,” she said. “It made me creative and imaginative in that way. I also think it made me less self-conscious…There wasn’t a lot of spotlight on my disability.”\n\nIt also meant, however, that Taussig was never connected to the disability community or disability literature as a child. As a result, she went many years without processing the challenges and erasures that had shaped her experiences. It wasn’t until she began studying disability as a graduate student at the University of Kansas that she experienced a major shift in how she understood disability, both personally and in the larger world. “In my 20s—through education and getting to know the disabled community— it felt like I was able to put on an entirely new lens through which I see the world around me,” she shared with Publisher’s Weekly. She wanted to recreate that transformation for other people through her writing.\n\nInstagram offered Taussig an easily accessible space to explore that work. Through an account she named @sitting_pretty, Taussig began to share “mini-memoirs”: captions filled with stories and thoughts about her life, attached to images that included her paralysis and her wheelchair. She didn't crop out or obscure her disability in the photos, but brought it to the forefront. These posts would grow into Sitting Pretty (HarperCollins), a “memoir-in-essays” processing a lifetime of memories and complicating the one-dimensional representations of disability that are common in literature and media.\n\nTaussig hopes one of the main takeaways from her book is “this idea of accessibility as a project for all of us in the way that we’re all attached to bodies,” she said on the National Endowment for the Arts’ Art Works podcast. It’s a project that can be born of “play and imagination and creativity,” and “doesn’t have to be sterile and medical and dreadful but open and expansive and maybe a little bit enjoyable as well.”"
