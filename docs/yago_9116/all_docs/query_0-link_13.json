Plus, I feel like the ratio of upper-middle class/rich people stories to grinding poverty is about 7-to-1 in the movie world, so the living situation in this was an interesting change.\n\nThe verdict: Recommended\n\nCost: Free from Multnomah County Library\n\nWhere watched: at home\n\nConsider also watching:\n\nTake this waltz (directed by Sarah Polley)\n\nAway from Her (directed by Sarah Polley)\n\nStories We Tell (directed by Sarah Polley)"
