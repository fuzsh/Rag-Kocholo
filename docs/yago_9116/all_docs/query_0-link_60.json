        "text": "My Life Without Me - Canadian Drama Film\n\nMy life without me is a 2003 Canadian drama film, directed by Isabel Coixet who also wrote the script, inspired by the book ?Pretending the bed is a raft? by Nancy Kincaid. The movie follows the story of a young woman named Sarah and everything that happens to her when she finds out she will die soon. Sarah Polley plays the leading role, with Scott Speedman, Alfred Molina, Mark Ruffalo, and Deborah Harry as part of the remaining cast.\n\nAnn (Sarah Polley) is a hard-working 23-year-old mother with two small daughters, an unemployed husband (Scott Speedman), a mother (Deborah Harry) who sees her life as a failure, and a jailed father whom she has not seen for ten years. Her life changes dramatically when, during a medical checkup following a collapse, she is diagnosed with metastatic ovarian cancer and told that she has only two months to live.\n\nDeciding not to tell anyone of her condition and using the cover of anemia, Ann makes a list of things to do before she dies. She decides to change her hair, record birthday messages for the girls for every year until they're 18 and tries to set up her husband with another woman.\n\nFeeling a longing to experience a life that was never available to her, she seeks out a man to experience how it feels to be in a sexual relationship with someone other than her husband. Her experiment ends up taking an emotional toll when she meets with a man named Lee, who ends up madly in love with her and is left heartbroken when Ann breaks it off with him. He meets with her one last time and says that he will do anything to make her happy, taking care of her daughters and even finding her husband a new job. She ends their relationship and never tells him that she is dying.\n\nAt the end of the film, Ann records a message to her husband, telling him that she loves him, and another one to Lee, telling him the same. She then leaves all tapes that she has recorded with her doctor, asking him to deliver them after her death."
