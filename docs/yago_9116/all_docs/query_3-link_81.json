        "text": "December 5, 2023\n\n“I was forced to acknowledge too late, much too late, that I too had loved, that I was capable of suffering, and that I was human after all.”\n\n4 1/2 stars. Wow. This tiny, disquieting book carries a sadness that the most popular tearjerkers could never hope to capture.\n\nIt sits outside of genre, outside of time, outside of the reality we know, introducing the reader to a world unfamiliar to both them and the unnamed protagonist. The result is a palpable feeling of wonder and loneliness.\n\nI have decided to round up because this book made me feel so deeply, and because I have decided that my personal frustrations are perhaps misguided. There were things that I was hoping for from this book that I didn't get, but then I was never promised them, and, in fact, the past tense narration forewarned I would not get them. So that's my problem.\n\nThe story starts in an underground bunker where thirty-nine women and one young girl-- our narrator --are imprisoned in a cage. They don't remember how they got there and they have no idea why they are there. The women remember a life before the cage with families, friends and jobs, but the child remembers only their current existence. They are watched over and fed by male guards who tell them nothing. It seems they are doomed to live and die in this cage... until one day a combination of chance and ingenuity provide an opportunity for freedom.\n\nIt is part eerie pastoral dystopia, part a deeply introspective novel about hope, loneliness and the things that give life meaning. The novel swings between the invigorating feeling of hope and the numbing despair of hopelessness.\n\nI found myself wondering at one point if it was supposed to be a metaphor. The relentless pursuit of answers, of meaning, in a world that ultimately makes no sense. But perhaps I am overthinking things.\n\nEither way, this short novel sat like a ball of anxiety in my throat from beginning to end. What a sad, evocative little story.\n\nFebruary 14, 2024\n\nDo yourself a favor and read this.\n\nThe second half of this book blew my mind. Very bleak but it will haunt me forever.\n\nBest book of 2022: https://youtu.be/lQBAza0zdj8\n\nUpdate: Reread it in French (no idea how to add another edition here) and liked it even more.\n\nJanuary 14, 2023\n\nI WHO HAVE NEVER READ A BOOK LIKE THIS\n\nJanuary 23, 2023\n\nThis is desolate and despondent. But it never tricks you into thinking it will be anything else. It tells you from page one that this isn't a happy story and that you'll be left wanting. But the story-tellers we are trick ourselves into believing that everything will get wrapped up in a nice little bow. No. False. This is pure science fiction. I don't know what was going on at any point of this book but by god am I so glad it exists. A women wrote this in the 90s??? Iconic. Never before seen. Stunning.\n\nFor such a short book, it packs a massive punch. Almost anything you could have questions about in a dystopian world are brought up in these mere 188 pages.\n\nI can't say I ever felt fulfilled or happy reading this book but it definitely left me reeling and talking about the subject matter with everyone who had the displeasure of being within ear shot of me that week.\n\nCritically this book is a 5 star. But by vibes, it's a 4.\n\nMarch 25, 2020\n\n‘I was forced to acknowledge too late, much too late, that I too had loved, that I was capable of suffering, and that I was human after all.’\n\nViscerally disturbing, elegant and dignified. Better even than The Handmaid’s Tale.\n\nThis is the most haunting and thought-provoking book I have read in a very long time. Harpman’s prose is stark and stylistically perfect, charged throughout with an agonising inexorability. It’s a powerful concept besides: a slim dystopian novel narrated by an anonymous woman, whose only life she has ever known is that of being locked in a cage in a bunker with thirty-nine other women. Her narrative is deeply introspective, despite her complete and utter inexperience. And regardless of her intense capacity for emotion, she is convinced she is not entirely human.\n\nAt once exquisite and devastating, I am at a loss to understand how this has not reached a wider audience. I Who Have Never Known Men is a profoundly sad novel that revels in its ambiguity.\n\nJuly 28, 2022\n\nthat might be the single greatest, most traumatizing last sentence in a book that i have ever read\n\n----------\n\nthe title: god, i wish that were me…\n\nthe content: god, i’m so happy that’s not me.\n\nMarch 30, 2024\n\n2.7\n\nNajwiększe rozczarowanie tego roku 😭😭😭\n\nMarch 31, 2021\n\nI found this book when aimlessly browsing for available books on my library app. I’m so glad I did and added it to my favourite list straight after reading.\n\nI loved so much about it including the subject matter and the length. It felt unique, fresh and mature.\n\nAlthough there is no real explanation of events, which would normally drive me mad, I still enjoyed it immensely. This may be due to reading the introduction which was somewhat revealing and prepared me to not expect any explanation of the characters predicament.\n\nJanuary 17, 2024\n\nI’m shocked to be giving this 1 star. I really thought it was going to be 5 stars so I’m very disappointed. The main reason this is 1 star is because it literally went no where. The same thing kept happening over and over. Nothing new was given, the plot was virtually non-existent. It just went no where but because the writing is philosophical I’m supposed to ignore that? I don’t think this is worth picking up tbh.\n\n1 star\n\nJuly 8, 2022\n\n(3.5) i want to die. and no i won't elaborate on that, just pray for my sanity y'all\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\nJa, która nie znosi książek pozostawiających czytelnika bez wyjaśnień.\n\nMarch 23, 2023\n\nI who have never known men is an astounding piece of speculative and dystopian fiction with discussions on womanhood, love and death, all with amazing character studies! A bleak but powerful read, this is one that will undoubtedly stay with me for quite some time.\n\nFebruary 9, 2024\n\nI would definitely encourage anyone interested in reading this book to not look too much into what this book is actually about.\n\nIf you have no idea what this book is about and are reading this review, here’s what I’ll say: this is a story about a girl growing up in confinement and how she learns to free herself through her mind. And yet along the way, she wonders is she really free?\n\nNow you can pick this book up and have your own mind blown.\n\nI loved how this had both a really intriguing plot, but also a deep philosophical examination of what it means to be a human, to live and love and laugh and learn.\n\nI truly never knew where this book was going next. It’s quite a short novel and yet full of so much.\n\nThis would make an excellent bookclub selection as well.\n\nI feel like I won’t stop thinking about this book for a long time. It’s one of those stories that gets a hook in you and doesn’t let go.\n\nMarch 26, 2019\n\nAn enigmatic book, haunting and mysterious but ultimately frustratingly open-ended: if you're the kind of reader who needs to have things tied up and explained by the end then step away now - we have no idea why these women have been incarcerated in a bunker, who their male guards are, why the siren goes off, what has happened to the outside world, even whether they're still on earth...\n\nWhat starts out with a dystopian feel turns into a kind of existentialist meditation as 'the girl', our nameless narrator, ends up as possibly the only woman left alive - without companions or much purpose other than staying alive in her threatless existence, the book asks what is human life? Ultimately more 'Waiting for Godot' than 'The Handmaid's Tale' I found this weirdly compelling. 3.5 stars as I would have liked a bit more material to work with.\n\nFebruary 19, 2024\n\n2.5 stars\n\nSPOILER🛑 but you should probably take the title of the book very literally, because she really has never and will never know men or KNOW ANYTHING AND NEITHER WILL WE.\n\nI am actually so mad. I wish I knew this had one of those annoying open endings with zero answers. Just repetitive ramblings from start to end.\n\nI was waiting with bated breath for something to happen, the author would even tease me with the possibility of a revelation. But don't hold your breath like I did. Every time you think it's something interesting, it's just them finding the same shit for 20 years.\n\nI was dying of curiosity about the mystery of the women's circumstances, it was genuinely the only thing that had me hooked amongst the repetitive writing. It didn't even cross my mind that something so suspenseful would never be revealed.\n\nThe narrator and I were left in a pile of unanswered questions, accompanied by a despondent feeling that came with the ending of this book. It was completely depressing in a way that mirrors a real hunger for discovering hidden answers to questions that will never be found or be just out of reach.\n\nI have understood nothing about the world in which I live. I have criss-crossed it in every direction but I haven't discovered its boundaries\n\nWas this perhaps a metaphor about the uncertain reality of our own lives? Yea IDGAF, give me answers.\n\nJuly 25, 2024\n\n4.5 stars rounded up\n\nI Who Have Never Known Men was a strangely compelling reading experience.\n\nThis bizarre and somewhat unsettling story made me reflect on the meaning of life. Can it make sense to live in an absurd world with irrational rules, senseless bans, and little hope for a less grim future?\n\nForty women are locked up in a cage underground for no apparent reason. Among them is a young girl who has no memories of her life outside the cage. She was brought to this strange prison when she was too young to realize what was going on.\n\nThe guards watch the women around the clock, never leaving them alone and never talking to them. Their every move is scanned, their conversations overheard. Sounds like a nightmare, right? But the women have no choice but to resign to their lot. Some of them have attempted suicide, but the guards intervened in time to prevent them from killing themselves. Why do they want the prisoners to continue their existence in the cage? The women keep asking themselves this question.\n\nMemories of their lives before captivity may have faded, but the women vaguely recall the violence they were subjected to at the beginning of their captivity. The guards use this visceral memory to control the women. They no longer need to use the whip to make the prisoners obey the rules.\n\nBut what about the always taciturn guards? Are they free, or are they forced to do the dirty work? Do they have a choice?\n\nThe chances of finding answers are very slim. This story is not about answers, not about coherent explanations. Things happen to the characters. They must adapt, react, and deal with the consequences of events beyond their control. Their journey would have ended much sooner were it not for a stroke of luck.\n\nThis strange novel shows that every life is unique and has its meaning. The meaning of life may be life itself. Even if the journey has no purpose and leads nowhere, it matters.\n\nThe world the story takes place in is eerie and stripped of color, action, or variety. Bunkers, cages, and hills dominate this alienated and alienating universe. Yet the women have their stories and even their happy moments.\n\nTheir stories are unique, even if some of them have no past in the familiar sense of that word.\n\nThe youngest of them says: \"After all, if I was a human being, my story was as important as that of King Lear or of Prince Hamlet that William Shakespeare had taken the trouble to relate in detail.\" And the story she told showcases that our heroine has never been intimidated by obstacles.\n\nI liked this story more than I was expecting. Although it is probably not for everyone, I think those who love the dystopian genre would find it worthwhile. And it is a relatively quick read.\n\nJanuary 5, 2023\n\nIt is important to note that the majority of the themes explored in this book deal with sensitive subject matters. My review, therefore, touches on these topics as well. Many people might find the subject matters of the book as well as those detailed in my review overwhelming. I would suggest you steer clear of both if this is the case. Please note that from this point forward I will be writing about matters which contain reflections on suicide, euthanasia, physical deterioration due to illness, & others.\n\nThe narrator without a name writes to us on papers hidden in a bunker, assumedly kept there to house the invisible puppeteers that rule the world she walks through; ignorantly holding inventory of the bushes, water streams & void of life that crosses her path throughout her daily journey. Yet, at the end, when she has learnt to read, write & reflect on everything that has transpired in her life—desolate, solicitous, hollow, & muted—the narrator has no ill will for the questions that have exceeded the roster of a human’s ability to carry things left unsaid.\n\nIn this book, the reader finds a story from the perspective of a person without a name as she recalls the years of her life spent in a world that she cannot understand nor are there clues to explain it. This leaves this review a difficult one for me to embark on writing. Where is there a solid place to start when critiquing a piece of work that has at once beautifully painted a landscape that the mind automatically fills with the normalcy we see in our own, yet reminds us swiftly & without qualms that everything we cherish is no longer available to us in this realm? How does one put into words what Harpman has exceedingly done with the human vernacular; communicating in such stellar fashion the empathy one feels for familiarity in such extreme & unfathomable situations?\n\nAs always, I shall attempt to start at the beginning, as there seems no other place to commence.\n\nThe narrator of this book is introduced to the reader as she nears the end of her memoir. Having found herself in what we come to recognize & know as a bunker of sorts, she sits within the rooms known to her throughout the later years of her life as a home, & recollects the events that led her to where she is. Having been taken from an original place that she cannot call to mind, alongside 39 other women, the narrator grows to the age of about 14 or 15 in a prison cell. Though it seems that Harpman has described a prison cell, the likes of which I cannot truly call to mind, she has given the reader sufficient details to understand that the place in which all these women live is nothing but scarce & demeaning.\n\nThis is the first point of praise that I would like to give Harpman. Her uncompromising & unfaltering ability to describe a world that appears—for all intents & purposes—desolate, while simultaneously giving the reader the ability to illustrate a world that is large & overwhelming, is superb. The words employed throughout this book & the prose designated to craft the story are exquisite. I have no doubt that Harpman recognized that one does not need to put forth eternally long & tongue-twisting words to describe what the catatonic emotions & experiences of all the characters within this story were. A true talent with words resides in the mind of the individual who can purpose vocabulary in such a way as to enthral every person with ease.\n\nThe women who reside in this prison cell have lost most of their memories of the lives they led before their captivity. The reader gleams moments of small reflection upon which the characters seem to hold fond feelings; a marriage to a kind man, children that they loved, the hopes they held for career growth, & the social rules they abided by. The impoverished recollections lead the reader to immediately feel a longing for further information & details, both of which are never granted to us. So much is said with so little. Imminently we are given the opportunity to feel nostalgia for all the darkened memories we hold in our own minds. Just as the women in the prison cell, so too do we hold things in the recesses of our minds that we cannot quite call to the forefront. Suppose someone asked us what life was like prior to this very instant & suppose they asked us to describe in colourful details everything that transpired; how would we go about doing that?\n\nEach of the women believes that their experiences or abilities to recall their past lives—the lives they led before being imprisoned—have been altered by force. They do not believe that they have simply forgotten what they experienced by the sheer distance of time but, that someone had been poisoning them; their memories forcefully shadowed into places their minds cannot reach. We are never given confirmation or a refusal of these assumptions as it does not ultimately dictate the weight of the plot for the reader to be explained everything in formulaic reasoning. Suffice it for the reader to know that the happiness they felt within their bones has been stolen from them, replaced with the singular existence they share in the cell.\n\n39 women reside in a prison cell & are prevented from touching, crowding together & are simultaneously permitted no privacy when using the toilet. The employment & threat of violence has kept them submissive to this way of life, one that is contrary to what has come to be known as necessities of human existence. The narrator herself has grown into her teen years without being caressed or coddled; never truly developing a longing for human contact she retains the inmate impulse to seek out the reciprocity of another person. When the cataclysmic event takes place, one that we are never granted an explanation for, the women are free from the cell yet are never free from the imprisonment that took them away from what they loved.\n\nThis particular aspect of the story is one that I pondered very deeply. Being a person, myself, that does not feel the longing for closeness with another human being—not being drawn to touch or being held, rather not enjoying that practice—I wondered how long I should be able to go on in sustaining that if I were taken at this moment, to live in a cell where I had no free will to choose whether or not I could hug someone else. The narrator saw her formative years drift by in the environment of prevention & control, therefore she knew no different. The adult women, on the other hand, knew what it was like to share in an embrace or to hold someone’s hand; closeness represents a variety of things that are intended to offer comfort & love to another. Would anyone of us be able to see ourselves living solicitous within a group?\n\nMany of us do that right now, in this life, where nothing is dictated to us or forced onto our lives such as to the women in this book. Many authors have sought to explain the experience of a person who feels alone among many & I have found it to be personally enjoyable when I find authors who seek the opposite. I appreciate it when someone with the talent for words & crafting of stories, writes about people who are individualized; when a story explores the solitude of a person who is not lonely because they enjoy themselves & they seek not the necessities that others feel drawn to possess. I find these stories oddly comforting & rewarding to read. The human condition is vast in its experiences. I am glad that mine can be found in the pages of a book without the author attempting to elicit sympathy for something that does not pang me.\n\nThis is not to say that I can speak to everything that the narrator experiences as I found myself feeling a longing to find her bunker & a small hope that someone might suddenly come upon her before her time was up. Why would I feel this way when logic tells me that she is certainly alone in this life? What was it about a nameless person that drew me to feel such a connection? Does reading about a negative situation lead one automatically to sentiments of forlorn sorrow? Does one need to connect with a character in a story to feel empathy for them & their situation or is it enough to recognize the depth of the human psyche’s abilities to understand?\n\nCan the reader truly begin to imagine what these women must have felt upon coming upon the other bunkers which housed the prison cells of 39 people each time, all of whom were dead & decomposing? Can one truly understand, without living the experience, what it must be like to wander without purpose or knowledge of where one is meant to go? I have an inkling that this particular part of the story is something many individual readers may relate to. The narrator did not know her world & the reader may feel sorrow for her yet, how much do we know & understand our own world? Some people have gone to the moon & yet, for many people, the universe resides cooped within their property lines. Does this make either situation bad or good? I suppose that it depends on whom you ask & at what point in time, during their lives, you seek them out to ponder the question.\n\nIn reality, this book merits a full study; deconstructing each experience, the placement of every bush, the defining of every singular thought, yet, I think that every person should be drawn to this story if only to find a part of themselves within the plot. A nameless entity is not unknown, though we cannot put it into words. The narrator, though she does not have a born name—a government identifier, a religious nomenclature—is just as much an individual human being as Anthea, the person she loved. The love that is able to blossom within the relationships that the women share encourages the reader to reflect on their own experiences. Though the world may be bleak & though we cannot always call to mind the things that have brought us happiness, there are always unheard words in the heart, in the mind, that can leave us settled & comforted.\n\nWhen all is said & done, I find myself left in silence; a droning quiet that permits me the time to reflect on every instance that is shared between myself & the narrator. I should hope to find myself reading this story again when the time is right, just as the narrator came across her home when she least expected it, so too do I hope to remember the deliberation & contemplation that was elicited within me upon my first read.\n\nPhilosophical works do not need to feel overwhelming, though they often leave one feeling debilitated. How can one possibly contemplate every single detail in a single sitting? There is so much to question & connect; too many instances of detail & depth. Without these stories, I should find myself very much resembling the narrator; alone with my thoughts that limit the awareness, I hold of the world, residing in the crevices of my mind.\n\nThank you to Edelweiss+, Transit Books, & Jacqueline Harpman for the free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review!\n\nSpecial praise for Ros Schwartz & her superbly enthralling translation of the original French text into English.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nNovember 30, 2023\n\nActual rating: 4,5\n\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is bc my curiosity wasn't answered.\n\nNovember 19, 2021\n\n\"the giver\" meets \"pew\" - new favorite\n\nApril 27, 2023\n\nI found Jacqueline Harpman’s execution of her dystopian world believable and compelling. 39 women trapped in an underground cage, with no notion of time or how they got there. We follow the 40th prisoner, a young girl who sits outcast in the corner until their group of 40 escapes into the aboveground strange world that awaits them.\n\nHarpman’s writing made the events in this book feel scary and important. Her prose is ominous, sparse yet vivid enough to create a satisfyingly creepy atmosphere. Harpman raises interesting questions here: what would a world without men look like? What makes life meaningful when we strip our day-to-day existence to the bare minimum? To what extent can relationships with others satisfy us even in situations of despair?\n\nMy only disappointment of the novel was that I felt like it didn’t make enough of a point for me to feel fully content with how it ended. It’s open-ended, perhaps intentionally so, though I interpreted that open-endedness and lack of a more direct message as a kind of copout. Still, I think this book would be fun to discuss with folks, is thought-provoking, and is assured in its execution on the sentence-level.\n\nMarch 15, 2024\n\nZrobiła na mnie piorunujące wrażenie, spodziewałem się, że mi się spodoba, ale i tak jestem zaskoczony, że aż tak. Fenomenalna, na pewno nie będę mógł przestać o niej myśleć jeszcze przez długi czas.\n\nJune 26, 2022\n\nI really enjoyed the style of this book. For me the straightforward sentences reflect accurately the ability of our narrator, who writes this story at the end of her life. I particularly liked the beginning which follows the developing mind of our narrator, the child, and later the unnamed woman. I always respond well to intellect driven narratives. There is nothing flashy, extraneous or dramatical - although there are disturbing and emotional events.\n\nFrom the beginning our narrator is different, because she is the only child held as a prisoner with 39 women. They live in an iron-barred cage in a bunker, patrolled around the clock by three guards on changing shifts.\n\nThe child is angry and rebels against the women with whom she feels she can share nothing - they withhold the secret of men from her. One woman approaches her, Annabel, who demands to know why she is alone, sulking different. And the child has reasoned there is no need for her to explain anything - she says so, and watches the astonishment on the woman's face. There is no way to punish the child into her usual obedience. Her stunted, but slowly maturing body, has caused her awareness and her brain to question and search for answers. She starts to apply logic to their situation.\n\nShe confides in the only woman she likes, Anthea and together they start to work out how to measure the time passing. The child counts her heartbeats, using Anthea's approximate calculation that there should be about 72 or so in a minute - in her former life Anthea was a nurse. They have been convinced for some time that they are not following a daily cycle of 24 hours. Even to asses the time in the years they have been there is hard to establish. The woman guess they have been locked in their dungeon/bunker for maybe 12 or more years; they cannot remember why they were brought there, and have no information at all about their present situation and can only remember very little of their former lives. The guards never speak to them.\n\nThe story is fascinating; the writer who came to mind as I read, was Ursula K. Le Guin - although I don't think Harpman's book qualifies as science-fiction. It certainly deals with a catastrophe of some-kind, and the women when they are finally outside, are never able to ascertain if they are on their home planet. The guards have disappeared and Anthea suggests that maybe a helicopter has lifted them to safety - and so in a way we are able to work out approximately the time-frame from where the women came.\n\nI deducted a star because the ending is very sad; the end could quite easily be interpreted as the end of mankind. We don't know. Our narrator, now an elderly woman of 60 plus is dying. She writes her life-story in the hope that a person will find it and in this way her life and her death will not have been for nothing.\n\nShort note - it was first published as 'Moi qui n'ai pas connu les hommes' - 'I who know nothing of men' - was published in France in 1995 and then translated and published in the UK, in 1997.\n\nThe edition I have uses the title - The Mistress of Silence, which I prefer.\n\nMay 24, 2024\n\n\"My memory begins with my anger.\"\n\n\"Inevitably, with memory comes pain.\"\n\n\"Time is a question of being human.\"\n\n\"Conversation creates time.\"\n\nGiven the subject, I thought this would be a feminist novel. It isn't. It is a humanist novel. Gender and sexuality are actually quite muted for large parts of it, and I think it was the best decision the author could make because it allowed her to retain the focus on the experiment it proposes. A great dystopian/speculative (science) fiction novel must do that in order to succeed, especially in a book with no answers.\n\nAugust 3, 2024\n\nI don’t think I will ever be the same again after reading this. This story is so exquisite all the way through but the last 15-20 pages are true perfection. This book exceeded every single possible expectation that I had going into it. A new all time favorite of mine and one that will never leave me. I already want to pick it back up and read it again.\n\nJanuary 15, 2024\n\ni who will never be the same again"
