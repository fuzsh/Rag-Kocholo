Passing off her increasing weakness as a mild case of anemia, Ann begins to put her priorities in order in preparation for the last few months of her life. She records birthday messages for her daughters, visits her estranged father in prison and even seeks a replacement wife for her husband, Lee.\n\nThis film is a free screening hosted by the Friends of the South Orange Library.
