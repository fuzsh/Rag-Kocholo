        "text": "THE MASK YOU LIVE IN\n\nThe Mask You Live In follows boys and young men as they struggle to stay true to themselves while negotiating America’s narrow definition of masculinity.\n\nPressured by the media, their peer group, and even the adults in their lives, our protagonists confront messages encouraging them to disconnect from their emotions, devalue authentic friendships, objectify and degrade women, and resolve conflicts through violence. These gender stereotypes interconnect with race, class, and circumstance, creating a maze of identity issues boys and young men must navigate to become “real” men.\n\nExperts in neuroscience, psychology, sociology, sports, education, and media also weigh in, offering empirical evidence of the “boy crisis” and tactics to combat it.\n\nThe Mask You Live In ultimately illustrates how we, as a society, can raise a healthier generation of boys and young men.\n\nTHE ISSUE\n\nResearch shows that compared to girls, boys in the U.S. are more likely to be diagnosed with a behavior disorder, prescribed stimulant medications, fail out of school, binge drink, commit a violent crime, and/or take their own lives.\n\nHOW TO WATCH\n\nHelp shape the national conversation around healthy masculinity by hosting a screening of The Mask You Live In. With the right screening resources, you can arrange a screening in a few easy steps. Total Running Time: 1h 37m. Stream, buy or license the film HERE.\n\nRATINGS"
