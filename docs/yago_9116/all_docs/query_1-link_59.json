        "text": "by Wendy Mitchell\n\nThe plot of Isabel Coixet’s “My Life Without Me” — a young mother\n\ndecides not to tell her family she has terminal cancer — has all the\n\ntrappings of a Lifetime movie. But the execution of the film doesn’t stray\n\ninto that territory, thanks to Coixet’s guidance and the subtle performances\n\nof the film’s three stars, Sarah Polley, Mark Ruffalo, and Scott\n\nSpeedman. Polley plays Ann, a young blue-collar worker that has two\n\nyoung girls with her husband Don (Speedman). When Ann is diagnosed with\n\ncancer, she stands by her husband but also embarks on a passionate affair\n\nwith a stranger, Lee (Mark Ruffalo). Though the film is a tearjerker, it\n\nalso has its uplifting moments. indieWIRE managing editor Wendy Mitchell\n\ncaught up with the film’s three stars during the Toronto International\n\nFilm Festival. “My Life Without Me” opens today from Sony Pictures\n\nClassics.\n\nSARAH POLLEY\n\niW: Why did you want to take on the role of Ann?\n\nSarah Polley: I read the script, along with every other actress in\n\nthe world. It got sent to me, I just fell in love with it. I read it about\n\nfour in the morning, and I had a bit of a breakdown. I just really, really\n\nwanted to play the part. There are always actresses that I could think of\n\nthat could play it better than me, but there was something personal that I\n\ncould bring to it. I talked to Isabel on the phone, and we arranged to meet\n\nin New York, it happened very naturally.\n\niW: How do you begin to prepare for an emotional experience like\n\nthis?\n\nPolley: It involved a couple of months of preparation, which was\n\nreally like a depression for me. Actually doing it wasn’t as difficult, then\n\nit became practical. Ann herself doesn’t feel sorry for herself, she doesn’t\n\nhave a long wallow period, she is very practical and she has a lot to do, so\n\nthat’s what she focuses on. So my personal wallowing happened before the\n\nfilm. In terms of preparing for it, I don’t generally like to use my life to\n\ninform a role, I feel like it cheapens your life, it cheapens your\n\nexperience. But with this it was inevitable that those connections would be\n\nmade with my personal life, whether I wanted to or not, because my mother\n\ndied of cancer when I was very young. I’ve seen it from the kids’ point of\n\nview. It was very rewarding and cathartic for me to see it from a mother’s\n\npoint of view, and realizing how much hard it is on the mother than it is on\n\nthe kids.\n\niW: How did you get into that maternal mentality?\n\nPolley: It was a credit to Isabel [Coixet, the director]. I’m\n\nvery, very close with my nieces and nephew, they are probably the most\n\nimportant thing in my life. I spend a lot of time around kids, I love kids.\n\nI’ve always wanted to have kids, so that felt like the most fun part. That\n\nwas the most exciting. But I took it seriously, and I was worried that it\n\nwouldn’t be convincing to see me as a mother. I developed strong\n\nrelationships with those kids before we started shooting so that really\n\nhelped.\n\niW: How do you keep a movie about a subject matter like this from\n\ngetting too maudlin or sentimental?\n\nPolley: Because I think the key to Ann is that she’s not someone\n\nwho’s going to cry through the movie, she’s going to take action, she’s very\n\npractical. She doesn’t have much time to get things done. As long as we\n\nfocused on the pragmatism, it wasn’t going to get maudlin. There’s fantasy\n\nand romance and a fantastical tone to it, so that helped not make it so\n\ndepressing.\n\niW: How was the shoot?\n\nPolley: It was really fun and great and easy, and I can’t really\n\nexplain that (laughs). I find that the more intense and difficult and\n\nheart-wrenching the project is, the more fun the shoot. Maybe that’s because\n\nI’m a sadistic person, but I love this kind of material.\n\niW: Do you still carry parts of this role with you?\n\nPolley: I didn’t walk away from this unchanged. It adds a kind of\n\ngravity to your life, to just live with the idea for a few months of what\n\nyou’d do if you only had two months to live. It inevitably gives gravity to\n\nmost decisions you make. It was really formative.\n\nMARK RUFFALO\n\niW: Were you nervous about doing the cancer victim genre?\n\nMark Ruffalo: This isn’t a movie of the week. It’s really\n\nunflinching and unsentimental and even funny. I read the part of Lee and I’d\n\nnever gotten to play a man with such gravity to him. It’s something I’d\n\nalways wanted to play. He only has 8 scenes, but he has quite a journey to\n\nmake in those eight scenes. The writing doesn’t necessarily demark it as a\n\njourney. It points to one.\n\niW: Was that a challenge for you?\n\nRuffalo: Yes, it was an interesting challenge. How do I make what\n\nhe goes through play in the limited number of scenes, and make him a living\n\nbreathing character? I made sure that he had a little bit of movement in\n\neach [scene]. The character that you see in his first scene is very\n\ndifferent from what we see in the last scene. That’s an interesting acting\n\nproblem.\n\niW: One thing I found interesting is that we see Ann in love with\n\ntwo men.\n\nRuffalo: And they are both great guys.\n\niW: Yes, and she’s still a good person.\n\nRuffalo: It doesn’t indict her.\n\niW: Being married yourself, and believing in the sanctity of\n\nmarriage, how was it playing “the other man”?\n\nRuffalo: People are together for all different reasons and\n\nsometimes relationships stop working. People change, and I have no judgment\n\nabout that. Also, she’s dying, she gets a “get out of jail free” card. It’s\n\nodd: when people are dying, all bets are off. It becomes very clear where\n\nyou should be and where you shouldn’t be when you are facing your\n\nmortality.\n\niW: You’ve faced mortality with your brain tumor. Did that help\n\nyou relate to “My Life Without Me”?\n\nRuffalo: I could understand the movie that way. It was the first\n\njob I had coming back from my illness and I just read it and said, “I get\n\nthis. I have to be part of this movie.”\n\nSCOTT SPEEDMAN\n\nindieWIRE: Why were you attracted to this role of Don?\n\nScott Speedman: What attracted me to this guy was that he was a\n\npretty simple man, but there were some traps playing this part. I think a\n\nlot of people were looking at [the character] like he was a deadbeat dad and\n\nnot the most responsible fellow but I saw him as a very loving guy.\n\niW: He has a good heart.\n\nSpeedman: I think his fault would be that he may take his wife for\n\ngranted a little bit, he thinks she’s gonna be around forever. I think he\n\nthinks there’s no way they won’t be together. I think he’s just been with\n\nher since they were teenagers and he loves her unconditionally. He’s pretty\n\nsatisfied living in that trailer. I was attracted to how simple it was.\n\niW: One thing that I felt was unique about this film was that it\n\nis a love story between you and Ann but then also her and Lee, yet that\n\ndoesn’t really diminish her love for you.\n\nSpeedman: What she does with another guy isn’t about not loving\n\nme, it’s about the fact that she’s dying and she wants to know what it feels\n\nlike to fall in love again.\n\niW: going into a role like this, do you prepare? Did you read the\n\nshort story that the film is based on [Nanci Kinkaid’s “Pretending the Bed\n\nis a Raft”]? Did you talk to Isabel [Coixet] a lot?\n\nSpeedman: I tried to hang out with those kids. I did a lot of work\n\ngetting ready. I drove up to Vancouver by myself. I kind of spent a lot of\n\ntime by myself. I was pretty serious about spending time with those kids\n\nbecause I thought it was important to get across that we were actually a\n\nfamily.\n\niW: What did you learn from Sarah and Mark and what did they learn\n\nfrom you?"
