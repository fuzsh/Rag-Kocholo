        "text": "As the South African “branch” of RATP Group, Bombela Operating Company (Pty) Ltd (BOC) draws on its parent company’s considerable global expertise. The RATP Group, which is a shareholder in BOC, not only operates the rail and bus network in Paris but is also a worldwide leader in public transport, running services in more than 100 cities across 15 countries. BOC’s additional shareholding includes Strategic Partners Group (SPG), a South African firm with a significant local business presence. From a contractual perspective the Gautrain falls under the Gautrain Management Agency, who holds the contract with the Bombela Concession Company (BCC), who is responsible for the entire train system. The BOC under the concession company is responsible for operating and maintaining the system.\n\nNthabiseng Kubheka has served as the Chief Executive Officer of BOC since January 2021, guiding the company to sustained success with the Gautrain. In this exclusive feature with Railways Africa Magazine, we delve into the company’s focus on public transport, particularly as South Africa recently celebrated Transport Month.\n\nThe Afreximbank signed a Heads of Terms with Mota Engil Africa for the 175 million Euro facility which will capacitate Mota Engil Africa to take part in the Lobito Railway Project as one of the sponsors and developers in the project consortium.\n\nThe Lobito Railway Project involves the rehabilitation and development of new infrastructure of rail linking Angola, Zambia and Botswana which are interlinked trade partners, hence the project supports the increase of intra-African Trade.\n\nThe Dar es Salaam Commuter Train services experienced a significant disruption on Monday, November 6, 2023, due to an unexpected locomotive failure, as reported by the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA). The breakdown caused notable inconvenience to commuters relying on this crucial mode of transportation.\n\nThe incident illustrated the pressing difficulties TAZARA faces due to undercapitalization, which restricts the ability to expand and maintain the existing locomotive and coach assets.\n\nHopefully, a solution is in sight with the upcoming planned negotiations with Chinese investors for the modernization of TAZARA.\n\nThe Bombwe Railway Bridge has been officially commissioned by the Zambian Government, marking the resumption of passenger train operations between Livingstone and Mulobezi which were suspended for bridge repair works. The event was officiated by the Minister of Transport and Logistics, Hon. Frank Tayali. He expressed hope that these repairs are a step towards improving railway safety, reducing derailments, and shortening transit times along the Mulobezi Railway Line.\n\nHon. Tayali acknowledged the cost-effective efforts of Zambia Railways Limited and the collaboration of all stakeholders involved in the rehabilitation process. He highlighted the creation of over 35 jobs for local youths and the skill transfer benefits they received from working with the contractor over the past five months.\n\nEngineer Fred Mwila, Acting Managing Director of Zambia Railways Limited, urged the government to increase funding for further repairs on the Mulobezi line. This would ensure sustainable train operations and allow the replacement of wooden and steel sleepers with concrete ones annually. Engineer Mwila noted that the Mulobezi mixed passenger train annually transports about 26,000 passengers, underlining the importance of these operations for people and goods movement.\n\nThe rehabilitation process involved careful planning, engineering expertise, and collaboration with various stakeholders. The Ministry of Transport, the Government Inspector of Railways, and a team of engineers and construction professionals worked together to ensure the project met the highest industry standards.\n\nAfreximbank had signed a mandate letter to provide capital raise financial advisory services to the Anambra State Government of Nigeria for an estimated US$200-million facility to support the development of three major projects in the state, covering the Ikenga Mixed-Use Industrial City Project, the Anambra Export Emporium and the Akwaihedi Unubi Uga Automotive Industrial Park.\n\nThe Bank also signed an agreement to provide the state government with financial advisory services for the development of operational and governance framework for the Anambra Diaspora Fund, including capital raise financial advisory services for the Anambra Intra-City Rail Master Plan project and the Anambra Diaspora Fund. Kanayo Awani, Executive Vice President, Intra-African Trade Bank, signed for Afreximbank while Mark Okoye, Chief Executive Officer, Anambra State Investment Promotion and Protection Agency, signed for the state government.\n\nEuropean Commission gives antitrust approval for deal – Hitachi Rail was given clearance to proceed with its €1,660 million acquisition of Thales’ Ground Transportation Systems business on 30 October 2023.\n\nThe publication of the European Commission’s (EC) approval means that the deal has now received clearance from all 13 competition authorities which reviewed the acquisition. Prior to the European Commission’s clearance, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority gave its approval for the deal on 4 October 2023.\n\nAs a condition of securing approval for the acquisition, Hitachi Rail will divest its mainline signalling business located in France, Germany and the UK. The divestiture will be made in accordance with all relevant processes and consultations with employees and their representative bodies."
