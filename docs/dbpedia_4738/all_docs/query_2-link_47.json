Offshore platforms of Petrobrás\n\nInterim Consolidated Report 2020 10\n\n1.1 Economical and financial environment\n\nThe first half of 2020 will be remembered without any doubt by the appearance and spread of a virus, until that date unknown, denominated \"SARS-CoV-2\", which rapidly originated a worldwide pandemic (Covid - 19) that nowadays is responsible for approximately 24 million people infected and approximately 820,000 deaths.\n\nAs a result of the several measures adopted by the different States to contain the pandemic, from the mandatory confinement of populations, the closure of borders, the imposition of several barriers to the movement of goods and equipment's and the implementation of restrictive public health measures, with the consequent negative impact on the economy, it is foreseen that almost all developed countries will experience a significant contraction in their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2020, being part of that already been confirmed with the data released for the first half of the year. Thus, in most of the countries where the GROUP operates, according to the latest forecasts made by the IMF, the European Commission and the OECD, on average, it is estimated that Portugal and the Eurozone may see their GDP in 2020 decrease circa of 10 %, Mexico 9%, Brazil 9%, Colombia 5%, Mozambique 2% and Angola 1%. However, according to the same source of information, it is estimated that in 2021 those countries will evidence a growth in their GDP although lower than the decrease expected for 2020.\n\nIn addition, as a result of the expansionist monetary policies jointly implemented by the main world central banks, beside other macroeconomic factors, interest rates have remained at stable levels, namely in Europe and in the United States of America. However, in terms of commodities, namely oil, and the exchange rates of the currencies of the main countries in Africa and in Latin America where the GROUP operates, a high volatility and a fall in the respective prices occur.\n\nTaking in consideration the environment described above, the GROUP's activity in the first half of 2020 was not unaffected by the impacts caused by the pandemic, being essentially the Engineering and Construction (E&C) business who was the most affected due to the production interruptions / stoppages, sometimes caused by the restrictive public health measures implemented in the different countries where the GROUP operates, sometimes caused by the logistical constraints faced to move people, equipment's and goods. Regarding the Environment and Services (E&S) business, which comprises the collection, treatment and recovery of waste, as well as, the production and sale of energy, the impact caused by the pandemic was lower since those activities correspond to essential and strategic services for the normal functioning of the communities and so they continue to be provided with some normality.\n\nInterim Consolidated Report 2020 11\n\n1.2 Analysis of economic and financial performance\n\n(*) Includes others, eliminations and intra-group\n\nAs a result, essentially, of the constraints caused by the pandemic, the turnover (**) in the first half of 2020 amounted to 1,157 million euros, a decrease of circa of 14% when compared with the first half of 2019. However, it should be highlighted the asymmetric behaviour of that indicator between regions, with Europe contributing with an increase of circa of 12% and Africa and Latin America contributing with decreases of 15% and 33%, respectively.\n\nFollowing the above referred, Europe was the region that most contributed to the GROUP's turnover in the first half of 2020 with a 40% contribution (30% in the first half of 2019), much at the expense of Latin America which on that period contributed only with 26% (34% in the first half of 2019). Furthermore, in the first half of 2020, in the Europe region, the E&C business contributed with 29% to the GROUP 's turnover (23% in the first half of 2019) and the E&S business with 12% (9% in the first half of 2019).\n\nTurnover corresponds to the consolidated income statement caption of \"Sales and services rendered\"\n\nIncludes the EBITDA generated in the Europe region and others, eliminations and intra-group (****) Includes the EBITDA generated in the Africa and Latin America regions\n\nInterim Consolidated Report 2020 12\n\nIn the first half of 2020, as a result of a lower productivity and dilution of fixed costs arising from the negative impacts caused by the pandemic, the GROUP's EBITDA decrease 26% to 144 million euros, having this one been positively influenced by the Europe's performance (increase of 16%), which however was not enough to offset the less positive performance of Africa (24% decrease) and Latin America (55% decrease). As a result of the aforementioned, the EBITDA margin (EBITDA / Turnover) in the first half of 2020 reached 12.5%, a decrease of 1.9pp when compared with the first half of 2019.\n\nRegarding EBIT, this one amounted in the first half of 2020 to 33 million euros, an amount lower than the one recorded in the first half of 2019 (91 million euros), having it been negatively influenced by the reduction occurred in EBITDA, positively influenced by a small reduction in terms of amortisations, due to the fact that some equipment's have reached the end of its useful life, and negatively influenced by the recording of provisions and impairment losses (16 million euros) to deal with the potential negative effects caused by the Covid - 19 pandemic in the future collection of some accounts receivable and in the realization of some non-current assets.\n\nIn the first half of 2020, the GROUP invested circa of 94 million euros, of which it is worth to highlight 26 million euros assigned to a new medium and long term mining contract in Guinea-Conakry, circa of 26 million euros assign to the execution of the investment plan established for the EGF concessionary companies and circa of 5 million euros assign to the execution of a relevant project in the segment of E&S in Côte d'Ivoire.\n\nCapex corresponds to the algebraic sum of the increases and disposals of tangible assets, intangible assets and rights of use assets occurred in the period.\n\n(* *) Long-term contracts correspond to the mining contracts in Africa and to the energy business in Latin America.\n\nInterim Consolidated Report 2020 13\n\nAs at June 30, 2020, net debt (**) amounted to 1,248 million euros, an increase of circa of 34 million euros when compared with December 31, 2019, justified, essentially, by the investment performed in the period.\n\nAs at June 30, 2020, net debt plus factoring (***) and leasing (****) operations amounted to 1,651 million euros, a decrease of 45 million euros when compared with December 31, 2019.\n\nAs a result of the debt evolution and the operating performance at the semester, significantly influenced by the pandemic, the ratio that compares the total net debt with the EBITDA in the last 12 months reached 3.4x (2.5x at June 30, 2019).\n\nGross debt (*****) at June 30, 2020 amounted to 1,869 million euros, being 43% contracted at a variable rate with an average cost of 5.1% (5.2% at December 31, 2019). On the other hand, at June 30, 2020, 84% of the total gross debt was denominated in euros and this one had an average maturity of 2.6 years (2.5 years at December 31, 2019).\n\nAdditionally, at June 30, 2020, the GROUP maintained available unused credit lines of circa of 196 million euros resulting in a total amount of effective liquidity (******) of 817 million euros, corresponding to approximately 44% of the total gross debt.\n\nIn this chapter, it is also worth to highlight, in the first half of 2020, the GROUP's adherence to the moratorium mechanisms established by the Portuguese State / financial system within the scope of the support measures established to combat the pandemic, which allowed the postponement of approximately 340 million euros of reimbursements of principal and interest.\n\n1-yearnet debt includes all Angolan public debt securities (from Angola and Côte d'Ivoire at December 31, 2019) recorded under the captions \"Other financial investments recorded at amortized cost\" of the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n(**) Net debt corresponds to the algebraic sum of the following captions of the consolidated statement of financial position: \"Cash and cash equivalents without recourse\n\n- Demand deposits\", \"Cash and cash equivalents with recourse - Demand deposits\", \"Cash and cash equivalents with recourse - Term deposits\", \"Other financial investments recorded at amortized cost\"; \"Loans without recourse\" and \"Loans with recourse\". It should be noted that the leasing and factoring operations established by the Group are not accounted under the aforementioned captions.\n\n(***) Factoring operations are recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position under the captions \"Other financial liabilities\". (****) Leasing operations are recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position under the captions \"Lease liabilities\".\n\n(*****) Gross debt corresponds to the algebraic sum of net debt with the balances of the following captions of the consolidated statement of financial position \"Cash and cash equivalents without recourse - Demand deposits\", \"Cash and cash equivalents with recourse - Demand deposits\", \"Cash and cash equivalents with recourse - Term deposits\"; \"Other financial investments recorded at amortized cost\".\n\n(******) Effective liquidity corresponds to the algebraic sum of the following captions of the consolidated statement of financial position \"Cash and cash equivalents without recourse - Demand deposits\", \"Cash and cash equivalents with recourse - Demand deposits\", \"Cash and cash equivalents with recourse - Term deposits\"; \"Other financial investments recorded at amortized cost\" with the amount of available unused credit lines by the Group.\n\nInterim Consolidated Report 2020 14\n\nIn the first half of 2020, the financial results amounted to -42 million euros, an improvement of 10 million euros when compared with the first half of 2019, largely justified by the increase of the positive exchange differences generated in the period, due, essentially, to the appreciation of the euro against the kwanza.\n\nRegarding the net financial charges (interest expenses - interest income), these amounted to 47 million euros in the first half of 2020, a slightly higher amount than the one verified in the first half of 2019 (44 million euros).\n\n(*) Includes circa of 7 million euros associated with part of the effect arising from the consideration of Zimbabwe as a hyperinflationary economy (IAS 29)\n\nIn the first half of 2020, the caption \"Gains / (losses) in associates and jointly controlled companies\" (EM) contributed positively with 3.1 million euros to the net profit, a slightly higher amount than the one reached in the first half of 2019 (1.3 million euros), justified in part by the performance of SEM.\n\nRegarding income tax (Tax), in the first half of 2020 it amounted to 5 million euros (-15 million euros in the first half of 2019), due essentially to a much lower income before taxes and a positive effect not recorded in 2019 arising from some tax investment benefits granted to the GROUP.\n\nFinally, regarding non-controlling interests (NCI), those amounted in the first half of 2020 to 15 million euros, having them been generated, essentially, by the GROUP's subsidiaries in Mexico and Angola.\n\nThus, as a result of the operational and financial performance described above, significantly influenced by the impacts of the pandemic, the net profit (NP) attributable to the GROUP at June 30, 2020 amounted to -5.0 million euros (8.1 million euros in the first half of 2019).\n\nInterim Consolidated Report 2020 15\n\nBacklog (*) at June 30, 2020 reached 5.5 billion euros, a new record, with the regions of Africa and Latin America contributing with approximately 79% of the total amount, corresponding to a \"backlog - to - sales and services rendered in the E&C business\" ratio of 2.3x.\n\nOn the other hand, at June 30, 2020, the E&S business contributed with 760 million euros to the GROUP's backlog, even excluding the foreseeable revenues arising from the waste treatment and recovery contracts from EGF concessionary companies.\n\nLastly, it is worth to highlight, in a turbulent period, the backlog increase of approximately 126 million euros, when compared with December 31, 2019, to which, among others, the Mexican market contributed with the award, in partnership with China Communications Construction Company, of a contract for the construction of the first stretch of the new Mexican railway infrastructure called \"Trem Maya\" worthing more than 500 million euros.\n\n(*) Turnover to be executed in contracts awarded at the exchange rate of June 30, 2020.\n\nInterim Consolidated Report 2020 16\n\n1.3 Analysis by business area\n\nEUROPE\n\nThe Europe region manages the E&C and the E&S activities and companies that the GROUP has in Portugal, Poland, Ireland and in the United Kingdom, or which are managed by the management structure of this region. In the E&S area, waste collection activities (whose vehicle is SUMA) and waste treatment and recovery activities (whose vehicle is EGF) are developed.\n\nIn Europe, specifically in the E&C area, as a result of the pandemic, there were some interruptions in the projects arising from the measures enacted by the local authorities, as well as, the decisions taken by some of our customers, namely in some projects in progress in Portugal and in Ireland. Additionally, in Portugal, there were also some difficulties in the performance of some subcontractors which together with the implemented security measures allow to continue operating even at levels below normal. Finally, in this region, there were no significant constraints in the supply chain having been reduced the number of projects whose production was suspended for that reason.\n\nHowever, despite the negative effects caused by the pandemic, the turnover in Europe in the first half of 2020 amounted to 455 million euros, an increase of 12% when compared with the first half of 2019 (407 million euros), helped both by the E&C area and by the E&S area.\n\nIn this chapter, it is worth noting the 14% increase in the E&C area turnover, influenced, essentially, by the strong activity in Poland (62% growth when compared with the first half of 2019), as well as, by the increase in the E&S area turnover, justified, essentially, by the waste collection business.\n\nAdditionally, in the first half of 2020, Portugal contributed with almost 50% to the E&C area turnover (circa of 60% in the first half of 2019).\n\nIn terms of operating profitability, the EBITDA in Europe in the first half of 2020 amounted to 48 million euros, an increase of 16% when compared with the first half of 2019 (41 million euros), being that increase justified, essentially, by the positive performance of the E&C area (+2.4 million euros), namely in Portugal and in Poland, but essentially by the performance of the E&S area (+5.6 million euros), namely in the waste collection business.\n\nInterim Consolidated Report 2020 17\n\nAFRICA\n\nIn Africa, as a result of the pandemic, there were also negative impacts arising from the measures enacted by the local authorities, as well as, by the decisions taken by some customers which led to interruptions in the majority of projects the in progress in Angola and in Uganda, having also justified some interruptions in the works performed in the Mozambique. On the other hand, in the remaining markets of the region, there was a production decrease justified, essentially, by the logistical constraints that turn more difficult the movement of people, goods and equipment's.\n\nThus, in the first half of 2020, a 15% decrease in the turnover of Africa occurred, when compared with the first half of 2019, having that indicator amounted to 385 million euros. In this chapter, it should be noted that the main markets of the region were hit in a similar way (Angola - 19% decrease and Mozambique - 14% decrease).\n\nIn terms of operating profitability, the EBITDA in Africa in the first half of 2020 amounted to 69 million euros, a decrease of 24% when compared with the first half of 2019, with the EBITDA margin decreasing to 18% (20% in the first half of 2019) with a balanced contribution from the several markets in the region.\n\nInterim Consolidated Report 2020 18\n\nLATIN AMERICA\n\nIn Latin America, the GROUP'S region more affected by the pandemic, there were also negative impacts arising from the measures enacted by the local authorities, as well as, by the decisions taken by some of our customers, with a special impact in Peru and Mexico, which led to the interruption / suspension of some projects. In this region, the market that felt earlier the effects of this situation was precisely Peru, with the decree of the State of Emergency and the Partial Compulsory Recollection. On the other hand, given the increasing number of infected people in the main countries where the GROUP operates in this region, the came back to normal activity levels is still difficult to predict.\n\nThus, taking in consideration the above referred, the turnover of Latin America in the first half of 2020 amounted to 305 million euros, a decrease of 33%, when compared with the first half of 2019, being the markets of Mexico and Peru the ones that contributed more to that performance.\n\nAdditionally, in the first half of 2020, Mexico contributed with 43% to the region's turnover (46% in the first half of 2019).\n\nIn terms of operating profitability, the EBITDA in Latin America in the first half of 2020 decreased 55%, when compared with the first half of 2019, amounting to 27 million euros, having been impacted, essentially, by the less good performance of the Mexican market.\n\nInterim Consolidated Report 2020 19\n\n1.4 Impacts and measures adopted by the Group in response to the pandemic\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, and more specifically from the second week of March 2020, the GROUP is monitoring the evolution of this theme, in a first phase on a daily basis and currently with a lower frequency, fulfilling and disseminating the recommendations of the World Health Organization and the local authorities and acting in order to minimize the effects of that virus on its employees, on the communities where it operates and in its equity.\n\nSpecifically, in order to provide a coordinated and organized response to this crisis, the GROUP created a permanent monitoring committee (\"Covid Committee\") based on a support network with several capacities, which include the market managers and a dedicated central team. That network is centrally coordinated by the Executive Committee, which in a first phase met at least two times per week, and which have been briefed during that period about the impact of that crisis: (1) on people, (2) on current activity (on the economic and financial sides), (3) in the business plan for 2020 and (4) in the medium- term strategy.\n\nAs far the impact on people, the first decisions taken even anticipated the restrictions enacted by the several local authorities and were materialized in the definition of contingency plans to be applied in all places where the GROUP operates, whether in the different central offices or whether in shipyards, work fronts, industrial units, etc. In general, the GROUP implemented the teleworking for all functions where it proved to be feasible and in the operations it implemented reinforced safety and health policies, reinforcing individual protection means and monitoring the compliance of those policies by all people, whether they were employees of GROUP companies, subcontractors, suppliers, customers, inspectors, etc.. Additionally, in relation to the expatriates, the GROUP ensured a reinforcement of its security by hiring a \"global rescue\" company with support capacity both in terms of access to local healthcare's, as well as, providing return trips to its respective countries.\n\nAs far the impact in the current activity, there was a decrease in the turnover in 2020, when compared with the same period of 2019, and it is likely that new impacts may arise, namely due to the replanning of production in some markets while the outbreak and spread of the virus is not neutralized. Specifically in the E&C activity, there were some negative impacts arising from the restrictive measures of public health enacted by the local authorities, from the decisions taken by some of our customers to suspend / interrupt the ongoing projects, from having found some difficulties in the performance of some subcontractors, and from having found some logistical constraints that turn more difficult the movement of goods, equipment's and people. In the remaining activities, whether in the collection, recovery and treatment of waste, whether in the production and sale of energy, the activity has maintained a relatively normal level. In addition, despite the production levels verified and the stability in the collection and treatment of domestic waste, it was noticed a reduction in the industrial waste as a result of the strong slowdown verified in the economic activity.\n\nFollowing the above mentioned, it is worth to highlight that in most of the projects, even in those in which there was an interruption by indication of the local authorities or from our customers, has been a constant dialogue with the latter ones in order to safeguard the financial balance of the contracts.\n\nOn the other hand, in order to ensure the liquidity management of the business, the GROUP, namely in Portugal, adhere to the moratorium regime established by the Portuguese State / financial system, which allowed it to postpone circa of 340 million euros of reimbursements of capital and interest. At the same time, the GROUP negotiated and has been negotiating additional liquidity lines with the Portuguese banks (COVID lines - in the amount of circa of 23 million euros) and with local banks in the main countries where it operates in Africa and in Latin America. Likewise, and taking in consideration the goal above referred, the GROUP accelerated a set of efficiency measures that were already underway and postponed some investments planned for 2020.\n\nThus, at June 30, 2020, the repayment of the gross debt with a maturity lower than 1 year, in the amount of 636 million euros, is fully assured through the available cash, through the available but unused credit lines, and / or through the operations refinanced or in progress of being refinanced after June 30, 2020 (314 million euros).\n\nRegarding the accomplishment of the business plan for 2020, the GROUP has been periodically monitoring its evolution, as well as, taking some mitigating actions in order to minimize the deviations observed in the meantime. However, due to the fact that the uncertainties underlying the pandemic continue to persist, namely the duration of the public health restriction measures implemented, the duration of the restrictions in the movement of people, equipment's and goods, the possibility of a second wave and the possibility of discovering a new vaccine, any estimate performed has a limited degree of reliability.\n\nInterim Consolidated Report 2020 20\n\nFinally, regarding the medium-term strategy, the GROUP proceeded to a reflection over the \"new normal\" through a methodology based on 5 steps: (1) assessment and understanding of the situation in all its aspects and in all businesses / companies; (2) strengthening the resilience, ensuring the protection of its assets; (3) case by case planning of the necessary recovery; (4) simulation of new scenarios for the future; and (5) adapting the organization to the new regulatory and competitive environment (the \"new normal\"). Following that reflection, new action plans have already been developed with an expected positive impact on the GROUP's future performance. In this regard, in the first half of 2020, it is also important to highlight the commercial resilience shown by the GROUP which, in a troubled period, even so, managed to strengthen its backlog, which allows it to face the future with a moderate optimism.\n\n1.5 Sustainability and social responsibility\n\nSustainability and social responsibility are fundamental vectors of the MOTA-ENGIL GROUP's conduct and its commitment to all countries where it operates.\n\nTherefore, and reinforced in this pandemic period, the MOTA-ENGIL GROUP supports its decisions in a matrix that includes the environmental and social perspective alongside the economical one. The visibility of the maxim \"A more sustainable GROUP, in a more sustainable world\" is evident in the selection of recent actions that the GROUP has developed, and which are listed below:\n\nDonation of high-tech medical equipment to hospital establishments and support centres for COVID-19;\n\nCreation of the AJUDA @ ME platform by the Fundação Manuel António da Mota (\"FMAM\");\n\nLaunch of the 11th edition of the Manuel António da Mota Prize under the theme \"Portugal Vence a Covid-19\";\n\nCampaigns to promote the health and safety of MOTA-ENGIL employees;\n\nAttribution by FMAM of support under the \"Mobilidade Integrada\" program - donation of equipment's and interventions in the housing sphere for people with reduced mobility;\n\nMaintenance by FMAM of support programs for MOTA-ENGIL employees (Scholarships, \"Primeira infância\" Program, Financial Office, Social Support Fund, Fund 1 + 2);\n\nProceed with the \"Cantinho do Estudo\" project with the Municipality of Vila Nova de Gaia (POCH, Partnership for Impact, Portugal Social Innovation);\n\nSupport provided by FMAM in the reconstruction / rehabilitation of degraded houses of families in situations of social and economic vulnerability;\n\nDevelopment of environmental awareness campaigns and actions with local communities and schools;\n\nRealization of the 8th edition of the \"Jovens Empreendedores\" project;\n\nDonation of books, schoolbooks and sports equipment to a school in Malawi and creation of a permanent relationship with this educational institution;\n\nWithin the scope of the construction of the Cabinda General Hospital, and with the support and guidance of FMAM, MOTA-ENGIL ANGOLA has been carrying out several activities of social nature with the surrounding communities, of which it is worth to highlight, the delivery of school kits and toys to schools and orphanages, the rehabilitation of classrooms at the Simindele primary school and the creation of a library, the rehabilitation of the Chibodo police station, the cleaning / rehabilitation of the local community's playground and the valorisation of the construction waste generated; and\n\nAs part of the construction of the Pediatric Hematological Institute, and with the support and guidance of FMAM, MOTA-ENGIL ANGOLA has also been carrying out several activities of social nature with the surrounding communities, of which it is worth to highlight, the rehabilitation of the buildings of the leper community stands of Funda - Luanda, the rehabilitation of the neonatology area and the waterproofing of the roof of the Pediatric Hospital David Bernardino, as well as, the supply and installation of air conditioning units for the Ministry of Health headquarters building.\n\nFurthermore, it should be highlighted the historical milestone reached by the GROUP of 1,000 days and 4,500,000 hours worked without accidents in the mining project located in Moatize, Mozambique, which reinforces that safety work is a reality, the MOTA-ENGIL reality.\n\nInterim Consolidated Report 2020 21\n\n1.6 Future prospects\n\nThe prospects of MOTA-ENGIL GROUP for the year 2020, strongly conditioned by the uncertainty regarding the evolution of the pandemic, are as follows:\n\nTotal turnover is expected to decrease due to Africa and Latin America, notwithstanding an expected increase in activity in Europe;\n\nEBITDA margin to remain below 2019;\n\nBacklog to stand above 5,000 million euros;\n\nCapex below 200 million euros (partially financed by down payments), down from an initial estimate of 200 - 250 million euros; and\n\nFocus on organic cash-flow generation in order to help strengthening the capital structure.\n\n1.7 Subsequent events\n\nStrategic partnership and investment agreement\n\nMOTA-ENGIL S.G.P.S., S.A. informs that it is in the last stages of negotiation of a partnership and investment agreement (the \"Agreement\") with one of the largest infrastructures groups in the world (top five), with significant activity worldwide, aiming at such group (the \"New Partner\") becoming a relevant shareholder and a long-term partner of the GROUP MOTA-ENGIL.\n\nIn the context of the envisaged Agreement, MOTA GESTÃO E PARTICIPAÇÕES, SGPS, SA (MGP), the controlling shareholder of MOTA- ENGIL, has accepted to sell a relevant stake in the share capital of MOTA-ENGIL at a price that reflects a valuation which is high above the current market price.\n\nAlso pursuant to the Agreement, if concluded successfully - which is expected to occur shortly -, and assuming that the regulatory clearances and several other conditions precedent will be met, the New Partner:\n\nwill enter into a partnership and investment understanding with GROUP MOTA-ENGIL to jointly develop commercial opportunities and\n\nwill be committed to subscribe a relevant stake in a share capital increase of up to 100 million new shares that will be submitted for deliberation in a General Meeting, to be called shortly.\n\nFollowing such share capital increase:\n\na stake of around 40% of the share capital will be attributable to MGP, showing a fully commitment and alignment with its historical position in MOTA-ENGIL,\n\nthe New Partner will reach a stake slightly above 30%.\n\nThis new configuration and the framework of this partnership, which is based on a Group´s valuation of circa 750 million euros, will enhance the financial, technical and commercial capabilities of GROUP MOTA-ENGIL in order to upscale its activities in all markets and will open new opportunities for further developments.\n\nMOTA-ENGIL, as the leading Portuguese infrastructure multinational group, will strengthen its commitment, based on its 75- year culture and corporate values, towards its clients, employees, communities, environment and all other stakeholders.\n\nInterim Consolidated Report 2020 22\n\n1.8 Mota-Engil in Stock Market\n\nThe evolution of the performance of the MOTA-ENGIL share price in the first half of 2020 is shown in the following charts:\n\nAs at June 30, 2020 MOTA-ENGIL's share capital was comprised by of 237,505,141 shares, with a nominal value of one euro each, with all shares being listed on Euronext Lisbon. On that same date, MOTA-ENGIL held 6,091,581 own shares, corresponding to 2.565% of its share capital.\n\nMOTA-ENGIL's share closed the first half of 2020 at a price of 1.142 euros corresponding to a market capitalization of circa of 271 million euros. The first half of the year was characterized by an increase of volatility in the financial markets, as well as, by an increase in the uncertainty and risk aversion by the investors following the Covid-19 pandemic that had its major impact between the months of March and May. This context led to a significant sell-off in the stock market, to which the performance of MOTA-ENGIL's share was not immune, having depreciated 39% during the first half of 2020. Also, the Portuguese stock index, PSI20, presented a negative performance in the first half, having depreciated 16%. Regarding the European sectorial index, SXOP, it closed the semester with a 14% devaluation.\n\nDuring the first half of 2020, MOTA-ENGIL's share reached a maximum of 1.900 euros, recorded in early January, and a minimum of 1.012 euros, which was recorded in mid-May. In that period, a total of 156 million MOTA-ENGIL shares were traded in Euronext Lisbon corresponding to an average daily volume of 1,237 thousand shares.\n\nThe MOTA-ENGIL Annual Shareholders' Meeting of 2020 took place on June 18, having been approved all the points considered therein.\n\nPorto, 25 August 2020\n\nGonçalo Moura Martins\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nJosé Pedro Freitas\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nInterim Consolidated Report 2020 23\n\nFrom civil construction to energy, concessions and environment, Mota-Engil Group invested in new business sectors.

Others matters - Covid-19\n\nFollowing the appearance and spread of the Covid - 19 pandemic, which has plagued the planet since the beginning of the year of 2020, we detailed below some of its impacts in the GROUP's financial report as at June 30, 2020:\n\nIn terms of activity and profitability\n\nAs shown in the attached consolidated financial statements, the GROUP's activity, namely in the ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION business, suffered a decrease of circa of 14% as a result of the several constraints caused by the pandemic, being worth to highlight the interruptions / stopages of production occurred in several projects on which the GROUP was performing due to the restrictive measures of public health implemented in the different countries where it operates, as well as, the logistical constraints faced in moving people, goods and equipments. That decreased was felt mainly in the Africa and Latin America regions. Furthermore, in the last one, it still exits few visibility about the moment of normalization of the activity.\n\nRegarding the ENVIRONMENT AND SERVICES the production and sale of energy, the essential and strategic services for the normality.\n\nbusiness, which comprise the collection, treatment and recovery of waste, as well as, impact caused by the pandemic was still slight since as those activities correspond to normal functioning of the communities the ones continue to be provided with some\n\nIn terms of profitability, as a result of the interruptions / stopages occurred in some of the projects performed by the GROUP, with the consequent negative impact in the productivity and in the dilution of fixed costs, the EBITDA also suffered a decrease of circa of 26% once again influenced by the less positive performance of the Africa and Latin America regions. Regarding this matter, it should be highlighted that, when those projects resume their normal activity, the GROUP expects that the profitability levels achieved in the past can be reached. On the other hand, and under the established contracts, several contacts were immediately initiated with the customers in order to recover part of the abnormal costs incurred, as well as, to reschedule the completion deadlines of the projects in order to mitigate the risk of occurrence of future non-compliances.\n\nIn terms of financing\n\nRegarding this matter, despite the lower profitability of the operations, the GROUP'S financing needs have not significantly worsened, have it managed to finance its activity through the credit facilities available in Portugal or in the other countries in which it operates. In this regard, we highlight the Covid lines obtained in Portugal and the adherence to the moratorium process established by the Portuguese State / financial system that allowed the GROUP to postpone circa of 340 million euros of capital and interest reimbursements to the financial institutions with which it maintained outstanding financial responsibilities in Portugal. On the other hand, as a result of the massive injections of liquidity performed by the central banks and the measures adopt by several countries to support the economy, there has not been until this date a significant increase in the GROUP's financing costs. Finally, as of this date, no significant increase in the average period of customers collections arise that has affected the GROUP's financing needs.\n\nIn terms of investment\n\nIn this chapter, as a result of the constraints arising from the pandemic, namely the postponement / interruption of some relevant projects, the GROUP postponed part of the planned investment in order to avoid a higher burden in its treasury. Therefore, the investment performed in the semester was mainly channeled to the waste treatment and collection business in Portugal and in the Ivory Coast, where the GROUP assumed investment commitments in the past, and for some Engineering and Construction projects where the procurement and acquisition processes were already underway (namely for a medium and long-term mining project in Guinea-Conakry).\n\nInterim Consolidated Financial Statements 2020\n\n45\n\nIn terms of liquidity\n\nAs shown below, and partly as a result of the moratoriums agreed with the financial institutions operating in Portugal, the GROUP'S liquidity gap at 1 year as at June 30, 2020, amounted to 11 million Euros. In addition, in accordance with the liquidity management policy defined by the GROUP and in order to maintain an adequate liquidity reserve, as at June 30, 2020, it had available and unused credit lines of circa of 196 million euros. On the other hand, after June 30, 2020, the GROUP has already refinanced or is in the process of refinancing circa of 314 million euros of bank debt. Finally, and in the event of an extreme worsening of the economic and financial conditions, the GROUP also has the possibility to dispose of some of its non-current assets, namely part of the sovereign bonds it keeps recorded in its statement of financial position and which totalled circa of 185 million Euros. Consequently, it is the GROUP belief, even in a scenario of huge uncertainty regarding the future, that within a 12 months period it has the appropriate financial resources to fulfill all of its responsibilities when they become due.\n\nAs at June 30, 2020, the GROUP´s liquidity position (capital component) can be analysed as follows:\n\nFinancial assets recorded at amortised cost\n\nCash and cash equivalents - demand and term deposits\n\nCustomers and other debtors\n\nOther financial investments recorded at amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets recorded at fair value\n\nDerivative financial instruments\n\nOther financial investments recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nTotal financial assets under the scope of IFRS-9\n\nOther non financial assets\n\nInventories\n\nContract assets\n\nOther current and non current assets\n\nCorporate income tax\n\nNon-current assets held for sale\n\nTotal non financial assets\n\nTotal assets\n\nFinancial liabilities recorded at amortised cost\n\nLoans with or without recourse\n\nOther financial liabilities\n\nSuppliers and sundry creditors\n\nFinancial liabilities recorded at fair value\n\nDerivative financial instruments\n\nTotal financial liabilities under the scope of IFRS-9\n\nFinancial liabilities out of the scope of IFRS - 9\n\nLease liabilities\n\nTotal financial liabilities\n\nOther non financial liabilities\n\nLiabilities associated with customers contracts\n\nOther current and non current liabilities\n\nCorporate income tax\n\nNon-current liabilities held for sale\n\nTotal non financial liabilities\n\nTotal liabilities\n\nLiquidity GAP\n\nIn terms of main estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the attached consolidated financial statements\n\nAs a result of the uncertainty and the negative impacts triggered up to date by the pandemic, the GROUP proceeded in the preparation of the attached consolidated financial statements to a review of the main estimates and assumptions used with a special focus on performing sensitivity analyzes to the main impairments tests performed at December 31, 2019 to goodwill, tangible assets, intangible assets, deferred tax assets and accounts receivable (in the component of expected losses and time value of money). As a result of the analysis carried out, and taking in consideration several scenarios, all of them more pessimistic than the ones used at December 31, 2019 (with WACC´s worsening up to 1% and with significant reductions in EBITDA and cash flows estimated for 2020 and 2021), they were recorded, in a prudent way, in the first half of 2020 impairment losses and provisions of circa of 16 million Euros.\n\nInterim Consolidated Financial Statements 2020\n\n46\n\nIn terms of going concern\n\nAlthough a high level of uncertainty remains regarding the normalization of the world economy and the GROUP activity, particularly in some countries in Africa and in the majority of the countries in Latin America, due (1) to the high backlog that the GROUP has to perform, which inclusive increased in the first half of the year, (2) due to the liquidity position it presents for the next 12 months, (3) due to the absence of material losses in the first half of the year and expected in the coming months and (4) due to the internal management measures that have already been adopted (implementation of efficiency programs, postponement of investments, closure of less profitable or small markets, renegotiation of contracts with customers, etc.) it is the GROUP belief that it has the adequate resources to maintain its activities, making no intention to cease them in the short term and so its Board of Directors considers that it is appropriate to use the going concern assumption in the preparation of the attached consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn terms of subsequent events\n\nExcept for the matter referred in the paragraph below, between June 30, 2020 and the approval date for issuance of the attached consolidated financial statements, no relevant events or additional uncertainties regarding the evolution of the pandemic, as well as, over the future activity of the GROUP occur which produced or which could produce material impacts in the attached consolidated financial statements.\n\nStrategic partnership and investment agreement\n\nAlthough with no material impact in the attached consolidated financial statements, it is worth to highlight, as described in more detailed in the management report, that it is in the last stages of negotiation a strategic partnership and investment agreement with one of the largest infrastructures groups in the world.\n\n16.
