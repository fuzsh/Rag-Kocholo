        "text": "Alternative investment funds (AIFs) are yet to receive clarification regarding the valuation requirement that addresses operational difficulties, gaps in audit deadlines, and benchmarking issues. In this regard, Siddarth Pai, Founding Partner, 3one4 Capital, and Co-Chair, Regulatory Affairs Committee, Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association (IVCA), said, \"Audited financials of the portfolio companies is a blocker as the Income Tax Act requires companies to complete the audit by June 15. There is a mismatch between Sebi regulation and Income Tax norms. We can’t have two audit reports for the same period.\" He added, \"We are seeking clarity on whether audited financials are mandatory or if there can be an alternative way to achieve the same. It becomes tough to get portfolio companies to complete their audit within the Sebi-specified timeline, especially for early-stage startups.\" For more details, read: https://lnkd.in/dvv7tpRr #AIFs #valuationnorms #auditdeadlines\n\nSingapore Temasek reports $289 billion AUM and $ 311 billion AUM if including Mark-to-Market (MTM) of unlisted portfolio (31/3/24).
