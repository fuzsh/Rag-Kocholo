        "text": "At present, competitive globalized environments force enterprises to make more effort to both set up collaborative processes among networked partners and open their borders to the internationalization process. With this participation in internationalization processes, a set of barriers emerges that enterprises must overcome, particularly SMEs. The internationalization barriers are classified in four main dimensions, namely, strategy, technology, partners and product, which are considered to establish relationships between the internationalization and the collaborative processes. Accordingly, the research objective is to analyse the extent to which collaboration with international partners facilitates the internationalization process. A research survey was held with Spanish manufacturing SMEs to assess the internationalization of operations by establishing collaborative processes in global networks. Two surveys were conducted to analyse collaboration and internationalization concepts...\n\nThe innovation process should be treated as ? multidiscipline and multidimensional process in which ? great number of people participate. With direct or indirect connections and through different communication channels, organization is able to approach wide spectrum of other organization resources, and this enables creation of larger number of projects with lower investments and risks. For an organization, entering the alliances is no longer the matter of finding new resources, but it becomes the main cause of strategic innovation and preparation for unpredictable future challenges and development. Cooperation among enterprises brings certain risks, among which are most often information drain, loss of the control and independence, conflicts because of different aims and interests, increased complexity, and all these factors can produce negative influence on innovation creation and on innovative potential of the participant. Although an alliance should reduce expenses, risk and time...\n\nThis paper aims to address the effects of company horizontal interactions on the internationalization process, particularly on new market entries. Internationalization is frequently referred as one of the benefits of cooperative horizontal relationships, namely of competitors strategic alliances. Research often neglects how intercompetitor interaction takes place and how it affects a new market entry. Taking the IMP approach, this study focuses mainly three interaction processes: informational and social exchange, adaptation and"
