        "text": "2 September 2020 – Two consortia headed by Mota-Engil and Sacyr were selected to participate in the next phase of negotiations in the tender for the construction of the Hospital Lisboa Oriental. The two losing consortia – Acciona and Teixeira Duarte – have until September 23 to contest the decision. The Sacyr consortium, of which Aberdeen Infrastructure is also a part, submitted the lowest price. In contrast, the Mota-Engil consortium, which is part of InfraRed Capital Partners, ranked highest in technical quality. According to the rules for the public tender, price weighs 40% and technical quality 60%.\n\nThe bid submitted by the Sacyr group was for approximately 293.8 million euros, while Mota-Engil offered almost €333. Market watchers expect the Lisbon and Tagus Valley Regional Health Administration to award the 30-year contract by the end of this year.\n\nThe contract includes three years for construction and 27 years for the operation and maintenance of the asset. The future hospital will have 875 beds, at least 25% more than the total for the six other units it will replace (S. José, Curry Cabral, Maternidade Alfredo da Costa, Estefânia, Santa Marta and Capuchos). The public entity also estimates savings of 70 million euros per year by centralising services in a single unit.\n\nOriginal Story: Jornal de Negócios – Maria João Babo\n\nTranslation/Summary: Richard D.
