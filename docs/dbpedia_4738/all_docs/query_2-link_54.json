It established its African operations in Angola in 1946. Mota-Engil Africa, which is a subsidiary of Mota-Engil\n\nSGPS, is currently building a 245km railway in Malawi that is part of the Nacala Corridor, a facility for transporting mining\n\nproducts from the Moatize coal mine in Mozambique that is operated by Brazilian mining group Vale.\n\nMine Plant and Associated Infrastructure EPC\n\nDuring the reporting period Sundance also completed the mine plant and associated infrastructure EPC tender process.\n\nInitial responses from the market were favourable and this resulted in the identification of a select group of international\n\ncompanies who have expressed interest in tendering. Importantly Sundance believes these parties have demonstrated the\n\nkey skills and expertise required to successfully undertake these works.\n\nCompetitive tenders were received from three bidders for the execution of a Front End Engineering Design (FEED) study\n\ntogether with indicative pricing for an EPC contract for the delivery of the mine plant and associated site infrastructure in\n\nApril 2014. The quality of the submissions was of a high standard and the Company anticipates that a contract for the\n\nexecution of the FEED study will be awarded in late 2014 leading to the award of an EPC contract in 2015.\n\nFinancial Advisor and Lead Debt Arranger\n\nIn June 2014, Sundance announced the appointment of Standard Bank, Africaâ€™s largest bank by assets and earnings, to be\n\nthe Companyâ€™s exclusive debt financial advisor and non-exclusive lead debt arranger with respect to project-level funding.\n\nStandard Bank indicated they plan to use their balance sheet to support the debt raising that will be required for the\n\nProject. Standard Bankâ€™s proposed tiered funding plan for debt financing includes involvement from export credit agencies,\n\ndevelopment finance institutions and commercial banks.\n\nDiscussions with a wide variety of potential funding partners have been undertaken with several expressions of interest\n\nbeing received. In addition, expressions of interest have also been received from insurance agencies who will provide\n\nprotection for the commercial banking tranche. The result of these discussions is that Sundance is confident there is\n\nconsiderable support for the Mbalam-Nabeba Iron Ore Project from the above-mentioned institutions, including Western\n\nand Chinese providers of project equity and debt capital.\n\nThe following sources of project equity funding are being considered:\n\nâ€¢ Partial mine equity sale;\n\nâ€¢ Partial port and/or rail equity sale;\n\nâ€¢ Total infrastructure sale; and\n\nâ€¢ Strategic investment.\n\nOff-take\n\nOn 25 March 2014, Sundance subsidiaries Cam Iron and Congo Iron signed a binding long-term off-take contract with\n\nleading global commodities trader Noble Resources International (â€˜Nobleâ€™). The contract stipulates that Noble must buy all\n\nproduct produced by Mbalam Nabeba for the first 10 years of operation, minus any product that may be allocated to project\n\nequity participants. Sales will be based on international standard pricing benchmark (Platts IODEX 62% Fe CFR China less\n\nfreight costs) Free on Board (FOB) Lolabe Cameroon. In the event that Cam Iron and Congo Iron need to sell a portion of their\n\nproduction to a third party in order to attract an equity investor into the Project, the off-take agreement includes a claw-back\n\nclause which will enable project equity participants to buy up to 50 per cent of the production. There are no costs to Cam Iron\n\nor Congo Iron for this claw back.\n\nThe term of the off take agreement is for the first 10 years of production and although the Company aims to produce 35\n\nmillion tonnes per annum, there is no liability for either Cam Iron or Congo Iron if that level of production is not achieved.\n\nThe basis for how ships are nominated, received into port, loaded and dispatched is in accordance with industry practice.\n\nSundance expects this contract will help facilitate completion of debt funding for the construction of the port, rail and mines.\n\n5.
