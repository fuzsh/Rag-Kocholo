RECOMMENDATION: A Combined Rank of 6, is a sell recommendation based on Mota-Engil's financial characteristics. As the company Mota-Engil's key financial metrics exhibit good value (Obermatt Value Rank of 54) but low growth (Obermatt Growth Rank of 16) and risky financing practices (Obermatt Safety Rank of 4), it may be a risky investment, because debt in times of crises can make things worse. The good value, better than 54% of comparable companies, may indicate the company's future is challenging. If you believe that low growth is temporary or just due to a specific current event, you may conclude that the good value of the stock provides an attractive investment opportunity.

Value Metrics in Detail

ANALYSIS: With an Obermatt Value Rank of 54 (better than 54% compared with alternatives), Mota-Engil shares are more attractively priced than the majority of comparable stocks. The Value Rank is based on consolidating four value indicators, with three out of four indicators above average for Mota-Engil. Price-to-Sales (P/S) is 73, which means that the stock price compared with what market professionals expect for future sales is lower than for 73% of comparable companies, indicating a good value concerning Mota-Engil's revenue size. The same is valid for expected Price-to-Profits (or Price / Earnings, P/E), more favorable than for 53% of alternatives. It is also positive for expected dividend yields with a Dividend Yield rank of 73 (dividends are expected to be higher than 73% of other stocks). But, compared with other companies in the same industry, the Price-to-Book Capital ratio (also referred to as market-to-book ratio) is higher than average, making the stock more expensive. Only 82% of all competitors have an even higher price compared with book capital which puts the Price-to-Capital Rank for Mota-Engil to 18. ...read more

RECOMMENDATION: The overall picture with a consolidated Value Rank of 54, is a buy recommendation based on Mota-Engil's stock price compared with the company's operational size and dividend yields. A low level of book capital means that the company has a business that is leaner in assets than its competitors. For instance, the company could be leasing its production facilities or be more focussed on intellectual property, such as its brand and software, which is less visible in its book capital. If that is the case, the three good value ranks for Sales, Profits, and Dividends are reliable indicators for the stock price value. We recommend further analyzing the stock with Obermattâs Value, Safety, and Sentiment Ranks, including the 360Â° View, before making an investment decision. ...read more

Growth Metrics in Detail

ANALYSIS: With an Obermatt Growth Rank of 16 (better than 16% compared with alternatives), Mota-Engil shows one of the most restricted growth dynamics in its industry. There is little momentum in this company. The Growth Rank is based on consolidating four value indicators, with three out of four indicators below average for Mota-Engil. Sales Growth has a below market rank of 8, which means that, currently, professionals expect the company to grow less than 92% of its competitors.

RECOMMENDATION: The overall picture with a consolidated Growth Rank of 16, is a sell recommendation for growth and momentum investors. That picture may be the result for a company that has reached the bottom. All went south for Mota-Engil, and it still looks bad, but some investors already see light at the end of the tunnel, rewarding the stock with recent above-market stock returns. It could also mean that investors are correcting an overreaction to negative news. If that were the case, the positive stock returns are not yet a sign of recovery. Investors should look closely at the Value and Sentiment indicators before they make a stock purchasing decision, because growth is unlikely to be the driving argument behind this investment. While momentum is a popular investment factor, the value aspect might be the more important one, in the longer term. We recommend analyzing the stock with Obermattâs Value, Safety, and Sentiment Ranks to arrive at a 360Â° View of the stock purchase case, especially since the growth performance is low here. ...read more

Safety Metrics in Detail

ANALYSIS: With an Obermatt Safety Rank of 4 (better than 4% compared with alternatives), the company Mota-Engil has much riskier financing practices than comparable other companies, which means that their overall debt burden is significantly above the industry average. This doesn't mean that the business of Mota-Engil is also risky, it only means that the company is on the riskier side in respect to bankruptcy in case things turn sour, assuming that public reporting is correct. The Safety Rank is based on consolidating three financing indicators, with all three metrics below average for Mota-Engil. Liquidity is at 4, meaning that the company generates less profit to service its debt than 96% of its competitors. This indicates that the company is on the riskier side when it comes to debt service. Even worse, Leverage is at a rank of 7, meaning the company has an above-average debt-to-equity ratio. It has more debt than 93% of its competitors. Finally, Refinancing is at a rank of 24 which means that the portion of the debt about to be refinanced is above average. It has more debt in the refinancing stage than 76% of its competitors. ...read more

RECOMMENDATION: With a consolidated Safety Rank of 4 (worse than 96% compared with alternatives), Mota-Engil has a financing structure that is significantly riskier than that of its competitors. This combination is rather dangerous in most situations. Only very promising companies with bright future outlooks and stellar reputations can operate with such risky financing. Investors should look at Obermattâs Value, Growth, and Sentiment Ranks to confirm a very positive outlook or be careful with investing in stocks of Mota-Engil because it may suffer significantly in case of future difficulties. ...read more
