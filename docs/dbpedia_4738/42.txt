27 August 2020 – The Portuguese construction company Mota-Engil announced that it is in the final stage of negotiations to create a strategic partnership and investment agreement with “one of the largest infrastructure groups in the world (top 5), with significant operations worldwide.” The reputed new shareholder, CCCC – China Communication Construction Corporation, has had a strategic partnership with Mota Engil since 2019. The Chinese construction giant will acquire a 30% stake in an operation “well above the current market price.”

Mota Gestão e Participações (MGP), Mota-Engil’s parent company, agreed to sell a 30% equity stake in the company, according to a note sent to Portugal’s Securities Market Commission (CMVM). The agreement, which is expected to be completed shortly, will involve a 100-million share capital increase, leaving MGP with a 40% stake.
