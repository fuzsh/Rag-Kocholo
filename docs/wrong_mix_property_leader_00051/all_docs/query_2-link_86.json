        "text": "Cecil John Rhodes was the sickly, poorly educated and otherwise unremarkable son of an English parson of meagre means. He knew from an early age that he was doomed to a short life and died at the age of 48. Relatively late in life, after supplementing his poor school education by attending Oxford University, like many contemporary Victorian English academics, politicians, men of the cloth, soldiers, scholars and capitalists, he became convinced that the expansion of the British Empire (including the recovery of the USA) was a global mission to be achieved, no matter the price.\n\nIn his own words: the English “are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race.” He even advocated forming a secret society to further that mission. His ultimate goal for the Empire was transforming the colonies into a federation of states under local rule. To that end, despite his view that my ancestors, the Irish, were a “low class” race, he generously supported their cause for Home Rule because it fit in with his grand plan.\n\nHe came to South Africa in 1870 at the age of 17 in the hope that the climate might be kinder to his health. Initially he lived off a loan from his aunt. After a failed venture in Natal as a cotton farmer, he moved to Kimberley to become involved in the diamond mining boom.\n\nOver the next 30 years: he amassed one of the world’s great fortunes, engineered (with the support of the British government) the conquest of millions of square kilometres of the continent (creating two colonies the bore his name), precipitated a war to undermine the independence of the Afrikaners (leading to the creation of the Union of South Africa), and laid the political/legal foundations of what culminated in the Apartheid regime. His ambition for an Africa be believed was “devoted to barbarism” was simple and avaricious: “it is our duty to take it”.\n\nIn his endeavours, he was steadfastly assisted first by his beloved private secretary (and sole beneficiary in one of his early wills) Neville Pickering (who died in his arms), and then by his lifelong friend Dr (Sir) Leander Starr Jameson, lionized in Rudyard Kipling’s famous poem \"If—\". Jameson nursed Rhodes during his final illness and acted as one of his executors.\n\nBy nature and/or design Rhodes was a megalomaniac, imperialist, voracious capitalist/monopolist, unscrupulous businessman/politician/newspaper publisher, misogynist (homosexual?), white supremacist. Despite having an interest in their languages and cultures, he described black Africans as “despicable specimens of human beings”, who were nothing more than “extra employment”. In his own words: “I prefer land to niggers.”"
