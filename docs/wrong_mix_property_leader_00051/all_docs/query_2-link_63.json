        "text": "It should come as no surprise that the people in the homeland of William Shakespeare and Winston Churchill have a way with words. England, after all, is the birthplace of the English language, and no one uses it better. In particular, the British make great use of idioms, or sayings, that convey more than the surface meaning of their words.\n\nAs playwright George Bernard Shaw famously put it, \"The United States and Great Britain are two countries separated by a common language,\" so you can be forgiven for not always following what a Brit means. Letâ€™s get up to speed with 15 British sayings and idioms to know, including their meanings and origin, and you won't be confused again."
