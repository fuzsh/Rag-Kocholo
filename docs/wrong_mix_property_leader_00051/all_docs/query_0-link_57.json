        "text": "\"In the 1880s, the Cape Colony African male enjoyed a qualified franchise, dating back to 1853 [see the CAPE CONSTITUTION of 1853]. In the Transvaal and the Orange Free State colonies, Africans had no vote, and in natal nearly all Africans were effectively excluded from the franchise. [Cecil] Rhodes was unhappy that in many Cape Constituencies, Africans could be decisive if more of them exercised this right to vote under the law as it existed. In a speech in Parliament in June 1887, in which the franchise question was debated, Rhodes made clear his view: 'The native is to be treated as a child and denied the franchise. We must adopt a system of despotism, such as works in India, in our relations with the barbarism of South Africa' \" (Magubane 1996: 108). Thus, the CAPE FRANCHISE & BALLOT ACT of 1892 eventually \"raised the franchise qualifications [from £25 to £75] to the disadvantage of Africans, Coloured and poor whites\" (Simons & Simons 1969: 50).\n\nIt was but the first of a series of laws passed during the subsequent years in order to settle the 'native question' with regard to franchise. See especially the SEPARATE REPRESENTATION OF VOTERS ACT of 1951."
