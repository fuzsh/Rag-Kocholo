        "text": "After years of discussion around Cecil Rhodes School's controversial name, the Winnipeg School Division has landed on a new name for the school.\n\nOn Wednesday, the WSD announced the board of trustees have approved the name for the school - Keewatin Prairie Community School.\n\nThe name change will take effect at the beginning of September, with new signage to go up at the school as well.\n\n\"We’re very pleased to have a name that was chosen based on careful consideration and acknowledgement of the Truth and Reconciliation process,” Betty Edel, Chair of the WSD Board of Trustees, said in a news release. “We took the time necessary to ensure that changing the name of Cecil Rhodes was a community decision, and that the appropriate stakeholders were consulted and included in the choice of the new name.”\n\nIt has been nearly two years since the division first tabled a motion in September 2020 to begin the consultation process on the renaming. The school's former namesake, Cecil Rhodes, was a prominent 19th-century British figure whose policies paved the way for apartheid in South Africa.\n\nThe new name - Keewatin Prairie Community School – identifies the school’s geographical location and honours the Cree and Ojibwe languages, the division said in a news release.\n\n\"Both Keewatin and Prairie were a popular recommendation among survey responses,\" the division said. \"Students at the school, who are proud to be residents of the prairies, also acknowledge that the word prairie represents growth and a connection to nature and Indigenous ways.\""
