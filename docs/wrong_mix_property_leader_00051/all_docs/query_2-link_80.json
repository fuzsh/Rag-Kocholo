        "text": "Msezane: That [anti-imperial] consciousness, it’s like a wave, you know. It ascends and then it descends again. And it ripples as well. So I think this was bound to happen across the world because it’s just time… Our spirits are tired… People are having spiritual awakenings which I also believe is a part [of what is happening]. As much as statues and the monuments are concrete or bronze or whatever, they are… they carry spirits within them. As the youthful, people who are living now, we carry the spirits of our ancestors as well. They are troubled by these statues that are still there, but it’s not just about the statues, it’s about what they stand for.\n\nAnd so naturally I believe that we were going to have an uprising against these, not just the statues, but basically what they stand for because it just has always been something that just has not been right. It hasn’t been. We can’t justify what colonialism has done to everyone, Black, white, all kinds of races. Everyone has been affected and it just takes I think a few people around the world who are more spiritually aware to be part of a movement of driving about change.\n\nI think when people think about such topics, they think about it from a very political sense as if there is no other way of being. But I think spirituality can also be quite political. Because this is spiritual warfare. They came into Africa and they took away our names. Hello! They know that we have naming ceremonies, doing things like that, there was an intention. Take away their names, take away their culture, take away everything and they will not know who they are. That’s spiritual warfare.\n\nHunter-Young: Yes, spiritual warfare. I think that’s a really useful framing. [The language used in the awakening here with regard to how Canada has treated the Indigenous people of these lands] has been “cultural genocide,” but I think spiritual warfare captures something that is more active, something that hasn’t stopped. Genocide [has a sense of finality—which is also why people speak of ongoing genocide]. But spiritual warfare does a lot more to capture the ongoing. I mean, as I’m reading—and Rhodes died more than a hundred years ago which still actually isn’t that long ago—the permanence Rhodes has as a cultural figure [still today] far outweighs [what one might expect considering the sociopolitical strides Southern African state officials profess to have achieved]. He’s too monumentalized for the atrocities that we know have been done in his name, by him, continue to follow from him. So I really like that framing of “spiritual warfare.”\n\nMsezane: Whether we like it or not our spirits are working overtime. Our minds are working overtime. You get home and you’re tired and you want to take off the armour and you’re not sure why you’re so tired because you did something that you do every day. You went to work, you went through the city maybe to get home and that’s it. You didn’t do any more but you are so tired, why? Because all of the things that are around us are communicating something to us and that takes a lot of our sensibility to block out.\n\nHunter-Young: What has your reaction been to the circulation of Chapungu-The Day Rhodes Fell? That photo in particular, has just kind of exploded around the world in circulation, it’s quite memorable.\n\nMsezane: I honestly did not expect it at all. I didn’t expect the kind of reception that it’s received over the years and even when it first happened, like I said, I didn’t know what I was doing because I hadn’t planned it. So to see how much media attention it had received really blew my mind. And I think it made me a little scared because it made me realize that there was a dimension to my work that I was not aware of yet.\n\nThere’s a virtual nature to my work—and not just to my work, but in essence to who I am as a person. I’ve always been a dreamer. I’ve always been a person who kind of processes my understanding of the world through the dreams that I have and this was the relationship that I had with my grandfather. I would dream something, tell him about it, and if he thought it had some sort of spiritual significance then he would go and consult a traditional healer. I guess I didn’t tell him about this one and then it turned out to be big. I guess I was a little concerned what all of this means because it was a part of myself that I think I was not awake to yet.\n\nThere was something in me that was brewing that I couldn’t quite explain and over time things have become a bit clearer. I know that there is power in the things that I dream now. I still process the world through dreaming. And I’ve got a deeper connection with my ancestors now and [I am learning] how respectful I can be in speaking up about some of these messages without revealing the sacred nature of them in my work. So I am in constant conversation with the spiritual world, with my ancestors and it can be hard sometimes to process that world because the one I live in is secular… It’s a battle of trying to find the balance between two worlds I am constantly trying to navigate and sometimes I’m not good at it, sometimes I am.\n\nHunter-Young: I was prepping for this, thinking about your Chapungu performance, or work, and then reading—thanks to the links on the TED Talk—about the great Zimbabwe birds being stolen. Even how it is described—“cut from its plinth.” That, when I read that and then thought again about “Chapungu-The Day Rhodes Fell,” you—Chapungu—have returned to cut Rhodes from this space. The echo is quite intense. What do you think about when you think about that work? Where does it live in your memory now?\n\nMsezane: I know it is something that I could never in a million years have thought up because it literally happened in a moment in time and I couldn’t have been ready for that moment no matter how much one can plan for it. And as much as I make other work, I do think about that work and I say: “Wow, I wonder if I can try and recreate a similar moment?” And no, it’s impossible. It came at that moment because the message needed to be heard in that moment. I was not in the space quite honestly to be making such deeply profound work at the time. I was a student myself, I had just begun my master’s.\n\nThe issues that the students were tabling were the issues that I was experiencing in real time and I quite honestly did not have the energy or the mental capacity to be participating in a movement. I went to a few meetings but it was never my intention to be a part of a movement. I literally did not have anywhere to stay of my own. I was staying at a friend’s place and even then how we became friends is just so coincidental. I didn’t know her that well for me to be staying, crashing on her couch but that really, it eroded my self-esteem because I like to think of myself as a self-sufficient person but in that moment, Cape Town was doing to me what it has done to many Black people. Cape Town was refusing a person like me to have a home within the city. I had such trouble, even though I could afford to find a place to stay, I was just being discriminated against I believe because of my race.\n\nSo my master’s comes, and I don’t have the energy to look up what I’m trying to do for my master’s [project], and I’m having dreams about this bird [but I didn’t know what they meant because] at that time I wasn’t awake yet. But because I kept on dreaming about her consistently, I brought her into being through making. I thought of making wings and imagining what she’d be like. Also, I think I started to piece things together when I realized that I’ve been speaking about these statues for two years prior to the protests happening.\n\nClearly I‘m not mad—there is something to this. I think that’s when I was slightly twitching in my sleep. I wasn’t awake yet but I was twitching in my sleep. And then the day came when the statue would be removed and I didn’t even know that that was the day. I got told in a meeting by my supervisors and I was very confused… in my head somewhere I [thought] “the wings are not done.” I didn’t know why I was freaking out about these wings that I’d not done. “The statue is coming down today, what does it have to do with the wings?”\n\nBut in that moment I think I started to wake up, a very rude awakening. I realized what I had been preparing for. That the spirit of this bird was making me get ready for this moment, that as the statue falls that it is going to be in place rising. And to this day, I still have chills about that moment.\n\nHunter-Young: I have chills listening to you.\n\nMsezane: I also wonder sometimes why the bird chose me to deliver this message, and in such a way. This is even before I really understood the connection between Rhodes (the figure) and Chapungu.\n\nHunter-Young: Wow.\n\nMsezane: I didn’t even know who Rhodes was at the time. Then I searched Google (‘Rhodes the figure and a bird’) and I found out there is some sort of connection. But I shelved it away. It didn’t have the meaning that it has now for me. And over time, I think I [have come to] feel a bit helpless about that moment because for people it’s about the #RhodesMustFall movement, but for me the story was really about this bird that has been held captive since the late 1800s.\n\nThere is a reason why she came in that movement to reveal herself to people and it’s because she’s still not in Zimbabwe which is her home. She needs to be returned and I feel helpless because I can only do so much. I’m an artist, I’m not an advocate, I’m not a lawyer, I’m not a policy maker, I’m not a minister, so my power is very limited.\n\nI’ve tried in having talks [on] various platforms, trying to re-initiate this conversation about repatriating the bird but I have no idea where the blockage is, what conversations are being had because there’s been conversations between governments in Zimbabwe and South Africa about returning the bird with various presidents. The late Robert Mugabe and Thabo Mbeki had the conversation, Julius Malema had the conversation, so I’m really not sure why it is.\n\nHunter-Young: Is there a lesson that Chapungu gave you beyond what you’ve shared? (I mean, you’ve already shared so much).\n\nMsezane: I guess her trusting her story with me showed me that I should trust myself more than I do. I tend to be in my mind a lot because, a lot is happening in the world but the added dimension of the spiritual realm is also something that I have to now grapple with. And I’m not as trusting of myself, my thought processes, my abilities but it’s weird because it’s also in my name. My name means “trust” and “hope” at the same time, depending on how you use it. And having such a sentient being trust itself with its legacy, with its history, a history that’s not even connected to my cultural purposes as a Zulu person—[or] maybe [it is since] borders are really just non-existent… Yah, I think I was very humbled by that.\n\nThe lesson really is that I do need to trust myself more and more. She’s also taught me that there is value within our knowledge system and that’s why it needs to be kept alive. That’s why more work needs to be made, more books need to come out of our cultures, we need to excavate all of these cultures and knowledge systems that were buried because they were buried because we were never meant to exist. But we are proof that we are here to exist. And we need to do something about fully embracing these knowledge systems otherwise they will disappear as imperialism had intended. These are the lessons that she’s taught me [and] I’m just like “OK, it started with you. Thank you. Now we go forth.”\n\nHunter-Young: It is really something to hear your journey to that moment in time and then to track what that moment in time has then done, visually. The messaging that has multiplied infinitely from something that came to you in a dream. It’s quite remarkable.\n\nMsezane: I mean that’s a knowledge system in itself. The dream space has so much to offer. It’s a whole world, [it] communicates, it’s alive and we tend to cast it aside."
