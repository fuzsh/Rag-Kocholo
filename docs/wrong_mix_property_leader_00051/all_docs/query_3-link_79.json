        "text": "French investors and engineers with the help of the Egyptian government had built a canal that linked the Mediterranean Sea with the Indian Ocean by 1869.\n\nThe British government had always been annoyed that their colonial rivals, the French, could control access from Europe to India.\n\nIn 1875 the British government acquired all of the shares owned by the Egyptian government (led by the KhediveThe rulers of Egypt who was appointed by the Ottomon Sultan but came under European and especially British influence in the late 19th century.) in exchange for reducing debts owed by the Egyptian government to British banks.\n\nThe British acquisition of shares in the Suez CanalA man made canal dug in Egypt to connect the Mediterranean Sea with the Indian Ocean in the 19th century. played an important role in increasing European colonisation of Africa. This was because trade routes needed to be protected by large naval and military bases. As individuals explored the African interior and discovered valuable minerals and raw materials, the European colonial powers claimed large territories in order to keep the profits to themselves.\n\nMany British people went as missionaries to Africa during the 19th century.\n\nThey often connected the work of spreading Christianity with trying to bring an end to slave trading within Africa.\n\nMany missionaries sincerely wanted to improve the lives of African people as well as changing their religion.\n\nThe famous British explorer David Livingstone wanted to eradicate the slave trade in Africa and he believed the best way to do this was by promoting commerce, civilisation and, above all, Christianity.\n\nMary Slessor, inspired by the work of David Livingstone, trained as a missionary in Scotland and then in 1876 she went to Calabar in the south-eastern region of Nigeria and worked to change some of the harsher social practices in the region.\n\nMary adopted a number of children whom she found abandoned.\n\nShe then lived in the Okoyong district and became a highly respected member of the community, serving as a judge in local courts from 1892 until her death in 1915.\n\nCommerce with Africans was not as simple as preaching Christianity. In the same area where Mary Slessor was working as a missionary, in the south east of modern Nigeria, British merchants were developing very complex trading relationships with African producers of palm oil, which was used in a range of products.\n\nThe king of the city state of Opobo, King JaJa, became very important in the palm oil trade because JaJa and his African traders had direct access to businessmen in Britain. British traders were incensed by the special relationship he had with British businessmen and tried to undermine JaJa.\n\nEventually the British governor of the area of modern Nigeria, in which King JaJa traded, tricked JaJa into attending a meeting with him on board a British ship anchored off the coast, and then took him off on the boat to the Gold Coast colony.\n\nHe was then put on trial for a range of acts of treason and sentenced to transportation to the Caribbean for five years."
