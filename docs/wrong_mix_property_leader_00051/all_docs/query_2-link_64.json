The countries of Western Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are excluded.\n\nBoren Scholars represent a vital pool of highly motivated individuals who wish to work in the federal national security arena. In exchange for funding, Boren Scholars commit to working in the federal government for at least one year after graduation.\n\nlearn more\n\nFulbright Scholarship\n\nMore than 1,800 Americans receive grants to study, research or teach abroad with full or partial support from the Fulbright Program.\n\nThe Fulbright U.S. Student Program offers fellowships for U.S. graduating college seniors, graduate students, young professionals and artists to study, conduct research, and/or teach English abroad.

Marshall Scholars are talented, independent and wide-ranging, and their time as Scholars enhances their intellectual and personal growth. Their direct engagement with Britain through its best academic programmes contributes to their ultimate personal success.\n\nlearn more\n\nGeorge J. Mitchell Scholarship\n\nThe George J. Mitchell Scholarship Program is a national, competitive scholarship sponsored by the US-Ireland Alliance.\n\nThe Mitchell Scholarship Program, named to honor former US Senator George Mitchell's pivotal contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process, is designed to introduce and connect generations of future American leaders to the island of Ireland, while recognizing and fostering intellectual achievement, leadership, and a commitment to community and public service.\n\nUp to twelve Mitchell Scholars between the ages of 18 and 30 are chosen annually for one academic year of postgraduate study in any discipline offered by institutions of higher learning in Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nlearn more\n\nRhodes Scholarship\n\nThe Rhodes Scholarships are the oldest and most celebrated international fellowship awards in the world. Each year 32 young Americans are selected as Rhodes Scholars, through a decentralized process representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Applicants from more than 300 American colleges and universities have been selected as Rhodes Scholars. In most years, even after a century of competition, a Rhodes Scholar is selected from an institution which has not formerly supplied a successful applicant.\n\nRhodes Scholars are chosen not only for their outstanding scholarly achievements, but for their character, commitment to others and to the common good, and for their potential for leadership in whatever domains their careers may lead. The Rhodes Trust, a British charity established to honor the will and bequest of Cecil J. Rhodes, provides full financial support for Rhodes Scholars to pursue a degree or degrees at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom in partnership with the Second Century Founder, John McCall MacBain and other generous benefactors.\n\nlearn more\n\nSoros Scholarship\n\nPaul and Daisy Soros, Hungarian immigrants and American philanthropists, established their fellowship program for New Americans in December 1997 with a charitable trust of fifty million dollars. Their reasons for doing so were several. They wished to \"give back\" to the country that had afforded them and their children such great opportunities and felt a fellowship program was an appropriate vehicle. They also felt that assisting young New Americans at critical points in their educations was an unmet need. Finally, they wished to call attention of all Americans to the extensive and diverse contributions of New Americans to the quality of life in this country.\n\nThe program of fellowships they shaped has the following characteristics:\n\nIt honors and supports the graduate educations of 30 New Americans – permanent residents or naturalized citizens if born abroad; otherwise children of naturalized citizen parents -- each year.\n\nAt the time of their selection, fellows must be college seniors or early in the graduate programs for which they request support.\n\nEach fellow receives tuition and living expenses that can total as much as $90,000 over two academic years.\n\nFellows can study in any degree-granting program in any field at any university in the United States.\n\nFellows are selected on the basis of merit – the specific criteria emphasize creativity, originality, initiative and sustained accomplishment -- in annual national competitions. Candidates apply directly. The program does not depend on recommendations from universities or regional screening. Neither financial need nor distributive considerations are taken into account in the selection process.\n\nEach fellows attends two weekend conferences of fellows. The great majority continue to be involved with the program through regional dinners, service in the selection process for later classes, etc.\n\nlearn more Tuition and Fees Cost of Attendance\n\nHarry S. Truman Scholarship\n\nA better future relies on attracting to public service the commitment and sound judgment of bright, outstanding young leaders. This belief is what led President Truman, when approached by a bipartisan group of admirers near the end of his life, to encourage the creation of a living memorial devoted to this purpose rather than a bricks and mortar monument. For almost forty years, the Truman Scholarship Foundation has fulfilled that mission: supporting the potential of terrific young people from across the United States committed to public service, more than 2,900 so far.\n\nThe Truman is a very competitive national scholarship. Each year, the Foundation reviews over 600 applications for our 55 to 65 Scholarships awarded annually. These 600 applications do not include the students who compete on their own campus for one of a school's four nominations.\n\nlearn more"
