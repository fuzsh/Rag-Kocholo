        "text": "This is a petition to request the Board of Trustees of the Winnipeg School Division - Board and Trustees maintain the name of Cecil Rhodes School, located at 1570 Elgin Ave.\n\nAlthough there may be many reasons people feel there should be a change, the fact remains that we are unable to change history.\n\nMany distinguished individuals at home and abroad have contributed to the building of this great nation. Some of these were good and some were not. The fact is,by changing a name, you can not change history.\n\nIs it not better to educate our youth, and by so doing, prevent a reoccurrence of the past misfortunes, or should we hide the facts and let nature take its course, perhaps with dismal results. This can not be accomplished by \"sweeping\" the facts under the rug.\n\nAlthough Cecil Rhodes , according to History, created a number of issues, perhaps it is better to dwell on the positives. Some of our great statesmen were educated with the benefits of the Rhodes Scholarship, established to install a sense of civic minded leadership.\n\nSuch individuals include, Bill Clinton, John Turner, 3 Australian Prime Ministers, Bob Hawke, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nNotable scientists include Howard Florey and Ernst Chain who purified penicillin, Eric Lander whose research led to the creation of the Cancer Genome Atlas, Dr Jennifer Gruber, a space engineer at NASA.\n\nShould we be the ones to ignore the accomplishments of these individuals, or shall we continue to educate our children with the historical value of people such as Cecil Rhodes.\n\nWhat better tool to provide our children with direction and hope for the future.\n\nThis petition was started by a former student of Cecil Rhodes School and long time resident of the Weston Area.\n\nWe hope that similar minded people and supporters will join us in support of this important part of our community."
