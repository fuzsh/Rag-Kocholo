        "text": "American journalist\n\n\"Cecil Rhode\" redirects here. Not to be confused with Cecil Rhodes.\n\nCecil E. Rhode (July 7, 1902 – December 3, 1979) was an American wildlife photographer, film producer and journalist known for his work about wildlife in Alaska, particularly in National Geographic.[1] Active professionally from 1933 until his death, Rhode was best known for bringing wide exposure to the public about the wilds of Alaska. While Rhode's primary income was from film and photography, he also made a significant portion of his living from panning for gold and from selling crabs and other game.[2]\n\nRhode was the older brother of Leo Franklin Rhode (1908–2002), who came to Alaska with Cecil in 1933 and also settled on the Kenai Peninsula. Leo Rhode served as a business, civic and political leader in Homer for many decades."
