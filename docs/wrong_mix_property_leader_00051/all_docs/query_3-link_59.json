        "text": "Rhodesia, officially the Republic of Rhodesia (shona: Nyika yeRhodesia; northern ndebele: Illizwe le Rhodesia; tsonga: Riphabliki ra Rhodesia) and informally known as Zimbabwe, is a country located in Southeast Africa. It is situated between the Zambezi, Victoria Falls and Limpopo rivers. It is bordered by the Zambia to the north, Botswana to the southeast, South Africa to the south and the Mozambique to the east. The capital and largest city is Salisbury. The second largest city is Bulawayo. As of 2022 it's population numbers at 20,332,986 people, making it the 23rd most populous country in Africa. Rhodesia's official languages are 16: Chichewa, Chibarwe, Kalanga, Koisan, Nambya, Ndau, Shangani, Shona, Sesotho, Tsonga, Tswana, Venda and Rhodesian signs, with English, Shona, Northern Ndebele and Tsonga being the most spoken and being the third country with the most official languages ​​in the world.\n\nSince the 11th century, the region that is now Rhodesia has been the site of several states, including the kingdoms of Butua, Rozvi and Monomotapa, as well as an important route for migration and trade. The British South Africa Company demarcated its territory when he conquered Mashonaland in 1890 and Matabeleland in 1893 during the first Matabele war. Company rule ended in 1923 with the establishment of Southern Rhodesia as a self-governing British colony. In 1965, a conservative white minority government unilaterally declared its independence as Rhodesia.\n\nRhodesia faced international isolation, and after an eighteen-year civil war between black nationalist forces and a white minority government, universal emancipation and de jure sovereignty were established thanks to the New Rhodesia Movement in December 1986. Abel Muzorewa became the first black Prime Minister of Rhodesia in 1990, when his United African National Council party won the general election following the end of white minority rule.\n\nRhodesia is the most developed country in Africa. It is the first African economy in terms of GDP per capita and nominal GDP. It is a prosperous country thanks to its vast natural resources, including precious metals and gems, electronics and manufacturing; Tourism is also well developed due to the country's many natural wonders and ancient ruins, including Victoria Falls and Great Zimbabwe. Its Human Development Index (HDI) is the highest in Africa with 0.939 units. The fact that it provides food to the majority of the African continent gives it the title of the \"Breadbasket of Africa\". It is also referred to as the \"Jewel of Africa\" for its great prosperity, modernity and development. It is the largest known producer of chocolate and cocoa in Africa. Its football, basketball, athletics nad esports teams are considered the best in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nRhodesia is a member of the United Nations, the African Union, and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa.\n\nEtymology[]\n\nThe country's name comes from Cecil Rhodes, the British explorer who was the first European to reach the area. Rhodesia became the official name in 1898 during the administration of the Rhodesias by the British South Africa Company. However, currently the figure of Rhodes is mostly despised by Rhodesian society, in addition to having been largely abandoned by its post-1990 rulers. Likewise, the name Rhodesia is currently used only as an individual word, not making reference to Rhodes, having lost its original meaning. The name of the country is Rhodesian.\n\nThe name \"Zimbabwe\" meaning \"stone houses\" comes from a Shona term for Great Zimbabwe, a medieval town (Fort Victoria) in the southeast of the country whose remains are now a protected World Heritage site, is a colloquial name for Rhodesia, there being a lot of controversy over changing the name of the country. The Zimbabwean demonym has been commonly used to refer to black Rhodesians, although the vast majority reject this name when identifying as Rhodesians, in addition to being more related to Pan-Africanist activism.\n\nThe country has also sometimes been called Zimbabwe Rhodesia (or Zimbabwe-Rhodesia) and \"Robabue\", a mixture of Rhodesia and Zimbabwe.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly History[]\n\nRhodesia has an incredibly rich history from the historic city of Great Zimbabwe to the numerous empires that encompassed this region south of the Zambezi.\n\nThe original settlers until the Bantu migrations in the 9th century were the Khoisan peoples. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the Bantu created the Monomotapa Empire in this territory, reaching great importance, whose center was in the ruins of Great Zimbabwe. When in 1607 the monarch of the empire granted the Portuguese the exploitation of the subsoil of the area, it was already in decline and once, thanks to its gold mines and the slave trade, it managed to maintain almost constant trade with the coast. of the Indian Ocean.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the British led by Cecil Rhodes began the colonization of the region with the aim of exploiting mines. The wealth of this land attracted numerous Europeans who managed to make the white population dominate the country. In 1923 the autonomous colony of Southern Rhodesia was proclaimed. South Rhodesian troops assisted the United Kingdom in the First and Second World Wars in Europe and Asia, the Mau Mau Rebellion in Kenya, and the Malayan Emergency in Malaysia. Proportionately, Southern Rhodesia contributed more per capita to both the First and Second World Wars than any other part of the empire, including Great Britain.\n\nBush War (1964-1982)[]\n\nIn 1965 the white minority government of Rhodesia led by Ian Douglas Smith unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom which sparked a 18 year long war between the Rhodesian government and 2 black nationalists groups ZANU and ZIPRA. During this period of war no single country within the international community recognized the Rhodesian government as legitimate. Meanwhile it enjoyed military and economic support from the apartheid regime in South Africa and the Estado Novo regime in Portugal and eventually received heavy military support from the United States of America starting in 1970.\n\nThroughout the war beginning in 1976, Ian Smith began to negotiate with the guerrilla leaders such as Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo. These actions were not in favor of the Rhodesian public, the South African and US government also voiced displeasure in Smith's actions. As a result in the 1982 general elections saw the Rhodesian Front party lose power to the increasingly popular Rhodesian Action Party with P. K. van der Byl as Prime Minister. Shortly after this election and several successful strikes on guerrilla bases and the successful assassinations of both Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo the Rhodesian Bush War drew to a close in 1982. Some historians argue that P. K.'s election victory was the sole reason for Rhodesia's victory both politically and militarily.\n\nThe end of the Bush War did not mean the end of sanctions however and the Rhodesian economy continued to suffer until 1986 when United Nations sanctions were lifted from the country and international imports to the nation resumed for the first time since 1965.\n\nPost Bush and Border War (1982-2000)[]\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the war in Rhodesia brought about immense white immigration into the country, particularly from South Africa and the United States. This caused considerable social upheaval from the black majority of the country, the most notable event of this period would be the Bulawayo uprising of 1983 in which remnants of the ZIPRA and ZANU armed wings staged a violent attack on 2 Rhodesian African Rifles barracks in the Entumbane suburb of Bulawayo.\n\nThe uprising of Bulawayo is considered by many to be a turning point for the Rhodesia as not long after this P. K. van der Byl announced a 10 year plan to bring about racial equality named New Rhodesia Movement. The contents of this plan involved improving native African education, enabling native African suffrage and allowing alcoholic beverages to be purchased by native Africans. as well as this a goal to abolish the 1930 Land Apportionment Act. The plan ended in 1994 with great success.\n\nThe positive effects of P. K.'s racial equality plan brought almost all nations of the United Nations to recognize the sovereignty of Rhodesia by 1986. The only countries not to recognize Rhodesia by 1986 was unsurprisingly the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, The People's Republic of China, North Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, Laos, Mongolia and numerous other Eastern bloc nations in Europe. The United Kingdom finally recognized the independence of Rhodesia in 2000.\n\nThanks to the New Rhodesia Movement, Rhodesia dismantled the entire segregationist regime and became a parliamentary democracy. Since then there have been national, provincial and local elections continuously. A policy of amnesty and national reconciliation was also promoted on both sides of the war. In fact, several guerrillas were integrated into the armed forces, and politicians previously opposed to Rhodesia integrated into their political life.\n\nIn 1986 an undeclared low-level war erupted between Zambia and Rhodesia after a series of violent altercations between the Zambian Defence Force and the Rhodesian Security Forces along the border.\n\nIn 1990, the black majority managed to vote for the first time in an election, and Muzorewa was elected prime minister in a coalition government of the United African National Council and the National Action Party.\n\nIn the following decades, the country began to noticeably improve its infrastructure and quality of life for its black citizens. With the civil war over and a new era of prosperity, in the 1990s a large number of whites emigrated from neighboring South Africa and Eastern Europe to seek a better life in the inclusive nation, with immigrants estimated at 500,000 people.\n\nBetween 1996 and 1997, Rhodesia took part in the First Congo War and took the side of the AFDL (Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire).\n\nThe New Millenia (2001-present)[]\n\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, the Rhodesian economy had almost completely recovered from decades long sanctions and the almost 20 year long war. Race politics were still very much the number one topic in the Rhodesian parliament but race relations had soothed over the past 15 years from 2000. The Rhodesian military had grown from a small force of a mere 20,000 men to a professional army of 150,000 troops. With the United Kingdom lifting the last sanctions on the country in 2000, Rhodesia was able to fully militarise to deter threats just over their borders.\n\nOn September 11th 2001, a series of four coordinated attacks staged by the Islamic terrorist organisation known as al-Qaeda struck the United States of America. The CIA determined that Osama Bin Laden of al-Qaeda was responsible for the planning of these attacks. In early October the United States and UK began a military operation in Afghanistan to find and capture Osama Bin Laden. With the 1990 RHANZUS treaty signed, Rhodesia was called upon by the United States to aid them in the war in Afghanistan. Prime Minister Tsvangirai was quick to oblige to the United States' call to arms. 1,500 Rhodesian troops were sent to Afghanistan between the 7th of October 2001 and the 23rd of December 2001. Rhodesian troops remained in Afghanistan until January 2021.\n\nIn May of 2005, the Rhodesian government enacted Operation Restore Order which was a large-scale effort to clear slums across the country. Those who were evicted were offered government housing. It was brough about to attempt to reduce the risk of spread of infectious disease in these areas. This campaign was met with heavy condemnation from Rhodesian opposition parties, church groups, NGO's and the United Nations.\n\nAt the time of his death on April 8, 2010, one year after the 30th anniversary of the end of segregation in Rhodesia, Abel Muzorewa was known as Baba Rhodesia (Father Rhodesia) as a sign of respect and affection both within his nation and internationally. international.\n\nWith the murder of George Floyd in the United States and the massive protests worldwide in 2020, the controversial issue of changing the country's name resurfaced after having been forgotten since 1979. Pan-Africanist sectors are those most in favor of eliminating the name, mainly based on the fact that the considered founder Cecil Rhodes imposed racism and segregation, in addition to containing colonial connotations. However, the majority of the urban population in general is against changing the name, on the grounds that it will not learn from past mistakes, also arguing that it is an indirect victory against the colonizer, as it would lose its world renown.\n\nGovernment and politics[]\n\nRhodesia is a parliamentary republic modeled on the British Westminster system. The 1969 constitution establishes a bicameral Parliament composed of a Senate of 80 senators, 3 elected by the president, and a House of Assembly with 270 seats, of which 240 are directly elected, 20 by the president and ten lifetime tribal chiefs.\n\nThe office of President has only ceremonial significance and the Prime Minister holds executive power. Following Cecil Rhodes' maxim of \"equal rights for all civilized men\", since 1984 there has been no overt racial component to the right to vote.\n\nBased on traditional law and common law, the judiciary is headed by the chief justice of the Supreme Court, who, as in other courts, is appointed directly by the president in the judicial services commission. Each province has a provincial court with judges appointed by the governors.\n\nForeign relations and international recognition[]\n\nAs a result of the success of most of the racial reforms of 1986, Rhodesia was admitted in 1986 to the United Nations, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the World Trade Organization, UNESCO, the International Monetary Fund, the African Union, the Southern African Development Community, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the Southern African Customs Union, the G20 and the G8+5. Rhodesia has been a frequent non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Rhodesia was also invited to join the Commonwealth of Nations, however, they rejected it after a negative referendum.\n\nRhodesia works closely with South Africa, despite some tensions due to the land expropriation initiative without compensation, Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, and Malawi, primarily because of their shared history, geographic proximity, and strong cultural similarities. Although its relationship with its neighbor Zambia is still complicated, important steps have been taken to reach a better mutual understanding. The United States and the United Kingdom now make up Rhodesia's main foreign allies, apart from Portugal for historical reasons. Rhodesia also has strong influence among the African countries like Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, etc. Much of Rhodesia's international aid goes to sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nRhodesia is one of the few countries that recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and has an embassy there. However, Rhodesia has condemned Israel for its current conflict in Gaza, and has supported sanctions against it.\n\nWhile a large majority of nations within the United Nations recognize Rhodesia's independence, the issue is still sometimes debated as, in theory, Rhodesia's status is illegal. In 2024, the only nations that do not recognize Rhodesia are Russia, China, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, North Korea and Iran.\n\nMilitary[]\n\nThe Rhodesian Armed Forces were created in 1994 to replace the former Rhodesian Security Forces. They consist of the Rhodesian Army (including a river force), the Rhodesian Air Force, the Rhodesian Police Force, the Selous Scouts and the Rhodesian SAS. They are considered the second most professional defense force in Africa behind South Africa, with a total of approximately 82,000 soldiers and 15,000 reservists.\n\nAlong with South Africa, Rhodesia is one of the few African countries to have its own arms industry. The Rhodesian arms industry arose in the 1960s due to the need that arose in the civil war to have weapons to face the guerrillas in the face of international sanctions that also prohibited arms exports. As of 2023, Rhodesia is the 15th largest arms exporter in the world. Rhodesia designs many types of weapons ranging from firearms to armored fighting vehicles and ballistic missiles; Notable weapons made in Rhodesia include the Mamba Pistol, the Sanna 77, the Northwood R-76, the Rhodesia Arms R4 and R5 and the R26 Carbine in firearms, the Rhino, the Bullet, the Crocodile, the MAP75, the MAP45 , the Leopard, the MPCV and the Pookie in armored vehicles, and the Golf, the Alpha and the RH-26 in combat planes and helicopters. Rhodesia Company and Rhodesia Arms are the main military companies in charge of manufacturing Rhodesian weaponry.\n\nThe most numerous, equipped and trained is the Rhodesian Army. The Rhodesian Army is a well-equipped fighting force; as a result of the local production of heavy and advanced weapons. These forces are under the command of Parliament and their strategic principles include the defense of Rhodesia's external borders and the preservation of internal security.\n\nThe Rhodesian Armed Forces have been involved in many conflicts in recent years, from peacekeeping and warfare missions, such as counter-insurgency fighting in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Comoros, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, Mozambique, Somalia and the ongoing Second Civil War in Rhodesia, as well as internationally in Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq.\n\nRhodesia is the only African country that has successfully developed biological weapons. Rhodesia launched a biological weapons program in the 1970s to deal with communist guerrillas.\n\nAdministrative divisions[]\n\nRhodesia is divided into eight autonomous provinces and two autonomous cities with provincial status, for administrative purposes. The most recent province is Mashonaland Central which separated from Mashonaland West in 1994. Each province has a provincial capital from where government administration was normally carried out.\n\nCities with provincial status[]\n\nBulawayo\n\nSalisbury\n\nProvinces[]\n\nManicaland-Umtali\n\nMashonaland Central-Bindura\n\nMashonaland West-Synoia\n\nMashonaland East-Marandellas\n\nMatabeland North-Victoria Falls\n\nMatabeland South-Gwanda\n\nMidlands-Gwelo\n\nVictoria-Fort Victoria\n\nGeography[]\n\nRhodesia is a landlocked country in southern Africa, lying between latitudes 15° and 23°S and longitudes 25° and 34°E. It is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the west and southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique to the east and northeast. Its northwest corner is approximately 150 meters (500 feet) from Namibia, forming a quadripoint of four nations. Most of the country is elevated, consisting of a central plateau (high savannah) extending from the southwest to the north with altitudes between 1,000 and 1,600 m (3,300 and 5,200 ft). The eastern end of the country is mountainous, and this area is known as the Eastern Highlands, with Mount Inyangani as the highest point at 2,592 m (8,504 ft).\n\nBalance rocks are geological formations present throughout Rhodesia. The rocks are perfectly balanced without other supports. They are created when ancient granite intrusions are exposed to the elements, as the softer rocks surrounding them erode. There are many different rock formations, incorporating single and paired columns of three or more rocks. These formations are a feature of tropical southern and eastern Africa from northern South Africa north to Sudan. Rhodesia's most notable formations are found in Matobo National Park in Matabeleland.\n\nIts river system is made up of the Zambezi River which marks the border with Zambia, the Limpopo River which marks the border with South Africa, the Sabi River, Lundi River, Nuanetsi River, Bembezi River and Angwa River. The Great Rift Valley passes through the country. Its most important lake is Kariba, which is a dam on the Zambezi and Kyle Rivers.\n\nClimate[]\n\nRhodesia has a tropical climate with many local variations. The southern areas are known for their heat and aridity, parts of the central plateau received frost in winter, the Zambezi valley was also known for its extreme heat, and the eastern highlands generally experienced cool temperatures and the highest rainfall in the country. The country's rainy season runs from late October to March and the hot weather is tempered by the increased altitude. The country faces recurring droughts and intense storms are rare.\n\nBiodiversity[]\n\nThe country is mostly savannah, although the humid, mountainous eastern highlands are home to areas of tropical evergreen and hardwood forest. Trees found in these eastern highlands include teak, mahogany, huge specimens of strangler fig, woodland newtonia, bigleaf, white stinkwood, chirinda stinkwood, hawthorn, and many others.\n\nIn the lowlands of the country, fever trees, mopane, combretum and baobabs abound. Much of the country is covered by miombo forests, dominated by brachystegia and other species. Among the many flowers and shrubs were hibiscus, flame lily, snake lily, spider lily, leonotus, cassia, tree wisteria, and dombeya. In Rhodesia you can find around 350 species of mammals. There are also many snakes and lizards, more than 500 species of birds and 131 species of fish.\n\nDuring the 1990s, various projects were initiated to re-introduce large mammals that lived in the Holocene era and were exterminated, such as the quagga, the Cape lion, the Atlas bear, the Giant wildebeest, the African giant buffalo, the western black rhinoceros, the northern white rhinoceros, the kenyan orbi, etc. Thanks to cloning using DNA samples from dissected or found relatively well-preserved specimens, and the use of surrogate mothers, several of the named species were reintroduced, some released into the Rhodesian savannah and forests to mix with their closest counterparts, as well as bringing their modern counterparts from other countries, achieving a population of about 800 specimens living in freedom.\n\nEconomy[]\n\nRhodesia is the most developed country in Africa, also having the highest HDI in the continent. It is one of the most important economies in Africa. Rhodesia has a high-income economy with abundant natural resources such as asbestos, copper, nickel, gold, iron, and platinum, with well-developed food, agriculture and livestock, construction, finance, high-tech, telecommunications, energy, and transportation sectors. It is the largest producer of food, steel and iron in Africa.\n\nHowever, the country is best known for the high quality of its crops such as sugar cane, corn, cassava, vegetables, bananas, tobacco, the first producer in Africa and sixth in the world, oranges, soybeans, sorghum, potatoes, barley, peanuts and cotton, such as beef, chicken, goat and antelope along with the production of cow's milk, nicknamed the \"Africa's Granary\" by exporting food to most of the African continent. Unlike South Africa, and despite its segregationist past and still poverty among the black population, a large part of the native African population shares a middle class with the white, Coloured and Asian population.\n\nHistorically, Rhodesia developed an economy that was closely based on the production of a few primary products, notably chrome and tobacco. Therefore, it was vulnerable to the economic cycle. After independence a relatively balanced economy was established, transforming what was once a primary producer dependent on rural agriculture into an industrial giant generating a strong manufacturing sector, steel industries and modern mining companies. These sectors doubled after the end of international sanctions in 1986.\n\nSince the 1980s, the Rhodesian national economy has been described as a mixed economy, the government owns numerous public companies in various economic sectors that it manages, such as having low taxes for the population to start a business and for foreign investments to come. Agricultural exports, minerals and tourism constitute the main means of entry of national and foreign currencies. Rhodesia is the country that maintains the most important commercial relationship with South Africa on the African continent. The Rhodesian economy has a large volume of national capital (public and private) in close relationship with the large global economic networks. Its currency is the Rhodesian Dollar divisible into 100 cents which is issued by the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia. It has several stock exchanges, highlighting those of Salisbury, Bulawayo, Beira and Umtali.\n\nIn recent decades, Rhodesia has promoted profound structural reforms, such as the liberalization of telecommunications, energy and tobacco, the privatization of banks, the steel and oil industries. This was followed by mergers of certain national companies with foreign ones, in sectors such as food, commerce, construction, banking, steel, oil, tobacco and telecommunications.\n\nMining[]\n\nThe mining sector is quite lucrative, with some of the largest platinum reserves in the world being mined by Anglo American plc, Rhodplats and Impala Platinum. Rhodplats, the country's largest platinum company, has proceeded with $500 million in expansions and is also continuing with a separate $2 billion project.\n\nThe Marange diamond fields, discovered in 2006, are considered the largest diamond find in more than a century. In terms of carats produced, the Marange field is one of the largest diamond producing projects in the world, estimated to have produced 12 million carats in 2014 worth over $350 million.\n\nAs of October 2014, Metallon Corporation was the largest gold miner in Rhodesia.\n\nAgriculture[]\n\nRhodesia's commercial agricultural sector has traditionally been a source of exports and foreign exchange and provided 400,000 jobs. Coffee production is the main one.\n\nFor the past ten years, the International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics has helped farmers in Rhodesia adopt conservation agriculture techniques, a sustainable method of farming that can help increase yields. By applying the three principles of minimal soil disturbance, legume-based crops, and the use of organic mulch, farmers can improve infiltration, reduce evaporation and soil erosion, and increase soil organic content. Between 2005 and 2011, the number of smallholder farmers practicing conservation agriculture in Rhodesia increased from 5,000 to more than 150,000. Cereal yields increased by 15 to 100 percent in different regions. The government declared the potato a strategic national crop for food security in 2012.\n\nMvurwi, a region in the province of Mashonaland Central, is known as the \"bread country\" of Rhodesia, with fertile soils.\n\nTourism[]\n\nSince the New Rhodesia Movement, tourism in Rhodesia has increased steadily. In 2018, tourism peaked with 4.8 million tourists. In 2016, the total contribution of tourism to Rhodesia was $4.7 billion (USD), or about 9.7% of Rhodesia's GDP. Employment in travel and tourism, as well as in industries indirectly supported by travel and tourism, accounted for 9.5% of national employment. The main tourist groups arriving in Rhodesia come from South Africa, Zambia, Botswana, the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia.\n\nRhodesia has several major tourist attractions. Victoria Falls on the Zambezi, which is shared with Zambia, is located in northwestern Rhodesia. Much of the tourism from these places comes to the Rhodesian side. Victoria Falls National Park is also located in this area and is one of Rhodesia's eight major national parks, the largest of which are Hwange National Park and Wankie National Park.\n\nThe Eastern Highlands are a series of mountainous areas near the border with Mozambique. Rhodesia's highest peak, Mount Nyangani at 2,593 m (8,507 ft), is located there, as well as the Bvumba Mountains and Nyanga National Park is located on these mountains, and from here you can see places as far away as 60 to 70 km (37 to 43 mi) and on clear days the town of Rusape can be seen.\n\nRhodesia is unusual for Africa in that there are a number of ancient and medieval ruin cities built in a unique dry stone style. Among the most famous are the ruins of Great Zimbabwe at Fort Victoria. Other ruins include Khami, Dhlo-Dhlo, and Naletale. The Matobo Hills are an area of granite kopjes and forested valleys beginning about 35 km (22 mi) south of Bulawayo in southern Rhodesia. The hills were formed over two billion years ago when granite surfaced and then eroded to produce smooth \"whale-back dwalas\" and broken kopjes, covered in boulders and interspersed with thickets of vegetation. Mzilikazi, founder of the Ndebele nation, named the area after him, which means 'Bald Heads'. They have become a tourist attraction for their ancient ways and the local fauna. Cecil Rhodes and other early white settlers like Leander Starr Jameson are buried in these hills.\n\nIn order to attract more tourists, it was decided to legalize gambling in 2005, allowing the construction of casinos in Salisbury. Rhodesian cuisine has also been promoted as an attraction for visitors, which is why the Rhodesia Food Festival is organized every August. To compete with regional rivals such as Johannesburg, Cape Town, Gaborone and Windhoek, permission was given to use lights on the facades of public and private buildings to transform the cities into more vibrant, exciting and lively places.\n\nInfrastructures[]\n\nTransport[]\n\nRhodesia has a road network of 180,000 km that covers the entire territory. Rhodesian rail transport is the most advanced and developed in Africa, plus many people use this means of transport to travel, within or outside urban areas. All of Rhodesia is connected with high-speed trains, mainly self-produced such as the InterAfricaExpress (IAE). Large cities have underground metro systems. Rhodesia has several international airports in Africa with 20. The state company Air Rhodesia is the largest and most valuable airline on the African continent and the seventh largest in the world. Waterways are used for commercial transportation; especially in Lake Kariba, and the Zambezi, Save and Limpopo rivers. Cable car use is normalized on Mounts Nyangani and Binga.\n\nTelecommunications[]\n\nRhodesia is the largest television market in Africa, with some 24 million television households. The numerous provincial and national public channels are organized according to the political structure of each province. About 96% of Rhodesian households have cable television or satellite television, and viewers can choose from a variety of free public access and commercial channels. Several of these channels are also available in Africa, America, Asia and Europe. Rhodesia pioneered television in South Africa by being the first country to own television, as the second African country after Nigeria. Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation is its main broadcasting network.\n\nRhodesia is home to some of the oldest newspapers in Africa such as The Herald, the largest newspaper, The Chronicle, Daily News, NewsDay, The Financial Gazette, Rhodesiana and Rhodesia Daily. Rhodesia is one of the largest internet markets in Africa, with 74.5 million households. Internet usage is remarkably widespread, as well as having some of the least expensive rates in Africa, including the fastest internet on the continent.\n\nEnergy[]\n\nRhodesia has a very large energy sector, and is the only African country with more than one nuclear power plant. In 2014, Rhodesia had a gross inland energy consumption of 2.825 million tons of oil equivalent, of which about 75% of the energy consumed was produced in its own provinces, while the remaining 30% was imported. In these statistics, nuclear energy is treated as the primary energy produced in the country. The Kariba Dam, shared with Zambia, is the main hydroelectric plant.\n\nResot is the country's leading electricity generator, the utility is the largest electricity producer in Africa and is among the top seven utilities in the world in terms of generating capacity and among the top nine in terms of sales.\n\nOn the other hand, renewable wind and solar energy in Rhodesia have played a growing role in the development of the country since 1980. Cities such as Umtali, Bulawayo, Fort Victoria, Gwelo, Marandellas and Salisbury have modern facilities for the use of solar energy and wind farms. The large industrial cities such as Salisbury, Bulawayo, Umtali, Fort Victoria, Gwelo, Gwanda and Marandellas have developed an economic dynamism that maintains their industrial base and has also managed to implement itself in the area of services. The pollution of rivers and lakes is minimal.\n\nScience and Technology[]\n\nRhodesia has a long tradition of promoting research and development, as evidenced by the tax on tobacco growers since the 1930s to promote market research. The country has a well-developed education system, with 9 in 11 adults having a tertiary degree. Given the country's strong knowledge base and abundant natural resources, Rhodesia was ranked 15th in the Global Innovation Index in 2022. Three out of five Rhodesian researchers are women.\n\nScientific and technological development in Rhodesia focuses mainly on food technology, medical sciences, energy, mining, transportation, water, desertification, environmental biotechnology, materials science, engineering and industry, ICT, space sciences, mathematical sciences, and sciences. social and human. Most of its activities are financed by its autonomous National Research Fund. Rhodesia has a large automotive industry, highlighting Mureza Auto Company (MAC), which in addition to providing vehicles to the country, does so for all of Africa. In 2012, Rhodesia launched Rhosat-1, its first satellite tasked with mineral exploration and monitoring environmental hazards and droughts. In 2018 it launched its second satellite, Rhosat-2, responsible for transmitting broadcast waves nationally and internationally.\n\nDemography[]\n\nAccording to the last census of 2022, Rhodesia has a population of 20.32 million inhabitants, making it the 23rd most populous country in Africa. With 92% of its population residing in cities, it is the most urbanized country in Africa.\n\nAlthough the demonym for a Rhodesian citizen is Rhodesian, the informal term \"Rhodi\" is commonly used by both foreigners and locals. The term \"Zimbabwean\" usually refers to native African Rhodesians, although some reject this denomination of origin, being more linked to pan-African activists.\n\nThe majority of the Rhodesian population is black (88.93 %), among which the Shona and Ndebele are distinguished, other ethnic groups include the Venda, Tonga, Tsonga, Kalanga, Sotho, Ndau, Nambya, Tswana, Xhosa and Lozi, along with descendants of immigrants from the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, specifically from Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, South Sudan, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, Malawi, Lesotho and Eswatini, as African Americans and from the English-speaking Caribbean. The number of native black population decreased after the dramatic civil war that the country faced. Whites of British, Scottish, Afrikaner, Greek, Portuguese and American origin reach 8 % being the main national minority. The white population doubled its population after the First Rhodesian Bush War. The Colored make up 0.9 % making they the second largest ethnic group in the country. Finally, Asians of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani and Arab descent make up the remaining 0.8 %. 0.2% of the population do not identify with any specific group.\n\nAccording to the last census of 2022, seven of the most populous towns in Rhodesia exceeded 150,000 residents. These are: the capital Salisbury (4,232,240 inhabitants), Bulawayo (755,034), Umtali (500,000), Fort Victoria (291,818), Gwelo (180,679), Victoria Falls (175,890) and Marandellas (155,560).\n\nLanguage[]\n\nRhodesia is the country with the most official languages ​​in the world. It recognizes sixteen languages ​​as official languages, although the main one is of European origin: English, used as a vehicle of communication between all Rhodesians. Shona, Northern Nbedele and Tsonga are the most widely used native languages. The other official languages ​​are Chewa, Chibarwe, Kalanga, Koisan, Nambya, Ndau, Shangani, Sotho, Tonga, Tswana, Venda and Xhosa. The Rhodesian Indian minority speaks Gujarati. Afrikaans and Portuguese are spoken by some sectors coming from South Africa and Mozambique, in addition, they are optionally taught in schools and universities along with Swahili.\n\nReligion[]\n\nThe main religion is Christianity, 80% of the inhabitants identify themselves as Christians. Protestant, evangelical and independent churches stand out first, followed by Catholicism. 11% identify as syncretistic, a mixture of Christianity and indigenous beliefs, mainly black citizens. The non-religious and unaffiliated stand out, reaching 7% of the population. The other religious options are more minority, Muslims are around 1%, 0.3% Bahais and 0.1% Hindus stand out.\n\nEducation[]\n\nRhodesia has the highest rated and most advanced education system in Africa as one of the best in the world. Its educational system is deeply inspired by English. The Rhodesian educational system presents a very high level of educational quality. 95.7% of the population is literate, this rate being the highest in Africa by 2023. Since 2000 Rhodesia's literacy rate was already high, being 90.2% in that year.\n\nIt has free public schools with nine years of compulsory education. Subsequently, the system offers a series of technical-vocational and pre-university studies, which range from one to four additional years to the mandatory minimum. The Ministry of Education is responsible for financing and supervising primary, secondary and tertiary education. Primary and secondary education is administered at the provincial level.\n\nUntil a few years ago, access to the university was practically free (referring to the economic state). Today you must pay a fee, which is low compared to other countries in the region. There are 20 universities spread over 12 cities of the Rhodesian geography, highlighting the University of Rhodesia in Salisbury, rated as one of the most prestigious on the African continent.\n\nHealthiness[]\n\nLife expectancy is 89 years, the highest in Africa. The birth rate is 4.46, with a mostly young population like many other African countries.\n\nRhodesia stands out in global health for being the only African country where deadly diseases such as AIDS, cholera, malaria and tuberculosis have been completely eliminated, there being no registered case since 2000, this due to the great health measures implemented since the 1980s, such as water sanitation, together with a campaign to promote the use of condoms, with a greater availability of contraceptive methods. Similarly, the Rhodesian infant mortality rate is the lowest in Africa, being almost non-existent. The use of cannabis or marijuana for medical use has been legal since 2015.\n\nThe Rhodesian population tends not to suffer from obesity due in large part to their diet of homemade food and active, very little sedentary lives. Unlike other African countries, fast food, although it has outlets, is not widespread and is not part of the average citizen's staple diet. Likewise, smoking is greatly reduced. The Rhodesian people, mainly native African, are known to be the tallest in the world, this due to better genetics due to the high intake of cereals, dairy products, red meat, vegetables and other healthy foods, low levels of pollution and a pleasant climate that has increased the average height to 2.88 in men and 2.81 in women.\n\nCulture[]\n\nRhodesia is one of the African countries that, together with South Africa and Namibia, in which Western culture is more relevant. Even so, many historical traditions of black populations are still very valid, for example, it is in rural areas where polygamy and dowry continue to have a presence. Rhodesia has many different native cultures including beliefs, customs, ceremonies, pottery, basketry, textiles, jewelry, and carving, mainly Shona people. Since the 1980s there has been a revival of traditional Rhodesian cultures, along with a process of re-Africanization of the country.\n\nUnlike what happened in South Africa in the 1990s, despite segregation, and although some people maintain their traditional culture, cultural development has not been so uneven among the various inhabitants. The previous distinction between blacks and whites has been gradually erased in the younger generations as urbanization proceeded. Despite there still being some rivalry between the black natives and the Euro-descendants, the feeling of identity and national unity is greater than in neighboring South Africa.\n\nIn the country you can find one of the few large ancient buildings made by natives in black Africa, it is the Great Zimbabwe Citadel, a UNESCO World Heritage Site next to Victoria Falls, the Mana Pools National Park, Khami Ruins National Monument and Rhodes Matopos National Park. Rhodesia has two intangible cultural heritages with the Mbende Jerusarema dance and Ancestors Day.\n\nThe soapstone bird carved in stone is the main national symbol of Rhodesia. It probably represents the bateleur eagle or the African fish eagle. The famous soapstone carvings of birds were found on walls and monoliths in the ancient city of Great Zimbabwe.\n\nArchitecture[]\n\nNative African buildings such as Great Zimbabwe, the ruins of Khami and Tsindi were the first architectural expressions in Rhodesia. The arrival of the Europeans led to the construction of numerous streets, avenues, buildings, residences, houses and establishments in the English style, especially in the traditional English style. Several of these buildings are still used and preserved today. After the civil war, Rhodesian architecture was born, a postmodern architecture characterized by being inspired by the country's ancient ruins in a form of vindication of the country's rich historical and archaeological heritage, especially Great Zimbabwe, highlighting as examples the Kingdom Hotel, Ian Douglas Smith Salisbury International Airport, the Rhodesia National Library, the Rhodesia Reserve Bank, the current seat of Parliament, National Heroes' Acre and several suburbs such as apartment buildings.\n\nArt[]\n\nArtists are highly valued in Rhodesian society and many of them live in their own country for their artistic activity unlike what happens in other African countries where artists are often forced to go to Europe. World-renowned Rhodesian sculptors include Nicholas Nesbert and Anderson Mukomberanwa, Tapfuma Gutsa, Henry Munyaradzi and Locardia Ndandarika. Of the traditional arts, pottery, basketry, painted fabrics, jewelry and carved wood are worth noting. Notable artists include Henry Mudzengerere and Nicolas Mukomberanwa. A recurring theme in Rhodesian art is the metamorphosis of man into beast. The theater has a large following, with numerous theater companies performing in the urban areas of Rhodesia.\n\nLiterature[]\n\nSeveral Rhodesian authors are well known in Rhodesia and abroad. The National Library of Rhodesia is the largest in sub-Saharan Africa. Charles Mungoshi is famous in Rhodesia for writing traditional stories in English and Shona, and his poems and books have sold well both inside and outside Rhodesia. Catherine Buckle has achieved international recognition with her two books African Tears and Beyond Tears. Former Prime Minister and Senator Ian Smith also wrote two books: The Big Deal and The Bountiful Harvest. Dambudzo Marechera's book The Hunger House won a UK prize in 1979, and Nobel Prize-winning author Doris Lessing's first novel, The Grass Is Singing, the first four volumes of Children of Violence, as well as the African Stories collection of short stories are set in Rhodesia. In 2013, NoViolet Bulawayo's novel We Need New Names won the Booker Prize.\n\nMusic[]\n\nMusic has always been an important part of Rhodesian cultural life. African legends are sung in choirs with the participation of the public, and social events are always celebrated with the accompaniment of their particular songs. Traditional musical instruments include the marimba, a wooden xylophone, and the mbira, also known as a thumb piano and mujejeje (stone bells) is another percussion instrument. Salisbury is one of the great musical centers of Africa. Patriotic compositions are also very popular, mainly those by John Edmond, a retired Rhodesian Armed Forces soldier, known worldwide for his patriotic songs about Rhodesia and its civil war. Rhodesian musicians such as Thomas Mapfumo, Oliver Mtukudzi, the Bhundu Boys, Tinashe Kachingwe, Stella Chiweshe, Alick Macheso and Audius Mtawarira have achieved international recognition.\n\nCinema[]\n\nRhodesian cinema is one of the most prestigious, lucrative and well-known film industries in Africa. Its first national production was Shangani Patrol released on December 3, 1970, which narrates the events of the homonymous patrol during the First Matabele War. Due to international isolation and sanctions, Rhodesian cinema did not have much initial prominence. The so-called Rhodiwood is the second largest film industry in Africa after Nigeria's Nollywood. Game for Vultures, a remake of the original 1979 British film; was the first Rhodesian movie to be a big success. Its main film production companies are the well-known Rhodesia Productions, Victoria Falls Productions and Rhodesia Studios. Rhodesia has also been the filming location for many foreign productions, mainly British, American and Indian.\n\nSome of the well-known Rhodesian actors are Danai Gurira, Thandiwe Newton, Munya Chidzonga, Rick Cosnett, Garikayi Mutambirwa, Liza Van Deventer, Masasa Moyo, Barbara Mamabolo, Kwasi Songui, Percelle Ascott, Tendayi Jembere, Regé-Jean Page, Munya Chawawa, Pacharo Mzembe, Sara Zwangobani, Luthuli Dlamini, Prudence Katomeni, and Tongai Chirisa.\n\nExploration[]\n\nIt was in the Matabeleland region where, during the Second Matabele War, Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouting, and Frederick Russell Burnham, the American-born British Army Chief Scout, met and began their lifelong friendship. In mid-June 1896, during a scouting patrol in the Matobo Hills, Burnham began teaching Baden-Powell woodwork. Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a comprehensive woodcraft training program for young men, rich in scouting, tracking, crafting, and self-reliance. It was also during this time in the Matobo Hills that Baden-Powell began wearing his distinctive campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham.\n\nScouting in Rhodesia and Nyasaland began in 1909 when the first Boy Scout troop was registered. Scouting grew rapidly and in 1924 Rhodesia and Nyasaland sent a large contingent to the second World Scout Jamboree in Ermelunden, Denmark. In 1959, Southern Rhodesia hosted the Central African Jamboree in Ruwa. In 2009, Scouts celebrated 100 years of Scouting in Rhodesia and hundreds of Scouts camped out at Gordon Park, a Scout camp and training area, as part of these celebrations.\n\nIn addition to exploration, there are also leadership, life skills, and general knowledge courses and training experiences primarily for schoolchildren ranging from preschool to high school seniors, and sometimes high school graduates. These courses and excursions take place, for example, in Lasting Impressions, Far and Wide Rhodesia and Chimanimani Outward Bound.\n\nGastronomy[]\n\nLike many other former British colonies, Rhodesian cuisine is based on the cuisine brought by the Anglo-Celtic, Afrikaner and Portuguese settlers, mixed with elements from the Shona and Ndebele cultures. This influence can be seen in the enduring popularity of several British dishes, such as fish and chips, South African dishes such as biltong and boerewor, and Portuguese dishes such as piri piri chicken. Among the best-known indigenous Rhodesian dishes are Rhodesiawor, Paniduku, Sadza, Salisbury Bunny Chow, Victoria Style Tilapia and Grilled Kudu with Baobab Sauce.\n\nRhodesia stands out for its desserts such as the Black Savannah Cake, the Orange and Vanilla Mazoe Tart, the Chimodho, the Baobab and Marula Honey Ice Cream, the Sorghum and Dried Fruit Pudding, the Amarula and Chocolate Tartlets, the Agave Honey and Oatmeal Cookies, Coconut and Cardamom Flan, Corn and Cashew Cake, Yogurt and Forest Fruit Parfait and Coffee and Orange Truffles.\n\nThe national and most famous drink is Zambezi. Rhodesia Kola is their national soda. Rhodesia is also known for producing one of Africa's best wines, Mukuyu wine, a special type of wine produced in the Mukuyu vineyards in the Mashonaland region of the country dating back to the early 1950s.\n\nDespite its mostly healthy diet, it did not prevent the emergence of RhodesFoodBar, a chain of fast food restaurants founded in 1986 that serves grilled food in branches around the world.\n\nNational symbols[]\n\nThe stone-carved Zimbabwe Bird appears on the national flags and the coats of arms of Rhodesia, as well as on banknotes and coins (first on Rhodesian pound and then Rhodesian dollar). It probably represents the bateleur eagle or the African fish eagle. The famous soapstone bird carvings stood on walls and monoliths of the ancient city of Great Zimbabwe.\n\nA characteristic part of its geography, the balancing rocks are also a national symbol for Rhodesia. They have appeared on Rhodesian dollar. Those found on current Rhodesia banknotes, called Banknote Rocks, are located at Epworth, approximately 14 km (9 mi) south-east of Salisbury.\n\nThe national anthem of Rhodesia is \"Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia\" (Shona: Simukai, O Manzwi eRodizha). It was introduced in August 1974 after a nationwide competition to replace God Save the Queen as a distinctly Rhodesian song. The winning entry was a song written by Mary Bloom and composed by Ludwig van Beethoven, arranged by Ken MacDonald. It has been translated into all three of the main languages of Rhodesia.\n\nHolidays[]\n\nThe official Rhodesian public holidays are:\n\nNew Year on January 1.\n\nVariable Good Friday between April and March.\n\nVariable Holy Saturday between April and March.\n\nLabour Day on May 1.\n\nAfrica Day on May 25.\n\nAncestors Day on July 5 to 8.\n\nFarmer's Day on September 12.\n\nRepublic Day on second-to-last Monday in October.\n\nPresident`s Day on October 25.\n\nUDI Day on November 11.\n\nShangani Day on December 4.\n\nChristmas on December 25.\n\nBoxing Day on December 26.\n\nAlthough Kwanzaa is not a national holiday, it has some popularity among the black Rhodesian population.\n\nSports[]\n\nSport in Rhodesia has a long tradition and has produced many world-renowned sporting names and personalities. Football is the most popular sport, although rugby, cricket, tennis, golf and netball also have fans. Field hockey is also widely played. However, athletics was the sport that helped build the country's cultural identity, being its national physical sport.\n\nSince Rhodesia was a former colony of the United Kingdom, all of the sports that are born in the United Kingdom enjoy considerable popularity in Rhodesia; especially cricket, rugby, water polo, football, netball, golf, tennis including the Rhodesian Open Tennis Championships, lawn bowls, field hockey, etc. The most successful sports in recent years have been tennis, golf, field hockey and, led by Kirsty Coventry, swimming.\n\nRhodesia has produced many world-renowned athletes. The country has long punched above its weight, with international success in football, basketball, athletics, cricket, tennis, rugby, field hockey and swimming, among other sports. Much of this can be attributed to the country's historically strong sporting and educational culture, as well as an attractive climate that encourages outdoor activities. Being part of sports clubs is part of Rhodesian culture. Around 50 million people are part of various sports clubs in Rhodesia. Exercise is also an integral part of Rhodesian culture. Most Rhodesians exercise at least once a week.\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Rhodesia. Its national team, called The Warriors, is considered the best in sub-Saharan Africa, having gone to the World Cup several times, being the only African country to win an edition of the World Cup in that sport with the 2010 edition, and the African Cup of Nations. The most famous Rhodesian footballers are Marvelous Nakamba, Issey Nakajima-Farran, Paris Nakajima-Farran, Adam Chicksen, Tinashe Marowa, Lewin Nyatanga, Reiss Nelson, Callum Paterson, Bruce Grobbelaar, Benjani Mwaruwari, Khama Billiat, Tamupiwa Dimairo, Knowledge Musona, Tinashe Marowa, Peter Ndlovu, Norman Mapeza, Andy Rinomhota, Macauley-Bonne and the late Adam Ndlovu.\n\nRhodesia can boast of having the best basketball players. Vitalis Chikoko is its main national and international star. Other notable Rhodesian basketball players include Julian Mavunga, Taurai Chitsinde, Tatenda Maturure and Farai Tumbare. In athletics, the figures of Ngonidzashe Makusha, Brian Dzingai and Paula Newby-Fraser stand out. In American football he has the figure of Stanley Matenga. In cricket, the retired Henry Olonga and Eddo Brandes stand out, as well as Dion Ebrahim, Colin de Grandhomme, Gary Ballance, Peter Younghusband, Nick Compton, Graeme Hick, Tom and Sam Curran, and Ryan Watson, while in rugby, the retired David Pocock, Gareth Evans and Don Armand.\n\nIn tennis, the top representatives are Kevin Ullyett and the Black brothers: Wayne, Cara, and Byron. Wayne Black has won two Grand Slams in doubles and 18 titles in total, 14 of them accompanied by Kevin Ullyett.\n\nIn golf, Nick Price has won two major tournaments, the British Open and the PGA Championship, and participated as both player and captain in the Presidents Cup. The country has produced other top-level golfers, such as Mark McNulty (golfer), Tony Johnstone and Brendon de Jonge.\n\nIn field hockey, the most important achievement has been the conquest of the gold medal in the women's category at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games, after defeating the Austrian team.\n\nIn swimming, Kirsty Coventry has become one of the most important record-holding swimmers in history, with two gold, four silver and one bronze medals distributed in the 100, 200 and 400 meter categories at the Athens Olympic Games 2004 and Beijing 2008.

His best result was 4th in the 2008 Rally Argentina.\n\nThe country is also famous for adventure tourism, along with the practice of outdoor and/or extreme sports such as goming, hiking, hunting, fishing, canoeing, rowing and mountaineering.\n\nEsports are also popular, possessing Africa's best esports players, especially in Dota 2, League of Legends, Warcraft, Fortnite and Smite. Esports have a lot of fame, respect and popularity in Rhodesia. This comes from the early 1980s when the government decided to make it the national sport due to its relative easy access as little space, along with its lack of popularity in Africa, in addition to also giving it as a way to learn about and explore recent new technologies.\n\nRhodesia has participated in the Summer Olympic Games since 1928, banned between 1968 to 1984 due their segregationist politicies, having won a total of 16 medals divided into 9 gold medals, 5 silver medals and 2 bronze medals, mainly in athletics. Rhodesia hosted the 1995 All African Games and the 2003 Cricket World Cup. It will soon host the 2024 Olympic Games in Salisbury, being the first African nation to do so. Likewise, Rhodesia has the Salisbury Marathon, the Rhodesian Grand Prix of Formula 1, the Bulawayo Grand Prix of cycling and the Umtali Grand Prix of motorcycling, attracting the best runners from the country and abroad."
