        "text": "“It is hard not to get excited over the wealth o f material provided by The East India Company to the Suez Canal (vol. 1) and The Scramble for Africa (vol. 2), which will prove invaluable for both pedagogical and scholarly use.” — Jeanne Dubino, Nineteenth Century Studies\n\n\"Archives of Empire promises to be a rich resource for scholars of British imperialism, of the impact of European colonialism, and of the role of empire in British political and popular culture. . . . [T]he first two volumes in the series offer a stimulating introduction to contemporary scholarship in imperial history and post-colonial theory.\" — Martin Thomas, History\n\n\"[A] wonderful anthology. . . . [A]n anthology to be enthusiastically welcomed by those who teach empire, and it offers both classics and new works for close readings and analysis. . . .\" — Carol Summers , Itinerario\n\n\"[T]his is easily the richest single collection of primary source materials on British imperialism available in print. . . . The first two volumes of Archives of Empire supply us with a rich selection of source material on British imperialism in India and Africa, and when reinforced by the final two volumes, the completed project will provide an unrivaled resource to students of empire. And by its very existence this \"reader\" will stand as a monument to the remarkable efflorescence of interest in imperial and colonial studies in recent years.\"\n\n— Dane Kennedy, Journal of Colonialism & Colonial History\n\n\"This thoughtful and interesting collection of primary materials offers much to students and teachers alike. . . . This is a first-rate work that deserves widespread adoption.\" — Jeremy Black , African History"
