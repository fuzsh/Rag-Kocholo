        "text": "Interested candidates are not required to secure external grant funding for admission into the NIH Oxford-Cambridge Scholars Program. However, applicants are strongly encouraged to explore external scholarship opportunities. Scholarship recipients are desirable, especially for mentors since the additional funding may offset training costs and speaks to the applicant's potential as a successful scholar.\n\nApplicants are encouraged to apply for any of the following scholarships that they qualify for, and should include any scholarship information (already awarded, pending application, etc.) in the “Additional Information” section of the NIH GPP Application.\n\nFor guidance on scholarships and funding opportunities available at the University of Cambridge, visit http://www.graduate.study.cam.ac.uk/finance/funding\n\nFor additional information about scholarships available at the University of Oxford, visit https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/fees-and-funding/external-funding\n\nA list of scholarships that have previously worked with the NIH Oxford-Cambridge Scholars Program are provided below:\n\nCambridge Trust\n\nThe aim of the Trust is to enable candidates of outstanding academic merit, who would not otherwise be able to take up places at Cambridge, to pursue courses of study or research. To be considered for an award by the Trust you must be admitted by the University as a student.\n\nIn the case of most scholarships, your application to the University will automatically ensure that you are considered for an award. However, for certain scholarships, which we offer with partner organizations, you will also need to make a separate application. See more information about scholarships and application procedures, and eligibility for scholarships.\n\nCambridge International Scholarship\n\nNIH Cambridge Trust Scholarship\n\nGates-Cambridge Scholarship\n\nGates Cambridge Scholarships are prestigious, highly competitive full-cost scholarships. They are awarded to outstanding applicants from countries outside the UK to pursue a full-time postgraduate degree in any subject available at the University of Cambridge.\n\nThe programme aims to build a global network of future leaders committed to improving the lives of others. Students interested in the Gates-Cambridge Scholarship for fall 2024 admission must submit an application to the University of Cambridge by the specified deadline.\n\nHHMI Gilliam Fellowship for Advanced Study\n\nThe goal of the Gilliam Fellowships for Advanced Study program is to ensure the development of a diverse and highly trained workforce is available to assume leadership roles in science, including college and university faculty, who have the responsibility to teach the next generation of scientists. Students are chosen for their academic excellence, scientific potential, and commitment to the advancement of diversity and inclusion in the sciences.\n\nPlease note: Candidates for the Gilliam Fellowship must first be nominated.\n\nMarshall Scholarship\n\nAs future leaders, with a lasting understanding of British society, Marshall Scholars strengthen the enduring relationship between the British and American peoples, their governments and their institutions. Marshall Scholars are talented, independent and wide-ranging, and their time as Scholars enhances their intellectual and personal growth. Their direct engagement with Britain through its best academic programmes contributes to their ultimate personal success.\n\nNuffield Department of Medicine (NDM) Prize Studentship\n\nThe four-year University of Oxford NDM Prize Studentships are principal fully-funded awards and are open to outstanding candidates from any country without restriction. The departmental Prize Studentships are awarded for DPhil (PhD) students starting at the beginning of the academic year in October.\n\nAll candidates who apply to the DPhil in Clinical Medicine for 2024 entry by 1 December 2023 will automatically be considered for the NDM Prize Studentships. The candidate's academic and research potential are the only criteria on which these awards are judged.\n\nRhodes Scholarship"
