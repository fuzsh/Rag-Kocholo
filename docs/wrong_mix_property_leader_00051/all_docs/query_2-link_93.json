        "text": "South African soccer coach Pitso Mosimane has been a pioneer for much of his career. His contribution to South African soccer was recognised when he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Johannesburg.\n\nThe younger generation, though, does have its stress points when it comes to securing a financial future.\n\nEquities in Asia declined as investors began pulling back on the artificial-intelligence frenzy that has powered the bull market this year. The yen rose for a fourth day ahead of next week’s Bank of Japan meeting.\n\nDuring a Daily Maverick webinar, experts explain how they’re conducting one of the largest rewilding projects in Africa and how the data collected can advance rhino conservation globally.\n\nRand Water’s 37-day maintenance project, scheduled to end on 29 July, has caused extended water outages in Gauteng. The bulk water entity says it’s on schedule, but warns that full system recovery may take up to two weeks.\n\nPrawn farmers have been among the hottest stock trades in India this week after the government announced proposals to help local aquaculture firms capture a bigger share of a growing global market.\n\nAfricans are feeling rejected both on the continent and abroad, where more than 30% of applications to the Schengen region are rejected. South Africa languishes in 47th position.\n\nTshifhiwa Matodzi, head honcho of VBS bank, went one better than Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid and Gayton McKenzie. He knew that it was better to start a bank than to rob one. The EFF and the SACP went one better than starting a bank – they secured “donations” from VBS.\n\nHealth legislation that would require doctors and health practitioners to obtain a ‘certificate of need’ before being allowed to practise in a particular area has been declared unconstitutional by the high court. The requirement has been described as a cornerstone of the proposed National Health Insurance."
