But the electoral body says he didn't win a simple majority and must face Mugabe in a run-off. Tsvangirai pulls out of the run-off due to alleged intimidation and Mugabe wins the presidency. Tsvangirai and Mugabe sign a power sharing agreement but it stalls.\n\n2009: Tsvangirai is sworn in as prime minister.\n\n2013: Mugabe again wins the presidential elections, rejected as fraudulent by the MDC.
