Cecil Rhodes was born in Bishop Stortford, Hertfordshire in 1853. He was the son of a vicar.

Rhodes left England in 1870 for South Africa to work on his brother's cotton farm. Though he later moved into the diamond business - co-founding De Beers - which at one stage controlled more than 90 per cent of the world's supply.

The tycoon had wanted to build a railway from Cairo to Cape Town in order to colonise much of the continent of Africa.

He even had plans to bring the United States back under Crown control.

It wasn't until the 1880s that he attended Oriel College, Oxford, which he left a substantial fund upon his death in 1902.

He was supported by Queen Victoria in expanding British territory in southern Africa, colonising Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia - now Zambia and Zimbabwe.

He once claimed: 'Why should we not form a secret society with but one object, the furtherance of the British Empire and the bringing of the whole world under British rule, for the recovery of the United States, for making the Anglo-Saxon race but one Empire?'

He was the Prime Minister of Cape Colony - now South Africa - between 1890 and 1896 and is credited with creating the conditions for the second Boer War.

In 1895, Rhodes sent British troops into Transvaal, which was an independent Republic, in order to overthrow it's prime minister Paul Kruger and seize the area's gold mines.

The Jameson Raid failed miserably.

The battle over gold rights in the region led to war in 1899, which lasted for more than three years.

British troops operated a scorched earth policy, burning farms and placing women and children into concentration camps where thousands died.

Some 500,000 troops - including soldiers from Australia, New Zealand and Canada - were involved in the conflict.

The conflict claimed the lives of 25,000 Afrikaners - many of them in concentration camps.

Some 22,000 British troops as well as a further 12,000 Africans died in the conflict.
