        "text": "The Los Angeles rap group Cypress Hill proudly unveiled a prop during its set on Wednesday night at Roseland. A pair of fingers, thick as tree trunks, held a glowing, smoking, four-foot joint; hanging above, on a wall, was an enlarged marijuana leaf. With songs like \"I Wanna Get High\" (including the line, \"Tell Bill Clinton to go inhale\") and \"Hits From the Bong,\" Cypress Hill has made itself a virtual spokesgroup for the pleasures of marijuana. Before the rappers performed, a representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws addressed the audience.\n\nThose who thought marijuana promoted introspection and whimsy could find those qualities in Cypress Hill's music, with its rotund midtempo bass lines, lightly abrasive sound effects and the nasal, singsong vocals of its main rapper, B-Real (Louis Freese). But the lyrics tell another story; when Cypress Hill isn't toking up, it's talking about gunplay, with blithe choruses like \"Cock the hammer, it's time for action.\"\n\n\"Hand on the Pump\" and \"How I Could Just Kill a Man\" (a careful justification for killing in self-defense) were the most popular songs on the group's debut album, \"Cypress Hill.\" So it brought the same subject matter to its new album, \"Black Sunday\" (both disks on Ruffhouse/Columbia), which entered the Billboard album chart at No. 1 and remains in the Top 10.\n\nCypress Hill's fictional universe offers a pitched battle between the trigger-happy group and everyone else; now, in \"Hand on the Glock,\" \"self-defense turns to the offense.\" Talking about a curbside disagreement in \"Ain't Goin' Out Like That,\" B-Real vows, \"I'll huff and puff and blow your head off.\" It's gangster rap veiled in reefer smoke and treated with all the gravity of a cartoon. At one point, B-Real describes himself as \"comin' out blasting like Yosemite Sam.\""
