But this one moreso, and the article may contain incomplete information and editor's notes.\n\nThis page is rather stubbly and could use some expansion.\n\nAre you a bad enough dude to\n\nScarface: The World Is Yours is an open-world GTA-style game that ignores the ending of the 1983 movie and focuses on Tony Montana rebuilding his empire.\n\nPush it to the limit!\n\nTo do:\n\nThis page will need to be heavily reworked.\n\nUpload the actual corresponding audio files as opposed to footage.\n\nThere's a LOT of cut content to be added.\n\nCreate a prototype page.\n\nCreate a development page. TONS of groundbreaking development info on the game from as early as 2003 was shared on the Mafia Games Discord courtesy of former designers from Radical Entertainment along with in-house assets.\n\nSub-Page\n\nPrerelease Info\n\nUnused Sounds\n\nMany characters from the film were planned to return in the game and play major roles in its story, only to be scrapped for various reasons.\n\nMama Montana\n\nElvira Montana\n\nTony's wife is referenced many times when he performs taunts, during phone calls, and when he dies in action. She was replaced by Venus, who serves as Tony's love interest in the game, due to Radical being unable to get Michelle Pfeiffer's likeness."
