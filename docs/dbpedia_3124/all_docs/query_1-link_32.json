The game is based on and is a quasi-sequel to the 1983 motion picture Scarface with AndrÃ© Sogliuzzo providing Montana's voice. It was released on the PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox on October 8, 2006, and on the Wii on June 12, 2007. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game were officially cancelled.\n\nContents\n\n1 Lifestyle\n\n1.1 Plot\n\n2 Game details\n\n3 Development and history\n\n4 Reception\n\n5 Characters\n\n6 Soundtrack\n\n7 See also\n\n8 References\n\n9 External links\n\n[edit] Lifestyle\n\nScarface: The World is Yours has customization abilities and this can be done in various ways: changing outfits, buying cars, customizing the mansion through themes and also replacing the mansion with exotics, furniture, girls and other rare items (which, through a glitch in the game, always eventually disappear and have to be re bought, except for the Unique Collectibles items that can only be bought once).\n\n[edit] Plot\n\nThe Game begins in the last scene of the original movie. The cutscene begins with Tony being attacked by the assassins who killed him in the movie, then the player takes control of Tony. Tony then kills all the assassins, and with the help of his last surviving men which inform him that the cops have arrived and raided the mansion, escapes through an underground passage and leaves to an undisclosed location, while recovering he reminisces of the mistakes he has made and also admits he has a cocaine addiction, he stops cold turkey and vows to get revenge on Sosa. With his drug empire in shambles and his assets seized by the police, he must start from the bottom once again to gain his empire and get his revenge on Sosa. The game takes you through events that help you rebuild your empire. Kill many of Tony's competitors, and finally raid the mansion of Sosa and kill him. You make contacts, friends, and set up accounts with banks to \"clean\" your money, though this takes a percentage of it depending on how far you are in the game and how good your negotiation skills are. Early on you buy your mansion back from the miami vice and can customize it greatly. You buy and deal your own cocaine using a minigame with which you try to get more cocaine for less money, and sell a gram of cocaine for more money, novice players will end up losing money by buying expensive and selling cheap. The banks are used as the way to save money, after washing your money, the game allows you to save the game. Tony makes friends with other drug dealers like Felix, who sets him up with many deals against dealers, you buy your own cocaine from the drug smugglers, and you sell it to the drug dealers, making you the middle man. You gain fronts by doing missions for the owners of the shops and you can later on sell the cocaine to the owners for a profit that depends on how high the demand for cocaine from that area is. Tony's \"balls\" rage is the equivalent of his overdosing on cocaine, but since he cleaned up, he no longer does cocaine. Eventually you make a powerful drug Empire, take down Sosa, and finally, the world, and everything in it, is yours.\n\n[edit] Game details\n\nIt was originally developed exclusively for the Playstation 2 but ended up being ported for the Xbox, PC, and Wii.\n\nMembers of the original movie, leant their voices to the game. Robert Loggia (Frank Lopez), Steven Bauer (Manny Rivera) & Al Israel (Hector the Toad), all contributed.\n\n[edit] Development and history\n\nAccording to Game Informer and Vivendi Universal, Scarface: The World Is Yours sold over a million copies in North America, Europe, and Australia. The commercial for the game featured the MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e song \"Kickstart My Heart\", although the song was not in the game. However, the band's drummer, Tommy Lee, played the role of the manager of Fidel's Records and Tapes\n\n[edit] Reception\n\nThe game has received largely favorable reviews. At the time of writing, only eight of the twenty-nine reviews cited by Metacritic for the Xbox version of the game have given the game a score lower than 75%, with most reviews lying in the 80â90% range (IGN gave it a review of 8.7/10, making it an Editor's Choice game, and Game Informer awarded it 85%). However, a small number of reviews have been less favorable, with GameSpot only giving it 6.6 out of 10 and the G4 TV show X-Play giving it a 3 out of 5, and OXM giving it only 4.5/10. The PS2 reviews have been very similar to those of the Xbox, with the 80-90% range dominating but several notable sources voicing dissent. The PC version had been released with several bugs, especially in controls and map loading systems, thus giving the game mixed reviews, but with a similarly respectable average score of around 72-75% in Metacritic and GameRankings. Gamespot gave the Wii version 5.8 for what they thought was a poor control method, while IGN gave it an 8.5, praising the new controls and saying that it was the best version of the game available, scored slightly lower only due to its late release and nature as a last-gen port.\n\nThe game has sold over 2.5 million copies since launch.[1]\n\n[edit] Characters\n\nTony Montana - The main character of the game and film. Montana survived the raid on his mansion and seeks revenge against Sosa for the rest of the game.\n\nAlejandro Sosa - The main antagonist of the game. In the film, he was portrayed by Paul Shenar. Sosa is a ruthless Bolivian drug lord, but earned the wrath of Montana by ordering an assassination team to kill him in his mansion.\n\nAlfonso and Edgar Diaz - The infamous Diaz Brothers in charge of drug distribution in Miami. They are brutally slaughtered by a vengeful Montana after killing his mother.\n\nGaspar Gomez - A drug baron who controls North and South Beach cocaine distribution. He also teams with Sosa against Tony Montana and often calls Tony on the SAT Phone he had stolen from his penthouse. Gaspar was seen in the film after Tony confronted Gina in the bathroom. Gaspar, played by Robert Vandenberg was seen standing outside the door, spurring Tony to ask Gaspar and his bodyguard, along with many others \"What the fuck you want, you want something?!\", pushing them away.\n\n[edit] Soundtrack\n\n1 20/20 - Yellow Pills\n\n2 Afrika Bambaataa - Don't Stopâ¦Planet Rock\n\n3 Afrika Bambaataa - Looking For The Perfect Beat\n\n4 Amy Holland - She's On Fire\n\n5 Beth Anderson - Dance Dance Dance\n\n6 Bif Naked - All I Want\n\n7 Billy Ocean - Caribbean Queen\n\n8 Black Uhuru - Darkness\n\n9 Black Uhuru - Guess Who's Coming To Dinner\n\n10 Black Uhuru - Happiness\n\n11 Bobby ValentÃ­n - El Caiman\n\n12 B-Real feat.
