        "text": "Raj Singh Mrs. Mccormick Film Class 12 February 2012 Scarface Analysis Essay The gangster movie genre is one of the most popular among the modern movies and some of the best film directors have produced some very excellent gangster movies. For my first film analysis, I decided to analyze my favorite gangster movie of all time. The movie that I analyzed is called “Scarface” and is directed by Brian De Palma. It was released in 1983 and is still a super hit movie today. Let me go through\n\nScarface: The Shame of a Nation (Hawks, 1932) According to film theorist Thomas Schatz, “a genre approach (to film) provides the most effective means for understanding, analyzing, and appreciating the Hollywood cinema (Schatz vii).” His approach to film is strongly supported by theorist Edward Branigan’s and the narrative representation of character interaction (Branigan), and André Bazin’s arguments that the objective reality pressed against audience interpretation. Through the application of these\n\nThe Gangster film ‘Scarface’ (DePalma) is about the rise and eventual fall of Cuban immigrant, Tony Montana. Throughout the film the viewer witnesses how Tony Montana goes from a criminal in Cuba to a drug overlord in America. The average viewer cannot connect to the arc of Tony Montana. But, the average viewer can connect to what Tony Montana is working for, the American dream. Brain DePalma chooses purposefully to have a hyper-masculine, narcissistic, megalomaniac immigrant as the main character\n\nThe Gangster film ‘Scarface’ (De Palma) is about the rise and fall of Cuban refugee turned drug lord, Tony Montana. Throughout the film the viewer witnesses Tony Montana’s narrative arc. The viewer watches as Tony Montana begins his arc as a petty criminal escaping from Cuba and metamorphizes into a drug king pin in America. The average viewer cannot empathize with the narrative arc of Tony Montana. But, the average viewer can empathize with what Tony Montana is yearning for, the American dream.\n\nGod, a masterpiece tune created by fellow rapper, Scarface, is one of the most motivating and conscious rap songs one will ever hear. The verses draws depth by touching on subjects and issues that occur primarily in urban communities. Throughout the song, Scarface presents a fascinating viewpoint where he presents himself as\"God\" for a day and answers different appeals. This song was released in 2015 and was part of his album, Deeply Rooted, which for the most part got many positive reviews. It\n\nmark completely. Scarface 1932 and Scarface 1983 is a great example of the latter. Scarface 1932 was the first of its kind in many respects while Scarface 1983 fell short. While at the core of both of these films they are the same, there are a few small plot discrepancies, but the message of the rise and fall of a man is identical. Visually these films are nothing alike. Beyond the obvious use of color in the 1983 film, the lighting, spacing, and camera work are all different. Scarface 1932 was revolutionary\n\nGenre Study The film example that I have chosen for this gangster genre study is Brian De Palma’s Scarface (1983). Scarface written by Oliver Stone portrays the rise and violent fall a Cuban exile Antonio “Tony” Montana played by Al Pacino. He arrives in Miami, Florida initially working as a dishwasher and a hitman. The film portrays his rise through the organized crime ranks becoming cocaine drug kingpin. This was the first time that I had seen this film and found it extremely exciting entertaining\n\nadvanced cinematographic techniques of more recent films such as Road to Perdition (2002) and The Departed (2006). This paper will serve to analyze only two of these brilliant works, and will do so through a compare and contrast format. Howard Hawks’s Scarface: The Shame of the Nation (1932) focuses on gang warfare and police intervention during a power struggle for Prohibition-era Chicago. This pre-Hays Code gangster film\n\nThe Players in the Cocaine Game: An investigative look at the dealers, suppliers, and enforcers From the third world of many South American countries, to the third street projects in the inner-city, to the third floor of a downtown luxury loft, cocaine is prevalent and being used. The business of the coca leaf is a billion dollar a year industry, if not more. Our foreign counterparts are profiting in full off of the drug. Mexico, Peru, and Colombia are some of the countries in Central and South\n\nScarface is a 1983 American Gangster film because of the violence, drugs and story line of a drug lord, this film is categorized as a Gangster Film “the American Film Institute defines the gangster-film genre as centering on \"organized crime or maverick criminals in a twentieth-century setting\" (AFI, 2008).” (Goodykoontz, B., & Jacobs, C. P., 2014). Scarface is a true definition of what organized crime is and what a criminal stands for it is also a recreation of the original film from 1930’s directed"
