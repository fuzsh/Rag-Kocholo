        "text": "Film critic Glenn Kenny’s “The World is Yours: The Story of Scarface” succeeds in what any effort at film journalism or criticism should: it's entertaining and enlightening separate from the film being discussed.\n\nKenny’s recounting of the making and legacy of the 1983 Brian De Palma gangster film is deeply sourced with juicy interviews and a healthy dose of historical context to help explain why the film should matter all these years later.\n\nI was able to sit down over Zoom with Kenny to talk about his motivation to chronicle this particular piece of cinema, his approach to writing, and his affinity for Kansas City. The discussion is edited for clarity and space.\n\nOwen: So why \"Scarface\"? What drew you to this particular film?\n\nKenny: I’ve wanted to write a book about the film for over 20 years. But it seemed moderately logical after my last book (the also very entertaining “Made Men: The Story of ‘Goodfellas’”) and the fact it sold relatively well.\n\nMy first idea after “Made Men” was to focus on a rom-com, and I wanted to write a book about “Sleepless in Seattle.” But I found the research on that a bit tricky as some people did not want to participate and the ones that did seemed irritated with the experience. It did not feel celebratory.\n\nWhile my instinct was to do something counter-intuitive after “Made Men,” my advice is: if you write a successful book, don’t be counter-intuitive.\n\nOwen: Seems like De Palma and (screenwriter) Oliver Stone might be a bit tricky in terms of subjects.\n\nKenny: I had a good time researching this. De Palma was extremely cooperative as well as forthcoming and frank. Stone was very vivid. He also wrote a great book that included stories about “Scarface.” (Note: I reviewed the Stone memoir “Chasing the Light” in November 2020 and it is indeed a great book.) I wanted to interview Pacino, but he was tough to get to. I did get to see him do a Q & A. I talked to some people who thought Pacino would rather talk about playing Richard III rather than “some gangster.” But isn’t a gangster’s story very Shakespearean?\n\nOwen: How did you approach writing the book?\n\nKenny: I was young when I first watched “Scarface” and I was a movie fan rather than a critic. Now I am interested in its stature in the culture. Tony Montana is a reprehensible character that people have hung up on their dorm room wall. Hip-hop has embraced it. That’s an interesting story to tell in how that happened.\n\nIn terms of approach, there’s always a plan. But nothing goes according to plan, so it’s best to be accommodating. You can chase an interview and not get it, as what happened with Pacino. I worked hard to get Michelle Pfeiffer (who plays Elvira in the film) to talk. Steven Bauer (Tony’s right-hand man, Manny) was willing to talk initially but it was very hard to schedule. I would talk with him, develop follow-up questions, and then spend three months working on getting that additional interview.\n\nOwen: Why has \"Scarface\" endured? What has drawn those dorm-room kids and rappers to this story?\n\nKenny: With “Goodfellas,” there’s a transgressive lifestyle where people get away with things. People try to act within the law and ethics. But Henry Hill is just a foot solider.\n\nWith “Scarface,” the question is: what if you are the king? You see the brass ring as the Cocaine King of Miami. In that position, you either come out on top or you die. His journey is astonishing. Some people find that attractive; pushing life to the limit.\n\n“The World is Yours” is a slogan Montana sees at pivotal moments in the story. It’s an existential statement. To me, he gets to enjoy his position before his downfall comes.\n\nOwen: Do you need to watch the film to appreciate the book?\n\nKenny: It helps. I do break down the film scene by scene, and that’s designed to serve as a way of watching it alongside me. There’s an element of how history and entertainment are intertwined. Its humor is subterranean. It’s buoyant and operatic. It’s operatic and operas aren’t to all tastes.\n\nOwen: Since I follow you on Twitter (or X or whatever), I know you are married to a Kansas City native. I have to ask about what you like about that place.\n\nKenny: We love Kansas City. In 1985, I read Calvin Trillin’s book “American Fried,” where the writer says Arthur Bryant’s is the best restaurant in America. Not barbecue, food period. \"I gotta try this stuff,\" I said to myself. I meet my wife and I want to meet her family immediately just so I can go to Kansas City. Marriage has been kept alive by KC food. I am kidding!\n\nThe interview ended with our assessment that Q39 is really good barbecue that many people don’t know about. Check it out the next time you are in Kansas City. In the meantime, check out “The World is Yours.” It’s a great summer read if you are into movies.\n\nJames Owen is the Tribune’s film columnist.
