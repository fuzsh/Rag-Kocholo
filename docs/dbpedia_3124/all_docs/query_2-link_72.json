True Crime: New York City\n\nIf you enjoyed the open-world, sandbox gameplay of Bully, you'll find True Crime: New York City offers a similar sense of freedom and exploration. Both games immerse you in richly detailed environments where you can engage with various missions and side activities. While Bully has you navigating a school and its surroundings, True Crime: New York City plunges you into the gritty streets of Manhattan, giving you a vast urban playground to explore, complete with the hustle and bustle of a living city. The sense of immersion is strong in both titles, with realistic settings and a range of interactive elements that make the world feel alive and reactive to your actions.\n\nIn terms of character progression and storyline, both games offer robust narratives that keep you hooked. In Bully, you navigate the social hierarchy of a high school, dealing with bullies, teachers, and cliques as you rise through the ranks. By comparison, True Crime: New York City places you in the shoes of Marcus Reed, a former gangster turned NYPD officer navigating the complexities of law enforcement and crime in a sprawling city. The missions in True Crime offer a mix of main storyline tasks and engaging side quests that shape the outcome of the game, much like how in Bully, your actions influence the story and the way characters interact with you.\n\nTrue Crime: New York City is available on PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube, typically priced around $20 USD.\n\n5. Just Cause 2\n\nIn Just Cause 2, much like in Bully, you have the freedom to explore an expansive open world and engage in a variety of missions and activities. While Bully focuses on schoolyard antics and navigating the social hierarchy of a high school, Just Cause 2 lets you unleash your adventurous side on a larger scale, set in the fictional island nation of Panau. You’ll have a blast using creative and often chaotic methods to complete your objectives, much like how Bully allows you to handle tasks with a mix of strategy and mischief.\n\nAnother similarity between Just Cause 2 and Bully is the way both games encourage experimentation with their gameplay mechanics. In Bully, you had all sorts of gadgets and antics at your disposal, from slingshots to stink bombs. Just Cause 2 takes this idea to new heights, literally—using grappling hooks, parachutes, and an arsenal of weapons, allowing you to traverse the terrain and take out enemies in imaginative ways. Both games reward your creativity and keep you engaged with their unique blend of action and humor.\n\nJust Cause 2 is available on platforms such as PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, typically priced around $19.99 USD.\n\n4. Sunset Overdrive\n\nSunset Overdrive, much like Bully, immerses you in an open-world setting brimming with vibrant characters and humorous narrative elements. Both games thrive on their outrageous missions and creative combat systems, offering a level of freedom that makes exploring their worlds endlessly entertaining. In Sunset Overdrive, instead of running around a school, you zip through an apocalyptic city overrun by mutants, bouncing off rooftops and grinding on rails, making every moment action-packed and exhilarating.\n\nAdditionally, Sunset Overdrive captures that same sense of rebellious fun found in Bully. While Bully had you pulling pranks and rising through the ranks of high school cliques, Sunset Overdrive empowers you to craft insane weapons and customize your character as you battle hordes of enemies and take down larger-than-life bosses. The game's quirky side quests and over-the-top humor ensure that you'll experience the same engaging and unpredictable adventures that kept you glued to Bully.\n\nSunset Overdrive is available on Xbox One and PC, typically priced around $19.99 USD.\n\n3. Prototype\n\nIf you enjoyed the free-roaming, mission-based structure of Bully, you’ll find Prototype offers a similar experience but with a super-powered twist. Much like exploring the diverse settings of Bullworth Academy, in Prototype, you’ll have an entire city at your disposal: a dense urban landscape where you can run, climb, and leap from building to building. Just like in Bully, where you engage in various mini-games and activities, Prototype provides numerous side missions and challenges that keep the gameplay fresh and exciting as you delve deeper into the story.\n\nMoreover, Prototype's protagonist, Alex Mercer, has a compelling backstory and character progression akin to Jimmy Hopkins in Bully. Though their stories and settings are different, both games emphasize the importance of navigating through complex social hierarchies and picking up new abilities or weapons. Instead of upgrading your skillset with slingshots and skateboards, in Prototype, you’ll transform Alex’s body into lethal weapons, gaining amazing powers to combat enemies and unfold an engaging narrative filled with mystery and action.\n\nPrototype is available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, typically priced around $20 USD.\n\n2. The Simpsons: Hit & Run\n\nIf you enjoyed Bully, you'll likely appreciate The Simpsons: Hit & Run. Both games offer an open-world experience coupled with a rich, engaging storyline. In The Simpsons: Hit & Run, you get to explore Springfield in a way that's very similar to how you roamed Bullworth Academy and the surrounding town in Bully. Each mission in Hit & Run, much like in Bully, helps you uncover deeper layers of the narrative, blending humor with an immersive gameplay experience.\n\nAnother commonality is the variety of side quests and activities available. Hit & Run features plenty of mini-games, collectibles, and hidden surprises, similar to the extracurricular activities in Bully. This keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging as you switch between different types of missions. Both games also allow you to interact with an array of unique characters, which adds depth and personality to the game world. Plus, if you loved the mix of vehicular and on-foot missions in Bully, Hit & Run provides a seamless blend of both, accentuated by its signature Simpsons humor.\n\nThe Simpsons: Hit & Run is available on PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Microsoft Windows, typically priced around $10 to $20 USD.\n\n1. Saints Row 2\n\nIf you loved the open-world sandbox chaos of Bully, then Saints Row 2 will be right up your alley. Both games give you an expansive environment to explore, filled with a plethora of side activities and missions that keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. While Bully sets you in a schoolyard battling rivals and authority figures, Saints Row 2 drops you into the urban sprawl of Stilwater, where you'll rise through the ranks of gang life. The freedom to approach missions in a non-linear fashion and the presence of a wide array of mini-games and side activities like streaking, insurance fraud, and carjacking in Saints Row 2 can provide the same thrill and freedom that made Bully a classic.\n\nMoreover, just as Bully offered a balance between a compelling storyline and humorous undertones, Saints Row 2 blends gripping narratives with a distinctively cheeky and irreverent humor. You’ll find yourself engaged in missions that range from intense gang warfare to utterly ridiculous tasks, all punctuated by witty dialogue and memorable characters. Customization options abound as well; from your character’s appearance to your gang’s crib, you have extensive control over how your gameplay experience looks and feels, giving it that personalized touch that kept Bully engaging.\n\nSaints Row 2 is available on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC, typically priced around $19.99 USD.\n\nYou've reached the end!
