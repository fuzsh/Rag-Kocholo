        "text": "The tragic hero lies somewhere between the ordinary hero and the ordinary villain, and combines elements of both.[15] That is what makes him tragic and that is what produces the complexity of audience responses, so that some will root for him, some will root against him, and some will not know how to react. The tragic hero is a hero—he embodies some form of nobility or excellence; he does impressive things for which we can admire him; he is a somebody, not a nobody; he is the kind of person who stands up for something and makes a difference. In short, the tragic hero stands out from the ordinary run of human beings. But the reason this kind of hero is tragic is that, through an unfortunate set of circumstances, something goes wrong in his life, something gets out of kilter. He makes a mistake, he oversteps the normal bounds of human life, he pushes a principle too far, he overestimates himself, he dares to break a taboo. The results appall us. The tragic hero commits a crime; he violates a sacred bond, such as that of family or nation; he disregards ordinary moral considerations; he arrogates to himself the right to break the rules and laws that normally confine human beings and provide the foundation of peaceful social co-existence. With his transgressive actions, the tragic hero poses a threat to the very fabric of society. For that, he must be condemned and punished. And yet we do not react to the tragic hero the way that we do to the ordinary criminal. He has broken a taboo but we sense that he has not done so out of ordinary villainous motives. Even in his crimes, the tragic hero seems out-of-the-ordinary. Somehow the evil he does seems to be bound up with the qualities for which we originally admired him. What makes him a good man in our eyes in the first place somehow leads him to do something we cannot help regarding as evil. And yet we still sense something of the original goodness in him, and sympathize with him in his tragic fate. Showing that on some level he really does understand the character he created, Gilligan said of Walter White: “I love the idea of a good character, a good man, doing arguably bad things for a good reason.”[16]\n\nThat is the paradox that I believe Gilligan was groping for in his formulation of Mr. Chips turning into Scarface. But tragedy is not a matter of a good man simply turning into an evil man. Tragedy involves opposites somehow being joined in one and the same figure. What is so disturbing about tragedy is that it forces us to rethink the moral categories with which we conventionally view the world. This does not mean that tragedy produces moral relativism. The great tragedies like Oedipus tyrannos and King Lear do not teach us that there is no difference between good and evil. If anything, they re-enforce our sense that good and evil do exist. What tragedy teaches us is that it is not always as easy to separate good from evil as we would like to think, and that someone who is in some sense genuinely good can nevertheless end up doing something evil, even as he is pursuing a course of action that—however mistakenly as it turns out—he had reason to think of as good.\n\nBefore analyzing Walter White as a tragic hero, let us turn to a more familiar example of tragedy, Shakespeare’s Macbeth.[17] Many will justifiably balk at speaking of Walter White as any kind of hero, “tragic” or otherwise. After all, does he not do terrible things? He lets a young woman die before his eyes when he might have saved her life; he poisons a child; he participates in a robbery that results in the death of another child. The list of his crimes goes on and on, and indeed at the foundation of his new career, he is one of the worst kind of criminals—the manufacturer of a drug that ruins the lives of thousands of people and sometimes kills them. For many, these facts place Walter White beyond the pale—he is a monster, not a human being; people frequently refer to him as a sociopath. In the hopes of getting people to suspend their moral judgment for a moment and to reconsider their evaluation of Walter White, I want to remind them that we all know a famous figure in literature who is as criminal as Walter White and yet is generally accepted as a tragic hero—Shakespeare’s Macbeth. Shakespeare’s tragic heroes often commit criminal acts. Othello murders his innocent wife; Coriolanus betrays his country; Brutus assassinates his friend Julius Caesar; and so on. And yet Shakespeare creates sympathy for all these tragic heroes and we admire them even as we are deeply troubled by the results of their actions. But in Macbeth, Shakespeare really seems to be pushing the envelop and seeing how criminal he can make a character and still present him as a tragic hero.[18] If even the murderous Macbeth can be a tragic hero, we might consider whether Walter White can be regarded as one, too.\n\nMacbeth’s rap sheet rivals Walter White’s. He murders Duncan, the legitimate king of Scotland, while he is staying at Macbeth’s castle and should, under the law of hospitality, be protected, not assassinated. To divert guilt from himself, Macbeth frames two of Duncan’s servants for the murder and then kills them too. Macbeth goes on to order the murder of his friend and war comrade Banquo, and only by luck does Banquo’s son, Fleance, escape the ambush. Just like Walter White, Macbeth becomes inured to criminal acts as his story progresses. At first Macbeth carefully debates the issue of killing Duncan, just as Walt in 1/3 runs over the pros and cons of murdering the drug dealer Krazy-8. But murder comes easier and easier to Macbeth, just as it does to Walt, and eventually he goes on a killing spree. Macbeth has an innocent woman and her children killed when his forces assault Macduff’s castle. The bloodbath Macbeth unleashes is of Walter-White proportion: “I am in blood / Stepp’d in so far that, should I wade no more, / Returning were as tedious as go o’er” (3.4.135-37).[19] Ultimately Macbeth plunges the whole nation of Scotland into a brutal civil war, thus becoming a monster in the eyes of his people (5.8.25). They see him as a “butcher,” married to a “fiend-like queen” (5.9.35). In the end, the Scottish people do not regard him as a hero—they cut off his head and display it as a warning to would-be usurpers in the future.\n\nAnd yet this play is called Macbeth and the titular character is its hero. How can the murderous Macbeth be regarded as a hero? In fact, Macbeth is being celebrated as a hero at the beginning of the play for his triumphs on the battlefield. King Duncan calls him a “worthy gentleman” and “noble” (1.2.24, 67), and rewards him with a new title. Macbeth is glorified specifically for an act of the utmost brutality—cleaving a man in half and decapitating him (1.2.21-23). At the end of the play, he is condemned for his aggressive violence, but at the beginning he is praised for it.[20] The difference between the two situations is of course obvious. At the beginning, Macbeth is fighting on behalf of his legitimate king; it is an entirely different matter to kill that king and illegitimately usurp the throne in Scotland. The same act—killing someone—takes on a different meaning whether it is done legally or illegally. Actions that in wartime may be laudable may be condemned in peacetime.\n\nBut is the resolution of this paradox that simple? Scotland breeds Macbeth to be a fierce warrior and encourages his ferocity on the battlefield. Can the community turn around and legitimately condemn as murder in peacetime what it celebrated as “valor” in wartime (1.2.19)? It is easy to formulate the ideal we expect from the powerful; Shakespeare does so eloquently in Measure for Measure: “O, it is excellent / To have a giant’s strength, but it is tyrannous / To use it like a giant” (2.2.107-109). But it is not easy to live by this ideal in reality. In a number of his plays (Othello, Coriolanus, Richard III), Shakespeare dramatizes the problem of a soldier carrying over the aggressiveness he displays in wartime into peacetime, with disastrous results. Of course in any conventional legal or moral sense, Scotland is right to condemn the tyrant Macbeth. But does conventional morality always tell the whole story about human nature? Shakespeare seems to be going out of his way to reveal a double standard operating in Scotland. Warriors in battle are judged by a code different from the one that governs them in peacetime situations.\n\nMacbeth is a tragedy because it exposes a deep fault-line in our ethical standards, revealing a conflict between two different conceptions of the good (the prototypical tragic situation according to Hegel). At times we celebrate aggressive impulses and admire a man for his sheer strength and power, his ability to triumph in combat over others. The greatest monument to this attitude in our culture is Homer’s portrait of Achilles in The Iliad. At other times, we assert the need to tame aggressive impulses and we brand them as evil, as the most significant impediment to achieving social order. The greatest monument to this attitude in our culture is the portrait of Jesus in the New Testament, with his un-Achillean injunction to turn the other cheek. Macbeth turns on the opposition between these two ethics, one classical, the other Christian. This opposition is reflected in the very conception of what it is to be a man in the play.[21] Duncan’s heir Malcolm urges Macduff to let his anger at Macbeth’s murdering his wife and children motivate him to rise up against the tyrant, but Macduff hesitates to do so:\n\nMalcolm. Dispute it like a man.\n\nMacduff. I shall do so;\n\nBut I must also feel it as a man. (4.3.219-21)\n\nTwo very different conceptions of what it is to be a man clash in this exchange. One we associate with the pagan warriors of ancient Greece and Rome—the classical idea that a man must assert himself, fight for his reputation and his rights, take vengeance on those who wrong him, and prove his valor in the most direct means possible—overcoming his enemies in combat. All of this is summed up in Malcolm’s injunction: “Dispute it like a man.” But when Macduff says that he “must also feel it as a man,” he is referring, not to the aggressive side of human nature, but to the compassionate. Part of being a human being is to feel for others, and that kind of human warmth and sympathy works against wanting to crush opponents and see them grovel in the dust. Instead, we speak of turning the other cheek, an ethical position deeply rooted in the teachings of Christianity.\n\nTo portray a tragic conflict between pagan and Christian ethics, Shakespeare sets Macbeth at a special historical moment, when a pagan warrior community has been Christianized. The geography of the play reflects the fact that Scotland is at a crossroad. To the south lies the Christian kingdom of England, ruled by the saintly Edward the Confessor. To the north lies Norway, traditional land of the Vikings, from which, at the beginning of the play, pagan hordes are invading Scotland. Macbeth is caught between civilization and barbarism, Christianity and paganism. He is aware of how Scotland has been transformed—the “humane statute” of Christianity has “purg’d the gentle weal” (3.4.75). A fierce land of pagan warriors has been tamed by the new religion of peace. Part of Macbeth accepts this transformation, but part of him rebels against it and has contempt for the way Christianity has weakened Scotland’s warriors in its attempt to pacify his country. This contempt surfaces when he is trying to enlist two men to murder Banquo, who, he tells them, has thwarted their ambitions:\n\nDo you find\n\nYour patience so predominant in your nature\n\nThat you can let this go? Are you so gospell’d,\n\nTo pray for this good man and for his issue\n\nWhose heavy hand hath bow’d you to the grave,\n\nAnd beggar’d yours for ever? (3.1.85-90)\n\nMacbeth taunts the two men: have you been made so meek by Christianity that you will not take your just revenge on Banquo? To Macbeth’s challenge, the murderers reply simply: “We are men, my liege” (3.1.90), showing that they know that it is their manliness that has been called into question. In effect, they are saying: “We are men, not Christians.” They will embrace the old pagan conception of manliness—a man defines himself by standing up for his rights and aggressively defending them. No Christian turning the other cheek for them.\n\nShakespeare keeps showing that two conflicting ethical systems are abroad in the Scotland of Macbeth. People have fundamentally different conceptions of what “good” means. Lady Macduff is troubled by the fact that her moral goodness provides no defense in a world of savage warriors:\n\nI have done no harm. But I remember now\n\nI am in this earthly world--where to do harm\n\nIs often laudable, to do good sometime\n\nAccounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas,\n\nDo I put up that womanly defense,\n\nTo say I have done no harm? (4.2.74-79)\n\nLady Macduff articulates the Christian rejection of the warrior’s ethic. For pagan warriors, to inflict injury on opponents is a sign of strength and thus their idea of what is good; to turn the other cheek is a sign of weakness, and thus foolish and contemptible in their eyes; “weakness” is their definition of “bad.” For Christians, the opposite is true. Goodness is forbearance and meekness, while aggressive violence is the very definition of evil. Note that Lady Macduff thinks of her Christian morality as a form of womanliness, the opposite of the pagan conception of manliness as martial virtue.\n\nParadoxically, Lady Macbeth becomes the champion of this kind of manliness. She worries that her husband is too Christian to do what he has to do to become king; he “is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness” (1.5.17). Thus, as Macbeth later does with the murderers, Lady Macbeth challenges her husband’s manhood to his face, accusing him of being a “coward” if he does not seize the opportunity to kill Duncan: “Art thou afeard / To be the same in thine own act and valor / As thou art in desire?” (1.7.39-41). Used to being celebrated as a valiant warrior, Macbeth rejects her doubts about his manliness: “I dare do all that may become a man; / Who dares do more is none” (1.7.46-47). Lady Macbeth is relentless:\n\nWhen you durst do it, then you were a man;\n\nAnd to be more than what you were, you would\n\nBe so much more the man. (1.7.49-51)\n\nAs in the dialogue between Malcolm and Macduff, we see that the question: “What is it to be a man?” is at the heart of Macbeth, and two different answers—the pagan and the Christian—run throughout the play and are in tragic tension. Macbeth is tormented by doubts about his manliness. When Lady Macbeth ridicules his fear of Banquo’s ghost—“Are you a man?”, “What? quite unmann’d in folly?” (3.4.57, 72), Macbeth insists upon his manly courage: “What man dare, I dare” (3.4.98).\n\nMacbeth’s tragic dilemma is that he is torn between two conflicting ethics, and cannot be a pure pagan or a pure Christian. He is a great warrior and has been lionized for his implacable cruelty on the battlefield. His wife keeps insisting that he live up to the warrior’s code and display the courage of a true man, fighting for his status in Scotland. At the same time, Macbeth is aware of the teachings of Christianity and the appeal of the virtue of meekness. That is why he hesitates at first to kill Duncan:\n\nBesides, this Duncan\n\nHath borne his faculties so meek, hath been\n\nSo clear in his great office, that his virtues\n\nWill plead like angels, trumpet-tongu’d against\n\nThe deep damnation of his taking off;\n\nAnd pity, like a naked new-born babe,\n\nStriding the blast, or heaven’s cherubin hors’d\n\nUpon the sightless couriers of the air,\n\nShall blow the horrid deed in every eye,\n\nThat tears shall drown the wind. (1.7.16-25)\n\nMacbeth may be a fierce pagan warrior, but notice how richly articulated his Christian imagination is in this passage. His poetry shows that he appreciates the Christian virtues of meekness and pity; he can feel them in his blood. Tragically for him, Macbeth has a Christian soul in his pagan warrior’s body.\n\nMacbeth is a tragic figure because of this complexity in his character. He is tragically torn between antithetical conceptions of the good. He feels the pull of the pagan past, and the warrior virtues are celebrated in his country and held up to him as an ideal, above all by his wife, who questions his manhood if he does not pursue his ambition aggressively. At the same time, he feels the pull of Christianity, and the virtue of meekness is also held in high regard in his country. That is why, when he commits his crimes, he cannot do so with a good conscience. He is horrified by his own deeds, haunted before and after them by frightening images he himself produces of their criminality. Macbeth is not the simple “butcher” Malcolm accuses him of being. He is something far more complex, and that complexity maintains our sympathy for him and complicates our response to him, leaving us not knowing how to judge him. He does commit brutal crimes. But at first the Christian in him resists these deeds, and even when he plunges into a life of crime, he is haunted by what he has done. If Macbeth were not torn in opposite directions, his life would be much simpler. If he were fully a Christian, he would never commit the crimes he does. If he were fully a pagan, he would not be so tormented by his deeds and would proceed without hesitation. But the Macbeth Shakespeare creates is torn between two conceptions of what it is to be a man and that makes him a truly tragic figure.\n\nTRAGEDY VERSUS MELODRAMA\n\nIn real life, we feel it necessary to condemn people who become tyrants like Macbeth, and take sides against them. But in the fictional world of drama, we have the luxury of temporarily suspending moral judgment and trying to understand and appreciate the inner complexity of a tragic hero like Macbeth. Macbeth has many admirable qualities and is respected for them initially in Scotland. He is a brave warrior and at first serves as a much-needed bulwark against the threat of domestic rebels and foreign barbarians in his country. The life of a warrior has made cruelty come easy to him, but he is not simply cruel. His imagination keeps confronting him with powerful images of the horror of cruelty, and as the plot progresses, he comes to understand that his ambition has led him to ruin his life and destroy everything that he once valued. We never see him enjoy being a tyrant. Because he is in fact sensitive to moral considerations, he is punished for his crimes internally by his conscience long before he suffers external punishment. We may at first be tempted to think that he and his wife are the only villains in Scotland. Yet Shakespeare reveals, not a black-and-white polarity in Scotland, but a continuous spectrum from good to evil, embracing many shades of gray in between. Is Banquo simply a morally good man? In fact, Shakespeare shows that Banquo, much like Macbeth, is gripped by ambition, and he cannot help thinking about the predictions the witches made about his sons’ ending up as kings (3.1.3-10). Like Macbeth, Banquo has trouble sleeping (2.1.6-9). He becomes an accessory after the fact to the murder of Duncan. He fails to reveal what he knows about the witches’ prophecies, despite the fact that he suspects that Macbeth had a role in Duncan’s death (3.1.1-3). In a cat-and-mouse game with Macbeth, Banquo in effect makes a deal to keep quiet about what he knows in return for future aid from Macbeth for his own ambitions (2.1.20-29).\n\nMacduff also does not provide a purely good antithesis to Macbeth’s pure evil. In his eagerness to fight Macbeth, Macduff abandons his wife and children, with fatal results for them. His own wife accuses him of cruelty—“He wants the natural touch” (4.2.9)—and reproaches him for not caring about his own family. Macduff’s treatment of his wife and children arouses Malcolm’s suspicions. He worries about allying with a man who would betray his own family:\n\nWhy in that rawness left you wife and child,\n\nThose precious motives, those strong knots of love,\n\nWithout leave-taking? (4.3.26-28)\n\nShakespeare does not portray a Scotland in which Macbeth is the only cruel and ambitious male. The country is filled with them. From the beginning, rebellious thanes pose a serious threat to the meek Duncan’s rule. One gets the sense that if any other thane had received a prophecy that he would be king, he might have acted just as Macbeth did. At the end, Ross, one of the thanes who triumphs over Macbeth, enunciates the same conception of manliness that induced Macbeth to murder Duncan in the first place. Ross is telling Siward, one of the English generals, about the death of his son in battle:\n\nYour son, my lord, has paid a soldier’s debt.\n\nHe only liv’d but till he was a man,\n\nThe which no sooner had his prowess confirm’d\n\nIn the unshrinking station where he fought,\n\nBut like a man he died. (5.9.5-9)\n\nWhen Siward affirms the nobility of his son’s death and even calls him “God’s soldier” (5.9.13), we see that—contrary to being uniquely evil—Macbeth lives by the same manly ethic that prevails on both sides of the political conflict in Scotland.[22]\n\nMacbeth is a great tragedy—and not a melodrama—precisely because of the moral complexities and ambiguities it portrays. True tragedy does not provide us with simple moral lessons, such as “pride goes before a fall.” Unlike melodrama, which simply appeals to our conventional moral beliefs and reaffirms them, tragedy is unsettling; it disturbs us and unnerves us by revealing that our ordinary moral categories do not necessarily or adequately cover the full range of human possibilities. The fundamental tragic aspect of life that Shakespeare points to is the perplexing fact that all forms of human excellence are not compatible with each other. In particular, moral excellence may be in tension with other forms of excellence. Not all goods are moral goods.[23] Our moral categories are so important in our daily lives that we would like to think that they are universally and unequivocally applicable in all circumstances, that all judgments are moral judgments. But as reassuring as that belief may be, it is simply not true. When I seek out a plumber, I am not looking for a morally good plumber: I want someone to fix my sink. I would not want him to cheat me (at least not too much), but fundamentally I am concerned about his skill as a plumber. Similarly, aesthetic judgment is not the same as moral judgment. In evaluating a work of art, I invoke something other than moral categories, especially with regard to its formal properties. And from cases like Caravaggio and Richard Wagner, we know that a morally dubious person can create great works of art. In extreme cases, our moral judgment may ultimately override our aesthetic judgment, but they are still separate forms of judgment, which is why they can come into conflict with each other.\n\nUnderstandably, we do not like to think about the problematic character of the human condition that Shakespeare exposes in his tragedies. We keep making the same mistake over and over—we think that people we admire for entirely non-moral reasons—for example, our athletes and our entertainers—will be admirable in moral terms as well. But why should someone who happens to have a great voice be especially moral in his or her daily life? We say earnestly that our idols in sports and entertainment should provide good role models to our youth, and we should be thankful that they often live up to that responsibility. But sometimes people who become famous for non-moral reasons are corrupted by that very fame and start behaving immorally. Sometimes, as in the case of athletes, people are admired for traits—such as aggressiveness—that work against their behaving morally in their daily lives. The desire to have our heroes perfect in every respect—including morally—is an untragic view of life. It is premised on the questionable belief that all our values are perfectly compatible and never need to come into conflict with each other. Those who offer conventional moral interpretations of Shakespeare’s plays miss the point of tragedy, which is to show that our ordinary moral categories, as important as they may be, do not explain the whole of human life and may interfere with our understanding of other forms of human excellence.\n\nI realize that many will reject my interpretation of Macbeth, and others will say that, if it is correct, then so much the worse for Shakespeare. They will insist that no matter what Shakespeare may have thought, Macbeth is an evil man and nothing else, and certainly no kind of hero.[24] Our moral judgments are so important in our daily lives that it is difficult ever to suspend them, even if someone says: “It’s just a play; lighten up.” We are used to watching plays and applauding heroes and hissing villains. That is why melodrama is one of the most popular forms of entertainment and dominates television, while genuine tragedy is so rare. In daily life, we may have to take sides, but the unreality of drama (however realistic it may seem) allows us to look at both sides of an issue and give each its due. Shakespearean tragedy gives us a glimpse into the depths of characters and the ways that opposing values may clash in extraordinary individuals. Shakespeare’s tragic heroes are dangerous figures, not because they threaten us in real life but because they challenge some of our most cherished assumptions. In a curious way, tragic heroes are like our modern superheroes. In the safe space of the imagination, they get to act out our fantasies of behaving transgressively. They thus allow us to explore vicariously the darker realms of human possibility. That is why tragedy is cathartic. In the imaginary world of the theater, tragedy allows us to indulge and perhaps purge dangerous impulses that we normally have to suppress to live peacefully in everyday society. That is how tragedy can have a moral effect without being moralistic.\n\nI hope that these considerations can serve to open up fresh perspectives on Breaking Bad. Vince Gilligan is no William Shakespeare. I would be the first to grant that Macbeth is a greater work of art than Breaking Bad. But still, I believe that Gilligan and his team are dealing with genuinely tragic material in the series and probably have come as close to Shakespeare’s level as any show in television history. I want to turn now to analyzing Breaking Bad, bearing in mind what we have learned from Macbeth. At a minimum, I hope that we can come away from Macbeth with the understanding that we can be fascinated by the case of an ostensibly good character who goes on to commit evil. Even though we may lose our sympathy for him as he plunges deeper and deeper into a life of crime, we can still feel for his humanity, if only because we see how tormented he is by his own realization of the horror of what he has done. This is, I believe, a good characterization of our reaction to Macbeth and it is also a good characterization of our reaction to Walter White. Only on these grounds can we explain the fact that puzzled Vince Gilligan—that a substantial portion of his audience continued to sympathize with and even to root for his Scarface. As the history of great literature has repeatedly demonstrated, the most interesting characters are not necessarily—or perhaps even typically--the most moral.[25] What great writers can do is precisely to show us that—on closer inspection—people who commit evil deeds may not be the monsters we at first think they are.[26] There may be no more gripping spectacle than a character with great potential for good who nevertheless turns to evil, or in Gilligan’s terms, “breaks bad.” Like Macbeth, Walter White is caught between antithetical ways of life, which draw him in opposite directions. We will see several ways in which Macbeth can illuminate Breaking Bad. In particular, we will see that the issue of manliness, so central to Shakespeare’s play, resurfaces in Breaking Bad in a form we now call “masculinity,” and it is an equally if not more problematic force in the contemporary world.[27]\n\nPURSUING THE AMERICAN DREAM\n\nBreaking Bad is the story of a man who fails to achieve the American dream in two of the versions that we have been following in this book. He fails to create a happy home for himself and his family, and he fails in his entrepreneurial attempt to go into business for himself. When we meet him in the first episode, Walter White is slogging away at domestic life and might even seem to have achieved something of the American dream in one traditional sense. He is intelligent and well-educated, and works in the respectable if unglamorous profession of high school teaching.[28] He has a home in the suburbs with two cars and one child (with a second, we soon learn, on the way). He has a small circle of relatives and friends who care about him. Many would envy his circumstances. But the more we learn about Walt, even in just the first episode, we see that his apparent suburban happiness is an illusion. He eventually discovers that the foundation of his home is literally rotting away.\n\nAs for Walt’s job, it is a source of frustration for him, rather than of pride. Most of his students treat him with indifference and sometimes contempt. They do not appreciate his remarkable knowledge of chemistry. All they want to know from him is: “Is this going to be on the midterm?” (1/2). That is why Walt never comes close to Mr. Chips status. Like many people overqualified for their jobs, he takes his frustration out on his students, speaking to them condescendingly and sarcastically, and he repays their contempt for him with nasty comments on their papers and exams.[29] A particular source of Walt’s frustration is the fact that, because he is a high school teacher, he is not paid well, certainly not as well as his qualifications as a chemist would warrant (we learn in 2/3 that Walt makes $43,700 a year). To make ends meet, he is forced to take a second job even further below his dignity—in a car wash, where he is exposed to the humiliation of having to take guff from his crude boss and to behave obsequiously to some of his students, when they show up as customers and take advantage of the role reversal.\n\nCompounding Walt’s frustration is the additional fact that, as we gradually learn, he could have been a very rich man. The high tech company he co-founded has since gone public and reached a $2.16 billion capitalization. But for reasons that are never made fully clear in the series, Walt allowed himself to be bought out early in the history of Gray Matter Technology for a mere $5000.[30] Evidently Walt let personal feelings interfere with his business judgment and, in a fit of pique, he missed out on the biggest financial opportunity of his life. Walt tells Gretchen Schwartz in 2/6: “My hard work, my research—you and Elliott made millions off it.” It is not just the loss of money that bothers Walt. By his early exit from Gray Matter, he lost his chance to share in what has come to be one of the highest forms of glory in contemporary America—the new American dream is to become a star in the high-tech world. As Walt explains to a psychiatrist in 2/3: “I have watched all my colleagues and friends surpass me in every way imaginable.”[31]\n\nBreaking Bad thus exposes another fault line in the American dream. Financial success has always been one of its components, but the path to that success has been defined differently. Is it a matter of “a penny saved is a penny earned” or “strike it rich”? The standard middle-class vision of accumulating wealth gradually by means of hard work, steady saving, and prudent investment has always been at odds with the grander dream of making the one big killing in a business venture or hitting the jackpot in some form of gambling. Some of the most enduring images of the American dream have taken the form of quick paths to vast wealth—the California Gold Rush, the Wall Street bull market, or the dot-com boom in Silicon Valley. Some versions of the American dream focus on security and seek to avoid any form of risk-taking, while other versions embrace risk-taking as the only route to a big pay-off. Walt’s failure to succeed in business is never fully explained, but from what we see of his character, one element of it was probably a failure of nerve. He did not have enough faith in himself or his business plan, and settled for an early buyout, leaving Elliott and Gretchen Schwartz to take the risks and reap the rewards of true entrepreneurship. Both financial versions of the American dream escape Walt. He cannot use a middle-class job to make the money patiently that he needs to support his family. But when he gets his one chance to strike it rich in one heroic enterprise, he gets cold feet and misses the opportunity to join the ranks of high-tech billionaires.\n\nHaving failed in financial terms, Walt falls back on his family for fulfillment—but he still does not find it. He has a loving relationship with his son, Walt Jr., and it would be wrong to say that his son is a disappointment to him. But Walt Jr. is unfortunately afflicted with cerebral palsy and his physical limitations mean that the two do not get to share certain experiences that are usually thought of as basic to the father-son bond. Walt will never get to cheer on Walt, Jr., at an athletic event, for example. Walt’s relationship with his wife Skyler is also less than ideal. They love each other, but right from the beginning we sense a staleness in their marriage. They have settled into comfortable day-to-day routines, while all the passion, especially the sexual passion, seems to be drained from their lives. And we soon begin to wonder who wears the pants in the White household.[32] Skyler is a master of passive-aggressive behavior and knows how to manipulate Walt to get what she wants out of him.[33] She can be condescending to Walt, and generally does more to tear down his ego than to build it up. At one particularly bitter moment, Walt says to Skyler: “You never believed in me. You were never grateful for anything I did for this family” (5/14). Walt’s relatives, especially his brother-in-law Hank—a gruff DEA agent—also fail to treat him with the respect he thinks he deserves. A would-be alpha male, Hank is always calling Walt’s manhood into question.\n\nWalt’s comfortable though stultifying existence is shattered by a diagnosis of lung cancer. This development sparks the existential crisis that gets the plot rolling in Breaking Bad. Walt is forced to face the fact of his own mortality, which reveals to him the meaningless of the life he has been leading. Has he accomplished anything in his life? What will be his legacy? In particular, will he be able to leave any money to his family? Breaking Bad is solidly grounded in the financial plight of its hero. The show mirrors the difficult financial circumstances of the American middle class during the Obama years. The series is not making a political statement and certainly not a partisan statement. But it does a remarkable job of portraying how hollow the economic “recovery” after the 2008 financial crisis seemed to be to a large portion of the American population, who felt that they had lost all chances to achieve the American dream.[34] There are several references in the show to the weakness of the economy. In explaining in 2/6 why Elliott and Gretchen cannot help him financially, Walt tells Skyler: “The economy’s in the toilet, we all know that. All those big banks. Fannie Mae.” In 2/11, Skyler’s boss Ted says the same thing: “The economy’s in the toilet. China’s undercutting us at every turn.”\n\nMany of the economic problems that have emerged as political issues in recent years are evident in Breaking Bad. We see the development of an underclass that resorts to drugs out of the despair of poverty. We see the impact of globalization—specifically multinational corporations—on ordinary people’s lives. Something sinister that happens in Germany or the Czech Republic has an impact on what happens in Albuquerque. In the midst of all the depressing economic trends, high tech entrepreneurs like the owners of Gray Matter prosper beyond their wildest dreams, thus exacerbating the tensions between the haves and the have-nots and leaving Walt bitter about the economic system. Even the politically contentious issue of the Mexican border surfaces in Breaking Bad. Walt’s conflict with the Mexican drug cartel puts him in great danger, an extreme example of how various forms of foreign competition have been threatening the American worker.\n\nBut the issue that truly marks Breaking Bad as the signature television series of the Obama years is health insurance.[35] In retrospect, there is something supremely appropriate in the fact that a show that ran from 2008 to 2013 really put to the test the principle: “If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.” As the series opens, Walt is already having financial troubles paying Walt Jr.’s medical bills—hence his second job—and his cancer diagnosis is all the more troubling because his medical insurance will not cover the treatments he will need. Later in the series, Hank ends up in a wheelchair as a result of a gun battle, and he and his wife must fret over the fact that his government medical plan does not cover the kind of intensive physical therapy he wants (which may be the only way for him to walk again, at least quickly). It is remarkable how much of the drama in Breaking Bad turns on the quintessentially middle-class issue of the inadequacy of one’s health insurance. Marie speaks for early 21st-century America when she says in 5/3 of Hank: ‘’God knows where we’d be if we’d had to go through his health plan.” The only organization in the series that has excellent health insurance is Gray Matter (1/5), thereby exacerbating the gap between the 1% and the 99%.\n\nThus Walter White is initiated into a life of crime out of financial considerations. Afraid that he will leave his family bankrupted by his medical bills, he would like to find a way to cover his hospital expenses and also to bequeath his family a substantial sum that would make them comfortable for life, and, in particular, pay for Walt Jr.’s medical treatment and also for both his children’s educations. This initial obsession with the bottom line is very middle-class, not the sort of thing we associate with Scarface (who probably never worried about his medical coverage with the cocaine cartel). When Walt discovers the street value of crystal meth, he thinks that he has found a shortcut to accumulating large amounts of money. He can put his skills as a chemist to good use, synthesizing drugs to supply a lucrative market. Walt claims that he turns to crime for the sake of his family, to provide for his wife and children. His motives turn out to be much more complex, but in any overall judgment of his character, it is worth bearing in mind that, in the beginning, his motives were relatively innocent. He knows that what he will be doing is illegal, but he naively believes that he will be able to confine his activities to a laboratory, simply synthesizing chemicals just the way he does for his high school classes and leaving to other people the sordid and dangerous business of actually selling the drugs. Walt has no idea what drug dealing really involves and does not foresee the web of violent crime into which he is being drawn. It is fair to say that the Walter White of Season 1 has no idea that by Season 5 he will be involved in robbing a train and killing an innocent boy.\n\nIt is the genius of Breaking Bad that it comes up with a scenario that makes it plausible that a decent man like Walt would turn to meth manufacture, and we can sympathize with him because his family’s good seems at first to be his only motive. He has spent his whole life on the right side of the law, unacquainted with criminals; in 1/6 Hank tells him: “You wouldn’t know a criminal if he checked you for a hernia.” It is precisely Walt’s innocence, his unfamiliarity with crime, that makes him believe that he can dip into criminal activity and not have to change his way of life fundamentally. At first he believes that drug dealers can be dealt with rationally; he says of Jesse’s drug distributor: “He’s a business man; it would therefore seem to follow that he’s capable of acting out of mutual self-interest” (1/2). But events move swiftly in the criminal world, and Walt’s education in how different it is to be on the wrong side of the law begins almost immediately. Already in the first episode, he finds himself having to kill people to protect his own life. Because he is dealing with hardened criminals, Walt can frame his actions as self-defense, but it should be a clear sign to him that he has gone down the wrong path. He learns that actions have consequences, and that manufacturing crystal meth cannot be a mere sideline to supplement his income. At many points in the series, Walt tries to renounce his criminal activities, but for one reason or another—chiefly involving his fear and greed—he is drawn back in. He can say at many points that he is forced to commit crimes because he is dealing with criminals, but it was his choice to become involved in the criminal world in the first place. And as happens with Michael Corleone in the Godfather films, Walt’s excuse that he is doing everything for his family begins to wear thin, especially when it becomes clear that he is actually harming his family, rather than helping it.\n\nAs the series progresses, it becomes evident that Walt’s motives go well beyond the good of his family. He takes pride in his new job—he is determined to manufacture the finest crystal meth in the world. In 3/4 he insists: “I am not going to lend my name to an inferior product.” It is no mean feat to be able to produce crystal meth of almost 100% purity (99.1% according to Hank in 1/4), and knowledgeable people in the drug trade appreciate the quality of the product Walt synthesizes as Heisenberg, not to mention its beautiful blue color. If there were a Nobel Prize for synthesizing crystal meth, Walter White would be on a plane to Stockholm to collect it. He is convinced that all his life he has been wasting his talent on cheap demonstrations for bored high school students. Now he is finally accomplishing something. The purity of his meth makes it safer to use and also gives it a bigger kick.[36] In the great tradition of the American entrepreneur, Walt is offering the public a superior product, and he thus beats out all his competition and is rewarded in the marketplace. Many people try to equal Walt’s achievement as a chemist—Jesse, Gale, Todd, to name a few—but no one manages to do so. When he temporarily refuses to continue making meth, Saul Goodman says in 3/2: “Talent like that and he flushes it down the toilet. It’s like Michelangelo won’t paint.” Walt can truly say that he is the world’s greatest crystal meth manufacturer, and that gives him a kind of fulfillment that his career as a high school teacher never came close to equaling. As he says in 5/7: “Being the best at something is a very rare thing.”\n\n“I AM THE DANGER”\n\nWalt’s preeminence as an illegal drug manufacturer is surely a case where a human excellence is not a moral excellence. To its credit, unlike many movies and television shows, Breaking Bad does not glamorize the drug trade. In the story of Jesse Pinkman, Walt’s former student and sometime “lab assistant,” the show portrays the damage meth addiction can do to a decent young man, who once had a promising future. The episode called “Peekaboo” (2/6) with its grim and gruesome portrayal of a grotesque meth-head family, offers perhaps the most powerful anti-drug commercial ever created.[37] In contrast to what happens with cocaine use in De Palma’s Scarface, Breaking Bad never presents meth use as enjoyable. That is one of the many reasons why Walter White never really becomes Scarface. The typical gangster movie tells the story of its protagonist’s rise as well as his fall. We get to see Tony Montana at the top of his game, enjoying the fruits of his crimes, in orgies of sex and drugs.[38] Walt should be so lucky. His life as a criminal has a downward trajectory from the beginning. He is always working frantically and like a dog to meet his production quotas on time, and he never gets to take any pleasure from all the money he has earned. It becomes a literal burden to him when $11 million of it in cash ends up in a single barrel, which he must painstakingly roll across the desert, like the Sisyphus of the Southwest (5/14). Still, Walt does take pride in his work and finally has the satisfaction of being good at something, indeed the best. I would not say that we can unequivocally admire Heisenberg, but we can see why Walt cultivates his secret identity. His life was so devoid of accomplishment that we can understand why he seizes the opportunity to stand out in any way in the world.\n\nBut Walt’s motives for a life of crime go even deeper, to the point where he gradually learns to embrace his inner criminal. The Walter White we meet at the beginning of the series is a hopeless and hapless nobody. Although he is intellectually superior to almost anyone he meets, he lets everyone push him around—his wife, his brother-in-law, his boss at the car wash, his students. It is a sad spectacle and makes us sympathize with Walt. He deserves better. The fundamental problem is that Walt is a coward. He will not stand up for himself and his rights. It is more a mental form of cowardice than a physical. The setbacks he has suffered over the years have made him lose faith in himself and he is too ready to compromise, to make due with second- or third-best in life. He is just about the last person we would think is capable of succeeding as a criminal. If he cannot stand up to a car wash owner, how is he going to handle a vicious drug lord?\n\nAnd indeed Walt does seem at times grotesquely out of his element in the criminal world. He and Jesse come across as the Three Stooges Minus Curly in some of their early bumbling efforts to execute their nefarious schemes (see especially 1/7).[39] Confronted with killers like Krazy-8 and Tuco, Walt is understandably overwhelmed with fear. From our first impressions of him, it is hard to believe that he would survive even a few days in the world of Krazy-8 and Tuco, let alone be able to deal with a criminal mastermind like Gus Fring and the entire Mexican drug cartel. And yet for all Walt’s inadequacies, he eventually triumphs over his criminal opponents, including Gus, and he is able to keep the law enforcement officers out to get him at bay as well. It is partially Walt’s intelligence that allows him to outfox his enemies on both sides of the law. Once again one of his excellences comes to his aid, as he thinks up ingenious schemes to defeat or neutralize the people who threaten him. There is more to Walter White than we thought—more to Walter White than he himself thought. This seemingly pathetic pushover comes to surprise us with his resilience, resourcefulness, and sheer strength of character. He becomes a force to reckon with.[40] He not only outfoxes his opponents; he also outfaces them. Beginning as the mild-mannered Walter White, he becomes the implacable Heisenberg, who can transfix the most threatening criminals with an icy stare, not to mention a dash of fulminate of mercury.\n\nThis is Walt’s real “achievement” in Breaking Bad and the way he can be said to become a “hero.” I know that many would insist that this is the way that Walt becomes a villain, but there is one sense in which we can legitimately speak of Walt as a hero.[41] Once he becomes Heisenberg, he is no longer a coward. His transformation is about as magical as that of Clark Kent into Superman. A man who lets himself be bullied by the ordinary people around him learns to stand up to some genuinely dangerous criminals. He takes satisfaction in that. Walt’s original turn to crime was purely instrumental. He surely was not seeking out a criminal way of life; he was just looking for a way to make a lot of money quickly. If anything, he regarded having to deal with criminals as the downside of his newly chosen profession. But gradually Walt comes to enjoy life among hardened criminals for its own sake. He enjoys the challenge, the competition, the chance to prove himself against other men. He takes pride in outsmarting them and outmaneuvering them. Walt comes to relish the pure act of transgression, of breaking the law to demonstrate his superior status, to show that he is above the law. Walt has built up many frustrations with society over the years; it has not given him the rewards he deserves, and it has denied him the American dream. His life as a criminal allows him to strike back against the conventional world that has held him back for decades from making a name for himself.\n\nWalt’s cancer plays a crucial role in his transformation into a would-be superman. At the beginning of the story, he is not afraid of dying; he is simply not thinking about dying at all. That is why he is wasting his life; he has no sense of urgency about making something of himself. But when Walt thinks that he is going to die—and not just in some vague, far-off future, but on a fast-approaching date—he is energized to leave a legacy behind. The threat of death paradoxically brings him to life. Moreover, knowing that he may be about to die liberates him from many of his normal fears. If he risks his life, he is thinking that he does not have that much time to live anyway. As Walt says in 2/8: “I have spent my whole life frightened of things that could happen, might happen, might not happen. . . . Ever since my diagnosis, I sleep just fine. I came to realize that fear—that’s the worst of it, that’s the real enemy.”\n\nWalt takes pride in his skill as a drug manufacturer, but he takes even greater pride in becoming master in the dangerous world of the drug trade. He responds to the many challenges he faces and does not back down from a fight. All his conflicts are highly personal—mano a mano, as several of his bitterest enemies would say. His great moment of recognition comes in 4/6, when Skyler is worried about all the threats to his life. In perhaps the most famous lines in the series, Walt responds to Skyler’s concern: “You clearly don’t know who you’re talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger! A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think of me? No. I am the one who knocks!” This from a man who at the beginning of the series was afraid just to handle a gun, provoking Hank to say: “That’s why they have men.” Now instead of being the man who cowers in fear, Walt is the cause of fear in others.[42] Ultimately he proudly proclaims his superiority: “I’m the man who killed Gus Fring” (5/7).\n\n“I am the danger! . . . I am the one who knocks!”—that is the contemporary equivalent of the traditional tragic hero’s assertion of his greatness. Shakespeare’s tragic heroes often die with a moment of self-affirmation on their lips, as witness Coriolanus:\n\nIf you have writ your annals true, ’tis there\n\nThat like an eagle in a dove-cote, I\n\nFlutter’d your Volscians in Corioles.\n\nAlone I did it. (5.6.113-16)\n\nWalt has finally become a man in the sense of manliness we saw in Macbeth (“Dispute it like a man”). In the last episode (5/16), Walt is finally willing to admit that everything he did was not for the sake of his family but for himself, for his own ego. In another moment of tragic recognition, he confesses to Skyler to clear the air: “I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And I was . . . really—I was alive.”[43] The middle-class Walter White we see at the beginning of the series has to think of everything as instrumental. If he is manufacturing drugs, it must be to get money for his family. By the end of the series, Walt realizes that what he really wanted was to become a certain kind of man, a man who can stand tall in any company, a man who makes a difference. He was good at being a drug lord, and it made him for the first time feel alive. He has finally become the star of his story, no longer a bit player in his own life. When his family originally pressured Walt to seek treatment for his cancer in 1/5, he balked at having the decision made for him by others: “Sometimes I feel like I never actually make any of my own choices. . . . My entire life—it just seems I never . . . had a real say about any of it.” As Heisenberg, Walt finally takes charge of his life. He is no longer the passive man to whom things happen; he is the active man who makes things happen.[44]\n\nWalt comes to think of himself not in middle-class terms but on the model of great heroic figures out of the past. In the fifth season, he says to Jesse: “You asked me if I was in the meth business or the money business. Neither. I’m in the empire business.” The idea of Walter White as the Napoleon of crime may be a stretch, but he can plausibly compare himself to the contemporary emperors of finance, the high tech entrepreneurs of companies like Gray Matter. One of the reasons that Walt takes such satisfaction in his criminal career is that he looks upon himself as building a successful business. When he was young, he failed to take advantage of the entrepreneurial opportunity offered by Gray Matter. But as a drug kingpin, he hoped that he could rival Elliott Schwartz. Again, it is not so much the money that matters to Walt; it is what it represents. He pursues the American dream: owning his own business. Above all, he wants to be his own boss. He cannot stand having to work for someone else, including a drug lord like Gus.[45] In 4/6 he takes a special satisfaction in buying out the car wash he used to work at, and reversing roles with the humbled ex-owner Bogdan, who has to admit: “So you’re the boss now.” In 5/6, Walt says proudly to Skyler: “Finally we’re self-sufficient. And no one to answer to.” He thinks that he has achieved his goal. He glories in what he actually accomplishes—by dint of his skill and hard work, and triumphing over all his competitors, he builds a business empire whose revenue would justify a NASDAQ listing (4/6). His business is of course illegal, but, as we saw with the criminal empire of the Corleones, developing it still requires many of the virtues that lead to success in any business.[46] Using technical business terms like distribution, infrastructure, high margin product, and risk/reward ratio, Walt often sounds like a conventional businessman, for example, when he tells Jesse in 2/7: “We’re not charging enough. Corner the market, then raise the price. It’s simple economics.” Walt is a criminal but he is not a run-of-the-mill criminal, not a petty thief. He is Heisenberg and, as he shows in the episode “Say My Name” (5/7), that is a name to conjure with. Whatever else may be said for or against him, Walter White is impressive as a criminal, displaying several forms of human excellence that would redound to his credit in more conventional—and legal—endeavors.\n\nJUDGING A MAN BY THE COMPANY HE KEEPS\n\nIs Walter White a tragic hero? Someone who rejects this idea cannot simply point to the number of murders for which he is responsible. Hamlet—sweet, gentle Hamlet—is a tragic hero, and yet he is directly responsible for the deaths of Claudius (his uncle), Polonius (his almost father-in-law), Laertes (his almost brother-in-law), and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (his college classmates), and he is indirectly responsible for the deaths of Ophelia (his beloved) and Gertrude (his mother). Walt has more in common with Shakespeare’s tragic heroes than his murder record. Like them, Walt has many admirable qualities—his intelligence, his resourcefulness, his perseverance, his indefatigability, and his courage. He puts his virtues in the service of illegal and immoral causes, but that means that his evil deeds are bound up with his best qualities.[47] Contemplating his fate, we are confronted with the fundamental experience of tragedy—the sense of tragic waste, the disturbing insight that qualities we admire in people can be put to the wrong use. We want to say: “If only Walter White had put his virtues to good use!” In 4/5 Hank expresses just these sentiments with regard to Gale, when, finding him murdered, Hank thinks that he was Heisenberg: “He was a genius, plain and simple. If he had applied that big brain of his to something good, who knows how he could have helped humanity, or something like that? I mean, how many actual geniuses are there in this world? If he’d taken his life in a different direction, who knows?” Walt is so upset to hear Gale praised for what he himself accomplished that he tells Hank: “This genius of yours, maybe he’s still out there.” Hank was ready to close the case, and Walt might have been safe. But his pride overcomes his prudence (with the help of a little alcohol), and he goads Hank into continuing the search for Heisenberg. Walt values his reputation over his safety. His tragic fate is that only a diagnosis of cancer awakens him from his apathy, and a life of crime seems to him to be his only option for striking it rich quickly and obtaining the status he covets.\n\nIn evaluating Walt, we need to compare him to the other characters in the series. Breaking Bad does not offer us an ideal world, filled with good people, among whom Walter White stands out as the epitome of evil. By comparison with many of the criminals he associates with, Walt comes across as a halfway decent human being. If you are looking for a psychotic killer, try Tuco Salamanca, or for a sociopath, consider Gus Fring.[48] Walt does not relish killing people the way Tuco does, and he never displays the cold-bloodedness of Gus. To see murder treated as a calculated business decision, we have to look at the way Gus kills Victor in 4/1. There is a steeliness in Gus’s eyes at this moment that is truly chilling. People often say of sociopaths that one stares into their eyes and sees nothing—a total blank.[49] This is true of Gus, but it is not true of Walt. Many say that Walt’s worst moment comes when he watches Jesse’s girlfriend Jane die as she chokes on her own vomit during a heroin-induced stupor.[50] Just look at Walt’s eyes during this scene and try to maintain that he is a sociopath. Of all Bryan Cranston’s Emmy-award winning acting in Breaking Bad, perhaps his greatest accomplishment is what he does with just his eyes alone in this scene to convey a sense of the inner torment Walt is going through as he watches Jane die. In his autobiography, Cranston revealed that he forced himself to think of his own daughter during this scene in order to nail the depth of Walt’s feelings.[51] What Walt does in this scene is morally wrong, but he does not do it cold-bloodedly and without remorse; indeed this moment haunts him for the rest of his life, leading him, for example, to want to confess to Jesse what he did.\n\nIn several situations, Walt hesitates before murdering someone and he has second thoughts about many of the crimes he commits. Like Macbeth, Walt never fully embraces evil as his good; to the bitter end, he remains conscious of the distinction between good and evil. To be sure, he constantly comes up with explanations and excuses for the evil he does, but he would not feel the need to defend his actions if he were not aware that they appear to be morally wrong. True sociopaths do not show regret or remorse or offer excuses for their crimes; they just do them. Walt, by contrast, feels uncomfortable with many of the criminals he has to work with, and he is wracked by remorse. He could say along with Lady Macbeth: “Nought’s had, all’s spent, / Where our desire is got without content” (3.2.4-5) or along with Macbeth: “To know my deed, ’twere best not know myself” (2.2.70). It takes the poetry of Shakespeare to capture the despairing mood of Walter White in the frozen wilderness of New Hampshire in season 5:\n\nI have liv’d long enough: my way of life\n\nIs fall’n into the sear, the yellow leaf,\n\nAnd that which should accompany old age,\n\nAs honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,\n\nI must not look to have. (5.3.22-26)\n\nWith the words “tomorrow. . . tomorrow,” Breaking Bad actually quotes Macbeth in 5/15, calling attention to the most famous speech in the play, which could well serve as a motto for Walter White’s story:\n\nTo-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow\n\nCreeps in this petty pace from day to day,\n\nTo the last syllable of recorded time;\n\nAnd all our yesterdays have lighted fools\n\nThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!\n\nLife’s but a walking shadow, a poor player\n\nThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage\n\nAnd then is heard no more. It is a tale\n\nTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury\n\nSignifying nothing. (5.5.19-28)\n\nIt is a tribute to the quality of Breaking Bad and to the depth of Walter White as a character that it does not seem incongruous to quote these words of Macbeth in connection with him.[52]\n\nEven the supposedly virtuous characters in Breaking Bad are not so perfectly good that they make Walt look like evil incarnate. Walt can certainly be criticized for his actions, but so can many of the people he harms. Viewers and commentators become very sentimental about Jane Margolis, but she is after all a heroin addict and she seduces Jesse into trying heroin too. She has no compunctions about blackmailing Walt to get money to buy more drugs (2/12). For all of these failings, she does not deserve to die, but she is not exactly a paragon of virtue. Walt’s main antagonist among the “good guys” is Hank, and he if anybody should stand for law and order in the show. But Hank proves willing to break the law in pursuit of his personal goals and vendettas, and he himself admits that he was wrong to beat Jesse as savagely as he does in 3/7 (when he takes all his pent-up frustrations out on the young man). In 3/7 Hank says: “What I did to Pinkman—that’s not how I’m supposed to be, that’s not me.” And he admits further: “I’m not the man I thought I was.” Moreover, Hank is a braggart and a blowhard. It would be wrong to set him up as a pure hero as opposed to Walt as villain.[53] In many ways, Walt is a better human being than Hank.[54] At the beginning of the series, Hank puffs himself up as courageous in opposition to the cowardly Walt, but their roles are reversed as the story develops. When the would-be cowboy Hank gets a glimpse of the real Wild West in El Paso, he ends up with a bad case of PTSD. Walt starts out looking cowardly but turns out to be courageous; Hank starts out looking courageous but turns out to be cowardly.[55]\n\nOne of the common criticisms of Walt is that he becomes a liar. But just about everybody in Breaking Bad lies, almost routinely, including Hank. He will not admit that his assignment in El Paso scared the daylights out of him. His wife Marie is a pathological liar. Gus’s whole life is a lie, and, as we have seen, living a double life is epidemic in the series. The person who is most offended by Walt’s lies and by the double life he is leading is Skyler. But she lies as frequently as Walt does and literally becomes his partner in crime. Like Banquo, she shows that a seemingly innocent character may be tempted by the fruits of crime when confronted with the option. Skyler has an affair behind Walt’s back and becomes heavily involved in laundering the money he makes in the drug business. Her machinations almost get her boss Ted killed when she is trying to avoid having Walt’s criminal career exposed. As Shakespeare does in Macbeth, Gilligan and his team avoid a sharp polarity of good and evil characters in Breaking Bad. They could easily have stacked the deck against Walt by making characters such as Skyler and Hank more attractive than they are. As it is, the show presents us with a spectrum, in which very few characters are all the way over on the side of good, and most exist in the vast gray area between pure good and pure evil. Walt is not the most evil character in Breaking Bad. If he strikes us as a morally ambiguous figure, the reason is that he lives in a world rife with moral ambiguities.[56]\n\nIN QUEST OF A TRAGIC ENDING\n\nThe consequences of Walt’s decision to become Heisenberg are horrific—even for himself—but one can understand why he is tempted to make that choice. The original Walter White is a milquetoast, not much more of a man than the Hal of Malcolm in the Middle. In his all-around helplessness, he is pitiful and pathetic. He gets the idea of becoming a criminal when Hank takes him along on a drug bust with the injunction: “Get a little excitement in your life” (1/1). Walt desperately wants to be more of a man, even at the risk of exposing himself to high levels of danger. In that respect, the choice between the original Walter White and Walt/Heisenberg is a variant of the fundamental tragic choice. It goes all the way back to the Iliad and Achilles’s choice. He can live to an old age but only in ignoble obscurity or he can die young but achieve immortal fame for his noble actions. Walt’s cancer diagnosis in effect forces a modern variant of Achilles’s choice upon him. He can continue to eke out his safe life as a prudent, middle-class man, or he can choose to break out of this rut and make something of himself.[57] Tragic heroes do not do the safe thing. They take chances; they are daring; they do not follow the ordinary rules. In one way or the other, this is true of all of Shakespeare’s tragic heroes, from Romeo and Juliet to Antony and Cleopatra, from King Lear to Othello, from Macbeth to Coriolanus. If Romeo and Juliet were prudent, they would find partners more acceptable to their parents, enjoy a big wedding in Verona (though not to each other), collect the gifts, and settle down to a long, comfortable, and boring life as husband and wife. But then nobody would ever have heard of them. They would sink into the anonymity of all the happily married couples in Italy. Instead, Romeo and Juliet throw caution to the winds; they refuse to compromise with society’s demands; and they sacrifice their lives for each other, rather than accept a long-lasting but tepid love. Instead, they achieve everlasting glory as the noble archetype of two lovers. Their love burns brilliantly but briefly, as Juliet understands: “It is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden, / Too like the lightning, which does cease to be / Ere one can say it lightens” (2.2.118-20).\n\nWhat makes a character tragic is that he or she stands for something out of the ordinary, however imprudent that may be. Nietzsche’s “live dangerously” is the motto of tragedy.[58] Fortunately for the peace and survival of society, in real life most of us are unwilling to make such tragic choices. But tragedy appeals to us precisely because it allows us to experience vicariously and therefore safely what we cannot afford to do in our daily lives. Tragedy thereby expands our sense of human possibility, even as it reminds us why we ordinary people normally choose to live within a narrower range of practical options.\n\nFor most of his life, Walter White played by the rules, and look where it landed him. He accepted failure and wasted his potential. As Heisenberg, he finally tries to be somebody, and even though he ultimately fails in his goals—and chooses the wrong goals in the first place—at least he makes a name for himself and reveals his long hidden potential. He is defeated in the end, but he goes down fighting; he could say, along with Macbeth, “Blow wind, come wrack! / At least we’ll die with harness on our back” (5.5.50-51). That helps to explain why many viewers continued to side with Walter White and rooted for him to the end—not to succeed as a criminal but to die with dignity, like a tragic hero.[59]\n\nAnd Walter White does die with dignity—Gilligan and his team made sure of that. As the Breaking Bad episodes began to count down to the finale, I started to worry about how it would all end. It was clear that Walt was going to have to die but the question was: how? I could imagine several scenarios. Gilligan and his team could have had Walt go postal. He is compared to the Unabomber in the last episode (and looks like him). As a frustrated intellectual, Walt, like Ted Kaczynski, could have directed his hostility against the System at random targets or at society at large. He could have set off bombs in downtown Albuquerque (in fact he evokes that possibility as a way to keep the police preoccupied and off his trail).[60] As a terrorist, a Timothy McVeigh type, Walt would have left a truly tainted legacy. Or one can imagine an ending to the story in which Walt would have lost everything that mattered to him. Skyler, Walt Jr., and his little daughter Holly might have been killed in the crossfire of a gun battle with the police. That would have left Walt a complete and utter failure (perhaps to the satisfaction of some of his moral critics).\n\nWhat I feared most was a sentimental ending to Walt’s story. He would die, but before that he would be reconciled with Skyler and Walt, Jr., tearfully reunited with his family, confessing his crimes, and begging for—and receiving—their forgiveness. Walt would renounce Heisenberg and return to his inner nerd. For me, that would have meant that Walt re-embraced his mediocrity and repudiated everything that had made him heroic. All these endings were possible, and from what I know about the way Gilligan and his team work, I am sure that they considered all of these and more.[61] By what they chose to reject and what they chose to use as the ending of the series, they revealed what they really thought about the Walter White character. In the process, they crafted what I regard as the perfect conclusion to Breaking Bad and a truly tragic ending.[62]\n\nIn “Felina” (5-16), Walt’s violent impulses are still at work, but they are controlled and carefully targeted. He does not kill indiscriminately. In one of his clever technological schemes, he manages to take vengeance on the last of his enemies, gunning down the neo-Nazi gang with whom he got entangled (and who robbed him). In this case, his murders seem to be an act of justice.[63] He shows his decency by making sure to save Jesse’s life and pointing him the way to freedom. Although Walt is not reunited with his family, in an earlier episode (5/14) he found a clever way to clear Skyler of all criminal charges, and, drawing once again on his cunning, he comes up with a scheme to intimidate Elliott and Gretchen Schwartz so that he knows that they will deliver $9,720,000 to his children when they come of age (5/16). Some of his ill-gotten gains will go to the good of his family after all. As it turns out, in shooting his last enemies, Walt fatally wounds himself. Like several of Shakespeare’s tragic heroes, Walt in effect commits suicide. He does not have to suffer the humiliation of police arrest and a long trial in front of a hostile and uncomprehending public. He dies in the only place where he feels at home—in a chemical laboratory—and where he came closest to achieving fulfillment.[64]\n\nThis is not a happy ending to Walt’s story, but it is, I believe, a truly satisfying one. I breathed a sigh of relief as the last episode unfolded and I saw that Gilligan and his team had found a way for Walt to die that would not diminish him in our eyes, but that would in fact bring out some of his best qualities, including his resourcefulness and his genuine love for his family—and, above all, his willingness to take responsibility for all the harm he had done, just the way a tragic hero would.[65] I have faulted Vince Gilligan for analyzing his creation in terms of Mr. Chips and Scarface. Gilligan is not the best interpreter of his own work, perhaps because he does not have the concept of the tragic hero at his disposal.[66] But Gilligan the artist is far greater than Gilligan the commentator. As an author, Gilligan knows instinctively how to create a tragic hero and above all he proved that he knows how a tragic hero dies. Several great television series have disappointed us with their final episode (The Sopranos is a case in point). But “Felina” is one of the greatest of all Breaking Bad episodes. Nothing reveals the tragic status of a hero as much as his death does, and Walter White dies like a tragic hero. As with any tragic hero, Walt’s defeat is at the same time a triumph over his enemies and his own baser instincts and reminds us why we admire him.[67] In its portrayal of Walter White’s death, Breaking Bad maintains the Shakespearean level of its drama to the very end.[68]\n\nCRIPPLED MASCULINITY\n\nHaving done my best to make a case for Walter White as a tragic hero, I can understand why many people would feel dissatisfied with my argument. There still seems to be something wrong with treating Walter White as a hero, tragic or otherwise. He displays certain virtues, but they are in the service of illegal and immoral activities. Is there anything genuinely noble about what he does? His main goal is making money, and his triumphs, such as they are, come over low-life types—mainly other criminals. Aristotle insists that the tragic hero be well-born and his actions must have a “certain magnitude.”[69] His conception of tragedy is aristocratic in nature, and Shakespeare seems to fulfill the ancient Greek criteria by choosing only kings and queens, princes and princesses, great generals and people of high rank as his tragic figures. What happens to them affects a whole kingdom, or, in the case of Romeo and Juliet, an entire civic community. As for Macbeth, he begins the play fighting bravely and nobly for his country. Manliness seems more admirable when it takes the form of public spiritedness and serves the common good. The tragic hero devotes himself to a cause, but can it be just any cause and not specifically a noble one?\n\nThis is one reason why it has become more difficult to set genuine tragedies in the modern, democratic world, where people’s activities are generally confined to private life and lack the magnitude Aristotle expects of tragic action. Traditional forms of nobility are hard to find in a democracy, a form of government that fundamentally rejects the principle of aristocracy. Titles of nobility are in fact explicitly outlawed in the United States Constitution (Article 1, Section 9, Clause 8). Our American superheroes are democracy’s answer to the aristocratic heroes of the past, who, like Achilles, were born to nobility, if not semi-divinity. By contrast, the superhero is typically an ordinary person who acquires a superpower only by virtue of an accident that could have happened to anyone—a stray blast of nuclear radiation, for example. In accordance with democratic principles, the American superhero is elevated to heroic status, not by noble birth, but by something arbitrary—as if by lottery. That is why it is appropriate that Walter White/Heisenberg is a variant of the superhero myth. In a democracy, the heroic figure should be hidden in and spring out of an ordinary citizen.\n\nStill, that emergence takes time, and Walter White starts off small and cuts an unimpressive figure initially. He and Jesse begin as smalltime crooks, and in early episodes their behavior seems comic rather than tragic. Very little beyond the petty cash flow seems to be at stake in their initial drug deals. Breaking Bad does its best to elevate Walter White and give some gravitas to his story. He is of course not an aristocrat by birth, but he is a scientist, one of the new forms of aristocracy the modern world has produced (if you win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, you get to hobnob with Swedish royalty). As Walt’s drug trade expands, his activities take on a certain magnitude. He ceases to be a petty criminal and becomes a drug lord, a drug kingpin.[70] The metaphors we commonly use to describe drug dealers lend a certain aristocratic aura to their activities. When Walt’s meth manufacturing begins pulling in $80 million a year, we can start to talk of “serious money,” and, as we have seen, he speaks of himself as building an empire and compares himself to another form of aristocracy in the contemporary world—the high tech entrepreneur. As the plot progresses, Walt’s actions begin to have national and even international repercussions. By the fifth season, his story generates headlines in the national media. Does this allow us finally to speak of him as a tragic hero, the Macbeth of Meth?\n\nI confess that even I have my doubts about this and have trouble applying the word noble to Walter White. He is confined to a rather shabby world, with few if any outlets for what is traditionally viewed as heroism. Walt does not get to use his talents in the service of his country; he never thinks in terms of public service; he never goes to war, for example. The only form of war in Breaking Bad is the War on Drugs, and it is presented as a rather shabby business, with the DEA—especially Hank—disregarding the law, pursuing self-aggrandizing agendas, and often descending to the level of the criminals it is fighting. Can we really speak of any form of genuine nobility in Breaking Bad?\n\nThe absence of outlets for traditional heroism in the world of Breaking Bad may be the deepest theme of the series. If Walter White is heroic, his heroism seems to be twisted, bent out of shape, almost beyond the point of recognition. Breaking Bad is about the distorting and deforming of heroism in the contemporary world. The old heroic impulses are still present—the pride, the masculine aggressiveness, the drive to distinguish oneself, the overpowering urge to compete, especially against other males. But in the world Gilligan and his team have created, heroic impulses seem to go awry. They are unable to find healthy means of expressing themselves. In particular, what we discussed as the problem of manliness in Macbeth appears as the problem of masculinity in Breaking Bad, specifically what is now called “toxic masculinity.” In a world in which masculinity is widely regarded as toxic, it becomes difficult for masculinity to develop properly and find the right outlets. Indeed, at its core Breaking Bad is a story of crippled masculinity—a motif that provides one of the central and pervasive symbols in the series.[71]\n\nWalter White is crippled by his cancer. It lands him in a hospital bed and a debilitating regimen of chemotherapy. His loss of hair is symbolic of a loss of masculinity. He worries that as his disease progresses, he will become an object of pity to his family. Walt Jr. is crippled by cerebral palsy. In a misguided effort to protect his sense of his masculinity, Hank attributes Walt Jr.’s need for crutches to a football injury, and needlessly brags on his behalf: “He’s got an arm like a howitzer” (1/2). Hank only succeeds in reminding Walt, Jr. of what is missing from his teenage years, the chance to prove himself a man on an athletic field that most adolescent boys covet. For a good part of a season, Hank himself ends up crippled, in a wheelchair. Caught in a shootout with assassins from the Mexican cartel, Hank is paralyzed from the waist down, raising the dreaded specter of sexual impotence. Hank’s sense of himself as a man is undermined by his confinement to a wheelchair and his inability to take care of himself in daily tasks. His injury infantilizes him, as he allows his wife to nurse him and he retreats into the childish world of his mineralogy hobby. Finally, Breaking Bad is haunted by the ominous figure of Hector “Tío” Salamanca, a former drug lord crippled by a stroke and condemned to life in a wheelchair. Once a potent figure in the drug world, Don Hector is reduced to a shell of his former self and must watch impotently as Gus Fring destroys his family one by one. Only through the help of Walter White is Hector able to weaponize his wheelchair, turning his weakness into strength, and finally achieving his revenge on Gus, the opponent whose masculinity he questions by referring to him contemptuously as “chicken man.”\n\nThese pervasive images of crippled men in Breaking Bad are telling us something—the world of the series is not a healthy one for males. Masculinity is not allowed to develop properly and, even once developed, it tends to be deformed, prevented from full flourishing. We should sense that something is wrong when we realize that the most masculine men in Breaking Bad seem to be the criminals. We are troubled to see the traditional manly virtues perverted into criminal forms. Aggressive males like Tuco have hair-trigger responses to any threat or challenge to their authority, and they are likely to resort to violence at the slightest provocation. The Mexican and Mexican-American drug dealers are involved in an ongoing blood feud, which leads to mounting violence among men anxious to prove their masculinity. There is an ethnic dimension to this development in the show. With their origins south of the border, the drug dealers are generally portrayed as having what has traditionally been regarded as Latin tempers.[72] They are obsessed with appearing macho and are unwilling to back down from a fight.\n\nLike the mafia in the Godfather films, the Mexican drug cartel seems an atavism, a holdover from an earlier era, more primitive than modern America. The Mexicans are, for example, more religious than their American counterparts. Religion does not appear to be an important factor in the lives of Walter White and his family and friends. But the assassins who come up from Mexico to kill Walt first make a pilgrimage to a makeshift shrine to seek a blessing on their efforts in what seems like an archaic ceremony (3/1, 3/7). The Salamanca cousins seem to be a throwback to a more violent, less lawful past, when men settled their disputes on their own. They are displaced in genre. With their fancy boots, they seem to be stepping right out of an old-style Western and into a modern American suburb, where we would expect law and order to prevail. What might have been acceptable—and even heroic—on the legendary streets of Laredo seems both out-of-place and deeply threatening in a suburb of contemporary Albuquerque. The more archaic the characters in Breaking Bad seem and the more they embody traditional forms of masculinity, the more they seem dangerous and criminal. Masculinity is stigmatized as machismo in the series; it is presented as a force that is both foreign to and outdated in contemporary America.[73]\n\nBORDERLANDS\n\nBreaking Bad thus turns on the same kind of historical and geographic contrasts as do the Godfather films and Macbeth. Albuquerque is presented as a borderland, poised between civilization and barbarism, between the present and the past. All the John Ford cinematography in Breaking Bad gives a Western feel to the series.[74] The drug trade and its gang warfare, together with the War on Drugs, have returned New Mexico to the Wild West, complete with feuds, gunfights, and vigilante justice. Albuquerque appears to be poised perilously on the boundary of civilization, surrounded by a hostile nature that cares nothing for human life.[75] And the border between Mexico and the United States functions the way the border between Scotland and England does in Macbeth, dividing barbarism from civilization. Mexico is the home of vicious drug cartels, run by quasi-feudal lords, whose henchmen turn to bizarre religious rituals to carry out their criminal tasks. Albuquerque is the home of middle-class American suburban life, dotted with malls, car washes, law offices, and clinics.[76] El Paso is the place where these two worlds intersect, and going there is like a journey into the primitive past, into a Conradian heart of darkness. In 2/8 Hal says: “It’s like Apocalypse Now there. Colonel Kurtz holed up in his jungle.”\n\nLike Macbeth, Walt is positioned between two different worlds, which embody antithetical codes of conduct and which pull him in opposite directions. Walt comes from suburban America, where, as the story begins, he is leading a perfectly ordinary middle-class existence, absorbed in the typical bourgeois concerns of making a living and supporting his family—entirely legal and respectable activities, if a little dull. Through a strange sequence of events, Walt is suddenly exposed to a world of criminals who operate outside the law and make vast fortunes doing so. Walt is alternately attracted to and repelled by this criminal world. From this point on, he can never feel completely at home in either the middle-class world or the criminal. If he were simply loyal to his middle-class origins, Walt would not have embarked on a life of crime in the first place. If he could fully go over to the criminal world—if he truly became Scarface—Walt would become much crueler but his life would also become much simpler. If it were not for the persistence of his middle-class moral scruples, he would, for example, have no problem with having Jesse or Hank killed, thereby eliminating many of his difficulties. In 3/12 Gus Fring’s fixer, Mike Ehrmantraut, cautions Walt against half-measures. In fact, Walt’s divided nature means that he lives a life of half-measures. For all his involvement in the drug trade, Walt views the criminal world as something foreign to him, something to be held at arm’s length, never fully to be embraced.\n\nOnce again, it is important to stress that Walt never really becomes Scarface. He remains too middle-class for that. As much as he is drawn to a life of crime, Walt is never able to glory in it the way Scarface does (unlike, for example, the original Scarface, Al Capone, Walt never gets the prestige of being identified as Public Enemy #1). Walt is too cautious as a criminal ever to enjoy fully being one. Although Walt thrives on the danger of his criminal life, he comes across, like Hyman Roth in The Godfather II, as a curiously bourgeois gangster. He becomes obsessed with that most middle-class of concerns—security, and, as the witches say in Macbeth “security / Is mortals’ chiefest enemy” (3.5.32-33). If Walt were willing to live with the level of danger that is normally part of being a criminal, he would paradoxically be much more at ease. Instead, his perfectionism and his rational scientific worldview lead him to demand perfect security for himself. He wants to control all events and guarantee exactly the outcomes he desires. Ironically, Walt’s Heisenberg will not accept the Uncertainty Principle.[77] To eliminate all possible threats to his safety, he has to forestall attacks from everyone he deals with, and that forces him to initiate pre-emptive strikes against all potential enemies, a mission that leads him into an endless cycle of violence that comes back to haunt him and condemns him to a life of perpetual anxiety.[78]\n\nOne could sum up Walt’s problem by quoting Macbeth: “To be thus is nothing, / But to be safely thus” (3.1.47-48). Achilles would never put such an emphasis on his safety. He glories in his willingness to risk his life, and scorns any concern with mere survival. Macbeth originally shares Achilles’ form of heroism. At the beginning of the play, he is described as “disdaining Fortune” (1.2.17) and he is willing to take his chances on the battlefield, as any brave hero would. But the witches introduce Macbeth to the idea of a providential order, in which his success is foreordained and thus assured. With their riddling prophecies, they convince Macbeth that he is invincible and invulnerable. In his quest for absolute security, he believes that he must anticipate all threats and eliminate all possible opponents. He is thus drawn, like Walter White, into a sequence of murders that eventually rebounds upon him and destroys him. Like Walt, Macbeth can never leave well enough alone. He is seeking a form of perfect security that no human being can ever achieve.\n\nMacbeth is at heart a pagan warrior but one who paradoxically brings a Christian concern for the “eternal jewel” of his soul (3.1.67) to his criminal deeds, and thus he becomes even crueler in his attempt to control his fate. Similarly, when Walter White becomes a criminal, he brings along his middle-class concern for security and ends up trying to wipe all his enemies off the face of the earth. The ultimate toxic brew in Breaking Bad is a cocktail of middle-class anxiety mixed with would-be heroic criminal impulses. As in the Godfather films, the ethnic criminals in Breaking Bad come across as old-fashioned and out-of-place in contemporary middle-class America. But they are to some extent restrained by their antiquated sense of honor. They are destroyed in Breaking Bad by the forces of modernity—a new kind of criminal enterprise, bound up with and perhaps indistinguishable from multinational corporations like Madrigal. In some respects, Walt is more criminal than any of the Salamanca clan because he goes about his crimes with middle-class efficiency. In a world in which masculinity is viewed as alien and outmoded, all his aggressive impulses, which might have been channeled into noble activities, are diverted and distorted into crime.\n\nEven the traditional masculine ideal of professionalism gets perverted in Breaking Bad. Gus Fring and Mike Ehrmantraut are ruthless murderers, especially Gus, but, unlike the many bumbling characters in Breaking Bad (including at times Walt and Jesse), at least Gus and Mike can be counted on to get the job done.[79] In a world filled with slackers, especially among the younger generation, we are forced to have a certain admiration for the characters who are not always waiting around for a free lunch. Beginning with its portrait of an American high school, Breaking Bad develops a very negative view of today’s youth and its unjustified sense of entitlement. Characters like Jesse want to enjoy the American dream; they just do not want to have to do anything difficult to achieve it. Whatever else may be said against them, Gus and Mike do not think the world owes them a living. Mike is Gus’s “cleaner.”[80] If a crime scene needs to be scrubbed to baffle the police, Mike is Gus’s go-to-guy (also Saul Goodman’s). Gus’s professionalism is frightening. When he slits Victor’s throat, he acts as if it is just another day at the office for him; he finally tells the stunned bystanders: “Well, get back to work” (4/1). But one has to be impressed by his ability to keep his cool, even in the most difficult circumstances, culminating in his final moment, when, with half his face blown off by Walt’s bomb, he pauses to adjust his tie just before collapsing dead on the spot. Gus is evil, but the way he dresses, the way he maintains his calm demeanor, the way he never allows personal issues to cloud his business judgment—in all these respects, he is the epitome of professionalism.\n\nMike is a more attractive character than Gus, and in his own way even likable. In the Breaking Bad prequel, Better Call Saul, we hear more about Mike’s origins and back story and learn that he is a basically decent human being who has been drawn into the criminal world as a result of corruption in the Philadelphia police department and the death of his son.[81] Moreover, unlike Walt, Mike really is involved in crime for the sake of providing money for his family, in his case his widowed daughter and his granddaughter. Mike’s forthrightness and gruff honesty are admirable qualities, and make us sympathize with him. He is given an especially poignant death scene. It is very tempting to look at Mike Ehrmantraut and say: “This is a man.” He is at least the sort of person one knows one can rely on. It is part of the overall tragic effect of Breaking Bad that Mike, perhaps its most manly character, is drawn into the criminal world for want of a more suitable outlet for his masculine virtues.\n\nOne might think that masculinity would be portrayed more positively among the “good guys” in Breaking Bad, the DEA and other law enforcement officials. After all, their masculine virtues ought to be in the noble service of the law.[82] There is a kind of male camaraderie among Hank and his fellow DEA officers, and they do rally to each other’s aid in times of need. In that respect, they fit the standard pop culture model of cops on the buddy system. But in Breaking Bad, a dark side can be observed in the male bonding of its forces of law and order. The DEA officers in Albuquerque and even moreso those in El Paso behave like adolescent males in a pissing contest. They are highly competitive, and are always trying to outshine each other. They are visibly in contention for promotions, transfers, and other professional rewards. They tease and make fun of each other in ways that do not contribute to the success of their missions. In particular, they take delight in questioning each other’s masculinity. In a typical moment, Hanks says to his partner Steve: “I didn’t know you had balls” (5/10).\n\nHank is the worst of all the “good guys” in these respects. As we gradually learn, he is deeply insecure about his masculinity and overcompensates by constantly playing the glad-handing, “hail fellow well met” role. He is also continually bragging and showing off, both at home and at the office. He is the most obnoxious character in the series. His overconfidence and misplaced belief in his masculine virtues lead him to get in over his head in a dangerous border assignment in El Paso. When confronted with a spectacular example of the Mexican cartel’s brutality—the head of an informant named Tortuga appropriately mounted on a tortoise’s back—Hank shows his inexperience and weakness by promptly throwing up. The hardened DEA agents tease Hank mercilessly for his cowardice: “What’s the matter, Schrader? You act like you never saw a severed human head on a tortoise before?” (2/7). They are killed when it turns out that the giant turtle conceals a bomb, and that explosion shatters what remains of Hank’s self-confidence as a man. The agents of law and order in Breaking Bad mirror the criminals in the way that their masculinity puts them at odds with each other and at times interferes with their getting their job done properly.[83] Hank especially is a loose cannon, letting his personal feelings, above all, his professional frustrations, cloud his judgment as a law officer and lead him into highly unprofessional actions, such as beating up Jesse (3.7).\n\nHank’s position as a representative of the law is further compromised by his own flirtations with illegality. We learn in 1/7 that he likes to smoke Cuban cigars, which at the time were banned in the United States. Defending himself in a conversation with Walt, Hank explains (sounding very much like a drug addict): “Yeah, well, sometimes forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest.” This answer provokes Walt into raising the issue we saw explored in the Godfather films in Chapter Three—whether something is outlawed because it is objectively wrong, or regarded as wrong only because it is outlawed by the government. Walt obviously has a stake in this debate and presses the point: “What’s legal—what’s illegal. Cuban cigars, alcohol [pointing to the whiskey bottle]. You know if we were drinking this in 1930, you’d be breaking the law. Another year, you’d be okay. Huh, who knows what will be legal next year?” Hank wants to know if Walt has pot, cocaine, or heroin in mind, but he claims only to be making a general point: “I’m just saying it’s arbitrary.” As we saw in the Godfather films, the inconsistency with which governments ban various substances weakens their claim to be upholding anything other than their own arbitrary decrees.\n\nThe Godfather films have an easier time questioning the validity of Prohibition. Alcohol is widely consumed in the United States and accepted in polite society. Besides, by now, Prohibition is ancient history in America.[84] But the crystal meth epidemic is still making headlines today. The last thing Breaking Bad wanted to do was to mount a defense of the meth trade. Aside from the one moment when Gale offers his libertarian defense of his meth making activities, the show is generally quiet on the subject and does not suggest at all that meth-making is a victimless crime (indeed it makes a point of showing some of the victims). In fact, in 1/7 Hank thinks that the case of meth will clinch his argument against Walt’s claims about the arbitrariness of the government’s making certain substances illegal and not others: “Sometimes there is stuff that is legal that shouldn’t be. I mean friggin’ meth used to be legal. Used to sell it over every counter in every pharmacy in America. Thank God they came to their senses on that one, huh?” Most Americans would agree with Hank on this point, and yet he has raised an inconvenient fact: at one time meth was perfectly legal in the United States and widely prescribed by legitimate doctors.[85]\n\nThus even Breaking Bad raises some doubts about whether the government can claim the moral high ground when it comes to the meth issue. But the show never goes as far as the Godfather films in portraying government power in a negative light. There is no officer of the law in Breaking Bad who is as corrupt as Captain McCluskey in The Godfather I or a political figure as reprehensible as Senator Geary in The Godfather II. The forces of law and order in Breaking Bad may at times be incompetent or overzealous, or otherwise fail to measure up to the highest standards of professionalism. But generally the law officers are honest and devoted to duty. Yet Breaking Bad still does not feature a figure of the stature of Eliot Ness (even though Hank is treated like him by his colleagues in 2/3 after his successful drug bust). By the standards of a traditional TV cop show, Hank and his colleagues are not sterling representatives of their profession; they are not the Untouchables. Far from seeming noble, they often come across as petty, mainly concerned with stroking their own egos. They have a good deal of masculine aggressiveness, but they do not consistently and reliably channel it into noble forms of public service. The impression that something is wrong with masculinity in the world of Breaking Bad is not erased by the behavior of the representatives of the law.\n\nTHERAPEUTIC CULTURE AND THE DEATH OF TRAGEDY\n\nMasculinity thus repeatedly appears as toxic in Breaking Bad, and it would be hard to find an example when it takes a purely healthy form. There are several reasons why masculinity is not properly nourished in the world of Breaking Bad. Masculinity is traditionally developed in the family, where a man gets to be treated like a man, but only if he accepts a responsible role as a husband and a father and learns to moderate his aggressive impulses. The family does not appear in a good light in Breaking Bad. At its heart, the series chronicles the story of two failed marriages, Walt and Skyler, and Hank and Marie.[86] Hank’s frustration with needing Marie to take care of him when he is in a wheelchair is the response of a man who was never happy in the first place to become dependent on a woman in marriage. Marie’s unhappiness with having to put up with Hank’s male bravado and then with his sense of male inadequacy surfaces in her compulsive need to adopt fictional identities and to fantasize a better husband for herself (specifically a true hero, an astronaut).\n\nWalt and Skyler both suffer from a case of failed expectations in marriage. Flashbacks reveal that, when younger, they expected to do much better in life, especially in financial "
