        "text": "Legendary anti-hero Tony Montana is about to explode onto Wii in an all-action title boasting full-blown Hollywood production values and a control system designed to make the optimum use of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. Beginning with the shoot-out that ends the film, this time Tony survives the hail of bullets - but revenge is on his mind. It’s your job to rebuild his empire and dispense justice to the assorted low-lives who have stabbed him in the back. When Tony does things, he doesn't go in for half-measures.\n\nTake aim and let rip as the Wii Remote lets you target your enemies while you manoeuvre on-foot, in cars or speedboats with the Control Stick on the Nunchuk. The control system adds to the accessibility of the gameplay and delivers a total immersive experience. A huge cast of voice actors and a pumping 80s soundtrack bring the world of Tony Montana to life in all its chainsaw-swinging glory. And it wouldn’t be Scarface unless you got the chance to taunt your enemies in Tony’s inimitable style: the insults come thick and fast as Tony intimidates, threatens and invites his foes to say hello to his little friend. Here’s your chance to experience life at the top in Tony’s dangerous and dazzling world as never before.\n\nThink tactically and hire henchmen to take care of your dirty work\n\nIntense melee action uses a combination of Wii Remote and Nunchuk for enhanced control\n\nOpen-ended, non-linear gameplay means that you are free to explore the huge game world\n\nFeatures over 50 voice actors while more than 100 licenced music tracks give the game an authentic 80s feel\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nThis content is sold by Nintendo of Europe SE.
