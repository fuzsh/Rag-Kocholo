        "text": "A while ago, Capcom showcased in-game footage of the upcoming Resident Evil 4 Remake, and Naughty Dog revealed their development of a remake of the original Last of Us. This got my noggin thinkin’ about video game remakes, and what makes them exciting and anxiety inducing.\n\nNo entertainment medium is without the concept of a remake. Artists in the Movie, Music, Writing, and the Game Industries sometimes feel the need to redo their previous works with a modern twist. These include movies such as Psycho, Scarface, and The Thing, cover songs in the music industry, and of course, video game remakes of Call of Duty 4, Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes, and Halo. Some of these remakes turn out to be better than the source material it’s based on.\n\nBut seeing as I’m a video game blogger, I think it’d be interesting to discuss the purpose of remakes in the game industry.\n\nWhat is a Video Game Remake?\n\nI think it’d be wise to first define what I mean by “Remake” in terms of video games.\n\nA remake, is a game that aims to create a game from the ground up with an existing game being its base for design and mechanical design. This definition is the one I’ll be using for the purposes of this article. Examples of video game remakes include Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Remake, Resident Evil 1, 2, 3 and the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake, and the upcoming The Last of Us Part 1.\n\nThis is different from a “Remaster”, which instead serves to release old content compatible with modern machines, sometimes with updated graphics and framerate options. These remasters are built from the existing game’s source code, which can be taken from the development offices, or the games themselves can be reverse engineered to obtain them. Examples include the Silent Hill HD Collection, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, and The Wind Waker HD.\n\nGenerally speaking, a remake is more demanding in development, than that of a remaster. This is because the remaster usually doesn’t require any development of new assets or features.\n\nWhy are Video Game Remakes a thing?\n\nI could just “Money” and be done with it, but that’s not reaaaaallly the reason, as it would be far more cost efficient to do a remaster instead.\n\nThe optimistic reason is that the developers want to retell the story with their bettered skills and technology, to create the game as how they originally envisioned. Neil Druckmann of Naughty Dog used this reasoning when announcing the Last of Us Part 1.\n\nThe pessimistic reason is that it is much easier and less risky financially to develop a game based on an existing IP, than it is to develop a totally new game. This reasoning is also used when developing sequels to existing IPS, as opposed to developing a new IP.\n\nHow strict should Video Game Remakes adhere to its Source Material?\n\nTypically you may hear — especially from die hard fans — that remakes should mimic the source material to a T. On first glance this may seem to be the obvious path, but it’s more complicated than that.\n\nThe point of contention lies in what you believe the purpose of a remake is. If you were to say that remakes should be completely the same — mechannically and in story — with a more modern aesthetic, then the remake appears to be developed solely to “replace” the existing game. When people look back fondly to a game they played in the past, especially as a child, that specific game will forever be treasured and be likely unable to be replaced, even with all its flaws. Sometimes the flaws, whether it’d be janky animation, janky AI, and even janky controls is dear to those who experienced them all those years ago, kinda like a form of Wabi-Sabi (侘寂). So to remove all that can potentially leave the game, with a bit less personality for those people.\n\nFurthermore, it raises the ethical issue of whether it’s okay to “replace” the hard work of those who developed that base iteration, as having a strictly improved iteration of an existing game seems to diminish the original game’s existence and purpose.\n\nInstead, remakes should strive to differentiate, yet, still seem familiar to the base game itself. I believe some examples of good and lacklustre remakes should serve to illustrate this point.\n\nResident Evil 2 Remake\n\nResident Evil 2 is not a game I originally played. I never owned an original PlayStation growing up, and I was far too young to be allowed to play mature rated titles. Despite that, I was excited to play the remake due to high reviews, and I wasn’t disappointed.\n\nResident Evil 2 is a survival horror game where you play one of two playable characters; Rookie cop Leon S. Kennedy, and Claire Redfield. You have to manage your limited inventory while avoiding zombies and creatures in a punishing combat system.\n\nThe remake was a top-to-bottom remake. The game featured an over the top aiming system, instead of the game’s stop and shoot gameplay with a fixed camera system. The level design was altered to accommodate this new gameplay system, and to better facilitate the game’s pacing. Examples of this include the first open ended area of the game; the police station. In the original, there were no stairs that lead to the top floor, which were added in the remake.\n\nThis also means that some areas were redesigned, or cut altogether, sometimes for better or for worse. Moth and spider enemies that could be found in the sewer section were removed, boss fights were altered to accommodate the new gameplay, and sections such as the laboratory were expanded.\n\nDoors in the original would often signal the need for a loading screen, and by design, enemies would be unable to chase after the player. This is not the case in the remake as the game has the technological power to allow seamless movement room to room. Not only does this streamline the gameplay, but it also assists in the original vision of Resident Evil of always being on edge, never feeling safe, since zombies have the potential to chase after the player.\n\nPerhaps the most famous change is Mr. X, who stalks the player around the level akin to Nemesis in Resident Evil 3. In the base game, Mr. X didn’t play that big of a role, some people argued that they even forgot he was a thing, whereas in the remake, he is a force to be reckoned with. Mr. X stalks the player, pushing open doors, knocking zombies, and can not be permently dispatched. You are encouraged to run and hide when Mr. X sees you, adding to the tense survival horror atmosphere.\n\nLastly, the graphical overhaul isn’t just to make the game look pretty, it’s there to exemplify the horror tone of the game. The game is also much, much darker than the original game in terms of lighting. The focus on hyperrealism coupled with this really brings you closer to the experience, especially when compared to its PlayStation counterpart.\n\nSo is Resident Evil 2 Remake a good example of a remake? Well it depends on who you ask. Some people would argue that the game has removed aspects that only added to the experience, such as the reliant on fixed camera angles and certain enemy types. Others say that the remake helps usher in new fans of the series due to its more accessible control scheme, and difficulty selects that allows the player to save without using ink ribbons as a currency. The modernisation also gives a glimpse of what the game all those years ago would look with today’s modern interpretations.\n\nFor me, Resident Evil 2 Remake is what I want remakes to be. They aren’t replacements for the original game, but they’re instead a reimagining of how the game would’ve been made with today’s talent and technology. It doesn’t aim to just replicate the original experience, but to enhance it.\n\nIf you want to see a video of somebody talk about the game in more depth, especially one who’s played the original, see this excellent video from Super Bunnyhop.\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated\n\nThis is a game I actually played when I was a wee lad. A game I played over and over, largely because it was SpongeBob. When I heard that a remake was in development, I was surprised and excited!\n\nBattle for Bikini Bottom is basically a collectathon in the style of a Banjo-Kazooie game if I had to summarise it. You played as SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy platforming and fighting robots in various stages, while collecting the game’s premium currency “Golden Spatulas” to unlock more levels and stop the robot infestation.\n\nThe remake was primarily a total graphical overhaul, and added some content that was scrapped during the game’s original development due to time constraints. A multiplayer mode was included as well which tasked up to 4 players to defeat waves and waves of robots.\n\nThe result? For me, it was pretty poor. The game retains all the mechanics of the original game, so much so that it also retained the chunkiness and inconsistent difficulty curve. The voice lines are repetitive, the game is way, WAY too easy with rare instances of hard difficulty which appear too quickly, some puzzles are still clunky since they rely on the game’s basic physics system, a subpar camera, and so on. These issues are present in the original game, but they were made in a much earlier period of game development where standards were much lower and understandable, where as today, they are inexcusable. The game’s extra content is only accessible through the game’s lacklustre multiplayer mode that I wasted no time in after one game.\n\nThere are definitely some minute gameplay changes, such as Sandy being able to use her lasso attack in mid-air, and some enemies are given more visual information to help the player better understand what state they’re in, but these changes are so tiny that I didn’t even notice them.\n\nBigger changes such as having less loading screen instances in the hub world, a more fluid control scheme, and even more streamlined level design like the Resident Evil 2 Remake would be enough to make the SpongeBob remake stand out as something truly special. Instead, it’s just a lacking effort. I think the relegation of the cut content to the multiplayer mode was the worst aspect, as multiplayer is not what made the original special all those years ago.\n\nThe reason I felt so disappointed in this remake effort, especially when compared to Resident Evil 2 Remake, is that to me, a remake is an opportunity for developers to create the game they wanted in the modern gaming landscape. The game doesn’t need to keep every single design principle of the original because the original already exists. Replacing the original game is an idea that should be avoided, instead, it should be expanded, enhanced, and reimagined.\n\nIt’s not all bad however, the game’s updated art style more closely mimics that of the show itself, and the animations are so much more expressive. It’s like you’re actually in an episode of the show, which is probably every SpongeBob fan’s dream come true. It would just be better if the game and mechanic design itself were given the same treatment.\n\nI want to emphasise however, that the remake itself isn’t a bad game. As someone who played the original all those years ago, it made me remember all the fun times I had in my childhood. I just feel that it could’ve done much, much better as a remake, rather than try to replace the original. To me, if a game has to rely on nostalgia for me to enjoy it, then there is a huge issue.\n\nMafia: Definitive Edition\n\nHaven’t played the original of this one, but it’s safe to say that when a remake of Mafia was underway, a lot of people were sceptical. Mafia was hailed for its story, believable characters, and a world that really felt alive. With such a solid reputation, many were sceptical on whether or not a remake could give the game the respect it deserves.\n\nMafia is a third person story based shooter that follows Thomas Angelo, a taxi driver in Empire Bay who joins the Mafia, performing jobs for his boss and other henchmen. From the outset it is a very simple plot, but intelligent writing and expressive performances elevates it to be truly special.\n\nMuch like Resident Evil 2 Remake, Mafia: Definitive edition is a complete overhaul; changing absolutely everything, with exception to the bare essentials.\n\nThe remake adopts a modern third person over the shoulder shooter control scheme, making the various shootouts more personal and fluid. To account for this, weapons are more inaccurate, not to make the game easier, but to put the player in Tommy’s shoes due to his inexperience with firearms. The player also doesn’t regenerate health, in-line with the game’s roots.\n\nThe same effort was put into the game’s driving system, with much more believable physics and vehicle detail. There are also options to make the driving more realistic or arcadey for the player’s comfort. This will be analysed more when we talk about that racing mission.\n\nThe original game’s mechanic of having to pay speeding fines, and other police interaction has been retained as well, and are implemented more cohesively. Some say they’re a strange inclusion in a game with no currency, but it serves to really place the player as an actor in the world. Speaking of police, their inclusion was modernised, which is especially apparent with the police radio, which reacts based on the player’s actions to minute details.\n\nThe presentation is really the best part of the remake. The graphics, cutscenes, and acting have been improved to some of the best seen in the gaming industry, especially the later two.\n\nThe graphics are hyper realised, with detail reaching down to character’s eyes and fingernails. The cutscenes are redone with new animations, script changes, camera angles, the works. The acting is directed and performed masterfully; no performance is wasted, and every character feels like they’re a real person. To me, these are some of the best cutscenes in gaming.\n\nThere has been some discussion on whether the script changes and redesigned camera angles are for the better, with some preferring the original, but the remake when taken on its own is still fantastic. Much like Yakuza Kiwami, which we’ll talk about soon, some new cutscenes were added to recontexulise the story in the series’ canon, with the most notable example being the ending, where the game is tied into Mafia 2.\n\nThe last thing to talk about is the mission design. Mafia is a linear, mission based game, rather than an open world one. Every mission and their environments were redesigned to better accommodate the modern gameplay systems, and to highlight certain events. One of these missions includes the infamous “Fair Play” mission, where Tommy has to fill in for a race car driver and place 1st.\n\nIt’s popular knowledge among Mafia fans that “Fair Play” in the original was a hard as nails mission. The player drove an old rust bucket that drifted extremely easy, and your opponents were determined to win the race, so much so that many players put the game down due to its difficulty.\n\nSo, Hanger 13 (The developer) was in a conundrum, should they make the mission easier in the remake to ensure players continue the story, or should they preserve the spirit of the mission and have players undergo what everyone went through all those years ago. It’s a very interesting story, and the solution was to have the mission’s difficulty preserved through the new “realism” difficulty setting, keeping the realistic physics and aggressiveness of the opponents. This ensures that if one wanted to continue to see the rest of the story, there are no artificial barriers preventing so, and those who have nostalgia for such an infamous mission, they can go through it all over again.\n\nI’ve spoken very highly of Mafia: Definitive Edition, and some of that is due to bias; I really adore this remake. Not only does it retell and expand an amazing story, but does so in such a unique way as if it’s a totally new game. It is more accessible than the original to a new audience, and should serve as a benchmark for future remakes. There are some issues that can be raised, such as the changed script, but as it stands, it’s a terrific remake.\n\nYakuza Kiwami\n\nFor our final example we have Yakuza Kiwami, or Ryu Ga Gotoku Kiwami (龍が如く極) in Japan. Kiwami is a remake of the series first iteration, which was developed on the PlayStation 2 in 2005.\n\nYakuza is a third person beat-em-up that follows Kazuma Kiyru, a former Yakuza who gets kicked out of the Yakuza after taking the blame for a murder he did not commit. He then spends 10 years behind bars, and is released into a new world, where he must uncover a conspiracy involving his brother Nishikiyama, a girl named Haruka, and politics in the Tojo clan.\n\nThe remake is a total overhaul of the original, with notable exceptions. The combat, exploration and presentation are all revamped with modern design principles. The combat is changed from the original’s 1 combat style to 4, with the combat closely following Yakuza 0, which came out in 2015. The combat is more fluid, and holds more potential for user created combos, and interesting enemy encounters.\n\nThe player is rewarded more for participation in minigames and finding secrets hidden in the game’s city Kamurocho. The open world is seamless with no loading, whereas in the original the game had to use fixed camera angles with loading to render more areas of the city. Minigames were added and refined, most likely a port over from Yakuza 0, and a new format of player upgrading was introduced, again from Yakuza 0. This includes a new “Majima Everywhere” system, where a major side character by the name of Goro Majima ambushes you in the game world to ensure that Kazuma’s in physical shape.\n\nFinally, the game’s presentation was altered, primarily in the visual department. The game has a much more clean and realistic visual style, and a higher polygon budget, which is an improvement over the game’s original blocky assets. The faces especially are much more expressive, and allow the user to better understand what they’re thinking about. Due to the combat system, the animations are more fluid, but not all animations, more on that later. The voice work was redone for all characters as well, and some cutscenes were even added to expand plot points in the story. The soundtrack is completely remixed to be more electrical, while still being recognisable to the game’s original soundtrack.\n\nThis all sounds pretty good, the remake job must be pretty good then, right? Well, yes, and no.\n\nLet’s start with the cutscenes, every cutscene is done with redone voice lines by their original actors, but the motion capture and Japanese dialogue (not English subtitle dialogue) is the same as it were the original, as in 1–1. While some may say it’s good to be faithful to the original, I think it is more jarring more than anything.\n\nMotion capture on its own is an art. Acting in a booth is a different environment to acting on a stage or in a film. In between Yakuza and Yakuza Kiwami, there have been 9 Yakuza games, with each game refining the game’s writing, animation, and acting capabilities. The contrast between the game’s beautiful graphics and the game’s 2005 cutscene animation and dialogue is a tad jarring. This is especially noticeable with the game’s lip syncing, which is very PS2. It is serviceable in terms of the game, but I feel that a remake would’ve been an opportune time to juice up the game’s story presentation. This is actually achieved in the game’s exclusive cutscenes, which definitely expands upon the game’s story, and are performatively fantastic.\n\nThe combat, while an improvement from a gameplay standpoint, could’ve been a lot more interesting. The combat system was imported directly from Yakuza 0, to the point where one could question why. It’s so secret that the first Yakuza had an adequate combat system, and instead of creating a more sufficient combat style that is more inline with the context of the game, it seemed more convenient to carry over from Yakuza 0’s much relished combat system.\n\nThe problem with this is that it can be a bit jarring to see Kazuma fight using techniques that don’t gel with his canonical fighting style. For example, one of his more powerful special attacks involves using a knife to fluidly slash his opponent. This move was imported from Majima’s move list from 0, which makes more sense for Majima’s more acrobatic fighting style, than Kazuma’s brawler style.\n\nSpeaking of Majima, in the original game, he was a much more….elusive? He was a bit more elusive than he was in the remake. The original had two boss fights with Majima, whereas the remake has a ton of them due to the Majima Everywhere system. This has the unfortunate consequence of cheapening Majima’s appearance in the story, and makes some story beats not hit as hard as they did all those years ago.\n\nIf you want more detail, please see this excellent video which analyses Yakuza Kiwami, especially when compared with the original, which shares very similar points to those I’ve raised.\n\nIt looks like I’m being a bit harsh here, but it’s mainly from a place of concern for the game’s purpose. I say a lot that I don’t want remakes to “replace” the original game itself, and again, the reasoning here is for untapped potential. Games are often treated as disposable, or not having any intrinsic value, especially historically, which is something I believe should be avoided. The original exists with its own unique personality and feel, something that is most likely impossible to replicate ever again.\n\nOverall though, the game is more accessible for newcomers to the series, and is a success. Yakuza Kiwami 2 would come out years later, and would have massive improvements, but also suffer similar issues. A lot of my quirks could be seen as nit-picks, but again, I just feel that remakes are an opportunity to reimagine the game from a modern perspective entirely, especially after seeing the Mafia and Resident Evil 2 remake.\n\nRemakes aren’t that easy eh?\n\nSo you can probably understand why remaking a game is no easy feat. It’s almost like making an entirely different game; designers have to design new systems, artists have to design new assets, voice actors have to usher in new performances, sound engineers need to create believable soundscapes, animators need to animate, etc.\n\nThe lead designers especially need to discuss how closely they wish to capture the original spirit of the game, and decide what to keep, what to lose, and what to remake. It’s a very involved process.\n\nSo let’s recap what we’ve learned from our case studies; remakes should strive to use the opportunity to retell the original game through modern lens, while retaining what made it special in the first place. Remakes shouldn’t replace their older counterpart, but instead iterate on them, and become a completely fresh experience for the player. Remakes should play on expectations, and uncover their hidden potential, previously untapped due to time or technological constraints.\n\nTo me, this is the purpose of the remake, and as time goes on, we can be sure to see even greater examples through the upcoming Resident Evil 4 Remake, The Last of Us Remake, and beyond."
