        "text": "This double-sided map was published in 2006 to accompany Vivendi Universal Studio’s action-adventure game Scarface, the World is Yours. The fictional ‘sequel’ to the 1983 film was released for Xbox, Playstation, and Windows, then later for the Wii and PSP.\n\nPlayers would take control of a resurrected Tony Montana and attempt to rebuild his criminal empire across Florida and Cuba. Various in-game locations of interest are noted throughout each side."
