        "text": "Confession time I actually played the game before seeing the film, I picked up the game at random cheap a few months after it came out, then I saw the video preview of the original film in the game, I went and bought the film after I beat the game.\n\nBeen replaying this one via backwards compatibility on the Xbox 360.\n\nIt's one the few to copy the GTA formula and get it right. The 80's vibe is on point, though weirdly with some music that is much more modern. There's a lot to like, from the business buying, the look, the nods to the film.\n\nBest part is almost everything you do serves a purpose, whether it's taking over fronts to sell your stuff, or buying businesses which confer in game bonuses, in too many games you play a mission and stop and think \"Why is my character doing this thing? What purpose does this serve?\" in Scarface I never found myself wondering that, whether it was taking out gangs or buying up new property.\n\nSpeaking of the gangs I also went hunting relentlessly for gangs in neighbouring areas so I could take over their territory, I got very into the mindset that Tony would not abide any competition and hunted dilligently at different times of day stomping every gang I could find.\n\nI also particularly liked the phone mechanic as it allowed to me use Tony's various henchmen, from simple stuff like having a car a brought to me, because why should I risk stealing one and getting police after me? I'd on;y have to bribe them after I escape to bring my cop heat down.\n\nThat's another thing the actions you take have consequence, go around causing too much chaos and the cops show up much faster when something happens, though you can if you're good talk your way out of trouble which can reduce your cop heat and save ammo as well.\n\nI also found the story while basic to be interesting going with an alternate what if Tony survived shootout at the end of the film setup? Though admittedly a lot of the context made more sense after I finished the game and went and watched the film.\n\nI love this game, and I often wish it was get modernised but that's impossible as the dev team got folded into Activision as a support team (fuck you Activision) and Vivendi went bust years ago. Apparently there is a PC version but it's very badly optimised so I never bothered tracking it down.\n\nAnyone else here love this game?"
