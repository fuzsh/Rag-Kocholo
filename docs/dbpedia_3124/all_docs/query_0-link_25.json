        "text": "The Good\n\nSome maybe quick to dismiss Scarface as a Grand Theft Auto with Tony Montana and they would be wrong. Scarface focuses on different aspects from Grand Theft Auto and as a result it becomes a different game.\n\nScarface's best quality is its Empire Builder scheme. After being attacked at your mansion, your empire was divided among the rival gangs of Miami and you (as Tony Montana) must get it all back. Every mission involves getting back your turf and increasing your reputation as the biggest dog in the yard. You will find local gangs and eliminate them, buy fronts for your empire, go to the islands to buy kilos of drugs, and buy cars to distribute them to your fronts.\n\nThe combat aspect of the game is very interesting. By using the auto aim feature you can quickly scroll up to an enemy's head for a quick head shot. After killing an enemy you can taunt him to fill up your rage meter. When you fill up your Rage meter you can enter a first person Blind Rage mode where you become invincible and destroy any enemy with one hit (which also refills your health). There are a nice variety of weapons to choose from including Hand Guns, Machine Guns, Rocket Launchers, and the dreaded Chainsaw.\n\nFor fans of the original movie, The World Is Yours features many great perks. Al Pacino gave his face (although not his voice, but its not a complete loss) for the game, all of the iconic locations are included (the Babylon Club, the Sun Ray Hotel, Sosa's Pavilion, Tony's Mansion, and Even Lopez Motors, although its been renamed Diaz Motors), and nearly every character is referenced from the first movie.\n\nScarface also has loads of replay value thanks to the Exotics Catalogue. In it you can buy new skins for your Mansion and buy neat items to fill it with. You can also buy new cars and boats, all of which can be summoned by a simple phone call (a much more convenient alternative to stealing cars). You can purchase henchmen to protect your fronts, and do special missions for you (the Enforcer kills rival gangs, the Driver can steal cars to send to chop shops, and the Assassin takes down important rival gang members).\n\nThe drug dealing mini games are also really cool. Whenever you have some drugs you can go up to a dealer and sell them to him. When this happens a little circle comes up and then you have to hold down the Circle Button then let go before it goes all the way around. If you do it right you will end selling your product for a better value. This mini game is also used to fast talk cops and negotiate Bank Percentages when laundering your money.\n\nThe Bad\n\nScarface's biggest problem is its difficulty. Players will die many times trying to attack rival gangs and during story missions, mostly due to bad guys who can takes more bullets then a tank. Filling the rage meter is very hard to do in the heat of battle, since taunting a dead enemy leaves you defenseless (and its impossible to find cover most of the time). Sometimes in drug deals the meter will not stop at quiet the right time and as a result Players may end up getting shot by a mad dealer. During Distribution Missions, when on one side of Miami a front on the other side of (the very large) town can be attacked."
