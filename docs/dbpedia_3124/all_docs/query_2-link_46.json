Now, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment commemorates the 1983 film’s release with the SCARFACE Gold Edition available on 4K Ultra HD for the first time ever, newly remastered Blu-ray, DVD and Digital on October 15, 2019. The physical releases include a brand-new bonus feature, the SCARFACE: 35th Anniversary Reunion featuring Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer to celebrate the film’s iconic legacy as one of the greatest crime sagas of all time.\n\nUniversal Pictures Home Entertainment is also releasing a SCARFACE “The World is Yours” Limited Edition gift set which includes the 1983 version of SCARFACE (excluding DVD), the 1932 version of Scarface on Blu-rayTM for the first time ever and a collectible “The World is Yours” statue replica making it a must-own addition to every film fan’s library.

They came in search of the American Dream. One of them found it on the sun-washed avenues of Miami… wealth, power and passion beyond his wildest dreams. He was Tony Montana. The world will remember him by another name… Scarface. Starring Al Pacino as Tony Montana along with Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Robert Loggia, Scarface has become a cultural phenomenon brilliantly directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone.\n\nBONUS FEATURES ON SCARFACE GOLD EDITION & “THE WORLD IS YOURS” LIMITED EDITION ON 4K ULTRA HD, BLU-RAYTM & DVD:\n\n• SCARFACE: 35th Anniversary Reunion\n\n• Deleted Scenes\n\n• The SCARFACE Phenomenon – This documentary presents SCARFACE as a unique phenomenon in cinema history.
