        "text": "Any film you watch will have an element of lighting that will add to a specific scene or theme. The movie Scarface (1983) was directed by Brian DePalma and features Al Pacino as Tony Montana. This movie is a very dark movie as it is a part of the gangster genre. Mise en scene would dictate the types of props used in the movie; the things that you see in the scene. For instance in Tony Montana’s house, you can see that he used dark colors in his house, dark reds and blacks. These colors will reflect very dark lighting and a sense of evil. This is how mise en scene correlates to the type of lighting that is used in a film. The picture below will show a better description of what I am speaking of. You can see how even though there is lighting being used on the walls and in the doorway, there still a dark aura because of the colors used on the wall and floors, to include all of the props in the room.\n\n“Similar to the gangster genre is film noir. Film noir is typically a darker film. These types of films deal with hardboiled detectives, gangsters, or normal people who turn to a life of crime. These films also usually used low-key lighting. Film noir is used to describe crime dramas” (Olznoi 2011). The movie Scarface also fits the description above. There are a few different types of lighting but the Movie Scarface was shot using mostly Low-Key Lighting. GoodyKoontz & Jacobs (2014) describes low-key lighting as “high-contrast lighting dominated by deep shadows with a few bright highlights” (Ch. 6). The picture above depicts just that and the picture below will also show this. Tony is in his office but you can see how the still is dominated by dark colors with deep shadows and a few highlights from the windows and television monitors.\n\nThe clip below is the last scene from the movie. As you watch it you can see how the low key lighting is used to highlight the weapons being fired, movement in the shadows and Tony Montana taking is last stand.\n\nThe Benefits from using this type of lighting in the movie is that viewers get a realistic feel of the scene and the genre. If high key lighting was used, it would cast a very bright atmosphere over the movie which would not allow the viewer to experience the dark, deep criminal evil that is taking place. The element of surprise would be missing as well as the element of deceit and wrongdoing.\n\nTo answer the title, lighting really does matter. if lighting isn’t correct, the feel and intent of the movie may be thrown off which would make it difficult for the viewer to connect with the actors.\n\nMiller, J.
