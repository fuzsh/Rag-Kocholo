        "text": "Scarface: The World Is Yours is a third-person shooter video game that is a \"sequel\" to Scarface (1983). The game starts with an alternate ending: The Skull tries to shoot Tony in the back, but he spots him and kills him with his M16A1 rifle. The police arrives to Tony's mansion but he manages to escape. Three months later, Tony returns to Miami to find Sosa and kill him. The game was allowed to use the likeness of actor Al Pacino for the character of Tony Montana, which was voiced by an actor picked by Pacino. In addition, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia and Al Israel return from the 1983 film to voice other characters in the game. From a firearm enthusiast's standpoint, this game is an anomaly. Many of the firearms seen in the film are unremarkable weapons that were decades-old designs at the time. However, the game features many newer and flashier weapons that are closer to ones you would see in Grand Theft Auto than Scarface. Also, the game is set in 1983 (the film begins in 1980 but covers a span of three years), and many of the guns seen in the game are anachronistic.\n\nThe following weapons appear in the video game Scarface: The World is Yours:\n\nHandguns\n\nColt M1911A1\n\nCalled the \".45 Automatic\", the Colt M1911A1 is the starting pistol weapon. It can be fitted with a suppressor to hide gunshots fired from it. The weapon incorrectly holds 12 rounds in the magazine. In the film, Tony's pistol was actually a .32-caliber Beretta Model 81, which really did hold 12 rounds in the magazine. Tony's assassin carries a suppressed M1911 pistol, along with a PSG1.\n\nFor some reason, the model of the M1911 is reused for the two other handguns in the game.\n\n\".38 Automatic\"\n\nThe \".38 Automatic\" is the only pistol available for purchase in the beginning of the game. Its model is the same as the M1911's but with a darker finish, while the HUD icon shows a Walther PPK. The PPK is actually chambered in .380 ACP, so it is possible that the developers simply confused .380 ACP with the .38 Special revolver cartridge. If this pistol is to be believed as a Walther PPK, then its in-game ammo capacity is incorrect as it holds 9 rounds in the magazine (PPKs in .380 only carry 6 rounds, and PPKs in .32 only carry 7). The .38 Automatic is also not really needed, because Tony already has the better M1911 pistol on him at the start of the game's plot. However, the .38 is very common early game as it can immediately be purchased from gun dealers or taken from fallen gang members, while the M1911A1 is unlocked once the player reaches Reputation level 3. Also, some early plot missions disarm Tony of his arsenal and so the player may find themselves using the .38 rather than the M1911. Strangely, this weapon is not Tony's sidearm, despite the fact that in the film he preferred smaller guns in smaller calibers.\n\n\"Deagle\"\n\nThe \"Deagle\" is not available until the player reaches maximum Reputation level and is the best performing pistol, capable of killing most enemies with one shot. The HUD icon properly shows a Desert Eagle and it performs in-game with a magazine capacity of 7 rounds, while the gun's model simply has a gold finish applied to the M1911's. Tony carries one with only 7 rounds available when he makes his assault against Sosa's mansion at the end of the game. During the fight with Sosa, Sosa himself uses one as well. The appearance of a Desert Eagle in this game is possible, if not exactly likely: the Desert Eagle was first introduced in 1983, the year the game is set. However, the 7-round magazine and gold color are not correct for the time period. Desert Eagles were chambered in .44 Magnum or .357 Magnum (8 and 9 rounds, respectively) until the introduction of the .50 AE in 1988, which was the first time that the capacity in these guns was limited to 7 rounds. Furthermore, the Desert Eagle wasn't offered with gold finish until much later, in the late 1990s at the earliest!\n\nSubmachine Guns\n\nIMI Micro Uzi\n\nThe Micro Uzi appears as the \"Micro SMG\" and is the first submachine gun the player gains access to. It is commonly found in the hands of gang members during early game missions. By default, the Micro Uzi has an ammo capacity of 25 rounds which appears to be correct for the length of the magazine fitted. Later in the game, attachments for the Micro Uzi are unlocked such as a folding stock that reduces recoil, a magazine extension that visually adds a 32-round magazine but incorrectly holds 35 rounds, and a suppressor. The HUD icon shows it as a Mini Uzi, despite the in-game model in fact being a Micro Uzi. The appearance of the Micro-Uzi is incorrect, as they were not produced until 1986, and the Uzi pistol, which was sometimes converted to full-auto, did not exist until 1984, the year after the game is set.\n\nMAC-10\n\nA MAC-10 with what appears to be Uzi-style ridges on its exterior is featured in the game. By default, it holds 30 rounds. Like the Micro Uzi above, it can be fitted with a folding stock, suppressor and an extended magazine that holds 40 rounds. Tony's driver carries a MAC-10. The in-game HUD icon shows the MAC-10 with the foregrip strap, which isn't available on the in-game gun.\n\nAssault Rifles\n\nM16A1\n\nAn M16A1 with a strange vented handguard appears in this game as the \"Carbine Assault Rifle\". Despite being modelled with 30-round STANAG magazines, the rifle unrealistically holds 50 rounds. Like the Ak-47, the M16A1 can be fitted with \"jungle style\" dual magazines (which also like the Ak, bizarrely doubles its ammo capacity), and with an underbarrel weapon, which for the M16 is the M203 grenade launcher. The M203 can unrealistically fire three times before having to reload. Tony uses a fully upgraded M16A1 at the beginning of the game during the mansion shootout and in this mission, neither the M16 nor the M203 ever have to be reloaded. The underbarreled grenade launcher appears to have been modelled after an actual M203 and not the mocked up 39mm launcher prop used in the movie in combination with the Colt AR-15 wielded by Al Pacino.\n\nAK-47\n\nThe AK-47 appears in this game under the same name of its real-life counterpart and is unlocked to the player upon reaching Reputation level 3. The rifle incorrectly holds 40 rounds in its modelled 30-round magazines. Attachments for the AK-47 include be dual \"jungle style\" attached magazines (although there appears to be nothing holding them together, such as tape) which somehow increases the rifle's ammo capacity to 80 rounds and an underbarrel shotgun, named the \"Masterkey\" (though its model is too blocky and generic to make out as a specific shotgun model). The Masterkey shotgun correctly holds 3 rounds at a time but does not eject shells when fired, possibly due to a game engine limitation. Tony's driver also carries this rifle. Tony uses an AK during the final battle with Sosa. Bizarrely, the gun's receiver textures appears to have been made out of the M16's below.\n\nShotguns\n\nRemington 870 Marine Magnum\n\nThe Remington Model 870 is the only shotgun in the game and close inspection shows that it is modelled after the Marine Magnum version. It holds 8 rounds and is a powerful weapon, being available to the player early in the game. This weapon can dismember enemies hit at close ranges. The Remington 870 is carried by Tony's Enforcer who is also armed with an M79 grenade launcher. As an interesting note, in the movie, the character Skull carries a double barreled shotgun to assassinate Tony. However, in this game, Skull is shown with the Remington instead.\n\nSniper Rifles\n\nHeckler & Koch PSG1\n\nThe Heckler & Koch PSG1 appears in this game as the \"Sniper Rifle\", and is the weapon of choice for Tony's hired assassin, along with the suppressed M1911A1 as mentioned above. Despite being modelled with a 5-round magazine, it holds an impossible 15 rounds. Like many of the other guns in this game, the PSG1's receiver seems to have been modified from the M16's, and in this case is also backwards.\n\nMachine Guns\n\nFN M240B\n\nThe M240B appears in this game as the \"SAW\" and is depicted as a side-loading machine gun fed by very thin and long STANAG-style magazines (while interestingly, the 2006 E3 reveal trailer shows the M240B correctly fitted with a belt box), which apparently and also unrealistically hold 120 rounds at a time. Contrary to this, HUD icon for the M240 depicts it with a belt. The MG in-game is also a mounted weapon on many vehicles, including helicopters and boats and can also be found in stationary positions. Vehicles with a mounted M240B are unlockable much sooner than the handheld version itself and provide guaranteed defense during missions where enemy gang members may attack Tony in his vehicle.\n\nLaunchers\n\nM79 Grenade Launcher\n\nThe M79 grenade launcher appears in this game as the \"M-79\" and is the first explosive weapon that the player unlocks as they progress through the game. Tony's enforcer carries an M79 as his weapon of choice, along with a Remington 870. Oddly, this weapon is capable of firing 3 shots at a time (a la China Lake Launcher), whereas in the real world it's capable of only one due to being a single-shot breechloader. Nonetheless, the reload time for the M79 in-game is pretty much the same as its rate of fire.\n\nM9 \"Bazooka\"\n\nThe M9 Bazooka appears in this game as the \"Bazooka\". Interestingly, its HUD icon appears to have been referenced from an M72 LAW, which is a completely different weapon.\n\nM202 FLASH"
