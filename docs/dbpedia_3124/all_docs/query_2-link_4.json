        "text": "Now, this one is pretty hard. I like Saints Row a lot, but I am a die hard fan of Scarface. Hell, I am even planning on getting a figure of Tony Montana to put on my desk, don't know which is better Enterbay or Bitzway?\n\nAnyways, I'll have to go with Scarface. The amount of features they put into it such as\n\n-buying drugs\n\n-selling drugs\n\n-Putting money in the bank\n\n-Buying Cars and boats\n\n-Pimping your mansion( furniture, objects etc)\n\n-Upgrading your mansion\n\n-Taunts\n\nand much more.\n\nI hardly spent time doing missions, I was mainly at the Mansion because of how detailed it looked. Saints Row 2 is a fun game, I love the gangsta feel in games. Scarface has more of the mafia, nostalgic feel, in my opinion.\n\nScarface is such an awesome game. It is to this day the most surprisingly good game I have played. I didn't know anything about it when I bought it, other than the fact that it's based on a movie. I didn't even know that it's a free roaming game. I bought it on a hunch. And boy was I pleasantly surprised. But it was released at the end of the last generation which didn't help the sales. It is a very underrated and often ignored game. But one of the best free roaming experiences ever.\n\nThe game is full of surprises. Just when you thought you'd seen everything, it introduces something new. You wouldn't believe my reaction when I realized that the game isn't set only in Miami, but also on the islands. That was incredible.\n\nEdited October 16, 2012 by GTAvanja\n\nAs much as I love Scarface, SR2 takes it for me.\n\nDon't get me wrong; there are few things as enjoyable as walking around as Sr. Montana, with a dedicated button to swear, insult and degrade your enemies. The gore was glorious, as was the soundtrack. And it was certainly an enjoyable standalone story as well as a worthy 'what if?' ending to the film. But the city always felt a little 'dull' to me. Pretty big and with great replicas of locales featured in the film... but other than that, it felt a bit like I was driving around a movie set. Which can be a plus in itself for some, I suppose.\n\nAlso, if I want to play Scarface on the PC, I have to go into msconfig and only select one core of my CPU. A great game, unfortunately without multicore support.\n\nSR2 had a wonderfully varied and expansive city, with a plethora of secrets. The storyline struck a great balance between silliness and realism, there were lots of things to do and I enjoyed creating a gangbanger in a suit with a cockney swagger. SR2 does, however, have a problem with the PC version; but thankfully I seem to have the 'just right' grouping of hardware and a few mods to improve performance.\n\nBoth great games, but the varied setting of Stilwater nabs this one in favour of SR2 for me.\n\nBut please, make a HD remake for The World is Yours.\n\nSaints Row 2's stilwater is the most dull and boring city in video games history?\n\nNo, that honour goes to Steelport in SR3.\n\nStilwater had a great variety of environments; a burgeoning CBD, wealthy suburban sprawls, the slums, a University and its campus, a mountain with its own lake, a cemetery... The healthy mixture of neighbourhoods makes it an interesting environment, if you ask me.\n\nBut Miami in TWIY? It didn't feel as eclectic, and it felt more enclosed compared to Stilwater. But the locales that were reproduced from the film were certainly lovely.\n\nAnd how was the city dull, you could talk to Peds\n\nI was talking about the city as a location itself, as opposed to its inhabitants. Did you miss the part where I said I loved walking around as Tony with the ability to insult people?"
