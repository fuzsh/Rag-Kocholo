        "text": "Yeah, we'll eventually get a new kex but it likely won't come for a long while. TBH, I'm more excited for those new PS2 emus than anything! Haha\n\nI'd love to see most of the PS2 catalog working perfectly on PS4. Give me equality with PCSX2 and I'd be happy because I'm so far behind on my back catalog that a new kex for games isn't really my concern. I'm still behind 5.05 so I'm ok on that front. Gimme new emus, man haha\n\nI know that there is an official (but unreleased, AFAIK) PS2 Classic of Jak X Combat Racing but has anyone converted that title themselves?\n\nI tried with the Jak emu (PS2 GUI 1.3) and it's surprisingly terrific until an actual race begins. Once there, it simply suffers from slowdown on all fronts. It gets about 10fps and the audio is delayed but other than that it's basically fine.\n\nOnly graphical issue being the vehicle shadows that appear as 20-ish black spikes instead of actual shadows. Other than that it's just the issue of speed.\n\nI only used the default setting in the GUI before I had to go to bed but I have to think this is an easy fix. I'll try some more later tonight and report back the results.\n\nYeah, being able to rip open new >5.50 PS2 Classics will help PS2 emulation *immensely*! Not only with newer revisions of the emulator, but also newer switches/hacks, and new per-game LUA patches which can often be used on other titles too.\n\nOh!\n\n@kozarovv : Do you think anything could be done to fix the invisible cars in Ridge Racer V? Maybe the same sort of fix that was for the other \"Ridge Racer\", R: Racing Evolution?\n\nThe best first-hand experience is first-hand experience Besides, WS patching won't fix any issues but rather exacerbate them if they exist, and NTSC-J for a story-heavy game isn't something I've been apt to try However.... I have already made SH packages and my experience is;\n\nSilent Hill Origins: No issues, SLUS version runs perfectly. WS patched.\n\nSilent Hill 2: Director's Cut: SLES has minor issues. Not-WS patched. Don't select \"60hz\" mode as there are severe graphical glitches with it. Some minor, slightly irritating, audio crackle in pre-rendered FMVs.\n\nSilent Hill 3: SLES version runs perfectly. Not-WS patched.\n\nSilent Hill 4: The Room: SLES version runs perfectly. WS (unsure if patched or native, I can't remember what I did)\n\nThis is different bug, i can look into it anyway.\n\nIf you are the guy who tested Nocturne keep in mind there is game bug that make game crash in hospital on white screen. Bug seems to be very random.\n\nI don't think that anyone gonna be able to finish game with config you posted here. You are hooking not VU functions with vu cycles hack. Using clamping, and no clamping in one time (not sure how emu interpret that). Things like vu1-opt-flags=2, or --cop2-opt-flags=2 can break graphic if not tested properly. Also running HLE kernel seems to be bad idea if we are trying to get better performance, and if it work at all. --ee-cycle-scalar=1.1 can make game slower, --ee-cycle-scalar=0.9 can make it faster, but this can lead to other issues.\n\n--fpu-accurate-muldiv-range=0x47d2cc,0x4f32b8 --fpu-accurate-range=0x47d2cc,0x4f32b8, that first one is not needed if you use second one. Because second one include it in itself. Also i think that you can remove that at all. Accurate math on so big memory region can slow down game a lot, this should be used only on floats that break game physics, etc. --gs-motion-factor=50 and --gs-optimize-30fps=1, also here i suggest to remove first one. Basically with that amount of vu/fpu optimizations game can't work correctly, even if is faster.\n\nlocal PrecompileAddrs seems to be not needed. I made a mistake, emu can handle that, but probably get slow down before it flush recompiler memory. That why we get that \"drop slowdowns\". Still no idea how to fix that.\n\nI created small patch before i sold ps4, but never tested it to be honest. But looks like you have different game version that i have. Anyway i will post it here, maybe someone here have that version. This is not a patch for gfx fix, this should save some ee cycles, and make game working smoother, if it will boot at all...\n\ntext\n\nScarface seems to be pre 3..00 so we should get profit here.
