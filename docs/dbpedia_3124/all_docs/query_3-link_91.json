        "text": "At a discount price of $10 I bought Mafia 2: Digital Deluxe Edition. This means I get all of the DLC. These DLCs include Joe’s Adventure, Jimmy’s Vendetta, War Hero Pack, Greaser Pack, Vegas Pack, and Renegade Pack.\n\nMost of these are just aesthetics but that’s $60 in DLC for an extra $2.\n\nThe Brief: Mafia\n\nA long time ago in a forest far far away a boy was left with parents who were in the dark ages of technology. As an accountant my father fell behind on the technology boom that hit accounting and because of this his firm stagnated until he eventually started using new technologies to his advantage… and then his business boomed.\n\nIn between this transformation this poor boy (which as you guessed is me by now) was stuck with Pacman and DOS as the only computer he owned.\n\nSo when I opened up a Pentium (1) computer on Christmas day I was super excited and set it up immediately.\n\nSo after a long time of playing a lot of simple games I finally decided (with money from my job) to go out and buy a game. That game was Mafia.\n\nAs it turned out my computer was not good enough to run this game and so I could only play it when I visited my friend who had a better computer.\n\nMafia was ahead of the game. Here was a game designed for high end computers in a world in which people did not have high end machines. Today high end machines are relatively cheap.\n\nAs a matter of fact I just bought my girlfriend’s grandfather a fairly high end computer for a mere $300.\n\nWhen Mafia hit the scene it didn’t make a big splash in the market. It did alright… but not fantastic.\n\nFor that reason Mafia was a niche game. Little did the folks at Illussions Softworks know that the gangster game would blow up.\n\nA year before Mafia was released Grand Theft Aura 3 came out. Two years later The Godfather video game would come out. A year after Scarface video game came out. Two years later Saints Row would be released.\n\nEvery single gangster game to be released has had great success. With the release of Mafia 2 in August 2010 the “Mafia” game became a franchise.\n\nSynopsis\n\nBefore getting into the gameplay it is important to note that the emphasis of this game is story. Whereas other gangster games are about living out your fantasy, this game is about the story arch. This game will offer an authentic mobster story with moderate amounts of historical relevance.\n\nI say moderate because as I’m playing through it I’m finding some minor historical inaccuracies. As one example there are Playboy magazines all over the apartments of the gangsters. This is to show what sort of people you are looking as since Playboy magazines are sort of demonized reading material. Of course the game is based in 1943…. 10 years before Hugh Hefner formed Playboy Magazine.\n\nAnother moderate example of historical inaccuracies is a sign at a government building indicating that employees are not allowed to smoke on the premises. Of course smoking in government buildings was not outlawed until the 1990s.\n\nBut you really have to look for these inaccuracies and if you just play the game and don’t look around… well you’ll find an entertaining story.\n\nThe story follows young Vito who goes to war in Italy where he is saved in combat by the head of the Sicilian mob. The people of Italy respect the mob so much that they put down their arms and surrender just to his voice.\n\nA year later Vito is shot in action and after recovering his sent home to America. His friend Joe, who now works for corrupt elements gets a forger to forge some papers so that Vito will not have to return to the war. Vito finds out his family is in fact debted to the mafia and now Vito must do the dirty work to cover his family’s expenses.\n\nWith the blue eyed dream of America, Vito works the streets to rise to the top and have all of his dreams come true.\n\nThe game will feature largely story elements in order. You can replay chapters in order to get achievements. There is very little open endedness to the game that is often featured in these types of games. This structure gives the story a lot more meaning.\n\nThe game features two forms of combat, hand to hand and gun fighting.\n\nThe hand to hand combat is a three button system. Holding one button will cause you to dodge every single hit. Striking another button will give you a quick jab. The final button gives you the big haymaker punches that knock people down.\n\nThe available hand to hand combinations in the game are relatively simple. One combo is jab jab jab. Another combo is haymaker haymaker. That’s it. Combat comes down to timing, hitting the enemy as he stops blocking but before he punches. In this regard it’s a little luck.\n\nGunfighting is what I would call standard gangster style play… cover based shooting. Cover based shooting is the bane of action games. Instead of running and gunning the almost necessary inclusion of cover forces you to hide behind cover and wait around for the enemy to pop his head out.\n\nThe game also features the same bad car driving seen in almost every single gangster game. It uses all of the familiar controls and offers no real variety…. except one thing. After hitting a button you will activate safe driving mode and you will drive the same speed as traffic. This saves repair bills on your vehicles.\n\nAs far as driving music goes you have three options in radio stations. Because this is based out of the 40s there isn’t going to be a lot of variety in the music. It will all be that sort of Charleston style music that was prominent during the war years. Remember that Elvis enlisted and rock and roll was relatively dead during World War 2.\n\nAlso remember that until The Beatles musicians didn’t really write their own music so there’s actually a large variety in artists here…. except a lot of them play the same songs. That’s unfortunately a problem of the time… not the game.\n\nWhen driving if you run into someone, run through a red light, hit someone’s vehicle, speed, steal a vehicle, break into someone’s home, or fight the cops will be on your tail (if they spot you). In order to get away from cops you have to ‘get away.’ This process is relatively easy… usually it involves just turning a corner.\n\nThis is a breath of fresh air composed to most games of this format in which getting rid of cops is a pain in the butt and is very much unfun.\n\nLet’s talk about weapons! Weapons come in three forms: bombs, pistols, and rifles. Bombs come in the form of mostly grenades and are used to deal with multiple enemies at once. Pistols are fast deadly accurate weapons that are low on power. Rifles are slow sluggish powerful weapons that are used at high ranges.\n\nEvery time you complete a mission you get paid money. Money is required for your basic gangster upkeep and for the end game objective. You need money to buy bullets, better weapons, repair cars, and cop proof stolen goods.\n\nSo yes…. you can run out of money and yes the game can get very hard. But honestly at that part you just start the chapter over and get your money back…. so money isn’t a real thing in the game. The chapter format more or less curtails the risk of losing your money for any given reason.\n\nStrengths\n\nGreat Story\n\nLoaded Package\n\nGreat Pacing\n\nOther gangster games like to go over the top and are competing in the over the top stories mode. This tells you an authentic gangster story that also tells us the formation of the modern mob. If you buy this game you will be immediately feeling like you should finish this in one sitting. The first 15 minutes have you set at the invasion of Italy in the heat of battle.\n\nIf you buy just the normal game you’ll probably get about 11 hours of gameplay. If you buy the deluxe edition you are getting about 30 hours of gameplay. Most games that offer 30 hours of gameplay that’s usually 5 hours of something unique and cool and then 25 hours of boring filler. This game is fully loaded with content in which there is really no point where you are bored.\n\nThe game features great pacing in its introduction. It introduces you to each element of the game slowly over about 2 hours. In most games like this you’re thinking “LET ME RAPE A PROSTITUTE ALREADY.” But honestly in this game you are just willing to play it through.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nFormulaic Gangster Game\n\nNo Replay Value\n\nWhen I first played Grand Theft Aura it was something new and exciting. When they evolved it to Grand Theft Auto 3 it was new and amazing. When I played Godfather it was cool because it told the whole story of all the Godfather movies. But by the time I got to Scarface and I was trying to build up my “balls” so I could let loose on people\n\nGangster games have become insanely formulaic to the point that if you’ve played one… you’ve more or less played them all. Game developers do not change the formula by much and only change it to add some flavor to it. The flavor in this case was non-existent.\n\nThe game also features no real customization or variety of play. This means that once you play through the game once, uninstall it and burn it… you’ll never need or want to play this game again. It’s not that the playthrough is terrible.. it’s just the second one will add nothing.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nThe deluxe edition is worth a purchase when it’s on sale, the normal game is not.\n\nThe game plays like an interactive movie with some game components so if you are looking for something a little more meatier in gameplay I’d suggest playing Tetris."
