        "text": "Rating: Mature 17+ (Mature Sexual Themes, Strong Language, Use of Drugs, Blood and Gore, Intense Violence)\n\nFew movies inspire the kind of fanatical loyalty that Scarface does. The anger, profanity, greed, immorality, misogyny—if it's in the movie, it's in the PC game, Scarface: The World is Yours. And if your idea of fun is rebuilding a drug empire in 1980's Miami, these are all good things.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to the Grand Theft Auto series; the environment is very open ended, but there are a series of missions you have to follow from time to time. The game picks up at the end of the movie. Instead of dying in a hail of gunfire, Tony Montana lives, is dumped out on the mean streets of Miami, and has to rebuild his drug empire. This involves a seemingly endless series of gun battles to steal cash, regain turf, and collect the respect due the ultimate gangster.\n\nYou can try to run and gun your way through the game, but you won't get far. You have to keep the violence on the down low—just a bit—to keep the cops from busting you and taking all of your cash. Tony also can't harm civilians, so you won't be able to just rampage around town. Not to worry though, there are plenty of gang members crawling about and you can blow them away with impunity.\n\nThere are a few things that set this game apart from the rest of the GTA-wannabees. First, this game has Tony, and that means cursing. I have played a lot of M-rated video games and I have never heard cursing like this. In the course of gameplay, Tony uses every swear word in English and a few in Spanish, including a few that I thought Samuel L. Jackson had copyrighted. Tony can't so much as for call for his car without an expletive. At first, this is really funny, but after an hour of Deadwood-like dialog, the base epithet-hurling started to grate on my nerves.\n\nThe second thing going for Scarface is that is has balls. In fact, every time you kill someone, intimidate a hooker, or exhibit a little bit of road rage, your balls increase. Thankfully, there is no graphical representation, just a simple point scale. With more balls, you can more easily intimidate gang members and rebuild your empire.\n\nBut the thing that I liked best about the game was the extraordinary attention to detail. The radio stations are filled with authentic 80's music. The characters from the movie show up in camera. And after accumulating his fortune, you can have Tony purchase exotic junk just like Tony from the movie. There's even a tiger, because, really, what is a narco-kingpin without a pet tiger?\n\nScarface for the PC brings everything that is foul, fun, and compelling about the movie (except Michelle Pfeiffer strung out on Quaaludes.) to the PC platform. And if you like that sort of thing, and you know who you are, you will absolutely love this game."
