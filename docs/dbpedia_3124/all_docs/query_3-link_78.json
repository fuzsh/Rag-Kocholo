I went at it in a very haphazard way. I had a very haphazard approach. It was not orderly at all. I didn't go to a proper school or anything like that. After fooling around in Europe for almost a couple of years, just because I'd gotten out of the army...and didn't really know what to do or how to do it. And so I just went and while there I did some acting, but nothing very remarkable except doing a nightclub with William Burroughs. That was great fun. I did a little bit of studying here or there...Jeff Corey (and at one class in New York) someone said something that helped me a great deal. And then I just learned by doing it.\n\n❧\n\nMost directors don't talk. They don't say very much, which is good. The less said usually the better, but no I can't think of any people with tension. I mean, early on, but that was mostly my problem because I didn't know how to deal with it and hold onto what I needed to do, so I could feel threatened. And once I felt threatened I would respond in kind.\n\nTHE CREATIVE PROCESS\n\nHow did it come about that you started directing? And what do you love about directing?\n\nYULIN\n\nOh, I started directing almost when I started acting. What do I love about it? I really like working with actors. I feel that any problems anybody may have, I've had that problem, so I feel that I understand that. And then the creation and enactment of the world that we're in. How that world is going to look and be and, of course, there are all these terrific people who are going to implement this vision. And this vision is going to be a collective vision. The way we do theater in this country, the director has to come in with an idea of what it's going to be, and then we start discussing. But you've got to come in with that so that by the time rehearsals begin you're pretty much set in terms of set and everything and how that's going to work. So it's the creation of that world. What are you going to do? How is it going to be? If you're going to direct Richard III, The Winter's Tale, The Trip to Bountiful, or Glass Menagerie. How is it going to look? How are you going to cast it? Where are you going to find the people? What is it for you? You get to create that world."
