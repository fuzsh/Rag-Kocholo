        "text": "The appearance of the phrase adheres to the storytelling convention of rule of three. In the script we see “The World Is Yours” examined from multiple vantage points.\n\nNo one needs this blog post to plumb the influence of the gangster film genre on rap and hip-hop. There’s plenty of great literature and scholarship on this topic. For decades, MCs have espoused their reverence for everything from The Public Enemy (1931) to The Godfather Trilogy and especially to Scarface.\n\nA cadre of rappers, in their lyrics (and in Houston rapper Scarface’s case, in name), have tended to equivocate themselves to Tony Montana’s sheer violent outlaw power. Nas himself on the track “NY State of Mind” asserts: “I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine / Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme / Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes / I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a .9 and I'll defeat foes.”\n\nIt’s on another Illmatic track that Nas takes a sublter approach. “The World Is Yours” is a song less about emulating Scarface and more about finding inspiration in his mantra.\n\nJust as the phrase “THE WORLD IS YOURS” resonates with Tony Montana, it also resonates with Nas.\n\nThe song “The World Is Yours” (co-written with Pete Rock) is a moment of weightlessness and optimism amidst otherwise brutal subjects as Nas holds a metaphorical and unrelenting camera up to his young life in the rough Queensbridge public housing development in Queens, New York. This track comes right after “Life’s a Bitch” where the refrain is “Life’s a bitch and then you die.”\n\nHere, producer Pete Rock’s sampling and looping of Ahmad Jamal’s “I Love Music” feels like sonic equivalent of magic realism. Some of the lyrics:\n\n(It's yours)\n\nWhose world is this?\n\nThe world is yours, the world is yours\n\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?\n\n(It's yours)\n\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?\n\nThe world is yours, the world is yours\n\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?\n\nI sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged, then\n\nWritin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin\n\nTo hold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement\n\nUnderstandable smooth shit that murderers move with\n\nThe thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right\n\nThe fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe\n\nThe mind activation, react like I'm facin'\n\nTime like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'\n\nWipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets\n\nSuede Timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete\n\nWhether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep\n\nI can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep\n\nI keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep\n\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)\n\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)\n\nI'm out for dead presidents to represent me\n\nWhose world is this?\n\nThe world is yours, the world is yours\n\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?\n\nThe world is yours, the world is yours\n\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?\n\n(It's yours)\n\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?\n\nThe world is yours, the world is yours\n\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?\n\nIt sounds like the kind of hope you can only find in New York City. (Is it coincidental that Oliver Stone is from NYC too?)\n\nThat’s the thing about Illmatic. It’s never one emotion at once, which is a good lesson for writers of all kinds to take in. It’s grief and a little hope as you “spit phlegm on the streets” with “Suede Timbs on your feets.”\n\nA chant, an incantation perhaps, to be held and examined by all and from many angles.\n\nTHE WORLD IS YOURS.\n\nUntil next time…"
