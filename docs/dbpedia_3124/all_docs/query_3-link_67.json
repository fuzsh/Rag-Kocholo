        "text": "The Green Story podcast highlights This is My Earth, thanks to Maya Hod Ran. Maya is a writer and activist from Pardes Hana-Karkur, Haifa District, Israel. She aims to bring women closer to their nature and to educate kids through beautiful and inspirational stories. She is an expert storyteller and collaborates as a journalist and blogger for several media.\n\nThe topics that interest her the most constitute a wide range that goes from writing workshops, lecturer on the hero’s journey. She is also interested in femininity and compassion, body and soul, and environment.\n\nFor all these reasons, Maya Hod Ran also teaches bibliotherapy for professionals at Oranim College.\n\nAmong her most outstanding activities is her own podcast, called Green Story. The podcast highlights relevant voices committed to various shared struggles concerning ecological entrepreneurship.\n\nAnd the chapter 14 of the Green Story was dedicated to us, This is My Earth!\n\nUri Shanas, Founder of TiME, explains our story.\n\nBehind This is My Earth, a great ecological entrepreneur’s initiative gathers scientific knowledge and evidence, democratic participation, and transparency into one unique organization.\n\nTiME is the only nature conservation nonprofit that allows you to effectively buy and protect lands for as little as 1$, vote and donate as a gift to your friends and family.\n\nAnd such a great idea came from the mind of one Professor of Zoology and Nature Conservation in the Department of Biology and Environment of the University of Haifa at the Oranim Campus.\n\nIf you want to know more about the story of This is My Earth, you can’t miss this podcast. Throughout the recording, you will be listening to Uri Shanas explaining:\n\nHow did the idea of a buying group for biodiversity hotspots come about?\n\nOn the maturing of the venture, the birthing ropes and the relative insanity necessary for ecological entrepreneurship\n\nWhy a donation of one dollar gives you equal rights in votes and decisions on buying land?\n\nThe principle of respect – the price of evolutionary survival, according to zoologist Amots Zahavi\n\nEntering the education system, learning biology, geography, English, and even citizenship\n\nThe inspiration for the Nobel Prize won by Wangari Maathai and “The Green Belt.” whose daughter is a member of the board of directors of This is My Earth.\n\nWhat is it like to compete against loggers and commercial companies?\n\nPersonal responsibility and immediate impact through democracy at TiME\n\nLocal and global collaborations that everyone benefits from"
