Happy weird bit between Christmas and NYE, Enfys THROWBACK PICS TO A PROUD MOMENT OF MINE IN 2023\n\nFew Beliefs About Sales That Can Help you get better at SELLING Past few days has been busy for me as I am preparing for my exams I just thought of what to create for my people and this thing I learnt about online sales which has transformed my online sales I call them belief because sales is psychological and you need to develop some certain beliefs and mindset to conquer online sales I will be sharing for of many to you today 1. The person who cares the most about the prospect wins Human being are so gifted that they can sniff out people's attention and it doesn't take them decades to find out So what you make them feel it is more about THEM that YOU, you will get them to pay you and at the end it is a win-win for both party 2. Expect and Plan for NO You get this right ?? Just take it as simple as it sounds Expect NO 3. You can't save everyone The day I knew that even if I make my product 2000,it will still be expensive for some people We aren't Jesus and as much as we want to help many people We can't do that because we can't save everyone Why am I telling you this ?? Let it not be because you want to save people and you reduced your initial price or you are afraid of increasing your price The earlier you understand this the faster you grow 4. Learn to keep your prospect even if they don't buy NOW There are some of people who are seeing what you do now they are studying you can this guy really solve my problem? will this product get me closer to my goal ?? Some of them might not buy now but you need to learn to keep them 5. Sales started right from your Ad Sales doesn't start when you ask them for money It started from the ad It started from the leaf magnet It started from your LinkedIn profile It started from your content All this process that you don't pay attention is indirectly taking your prospect through a buying process You are creating a perception I just gave you 5 of many Beliefs I explained in my course \"The Ultimate Guide to Online sales\" I believe you got value from this ? Tell me the part that stood out for you ? I remain Samuel Sobowale the guy that teaches courses creators and small business owners how to sell their products or service online and get more customers Till my next sermon, Thesalespreacher.\n\nSo you want to sell but don’t want to be sleazy? 🙌Hooray🙌 But what does sleazy sales actually mean? A lot of people do this weird nose-turn-up-scrunchy-face-like-you’ve-just-tasted-something-awful when you mention sales emails😳 A bit like my pic 🤦♀️ Let’s face it, just the word ‘sales’ evokes an emotional and physical response in most. 🚨It does not have to be that way!🚨 👉You really can sell WITHOUT the sleaze. 👉👉Through email. 👉👉👉Yep even through emails!! But first, what does sleazy sales actually mean?👇 🤮’BUY THIS NOW OR ELSE’ MESSAGING BEING THROWN IN YOUR FACE! 🤮Trying to CONVINCE someone to buy from you! 🤮Telling LIES to just get a sale! 🤮Being led by the MONEY and not the clients and their needs! 🤮Sneaky tactics to PRESSURE a purchase! 🤮ANYTHING yes ANYTHING that doesn’t align with your values and mission! You should never have to convince someone to purchase from you. If you’re trying to do that STOP. Instead, your first step to non-sleazy sales is to take a look at it from your ideal client’s position. ✅Build a relationship with them. ✅Take time to get to know them, their needs, challenges, barriers and desires. ✅Ask questions…then ask more. ✅Present solutions ✅Create opportunities All of this - and more - can be achieved through emails…and great copy. Pop me a DM to find out how I can help you do exactly that.\n\nAre you aware that you can skyrocket your revenue without getting new customers? You might think it's not possible to achieve that.🤔 But let me explain why you're mistaken. Trust is solely the most significant thing when it comes to selling information online.✅ The only gap between you and closing that sale is trust. For you to earn people's hard gotten money, you need to get them to trust you first. Take for instance you already have an audience that trusts you. It'll be very easy to get someone who has bought from you to buy again. And if you met their expectations, then surely you'll give them value on their next purchase.🔥 So you need to always pitch new offers to customers you already have.📌 This will help increase your (Average order value) AOV. And in turn boost your revenue without you needing to spend so much on getting new leads. How I do it is this way... ☑️ First I order my email in sections, then tag everyone who has purchased something from me. ☑️ On a monthly rotation, I sell them personalized emails that sell my new offers. ☑️ In doing this, I get to increase my revenue without needing to generate new leads. This is the best way to optimize your funnel for more sales.💰💰💰 Send me a DM let's get working on adding this to your funnel.☺️\n\nYour only true competition is yourself. In sales, it's easy to get caught up comparing yourself to others—be it colleagues or competitors. But at the end of the day, your biggest competition is really the person staring back at you in the mirror. Why? Because only you set your own limits. You're the one deciding how many calls to make, how deeply to understand your product, and how creatively to approach problem-solving. You can't control what others do, but you can control your own actions, attitude, and ambition. This is especially true in the fast-paced world of tech startups and founder-led service businesses, where adaptability and self-drive are key. It's not just about hitting the current target; it's about setting yourself new goals, pushing your own boundaries, and continually looking to evolve who you are as a professional. So if you feel you are plateauing, don't immediately look outward for something to blame. Take a moment to reflect inward. Are you doing everything you can to improve, to be more efficient, to master your own mind? Odds are, there's room for 'you 2.0' to be even better. And that's where the real competition lies—in outdoing yesterday's version of yourself. The luxury with sales (and curse some might say) is that every day you get to go again…… With Q4 upon us, what are you doing to evolve into the next best version of yourself?

(This will 10x your sales overnight.) When I was a beginner in sales, I always presented my prospect with the least expensive offer first. I decided to go up in price gradually. But that was a mistake, because when I showed them other alternatives, which were higher in price, they looked even more expensive. I kept making this mistake until I learned about the contrast principle. “The contrast principle is a concept in psychology that explains how our perception of something is influenced by comparing it to something else.” After a lot of no's, I changed my approach. I presented my client with the most expensive offer first, then gradually came down. For example, if I wanted to sell my offer worth $200k, I first showed them the alternative with a few extra benefits worth $500k. The comparison made the first offer look less expensive and a better deal. To my surprise, I started signing more deals. Use this principle. Be confident and show the high-price item first, then come to the lower-priced one, and you will see the magic of the contrast principle playing in your favor. P.S.
