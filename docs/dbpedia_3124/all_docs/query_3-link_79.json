        "text": "What better way to look back at the highlights, lowlights and changes in videogames over the last ten years, than to ask the people who've been making the games? We got in touch with a host of high profile development folks, representing companies from all over the globe - Platinum Games and Capcom in Japan, Avalanche and Guerrilla Games in Europe, FreeStyleGames in the UK, Krome in Australia, and Blizzard, Turn 10 and Gearbox Software in the US. Plus plenty more. We asked them four questions each:\n\n- What were the most important changes over the last ten years?\n\n- What was the best game of the last ten years?\n\n- What was the best system of the last ten years?\n\n- What piece of tech had the biggest hype, but the poorest delivery?\n\nThe answers, needless to say, were very interesting indeed. Take it away, devs!\n\nWhat have been the most important changes in videogames, videogame technology and in the wider videogame industry, over the last ten years?\n\nJeremiah Slaczka (Co-Founder and Creative Director, 5TH Cell): This is an easy question for me, the availability of platforms. We went from devs only being able to make big budget console and PC games to opportunities in flash, iPhone and mobile, downloadable titles like XBLA/PSN/WiiWare, the PC casual market and even Facebook games. It's an incredible time to be a game developer or to try to get into the industry because you have so many avenues for success.\n\nJ. Allen Brack (Production for Director for World of Warcraft, Blizzard): From a technology standpoint I think the rise of multi-core processors as we hit the maximum speed on CPUs has really allowed PC games to do a lot more of what they wanted. The advent of – more or less – infinite, cheap hard drive space has allowed us to really explode the number and variety of assets that we have. That's certainly been a huge change from, let's say, the previous decade. Memory is far more cheap and plentiful than it ever has been in the past in a way that I think is very significant. So the hardware advances have really allowed developers to see a lot more of the vision that they've wanted to reach.\n\nDan Greenawalt (Game Director at Turn 10 Studios): I think one of the most important changes in videogames is the cultural embrace of gaming as a national pastime. As the videogames industry continues to grow and attract new audiences, interactive entertainment has become deeply engrained into modern life as an expression of how we spend our free time. And gaming's foray into \"personal expression\" has lead to two other huge innovations for our hobby: social media integration (e.g., Xbox LIVE, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and user-generated content. New audiences means new genres and ways for designers to craft experiences for a variety of players, while social media and UGC give videogames a rich connected ecosystem not really even possible just 5 years ago. The exciting thing is that I feel we're just in the very early evolutionary stages of social media and UGC integration in games – I can't wait to see what the next 5 years will bring.\n\nPaul Denning (Senior Gameplay Programmer, Rocksteady Studios): The boom of broadband has enabled us to really go to town on online features. Games with large player limits just weren't possible back on the old phone modems. This in turn led to another big improvement in gaming. Xbox Live. Microsoft's entry into the console world was so important. They came along with their vast knowledge built from years of PC development and launched Live. Sony in turn had no choice but to innovate to compete and that's great for everyone.\n\nKelly Zmak (President, Radical Entertainment): [Since 2006 it has been] the Wii and the new consumer audience it has found. Others changes include 3D graphics and its focus on realism, and the increase in casual/social gamers. [In terms of the wider videogame industry over the last ten years it has been] the decline of the PC retail market and the \"democratization\" of development tools for multiple platforms (i.e. - iPhone, Web, Flash, etc.).\n\nYoshinori Ono (Producer, Super Street Fighter IV, Capcom): The entry of Xbox in 2001 created the 'multiplatform' trend for the first time, and this was a refreshing concept for us, leaving much room for reconsiderations in the whole process of 'producing' a game, not specific to particular hardware. The Xbox set the bar for games to have high quality graphics and audio, and as a result lead the industry to rival TV and Films in the entertainment field. This has also brought a new era, increasing the importance of cash flow for development as the titles get larger and larger in scale.\n\nRandy Pitchford (President, Gearbox Software): Over the past 10 years, there have been a number of really big changes that have had a dramatic impact on the industry and which continue to influence the industry: connectivity, storage capacity, digital media, user generated content and user managed content. First, there's connectivity. Today, we can play with anyone, anywhere in the world via the internet. This connectivity allows for other opportunities to develop via specific social networks and digital distribution tools thus in turn creating a more direct relationship between the players and the game makers. Secondly, storage capacity and digital media technology has permitted us to store a life-time of audio, video, text and interactive entertainment into a device that can fit in the palm of my hand. These two significant changes converge and lead me into two other important aspects that have changed this industry: user generated content and user managed content. They have accelerated the rate of new ideas entering the entertainment space and they have amplified the volume of options we have for our creativity or amusement.\n\nDenby Grace (Senior Producer, 2K Games): Before technology became what is it today, videogames were a specialist area that required you to have some mad skills in hooking up your PC, sorting your connection, getting lobbying software etc. Now, online gaming is a huge mass market and it's become super accessible and easy to use for everyone. Moreover, due to the advancements in technology with broadband and accessibility in online services such as Xbox LIVE I'm able to sit here is San Francisco and fire up a game of FIFA against my old man who's in Europe at the press of the button… now that is sweet!\n\nHermen Hulst (Managing Director, Guerrilla Games): Wow, compared to what we have today it seems like there hardly was an industry ten years ago. I think one of the most important changes is the transition of the bulk of the industry from PC to console. This completely changed the dynamics of the industry. Another important change is the popularization of the subscription-based business model by World of Warcraft; it cemented the notion of games as a service, rather than a one off purchase. In terms of technology, I'd say the rapid development of the physics engine was an important change which greatly improved realism in games.\n\nJamie Jackson (Creative Director, FreeStyleGames): For the videogame part, choice! 10 years ago the videogame market was still very much a hardcore, some would say geeky, pastime. Girlfriends thought you too childish if you played videogames. Now, you have to fight them for the Wiimote! Now, we have so much choice in the industry as to what we want to consume. Yes, the industry is still producing unbelievable hardcore games, with amazing graphics, complex control systems and ragingly hard difficulties, but you can also just play table tennis with your mum, or Frisbee with your 3 year old nephew. Through choice, our industry has matured (a little) and is now considered shoulder to shoulder with movies as a source of home entertainment.\n\nTechnology wise, I think I am the most happy I have been about what we can do graphically, than I have in my 12 plus years in the business. We have the tools to truly make beautiful games. And this is a very important part of continuing to expand the business we love and work in. The success of animated films, from the likes of Pixar and Dreamworks, have, in my honest opinion, made it more acceptable to appreciate games, which in turn has shown newcomers that games are no longer just for solo geeks in their bedrooms.\n\nGed Talbot (Lead Designer, Bizarre Creations): Online gaming – Since the early part of this decade all videogame consoles and nearly all games have included built in internet connectivity. This more than anything else has dramatically changed the nature of gaming. Playing games has now become a much more social experience than it was ten years ago which has come as a direct result of the move from Dial up internet connections to broadband.\n\nChris Pickford (Associate Producer, Bizarre Creations): For me it's got to be acceptance. For years videogames were classed as an incredibly niche hobby – a 'geeky' pastime to those who didn't play them. Now our industry is regularly grossing more than Hollywood films – and the media industry as a whole has completely turned around on its pre-millennium opinion. When you're being talked about in parliament on a regular basis you know that you've hit the mainstream.\n\nPeter Johansson (Lead Game Designer, Avalanche): I think the most important change to gaming is that it has diversified and broadened its appeal so much. It has finally transitioned from being seen primarily as a somewhat geeky children and teen pastime to a cultural phenomenon for everyone. If anyone would have told me 10 years ago that my mother would own a game console in 2009 I wouldn't have believed it.\n\nSteve Stamatiadis (Creative Director, Krome): The biggest change has to be the focus on connectivity and social interaction. Services like Xbox Live and the general ubiquity of the internet has made it possible for players to easily connect to other players. It's really changed the landscape of gaming in a good way.\n\nAlso the mainstream incursion into gaming is another important milestone. Though I really can't say if it's a good or bad thing just yet, there's the worry that hard core gamers will be neglected while publishers look to the larger sales they hope to get from a bigger audience. I'm hoping that there's plenty of room for both eventually and everyone can get to enjoy their favorite types of games.\n\nHideki Kamiya (Game Director, Platinum Games): Gaming has come to be broadly considered as one of many entertainments, not a subculture in a closed world. It is an interesting evolution that some consoles are now accepted by families. However, gaming culture is still developing, and I hope all of the games and the surroundings become [more] mature as time goes by.\n\nWhat do you personally believe is the greatest gaming system of the last ten years and why?\n\nJeremiah Slaczka (Co-Founder and Creative Director, 5TH Cell): This question is a bit more difficult. There are just too many great games on too many systems. I really loved the Dreamcast which came out in '99, but had a run in the 2000's. The PS2 had so many awesome titles, so it's hard to ignore that. The DS is the unsung hero of the generation with such massive sales and titles.\n\nJ. Allen Brack (Production for Director for World of Warcraft, Blizzard): Well, I am a big fan of PC. I was raised on PC gaming. I've always been a console fan – I've had consoles and I have consoles right now, but I really appreciate the flexibility that the PC has; I really appreciate the power that the PC has over a lot of the consoles, and of course I think that for many games and many types of games the keyboard and mouse is a superior control mechanism...\n\nDan Greenawalt (Game Director at Turn 10 Studios): Although this may not be what you had in mind with the concept of a \"gaming system\", I think Xbox LIVE has been an incredible \"platform\" for games that are LIVE-enabled. Not only for all of the social media and UGC reasons… but Xbox LIVE's ability to champion the underdog indie games and developers out there really levels the playing field and is healthy for the industry in general.\n\nPaul Denning (Senior Gameplay Programmer, Rocksteady Studios): In terms of use I've never been far from my Game Boy and my DS. The latter specifically would get my vote. You can point at the Wii as a very accessible console that can be enjoyed by all but when I look around everyone has a DS. My Gran has never played a game in her life yet we bought her a DS for Xmas last year and she never puts it down. It bridges the generation gap. We're now at a stage where pretty much everyone in the western world has had some exposure to games. It's helping us ditch the spotty geek image that gaming had and it's moved it into the mainstream.\n\nKelly Zmak (President, Radical Entertainment): PlayStation 2 – It formed the \"PlayStation Generation\" and set a new standard for games, changed the way games were made, and became the most popular gaming system of the decade.\n\nYoshinori Ono (Producer, Super Street Fighter IV, Capcom): This is hard to answer since my personal opinion is a mix of both creator and consumer, but my Japanese consumer part says I was very excited about Game Boy Advance which made my commutation pleasurable.\n\nAs a unique culture, Japan has the ultra packed rush hour train which literally is a living hell to be in. Game Boy Advance changed this living hell into a temporary oasis with games that almost equalled the quality of console gaming experiences back then!\n\nAs a creator I'm still adamant that Dreamcast from 1998 (just a bit over 10 years!) was a brilliant hardware. It had everything a gaming consoled needed – development kit, API, good tools… I recall that I could design games very freely without difficulty. It is a shame no console has its heritage to date.\n\nRandy Pitchford (President, Gearbox Software): Launched in 1999, the Sega Dreamcast system was very far ahead of its time. Its controller design represented the biggest interface evolution since the original D-pad was introduced by Nintendo with the 8-bit NES. Today, new interfaces are driving a huge percentage of the industry, especially for customers new to gaming. Additionally, the way the Dreamcast anticipated connectivity and storage to be relevant future components of the gaming industry was remarkable. I believe that the Dreamcast was just too far ahead of its time. Perhaps some different positioning and later timing could've made all the difference for this greatest of gaming systems.\n\nDenby Grace (Senior Producer, 2K Games): Xbox LIVE, as a service, has to be up there in the way it's revolutionized online gaming but also in how it's bringing smaller \"Arcade\" games to the masses. PS2 as a system also packed some punches: God of War, Ico, GTA III… so many great games.\n\nHermen Hulst (Managing Director, Guerrilla Games): To me, the greatest gaming system is the one that's been the most successful this decade. I believe the PlayStation 2 still wears that mantle – it has by far the largest and most varied game library of any home console released in the last ten years.\n\nJamie Jackson (Creative Director, FreeStyleGames): Xbox. Not for its power or technology, but because it came out and offered a challenge that has stood up! The PlayStation really changed the way games are consumed. It changed the format, introduced more powerful graphics engines and turned games from a \"geeky\" past time to something that became part of your living room and home entertainment.\n\nPS2 was always going to happen and it was always going to be great, but in my honest opinion to truly develop you must have competition and the Xbox did exactly that. It stood toe to toe with the PS2, some might even say surpassed it. For me both consoles delivered a very capable platform to make games on and pushed us as developers to get the best from each.\n\nGed Talbot (Lead Designer, Bizarre Creations): Xbox – As it almost single handedly re-wrote the template for online gaming with Xbox Live. While online gaming had been first done on consoles with the Dreamcast, the Xbox took social gaming to a new level by giving players a unique permanent identity that they could use to play games and interact with friends with. Added to this was the ability to download demos and videos of upcoming games which has fundamentally changed the way the public is introduced to new games coming onto the market.\n\nPeter Johansson (Lead Game Designer, Avalanche): I would like to say the Dreamcast, but that was in '99 and I know in my gut it's just nostalgia speaking. I think I must say the Xbox 360 because of how it feels like a pure gaming system of old, with power we could only dream of 10 years ago and great online integration for both single and multi player.\n\nSteve Stamatiadis (Creative Director, Krome): While there's been better technology since, I'd have to say the PlayStation 2. I think its sheer numbers of units and longevity are things to be admired. A lot of developers complained about how hard it was to develop for but that little beast could do some great things once you got your head around how it worked. If there wasn't the big push to High Definition, I think it would still be going strong.\n\nHideki Kamiya (Game Director, Platinum Games): I don't have one specific console to which I was attracted especially. I'd absolutely give the first prize if there were a system on which every game including former titles can be played. The advance of consoles is wonderful, but it's a shame that now we abandon the legacies of the past. Can't we play classic games after the further evolution of consoles? I strongly feel the game industry is immature in this regard compared with other entertainment forms such as film.\n\nWhat do you personally think is the greatest game of the last ten years and why?\n\nJeremiah Slaczka (Co-Founder and Creative Director, 5TH Cell): Again, an impossible question to answer. So many games have done so many different things right in so many genres. WoW ushered in a renewed era of the MMO and still remains king after five years. Ten years is a long time, so much has changed in games during that time frame. We saw games like Grand Theft Auto III explode the open-world genre. Guitar Hero created a new buzz in the console music space. There are too many awesome titles to name just one.\n\nJ. Allen Brack (Production for Director for World of Warcraft, Blizzard): Certainly the game I've played the most over the last ten years has been World of Warcraft. I have put a huge amount of time, both as a player and as a developer, into the game... so it's certainly the game I've played and enjoyed the most over the last ten years. But there's a lot of [other] games... I think Prince of Persia: Sands of Time was probably my favourite game on the PlayStation 2... I thought the combat system was good, but not too heavy, I felt it had a really good level of progression, and I liked the mix of the combat to the puzzles.\n\nDan Greenawalt (Game Director at Turn 10 Studios): It's a tough question but I'll have to go with Half-Life as the most important, if not the greatest, game of the past decade. The beauty of Half-Life is that the game sprang to life from the ambitions of Quake II community modders and map makers, and in turn, the success of the Half-Life engine itself has given birth to countless other community-created endeavors like Counter-Strike, Red Orchestra, and more. That same evolutionary path has led to innovative and diverse experiences such as Portal and Left 4 Dead. It's an incredible story of community success feeding back into the community to create even more amazing experiences.\n\nPaul Denning (Senior Gameplay Programmer, Rocksteady Studios): This might be a controversial one but I think SingStar has a good shot at being the best game of the last ten years. It's not a game a hardcore gamer would choose but it's popular and was the first of the casual games to make it big. Once SingStar came out there was suddenly a new type of party that people were throwing. The 'SingStar' party. 4 years or so on and we're now having Rock Band and Guitar Hero parties because of their singing element too.\n\nKelly Zmak (President, Radical Entertainment): PC - World of Warcraft – It has outperformed all expectations, and merges online, social, action and RPG into a single gaming experience. Console – the GTA series – It established the \"open-world\" genre, changed development approach and expectation, and raised the bar of product quality.\n\nYoshinori Ono (Producer, Super Street Fighter IV, Capcom): Probably GTA III released in 2001. The real 3D designed open world was a true sensation. Inafune-san and I were saying then that that was where we wanted to take Mega Man Dash. I can't give the game enough praise - it created the free-style play and still kept the atmosphere established in GTA I and II. The media predominantly focused on its crime aspect of the in-game gameplay, but the real gem of this title is the influence and the impact it gave other game designers.\n\nRandy Pitchford (President, Gearbox Software): World of Warcraft is the first video game to turn a single application into a long-term hobby. It's been five years since launch and the World of Warcraft user base is still peaking. Moreover, this loot-driven game-play seems to still have a strong hold over people's lives. As much love as I have for each of the great blockbuster video games that are released every year nothing has been as great as the World of Warcraft in terms of influence in peoples' lives.\n\nDenby Grace (Senior Producer, 2K Games): I really enjoyed Ico. It was such a breath of fresh air when it came out. It was absolutely stunning in look, had amazing settings and atmosphere. Then, from a design point of view the mechanics and relationship between the boy and Yorda were also very well thought out.\n\nHermen Hulst (Managing Director, Guerrilla Games): I'm torn between Grand Theft Auto 3 and Half-Life 2. Grand Theft Auto 3 not only invented sandbox gaming but also proved a breakthrough for the industry as a whole, setting blockbuster sales records and turning game launches into highly anticipated media events. Half-Life 2, on the other hand, made the first-person shooter genre grow up. It wasn't so much about game design innovation as it was about raising the bar in all areas. After Half-Life 2, FPS games weren't just about shooting anymore - they had to be adventures as well, including superb visuals, great dialogue, gripping storylines, and so on.\n\nGed Talbot (Lead Designer, Bizarre Creations): GTA Vice City... The main reason that I have so much love for that game was in the way it brought the feel of being set in a very specific and recognisable period of time. From the vehicles to the main characters the game oozed 80s vibe and it was topped off with probably the best videogame soundtrack of all time. Being a thirtysomething guy who loves gangster films like Carlito's Way and Scarface it is impossible to play Vice City without getting completely into character and becoming one with the game.\n\nPeter Johansson (Lead Game Designer, Avalanche): I'm going to cop out and select two. First, Super Mario Galaxy for how it provides pure fun no matter what your age is. Second, Half-Life 2 for its great atmosphere, perfect pacing, and fantastic storytelling that creates a near perfect package.\n\nSteve Stamatiadis (Creative Director, Krome): World of Warcraft – Five years strong and it still has the pulling power to make me want to go back and play it after I've sworn off it for three years so I can have some time to do other things outside of work. I know I'm not the only one. The game is a great testament to fun evolving design that didn't rely on crazy graphics tech to sell it. Designed to push all the right buttons of its players to keep them involved it works on so many levels and that's why it has so many followers. The trick is how do I keep myself from returning with the next expansion pack? The game's ongoing revenues say volumes about its popularity; last year Blizzard was billing $150 million dollars (US) a month in worldwide monthly subscription fees.\n\nWhat piece of technology or idea over the last ten years had the biggest hype… which resulted in the poorest delivery?\n\nJeremiah Slaczka (Co-Founder and Creative Director, 5TH Cell): I know you want me to say Wii, but I won't. The Wii has done so much for gaming even if it's shifted a bit away from the core gamer. Motion controls will only continue to be refined, Avatars, new types of gameplay experiences; all were ushered in by the Wii. The Wii to me feels like the NES of its day. It had R.O.B. and the lightgun and the running pad and Powerglove all which were too far ahead of their time, but laid the groundwork for future console innovation.\n\nJ. Allen Brack (Production for Director for World of Warcraft, Blizzard): Certainly one of the things on that list has got to be the Phantom console. I [also] think we've gone through a lot of controllers in the last ten years, but that's [true of] the previous ten years [too] – different ways to try and make a better keyboard and mouse combination: some of them succeeded, but many are failures. I think 3D glasses are something that we try every few years. I think that [right now] it's actually better than it's ever been, so maybe we're on the cusp of the 3D revolution, I don't know – it'll be interesting to see where we are in two years with 3D... I feel like that's one of those things that we've tried many times. I've evaluated – over my gaming career – half a dozen 3D technologies, right, and all of them, after fifteen minutes, make your eyes bleed. So not quite to the level it needs to be, but certainly that's something that we're going to solve.\n\nDan Greenawalt (Game Director at Turn 10 Studios): Mobile network gaming (i.e., cell phone games, not handheld console gaming) were heavily hyped to be the next big thing 5 or 6 years ago, but all that we had to show for it at the time were the Nokia N-Gage and the amazing-it-was-ever-manufactured Gizmondo device. The data infrastructure and hardware at the time just wasn't ready for gaming primetime. It's taken some time but I think we're just starting to see mobile gaming come into its own in North America over the past couple of years. However, it's not the same experience that was hyped with the N-Gage. Today's mobile games are smaller, more casual. And while they are very connected, the nature of this connection is more social than competitive. It really is in its infancy now and I'm interested to see how mobile games shatter their limitations over the course of the next few years.\n\nPaul Denning (Senior Gameplay Programmer, Rocksteady Studios): There are so many choices! In my mind there's one clear winner and that's mobile gaming. Handheld tech has come so far in 10 years but the games are still so poor. There have even been dedicated mobile game systems and they've still failed because of really poor design and implementation. Apple's entry to the market has helped. A mainstream platform to develop for has brought about more impressive games but we're still held back by their content delivery system. The sheer volume of applications is now a barrier to entry.\n\nKelly Zmak (President, Radical Entertainment): Hard to say, but maybe Gizmondo and/or the N-Gage.\n\nYoshinori Ono (Producer, Super Street Fighter IV, Capcom): N-Gage. It had all one could have hoped for as a 21st century gadget – but it didn't quite turn out as hoped for. However, I believe the possibility it had indicated was taken up by the iPhone in 2007. I honestly think the iPhone is a conceptual continuation of N-Gage in some way.\n\nRandy Pitchford (President, Gearbox Software): I can't help but recall the \"Phantom\" console that was being heavily pushed several years ago. The whole thing, from the name of the device to the stories about the people behind the system, we couldn't help but follow it while feeling a sense of shadiness. It was never released but in retrospect, the fundamental promise of the \"Phantom\" seems to be right on the money when considering what other platforms are now doing along the lines of digital distribution. I think the fundamental problem for the \"Phantom\" was that it was offered out of thin air. The purveyors did not have the established credibility from the start that they needed in order to bring us something so new.\n\nDenby Grace (Senior Producer, 2K Games): In my opinion the most useless advancement in gaming has to be motion controllers. I play games because I am: a) Too lazy and cannot be bothered to do the activities featured in the game for real, or b) simply because I have no access to military weapons, machine guns, swords and explosives etc. So the last thing I want to do is sit on my couch at home, in my pants wafting my pseudo sword at some elf that is hiding behind a rock.\n\nHermen Hulst (Managing Director, Guerrilla Games): I would have loved to be able to say Wii Fit, but there clearly is a market for it. So I'll pick the Gizmondo instead: it was feature packed, but it proved to be an absolute lemon.\n\nJamie Jackson (Creative Director, FreeStyleGames): Without a doubt Gizmondo… though that is probably too easy an answer.\n\nPeter Johansson (Lead Game Designer, Avalanche): The original N-Gage gaming phone had so many fundamental design errors that made it useless both as a phone and gaming device.\n\nSteve Stamatiadis (Creative Director, Krome): The PSP really looked a great piece of tech – a handheld that was almost as powerful as a PS2 that could play movies and more. Sadly, even though I was a big fan of the handheld, it just never managed to capture anyone's imagination the way the DS or iPhone have for handheld gaming. A huge thanks to all the developers who took part in our discussion - your time and thoughts are very greatly appreciated!"
