Now, it's buried under the sand.\n\nKolmanskop was at its liveliest in the early 1900s, when German miners came to the area to hunt for diamonds. With them, they brought German architecture, giving the desert area an opulent, out-of-place look. The town featured a ballroom, a hospital, and a bowling alley among other amenities.\n\nThe town's decline began shortly after World War I, but the final nail in the coffin was the 1928 discovery of a diamond-rich area along the coast. Most of Kolmanskop's residents hurried to the new hotspot, leaving their belongings and the town behind.\n\nThe desert has slowly been taking over Kolmanskop ever since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe United Kingdom's Maunsell Sea & Air Forts in the Thames and Mersey estuaries were built to defend the country against German forces.\n\nDuring World War II, the Maunsell Army Sea & Air Forts was a group of forts raised above the water on stilts, designed by Guy Maunsell, a British civil engineer.\n\nThe forts officially closed in the 1950s, but the structures that remain can occasionally be seen from land at East Beach Park in Southend-on-Sea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoss Island was a British settlement on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India before it was abandoned due to an earthquake.\n\nVegetation has all but consumed the remains of the island, which was once referred to as the \"Paris of the East.\" In its prime, it was home to British government officials, as well as a penal settlement set up after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The British residents made it their home with extravagant dance halls, bakeries, clubs, pools, and gardens until 1941 brought an earthquake and an invasion by the Japanese.\n\nRoss Island was then alternately claimed by the Japanese and British until 1979 when the island was given to the Indian Navy, which established a small base there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Graun Church Tower in Lake Reschen, Italy, was literally drowned.\n\nGraun Church on Lake Reschen in South Tyrol, Italy, was once a regular Italian church. However, an artificial lake was built in 1950 in order to provide the town with electricity, drowning the historic church, 160 homes, and forcing its residents to leave.\n\nAll that remained visible for years was the church's bell tower — which looked like it was floating in the waters — until 2021, when the lake was temporarily drained, revealing remnants of the village of Curon beneath.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Haludovo Palace Hotel was a luxurious retreat on the Mediterranean Sea in Krk, Croatia, in the 1970s.\n\nThis mid-century-style hotel opened in 1971, drawing visitors to the small Croatian island of Krk.\n\nA year later, the founder of Penthouse Magazine, Bob Guccione, invested $45 million in the property and expanded it, turning it into the lavish Penthouse Adriatic Club Casino.\n\nOnce the Yugoslav Wars began in the early 1990s, Krk was no longer a popular travel destination, and the hotel was eventually abandoned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBannerman Castle in Beacon, New York, was once a lavish home. Now, only parts of the structure remain.\n\nLocated on Pollepel Island on the Hudson River, Bannerman Castle once acted as arms storage for Frank Bannerman, a Scottish munitions dealer in New York City. Bannerman and his wife eventually built a glamorous, castle-like home on the property, and resided there during the summer.\n\nAfter a powder explosion in 1920, several fires, and various changes in ownership, the castle is not the breathtaking sight it once was, but Bannerman's name can still be seen plastered on what remains of its facade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPripyat, Ukraine, was evacuated following the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986.\n\nOn April 26, 1986, a radioactive release 10 times bigger than the nuclear bomb on Hiroshima occurred at the Chernobyl nuclear power station. Around 350,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes, leaving in such a haste that the city looks like it's frozen in time.\n\nDolls are scattered on the floors of abandoned kindergartens; shreds of sheets and pillows remain on beds, and dishes rot in sinks. Radiation levels in the city are still too high for people to live there, so it remains untouched.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMilitary Hospital in Beelitz, Germany, once treated Adolf Hitler. These days, it's a crumbling building.\n\nThis eerie military hospital once treated Nazi leader Adolf Hitler for a thigh injury he acquired during a WWI battle in late 1916.\n\nIt was built in the late 19th century to help rehabilitate tuberculosis patients in Berlin but was later abandoned during the fall of East Germany.\n\nThe chilling building was used as a set for the Oscar-winning film, \"The Pianist.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonestown, Guyana, has been taken over by the dense jungle.\n\nJonestown, Guyana, was the location of one of the most shocking tragedies in American history, as 909 members of the People's Temple died from cyanide poisoning at the direction of a cult leader.\n\nThe village where the cult resided is now mostly covered in dense jungle vegetation, although a few structures still remain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe abandoned City Hall subway stop in New York City was originally built to impress.\n\nCompleted in 1904, City Hall station was the first southern terminal of the first line of the New York City subway. Built to impress New Yorkers with their swanky new mode of transportation, the station featured Roman brick walls, brass chandeliers, and vaulted arches.\n\nIt closed in 1945 as it could no longer accommodate the growing ridership, but apparently you can still see it if you stay on the 6 train after its last stop, on its way back uptown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuzludzha Monument in Bulgaria was once the House of the Bulgarian Communist Party.\n\nIn power during the height of Soviet influence, the Bulgarian Communist Party decided to erect the monument to commemorate socialist communism. However, the site was abandoned after the government's fall from power in 1989.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimacem in North Sumatra, Indonesia, was abandoned because of the threat of a volcanic eruption.\n\nAfter 400 years of dormancy, Indonesia's Mount Sinabung has been erupting in recent years, causing various villages on its slopes to be evacuated. They remain abandoned, declared too dangerous to inhabit. Simacem is one such town, and today, it's filled with the remains of lives hastily left behind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLynch, Kentucky, was once considered the largest coal camp in the world. Now, it's abandoned.\n\nAt its peak, Lynch, Kentucky, had 10,000 residents — the most people any coal camp had in the world. It even had its own power plant, which was built in 1919. However, as coal declined, so did the city, and the plant — and most of Lynch — now sits abandoned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe abandoned submarine base in Balaklava, Ukraine, was once top secret.\n\nThis abandoned aquatic facility was originally built by the USSR as a top-secret plant designed to house a fleet of nuclear-ready, Soviet submarines during the Cold War.\n\nThe complex remained untouched for a long time until the Russian Federation gifted the abandoned base to the Ukrainian Navy in 2000. It is now a museum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHumberstone, Chile, was left so suddenly that it appears frozen in time.\n\nHumberstone is a former English saltpeter mining town in the Atacama Desert. Synthetic nitrate invented during WWI replaced saltpeter, meaning that the facilities were no longer needed.\n\nPeople fled the town abruptly, leaving behind pictures that still hang on walls and closets still filled with clothes.\n\nIn 2005, Humberstone was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite being made of wood, Rum Orphanage in Turkey still stands today.\n\nThis large wooden building on Büyükada, off the coast of Turkey, was originally designed to be a luxury hotel and casino. However, due to issues with permits, the building was sold and eventually turned into an orphanage in the early 20th century.\n\nThe approximately 215,000 square foot building is reportedly the largest historic timber building in Europe, according to the World Monuments Fund.\n\nAfter ending operations as an orphanage in 1964, the building remained unoccupied for decades. In 2012, restoration began to turn the site into an environmental institute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe city of Pompeii, Italy, was discovered buried beneath dirt and debris.\n\nOne of the most famous eruptions of all time, Mount Vesuvius' 79 A.D. eruption completely buried the ancient Roman city of Pompeii under a thick blanket of volcanic ash.\n\nThe city was abandoned for nearly 2,000 years until explorers discovered it fully intact underneath 20 feet of dirt and debris in 1748.\n\nMany of the abandoned structures are still standing today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouston Astrodome in Houston, Texas, was once a bustling arena, but no one can agree on a revitalization plan today.\n\nThe world's first domed stadium, The Astrodome, has been abandoned since the Houston Astros baseball team left it in 2003.\n\nA staple of Houston's city skyline, the stadium remains abandoned, but it has state and national protection, so it won't be torn down. Instead, groups continue to propose ideas for what it could be next, KVUE reported in 2022, including one idea for the area to be turned into a park beneath the building's steel framework.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Mys Aniva lighthouse in Sakhalin Island, Russia, has stood since the 1940s.\n\nAniva is a coastal town on Russia's Sakhalin Island, near Japan. The Mys Aniva lighthouse sits on the rocky coastline, abandoned and worn down.\n\nThe lighthouse was built by Japanese engineers in 1939 and was used by both Japanese and Russian militaries over the years.\n\nThe site is popular today among urban explorers, some of whom have found belongings of people who once lived in the lighthouse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia was once a revolutionary prison and became the most famous in the world.\n\nThe spooky Eastern State Penitentiary was once the most famous prison in the world, but now stands in ruins. It once held many of America's most notorious criminals, including \"Slick Willie\" Sutton, an American bank robber, \"Scarface\" Al Capone, the Chicago mob boss, and Freda Frost, a female inmate who poisoned her husband.\n\nToday, the prison is a museum.\n\nSt. Nicholas Church in Mavrovo Lake, Macedonia, is sometimes semi-submerged in water.\n\nThe Saint Nicholas Church was built in 1850 but has been abandoned for about 100 years. When Lake Mavrovo, which is manmade, was created, a dam filled the surrounding area with water. However, since the area has experienced droughts in recent years, it is possible for visitors to enter the ruins of the church.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dome homes near Marco Island in Florida once stood on the beach, but they've been pushed out to the ocean.\n\nThese concrete dome-shaped structures may look futuristic, but they're actually just the vacation home of a retired oil producer.\n\nBob Lee built the dome homes in 1981 as an environmentally friendly and self-contained getaway for his family on Marco Island, Florida.\n\nWhile the pods once stood on their concrete pylons right on the beach, erosion has resulted in their current location in the ocean. In 2022, Hurricane Ian destoryed what was left of the homes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe City Methodist Church in Gary, Indiana, is so creepy that's it's been used as a set for horror movies.\n\nThe crash of the steel industry hit Gary, Indiana, hard in the 1970s. This economic depression resulted in the abandonment of many once-popular buildings, including the City Methodist Church.\n\nThe church reportedly cost a whopping $1 million to build back in 1926, which would be about $7 million by today's standards. However, despite all the work that went into building the beautiful English Gothic-style church, the parish officially closed in 1975.\n\nSince its closure, the City Methodist Church has not gone entirely untouched. The site has acted as a shooting location for several movies, including \"A Nightmare on Elm Street,\" \"Transformers 3,\" and \"Pearl Harbor.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Waverly Hills Sanatorium in Louisville, Kentucky, is believed to be haunted.\n\nThe Waverly Hills Sanatorium acted as a hospital in which patients with tuberculosis were quarantined in the early 1900s, although the building that still stands today was not completed until 1926.\n\nThe hospital operated until 1961 when an antibiotic that cured tuberculosis was discovered. Today, many people believe that the site is haunted. Visitors can participate in ghost tours, haunted houses, and laser light shows on the hospital grounds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Sathorn Unique Building, or \"Ghost Tower,\" in Bangkok, Thailand, is a popular destination for urban explorers.\n\nCommonly known as the \"Ghost Tower,\" the Sathorn Unique Building in Bangkok is an abandoned skyscraper that's shrouded in mystery.\n\nThe luxury high-rise was built in the 1990s, although construction was abruptly halted upon the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. As a result, the building has fallen into decay and has become a haven for urban explorers. The inside of the tower is covered in graffiti.\n\nWhile climbing to the top of the building is really dangerous, visitors can still get a glimpse inside from the ground floor of a nearby parking garage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyugyong Hotel in Pyongyang, North Korea, is the tallest unoccupied building in the world.\n\nAt 105 stories with a striking triangular shape, the Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang towers over much of the city.\n\nConstruction on the building began in 1989 with plans of containing Japanese lounges, casinos, and night clubs.

However, after a fire at a landfill spread to several local mines, the town became uninhabitable.\n\nAs the fire grew, it moved through the mines and underneath the town, creating health safety issues for residents.\n\nToday, Centralia is completely abandoned, although it is full of eerily empty streets, houses, and businesses. You can still see steam rising from the ground in many areas, including on an abandoned strip of road that has become known as \"Graffiti Highway.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cabins in abandoned Garnet, Montana, are miraculously still standing.\n\nMany mining towns were built quickly and cheaply in order to allow miners to start working as soon as possible.

There are campgrounds nearby for people looking to get an overnight experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCraco, Italy, survived earthquakes and landslides before being abandoned in 1991.\n\nThis hillside ghost town was founded in the 8th century and sits on a cliff that's 1,312 feet off the ground. The city emptied due to various natural disasters. In 1963, many evacuated after a landslide; in 1972, a flood made conditions even more precarious; and in 1980, an earthquake caused the town to be abandoned in its entirety.\n\nA locked gate surrounds the city, so visitors must book a guided tour.

If you visit Rhyolite now, you'll see the remains of the bank, the town jail, and the restored Bottle House, a house made from 50,000 glass beer bottle bottoms.

In 1903, Shaniko became known as the \"Wool Capital of the World,\" and for a good reason: The small town alone exported over 2,000 tons of wool, which brought it about $3 million in revenue.\n\nThe town's success was brief. Once considered a hub for train passengers, much of its success was dependent on the influx of travelers who came through Shaniko's train station.
