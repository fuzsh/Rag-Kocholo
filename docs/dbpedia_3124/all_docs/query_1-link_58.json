        "text": "This film is cinematic genius. The plot, the cast, the mise-en-scene – everything was perfect for me. Last week while I was in bed I randomly decided to watch it on Netflix. I never had any desire to watch this movie, little did I know I was about to watch one of my new favourites.\n\nThe film takes inspiration from famous gangster Al Capone, and portrays the story of Tony Montana who comes to America as a political refugee off a ‘banana boat’ with nothing more than his best friend, Manny Ribera, and the clothes on his back. Manny is the pretty one, Tony isn’t nearly as physically attractive, but it’s Tony’s attitude and demeanour that makes his character irresistible to root for.\n\nI don’t want to give anything away, but watching this film makes me feel like I know what it’s like to be a Cuban cocaine brick-flipping gangster in 1980s America, who essentially came off a ‘banana boat’ with nothing but the clothes on his back. Michelle Pfeiffer and Al Pacino were perfectly casted to depict the fast-paced and tragic story of Cuban political refugee turned gangster, Tony Montana and the cocaine addicted trophy wife, Elvira Hancock. Michelle Pfeiffer was boots the house down giving cunt in every scene she was in. The fits were sophisticated, chic and continue to give inspiration to fashion today even decades after the movie was released.\n\nSome say the ending of the film is the perfect depiction of a mental unravelling. The themes of the film hold underlying messages of greed, friendship, love and money. Plus the aesthetic is just so satisfying and for the times. ‘Scarface’ has been referenced countless times within rap and hip hop culture. One of the more notable references of the film in rap culture is Chief Keef’s alias nickname ‘Sosa’ which is a reference to the drug kingpin character in the film, Alejandro Sosa. Watch this movie. There is a reason why it’s still relevant in the culture to this day.\n\nExamples of rappers referencing Scarface:\n\nA$AP Rocky – Babushka Boi\n\n‘The world is yours, Scarface, nigga’\n\nKanye West – Devil in a New Dress\n\n‘The crib Scarface couldn’t be more Tony\n\nYou love me for me could you be more phony’\n\nMigos – Antidope"
