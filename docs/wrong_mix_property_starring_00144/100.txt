Alan Arkin, the award-winning actor died. The Academy Award-winning actor was 89.

His death was confirmed to PEOPLE exclusively by his sons Adam, Matthew and Anthony.

“Our father was a uniquely talented force of nature, both as an artist and a man,” a family statement read. “A loving husband, father, grand and great grandfather, he was adored and will be deeply missed.”

Arkin won an Oscar for his role in “Little Miss Sunshine” as the foul-mouthed grandfather, but he began his career in theater.

He starred in films including “Edward Scissorhands” and “Argo.”

In recent years he starred opposite Michael Douglas in the Netflix comedy series “The Kominsky Method,” a role that earned him two Emmy nominations for supporting actor in a comedy series.

“When I was a young actor people wanted to know if I wanted to be a serious actor or a funny one,” Michael McKean tweeted Friday. ‘I’d answer ‘Which kind is Alan Arkin?’ and that shut them up.”

Arkin earned two Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and a Tony Award, in addition to the Oscar and British Academy Film Award that he collected for “Little Miss Sunshine.” He also received multiple Oscar nominations, including for his first film “The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming.”

Arkin was married three times and has three children. He and his first wife, Jeremy Yaffe, were wed for six years and had two sons, Adam and Matthew. The pair divorced in 1961. From 1964 to 1994, Arkin was wed to screenwriter and actress Barbara Dana, with whom he had son Anthony Dana Arkin. After their divorce, Arkin married Suzanne Newlander.
