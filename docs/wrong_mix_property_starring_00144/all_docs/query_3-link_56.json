        "text": "Matthew Bourne’s magical dance production of “Edward Scissorhands” has carved a place in the hearts of audiences worldwide since its premiere in 2005.\n\nBased on the classic Tim Burton movie and featuring the hauntingly beautiful music of Danny Elfman and Terry Davies, Bourne and his New Adventures Company return to this witty, bittersweet story of an incomplete boy left alone in a strange new world.\n\nFilmed live in March 2024 at the Wales Millenium Centre, Cardiff, this visually arresting and ceaselessly inventive production is the perfect treat for all the family.\n\nIn a castle high on a hill lives Edward; a boy created by an eccentric inventor. When his creator dies, he is left alone and unfinished with only scissors for hands until a kindly townswoman invites him to live with her suburban family. Can Edward find his place in the well-meaning community which struggles to see past his curious appearance to the innocence and gentleness within?\n\n“Stunning! Matthew Bourne’s magical dance version of the Tim Burton classic.” — Observer\n\n“A joyful theatre experience!” — WhatsOnStage\n\n“Enchanting!” — The Times\n\nDance in Cinema is generously sponsored by Rose Borne and Bonny Singer.\n\n“Edward Scissorhands: Matthew Bourne’s dance version of Tim Burton’s classic” will be shown at the Mary D. Fisher Theatre on Wednesday, Sept. 25 at 7:00 p.m. and Sunday, Sept. 29 at 4:00 p.m. Tickets are $15, or $13 for Film Festival members. For tickets and more information, please call 928-282-1177. Both the theatre and film festival office are located at 2030 W. Hwy. 89A, in West Sedona."
