        "text": "Synopsis\n\nOscar Award-winning actor Alan Arkin, famous for Little Miss Sunshine and The Kominsky Method, has died at 89. Here are some things to know about him.\n\nOscar Award-winning actor Alan Arkin passed away on June 29, 2023. He was 89. His representative Melody Korenbrot shared the news of his death with USA TODAY. The actor’s sons Adam, Matthew, and Anthony jointly shared a statement to People Magazine.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nUnion Budget and Economic Survey 2024 Live Updates\n\nEconomic Survey Highlights: Reading between the lines\n\nThe statement read: \"Our father was a uniquely talented force of nature, both as an artist and a man. A loving husband, father, grand grandfather, he was adored and will be deeply missed.\"\n\nAlan Arkin was recently seen in the first two seasons of Netflix’s The Kominsky Method, an award-winning series in which he played Norman, the agent of Michael Douglas' character of acting coach Sandy.\n\nAbout Alan Arkin\n\nAlan Arkin was born on March 26, 1934, in Brooklyn, New York, United States, in a Jewish family. His father was a writer and painter, and his mother was a teacher.\n\nAlan Arkin’s Oscar Awards\n\nAlan Arkin won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Little Miss Sunshine (2006 film) and was nominated four times, including two Best Actor nominations for The Russians Are Coming (1966 film) and The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (1968 film), and a Best Supporting Actor nod for Argo (2012).\n\nHowever, he did not think highly of the Oscars. \"I think it's all nonsense,\" Arkin had told USA TODAY before the Oscars 2013. \"The whole thing’s a cr*pshoot. If I look at the movies that won best movie over the last 50 years, 20 are ridiculous jokes,\" he opined.\n\nNot many know that Alan Arkin's directorial debut was the Oscar-nominated short children's film, People Soup, in 1969. The 12-minute film starred his sons Adam Arkin and Matthew Arkin as boys who create a magical soup with kitchen ingredients, which transforms them into animals or objects. People, Soup was based on Alan Arkin’s own story that was published in Galaxy Science Fiction in 1958.\n\nAlan Arkin despised the box office race in Hollywood. \"For the industry to treat us like horses, who’s in first or second, is insanity,\" he said at a Screen Actors Guild Foundation event in 2012.\n\nIn his early 20s, Arkin was a member of the folk group The Tarriers, whose The Banana Boat Song was a hit. After working in New York theater, he joined Second City, the now legendary improvisational group in Chicago. Second City performed in New York, and Arkin got noticed in Los Angeles and never looked back.\n\nAlan Arkin is survived by three sons from his first two marriages – aforementioned Anthony, Matthew, and Adam Arkin, who are actors – and his third wife, Suzanne Newlander, who is a psychotherapist.\n\nFAQs\n\nQ1:How did Alan Arkin die?\n\nOscar-winning actor Alan Arkin died on June 29, 2023, of heart ailments. He was 89 years old.\n\nQ2:What are Alan Arkin’s films?\n\nSome of Alan Arkin’s films include The Russians Are Coming, Catch-22, The Seven-Per-Cent Solution, Edward Scissorhands, Glengarry Glen Ross, Grosse Pointe Blank, Little Miss Sunshine, and The Kominsky Method web series.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
