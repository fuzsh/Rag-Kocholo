Struggling to gain the attention of her seemingly aloof father, Grace tags along with him to the golf range in hopes of scoring some quality bonding time. Meanwhile, Karen (Megan Mullally) keeps herself entertained with Martin's buddy, Burt Wolfe (guest star Lee Majors). Excited about the date that Jack (Sean Hayes) has arranged for him, Will (Eric McCormack) discovers the true meaning of the phrase \"blind date.\"\n\nTies That Bind\n\nA man creates problems for the hospital staff with his demands for instant and constant attention when his wife suffers a stroke. He drives his car straight through the front doors in his effort to get instant medical care for his wife. The staff has him hauled off to jail for refusing to leave the treatment room but he soon returns with more demands.\n\nLust Et Veritas\n\nJerry Singleton is still making life miserable for everyone in his effort to see that his wife Fran gets the best medical help. However, he is so overbearing that finally even his wife rebels against his dictatorial efforts to help her recover."
