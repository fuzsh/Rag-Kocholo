        "text": "The San Diego Film Festival has made great efforts to up its game in recent years. The last two seasons have featured such high-profile entries as “12 Years a Slave” and “Silver Linings Playbook,” and last year saw more than 15,000 attendees. This year’s festival, which opens Wednesday with the buzzy Reese Witherspoon movie “Wild,” and features a Saturday screening of Hilary Swank’s “You’re Not You,” has garnered even more popular movies from the festival circuit and beyond.\n\nBut it isn’t just bigger movies that are making this year’s SDFF different. On Thursday, SDFF teams up with Variety for its Night of the Stars event. Several cinema luminaries will be honored, including Alan Arkin, who will be presented with the inaugural Gregory Peck Award.\n\n“I guess Ben Kingsley wasn’t available,” cracks Arkin, a North County resident. “No, I’m really touched, particularly because I met Gregory Peck once, right after my first movie was made. It was a strange, funny encounter, and this puts a period on it.”\n\nThat film was “The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming,” the Cold War comedy that came out in 1966. The movie earned Arkin his first Oscar nomination, and in the intervening half-century, he’s gone on to appear in more than 70 movies, including “Catch-22,” “Wait Until Dark” and even “Edward Scissorhands.” Along the way, he’s earned three additional nominations and took home a Best Supporting Actor award in 2007 for “Little Miss Sunshine.”\n\n“When you look at his scope of work and the span of time, it’s remarkable,” says Tonya Mantooth, SDFF’s vice president of programming, who worked closely with the Peck family to create the award in honor of the Oscar-winning actor, who was born in La Jolla and graduated from San Diego High. “He was absolutely the perfect person to receive this first one. He’s done ironic comedy, serious drama and poignant, touching roles, and he crosses genres with such ease. He’s a very unique actor.”\n\nSays Arkin: “I’ve done serious things and I’ve done comedy. My favorite thing to do is serious comedy, a comedy that has some pertinence to the human condition or some kind of social significance.”\n\nOne of the highlights of his career, he says, was the response to “The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter,” the 1968 adaptation of the Carson McCullers book, in which he played the lead role, a deaf mute.\n\n“I got letters from a handful of people who said they had deaf people in their family and that the movie made me see what they’re going through from the inside,” he says. “That was deeply meaningful to me. To open somebody’s eyes is one of the most wonderful things a person can do. I like to feel that I’ve done that maybe a half a dozen times in my career.”\n\nArkin has worked on projects big and small over the course of his career, and he’s seen the landscape of the film industry change over time.\n\n“Film is a microcosm of the whole culture,” he says. “When they talk about the perilous state of Hollywood, it’s always an indication of where the culture is. Unless you’re a genius, what you’re doing reflects the culture that you’re in. Geniuses have a way of transcending the culture, but we don’t have a lot of geniuses working right now.”\n\nThat isn’t to say he thinks all of today’s movies are particularly bad — he earned his latest Oscar nomination just two years ago for “Argo,” the 2012 Best Picture winner, after all — but Arkin says the movies coming out of Europe feel more personal than those being made in Hollywood.\n\n“Films have gotten very corporate,” he says. “I see an endless amount of really good work, good acting, good directing and good writing, but they’re mostly predictable. I feel like I can’t see individual’s hands in them so much. I forget a great many films the day after I see them, because they’re like products, rather than expressions of somebody’s inner vision or concerns.”\n\nArkin, who did not see the recent theatrical adaptation of “Little Miss Sunshine,” says that of his long résumé, “There’s eight or nine that I’m not embarrassed to look at.” He names “The Russians Are Coming,” of course, as well as “Little Murders,” a film he directed, “The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter,” “The In-Laws” and “Little Miss Sunshine.”\n\nAnd while it’s been a lengthy, rewarding career, Arkin, who turned 80 earlier this year, isn’t ready to retire.\n\n“Almost everybody I know who has done anything creative has a restlessness about them,” he says. “There’s another mountain they haven’t climbed yet. That’s certainly very much the way I feel. It’s very touching and sweet that they want to give me a lifetime achievement award, and it makes me appreciate that I pulled something over on somebody yet again.”"
