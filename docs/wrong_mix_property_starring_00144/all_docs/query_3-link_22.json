        "text": "Although it's weird to think about, Johnny Depp used to be a teenage heartthrob - the Justin Bieber of the late '80s and '90s. Luckily for Depp and Burton's lifelong friendship, Burton had never seen an episode of 21 Jump Street.\n\n\"I didn't really know who he was,\" said Burton. \"I hadn't really seen him in anything. So I met him sort of cold, at a coffee shop. And that was almost the best kind of thing, because I had no preconception of him as an actor,\" he said.\n\n\"That first meeting, I knew he was the right person for it. Just because he seemed to be somebody who was, like, trapped in that, whatever 21 Jump Street thing - but that wasn't him. So he just felt like the character, you know? Somebody who was perceived as one thing and is actually something else.\"\n\nSource: iSchoolGuide\n\nScreenwriter Caroline Thompson confirmed in an interview that the role of Edward Scissorhands was actually based on her smart, eager dog.\n\n“[Johnny] was just so confused about [Edward], I said, ‘Well, the character is actually based on my dog, and if you imagine a dog that is so present and so eager and so smart…that’s that character.’ And he got it instantly. Shazam,\" she said.\n\nSource: Popsugar"
