        "text": "by Nathaniel R\n\nSince our Dumbo review didn't soar, or even materialize at all (oops), we should definitely turn some attention to Tim Burton today. Instead of a regular Tuesday Top Ten list... we're just going with LISTS plural. To make up for the lack of a proper Dumbo review, we're throwing FIVE of them at you today. While it's true that this decade of his work has left much to be desired, he's actually always been an uneven auteur. All throughout his filmography magic blooms in unexpectedly dire places OR weeds sprout up in otherwise magically lovely gardens if you catch our drift.\n\nBurton is only 60 years old and since he's made films at a roughly one-every-other-year clip for his whole career, we hope he manages to rally his artistic instincts for one more classic before he retires in say, 2031 after another five pictures (spitballing!). He has directed 19 movies and we'd rank them like so...\n\nALL 19 TIM BURTON PICTURES RANKED\n\nEdward Scissorhands (1990)\n\nEd Wood (1994)\n\nPee Wee's Big Adventure (1985)\n\nTier 1. Masterpieces of their genres really... spectacularly niche genres but still! Few films have this kind of consistent magic and uniquely memorable visuals from first frame to last...\n\nBeetlejuice (1988)\n\nBatman Returns (1992)\n\nCorpse Bride (2005)\n\nTier 2. Loveable. Weird. Creepy. Goofy. Essential Burton\n\nFrankenweenie (2012)\n\nSleepy Hollow (1999)\n\nMars Attacks! (1996)\n\nTier 3. Far from perfect but there's much to love within them.\n\nBatman (1989)\n\nBig Fish (2003)\n\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007)\n\nTier 4. Wildly uneven pictures and thus a bit aggravating despite the highs.\n\nMiss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (2016)\n\nDumbo (2019)\n\nDark Shadows (2012)\n\nTier 5. The \"meh\" group. They're all missing some organic magic ingredient, feeling forced or earthbound despite their fantastical natures. And all of them are completely lacking in focus (if anything that's what's tripping Burton up these days). But thank God, by which we mean Vincent Prince in the context of Burton's presumed theology, for Eva Green. The raven-haired beauty of often otherwordly acting inspiration has more than earned a great Burton picture built around her. Where is her Ed Wood?\n\nBig Eyes (2014)\n\nPlanet of the Apes (2001)\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005)\n\nAlice in Wonderland (2010)\n\nTier 6. The Actively Bad pictures. They don't work. At times they're even unwatchable.\n\nALL 18 OSCAR NOMINATIONS FOR TIM BURTON PICTURES RANKED\n\nImmediately after starting this it seemed like a terrible idea since its like comparing apples to oranges shrunken heads. He hasn't quite averaged 1 Oscar nomination per picture so Oscar has always been a bit resistant. They only started catching on to him with Sleepy Hollow, which he unfortunately followed up with a few of his worst movies.\n\nBatman, Art Direction (1989) ... won!\n\nEd Wood, Supporting Actor Martin Landau (1994)... won!\n\nBeetlejuice, Makeup (1988)... won!\n\nSleepy Hollow, Costume Design (1999) ... lost to Topsy-Turvy\n\nCorpse Bride, Animated Feature (2005) .... lost to Curse of the Were-Rabbit\n\nEdward Scissorhands, Makeup (1990)... lost to Dick Tracy\n\nSleepy Hollow, Art Direction (1999)... won!\n\nEd Wood, Makeup (1994)... won!\n\nSweeney Todd, Costume Design (2007)... lost to Elizabeth: The Golden Age\n\nFrankenweenie, Animated Feature (2012)... lost to Brave\n\nSleepy Hollow, Cinematography (1999)... lost to American Beauty\n\nSweeney Todd, Art Direction (2007)... won!\n\nBig Fish, Original Score (2003)... lost to LotR: Return of the King\n\nAlice in Wonderland, Costume Design (2010)... won!\n\nSweeney Todd, Actor Johnny Depp (2007)... lost to Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory, Costume Design (2005)... lost to Memoirs of a Geisha\n\nAlice in Wonderland, Art Direction (2010)... won!\n\nAlice in Wonderland, Visual Effects (2010)...lost to Inception\n\nTOP TEN ACHIEVEMENTS WITHIN THAT FILMOGRAPHY THAT TOTALLY DESERVED OSCAR NOMINATIONS BUT DIDN'T GET THEM\n\nLet's take these in chronological order to simplify...\n\nPee-Wee's Big Adventure (1985)\n\n-Original Screenplay (Phil Hartman, Paul Reubens, Michael Varhol)\n\nEdward Scissorhands (1990)\n\n-Score (Danny Elfman)\n\n-Screenplay (Tim Burton, Caroline Thompson)\n\n-Actor (Johnny Depp)\n\n-Production Design (Bo Welch)\n\nBatman Returns (1992)\n\n-Actress (Michelle Pfeiffer)\n\n-Costume Design (Bob Ringwood, Mary E Vogt)\n\n- Score (Danny Elfman)\n\nEd Wood (1994)\n\n-Actor (Johnny Depp)\n\n-Costume Design (Colleen Atwood)\n\n20 BEST PERFORMANCES IN BURTON PICTURES\n\nTerrible shame that only two actors have ever been nominated from his filmography and Johnny Depp was much better, at least twice, within that same filmography than the time he was nominated (Sweeney Todd)! It's not a top 20 because I couldn't decide between about 4 people for the last slot.\n\nMartin Landau, Ed Wood (1994) -the only Oscar winning performance from the Burton filmography and one of only two nominated\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer, Batman Returns (1992)\n\nJohnny Depp, Ed Wood (1994) - Golden Globe nominee\n\nJohnny Depp, Edward Scissorhands (1990) - Golden Globe nominee\n\nEva Green, Dark Shadows (2012)\n\nDianne Wiest, Edward Scissorhands (1990)\n\nMichael Keaton, Beetlejuice (1988)\n\nAlbert Finney, Big Fish (2003) - Golden Globe nominee\n\nSarah Jessica Parker, Mars Attacks! (1996)\n\nWinona Ryder, Beetlejuice (1988)\n\nVincent Price, Edward Scissorhands (1990)\n\nPaul Reubens, Pee Wee's Big Adventure (1985)\n\nCatherine O'Hara, Beetlejuice (1988)\n\nDanny DeVito, Batman Returns (1992)\n\nLisa Marie, Mars Attacks! (1996)\n\nKathy Baker, Edward Scissorhands (1990)\n\nHelena Bonham-Carter, Sweeney Todd (2007) if she'd been able to sing this might have been one of the very best performances in his filmography\n\nSarah Jessica Parker, Ed Wood (1994)\n\nBill Murray, Ed Wood (1994)\n\nSylvia Sidney, Beetlejuice (1988)\n\n7 BEST THINGS ABOUT DUMBO\n\nWe're trying to stay positive though it's #14 for us among his 19 pictures.\n\nDumbo's first flying \"performance\"\n\nDumbo is very cute (even though he becomes a supporting character in his own film - sigh)\n\nThat the film sends a 'take smart girls seriously' message consistently throughout\n\nEva Green as Colette. Eva Green has yet to not be a highlight in any film smart enough to include her.\n\nRick Heinrichs' Production Design. Among Burton's regular department heads, we'd argue he's the one that Burton least needs a break from. Sometimes a new collaborator can shake you up creatively and Burton has been using many of the exact same people for decades now. A particularly strong performance by Heinrichs here in the juxtaposition of the small scale circus with the mega circus (especially when it comes to the living quarters/exhibits of Dumbo's mom.\n\n\"Pink Elephants on Parade\"\n\nAny times Burton tells the story through Dumbo's POV (which should have been FAR more often). It's silent film magic if you ignore the dialogue and just see what Dumbo is seeing.\n\nCare to make a list of your own in the comments. Any style of Tim Burton list is welcome.\n\nAfter seeing the Dumbo remake, I re-watched the original animated version and wound up seeing it twice, almost back-to-back. It's THAT good. Everything about it works, the comedy, the emotions, the music, the characters, the surreal moments, it makes me sad that future generation may think of this absolutely inferior remake when they hear the title \"Dumbo\" rather than the masterpiece in simplicity that was the 1941 animated film. While the remake isn't awful, it feels like Burton is being suffocated. The cinematography is incredibly dark and none of the actors (save for Eva Green and Alan Arkin) show any kind of enthusiasm (which is especially disappointing seeing that this is Burton re-uniting with Michael Keaton). Also, I haven't cringed so hard at a line as I did when DeVito said \"no booze in front of the baby\".\n\nAs for Tim Burton, my Top Five of his are Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Big Fish, Beetlejuice and Sleepy Hollow, while my Bottom Five are Alice in Wonderland, Planet of the Apes, Big Eyes, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Dark Shadows.\n\nThe single greatest things Burton has pulled off have been the dinner sequence in Beetlejuice (as co-written by O'Hara, who has to sell the moment, and damn does she), the \"solution\" to the Martian problem in Mars Attacks! (still one of the funniest ensembles ever assembled, love that film, with a killer Sylvia Sidney performance, may she rest in peace), and the epilogue of Edward Scissorhands, which, alongside Elfman's best score (and the one that should have won him every single award known to a composer) and the visuals, as well as \"Sometimes, you can still catch me dancing in it...\" is the purest Burton moment he's ever been able to capture.\n\nPfeiffer and O'Hara get my vote for best performances in a Burton film, because without them, Beetlejuice and Batman Returns would not rank as highly as they do. Pfeiffer especially... Honestly, she's never been that good again, and she floors me every time.\n\nBurton was the very first director (auteur) I fell in love with. I wholeheartedly agree he's kind of meandered since Sleepy Hollow, which was already uneven and in need of some focus (which I agree is the main problem with his later work), but still captured him in a way worth remembering and revisiting. Most of his later work is just tired and processed, and though I enjoyed Dark Shadows and Eva Green's role in it, it wasn't enough to save it.\n\nStill, not many directors can call Beetlejuice, Scissorhands, Batman Returns, Ed Wood, Mars Attacks, and, let's be honest, The Nightmare Before Christmas, as their own. And a mighty fine feast they all make.\n\nHe will always hold a special place in my heart."
