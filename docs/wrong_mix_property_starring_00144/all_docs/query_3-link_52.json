        "text": "Matthew Bourne’s magical dance production of Edward Scissorhands has carved a place in the hearts of audiences worldwide since its premiere in 2005. Based on the classic Tim Burton movie and featuring the hauntingly beautiful music of Danny Elfman and Terry Davies, Bourne and his New Adventures Company return to this witty, bittersweet story of an incomplete boy left alone in a strange new world. Filmed live in March 2024 at the Wales Millenium Centre, Cardiff, this ’visually arresting and ceaselessly inventive’ (★★★★★ Metro) production is ‘the perfect treat for all the\n\nfamily’ (★★★★★ The Times).\n\nIn a castle high on a hill lives Edward; a boy created by an eccentric inventor. When his creator dies he is left alone and unfinished with only scissors for hands until a kindly townswoman invites him to live with her suburban family. Can Edward find his place in the well-meaning community\n\nwhich struggles to see past his curious appearance to the innocence and gentleness within?"
