        "text": "Alan Arkin is an American actor and singer.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York, Arkin began acting after studying at various local academies and playing in a music group. He made a great impact on screen with his first (in-character) screen appearance in 1966, where he became one of only a handful of actors to receive a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for their debut role. He received subsequent nominations (and one win) for The Heart is a Lonely Hunter and Little Miss Sunshine.\n\nAs well as singing and acting in both comic and serious roles, Arkin directed the play The Sunshine Boys, and several films, most notably Little Murders.\n\nSinging[]\n\nArkin began his showbusiness career in folk music group The Tarriers in which he sang and played guitar. He appeared as himself with the group in the film Calypso Heat Wave, where they performed \"The Banana Boat Song\". He later performed with children's folk group The Baby Sitters and played the Narrator and Dr Pangloss in Candide.\n\nArkin sang on screen in character on several occasions too; as the titular Flash in Chu Chu and the Philly Flash, as washed up superhero Captain Invincible in musical superhero comedy The Return of Captain Invincible, and as well meaning father Bill Boggs in Edward Scissorhands, who bellows \"I Saw Three Ships\" as he attaches Christmas lights to the roof.\n\nFilms[]\n\nCalypso Heat Wave (1957)[]\n\nThe Banana Boat Song (contains solo lines)\n\nChu Chu and the Philly Flash (1981)[]\n\nWhole Lot of Money (solo)\n\nThe Return of Captain Invincible (1983)[]\n\nGive My Regards to Broadway (solo)\n\nAmazing How They're Alike (solo)\n\nEvil Midnight (contains solo lines)\n\nInto the Blue (solo)\n\nThe World I Knew (solo)\n\nEdward Scissorhands (1990)[]\n\nI Saw Three Ships (solo)\n\nStage[]\n\nCandide (1968)[]\n\nThe Best of all Possible Worlds (contains solo lines)\n\nLisbon Sequence: Lisbon Fair / The Prediction / Dear Boy / The Inquisition: Auto-da-FÃ© (contains solo lines)\n\nThe Venice Gavotte (contains solo lines)\n\nAlbums[]\n\nContemporary Broadway Revisited (1985)[]\n\nGrowing Older (solo)\n\nWhat a Wonderful Way to Die (solo)"
