        "text": "Alan Arkin (born March 26, 1934, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died June 29, 2023, Carlsbad, California) was an American actor who won respect during a long career as a performer onstage, in television, and in films. His comedic skills were particularly admired.\n\nArkin aspired to be an actor from an early age. His family moved to Los Angeles when he was 11 years old. After high-school graduation, he studied drama first at Los Angeles City College and then at Los Angeles State College (now California State University, Los Angeles), and he also briefly attended Bennington College in Vermont. Arkin moved to New York City in 1955 and embarked on a career in music as a songwriter, singer, and guitar player. In 1957 he joined with Erik Darling and Bob Carey in a folk group called the Tarriers. His first film appearance was as a member of that group in the low-budget beach movie Calypso Heat Wave (1957). Arkin had a small singing part in 1958 in an Off-Broadway production of Heloise before joining the Compass Players improv troupe in St. Louis, Missouri. From there he joined the new Second City improv group in Chicago, and it was there that he received his real training in theatre. When Arkin returned to the New York stage, it was in a 1961 Broadway revue, From the Second City. In 1963 he originated the role of David Kolowitz in the Broadway production of Enter Laughing, based on a semi-autobiographical novel by Carl Reiner; he earned favourable notice as well as a Tony Award for best featured actor. He won further plaudits for his performance in the Broadway production Luv (1964–67), directed by Mike Nichols.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nArkin made his feature film debut as the head of a Russian landing party from a Soviet submarine that became grounded off a beach in New England in The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming! (1966), and his performance earned him a nomination for an Academy Award for best actor. He played a vicious murderer stalking the character portrayed by Audrey Hepburn in the thriller Wait Until Dark (1967), took the title role in Bud Yorkin’s Inspector Clouseau (1968), and was nominated for another Oscar as well as a Golden Globe Award for his performance as the deaf protagonist of The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (1968), based on a novel by Carson McCullers.\n\nArkin was again nominated for a Golden Globe Award for his portrayal of a Puerto Rican single father in Popi (1969), and he played Captain Yossarian in Nichols’s Catch-22 (1970), based on the 1961 novel by Joseph Heller. Arkin directed and acted in the film Little Murders (1971), having earlier (1969) directed an Off-Broadway revival of that play, written by Jules Feiffer. He later received a Tony Award (1973) for his staging of Neil Simon’s The Sunshine Boys (1972–74). He also appeared in the 1972 film adaptation of the Simon’s play Last of the Red Hot Lovers, played a San Francisco detective in the comedy Freebie and the Bean (1974), portrayed Sigmund Freud in The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1976), and appeared opposite Peter Falk in Arthur Hiller’s comedy The In-Laws (1979).\n\nArkin’s later films included Joshua Then and Now (1985), Tim Burton’s Edward Scissorhands (1990), and Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), based on the play by David Mamet. He was nominated for another Golden Globe Award and for an Emmy Award for his starring role in the television movie Escape from Sobibor (1987). He appeared in minor films and TV movies as well as in occasional guest roles on TV shows for the next several years, the most notable of which included the movies Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), Slums of Beverly Hills (1998), and Thirteen Conversations About One Thing (2001) and the TV movie The Pentagon Papers (2003), for which he received an Emmy Award nomination.\n\nArkin’s performance as the blunt, cantankerous, heroin-sniffing grandfather in Little Miss Sunshine (2006), a comedy about a dysfunctional family driving cross-country to attend a child beauty pageant, earned him the Academy Award for best supporting actor. His subsequent films included The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause (2006), the thriller Rendition (2007), the 2008 big-screen treatment of the 1965–70 TV series Get Smart, and the sentimental dog movie Marley & Me (2008). Arkin was nominated for another Oscar for his turn as the brash studio executive tasked with concocting a convincing fake movie in Argo (2012)."
