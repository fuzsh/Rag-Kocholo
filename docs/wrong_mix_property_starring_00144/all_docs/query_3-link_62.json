        "text": "Tim Burton’s cult classic Edward Scissorhands comes to La Filmoteca. Starring some of Hollywood's most well known names (Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall, and Kathy Baker), it’s one not to miss on the big screen.\n\nShot in 1990, this American gothic romance follows the story of an artificially made man who has scissors for hands. He is taken in by an unassuming suburban family and, whilst staying with them, falls for their teenage daughter. Burton was inspired by Shelley’s Frankenstein: he wanted to recreate the fairytale-like nature of the story, but with touches of humour, tenderness and cruelty.\n\nThe film was an instant hit and won the British Academy Film Award for Best Production Design and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. It also received nominations for Academy Awards and the Saturn Awards."
