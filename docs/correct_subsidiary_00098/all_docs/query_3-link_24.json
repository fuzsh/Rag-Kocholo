They have clearly established themselves as the de facto standard for in-building wireless design.”\n\nThe terms and conditions of the investment remain confidential although it is clearly stated that current management preserves complete control over on-going operations. iBwave continues to demonstrate profitable growth throughout difficult times in our global economy.\n\nBoard Members:\n\nMike Cegelski presides as Executive Chairman of iBwave and plays a mentoring role in the company’s strategic and operational orientations since 2006.
