        "text": "02/10/2015 – The $650M acquisition of DeepMind Technologies last January helped clarify for venture investors that there is money to be made in artificial intelligence investments.\n\nAnd investors clearly gained interest in the hot AI space through 2014 pouring $309M into AI startups across more than 40 deals, according to CB Insights data prepared for Bloomberg Business.\n\nOn a year-over-year basis, funding to pure-play AI startups, which include companies working in NLP, machine learning, deep learning and predictive APIs among other core applications, jumped 302%. The most sizable deals included Sentient Technologies $103.5M Series C financing from investors including Tata, Horizons Ventures and Access Industries and Vicarious Systems $40M Series B led by Formation 8. ABB Technology Ventures later extended the round by another $12M.\n\n08/26/2014 – Its been 28 years since ARCH Venture Partners spun out of the University of Chicago in 1986, but the partners at the venture firm specialized in biotech are still going strong due to an investment strategy one of its own partners calls a little crazy.\n\nCrazy has worked for ARCH historically, except for a bad patch in the late 1990s. And limited partners are trusting it will work again, as the firm announced Wed. it has closed its eighth investment fund, for more than $400 million.\n\n06/18/2014 – Bain Capital has raised its sixth venture capital fund, closing it at $650 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Boston firm, well known for its large private equity funds, also has venture capital portfolios, which invest in earlier-stage companies. Generally, the deal sizes run from $1 million to $50 million. Target industries include software, business services, and health care technology and services.\n\nBain Capital Ventures raised the new fund quickly, starting in April. Its last venture fund was raised in 2012 and totaled $600 million.\n\n06/19/2014 – Greycroft Partners, a New York firm that saw its early investments in Maker Studios, Buddy Media, Huffington Post and Braintree Payments Solutions turn into large payouts, has now closed on its first growth fund at $200 million.\n\nGreycroft set out to raise its growth fund in late February with a target of $160 million and with a hard cap of $200 million.\n\nThe new fund means there is another expansion-stage investor in New York, which has few such firms. So many of our companies are not in San Francisco and have a harder time tapping into these expansion-stage funds in the Valley, Mr. Sigalow said.\n\n02/14/2014 – While demand for both crowdfunding and P2P lending platforms has grown, funding dollars have primarily accrued to a small group of well-funded P2P lending platforms including Lending Club, Prosper Marketplace and Funding Circle.\n\nVenture capital investors are playing a big role in the rise of alternative financial services  putting funding dollars toward both crowdfunding (equity, donation, reward etc.) as well as peer-to-peer lending platforms, matching individual borrowers and unrelated lenders or peers.\n\nDemand for both crowdfunding and P2P lending platforms has grown but as the chart below highlights, P2P lending platforms have raised nearly $715M vs. $237M to crowdfunding platforms since 2009.\n\n09/23/2013 – Its official- startups can now publicly advertise that they are seeking investments, but it does come with additional responsibilities of which all entrepreneurs must be aware.\n\nThree Things You Must Know About It:\n\n1. Allow only accredited investors into the funding round.\n\n(you can have up to 35 non-accredited investors participating in your round as long you have a pre-existing relationship with them.)\n\n2. Verify that all these investors are accredited.\n\nyou will be required to provide official documentation to confirm that each investor meets the accredited investor threshold, according to the SEC requirements.\n\n3. Declare that a 506(c) publicly advertised offering was undertaken as part of the Form D filing.\n\nJust as of today, you will have to file a Form D within 15 days of receiving your first investment. This means you will have to declare that you publicly advertised your offering, under new 506(c) regulations.\n\n08/06/2013 – Corporate VC deal activity jumped 23% on a year-over-year (YoY) basis spurred by more CVCs doing deals and a small group of hyperactive corporate venture investors.\n\nQ213 saw corporate VCs participate in 126 deals representing total funding of $1.7B. In addition to strong deal growth, corporate venture funding climbed 7% versus a year ago. Overall, corporate VCs are doing deals across all stages and sectors and are cutting much larger checks. In fact, deals in which CVCs participate are 60% larger than the typical VC deals. The recent quarter underscores the fact that CVCs are becoming an increasingly key constituency in the venture ecosystem with 25% of overall VC funding now including participation by CVCs. With traditional VCs having a tough time raising money from LPs, are corporate VCs stepping in to fill the gap?\n\n07/14/2013 – After a year-long wait since the announcement of the JOBS Act in April 2012, the SEC finally made a much anticipated vote of 4-1 yesterday in favor of lifting the ban on general solicitation for Title II of the JOBS Act. This is exciting news for fundraising entrepreneurs with private companies.\n\nEssentially, this means that startups and other private companies will be able to publicize that they are fundraising, instead of relying solely on word of mouth within their own personal networks of accredited investors with whom they have an existing relationship.\n\n06/04/2013 – Signia Venture Partners is raising a $100 million fund, according to an SEC filing.\n\nSignia Venture Partners is an early stage fund that makes investments in mobile, gaming, online video, and education technology. It was formed by Playdom Inc founder Rick Thompson who sold his company to Disney for $763.2 million in 2010 and fellow tech industry veterans Dan Fiden, Ed Cluss, and Sunny Dhillon in 2012. The group committed $20 million of their own money for the first fund and has made just shy of 30 investments to date.\n\nSignia Venture Partners is based in Menlo Park, California. Thompson is a prolific tech investor. All told, Thompson has had exits valued in excess of $5 billion during his career. He loves to play poker and chess; he has been an investor and entrepreneur since 1995; and he is focused on what he calls the founder-investor model, where he gets closely involved with the early-stage companies he works with.\n\n05/18/2013 – SAP announce Thursday that it plans to increase the size of SAP Ventures $155 million HANA fund to $405 million as part of a broad effort to define what a next-generation corporate venture capital organization looks like, SAP Ventures Chief Executive Nino Marakovic told VentureWire. SAP is the sole LP in the SAP HANA Realtime Fund, which was launched by SAP Ventures in April, 2012 to invest in early-stage venture capital funds and in startups building technology around SAPs HANA in-memory database.\n\n04/09/2013 – Foundation Capital announced its seventh fund today, a $282 million pool of money that the venture firm plans on investing in early-stage startups.\n\nMonlo Park, Calif.-based Foundation Capital has handled a total of $2.7 billion since it was first founded 17 years ago. This firm primarily invests in early-stage companies and plans to focus this current fund on consumer technology, information technology, and clean technology.\n\nEight of the venture firms partners will invest from this funding, including Charles Moldow and Ashmeet Sidana who we chatted with last year about the state of venture capital and then unique relationship VCs have with each other. Moldow refers to it as coopatition a little cooperation and little competition mixed in together.\n\n02/21/2013 – San Francisco-based early stage investor Accelerator Ventures is seeking $25 million for a planned second fund, according to a securities filing.The filings lists Alexander Lloyd, Accerators founder and managing partner, as the sole general partner. Prior to founding the firm, Lloyd was a venture partner at Rustic Canyon Partners, where he oversaw development of their seed-stage investment strategy. Also on board at the firm are Ben Smith, a venture partner, and John Paul Milciunas, an entrepreneur-in-residence.\n\nAccelerator has been making investments for about a decade, but did not close its first institutional fund, a $5.75 million Fund I, until 2008.\n\n01/18/2013 – Venture capital for 2012 hit $28.3 billion invested across 3267 deals. Funding was down 7.5% and failed to reach the $30 billion mark seen in 2011 ($30.6B) while deal volume climbed 7% from 2011 on the back of continued strong activity at the Seed VC stage (from 3051 to 3267 deals). Q4 2012 saw VC funding dip for the 2nd consecutive quarter as it fell back significantly from the heady $8.1B seen two quarters ago in Q2 2012 and the $7.5B seen in Q3 2012. On the deal activity front, Q4 maintained the record-setting pace seen in Q3 ending at 834 financings (compared to 835 in Q3).\n\n01/02/2013 – Reston-based New Atlantic Ventures, which invests in technology start-ups, has launched its fourth venture capital fund.\n\nThe New Atlantic Venture Fund IV expects to raise $125 million, with its first investors contributing $42.5 million in the fund's initial sale last week.\n\nNew Atlantic Ventures currently holds stakes in more than two dozen start-ups, including six in the Washington area. It currently has $230 million in capital under management.\n\n12/09/2012 – Healthcare providers are finding their play it safe culture isnt conducive to breakthrough innovation. Facing the inevitable deflationary pressures being put upon the healthcare system, innovation is critically needed.\n\nHealth systems have taken various approaches such as becoming a Limited Partner in venture funds like Health Enterprise Partners. Some of the larger systems, such as HCA and Dignity Health, have their own venture arms. A new development is a much smaller organization establishing their own venture fund.\n\nImplicit in this approach is a much more hands-on approach than as an investor in a 3rd party venture fund. Rex Health Ventures is an early example of venture-capital investment funds in the country started by a community, nonprofit hospital (Rex Health Care). The fund is being launched with an initial $10 million investment from Rex Healthcare and will help finance the most promising innovations among new medical services, tools and technologies.\n\n11/08/2012 – Google will increase the cash it allocates to its venture-capital arm to up to $300 million a year from $200 million, catapulting Google Ventures into the top echelon of corporate venture-capital funds.\n\nAccess to that sizeable checkbook means Google Ventures will be able to invest in more later-stage financing rounds, which tend to be in the tens of millions of dollars or more per investor.\n\nIt puts the firm on the same footing as more established corporate venture funds such as Intel's Intel Capital, which typically invests $300-$500 million a year.\n\n10/26/2012 – During the DEMO conference Piilo demonstrated its recently released platform to change the landscape for Human Resource Management for small and medium sized organizations.\n\nCIO website reports: The (Piilo) system is scalable and modular allowing the users to purchase single or several modules depending on their needs. Users can create their own customized portal that matches their businesses budget and needs by selecting one, two or more modules.\n\n10/12/2012 – Boston-based Saturn Partners, an early backer of Constant Contact that has kept a low profile since its founding in 1993, plans to close its third venture capital fund by the end of the year as it seeks to become a better-known brand in VC, partner Bob Chicoski said in an interview.\n\nThe firm has raised $50 million for the new fund thus far  from investors including new limited partner Siemens (NYSE: SI)  and expects to close the fund at about $75 million, Chicoski said. That's up from up from the firm's $30 million second fund, he said.\n\n09/15/2012 – Venture capital is flooding into the Middle East as a host of new funds set up shop, promising new hope for struggling start-ups seeking investment.\n\nAt least five new funds are in the process of scouring the Middle East for the next Facebook, Google or Aramex as investors clock on to the growing number of small businesses in dire need of funding.\n\nThe five funds - Beco Capital, Y+ Ventures, Smart Start, Envestors and Virtuvest - are looking to invest tens of millions of dollars in start-ups and small businesses in the next few years. Individual investments vary depending on the fund but could be anywhere between US$50,000 (Dh183,640) and $2 million\n\n09/15/2012 – Foundry Group, the Colorado-based venture capital firm best known for its early investment in Zynga (ZNGA), has closed its third fund with $225 million in capital commitments.\n\nThat's the exact same size as Foundry's first two funds, and virtually the exact same LP base. In fact, expect that Foundry's upcoming announcement on the fund close will be a literal cut-and-paste job from the prior two announcements (save for the date and fund number).\n\n09/06/2012 – Nexus Venture Partners, Indias most successful venture capital fund has announced the close of its third fund with committed capital of about $270 million. The fund investors include endowments, foundations and financial institutions across North America, India, Europe and Asia. Nexus plans to use the funds to continue helping Indian startups go global and vice-versa: help U.S. startups tap into emerging markets. Nexus Venture Partners was launched in 2006 with the primary goal of providing capital to exceptional Indian entrepreneurs\n\n08/10/2012 – Instagram-backer Thrive Capital is raising a new $150 million venture capital fund, people familiar with the matter said, a move that could put the young firm in greater competition with bigger peers that have been its partners in recent deals.\n\nThe fundraising effort underscores the rising ambition of Thrive Capitals young founder Joshua Kushner, 27, who hails from a prominent real estate family. His firm was one of several that doubled their money practically overnight after it invested in photo-sharing service Instagram at a $500 million valuation just days before Facebook bought the company for $1 billion in cash and stock. The purchase price, however, has declined as Facebooks stock has suffered recently.\n\n07/24/2012 – VMware is buying Nicira Inc. for $1.26 billion in cash and equity, adding technology that helps networks run more efficiently to broaden its appeal to companies seeking to cut hardware costs.\n\nThe acquisition is netting the investor, Andreessen Horowitz, an estimated $300 million return on $17.7 million investment, paying back its entire 2009 fund.\n\nEver since Marc Andreessen formalized his startup investing by creating a firm, Andreessen Horowitz, back in 2009, the firm has been treated like one of Silicon Valley's top startup investors.\n\n06/03/2012 – Sequoia Capital, the venture capital firm behind companies such as Google and Yahoo, is raising new money for a number of different funds in the U.S. and China, that in aggregate would be around $1 billion.\n\nFortune is reporting these new funds may be used for a China-focused fund, growth equity for later stage companies, and traditional investing. The company closed its last round at the end of 2011 for its U.S. Growth Equity Fund V. The firm also raised around $1.3 billion for a number of similar funds in 2010.\n\n04/30/2012 – The Renaissance Venture Capital Fund, the venture capital fund-of-funds formed by Business Leaders for Michigan, Monday announced formation of a second fund with initial capital of $60 million, growing the RCVF to over $100 million.\n\nWhen launched in 2008, the RCVFs Renaissance I was the first fund of its kind in the United States. Its $45 million was invested in 10 venture capital funds from around the nation under the condition that they actively look at Michigan opportunities. The investments to date by RCVF have led to venture capital firm investments of 15 times that amount into Michigan companies and the creation of over 200 jobs.\n\n05/09/2012 – New Enterprise Associates has raised $2.08 billion for its 14th fund, well on its way to a total offering of $2.56 billion.\n\nThe Chevy Chase, Md. based venture capital juggernaut filed paperwork in March declaring at the time its intent to raise $2.3 billion. New paperwork indicates that NEA has attracted 146 investors.\n\nThe vote of confidence from its limited partners is no surprise given NEA's stalwart status among venture capital firms. Its committed capital is more than $11 billion across all of its funds, and Forbes recently named four NEA partners to its Midas List of Tech Investors.\n\n01/20/2012 – Funding for startups rose 19 percent in the fourth quarter as venture capitalists fueled money into more companies in the Internet, clean technology and other sectors.\n\nAccording to a study released Friday, startup investments grew to $6.57 billion in the October-December quarter from $5.52 billion in the same period in 2010. The volume of deals, though, did not keep up with the amount of money invested. There were 844 deals completed in the fourth quarter, down from 861 a year earlier.\n\nCalled the MoneyTree report, the study was conducted by PriceWaterHouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association based on data from Thomson Reuters.\n\n11/08/2011 – Accel Partners has backed some of the biggest online hits of the past few years, including Facebook, Groupon, and Angry Birds-maker Rovio. But with its new $100 million fund, the firm wants to invest in an area that's a little less sexy\"big data\" startups.\n\nAccel's Big Data Fund will inject needed capital into companies ranging from next generation storage and data management platforms to a wide range of revolutionary software applications. The venture firm made the announcement at the Hadoop World Conference in New York.\n\n09/13/2011 – Tom Perkins, co-founder of Kleiner Perkins and the backer of companies ranging from Genentech to Google, believes much of the venture-capital industry has set itself up for failure.\n\n\"Mathematically, there's no way that all venture capital in America will make 10 to 1,\" or $10 for every dollar invested -- a fairly typical return in past years -- Perkins told Reuters.\n\nThere is too much money chasing too few companies, he said, and the increasingly large sums invested mean failures will hurt more.\n\n09/12/2011 – Today, at TechCrunch Disrupt, the industrys early-stage startup networking event, internet technology veterans Josh Felser and Dave Samuel formally introduced Freestyle Capital, a new venture capital firm focused on seed and early stage investments in consumer and web-based enterprise technology startups. Felser and Samuel, serial Internet entrepreneurs who together co-founded both Crackle (acquired by Sony for $65 million in 2006) and Spinner.com (acquired by AOL Time Warner for $320 million in 1999), also announced that they have raised $27 million in a new fund closed from limited partners including Cendana Capital and Hall Capital. The new fund builds on a pre-existing portfolio assembled by Felser and Samuel.\n\nFreestyle Capital will focus on providing early-stage startups with both funding and counsel  drawing upon the investment capabilities and real-world experiences of Felser and Samuel  to guide technology startups to the next stage of development. Freestyle Capital is looking for young companies with transformational business ideas presenting seed funding and early stage investment opportunities in the range of $100,000-$500,000.\n\n07/19/2011 – Former First Solar CEO Michael Ahearn officially launched his $300 million greentech fund.\n\nThe firm says in a release Monday that it will focus mostly on early stage companies, with investments ranging from $100,000 to $25 million, and will look for startups across the energy, water, agriculture and waste industries. While Ahearn is still Chairman of First Solar, and was CEO until 2009, the thin-film solar panel giant isnt involved in the new fund.\n\n04/15/2011 – Funding to U.S. startups climbed during the first three months of the year, with venture capitalists putting more money into fewer companies, according to a study. Despite the decline in deals, the growth may indicate an improvement in the health of the venture investment market.\n\nFor the January-March period, startup investments rose 14 percent to $5.9 billion, compared with $5.2 billion invested during the same quarter in 2010, according to the study. In all, 736 startups received funding, which is down nearly 7 percent year over year and marks the smallest amount of companies to be funded since the third quarter of 2009.\n\n01/03/2011 – CDB Capital, a unit of China Development Bank, said on Monday that it will launch a 60 billion yuan ($9 billion) fund of funds to support the country's fledgling private equity and venture capital firms.\n\nThe fund of funds, the first of its kind set up by a state-owned entity, would include 40 billion yuan for private equity and 20 billion yuan for venture capital, they said.\n\n01/02/2011 – New rules from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a revised reading on which private fund managers must register as investment advisers will have a profound effect on traditional venture capital funds in 2011, a lawyer who specializes in VC litigation told me this week.\n\nUnder the new rules, even firms which are exempt from registration under the proposed rules will be still required to file periodic reports with the SEC and be subject to examination by the SEC.\n\n08/28/2010 – The pipeline of companies hoping to go public is filling, and that means investors may soon have more stocks to choose from  if they're interested.\n\nSo far this year, 171 companies have filed plans to go public. It's only August, but that already ranks this as the busiest year for initial public offering filings since 2007, says Renaissance Capital. There were 120 IPO filings in 2009 and 153 in 2008.\n\n06/10/2010 – The country's largest private sector lender, ICICI Bank, on Thursday said it has set up a $100 million dedicated venture capital fund for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and mid-market companies.\n\nThe \"Emerging India Fund\" is an ICICI group initiative to provide growth capital to Indian companies in the SME and mid-market segment, an ICICI Bank spokesperson said.\n\nThis is a $100 million fund to be managed by ICICI Investment Management Company Limited (IIMCL), a wholly owned subsidiary of ICICI Bank.\n\n04/12/2010 – Rembrandt Venture Partners has closed a second fund (Rembrandt Venture Partners' Fund Two) in the amount of $160.5 million. It will be invested in early-stage companies with ground-breaking technology offerings.
