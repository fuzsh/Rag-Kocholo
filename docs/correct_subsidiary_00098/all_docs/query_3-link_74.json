Insights ADC GLOBAL EMPLOYEE MAGAZINE July 2008 Thinking Globally, Acting Locally A Story of Global Fiber Connectivity “Our goal is to make ADC the world leader in transitioning our customers to new generation fiber-based networks.” Tom Huegerich Vice President, Business Development, Global Fiber Connectivity Leadership As the sun sets on ADC’s Americas-based facilities, a new day dawns in a Shanghai business park in China while ADC employees in Bangalore, India are already busy at work. It’s another 24-hour day at ADC. “A significant part of ADC’s sales growth will be in developing geographies, with a focus on China, India, Brazil and the Middle East. These geographies are growing, their citizens are adopting technologies, and they need bandwidth to connect to each other and the ever-globalizing economy,” said Tom Huegerich, Vice President for Business Development, Global Fiber Connectivity Leadership. “That’s why one of ADC’s strategic growth areas is leadership in Global Fiber Connectivity. Fiber, with an almost unlimited capacity, provides the bandwidth required by growing market profitability. Tom said, “Our goal is to make ADC the and developed countries.” world leader in transitioning our customers to new generation In the last four years, ADC’s fiber revenue has grown on average fiber-based networks.

We need to continue to focus on product innovation for our customers and process innovation in our operations.” Pat O’Brien President, Global Connectivity solutions Pat O’Brien, President, Global Connectivity Solutions, said of the Verizon story, “ADC has a rich history of bringing innovation to the fiber optic marketplace. We need to continue to focus on product innovation for our customers and process innovation in our operations.” Along with innovative products, world-class service will play an instrumental role in growing profitable fiber sales globally. The need for 24-hour operations remains imperative. We want to make it easy to specify, order, install and maintain our products. A CT team is currently working on developing and testing more efficient tools to meet our customers’ requests. “The long-term vision is to answer nearly all of our customers’ requests on the first response,” commented Tom. This mandates an almost seamless interface across many functions within ADC. As our customers deploy the nearly unlimited bandwidth of fiber deep into their networks, the opportunity for ADC to become a trusted business ally is exciting. With the goal of being one of the top three fiber suppliers worldwide, ADC’s proven ability to deliver the right product, at the right time and at a competitive price will drive our leadership position. This will involve global teams working around the clock to support the growing demand for fiber products with best-in-class service and leading product solutions. Our aim is to accomplish all of this without impacting the quality reputation that has been the foundation of ADC since the beginning. 3\n\n4.

Micro-site + Deployments = Macro Success for Wireless Business In early fiscal year 2008, ADC announced the combination of our Wireless and Wireline businesses and LGC Wireless into Network Solutions. Since then this business unit has experienced many successes, including the launch of a new Wireless solutions micro-website on ADC. com and many product deployments, as part of its strategic objective to grow our wireless revenue and market share. “Successfully integrating two companies is a complex, multi-faceted and challenging task,” said Vicki Nahrung, Integration Director for Network Solutions. “We have completed more than 75% of the 222 planned integration projects and launched our new wireless solutions ‘micro-site’. Although this integration has not been without issue, we have made tremendous progress.” In late 2007, the Marketing and the Network Solutions Product Management teams created and implemented an improved “IP-based Wireless Solutions” micro-website on ADC.com. The site contains refreshed and re-branded product literature and customer case studies for our product portfolio. Kelly Seltun, Senior Marketing Specialist for To explore the wireless mico-website, visit adc.com/wireless.

Innovation across ADC The concept of innovation can mean many things to many people. For Thomas Edison and General Electric, it was the invention of the market-ready light bulb in 1879. For Bill Smith and Motorola, it was the development and deployment of Six Sigma strategies in 1986. For ADC, one could point to our market-leading bend- radius fiber solutions or new business processes being defined through Competitive Transformation efforts. However one defines innovation, it remains central to our ever- growing and globalizing economy and remains an important ADC Way value. In support of this, employees are leading efforts to embed innovation across our company. In May, our Leadership and Organizational Development team introduced a new FY08-targeted Leadership Development Program that strengthens leaders’ ability to successfully execute on our business priorities. Karla Montgomery, Manager of Organizational and Leadership Development, said, “It is our intent to build a common language, philosophy and approach to innovation throughout our leadership ranks.” The program is rolling out at global sites from Denver, Colorado to Singapore and approximately 400 managers will attend the day-and-a-half training series. “Driving an innovative culture is considered key among our executives and was identified as a Five winning ideas were selected by ADC’s Growth Council for strategic area of development for our leaders,” said Karla. possible implementation, with Marlon Holmquist taking top honors for his proposal to improve a manufacturing process to Attendees will learn how to create the organizational conditions continuously feed sheet metal from a coil.

Innovation at ADC stretches beyond leader development. In Other ADC Innovator winners include Bryan Kennedy, who February, employees were challenged to think big, work quickly proposed building a Duracell-type power indicator for our and dream beyond our normal boundaries during the three-week customers’ inspection of cabinets; Nikhil Goel, who suggested ADC Innovator program. In total, 379 ideas were generated, using 802.11n chip sets as a cost-effective solution to create ranging from proposing solar power as the energy source for a higher bandwidth backhaul products; Jeff Cannon for his idea mobile phone to helping save money when employees book travel to add Ethernet accessories to our Universal Radio Head (URH) arrangements.

As these ideas are further explored and implemented, and as David Choe, Director of Strategy Development, said, “Employees’ our leaders become versed in the language of innovation, the ideas and input have made a positive difference for the future of possibilities to further define what “innovation” is at ADC ADC. Everyone has truly helped reignite the fuel of innovation!” remains endless. 6 6\n\n7.
