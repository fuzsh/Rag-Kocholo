The purchase price includes assumed debt and transaction costs, Minneapolis-based Graco said Monday. Separately, Cohesant said its shareholders would receive a minimum cash payment of $9.05 per share of Cohesant common stock and could be paid as much as $9.55 a share. Graco also will merge with Cohesant, which will spin off all non-GlasCraft business operations. The companies expect the acquisition to be completed in the first quarter of 2008. Indianapolis-based GlasCraft manufactures high-performance dispensing systems for the polyurethane foam and polyurea coatings industries. The agreement is subject to the approval of Cohesant stockholders.\n\nAlltel pays U.S., Minnesota $1.3 Million\n\nAlltel Corp. will pay $1.3 million to the government to settle allegations that it violated conditions of its acquisition of Mankato-based Midwest Wireless. Alltel had agreed to maintain the Midwest Wireless assets while it finished the acquisition, so it could divest its service in several rural Minnesota counties because of antitrust concerns. Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson and the federal Department of Justice had accused Alltel of failing to maintain those assets as agreed. The state will get $745,000 from the settlement, and the Justice Department will get $580,000, the attorney general’s office said on Monday. Last month Alltel was bought out for $24.7 billion by Fort Worth, Texas-based TPG Capital and GS Capital Partners, a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs.\n\nMesabi Nugget to buy former LTV site\n\nCleveland-Cliffs, Inc. said Monday it has closed on an agreement to sell the former LTV Steel site near Hoyt Lakes to Mesabi Nugget for $18 million, giving further momentum to construction of the world’s first commercial iron nugget plant at the site. As part of the sale, Mesabi Nugget Delaware LLC will get mineral and surface rights and assume certain environmental and reclamation liabilities for the site. The Cliffs Erie LLC site formerly was known as LTV Steel Mining Co., an Iron Range taconite plant managed by Cleveland-Cliffs. LTV Steel Mining closed in 2001 following the bankruptcy of LTV Steel Corp. Construction of the nugget plant is under way, with production scheduled for 2009.\n\nBRIEFLY\n\nMinnetonka-based UnitedHealth Group on Monday reaffirmed it will earn $3.49 to $3.50 a share this year, when adjusted for tax charges, and $3.95 to $4 a share in 2008. UnitedHealth holds a meeting with investors today in New York and will give a fuller discussion of the forecast. … ADC Telecommunications, Eden Prairie, said it completed its $169 million acquisition of LGC Wireless, San Jose, Calif. ADC expects to take an undetermined charge for acquisition-related expenses. … Minneapolis-based Dolan Media Co. said it raised its ownership interest in American Processing Co. LLC to almost 89 percent. American Processing offers default processing services to law firms. … Victoria-based microelectronics company HEI Inc. said sales for fiscal 2007 ended Sept. 1 fell 22 percent to $38.4 million from the previous year. The company will release full results today. … Tonka Bay Equity Partners, Minnetonka, said it acquired the New Jersey-based AST Bearings division of Axsys Technologies Inc.
