        "text": "Nuclear half-life expresses the time required for half of a sample to undergo radioactive decay. Exponential decay can be expressed mathematically like this:\n\n#A(t) = A_0 * (1/2)^(t/t_(\"1/2\"))# (1), where\n\n#A(t)# - the amount left after t years;\n\n#A_0# - the initial quantity of the substance that will undergo decay;\n\n#t_(\"1/2\")# - the half-life of the decaying quantity.\n\nSo, if a problem asks you to calculate an element's half-life, it must provide information about the initial mass, the quantity left after radioactive decay, and the time it took that sample to reach its post-decay value.\n\nLet's say you have a radioactive isotope that undergoes radioactive decay. It started from a mass of 67.0 g and it took 98 years for it to reach 0.01 g. Here's how you would determine its half-life:\n\nStarting from (1), we know that\n\n#0.01 = 67.0 * (1/2)^(98.0/t_(\"1/2\")) -> 0.01/67.0 = 0.000149 = (1/2)^(98.0/(t_(\"1/2\"))#\n\n#98.0/t_(\"1/2\") = log_(0.5)(0.000149) = 12.7#\n\nTherefore, its half-life is #t_(\"1/2\") = 98.0/(12.7) = 7.72# #\"years\"#.\n\nSo, the initial mass gets halved every 7.72 years.\n\nSometimes, if the numbers allow it, you can work backwards to determine an element's half-life. Let's say you started with 100 g and ended up with 25 g after 1,000 years.\n\nIn this case, since 25 represents 1/4th of 100, two hal-life cycles must have passed in 1,000 years, since\n\n#100.0/2 = 50.0# #\"g\"# after the first #t_(\"1/2\")#,\n\n#50.0/2 = 25.0# #\"g\"# after another #t_(\"1/2\")#."
