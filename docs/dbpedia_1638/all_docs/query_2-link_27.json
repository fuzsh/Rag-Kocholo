        "text": "Entresto can cause mild or serious side effects. The following lists contain some of the key side effects that may occur while taking Entresto. These lists don’t include all possible side effects.\n\nFor more information on the possible side effects of Entresto, talk with your doctor or pharmacist. They can give you tips on how to deal with any side effects that may be bothersome.\n\nNote: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tracks side effects of drugs they have approved. If you would like to report to the FDA a side effect you’ve had with Entresto, you can do so through MedWatch.\n\nMore common side effects\n\nThe more common side effects of Entresto can include:\n\ncough\n\ndizziness\n\nMost of these side effects may go away within a few days or a couple of weeks. If they’re more severe or don’t go away, talk with your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nSerious side effects\n\nSerious side effects from Entresto aren’t common, but they can occur. Call your doctor right away if you have serious side effects. Call 911 if your symptoms feel life threatening or if you think you’re having a medical emergency.\n\nSerious side effects and their symptoms can include the following:\n\nKidney problems, such as kidney failure. Symptoms can include:\n\nproducing a small amount of urine\n\ndark-colored urine\n\nswelling in the feet and legs\n\nconfusion\n\nitchy skin\n\nHyperkalemia (high level of potassium in the blood). Symptoms can include:\n\nheart rhythm problems\n\nslow heart rate\n\nmuscle weakness\n\ntrouble breathing\n\nnausea\n\nOther serious side effects, explained in more detail below in “Side effect details,” include:\n\nsevere allergic reaction\n\nhypotension (low blood pressure)\n\nfetal toxicity (fetal harm)*\n\n* Entresto has a boxed warning for fetal toxicity. This is the most serious warning from the FDA. Boxed warnings alert doctors and patients about drug effects that may be dangerous.\n\nSide effects in children\n\nIn clinical studies of Entresto, side effects in children were similar to those in adults and occurred just as often. A clinical study testing Entresto’s safety in children is still ongoing. More information about side effects in children will be provided from the manufacturer in the future.\n\nSide effect details\n\nYou may wonder how often certain side effects occur with this drug, or whether certain side effects pertain to it. Here’s some detail on several of the side effects this drug may or may not cause.\n\nTo learn more about Entresto’s side effects, refer to this article.\n\nAllergic reaction\n\nAs with most drugs, some people can have an allergic reaction after taking Entresto. In a study of adults with heart failure, 0.5% of people who took Entresto and 0.2% of people who took enalapril had angioedema. This is a type of severe allergic reaction.\n\nA severe allergic reaction, which includes angioedema, can cause the following symptoms:\n\nswelling under your skin, typically in your eyelids, lips, hands, or feet\n\nswelling of your tongue, mouth, or throat\n\ntrouble breathing\n\nYou may have a higher risk for angioedema while taking Entresto if you’re Black or if you’ve had angioedema in the past.\n\nIt’s also possible to have a mild allergic reaction to Entresto. Symptoms of a mild allergic reaction can include:\n\nskin rash\n\nitchiness\n\nflushing\n\nIf you have a severe allergic reaction to Entresto, tell your doctor right away. They may have you stop taking the drug, and they’ll suggest a different medication. Call 911 if your symptoms feel life threatening or if you think you’re having a medical emergency.\n\nCough\n\nCough was a common side effect reported in people who took Entresto. In a study of adults with heart failure, 9% of adults who took Entresto and 13% of adults who took enalapril had a cough.\n\nIf you have a cough that concerns you while taking Entresto, talk with your doctor. They can suggest treatments to help you feel better. Your doctor may also suggest that you stop taking Entresto. They can discuss other treatment options with you if needed.\n\nLow blood pressure\n\nLow blood pressure, which is also called hypotension, can occur while taking Entresto. It was one of the most common side effects reported in a large clinical study of the drug. Researchers found that 18% of people who took Entresto developed low blood pressure, compared with 12% of people who took enalapril.\n\nYou may be more likely to develop low blood pressure during your Entresto treatment if you’re also taking other drugs that can lower blood pressure. Examples of these medications include diuretics (water pills).\n\nSymptoms of low blood pressure can include:\n\ndizziness\n\nlightheadedness\n\nextreme tiredness\n\nfeeling dizzy or falling when moving from a lying position to seated or standing\n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms, tell your doctor right away. They may lower your Entresto dosage or adjust other medications you’re taking. They may also have you stop taking Entresto and use a different medication.\n\nKidney failure\n\nKidney failure can occur with Entresto. In a large clinical study of adults with heart failure, 5% of people who took Entresto and 5% of people who took enalapril had kidney failure.\n\nWhile you’re taking Entresto, your doctor may monitor your kidney function for any signs of kidney failure. If there are changes in how your kidneys are working, your doctor may lower your dose of Entresto or have you stop taking the drug for a time.\n\nHyperkalemia\n\nHyperkalemia, which is a high level of potassium in the blood, is a common side effect of taking Entresto. During a clinical study of people with heart failure, hyperkalemia was reported in 12% of those who took Entresto and in 14% of those who took enalapril.\n\nWhile you’re taking Entresto, your doctor will likely monitor your potassium level. If the level is high, your doctor may reduce your dose of Entresto or have you stop taking the drug for a time.\n\nShortness of breath\n\nShortness of breath wasn’t specifically reported with Entresto use in a large clinical study of adults with heart failure. However, shortness of breath can be a sign of a severe allergic reaction from taking Entresto. These reactions include angioedema. (See the “Allergic reaction” section above to learn more.)\n\nIf you’re short of breath, it could also be a sign that your heart failure is worsening. The condition can cause shortness of breath that’s brought on with activity or rest. It’s important that you track any shortness of breath you have and share this information with your doctor.\n\nIf you have trouble breathing, call your doctor right away. And call 911 if your symptoms feel life threatening or if you think you’re having a medical emergency.\n\nSkin rash\n\nRashes can occur with Entresto use. They were reported as a side effect of the drug once Entresto was on the market and available by prescription.\n\nIf you have a rash while taking Entresto, this may be a sign that you’re having an allergic reaction to the medication. (See the “Allergic reaction” section above to learn more.)\n\nIf you’re concerned about your rash, you should tell your doctor. They may recommend that you stop taking Entresto and take a different drug instead.\n\nFetal harm\n\nEntresto has a boxed warning. This is the most serious warning from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A boxed warning alerts doctors and patients about drug effects that may be dangerous.\n\nTaking Entresto while you’re pregnant can cause fetal toxicity, which is a type of fetal harm. The drug can cause a baby’s kidneys to not work well and lead to death. It’s not known how often this occurs with Entresto, a placebo, or a comparison drug.\n\nIf you become pregnant while taking Entresto, stop taking the drug right away and tell your doctor. They may recommend a different drug for your heart failure.\n\nWeight gain (not a side effect)\n\nWeight gain didn’t occur in the clinical studies of Entresto. But with heart failure, it’s very common to have rapid changes in your weight. An increase in your weight may mean that your heart failure is getting worse. This may be because your heart isn’t pumping properly, so fluid is collecting in your body.\n\nYou should track your weight each day and share this information with your doctor at every visit.\n\nIf you notice sudden changes in your weight or if your weight concerns you, speak with your doctor. They can see if your heart failure is the cause and suggest treatments that may help.\n\nThe Entresto dosage your doctor prescribes will depend on several factors. These include:\n\nthe type and severity of the condition you’re taking Entresto to treat\n\nyour age and weight\n\nthe form of Entresto you take\n\nother medical conditions you may have\n\nTypically, your doctor will start you on a low dosage. Then they’ll adjust it over time to reach the amount that’s right for you. Your doctor will ultimately prescribe the smallest dosage that provides the desired effect.\n\nThe following information describes dosages that are commonly used or recommended. However, be sure to take the dosage your doctor prescribes for you. Your doctor will determine the best dosage to suit your needs.\n\nFor more information, refer to this comprehensive article.\n\nDrug forms and strengths\n\nEntresto comes as a tablet that’s available in three strengths:\n\n24/26 mg. This strength contains 24 milligrams (mg) of sacubitril and 26 mg of valsartan, and it may be called 50 mg (24 mg + 26 mg).\n\n49/51 mg. This strength contains 49 mg of sacubitril and 51 mg of valsartan, and it may be called 100 mg (49 mg + 51 mg).\n\n97/103 mg. This strength contains 97 mg of sacubitril and 103 mg of valsartan, and it may be called 200 mg (97 mg + 103 mg).\n\nEntresto tablets are meant to be swallowed. But if you’re unable to swallow tablets, your pharmacist can crush them and mix them with a liquid for you to drink. This form is called an oral suspension.\n\nThe pharmacist will use Entresto 49/51-mg tablets to prepare the suspension. The final strength of the suspension will be 800 mg/200 mL, which is 4 mg/1 mL.\n\nDosage for heart failure\n\nThe starting dosage for Entresto is 49/51 mg twice a day. After 2 to 4 weeks, your doctor may double the dosage to 97/103 mg twice a day.\n\nPediatric dosage\n\nLike adults, children ages 1 year and older will typically take Entresto twice a day.\n\nFor young children, including those who weigh less than 88 pounds (lb), which is about 40 kilograms (kg), it’s recommended that the drug be given as an oral suspension. You’ll need to measure the required dose with an oral syringe.\n\nEntresto doses for children are based on their weight and age. Their doctor will increase the dose every 2 weeks until a final dose amount is reached.\n\nDosage for children who weigh less than 88 lb (40 kg)\n\nThe usual starting dose is 1.6 mg/kg. After 2 weeks, your child’s doctor may increase the dose to 2.3 mg/kg. And after 4 weeks, the dose may be increased to 3.1 mg/kg.\n\nA pharmacist will prepare the oral suspension and explain how much your child will need to take.\n\nDosage for children who weigh between 88 lb and 110 lb (40 kg and 50 kg)\n\nThe usual starting dose is 24/26 mg. After 2 weeks, your child’s doctor may increase the dose to 49/51 mg. And after 4 weeks, the dose may be increased to 72/78 mg.\n\nThe 72/78-mg recommended dose can be reached by taking three 24/26-mg tablets.\n\nDosage for children who weigh 110 lb (50 kg) or more\n\nThe usual starting dose is 49/51 mg. After 2 weeks, your child’s doctor may increase the dose to 72/78 mg. And after 4 weeks, they may increase the dose to 97/103 mg.\n\nWhat if I miss a dose?\n\nIf you miss a dose of Entresto, be sure to take it as soon as you remember. If the timing is too close to your next dose, just take your next scheduled dose. Be sure not to take more than one dose at a time. Taking multiple doses may increase your risk for more side effects. (See the “Entresto side effects” section above to learn more.) You should speak with your doctor about any missed doses, if you’re concerned.\n\nTo help make sure that you don’t miss a dose, try setting a reminder on your phone. A medication timer may be useful, too.\n\nWill I need to use this drug long term?\n\nEntresto is meant to be used as a long-term treatment. If you and your doctor determine that Entresto is safe and effective for you, you’ll likely take it long term.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves prescription drugs such as Entresto to treat certain conditions. Entresto is FDA-approved to treat some types of heart failure.\n\nEntresto may be used in adults with a type of chronic (ongoing) heart failure.* It works best in people with heart failure who also have a reduced ejection fraction. (This means that the left side of their heart is pumping out less blood than usual.)\n\nThe goal of the treatment is to help you live longer and reduce the risk of a heart failure-related hospital stay.\n\nOne of the drugs in Entresto, valsartan, is a type of medication called an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Entresto is usually given with other heart failure treatments instead of a different ARB or an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.\n\nEntresto may also be used in children ages 1 year and older who have a certain type of heart failure with symptoms. It’s called systemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which means that parts of the left side of the heart aren’t working as well as they should.\n\n* Based on the severity of your symptoms, your doctor will usually classify your heart failure. They may use a common system called the New York Heart Association Functional Classification.\n\nWhat is heart failure?\n\nHeart failure is a condition that occurs when your heart is weak and can’t pump enough blood to the rest of your body. When your blood flow is decreased, major organs (such as your lungs or kidneys) don’t work properly. This is because your body’s cells depend on your heart to deliver blood to them. The blood is filled with the oxygen and nutrients your organs’ cells need.\n\nCommon symptoms of heart failure can include:\n\nshortness of breath\n\nswelling in your ankles, feet, or legs\n\ncoughing\n\nconfusion or memory loss\n\nrapid weight gain\n\nfeeling tired or fatigued (lacking energy)\n\nDifferent heart conditions may lead to heart failure. For example, cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle that may cause you to have heart failure. In cardiomyopathy, the muscle of the heart becomes too thick or too thin, rigid, or enlarged. The heart weakens and is less able to pump blood throughout the body.\n\nThere are different types of heart failure. One type is known as congestive heart failure (CHF). With CHF, the blood flowing from the heart slows to form a bottleneck with the blood that’s returning to the heart. This backup causes congestion in your body’s tissues. Symptoms such as edema (swelling) and shortness of breath may occur as the fluid collects in your body.\n\nTo learn more about heart failure, visit our cardiovascular health hub.\n\nEffectiveness\n\nA study looked at adults who had certain types of chronic heart failure with symptoms. The study found that Entresto was effective when compared with enalapril, which is an ACE inhibitor. People in the study took either Entresto or enalapril for up to 4.3 years.\n\nThe results showed the following:\n\nThe number of heart-related deaths was lower for people who took Entresto (13.3%) than for people who took enalapril (16.5%).\n\nFewer people who took Entresto (12.8%) required a hospital stay for heart failure than people who took enalapril (15.6%).\n\nPeople who took Entresto had better overall survival rates than people who took enalapril. The rate of death in the Entresto group was 17%, compared with 19.8% in the enalapril group.\n\nHere are answers to some frequently asked questions about Entresto.\n\nIs Entresto a beta-blocker or diuretic?\n\nNo, Entresto isn’t a beta-blocker or a diuretic.\n\nEntresto contains two drugs. One is sacubitril, which is a type of medication called a neprilysin inhibitor. The second is valsartan, which is a type of medication called an angiotensin II receptor blocker.\n\nEntresto works differently from beta-blockers and diuretics. It helps your heart pump blood throughout your body more easily.\n\nBeta-blockers work by stopping the action of hormones such as adrenaline and noradrenaline. These drugs help lower your heart rate and blood pressure.\n\nDiuretics reduce the amount of fluid in your body. They’re also called water pills. They lessen swelling from fluids building up in your body, especially in your lower legs and ankles.\n\nIn some cases, your doctor may have you take Entresto with a beta-blocker or a diuretic to help manage your heart failure. Because Entresto and these drugs work in different ways, they’ll help with different heart failure symptoms.\n\nTalk with your doctor if you have any questions about your heart failure medications.\n\nIf I’m taking an ACE inhibitor, can I switch to Entresto? Will I need a ‘washout period’ when doing do?\n\nYes, if you’re taking a drug called an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, your doctor may have you switch to Entresto. They may choose to prescribe Entresto if an ACE inhibitor isn’t effective enough for you.\n\nHowever, there’s an increased risk of angioedema (a type of severe allergic reaction) when Entresto and an ACE inhibitor are used together. So you shouldn’t take Entresto within 36 hours of using an ACE inhibitor. That’s how long it takes for the ACE inhibitor to be out of your system. Your doctor may refer to this 36-hour window of time as a “washout period.”\n\nIf you have any questions about switching from an ACE inhibitor to Entresto, talk with your doctor.\n\nCan I suddenly stop taking Entresto?\n\nIf your doctor recommends it, you can abruptly stop taking this drug. Doing so isn’t known to cause problems.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that symptoms of the condition Entresto was treating may come back if the treatment is stopped. So your doctor will likely recommend another treatment to replace Entresto.\n\nBefore stopping Entresto or any other prescribed medications, be sure to talk with your doctor.\n\nAn exception is if you become pregnant while taking Entresto. In that case, stop taking Entresto right away, but call your doctor and let them know. Entresto can cause fetal toxicity (fetal harm).* (To learn more, see the “FDA warning: Fetal harm” section above.)\n\n* Entresto has a boxed warning for fetal toxicity. This is the most serious warning from the FDA. Boxed warnings alert doctors and patients about drug effects that may be dangerous.\n\nCan I still exercise if I’m using Entresto?\n\nYes, you can remain active with different types of exercise while taking Entresto. According to the American College of Cardiology, examples of activities that may be recommended for some people with heart failure include:\n\nwalking\n\nrowing\n\ncycling\n\nclimbing stairs\n\nlifting weights\n\nusing the weight of your body for exercises\n\nSpeak with your doctor about the kinds of exercise activities that may be right for you. Being active every day is an important part of managing heart failure. To help you stay on track, your doctor may have you join a cardiac rehabilitation program. This program has trained staff who can teach you how to exercise safely.\n\nIt’s important to note your daily activities while taking Entresto. Share this information with your doctor at every visit. This way, they can see how much exercise you’re getting.\n\nThe manufacturer of Entresto, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, offers a patient program that provides lifestyle support, including exercise tips, while you’re taking Entresto. You can learn more about the program by visiting the manufacturer’s website.\n\nCan I use Entresto if I’m on dialysis?\n\nEntresto hasn’t been studied in people with heart failure who are on dialysis. (Dialysis is a treatment that removes waste and excess water, and sometimes drugs, from your blood.) Therefore, it’s hard to determine how well Entresto would work and if it’s safe to take while you’re on dialysis.\n\nEntresto attaches tightly to proteins in your blood, which means the drug can’t be removed during dialysis. Kidney problems such as kidney failure are possible serious side effects of taking Entresto. (To learn more, see the “Entresto side effects” section above.) So if your kidneys aren’t working properly and you aren’t on dialysis, your doctor will likely give you a lower dose of Entresto.\n\nIf you have heart failure and are currently on dialysis, talk with your doctor to find the right medication for your condition.\n\nWill Entresto affect my BNP level?\n\nYes. Taking Entresto can affect your B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level. BNP is a hormone that your heart makes. Your doctor may check your blood levels of BNP and a related hormone called NT-proBNP to monitor your heart failure.\n\nBNP and NT-proBNP levels typically go up when heart failure worsens. They’ll go down when heart failure is stable. BNP and NT-proBNP don’t cause heart failure. They’re just chemical markers that your doctor uses to check your heart health and your heart’s response to Entresto.\n\nSacubitril, one of the active drugs in Entresto, blocks your body from breaking down BNP. This causes BNP levels to rise when you take Entresto. Sacubitril doesn’t block the breakdown of NT-proBNP, though, so NT-proBNP levels will fall when you take Entresto.\n\nYour doctor will factor in Entresto’s effects on BNP and NT-proBNP when they review your blood test results.\n\nEntresto can interact with several other medications. It may also interact with certain supplements as well as certain foods.\n\nDifferent interactions can cause different effects. For instance, some interactions can interfere with how well a drug works. Other interactions can increase the number of side effects or make them more severe.\n\nEntresto and other medications\n\nBelow is a list of medications that can interact with Entresto. This list doesn’t contain all drugs that may interact with Entresto.\n\nBefore taking Entresto, talk with your doctor and pharmacist. Tell them about all prescription, over-the-counter, and other drugs you take. Also tell them about any vitamins, herbs, and supplements you use. Sharing this information can help you avoid potential interactions.\n\nIf you have questions about drug interactions that may affect you, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nEntresto and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\n\nTaking Entresto and a drug called an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor may increase your risk for angioedema (a type of severe allergic reaction). So you shouldn’t take Entresto within 36 hours of using an ACE inhibitor. That’s how long it takes for the ACE inhibitor to be out of your system.\n\nExamples of ACE inhibitors include:\n\nenalapril (Vasotec)\n\nlisinopril (Zestril, Prinivil)\n\nfosinopril\n\ncaptopril\n\nperindopril\n\nquinapril (Accupril)\n\nramipril (Altace)\n\ntrandolapril\n\nIf you’re taking an ACE inhibitor, talk with your doctor before you start Entresto treatment. They can help with the timing of the two medications.\n\nEntresto and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)\n\nOne of the two drugs in Entresto is valsartan, which is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Taking Entresto with another ARB may raise the level of the ARBs in your body and increase your risk for side effects. (For more about side effects, see the “Entresto side effects” section above.)\n\nExamples of ARBs include:\n\nvalsartan (Diovan)\n\nlosartan (Cozaar)\n\ncandesartan (Atacand)\n\nFor this reason, doctors typically won’t prescribe another ARB if you’re taking Entresto. If you’re taking an ARB, talk with your doctor before you start Entresto treatment. They’ll suggest that you stop taking the ARB before you begin Entresto treatment.\n\nEntresto and certain diuretics\n\nDiuretics are a kind of medication that reduce the amount of fluid in your body. They’re also called water pills. Certain diuretics that prevent your body from getting rid of potassium are known as potassium-sparing diuretics.\n\nA possible side effect of Entresto is hyperkalemia (a high level of potassium in the blood). So taking Entresto with a potassium-sparing diuretic may increase the level of potassium in your body even more.\n\nExamples of potassium-sparing diuretics include:\n\nspironolactone (Aldactone)\n\namiloride (Midamor)\n\ntriamterene (Dyrenium)\n\neplerenone (Inspra)\n\nIf you’re taking a potassium-sparing diuretic, tell your doctor before you start Entresto treatment. They’ll monitor the potassium level in your blood to help make sure it’s managed throughout your treatment.\n\nEntresto and lithium\n\nTaking Entresto with lithium (Lithobid) can cause the lithium to rise to an unsafe level in your body. This can lead to serious side effects.\n\nIf you’re taking lithium with Entresto, your doctor will monitor your lithium level and side effects more closely. They may recommend a different dosage of lithium.\n\nEntresto and herbs and supplements\n\nThere aren’t any herbs or supplements that have been specifically reported to interact with Entresto. However, you should still check with your doctor or pharmacist before using any of these products while taking Entresto.\n\nEntresto and foods\n\nEntresto isn’t known to interact with any foods.\n\nYou may wonder how Entresto compares with other medications that are prescribed for similar uses. Here, we look at how Entresto and losartan are alike and different.\n\nIngredients\n\nEntresto contains two active drugs: sacubitril and valsartan. Losartan contains one active drug: losartan.\n\nUses\n\nHere’s some information about the uses of Entresto and losartan.\n\nEntresto uses\n\nEntresto is FDA-approved for use in adults with a type of chronic (ongoing) heart failure.* It works best in people with heart failure who also have a reduced ejection fraction. (This means that the left side of their heart is pumping out less blood than usual.)\n\nThe goal of the treatment is to help you live longer and reduce the risk of a heart failure-related hospital stay. Entresto is usually given with other heart failure treatments instead of a different ARB or an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.\n\nEntresto is also approved to be used in children ages 1 year and older who have a certain type of heart failure with symptoms. It’s called systemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which means that parts of the left side of the heart aren’t working as well as they should.\n\n* For more about this type of heart failure, see the “Entresto for heart failure” section above.\n\nLosartan uses\n\nLosartan is FDA-approved to:\n\ntreat high blood pressure in adults as well as children ages 6 years and older\n\nreduce the risk of stroke in adults with high blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). LVH is a disorder in which the heart’s left pumping chamber becomes thick and isn’t able to pump as well.\n\ntreat diabetic nephropathy (a serious kidney disease brought on by diabetes) in adults with type 2 diabetes and a history of high blood pressure\n\nDrug forms and administration\n\nEntresto and losartan both come as tablets. Entresto is taken twice a day, while losartan is taken once a day.\n\nIf you can’t swallow tablets, your pharmacist can crush the drugs and mix them with a liquid for you to drink. This form is called an oral suspension.\n\nSide effects and risks\n\nEntresto contains a drug that’s an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and losartan is an ARB. Therefore, the medications can cause side effects that are similar and different. Below are examples of these side effects.\n\nMore common side effects\n\nThese lists contain examples of more common side effects that can occur with Entresto, with losartan, or with both drugs (when taken individually).\n\nCan occur with Entresto:\n\ncough\n\nCan occur with losartan:\n\nupper respiratory infection (common cold)\n\nstuffy nose\n\nback pain\n\nCan occur with both Entresto and losartan:\n\ndizziness\n\nSerious side effects\n\nThese lists contain examples of serious side effects that can occur with Entresto, with losartan, or with both drugs (when taken individually).\n\nCan occur with Entresto:\n\nsevere allergic reaction, such as angioedema\n\nCan occur with losartan:\n\nfew unique serious side effects\n\nCan occur with both Entresto and losartan:\n\nfetal toxicity (fetal harm)*\n\nhypotension (low blood pressure)\n\nkidney problems, such as kidney failure\n\nhyperkalemia (high level of potassium in the blood)\n\n* Entresto and losartan have a boxed warning for fetal toxicity. This is the most serious warning from the FDA. Boxed warnings alert doctors and patients about drug effects that may be dangerous. To learn more, see the “FDA warning: Fetal harm” section at the beginning of this article.\n\nEffectiveness\n\nEntresto and losartan have different FDA-approved uses.\n\nThese drugs haven’t been directly compared in clinical studies, but studies have found both Entresto and losartan to be effective for treating heart failure. However, losartan isn’t FDA-approved to treat heart failure, so that would be considered an off-label use. (Off-label drug use is when a drug that’s approved for one use is prescribed for a different one that’s not approved.)\n\nCosts\n\nEntresto is a brand-name drug, and it’s not currently available in generic form. Losartan is a generic drug. Brand-name medications usually cost more than generics.\n\nThe exact price you’ll pay for either drug depends on your insurance plan, your location, and the pharmacy you use.\n\nYou may wonder how Entresto compares with other medications that are prescribed for similar uses. Here we look at how Entresto and enalapril are alike and different.\n\nIngredients\n\nEntresto contains two active drugs: sacubitril and valsartan. Enalapril contains one active drug: enalapril.\n\nUses\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved both Entresto and enalapril to treat heart failure. This is a condition in which your heart is weak and can’t pump enough blood to the rest of your body.\n\nEntresto uses\n\nEntresto is FDA-approved for use in adults with a type of chronic (ongoing) heart failure.* It works best in people with heart failure who also have a reduced ejection fraction. (This means that the left side of their heart is pumping out less blood than usual.)\n\nThe goal of the treatment is to help you live longer and reduce the risk of a heart-failure related hospital stay. Entresto is usually given with other heart failure treatments instead of a different ARB or an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.\n\nEntresto is also approved to be used in children ages 1 year and older who have a certain type of heart failure with symptoms. It’s called systemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which means that parts of the left side of the heart aren’t working as well as they should.\n\n* For more about this type of heart failure, see the “Entresto for heart failure” section above.\n\nEnalapril uses\n\nEnalapril is FDA-approved to treat adults with congestive heart failure who have symptoms. The drug is usually prescribed with other drugs for this purpose. Enalapril is also approved to treat high blood pressure in children and adults, and a type of heart problem called asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (the left side of the heart doesn’t work properly).\n\nDrug forms and administration\n\nBoth Entresto and enalapril come as tablets that you take two times each day for heart failure. If you can’t swallow tablets, your pharmacist can crush the drugs and mix them with a liquid for you to drink. This form is called an oral suspension.\n\nSide effects and risks\n\nEntresto and enalapril are both used to treat heart failure, but they contain different drugs. Therefore, the medications can cause side effects that are similar and different. Below are examples of these side effects.\n\nMore common side effects\n\nThese lists contain examples of more common side effects that can occur with Entresto, with enalapril, or with both drugs (when taken individually).\n\nCan occur with Entresto:\n\nfew unique common side effects\n\nCan occur with enalapril:\n\npain in your chest or belly\n\nweakness\n\ndiarrhea\n\nnausea or vomiting\n\nheadache\n\ninfections in your urinary tract, lungs (pneumonia), and upper respiratory tract (bronchitis)\n\nshortness of breath\n\nrash\n\nCan occur with both Entresto and enalapril:\n\ndizziness\n\ncough\n\nSerious side effects\n\nThese lists contain examples of serious side effects that can occur with Entresto, with enalapril, or with both drugs (when taken individually).\n\nCan occur with Entresto:\n\nhyperkalemia (high level of potassium in the blood)\n\nCan occur with enalapril:\n\nangioedema (a type of severe allergic reaction) in your intestines\n\nneutropenia and agranulocytosis, which are decreases in the levels of certain white blood cells\n\nliver failure\n\nCan occur with both Entresto and enalapril:\n\nkidney problems, such as kidney failure\n\nfetal toxicity (fetal harm)*\n\nsevere allergic reaction\n\nhypotension (low blood pressure)\n\n*Entresto and enalapril have a boxed warning for fetal toxicity. This is the most serious warning from the FDA. Boxed warnings alert doctors and patients about drug effects that may be dangerous. To learn more, see the “FDA warning: Fetal harm” section at the beginning of this article.\n\nEffectiveness\n\nEntresto and enalapril have different FDA-approved uses, but they’re both used to treat heart failure in adults.\n\nThe use of Entresto and enalapril in treating heart failure has been directly compared in a clinical study.\n\nResearchers looked at adults who had certain types of chronic heart failure with symptoms.\n\nEntresto was effective when compared with enalapril in adults with certain types of chronic heart failure having symptoms. People in the study took either Entresto or enalapril for up to 4.3 years. The results showed the following:\n\nThe number of heart-related deaths was lower for people who took Entresto (13.3%) than for people who took enalapril (16.5%).\n\nFewer people who took Entresto (12.8%) required a hospital stay for heart failure than people who took enalapril (15.6%).\n\nPeople who took Entresto had better overall survival rates than people who took enalapril. The rate of death in the Entresto group was 17%, compared with 19.8% in the enalapril group.\n\nCosts\n\nEntresto is a brand-name drug, and it’s not currently available in generic form. Enalapril is a generic drug. Brand-name medications usually cost more than generics.\n\nThe exact price you’ll pay for either drug depends on your insurance plan, your location, and the pharmacy you use.\n\nThe following information is provided for clinicians and other healthcare professionals.\n\nIndications\n\nEntresto (sacubitril/valsartan) is indicated for use in:\n\nadults with chronic heart failure to decrease the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure\n\nchildren ages 1 year and older who have symptomatic heart failure and systemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction\n\nEntresto is usually given with other heart failure therapies. It’s used in place of certain others, such as an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) or an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nEntresto contains two drugs. These are sacubitril, which is a neprilysin inhibitor, and valsartan, which is an angiotensin II receptor blocker.\n\nEntresto inhibits the neutral endopeptidase, neprilysin, through the active metabolite of sacubitril called LBQ657. Sacubitril is a prodrug. Valsartan blocks the angiotensin II type-1 (AT1) receptor, which inhibits the effects of angiotensin II.\n\nPharmacokinetics and metabolism\n\nFollowing oral administration of Entresto, peak plasma concentrations are reached in 0.5 hours for sacubitril, 2 hours for LBQ657 (the active metabolite of sacubitril), and 1.5 hours for valsartan. After twice-a-day dosing with Entresto, steady state is reached in 3 days.\n\nSacubitril is metabolized via esterases to LBQ657. LBQ657 does not undergo appreciable metabolism. Valsartan is only minimally metabolized (approximately 20% of the dose).\n\nThe mean elimination half-life is 1.4 hours for sacubitril, 11.5 hours for LBQ657, and 9.9 hours for valsartan.\n\nContraindications\n\nEntresto is contraindicated in patients who:\n\nhave a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to sacubitril, valsartan, or any of the other excipients in the product\n\nhave a history of angioedema due to previous ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy\n\nare taking concomitant ACE inhibitors (must be separated by at least 36 hours)\n\nhave diabetes and are taking aliskiren\n\nStorage\n\nEntresto tablets should be stored at room temperature (68°F to 77°F/20°C to 25°C) in a tightly sealed container away from light. Excursions are allowed from 59°F to 86°F (15°C to 30°C). Avoid storing this medication in moist areas.\n\nThe prepared Entresto suspension (liquid to be taken by mouth) can be stored at room temperature (68°F to 77°F/20°C to 25°C) for up to 15 days. The Entresto suspension shouldn’t be refrigerated.\n\nDisclaimer: Medical News Today has made every effort to make certain that all information is factually correct, comprehensive, and up to date.
