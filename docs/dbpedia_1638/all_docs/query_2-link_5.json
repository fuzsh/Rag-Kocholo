        "text": "The rate of radioactive decay is often characterized by the half-life of a radioisotope. Half-life \\(\\left( t_{1/2} \\right)\\) is the time required for one half of the nuclei in a sample of radioactive material to decay. After each half-life has passed, one half of the radioactive nuclei will have transformed into a new nuclide (see table below). The rate of decay and the half-life do not depend on the original size of the sample. They also do not depend upon environmental factors such as temperature and pressure.\n\nTable \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) Number of Half-Lives Passed Fraction Remaining Percentage Remaining Mass remaining starting with \\(80 \\: \\text{g}\\) 1 1/2 50 \\(40 \\: \\text{g}\\) 2 1/4 25 \\(20 \\: \\text{g}\\) 3 1/8 12.5 \\(10 \\: \\text{g}\\) 4 1/16 6.25 \\(5.0 \\: \\text{g}\\) 5 1/32 3.125 \\(2.5 \\: \\text{g}\\)\n\nAs an example, iodine-131 is a radioisotope with a half-life of 8 days. It decays by beta particle emission into xenon-131.\n\n\\[\\ce{^{131}_{53}I} \\rightarrow \\ce{^{131}_{54}Xe} + \\ce{^0_{-1}e}\\]\n\nAfter eight days have passed, half of the atoms of any sample of iodine-131 will have decayed, and the sample will now be \\(50\\%\\) iodine-131 and \\(50\\%\\) xenon-131. After another eight days pass (a total of 16 days or 2 half-lives), the sample will be \\(25\\%\\) iodine-131 and \\(75\\%\\) xenon-131. This continues until the entire sample of iodine-131. has completely decayed (see figure below).\n\nHalf-lives have a very wide range, from billions of years to fractions of a second. Listed below (see table below) are the half-lives of some common and important radioisotopes. Those with half-lives on the scale of hours or days are the ones most suitable for use in medical treatment.\n\nTable \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\) Nuclide Half-Life \\(\\left( t_{1/2} \\right)\\) Decay Mode Carbon-14 5730 years \\(\\beta^-\\) Cobalt-60 5.27 years \\(\\beta^-\\) Francium-220 27.5 seconds \\(\\alpha\\) Hydrogen-3 12.26 years \\(\\beta^-\\) Iodine-131 8.07 days \\(\\beta^-\\) Nitrogen-16 7.2 seconds \\(\\beta^-\\) Phosphorus-32 14.3 days \\(\\beta^-\\) Plutonium-239 24,100 years \\(\\alpha\\) Potassium-40 \\(1.28 \\times 10^9\\) years \\(\\beta^-\\) and \\(\\ce{e^-}\\) capture Radium-226 1600 years \\(\\alpha\\) Radon-222 3.82 days \\(\\alpha\\) Strontium-90 28.1 days \\(\\beta^-\\) Technetium-99 \\(2.13 \\times 10^5\\) years \\(\\beta^-\\) Thorium-234 24.1 days \\(\\beta^-\\) Uranium-235 \\(7.04 \\times 10^8\\) years \\(\\alpha\\) Uranium-238 \\(4.47 \\times 10^9\\) years \\(\\alpha\\)\n\nThe following example illustrates how to use the half-life of a sample to determine the amount of radioisotope that remains after a certain period of time has passed."
