        "text": "People today live in a connected environment that can negatively or positively affect almost all aspects of life. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a term used to describe the ubiquitous smart devices that can connect to the Internet. The IoT was described by advocates as \" the first real evolution of the Internet \" that can improve the way people live-in terms of education, work, health care, entertainment and so forth. However, the IoT has a cost especially when it comes to security and privacy. It also raises serious questions which need to be legally addressed. For example, how these smart devices generated, stored and collected information? Who own that information? And who will be responsible in case of damage? This paper attempts to discuss the concept of the IoT from various aspects-including its pros and cons-in order to clarify the term as it is used by the experts and researchers. In addition to that, the paper also goes further to touch upon the IoT's challenges to privacy from legal perspective. Last but not least, the paper provides recommendations on how to protect privacy and reap IoT's advantages. Furthermore, it is argued that a study such this will positively contribute to the academic discussion as it looks at IoT from one of its most contentious aspects (privacy challenges) that could slow IoT progress.\n\nThe aim of the law is to maintain social order, peace, and justice in society, whereas the aim of ethics is to provide codes of ethics and conduct that help people to decide what is wrong, and how to act and behave. Laws provide a minimum set of standards for obtaining good human behavior. Ethics often provides standards that exceed the legal minimum. Therefore, for the best behavior, both law and ethics should be respected. The Internet of Things (IoT) involves a large number of objects and humans that are connected via the Internet 'anytime' and 'anyplace' to provide homogeneous communication and contextual services. Thus, it creates a new social, economic, political, and ethical landscape that needs new enhanced legal and ethical measures for privacy protection, data security, ownership protection, trust improvement, and the development of proper standards. This survey and opinion article is concerned with the ethics and legislation of the IoT and provides an overview of the following: definition and history of the IoT; general ethical principles and theories that are available for application in the IoT; the role of governments in the IoT; regulations in the European Union (EU) and United States for the IoT' IoT characteristics that have the potential to create ethical problems; IoT ethical questions and principles; IoT security, privacy, and trust aspects; and the ethical culture of IoT-related companies.\n\nThe article explores the socio-ontological foundations of the phenomenon of reputation in the context of todayâ€™s ever-encroaching cyberworld. The categories of whoness and value are essential for understanding reputation ontologically. The cyberworld itself has only become historically possible through the Cartesian mathematical cast of being and its digital refinement in the Universal Turing Machine. From one perspective, the cyberworld is an endless concatenation of Turing machines. It is, however, also a matrix in which bit-strings circulate that have a decisive impact on who anybody is held to be by others, i.e. on their reputation. The game of striving to be esteemed as who you are thus assumes a new complexion in the digital era.\n\nThis paper likens the current state of reputation law to a Gordian knot, entangled in complexities and calling for novel thinking to make it relevant to our public and private lives. Its central thesis is that digital speech is ontologically different from offline speech and so calls for a more informed response to the harms it can inflict in order to determine whether legal or extra-legal mechanisms are most restorative. In spite of a wealth of international norms that address the value of personal reputation, they have had minimal influences on regional and domestic laws of the European Union and the United States, reflecting the deeply rooted cultural differences on each side of the Atlantic that shape laws of privacy and free speech. In conclusion, implications for future methods of addressing online reputational harm outside of traditional legal systems are discussed."
