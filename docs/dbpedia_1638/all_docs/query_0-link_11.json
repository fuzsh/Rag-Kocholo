Software packages line up ACORN managing director Brian Long is under no illusion about the vital rote of software support for Archimedes, “It will take this to exploit the full power of the machine\", he told The Micro User, That's why a number of lead¬ ing software houses have been working secretly for months on packages for the Rise machines, Grafox is scheduled to release Logistics, a Lotus 1-2-3 clone for the machine in August. September will see the arrival of AWriter, described as r( a completely fresh look at a wordprocessor'. The same month Clares will launch a desktop publishing page make-up package and AMS will unveil electronic pub¬ lishing software. Also timed to coincide with the machine going on sale will be Rise versions of Logo from Logrotron, teiesoftware support and a comms package from BBC Soft, plus the Stargllder and Flight Simulator games from Argonaut. “Developers who have been working with the machine are understandably very excited about the creative possibilities it offers 1 ! says Brian Long. Enter Archimedes — the world's speediest micro ARCHIMEDES, the world’s fastest micro, has been unveiled by Acorn. The covers have finally come off the top secret machine on which the future of the company will rest. Even the entry level model, the A300. is revealed as being 20 times faster than the BBC Micro and - at half a megabyte - has a memory capacity 15 times greater. The basic machine carries a £799 price tag but this does not include a monitor. With a monochrome unit, the cost will rise to £849 and for colour £999. Launched at the same time is the 1Mb A310 costing £875. With a black and white monitor, the price will increase to £925, with colour £1,075. However these remarkable machines will not go on sale to the general public until September. But remarkable they truly are. For the technology involved means that they are currently ticking over “stone cold 1 ' at 4 Mips (million instructions per second). Only the fact that the memory EVERY Rise machine sold will be registered in order that the pur¬ chaser can be offered future enhancements. “Such is the nature of the technology that 'bits and pieces' can be added at any time\", said an Acorn spokesman. “And we want people to have the opportunity to take advantage of these as they come along”. cannot as yet keep up with the processor power prevents the wonder micro from gearing up to 14 Mips - 70 times faster than the BBC Micro. Already benchmark tests have shown Archimedes has the technology to outperform the IBM PC AT and Apple Mac¬ intosh by a ratio of 20 to one - and it offers five times more power than the VAX 11/750. It can even take on and beat a GEC 63, a computer that costs more than 20 times as much. Such is the sophistication of the new computers that add-ons will allow them to emulate other machine PROGRAMMABLE GRAPHICS WHAT is claimed to be the world's first programmable graphics package for the BBC Micro. System Gamma, has been launched by Minerva Systems. And programming skills are not required to use it. The package is completely definable displaying as many charts on screen as may be required in the form of scatter, histogram, line and pie charts. These are also definable allowing the user to custo¬ mise the screen format. Once a graph is plotted screens may be saved for customisation by an individual s own programs or by the built in screen editor. Price £49.95 from Minerva Systems (0392 37756) environments, including IBM. And all this from only four chips which offer not only speed and large memories but outstanding graphics and even stereo sound. However Archimedes isn't just one computer but an ongoing series of world-beating micros aimed at every conceiv¬ able market niche. And each one will be based on the revolutionary 32-bit Rise chip technology devel¬ oped by Acorn but now manu¬ factured under licence in the States. “This is just the beginning\", Brian Long, Acorn s managing director told The Micro User. But probably the most apt comment came from Acorn executive Bob Coates. \"We now feel the good old days are here again ', he said. # For an in-depth review of Archi¬ medes turn to Page 16. ACORN’S boffins have designed the Rise machines to encour age third party manufacturers to come up with an exciting new range of peripherals. For one. the system can take 16 podufes slot in cards - making provision for such devices as modems. 'We ve done this with an eye on people like Watford Elec¬ tronics who have provided such superb support in the past\", said a company spokesman. ' Em sure it won t be long before well be seeing some fascinating products from them\". August 1987 MICRO USER 7 First-Class Utility Software & Printers from the Professionals.

NEWS Watford DDFS upgrade A FASTER, more flexible, and friendlier version of the original Watford DDFS board for the BBC Micro has been produced, Watford (0923 37774) has redesigned the board to give it additional facilities while at the same time making it snidller, ensuring that it fits with alt third-party rom boards. Now it is Acorn ADFS com¬ patible “ through a £25 rom — and has appropriate built-in host codes to allow a second processor to be used directly , ft will work in both single and double density mode , The DDFS Mark // is com¬ patible with almost alt soft¬ ware and has automatic 40/80 track sensing, Among a host of other fea¬ tures it has 80 per cent storage increase , it allows a fife the full size of the disc , and has an option to double the speed of fife handling by switching off error check operations. Watford says that users with a DDFS of any manufac¬ ture can ugrade to the Mark It for £30 if they send in rom and DDFS board. Otherwise, the price is £39. Twin pack A COMBINED Z80 second processor and software pack¬ age for the BBC Micro has been launched by Kreff com¬ puter services. Task Master combines C/PM compatible operating systems with an assembler, monitor, debugging package and Borland International’s Turbo Pascal running at 6mhz on a emos Z8G processor. The combined package gives Unix like flexibility to the BBC Micro, A CP/N package is also available for the Torch CP/N second processor. Price £325 for the complete pack¬ age and £130 for the soft¬ ware from Kreff (0248 810748) First Archimedes software THE first third-party product to be announced in support of the new Acorn Archimedes has come from Minerva Sys¬ tems of Exeter, The firm is promising a 'wide product range'' for the machine, including three databases. Minerva (0392 37756) say the first — Deltabase - was originally designed as a testbed for its comprehensive database management system. The product will be released at a budget price of £24.95, despite the fact that it offers a higher specification than the company’s System Delta for the BBC Micro Deltabase makes use of the 40. 80. and 132 column screen modes, operates with more than 8,000 records, allows 256 subsets and requires no technical know¬ ledge from the user. Soon to follow i$ System Deltabase which, claims Minerva, makes IBM data¬ bases look insignificant. This has up to two billion records and 16 million fields. Fast data handling, com¬ prehensive searches and mail labeling generator are other main features of the £69.95 product. Later in the year, the com¬ pany promises SuperDetta which features program¬ mability. even by non technical users. For the more advanced, all internal work¬ ings will be definable and there will be a soundex facility to find words through their sound Also coming: a range of add-on utilities and a full accountancy suite. School administration, timetabling, ancestry finding programs will follow later. Testing program A GRAPHICS library for use with AMX’s Pagemaker on the BBC Micro has been expanded to 20 categories. The latest additions include history, geography, fashion, reptiles and rock P n f roll. Each of the discs in the Pagemaker Graphics Library from Micro Studio (0353 721736} has 30 cutouts, They can be bought in a var¬ iety of combinations, from £2 a disc. The company has also released Videpak, a three- disc set costing £10, which contains more than 150 compressed pictures on three double sided 80-track discs. UNABLE to find a suitable per¬ sonnel selection program on the market, Dutch head¬ hunting firm Search and Selection developed its own. Now it is marketing the Dianet computer-aided per¬ sonnel selection package which operates as a local area network on the Master series. The system provides for the simultaneous independent testing of up to 40 people. Candidates’ introduction. ACORN'S outstanding Rise technology will not be confined to the company's new com- puters. Currently there are more than 100 companies reported to be working with it on projects ranging from laser printers instructions and monitoring during the session can be conducted in a choice of En¬ glish, French or Dutch. An examiner can administer tests from his own office, change the mix of questions, monitor the progress of can¬ didates' terminals, watch on screen or print out available results. Dianet is available from Search and Selection, Qude Houtlei 125. 9000 Gent, The Netherlands. through to traffic guidance systems. \"Our research puts us 100 mites apart from the Amstrads of this worfd\", observed one company spokesman. \"We are about jobs in South Wales not South Korea\". Memory booster A WAY of producing a longer memory on BBC Micros has been developed at the Uni¬ versity of East Anglia, Overlay Basic, published by Elsevier-Biosoft (0223 68622), comes as an eprom and utility disc This allows BBC Basic programs to call procedures from disc, use and then literally \"forget\" them. The main advantage of the package, which is claimed to be easy to patch into BBC Sasic, is that it allows very long programs to be run on a BBC Micro, High technology August 1987 MICRO USER 9 iSEVvS NEW news editor of Micronet, the viewdata information service, is Ian Burley. He moves over from the the BBC Microbase and features editor's desk on the closed user group on Prestef, replacing Dave Rosenbaum, who has become Micronet public relations manager. The debt collector SOLICITOR and law lecturer Tom Hervey has begun mar¬ keting a system to help legal firms computerise their debt collection departments. Called Accudebt it runs on a dual disc Master Compact fitted with Wordwise Plus along with a Microperipherals MR-200 with sheet feed. Hervey has used Basic for the data entry and much of the data storage, and for production of documents involving arrays. These include long lists of invoices, each with separate interest calculation. Relevant data is then trans¬ ferred to Wordwise Pius for further text manipulation leading to creation of the standard letters and certain text-heavy documents. There are Wordwise Plus files for address data storage and for the diary system. Hervey says the 640k drives allow storage of data on 'well over 1,000 matters, along with the programs them¬ selves. on two easily back- uppable floppies - something impossible on an IBM\", Accudebt is available from Acculaw (0203 523215) in a package including the Master Compact for £3.000, First with the news PROVING yet again that you always read the latest news first in The Micro User , our prize letter from April has just turned up in a rival publi¬ cation. Reader Jim Sharp of Fea- therstone, West Yorkshire, won our award for discovering a way to save valuable disc space when programming, He successfully demon¬ strated how the *SPOOL command can be used to produce compressed screen dumps to disc. One of the magazines attempting to compete with us in covering the Acorn market ran the same spool tip as hot news In its June issue. Which was good news for Jim Sharpe who got another £10 for his discovery, but old news for readers of the maga¬ zine in question — particularly those who had already seen The Micro User two months earlier. ware. Micr oStutt mi Pl «.U I IVl't Manufactured by Supra in the US, the MicroStuffer operates very much as a normal primer buffer But it is a separate hardware device which leaves all the micro's memory free. The product is connected between the computer and printer. It automatically buff¬ ers any data sent to the prin¬ ter, which frees the computer for other work. Frontier (0423 67140) say MicroStuffer includes a self test which checks the 64k ram on switch-on. It also has a repeat button which allows the contents of the buffer to be printed more than once - for such things as mail shots.

GOVERNMENT AND EDUCATIONAL ORDERS ACCEPTED Switch on for a cardigan READERS of The Micro User have been bitten by the knit¬ ting bug thanks to a new suite of programs that went on sale last month. Knitwear Designer was developed from an article in the June issue of The Micro User which encouraged people to produce their own money-saving sweater pat¬ terns on the B 8 C Micro. Since then many have writ¬ ten or phoned to say how much more the package can do with a touch of imagin¬ ation. H< You don't have to restrict yourself to jumpers”, said one. *Tve designed some cardigans and sleeveless pul¬ lovers with Knitwear Designer -and even some woollies for my children's teddy bears\". A reader phoned to say: Tve been able to save a tot of money by using the freehand program to produce knitwear in my youngsters' school cot ours... a lot cheaper than anything in the shops\". Another wrote: ‘Tm finding Knitwear Designer isn't just for adult woollies 7 - it's pos¬ sible to make little coats and matinee jackets for babies, and skirts for my little girl\". Details of how to obtain the five-program suite are on Page 15.

Squeak, which is a rom and disc based program, gives the BBC Micro Prestel emulation and can be controlled either from the keyboard or by a mouse. One interesting fea¬ ture is the ability to access Prestel in either Mode 7 or Mode 1. When in Mode 1 the frame occupies about 75 per cent of the screen.

Acorn has jumped back onto centre stage of the computer scene with a family of micros that seems destined to keep the company in the spotlight for years to come, It has taken a dramatic leap from the world of 8-bit - by-passing the hotly con¬ tested 16-bit market to top the bill in the as yet to be explored wonderful world of 32-bit. Just as the Acorn's backroom boys provided the company with a relatively unassailable lead - at the time with the first BBC Micro, so they’ve done it again with Archimedes. And they’ve even managed to edge out mighty IBM in the finishing straight in the 32-bit slakes. Most of the credit must go to Acorn’s research and development team — and the strong nerves of the top manage¬ ment who backed them. For whereas it was the brilliance of the backroom boys who helped develop the revolutionary Rise chip on which Archi¬ medes is based, it was the Acorn execu- Archimedes, the world's fastest micro, has finally arrived. We tell you all you want to know about Acorn's wonder machine tives who kept on bankrolling them even during financially troubled times. The end result, however* will reap divi¬ dends for years to come, Archimedes - like the BBC Micro - is a machine ahead of its time. Or rather a family of machines, with successive generations - each one more powerful than the other - to be released over the next few years. Such is the technology within that even the first models to be unveiled the A300 series - are faster than any micros ever seen before. And the power is still almost untap¬ ped. For the Rise chip's performance is currently limited only by the Memc chip, the memory controller which can only handle up to 4Mb for the time being. A mind-boggling array of advanced features to be found in Archimedes - a 4,096 colour palette with a possible colours on screen at any time, eight channel stereo sound, WIMPs and anti¬ aliasing. which smooths out the block¬ like structure of conventional computer graphics. Yet it still retains definite links with its famous predecessor, the BBC Micro. Whereas there are 21 screen modes, eight are the same as the BBC Micro. And the operating system, Arthur, supports all the old familiar *FX calls together with numerous extensions and entirely new ones. Acorn has even developed software to allow Archimedes to emulate the BBC Micro’s 6502 processor. It is a machine for the future that hasn't forgotten its roots, # A team from The Micro User has already met Archimedes - their words and pictures can be found on the next few pages.

This should mean a great improve¬ ment in the appearance of graphics and pictures, with shading and shadows effectively portrayed as well as more meaningful colours for particular appli¬ cations. Turn to Page 18 ► PALETTE One of the great attractions of the Archi¬ medes is the analogue cotour palette which allows any pixel on the screen to be displayed as one of 4 T 096 different colours- The original BBC Micro has a digital palette that can be accessed with the VDU19 command. In effect this means that any pixel on the screen can be dis¬ played as any one of eight different colours. This extends to 16 if you can regard \"flashing\" as a colour. But have you ever wondered what the extra zeros are for on the end of the VDU19 statement? They are to extend it to control the analogue palette. With the original BBC Micro any one of the three guns on the TV display can be on or off. With the Archimedes each gun can be made to vary its intensity. In fact there are 16 different levels of brightness that can be produced by each of the red, green and blue guns in the monitor. This enables you to mix the three guns in varying proportions, producing subtle shading and colours No longer do programmers have to stick to the gaudy primary and secondary colours. Now a whole host of golds, < From Page 17 GRAPHICS THE first thing that really stands out on the Archimedes is the graphics - there are 21 modes as seen in Table I. The first eight exactly match the old BBC Micro modes to allow software to transfer easily to the new machine. Mode 7 on the BBC Micro is implemen¬ ted with special hardware whereas on the Archimedes it is simulated. This is possible due to the great speed of the Rise chip. With at least half a megabyte of memory in the machine Table t: Arthur screen modes even the most memory-hungry modes do not take up an excessive amount of memory. Of major interest are modes 10. 13 and 15 which allow eight bits to be assigned to each pixel giving a total of 256 different colours on the screen at the same time. This can be used for shading or complex palette-switching animation effects, enabling stunning graphics to be created. The graphics commands implemented are very much the same as the old BBC Micro coupled with Acorn graphics extension commands in fact similar to those found in the Master, Acorn forward planning has ensured that most of the commands have unused parts that are now fleshed out. These include predefined shapes, patterning and rapid flood fill effects. Coupled with the speed of the Rise chip, these allow effects created using Basic that were previously only possible with convoluted machine code. The very high resolution modes 18* 19 and 20 will require a special multi-sync monitor. The reason for this is that the normal TV standard can't cope with so many horizontal lines. SOUND THE sound system is quite complex. It can do far more than just mimic the equivalent commands on the BBC Micro, and brings new heights of sophistication to built-in computer sound systems. There can be up to eight channels assigned to the system and each can be located within a stereo position. The values controlling this range from 1, fully left through 128, centre stage, to 255 fully right. There is a built-in loudspeaker and a rear jack socket for connection to an external speaker or hi-fi system. The volume can be controlled logarithmically or linearly. The sound can be derived from waveform look-up tables making it pos¬ sible to simulate a wide variety of musical and not-so-musical sounds. These are disc based and loaded into memory when required. This means you are not stuck with the sounds that were developed before the Archimedes was launched. There should be a steadily growing library of instru¬ mental and other sounds available and also programs that allow you to develop your own. In addition, speech and real sampled sound can be produced, Imagine a game where the jet fighters roaring towards you sound just like the real thing. Most of the handling of the sound out¬ puts is performed by direct memory access from the peripheral chips* so the amount of processing time that sound generation demands is normally quite low. This will allow complex sounds to be generated while the processor is getting on with something else. There is even a tuning control on the output to enable the Archimedes to be tuned to the same pitch as real instru¬ ments. The sound buffers can be anything from 16 bytes to 4k and the sample rate from ljis to 32^s per channel. As there can be up to eight channels this will give an overall sample rate of between 125kHz to 4kHz. This allows you to go from basic telephone quality to very good quality indeed. Dual control keys The keyboard layout showing some of the new keys 18 MICRO USER August 1987 the Keyboard, putting a letter on the screen and so on, Because of the amazing capabilities of the Archimedes, each one of these apparently simple operations can in fact be tremendously complex. You. as the user, wil l never see all the details of how pressing the letter X at the Keyboard produces a highly ornate X one inch high on the screen All the standard BBC Micro entries into the operating system, for instance oswrch or os file r have been preserved and operate exactly as before.The VDU commands 0-31 are basically unchan ged - but some have been extended to taKe into account the power of the new machine. VDU 17 (COLOUR) and VDU18 (GCOL) now allow 256 colours and colour tints. VDU23 has all the facilities introduced in the Master plus other Archimedes special effects: for example VDU23 t 17,5 I swaps the foreground and bacKground colours, giving the inverse video effect The Command Line Interpreter, the part of the operating system which deals with star commands, has undergone the most dramatic changes. In the BBC Micro all the CLI does is recognise (or not) a command and pass it round the rams and filing systems to see if it is a valid command. The Arthur CLI performs the same function on a superficial level — but there is much more to it. Output from the command {for example the list of files from *CAT) can be re-directed to a text Turn to Page 20 Co-processor podufes: While all Other podules use a 64-way direct connector, this one uses a 96-way connector, to allow full access to the 32-bit data bus. It is designed to be used by processors that will share the worKload of the Rise chip. Note the same term was used to describe the second processors on the Master but here it is quite different. It could be used by a floating point co-processor to speed up arithmetic operations or by other Rise chips. As Number lock key Scroll V \\ Colour monitor Monochrome monitor Serial port Printer Eccnet Mains in Mains socket Headphone Rise chips are designed to worK together it is possible in the future to develop multiprocessor machines with this podule. Normally only one podule slot will be able to have a co-processor con¬ nected to it. External podules: These are fitted outside the main machine and can have up to 32K of address space devoted to them, allowing you to have circuits that are physically too large to be fitted internally into the Archimedes, All podules must identify themselves to the computer by a series of machine readable locations. This will normally be implemented in a small fuse link prom. Acorn expects podule manufacturers to register with them to obtain a unique manufacturer's identification number to be placed in this space. Undoubtedly there wii! be people who will not play by these rules, but those who do can expect to have no trouble with podule compat¬ ibility. WIMPS ARCHIMEDES contains a complete WIMP management system in the Arthur Operating System, The computer is so fast that the whole desktop environment on the Welcome disc is written in Basic using the Window Manager, Using the facilities you can create windows and icons, move the windows around, rescale them and remove them, A window can lie over or under any other. Mouse access is just as simple, and you can define up to four different poin¬ ters (a simple pointer, a busy-bee symbol or anything else). You can also change the size of the pointer at will. The whole system is very flexible and every serious software producer or user should make use of it. ARTHUR THE Arthur Operating System consists mainly of passive routines called by user programs to perform the many oper¬ ations such as reading the next Key from PODULES A PODULE is a plug-in card allowing all sorts of additional items to be connec¬ ted to Archimedes. Any interfacing circuits can be built on these Eurocard size boards and slotted into the com¬ puter. Each podule has its own small panel so the line of the computer is not spoiled* reducing risk of developing \"spaghetti\" hardware with all sorts of modules and wires being connected. Some versions of the Archimedes will have space for two podules and others room for four, in fact the software can support more than this so don't be surprised to see podule extension boards on the market before very long. There are basically four types of podule that can be used: Simple podules: These will provide simple input/output to the Archimedes and use a separate 16-bit I/O data bus controlled by the I/O controller chip. Perhaps the most important will be the one that emulates the user port, 1MHz bus and analogue input port of the BBC Micro, Others will be for connecting things like a teletext adapter, modem or video digitiser. IWernc podules: These can occupy up to 8k of address space and can be accessed much faster than the simple podules. They are intended for interfaces using larger memory maps, a prime example being a sideways rom podule. Many sideways roms can be installed on the same podule which would occupy pages in the BBC Micro, ► The back of the main unit showing the sockets August 1987 MICRO USER 19 Conventional New The diagram above left shows how a character is displayed on screen by a conventional micro. However, the Archimedes uses a technique called anti-aliasing to smooth out the rough edges by assigning shades of grey to adjacent pixels (see the diagram above right). The increased readability of the fonts means that you can get up to 132 characters a line - a boon for word processing. Additionally, there are two types of fonts which can be defined: A simple font (defined on an eight by eight grid! and a large font, which can be any siie. H shouldn’t be long before software houses like AMS develop a host of new fonts for you to use. *4 From Page 19 file and if a command requires input then it can be taken from file. You can have string and number variables and there is a *IF statement. The following example produces a catalogue: * SET FRED “HELLO\" *IF FRED='HELLO' THEN CAT New osword commands are available to control such things as the mouse and the screen base address, The standard filing system provided is the ADFS with many enhancements. Since the Archimedes has a built-in 3.Sin drive, discs can be swapped directly from the Compact, or any other BBC Micro (or Electron) using 3.Sin drive and ADFS. The packaged interrupt handling in the form of events is still available. In fact only event 3, analogue conversion complete, is not available. There are no joysticks because you have the mouse instead. There is no sideways ram facility, but this is not necessary when you have a potential of 64Mb. Even with 0.5Mb in the basic model you have twice the memory available in a fully expanded BBC Micro (16 sideways roms of 16k each, plus the other 48k). However you add your own software modules, which are equivalent to the sideways rams, so language and service software can be added to your machine dynamically. BASIC V TO describe the new version of BSC Basic and its programming environment as boring is not an insult - it's a compli¬ ment to the skill of the writers in keeping to their specification. Because so much in the Archimedes is improved and different, the Basic had to stay the same so people would feel at home. Rest assured that typing a pro¬ gram into the Archimedes looks and feels the same as using a BBC Micro, But when you get down to the new commands provided, Basic V is anything but boring. Table II provides a list of most of the new ones. But of course complete upward compatibility is provided. If you have written a program in BBC Basic that only uses standard commands, including operating system commands like osword , then that program will run. with no modifications required. If you have it stored on 3.Sin ADFS disc you can plug in and just chain it. The two commands INSTALL and LIBRARY allow you to load procedure and function libraries into memory and access them from the program without having to write them afresh each time. There is also an APPEND command if you want to combine two programs. In the area of mathematics you can now do matrix calculations in one command, pass arrays into procedures and functions and dimension local arrays. Also both value and variable par¬ ameters can be passed into procedures, Something not mentioned in the User Guide is the fact that Basic V has an assembler for the ARM (Acorn Rise Machine). So watch The Micro User for a full rundown on programming in ARM code. We hope we've succeeded in con¬ veying our excitement about this very worthy successor to the BBC Micro , The Archimedes's incredible speed and its breathtaking hi res graphics and sound - coupled with the high degree of compatibility with the BBC Micro — puts ail its competitors to shame . # Watch out next month for more in-depth revelations about this masterpiece of British engineering* Control Statements Emir Trapping and Debugging IF <condi tion* THEM ON ERROR LOCAL <multi-line statements* LOCAL ERROR ELSE RESTORE ERROR ciulti-line statements* ERROR <number>,<stnng> ENDIF REPORTS (pseudo variable) WHILE condition* TRACE STEP dulti-tine statements* TRACE PROC ENQIfHILE CASE expression* OF Sound WHEN <list of expressions* : <statements> SOUND ON/OFF <Uts of WHEN statements* VOICES OTHERWISE statements* STEREO ENDCASE BEAT BEATS Gravies TEMPO HOVE E0T3 x,y DRAW EBT] x,y POINT C0Y3 x,y Mferellaneabis FILL x,yLINE x},y1,x2,y2 List variables LVAR RECTANGLE [FILL] coordinates* Assign to part of LEFT$C) = , «1D$0 = CIRCLE [FILL] coordinates* strings and RIGHTSO- ELLIPSE tFILLI <coorrfinates* Get Line from file =GET$# ORIGIN Exchange variables SWAP WAIT TotaL array element! = SUM MOLISE ON/OFF Shift numbers Left «< MOUSE TO and right »> MOUSE STEP Find size of array mn MOUSE RECTANGLE Find current mode -MODE MOUSE COLOUR Call system routine STS Table It: Some new Basic V instructions 20 MICRO USER Aoqusl 1S87 Win a BBC Archimedes HERE’S your invitation to join The Micro User’s search for the most innovative use for a BBC Micro and win the most talked about computer of the moment - the superb new BBC Archimedes plus colour monitor.

GAME B B+| M c® SURVIVE! is a game which achieves that elusive quality of keeping you playing for hours with the promise of just one last go. SURVIVE... The object is to keep moving longer than your opponent without hitting anything. You can play against another player or the computer. No, it isn't a new theme but this version's appeal lies in the computer's playing algorithm, which provides a worthy opponent. You may find it unbeatable at the higher skill levels. The players are represented by X and 0 and they move round the Mode 7 screen leaving a coloured trail which must be avoided to survive. It is vital to avoid the border but with practice it is possible for the two trails to cross provided that the X and 0 are coincident on crossing, Jn one player mode the computer always plays 0, One machine code routine is used when playing the computer to allow smooth movement while the computer decides where to go next. You’ll have hours of fun with this superb game which can be saved directly to disc and it will run on all versions of the BBC Micro, if you can!
