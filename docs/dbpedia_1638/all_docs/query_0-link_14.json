        "text": "The waves of Covid-19 in the US\n\nThe Global Science and Politics of Covid-19 / SARS-CoV-2\n\nA Self-induced Malthusian Catastrophe -- 20-11-22 -- Chris King - Emeritus, University of Auckland\n\nTo generate a lived-linked stand-alone PDF, print and save from Google Chrome\n\nThe PDF hub forms a complete stand-alone clone of the web research hub, which can be freely emailed and updated by clicking the link above from the downloaded copy.\n\nThis article provides a detailed real-time global research overview of the Covid-19 pandemic in its medical, social, economic and ecological aspects, including epidemic modelling, infection mechanisms, death rates, antiviral, antibody and vaccine treatments and the way in which humanity, despite clear prior warnings in other zoonotic corona virus outbreaks, allowed itself to get into this situation, through our impact on the biosphere and expores the lessons to be learned for humanity's future surviva.\n\nThe data is clear: long Covid is devastating people's lives and livelihoodsl Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus WHO\n\nAcute and postacute sequelae associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection Nature Medicine 10-11-2022 Compared to no reinfection, reinfection contributed additional risks of death (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.17, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.93â2.45), hospitalization (HR = 3.32, 95% CI 3.13â3.51) and sequelae including pulmonary, cardiovascular, hematological, diabetes, gastrointestinal, kidney, mental health, musculoskeletal and neurological disorders.\n\nNavigation\n\nA: Origins in Sustained Human Misadventure\n\nB: First Awareness\n\nC: Uravelling the Viral Transmission Event\n\nD: Environmental and Economic Consequences\n\nE: Modeling Pandemic Strategies\n\nF: Genetic and Evolutionary Analysis\n\nG: World Incidence Statistics\n\nH: Coronavirus Tests and Tracing\n\nI: Mechanisms of Infection\n\nJ: Viral Loads & Asymptomatic Spread\n\nK: Antibody Responses and Reinfection\n\nL: Clinical Features\n\nM: Blood Clotting and Nervous System\n\nN: Lung Damage\n\nW:The Bradykinin Hypothesis\n\nO: Antiviral Drugs\n\nP: Antibody Treatments\n\nQ: Vaccines and Gene Therapies\n\nR: Mortality Rates\n\nS: Comparison with other Pandemics\n\nT: The New Zealand Situation\n\nU: World Comparisons\n\nV: Covid Politics\n\nIntroduction: Don't destabilize the Symbiosis!\n\nThe key to the Covid-19 pandemic is that bats and corona viruses have evolved into a semi-symbiotic relationship in which the bats harbour the coronas and ensure their survival by a \"super-immune\" response using interferon mediated anti-viral modulation, but inhibiting inflammasomes, which precipitate the cytokine storms resuling in human casualties. Bats, instead of expresing inflammatory cytokines, generate a targeted set of antiviral factors which tune down the virus. Simultaneously, the virus also adapts to the bat host cells, while rapidly mutating specific genes. Consequently bat coronaviruses can persist in their natural bat host for at least four months of hibernation without harming the bat, as discovered in the case of MERS. When a bat experiences stress to their immune system, it disrupts this immune system-virus symbiosis and allows the virus to multiply. Wet markets and habitat destruction combine to stress the bats in cages in close proximity to other species which also carry other strains of corona virus, leading to zoonotic recombination and a new toxic chimera not yet adapted to any host, but potentially both highly infectious and lethal because its highly evolved nature may bind very strongly to certain receptors in the bat or intermediate host. So its not that there is a vicious RNA virus at work alone, but the exploitative stressing of wild ecosystems disrupting symbiotic relationships on which the corona depends. This is the invidious work of humanity bringing about our own misfortune, hence it is a classic Malthusian grim reaper.\n\nSars-CoV-2 is clearly an extremely infectious epidemic disease. It binds strongly to ACE-2 receptors in the alveoli where oxygen transfer occurs and where it can cause debilitating pneumonia leading to loss of oxygen absorption and blood-borne viremia through the presence of ACE-2 blood-pressure receptors lining all blood vessels. It also binds sufficiently in the upper respiratory tract to be easily transmissable. A model of exactly why this is and why it can be very severe goes something like this:\n\nPhase 1: Humans are currently not resistant to the virus so it replicates exponentially without restraint for around a four to five day incubation period (Lauer et a 2020, Li et al 2020) with an exponentially increasing viral load. The virus is also stable for long periods on external surfaces leading to indirect transfer. This means that a person may become extremely infectious just as they begin to show symptoms and can infect a large number of people around them as a transient super-spreader, leading to large clusters being generated at social gatherings.\n\nPhase 2: Once the immune system kicks in, the infectivity naturally diminishes, as the viruses are attacked and destroyed. However in some, particularly older, people a deterioration may set in, in the second week, where they get obstructed lungs and an inflammtory cytokine storm. It is likely this is because the bat-adapted virus inhibits the interferon response and inflammatory responses promote viral ploliferation. In 'wet lung', the tissues around the alveoli leak plasma into the lungs which fill with fluid and the virus can pass into the blood stream, resulting in viremia. At this point the virus can attack the kidneys, brain, heart and/or liver which also have ACE-2 blood pressure receptors and infectivity is likely to increase again, causing risk to medical personnel. These two phases of infectivity could select for differing evolutionary processes, the first towards less aggressive and the second to more aggressive strains.\n\nReactions both by the immune systems of infected people and the virus itself can lead to an unparalleled variety of outcomes. The key to asymptomatic spreading is that the corona virus, as noted aove, is an implicitly symbiotic virus (1, 2 and 3) that has got knocked off its perch to become a pandemic infection. Thus some people have no symptoms at all, but others end up getting killed in large numbers when the virus remains active and the immune mismatich runs riot.\n\nAsymptomatic cases may arise either because of existing immunity due to other human corona viruses, or due to the initial interferon reaction curbing the viral explosion as occurs in bats. Immunity-mediated resistance is also a combination of humoral antibody-based immunity in which helper T-cells prime B-cells to produce antibodies, and direct cytotoxic responses from killer T-cells. Currently there are indications of a waning and highly variable humoral antibody response, depending on the severity of the infection, with direct killer T-cell activity showing high specificity for the virus. Cases of people catching two different forms of Covid-19 have also emerged. There is evidence of formation of memory cells in people who have had moderate infection severity, pointing to longer term immunity, but not in those who have died. In the most severe cases there is evidence for a misregulated immune response leading to cytokine storms and organ failure accompanied by inflammosomes.\n\nSix months of coronavirus: the mysteries scientists are still racing to solve Nature 3-7-2020 Genetic differences in victims. How long does immunity last? Worrying mutations? Vaccine prospects. Origin fo the virus?\n\nProfile of a killer: the complex biology powering the coronavirus pandemic Nature 4-5-2020 With 30,000 genetic bases, coronaviruses have the largest genomes of all RNA viruses. Their genomes are more than three times as big as those of HIV and hepatitis C, and more than twice influenza's. Coronaviruses are also one of the few RNA viruses with a genomic proofreading mechanism â which keeps the virus from accumulating mutations that could weaken it. That ability explains why common antivirals such as ribavirin, have failed to work on SARS-CoV-2, because the proofreader can weed out the mutations caused by these drugs. Coronaviruses also frequently recombine, swapping chunks of their RNA with other coronaviruses, giving them deadly variability.. Recombination happens often in bats and bat cells infected by viruses rapidly release a signal that may make them able to host the virus without killing it. The fact that both mutations and recombinations are at work complicates efforts to draw a family tree. Estimates for the birth of the first coronavirus vary widely, from 10,000 years ago to 300 million years ago. Evolutionary studies suggest that a SARS-CoV-2 related lineage has existed in an animal host for decades. The SARS-CoV-2 binding domain is particularly efficient, and differs in important ways from that of the Yunnan bat virus, which seems not to infect people, although they are 96% similar. The pangolin has been found to harbour a coronavirus with a receptor-binding domain almost identical to the human version, but is overall only 90% similar.\n\nSARS-CoV-2, like human CoVs, can attack the upper airways, or like SARS the lungs â both very efficiently. This gives it two ways to get a foothold. Once it gets into the lungs, it appears to be just as deadly as SARS. SARS-CoV-2 is uniquely equipped for forcing entry into cells. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind with ACE2, but the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 is a particularly snug fit. ACE2 is expressed throughout the body on the lining of the arteries and veins that course through all organs, but it is particularly dense on the cells lining the alveoli and small intestines. A SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger an excessive a cytokine storm, which can lead to multiple organ failure and death. The virus can also infect the intestines, the heart, the blood, sperm, the eye and possibly the brain. It is 10â20 times more likely to bind ACE2 than is SARS-CoV. Although the exact mechanisms remain unknown, evidence suggests that after the virus attaches itself, the host cell snips the spike protein at one of its dedicated 'cleavage sites', exposing fusion peptides â small chains of amino acids that help to pry open the host cell's membrane so that the virus's membrane can merge with it. SARS-COV-2 like several lethal viruses, but not SARS, seems to make use of the enzyme furin from the host to cleave the viral spike protein. This is worrying, because furin is abundant in the respiratory tract and found throughout the body. It gives SARS-CoV-2 a 100â1,000 times greater chance than SARS-CoV of getting deep into the lungs. This particular set-up has never been found in any other coronavirus in any species.\n\nNavigation\n\nA: Origins in Sustained Human Misadventure\n\nB: First Awareness\n\nC: Uravelling the Viral Transmission Event\n\nD: Environmental and Economic Consequences\n\nE: Modeling Pandemic Strategies\n\nF: Genetic and Evolutionary Analysis\n\nG: World Incidence Statistics\n\nH: Coronavirus Tests and Tracing\n\nI: Mechanisms of Infection\n\nJ: Viral Loads & Asymptomatic Spread\n\nK: Antibody Responses and Reinfection\n\nL: Clinical Features\n\nM: Blood Clotting and Nervous System\n\nN: Lung Damage\n\nW:The Bradykinin Hypothesis\n\nO: Antiviral Drugs\n\nP: Antibody Treatments\n\nQ: Vaccines and Gene Therapies\n\nR: Mortality Rates\n\nS: Comparison with other Pandemics\n\nT: The New Zealand Situation\n\nU: World Comparisons\n\nV: Covid Politics\n\nA: Origins in Sustained Human Misadventure\n\nThe corona virus pandemic is a classic case of Malthusian catastrophe, where a population fails to regulate its own reproduction to meet with its own natural environmental conditions and induces a mass mortality by epidemic plague famine, or violent conflict.\n\nFig 1: Racoon dogs are widely farmed in China, Bats in a market in Indonesia and a Pangolin, the world's 'most-trafficked' animal.\n\nRather than controlling our population and impact on the biosphere, humanity has continued on an ever exponentiating population curve, ever more completely impacting on wilderness habitats, driving species towards extinction and placing wildlife under stresses inconceivable in a natural environment. Increasing urbanization has concentrated huge populations in close proximity and human fluidity in global travel and mixing movement of supply chains and work mean the entire human population is an overlapping system at critical mass, completely vulnerable to a chain reaction of infection.\n\nIn addition, the proclavity for eating wild animals particularly in Asia, has resulted in global trafficing that puts unrelated species in close proximity, where a crate of trapped bats can drop huge viral loads on other species, such as bats to civets in SARS, bats to camels in MERS, and possibly in SARS-CoV-2 bats to pangolins, (or racoon dogs which are widely farmed in China), resulting in viral species transfer, giving rise to new viral genomes with newly lethal combinations of genes which would have never arisen without human misadventure. Bats form a reservoir. They have high corona virus loads because they congregate closely in huge colonies but have a high metabolic rate as a flying mammal and are not seriously affected.\n\nFig 2: SARS and MERS are both lethal zoonotic corona viruses. SARS was contained. MERS continues to circulate.\n\nCorona viruses are renowned for their zoonotic transfer and a corona virus pandemic has been at the forefront of international health concerns, but has gone unheeded, despite two clear warnings from previous zoonotic corona virus crises, that the pressure on wildlife could directly result in a human pandemic.\n\nThe first was from SARS in 2002 (29 countries 8096 cases mortality rate 9.6% -- 55% in those over 65) and then MERS in 2014 (26 countries 2606 cases mortality rate 34%). Both of these had horrific death rates from extreme forms of pneumonia and SARS, although contained proved highly infectious, killing many medical professionals who were called to treat victims, spreading from China as far as Canada. The MERS outbreak remains ongoing and no successful vaccine has so far been developed. Neither the combination of antivirals and interferons (ribavirin + interferon alfa-2a or interferon alfa-2b), nor corticosteroids improved outcomes.\n\nThe SARS outbreak can be genetically traced to a colony of cave-dwelling horseshoe bats in China's Yunnan province. The epidemic appears to have started in Guandong, China, in November 2002. Chinese government officials did not inform the World Health Organization of the outbreak until February 2003. The epidemic spread to multiple countries including a significant outbreak in Canada.Â In 2003, studies were conducted using samples of wild animals sold as food in the local market in Guangdong, China. SARS coronavirus could be isolated from masked palm civets, even if they did not show clinical signs. The conclusion was the SARS virus crossed the xenographic barrier from asian palm civet to humans, and more than 10,000 masked palm civets were killed in Guangdong Province. The virus was also later found in raccoon dogs, ferret badgers, and domestic cats. In 2005, two studies identified a number of SARS-like coronaviruses in Chinese bats. Fear of contracting the virus from consuming infected wild animals resulted in public bans and reduced business for meat markets in southern China and Hong Kong. The World Health Organization declared severe acute respiratory syndrome contained on 5 July 2003. In the following years, four SARS cases were reported in China. There were also three laboratory accidents that resulted in infection, in one of which, an ill lab worker spread the virus to several other people.\n\nA study performed between 2010 and 2013, in which the incidence of MERS was evaluated in 310 dromedary camels, revealed high titers of neutralizing antibodies to MERS-CoV in the blood serum of these animals. A further study sequenced MERS-CoV from nasalswabs of dromedary camels inSaudi Arabia and found they had sequences identical to previously sequenced human isolates. Some individual camels were also found to have more than one genomic variant in their nasopharynx.\n\nAll seven human corona virus infections, including SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2, which originate in bats, and the four human corona viruses causing colds also have zoonotic origins, with HKU1 and OC43 (hosts cattle) originating in mice, and NL63 and 229E (hosts camelids) in bats (see 9 below).\n\nIn the case of SARS-CoV-2 causing Covid-19, we have a Malthusian grim reaper that unless, contained worldwide, which is at face value highly improbable, could become a permanent feature of ongoing human epidemic disease. It combines two features, high infectivity even before symptoms arise and the ability in some 10% of cases to cause severe pneumonia ravaging the lungs, effectively acting as a human predator, killing off the elderly and vulnerable, rather than a parasite coexisting with its victims. It thus has both the features of demographic lethality and the capacity to produce continual epidemics without killing itself off by destroying its host or prey. Hence measures to eradicate it, rather than just suppress it, make long term health and economic sense, even if it may seem difficult or impossible.\n\nThe Covid-Climate Elucidation â Our Key to the Future â PDF\n\nCOVID-19 Make it the Last Pandemic 5-2021 The Independent Panel\n\nHow to Stop the Next Pandemic NYT 1-9-2020 It's not just Covid-19.

As a result, a steady stream of diseases can be expected to jump from animals to humans in coming years, they say. The number of suchÂ \"zoonotic\" epidemicsÂ is rising, from Ebola to Sars to West Nile virus and Rift Valley fever, with the root cause being the destruction of nature by humans and the growing demand for meat, the report says.\n\nPandemics result from destruction of nature, say UN and WHO Guardian 17-6-2020 Pandemics such as coronavirus are the result of humanity's destruction of nature, according to leaders at the UN, WHO and WWF International, and the world has been ignoring this stark reality for decades. The illegal and unsustainable wildlife trade as well as the devastation of forests and other wild places were still the driving forces behind the increasing number of diseases leaping from wildlife to humans, the leaders told the Guardian. They are calling for a green and healthy recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, in particular by reforming destructive farming and unsustainable diets.\n\n'We did it to ourselves': scientist says intrusion into nature led to pandemic 25-4-2020 Leading US biologist Thomas Lovejoy \"the Godfather of Biodiversity\" says to stop future outbreaks we need more respect for natural world. \"This pandemic is the consequence of our persistent and excessive intrusion in nature and the vast illegal wildlife trade, and in particular, the wildlife markets, the wet markets, of south Asia and bush meat markets of Africaâ¦ It's pretty obvious, it was just a matter of time before something like this was going to happen,\" said Lovejoy, a senior fellow at the United Nations Foundation and professor of environment science at George Mason University.\n\nGlobal shifts in mammalian population trends reveal key predictors of virus spillover risk Royal Society B 13-3-2020 species scales positively with global species abundance, suggesting that virus transmission risk has been highest from animal species that have increased in abundance and even expanded their range by adapting to human-dominated landscapes. Domesticated species, primates and bats were identified as having more zoonotic viruses than other species. Among threatened wildlife species, those with population reductions owing to exploitation and loss of habitat shared more viruses with humans.\n\n'Tip of the iceberg': is our destruction of nature responsible for Covid-19? Guardian / ENSIA 17-3-2020 As habitat and biodiversity loss increase globally, the novel coronavirus outbreak may be just the beginning of mass pandemics. A number of researchers today think that it is humanity's destruction of biodiversity that creates the conditions for new viruses and diseases like COVID-19, the viral disease that emerged in China in December 2019, to arise -- with profound health and economic impacts in rich and poor countries alike. \"We invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbor so many species of animals and plants -- and within those creatures, so many unknown viruses,\" David Quammen, author of Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Pandemic, recently wrote in the New York Times. \"We cut the trees; we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets.

Pneumonia was seen in sections on mink and SARS-CoV-2 was detected in organs and throat swabs. Based on the variations in the genetic codes of the virus, it could be concluded that mink farms have transmitted the virus to each other. It is also plausible that one of the employees has been infected by mink.

Repts. 2020 doi:10.1038/s41598-020-64264-1 When exposed to the MERS virus, bat cells adapt -- not by producing inflammation-causing proteins that are hallmarks of getting sick, but rather by maintaining a natural antiviral response, a function which shuts down in other species, including humans. Simultaneously, the MERS virus also adapts to the bat host cells by very rapidly mutating one specific gene. Operating together, these adaptations result in the virus remaining long-term in the bat but being rendered harmless until something -- such as disease or other stressors -- upsets this delicate equilibrium. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to operate in the same way. The mechanism shows how human stresses to the bat immune system including abusive practices inculding crowding different species in wet-markets can be directly responsible for a zoonotic transfer and a resulting human corona virus pandemic.\n\nHow China's 'Bat Woman' Hunted Down Viruses from SARS to the New Coronavirus Sci.

And their models showed it almost didn't make it as aÂ pandemic virus. Only bad luck and the packed conditions of theÂ Huanan seafood market in Wuhan -- the place the pandemic appears to have begun -- gave the virus the edge it needed to explode around the globe. The team employed molecular dating, using the rate of ongoing mutations to calculate how long the virus has been around. They also ran computer models to show when and how it could have spread, and how it did spread. To answer this question, they combined three important pieces of information: a detailed understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 spread in Wuhan before the lockdown, the genetic diversity of the virus in China and reports of the earliest cases of COVID-19 in China. By combining these disparate lines of evidence, they were able to put an upper limit of mid-October 2019 for when SARS-CoV-2 started circulating in Hubei province. The evidence strongly indicates the virus could not have been circulating before that.\n\nWHO Investigators to Scrap Plans for Interim Report on Probe of Covid-19 Origins WSJ 4-3 2021 U.S-China tensions rise over investigation as group of scientists presses for fresh inquiry, including into lab escape theory.

He hadn't travelled but did work at a supermarket close to one of the city's major airports where travellers often shopped. A swab taken at the time was looked at again and his COVID-19 infection confirmed. Doctors said that would have meant he was infected anytime from mid-December onwards.

Top unusual inserts of basic amino acids inconsistent with corresponding bat corona viruses. Lower left: Sars-Cov-2 still has no clear zoonotic origin, while the evolutionary descent of both Sars-Cov epidemics is clear. Lower right: Sars-Cov-2 appears pre-adapted to humans while Sars-Cov showed clear evolutionary adaption.\n\nC: Uravelling the Viral Transmission Event\n\nThe overriding feature of covid-19 is that rather than affecting the sinuses and upper airways as human corona viruses do, the zoonotic transfer has resulted in binding deep in the lungs, potentially destroying the alveoli esential for breathing and in the second week fulminating to the point of complete immunity crisis and organ or heart failure due to obstruction of the blood supply through the lungs.\n\nResearchers have found the RBD portion of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins have evolved to effectively target a molecular feature on the outside of human cells called ACE2 - a receptor involved in regulating blood pressure. It turned out to mostly resemble related viruses found in bats and pangolins - scaly-skinned mammals that are prized delicacies in China.\n\nThat led scientists to suspect one of two possible scenarios. In one scenario, the virus evolved to its current state through natural selection in an animal host and then jumped to humans, as happened with Sars-CoV and Mers-CoV. They proposed bats were the most likely reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, as it was very similar to a bat coronavirus. Yet there were no documented cases of direct bat-human transmission, suggesting that an intermediate host was likely involved between humans.\n\nIn this scenario, both of the distinctive features of SARS-CoV-2's spike protein - the RBD portion that binds to cells and the cleavage site that opens the virus up - would have evolved to their current state before entering humans. In this case, the current epidemic would probably have emerged rapidly as soon as humans were infected, as the virus would have already evolved the features that made it pathogenic, or able to spread between people. In the other proposed scenario, a non-pathogenic version of the virus jumped from an animal host into humans and then evolved to its current state within the human population. A coronavirus from a pangolin could possibly have been transmitted to a human, either directly or through an intermediary host such as civets or ferrets. After that, the other distinct spike protein characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 - the cleavage site - could have evolved within a human host, or possibly among a group of people, before the outbreak kicked off.\n\nWhile Sars-Cov-2 has 96% homology with the closest bat corona virus, the spike protein contains high homology with a pangolin corona virus spike protein.The broad scientific consensus remains that the virus emerged naturally due to zoonotic transfer from bats to humans via a second species, e.g. a pangolin or civet, and that there is no clear evidence of a lab origin, but two lines of genetic evidence below disagree with this. In May a paper (4) noted the highly evolved adaption to humans from the outset (see also 3). In June, a second paper (2) claiming furin-cleavage site inserts consistent with engineering are key components of the spike protein infectivity supported also by detailed structure of inserts, accompanied by media claims from an ex-head of UK MI6 (1) suggesting the virus was an (accidental) lab release. This claim needs careful comparison with the claim that the spike protein in a Malaysian pangolin is virtually identical to Sars-Cov-2, thus resulting from recombination of a bat corona virus in the pangolin see also the papers in fig 2b. A now somewhat notorious experiment in 2015 engineered a mouse-adapted Sars virus with bat spike proteins, co-authored by \"Bat Woman\" Shi Zhengli-Li Deputy Director of the Wuhan lab, as well as a US team, engineered a mouse-adapted Sars virus with bat spike proteins. Shi has sworn on her life that Cov-2 is not homologous to any of the viruses in her lab and the critical work seems to have all been done in the US.\n\nA Smoking Gun?

Two other papers found the viruses were 90.23% and 91.02% similar, respectively, to the virus that causes COVID-19. But these figures are not high enough. The SARS virus shared 99.8% of its genome with a civet coronavirus, which is why civets were considered the source.\n\n'Trump owes us an apology.'

One of them has the highest similarity, 96 percent to the SARS virus. But their highest similarity to SARS-CoV-2 only reaches 79.8 percent. The bat coronavirus which has a 96.2 percent genomic similarity to SARS-CoV-2 is called RaTG-13. But coronavirus have the largest genomes with 30000 bases. It would take about 50 years for RaTG-13 to naturally evolve to SARS-CoV-2, given 1100 base differences. Many people might misunderstand that since our institute reported the RaTG-13's genomic similarity to SARS-CoV-2, we must have the RaTG-13 virus in our lab. In fact, that's not the case. When we were sequencing the genes of this bat virus sample, we got the genome sequence of the RaTG-13 but we didn't isolate nor obtain the live virus of RaTG-13. Thus, there is no possibility of us leaking RaTG-13.\n\nChinese scientist claims Covid-19 started in 'military lab' after fleeing to US Stuff/Fox 11-7-2020\n\n'Heinous!': Coronavirus researcher shut down for Wuhan-lab link slams new funding restrictions Nature 21-8-2020\n\nNavigation\n\nA: Origins in Sustained Human Misadventure\n\nB: First Awareness\n\nC: Uravelling the Viral Transmission Event\n\nD: Environmental and Economic Consequences\n\nE: Modeling Pandemic Strategies\n\nF: Genetic and Evolutionary Analysis\n\nG: World Incidence Statistics\n\nH: Coronavirus Tests and Tracing\n\nI: Mechanisms of Infection\n\nJ: Viral Loads & Asymptomatic Spread\n\nK: Antibody Responses and Reinfection\n\nL: Clinical Features\n\nM: Blood Clotting and Nervous System\n\nN: Lung Damage\n\nW:The Bradykinin Hypothesis\n\nO: Antiviral Drugs\n\nP: Antibody Treatments\n\nQ: Vaccines and Gene Therapies\n\nR: Mortality Rates\n\nS: Comparison with other Pandemics\n\nT: The New Zealand Situation\n\nU: World Comparisons\n\nV: Covid Politics\n\nFig 4: Pollution reduction: A Scintillating day in LA 12 Apr, NO2 reduction in China, Himalayas visible for the first time in decades in Indian Jalandhar (Punjab) .\n\nD: Environmental Cultural and Economic Consequences\n\nThe world shutdown has alleviated both CO2 and NO2 emssions and cleared pollution over much of Asia and Europe, but lessons need to be learned that the covid crisis is as much a product of human impact denial as is the failure to deal with biodiversity and climate crisis. Wild animals are taking advantage of the reduced human presence, entering cities and lying on roadways, while there has been a collapse in the price of oil and wild swings in the financial markets, with mass unemployment and huge financial subsidies during lockdowns affecting up to half the world's population. The fact that a viral mutation can threaten to decimate the world's population and the planet's 'economic engine' can grind to a standstill through lack of foresight for obvious risks already clear from SARS and MERS, and the way the world economy depends on ongoing activity to avoid collapse due to debt crisis, all indicates a complete lack of long-term resilience in business-as-usual attitudes of short-term venture capitalism, unmoderated by any effective long-term view of human sustainability. While we are clearly failing to address the more gradual crises of climate change, habitat destruction and loss of biological diversity, one has to hope that the fact this crisis has brought the world to a standstill will teach us that long-term survival depends on getting our own house in order and preserving our increasingly fragile biosphere before we bring about a more apocalyptic scenario with no exit strategy.\n\nCoronavirus could cause fall in global CO2 emissions\n\nLockdowns trigger dramatic fall in global carbon emissions Guardian 19-5-2020\n\nHow the coronavirus pandemic slashed carbon emissions â in five graphs Nature 20-5-2020\n\nIndia's carbon emissions fall for first time in four decades BBC 12-5-2020\n\nCoronavirus pandemic leading to huge drop in air pollution\n\nClimate vs coronavirus: Why massive stimulus plans could represent missed opportunities Nature 3-3-2020\n\nTen EU countries urge bloc to pursue 'green' coronavirus recovery Reuters 10-4-2020\n\nCoronavirus forces postponement of COP26 meeting in Glasgow BBC 1-4-2020\n\nWhat Coronavirus Could Mean for the Global Economy Harvard Business Review 3-3-2020\n\nCoronavirus: who will be winners and losers in new world order?

For the first time in his life, he was guilty of understatement. In reality, he has directly contributed to the deaths of more than 200,000 people and paid barely any political price with base support still around 42% of the electorate.\n\nE: Modeling Pandemic Strategies\n\nSARS was a very lethal and highly infectious disease whose lethality motivated a strong response to contain it and the epidemic died out after several months. Sars-Cov-2 has even greater infectivity because asymptomatic or incipiently symptomatic people may be at the exponential peak of infectivity and so can transmit to many more people than Sars-Cov where a high proportion of those effected became stricken with severe pneumonia. This can lead to a doubling inthe number infected people every a 2-5 days. Therefore in the absence of an effective vaccination or a magic bullet, both physical distancing and very high rates of testing and isolation of positives are necessary to avoid an ongoing world threat to human health, which could otherwise decimate the population over 60.\n\nPandemics are measured by the reproduction coefficient R0 â how many people an aveage person infects and the serial interval I â how long the virus takes to become infectious. The current estimates of R0 = 5.7 and a serial interval of I = 6 days, gives a doubling time of 6*log(2)/log(5.7) = 2.39 days, very close to the trajectories in fig 9. However, there is another factor, the dispersion factor k , the proportion of people that are superspreaders, causing clusters if they are in a gathering of people. Sars-Cov-2 appears to have a k around 0.1, meaning 9/10 people will infect hardly anyone but 1/10 will be super infectious, particularly in an indoor space with enclosed air or circulating air conditioning, with some large clusters indicating airborne rather than droplet-borne spread (see article ).\n\nThe first few articles below show both that social distancing and lockdowns prevented a catastrophic epidemic and that levels of immunity remain well below herd immunity levels.\n\nFig 5b: Left: Posterior model estimates of percentage of total population infected as of 28th March 2020\n\nRight: Effects on the modelled R0 from partial and complete lockdown (Germany).\n\nCovid-19 antibodies detected in 67% of India's population Guardian 21-7-2021 The figure compares with 24% in January\n\nFive reasons why COVID herd immunity is probably impossible Nature 18-3-2021\n\nUnderdetection of cases of COVID-19 in France threatens epidemic control Nature 21-12-2020 Our findings indicate that around 90,000 incident symptomatic infections, corresponding to 9 out 10 cases, were not ascertained by the surveillance system in the first 7 weeks following lockdown from May 11 to June 28 2020, although the test positivity rate did not exceed WHO recommendations (5%).\n\nHow the pandemic might play out in 2021 and beyond Nature 5-8-2020\n\nCOVID-19 herd immunity in the Brazilian Amazon medRxiv 21-9-2020 From the proportion of donors who tested positive for antibodies, the authors estimate that about 66% of the population had been infected by early August â months after the epidemic in Manaus peaked in May.\n\nWould herd immunity stop the spread of coronavirus?

Scientists also point out that Manaus in Brazil suffered a devastating wave of Covid-19 cases that killed more than 3,000 people earlier this year. Then virus levels subsided and claims were made that the city had achieved herd immunity. However, cases have now started to surge again in Manaus, suggesting the city failed to achieve herd immunity despite its high death toll.\n\nThe effect of temperature on persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on common surfaces Virol J. 7-10-2020 With initial viral loads broadly equivalent to the highest titres excreted by infectious patients, viable virus was isolated for up to 28 days at 20Â°C from common surfaces such as glass, stainless steel and both paper and polymer banknotes. Conversely, infectious virus survived less than 24 h at 40Â°C on some surfaces.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in the Boston area highlights the role of recurrent importation and superspreading events medRxiv 25-8-2020 We studied two superspreading events covered by the data, events that led to very different outcomes because of the timing and populations involved. One produced rapid spread in a vulnerable population but little onward transmission, while the other was a major contributor to sustained community transmission, including outbreaks in homeless populations, and was exported to several other domestic and international sites. One superspreading event at Biogen may be connected to about 20,000 Covid-19 cases in the Boston area, a researcher said on Tuesday.\n\nNew research finds it could take a month for Covid-19 patients to clear the virus CNN 1-9-2020\n\n70 of 92 coronavirus cases in Massachusetts linked to Biogen employees after biotech firm's Boston meeting CNN 11-3-2020\n\nFour months into the COVID-19 pandemic, Sweden's prized herd immunity is nowhere in sight Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 2020\n\nSocial and behavioral consequences of mask policies during the COVID-19 pandemic PNAS 22-7-2020 Serial crosssectional data (April 14 to May 26, 2020) from nearly 7,000 German participants demonstrate that implementing a mandatory policy increased actual compliance despite moderate acceptance; mask wearing correlated positively with other protective behaviors. A preregistered experiment (n = 925) further indicates that a voluntary policy would likely lead to insufficient compliance, would be perceived as less fair, and could intensify stigmatization. A mandatory policy appears to be an effective, fair, and socially responsible solution to curb transmissions of airborne viruses.\n\nPediatric SARS-CoV-2: Clinical Presentation, Infectivity, and Immune Responses J Pediatr. 29-7-2020 This study reveals that children may be a potential source of contagion in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in spite of milder disease or lack of symptoms, and immune dysregulation is implicated in severe post-infectious MIS-C.\n\nAge-Related Differences in Nasopharyngeal Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Levels in Patients With Mild to Moderate Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) JAMA Pediatr. 30-7-2020 Here, we report that replication of SARS-CoV-2 in older children leads to similar levels of viral nucleic acid as adults, but significantly greater amounts of viral nucleic acid are detected in children younger than 5 years.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 Transmission and Infection Among Attendees of an Overnight Camp â Georgia, June 2020 CDC 31-7-2020 After a teenage staff member developed symptoms, subsequent testing showed 344 attendees, 260 were found to be positive. Contrary to earlier theories about the spread of the disease in children â younger children, as well as those who spent longer at the camp, appeared more likely to be infected. This suggests children â even asymptomatic cases â may play an important role in community transmission of Covid-19 affecting others.\n\nNew IHME COVID-19 Forecasts See Nearly 300,000 Deaths by December 1, However, Consistent Mask-Wearing Could Save about 70,000 Lives 7-8-2020 The US forecast totals 295,011 deaths by December.\n\nVariation in government responses to COVID-19 Oxford Univ. 5-2020 Calculation and presentation of the Government Stringency Index 4.0\n\nIt is Time to Address Airborne Transmission of COVID-19 Clin. Infect. Dis.6-6-2020 Somne 239 scientists in 32 countries outlined evidence that they say shows floating virus particles can infect people who breathe them in. Because those smaller exhaled particles can linger in the air, the scientists in the group had been urging WHO to update its guidance. Historically, there has been a fierce opposition in the medical profession to the notion of aerosol transmission, and the bar for proof has been set very high. A key concern has been a fear of panic.\n\nReconstruction of the full transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan Nature 16-7-2020 Accounting for presymptomatic infectiousness,time-varying ascertainment rates, transmission rates and population movements, we identify two key features of the outbreak: high covertness and high transmissibility.\n\nWe estimate 87% (lower bound 53%) of the infections before March 8 were unascertained, potentially including asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases; and a basic reproduction number R0 of 3.54 in the early outbreak, much higher than for SARS and MERS. We observe that multi-pronged interventions had considerable positive efects on controlling the outbreak, decreasing the reproduction number to 0.28 and by projection reducing the total infections in Wuhan by 96.0% as of March 8. We furthermore explore the probability of resurgence following lifting of all interventions after 14 days of no ascertained infections, estimating it at 0.32 and 0.06 based on models with 87% and 53% unascertained infections, respectively, highlighting the risk posed by unascertained cases in changing intervention strategies.\n\n'Superspreading' events, triggered by people who may not even know they are infected, propel coronavirus pandemic Wash. Post 19-7-2020\n\nEstimating the establishment of local transmission and the cryptic phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA medRxiv 7-7-2020 Modeling results indicate international travel as the key driver of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in the West and East Coast metropolitan areas that could have been seeded as early as late-December, 2019. For most of the continental states the largest contribution of imported infections arrived through domestic travel flows.\n\nPrevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain (ENE-COVID): a nationwide, population-based seroepidemiological study Lancet 6-7-2020 Only 3-10% of the Spanish population is seropositive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in hotspot areas. Most PCR-confirmed cases have detectable antibodies, but a substantial proportion of people with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 did not have a PCR test and at least a third of infections determined by serology were asymptomatic.\n\nSeroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in Geneva, Switzerland (SEROCoV-POP): a population-based study Lancet 11-6-2020 These results suggest that most of the population of Geneva remained uninfected during this wave of the pandemic, despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 in the region (5000 reported clinical cases over <2Â·5 months in the population of half a million people). Assuming that the presence of IgG antibodies is associated with immunity, these results highlight that the epidemic is far from coming to an end by means of fewer susceptible people in the population. Further, a significantly lower seroprevalence was observed for children aged 5â9 years and adults older than 65 years, compared with those aged 10â64 years.\n\nThe effect of large-scale anti-contagion policies on the COVID-19 pandemic Nature 8-6-2020 We estimate that early infections of COVID-19 exhibit exponential growth rates of roughly 38% per day. We find that anti-contagion policies have significantly and substantially slowed this growth. We estimate that across six countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 62 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting roughly 530 million total infections.\n\nEstimating the number of infections and the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 in 11 European countries Imperial College 30-3-2020 Nature 8-6-2020 We estimate that there have been many more infections than are currently reported. The high level of under-ascertainment of infections that we estimate here is likely due to the focus on testing in hospital settings rather than in the community. Despite this, only a small minority of individuals in each country have been infected, with an attack rate on average of 4.9% [1.9%-11%] with considerable variation between countries (Fig 5b). Our estimates imply that the populations in Europe are not close to herd immunity (~50-75% if R0 is 2-4). Further, with Rt values dropping substantially, the rate of acquisition of herd immunity will slow down rapidly. This implies that the virus will be able to spread rapidly should interventions be lifted.\n\nIHME models show second wave of COVID-19 beginning September 15 in US A total of 169,890 deaths are forecast by October 1, now revised upward to 201,129.\n\nCOVID-19 case clusters offer lessons and warnings for reopening Sci.

The new coronavirus has jumped into the United Kingdom more than 1,300 times â mostly from France and Spain, despite early headlines focusing on infected travellers from China and other parts of Asia.\n\nReport 23: State-level tracking of COVID-19 in the United States Imperial College 21-5-2020 The estimates(fig 5) suggest that the epidemic is not under control in much of the US: As of 17 May 2020, the reproduction number is above the critical threshold (1.0) in 24 states. Higher reproduction numbers are geographically clustered in the South and Midwest, where epidemics are still developing, while we estimate lower reproduction numbers in states that have already suffered high COVID-19 mortality (such as the Northeast). These estimates suggest that caution must be taken in loosening current restrictions if effective additional measures are not put in place. We predict that increased mobility following relaxation of social distancing will lead to resurgence of transmission, keeping all else constant. We predict that deaths over the next two-month period could exceed current cumulativedeaths by greater than two-fold, if the relationship between mobility and transmission remains unchanged.\n\nUK lockdown a week earlier could have halved COVID-19 death toll, scientist says Reuters 10-6-2020 Britain has an official death toll from confirmed COVID-19 cases of over 40,000, rising to over 50,000 cases when deaths from suspected cases are included.\n\nThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe and the US bioRxiv 23-5-2020 Here, we elucidate when, where and how the earliest sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission networks became established in Europe and the United States (US). Our results refute prior findings erroneously linking cases in January 2020 with outbreaks that occurred weeks later. Instead, rapid interventions successfully prevented onward transmission of those early cases in Germany and Washington State. Other, later introductions of the virus from China to both Italy and Washington State founded the earliest sustained European and UStransmission networks. Our analyses reveal an extended period of missed opportunity when intensive testing and contact tracing could have prevented SARS-CoV-2 from becoming established in the US and Europe.\n\nProjecting the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 through the postpandemic period Science 14-4-2020 Prolonged or intermittent distancing may be necessary into 2022. Expanded critical care and an effective therapeutic would improve success. Longitudinal seriological studies are needed to determine the extent of immunity.

The researchers also found that just 9% of original cases were responsible for 80% of infections detected in close contacts. Such 'superspreading' events could lead to \"large COVID-19 clusters\".\n\nExpert report predicts up to two more years of pandemic misery CNN 30-4-2020 CIDRAP Report 30-4-2020 The new coronavirus is likely to keep spreading for at least another 18 months to two yearsâuntil 60% to 70% of the population has been infected, a team of longstanding pandemic experts predictedÂ in a reportÂ released Thursday.

This was because testing was restricted to people with symptoms and asymptomatic carriers were not tested, he said. \"We probably recognized about 10% of the outbreak by the methods that we use to diagnosis between the March, April and May.\" He said that between 5% and 8% of the population had been exposed to the virus meaning 92-95% are still vulnerable and urged Americans to keep social distancing, wearing masks and washing hands. The estimate was based on the 2.4m known cases in the US, multiplied by the average rate of antibodies seen from the serology tests, about an average of 10 to one.\n\nNew research explores how conservative media misinformation may have intensified the severity of the US pandemic Wash. Post 25-6-2020 The US response to the pandemic has faltered include four reasons (1) lack of a cohesive federal policy, (2) missteps onÂ testing and tracing, both contributed to by Donald Trump's mismanagement, (3) a national cultureÂ emphasising individualism, and (4) active misinformation from conservative media outlets. Four studies paint a picture of a conservative media ecosystem that amplifies misinformation, entertains conspiracy theories and discourages audiences from taking concrete steps to protect themselves and others:\n\n(a) A peer-reviewed APPC/Univ.Illinois studyÂ has found that people who got most of their information from mainstream print and broadcast outlets tended to have an accurate assessment of the severity of the pandemic and their risks of infection. But those who relied on conservative sources, such as Fox News and Rush Limbaugh, were more likely to believe in conspiracy theories or unfounded rumors, and that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention exaggerated the pandemic's threat \"to damage the Trump presidency.\"\n\n(b) AÂ paper posted by the National Bureau of Economic Research in May found that even when accounting for individual viewers differences, a 10% increase in Fox News viewership within a Zip code reduced its residents' propensity to stay home, in compliance with public health guidelines, by about 1.3 percentage points. Given total stay-at-home behavior increased by 20 percentage points during the study period, this is comparable to Fox's persuasive effect on voting behavior,Â as identified in another 2017 paper.\n\n(c) A third Univ. Chicago paper, similarly finds that Fox News viewers are less likely to comply with public health guidelines than consumers of other media. It finds that within Fox viewers, fans of some media personalities act distinctly from others and provides evidence that those behavioral differences are contributing to the spread of the coronavirus and mortality rate of covid-19.\n\n(d) A fourth paper from the Annenberg Public Policy Center attributes similar trends to social media including Twitter.\n\nWHO unsure antibodies protect against COVID, little sign of herd immunity Reuters 18-4-2020 \"A lot of preliminary information coming to us right now would suggest quite a low percentage of population have seroconverted (to produce antibodies).

Bur. Econ. Res. 23-6-2020 Event-study analyses provide strong evidence that net stay-at-home behavior increased following protest onset, consistent with the hypothesis that nonprotesters' behavior was substantially affected by urban protests. This effect was not fully explained by the imposition of city curfews. Estimated effects were generally larger for persistent protests and those accompanied by media reports of violence. Furthermore, we find no evidence that urban protests reignited COVID-19 case growth during the more than three weeks following protest onset. We conclude that predictions of broad negative public health consequences of Black Lives Matter protests were far too narrowly conceived.\n\nFirst-wave COVID-19 transmissibility and severity in China outside Hubei after control measures, and second-wave scenario planning: a modelling impact assessment Lancet 8-4-2020 \" Findings: In all selected cities and provinces, the Rt decreased substantially since Jan 23, when control measures were implemented, and have since remained below 1. The cCFR (confirmed case fatality risk) outside Hubei was 0Â·98%, which was almost five times lower than that in Hubei (5Â·91%). Relaxing the interventions (resulting in Rt>1) when the epidemic size was still small would increase the cumulative case count exponentially as a function of relaxation duration, even if aggressive interventions could subsequently push disease prevalence back to the baseline level. Interpretation: The first wave of COVID-19 outside of Hubei has abated because of aggressive non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, given the substantial risk of viral reintroduction, particularly from overseas importation, close monitoring of Rt and cCFR is needed to inform strategies against a potential second wave to achieve an optimal balance between health and economic protection.\" Lockdowns can't end until Covid-19 vaccine found, study says Guardian 9-4-2020\n\nHigh Contagiousness and Rapid Spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 CDC 7-4-2020 Assuming a serial interval of 6â9 days, we calculated a median R0Â value of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8â8.9).

But as many as 240,000 people are still predicted to die, even with shutdowns and stay-at-home orders.\n\nThe Global Impact of COVID-19 and Strategies for Mitigation and Suppression Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team 26-3-2020 Follow up confirming 40 million people could have died without a global response. The analysis says that introducing social distancing, testing and isolating infected people would cut worldwide deaths to 1.9 million, if carried out when a each country's fatality rate is 0.2 per 100,000 people per week. Implementing these measures only when the death rate reaches 1.6 per 100,000 people per week leads to 10.5 million lives lost globally, it finds. According toÂ Nature's analysis of death rates fromÂ Our World in DataÂ -- counting each day at the centre of a rolling weekly window of deaths -- Italy hit this threshold on 2-3 March, the United Kingdom on 17 March, and the United States on 22 March.\n\nThe effect of control strategies to reduce social mixing on outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China: a modelling study 25-3-2020 This paper suggests that if controls in Wuhan had been relaxed in early March, when case numbers dramatically dropped, the city would already be ramping up towards a fresh outbreak in June, placing constraints on any quick escape from containment.\n\nUsing ILI surveillance to estimate state-specific case detection rates and forecast SARS-CoV-2 spread in the United States medRxiv 3-4-2020 Here, we show how publicly available CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatient surveillance data can be repurposed to estimate the detection rate of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. We find a surge of non-influenza ILI above the seasonal average and show that this surge is correlated with COVID case counts across states. By quantifying the number of excess ILI patients in March relative to previous years and comparing excess ILI to confirmed COVID case counts, we estimate the symptomatic case detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the US to be 1/100 to 1/1000.\n\nEstimating the generation interval for COVID-19 based on symptom onset data MedRxiv 5-3-2020 The exponential growth of a pandemic depends on two parameters, the generation interval and the infectious reproduction rate R0. For example with covid-19 there is an average incubation time of around 4.7 days and an infection rate averaging around 2.5 to 1. Therefore the case numbers will be around 2-3 times as many in around 4-5 days, or perhaps a little faster as we have seen -- in an exponential runaway.\n\nThe Incubation Period of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) From Publicly Reported Confirmed Cases: Estimation and Application An.

We find that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they can reduce peak incidence by 40-60% and delay the epidemic.\n\nSuppression of COVID-19 outbreak in the municipality of Vo', Italy medRxiv 18-4-2020 We collected information for 85.9% and 71.5% of the population of Vo at two consecutive time points. On the first survey, which was conducted around the time the town lockdown started, we found a prevalence of infection of 2.6%. On the second survey, which was conducted at the end of the lockdown, we found a prevalence of 1.2%. Notably, 43.2% of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections detected across the two surveys were asymptomatic. The mean serial interval was 6.9 days. We found no statistically significant difference in the viral load of symptomatic versus asymptomatic infections. Contact tracing of the newly infected cases and transmission chain reconstruction revealed that most new infections in the second survey were infected in the community before the lockdown or from asymptomatic infections living in the same household.\n\nFundamental principles of epidemic spread highlight the immediate need for large-scale serological surveys to assess the stage of the SARS-COV-2 epidemic. MedRxiv 26-3-2020 We calibrate a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to data on cumulative reported SARS-CoV-2 associated deaths from the United Kingdom (UK) and Italy under the assumption that such deaths are well reported events that occur only in a vulnerable fraction of the population.\n\nThe airborne lifetime of small speech droplets and their potential importance in SARS-CoV-2 transmission PNAS 4-5-2020 Highly sensitive laser light scattering observations have revealed that loud speech can emit thousands of oral fluid droplets per second. In a closed, stagnant air environment, they disappear from the window of view with time constants in the range of 8 to 14 min, which corresponds to droplet nuclei of ca. 4 Î¼m diameter, or 12- to 21-Î¼m droplets prior to dehydration. These observations confirm that there is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments\n\nAirborne transmission of COVID-19: epidemiologic evidence from two outbreak investigations Res. GateÂ 4-2020 Airborne transmission of COVID-19: epidemiologic evidence from two outbreak investigations. In the first outbreak, 126 passengers took two buses (59 from Bus 1 and 67 from 2) on a 100-minute round trip to attend a 150-minute worship event. The source patient was a passenger on Bus 2. We compared risks of COVID-19 among individuals taking Bus 1 and Bus 2, and among all other individuals (n=172) attending the worship event. Passengers in Bus 2 had a 41.5 times higher risk of getting COVID-19 compared to those in Bus 1, and 11.4 times higher risk compared to all other individuals attending the worship event. Within Bus 2, passengers in high-risk zones had moderately, but non-significantly, higher risk for COVID-19 compared to those in the low-risk zones. The second outbreak occurred among 30 trainees attending a 3-day workshop in several conference rooms. The overall attack rate was 48.3%. In both buses and conference rooms, central air-conditioners were in indoor re- circulation mode. Conclusion: Airborne spread of COVID-19 appears to at least partially explain the high attack rates in the exposed bus and conference rooms.\n\nAirborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2: The world should face the reality Envt. Int. 6-2020 Science explains the mechanisms of such transport and there is evidence that this is a significant route of infection in indoor environments. Despite this, no countries or authorities consider airborne spread of COVID-19 in their regulations to prevent infections transmission indoors.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples of quarantined households medRxiv 2-6-2020 26 of all 43 tested adults (60.47 %) tested positive by RT-PCR. All analysed air samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Only 3.36 % of all object samples tested positive: one remote control, two metallic door knobs and one wooden stove overlay. 15.15 % of all wastewater samples (washbasin, showers and toilets) tested positive.This study supports the hypothesis that indirect environmental transmission may only play a minor role, which needs clarifications in further studies.\n\nCoronavirus was already in Italy by December, waste water study finds BBC 19-6-2020 Italian scientists say sewage water from two cities contained coronavirus traces in December, long before the country's first confirmed cases. The National Institute of Health (ISS) said water from Milan and Turin showed genetic virus traces on 18 December.
