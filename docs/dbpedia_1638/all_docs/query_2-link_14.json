        "text": "Learning Objectives\n\nDefine half-life.\n\nDetermine the amount of radioactive substance remaining after a given number of half-lives.\n\nDefine a radioactive decay series.\n\nWhether or not a given isotope is radioactive is a characteristic of that particular isotope. Some isotopes are stable indefinitely, while others are radioactive and decay through a characteristic form of emission. As time passes, less and less of the radioactive isotope will be present, and the level of radioactivity decreases. An interesting and useful aspect of radioactive decay is half life. which is the amount of time it takes for one-half of a radioactive isotope to decay. The half-life of a specific radioactive isotope is constant; it is unaffected by conditions and is independent of the initial amount of that isotope.\n\nFor example, cobalt-60, an isotope that emits gamma rays used to treat cancer, has a half-life of 5.27 years (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)). In a given cobalt-60 source, since half of the \\(\\ce{^{60}_{27}Co}\\) nuclei decay every 5.27 years, both the amount of material and the intensity of the radiation emitted is cut in half every 5.27 years. (Note that for a given substance, the intensity of radiation that it produces is directly proportional to the rate of decay of the substance and the amount of the substance.) This is as expected for a process following first-order kinetics. Thus, a cobalt-60 source that is used for cancer treatment must be replaced regularly to continue to be effective.\n\nWe can determine the amount of a radioactive isotope remaining after a given number half-lives by using the following expression:\n\n\\[amount\\; \\: remaining\\: =\\: initial\\:amount\\times \\left ( \\frac{1}{2} \\right )^{n} \\nonumber \\]\n\nwhere n is the number of half-lives. This expression works even if the number of half-lives is not a whole number.\n\nExample \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\):\n\nThe half-life of fluorine-20 is 11.0 s. If a sample initially contains 5.00 g of fluorine-20, how much remains after 44.0 s?\n\nSolution\n\nIf we compare the time that has passed to the isotope's half-life, we note that 44.0 s is exactly 4 half-lives, so using the previous expression, n = 4. Substituting and solving results in the following:\n\n\\[amount\\; \\: remaining\\: =\\: 5.00g\\times \\left ( \\frac{1}{2} \\right )^{4}\\\\ amount\\; \\: remaining\\: =\\: 5.00g\\times \\left ( \\frac{1}{16} \\right )\\\\ amount\\; \\: remaining\\: =\\: 0.313g \\nonumber \\]\n\nLess than one-third of a gram of fluorine-20 remains.\n\nExercise \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)\n\nThe half-life of titanium-44 is 60.0 y. A sample of titanium contains 0.600 g of titanium-44. How much remains after 240.0 y?\n\nAnswer\n\n0.0375 g\n\nExample \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)\n\nIf there are 60 grams of \\(\\ce{Np}\\)-240 present, how much \\(\\ce{Np}\\)-240 will remain after 4 hours? (\\(\\ce{Np}\\)-240 has a half-life of 1 hour)\n\nSolution\n\n\\(\\ce{Np}\\)-240 with a half life of only 1 hour.\n\nAfter 4 hours, only \\(3.75 \\: \\text{g}\\) of our original \\(60 \\: \\text{g}\\) sample would remain the radioactive isotope \\(\\ce{Np}\\)-240.\n\nExercise \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)\n\nA sample of \\(\\ce{Ac}\\)-225 originally contained 80 grams and after 50 days only 2.55 grams of the original \\(\\ce{Ac}\\)-225 remain. What is the half life of \\(\\ce{Ac}\\)-225?\n\nAnswer\n\n10 days.\n\nThe half-lives of many radioactive isotopes have been determined and they have been found to range from extremely long half-lives of 10 billion years to extremely short half-lives of fractions of a second. For example: the half-life of \\(\\ce{^{209}_{83}Bi}\\) is 1.9 × 1019 years; \\(\\ce{^{239}_{94}Ra}\\) is 24,000 years; \\(\\ce{^{222}_{86}Rn}\\) is 3.82 days; and element-111 (Rg for roentgenium) is 1.5 × 10–3 seconds. The table below illustrates half-lives for several selected elements."
