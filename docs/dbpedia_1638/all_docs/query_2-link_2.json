        "text": "Drug Half-life Explained\n\nMedically reviewed by Carmen Pope, BPharm. Last updated on May 23, 2022.\n\nWhat is the half-life of a Drug?\n\nThe half-life of a drug is an estimate of the time it takes for the concentration or amount in the body of that drug to be reduced by exactly one-half (50%). The symbol for half-life is t½.\n\nFor example, if 100mg of a drug with a half-life of 60 minutes is taken, the following is estimated:\n\n60 minutes after administration, 50mg remains\n\n120 minutes after administration, 25mg remains\n\n180 minutes after administration, 12.5mg remains\n\n240 minutes after administration, 6.25mg remains\n\n300 minutes after administration, 3.125mg remains.\n\nIn theory, we can see that after 300 minutes, almost 97% of this drug is expected to have been eliminated. Most drugs are considered to have a negligible effect after four-to-five half-lives. However, this does not mean that won’t be detectable, for example, during a drug test. Just that they will have no effect.\n\nIn reality, the actual half-life of a drug varies from person to person, because it depends on a number of different patient- and drug-specific factors. These affect how well a particular drug is distributed around a person’s body (called the volume of distribution), or how fast a person excretes that drug (called the drug clearance). For example, the IV drug gentamicin, which is cleared through the kidneys, has a half-life of 2-3 hours in a young person with no kidney disease, but its half-life is over 24 hours in somebody with severe kidney disease.\n\nGenerally, it is difficult to precisely say how long a drug or substance will take to be excreted from someone’s body. This is an important fact for athletes or people in occupations that require them to be substance-free to remember. Half-lives in the anti-doping world are of limited value because they do not reflect the presence of metabolites (break-down products from the parent drug), which are often what is measured in anti-doping tests. In addition, serum half-life does not necessarily reflect urine concentrations, which is the main way they take samples for drug testing.\n\nPatient-specific variables that may affect half-life\n\nAge\n\nBlood circulation\n\nDiet (eg, grapefruit juice and several drugs, green vegetables, and warfarin)\n\nExcessive fluid (such as in people with heart failure or edema) or low fluid levels (dehydration)\n\nGender\n\nHistory of previous drug use\n\nKidney function (for drugs that are cleared via the kidneys)\n\nLiver function (for drugs that are metabolized through the liver)\n\nObesity\n\nPre-existing conditions (such as heart failure, gastrointestinal disorders, pregnancy)\n\nPresence of drugs that compete for binding sites or interact in other ways\n\nRace/ethnicity or genetics (this can influence the metabolism of a drug)\n\nSmoking\n\nOther variables, such as if the person is on hemodialysis.\n\nDrug-specific variables that may affect half-life\n\nDrug formulation (ie, modified or controlled release preparations extend half-life)\n\nHow the drug behaves in the body (ie, zero-order, first-order, or multi-compartmental pharmacokinetics)\n\nHow the drug is administered (half-life may be different with IV administration, compared to intranasal or oral administration)\n\nHow the drug is cleared from the body (eg, kidneys, liver, lungs)\n\nIf the drug accumulates in fat or other types of tissue\n\nIf the drug binds to proteins or not\n\nPresence of metabolites or other drugs that may interact\n\nProperties of the drug, including molecule size, charge, and pKa\n\nThe volume of distribution of a drug\n\nOther variables, such as if the drug is actively transported, is self-induced, or has saturation pharmacokinetics.\n\nShort versus long half-lives\n\nDrugs or substances that have a shorter half-life tend to act very quickly, but their effects wear off rapidly, meaning that they usually need to be taken several times a day to have the same effect. Drugs with a longer half-life may take longer to start working, but their effects persist for longer, and they may only need to be dosed once a day, once a week, once a month, or even less frequently.\n\nWhen considering drugs with a high addiction or dependence potential, those with a short half-life are typically harder to withdraw from than those with a long half-life. For this reason, drug treatment programs will often switch a person from a short-acting drug to a long-acting equivalent from the same class, in order to improve the withdrawal process.\n\nList of common medicines or substances and their half-lives\n\nGeneric Name Brand Name Examples Half-life (T1/2*) Alprazolam Xanax 6-12 hours Amiodarone Pacerone 15-142 days Amphetamine Adderall, Dexedrine 10-12 hours Atenolol Tenormin 6-7 hours Clonazepam Klonopin 18-50 hours Cocaine - 50 minutes Diazepam Valium 20-100 hours Donepezil Aricept 70 hours Dutasteride Avodart 5 weeks Erenumab Aimovig 28 days Fluoxetine Prozac 2-4 days Heroin - 2-6 minutes Lead - 28-36 days Mercury - 65 days Methamphetamine Desoxyn 6.4-15 hours Methylphenidate Concerta, Ritalin 2-3 hours Plutonium - 40 years (liver), 100 years (bone) Phenytoin Dilantin, Phenytek 7-42 hours Tetrahydrocannabinol (cannabis/marijuana) - Infrequent users: 1.3 days\n\nRegular users: 13 days Warfarin Coumadin, Jantoven 1 week\n\n* Note that half-life varies depending on the source used. Half-life in this table refers to the elimination half-life.\n\nSee also\n\nCommon Drug Side Effects\n\nDoes grapefruit juice interact with my medications?\n\nDrug Expiration Dates - Are expired drugs still safe to take?\n\nGeneric vs Brand Drugs: Your FAQs Answered\n\nHow do I remember to take my medications?\n\nHow do I stop my medication safely?\n\nHow to Safely Dispose of Your Old Medications\n\nImprint Code FAQs - For Oral Medications\n\nInjection Types and Sites\n\nMedical Conversions - How many mL in a teaspoon?\n\nPill splitting - Is it safe?\n\nTop 150 Prescription Abbreviations & Medical Meanings\n\nTop 5 Ways to Avoid Drug Errors\n\nTop 9 Ways to Prevent a Deadly Drug Interaction\n\nWhat are pharmaceutical salt names?\n\nWhat are the risks vs. benefits of medications?\n\nWhat is the placebo effect?\n\nFurther information\n\nAlways consult your healthcare provider to ensure the information displayed on this page applies to your personal circumstances."
