It is generally not used for Plasmodium falciparum as there is widespread resistance to it.[12][13]\n\nChloroquine has been extensively used in mass drug administrations, which may have contributed to the emergence and spread of resistance. It is recommended to check if chloroquine is still effective in the region prior to using it.[14] In areas where resistance is present, other antimalarials, such as mefloquine or atovaquone, may be used instead. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend against treatment of malaria with chloroquine alone due to more effective combinations.[15]\n\nAmebiasis\n\nIn treatment of amoebic liver abscess, chloroquine may be used instead of or in addition to other medications in the event of failure of improvement with metronidazole or another nitroimidazole within 5 days or intolerance to metronidazole or a nitroimidazole.[16]\n\nRheumatic disease\n\nAs it mildly suppresses the immune system, chloroquine is used in some autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus.[1]\n\nSide effects\n\nSide effects include blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache, diarrhea, swelling legs/ankles, shortness of breath, pale lips/nails/skin, muscle weakness, easy bruising/bleeding, hearing and mental problems.[17][18]\n\nUnwanted/uncontrolled movements (including tongue and face twitching) [17]\n\nDeafness or tinnitus.[17]\n\nNausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps[18]\n\nHeadache.[17]\n\nMental/mood changes (such as confusion, personality changes, unusual thoughts/behavior, depression, feeling being watched, hallucinating)[17][18]\n\nSigns of serious infection (such as high fever, severe chills, persistent sore throat)[17]\n\nSkin itchiness, skin color changes, hair loss, and skin rashes.[18][19]\n\nChloroquine-induced itching is very common among black Africans (70%), but much less common in other races. It increases with age, and is so severe as to stop compliance with drug therapy. It is increased during malaria fever; its severity is correlated to the malaria parasite load in blood. Some evidence indicates it has a genetic basis and is related to chloroquine action with opiate receptors centrally or peripherally.[20]\n\nUnpleasant metallic taste\n\nThis could be avoided by “taste-masked and controlled release” formulations such as multiple emulsions.[21]\n\nChloroquine retinopathy\n\nElectrocardiographic changes[22]\n\nThis manifests itself as either conduction disturbances (bundle-branch block, atrioventricular block) or Cardiomyopathy – often with hypertrophy, restrictive physiology, and congestive heart failure. The changes may be irreversible. Only two cases have been reported requiring heart transplantation, suggesting this particular risk is very low. Electron microscopy of cardiac biopsies show pathognomonic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies.\n\nPancytopenia, aplastic anemia, reversible agranulocytosis, low blood platelets, neutropenia.[23]\n\nPregnancy\n\nChloroquine has not been shown to have any harmful effects on the fetus when used for malarial prophylaxis.[24] Small amounts of chloroquine are excreted in the breast milk of lactating women. However, this drug can be safely prescribed to infants, the effects are not harmful. Studies with mice show that radioactively tagged chloroquine passed through the placenta rapidly and accumulated in the fetal eyes which remained present five months after the drug was cleared from the rest of the body.[23][25] Women who are pregnant or planning on getting pregnant are still advised against traveling to malaria-risk regions.[24]\n\nElderly\n\nThere is not enough evidence to determine whether chloroquine is safe to be given to people aged 65 and older. Since it is cleared by the kidneys, toxicity should be monitored carefully in people with poor kidney functions.[23]\n\nDrug interactions\n\nChloroquine has a number of drug-drug interactions that might be of clinical concern:[citation needed]\n\nAmpicillin– levels may be reduced by chloroquine;[23]\n\nAntacids– may reduce absorption of chloroquine;[23]\n\nCimetidine– may inhibit metabolism of chloroquine; increasing levels of chloroquine in the body;[23]\n\nCyclosporine– levels may be increased by chloroquine;[23] and\n\nMefloquine– may increase risk of convulsions.[23]\n\nOverdose\n\nChloroquine is very dangerous in overdose. It is rapidly absorbed from the gut. In 1961, a published compilation of case reports contained accounts of three children who took overdoses and died within 2.5 hours of taking the drug. While the amount of the overdose was not stated, the therapeutic index for chloroquine is known to be small.[26] One of the children died after taking 0.75 or 1 gram, or twice a single therapeutic amount for children. Symptoms of overdose include headache, drowsiness, visual disturbances, nausea and vomiting, cardiovascular collapse, seizures, and sudden respiratory and cardiac arrest.[23]\n\nAn analog of chloroquine – hydroxychloroquine – has a long half-life (32–56 days) in blood and a large volume of distribution (580–815 L/kg).[27] The therapeutic, toxic and lethal ranges are usually considered to be 0.03 to 15 mg/l, 3.0 to 26 mg/l and 20 to 104 mg/l, respectively. However, nontoxic cases have been reported up to 39 mg/l, suggesting individual tolerance to this agent may be more variable than previously recognised.[27]\n\nPharmacology\n\nChloroquine’s absorption of the drug is rapid. It is widely distributed in body tissues. It’s protein binding is 55%.[ It’s metabolism is partially hepatic, giving rise to its main metabolite, desethylchloroquine. It’s excretion os ≥50% as unchanged drug in urine, where acidification of urine increases its elimination It has a very high volume of distribution, as it diffuses into the body’s adipose tissue.\n\nAccumulation of the drug may result in deposits that can lead to blurred vision and blindness. It and related quinines have been associated with cases of retinal toxicity, particularly when provided at higher doses for longer times. With long-term doses, routine visits to an ophthalmologist are recommended.\n\nChloroquine is also a lysosomotropic agent, meaning it accumulates preferentially in the lysosomes of cells in the body. The pKa for the quinoline nitrogen of chloroquine is 8.5, meaning—in simplified terms, considering only this basic site—it is about 10% deprotonated at physiological pH (per the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation) This decreases to about 0.2% at a lysosomal pH of 4.6.Because the deprotonated form is more membrane-permeable than the protonated form, a quantitative “trapping” of the compound in lysosomes results.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nMalaria\n\nThe lysosomotropic character of chloroquine is believed to account for much of its antimalarial activity; the drug concentrates in the acidic food vacuole of the parasite and interferes with essential processes. Its lysosomotropic properties further allow for its use for in vitro experiments pertaining to intracellular lipid related diseases,[28][29] autophagy, and apoptosis.[30]\n\nInside red blood cells, the malarial parasite, which is then in its asexual lifecycle stage, must degrade hemoglobin to acquire essential amino acids, which the parasite requires to construct its own protein and for energy metabolism. Digestion is carried out in a vacuole of the parasitic cell.[citation needed]\n\nHemoglobin is composed of a protein unit (digested by the parasite) and a heme unit (not used by the parasite). During this process, the parasite releases the toxic and soluble molecule heme. The heme moiety consists of a porphyrin ring called Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX (FP). To avoid destruction by this molecule, the parasite biocrystallizes heme to form hemozoin, a nontoxic molecule. Hemozoin collects in the digestive vacuole as insoluble crystals.[citation needed]\n\nChloroquine enters the red blood cell by simple diffusion, inhibiting the parasite cell and digestive vacuole. Chloroquine then becomes protonated (to CQ2+), as the digestive vacuole is known to be acidic (pH 4.7); chloroquine then cannot leave by diffusion. Chloroquine caps hemozoin molecules to prevent further biocrystallization of heme, thus leading to heme buildup. Chloroquine binds to heme (or FP) to form the FP-chloroquine complex; this complex is highly toxic to the cell and disrupts membrane function. Action of the toxic FP-chloroquine and FP results in cell lysis and ultimately parasite cell autodigestion. [31] Parasites that do not form hemozoin are therefore resistant to chloroquine.[32]\n\nResistance in malaria[edit source]\n\nSince the first documentation of P. falciparum chloroquine resistance in the 1950s, resistant strains have appeared throughout East and West Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America. The effectiveness of chloroquine against P. falciparum has declined as resistant strains of the parasite evolved. They effectively neutralize the drug via a mechanism that drains chloroquine away from the digestive vacuole. Chloroquine-resistant cells efflux chloroquine at 40 times the rate of chloroquine-sensitive cells; the related mutations trace back to transmembrane proteins of the digestive vacuole, including sets of critical mutations in the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT) gene. The mutated protein, but not the wild-type transporter, transports chloroquine when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (frog’s eggs) and is thought to mediate chloroquine leak from its site of action in the digestive vacuole.[33] Resistant parasites also frequently have mutated products of the ABC transporter P. falciparum multidrug resistance (PfMDR1) gene, although these mutations are thought to be of secondary importance compared to Pfcrt. Verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker, has been found to restore both the chloroquine concentration ability and sensitivity to this drug. Recently, an altered chloroquine-transporter protein CG2 of the parasite has been related to chloroquine resistance, but other mechanisms of resistance also appear to be involved.[34] Research on the mechanism of chloroquine and how the parasite has acquired chloroquine resistance is still ongoing, as other mechanisms of resistance are likely.[citation needed]\n\nOther agents which have been shown to reverse chloroquine resistance in malaria are chlorpheniramine, gefitinib, imatinib, tariquidar and zosuquidar.[35]\n\nAntiviral\n\nChloroquine has antiviral effects.[36] It increases late endosomal or lysosomal pH, resulting in impaired release of the virus from the endosome or lysosome – release requires a low pH. The virus is therefore unable to release its genetic material into the cell and replicate.[37][38]\n\nChloroquine also seems to act as a zinc ionophore, that allows extracellular zinc to enter the cell and inhibit viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.[39][40]\n\nOther\n\nChloroquine inhibits thiamine uptake.[41] It acts specifically on the transporter SLC19A3.\n\nAgainst rheumatoid arthritis, it operates by inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation, phospholipase A2, antigen presentation in dendritic cells, release of enzymes from lysosomes, release of reactive oxygen species from macrophages, and production of IL-1.\n\nHistory\n\nIn Peru the indigenous people extracted the bark of the Cinchona plant[42] trees and used the extract (Chinchona officinalis) to fight chills and fever in the seventeenth century. In 1633 this herbal medicine was introduced in Europe, where it was given the same use and also began to be used against malaria.[43] The quinoline antimalarial drug quinine was isolated from the extract in 1820, and chloroquine is an analogue of this.\n\nChloroquine was discovered in 1934, by Hans Andersag and coworkers at the Bayer laboratories, who named it “Resochin”.[44] It was ignored for a decade, because it was considered too toxic for human use. During World War II, United States government-sponsored clinical trials for antimalarial drug development showed unequivocally that chloroquine has a significant therapeutic value as an antimalarial drug. It was introduced into clinical practice in 1947 for the prophylactic treatment of malaria.[45]\n\nSociety and culture\n\nFormulations\n\nChloroquine comes in tablet form as the phosphate, sulfate, and hydrochloride salts. Chloroquine is usually dispensed as the phosphate.[46]\n\nNames\n\nBrand names include Chloroquine FNA, Resochin, Dawaquin, and Lariago.[47]\n\nOther animals\n\nChloroquine is used to control the aquarium fish parasite Amyloodinium ocellatum.[48]\n\nResearch\n\nCOVID-19\n\nIn late January 2020 during the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak, Chinese medical researchers stated that exploratory research into chloroquine and two other medications, remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir, seemed to have “fairly good inhibitory effects” on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is the virus that causes COVID-19. Requests to start clinical testing were submitted.[49] Chloroquine had been also proposed as a treatment for SARS, with in vitro tests inhibiting the SARS-CoV virus.[50][51]\n\nChloroquine has been recommended by Chinese, South Korean and Italian health authorities for the treatment of COVID-19.[52][53] These agencies noted contraindications for people with heart disease or diabetes.[54] Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, but a further study concluded that hydroxychloroquine was more potent than chloroquine, with a more tolerable safety profile.[55] Preliminary results from a trial suggested that chloroquine is effective and safe in COVID-19 pneumonia, “improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease course.”[56] Self-medication with chloroquine has caused one known fatality.[57]\n\nOn 24 March 2020, NBC News reported[58] a fatality due to misuse of a chloroquine product used to control fish parasites.[59]\n\nOther viruses\n\nIn October 2004, a group of researchers at the Rega Institute for Medical Research published a report on chloroquine, stating that chloroquine acts as an effective inhibitor of the replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in vitro.[60]\n\nChloroquine was being considered in 2003, in pre-clinical models as a potential agent against chikungunya fever.[61]\n\nOther\n\nThe radiosensitizing and chemosensitizing properties of chloroquine are beginning to be exploited in anticancer strategies in humans.[62][63] In biomedicinal science, chloroquine is used for in vitro experiments to inhibit lysosomal degradation of protein products.\n\nSYN\n\nCLIP\n\nCLIP\n\nCLIP\n\nCLIP\n\nReferences\n\n“Chloroquine”.

The drug is manufactured by Pharmstandard (Russian: Фармстандарт). Although some Russian studies have shown it to be effective, it is not approved for use in other countries. It is not approved by FDA for the treatment or prevention of influenza.[4] Chemically, umifenovir features an indole core, functionalized at all but one positions with different substituents. The drug is claimed to inhibit viral entry into target cells and stimulate the immune response. Interest in the drug has been renewed as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.\n\nUmifenovir is manufactured and made available as tablets, capsules and syrup.\n\nArbidol Hydrochloride\n\nMolecular FormulaC22H28BrClN2O4S\n\nAverage mass531.891 Da\n\n868364-57-2 [RN]\n\nStatus\n\nTesting of umifenovir’s efficacy has mainly occurred in China and Russia,[5][6] and it is well known in these two countries.[7] Some of the Russian tests showed the drug to be effective[5] and a direct comparison with Tamiflu showed similar efficiency in vitro and in a clinical setting.[8] In 2007, Arbidol (umifenovir) had the highest sales in Russia among all over-the-counter drugs.\n\nMode of action\n\nBiochemistry\n\nUmifenovir inhibits membrane fusion.[3] Umifenovir prevents contact between the virus and target host cells. Fusion between the viral envelope (surrounding the viral capsid) and the cell membrane of the target cell is inhibited. This prevents viral entry to the target cell, and therefore protects it from infection.[9]\n\nSome evidence suggests that the drug’s actions are more effective at preventing infections from RNA viruses than infections from DNA viruses.[10]\n\nAs well as specific antiviral action against both influenza A and influenza B viruses, umifenovir exhibits modulatory effects on the immune system. The drug stimulates a humoral immune response, induces interferon-production, and stimulates the phagocytic function of macrophages.[11]\n\nClinical application\n\nUmifenovir is used primarily as an antiviral treatments for influenza. The drug has also been investigated as a candidate drug for treatment of hepatitis C.[12]\n\nMore recent studies indicate that umifenovir also has in vitro effectiveness at preventing entry of Ebolavirus Zaïre Kikwit, Tacaribe arenavirus and human herpes virus 8 in mammalian cell cultures, while confirming umifenovir’s suppressive effect in vitro on Hepatitis B and poliovirus infection of mammalian cells when introduced either in advance of viral infection or during infection.[13][14]\n\nResearch\n\nIn February 2020, Li Lanjuan, an expert of the National Health Commission of China, proposed using Arbidol (umifenovir) together with darunavir as a potential treatment during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.[15] Chinese experts claim that preliminary tests had shown that arbidol and darunavir could inhibit replication of the virus.[16][17] So far without additional effect if added on top of recombinant human interferon α2b spray.[18]\n\nSide effects\n\nSide effects in children include sensitization to the drug.

The reaction of (III) with thiophenol in KOH yields (IV) , which is then submitted to a conventional Mannich condensation with formaldehyde and dimethylamine in acetic acid, giving the free base of arbidol (V), which is treated with aqueous hydrochloric acid .\n\nCLIP\n\nUmifenovir\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045206820317867\n\nUmifenovir (Arbidol®) is an indole derivative first marketed in 1993 for the prophylactic treatment of infections caused by influenza A and B viruses [74]. Produced by Pharmstandard, it is still currently used in Russia and China to treat influenza infections [75]. Umifenovir is marketed in 50 and 100 mg capsules, being administered orally. The pharmacokinetics is limited, presenting rapid absorption and reaching the maximum concentration in 1.6–1.8 h. It is a slow elimination drug, with a half-life of 16 to 21 h, and may be administered twice a day [76].\n\nThe drug’s anti-influenza mechanism of action is related to arbidol’s ability to bind to the haemagglutinin (HA) protein [77]. The haemagglutinin (HA) protein is a homotrimeric glycoprotein found on the surface of the influenza virus, and it is essential for its infectivity. This protein is responsible for allowing the influenza virus binding to the sialic acid present on the surface of the target cells (respiratory tract cells or erythrocytes). As a result of this interaction, the virus is internalized in the host cell. Once umifenovir binds to the HA protein, this glycoprotein is prevented from binding to sialic acid, so the virus is no longer able to penetrate the host cell [78].\n\nThe structural similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 peak and the influenza virus (H3N2) HA glycoproteins justifies the fact that drugs that are capable of binding to HA can also do so to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This fact was evidenced by molecular modeling studies, wherein was demonstrated that umifenovir is able to bind to the protein peak, preventing its trimerization, which would be a determining factor for the mechanism of cell adhesion (Fig. 8) [78].\n\nRecently in 2020, in vitro studies performed with Vero cells confirmed that arbidol efficiently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection with an EC50 of 4.11 μM. The author also determined that arbidol was able to efficiently block both viral entry and post-entry stages, and also concluded that the drug prevented the viral attachment and release of SARS-CoV-2 from the intracellular vesicles. Importantly, the EC50 of arbidol against SARS-CoV-2 led the authors to suggest that the dose of arbidol currently recommended by the Chinese Guidelines (200 mg, 3 times/day) should be elevated in order to achieve ideal therapeutic efficacy to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 infection [79].\n\nA clinical trial was conducted at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, in 2020, from February 2 to March 20 conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of umifenovir in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. In this study, 81 patients were evaluated: 45 received 200 mg of umifenovir three times a day, and 36 were in the control group. The authors concluded that baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were similar in the two groups, and patients in the umifenovir group had a longer hospital stay than those in the control [80]. Although such results may seem discouraging, further clinical trials with higher doses of umifenovir may be required in order to verify its clinical efficiency against the SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nThe synthesis of umifenovir was described in 2006 starting from the reaction between ethyl acetoacetate 63 and methylamine, giving enaminone 64, which next undergoes a Nentizescu condensation reaction with 1,4-benzoquinone to produce indole derivative 65 (Scheme 9). Then, an acetylation reaction is carried out to protect the hydroxyl group in 65, producing 66, which is converted to 67 after a bromination step. The reaction of intermediate 67 with thiophenol in basic medium leads to the formation of 68, which finally affords umifenovir after a Mannich reaction [81].\n\nQ. Guo, M. Xu, S. Guo, F. Zhu, Y.

The pandemic has already strained global supply chains and limited the availability of a number of products, including hand sanitizer and diagnostic test reagents. The raw materials needed to make a new antiviral drug would most likely face similar pressures. But a team led by Tim Cernak of the University of Michigan has used an AI-based retrosynthesis program called Synthia to devise alternative routes to 12 leading drug candidates under investigation. The work appears on a preprint server and has not been peer reviewed (ChemRxiv 2020, DOI: 10.26434/chemrxiv.12765410.v1). “If the world runs out of one of the drugs currently in the clinic, we are providing a backup recipe,” Cernak says. Using alternative starting materials that are readily available, the researchers aimed to find routes of similar length and cost to those of existing syntheses. For each compound, the researchers whittled down a long list of options offered by Synthia to identify the most suitable synthetic strategies. Then the team tested some of these syntheses in the lab, including four new routes to the antiviral umifenovir, currently being investigated in eight clinical trials against COVID-19. Cernak says this approach could be used more generally to rapidly identify alternative synthetic routes whenever crises cause supply chain disruptions in drug manufacturing.\n\nArtificial intelligence finds alternative routes to COVID-19 drug candidates\n\nIf drug-repurposing studies hit pay dirt, backup recipes could help antiviral manufacturers avoid supply chain problems\n\nby Mark Peplow, special to C&EN\n\nAugust 14, 2020 | A version of this story appeared in Volume 98, Issue 31\n\nCLIP\n\nThe research on the disease COVID-19 is an ongoing process since its outbreak as a pandemic.

Its invention is credited to a collaboration between Russian scientists from several research institutes 40-50 years ago, and reports of its chemical synthesis date back to 1993.13 Umifenovir’s ability to exert antiviral effects through multiple pathways has resulted in considerable investigation into its use for a variety of enveloped and non-enveloped RNA and DNA viruses, including Flavivirus,2 Zika virus,3 foot-and-mouth disease,4 Lassa virus,6 Ebola virus,6 herpes simplex,8, hepatitis B and C viruses, chikungunya virus, reovirus, Hantaan virus, and coxsackie virus B5.13,9 This dual activity may also confer additional protection against viral resistance, as the development of resistance to umifenovir does not appear to be significant.13\n\nUmifenovir is currently being investigated as a potential treatment and prophylactic agent for COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV2 infections in combination with both currently available and investigational HIV therapies.1,16,17\n\nIndication\n\nUmifenovir is currently licensed in China and Russia for the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza and other respiratory viral infections.13 It has demonstrated activity against a number of viruses and has been investigated in the treatment of Flavivirus,2 Zika virus,3 foot-and-mouth disease,4 Lassa virus,6 Ebola virus,6 and herpes simplex.8 In addition, it has shown in vitro activity against hepatitis B and C viruses, chikungunya virus, reovirus, Hantaan virus, and coxsackie virus B5.13,9\n\nUmifenovir is currently being investigated as a potential treatment and prophylactic agent for the prevention of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections.1,16\n\nPharmacodynamics\n\nUmifenovir exerts its antiviral effects via both direct-acting virucidal activity and by inhibiting one (or several) stage(s) of the viral life cycle.13 Its broad-spectrum of activity covers both enveloped and non-enveloped RNA and DNA viruses. It is relatively well-tolerated and possesses a large therapeutic window – weight-based doses up to 100-fold greater than those used in humans failed to produce any pathological changes in test animals.13\n\nUmifenovir does not appear to result in significant viral resistance. Instances of umifenovir-resistant influenza virus demonstrated a single mutation in the HA2 subunit of influenza hemagglutinin, suggesting resistance is conferred by prevention of umifenovir’s activity related to membrane fusion. The mechanism through which other viruses may become resistant to umifenovir requires further study.13\n\nMechanism of action\n\nUmifenovir is considered both a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) due to direct virucidal effects and a host-targeting agent (HTA) due to effects on one or multiple stages of viral life cycle (e.g. attachment, internalization), and its broad-spectrum antiviral activity is thought to be due to this dual activity.13 It is a hydrophobic molecule capable of forming aromatic stacking interactions with certain amino acid residues (e.g. tyrosine, tryptophan), which contributes to its ability to directly act against viruses. Antiviral activity may also be due to interactions with aromatic residues within the viral glycoproteins involved in fusion and cellular recognition,5,7 with the plasma membrane to interfere with clathrin-mediated exocytosis and intracellular trafficking,10 or directly with the viral lipid envelope itself (in enveloped viruses).13,12 Interactions at the plasma membrane may also serve to stabilize it and prevent viral entry (e.g. stabilizing influenza hemagglutinin inhibits the fusion step necessary for viral entry).13\n\nDue to umifenovir’s ability to interact with both viral proteins and lipids, it may also interfere with later stages of the viral life cycle. Some virus families, such as Flaviviridae, replicate in a subcellular compartment called the membranous web – this web requires lipid-protein interactions that may be hindered by umifenovir. Similarly, viral assembly of hepatitis C viruses is contingent upon the assembly of lipoproteins, presenting another potential target.13\n\nAbsorption\n\nUmifenovir is rapidly absorbed following oral administration, with an estimated Tmax between 0.65-1.8 hours.14,15,13 The Cmax has been estimated as 415 – 467 ng/mL and appears to increase linearly with dose,14,15 and the AUC0-inf following oral administration has been estimated to be approximately 2200 ng/mL/h.14,15\n\nVolume of distribution\n\nData regarding the volume of distribution of umifenovir are currently unavailable.\n\nProtein binding\n\nData regarding protein-binding of umifenovir are currently unavailable.\n\nMetabolism\n\nUmifenovir is highly metabolized in the body, primarily in hepatic and intestinal microsomess, with approximately 33 metabolites having been observed in human plasma, urine, and feces.14 The principal phase I metabolic pathways include sulfoxidation, N-demethylation, and hydroxylation, followed by phase II sulfate and glucuronide conjugation. In the urine, the major metabolites were sulfate and glucuronide conjugates, while the major species in the feces was unchanged parent drug (~40%) and the M10 metabolite (~3.0%). In the plasma, the principal metabolites are M6-1, M5, and M8 – of these, M6-1 appears of most importance given its high plasma exposure and long elimination half-life (~25h), making it a potentially important player in the safety and efficacy of umifenovir.14\n\nEnzymes involved in the metabolism of umifenovir include members of the cytochrome P450 family (primarily CYP3A4), flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) family, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family (specifically UGT1A9 and UGT2B7).14,11\n\nLu H: Drug treatment options for the 2019-new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is evaluating remdesivir in phase II/III clinical trials for the treatment of Ebola virus infection.\n\nThe compound has been evaluated in preclinical studies for the potential treatment of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections.\n\nRemdesivir is a nucleoside analogue, with effective antiviral activity, with EC50s of 74 nM for ARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in HAE cells, and 30 nM for murine hepatitis virus in delayed brain tumor cells.\n\nRemdesivir (development code GS-5734) is a novel antiviral drug in the class of nucleotide analogs. It was developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections,[1] though it has subsequently also been found to show antiviral activity against other single stranded RNA viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, Junin virus, Lassa fever virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and the coronaviruses (including MERS and SARS viruses).[2][3] It is being studied for SARS-CoV-2 and Nipah and Hendra virus infections.[4][5][6] Based on success against other coronavirus infections, Gilead provided remdesivir to physicians who treated an American patient in Snohomish County, Washington in 2020, infected with SARS-CoV-2[7] and is providing the compound to China to conduct a pair of trials in infected individuals with and without severe symptoms.[8]\n\nResearch usage\n\nLaboratory tests suggest remdesivir is effective against a wide range of viruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The medication was pushed to treat the West African Ebola virus epidemic of 2013–2016. Although the drug turned out to be safe, it was not particularly effective against filoviruses such as the Ebola virus.\n\nEbola virus\n\nRemdesivir was rapidly pushed through clinical trials due to the West African Ebola virus epidemic of 2013–2016, eventually being used in at least one human patient despite its early development stage at the time. Preliminary results were promising and it was used in the emergency setting during the Kivu Ebola epidemic that started in 2018 along with further clinical trials, until August 2019, when Congolese health officials announced that it was significantly less effective than monoclonal antibody treatments such as mAb114 and REGN-EB3. The trials, however, established its safety profile.[9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]\n\nSARS-CoV-2\n\nIn response to the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak induced by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, Gilead provided remdesivir for a “small number of patients” in collaboration with Chinese medical authorities for studying its effects.[17]\n\nGilead also started laboratory testing of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2. Gilead stated that remdesivir was “shown to be active” against SARS and MERS in animals.[3][18]\n\nIn late January 2020, remdesivir was administered to the first US patient to be confirmed to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, in Snohomish County, Washington, for “compassionate use” after he progressed to pneumonia. While no broad conclusions were made based on the single treatment, the patient’s condition improved dramatically the next day,[7] and he was eventually discharged.[19]\n\nAlso in late January 2020, Chinese medical researchers stated to the media that in exploratory research considering a selection of 30 drug candidates. Remdesivir and two other drugs, chloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, seemed to have “fairly good inhibitory effects” on SARS-CoV-2 at the cellular level. Requests to start clinical testing were submitted,[20][21]. On February 6, 2020, a clinical trial of remdesivir began in China.[22]\n\nOther viruses\n\nThe active form of remdesivir, GS-441524, shows promise for treating feline coronavirus.[23]\n\nMechanism of action and resistance\n\nRemdesivir is a prodrug that metabolizes into its active form GS-441524. GS-441524 is an adenosine nucleotide analog that confuses viral RNA polymerase and evades proofreading by viral exoribonuclease (ExoN), causing a decrease in viral RNA production. It was unknown whether it terminates RNA chains or causes mutations in them.[24]However, it has been learned that the RNA dependent RNA polymerase of ebolavirus is inhibited for the most part by delayed chain termination.[25]\n\nMutations in the mouse hepatitis virus RNA replicase that cause partial resistance were identified in 2018. These mutations make the viruses less effective in nature, and the researchers believe they will likely not persist where the drug is not being used.[24]\n\nMORE SYNTHESIS COMING, WATCH THIS SPACE…………………..\n\nSYNTHESIS\n\nRemdesivir can be synthesized in multiple steps from ribose derivatives. The figure below is one of the synthesis route of remdesivir invented by Chun et al. from Gilead Sciences.[26]In this method, intermediate a is firstly prepared from L-alanine and phenyl phosphorodichloridate in presence of triethylamine and dichloromethane; triple benzyl-protected ribose is oxidized by dimethyl sulfoxide with acetic anhydride and give the lactone intermediate b; pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-4-amine is brominated, and the amine group is protected by excess trimethylsilyl chloride. n-Butyllithium undergoes a halogen-lithium exchange reaction with the bromide at -78 °C to yield the intermediate c. The intermediate b is then added to a solution containing intermediate c dropwise. After quenching the reaction in a weakly acidic aqueous solution, a mixture of 1: 1 anomers was obtained. It was then reacted with an excess of trimethylsilyl cyanide in dichloromethane at -78 °C for 10 minutes. Trimethylsilyl triflate was added and reacts for an additional 1 hour, and the mixture was quenched in an aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate. A nitrile intermediate was obtained. The protective group, benzyl, was then removed with boron trichloride in dichloromethane at -20 °C. The excess of boron trichloride was quenched in a mixture of potassium carbonate and methanol. A benzyl-free intermediate was obtained. The isomers were then separated via reversed-phase HPLC. The optically pure compound and intermediate a are reacted with trimethyl phosphate and methylimidazole to obtain a diastereomer mixture of remdesivir. In the end, optically pure remdesivir can be obtained through methods such as chiral resolution.\n\nThe synthesis of Remdesivir was invented by Byoung Kwon Chun et al. from Gilead Sciences, Inc. and claimed in the patent, WO2016069826A1.\n\n中文: 瑞德西韋的合成方法是由吉利德科學公司的 Byoung Kwon Chun等人所發明，並在WO2016069826A1中聲明專利。\n\nPATENT\n\nWO 2018204198\n\nhttps://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf;jsessionid=E7724EB6CA3959303E18B3D392E0219F.wapp1nA?docId=WO2018204198&tab=PCTDESCRIPTION\n\nPrevention and treatment methods for some Arenaviridae , Coronaviridae , Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, and Paramyxoviridae viruses present challenges due to a lack of vaccine or post-exposure treatment modality for preventing or managing these infections.
