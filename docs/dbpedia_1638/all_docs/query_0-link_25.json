Generic versions have been on the market since that time. Generic fluvoxamine was still available in the US by May 2007, despite the fact the Solvay/Jazz product had not been relaunched . By October 2004, the drug was also off patent in most European countries .\n\nMedical uses\n\nFluvoxamine is approved in the United States for OCD,[9][6] and social anxiety disorder.[10] In other countries (e.g., Australia,[11][12] the UK,[13] and Russia[14]) it also has indications for major depressive disorder. In Japan it is currently[when?] approved to treat OCD, SAD and MDD.[15][16] Fluvoxamine is indicated for children and adolescents with OCD.[17] The drug works long-term, and retains its therapeutic efficacy for at least one year.[18] It has also been found to possess some analgesic properties in line with other SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants.[19][20][21]\n\nThere is tentative evidence that fluvoxamine is effective for social phobia in adults.[22] Fluvoxamine is also effective for GAD, SAD, panic disorder and separation anxiety disorder in children and adolescents.[23] There is tentative evidence that fluvoxamine may help some people with negative symptoms of chronic schizophrenia.[24][25]\n\nA double-blind controlled study found that fluvoxamine may prevent clinical deterioration in outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19. The study had important limitations: it was run fully remotely; it had a small sample size (150) and short follow-up duration (15 days).[26] The accompanying editorial noted that, although this study is important enough to choose out of more than 10,000 other COVID-19 related submissions, it “presents only preliminary information” and “the findings should be interpreted as only hypothesis generating; they should not be used as the basis for current treatment decisions.”[27] Similarly, the study authors themselves cautioned that “the trial’s results should not be treated as a measure of fluvoxamine’s effectiveness against COVID-19 but as an encouraging indicator that the drug warrants further testing.”[28] A prospective open-labelled cohort study showed similar results.[29]\n\nAdverse effects\n\nGastrointestinal side effects are more common in those receiving fluvoxamine than with other SSRIs.[30] Otherwise, fluvoxamine’s side-effect profile is very similar to other SSRIs.[2][9][11][13][31][32]Common (1–10% incidence) adverse effects\n\nNausea\n\nVomiting\n\nWeight loss\n\nYawning\n\nLoss of appetite\n\nAgitation\n\nNervousness\n\nAnxiety\n\nInsomnia\n\nSomnolence (drowsiness)\n\nTremor\n\nRestlessness\n\nHeadache\n\nDizziness\n\nPalpitations\n\nTachycardia (high heart rate)\n\nAbdominal pain\n\nDyspepsia (indigestion)\n\nDiarrhea\n\nConstipation\n\nHyperhidrosis (excess sweating)\n\nAsthenia (weakness)\n\nMalaise\n\nSexual dysfunction (including delayed ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, etc.)\n\nXerostomia (dry mouth)\n\nUncommon (0.1–1% incidence) adverse effects\n\nArthralgia\n\nHallucination\n\nConfusional state\n\nExtrapyramidal side effects (e.g. dystonia, parkinsonism, tremor, etc.)\n\nOrthostatic hypotension\n\nCutaneous hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. oedema [buildup of fluid in the tissues], rash, pruritus)\n\nRare (0.01–0.1% incidence) adverse effects\n\nMania\n\nSeizures\n\nAbnormal hepatic (liver) function\n\nPhotosensitivity (being abnormally sensitive to light)\n\nGalactorrhoea (expulsion of breast milk unrelated to pregnancy or breastfeeding)\n\nUnknown frequency adverse effects\n\nHyperprolactinaemia (elevated plasma prolactin levels leading to galactorrhoea, amenorrhoea [cessation of menstrual cycles], etc.)\n\nBone fractures\n\nGlaucoma\n\nMydriasis\n\nUrinary incontinence\n\nUrinary retention\n\nBed-wetting\n\nSerotonin syndrome — a potentially fatal condition characterised by abrupt onset muscle rigidity, hyperthermia (elevated body temperature), rhabdomyolysis, mental status changes (e.g. coma, hallucinations, agitation), etc.\n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome — practically identical presentation to serotonin syndrome except with a more prolonged onset\n\nAkathisia — a sense of inner restlessness that presents itself with the inability to stay still\n\nParaesthesia\n\nDysgeusia\n\nHaemorrhage\n\nWithdrawal symptoms\n\nWeight changes\n\nSuicidal ideation and behaviour\n\nViolence towards others[33]\n\nHyponatraemia\n\nSyndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion\n\nEcchymoses\n\nInteractions[edit]\n\nLuvox (fluvoxamine) 100 mg film-coated scored tablets\n\nFluvoxamine inhibits the following cytochrome P450 enzymes:[34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42]\n\nCYP1A2 (strongly) which metabolizes agomelatine, amitriptyline, caffeine, clomipramine, clozapine, duloxetine, haloperidol, imipramine, phenacetin, tacrine, tamoxifen, theophylline, olanzapine, etc.\n\nCYP3A4 (moderately) which metabolizes alprazolam, aripiprazole, clozapine, haloperidol, quetiapine, pimozide, ziprasidone, etc.[43]\n\nCYP2D6 (weakly) which metabolizes aripiprazole, chlorpromazine, clozapine, codeine, fluoxetine, haloperidol, olanzapine, oxycodone, paroxetine, perphenazine, pethidine, risperidone, sertraline, thioridazine, zuclopenthixol, etc.[44]\n\nCYP2C9 (moderately) which metabolizes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, phenytoin, sulfonylureas, etc.\n\nCYP2C19 (strongly) which metabolizes clonazepam, diazepam, phenytoin, etc.\n\nCYP2B6 (weakly) which metabolizes bupropion, cyclophosphamide, sertraline, tamoxifen, valproate, etc.\n\nBy so doing, fluvoxamine can increase serum concentration of the substrates of these enzymes.[34]\n\nThe plasma levels of oxidatively metabolized benzodiazepines (e.g., triazolam, midazolam, alprazolam and diazepam) are likely to be increased when co-administered with fluvoxamine. However the clearance of benzodiazepines metabolized by glucuronidation (e.g., lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam)[45][46] is unlikely to be affected by fluvoxamine.[47] It appears that benzodiazepines metabolized by nitro-reduction (clonazepam, nitrazepam) are unlikely to be affected by fluvoxamine.[48] Using fluvoxamine and alprazolam together can increase alprazolam plasma concentrations.[49] If alprazolam is coadministered with fluvoxamine, the initial alprazolam dose should be reduced to the lowest effective dose.[50][51]\n\nFluvoxamine and ramelteon coadministration is not indicated.[52][53]\n\nFluvoxamine has been observed to increase serum concentrations of mirtazapine, which is mainly metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, by 3- to 4-fold in humans.[54] Caution and adjustment of dosage as necessary are warranted when combining fluvoxamine and mirtazapine.[54]\n\nFluvoxamine seriously affects the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine and increases the intensity and duration of its effects. Because of the potentially hazardous consequences, the concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine, or other potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, should be avoided.[55]\n\nFluvoxamine’s interaction with St John’s wort can lead to increased serotonin levels and potentially lead to serotonin syndrome.[citation needed]\n\nPharmacology\n\nFluvoxamine is a potent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with around 100-fold affinity for the serotonin transporter over the norepinephrine transporter.[35] It has negligible affinity for the dopamine transporter or any other site, with the sole exception of the σ1 receptor.[59][60] It behaves as a potent agonist at this receptor and has the highest affinity (36 nM) of any SSRI for doing so.[59] This may contribute to its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects and may also afford it some efficacy in treating the cognitive symptoms of depression.[61] Unlike fluoxetine, fluvoxamine’s metabolites are inactive, without a significant effect on serotonin or norepinephrine uptake.[62]\n\nHistory\n\nFluvoxamine was developed by Kali-Duphar,[63] part of Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Belgium, now Abbott Laboratories, and introduced as Floxyfral in Switzerland in 1983.[63] It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1994, and introduced as Luvox in the US.[64] In India, it is available, among several other brands, as Uvox by Abbott.[65] It was one of the first SSRI antidepressants to be launched, and is prescribed in many countries to patients with major depression.[66] It was the first SSRI, a non-TCA drug, approved by the U.S. FDA specifically for the treatment of OCD.[67] At the end of 1995, more than ten million patients worldwide had been treated with fluvoxamine.[68][failed verification] Fluvoxamine was the first SSRI to be registered for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder in children by the FDA in 1997.[69] In Japan, fluvoxamine was the first SSRI to be approved for the treatment of depression in 1999[70][71] and was later in 2005 the first drug to be approved for the treatment of social anxiety disorder.[72] Fluvoxamine was the first SSRI approved for clinical use in the United Kingdom.[73]\n\nSociety and culture\n\nManufacturers include BayPharma, Synthon, and Teva, among others.[74]\n\nSYN\n\nSYN\n\nJ.

Fluvoxamine is used for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and anxiety disorders such as panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Fluvoxamine CR (controlled release) is approved to treat social anxiety disorder.\n\nFluvoxamine maleate and compounds were first disclosed in US patent 4,085,225. According to said patent, Fluvoxamine maleate prepared by alkylation reaction of 5-methoxy-4′-trifluoromethylvalerophenone oxime, compound of formula III with 2-chloroethylamine hydrochloride in dimethylformamide in the presence of a base such as potassium hydroxide powder for two days at 25°C.\n\nSubsequently the solvent is removed under vacuum then the residue is acidified and extracted with ether to remove the unreacted oxime followed by basification. The obtained fluvoxamine base in ether extract is washed with sodium bicarbonate solution. The fluvoxamine base is then treated with maleic acid in absolute ethanbl and the residue obtained by concentration under vacuum is recrystallized from acetonitrile to obtain fluvoxamine maleate. The process is very much tedious, time consuming as it requires two days for the reaction completion. Operations like removal of dimethylformamide, ether, ethanol makes process cumbersome at plant level. Requirement of\n\nvarious solvents lead the process to be non-eco-friendly. Moreover the patent is silent about yield and purity of the product.\n\nIn an alternate route described in US patent 4,085,225, the oxime of formula III is converted to formula I in a five step process i.e. alkylation of formula III with ethylene oxide. The reaction solvent is ethanol in which lithium is already dissolved. The reaction further involves addition of acetic acid to give the hydroxyethyl compound of formula A as oil. The compound of formula A is purified chromatographically over the silica gel, which is converted to a mesylate compound of formula B by treating with methanesulfonyl chloride and triethylamine at -5 to 0°C, then aminated with ammonia in methanol at 100°C using autoclave for 16 hours followed by removal of methanol and extraction in ether to give fluvoxamine base.\n\nThe base is then converted to the maleate salt formula I, which is finally purified by recrystallization from acetonitrile.\n\nThere are lots of disadvantages involve like more unit operations, use of various solvents and handling of ethylene oxide which is also known for its carcinogen effect. More unit operations lead to long occupancy of reactors in the plant as well as man power, high energy consumption and require bigger plant. These all parameters make the process commercially unviable as wel l as environmentally non-feasible. Further, purification of the compound of formula A requires cumbersome technique i.e chromatography over silica gel as well as lengthy work-up procedure in U.S. Pat. No. 4,085,225 requires complete removal of organic solvents at various stages.\n\nUS patent 6,433,225 discloses the process for preparing fluvoxamine maleate, prepared by alkylating 5-methoxy-4′-trtfluoromethylvalerophenone oxime, compound of formula III with 2-chloroethylamine hydrochloride in toluene and PEG-400 (polyethyleneglycol-400) as facilitator in the presence of a base potassium hydroxide powder at 30-35°C to obtain fluvoxamine base in\n\ntoluene layer is then treated with maleic acid in water. The precipitated fluvoxamine maleate is filtered and washed with toluene and dried. The obtained dried cake recrystallized with water to get fluvoxamine maleate. The process disclosed in the patent is silent about actual purity of the product. As per our scientist’s observation alkylation reaction at the temperature of 30-35°C may lead to non completion of reaction and results lower yield. Additional step of purification may further lead to loss of yield.\n\nThus, present invention fulfills the need of the art and provides an improved and industrially applicable process for preparation of fluvoxamine maleate, which provides fluvoxamine maleate in high purity and overall good yield.\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nStage – 1 : Preparation of (1E)-N-hydroxy-5-methoxy-1-(4-trifluoromethyI pheny 1) pentan-1-imine formula III\n\nTo a stirred solution of 5-methoxy- 1 -(4-trifluoromethylphenyl) pentan-1 -one ( 150 gm) in methanol (750 ml), sodium carbonate (granule) (72 gm) and hydroxylamine hydrochloride (59.64 gm) were added at temperature 25-30°C.

The mixture is stirred at 30-35° C. for 2 hours. Water (1.2 lit.) is then added, stirred for 30 mins. and the aqueous layer is separated out. The organic layer is washed with water (˜3×500 ml) until the washings are neutral. To the washed organic layer is added a solution of maleic acid (14.14 g, 0.363 mol.) in water (65 ml) and the mixture is stirred at 25-30° C. temperature for 2 hours, then cooled to 5-10° C. when the maleate salt crystallizes out. The crystallized fluvoxamine maleate is filtered, washed with toluene (200 ml) and sucked to dryness. The crude fluvoxamine maleate thus obtained is dissolved in water (300 ml) at 50-55° C. to get a clear solution, then gradually cooled to 5-8° C. and then further stirred at this temperature for 2 hours. The recrystallised fluvoxamine maleate is filtered, washed with chilled water (5° C., 100 ml) and sucked dry. The product is finally dried at 50-55° C. to constant weight. The fluvoxamine maleate obtained complies with the specifications of British Pharmacopoeia, 1999.EXAMPLE 2\n\nThis process when scaled up in pilot plant on 4.0 kg scale input of 5-methoxy-4′-trifluoromethylvalerophenone oxime gave 4.5 kg (71.2%) of fluvoxamine maleate, complying to the specifications of British Pharmacopoeia, 1999.\n\nSYN\n\nUS 4085225\n\nhttps://patents.google.com/patent/US4085225A/en\n\nEXAMPLE 15-Methoxy-4′-trifluoromethylvalerophenone O-(2-aminoethyl) oxime maleate (1:1).\n\n20.4 Mmol (5.3 g) of 5-methoxy-4′-trifluoromethylvalerophenone (melting point 43°-44° C), 20.5 mmol (3.1 g) of 2-aminooxyethylaminedihydrochloride and 10 ml of pyridine were refluxed for 15 hours in 20 ml of absolute ethanol. After evaporating the pyridine and the ethanol in vacuo, the residue was dissolved in water. This solution was washed with petroleum ether and 10 ml of 50% sodium hydroxide solution were then added. Then three extractions with 40 ml of ether were carried out. The ether extract was washed successively with 20 ml of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution and 20 ml of water. After drying on sodium sulphate, the ether layer was evaporated in vacuo. Toluene was then evaporated another three times (to remove the pyridine) and the oil thus obtained was dissolved in 15 ml of absolute ethanol. An equimolar quantity of maleic acid was added to said solution and the solution was then heated until a clear solution was obtained. The ethanol was then removed in vacuo and the residue was crystallized from 10 ml of acetonitrile at +5° C. After sucking off and washing with cold acetonitrile, it was dried in air. The melting point of the resulting title compound was 120°-121.5° C.\n\nSYN\n\nGB 1535226\n\nReferences\n\n^ Jump up to:a b Use During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\n\n^ Jump up to:a b c d e f “Product Information Luvox”.

analog of SARS-CoV-2\n\nTarget Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike glycoprotein\n\nCoronavirus disease – COVID-19\n\nThe Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine (pINN: tozinameran), sold under the brand name Comirnaty,[13] is a COVID-19 vaccine developed by the German company BioNTech in cooperation with Pfizer. It is both the first COVID-19 vaccine to be authorized by a stringent regulatory authority for emergency use[14][15] and the first cleared for regular use.[16]\n\nIt is given by intramuscular injection. It is an RNA vaccine composed of nucleoside-modified mRNA (modRNA) encoding a mutated form of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles.[17] The vaccination requires two doses given three weeks apart.[18][19][20] Its ability to prevent severe infection in children, pregnant women, or immunocompromised people is unknown, as is the duration of the immune effect it confers.[20][21][22] As of February 2021, it is one of two RNA vaccines being deployed against COVID‑19, the other being the Moderna COVID‑19 vaccine. A third mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, CVnCoV, is in late-stage testing.[23]\n\nTrials began in April 2020; by November, the vaccine had been tested on more than 40,000 people.[24] An interim analysis of study data showed a potential efficacy of over 90% in preventing infection within seven days of a second dose.[19][20] The most common side effects include mild to moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache.[25][26] As of December 2020, reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, have been very rare,[a] and no long-term complications have been reported.[28] Phase III clinical trials are ongoing: monitoring of the primary outcomes will continue until August 2021, while monitoring of the secondary outcomes will continue until January 2023.[18]\n\nIn December 2020, the United Kingdom was the first country to authorize the vaccine on an emergency basis,[28] soon followed by the United States, the European Union and several other countries globally.[29][30][6][31][32]\n\nBioNTech is the initial developer of the vaccine, and partnered with Pfizer for development, clinical research, overseeing the clinical trials, logistics, finances and for manufacturing worldwide with the exception of China.[33] The license to distribute and manufacture in China was purchased by Fosun, alongside its investment in BioNTech.[34][35] Distribution in Germany and Turkey is by BioNTech itself.[36] Pfizer indicated in November 2020, that 50 million doses could be available globally by the end of 2020, with about 1.3 billion doses in 2021.[20]\n\nPfizer has advanced purchase agreements of about US$3 billion for providing a licensed vaccine in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Peru, Singapore, and Mexico.[37][38] Distribution and storage of the vaccine is a logistics challenge because it needs to be stored at temperatures between −80 and −60 °C (−112 and −76 °F),[39] until five days before vaccination[38][39] when it can be stored at 2 to 8 °C (36 to 46 °F), and up to two hours at temperatures up to 25 °C (77 °F)[40][11] or 30 °C (86 °F).[41][42] In February 2021, Pfizer and BioNTech asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to update the emergency use authorization (EUA) to permit the vaccine to be stored at between −25 and −15 °C (−13 and 5 °F) for up to two weeks before use.[43]\n\nDevelopment and funding\n\nBefore COVID-19 vaccines, a vaccine for an infectious disease had never before been produced in less than several years, and no vaccine existed for preventing a coronavirus infection in humans.[44] After the COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019,[45] the development of BNT162b2 was initiated on 10 January 2020, when the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences were released by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention via GISAID,[46][47][48] triggering an urgent international response to prepare for an outbreak and hasten development of preventive vaccines.[49][50]\n\nIn January 2020, German biotech-company BioNTech started its program ‘Project Lightspeed’ to develop a vaccine against the new COVID‑19 virus based on its already established mRNA-technology.[24] Several variants of the vaccine were created in their laboratories in Mainz, and 20 of those were presented to experts of the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute in Langen.[51] Phase I / II Trials were started in Germany on 23 April 2020, and in the U.S. on 4 May 2020, with four vaccine candidates entering clinical testing. The Initial Pivotal Phase II / III Trial with the lead vaccine candidate ‘BNT162b2’ began in July. The Phase III results indicating a 95% effectiveness of the developed vaccine were published on 18 November 2020.[24]\n\nBioNTech received a US$135 million investment from Fosun in March 2020, in exchange for 1.58 million shares in BioNTech and the future development and marketing rights of BNT162b2 in China,[35] Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.[52]\n\nIn June 2020, BioNTech received €100 million (US$119 million) in financing from the European Commission and European Investment Bank.[53] In September 2020, the German government granted BioNTech €375 million (US$445 million) for its COVID‑19 vaccine development program.[54]\n\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla stated that he decided against taking funding from the US government’s Operation Warp Speed for the development of the vaccine “because I wanted to liberate our scientists [from] any bureaucracy that comes with having to give reports and agree how we are going to spend the money in parallel or together, etc.” Pfizer did enter into an agreement with the US for the eventual distribution of the vaccine, as with other countries.[55]\n\nClinical trials\n\nSee also: COVID-19 vaccine § Clinical trials started in 2020\n\nPreliminary results from Phase I–II clinical trials on BNT162b2, published in October 2020, indicated potential for its efficacy and safety.[17][56] During the same month, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) began a periodic review of BNT162b2.[57]\n\nThe study of BNT162b2 is a continuous-phase trial in Phase III as of November 2020.[18] It is a “randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate-selection, and efficacy study in healthy individuals”.[18] The early-stage research determined the safety and dose level for two vaccine candidates, with the trial expanding during mid-2020 to assess efficacy and safety of BNT162b2 in greater numbers of participants, reaching tens of thousands of people receiving test vaccinations in multiple countries in collaboration with Pfizer and Fosun.[20][35]\n\nThe Phase III trial assesses the safety, efficacy, tolerability, and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 at a mid-dose level (two injections separated by 21 days) in three age groups: 12–15 years, 16–55 years or above 55 years.[18] For approval in the EU, an overall vaccine efficacy of 95% was confirmed by the EMA.[58] The EMA clarified that the second dose should be administered three weeks after the first dose.[59]\n\nThe ongoing Phase III trial, which is scheduled to run from 2020 to 2022, is designed to assess the ability of BNT162b2 to prevent severe infection, as well as the duration of immune effect.[20][21][22]\n\nPfizer and BioNTech started a Phase II/III randomized control trial in healthy pregnant women 18 years of age and older (NCT04754594).[60] The study will evaluate 30 µg of BNT162b2 or placebo administered via intramuscular injection in 2 doses, 21 days apart. The Phase II portion of the study will include approximately 350 pregnant women randomized 1:1 to receive BNT162b2 or placebo at 27 to 34 weeks’ gestation. The Phase III portion of this study will assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 or placebo among pregnant women enrolled at 24 to 34 weeks’ gestation. Pfizer and BioNTech announced on 18 February 2021 that the first participants received their first dose in this trial.[61]\n\nVaccine technology\n\nSee also: RNA vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine § Technology platforms\n\nThe BioNTech technology for the BNT162b2 vaccine is based on use of nucleoside-modified mRNA (modRNA) which encodes part of the spike protein found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID‑19), triggering an immune response against infection by the virus protein.[62]\n\nThe vaccine candidate BNT162b2 was chosen as the most promising among three others with similar technology developed by BioNTech.[18][62][56] Prior to choosing BNT162b2, BioNTech and Pfizer had conducted Phase I trials on BNT162b1 in Germany and the United States, while Fosun performed a Phase I trial in China.[17][63] In these Phase I studies, BNT162b2 was shown to have a better safety profile than the other three BioNTech candidates.[63]\n\nSequence\n\nThe modRNA sequence of the vaccine is 4,284 nucleotides long.[64] It consists of a five-prime cap; a five prime untranslated region derived from the sequence of human alpha globin; a signal peptide (bases 55–102) and two proline substitutions (K986P and V987P, designated “2P”) that cause the spike to adopt a prefusion-stabilized conformation reducing the membrane fusion ability, increasing expression and stimulating neutralizing antibodies;[17][65] a codon-optimized gene of the full-length spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (bases 103–3879); followed by a three prime untranslated region (bases 3880–4174) combined from AES and mtRNR1 selected for increased protein expression and mRNA stability[66] and a poly(A) tail comprising 30 adenosine residues, a 10-nucleotide linker sequence, and 70 other adenosine residues (bases 4175–4284).[64] The sequence contains no uridine residues; they are replaced by 1-methyl-3′-pseudouridylyl.[64]\n\nComposition\n\nIn addition to the mRNA molecule, the vaccine contains the following inactive ingredients (excipients):[67][68][8]\n\nALC-0315, ((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate)\n\nALC-0159, 2-[(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide\n\n1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)\n\ncholesterol\n\ndibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate\n\nmonobasic potassium phosphate\n\npotassium chloride\n\nsodium chloride\n\nsucrose\n\nwater for injection\n\nThe first four of these are lipids. The lipids and modRNA together form nanoparticles. ALC-0159 is a polyethylene glycol conjugate (that is, a PEGylated lipid).[69]\n\nThe vaccine is supplied in a multidose vial as “a white to off-white, sterile, preservative-free, frozen suspension for intramuscular injection“.[11][12] It must be thawed to room temperature and diluted with normal saline before administration.[12]\n\nAuthorizations\n\nExpedited\n\nThe United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) gave the vaccine “rapid temporary regulatory approval to address significant public health issues such as a pandemic” on 2 December 2020, which it is permitted to do under the Medicines Act 1968.[70] It was the first COVID‑19 vaccine to be approved for national use after undergoing large scale trials,[71] and the first mRNA vaccine to be authorized for use in humans.[14][72] The United Kingdom thus became the first Western country to approve a COVID‑19 vaccine for national use,[73] although the decision to fast-track the vaccine was criticised by some experts.[74]\n\nOn 8 December 2020, Margaret “Maggie” Keenan, 90, from Fermanagh, became the first person to receive the vaccine.[75] In a notable example of museums documenting the pandemic, the vial and syringe used for that first dose were saved acquired by The Science Museum in London for its permanent collection.[76] By 20 December, 521,594 UK residents had received the vaccine as part of the national vaccination programme. 70% had been to people aged 80 or over.[77]\n\nAfter the United Kingdom, the following countries expedited processes to approve the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine for use: Argentina,[78] Australia,[79] Bahrain,[80] Canada,[7][81] Chile,[82] Costa Rica,[83] Ecuador,[82] Hong Kong,[84] Iraq,[85] Israel,[86] Jordan,[87] Kuwait,[88] Mexico,[89] Oman,[90] Panama,[91] the Philippines,[92] Qatar,[93] Saudi Arabia,[32][94] Singapore,[95][96] the United Arab Emirates,[97] and the United States.[10]\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) authorized it for emergency use.[98]\n\nIn the United States, an emergency use authorization (EUA) is “a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID‑19 pandemic”, according to the FDA.[99] Following an EUA issuance, BioNTech and Pfizer are expected to continue the Phase III clinical trial to finalize safety and efficacy data, leading to application for licensure (approval) of the vaccine in the United States.[99][100][101] The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) approved recommendations for vaccination of those aged 16 years or older.[102][103]\n\nStandard\n\nOn 19 December 2020, the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products (Swissmedic) approved the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine for regular use, two months after receiving the application, stating that the vaccine fully complied with the requirements of safety, efficacy and quality. This is the first authorization under a standard procedure.[1][104] On 23 December, a Lucerne resident, a 90-year-old woman, became the first person to receive the vaccine in Switzerland.[105] This marked the beginning of mass vaccination in continental Europe.[106]\n\nOn 21 December 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended granting conditional marketing authorization for the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine under the brand name Comirnaty.[2][107][108] The recommendation was accepted by the European Commission the same day.[107][109]\n\nOn February 23, 2021, the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency approved the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine under its standard marketing authorization procedure. It became the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive definitive registration rather than emergency use authorization in the country.[110]\n\nAdverse effects\n\nThe adverse effect profile of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine is similar to that of other adult vaccines.[20] During clinical trials, the side effects deemed very common[a] are (in order of frequency): pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle aches, chills, joint pain, and fever.[68] Fever is more common after the second dose.[68] These effects are predictable and to be expected, and it is particularly important that people be aware of this to prevent vaccine hesitancy.[111]\n\nSevere allergic reaction has been observed in approximately 11 cases per million doses of vaccine administered.[112][113] According to a report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 71% of those allergic reactions happened within 15 minutes of vaccination and mostly (81%) among people with a documented history of allergies or allergic reactions.[112] The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advised on 9 December 2020, that people who have a history of “significant” allergic reaction should not receive the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine.[114][115][116] On 12 December, the Canadian regulator followed suit, noting that: “Both individuals in the U.K. had a history of severe allergic reactions and carried adrenaline auto injectors. They both were treated and have recovered.”[67]\n\nOn 28 January 2021, the European Union published a COVID-19 vaccine safety update which found that “the benefits of Comirnaty in preventing COVID‑19 continue to outweigh any risks, and there are no recommended changes regarding the use the vaccine.”[113][117] No new side effects were identified.[113]\n\nManufacturing\n\nA doctor holding the Pfizer vaccine\n\nPfizer and BioNTech are manufacturing the vaccine in their own facilities in the United States and in Europe in a three-stage process. The first stage involves the molecular cloning of DNA plasmids that code for the spike protein by infusing them into Escherichia coli bacteria. In the United States, this stage is conducted at a small pilot plant in Chesterfield, Missouri[118] (near St. Louis). After four days of growth, the bacteria are killed and broken open, and the contents of their cells are purified over a week and a half to recover the desired DNA product. The DNA is stored in tiny bottles and frozen for shipment. Safely and quickly transporting the DNA at this stage is so important that Pfizer has used its company jet and helicopter to assist.[119]\n\nThe second stage is being conducted at plants in Andover, Massachusetts[120] in the United States, and in Germany. The DNA is used as a template to build the desired mRNA strands. Once the mRNA has been created and purified, it is frozen in plastic bags about the size of a large shopping bag, of which each can hold up to 5 to 10 million doses. The bags are placed on special racks on trucks which take them to the next plant.[119]\n\nThe third stage is being conducted at plants in Portage, Michigan[121] (near Kalamazoo) in the United States, and Puurs in Belgium. This stage involves combining the mRNA with lipid nanoparticles, then filling vials, boxing vials, and freezing them.[119] Croda International subsidiary Avanti Polar Lipids is providing the requisite lipids.[122] As of November 2020, the major bottleneck in the manufacturing process was combining mRNA with lipid nanoparticles.[119]\n\nIn February 2021, Pfizer revealed this entire sequence initially took about 110 days on average from start to finish, and that the company was making progress on reducing that number to 60 days.[123] Vaccine manufacturers normally take several years to optimize the process of making a particular vaccine for speed and cost-effectiveness before attempting large-scale production.[123] Due to the urgency presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, Pfizer began production immediately with the process by which the vaccine had been originally formulated in the laboratory, then started to identify ways to safely speed up and scale up that process.[123]\n\nBioNTech announced in September 2020 that it had signed an agreement to acquire from Novartis a manufacturing facility in Marburg, Germany, to expand their vaccine production capacity.[124] Once fully operational, the facility would produce up to 750 million doses per year, or over 60 million doses per month. The site will be the third BioNTech facility in Europe which currently produces the vaccine, while Pfizer operates at least four production sites in the United States and Europe.\n\nAdvance orders and logistics\n\nPfizer indicated in its 9 November press release that 50 million doses could be available by the end of 2020, with about 1.3 billion doses provided globally by 2021.[20] In February 2021, BioNTech announced it would increase production by more than 50% to manufacture two billion doses in 2021.[125]\n\nIn July 2020, the vaccine development program Operation Warp Speed placed an advance order of US$1.95 billion with Pfizer to manufacture 100 million doses of a COVID‑19 vaccine for use in the United States if the vaccine was shown to be safe and effective.[34][126][127][128] By mid-December 2020, Pfizer had agreements to supply 300 million doses to the European Union,[129] 120 million doses to Japan,[130] 40 million doses (10 million before 2021) to the United Kingdom,[22] 20 million doses to Canada,[131] an unspecified number of doses to Singapore,[132] and 34.4 million doses to Mexico.[133] Fosun also has agreements to supply 10 million doses to Hong Kong and Macau.[134] The Hong Kong government said it would receive its first batch of one million doses by the first quarter of 2021.[135]\n\nBioNTech and Fosun agreed to supply Mainland China with a batch of 100 million doses in 2021, subject to regulatory approval. The initial supply will be delivered from BioNTech’s production facilities in Germany.[136]\n\nThe vaccine is being delivered in vials that, once diluted, contain 2.25 ml of vaccine (0.45 ml frozen plus 1.8ml diluent).[101] According to the vial labels, each vial contains five 0.3 ml doses, however excess vaccine may be used for one, or possibly two, additional doses.[101][137] The use of low dead space syringes to obtain the additional doses is preferable, and partial doses within a vial should be discarded.[101][138] The Italian Medicines Agency officially authorized the use of excess doses remaining within single vials.[139] As of 8 January 2021, each vial contains six doses.[68][140][141][138] In the United States, vials will be counted as five doses when accompanied by regular syringes and as six doses when accompanied by low dead space syringes.[142]\n\nTemperature the Pfizer vaccine must be kept at to ensure effectiveness, roughly between −80 and −60 °C (−112 and −76 °F)\n\nLogistics in developing countries which have preorder agreements with Pfizer—such as Ecuador and Peru—remain unclear.[38] Even high-income countries have limited cold chain capacity for ultracold transport and storage of a vaccine that degrades within five days when thawed, and requires two shots three weeks apart.[38] The vaccine needs to be stored and transported at ultracold temperatures between −80 and −60 °C (−112 and −76 °F),[39][22][38][143][144] much lower than for the similar Moderna vaccine. The head of Indonesia‘s Bio Farma Honesti Basyir stated that purchasing the vaccine is out of the question for the world’s fourth-most populous country, given that it did not have the necessary cold chain capability. Similarly, India’s existing cold chain network can only handle temperatures between 2 and 8 °C (36 and 46 °F), far above the requirements of the vaccine.[145][146]\n\nIn January 2021, Pfizer and BioNTech offered to supply 50 million doses of COVID‑19 vaccine for health workers across Africa between March and the end of 2021, at a discounted price of US$10 per dose.[147]\n\nName\n\nBNT162b2 was the code name during development and testing,[17][148] tozinameran is the proposed international nonproprietary name (pINN),[149] and Comirnaty is the brand name.[1][2] According to BioNTech, the name Comirnaty “represents a combination of the terms COVID‑19, mRNA, community, and immunity.”[150][151]\n\nThe vaccine also has the common name “COVID‑19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified)”[2] and may be distributed in packaging with the name Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‑19 Vaccine.”[152]\n\nHow the Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine Works\n\nThe German company BioNTech partnered with Pfizer to develop and test a coronavirus vaccine known as BNT162b2, the generic name tozinameran or the brand name Comirnaty. A clinical trial demonstrated that the vaccine has an efficacy rate of 95 percent in preventing Covid-19.\n\nA Piece of the Coronavirus\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is studded with proteins that it uses to enter human cells. These so-called spike proteins make a tempting target for potential vaccines and treatments.\n\nSpikes\n\nSpike\n\nprotein\n\ngene\n\nCORONAVIRUS\n\nLike the Moderna vaccine, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is based on the virus’s genetic instructions for building the spike protein.\n\nmRNA Inside an Oily Shell\n\nThe vaccine uses messenger RNA, genetic material that our cells read to make proteins. The molecule — called mRNA for short — is fragile and would be chopped to pieces by our natural enzymes if it were injected directly into the body. To protect their vaccine, Pfizer and BioNTech wrap the mRNA in oily bubbles made of lipid nanoparticles.\n\nLipid nanoparticles\n\nsurrounding mRNA\n\nBecause of their fragility, the mRNA molecules will quickly fall apart at room temperature. Pfizer is building special containers with dry ice, thermal sensors and GPS trackers to ensure the vaccines can be transported at –94°F (–70°C) to stay viable.\n\nEntering a Cell\n\nAfter injection, the vaccine particles bump into cells and fuse to them, releasing mRNA. The cell’s molecules read its sequence and build spike proteins. The mRNA from the vaccine is eventually destroyed by the cell, leaving no permanent trace.\n\nVACCINE\n\nPARTICLES\n\nVACCINATED\n\nCELL\n\nSpike\n\nprotein\n\nmRNA\n\nTranslating mRNA\n\nThree spike\n\nproteins combine\n\nSpike\n\nCell\n\nnucleus\n\nSpikes\n\nand protein\n\nfragments\n\nDisplaying\n\nspike protein\n\nfragments\n\nProtruding\n\nspikes\n\nSome of the spike proteins form spikes that migrate to the surface of the cell and stick out their tips. The vaccinated cells also break up some of the proteins into fragments, which they present on their surface. These protruding spikes and spike protein fragments can then be recognized by the immune system.\n\nSpotting the Intruder\n\nWhen a vaccinated cell dies, the debris will contain many spike proteins and protein fragments, which can then be taken up by a type of immune cell called an antigen-presenting cell.\n\nDebris from\n\na dead cell\n\nEngulfing\n\na spike\n\nANTIGEN-\n\nPRESENTING\n\nCELL\n\nDigesting\n\nthe proteins\n\nPresenting a\n\nspike protein\n\nfragment\n\nHELPER\n\nT CELL\n\nThe cell presents fragments of the spike protein on its surface. When other cells called helper T cells detect these fragments, the helper T cells can raise the alarm and help marshal other immune cells to fight the infection.\n\nMaking Antibodies\n\nOther immune cells, called B cells, may bump into the coronavirus spikes on the surface of vaccinated cells, or free-floating spike protein fragments. A few of the B cells may be able to lock onto the spike proteins. If these B cells are then activated by helper T cells, they will start to proliferate and pour out antibodies that target the spike protein.\n\nHELPER\n\nT CELL\n\nActivating\n\nthe B cell\n\nMatching\n\nsurface proteins\n\nVACCINATED\n\nCELL\n\nB CELL\n\nSECRETED\n\nANTIBODIES\n\nStopping the Virus\n\nThe antibodies can latch onto coronavirus spikes, mark the virus for destruction and prevent infection by blocking the spikes from attaching to other cells.\n\nANTIBODIES\n\nVIRUS\n\nKilling Infected Cells\n\nThe antigen-presenting cells can also activate another type of immune cell called a killer T cell to seek out and destroy any coronavirus-infected cells that display the spike protein fragments on their surfaces.\n\nANTIGEN-PRESENTING CELL Presenting a spike protein fragment ACTIVATED KILLER T CELL INFECTED CELL Beginning to kill the infected cell\n\nRemembering the Virus\n\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine requires two injections, given 21 days apart, to prime the immune system well enough to fight off the coronavirus. But because the vaccine is so new, researchers don’t know how long its protection might last.\n\nFirst dose, 0.3ml\n\nSecond dose, 21 days later\n\nA preliminary study found that the vaccine seems to offer strong protection about 10 days after the first dose, compared with people taking a placebo:\n\nCumulative incidence of Covid-19 among clinical trial participants 2.5% 2.0 People taking a placebo\n\n1.5 1.0 Second dose First dose People taking the\n\nPfizer-BioNTech vaccine\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\nWeeks after the first dose\n\nIt’s possible that in the months after vaccination, the number of antibodies and killer T cells will drop. But the immune system also contains special cells called memory B cells and memory T cells that might retain information about the coronavirus for years or even decades.\n\nFor more about the vaccine, see Pfizer’s Covid Vaccine: 11 Things You Need to Know.\n\nPreparation and Injection\n\nEach vial of the vaccine contains 5 doses of 0.3 milliliters. The vaccine must be thawed before injection and diluted with saline. After dilution the vial must be used within six hours.\n\nA diluted vial of the vaccine at Royal Free Hospital in London.Jack Hill/Agence France-Presse\n\nReferences\n\n^ Jump up to:a b According to the British National Formulary and MedDRA conventions, side effects are “very common” when they occur in more than 1 in 10 instances; “common”, 1 in 100 to 1 in 10; “uncommon”, 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 100; “rare”, 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 1,000; and “very rare” when they occur in less than 1 in 10,000 instances.[27]\n\n^ Jump up to:a b c d “Swissmedic grants authorisation for the first COVID-19 vaccine in Switzerland”(Press release).
