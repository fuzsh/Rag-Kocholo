        "text": "Published 10-12-09\n\n***\n\nDugway sheep incident\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nDead sheep owned by Ray Peck in Skull Valley, 1968[1]\n\nThe Dugway sheep incident, also known as the Skull Valley sheep kill, was a 1968 sheep kill that has been connected to United States Army chemical and biological warfare programs at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. 6,000 sheep were killed on ranches near the base, and the popular explanation blamed Army testing of chemical weapons for the incident, though alternative explanations have been offered. A report first made public in 1998 was called the first documented admission from the Army that a nerve agent killed the sheep at Skull Valley.\n\nContents\n\n* 1 Background\n\n* 2 Incident\n\n* 3 Possible causes\n\n* 4 Aftermath\n\n* 5 See also\n\n* 6 References\n\n* 7 Further reading\n\n* 8 External links\n\nBackground\n\nSince its founding in 1941, much of the activity at Dugway Proving Ground is a closely guarded secret. Activities at Dugway included aerial nerve agent testing.[2] According to reports from New Scientist, Dugway was still producing small quantities of anthrax as late as 1998, 30 years after the United States renounced biological weapons.[3] There were at least 1,100 other chemical tests at Dugway during the time period of the Dugway sheep incident. In total, almost 500,000 pounds (230 metric tons) of nerve agent were dispersed during open-air tests.[2] There were also tests at Dugway with other weapons of mass destruction, including 328 open-air tests of biological weapons, 74 dirty bomb tests, and the equivalent of eight intentional meltdowns of nuclear reactors.[2]\n\nIncident\n\nIn the days preceding the Dugway sheep incident the United States Army at Dugway Proving Ground conducted at least three separate operations involving nerve agents.[4] All three operations occurred on March 13, 1968. One involved the test firing of a chemical artillery shell, another the burning of 160 U.S. gallons (600 L) of nerve agent in an open air pit and in the third a jet aircraft sprayed nerve agent in a target area about 27 miles (43 km) west of Skull Valley. It is the third event that is usually connected to the Skull Valley sheep kill.[4]\n\nThe incident log at Dugway Proving Ground indicated that the sheep incident began with a phone call on March 17, 1968 at 12:30 a.m. The director of the University of Utah’s ecological and epidemiological contract with Dugway, a Dr. Bode, phoned Keith Smart, the chief of the ecology and epidemiology branch at Dugway to report that 3,000 sheep were dead in the Skull Valley area. The initial report of the incident came to Bode from the manager of a Skull Valley livestock company.[5] The sheep were grazing in an area about 27 miles (43 km) from the proving ground; total sheep deaths of 6,000–6,400 were reported over the next several days as a result of the incident.[6] The Dugway Safety Office’s attempt to count the dead sheep compiled a total of 3,483.[7]\n\nPossible causes\n\nOne explanation in the aftermath of the incident was that a chemical or biological agent had escaped from the Dugway Proving Ground. Logic dictated that for 3,000 sheep to suffer a near instant death, an agent from Dugway would almost have to be involved.[5] Circumstantial evidence seemed to support this assertion, the United States Army admitted to conducting open-air tests with the nerve agent VX in the days preceding the sheep kill.[5] The Army also intimated that a spray nozzle had malfunctioned during the test causing an aircraft to continue spraying VX as it climbed to higher altitudes.[5][6] It was also reported that a small amount of VX was found in the tissue of the dead sheep.[6]\n\nOther information contradicted the initial assumptions about the cause of the incident. One contradiction to nerve agent exposure as a cause came in the symptoms of some of the sheep following the incident.[7] Several sheep, still alive, sat unmoving on the ground. The sheep refused to eat, but exhibited normal breathing patterns and showed signs of internal hemorrhaging.[7] Regular breathing and internal hemorrhaging are inconsistent with nerve agent exposure.[7] In addition, no other animals in the area, some much more susceptible to nerve agent poisoning, were affected.[5][7]\n\nAftermath\n\nThe incident had an impact on the Army, and U.S. military policy within a year. The international infamy of the incident contributed to President Richard Nixon’s decision to ban all open-air chemical weapon testing in 1969.[2] The sheep incident was one of the events which helped contribute to a rise in public sentiment against the U.S. Army Chemical Corps during and after the Vietnam War.[8] Ultimately, the Chemical Corps was disbanded for a short time as a result.[8]\n\nFollowing the incident, the Army and other state and federal agencies compiled reports, some of which were later characterized as studies .[4] A report which remained classified until 1978 and unreleased to the public until nearly 30 years after the incident was called the first documented admission by the Army that VX killed the sheep. In 1998, Jim Woolf, reporting for the The Salt Lake Tribune, made the content of the report public for the first time.[2] The report described the evidence that nerve agent was the cause of the sheep kill as incontrovertible. [4] The 1970 report, compiled by researchers at the U.S. Army’s Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland, stated that VX was found in both snow and grass samples recovered from the area three weeks after the sheep incident.\n\nThe report concluded that the quantity of VX originally present was sufficient to account for the death of the sheep. [4] Even after the report surfaced the Army maintained that it did not accept responsibility for the incident nor did they admit negligence.[2] As late as 1997, one year before the report went public, U.S. Department of Defense officials stated that the reason it (the report) was never published is because it wasn’t particularly revealing.

It was the largest pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum and employed over 300 workers, producing medicine both for human and veterinary use. The factory was used primarily for the manufacture of anti-malaria medicines and veterinary products.\n\nThe factory was destroyed in 1998 by a missile attack launched by the United States. It stated several reasons for its action:\n\n* Retaliation for previous attacks on U.S. embassies in several African countries.\n\n* The alleged use of the factory for the processing of VX nerve agent.\n\n* For alleged ties between the owners of the plant and the terrorist group al-Qaeda.\n\nThese justifications for the bombing were disputed by the owners of the plant, the Sudanese government, and members of the international community.\n\nContents\n\n* 1 Destruction\n\n* 2 Evidence\n\n* 3 Consequences\n\n* 4 Criticism\n\n* 5 Responsibility\n\n* 6 References\n\n* 7 External links\n\nDestruction\n\nOn August 20, 1998, the factory was destroyed in cruise missile strikes launched by the United States in retaliation for the August 7 truck bomb attacks on its embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya (see 1998 U.S. embassy bombings). The administration of President Bill Clinton justified the attacks, dubbed Operation Infinite Reach, on the grounds that the al-Shifa plant was involved with processing the deadly nerve agent VX, and had ties with the Islamist al-Qaeda group of Osama bin Laden, which was believed to be behind the embassy bombings and Operation Bojinka. The August 20 U.S. action also hit al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, to where bin Laden had moved following his May 1996 expulsion from Sudan.\n\nEvidence\n\nThe key piece of physical evidence linking the al-Shifa facility to production of chemical weapons was the discovery of EMPTA in a soil sample taken from the plant during a CIA clandestine operation. EMPTA, or O-Ethyl methylphosphonothioic acid, is classified as a Schedule 2B compound according to the Chemical Weapons Convention and is a VX precursor. Although several theoretical uses for EMPTA were postulated as well as several patented process using EMPTA, such as the manufacture of plastic, no known industrial uses of EMPTA were ever documented nor any products that contained EMPTA. It is, however, not banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention as originally claimed by the US government. Moreover, it does not necessarily follow from the presence of EMPTA near (but outside) the boundary of Al-Shifa that this was produced in the factory: EMPTA could have been stored in or transported near al-Shifa, instead of being produced by it, according to a report by Michael Barletta.[1]\n\nUnder-Secretary of State Thomas Pickering claimed to have sufficient evidence against Sudan, including contacts between officials at Al-Shifa plant and Iraqi chemical weapons experts, with the Iraq chemical weapons program the only one identified with using EMPTA for VX production. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), a Sudanese opposition in Cairo led by Mubarak Al-Mahdi, also insisted that the plant was producing ingredients for chemical weapons.[2] Former Clinton administration counter terrorism advisor Richard Clarke and former national security advisor Sandy Berger also noted the facilities alleged ties with the former Iraqi government. Clarke also cited Iraq’s $199,000 contract with al Shifa for veterinary medicine under the UN’s Oil for Food Program.\n\nOfficials later acknowledged, however, that the evidence that prompted President Clinton to order the missile strike on the Shifa plant was not as solid as first portrayed. Indeed, officials later said that there was no proof that the plant had been manufacturing or storing nerve gas, as initially suspected by the Americans, or had been linked to Osama bin Laden, who was a resident of Khartoum in the 1980s. [3]\n\nHowever, a Clinton State Department official had stated that a money manager for Bin Laden had claimed that Bin Laden had, indeed, invested in Al Shifa. And that the Al Shifa manager even lived in the same Sudan house Bin Laden himself had previously lived in.[4]\n\nThe U.S. State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research wrote a report in 1999 questioning the attack on the factory, suggesting that the connection to bin Laden was not accurate; James Risen reported in the New York Times: Now, the analysts renewed their doubts and told Assistant Secretary of State Phyllis Oakley that the C.I.A.’s evidence on which the attack was based was inadequate. Ms. Oakley asked them to double-check; perhaps there was some intelligence they had not yet seen. The answer came back quickly: There was no additional evidence. Ms. Oakley called a meeting of key aides and a consensus emerged: Contrary to what the Administration was saying, the case tying Al Shifa to Mr. bin Laden or to chemical weapons was weak. [5] The Chairman of El Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries, who is critical of the Sudanese government, more recently told reporters, I had inventories of every chemical and records of every employee’s history. There were no such [nerve gas] chemicals being made here. [6]\n\nNonetheless, Clinton’s Secretary of Defense William Cohen testified to the 9/11 Commission in 2004, characterizing Al Shifa as a WMD-related facility , which played a chemical weapons role such as to pose a risk that it, with the help of the Iraqi chemical weapons program connections he also testified to, might help Al Qaeda get chemical weapons technology.[7]\n\nSudan has since invited the U.S. to conduct chemical tests at the site for evidence to support its claim that the plant might have been a chemical weapons factory; so far, the U.S. has refused the invitation to investigate. Nevertheless, the U.S. has refused to officially apologize for the attacks, suggesting that some privately still suspect that chemical weapons activity existed there.[3]\n\nThe Khartoum attack was noted for its outstanding precision, as successive missiles all but leveled the Al-Shifa works with minimal damage to surrounding areas, although one person was killed and ten wounded in the attack.\n\nDirectly after the strike the Sudanese government demanded that the Security Council conduct an investigation of the site to determine if it had been used to produce chemical weapons or precursors. Such an investigation was from the start opposed by the US. Nor has USA ever let an independent laboratory analyze the sample allegedly containing EMPTA. Michael Barletta concludes that there is no evidence the al-Shifa factory was ever involved in production of chemical weapons, and it is known that many of the initial US allegations were wrong.[1]\n\nConsequences\n\nNoam Chomsky has argued that the bombing of Al-Shifa was a horrendous crime committed by the United States Government that resulted in the deaths of several hundreds of thousands of Sudanese people from treatable diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis because they were deprived of medicines manufactured at the plant. Insofar as such consequences ensued, we may compare the crime in Sudan to the assassination of Lumumba, which helped plunge the Congo into decades of slaughter, still continuing, or the overthrow of the democratic government of Guatemala in 1954, which led to 40 years of hideous atrocities; and all too many others like it. [8]\n\nGermany’s ambassador to Sudan from 1996 to 2000, Werner Daum, wrote an article in which he called several tens of thousands of deaths of Sudanese civilians caused by a medicine shortage a reasonable guess .[9] The regional director of the Near East Foundation, who had field experience in the Sudan, published in the Boston Globe another article with the same estimate.\n\nThese estimates were disputed by Keith Windschuttle and by Leo Casey, who said the figures were fabricated out of whole cloth .[10][11] Windschuttle claimed that Daum had done no research into the matter and that the reports of the Sudanese operations of the several Western aid agencies, including Oxfam, Médecins sans Frontières, and Norwegian People’s Aid, who have been operating in this region for decades, will not find any evidence of an unusual increase in the death toll at the time.\n\nThe factory was in fact a principal source of Sudan’s anti-malaria and veterinary drugs.[12] Human Rights Watch reported that the bombing had the unintended effect of stopping relief efforts aimed at supplying food to areas of Sudan gripped by famine caused by that country’s ongoing civil war. Many of these agencies had been wholly or partially manned by Americans who subsequently evacuated the country out of fear of retaliation spurred by negative responses by the Sudanese government. A letter by that agency to President Clinton stated many relief efforts have been postponed indefinitely, including a crucial one run by the U.S.-based International Rescue Committee where more than fifty southerners are dying daily .[13]\n\nCriticism\n\nOutspoken Clinton critic Christopher Hitchens wrote that the factory could not have been folded like a tent and spirited away in a day or so. And the United States has diplomatic relations with Sudan. … Well then, what was the hurry? … There is really only one possible answer to that question. Clinton needed to look ‘presidential’ for a day. [14]\n\nThe 9/11 Commission Report evaluated such so-called Wag the Dog theories (the strikes being motivated to deflect attention from domestic, political troubles), and found no reason to believe them, nor disbelieve the testimony and assertions of former President Clinton, former Vice President Gore, CIA Chief Tenet, nor former security advisors Berger and Clarke that the destruction of Al Shifa was still, as of 2004, a justifible national security target. Page 118\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department, under President George W. Bush, produced an alleged al-Qaeda defector as a witness on February 13, 2001, in its ongoing case against Osama Bin Laden. The witness, Jamal Ahmad al-Fadl, testified that Al Qaeda operatives he was involved with had been engaged in manufacturing chemical weapons in Khartoum, Sudan, around 1993 or 1994. Page 524\n\nAccording to The Guardian, The factory’s owner, Salah Idris, vigorously denied that he or the factory had any link with such weapons or any terrorist group. He is now suing the US government for £35 million after hiring experts to show that the plant made only medicines. Despite growing support for Idris’s case in the US and Britain, Washington refuses to retract any of its claims and is contesting the lawsuit. [15]\n\nThe Sudanese government wants the plant preserved in its destroyed condition as a reminder of the American attack and also offered an open door to the U.S. for chemical testing at the site, however, the U.S. refused the invitation. Sudan has asked the U.S. for an apology for the attack but the U.S. has refused on the grounds it has not ruled out the possibility the plant had some connection to chemical weapons development. [1]\n\nThe bombing of the al-Shifa factory resurfaced in the news in April, 2006, due to the firing of former CIA analyst Mary O’Neil McCarthy. McCarthy was against the bombing of the factory in 1998, and had written a formal letter of protest to President Clinton. According to former CIA analyst Michael Scheuer, she had voiced doubts that the factory had ties to al Qaeda or was producing chemical weapons. The New York Times reported: In the case of the Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, Sudan, her concerns may have been well-founded. Sudanese officials and the plant’s owner denied any connection to Al Qaeda. In the aftermath of the attack, the internal White House debate over whether the intelligence reports about the plant were accurate spilled into the press. Eventually, Clinton administration officials conceded that the hardest evidence used to justify striking the plant was a single soil sample that seemed to indicate the presence of a chemical used in making VX gas. [16]\n\nResponsibility\n\nThomas Joscelyn quotes Daniel Benjamin, a former NSC staffer: The report of the 9/11 Commission notes that the National Security staff reviewed the intelligence in April 2000 and concluded that the CIA’s assessment of its intelligence on bin Laden and al-Shifa had been valid; the memo to Clinton on this was cosigned by Richard Clarke and Mary McCarthy, the NSC senior director for intelligence programs, who opposed the bombing of al-Shifa in 1998. The report also notes that in their testimony before the commission, Al Gore, Sandy Berger, George Tenet, and Richard Clarke all stood by the decision to bomb al-Shifa. [2]\n\nFormer Secretary of Defense Cohen defended, in his testimony to the 9/11 Commission in 2004, along with other cited Clinton security cabinet members in their separate 9/11 Commission testimony, the decision to destroy Al Shifa.: At the time, the intelligence community at the highest level repeatedly assured us that it never gets better than this in terms of confidence in an intelligence conclusion regarding a hard target. There was a good reason for this confidence, including multiple, reinforcing elements of information ranging from links that the organization that built the facility had both with Bin Laden and with the leadership of the Iraqi chemical weapons program; extraordinary security when the facility was constructed; physical evidence from the site; and other information from HUMINT and technical sources. Given what we knew regarding terrorists’ interest in acquiring and using chemical weapons against Americans, and given the intelligence assessment provided us regarding the al-Shifa facility, I continue to believe that destroying it was the right decision.

Ralston in April 1958.[1][5] These ships were sunk by having Explosive Ordnance Demolition (EOD) teams open sea cocks on the ship after arrival at the disposal point.[1] The typical Liberty ship sank about three hours after the sea cocks were opened.[1]\n\nContents\n\n* 1 Operations\n\no 1.1 CHASE 1\n\no 1.2 CHASE 2\n\no 1.3 CHASE 3\n\no 1.4 CHASE 4\n\no 1.5 CHASE 5\n\no 1.6 CHASE 6\n\no 1.7 CHASE 7\n\no 1.8 CHASE 8\n\no 1.9 CHASE 9\n\no 1.10 CHASE 10\n\no 1.11 CHASE 11\n\no 1.12 CHASE 12\n\n* 2 Aftermath\n\n* 3 See also\n\n* 4 References\n\nOperations\n\nCHASE 1\n\nThe mothballed C-3 Liberty ship John F. Shafroth was taken from the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay and towed to the Concord Naval Weapons Station for stripping and loading.[1] A major fraction of the munitions in CHASE 1 was Bofors 40 mm gun ammunition from the Naval Ammunition Depot at Hastings, Nebraska.[1] CHASE 1 also included bombs, torpedo warheads, Naval mines, cartridges, projectiles, fuzes, detonators, boosters, overage UGM-27 Polaris motors, and a quantity of contaminated cake mix an Army court had ordered dumped at sea.[1] Shafroth was sunk 47 miles off San Francisco on 23 July 1964 with 9799 tons of munitions.[1]\n\nCHASE 2\n\nVillage was loaded with 7348 short tons of munitions at the Naval Weapons Station Earle and towed to a deep-water dump site on 17 September 1964.[1] There were three large and unexpected detonations five minutes after Village slipped beneath the surface.[1] An oil slick and some debris appeared on the surface.[1] The explosion registered on seismic equipment all over the world.[1] Inquiries were received regarding seismic activity off the east coast of the United States, and the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) expressed interest in measuring the differences between seismic shocks and underwater explosive detonations to detect underwater nuclear detonations then banned by treaty.[1]\n\nCHASE 3\n\nCoastal Mariner was loaded with 4040 short tons of munitions at the Naval Weapons Station Earle.[1] The munitions included 512 tons of actual explosives.[1] Four SOFAR bombs were packed in the explosives cargo hold with booster charges of 500 pounds of TNT to detonate the cargo at a depth of 1000 feet (300 meters). The United States Coast Guard issued a notice to mariners and the United States Department of Fish and Wildlife and the United States Bureau of Commercial Fisheries sent observers.[1] The explosives detonated seventeen seconds after Coastal Mariner slipped below the surface on 14 July 1965.[1] The detonation created a 600-foot (200 meter) water spout, but was not deep enough to be recorded on seismic instruments.[1]\n\nCHASE 4\n\nSantiago Iglesias was loaded with 8715 tons of munitions at the Naval Weapons Station Earle, rigged for detonation at 1000 feet (300 meters), and detonated 31 seconds after sinking on 16 September 1965.[1]\n\nCHASE 5\n\nIsaac Van Zandt was loaded with 8000 tons of munitions (including 400 tons of high explosives) at the Naval Base Kitsap and rigged for detonation at 4000 feet (1.2 kilometers).[1] On 23 May 1966 the tow cable parted en route to the planned disposal area.[1] Navy tugs USS Tatnuck (ATA-195) and USS Koka (ATA-185) recovered the tow within six hours, but the location of sinking was changed by the delay.[1]\n\nCHASE 6\n\nHorace Greeley was loaded at the Naval Weapons Station Earle, rigged for detonation at 4000 feet (1.2 kilometers), and detonated on 28 July 1966.[1]\n\nCHASE 7\n\nMichael J. Monahan was loaded with overage UGM-27 Polaris motors at the Naval Weapons Station Charleston and sunk without detonation on 30 April 1967.[1]\n\nCHASE 8\n\nThe first chemical weapons disposal via the program was in 1967 and designated CHASE 8. CHASE 8 disposed of mustard gas and GB-filled M-55 rockets.\n\nCHASE 9\n\nEric C. Gibson was sunk on 15 June 1967.[1]\n\nCHASE 10\n\nCHASE 10 dumped 3,000 tons of United States Army nerve agent filled rockets encased in concrete vaults.[2] Public controversy delayed CHASE 10 disposal until August 1970. Public awareness of operation CHASE 10 was increased by mass media reporting following delivery of information from the Pentagon to the office of U.S. Representative Richard McCarthy in 1969.[4] Both American television and print media followed the story with heavy coverage. In 1970, 58 separate reports were aired on the three major network news programs on NBC, ABC and CBS concerning Operation CHASE. Similarly, The New York Times included Operation CHASE coverage in 42 separate issues during 1970, 21 of those in the month of August.[4]\n\nCHASE 11\n\nCHASE 11 occurred in June 1968 and disposed of United States Army GB and VX, all sealed in tin containers.\n\nCHASE 12\n\nCHASE 12, in August 1968, again disposed of United States Army mustard agent and was numerically (although not chronologically) the final mission to dispose of chemical weapons.\n\nAftermath\n\nOperation CHASE was exposed to the public during a time when the Army was under increasing public criticism, especially the Army’s Chemical Corps.[3] CHASE was one of the incidents which led to the near-disbanding of the Chemical Corps in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Concerns were raised over the programs effect on the ocean environment as well as the risk of chemical weapons washing up on shore.[3] The concerns led to the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act in 1972, which prohibited future such missions.[2]\n\nSee also\n\n* Dugway sheep incident\n\nReferences\n\n1. ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y Kurak, Steve Operation Chase United States Naval Institute Proceedings September 1967 pp. 40-46\n\n2. ^ a b c d Pike, John.

GPI was a sub-installation of Dugway but had its own facilities, including utilities. Established in 1943, GPI was deactivated with the end of World War II.\n\nContents\n\n* 1 History\n\n* 2 Mission\n\no 2.1 Overview\n\no 2.2 Testing\n\n* 3 Facilities\n\n* 4 See also\n\n* 5 Notes\n\n* 6 References\n\nHistory\n\nIn October 1943, because of the limitations of a 2,000-acre (8.1 km2) site at Horn Island off the coast Mississippi a biological weapons testing site was established at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah.[1][2] Known as the Granite Peak Installation, the site was activated as the U.S. military’s principal bio-weapons testing site beginning in June 1944.[2][3][1] Construction on the massive facilities required by GPI began on July 10, 1944 and continued for seven months, finally ending on January 30, 1945.[2] The total cost for the development and construction of GPI was around $1.3 million.[4] When WWII ended in 1945 GPI was deactivated and closed.[5]\n\nMission\n\nOverview\n\nGPI was the U.S. bio-weapons program’s main testing site. Granite Peak was a sub-installation of Dugway Proving Ground and many of GPI’s administrative task were overseen by the post commander at Dugway.[1] Personnel stationed at the main Dugway grounds cooperated with tests at GPI. For example, air missions were flown by Dugway detachments, and weather forecast data was also provided by personnel at Dugway.[1] Despite the assistance from Dugway, GPI maintained control over all technical aspects of its operations and testing.[1] GPI was overseen by the Army Special Projects Division.[6]\n\nTesting\n\nOne weapon tested was a 91 pound bomb containing vegetable killer acid , known as VKA (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)[7][8] Testing of other munitions continued from 1943-1945, including tests using the causal agent for anthrax.[5] The M33 cluster bomb was used in a series of tests from August-October 1952 at GPI.[9] The Army Chemical Corps exposed over 11,000 guinea pigs to Brucella suis via air-dropped M33s.[9] The guinea pig trials caused one Chemical Corps general to remark, Now we know what to do if we ever go to war against guinea pigs [9]\n\nFacilities\n\nGPI was a 250-square-mile (650 km2) area of Dugway that was located 30 miles (48 km) from the nearest active area, known as Dog Area .[10] Because of this isolation the installation developed many of its own facilities, separate from the main facilities at Dugway.[10] GPI had its own utilities, laboratories, living quarters and medical facility.[10] By 1985 only two structures remained extant from the Granite Peak Installation, a pump house and an underground igloo storage building .[10]\n\nTransportation resources at GPI included an airplane landing strip and 22 miles (35 km) of surfaced roads.[2] Utilities at the site included, sewer and septic systems, power plants, and delivery systems for electricity, water and steam.[2] The base was much larger than the BW site at Horn Island.[2]\n\nSee also\n\n* Fort Detrick\n\n* Fort Terry\n\n* Horn Island Testing Station\n\n* Granite Peak\n\nNotes\n\n1. ^ a b c d e Pike, John E.

The purpose was to determine the dispersion and geographic range of biological or chemical agents.\n\nContents\n\n* 1 Earlier tests\n\n* 2 Operation\n\n* 3 Specific tests\n\n* 4 Scope\n\n* 5 Risks and issues\n\n* 6 See also\n\n* 7 References\n\n* 8 Further reading\n\nEarlier tests\n\nThere were tests that occurred prior to the first spraying affiliated with Operation LAC. The Army admitted to spraying in Minnesota locations from 1953 into the mid-1960s.[1]\n\nOperation\n\nOperation LAC was undertaken in 1957 and 1958 by the U.S. Army Chemical Corps.[2] Principally, the operation involved spraying large areas with zinc cadmium sulfide.[1] The U.S. Air Force loaned the Army a C-119, Flying Boxcar , and it was used to disperse zinc cadmium sulfide by the ton in the atmosphere over the United States.[3] The first test occurred on December 2, 1957 along a path from South Dakota to International Falls, Minnesota.[4]\n\nThe tests were designed to determine the dispersion and geographic range of biological or chemical agents.[3] Stations on the ground tracked the fluorescent zinc cadmium sulfide particles.[3] During the first test and subsequently, much of the material dispersed ended up being carried by winds into Canada.[4] However, as was the case in the first test, particles were detected up to 1,200 miles away from their drop point.[3][4] A typical flight line covering 400 miles would release 5,000 pounds of zinc cadmium sulfide and in fiscal year 1958 around 100 hours were spent in flight for LAC.[4] That flight time included four runs of various lengths, one of which was 1,400 miles.[4]\n\nSpecific tests\n\nThe December 2, 1957 test was incomplete due to a mass of cold air coming down from Canada.[4] It carried the particles from their drop point and then took a turn northeast, taking most of the particles into Canada with it. Military operators considered the test a partial success because some of the particles were detected 1,200 miles away, at a station in New York state.[4] A February 1958 test at Dugway Proving Ground ended similarly. Another Canadian air mass swept through and carried the particles into the Gulf of Mexico.[4] Two other tests, one along a path from Toledo, Ohio to Abilene, Texas, and another from Detroit, to Springfield, Illinois, to Goodland, Kansas, showed that agents dispersed through this aerial method could achieve widespread coverage when particles were detected on both sides of the flight paths.[4]\n\nScope\n\nAccording to Leonard A. Cole, an Army Chemical Corps document titled Summary of Major Events and Problems (1958) described the scope of Operation LAC. Cole stated that the document outlined that the tests were the largest ever undertaken by the Chemical Corps and that the test area stretched from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean, and from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.[4] Other sources describe the scope of LAC varyingly, examples include, Midwestern United States ,[3] and the states east of the Rockies .[1] Specific locations are mentioned as well. Some of those include: a path from South Dakota to Minneapolis, Minnesota,[2]Dugway Proving Ground, Corpus Christi, Texas, north-central Texas, and the San Francisco Bay area.[1]\n\nRisks and issues\n\nThough anecdotal evidence[1][5] exists of ZnCdS having adverse health effects as a result of LAC, a 1997 report refuted this. The U.S. National Research Council stated, in part, After an exhaustive, independent review requested by Congress, we have found no evidence that exposure to zinc cadmium sulfide at these levels could cause people to become sick. [6] Still, the use of ZnCdS remains controversial and critics such as Cole have accused the Army of literally using the country as an experimental laboratory .[7]\n\nSee also\n\n* Operation Dew\n\nReferences\n\n1. ^ a b c d e LeBaron, Wayne.

It was originally based in Lexington, Kentucky, housed on the rural campus of a prison-hospital called Narco, and run jointly with the Federal Bureau of Prisons.[1] It became part of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in 1974. It was relocated to Baltimore in 1979.[2]\n\nReferences\n\n1. ^ http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/112579635/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0\n\n2. ^ History of the Addiction Research Center\n\nStub icon This article about an organization in the United States is a stub.

The tests involved dispersing over 300,000 yellow fever mosquitoes from aircraft and through ground dispersal methods.\n\nContents\n\n* 1 Operation\n\n* 2 Results\n\n* 3 See also\n\n* 4 References\n\nOperation\n\nOperation Big Buzz occurred in May 1955 in the U.S. State of Georgia. The operation was a field test designed to determine the feasibility of producing, storing, loading into munitions, and dispersing from aircraft the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti).[1] The second goal of the operation was to determine whether the mosquitoes would survive their dispersion and seek meals on the ground.[1] Around 330,000 uninfected mosquitoes were dropped from aircraft in E14 bombs and dispersed from the ground. In total about one million female mosquitoes were bred for the testing,[2] remaining mosquitoes were used in munitions loading and storage tests.[1] Those mosquitoes that were air-dispersed were dropped from airplanes 91 meters above the ground, spreading out on their own and due to the wind.[1]\n\nResults\n\nMosquitoes were collected as far away as 610 meters from the release site.[1] They were also active in seeking blood meals from humans and guinea pigs.[1]\n\nSee also\n\n* Operation Big Itch\n\n* Operation Drop Kick\n\n* Operation May Day\n\nReferences\n\n1. ^ a b c d e f Rose, William H.

Blauer had no knowledge of the experiment being performed on him, and after his death the experiment was covered up by the state of New York, U.S. Government, and the CIA for 22 years.[1]\n\nContents\n\n* 1 Blauer’s treatment\n\n* 2 Death\n\n* 3 Malpractice lawsuit\n\n* 4 Case reopened\n\n* 5 See also\n\n* 6 References\n\nBlauer’s treatment\n\nBlauer was voluntarily admitted to the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) in December 1952 to be treated for depression following a divorce. Blauer was then taken from his room and told he would be receiving an injection. He demurred at first, but agreed reluctantly after being told it was a treatment for his depression.[2] After this and the next three injections, Blauer told medical staff that he did not want any more treatment because of the negative reactions he was experiencing. However, he was convinced after each injection to continue treatment after being threatened with commitment to a mental asylum.[3]\n\nIn reality, Blauer’s treatment was administered as a part of the top-secret army-funded Project Pelican, a part of Project MKULTRA. It was overseen by Dr. Paul H. Hoch, the director of experimental psychiatry at the NYSPI. Hoch secretly was collaborating with Dr. Amadeo Marrazzi, the chief of clinical research at the Army Chemical Corps. Fort Detrick’s Special Operations Division had made secret contacts with the NYSPI in order to develop biological weapons that could cause a range of effects from minor disablement to longer incapacitation and death. Blauer was unwittingly chosen as a test subject for one of these biological weapons.[4]\n\nDeath\n\nBlauer’s fifth injection was 16 times stronger than any of the previous ones. After receiving it, his body stiffened, his eyes rolled, and he frothed at the mouth while his teeth clenched for two hours. Finally, he collapsed in a coma and died. His death certificate cited his death as coronary arteriosclerosis; sudden death after intravenous injection of a mescaline derivative, caused by a preexisting heart condition.[2][3]\n\nMalpractice lawsuit\n\nBlauer’s ex-wife filed a lawsuit for medical malpractice against the state of New York. While conferences between attorneys were taking place between the NYSPI, state of New York, army, and Department of Justice, the army took Blauer’s medical records out of state to avoid discovery and hid them in a safe, despite a court order ordering their production. During the trial, numerous false statements were made by the defense, such as citing preexisting heart conditions as the reason for his death.\n\nThe malpractice claim was settled for $18,000, despite New York’s attorney claiming it was worth at least $60,000. $6000 was secretly reimbursed to the state of New York later by the U.S. Government.[3][1]\n\nCase reopened\n\nIn August 1975, the U.S. army contacted Blauer’s daughter, Elizabeth Barrett, and told her they had found Blauer’s case file locked in a safe. Barrett reopened the case, filing three consolidated lawsuits. The district court ruled that Blauer’s death was caused by the negligence of the United States, that the drugs given to Blauer had been inadequately tested in lab mice, and that the New York attorney had falsely claimed the drugs were from the Army Medical Corps to give the impression that they were a treatment for depression. On June 4 1987, the court entered a judgment against the United States for $702,044.00.[1]\n\nSee also\n\n* Project MKULTRA\n\nReferences\n\n1. ^ a b c Elizabeth Barrett, Individually and As Administratrix of Theestate of Harold Blauer, Deceased, Plaintiff, v.

He later said— I didn’t want to believe it. This was the Public Health Service. We didn’t do things like that. [1] In November 1966, he filed an official protest on ethical grounds with the Service’s Division of Venereal Diseases; this was rejected on the grounds that the Experiment was not yet complete. He filed another protest in November 1968; again, his concerns were ruled irrelevant.[3]\n\nIn 1972, Buxtun leaked information on the Tuskegee Experiment to Jean Heller of the Washington Star.

He embraced the concept of scientific medicine that was emerging among physicians at the turn of the twentieth century, which included a belief that insanity was the result of untreated infections in the body, and to treat them he directed his dental and medical staff to practice surgical bacteriology on the patients.[1]\n\nContents\n\n* 1 Career\n\no 1.1 Surgical removal\n\no 1.2 Exaggerated cure rates and honors\n\no 1.3 Investigation and controversy\n\no 1.4 Retirement\n\n* 2 References\n\n* 3 Further reading\n\n* 4 External links\n\nCareer\n\nHenry A. Cotton had studied in Europe under Emil Kraepelin and Alois Alzheimer, considered the pioneers of the day, and was a student of Dr. Adolf Meyer of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who dominated American psychiatry in the early 1900s. Based on the observation that patients with high fever often turn delusional or hallucinating, Meyer introduced the possibility of infections (then viewed as the cutting edge concept of scientific medicine) being a biological cause of behavioral abnormalities, in contrast to eugenic theories which emphasized heredity and to Freud’s theories of childhood traumas. Cotton would become the leading practitioner of the new approach in the United States.\n\nAfter becoming medical director of Trenton State Hospital at the remarkable age of only 30, Henry A. Cotton began to institute many progressive ideas, such as abolishing mechanical restraints that had created nightmare conditions in asylums for hundreds of years and implementing daily staff meetings to discuss patient care.\n\nSurgical removal\n\nCotton began to implement the emerging medical theory of infection-based psychological disorders by pulling patients’ teeth, as they were suspected of harboring infections. If this failed to cure a patient, he sought sources of infection in tonsils and sinuses and often a tonsillectomy was recommended as additional treatment. If a cure was not achieved after these procedures, other organs were suspected of harboring infection. Testicles, ovaries, gall bladders, stomachs, spleens, cervixes, and especially colons might be suspected as the focus of infection and removed surgically.[1]\n\nExaggerated cure rates and honors\n\nThis was before even rudimentary scientific methods such as control groups—much less double-blind experiments—existed, statistical methodology for applications in human behavior and medical research did not emerge during the lifetime of Cotton. He could only follow faulty methods to compile data, much of it allowing for projection of anticipated results. He reported wonderful success with his procedures, with cure rates of 85%; this, in conjunction with the feeling at the time that investigating such biological causes was the state of the art of medicine, brought him a great deal of attention, and worldwide praise. He was honored at medical institutions and associations in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe and asked to make presentations about his work and to share information with the others who practiced the same or similar methods. Patients, or their families, begged to be treated at Trenton, and those who could not, demanded that their own doctors treat them with these new wonder cures. The state acknowledged the savings in expenses to taxpayers from the new treatments and cures. In June 1922, the New York Times wrote in a review of Cotton’s published lectures:\n\nAt the State Hospital at Trenton, N.J., under the brilliant leadership of the medical director, Dr. Henry A. Cotton, there is on foot the most searching, aggressive, and profound scientific investigation that has yet been made of the whole field of mental and nervous disorders… there is hope, high hope… for the future.\n\nUnfortunately, in an era before antibiotics surgery resulted in a very high rate of postoperative morbidity and mortality, largely from postoperative infection. Among his patients at this time was Margaret Fisher, daughter of wealthy and famed Yale economist Irving Fisher, who believed in the hygienic movement of the period. Diagnosed by physicians in Bloomingdale Asylum as schizophrenic, which was untreatable until the modern development of some pharmaceutical agents, Fisher had his daughter transferred to Trenton, however, because Cotton attributed her condition to a marked retention of fecal matter in the cecal colon with marked enlargement of the colon in this area for which she was subjected to a series of colonic surgeries before dying of a streptococcal infection in 1919. The danger of surgery was recognized by some patients in the institution, who, despite their mental illness, developed a very rational fear of the surgical procedures, some resisting violently as they were forced into the operating theater in complete contradiction of what are now commonly accepted medical ethics. A paternalistic attitude and the permission of the family of seriously insane patients was the basis of intervention at the time.\n\nDifferences of professional opinion existed among psychiatrists regarding focal sepsis as a cause of psychosis and not all believed in the benefits of surgical intervention to achieve cures. Meyer, head of the most respected psychiatric clinic and training institution for psychiatrists in the United States, at Johns Hopkins University, accepted the theory. He was encouraged by a like-minded member of the state board of trustees who oversaw Trenton State Hospital to provide an independent professional review of the work of Cotton’s staff. Meyer commissioned another of his former students who practiced psychiatry on his staff at the Phipps Clinic, Dr. Phyllis Greenacre, to critique Cotton’s work. Her study began in the fall of 1924 just after Meyer visited the hospital and privately had expressed concern about the statistical methods being applied to provide an assessment of Cotton’s work. Cotton’s staff made no effort to facilitate the study.\n\nInvestigation and controversy\n\nFrom the outset, Greenacre’s reports were critical, with regard to both the hospital, which she felt was as unwholesome as the typical asylum, and Cotton, whom she found singularly peculiar . She realized that the appearance and behavior of almost all of the psychotic patients was disturbing to her because their teeth had been removed, making it difficult for them to eat or speak. Further reports cast serious doubt on Cotton’s reported results; she found the staff records to be chaotic and the data to be internally contradictory. In 1925 criticism of the hospital reached the New Jersey State Senate, which launched an investigation with testimony from unhappy former patients and employees of the hospital. Countering the criticism, the trustees of the hospital confirmed their confidence in the staff and director, and presented extensive professional praise of the hospital and the procedures followed under the direction of Cotton, whom they considered a pioneer. On September 24, 1925 the New York Times stated that, eminent physicians and surgeons testified that the New Jersey State Hospital for the Insane was the most progressive institution in the world for the care of the insane, and that the newer method of treating the insane by the removal of focal infection placed the institution in a unique position with respect to hospitals for the mentally ill and related accolades given in support of Henry A. Cotton by many professionals and politicians.\n\nFalling ill during the public hearing, some[who?] assert that Cotton suffered a nervous breakdown, diagnosed himself as suffering from several infected teeth, which he promptly had removed, pronounced himself cured, and returned to work. Soon Cotton opened a private hospital in Trenton which did a hugely lucrative business treating mentally ill members of rich families seeking the most modern treatments for their conditions. Meyer reassigned Greenacre without completing her report and resisted her efforts to complete the report. Admitting a shared belief in the possibility that focal sepsis might be the source of mental illness, Meyer never pressed his protege to confront the scientific analysis of the erroneous statistics the hospital staff provided to Cotton, his silence guaranteeing continuance of the practices. Later Cotton would occasionally admit to death rates as high as 30% in his published papers. It appears that the true death rates were closer to 45% and that Cotton never fully recognized the errors his staff made in analyzing his work.\n\nRetirement\n\nIn October 1930 Cotton was retired from the state hospital and was appointed medical director emeritus. Although this ended the abdominal surgeries which were so dangerous before the discovery of antibiotics, the hospital continued to adhere to Cotton’s humane treatment guidelines and, to carry out his less risky medical procedures until the late 1950s. Henry A. Cotton continued to direct the staff at Charles Hospital until his death.\n\nIn the early 1930s Cotton’s rate of postoperative mortality began to be a matter of professional debate in the state department of institutions by some concerned that he intended to press to resume his position at the state hospital. Another report on Cotton’s work was begun in 1932 by Emil Frankel. He noted that he had seen Greenacre’s report and agreed with it substantially, but his report also failed to be completed.\n\nHenry A. Cotton died suddenly of a heart attack in 1933 and was lauded in the New York Times and the local press, as well as international professional publications, for having been a pioneer seeking a better path for the treatment of the patients in mental hospitals.\n\nReferences\n\n1. ^ a b Ian Freckelton.

They are flowerless, vascular, terrestrial or epiphytic plants, with widely-branched, erect, prostrate or creeping stems, with small, simple, needle-like or scale-like leaves that cover the stem and branches thickly. The fertile leaves are arranged in cone-like strobili. Specialized leaves (sporophylls) bear reniform spore-cases (sporangia) in the axils, which contain spores of one kind only. These club-shaped capsules give the genus its name.\n\nLycopods reproduce sexually by spores. The plant has an underground sexual phase that produces gametes, and this alternates in the life cycle with the spore-producing plant. The prothallium developed from the spore is a subterranean mass of tissue of considerable size and bears both the male and female organs (antheridium and archegonia). However, it is more common that they are distributed vegetatively through above or below ground rhizomes.\n\nThere are approximately 950 species[citation needed], with 37 species widely distributed in temperate and tropical climates, though they are confined to mountains in the tropics.\n\nLycopodium powder\n\nThe term Lycopodium is also used to describe the yellowish, powdery spores of certain club mosses, especially Lycopodium clavatum, used in the past in fireworks, photographic flash powder, fingerprint powders, as a covering for pills and explosives. In physics experiments, the powder is also used to make sound-waves in air visible for observation and measurement, and to make a pattern of electrostatic charge visible. For example, Nicéphore Niépce used Lycopodium as fuel for a demonstration model of the first internal combustion engine, the Pyreolophore as early as 1807. Chester Carlson used lycopodium powder in his early experiments to demonstrate xerography.\n\nIt is also used as an ice cream stabilizer[citation needed].\n\nSpecies\n\n* Lycopodium aberdaricum (central and southern Africa)\n\n* Lycopodium alboffii (southernmost South America and the Falkland Islands)\n\n* Lycopodium alticola (southwest China)\n\n* Lycopodium annotinum (Interrupted Clubmoss; circumpolar north temperate)\n\n* Lycopodium assurgens (Brazil (Minas Gerais, Santa Catarina))\n\n* Lycopodium casuarinoides (southeast Asia (Japan to Bhutan and Borneo))\n\n* Lycopodium centrochinense (east Asia (central China to India and the Philippines)\n\n* Lypocodium cernuum creeping club moss (lowland mixed forest) — found along bush margins or disturbed ground; height approximately 400 mm\n\n* Lycopodium clavatum (Stag’s-horn Clubmoss; subcosmopolitan, see separate page for details)\n\n* Lycopodium confertum (southern South America and the Falkland Islands)\n\n* Lycopodium dendroideum (northern North America)\n\n* Lycopodium deuterodensum, tree club moss (eastern Australia, New Caledonia, New Zealand) — has appressed leaves; height approximately 600 mm\n\n* Lycopodium diaphanum (Tristan da Cunha)\n\n* Lycopodium dubium (cold temperate and subarctic Europe and Asia; treated as a synonym of L. annotinum by some authors)\n\n* Lycopodium fastigiatum (southeastern Australia, New Zealand)\n\n* Lycopodium gayanum (south-central Chile and adjacent westernmost Argentina)\n\n* Lycopodium hickeyi (northeastern North America)\n\n* Lycopodium hygrophilum (New Guinea)\n\n* Lycopodium interjectum (southwest China (Sichuan))\n\n* Lycopodium japonicum (eastern Asia (Japan west and south to India and Sri Lanka))\n\n* Lycopodium juniperoideum (northeast Asia (central Siberia southeast to Taiwan))\n\n* Lycopodium jussiaei (northern South America, Caribbean)\n\n* Lycopodium lagopus (circumpolar arctic and subarctic)\n\n* Lypocodium lucidulum, shining club moss (North America) — occurs in wet woods and among rocks; has no distinct strobili; bears its spore capsules at the bases of leaves scattered along the branches\n\n* Lycopodium magellanicum (South and Central America (Andes), southern Atlantic Ocean and southern Indian Ocean islands)\n\n* Lycopodium minchegense (southeast China (Fujian))\n\n* Lycopodium obscurum (northeast North America, northeast Asia)\n\n* Lycopodium paniculatum (southern South America (Andes))\n\n* Lycopodium papuanum (New Guinea)\n\n* Lycopodium pullei (New Guinea)\n\n* Lycopodium scariosum (southeastern Australia, New Zeal"
