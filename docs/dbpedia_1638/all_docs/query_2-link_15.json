        "text": "This page is no longer updated as frequently but serves to keep people with lupus informed on information about hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19. Make sure you also take a look at our FAQs answered by our Health Educators for overall health advice for people with lupus dealing with COVID-19.\n\nI am reading that hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) may help in fighting the coronavirus (COVID-19).\n\nAnswer: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) for the treatment of COVID-19. There have been several studies of hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19 and at this time the best available evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, and the potential benefits of the drug do not outweigh the known and potential risks. As a result, the FDA has revoked their earlier issue of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for hydroxychloroquine. An EUA allows for an unapproved drug to be prescribed in limited and controlled ways during an emergency such as a pandemic. The FDA has cautioned against the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 outside of a hospital or clinical trial.\n\nThere are three FDA-approved or authorized treatments for COVID-19.\n\nNirmatrelvir with Ritonavir (Paxlovid) is an antiviral pill meant for people aged 12 and older. It can be taken at home by mouth. It should be prescribed within 5 days of symptoms starting.\n\nRemdesivir (Veklury) is meant for children (over 12 years old and weighing at least 88 pounds) and adults. It is given through IV infusion over three days. If you are prescribed remdesivir, it is very important to tell your doctor what other prescription and non-prescription medications you are taking. People with lupus need to know that the studies reviewed by the FDA showed that remdesivir was less effective when used with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, both common lupus medications.\n\nMolnupiravir (Lagevrio) is meant for adults and can be taken at home by mouth. This antiviral should be prescribed within 5 days of when symptoms start.\n\nThe FDA approved Olumiant (baricitinib) and Actermra (tocilizumab), immune modulators, for certain adults hospitalized with COVID-19.\n\nI have been taken off hydroxychloroquine. Should I start taking it again?\n\nAnswer: You should not make any changes to your lupus medication or treatment plan unless directed by your lupus doctor. Your doctor knows your symptoms and health status best.\n\nIs there a shortage of hydroxychloroquine?\n\nAnswer: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reporting that the shortage of hydroxychloroquine has been resolved. It’s possible that people with lupus are still having trouble filling their prescriptions at this time.\n\nCan the use of hydroxychloroquine prevent coronavirus (COVID-19)?\n\nAnswer: No. There is no evidence that taking hydroxychloroquine is effective in preventing a person from contracting the coronavirus or developing COVID-19, so people who are not already taking this medication do not need to start it now. People with lupus should follow the guidance of their doctor and the safety guidelines being issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for people with compromised immune systems.\n\nHow can I get an extended supply of the medication?\n\nAnswer: Only your doctor can increase your prescription quantity. The amount you can receive at one time also will depend on the policies of your health insurance carrier or government-sponsored healthcare program (such as Medicare or Medicaid).\n\nWill insurance pay for an extended supply of hydroxychloroquine?\n\nAnswer: Reimbursement for extended supplies of a prescription drug will depend on the terms of your insurance coverage or the policies of government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Please contact your insurance carrier for details.\n\nAre there alternative medications I can use if I am still having trouble filling my hydroxychloroquine prescription?\n\nAnswer: Unfortunately, there are no good alternatives to hydroxychloroquine for people who need these medications. They are in a class by themselves and have the advantage of not being immunosuppressive. This is unlike many other therapies, including glucocorticoids like prednisone that increase the risk of infections of all kinds. Your doctor will know best what alternatives may be available for you. Please do not make any changes to what medicines you take or how you take them without talking to your doctor. For additional information on treatments used for lupus, see: www.lupus.org/understanding-lupus/treatment\n\nI am anxious that I will not be able to fill my prescription for hydroxychloroquine. Should I cut back on my dosage to make my prescription last longer?\n\nWe recommend you do not make any changes to your dosage amount without the approval of your prescribing doctor. Read more about filling your prescriptions during potential shortages.\n\nIs it true that hydroxychloroquine will keep working 45 days after I have stopped taking it?\n\nHydroxychloroquine is a longer-acting medication that can take several months to build up in the body and become effective. It can also take several weeks for the medication to “leave the body” or no longer be effective after you have stopped taking it. This is referred to as a medication’s half-life -- the length of time it takes for the medication to reduce to 50% concentration in the body.\n\nAlthough hydroxychloroquine has a longer half-life -- around 40-45 days – than many medications, it is most effective and safe at its prescribed dosage. It is important to continue the prescribed dosage unless your prescribing doctor says otherwise. Stopping usage and relying on the medication’s half-life could lead to lupus flares. If the regular dosage is eventually restarted, it will also require an extended period for it to be effective again.\n\nRead More"
