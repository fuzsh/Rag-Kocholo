The BBC and Channel 4 admitted that there were no new series to follow such programmes as One of ITV’s Telebugs Micro Live. All ITV has to offer is 7 'debugs, a cartoon series featuring four computer characters with human feelings. Viewers can now buy last year’s Channel 4 series So We Bought a Computer on video. It costs £49.93, with a special schools price of £29.95. A viewers’ guide with advice for beginners is also available for £1 from the Yorkshire Televi- sion Community Education Unit in Leeds. Superior accuse Gremlin of piracy By Steve Mansfield Superior Software is accusing the author of a Gremlin Graphics game of ripping off the best-selling Elite. According to Superior’s managing director, Richard Hanson, Gremlin’s Star Clash has an ‘uncanny’ resemblance to the classic game by Ian Bell and David Braben. He brought the matter to the attention of Gremlin’s boss, Ian Stewart, who immediately withdrew it from sale. The game had been selling for about 10 weeks at a price of £4.99, but Stewart was unwilling to say how many had been sold: The author of Star Clash , Julian Bushell, first offered the game to Superior, but it was turned down on the grounds that it was too similar to Elite. It lacks the trading element of Superior’s game, concentrating instead on galactic dogfighting, Elite: ‘uncanny’ resemblance but the graphics are very simi- lar indeed. According to Hanson, Star Clash has the same appearance as Elite - down the the 3-D radar map. The design of the spaceships is different, he said, but they use the same wire- frame graphics. Hanson even suggested that Star Clash con- tains whole sections of Elite machine code. A statement put out by Su- perior claimed that: ‘There is even a slight bug in the Star Clash program which is evident in Elite. Indeed, many of the machine code routines appear to have been copied verbatim from Elite.' Both companies are having trouble getting in touch with Bushell, who has just gone off to college. Stewart said he is ‘waiting to get the programmer up to Gremlin to grill him, to raise the points made by Super- ior’ before making a final deci- sion on whether to drop the game from its catalogue. ■ Richard Hanson confirmed that Ian Bell and David Braben are still working on a follow-up to Elite. It has actually been underway since the launch of Elite. Hanson said it was taking so long because the authors wanted to be as innovative as the original. That means it will be a totally new game, not a sequel, and so is unlikely to be called Elite 2. Music tutor wins schools design prize The traditional methods of learning to read music involve significant amounts of brow- beating and parrot-fashion rep- etition. Nicole Ballantyne de- cided to change that using a BBC micro and some over- sized notes, and her idea won her a major prize in a Design Council competition. Nicole, from the King Ed- ward VII School in Sheffield, was one of four winners in the 14 to 16-ycar old section of the Schools Design Prize. She won £200, with another £200 going to the school. Her invention is a giant music stave into which pupils plug wooden notes to form a tune. If they get the tune cor- rect it’s played on the computer attached to the board. The system works using small switches behind the holes in the stave, which are con- nected to the BBC micro. The whole thing was developed with the help of a local primary school in Sheffield.

AU l Security hints from famous ex-hacker Having helped start the craze for hacking, Hugo Cornwall is now giving advice on how to avoid having your invaluable data stolen. In his latest book, Datatheft , the author of The Hacker's Handbook has turned his atten- tion to the business and indust- rial community where data security needs to be tight, and all too often isn’t. The most successful pseudonym in the business points out that most breaches of security are not through hacking or sophisticated in- dustrial espionage, but simply a matter of wandering around an office picking up discs. The book is published by Heincmann, and is available in hardback at £14.95. More modems Two new modems have appeared at opposite ends of the market. Dataphone has gone for the home user with the Demon 2, which will sell for around £80, while Dacom is trying to attract bigger spen- ders with its high-speed 2424 MNP model, at £570. The Demon 2 handles the most common speeds of 300/ 300 and 1200/75 baud, and has both auto-dial and auto- answer. Software is available to make full use of these, and costs £19.95. The more sophisticated Dacom model works at 1200 and 2400 baud full duplex. That means that you can make full use of the high speed lines which are becoming available on services like Telecom Gold. The 2424 MNP modem also has sophisticated error correc- tion features, which may in- terest companies who want to transfer data between offices at high speed. ACORN USER JANUARY 1988 NEWS Arc music manuscript a piacere 3 mf [AU Hg / mf Swing Low Sweet Chariot Arc-style By Steve Mansfield. While many people are still wondering it they can afford an Archimedes, Philip Hazel of Cambridge University is actually using an Arc - to print music manuscripts. This is a tricky job, as music uses unusual symbols arranged over the page. Stave editors are available for many micros, but they’re limited, not least in the amount of music they can handle - which is why manu- scripts are usually done labor- iously by hand. Cambridge students, how- ever, can make use of Hazel’s system which produces high quality printout from music which is entered in a special text format. The software obviously needs processing power and memory. ‘The last time 1 looked, the program was over 130k long,’ Hazel said. The original program was written in BCPL on the 3216 second processor. Re- compiling on the Arc was ‘no problem,’ according to Hazel. ‘It’s one of the few things Acorn got right.’ As the whole point is to produce high quality output, Hazel uses a laser printer, the Apple LaserWriter, for the hard copy. However, any prin- ter which uses the Postscript page description language should work with the software. Using Postscript made life a lot easier for Hazel. Musical nota- tion is full of little lines and squiggles which would be te- dious, if not impossible, to do on a dot matrix printer. Post- script, however, has all the primitives built in to handle these kind of shapes. Hazel has no plans to market the software commercially just yet. But a professional musician is interested in the system for publishing editions. Mean- while, Cambridge students can continue to have the best look- ing manuscripts around. Silicon’s solid graphics Silicon Vision has improved its Real Time Graphics System (RTGS). The new version is called the Realtime Solids Mod- eller and, as its name suggests, you can now build and animate pictures of solid objects, in- stead of having the wire frame graphics of the RTGS. The software boasts colour - including dumps to colour printers - and full hidden line removal. It comes on a 32k ROM and six discs, providing 52 new star commands. Second processor and mouse versions of the software are available. Owners of the existing RTGS software can upgrade for £39.95, otherwise the package will cost you £89.95. The ori- ginal RTGS is still available, and the price was recently dropped to £49.95. News in brief ■ If you’re baffled by the Data Protection Act, which came into effect on November 11, you can get the Registrar to answer your problems in per- son at the Which Computer ? Show (National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, 19-22 January 1988). ■ Panasonic has just brought out its first 24-pin dot matrix printer, the KX-P1540. One of the printer’s more unusual features is that you can feed in sheet paper while tractor-fed continuous station- ery is still in the machine. Font cartridges are available, and a 13.5k buffer is fitted as stan- dard. The printer costs £665.

Nigel Thompson, who re- joices in the title of senior tutor of robotics at Bodelwyddan TVEI Centre, is aiming to change those preconceptions with a BBC micro connected to a knitting machine. He has worked with local firms and textile teachers to produce a system which allows students to design knitwear on The BBC micro is to play a key role in teaching schoolchildren the need for fire safety. Fire brigades all over Britain are being issued with software which will be used to explain what action should be taken in the event of a blaze. Called Project Vesta y the int- eractive program simulates a house fire in which the user has both to escape and lead others to safety. At each stage of the fire, pupils are presented with a set ACORN USER JANUARY 1988 a micro and then have the machine produce the garment. The student need not know a great deal about computers. A variety of existing art packages can be used at the design stage - which can hap- pen away from the machine. This means that the designing is not tied to one particular de- partment, subject area or even location. The designs can even be transmitted to the knitting machine by modem. Informa- tion about the system can be obtained from the Bodelwyd- dan TVEI Centre. of options. Make the right choice and the user survives to the next challenge. Make a mis- take and the consequences are spelt out. . . Project Vesta was launched as part of the Fire Safety Week, an event organised jointly by the Home Office and the De- partment of Education. Education minister Angela Rumbold said it was hoped that pupils in safety-conscious schools would grow to become safety-conscious adults. ■ It looks like the London firm Synchrotech will be the winners in the race to get the first Archimedes com- munications terminal on to the market. The terminal will be a full-featured viewdata and scrolling system, with support for popular auto- dialling modems such as the Designer Modem, Magic Modem, Apollo and Demon. A Hayes version will follow. The software contains a 300 number store, with service names, baud rates, and so on. Michael Spalter of Syn- chrotcch told me that after showing the software at the November Micro User show, he will be releasing the final version before Christmas. Sources tell me that the other contenders in the Arc- himedes terminal market aren’t quite as near as this. Interestingly, Michael says that unlike many others, he has found no problem with the RS423 interface on the Archimedes, and is quite willing to talk to people hav- ing problems through his Prestel mailbox: 011111860. ■ Regular comms watchers will know about the recent massive increase in Telecom Gold charges, and the bad feeling it has caused. Micro- link, the Database Publica- tions user group on Gold, has, for the last few months, delayed the introduction of these charges, but the issue was unresolved. Microlink recently issued a statement concerning a £1.3 million pound deal with Gold, whereby it moves on to a new Gold mainframe. This doesn’t make much differ- ence to the average user, but reading between the lines it looks like the old (ie, cheap) charging system is now going to remain intact. It seems that Database has managed to persuade Gold not to increase the charges for its customers, so why no fanfare of publicity over the fact that Microlink is the cheapest way of using Gold? A source close to the com- pany tells me that part of the agreement with Gold is that Database doesn’t make a song and dance about it, and upset all the big corporate customers who subscribe to Gold via British Telecom, and are of course paying the higher charges. ■ Matmos has announced a price cut to an amazing £169 for its Plessey T24 BABT- approved auto-dial auto- answer modem. With even the keenest-priced competi- tors like the Tandata TM722 and Pace Series 4 modem only a shade under £500, this seems like incredible value for money. The modem isn’t Hayes compatible, but is driveable from most BBC software packages. Matmos is on (0444) 414484. ■ Bulletin board spotlight Falling under our critical eye this month is the Dudley College of Technology data- base, run for the last couple of years by college staff member David King. The DCT viewdata board is rapidly gaining a reputa- tion as the source of material for owners of the Music 500/ 4000 and 5000 synthesisers. Much of the database is de- voted to Ample with a reg- ularly updated message sec- tion, hints, tips, tutorials, lists of other boards with Ample sections and most in- teresting of all, a large collec- tion of downloadable Ample telesoftware. Also for BBC users, there is general telesoftware and a collection of Econet utilities. A lively message section is maintained. The board is on Dudley (0384) 239944.

It’s possible that some soft- ware producers have been wait- ing for the release version of Arthur, the Arc’s operating system. Early machines had version 0.2, while most of the machines shipped recently had version 0.3. Acorn is offering to lend ver- sion 1.2 to software houses so that they can test their products before launching. However, Arc 440 machines have already been spotted running version 1.1, along with warnings about disc corruption. One company we know of was told that attempts to back-up the hard disc on to floppies could result in the floppies being corrupted. ■ Contex Computing has re- leased several titles for the Arc. The packages include Bank Manager Master at £25, Typing Tutor at £15, Business Utilities for £12 and Easy Reader and Madlibs at £12.50 each. ■ Dixon and Dixon, a firm of has adapted its farming accoun- tancy packages, the first being Farmcash. This covers book keeping, VAT on invoicing, budgets and stock control. Further titles will include Farmplanner and Fieldfile. Farmcash costs £230. ■ Raycomp has brought out an £8.50 spreadsheet. Known as the RC-Spreadsheet , the soft- ware needs a lot of memory and so is being aimed at the Arc market, although it will work on other BBC micro models with second processors or shadow memory. As well as being able to swap data files between the different machines, they can also be used with the database. ■ Philip Hazel, is selling a booklet of all the Arc’s machine code calls, including star commands and Osbyte calls. The booklet costs £1.10. Competition hots up for Unix on RISC There have been interesting de- velopments on the Unix and Olivetti front. It is widely be- lieved that Olivetti originally became interested in Acorn be- cause of RISC technology. Apart from owning 79 per cent of Acorn, Olivetti is in turn part owned by AT&T, the company which holds the rights to Unix. The Acorn RISC system is a logical machine to run Unix - it has the memory capacity and processing power - and Acorn is developing a Unix compati- ble operating system for it. What’s more, Acorn is keen for people to buy the chip to use in their own hardware packages. Acorn has referred to ‘an exciting. . .new series of Unix workstations’ in a press release. However, A&T has signed an agreement with Sun, a well- known company in the profes- sional graphics workstation market. Sun has developed its own RISC chip, and AT&T has chosen this ‘Sparc’ chip to use in a future Unix workstation. The two companies have also agreed to ensure their future versions of Unix are compati- ble. Xerox has also fallen into line with a similar undertaking. It remains to be seen how this will affect Acorn. farm management consultants, DISC TRANSFER SERVICE Acorn User is proud to announce another service to readers.

All you have to do is plan and create two pages of your own tabloid-sized national newspaper using a BBC micro. It will be run in three separate age groups, and editorial quali- ty will be as important as lay- out and design when it comes to the judging. Details of the competition were in the November 1987 issue of Acorn User. For current Archimedes owners, there’s the Artisan contest. Clares and Acorn User arc offering a box of discs to the person who draws the best picture each month, using Clares’ Artisan. The best pic- ture overall will be turned into a real painting by Jon War- misham, Clares’ artist-in- residence. Details were pub- lished in the December issue.

So why me, you could well ask. It could be that if you have four children, an extravagant wife and roughly 11,000 trout to contend with, a computer printer is the first thing you need. To start with the Citizen 120D Printer has a two year guarantee, twice as long as anybody else's. It's compatible with most PCs so I’d have to be extremely unlucky if it wasn't with mine. It also chugs along pretty quickly. But what really impresses me most is that I don't need a tool box to change draft to NLQ or American into English, all the switches controlling all the printer functions are easy to get at. If you think that's logical, I agree. It's just that most other printer manufacturers don't . The tractor feed also comes with the printer and another bonus is that it survived a Martian encounter with my four year old son, so it must be very sturdy. All said and done the price tag is very reasonable and I expect it to swim along happily counting fry ad infinitum'.' For more information call Citizen free of charge on Linkline 0800 282692.

If your BBC B micro does not have a DFS fitted then you will also require the Acorn dfs kit. These are available from Viglen. Stock Code Description Price inc.

VIGLEN ROM CARTRIDGE SYSTEM Having fitted the Viglen Rom cartridge system to your BBC, Master or Master COMPACT, you can plug in your Roms/ Eproms simply by inserting each one in a Viglen cartridge and plugging in whichever cartridge you want to use. The same Viglen cartridge can be used on all the micros mentioned and there is no need to switch the micro on and off between cartridge changes. The Viglen cartridge system for the BBC micro consists of the cartridge cable assembly and socket, blanking off plates, 1 cartridge and cartridge storage rack. The cartridge socket when fitted protrudes from the rectangular slot on the left of the keyboard where the cartridges are subsequently inserted. It is simple to fit and requires no soldering. The Viglen cartridge system for the Master and Master COMPACT simply plugs into your Master cartridge slot (or COMPACT expansion port) and accepts two Viglen cartridges. On the Master you can plug in up to two Viglen cartridge systems thus giving you access to 4 Viglen Cartridges simultaneously. The system comes complete with 2 cartridges and cartridge storage rack. On the Master you can also use Viglen cartridges which have 32 and 64K paged Roms inserted. Stock Code Description Price inc.
