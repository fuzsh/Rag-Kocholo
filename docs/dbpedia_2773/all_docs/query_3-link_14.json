        "text": "Retro-Bit has delivered some pretty impressive physical re-releases of classic games in recent years, including Gaiares, Mega Man: The Wily Wars and a selection of amazing Toaplan shmups.\n\nFor its latest trick, the company has inked a deal with rights holder Edia to republish the three Valis titles which launched on the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis back in the early '90s. These are Valis, Syd of Valis (Valis DS in Japan) and Valis III.\n\nWe were lucky enough to get an early production sample of the collection, which we're showing off in this gallery. Each comes in a plastic case complete with a reversible sleeve, full-colour instruction manual, art card and certificate of authenticity.\n\nYou also get a slipcase to hold all three titles and a acrylic display which showcases series protagonists Yuko, Cham, and Valna. The set costs $144.99 / €169.99 (the individual games are priced at $49.99 / €64.99 each), but the pre-order period has now ended – so if you fancy getting your hands on this collection, you'll need to keep your eyes peeled online for stock becoming available from independent retailers."
