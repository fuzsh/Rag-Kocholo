Recycled Media Recycled Materials Association (ReMA)\n\nMemo: Meet the 50 Industrial Transformation & Supply Chain Technology Startups REFASHIOND Ventures: The Industrial Transformation Fund has backed since September 2021 (#50StartupsIn50Days #REFASHIOND50) Startup: VALIS Count: 34 of 50 Brief Description: VALIS develops software tools for the metals recycling market. The company's products enable metals recyclers to maximize efficiency and output - by digitizing manual processes and automatically capturing data that previously required manual data capture with paper and pen. Investment Rationale: As demand for metals grows, geopolitics, political and social unrest, natural resource scarcity, and concerns about environmental sustainability are leading to increasingly frequent and unpredictable disruptions to external, international supply chains for virgin metals. This is leading to greater interest and investment in developing internal metals recycling supply chains and markets as a complement to international supply chains and markets for both virgin and recycled metals. #ObsessivelyEnthusiasticInvestor #UnreasonablyEnthusiasticInvestor We look for the people we believe are doing the best work in Industrial Transformation & Supply Chain Technology; Attempting the impossible. Then we go all-in on them. With OBSESSIVE and UNREASONABLE ENTHUSIASM. Our Investment Thesis: REFASHIOND Ventures: The Industrial Transformation Fund invests in early stage startups refashioning legacy industries through Data & AI, Advanced Materials, Advanced Manufacturing, & Next Generation Supply Chains; Defensible through economic moats.
