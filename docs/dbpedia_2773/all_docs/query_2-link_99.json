        "text": "Valis X: Cham - Arata naru Senyū is the fourth chapter of the episodic Valis X .\n\nThe common story of the five episodes of Valis X is based on the events depicted in various installments of the Valis series, describing the adventures of a Japanese teenage girl Yuko Asou and her friends in a parallel world named Vecanti, where she fights its evil tyrants with the legendary sword of Valis. However, the episodes do not follow the plots of the individual games; rather, they tell the over-arching story of the entire series their own way, liberally mixing locations, characters, events, etc., and adding new sub-plots.\n\nThe first four chapters describe the same events from the point of view of four different characters; the final episode concludes the story.\n\nThe heroine of the fourth episode is Cham, a cute elf-like warrior, native of Vecanti. Cham was already active in the story during the first three episodes, but this time, the player can see the events through her eyes and understand her motivations better. Beside the old scenes shown through Cham's perspective, there are also new ones, mainly depicting Cham's relationships with other local warriors.\n\nAll the episodes have the same graphical style and identical gameplay system. Unlike the original Valis series, the episodes of Valis X are \"visual novels\", composed of text and still images; interactivity is confined to occasionally making a decision, which will slightly alter the following events (usually of sexual nature), without influencing the general story.\n\nAll the episodes of Valis X have large amounts of explicit sex scenes, mostly revolving around lesbian sex and depictions of the heroines being raped by tentacle monsters."
