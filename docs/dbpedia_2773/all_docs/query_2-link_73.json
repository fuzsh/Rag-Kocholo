        "text": "First published in 1967, Lupin The Third is one of Japan’s most prolific pop culture icons and international exports. Conceived as a spiritual descendant of French literary thief, Arsène Lupin, and created by the amusingly named Japanese comic artist Monkey Punch, Lupin The Third started life in the pages of a weekly comic but soon became so popular he appeared in hundreds of episodes of TV anime, scores of films spanning both live action and animation and, of course, several videogames.\n\nIn the West he is best known for the 1979 animated movie, The Castle Of Cagliostro, written and directed by Studio Ghibli’s Hayao Miyazaki, which features the director’s high watermark of visual storytelling and is so popular it has remained widely available for decades. But there are so many more movies that have gone in and out of print over the years. Eleven of these were released theatrically, while six more were released straight to video. More astonishing is the annual tradition of Lupin’s television specials, of which a staggering 27 aired between 1989 and 2019.\n\nWhat explains Lupin’s 55-year popularity streak? I can only offer my personal opinion but outside of the fun tone of his adventures, I’d have to credit the consistency of vision that has lasted the decades, as well as a great cast of ever-present characters. On every adventure, Lupin is joined by his faithful partner in crime, Jigen; the stoic samurai Goemon; and Fujiko, the hero’s unrequited object of desire, who is more rival thief than ally, and always seems one step ahead of the rest of the gang. The cast is rounded out by Inspector Zenigata, a dogmatic cop who is obsessed with catching Lupin but is rarely the bad guy. There’s usually a much greater, meaner, villain in the mix, making Zenigata more of a loveable antagonist.\n\nIt’s the interplay between these five characters that makes Lupin The Third so much fun, not least because of a certain unspoken affection that seems to exist between them all. The more you watch, the more it starts to feel like a band getting back together or the cast of a long-running sitcom, so familiar with one another that the chemistry between them can never break.\n\nFor me, the Lupin series holds a similar appeal to other decades-spanning film series, like James Bond or Godzilla. Detractors of these pop culture monoliths might accuse them of all being the same, but I think that’s part of the fun. Like those films, Lupin The Third has a consistent set of ingredients – the cast, the car chases, wacky disguises, heists and humour – that you can always rely on. Yes, the series will move with the times and with fashions to a certain extent, but there’s a sense of familiar tradition that you can always look forward to. Seeing how the animators play with this tradition, honouring it while finding new twists, is a big reason for Lupin’s enduring popularity.\n\nSo, what of Lupin’s videogame history? 25 distinct games were produced between 1980 and 2010, and while there’s no one game that stands out in the way Castle Of Cagliostro does for movies, there is a surprising level of variety to be found. Yes there’s a little bit of licensed shovelware, and quite a few games that recycle animation from TV and film, but deep in Lupin’s videogame vault, you will find at least a couple of interesting trinkets.\n\nSo, because I occasionally like to get obsessive about such things, I recently decided to play as many Lupin games as I could get my hands on and summarise them here. I don’t expect you to read all the way through this, but feel free to flit around and read up on the games that interest you the most. For the time strapped reader, I’ve included a short summary for each, indicating whether it’s worth playing or not. While for the cast strapped reader, I’ve also indicated if the game is worth stealing. Hopefully it’s clear this is a tongue-in-cheek joke in keeping with Lupin’s gentleman thief persona. Please don’t go dobbing me in to the ESA!\n\nLUPIN THE THIRD\n\nYear: 1980 | Format: Arcade, Fujitsu FM-7, Sharp X1 | Developer: Taito | Jacket: Yellow\n\nThe very first Lupin game is very much a product of its time. A simple maze game, released just one month before Pac-Man, it sees Lupin doing what he does best… Stealing big bags of money and hightailing it from the cops! The aim is to navigate the maze; pick-up the loot bags from the top of the screen and then safely deposit them at the vault in the bottom without getting caught. Most of the gameplay is your standard avoid-‘em-up, but you can spend energy to teleport Lupin out of trouble when he’s cornered. You can also choose to carry two bags at once, but the weight will considerably slow you down. As the game progresses, the number of guards and dogs will increase, so judicious use of these simple gameplay mechanics is essential to avoid capture.\n\nDespite the official license, there’s not much here to connect the game with the world of the anime, outside of the thievery theme. Lupin wears a cape for some reason, and none of his friends are anywhere to be seen. Maybe one of the pursuing cops is Inspector Zenigata but, if so, it’s not explicit. There is a loose sense of a story though, with animated cut-scenes both at the start and during a “game over”. Pac-Man is notable for the very brief cinematics that played between stages but I feel Lupin The Third goes much further. The intro cinematic where Lupin descends from a helicopter, and the capture sequence, in which he’s escorted off to jail, really lend weight to the idea that you’re playing a character driven action game.\n\nInterestingly, there were also two home ports to Japanese computers, the Fujitsu FM-7 and Sharp MZ-80K, though it’s unknown if these were officially licensed conversions. If anything, these versions are even more primitive, with no character graphics. Lupin is represented by a club symbol, the guards by the letter M and the money bags, appropriately enough by dollar signs.\n\nFor decades, this seminal Lupin game has remained obscure and unavailable, but in 2022 it finally received its first official re-release as part of the Taito Egret II Mini. Deluxe versions of the mini console even come with little cardboard marquees, so you can display the original Lupin art as you play.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? Yes! This may not be the most authentic Lupin game but it’s a great piece of Taito history.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? No! Play it on the excellent Taito Egret II Mini. It’s probably the best mini console around and is packed full of awesome arcade games.\n\nCLIFF HANGER\n\nYear: 1983 | Format: Arcade | Developer: Stern Electronics | Jacket: Green/Red\n\nAt the peak of the Laserdisc game boom, Stern Electronics had the smart idea of licensing Lupin movie footage in order to create their Dragon’s Lair competitor, which must have been way more economical than paying Don Bluth to basically animate a whole film.\n\nThough completely rebranded as Cliff Hanger – Lupin’s actual character name in the game – the footage is unmistakable. Almost all of it comes from Miyazaki’s The Castle Of Cagliostro, save for one chase sequence lifted from the very first Lupin film, The Mystery Of Mamo.\n\nThe jump between one movie and another is jarring, not just because the story doesn’t at all line up but also because the art and animation are noticeably different. Lupin’s trademark jacket even changes from green to red, and back to green again. But you have to admit, the action-packed footage, boasting fistfights, athletic rooftop jumps and crazy car chases, is perfect for a laserdisc game.\n\nThe controls, comprising a four-way joystick and two action buttons, one for Lupin’s hands and another for his feet, do a reasonable job of putting you square in the action but, ultimately, this is still a laserdisc game with the same old flaws. The contextual action is satisfying when it clicks but feels like a repetitive memory test when it doesn’t.\n\nOne downside of the pre-existing footage is that you don’t get all those bespoke death animations that made Dragon’s Lair so fun to fail, so when you miss a cue or get the input wrong you have to make do with one of a handful of clips that soon become tiresome. Stranger still is the decision to cap every fail animation off with a haunting clip that shows Lupin being hanged. Given how often you lose in a game like this, you’re going to see that swinging cadaver so often, it becomes a real downer. Thankfully, Stern seemed to realise this might not go down so well in certain arcades and included a dip-switch to turn this particular animation off.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? Maybe! If you like Laserdisc games then this is a quirky example of the genre. If not, just watch the films from which the footage comes.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? Definitely! There’s no official way to buy this game, unless you find the rare and expensive arcade cab, so emulation is the way to go.\n\nLUPIN III\n\nYear: 1984 | Format: Epoch Super Cassette Vision | Developer: Epoch | Jacket: Pink\n\nIn this collection of obscure licensed games, the third Lupin the Third game is perhaps the most obscure of all, as it was released exclusively on the Epoch Super Cassette Vision, a console so niche, I had to buy one just to test the game for this article.\n\nSpending as little money as possible, I managed to get the most beat up and cruddy Super Cassette Vision you can imagine. The front panel that houses the attached controllers was completely gone, one controller has a dodgy fire button and it didn’t come with the RGB scart lead, so I had to use my MSX Scart, which isn’t correctly wired to output the console’s mono sound. And yet… I’ve had a pretty great time with this game!\n\nIt’s easy to see why the Super Casette Vision was overshadowed by the Famicom and wiped out with just 30 games released. The visuals are so blocky and primitive by comparison, but nearly 40 years later they hold a certain charm. Feeling somewhere between an Atari 2600 and a ColecoVision, the sprites are chunky, bold and startlingly colourful. Perfect for a cartoon adaptation. I love the gangly design of the Lupin and Zenigata sprites and their expressive animations do a great job of capturing the spirit of the anime in a Lego-like form.\n\nThe game itself is reminiscent of Pitfall, though much simpler, and sees Lupin run through a series of underground passages, including sewers and caves, collecting treasure and avoiding danger from all angles. On each stage he’s pursued from behind (I love the crocodile on the first stage) while animals like bats and snakes approach from the front. To get to the end of each stage, you’ll need to deftly run, jump, crouch and punch to survive without taking a hit. The challenge and variation is good enough that, even today, it doesn’t really get boring and requires a certain amount of skill and cunning to overcome.\n\nAs a big fan of Zenigata, I’m happy to see him take a prominent role in this game. As you run through the tunnels, the inspector’s police car will speed on overhead and when you eventually catch it up, you’ll see Zenigata and one of his police chums poised to drop a wooden log down a hole to try to stop you. Zenigata’s static pose, with one leg bent at the knee and raised to his chest, perfectly captures the character. It’s easy to imagine him thinking, “I’ve got you this time, Lupin!” and if you do get caught out and fall over, he’ll giddly come running up the tunnel to arrest you. I can’t help but be happy for him!\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? Yes! This one has a nice Lupin feeling to it and is a fun game to play for a few minutes.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? If you don’t already own a Super Cassette Vision, yes. The cart is expensive and there aren’t that many great games on the console, so it’s not really worth going to all the trouble just for this game.\n\nLUPIN THE 3RD: THE CASTLE OF CAGLIOSTRO\n\nYear: 1985 | Format: Fujitstu FM-7, PC-88, Sharp X1 | Developer: Toho | Jacket: Green\n\nMovie footage-reusing laserdisc game aside, this is the first Lupin videogame that really feels like it’s adapting a specific story. In this case, the beloved Hayao Miyazaki movie from 1979. Unfortunately, this intriguing adventure-RPG hybrid was only ever released on Japanese computers and is controlled via text input, so even if you do manage to get it working on original hardware or emulation (both a challenge) it will be largely unplayable without language skills. Which is a real shame because it looks like a rich and engrossing game for the era. At the very least we can enjoy the sumptuous dot-by-dot pixel art that was so distinct to Japanese computer games. Some of the screens are so beautiful, I used one for the lead image of this article!\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? If you’re Japanese and the year is 1985, yes!\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? Given how much of a pain emulation is, and how impenetrable the game is, I wouldn’t bother.\n\nLUPIN THE 3RD: THE CASTLE OF CAGLIOSTRO\n\nYear: 1987 | Format: MSX | Developer: Toho | Jacket: Green\n\nThe second Castle Of Cagliostro adaptation for Japanese computers is much more import friendly, though may be slightly less faithful to the source material. This adventure-platformer picks up the film’s story from the moment Lupin enters the titular castle, which means you don’t get a casino escape, a car chase or even any rooftop derring-do, but you do get seven unique stages, each depicting a distinct area of the castle.\n\nGiven Hayao Miyazaki’s distaste for videogames, you’d think he’d been burned by previous adaptations, but this early example is actually pretty good for the era. The visuals are decent by the standards of Japanese microcomputers, and the expressive animations actually do a good job of capturing specific moments from the movie. Jump and strike with a sword and Lupin will comically thrust his bum out behind him. Leap into a stretch of falling water and he’ll desperately try to swim up it!\n\nThe clever little nods to the film persist. Sometimes in big ways, like the iconic clock face climax. Other times in ways that add a smart mechanic, like the unusual health system, which sees you collect cup noodles in order to fill a secondary yellow meter and then find a kettle to convert that meter into health, effectively boiling the noodles. I love it!\n\nAs well as the platforming and combat, there are some soft puzzle elements required to clear each stage. We’re not talking Maze Of Galious levels of obscurity but you’d probably benefit from a guide all the same. Each stage exit is unlocked by two hidden signet rings, while certain areas can only be reached by finding and using Lupin’s zipline. At times you’ll need to find secret areas by activating poorly telegraphed switches, like the statue busts that can be turned with a sword strike. Thankfully, a password system effectively allows you to save your progress, and comes with a nice bonus… A pixel art portrait of the Lupin gang that starts out empty but adds one extra character to the scene with each level passed.\n\nAs old computer platformers go, Castle Of Cagliostro is a pleasant surprise. It’s enjoyable to play, well polished and balanced enough that you can stand a reasonable chance of finishing it in a weekend. It’s also faithful to its source material in a way most games of the Eighties never were, so Lupin fans will almost certainly get a kick out of it.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? Yes! If you love platformers with lots of variety and secret bits then you’ll have a good time with this one.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? Yep. This pricey collectible is best left to collectors. Emulate away.\n\nLUPIN THE 3RD: PANDORA’S LEGACY\n\nYear: 1987 | Format: Famicom | Developer: Namco/Tose | Jacket: Green\n\nNamco’s take on Lupin The Third initially comes across as a fairly limited Rolling Thunder clone, with basic run-n-gun mechanics, high and low platforms to run along, and doors to hide in, which occasionally give way to additional rooms. The opening rooftop area, with its bottomless pits, tricky platforming and gotcha enemies, can prove frustrating, but if you manage to get past it, the game opens up into a more interesting adventure.\n\nRight from the off you can select between Lupin, Jigen and Goemon, with each representing a single life. It’s a shame you can’t play as Fujiko too, but at least each character has their own unique skills to keep the action varied. Die once and you’ll lose access to that character, at least until you manage to locate them elsewhere in the game, all tied up. Rescue an ally and they’re back in the pack!\n\nAlong with the usual action you’d expect from the genre, much of the fun of Pandora’s Legacy comes from the power-ups, some of which can be deliberately selected, like a powerful shotgun or the jetpack, while others apply passively, like the kids’ balloon that saves you from a fall off the bottom of the screen and comically allows you to shoot Lupin’s pistol while you drift around the stage.\n\nThere’s plenty of variety to the different stages, including a particularly fun level where you control a diddy version of Lupin’s car, as your character pokes his head out of the window to keep on attacking while the vehicle hops about. Unfortunately, the difficulty level of the game is pretty steep, so it could take a lot of practice to get to this stage.\n\nIn story terms, this is a sequel of sorts to Castle Of Cagliostro, and sees the gang once again trying to rescue Clarisse from an unwanted wedding. There’s quite a lot of dialogue in the game, as well as some NPCs that give out hints during the adventure, so players may wish to download the fan translation to enjoy the game to its fullest.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? Yes! It’s a Rolling Thunder-like with a Lupin theme. You’ll probably enjoy it.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? No! If you already own a Famicom this is a cool cartridge to add to your collection, and has some lovely box art too.\n\nLUPIN THE 3RD: LEGEND OF THE GOLD OF BABYLON\n\nYear: 1988 | Format: MSX | Developer: Toho | Jacket: Red (Pink on the box)\n\nI’ve written and re-written this paragraph about five times now in an attempt to find something positive to say about Legend Of The Gold Of Babylon and this is the best I’ve got… Lupin’s bubble gum is a pretty interesting weapon of choice.\n\nSeriously, there’s a good idea at the centre of this otherwise horrible game. With a press of the action button, Lupin blows a bubble, which can then be used to absorb the impact of one hit from an enemy or projectile. Alternatively, you can press the button again to send that bubble firing across the screen like a deadly gum cannonball.\n\nSadly, everything else is about as much fun as finding gum on the bottom of your shoe. Enemies charge headlong at Lupin or move in such fiendish patterns that they can easily ping pong him to death. If you’re really unlucky then you might get knocked into a pit where Lupin is bombarded with fireballs from both sides and must survive without taking a hit in order to collect a rare treasure and then bounce back up to the surface. Where he’ll probably die anyway.\n\nLupin can only take three hits before you get a game over, so progress is only really possible by committing every single perfect move to memory and practicing over and over again to inch forward about one screen every ten attempts. The whole experience amounts to, without exaggeration, one of the most miserable games I’ve played in decades.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? Hell no!\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? No. It’s not even worth loading up a rom. Don’t waste your time.\n\nLUPIN THE 3RD: LEGEND OF THE GOLD OF BABYLON\n\nYear: 1989 | Format: PC-88 | Developer: Toho | Jacket: Red (Pink on the box)\n\nAnother PC-88 game that’s completely different to its MSX counterpart. In this case, the Legend Of Gold Of Babylon is loosely adapted into a Snatcher-style adventure that features the same scenario as the movie but deviates significantly in its plot specifics. Like the previous PC-88 game, this is so text-heavy that it’s completely unplayable for most of us, but you can watch a 40-minute speedrun here if you really want to.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? Nope!\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? It really doesn’t seem worth the effort, unless a fan translation ever comes out.\n\nSD LUPIN THE 3RD: OPERATION TO BREAK THE SAFE\n\nYear: 1990 | Format: Game Boy | Developer: Nova Games | Jacket: Green, naturally\n\nUsing the “SD” (super deformed) style, popularised by games like SD Gundam or SD Snatcher, was a smart move for this Game Boy exclusive action puzzler. Squashing the sprites down into diddy, monochromatic form was a great way to keep the iconic cast of characters recognisable on Game Boy’s blurry green screen. When Zenigata chases Lupin across the screen in one of the interstitial scenes, extending his telescoping handcuffs out to catch him, it perfectly captures the cartoon charm of the anime in just a few pixels.\n\nThe game itself is notable for being one of the few Lupin games where thievery is the central premise. Each maze contains a key and a safe, and it’s the player’s task to find and reunite the two so Lupin can walk away with millions. At the start of the game you can choose which antagonist will pursue Lupin through the maze, effectively determining the starting difficulty level.\n\nMazes become more complicated, filled with traps and pitfalls, as the difficulty increases, but there are a couple of tricks up Lupin’s sleeve. Certain power-ups will summon Lupin’s pals to help out, while a press of the B button prompts Lupin to jump on the spot, raising the tile directly beneath his feet so that he can then use the extra height to leap the distance of two tiles in any direction.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? Nah. This is ultimately one of the weaker Lupin games and isn’t good enough to trouble Game Boy’s top 100.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? No. The original cart can be found quite cheaply and the best thing about the game is the SD art on the box.\n\nLUPIN THE 3rd: THE DEVIL HANDS OF HONG KONG\n\nYear: 1990 | Format: FM Towns| Developer: CSK | Jacket: Red\n\nIn order to bring you this article I’ve jumped through a lot of hoops and spent a small fortune. I bought a Super Cassette Vision just to play one Lupin game, and convinced a friend to jury rig a Wii Remote to his Naomi cabinet so I could test a lightgun game. But I absolutely draw the line at buying an FM Towns just to play a 90-minute text adventure. So, off to YouTube with ya. It doesn’t look like I’m missing much but I will say that I quite like the look of the simple art used to illustrate the game. It’s not quite anime quality. It looks a bit too “off model” for that, which only makes it more endearing. But not endearing enough to buy an obscure console with virtually zero import-friendly games.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? I didn’t, so I really can’t recommend anyone else does.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? If you’re rich and crazy enough to buy an FM Towns, you should probably buy the game too.\n\nLUPIN THE 3rd: HUNT FOR THE TREASURE OF LEGEND!\n\nYear: 1994 | Format: Super Famicom| Developer: Epoch | Jacket: Red\n\nThis one starts promisingly enough, with a classy pixel art rendition of the anime opening sequence that really shows off what 16-bit could bring to licensed games. Sadly, the game itself isn’t so hot, though I at least like that it doesn’t feel like the kind of generic licensed platformer that was typical of the time. There’s more of a puzzly feel to the action, with mazes to explore and gadgets to deploy. I even like Lupin’s casual animation, with one hand coolly stuck in his pocket, though it’s strange that he somehow crawls faster than he walks. However, after a few levels I got really bored of the lifeless, grey, empty levels and lost interest. The Lupin anime has a beautiful globetrotting feel to it, with so many eye catching locations on screen, so it’s weird that that this game only offers endless dark warehouses.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? Nope! If you want to play a great puzzle-platformer with Lupin in it, skip to the end of this list.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? Nah. Just watch the intro animation and you’re done.\n\nLUPIN THE 3rd: THE MASTER FILE\n\nYear: 1996 | Format: Saturn| Developer: Mizuki | Jacket: Unseen\n\nNot a game at all but more a CD-ROM encyclopedia of all things Lupin, as they were in 1996. In the years before the internet as we know it today, I can see that this disc might have been a nice little resource for fans. You can read tons of trivial information about the characters, check out concept sketches or watch opening animations from the TV show. One of the coolest parts is the ability to flick through scans of the manga while also watching anime clips that directly adapted the same pages. In 2022 though, there’s not much on here you can’t learn online, especially if you can’t read Japanese.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? It’s not a game. So, no.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? Nah. If you want to learn about the history of Lupin and watch some video clips, just go on YouTube.\n\nLUPIN THE THIRD: THE CASTLE OF CAGLIOSTRO REUNION\n\nYear: 1997 | Format: PlayStation| Developer: Asmik | Jacket: Green\n\nWhile most Lupin games adapt an existing story or forge their own, this one is more of a sequel, in which Lupin and company return to the Château de Cagliostro years after the events of the film. The game itself is a first-person perspective adventure, with some similarities to Myst. There are several locations to explore, environmental puzzles to solve and NPCs to chat to. At certain points you might encounter a key location or object from the film, which can be interacted with in order to make Lupin reminisce about the past, often triggering a little flashback made up of grainy footage from the movie.\n\nThe Castle Of Cagliostro Reunion is certainly an interesting prospect but, sadly, it’s a very text-heavy game with no fan translation available. If you don’t have the language skills, you’re likely to find yourself bumbling around the same few areas, repeatedly interacting with everything in the vain hope of triggering the right condition to move the story along. Which is a shame, because this looks and feels like it might be a good, nostalgic time for fans of the film.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? Unless you understand Japanese, no.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? Without language skills you’ll probably only want to play this for 10 minutes, if at all, so sure. Why not?\n\nLUPIN THE 3RD: CHRONICLES\n\nYear: 1997 | Format: Saturn| Developer: Spike | Jacket: Unseen\n\nBasically just Master File again but with a more videogamey feel. While the contents of the former disc are browsed via a simple menu interface, Chronicles is showier, allowing you to explore a small room of Lupin artifacts in first-person 3D. The contents themselves are more of the same… Character profiles, concept art and short video clips, including footage from movies as well as TV. Although there are small attempts to embrace interactivity, such as the Lupin trivia quiz housed in a little arcade cabinet. Of the two CD-ROM-like titles, I’d say this is the better and more interesting package but is equally disposable.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? No.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? No!\n\nLUPIN THE 3RD: SAGE OF THE PYRAMID\n\nYear: 1998 | Format: Saturn| Developer: Vantan International | Jacket: Red\n\nThis 3D tomb raiding adventure clearly wears its inspirations on its red jacket sleeve. Made right at the height of Lara Croft mania, you can see what the developers were thinking as the idea of exploring a giant pyramid in order to find a hidden treasure and then escape alive is well suited to the world of Lupin.\n\nAlthough the blocky polygons don’t really suit the rounded, fluid animation of Lupin, the 3D holds up pretty well and is technically competent. I initially found it fun to explore the mazes and interact with a few simple puzzles but as the level design becomes more complicated I soon found my enthusiasm ebbing away. Before too long, every room starts to look the same, the corridors feel claustrophobic and as you lose sight of where you are and where you’re meant to be, the temptation to switch off and play something else soon wins.\n\nThere are at least some nice Lupin-like touches to be found. Miss-time a jump and Lupin will try to swim through the air before plummeting, for example. I also really like that CPU controlled Jigen and Goemon join you at the end of certain stages to help fight your way to the exit, which certainly captures the team spirit of the show.\n\nUltimately though, Sage Of The Pyramid just isn’t fun enough to justify your time. There are much better 3D dungeon crawlers on Saturn (Hello, Burning Rangers) and there are certainly better Lupin games. It would be best to leave this particular treasure buried.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? No. Your Saturn deserves better.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? Nope. This isn’t worth battling with the pain of Saturn emulation.\n\nLUPIN THE 3RD\n\nYear: 1998 | Format: PlayStation| Developer: Daiki | Jacket: Red\n\nWhile most Lupin games are either based on or inspired by the anime, this interactive comic book directly adapts the manga instead, giving it a distinct visual style. The game itself adapts four of the classic Monkey Punch stories, taking the original panels, adding light animations, colour, music, sound effects and speech to create an audiovisual treat. There’s zero interactivity to be found, but the production values are so good it doesn’t matter. Rather unexpectedly, the disc also includes the option to switch all text and speech to English so this is 100% import friendly. The voices aren’t exactly anime quality; you get the feeling the cast was dragged in off the street. But it would be churlish to complain when so few import games bother to cater for English speakers.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? If you love the manga or you’re curious about it, yes.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? Yes. You’ll probably only watch each story once. But if you like what you see, I’d recommend buying the official English language manga collection.\n\nPUNCH THE MONKEY: GAME EDITION\n\nYear: 2000 | Format: PlayStation| Developer: KAZe | Jacket: Red\n\nPunch The Monkey seems to be a series of CD soundtracks featuring remixes and covers of various Lupin The Third tunes. The “Game Edition”, which helpfully emblazons the word GAME across its jewel case so there’s no possible chance of confusion, takes those same tunes and adapts them to a rhythm action game. Which, I have to admit, piqued my interest. After so many multimedia discs on PlayStation and Saturn, I liked the prospect of playing something a little different.\n\nSadly, Punch The Monkey isn’t a particularly good rhythm action game. The gameplay is no more sophisticated than Parappa The Rapper and the presentation lacks any of that game’s charm. Tiny video clips from the first two seasons of the anime play in time to the music as you stab away at a parade of face buttons. Which wouldn’t be so bad if the tracks were the unedited tunes from the TV shows, but instead the hit and miss remixes rob the game of any nostalgic familiarity it might otherwise have. So it’s not a great rhythm action game and it’s not the Lupin music celebration it could have been either.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? Nope! Just listen to the anime soundtracks on YouTube instead.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? Don’t waste your time.\n\nLUPIN THE THIRD TYPING SOFT: 26+α NO KAGI\n\nYear: 2001 | Format: PC, Mac| Developer: Movic Inc. | Jacket: Red\n\nThe one and only true Lupin game released for Windows PCs (multiple screensaver packs absolutely don’t count) is labelled as a “typing tutor”, although that’s a generous description. This series of 25 mini-games features still anime images that require the keyboard be used to solve quick-time event style challenges. In some cases you’ll need to type out an entire Japanese word in answer to a certain question but more often than not you just need to press a single, clearly telegraphed key at the correct time. The anime imagery is pretty nice, but this barely qualifies as a game.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? No. If you want a much more fun Lupin typing game, have a look two more entries down this list!\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? Good luck finding an ISO!\n\nLUPIN THE THIRD: THE SHOOTING\n\nYear: 2001 | Format: Arcade| Developer: Eighting/Wow Entertainment | Jacket: Red\n\nI was lucky enough to play this Sega lightgun game back when it was brand new, during my first visit to Japan in 2002. I haven’t seen the cab since, and emulation has failed me, although I did briefly get a mate to load this up on his Naomi cabinet and we somehow got a Wii Remote working with it for a few minutes. Don’t ask how because I can’t tell you!\n\nIf you’ve played a Sega lightgun game before then you know exactly what to expect here. It’s all pretty standard stuff with no gimmicks to make it stand out, and not enough depth to earn it a reputation of any kind.\n\nAs a Lupin game though, it’s pretty great. The cel shaded graphics capture the look and feel of the anime perfectly and are complemented by animated portraits for Lupin and Jigen, which change as the action unfolds. They’re kinda like the portrait of Doomguy in the original Doom, only much friendlier!\n\nThe action does a nice job of capturing that Lupin feel, with plenty of chase sequences and shouty Zenigata moments. While the occasional mini-game really nails the spirit of a crime caper. There’s a high speed getaway section where you shoot at each side of the screen to steer the car, and a jewelry store robbery in which each shot sucks up valuable treasures.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? If you ever see the arcade cab, sure.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? Well, I struggled to get it working on an emulator and I doubt it’s much fun without a lightgun anyway. So let’s go with no.\n\nLUPIN THE THIRD: THE TYPING\n\nYear: 2002 | Format: Arcade| Developer: Eighting/Wow Entertainment | Jacket: Red\n\nMuch as Sega’s Typing Of The Dead turned House Of The Dead 2 into a type-‘em-up, this arcade spin-off takes the previous year’s Lupin The Third: The Shooting and swaps the guns for keyboards. As each enemy appears, a word will pop up on screen and the player will need to type out that word to shoot them down. Weak enemies might only require you to type in a four or five letter word, while harder foes hilariously demand you tap out the equivalent of an epic poem.\n\nAside from this one big change, the rest of the game is practically identical to The Shooting, so there’s not much more to say about it. Except that this one is much more “emulator friendly”. Not only was I able to get it working, it’s also quite natural to play on a computer because of the keyboard controls. The game even supports western letters, so even though you might not understand the meaning of the words, you can still type away and win.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? For the novelty, yes.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? Yep. You’ll never see this arcade game in your life and it actually suits emulation really well.\n\nLUPIN THE 3RD: TREASURE OF THE SORCERER KING\n\nYear: 2002 | Format: PlayStation 2| Developer: Banpresto| Jacket: Red\n\nTreasure Of The Sorcerer King was the first in a new era of Lupin games that used the power of PlayStation 2 to really recreate the look and feel of the anime for the first time. Characters benefit from a high polygon count to appear nicely rounded and cartoon-like, while the animation recreates the zany poses of the tv show, and with the addition of authentic music and voice actors, this game really feels like an extension of the anime.\n\nThe game itself is a stealth based action adventure, where Lupin must sneak around to outwit patrolling guards while solving minor puzzles to progress. It reminds me a lot of cult PSOne adventure Chase The Express, not least because the first stage sees you explore the inside of a train. A big selling point is the various disguises Lupin can wear, each of which comes with its own gameplay gimmick, such as the guard uniform, which allows you to salute other guards to avoid suspicion. You’ll also find handy gadgets, such as the night vision goggles to reveal the train’s laser security system.\n\nTreasure Of The Sorcerer King received a worldwide release and the US version even includes the same famous voice cast as the anime, which is a great touch. Sadly, the European version was only released in Italy and that’s the version I had to play, so I do feel like I’m missing out on some of the fun. Even then, the game design is easy enough to understand without the story and provides a nice PSOne style adventure with a colourful Lupin skin.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? If you’re willing to put up with some clunky, slow paced gameplay, you’ll definitely find some fun here.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? If you don’t have a way to play US PS2 games but you can emulate them, I’d recommend going for that version just to get the most out of it.\n\nLUPIN THE 3RD: LOST TREASURE BY THE SEA\n\nYear: 2003 | Format: GameCube| Developer: Asmik Ace Entertainment | Jacket: Red\n\nAs videogames consoles matured and found themselves able to deliver high-resolution animation just as easily as a DVD player, it’s only natural that publishers of licensed anime games would increasingly turn their attention toward interactive movies. But, by god, is it boring! As far as I’ve been able to stomach Lost Treasure By The Sea, it’s nothing more than a visual novel, with animation quality ranging from good to agonisingly static, and barely any gameplay to speak of, aside from the occasional dialogue choice that seems to have no real bearing on the plot.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? If you understand Japanese and you really, really enjoy non-interactive visual novels… Maybe.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? If you do, just un-steal it asap.\n\nLUPIN THE 3RD: THE LEGACY OF COLUMBUS’S INHERITANCE\n\nYear: 2004 | Format: PlayStation 2| Developer: Banpresto | Jacket: Red\n\nThis Japan-only sequel builds on the template of the first PS2 game and moves the action from a train to a high rise tower, with Lupin naturally progressing ever further up the building. Die Hard this ain’t; the action is virtually non-existent and the game has a sleepy pace. The level design is more expansive than the first, with multiple rooms that are less linear to explore, but there’s a sad, empty feeling to it all. I did like some of the gadgets, especially the grappling hook that lets you reach certain remote areas in Lupin’s typically suave style. But, on the whole, I found this one a little dull.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? Not really. Anything good that this does can be found in the first PS2 game, and that one’s in English too.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? No, you’ll regret it.\n\nLUPIN THE 3RD: LUPIN IS DEAD, ZENIGATA IS IN LOVE\n\nYear: 2007 | Format: PlayStation 2| Developer: Nex Entertainment | Jacket: Red\n\nThe third and final PS2 Lupin game is easily the best. This one is made by a different developer and feels more committed to capturing the anime in interactive form. The opening section is especially action packed, with a brief quick time event sequence, followed quickly by a high-speed car chase and shoot-out combo. It’s a fantastic start that sadly slows down soon after, as the game settles in to a more laid back adventure template. These later stages at least keep the variety high, spicing up the exploration and fetch quests with the occasional punch ups, stealth sections and, er… A bit where you use a fishing rod to swipe a wig from a bloke’s head.\n\nSadly, this game was never released in English, which is a shame because the story seems pretty neat. Focusing on a romance between Zenigata and Ginrei, a rival of Fujiko, it even includes side levels where you get to play as the bumbling inspector. Though there’s no English release, like Treasure Of The Sorcerer King, there was an Italian one. I like how well the localised Italian title works… Lupin la Morte, Zeniagta l’Amore.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? If you understand Japanese, or Italian, think of this is as an interactive anime and you should get enough out of it.\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? You probably should. This one is getting pretty expensive these days and though it’s a half-decent Lupin game it’s far from a great game in general.\n\nLUPIN THE THIRD: THE GREATEST BRAIN BATTLE IN HISTORY\n\nYear: 2010 | Format: Nintendo DS | Developer: Nex Entertainment | Jacket: Red\n\nThe final (so far) Lupin The Third game is also one of the more unexpected. Half of the game is a side-scrolling puzzle-platformer with a focus on stealth. It kind of reminds me of Taito’s forgotten PSP platformer Exit, except for the other half of the game, which is a straight up Professor Layton clone. Each stage features a number of puzzle book style conundrums for Lupin to solve, and just like Layton, many make use of the Nintendo DS touch screen with satisfyingly tactile play.\n\nHonestly, I’m not sure either phase of the game really captures the tone of a Lupin adventure but I don’t care too much. This is a good game! The mix of genres works pretty well and the puzzles have exactly the kind of casual, laid back appeal that made Nintendo DS so popular in its heyday. It’s a shame this one never got an English release but there is a fan translation out there, and I’m pleased to say most of the puzzles are reasonably easy to make sense of in Japanese. For those that aren’t, there’s a handy guide on GameFAQs.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT? If you’d like a Layton-style puzzler with a Lupin flavour… Yes!\n\nSHOULD I STEAL IT? Nah. If you walk the streets of Japan, there’s a chance you might still find a new copy of this. I found one on ebay pretty cheap.\n\nAnd there you have it! 25 Lupin The Third games of wildly varying qualities. I hope you found this article interesting or at the very least informative. For my part, I started work on this article back in April 2022 and as I write this sentence it’s now late October. It’s been a mammoth undertaking and I think it’s testament to the appeal of Lupin that I haven’t been completely turned off the license forever.\n\nA few of these games are, unfortunately, shovelware crap. I can’t recommend you play those, but there’s definitely a handful of interesting curios, spanning a surprising number of genres, that are well worth a look if you’re a Lupin fan.\n\nPersonally, I had the most fun with the games developed in the Eighties, before the rot of FMV and text-heavy adventures set in. Those earliest games have the biggest variety of gameplay and feature some fun graphical interpretations of the characters. At the other end of the timeline, I can’t quite fathom why a multimedia franchise as popular as Lupin The Third hasn’t had a new game in 12 years, but at least it went out on a high. The Nintendo DS game is pretty neat.\n\nI’d like to see another Lupin game at some point in the future, but after all of these I’m very happy to take a little break. Although, as I type this, I see that a new anime series, a prequel called Lupin Zero, has been announced. So I don’t think it will be too long before I’m pulling back on that iconic greed/red/pink/yellow jacket for another caper."
