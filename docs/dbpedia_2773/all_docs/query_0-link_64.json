        "text": "Well, it’s safe to say that I spoke too soon when I promised that I’d write my next article by February. Granted, it’s not that I haven’t been writing. Quite the opposite, in fact. The problem is that most of the energy I’ve spent writing thus far in 2023 has been focused …elsewhere. While I do have ideas for more Retronaissance articles, my free time has been at a premium since last June. And to be completely honest, that other project I’m alluding to has been my top priority as of late. Well, in most cases, anyway. Fortunately, finding the necessary motivation has always been easy when it comes to my triannual PC port listicles. And this year is no different.\n\nBefore we get into the list itself, it’s time for the usual update on PC ports that have been announced and released since last time. In other words, pretty much all of the news that’s fit to print (as far as I’m concerned) from December 2022 all the way through March 2023. December was slim pickings as far as PC gaming was concerned. On December 15th, ININ Games announced that WONDER BOY ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION – that is, the larger collection that was previously limited to a small physical release – would be hitting eShop and PlayStation Network. While that clearly isn’t a confirmation of a PC port, the fact that the more extensive version is becoming more widely available does make me a bit more optimistic that it could make the jump over to my platform of choice at some point in the future. After all, ININ does have a weird tendency to allow the occasional PC port now and then. Aside from that, Sloclap announced on December 20th that their hit game Sifu would finally be coming to PC Steam, along with the Xbox One and Xbox Series consoles in March 2023 alongside a free update… and this would eventually come to pass on March 28th. January wasn’t much better: the only news came from Nippon Ichi Software who announced a Western localization of Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless, which would include a PC port alongside the existing PlayStation and Switch versions.\n\nFebruary, on the other hand, pretty much single-handedly carried this entire trimester… and it’s not even close. On February 5th, Marvelous Entertainment announced that they would be publishing the fan-game Touhou Shinsekai: Longing for an alternative world on multiple platforms, including PC. This game is the follow-up to a previous action-RPG set in the Touhou universe known as Scarlet Curiosity and would eventually receive a proper confirmation for a Western release, as well as a new title for the English market – Touhou: New World. This would be followed by two announcements the very next day. First, Sega would shadow-drop the PC version of Sonic Colors: Ultimate on Steam with no warning. Then, Pixel Heart announced that they would be bringing the indie fighting game Verdict Guilty to consoles on February 16th. But my favorite announcement of the trimester would come the day after that. Pocky & Rocky Reshrined was announced for PC on February 7th and would eventually release on the 24th. And to keep the ball rolling, the 8th brought us a Nintendo Direct with two more (clearly unintentional) announcements of PC ports: Capcom confirmed the existence of the Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective remaster that was leaked by the Korean ratings board late last year, while Bandai Namco announced We Love Katamari REROLL+ Royal Reverie.\n\nHard to believe that February managed to cram that much news into the span of a single week.\n\nAfter that, things got quiet again until March 1st. Out of nowhere, Nippon Ichi Software America, Nihon Falcom and PH3 Games shadow-dropped a PC port of The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki …not to be confused with the port released by Clouded Leopard Entertainment last year, which was developed with Chinese and Korean-speaking audiences in mind. While the game itself is currently only contains the Japanese script and voicework, Falcom confirmed that an English translation was set to be patched in at some undetermined point in the future – which effectively means this port also serves as a stealth confirmation that NISA will be localizing the game. My guess is that they’re going to wait until after the upcoming Trails into Reverie comes out this July before they start hyping up its follow-up. And then, just when I thought we were done with announcements for the month, Square Enix announced on March 30th that their HD-2D remake of LIVE A LIVE would be coming to the PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on April 27th. They also released demos on all three platforms, that would allow players to transfer their progression to the full game, similar to the demo they released back before the game originally launched on the Switch. I’ll admit, it’s not particularly high on my list right now… but I am curious to check it out at some point in the future.\n\nI’d also like to announce a couple of changes to the format compared to previous years. For starters, I’m going to dropping my “likeliest platform” predictions, simply because it feels anachronistic. After all, most games that originate on PC either seem to launch on all home consoles simultaneously these days or launch as timed exclusives on one or two consoles, before making their way elsewhere later on. Trying to predict any sort of console exclusivity feels like a fool’s errand when multi-platform releases have become the norm. The other change is that I will be taking Steam Deck compatibility into account when it comes the ever-present “controller support” criterion I hold most of these games too. Obviously, lacking any kind of support for the Steam Deck won’t preclude games from being nominated, but for games that have a default control scheme via the Steam Deck: its inputs are essentially identical to first-party controllers for all three major console manufacturers, aside from the addition of the two extra trackpads on the face and the superfluous triggers on the system’s back, which are generally just used as programmable shortcut keys. Being “Deck Verified” would obviously fulfill this requirement but being “Deck Playable” would likely require a little extra research – as reasons for missing out on verification range from “the game not automatically launching in the proper aspect ratio (despite having that display option available in the game’s settings)” all the way to requiring some combination of the touch screen, trackpads and on-screen keyboard to configure the game before playing it.\n\nAside from that, the other requirements for selecting games are going to remain as they have always been. The games I’ll be covering will be games available on PC that were released during the “seventh generation” of home consoles onward. In other words, nothing released on PC before 2006. Likewise, games that are no longer legitimately available on home consoles (but can still be procured by legitimate means on PC) will also be up for nomination. That means games that were previously on defunct services like the Wii Shop Channel, XBLIG and – new for 2023! – the 3DS and Wii U branches of Nintendo’s eShop can show up on these lists, so long as they’re only currently up for sale on PC. Also, I’ll be avoiding PC games that are currently in “Early Access”, as it’s pretty common for console versions to be announced alongside a game’s full release. Finally, “consoles” only refer to devices released under the PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo brands. Given the target audience I have in mind for these lists, that means games that are also available on iOS, Android, Stadia, Luna and even the humble Ouya are still valid nominations.\n\nPizza Tower\n\nLet’s be completely honest: the sheer memetic pull this game has had on the internet since its release made picking Pizza Power as this year’s headliner a no-brainer, if not a total waste of a slot. But I just can’t resist picking games that are clearly destined to go multi-platform when it comes to any of my PC port-related lists. Heavily inspired by the likes of the classic Wario Land series, Pizza Tower stands at the very forefront of the so-called “Wario-like” movement that is taking hold within the indie game scene. With a social media presence akin to that of other indie darlings like Undertale and Five Nights at Freddy’s, the only thing that’s really holding Pizza Tower back is the fact that it’s self-published on PC by the game’s small development team. But I have no doubt in my heart that every major indie-centric publisher is already beating a path to Tour De Pizza’s door, salivating over the sheer amount of cheddar mozzarella they could make with console ports. In other words, it’s clearly a question of “when”, not “if”.\n\nViolet Wisteria\n\nMeanwhile, Violet Wisteria (also known as “Violet Fujiko”) is a far more niche release. Taking clear inspiration from games like the Valis series, with a dedication to the authentic old-school difficulty of the 16-bit era, Japanese indie developer KaniPro Games’ debut release has flown under the radar in its modest release. Still, I absolutely fell in love with the game after playing it during one of last year’s Steam Next Fests. Likewise, the game’s color-coded mechanics offer an additional layer of complexity that refines the gameplay even further. In addition to a rock-paper-scissors style weakness cycle – white attacks harm red enemies, red beats blue and blue defeats white – hitting enemies with attacks of the same color sends Wisteria flying backwards, allowing for long jumps necessary to cross gaps that would be insurmountable otherwise.\n\nCats Organized Neatly/Dogs Organized Neatly\n\nIt’s funny. While I generally hate slide puzzles with the fury of a thousand suns, I do have a soft spot for other types of puzzle games that rely on spatial awareness. At the very least, solving a particularly difficult puzzle does give me a sense of satisfaction. As such, I had a blast with DU&I’s feline-focused puzzler a couple years back and last year, I played through their canine-centric follow-up with equal enthusiasm. Admittedly, I played through both strictly with a mouse, but while neither game claims dedicated controller support, they are both Deck Verified. Though admittedly, they may want to refine those controls, as they currently just use the analog sticks and trackpads to emulate the mouse controls to varying success. Still, given the fact that the controls consist entirely of selecting pieces, rotating them and placing them in the play area, it should be simple enough to tighten them up for a proper console release.\n\nAlien Splatter Redux\n\nSinclair Strange is a developer that I’ve been following unintentionally for a while now. A one-man dev team that originally posted his work on my beloved Newgrounds, he’s since started releasing more substantial games on Steam. The first of these projects was I Want To Be Human, which was actually published by European publisher Rising Star Games. Lately, Strange has been going the self-publishing route. I could’ve chosen any of Sinclair’s games, but considering I just beat Alien Splatter Redux at the tail end of last year, it felt like the most appropriate choice. Redux is actually a remake of one of Strange’s Flash games from Newgrounds, originally posted all the way back in 2013. Billed as a “proper” 8-bit adventure like the ones from the “golden gaming days”, ASR definitely lives up to its developer’s promises at a particularly generous price point. Lacking a publishing partner may make this one a hard sell for consoles, but it’d be neat if someone would allow Sinclair to bundle all of his more recent 8-bit style games and sell them together at a more substantial price.\n\nASTLIBRA Revision\n\nASTLIBRA Revision is another one of those games I discovered through one of Valve’s Steam Next Fest events. It’s a side-scrolling action-RPG, a relatively rare playstyle these days. Developer KAIZO sunk a decade and a half into developing this one and as far as I’m concerned, it was all worth the effort. And while WhisperGames, ASTLIBRA’s publisher, tends to focus more on localizing games from other companies for consumption throughout China and other parts of Asia, hopefully one of their many business partners would be willing to port this modern-day hidden gem to home consoles at some point.\n\nChico and the Magic Orchards DX\n\nIt seems like when it comes to the “faux-retro” scene, more and more platforms from the past are getting their stylistic due, as opposed to everything looking like they belong on the NES. One platform that seems to be getting a lot more love as of late is the humble Game Boy Color. While the most prominent example that comes to mind is already coming to home consoles, Chico and the Magic Orchards DX is cut from similar cloth, going for the classic top-down adventure style popularized by the early handheld Zelda games, though this adventure’s squirrelly savior wields a walnut as opposed to a sword of legend.\n\nCurse Crackers: For Whom the Belle Toils\n\nSpeaking of GBC-themed “retraux” games, Curse Crackers is a platformer developed by the fine folks over at Colorgrave – the team behind Prodigal, which was on last year’s list, if you can believe it. Players take on the role of Belle, as she sets off to rescue her boyfriend from her rival/childhood friend and her literal skeleton crew. Working alongside a living bell named Chime, Belle uses her acrobatic prowess to conquer platforming perils, defeat baleful bosses and pick up various collectibles on her quest to rescue her beloved Clyde. Of course, while the main game boasts side content galore, there’s also a separate “arcade mode”, which focuses purely on the platforming action, as well as various extras that can be unlocked completing in-game objectives.\n\nTakkoman -Kouzatsu World-\n\nYou know, it’s weird. I’ve never actually played any of the mainline Touhou games, but I did play a couple of fan-games based on the series last year. I enjoyed both of them, even if they had absolutely nothing to do with the bullet-hell gameplay the series is best known for. Takkoman is a platform in the same vein of the MegaMan games, but with a Touhou twist. Given the fact that I’m a sucker for “MegaMan-likes” – especially given the recent hiatuses when it comes to new games that star the Blue Bomber himself – this was pretty much a lock for my list. Honestly, I’m surprised it isn’t already on consoles: Touhou fan-games aren’t exactly a rare sight on consoles and PLAYISM (the game’s publisher) is no stranger to releasing games on platforms besides the PC.\n\nLenna’s Inception\n\nI seem to have a fascination with action-adventure games in the vein of the early Zelda titles. Lenna’s Inception is a more traditional one, that leans equally into combat and puzzles, though its story seems a bit more unconventional. Players take on the role of the eponymous Lenne, as she’s tasked with saving the world from impending doom brought on by eight Archangels and taking the form of glitches. The game’s aesthetic shifts between classic 8-bit and a slightly more contemporary “32-bit” – a look that’s clearly inspired by the Game Boy Advance, as opposed to a style that emulates games from the PS1 or Saturn, as one might expect. The game even includes a daily “challenge dungeon” to keep players interested even after clearing the main campaign. But honestly, something completely unrelated makes me feel confident about the game’s chances: Cassette Beasts (Bytten Studio’s latest game) was just announced to be coming to consoles via publisher Raw Fury.\n\nHYPER DEMON\n\nI’m not going to bury the lede on this one: HYPER DEMON makes the list solely based on the fact that it’s exactly how I’d always hoped video games would look like in the future when I was a child, as opposed to the drab nigh-realism we’re constantly subjected to. Developed by the same team that brought us Devil Daggers, HYPER DEMON is its polar opposite in terms of gameplay. As opposed to trying to survive against endless waves of enemies for as long as possible, HYPER DEMON tasks players with clearing out hordes as quickly as possible, racking up a massive score in the process. But as I said before, what separates this game from the hundreds of other rogue-like – or is it “rogue-lite”? – first-person shooters on the market today are the game’s visuals. Feel free to call me petty for choosing style over substance, but I haven’t felt this way about a game’s graphics in a long, long time."
