        "text": "Notes:\n\n*After the \"Every Sega CD game in North America\" episode, I wanted to do on that was quick and easy. This turned out to be anything but. The Mystical Ninja Goemon Zero segment turned out to be more than I thought it would be. Then later Saturn prototypes of Prize Fighter and Sacred Pools were found, so I decided to include those. A couple of weeks after that, Victor Ireland informed me of the Far East of Eden Ziria video he had and sent it to me. I ended up removing a SNES game that I can't even remember the name of. It was the shortest, least interesting, and weakest segment in the video, barely even being an alpha.\n\nGames Shown:\n\nSega CD - 3 Ninjas Kick Back, AX-101, The Adventures of Batman & Robin, The Adventures of Willy Beamish, After Burner III, AH3 Thunderstrike, The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin, Android Assault: The Revenge of Bari-Arm, Batman Returns, Battlecorps, BC Racers, Bill Walsh College Football, Black Hole Assault, Bouncers, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Brutal: Paws of Fury, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs: The Second Cataclysm, Championship Soccer â94, Chuck Rock, Chuck Rock II - Son of Chuck, Cliffhanger, Cobra Command, Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia, Corpse Killer, Crime Patrol, Dark Wizard, Demolition Man, Double Switch, Dracula Unleashed, Dragon's Lair, Dune, Dungeon Explorer, Dungeon Master II - Skullkeep, Earthworm Jim - Special Edition, Ecco the Dolphin, Ecco The Tides of Time, ESPN Baseball Tonight, ESPN National Hockey Night, ESPN NBA Hangtime '95, ESPN Sunday Night NFL, Eternal Champions: Challenge From the Dark Side, Eye of the Beholder, Fahrenheit, Fatal Fury Special, FIFA International Soccer, Final Fight CD, Flashback - The Quest for Identity, Formula One World Championship - Beyond the Limit, Ground Zero Texas, Heart of the Alien - Out of this World Parts I and II, Heimdall, Hook, Iron Helix, Jaguar XJ220, Jeopardy!, Joe Montana's NFL Football, Jurassic Park, Keio Flying Squadron, Kids on Site, The Lawnmower Man, Lethal Enforcers, Lethal Enforcers II - Gun Fighters, Links - The Challenge of Golf, Loadstar - The Legend of Tully Bodine, Lords of Thunder, Lunar The Silver Star, Lunar Eternal Blue, Mad Dog McCree, Mad Dog II - The Lost Gold, Make My Video - INXS, Make My Video - Kris Kross, Make My Video - Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, Make My Video - Power Factory Featuring C+C Music Factory, Mansion of Hidden Souls, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Masked Rider - Kamen Rider ZO, The, MegaRace, Mickey Mania - The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse, Microcosm, Midnight Raiders, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, The Misadventures of Flink, Mortal Kombat, My Paint - The Animated Paint Program, NBA Jam, NFL Football Trivia Challenge, NFL's Greatest: San Francisco vs. Dallas, NHL Hockey '94, Night Trap, Novastorm, Panic!, Pitfall - The Mayan Adventure, Popful Mail, Power Monger, Prince of Persia, Prize Fighter, Puggsy, Racing Aces, Radical Rex, RDF - Global Conflict, Revenge of the Ninja, Revengers of Vengeance, Rise of the Dragon, Road Avenger, Road Rash, Robo Aleste, Samurai Shodown, The San Diego Zoo Presents...
