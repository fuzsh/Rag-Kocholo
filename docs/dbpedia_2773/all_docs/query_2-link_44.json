        "text": "username: It was never the most complex strategy game but I enjoyed Aerobiz Supersonic as there weren't exactly a ton of multiplayer strategy games available back then. The times I got to play it with others it got more heated than one would anticipate as putting low fare flights on your opponent's most profitable route to undercut them was almost always not appreciated.\n\nSniper Honeyviper: Spectacular shmuppy effort from Konami that samples a little from every popular STG at the time (mainly R-Type and Thunder Force) while remaining truly unique. Stages alternate between vertical and horizontal scrolling, and the vert sections take place on an interesting sort of Mode 7 conveyor belt. Every inspired, meticulously detailed setpiece feels different, with highlights including a Gundam space colony and a Sonic-esque casino city on Mars. There's close to nothing wrong with this game aside from some bouts of slowdown, and I can't recommend enough that you try it at least once.\n\nSniper Honeyviper: Gotta disagree about it being almost as good as Rondo. While the graphics have been osmosed onto the SNES quite well from a technical standpoint, the levels have a certain dullness to them that Rondo's don't, where you don't always really feel motivated to progress further, and there's a serious lack of variety and creativity inherent within. With so many excellent other classic-style entries in the Castlevania to choose from, you shouldn't bother with this one until you've seen everything else.\n\ngatotsu2501: Play the SNES (or VC) version if you possibly can. The PS1/PSN version is plagued with constant loading times, the DS version looks and sounds overly compacted and contains an overwrought and charmless retranslation despite some nice (and not-so-nice) bonus features, and frankly this is a game that deserves to be played on a large screen. Other than that, it's just as good as its reputation holds. It's one of the few JRPGs with truly taut pacing and consistent focus, never getting bogged down in excesses of filler or bullshit and constantly moving forward while still giving the player just enough freedom to explore and just enough of a sense that they're truly in control. A masterclass in form and a near-perfection of its genre, and yet it never feels like it's showing off. Chrono Trigger wants to be your friend, and if you have an ounce of heart in you then by the time the end credits roll you'll be more than happy to reciprocate.\n\nspectralsound: it's pretty much the same game mechanically, and the collect-a-thon bullshit is actually even worse. but what it does have going for it is some far wilder and darker worlds to play in, a slightly added emphasis on speed now that the lumbering gorilla is absent, and the second- or third-best SNES soundtrack of all time. the actual game itself is okay, i guess.\n\n108: In terms of story and general appeal, it's the best Dragon Quest game. Where Dragon Quest IV was “clever” by splitting the story into four parts that came together, Dragon Quest V is about one man's life, from his traumatic childhood as a poor boy, led around the world on a mysterious quest by his noble father. And before you know it, it's all about growing up, taking responsibility for one's legacy, and even starting a family. The Japanese version is as highly revered a Dragon Quest game as Final Fantasy VI is a Final Fantasy game. System-wise, it lets you capture and raise monsters as members of your party, which was said to be one of the inspirations for the Pokemon series of games. There is a PlayStation 2 remake by Arte Piazza and Matrix, and it looks wonderful and smooth, with a slowed down encounter rate and slightly better balanced experience and gold bonuses per battle. (Though there are some weird little issues, like being unable to adjust the message speed after starting the game.) As far as I'm concerned, Dragon Quest V is the best flat-out RPG experience on Super Famicom (not counting Mother 2, which is just something else), dated as the graphics might be. If you have an emulator, track down the English translation. Wonderful to play on PSP, that way.\n\nTalbain: What can be said about this game that hasn't already been said? It's pretty much an RPG that revolutionized thinking about RPGs. It made the abnormal normally accessible. It's hard to really describe this game unfortunately, other than generalizations which everyone's heard before. If I had to say what it is, I'd say to look for what it isn't and you'd begin to understand it.\n\nkerobaros: If you've ever wanted to play a mystery game that was worth a damn? Hunt this one down. Good luck doing so, as it only ever appeared on NoJ's Nintendo Power flash-cart system, but hey, it's worth it. Also, Demiforce released a translation patch a while back. Maybe slightly easier to play it that way. Either way, the story is.. twist-a-riffic, in a way Law and Order wishes it could be.\n\nBandanaBandelero: Between the emulation and Game Boy Advance routes, I am in the camp that doesn't see any need for the old american cartridge. The Game Boy Advance version's bugs, it seems to me, have been overstated. Sometimes a character will get a double turn. This happened to me maybe seven times in an entire 30-hour game. It has the best graphics of any version, though you might like some of the older character portraits better than the new ones. The translation is better for the most part. The challenge is just right. I also enjoyed the Sony PlayStation version for its accurate soundtrack emulation until my save file was somehow corrupted. On the Game Boy Advance the soundtrack just barely passes. Apparently the European Game Boy Advance version fixes some of the bugs, so you might want to try and nab that one if you go the portable route. The fan-translated hard type version is the best way to go if you want the nostalgic, more pure feel of the SNES version with a slightly better script and the added convenience/performance of playing on a PC or laptop.\n\nTOLLMASTER: RPGs cross a line where they stopped becoming games and started to become stories with games attached. Still holds up today because it took a lot of risks, and the risks that paid off standardized the JRPG genre for the PS1 Golden Era of JRPGs. Worth visiting for history's and nostalgia's sake, but seems awfully clunky now. Despite that, the Esper system is fun and the JRPG which standardized a story for the next console generalization largely did it right, especially for an age where plain text still took up significant amount of space on a ROM.\n\nFelix: This is probably the most seriously that Final Fantasy ever took itself (or was in a position to take itself), and it's sure impressive, but I've never found it as likable as what came before or after. It's not as straightforwardly fun or as foundational as the Sakaguchi SNES titles, and compared to Square's later SNES and early PSX releases, it's a little underwritten and unspectacular. I know that some of this was supposedly due to the localization, and I don't want to ignore that it was the first title in the series to have female leads and an ensemble cast and faithful representations of Amano's art and fairly weighty direction for 1994, but it's far from my favourite.\n\nTeflon: Front Mission: Gun Hazard is pretty spectacular. Platformer with a honest-to-god serious plot, often told by shit actually happening in-game (this does raise the problem of it being rather impossible to read text boxes and perform superhuman feats of mecha-control simultaneously but that's realism okay). It's also moody in a particularly gorgeous way. And of course it's a Front Mission game so you can nerd out on some robot parts (shotgun/punchyfist all day every day).\n\nstarblood: It has aged better in production values than Soul Blazer. It also came with a T-shirt, which as every Nintendo Power nerd can attest to, it was the coolest thing you can wear for school. Quintet at this point has mastered the template for what they wanted their future games to be like. It was really big in Europe, even though they used Time over Gaia at the end of the name, which is weird. Too bad the plot does not make much sense after the ship\n\nmisadventurous: I think A Link to the Past deserves a little more credit, here. The two-world concept was genuinely novel at the time, and I really enjoy the contrast created between the light world and the dark world. The dungeons are really solidly designed, clever & challenging without ever being too obtuse, and there is a decent amount of wiggle room in the main scenario. Newer Zelda games fall into a common JRPG trap of using the story to trap you in increasingly larger boxes, not letting you travel around as you like until the game is almost over, but back in the day the games were built to let you pretty much go where you wanted, only constraining you based on what treasures & tools you'd unearthed. I think ALttP is at the zenith of that “lock & key” design. The whole thing holds up really well even today, I don't think nostalgia has everything to do with its reputation at all. Also, Pegasus Boots > Epona.\n\ndessgeega: Libble Rabble is a dual-stick game designed by Toru Iwatani after Pac-Man success made him, temporarily, Namco's golden child. Instead of a game about shooting, like all of its dual-stick contemporaries, though, Libble Rabble is a game about gardening. Each stick controls a small marker, which can move autonomously, though they have a line strung between them which can wrap around posts planted in the field. The goal is to use the line to fence in and harvest struttin' mushrooms (Mushlins) while keeping the markers away from wandering baddies (Hoblins).\n\nLibble Rabble is a great game, and the [SNES] port is excellent.\n\nnegativedge: Very quick battles with enemies that are visible. Dungeons are action-puzzle based like a Zelda game, complete with items usable outside of battle (arrows, etc.). It has the monster recruitment of DQV (kind of). The game pretends the story is the same stupid JRPG story from a million other games (including the random dumb anime hero) but in reality its much more muted and grounds itself in reality a little bit. the result is something with some surprising depth and genuine emotion. and then you get a rogue-like tacked on in the form of an enormous bonus dungeon that is awesome.\n\nTORUMASUTA: I feel like [Mega Man X, and Mega Man X 2, are] the closest Capcom ever got to doing a Treasure game; not manic like Treasure's stuff, but good quality all around combined with a movement system where you had enough freedom that the game could punish you for misusing your freedom. I don't know why regular Mega Man plus clinging to walls plus dashing makes it that much better, but it DOES.\n\nKoji: Metal Combat really is pretty amazing, though it's hell of long. I mean, it has a plot twist (not that the plot matters or manages to catch one's attention) which makes the game twice as long as it should have been, which kind of sucks when you have to hold that uncomfortable bazooka. And darned batteries; if it weren't for them I'd play that or the Super Scope 6 games every now and then.\n\nGideon Zhi: Metal Max is an open, nonlinear RPG with a heavy focus on sidequests and tank tweaking. The main game has you chasing bounty heads and finding new vehicles for your entourage, but there’s so much other stuff to do! You can pimp your tanks with decals and accessories, you can buy furniture and wall hangings for your home, play with little critters that eat your money and grow to enormous proportions, or enjoy a host of minigames. Go hunting for this week’s target and become a rich and famous bounty hunter!\n\nSimon Belmont: I had save files for hundreds of games on my old computer, but it's the Metal Max Returns save that I mourn for the most. I'm not sure what other games I could compare it to; it's a weird blend of Western and Eastern game design philosophy in one Mad Max inspired setting. On a Venn diagram with “Wasteland”, “SaGa Frontier” and “Gran Turismo”, Metal Max Returns would occupy the space where those three games intersect.\n\n?: Metal Max is Romancing SaGa except the emphasis on random techniques is now on CUSTOMIZING TANKS. You find strange vehicles, equip them with strange weapons, and fight the absolute weirdest enemies ever found in a JRPG. Like it sounds, it's a Mad Max parody, except it doesn't care so much about being a parody of an Australian wasteland movie and more wants you to have fun in a JRPG environment. If the “bad” part about JRPGs is the grind, why not make battles fun, and then make them the main part of the game? You can equip your tanks to fulfil different roles to take down certain enemies, you eventually need to be careful about proper Special Weapon and Main Cannon ammo usage, and instead of just pre-set boss battles, you'll find bosses right on the world map in random encounters who are worth bounties once turned in.\n\nTORUMASUTA: A rare (if not singular) example of a Western company not only learning lessons from the guys on the other side of the Pacific, but actually building onto those fundamental foundations, and creating an entirely different game. While you can see where Metal Warriors lifted ideas from Assault Suits Valken/Cybernator and Front Mission: Gun Hazard, they put those ideas in the context of an almost puzzle-like gameplay where you could switch mecha multiple times through the stage to meet different obstacles with different approaches.\n\nq 3: Ninja Warriors Again is a side-scrolling beat'em up with lots of style and lots of stylish moves, a sequel of sorts to the ancient Taito arcade game. It was released in the U.S. as “The Ninjawarriors” but the female ninja enemies were removed and the story (all two paragraphs of it) was toned down — now your mission is not to assassinate the evil dictator, but merely depose him.\n\nmothmanspirit: I like Nosferatu, which is like Prince of Persia but you punch werewolves. It has a sort of industrial soundtrack that doesn't sound much like any other 16-bit game - I can't find my favorite track off of it, but I promise it's there, in the second part of the first level I think.\n\nTalbain: I loved this game for the potential challenges, potential flexibility, and potential gameplay more than anything else. It was the first game where I really got the concept in my head that the user should have ultimate control over a great deal of what goes on around them and their characters. I think that's why I'm so adamant, is because this game really introduced me to aspects of customization with certain limitations.\n\nBroco: Yeah, Shadowrun SNES has some of the sweetest isometric artwork. It really makes the world feel substantial. It seemed like they spent a lot of time building a cool semi-open world to explore and populated it with this stuff, but on the other hand the gunplay seemed to have been tacked on at the last minute. It's awkward to control and hitscan-based — which makes some encounters feel unfair — and weirdly lacking in visual impact. It has some elements of a classic though, I carried for years a vague memory of awesomeness after renting it for a day as a kid.\n\nAutomaticTiger: The inexplicable lineage of Wonder Boy gets even stranger, as hudson decides to take their divergent spinoff series back to the series that inspired it, and completely rip off the action adventure format of latter day Wonder Boy games. The weird part is, Super Adventure Island 2 is one of the best wonder boy style games ever made. The criss crossing roads across a tropical archipelago with fun jumping puzzles and chunky combat. Who knows why this game exists, but I'm glad it does.\n\nBandanaBandelero: For me this is one of those weird games that can be quite difficult (in the later stages, and there's also a few tricky timed jumps), but when I get in the proper groove/mood I can make my way easily enough. Eh, perhaps the same could be said of all religions? But more than any other game I can think of this is one where I can really suck at in one attempt, but then play brilliantly in another instance as if I somehow spiritually meld with the whole thing. Oh christ, this is lame… Which brings me to my next point: Don't smoke crack. Uh, yeah, so…the soundtrack in this one is magic! The ending theme is how a fucking Castlevania ending theme should be. It's really emotional and cathartic.\n\nCubaLibre: I actually think SMRPG is probably a contender for best JRPG. People remember it fondly as charming and cute and so forth but I think it's also eminently playable and briskly, minorly challenging the way a good JRPG should be. It and Chrono Trigger are probably the only JRPGs I'd pick up and replay for fun (not counting Earthbound and Mother 3, which are sort of different beasts).\n\nTake It Sleazy: Despite being completely worthless because it doesn't have the real underground theme, the level and depth and intelligence at play here is incredible. The fact that there is even an argument about whether it is better than Mario 3 shows the level of love and care on display. A work of genius that is to date still smarter and more complex than 90% of the 2D platformers that came after it.\n\nmisadventurous: completely disagree about the physics. i wish this game demanded more of the player more often, because i think it's a collection of some of the most deliciously satisfying mechanics ever devised for a videogame. there is such a tight degree of control over Mario at all times that masterful high-level play is almost addictively satisfying. this is a game begging for virtuoso romhackers to pull a Lost Levels on it. the thing itself is pretty solid, so long as you're shooting for unlocking all the goals. i think the “normal” playthrough is about the most boringly sleepwalky Mario scenario ever devised up until about Chocolate Island, the game squirrels away its best levels in the secret areas and opening up the world yourself through finding those secrets is highly satisfying. this is, for better or for worse, the game i think of when i think of the SNES.\n\nTORUMASUTA: Yoshi's Island is brilliant and taught me a lot about proper level design. It also looks like no other game out there. It's a Super Mario exploration type game, except the puzzles are integrated into the levels rather than it being something like “level, puzzle, level” if that makes any sense. Like, the level will have a “theme” and figuring out how that “theme” works is itself the puzzle, it's not “here are some fucking Goombas and halfway through, OH GOD THERE IS A KEYHOLE YOU BETTER GET ON THAT SHIT.” And the aiming of egg shots made it a Mario game with action elements, which worked surprisingly well. Maybe Nintendo needs to give Mario Mario to Epic Games and put him in Super Mario Galaxy of War\n\nBroco: In some ways it holds up as a seminal and polished game, but it's the Metroid I enjoy the least personally. […] The first two Metroids are these really grim, harsh, lonely mazes and there's a real satisfaction to getting further in them. In the name of polish and accessibility, Super Metroid sort of lost that edge. On the other hand, it's not nearly as streamlined as Metroid Fusion is (Fusion's pacing and controls are improved). So it's kind of in this awkward halfway point that doesn't really let it hold up as the best at anything in particular in the series (except possibly some kind of sense of “epicness”).\n\nRT-55J: basically the Anti-Turrican. Gone are any vestiges of the series' large, maze-like levels. In their place is a linear action game that competently apes the Konami's situation-rushes of the day. The result is marked improvement over Mega Turrican, which was already going in that direction anyway. The weapons feel balanced, the grappling hook is no longer cripplingly unwieldy, and the setpieces don't need to be forgivingly idealized. The bosses are rather impressive, with the spider and the final boss being the standouts.\n\nionustron: the game just feels completely depressing and uneven, almost like it should've ended when you restored humans. Really the HG101 article explains it much better than I could, the game just takes a nosedive at that point. I do intend to complete it, but… man, the second half game does alot of things that seem wonderful until you try them. Just needed much more time to bake.\n\nBroco: I don't know, I found Terranigma really tedious after about 5-6 hours of play. I tried twice but never managed to get through it. The fighting is repetitive and not as viscerally satisfying as e.g. Secret of Mana, and doing silly subquests for the animal kingdom gets boring fast. The story is pretty weak in my opinion, and the English localization is terrible. (That font!)\n\nDark Age Iron Saviour: It's a very good game, quite possibly the fullest of the titles Quintet has made. I kind of wish I could tell you non-Terranigma-having-played guys all the neat things you should do one way or another to maximize the gaming experience - there aren't actually that many, but they're pretty much all spoilers. That said, in Chapter 3, don't go to Mosque until you've talked to a chicken and fought a ghost and enjoyed the subsequent reward!"
