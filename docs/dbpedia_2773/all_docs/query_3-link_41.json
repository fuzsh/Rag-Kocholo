        "text": "Hello gentle readers, and welcome to the SwitchArcade Round-Up for May 8th, 2024. In today’s article, we arrive at another usual Wednesday. We’ve got a few half-decent new releases to look at, a little treat for the bins, and the usual lists of new and outgoing sales. Quite a lot of outgoing sales, as the Golden Week sales wrap up tomorrow. Well, sometimes it’s nice to chill out a bit before those big Thursday releases come in, don’t you think? Let’s chill.\n\nNew Releases\n\nPac-Man Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs ($19.99)\n\nAnother Stadia game rises from the ashes, and this time it’s the Pac-Man Battle Royale game. No, not Pac-Man 99. That’s still dead. This is the one for up to sixty-four players that involves more direct competition. Looks fun enough, I suppose. This is the regular edition, following on last week’s early access release of the Deluxe Edition. It’s a little cheaper, but you don’t get a Klonoa hat. So, choices.\n\nThe Night of the Rabbit ($19.99)\n\nAnother one of Daedalic’s old point-and-clickers makes its way to the Switch. Well, is it actually old? It’s from 2013. Yes, I suppose it is. Sigh. Anyway, this one uses classic children’s story books as a source of inspiration, but puts the usual Daedalic spin on things. It’s been a really long time since I played this one, but I remember it being pretty decent. If you like your adventure games and aren’t completely turned off by Daedalic’s house style, I think you’ll have a good time with it.\n\nThe Prisoner of the Night ($14.99)\n\nA little girl stuck in an eternal night must run and jump her way through over a hundred and fifty stages of platforming action. You’ll gain special skills along the way, and you’ll have to deal with the occasional light puzzle. It’s all steeped in Brazilian folklore too, apparently. That sounds pretty cool. This has been available on Steam for a few years, and the general vibe over there is positive on it. Just be warned that it’s a relatively challenging game.\n\nThe Bin Bunch\n\nKing of Pyramid Thieves ($3.99)\n\nSales\n\n(North American eShop, US Prices)\n\nLook, it’s not the worst list of new sales. Blossom Tales II at the lowest price yet! With that said, it certainly pales in comparison to what is going on in the outbox. Sure, there will be another big sale next month, maybe even this month, but that doesn’t mean all of those games will be part of it. Check the list, check your wishlist, check whatever, but buy what you want while you can.\n\nSelect New Sales\n\nPromesa ($2.49 from $4.99 until 5/11)\n\nCuccchi ($3.99 from $7.99 until 5/11)\n\nWill
