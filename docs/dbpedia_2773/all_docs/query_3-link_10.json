        "text": "Makes me wish they just put all 6 into 1 package. Not like these games take up much memory and having 2 separate collections made is an odd choice for such a niche series.\n\nSeems especially weird the 2 collections have one of the same games but with different engines.... not putting this all into one big collection definitely seems like a bit of a fail.\n\nI noticed the games from the first collection were also released individually on Switch but I'm not sure which ports they are.\n\n@FX29 I agree. Look at the TMNT Cowabunga Collection with 13 games in one, plus online functionality and extras, for 40 bucks. That is how it is done (assuming they don't screw it up between now and then).\n\nThis, and the Turrican collections just totally turned me off. I will wait, and if nothing comes, just spend my money on something more satisfactory.\n\nEdit: though it stings a little because I'd love to play the PC Engine version of Valis IV.\n\nI think this demonstrates a lot of contempt for fans, especially for such old and obscure games. There are no excuses for this not being an all-in-one collection, even if it cost, say, $10 or so more.\n\nAnd the fewer cartridges, the better. I don't know if there is a limit as to how many icons a Switch cartridge can spawn (if any), but the Atelier Mysterious Trilogy cartridge spawns no less than six icons (3 games + 3 digital artbooks). The Doraemon education collection spawns four, and I have a few others that spawn three each.\n\n@daveMcFlave\n\nExactly, if it were a more popular franchise like Mega Man for example which had 2 separate collections made I can understand. Since most fans will end up buying both regardless.\n\nBut for Valis which is relatively obscure in the West it makes no sense to split the games into 2 collections.\n\nWhy are all these not in the same collection? They're literally just smaller size roms and why is the Super NES version of Super Valis IV still not included in any of the collection? When the TMNT collection, Capcom fighting collection, and Namco Museum collection could give us well over 10+ retro games for a value price, having only 3 roms per cartridge is just terrible. These are terrible collections especially when there's only one good game per collection.\n\nThe first I did not get because it was not on cartridge\n\nSo if this is not on cartridge again I won't be getting it.\n\nFunnily enough, I played through the MD version of Valis today on Evercade. It's a pretty fun game, with great music (although there were some sound issues on the Evercade) but movement is too slow and the dialogue in the cut scenes moves at a ridiculously slow rate. Still, it's one of 12 games (including Valis 3) in a physical collection that costs Â£17.99, so it feels like a better value proposition than these releases.\n\nSooooo.... They wanted to just overprice out selections of the Valis series instead of just hitting with it all at once with a reasonable price? I mean damn, all they had to do was pull a Konami Collection stunt and most of us would be good... Was that so hard?"
