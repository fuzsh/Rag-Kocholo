        "text": "@roco32373 Can you show me anything, anywhere that 100% of people were happy/positive or unhappy/negative about? The only thing you can do is try and decide for yourself. Either ignore everyone elses opinion from scratch and go with your own feeling or take in other peoples feedback knowing that a few or even a lot possibly aren't accurate and try to sort through it all, forming a decision as best you can from what you have heard, read and seen.\n\nMy best advice. Stick to your own mind. You know what type of game you like to play. How you want to interract with other people and environments. Find game footage (youtube etc. of game sessions. Eventually when the NDA is lifted, watch stream or videos from more varied play. Learn what you can and decide. People will always have polar opposite views, just like with anything else. Be it food, fashion, movies, music, religion, politics, MARMITE!! some will sing somethings praises and rave about how good it is while others will damn it for eternity and rage about how bad it is. Only you will know where you stand on the spectrum.\n\nOnly you know how much anything about the game matters to you. Whether about how it does on XBOX or if the the chickens are indeed better than the snakes. All you can do is try and base you decision on information you look for and find. (Be slightly more wary of any that is volunteered from either side, as bias may be attached).\n\nDefinitely don't spend money if you aren't sure. I pre-ordered because it ticked the necessary boxes for me. I weighed up info I found about the game and I got to experience the Alpha. I was happy to invest in the game. That may well not be the case for you. Read the forums, there are many people who elequently put forward their opinions both negative and positive. Never feel pressured to buy or avoid something. You are the king of your own castle matey. ;)\n\n@roco32373\n\nI don't think the game will be a \"huge\" hit. It's not a Call of Duty or a Halo. It has more of a niche audience. I think for what it is, it will sell well and if critic/users scores are good, it might sell even better. The cartoony artstyle alone (which I enjoy) is going to immediately put people off from the start.\n\nI don't feel this is a \"make or break\" title for xbox. MS isn't like Sony - it doesn't need it's console division to stay afloat. Besides, MS seems to be focusing on xbox the service more than xbox the console. Xbox the console might be doomed regardless. Xbox the brand however, will still be going strong.\n\n@Roco32373 Sea of Thieves tanking won't doom Xbox for this generation. It might end up with Rare being downsized or shuddered. But it won't doom the entire division. The dozens of other games coming to the Xbox platform will continue to bring in more than sufficient revenue for Microsoft. Though yet another poor game, and from a first party developer, could easily effect that revenue by causing gamers with multiple gaming platforms to decide to spend their gaming budgets on one of their other platforms. As well as cause gamers that were contemplating buying an Xbox system to forgo that purchase and/or acquire a competitors system.\n\nNow if Sea of Thieves is lackluster or completely bombs on PC, it'll just be yet another black spot on Microsoft's continued attempts to be seen as a viable option for PC gamers.\n\n@erikinthebakery If you look at the company that is paying for it to happen... its Microsoft. So it could be considered a Microsoft exclusive... Im a PC Gamer and Xbox, and I know a few PS gamers that do not have PC. Actually there are a lot of console players that do not have a gaming PC. A lot of people are going to tablets over Desktop or Laptops now unless they are enthusiasts... and I am.\n\nIm not buying that c**p that says if its \"play anywhere\" means its not an exclusive. Microsoft is getting paid regardless if its PC or Console (or Play Anywhere now) so the Exclusive is where the money goes in my mind, and I get to chose where I want to play it as well.\n\n@h0rse Very true. I saw a Youtube video complaining about \"Play Anywhere\" because they say it makes XBOX not have any real exclusives. I like the Play Anywhere because there are times Id rather be at my computer while i take care of some tasks and other times just relaxing on my couch at the TV. I am definitely at my computer more than my television though. Now I have the choice to play wherever I am and keep my progression on xbox and pc alike.\n\nElite Dangerous is going to be Play Anywhere as well but since I have it on steam from years ago, I have to stay on the PC to play it... and the progression can not be transferred to Xbox either so I have to start over on that oneif I decide I want to make it another Play Anywhere title in my games library.\n\nThat is why PLAY ANYWHERE can be considered a exclusive in my eyes. :)\n\nHappy New Year Everyone!\n\n@biggx01\n\nIt's an argument for the sake of arguing. Yeah, technically xbox has no console exclusives, but they are still exclusive to xbox since xbox the service is needed to play them.\n\nThe argument seems to be that since you can get MS exclusives on both PC and xbox, it makes having an xbox pointless. It's a sloppy argument, since for it to apply, someone would need to own both an xbox and/or a gaming PC, supposedly rending the xbox moot, and as you pointed out, a lot of console gamers don't also have a gaming rig, nor do they want one. Going off that, the majority of xbox players are still going to buy the xbox version and still buy the next xbox that comes out.\n\nPlay Anywhere is a godsend for people like you and me, that have both platforms. It's a non-issue if you own just one or the other, which many do.\n\n@biggx01 said in Does the Xbox need this game to do well sales-wise? I’m already hearing some negative feedback...?:\n\n@erikinthebakery If you look at the company that is paying for it to happen... its Microsoft. So it could be considered a Microsoft exclusive...

I would say it has more to do with the fact that both Windows 10 and Xbox are MS platforms, and you have to play it through the Xbox app, but I would say it is definitely an exclusive.\n\nSome people like to complain, though."
