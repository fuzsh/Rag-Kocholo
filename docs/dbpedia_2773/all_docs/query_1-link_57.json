        "text": "As you might imagine, in the midst of COVID-19’s grasp, there is very little going on out there in the world for in-person video game conventions and swaps. All the wonderful summer plans for travelling around the province in search of some elusive titles are cancelled, and that’s perfectly fine by me as long as people are safe and sound at home, where they should be. These cancellations have left me with very few options for game collecting, but I’ve managed to find some good deals online and keep things rolling, albeit at a snail’s pace, compared to usual.\n\nThe first few games I picked up were for the Game Boy and Game Boy Colour. The first is a Japanese copy of Rockman World 4, which for all intents and purposes is exactly the same as the English version of Mega Man IV, but significantly less expensive. The Mega Man games on Game Boy are typically mashups of the NES titles, with the exception of Mega Man V which is its own standalone game. And if you know me even a little bit by now, you know I love Peanuts and the characters a ton… Snoopy Tennis for GBC was something I couldn’t resist. It’s actually a very competent Tennis game, and while I haven’t played a lot of them, I could definitely win a few matches here. That says something!\n\nContinuing in the handhelds department, I finally (finally!!!) found a copy of Castlevania II: Belmont’s Revenge for the Game Boy. I’ve been wanting to find it for so long and I got one for a really good price online with a bunch of other games. I was surprised since it wasn’t a North American site I was buying from but it was the US cartridge, so I scooped it up. I got most of the way through the game up to the second-to-last boss and got wrecked… I’ll have to try it again soon and get that sweet win. Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles III: Radical Rescue was a game recommended to me by a friend that apparently plays like a Metroidvania game, and loving Game Boy and those kinds of adventures, I couldn’t stay away. I haven’t played it too much yet, but it does seem like a great game that I’m interested in trying some more.\n\nBravely Second for the Nintendo 3DS was also suggested to me as a must-have by a friend. I picked up the first game recently and the second one here came to me sealed from The Great Internets. I don’t know when I’ll get around to playing it any time soon, but seeing that the series is touted as one of the best RPG series of all time, I might have to move them up the list.\n\nI put out a video recently talking about how Life Force for NES is essentially a great model for the immune system, and in the comments section, lots of people were asking if I’d ever played Abadox since it’s apparently really similar. I’m terrible at shooters and I’m sure that hell will freeze over before I get any better at them, but I decided to pick this up anyway. It’s a little ugly and I have to give it a good cleaning. That yellowing on the right side is some dried glue of sorts, and the label’s pretty grimy as well. Otherwise though, it’s in great shape.\n\nAfter playing Lizard for NES recently and loving it, I had a few other new NES homebrew games recommended to me to try. I picked up Micro Mages and Twin Dragons, both of which are still wrapped up nicely since I haven’t had a chance to try them out yet. They’re both able to be played on original hardware, so I’m looking forward to seeing what these are both all about.\n\nMickey Mania for SNES was a gift from a dear friend that I wasn’t particularly seeking out, but considering my deep love for Mickey Mouse games, I honestly can’t wait to give this one a spin. I grew up with World of Illusion on Sega Genesis and have really enjoyed other games like Land of Illusion, as well as another Mickey Mouse SNES game with the tremendously long title that I can never remember. It’s a great addition to the collection and was well-loved by the previous owner. I’m honoured to have it!\n\nI couldn’t get away with a collecting post without showing off some more Master System. Robocop Versus the Terminator is pretty decent despite a bit of a choppier pace than its Sega Genesis counterpart, and Star Wars is probably the smoothest of the bunch. Double Dragon is… well… interesting. The NES port looks a lot more playable and the soundtrack is undeniably better there too. The SMS version plays a little closer to the Atari 2600 one… I don’t have regrets buying it, but it’s an experience. I’ll just leave it at that.\n\nGhostbusters for the Master System came to me in relatively good shape. It’s a slightly better version of the same game that was released for the NES, mainly because of its superior stair-climbing section near the end that isn’t an abomination like its Nintendo brother. It still plays the Ghostbusters theme nonstop though, and it doesn’t sound quite as good as the NES version… uh oh.\n\nThe Newzealand Story, also known as Kiwi Kraze for other releases, is another PAL-exclusive Master System game that I actually didn’t realize won’t run properly on an NTSC system. I thankfully had a third party power base converter to try on my Sega Genesis on hand, and it works just fine that way. Something in the NTSC Master System causes a few PAL games to be region-locked, and this is one of them. Either way, this game is in gorgeous condition, especially the manual that’s still white rather than yellowish like some of the other ones I’ve come across lately. I’ll probably play this one with the volume low because the frantic music here is quite distracting, but the cuteness shall always prevail.\n\nI mentioned earlier how awful I am at shooters, and yet there were several of those purchased for the Master System that I’ve had my eye on for a while now. The first is Scramble Spirits, which I was secretly hoping would be more in the vein of something like Avenging Spirit, but instead is just a neat little middle-of-the-road shooter game with a cool soundtrack. The sound effects are a bit grating, but all in all, it looks rather promising. I got destroyed in the first few stages, but hopefully I’ll be able to get somewhere with a bit of practice. Despite being in relatively good shape, a manual was nowhere to be found.\n\nAh yes, more shooters! Sagaia is a port of Darius II for the Master System, and it’s a tough, tough game. I don’t think I got very far into stage two before I had to quietly turn it off and vow to come back to it another time with my obliterated pride reassembled, but it’s a very sought-after title that I’m glad I now own for the system. I’m okay not owning the manual for this one, but it would’ve been nice to find it complete.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog Chaos is a PAL-exclusive game that is relatively difficult to come by for a good price, but I’ve often heard it touted as one of the best Sonic games on the Master System. Grabbing this one with its manual was a real bright point for me in these new additions since I love Sonic, but have yet to experience many of the games on the SMS. I’m really looking forward to trying this one out further than the first level.\n\nAh yes. The game with one of the most horrible soundtracks in the entire history of time, and some of the most confusing title screen music has finally weaseled its way into my collection. Bram Stoker’s Dracula was released for other consoles as well, but the Master System version spoke to me when I was recently playing through many, many other Dracula-centric games like some from the Castlevania series. It seems like a competent enough platformer with some interesting graphics, but it’s pretty unforgiving from what I’ve played of it so far. The manual’s a little beat up, but it’s because it’s so thick and doesn’t fit well inside the case’s clips. Those PAL manuals man… they’re beefy with the 8 or so languages they’re published in!\n\nMore shooters, you say? Why yes. R-Type’s release on the Master System came to me with a cool Sega for the 90s sticker stuck onto the label, and the game art glued to the box like some horrible monstrosity. The outside plastic is missing altogether and there’s no way that art is coming back off again, so it’s an ugly little mess on the shelf (don’t even look at the right edge and corners to see how crooked it is…) but at least I can get myself exploded a little more. As if I haven’t suffered enough already!\n\nLast but not least is one of the disappointments of the lot, a Sega Card version of Bank Panic. I didn’t own this game in cartridge form at all, and seeing the card option was something I thought would be a neat addition to the collection. Unfortunately, no matter how hard I cleaned it up, it still won’t play. I know the card slot is working because I have several other games that work first try, and I even tried it on a few different consoles. I think it’s completely dead, and that makes me sad. I don’t have the heart to give up yet, so I’ll hang onto it for now and continue to try to think of ways to bring it back to life.\n\nAnd well, that’s just about that. This is obviously several months of collecting, so I’m thinking these posts will continue to be fewer and further between with the state of things out there in the world. Hopefully you’ve all been keeping well, staying safe, and playing some great games.\n\nThank you for reading, as always!\n\n-GG\n\nI very recently opened up a PO Box, and a few people kindly asked to send a few packages my way. I was thrilled to be the recipient of some new games and I wanted to showcase them here. I’ve also been scouring some local stores and online sites for more stuff too, so buckle in for a wild ride!\n\nFirst up is Lizard for NES. It’s a homebrew game from 2018, and the creator, who found me on Twitch and has been a regular viewer since, gifted a copy to me. I recently played through it on stream, and it was a really fun little adventure that really got the wheels in my head spinning while trying to figure out some puzzles and mastering the landscapes. I haven’t played a lot of homebrew games, but I can definitely vouch for the quality of this one. Another thing I appreciated was that the cartridges are all brand new versus being made from destroying existing cartridges. There’s more information on the game’s website if you are even remotely interested, and the game is also available digitally if you prefer that avenue.\n\nThe same person was also kind enough to send me a reproduction copy of Sweet Home for NES. This is a fairly well-known horror RPG from the 8-bit generation that was a Japan exclusive, but the fan translation has been repackaged into a cart and sold with a box for people that want that experience. I was happy to take this off his hands since I don’t tend to emulate very often, nor do I own any kind of Everdrive-like device for the NES to play translation patched roms. I hope to play this in the coming months!\n\nAt the thrift store, I came across a copy of Pirates! for NES. This is one I’ve been wanting to play for a long time, and it’s an open-world game where you go to different places and either pillage or team up with different people. I would’ve loved to have found a manual too, but I’m hoping there’ll be a scan online to see what the details are all about. I also love pirates and pirate media, so it’s right up my alley.\n\nA glorious purchase from eBay was made! I finally own a Famicom copy of Faxanadu, my favourite game! This version has the religious censorship removed and you’re able to name the hero, and although I think most of the main game is the same, these small changes might make my next playthrough a little bit more interesting. I also love the cartridge colours and design. It’s so different from the North American version’s art!\n\nI also picked up PAL Game Boy games, The Smurfs and Kirby’s Block Ball. The Smurfs looks like a pretty competent platformer, and I was also really impressed by Kirby’s Block Ball. It’s essentially a more advanced version of Arkanoid/Break Out with extra elements like a charge mode to break through different kinds of blocks. I can’t wait to spend more time with both of these.\n\nA wonderful stream viewer sent me Wario Land II and Wario Land 3 for Game Boy and Game Boy Color! I was really touched, and given that I just finished Virtual Boy Wario Land lately, I’m curious to see how the series evolved and changed with the latter installments. Apparently these two games are quite different from the ones that came before them and really shuffled the formula up in a lot of ways. I’m honoured to have these as part of my collection.\n\nStaying in the handheld realm, I picked up what I thought was a legitimate copy of Doom II for the Game Boy Advance, only to get it home and realize that it was a bootleg. I think this game is very uncommon and it would’ve been pretty unlikely to find it at a thrift store, but luckily I got a refund for it and had an opportunity to educate the store on what to look for in fake games. I asked to hang onto it since I can’t imagine ever finding a legitimate copy, but more importantly, I didn’t want them trying to sell the game to anyone else. I also really liked the little protective case that came with it!\n\nIn what is supposed to be part 1 of 2 of a shipment, a good online friend sent me a few things, the first of which is the manual for Out of This World for Super Nintendo. The game is supposed to come whenever she can send out another shipment, but you all know how much I love my manuals! I’m really grateful to have this!\n\nAfter discovering the fantastic experience of Katamari Damacy, I was hoping I’d run into other games with a similar theme of casual collecting of environmental objects for a larger purpose. Tornado Outbreak for the Wii captured my interest because not only is it exactly that, but there’s a totally different feel to this game that involves destruction. You pull things up and away, but you also tear buildings apart piece by piece to flatten them. It’s not as charming as Katamari by a long stretch, but I look forward to giving it a go!\n\nThese were more gifts from the same person who sent me the Out of This World manual. Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World, Bleach: Shattered Blade and Link’s Crossbow Training are all great additions to the collection, and everything came to me in great shape. The top two games also had their manuals included, which is always a plus! I didn’t even realize Tales of Symphonia had a sequel and know virtually nothing about Bleach, but that’s the beauty of this kind of gift! They’re always full of surprises.\n\nI can’t have a new games post without including a little Master System, and this time I found myself a copy of Dynamite Duke. This cover art has cracked me up more than it probably should, but it was a steal for a complete-in-box game. It’s in pretty good shape overall!\n\nI don’t usually pick up too many Game Gear games, but these two I couldn’t pass up on. The first is an action RPG for the system called Ax Battler that is either loved or hated depending on who you speak to, and the second is Revenge of Drancon. Never heard of that one? Me either until I found out that it’s actually Wonder Boy! It has a different name in some places and for some systems apparently(?) and I had no idea that they were the same game until I got it home and popped it in. Here I thought I’d found some cool new RPG for sale, but nope!\n\nA dear friend sent me her Saturn stuff since she lost her console in a flood, and the first game she put in the mail for me was Shining Wisdom. I do have a copy of this one already but the disc doesn’t run the greatest. I’m hoping this copy might fare a bit better, and it’s always great to have a backup in case the worst happens when I finally get around to playing this one.\n\nAnother Saturn game she sent my way was Virtua Fighter 2. I wonder if this was a pack-in with a console since it’s a Not for Resale version or if there’s some other story here. I’ve played a bit of the first game and it seemed like a pretty decent fighting game, so I’ll be curious to give this one a whirl as well. They’re both in lovely shape too!\n\nGuardian Heroes for Sega Saturn also came from my friend and looks to be a really cool game! I hadn’t heard of it before it was on its way to me, but it’s apparently a beat-em-up with RPG elements, maybe in the same kind of vein as River City Ransom? I’m not entirely sure, but what I’ve seen of the gameplay looks pretty different from what I’m used to playing. I’m excited for this one! Unfortunately it didn’t come along with its manual, but the disc is in relatively good condition!\n\nOne of the most anticipated things I had coming my way was Castlevania: Symphony of the Night for the Playstation 1. This is a game I’ve only been able to dream of owning since finding out about it and finally delving into the Castlevania series late in 2018. It is apparently the best of the best! I’m still missing quite a few Castlevania games to be able to call collecting for that series complete, but this definitely checks off a significant item on the list.\n\nI’m not too familiar with Naruto, but a friend sent me this Playstation 2 game praising its awesomeness and told me that I’d enjoy it whether or not I’m into the show. I’ll have to take her word for it!\n\nSonic’s Ultimate Genesis Collection for Playstation 3 also came in the mail, and I’m absolutely thrilled to own a copy of this game. I loooove Sonic and have played Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Genesis to death throughout my life. I just recently finished Sonic 1 again for the second time, and now more than ever I’m looking to get into latter games in the series. I had a copy of this for another console (maybe PS2?) and it used to freeze on me constantly. I never did figure out how to get that up and running, so I’m hoping this version works swimmingly!\n\nLast but not least is something near and dear to me: A King’s Quest V hint book. I adore King’s Quest V so much. It was my first saunter into Sierra games and I played it on the NES first. I have yet to play the PC version, but anticipation of getting to that some day, a friend of mine was kind enough to send along a second copy of the hint book to me so that I could have it. I know that game pretty well so it’s a hint book I’d love to sit down and actually read through to see if there’s anything I’ve ever missed in the game. I am so thrilled to have a copy of this, and it’s in perfect condition. So lovely!\n\nAnd that just about does it for the moment. I can’t say enough how grateful I am to have people in my life that want to share parts of their past with me in the form of pieces of their video game collection. I’m honoured to be able to have the opportunity to play these games and appreciate them! Thanks to everyone that sent anything out my way.\n\nAs always, thanks for reading!\n\n-GG\n\nThe classifieds in my area seem to be drier than a desert these days, and consequently many of my purchases have come from various online sources instead. Let’s go!\n\nFirst up are some loose Sega Master System games. Tom & Jerry: The Movie was something I took a bit of a gamble on knowing nothing about it before buying, but it does seem like an interesting game. It’s a weird puzzle platformer where you have to keep Tom out of the way of terrible obstacles that Jerry can easily avoid. I’m not sure if you’re trying to catch Jerry or what since I haven’t had a chance to track down and read the manual yet. Arcade Smash Hits was intriguing, and it has Breakout and a few other arcade games on it! It has what I’d consider a great soundtrack too… very club/techno vibes, which was surprising. Breakout was one of my favourite games to play for the VIC 20 growing up, so it was really fun playing through a few levels when I was testing this game out. Marble Madness is another game I don’t think I own for any other system, so it’s just about time I give it a whirl. I’m pretty sure I died almost instantly testing it out. Marble Madness was definitely in the worst shape of the three with a bit of label damage, but nothing too major.\n\nI also rolled the dice on this copy of the PAL-exclusive Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Sega Master System. It was dirt cheap and in beautiful condition, but from what I understand, not all variants of this game will play on an NTSC system. I was overwhelmed with relief trying this one out, and it also came with the manual too. It’s in absolutely wonderful shape. I’m very happy with it. I’m pretty sure it’s the same as the Game Gear version.\n\nRampart for the Master System was not something I ever thought I’d go out of my way to get. I own a copy for the NES, and I wasn’t sure what drew me to this other version apart from it being available at a price I couldn’t pass up on, and now it lives in my house with me and all the other Master System games I’ve snatched up lately. It was pristine in terms of its condition. It looks like It’s never been played.\n\nAfter having luck getting my hands on a copy of Strider a post or two ago, Strider II magically came up complete in box not too long afterward. The cover is way cooler than the first game’s and Strider II seems like an interesting adventure. I played for about 20 minutes and found myself mostly jump-floating between battles in my leotard. I’m sure it’ll make for a great time when I can give it some more attention.\n\nWorld Class Leader Board is one of my very favourite golf games. I used to play the heck out of the DOS game when I was little, and seeing that they kept the draw-in of trees and other things on the courses for the Master System version made me grin from ear to ear. What a delight it will be to play through this again after all these years, even if it’s in a different format. I’m anxious to see if there are any voice clips too. I want to hear all about tree hitting and people saying “awwwww” when I miss a putt from less than 12 inches away.\n\nA friend was extremely generous and sent me two Master System manuals that I was missing! I have Action Fighter with the box and game and just a loose copy of Space Harrier, so it was very nice to be able to make my collection slightly more complete through his generosity. He mentioned he’s had these for over two decades, and I’m honoured he thought of me to give them both a good home.\n\nI was also able to make a fantastic Sega Genesis purchase through a friend I’ve met through streaming. We made a really nice deal on Dynamite Headdy, Castlevania Bloodlines, Truxton, and Wings of Wor. I never thought I’d own Truxton or Castlevania, and now here we are! I was really excited to try them all out a little while back, and Wings of Wor, a horizontal shooter, was certainly a captivating surprise I wasn’t expecting. I hope to sit down with it again soon!\n\nWhile sitting in on a stream of Wonder Boy in Monster World a few weeks ago, someone in chat casually mentioned Chiki Chiki Boy, a game that is aesthetically similar. I had a look online to see if there were any copies available and ended up getting one for myself. It looks really unique and quirky, but most of all, it’s a gorgeous game. I can’t get over how bright and colourful the graphics are. The cartridge itself isn’t in the best of shape, but at least it was well-loved. I’m happy to give it a place on my shelf.\n\nWhen I was ordering a few games off of a website I’ve been frequenting, I saw a copy of Incoming for the Dreamcast for a few dollars. I know absolutely nothing about this game but I’ve barely bought any Dreamcast stuff over the past few years except a handful of games and couldn’t pass up on a deal like this.\n\nI’ve also been rounding out more of my Game Boy collections. Buffy the Vampire Slayer for Game Boy Color looked so funny when I watched some game footage. Essentially you flip all over the place and beat up vampires with kicks and punches to wear them down, and then stake them to turn them into dust. It’s also full of these cutscenes from the show, which make for some good comedy. I’m not super familiar with the television series, but I know who the characters are at least. Maya the Bee was also a welcome purchase. It’s a platformer that was only a few dollars, so why not? Monster House (which I’ve written out as Ghost House at least three times so far) is touted as being a great little hidden gem of sorts for the Game Boy Advance. I’ve heard it mentioned by several people around the internet, and it was also dirt cheap. Tiny Toon Adventures: Montana’s Movie Madness was a sporadic buy for me. I just picked up Looney Tunes for Game Boy not long ago and I hope this one’ll be at least as good as that. And finally, Batman! I’ve been waiting for ages to find it and snagged a great deal on eBay. Batman is adorably small and this game is way less realistic than most of the other games for various consoles. It’s very charming!\n\nI dove in and finally got myself a copy of black box NES Golf. This seems like a pretty golf-centric post, but I swear I’m not a video golf convert yet… I’d rather stick to real life mini-putt, even though I’m bad at that as well! Also, Cocoron finally arrived in the mail! It’s a Mega Man-like game for Famicom that I’ve been wanting to buy for a long time. It has always been really expensive, but I scooped it up for a pretty decent price. I’m going to have to check into what the first few menus in the game mean, but apart from those, I don’t think there’s much that requires knowing English.\n\nSince I finally bought a new laptop through eBay recently, I had a little stash of eBay bucks hanging around to spend out. I was strong-armed into picking up not one but two fairly expensive NES games, Kick Master and Gargoyle’s Quest II. These were games I never dreamed of owning because of their price point, but when they came practically free to me, it was a really nice feeling. Now I just have to buy more laptops so I can get more free games I guess.\n\nOne more NES game here is Slalom, complete with the Ned Flanders “nothing at all” butt you get to stare at all the way through this game. Its majesty is not even remotely captured in the label art here. I actually watched a video about some NES winter sports games from a great channel called NES Friend, and this person is also responsible for making me aware of Kickle Cubicle which I also bought recently. Slalom was definitely the best looking game of the bunch from that video. Its condition is a bit rough with a really stuck-on-there sticker and writing in permanent marker on the front and back, but the label is very nice overall.\n\nI’m also finally the proud owner of Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams for the Wii U. I had an Amazon order ready to go but needed to buy something more to get an add-on item, and this was the winner! I’ve been wanting this game for a long time after hearing The Deviot talk all about it pretty endlessly over the past few years… it’s about time! He did some wonderful streams of the game, so if you’re not following him on Twitch, you can do that here.\n\nLast but not least, I picked up a Street Fighter II manual for the PC version. I had no idea this game existed on PC, but the manual was among a bunch of books at the thrift store and was priced at fifty cents. Unfortunately they put the sticker right on the cover art and part of Blanka’s arm got torn away when I was trying to remove it, but the book is still in pretty great shape overall. I’m glad I found it! I haven’t found much locally in a long time so it was mildly thrilling.\n\nI’m really glad with how the Master System collection has been progressing, and I’m also quite happy with how I’ve been able to round out some more NES stuff too. Hopefully I’ll be able to start getting a list together for the spring swap meets. They’re already right around the corner! I’m shocked at how fast time is flying, but in the meantime, stay warm out there.\n\nThanks very much for reading!\n\n-GG\n\nSomehow, 2019 has come and gone in a flash. It’s astonishing to me that across these 365 days, I’ve managed to make my way through almost double the number of games I did last year, coming out to 46 games in total, with one filthy cheater win via password manipulation. As I mentioned last year, the gaming hobby has shifted a lot more toward playing through games I’ve found rather than acquiring new ones, but that’s not to say I haven’t been picking up new games every chance I get!\n\nSince I’ve had you all caught up on what’s made its way onto the shelves in 2019, I wanted to take a little time to talk about what I played, some brief thoughts each game, and a link or two to things I’ve been doing in other parts of the internet to assemble a lovely summary of a wonderful year in gaming.\n\nSuikoden (PS1)\n\nI started the year on the second half of Suikoden 1, a turn-based RPG that I felt was mediocre at best by the time I got to the end of it. I didn’t fall in love with this game even a little, and despite it starting out strong, my expectations were far beyond where this particular game ended up meeting me. I finished the game slightly outside of what would be considered 100%, and I can’t see myself revisiting it any time soon. It was a slow start to the year.\n\nKing’s Quest V (NES)\n\nPlaying through this again was probably one of my fondest gaming memories from 2019. The NES version of King’s Quest V is a game I purchased used when I was a kid but hadn’t had a chance to revisit it in any form since that time in my life. Like many games on this list, I streamed this and was thrilled to be able to share this experience with so many other people who were only familiar with more modern portrayals of this adventure. I loved it so much in fact that I played through it a second time to prepare a let’s play for YouTube.\n\nToki (NES)\n\nThis game was a one-night wonder on stream, and I do recall having a fun time playing it. It took a lot of getting used to with its stiff controls, and I’m still surprised I ended up finishing it given how tough some of the boss fights were. I can’t remember much, so I’d call it far from memorable.\n\nPopful Mail (Sega CD)\n\nThis was hands down one of the most expensive games I’ve purchased while collecting games, and I was thrilled to be able to play the real deal on original hardware. It compared so much to things like Faxanadu, Ys III: Wanderers from Ys and other sidescrolling adventure games that it felt natural to fall in love with it despite its staggering difficulty at times. If you ever have a chance to play this game, please do!\n\nLittle Nemo Dream Master (NES)\n\nThis was another one of my fondest memories from this past year in gaming. I have an amazing friend who adores this game that kept gently prodding me to try it out for myself, and after much convincing I finally dove in. Believe it or not, this is the one game I actually rage quit in the past, and unsurprisingly, it was that train level that did it to me. I let that game sit on the shelf for almost an entire decade before trying it again this year. With patience of steel as my armour, over two separate sittings, I was finally triumphant and made it through to the end.\n\nPsychic World (Sega Master System)\n\nPsychic World is probably one of my favourite Master System games and one I came upon totally by chance while looking into new games for the system a few years ago. It’s a really interesting action platformer that was a PAL exclusive for the SMS, but also came out in other iterations on the Game Gear and the MSX. If you have a Master System hanging around, I can’t recommend this game enough as a quick, action-packed game!\n\nThe Legend of Zelda (NES) – Second Quest\n\nMan oh man. If you know much at all about me, you know that I love some Zelda 1 like it’s nobody’s business. Although I never finished this game without the Game Genie until I was in my late 20s, the second quest was something that always eluded my interest because I had such a hard time with the first. Finishing this relatively blind on stream was one of my proudest accomplishments this year. I made my own video on the experience embedded below, but I was also invited to co-write and co-present two videos comparing and contrasting the first and second quests (Part 1 and Part 2) with Nefarious Wes. It was a very fun project to work on and I was honoured to be a part of it.\n\nAdventure Island IV\n\nAs a long-time lover of the Adventure Island series (except that first one… it can go back to hell from whence it came), finding out about a longer-winded action adventure game starring my favourite Higgins was music to my ears. I loved every moment of this experience and was grateful to be able to play a translated copy of the game on real hardware since it was originally a Japan-only Famicom release. I’d recommend this game to anyone for a fun thinkfest.\n\nIronsword: Wizards & Warriors II\n\nNow full disclosure, I only finished this game by blatantly cheating. After a certain point in the adventure, you’re no longer able to continue. I lost all my lives and should’ve properly game over’d, but I’m counting it here because with a bit of password manipulation to give me extra lives, I was able to eventually reach an ending screen. I’ll take it! The music alone in this game makes it worthwhile to finish.\n\nAladdin (SNES)\n\nI never grew up with an SNES, and until very recently I was not even aware that the SNES version was even different from the Sega Genesis game. It diverges in so many key ways like not having weapon to attack with and relying a lot more heavily on platforming skills that it’s truly a unique experience. Even though I found it really tough to get through at certain points, especially in the end game, I did manage to make it. It was another single night win for me!\n\nAladdin (Sega Genesis)\n\nNow THIS version of Aladdin is one I grew up with. I never owned it as a kid but we did rent it a lot, and I don’t ever remember being able to beat it until last year. It was nice to finally cross this one off the list of games I’ve always wanted finally finish.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. (NES) – Hammer Code (XYAGEP)\n\nThis was a feat of strength and skill that I never, ever want to have to go through again myself. There’s a Game Genie code that gives all enemies hammers to throw, and not just the regular hammer brothers hammers. It’s the ridiculous King Koopa hammer spew, and they also shoot straight up. This was a nightmare to complete, and along with the infinite lives code (SXIOPO) I’m still the only person out there that has managed to make it through the entire game. Here’s a short clip of me making it to the end after about 4.5 hours of trying, with most of that being 8-4.\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/446797735\n\nThe Magical Quest Starring Mickey Mouse (SNES)\n\nThis game was one I picked up randomly at a swap because the price was right, and in general, I’ve enjoyed Disney games from the 8- and 16-bit generations. This game felt very difficult in places, and I’m not sure what I could’ve done differently to make things easier on myself other than practice it more. There was one boss in particular in a wintry section of the game that made me want to scream, and that’s all I can remember about playing through this one. I must’ve repressed the rest of it.\n\nSecret of Mana (SNES)\n\nSecret of Mana was the game that really got me interested in ramping up my video game collecting, period. A friend had lent it to me but took it back before I had a chance to play it at all. Looking into purchasing a copy for myself opened up my world to so many other RPGs that I never even knew existed, especially on the SNES, and I’m still down that rabbit hole almost 5 years later with no signs of stopping. You can only imagine how great it was to finally cross this one off the list. It was definitely a good game, albeit a bit grindy when it came to levelling up magic skills, but I enjoyed it on the whole. It was one of those perfect games for streaming where I felt like I could still be productive in the game and keep up with a chat at the same time, but as usual, I got lost a lot. The soundtrack was definitely a highlight for me.\n\nCastlevania II: Simon’s Quest (NES)\n\nFinally! This entire series was one I’ve been wanting to get into forever, but after getting destroyed by the first NES Castlevania game back in October of 2018 I had been fearful to try out the second in the series. I’m so, so thankful I did, and despite all the hubbub about a “bad translation”, I was able to finish Simon’s Quest with barely any help in one marathon 8 hour sitting! The music, the action and the game as a whole was so Faxanadu-like that it was impossible for me not to love this one too. If you haven’t played it, please do yourself a favour and play it! It is very underrated!\n\nKatamari Damacy (PS2)\n\nI have so much praise for this game. I went through some pretty stressful times at work in 2019, and the few weeks where I had this game to look forward to coming home to on Monday nights were like oases in the scorching desert of despair at the time. The amazing soundtrack is probably the thing I took away most from this experience, but there’s also something about the game’s simple premise that had me playing and replaying levels to not only improve my performance, but to hear the hilarious screams of the people in the midst of the destruction I was causing. It was so relaxing to terrorize everyone and destroy the world in the happiest way possible. I can’t wait to play the other games in the series.\n\nStreets of Rage (Sega Genesis)\n\nThis was a co-op effort for my boyfriend and I. We played on easy mode and just barely squeaked by to beat this game together for the first time. I’m not usually good at brawlers and this playthrough was no different. He definitely carried me through!\n\nWorld of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse (Sega Genesis)\n\nYet another game from my childhood that I have very fond memories of! I never owned this game until I was an adult but used to rent it a lot, and I was able to finish this on stream one night for some people who wanted to see it played through. I really enjoy the Donald Duck path!\n\nGolvellius: Valley of Doom (Sega Master System)\n\nExploring Master System RPGs has become a bit of a pastime, if you hadn’t noticed. Golvellius: Valley of Doom was something that really piqued my interest since I always heard it referred to as a Zelda-like. That phrasing has lost a lot of meaning for me because everyone’s always calling every top-down perspective game where someone swings a sword a Zelda-like… this game just doesn’t quite fit that bill. It’s a wonderful game with a great soundtrack, good puzzles, and an interesting mashup of genres that includes some vertical- and side-scrolling sections. I’ll be curious to get into the other versions on the MSX, or its spiritual successor, Super Cooks!\n\nGhouls ‘n Ghosts (Sega Master System)\n\nDid I mention I finally made it into the club for people who can beat a GnG game? I honestly feel like this game is a cheater’s paradise into that club since this game peels away a lot of the white-knuckle difficulty of others in the series. With permanent upgrades to armour and weapons and magic that’s independent of which armour is equipped, it’s a great way for casual gamers to actually enjoy this series without ending up bald after the fact.\n\nVice: Project Doom (NES)\n\nBeating this game was a hard-fought victory. It was another one-night completion for me, but the lead up to the end of the game was a real slog. The final boss encounter is probably one of the most difficult ones I’ve had this year, but the rest of the game’s interesting and challenging level design wiped all that frustration away.\n\nAsterix (Sega Master System)\n\nI’ve been familiar with the Asterix comics for as long as I can remember since I’ve lived in Canada all my life, and this game was one of the most pleasant discoveries I’ve had while getting into the PAL library of Master System games. It’s a platformer that allows you to switch between two different characters, Asterix and Obelix, and every level is completely different depending on which of the characters you choose to play with. It has a ton of replay value and although it fell a little flat at the end, I’m looking forward to playing it again sometime. I’ve also recently purchased the other two Asterix games on the system and am excited to try those out as well.\n\nSuper Adventure Island (SNES)\n\nI was really excited for Super Adventure Island when I first heard about it a long while ago, and I was familiar with the game’s amazing soundtrack long before I ever played it. The game itself is a little bit mediocre and really, really difficult toward the end, so until this past year I had never been able to finish it. It was so nice to finally send that final boss to the depths after so many missed attempts in the past. Woohoo!\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap (Game Boy Advance)\n\nI had really high hopes for this game. It’s Zelda, so what could possibly go wrong? It was decent overall, but the whole kinstone fusion thing being required for key items and plot progression really, really turned me off. There was far too much of a focus on that and I found it really detracted from the main game objectives a little too often. It also left me in the dark a lot about where to go next. I’d say this is definitely at the bottom of my list of Zelda games in terms of preference, unfortunately.\n\nDonkey Kong Country (SNES)\n\nThis was the first time I’d really sat down to play this, and it was a tremendous struggle to say the least. The redeeming quality that made playing this game worthwhile was the very excited chat full of people who love this series and this particular game, and that sweet final boss fight music. DKC was so tough, and if you’re wondering, yes: I fell for the fake ending and had to do it over again.\n\nShadowrun (SNES)\n\nThis game was AWESOME! I bought this one on a whim at the request of a friend to play on stream, and am I ever glad I did! This game fused sci-fi, fantasy, cyberpunk and so many genre types that it’s hands down one of the most unique gaming experiences I’ve ever had. There are a lot of thoughts rolling around in my brain on this game and I have a review video planned, so hopefully I’ll be able to get it down on paper one of these days. It comes highly recommended if you haven’t played it yourself!\n\nGreat Greed (Game Boy)\n\nThis is a game that’s been on my mind on and off since I finished it a few months ago. It’s a turn-based RPG that is both fast-paced and hilarious that set the bar very high for the games that will come after it. The music in this game is beautifully composed for the most part, and I loved how sporadic the story felt at times. It was definitely one of the more interesting games I’ve played this past year and again, something that comes highly recommended if you’re into oldschool RPGs.\n\nKid Icarus (NES)\n\nKid Icarus is one of those games that I only understood as a vertical platformer and nothing more because for the longest time, I couldn’t get out of the first few levels. This game felt like a terrible grind when I picked it up this year again, but after some diligence and with the encouragement of many people hanging out with me while that death counter climbed higher and higher, I found a few upgrades and the game got a LOT more manageable. It’s truly an experience that gets easier as you go, and I tell ya, busting into that second loop never felt so good. Those eggplant wizards are the devil though. Probably the worst enemy ever in the entire history of time, no question. Getting turned into a defenseless vegetable never felt more offensive than it did here.\n\nBionic Commando (NES)\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever felt more embarrassed streaming a game than I did playing through Bionic Commando. You know how usually when you play a game for a while that you get better at it in a timely fashion? That didn’t happen here. It was at least an hour of blunder after blunder before something finally clicked, and it was another marathon night of gaming that brought me to the end of this one. Regardless of the struggle, finishing this is easily one of my proudest gaming experiences of 2019.\n\nSuper Metroid (SNES)\n\nAh yes, Super Metroid. It’s a game beloved by so many, and now by me as well. I do have to say that it was a lengthy run playing through without a guide and with a request for no spoilers, but finding a way forward or brute-forcing my way into areas I wasn’t supposed to be yet made for an interesting experience that I’ve rarely had with games outside of this franchise. I only just played the first Metroid game last year for the first time and this was my second game in the series, and Super Metroid more or less fixed many of the issues I had with the first game.\n\nBreath of Fire (SNES)\n\nThis was only one of a few turn-based RPGs I had the pleasure of playing through this year, and it fell awfully flat for me. It did a lot of things right as a back-to-basics game, and I usually love these. Unfortunately, the translation here was a big letdown and really held me back from loving the game since I couldn’t really keep track of the story and got lost a lot. I was kindly asked to share my thoughts on Breath of Fire on the Mage Cast (Episode #37). That conversation can be found here:\n\nhttps://thewellredmage.com/2019/12/06/breath-of-fire-podcast/https://thewellredmage.com/2019/12/06/breath-of-fire-podcast/\n\nCastlevania III: Dracula’s Curse (NES)\n\nAfter having some luck with Simon’s Quest, I gave Castlevania III a go. It is by far the hardest game I finished in 2019 along with the Hammer Mario challenge, and it took a lot of patience and practice along with a little luck to make it through. I’m still surprised I made it… I took Sypha along for the ride and will never forget the horrible, horrible sounds of that final level’s music. As a dear friend of mine once said, that song sounds like a straw being pulled in and out of a fast food cup lid. You’re welcome.\n\nCastlevania (NES)\n\nThis game haunted me for just over an entire year before I was finally able to put it away for good. I had gotten stalled at the reaper in October of 2018 with no hopes of making it through, but after beating Castlevania III earlier in the evening, this one came together quite well. That final fight against Dracula was a real nail-biter over the long while it took me to obliterate him, but finishing two Castlevania games in one night is something I won’t soon forget.\n\nLord of the Sword (Sega Master System)\n\nAh yes. This is a game I put off playing for ages because I thought it was going to be horrendous. Horrendous is a very strong descriptor and while I wouldn’t have called it an overwhelmingly positive experience, it was certainly far from the worst game I’ve ever played. It was a lesson in patience which I seem to have in droves, and it’s still shocking to me that I got to the end of this one. You have 10 continues/lives, you have to finish the whole adventure from start to finish, and not one bit of it is easy. It’s definitely one of the more challenging things I’ve accomplished this year.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 (Sega Genesis)\n\nComing back to old favourites was a theme to round out the end of the year. I’ll never get tired of crashing back down to earth after setting Dr. Robotnik ablaze.\n\nRiver City Ransom (NES)\n\nI was so pleasantly surprised by River City Ransom! Having some stream help to figure out what to eat in the shops to level specific stats was just what I needed to make this playthrough enjoyable, and I’m now excited to try other games like River City Girls, or other Kunio Kun series games. I don’t know why it took me so long to get around to this one. I’d highly recommend it if you haven’t played it yet!\n\nDanan the Jungle Fighter (Sega Master System)\n\nAt a first glance, I thought I had found a brand new action adventure RPG for the system, but it turned out that that Danan the Jungle Fighter was more a mix of an arcade-style sidescrolling platformer with a few RPG elements sprinkled in. And it was the lightest possible sprinkling! This game is fairly short, but like Lord of the Sword, it also required finishing it all in one sitting. It’s moderately pricey and a PAL-region exclusive, and for what you get out of it, I wouldn’t recommend paying the going rate. If you can get it for a deal, absolutely. It’s a fun albeit small adventure.\n\nRambo (NES)\n\nRambo had just come in the mail the day I played it at someone’s request, and over two sessions I managed to make it through this strange, strange adventure. The translation in this game was probably my favourite part, but having not seen the Rambo movies before playing this also brought me into it without any expectations of what a Rambo game should be. The main theme is so quest-y and awesome too… contrary to popular opinion, I loved it.\n\nBubsy: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind (Sega Genesis)\n\nBeating Bubsy 1 for Sega Genesis felt like a true occasion for celebration. I’ve had this game since childhood and used to play it alllll the time but never made it even remotely close to the end. Playing it occasionally as an adult over the past few years saw me make it a bit further each time, and a few weeks ago I finally vowed to push through to the end no matter how many times we had to put in a password. And I did it! I had an amazing stream talking about one of my favourite games (yes, you read that right), laughing at Bubsy’s horrible rollercoaster face, and finally closing that chapter of my gaming life. What a rush!\n\nEGG: Elemental Gimmick Gear (Sega Dreamcast)\n\nEGG queued up more negativity in me than I had hoped. It was an action RPG I sought out for a long while and found it locally not too long ago. My high hopes were dashed and this was probably one of my least favourite games I played through this year, with Suikoden and Breath of Fire being about even. It needed a little more refinement to make it a great game, but I wouldn’t even really call it very good. It was sub-standard at the core of what makes action RPGs what they are, and that’s why it all fell apart for me.\n\nBubble Bobble – Bad Ending (Sega Master System)\n\nDid you know that there was a Bubble Bobble game for the Master System? And that it has 200 levels instead of 100? Well, I’ll probably never see the other half of the game because I finished it with the bad ending. There were some conditions to be met to open up the 100 level home stretch and I missed them playing through blind! So much for that, but I was happy to seriously sit down with Bubble Bobble for the first time. It was enjoyable, and even after 100 levels I was not tired of that song!\n\nVirtual Boy Wario Land (Virtual Boy)\n\nAfter my boyfriend kindly modded our Virtual Boy for AV out, first on my list to play was VB Wario Land. I feel like this adventure was way harder than any Mario game I’ve ever played and I’m pretty sure I came away from it with the worst possible ending. Nonetheless, it was a shining moment for me to play and finish something on a system I never dreamed of owning until a few years ago.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. 3 All-Stars Version (SNES)\n\nSMB3 again, you say? Yes! Except for the very first time this year, I decided to play it on the SNES. I can’t say I liked that experience more than the NES version though… the backgrounds were too busy, and I sincerely missed my familiar NES sound effects. Soon I’ll have to torture myself with Super Mario Advance 4 to see what abominable voices they added to that game…\n\nYs IV: Mask of the Sun (Super Famicom)\n\nI made a triumphant return to the Ys series as well this year after finishing Ys III: Wanderers from Ys (SNES) last year and Ys: Vanished Omens (SMS) back sometime in 2017. I was able to apply a translation patch using the Super UFO 8, and thankfully the translation was exceptionally well done! It was by far the best experience I’ve had playing a patched game so far and I have lots of great things to say about it that will likely trickle out in a video review in the coming weeks.\n\nFaxanadu (NES)\n\nYou didn’t think I could let a year come and go without a return to the World Tree, did you? I just squeezed this playthrough in a few days ago and finished it in just under five hours. It’s always fantastic revisiting one of my very favourites.\n\nThe Lion King (Sega Genesis)\n\nAnd with one last hurrah, launching back to yet another old favourite closed out my year for gaming. I finished this one up on normal mode and saved the day yet again. What a hero I am!\n\nAs you might expect if you made it all the way to the bottom of this post, that’s it! I feel like I’ve expanded on my gaming hobby so much in the past year. Collecting is continuing to wind down and I’m finding myself enjoying games more and more through streaming and creating video reviews. In a million years, I would’ve never thought I’d be doing this kind of thing, yet here I am enjoying every moment.\n\nThank you to everyone who has stuck around through collecting, streaming and watching my content out there. It means the world to me to be able to share this hobby with you all, which was the true goal when I started up this blog almost 4 years ago now. I’m so grateful to have met so many wonderful people over the past few years. I’ve been lucky to become surrounded with a really solid group of gaming enthusiasts, and I appreciate you all so much! Thank you so much.\n\nI hope 2019 has been a wonderful year for you all. As always, I’m wishing you the best in your gaming endeavours and beyond for a fruitful year. Be safe out there!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n-GG\n\nOver the past few weeks, I’ve been very lucky in being able to find some wonderful games to add to my collection both locally and online. Some of these things I’ve been looking for over a long while, and others are things I took a chance on without knowing what to expect! Sometimes you just have to jump on a deal when it surfaces, and I was pleasantly surprised all around!\n\nFirst up is the Mega Man Anniversary Collection for Playstation 2. I do own the GameCube collection, but I heard that they did something weird to the controls. Maybe they switched the buttons around? I can’t quite recall now, but I was advised to pick up the PS2 version for a more approachable experience. As someone who has never beaten a single Mega Man game, I’m glad to finally have them all in one place since my physical collection is sparse. The disc isn’t in the greatest shape, but I’m sure it’ll spin up whenever I get around to testing it out. Also, the manual here is completely in French! Sometimes Canadian games came with two manuals for English and French readers, but here, the English one is missing altogether. My French is terrible at best, so hopefully I can figure things out and won’t need to rely on it too much!\n\nSticking with disc games for the moment, I found two for the Wii U, the first of which is Hyrule Warriors. I think I’m incredibly late to the party on this one and have no idea whether or not it has a story mode for single player, but I’ve never seen this game so cheap and couldn’t resist picking it up. The disc was in excellent shape overall, but the case itself had a bit of scuffing on the outer plastic and was also really dirty. I cleaned it up the best I could.\n\nThe second Wii U game is Pikmin 3! I have been looking for the third installment in this series for many months now, and I finally found it for a good price. It came with all the inserts as well as a now-defunct Club Nintendo code, and like the disc for Hyrule Warriors, this one was in virtually perfect condition. I still have yet to play any of the Pikmin games, but from what I’ve seen, they look fun and relaxing. I’m hoping for a Katamari Damacy-like experience when I finally sit down with it.\n\nI was also really lucky to find two Game Boy games. The first I bought online, and it’s Dinosaur’us for the Game Boy Color. This was the turn-based RPG I would’ve never expected to exist in the slightest given how unconventional it is, and after I learned of its existence, I sought it out and finally have a copy of my own. I didn’t get too far into it, but at a first glance, it involves some sidescrolling platformer action with turn-based battles against enemy dinos. There’s a whole levelling system with skills involved, so it’s quite the endeavour. Space Invaders was also a great find. It’s one of a very small set of games that, when used with the Super Game Boy, gives you the option to play a separate, full game on the SNES. This one lets you play the arcade version of Space Invaders, which took me straight back to my days of playing the Commodore Vic 20. What a blast!\n\nAnother game that pleasantly surprised me was an SNES game called Speedy Gonzales: Los Gatos Bandidos. I took a chance on this one. Prior to buying, I’d never heard a peep about it, but it is actually really good. I played it for about 15 minutes to test it out, and everything feels really fluid and smooth, and the music is something else! I’m very surprised at how good the first few levels felt, so I can’t wait to play it for a longer time and see more of it. This is probably the worst game of the bunch aesthetically, with a worn label, especially at the top toward the end label portion. It definitely looks like it was loved.\n\nOn the opposite of the impressiveness spectrum is Disney’s The Little Mermaid: Magic in Two Kingdoms for the Game Boy Advance. Now, I might be jumping the gun a little on my feelings for this game, but I was not pleased trying it out for a few minutes. It feels like one of those hand-holders that tutorial-izes every moment, and all of the characters feel like they’re moving at a snail’s pace. I’m not sure if anyone has played the Sega Genesis Little Mermaid game, but the controls are reminiscent of those in my mind. Hopefully I’m wrong about the impending terribleness, but for a few dollars, I’m not complaining. The title screen music was really great at least!\n\nI recently managed to fight my way through Castlevania and Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse for the NES, and Castlevania has definitely been on my mind more often than not over the past few weeks. I already owned two other Castlevania games for the DS, but when I saw Order of Ecclesia, I had to jump on it. It was not cheap, but it definitely wasn’t the going rate on eBay at the moment either, and I’m happy to have finally completed the DS Castlevania trilogy. My better half has played a lot of this one and really enjoyed it, but he lost his copy a long while ago. It’s nice for him to have that back again. Other than a bit of brown gunk on the case, the rest of the contents were in great condition.\n\nI found quite a few games for the Sega Master system as well. I have a huge fire under my butt to keep seeking out games for this amazing little console, and I’ve chanced upon some really excellent deals over the past little while. For some reason, most of the games I’ve purchased haven’t come with their manuals… I wonder what happened to them all?\n\nThe first game I bought was Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi. The game came to me with a wavy case art sheet as if it had been wet at some point, but it’s not damaged in any other noticeable way. To be honest, I’m not really sure if this game is a good purchase for this particular console, but I’ve heard the Genesis version is pretty awesome and wanted to see what this port might be like in comparison. I recently found the Master System port of Ghouls ‘n Ghosts to be surprisingly well done and different from the many other iterations out there, so one can only hope that this Shinobi game will follow suit. Here’s a review I did of the GnG game:\n\nGetting back to Shadow Dancer though, there’s a longplay online that takes just over 10 minutes. Maybe very easy for a seasoned player but a welcome challenge for a newcomer? Only time will tell! I need more Master System in my life!\n\nNext up is Impossible Mission, a port of a game originally released on the Commodore 64, the Atari 7800, and a variety of other early computers. It’s not to be confused with Zillion, which I feel it strongly resembles. It seems like an interesting and unique action game from what I’ve seen available for the SMS, and it was extremely cheap. How could I say no to an adventure? It does look tough and also seems to require a great deal of mapping, things I don’t shy away from in the games I play.\n\nSigh. One of the games I was most excited to see posted lately was Fantastic Dizzy. This is a game made by Codemasters and was an unofficial release for the console, and it’s on the more uncommon side. I immediately pounced on this purchase not realizing that it doesn’t work at all on NTSC systems, and unfortunately I’m now stuck with a game I can’t play at the moment. I’m going to do a bit of research and see if I can get things working, specifically if there’s a model of the SMS in my region that that might be able to play it. Otherwise, I might be looking to import a new system in the near-ish future.\n\nAsterix and the Great Rescue is something I’ve been on the lookout for since I finished up the first Asterix game for the system a few months ago. Of those on the Master System, it’s quite a bit more expensive than the others. There’s also a third game in the series that I have yet to find, but this one I got for a screamin’ deal, about $20 under the regular going rate online. I really liked the first one I played, and this one looks to be in the same vein in terms of gameplay and graphics. Now to find the last one to round out the trilogy! Of all the games I ordered, this one was by far in the best shape of the bunch. Everything looked nice and crispy!\n\nLast but not least, I found a copy of Ninja Gaiden! This game has been evading me for a very long time and is again one of the more uncommon games for the console from the PAL region. It usually averages around $110, and I was able to buy it for about half price shipped! This game is an exclusive on the Master System, and despite not having played very much of this series, I’ve been wanting to give this one a go. It’s always nice when the price is right. Woohoo!\n\nI have some other things on their way to me in the mail, but I thought this might be a good place to break up some of the recent purchases. Hopefully there will be new games just around the corner.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n-GG"
