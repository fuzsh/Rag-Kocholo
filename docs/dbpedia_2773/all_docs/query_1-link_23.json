        "text": "Hey all, so at the risk of getting ahead of myself, I’ve found most of the games I was originally hoping to get when I set out to make my RP4 arcade/console emulator (4gb RAM, since that may be relevant later)… knock wood. Now I decided to check out some of the games/consoles I’m not as familiar with, including the Sega CD, Turbografx-CD, and eventually Playstation 1 and 2 (although PS may be another post for another time in the Help section, ‘cuz I gotta figure out how well those games run on my 4gb system…).\n\nAnyway the reason I group all those consoles together is cuz these CD games/ROMs take up a lot more room than most console/arcade games! (As anyone who’s ripped a CD has likely noticed). When the Castlevania: Symphony Of The Night PS1 ROM I downloaded took up nearly 600mb on my Micro-SD, I knew I’d probably have to be a bit more selective (if only to save bandwidth).\n\nThat said, I’ve made a list below of some of the TG-CD and Sega-CD games that have either caught my eye, or that I’ve seen on “best of” lists for that console. I decided not to include games that had arcade or better equivalents (since I feel that arcade version of, say, Final Final is still going to be better than the Sega-CD adaptation, and why I assume Road Rash CD is going to be better than the Genesis version…).\n\nFor any of you familiar w/ these systems— and these games specifically— which do you recommend, that you consider “must-haves”? (for a fan of basically anything but sports games). Are there any of these you still go back and play? Are there any that you felt were disappointing?\n\nAgain, each one of these I get is potentially one less PS1 or PS2 game I can fit (until I get another MicroSD card, that is). Thanks!! And sorry for the long post. :/\n\nTURBOGRAFX-CD/PC ENGINE SUPER CD-ROM GAMES:\n\n• Bomberman: Panic Bomber\n\n• Castlevania: Rondo of Blood (fan of the series)\n\n• Dungeon Explorer 2\n\n• Gate of Thunder\n\n• Gradius II (unreleased, enjoyed Life Force etc)\n\n• Jim Power in \"Mutant Planet\" (shooter)\n\n• Lords of Thunder (not sure if this one or the Sega CD version is better)\n\n• SimEarth\n\n• Snatcher (also not sure if this or the Sega CD version is better)\n\n• Valis II\n\n• Valis 3\n\n• Valis IV\n\n• Valis: The Fantasm Soldier\n\n• Wonder Boy 3: Monster Lair\n\n• Y's Book I and II\n\n(I left off Buster Bros., Double Dragon 2, Fighting Street aka Street Fighter, Golden Axe, Image Fight, Lemmings, Raiden, R-Type, SideArms, Street Fighter 2, Wonder Boy In Monster Land & Zero Wing, since I assume these home versions are all inferior to their arcade counterparts, but feel free to tell me if I'm wrong, since some adaptations-- like the arcade Bionic Commando vs. the NES version-- can be completely different)\n\nSEGA CD GAMES:\n\n• Advances Dungeons & Dragons: Eye of the Beholder\n\n• After Burner III\n\n• Android Assault: Revenge of Bari-Arm\n\n• Batman Returns\n\n• BC Racers\n\n• Bram Stokers Dracula\n\n• Chuck Rock 2: Son of Chuck\n\n• Dark Wizard\n\n• Double Switch (adventure)\n\n• Dune (1993, adventure)\n\n• Earthworm Jim Special Edition\n\n• Ecco the Dolphin\n\n• Ecco: The Tides of Time\n\n• Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side (fighting)\n\n• Flashback\n\n• Ground Zero Texas\n\n• Heart of the Alien\n\n• Jurassic Park\n\n• Keio Flying Squadron\n\n• Kids on Site\n\n• The Lawnmower Man\n\n• Lords of Thunder\n\n• Lunar: The Silver Star\n\n• Lunar 2: Eternal Blue\n\n• Masked Rider: Kamen Rider Zero\n\n• Misadventures of Flink\n\n• Night Trap\n\n• Panic!\n\n• Popful Mail\n\n• Prince Of Persia (including this because I assume it’d be more advanced that the SNES version)\n\n• Revenge of the Ninja (1993, action)\n\n• Rise of the Dragon (1993)\n\n• Road Avenger\n\n• Road Rash CD\n\n• Robo Aleste (1993)\n\n• Secret of Monkey Island\n\n• Sewer Shark (shooter)\n\n• Shining Force (RPG)\n\n• Silpheed (shooter)\n\n• Snatcher\n\n• Sol-Feace (Konami shooter)\n\n• Sonic CD (action)\n\n• Soul star (shooter)\n\n• Spiderman vs. the Kingpin\n\n• Star Wars: Rebel Assault (1994)\n\n• Terminator, The (fighting)\n\n• Vay\n\n• Wirehead (action)\n\nWolfchild (action)\n\n• Wonder Dog (action)\n\n(Left off Fatal Fury Special, Final Fight CD & Ninja Warriors because I figure the arcade versions will be better, and more importantly, take up less space than these home CD adaptations)\n\n@darksavior Appreciate the reply! (and especially for acknowledging some of the specific games listed, hopefully there are others here who can attest to some of these lesser-known ones). Will try to take this one point at a time.\n\nThe biggest what-if? solved is hearing that I might not be able to play PS2 games (which I probably should’ve already suspected; I remember someone saying that the Pi had difficulty even playing N64 games). I’d mainly been hoping to get Katamari Damancy working for the missus, but unless I buy an actual PS2, I suppose that may have to wait until the Pi5, Pi6, or whatever upgrades are capable of running it. :/\n\nSo yeah, knowing that, I can expect to have quite a bit more space for PS1, Turbo-CD, Sega-CD etc games (or any other good ones I may have missed; hell, I already have some 400+ arcade games, and it STILL feels like there are some overlooked ones I may have missed, heh).\n\nI actually DO have a 128gb MSD as well (I think I read somewhere that the 256gb and above versions could have issues, and I figure at that point, you’re probably better off just getting a 2nd MSD). Last I checked, I think I did have about 100gb of space left, but considering how large some of these CD rips are, AND considering how long those 2 lists above are (AND how many good PS1 games there are), I can see all of those games eating up the remaining space pretty quickly.\n\nSo I think it would be worthwhile to learn about compressing these CD games. I take it someone just finds, downloads, then uses an outside program to compress a working CD-ROM/7z archive?\n\nHaven’t really gotten around to checking out the Retropie forums on Reddit much yet, I did Google the following links; I am unfortunately a Mac guy so I know it’ll be a bit more of a challenge for me to find a CHD batch converter.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/RetroPie/comments/72kh6q/stepbystep_guide_how_to_convert_sega_cd_or_pc/\n\nhttps://misterfpga.org/viewtopic.php?t=1788\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/RetroPie/comments/gzirdu/converting_bincue_to_chd_for_mac/\n\nAs far as your other points:\n\nIf the only real difference w/ Final Fight CD is the audio, unless there’s some huge improvement over the arcade version, I may just skip it for the arcade version for the sake of saving MSD space.\n\nNever even played Lords Of Thunder, but I am a fan of shooters. Guess this is just a matter of personal preference/which the small ROM is.\n\nI forgot that the Turbo Snatcher was Japanese only, guess that resolves that (I’ve been having these same issue for some of the FDS games/having to find English patched versions).\n\nI actually wasn’t even aware that Road Avenger was an arcade translation, so normally that’d be my go-to. Anyway, I found this doc & thread about Daphne, is that similar to another experimental experimental package I’d have to install?? I’ll have to check back which exact version of Retropie I currently have, but there’s currently no Daphne folder in ROMS.\n\nhttps://retropie.org.uk/docs/Daphne/\n\nhttps://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/29450/daphne-bin-fails-to-build?_=1614402637119\n\nThat aside, I guess the bigger issue/question is how large both the Daphne software and arcade ROM are, if it’s less than the Sega-CD version (and again, never having played it, if it’s worth all the trouble; I may have to look for a Youtube walkthrough of it, if there is such a thing).\n\nAnd for those Working Design games— hadn’t even heard of the company, but by the sound of things, that’d include the Lunar games, Popful Mail, and Vay— but unless they’re REALLY good, I may skip ‘em… a couple of them look like RPGs, which I normally love (Zelda and FF4 being 2 all-time favorites), but considering that I’ve mainly been playing quicker shooter/platformer/fighting/puzzle-type games on the Pi so far, I’m not sure when/if I’m gonna get around to playing something more complex/time-consuming like an RPG. :/\n\nHey gents, appreciate all the replies, apologies for my delayed one, wanted to go over every thing one-by-one if you don’t mind…\n\n@Zering : yep, I have heard of others using an external drive— I’m guessing a SSD would be best— to connect a larger library of games to their Pi (especially for ones they’ve connected to arcade-style standup cabinets). I may look into that at some point. For the moment though, I’m hoping to keep this thing as portable as possible! ;)\n\nBut yeah, to all of you— @Darksavior & @barbudreadmon included— knowing that I can’t run PS2 games on ANY existing Pi does actually simplify things, since that’s that much space I’d need to potentially allocate for those games. So we may have to look into just getting an old PS2 at some point (or as you’ve suggested, figure out how to get those to run on a PC emulator).\n\nDarksavior, out of curiosity, how much smaller on average do those compressed CDROM games tend to be from the original rips? Like how small would a 600mb game be (thinking of this Castlevania rip as an example) after you’ve compressed it?? The Mac thing definitely does complicate matters, but hopefully I can figure out how to do so using command line."
