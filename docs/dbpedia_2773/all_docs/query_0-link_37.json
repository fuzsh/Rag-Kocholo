        "text": "Post by davidpacman on\n\nBeing someone who likes to get the most \"complete\" version of a game, it's become noteworthy to me to double check multi platform releases for exclusive content. It's a bit of a tiring process, since everything is multiplatform nowadays, so I tried to find a list of games that detail this, and came up shorthanded. So I thought, why not create a definitive list together with the HG101 community? I'll start off with everything off the top of my head, and update the list as I discover more information. Anybody that has suggestions can feel free to post, but I would like to set some guidelines:\n\n1) Let's focus on the initial releases. The list will become a bit confusing if we start including ports created later to other platforms. Shovel Knight would be an example of this, which received exclusive bosses on later releases.\n\n2) Timed exclusives are fine, and I'll note that on the list with an *.\n\nHere we go:\n\nAce Combat 7 (PS4, XBO) - VR mission exclusive to Playstation *timed\n\nAssassin's Creed III (PS3, X360) - The Benedict Arnold Missions are exclusive to Playstation *timed\n\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag (PS3, X360, WiiU) - exclusive DLC for Playstation *timed\n\nBatman: Arkham Asylum (PS3, X360) - Joker missions exclusive to Playstation\n\nBatman: Arkham City (PS3, X360) - Sinistro Corps DLC outfit exclusive to Playstation\n\nBatman: Arkham Origins (PC, PS3, X360, WiiU) - Nightfall DLC exclusive to Playstation, Wii U has no multiplayer\n\nBatman: Arkham Knight (PC, PS4, XBO) - Scarecrow DLC exclusive to Playstation\n\nControl (PC, PS4, XBO) - exclusive outfits, mission and mods on Playstation\n\nCyber Shadow (PC, PS4, PS5, XBO, Switch) - exclusive functionality through Shovel Knight amiibo on Switch\n\nEarthworm Jim (SNES, MD) - Intestinal Distress level exclusive to Mega Drive\n\nFight Night Round 2 (PS2, GC, Xbox) - Little Mac and Super Punch Out are exclusive to Gamecube\n\nGhostbusters: The Video Game (PC, PS3, X360) - PC has no online multiplayer\n\nGhostbusters: The Video Game (PS2, Wii) - offline mutiplayer exclusive to Wii\n\nMarvel vs Capcom Infinite (PC, PS4, XBO) - Major Carol Danvers costume exclusive to Playstation\n\nMarvel's Avengers (PC, PS4, XBO) - Spider-Man exclusive to Playstation\n\nMega Man X Command Mission (PS2, GC) - exclusive functionality through GBA Link Cable on Gamecube\n\nMortal Kombat (PS3, X360) - Kratos is exclusive to Playstation\n\nNBA Street V3 (PS2, GC, Xbox) - Mario, Luigi and Peach are exclusive to Gamecube\n\nRayman Legends (PC, PS3, X360, WiiU) - Mario and Luigi costumes exclusive to Wii U\n\nResident Evil 7 biohazard (PC, PS4, XBO) - VR mode exclusive to Playstation\n\nShaq-Fu (SNES, MD) - Mega Drive has five more characters than SNES\n\nSkylanders SuperChargers (PS3, PS4, X360, XBO, WiiU, Wii, 3DS) - Bowser and Donkey Kong are exclusive to Nintendo\n\nSonic & Sega All-Stars Racing (PC, PS3, X360, Wii, DS) - Banjo-Kazooie and Avatars are exclusive to Xbox, Mii's are exclusive to Wii\n\nSonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed (PS3, X360, Wii U) - Miis, minigames, and 5 player multiplayer are exclusive to Wii U, Avatars exclusive to Xbox\n\nSoul Calibur IV (PS3, X360) - Darth Vader is exclusive to PlayStation, Yoda is exclusive to Xbox *timed\n\nSpider-Man (PC, PS2, GC, Xbox) - exclusive missions involving Kraven the Hunter on Xbox\n\nStar Wars Battlefront (PC, PS4, XBO) - VR mission exclusive to Playstation\n\nStarlink: Battle for Atlas (PS4, XBO, Switch) - Starfox characters and scenarios exclusive to Switch\n\nStreet Fighter X Tekken (PS3, X360) - 5 characters are exclusive to Playstation\n\nSSX On Tour (PS2, GC, Xbox, PSP) - Mario, Luigi and Peach are exclusive to Gamecube\n\nTomb Raider: Underworld (PC, PS3, X360, Wii, DS) - Beneath the Ashes and Lara's Shadow DLC exclusive to Xbox\n\nWatch Dogs 2 (PS4, XBO) - All DLC is exclusive on Playstation *timed\n\nPost by Snake on\n\nMortal Kombat (SNES/Genesis/Mega Drive) - Blood in the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive version.\n\nCastlevania:Symphony of the Night/Akumajo Dracula X:Gekka no Yasokyoku (Playstation/Sega Saturn/PSP) - Sega Saturn version has two more map areas, with its own exclusive items, enemies, and BGM.
