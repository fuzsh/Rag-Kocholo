        "text": "Hello gentle readers, and welcome to the SwitchArcade Round-Up for March 24th, 2022. It’s Thursday again, and that means we have a whole bunch of new games to check out. Sure, we’re all waiting for Kirby tomorrow, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t some games to consider today. Shooters, platformers, puzzle games, adventure games, and more. We’ve got summaries of all of them, along with the lists of new and expiring sales. Let’s get going!\n\nNew Releases\n\nAndro Dunos 2 ($19.99)\n\nSwitchArcade Highlight!\n\nGosh, and I thought Metroid fans had a long wait for a sequel. The original Andro Dunos came out in 1992 for the NEOGEO from Visco Corporation. While it didn’t make a massive splash, the game certainly had its merits and as a result earned a cult following. I’m not sure if the original development team has any connection whatsoever with the indie developer handling this thirty-years-later follow-up, but after spending some time with it I can safely say that Andro Dunos fans won’t be displeased with this sequel. I’ll have a review soon.\n\nSuper Nanaru ($9.99)\n\nA baker girl named Nanaru goes on a mission to reclaim her bread from a devil that stole it. This is a platformer where the character automatically runs forward, turning around when she hits a wall. You just have to choose when to jump. We’ve seen this kind of thing before, especially on mobile. Honestly, this seems to have five-dollar Switch platformer energy which makes it a bit of hard sell at twice the price. I’m going to be doing a review of this one early next week where I’ll let you know how it shakes out.\n\nArcade Archives Empire City: 1931 ($7.99)\n\nHere’s a deep dig for the Arcade Archives this week. Seibu Kaihatsu is mostly known for the Raiden shoot-em-up series, but it did make a few other things here and there. Empire City: 1931 is one of those. It’s a gallery shooter with a stylish comic book look to it. The kind of thing you would think would be played with a gun controller, but is instead done with a cursor. For what it is, it’s fine. Hardly a must-have but certainly an unusual entry in Hamster’s run.\n\nValis: The Fantasm Soldier ($15.00)\n\nValis II ($15.00)\n\nValis III ($15.00)\n\nIf you weren’t into the Valis Fantasm Soldier Collection but had an interest in one or two of the titles, Edea has now made them available a la carte. Apart from being available separately, there’s no real difference in the play experience here. Each game features the same options and extras found in the collection. Personally, I’d go for the collection over buying any of them on their own at these prices. But you do you.\n\nSky Gamblers – Air Supremacy 2 ($29.99)\n\nAtypical Games has a follow-up to its wild aerial combat game, and it’s really going for it. There’s a fourteen-mission single player campaign to work through plus an online multiplayer mode with battles between teams up to seven players each. There are eighteen different aircraft to fly, and each of them has a few different load-out variants. There are seven different maps, a bunch of modes, and other goodies like customizable paint and badges. A bit of a stiff price but if you’ve had lots of fun with Atypical’s previous games, especially in multiplayer, you may well get your money’s worth here.\n\nHatsune Miku Jigsaw Puzzle ($14.00)\n\nYes, it’s another Hatsune Miku-themed puzzle game. Jigsaw puzzles this time. You get thirty-nine different pictures and the puzzles can be one of three sizes depending on how zesty a challenge you want. There are also some songs to play along to, as you would expect from a Hatsune Miku game. For whatever reason, there are no touch controls available. That makes this roughly the worst jigsaw puzzle of the seven hundred or so available on the eShop unless you really, really love Miku.\n\nNun Massacre ($5.99)\n\nHere’s another scary first-person horror game where weird monsters stalk you. This one has a PlayStation 1-style look to it, and that is pretty cool. Apparently there are multiple endings and some secrets to hunt around for. Not really my kind of thing but I know some of you eat these up, so pull out your fork and knife and get to it.\n\nAery – Calm Mind 2 ($9.99)\n\nOh, more Aery. I think we all know how these go by now. You’re a bird flying through some pretty environments, picking up doodads and following the story. No enemies, no danger, just some chill exploration. They wouldn’t make this many of them if people weren’t buying them, so I imagine many will be glad to see one more. I somehow doubt it will be the last.\n\nDarkness and Flame: The Dark Side ($6.99)\n\nAnother chapter in the Darkness and Flame series of hidden object adventures from Five-BN Studio. Alice finds herself on the Dark Side after a battle with the Dark Warrior, a place where normal people have not trodden for a very long time. Even worse, her flame power appears to be flickering out. She must find her companions and escape before all hope is lost. You know the routine: solve puzzles, play some minigames, talk to odd characters, and gawk at the pictures.\n\nWorld Soccer Kid ($2.99)\n\nHow many times can you bounce the ball on your head? That’s pretty much the game. There are a few modes of play here, including some local co-op modes. The sketchbook art style at least gives it some kind of flavor.\n\nMini Words Collection ($3.99)\n\nA collection of a few little word games. There are three in total, adding up to more than a thousand levels of brain-teasing fun. The Pathfinders has you looking for words on a board to match pictures without crossing paths, Polyglot gives you a little taste of other languages, and Mini Words has you unscrambling letters to make words. If you like word puzzles, this certainly offers some bang for your buck.\n\nDisco Cannon Airlines ($0.99)\n\nLaunch your disco guy into the sky using a cannon and try to hit as many things as you can to rack up a lot of points. Well, if you’re going to put out a game of dubious value, at least make it cheap and stupid. That’s my opinion, anyway.\n\nSales\n\n(North American eShop, US Prices)\n\nNot too much there yet today. If you like hidden object/escape room games, you could pick up the Panmorphia or Kosmonavtes games. The outbox is big, but mostly full of the usual suspects. Grab them now if you like, or wait a few weeks for them to be back on sale again. Check those lists anyway, naturally.\n\nSelect New Games on Sale\n\nUrban Flow ($1.99 from $14.99 until 3/30)\n\nRazerWire: Nanowars ($1.99 from $9.99 until 3/30)\n\nAngelo & Deemon: OHoaQ ($9.89 from $14.99 until 4/5)\n\nDimension Drive ($1.99 from $12.99 until 4/6)\n\nRainswept ($1.99 from $9.99 until 4/6)\n\nLuckslinger ($3.49 from $9.99 until 4/6)\n\nCastle of Pixel Skulls ($1.99 from $4.99 until 4/6)\n\nInferno 2 ($1.99 from $4.99 until 4/6)\n\nBack to Bed ($1.99 from $4.99 until 4/6)\n\nLost Wing ($1.99 from $7.99 until 4/6)\n\nBatu Ta Batu ($1.99 from $4.99 until 4/6)\n\nLumini ($1.99 from $9.99 until 4/6)\n\nThe Bug Butcher ($1.99 from $7.99 until 4/6)\n\nDraw a Stickman: Epic ($5.24 from $6.99 until 4/13)\n\nChess Royal ($1.99 from $2.99 until 4/13)\n\nDanger Mouse: Danger Games ($3.99 from $4.99 until 4/13)\n\nPanmorphia ($1.99 from $5.99 until 4/13)\n\nPanmorphia: Enchanted ($1.99 from $3.99 until 4/13)\n\nKosmonavtes: Escape Reality ($1.99 from $3.99 until 4/13)\n\nKosmonavtes: Academy Escape ($1.99 from $5.99 until 4/13)\n\nNecroWorm ($1.99 from $4.99 until 4/13)\n\nZombie Scrapper ($1.99 from $2.99 until 4/13)\n\nFilament ($5.94 from $16.99 until 4/13)\n\nAir Conflicts Secret Wars ($3.99 from $19.99 until 4/13)\n\nBFF or Die ($2.99 from $7.99 until 4/13)\n\nSales Ending Tomorrow, Friday, March 25th\n\nAkane ($1.99 from $4.99 until 3/25)\n\nAkuto: Showdown ($1.99 from $7.99 until 3/25)\n\nArcade Fuzz ($1.99 from $3.99 until 3/25)\n\nArcane Arts Academy ($1.99 from $7.99 until 3/25)\n\nASMR Journey Jigsaw Puzzle ($1.99 from $3.99 until 3/25)\n\nBadland: GotY Edition ($1.99 from $5.99 until 3/25)\n\nBarricadeZ Revisited ($9.74 from $14.99 until 3/25)\n\nBIT.TRIP Series, Assorted ($1.99 from $4.99 until 3/25)\n\nBlazing Beaks ($1.99 from $14.99 until 3/25)\n\nChess Knights Shinobi ($1.99 from $3.99 until 3/25)\n\nCity Bus Driving Simulator ($5.59 from $13.99 until 3/25)\n\nClouds & Sheep 2 ($1.99 from $9.99 until 3/25)\n\nCoffee Crisis ($1.99 from $9.99 until 3/25)\n\nDaylife in Japan Jigsaw Puzzle ($1.99 from $3.99 until 3/25)\n\nDex ($1.99 from $19.99 until 3/25)\n\nDoor Kickers ($1.99 from $11.99 until 3/25)\n\nDracula Frames ($1.99 from $3.99 until 3/25)\n\nDrizzlepath: Deja Vu ($4.89 from $6.99 until 3/25)\n\nDungeonTop ($1.99 from $13.99 until 3/25)\n\nDynamite Fishing ($1.99 from $9.99 until 3/25)\n\nEpistory Typing Chronicles ($1.99 from $14.99 until 3/25)\n\nEyes: The Horror Game ($1.99 from $2.49 until 3/25)\n\nGet-A-Grip Chip ($7.99 from $9.99 until 3/25)\n\nGnomes Garden 3 ($2.49 from $4.99 until 3/25)\n\nGood Night, Knight ($1.99 from $11.99 until 3/25)\n\nGravity Rider Zero ($1.99 from $6.99 until 3/25)\n\nHentai vs Evil ($6.99 from $9.99 until 3/25)\n\nHoratio Goes Snowboarding ($4.89 from $6.99 until 3/25)\n\nHyper Parasite ($1.99 from $17.99 until 3/25)\n\nKoloro ($1.99 from $9.99 until 3/25)\n\nLyrica ($15.99 from $19.99 until 3/25)\n\nMana Spark Complete ($1.99 from $11.99 until 3/25)\n\nMilli & Greg ($1.99 from $3.99 until 3/25)\n\nMini Trains ($1.99 from $5.99 until 3/25)\n\nMissing Features: 2D ($1.99 from $3.99 until 3/25)\n\nMoero Crystal H ($23.99 from $39.99 until 3/25)\n\nMonkey Wall ($3.99 from $4.99 until 3/25)\n\nMotoGP 18 ($2.99 from $19.99 until 3/25)\n\nMXGP3 Official Motocross ($1.99 from $19.99 until 3/25)\n\nNot Not A Brain Buster ($1.99 from $2.49 until 3/25)\n\nOm Nom: Run ($1.99 from $4.99 until 3/25)\n\nOne Strike ($1.99 from $4.99 until 3/25)\n\nOne Strike: Complete ($1.99 from $5.99 until 3/25)\n\nPlanet Quiz: Learn & Discover ($1.99 from $11.99 until 3/25)\n\nPocket Golf Mini Hole in One ($1.99 from $2.99 until 3/25)\n\nPretty Girls Mahjong Solitaire ($4.19 from $5.99 until 3/25)\n\nPuzzle Car ($1.99 from $3.99 until 3/25)\n\nPuzzletronics ($1.99 from $3.99 until 3/25)\n\nRace Track Driver ($5.99 from $11.99 until 3/25)\n\nReal Boxing 2 ($1.99 from $14.99 until 3/25)\n\nRed Ronin ($1.99 from $7.99 until 3/25)\n\nREKT Double Flip ($1.99 from $6.99 until 3/25)\n\nRun the Fan ($1.99 from $3.99 until 3/25)\n\nSavage Halloween ($1.99 from $4.99 until 3/25)\n\nShapeshooter ($1.99 from $3.99 until 3/25)\n\nSmashy Road: Wanted 2 ($1.99 from $7.99 until 3/25)\n\nSpace Elite Force ($1.99 from $2.99 until 3/25)\n\nSpace Pioneer ($1.99 from $9.99 until 3/25)\n\nSpitlings ($8.99 from $14.99 until 3/25)\n\nSpooky Chase ($1.99 from $4.99 until 3/25)\n\nSports Car Driver ($7.79 from $11.99 until 3/25)\n\nSteamroll: Rustless ($5.99 from $9.99 until 3/25)\n\nSuper Korotama ($2.99 from $4.99 until 3/25)\n\nSwarmriders ($1.99 from $3.99 until 3/25)\n\nTharsis ($1.99 from $11.99 until 3/25)\n\nThe Letter A Horror Visual Novel ($13.99 from $19.99 until 3/25)\n\nThe Savior’s Gang ($2.99 from $4.99 until 3/25)\n\nTiny Lands ($1.99 from $5.99 until 3/25)\n\nTools Up!
