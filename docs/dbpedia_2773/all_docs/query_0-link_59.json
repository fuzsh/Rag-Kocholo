        "text": "PRODUCT DESCRIPTION\n\nValis (Sega Genesis Games)\n\nThe universe represented in Valis is composed of three primary worlds: the Human World, The Dream World of Valia and the Dark World of King Rogles. Led by King Rogles and his five dark lords, the Dark World is threatening to pound all the other worlds into submission. Their first act of darkness was to steal the force of Yang from Queen Valia. Only Yuko Ahso, a girl with a heart perfectly balanced with Ying and Yang, can wield the sword of Valis and confront the enemy head on. You, constant gamer, must take on the roll of young Yuko and make the universe safe once again. To help you defeat the darkness, item boxes are scattered throughout the game. You can break these open to retrieve magic points, health points and extra lives. Japanimation-style storyboards play out the storyline between levels."
