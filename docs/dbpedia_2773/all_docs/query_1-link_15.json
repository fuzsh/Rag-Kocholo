        "text": "During the last bit of the Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase stream, Yakuza Kiwami was announced to be ported to the Nintendo Switch for the first time and will be available digitally on October 24th.\n\nNew players can experience the early adventures of Kazuma Kiryu as he emerges from prison 10 years later after taking a fall of a murder to yakuza clans on the brink of a war that hurtles him on an intense journey of love, humanity, and betrayal, fueled by his fists and unyielding resolve, set against a bustling red-light district in modern day Japan.\n\nThis is also a great way to promote the upcoming live action TV adaptation of the game coming to Amazon Prime Video on October 25th. Will you get the Nintendo Switch version of Yakuza Kiwami? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nRetro-Bit Gaming has been releasing high-quality, officially licensed SEGA controllers for years. From Genesis to Dreamcast, they’ve had a strong lineup. However, they haven’t unveiled a major product like this until now.\n\nIntroducing Retro-Bit Gaming’s high-quality SEGA Saturn fight stick. Inspired by the Japanese SEGA Saturn Virtua Stick, this sleek controller features a black finish instead of the traditional white. For more images, check out Sega Saturn, Shiro!’s tweet after the jump. It has also come to my attention that the fighting stick is non-working and more of a pitch by Retro-Bit to SEGA, as its not ‘officially licensed’, well yet. I mean, we need one of these babies!\n\nContinue Reading ➜\n\nLet’s face it, The SEGA CD is expensive and prone to failure. It does offer that incredible CD quality sound but sometimes you just want to play all your classic Sonic the Hedgehog games on the regular old SEGA Genesis / Mega Drive. Guess what? Soon you can.\n\nAs part of this year’s Sonic Hacking Contest MDTravis has submitted a sorta demake port by making the once SEGA CD exclusive run on vanilla SEGA Genesis hardware. Like many great fan projects, MDTravis had the help of:\n\nKatKuriN: Disassembly and support\n\nVladikcomper: DAC Driver and MegaPCM2 debugging\n\nSeekflash16: Genesis music arrangements\n\nCollisionChaos: Music research assistance\n\nMD Sonic The Hedgehog is slated to get a full release on September 28th, so if your mom hasn’t let you upgrade to a SEGA CD for the last 30+ years, soon you will be able to try Sonic CD!\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that this would be a port of Sonic CD V0.02 which means it will be a early prototype build being ported over to the SEGA Genesis/Mega Drive system.\n\n[via: Time Extension]\n\nDuring the Xbox @ Gamescom stream, there was a pre-recorded video from Studio Zero director Katsura Hashino who introduced viewers to the brand-new trailer for Metaphor: ReFantazio “Travel Beyond Fantasy”, which focuses on the journey for the Royal Tournament. The trailer revealed the Protagonist traveling far and wide, campaigning to win support from the people of the United Kingdom of Euchronia in the hopes of being elected as their new King and take the Throne.\n\nThe Xbox @ Gamescom livestream also included an informative interview with actors Stewart Clarke and Kristin Atherton who voice the English version of central characters Strohl and Hulkenberg. The two actors discussed their roles in the game, how they prepared for their performance and what it was like to immerse themselves in the magical, medieval world of Metaphor: ReFantazio. You can watch the VOD on the official Xbox YouTube channel here.\n\nMetaphor: ReFantazio will launch on Xbox Series X|S, Windows, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4 and Steam on October 11, 2024.\n\nYou may remember us reporting on Parking Garage Rally Circuit, an upcoming indie racing game coming soon to Steam, which is styled after a Sega Saturn game and could actually become a Saturn game if it gets enough sales on Steam. After that article, I have reached out to Tim of Walaber Entertainment, the studio developing Parking Garage Rally Circuit, for an interview with the man behind the game. He has kindly taken time out of his busy schedule to answer a few questions about the game for all our readers.\n\nJoin us after the break to hear about Tim’s history with Sega Saturn, his inspirations for Parking Garage Rally Circuit, and a bit more of what we can expect to see in this game when it launches on Steam sometime this year.\n\nContinue Reading ➜\n\nAt gamescom’s Opening Night Live 2024, ATLUS announced unexpected news we never seen coming that a special challenge battle will be added to Persona 3 Reload on September 10, 2024 as part of Episode Aigis -The Answer-, the final content release for the Persona 3 Reload: Expansion Pass.\n\nWholly unique to Persona 3 Reload’s Episode Aigis, the encounter with the masked boy presents a hardcore challenge for players via a secret boss fight, replete with striking themes from Persona 5 Royal.\n\nThe confrontation is one part of the larger Episode Aigis -The Answer- content expansion, a major post-ending DLC that further develops the story of Persona 3 Reload and serves as a story epilogue.\n\nThe Persona 3 Reload: Expansion Pass includes Episode Aigis -The Answer-, the Velvet Costume & BGM Set, and the Persona 5 Royal EX & Persona 4 Golden EX BGM Sets.

This news was shared yesterday on Twitter by Lost Judgement director Yutaka Ito and is also being shown on the CEDEC website’s top awards list. Yutaka Ito’s tweet was also transcribed by known Twitter translator Gosokyuu.\n\nHere’s what the CEDEC had to say about this honor on their website, translated to English:\n\nThe committee commended the expertise and uniqueness of the efforts to reproduce games for dedicated arcade hardware at the dawn of 3DCG games, as well as the fact that through the commercialization of these games, past arcade games that were often buried in the past were brought to the attention of today’s players.\n\nIto also had more to say about what went into the development of the emulation for these games and the difficulties of it on Twitter. You can read more about that past the break.\n\nContinue Reading ➜\n\nJust in time for Gamescom, SEGA has released a brand new gameplay trailer for SONIC X SHADOW GENERATIONS showcasing Shadow new abilities called “Doom Powers” which allows him to traverse through iconic stages and challenging boss battles like never before!

The only PlayStation game Sega has ever developed “Mini-Moni. Shakatto Tambourine! da Pyon! (2002)” has just been fan translated, opening it up to an English speaking audience. Of course, this only goes for written text in the game, and not the lyrics to the songs within. The translation comes courtesy of the team of fan translators at Hilltop Works.\n\nThe game is very similar to Samba de Amigo and has tambourine motion-based controllers that you can play it with, which were originally packaged with copies of the game. The game can still be played with a regular DualShock controller, which you’re much more likely to own.\n\nFor a link to download the translation patch, as well as a brief background on the game, come on down past the break.\n\nContinue Reading ➜\n\nAs a surprising announcement from SEGA and Limited Run Games, Limited Run Games is opening global pre-orders TODAY for the way-past-cool SONIC X SHADOW GENERATIONS Collector’s Edition with pre-orders only remaining open until October 6, 2024!\n\nWhat makes this Collector’s Edition set so special is that a copy of SONIC X SHADOW GENERATIONS will be available for everyone who pre-order the physical editions on major platforms; however, it’s the jaw-dropping, exclusive Dreamcast-inspired Sonic and Shadow statue that makes it a must-have for fans of everyone’s favorite hedgehog!\n\nThe design team at Limited Run is throwing back to the Sonic Adventure days with a Collector’s Edition that includes an exclusive Dreamcast statue with Sonic and Shadow, a commemorative Dreamcast jewel case, Chao mini figurines, an art book with the concept art of Shadow Generations, and more!\n\nHere’s what’s included in the Collector’s Edition:\n\nStandard Edition for PC OR Physical Day One Edition of SONIC X SHADOW GENERATIONS for Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X\n\nPhysical Day One Edition Only:\n\nSonic Adventure Skin\n\nGerald Robotnik’s Journal\n\nReversible Cover\n\nSonic & Shadow Dreamcast Statue\n\nSwitch or Blu-ray Steelbook\n\nDeluxe Art Book\n\nOriginal Soundtrack CD\n\nChao Mini Figurines\n\nSonic, Shadow, and Classic Sonic Shoes Keychain\n\nCommemorative Dreamcast Jewel Case\n\nCollector’s Box\n\nIndividually Numbered Certificate of Authenticity\n\nThe SONIC X SHADOW GENERATIONS Collector’s Edition is set to retail for $249.99 USD and will arrive on doorsteps in 2025.\n\nGamescom is happening this week and ATLUS has recently announced the full English voice cast for Metaphor: ReFantazio, including the voice role for the Protagonist.

Derel Connolly, known for his work on the Jurassic World movies, has been assigned to write the script. David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, and Don Granger will produce the project for Skydance, while Toru Nakahara, who oversaw the adaptation of SEGA’s Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, will produce on behalf of SEGA. Rob Ree, credited with bringing Skydance and SEGA together on this project, will serve as executive producer. Aimee Rivera will oversee the project for Skydance.\n\nEternal Champions is a 2D fighting game developed for the Sega Genesis (known as the Mega Drive in the UK) by Sega Interactive in 1993. Created by Sega of America to capitalize on the massive success of Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat, the game’s plot centers around the Eternal Champion gathering key individuals from different time periods before their deaths. These individuals compete in a fighting tournament, with the victor gaining the chance to regain their life and alter their fate, while restoring balance to the universe. The losers, however, are doomed to die as history records.\n\nWith recent trademarks and announced SEGA live-action adaptations, SEGA seems to be making a strong push to revive awareness of its classic brands. What are your thoughts on a live-action adaptation of Eternal Champions? We will keep you updated with more news on this project as it develops!\n\nAnother Dreamcast classic returns online. F355 Challenge (2000), the Ferarri focused arcade racer by the great Yu Suzuki that is otherwise unrelated to OutRun, has it’s own website restored, re-enabling all the online features of the Dreamcast game. The website can be accessed straight from the game’s disc when running on a Dreamcast connected to the internet, as well as through a network-enabled Dreamcast emulator. This comes thanks to developer Flyinghead.\n\nF355 Challenge did not actually have an online multiplayer mode, however. Its online features were limited to allowing for the upload and download of time trial rankings and car ghost data, as well as an exclusive Ferrari movie that could be viewed on the website. DreamPi and Broadband adaptor users will be automatically directed to the site when trying to access it from within the game now.\n\nZoom in past the break for a bit more technical info to get you started.\n\nContinue Reading ➜\n\nOn this SEGA Talk we take a look at two Shenmue games you most likely never played: Shenmue Online and Shenmue City.
