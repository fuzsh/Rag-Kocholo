He was also able to trade Alexander Suzdalev, who was playing pro hockey in Sweden at the time of the deal.\n\nWhat he got in return were several younger players and draft picks, who Millar hopes will become the future of the team.\n\n“As a manager at this level, sometimes you have to understand you’re not good enough,” Millar said of last year’s mindset. “And you have to make the decisions around not being good enough and where do you want to go.\n\n“We want to continue to build our team. We want to continue to get young players into our lineup. We want to continue to make sure we have the right development model around our young players and all our players getting better.\n\n“Nobody here wants to just get by. Nobody wants to battle for the seventh or eighth playoff spot and just get in and lose in four or five games to a top team.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“We want to build it the right way. We want to be as competitive as we can and have that eye on, again, winning a championship.”\n\nHaving given head coach Brad Herauf and assistant coach Ken Schneider multiyear contract extensions, the Pats hired Smith, former head coach of the Spokane Chiefs, to serve as the club’s new associate head coach, replacing Evan McFeeters, who spent one year with the team as an assistant coach.\n\nMillar also announced the hiring of Derkatch — the Pats’ all-time points leader — as the team’s new assistant general manager.\n\nAll the moves are part of a long-term vision for Millar, who joined the Pats after a stint with Hockey Canada which followed a decade spent with the Moose Jaw Warriors.\n\nAnd while Regina won’t likely contend for a championship this season, the hope is that a few years down the road, they’ll be in the mix.\n\n“The first step is to get competitive again and then the next step is to become a contender,” said Millar. “You can’t do one without the other.\n\n“When I talk about being competitive, I talk about being a playoff team and growing from there.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“But we want to be a competitive team this year. We want to be a playoff team and that’s what we’re working towards.”\n\nWhile playoffs are still the goal for the 2024-25 WHL season, Millar will also be forced to make some tough decisions with some key assets on the team.\n\n“Every decision we make, every player we sign, every draft pick we trade or acquire, every player we trade or acquire, we map it our through a four- or five-year plan,” said Millar. “There’s certainly a balance in terms of being competitive and at the same time as I mentioned, having that eye on the future.\n\n“We’re going complement our group wisely (and) we’re going to complement our group reasonably. We’re going to have a vision and we’re going to have our eyes set on where we’re going to be two, three years down the road.”\n\nWith that vision — and a stable of hockey operations staff who believe the same — Millar will continue to put his stamp on the team this year in the hopes that one day that vision becomes a reality.\n\n“There’s only one goal by this group,” he said. “And that’s to win a WHL championship and a Memorial Cup.\n\n“And every decision we’ve made with this group and every decision we’re going to make moving forward is with that goal in mind.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\ntshire@postmedia.com\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nRegina Pats hire Dale Derkatch, Ryan Smith as hockey operations staff finalized\n\nRegina Pats' captain Tanner Howe drafted by Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nThe Regina Leader-Post has created an Afternoon Headlines newsletter that can be delivered daily to your inbox so you are up to date with the most vital news of the day.
