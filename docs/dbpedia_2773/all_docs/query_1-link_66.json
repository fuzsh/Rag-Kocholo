        "text": "Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) is the Mario maker's answer to PS Plus. Like that equivalent service from Sony, if you want to play multiplayer games online on your Switch you'll need to grab an NSO membership first. Switch Online launched back in 2018, and marks the first-time Nintendo has locked the ability to play multiplayer games online behind a paid service. To sweeten the deal, Nintendo has thrown in a wealth of additional perks like cloud saves, game trials, and exclusive money-saving offers.\n\nBut the jewel in the crown is the ever-growing library of retro games subscribers can access. When Switch Online debuted, a selection of games from Nintendo's first console were also available to play. After starting off with the NES - or Famicom as it's known in Japan - Nintendo has bit-by-bit been adding new games and systems to Switch Online, working through its home consoles and handhelds.\n\nWith Switch Online you can now play NES, SNES, and Game Boy games. If you fork out extra for the more premium Expansion Pack membership, you'll also get to play N64 and Game Boy Advance games, as well as Sega Mega Drive games. To help you sort through the service's impressive retro gaming library, we've rounded up every game available with Nintendo Switch Online. We've also got details on the additional DLCs thrown in with the Expansion Pack, which could entice you to opt for this pricier plan instead of the vanilla membership.\n\nEvery Nintendo Switch Online game\n\nAll Switch Online NES games\n\nAll Switch Online SNES games\n\nAll Switch Online Game Boy games\n\nAll Switch Online Game Boy Advance games\n\nAll Switch Online N64 games\n\nAll Switch Online Sega Mega Drive games\n\nAll Switch Online DLCs\n\nAll Switch Online SP games\n\nAll Switch Online 99 games\n\nAll Nintendo Switch Online NES games\n\nThe NES has the largest selection of retro games in the Switch Online library. There are over 70 games from the 8-bit era included with the base NSO membership, from classics like the original Super Mario Bros and the first Legend of Zelda, to lesser-known titles that previously were only released in Japan.\n\nYou can find the NES games available with Switch Online below:\n\nAdventures of Lolo\n\nBalloon Fight\n\nBaseball\n\nBlaster Master\n\nCity Connection\n\nClu Clu Land\n\nCobra Triangle\n\nCrystalis\n\nDaiva Story 6: Imperial of Nirsartia\n\nDevil World\n\nDig Dug Ⅱ\n\nDonkey Kong\n\nDonkey Kong 3\n\nDonkey Kong Jr.\n\nDonkey Kong Jr. Math\n\nDouble Dragon II: The Revenge\n\nDouble Dragon\n\nDowntown Nekketsu March Super-Awesome Field Day!\n\nDr. Mario\n\nEarthBound Beginnings\n\nEliminator Boat Duel\n\nExcitebike\n\nFire 'n Ice\n\nGhosts’n Goblins\n\nGolf\n\nGradius\n\nIce Climber\n\nIce Hockey\n\nJourney to Silius\n\nJoy Mech Fight\n\nKid Icarus\n\nKirby's Adventure\n\nKung-Fu Heroes\n\nMach Rider\n\nMappy-Land\n\nMario Bros.\n\nMetroid\n\nMighty Bomb Jack\n\nMystery Tower\n\nNES Open Tournament Golf\n\nNightshade\n\nNinja Gaiden\n\nNinja JaJaMaru-kun\n\nPinball\n\nPro Wrestling\n\nPunch-Out!!

Nintendo revealed GBA games were heading to NSO alongside the Game Boy announcement in the February 2023 Direct.

But that's what has happened, with Mega Drive games getting added to the NSO Expansion Pack at launch. Nintendo revealed games from the Mega Drive, or Genesis as it's known in the States, would be coming to Switch Online's more premium membership tier during the September 2021 Nintendo Direct.\n\nYou can find a list of all Mega Drive / Genesis games included with the Expansion Pack below:\n\nAlien Soldier\n\nAlien Storm\n\nAlisia Dragoon\n\nAltered Beast\n\nBeyond Oasis\n\nCastlevania: Bloodlines\n\nColumns\n\nComix Zone\n\nContra: Hard Corps\n\nCrusaders of Centy\n\nDr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine\n\nDynamite Headdy\n\nEarthworm Jim\n\nEcco the Dolphin\n\nFlicky\n\nGhouls 'n Ghosts\n\nGolden Axe\n\nGolden Axe II\n\nGunstar Heroes\n\nKid Chameleon\n\nLandstalker\n\nLight Crusader\n\nM.U.S.H.A.\n\nMega Man: The Wily Wars\n\nPhantasy Star IV\n\nPulseman\n\nRistar\n\nShining Force\n\nShining Force II\n\nShinobi III: Return of the Ninja Master\n\nSonic The Hedgehog 2\n\nSonic The Hedgehog Spinball\n\nSpace Harrier II\n\nStreet Fighter II: Champion Edition\n\nStreets of Rage 2\n\nStrider\n\nSuper Fantasy Zone\n\nSword of Vermilion\n\nTarget Earth\n\nThe Revenge of Shinobi\n\nThunder Force II\n\nToeJam & Earl\n\nVirtua Fighter 2\n\nZero Wing\n\nAll Nintendo Switch Online DLCs\n\nAs an added benefit, the Expansion Pack membership includes free DLC for a trio of exclusive Nintendo Switch games.\n\nHere are the DLC packs included with the NSO Expansion Pack:\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons: Happy Home Paradise\n\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe: Booster Course Pass\n\nSplatoon 2: Octo Expansion\n\nNintendo Switch Online SP games\n\nSwitch Online also includes special SP versions of certain games. SP games are essentially save states that drop you in at particular points in a game. This can offer a more challenging experience, while other SP games dish out extra items at the beginning to make it more forgiving.\n\nYou can find a list of all SP games available with Switch Online below:\n\nBlaster Master - The Underworld Lord Awaits\n\nDr. Mario - The UFO Cover-Up\n\nGhosts ’n Goblins - The Great Demon Lord Awaits\n\nGradius - Stage 5 And Maxed Out!\n\nGradius - The Second Loop\n\nKid Icarus - The Three Sacred Treasures\n\nKirby Super Star SP - Meta Knight's revenge!\n\nKirby's Adventure - Now with Extra Game!\n\nKirby's Dream Course SP - Dancy along with Kirby!\n\nKirby's Dream Land 3 SP - Set difficulty to Easy Breezy!\n\nMetroid - Samus Aran's Ultimate Arsenal\n\nMetroid - The Decisive Battle Against Ridley!\n\nMighty Bomb Jack - High Game Deviation Value!\n\nNinja Gaiden - The Thrilling Climax!\n\nStar Soldier - Certain Victory on Stage 8\n\nSuper Mario Bros. 3 - Mario, the Quick-Change Artist!\n\nSuper Mario Kart SP - Fully Souped Up!\n\nSuper Mario World SP - Give the world a whole new look!\n\nSuper Metroid SP - Samus Aran's Ultimate Arsenal!\n\nSuper Punch-Out!!

These games come with the '99' subtitle and take existing, beloved experiences and give them a battle royale twist - where you have to be the last player standing.\n\nHere are all the 99 games available with Switch Online:\n\nTetris 99\n\nF-Zero 99\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan I play NSO games offline?\n\nAll of the classic games available with Nintendo Switch Online can be played offline. However, an active NSO membership is required, and you must connect to the internet every seven days to verify your membership. .\n\nDo I need the Expansion Pack?\n\nThe Expansion Pack is an extra membership tier that offers access to more retro games and DLC that you'd usually have to pay for. If you just want to play classic NES, SNES, and Game Boy games then the base membership will suit you fine. This tier also lets you play multiplayer games online, store your saved data in the cloud, take advantage of game trials, and play Tetris 99 and F-Zero 99. However, if you mainly want to play Mega Drive, N64, and Game Boy Advance games then you'll have to fork out extra for the Expansion Pack. This membership tier offers everything available with the base NSO plan, along with the libraries for this trio of systems.\n\nHow much does NSO cost?\n\nNintendo offers many different options for people thinking of signing up to Switch Online. You can get an NSO membership for a single account for one month (£3.49), three months (£6.99) or 12 months (£17.99). If you want access to the Expansion Pack, then that costs £34.99 for 12 months access for a single account. Nintendo also offers family plans which cover up to eight accounts. If you go down this route, 12 months access for the base NSO membership costs £31.49, while NSO and the Expansion Pack costs £59.99. Nintendo doesn't offer one or three month options for the family plan."
