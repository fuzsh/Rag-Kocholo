        "text": "Sunsoft's logo\n\nLocation:\n\nKōnan, Aichi, Japan\n\nFounded:\n\nApril 16, 1971\n\nDefunct:\n\nstill active\n\nSunsoft (サンソフト San sofuto?) is a Japanese Videogame developer founded on April 16, 1971 as a division of Sun Corporation, itself a division of Sun Electronics, or Sun Denshi Corporation (サン電子株式会社 San Denshi kabushikigaisha?) in Japan (its U.S. subsidiary operated under the name Sunsoft of America, though games they published showed a logo that read only SUNSOFT). They are the actual owners of Telenet Japan's game catalog including the Valis series.\n\nHistory[]\n\nSunsoft's history in video games began in arcades with two video games released in 1978: Block Challenger and Block Perfect. They later had several arcade hits in the early 1980s such as Arabian, Ikki and Kangaroo. In the latter half of the 1980s, Sunsoft began developing original games and technology for the home video game console market, with emphasis mostly on the NES. Sunsoft had gone international at that time, and it had the publishing might to secure major licenses of the day (such as Batman and The Addams Family).\n\nOutside Japan, the definite golden era for the company was the 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), on which their games were widely considered state of the art in graphical and aural prowess. Sunsoft was slow to transition to 16-bit consoles, however, releasing several NES and Famicom titles that went unnoticed at launch, and have only been rediscovered by enthusiasts recently, such as: Ufouria (Hebereke), Mr. Gimmick (Gimmick!), and Journey to Silius (Raf World). Additionally, a number of Sega games, including Fantasy Zone, Fantasy Zone II and After Burner, have been ported for Nintendo consoles by Sunsoft. The games Sunsoft produced in the 16-bit era were no longer as polished or cutting-edge, the licenses were less prominent, and no new hit games appeared. Finally, in 1995, they heavily restructured in the face of bankruptcy, eventually resurfacing with a scant number of video games for the PlayStation such as Monster Seed and games for the Game Boy Color. From 1994 to 1998, Sunsoft attempted the fighting game craze by releasing four fighting games: Sugoi Hebereke for the Super Famicom (1994), Galaxy Fight: Universal Warriors for the Neo Geo (1995), Waku Waku 7 for the Neo Geo (1996), and finally, Astra Super Stars for Sega ST-V-based arcades (1998).\n\nPrior to its re-emergence in the domestic USA, the last games released and published by this company state-side were Eternal Eyes, Blaster Master: Blasting Again, Blaster Master: Enemy Below and Power Quest. Citing several factors, like yet-another \"next generation\" console transition, and high overhead production costs, Sunsoft closed its offices in America and Europe, and initiated a re-organization. Sunsoft has continued to operate out of its corporate headquarters in Japan, developing and publishing role-playing video games, pachinko games and mahjong games and mobile platform titles in partnership with other companies such as NTT DoCoMo and Yahoo!\n\nIn the 1990s, Sunsoft joined forces with Acclaim Entertainment to handle ad sales rights to Sunsoft's video games for game consoles.\n\nOn September 14, 2006, Nintendo announced that the developer was a partner on the Wii's Virtual Console. Although this relationship with Nintendo took more than three years to release any games, on December 4, 2009, Sunsoft announced that they were partnering with GaijinWorks to bring Blaster Master to Virtual Console that month for 500 Wii Points. Also as of December 10, 2009, the company has also acquired Telenet Japan's entire game library On February 6, 2010, Sunsoft announced the release of Blaster Master: Overdrive for WiiWare, 2 days prior to its release. Afterwards, Sunsoft also released Aero the Acro-Bat, Aero the Acro-Bat 2, and Ufouria (Hebereke) on Virtual Console.\n\nList of games[]\n\nAcme Animation Factory (SNES)\n\nAdian no Tsue (Famicom Disk System)\n\nAero the Acro-Bat (SNES, Sega Genesis) (developed by Iguana Entertainment)\n\nAero the Acro-Bat 2 (SNES, Sega Genesis) (developed by Iguana Entertainment)\n\nAlbert Odyssey (SNES)\n\nAlbert Odyssey 2\n\nAlbert Odyssey: Legend of Eldean\n\nArabian (Arcade)\n\nSuper Arabian (NES)\n\nAstra Super Stars (Sega Saturn)\n\nAtlantis no Nazo (NES)\n\nBarbapapa (PlayStation)\n\nBanbam (Arcade)\n\nBatman (Sega Genesis)\n\nBatman (NES, Game Boy)\n\nBatman (TurboGrafx-16)\n\nBatman: Return of the Joker (NES, Sega Genesis (titled as Revenge of the Joker), Game Boy)\n\nBarcode World (NES)\n\nBenkei Gaiden (TurboGrafx-16)\n\nBlaster Master series:\n\nBlaster Master (Chô Wakusei Senki Metafight in Japan) (NES)\n\nBlaster Master Boy (Game Boy; possible conversion of Hudson Soft's Bomber Boy)\n\nBlaster Master 2 (Sega Genesis) (developed by Software Creations)\n\nBlaster Master: Enemy Below (Metafight EX in Japan) (Game Boy Color)\n\nBlaster Master: Blasting Again (Blaster Master in Japan) (PlayStation)\n\nBlaster Master: Overdrive (Wii)\n\nBlock Challenger (also known as Block Perfect or Galaxy Force) (Arcade)\n\nBubble and Squeak (Sega Genesis)\n\nBugs Bunny Rabbit Rampage (SNES)\n\nCity Hunter (TurboGrafx-16)\n\nClock Tower 3 (PlayStation 2, published by Capcom in America and Europe)\n\nChameleon Twist (Nintendo 64)\n\nChameleon Twist 2 (Nintendo 64)\n\nCosmopolis (Arcade)\n\nDaedalian Opus (Game Boy)\n\nDaffy Duck: The Marvin Missions (SNES, Game Boy)\n\nDai San Wakusei (roughly translated as The Third Planet) (Arcade)\n\nDaze Before Christmas (SNES, Sega Mega DriveGenesis)\n\nDead Zone (Famicom Disk System)\n\nDeae Tonosama Appare Ichiban (SNES)\n\nDeath and Return of Superman (SNES, Sega Genesis)\n\nDisney's Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Quest (Sega Genesis)\n\nDisney's Beauty and the Beast: Roar of the Beast (Sega Genesis)\n\nEternal Eyes (PlayStation)\n\nFester's Quest (NES)\n\nFinal Fantasy Adventure (Game Boy; re-release of a Square title from the Mana series)\n\nThe Final Fantasy Legend (Game Boy; re-release of a Square title from the SaGa series)\n\nFinal Fantasy Legend II (Game Boy; re-release of a Square title from the SaGa series)\n\nFinal Fantasy Legend III (Game Boy; re-release of a Square title from the SaGa series)\n\nFirepower 2000 (SNES)\n\nFlashback (Super Famicom)\n\nFreedom Force (NES)\n\nFunky Fish (Arcade)\n\nGalaxy Fight: Universal Warriors (Neo Geo, Sega Saturn)\n\nGimmick!
