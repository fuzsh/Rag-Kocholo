        "text": "Telenet's logo first used in 1992\n\nLocation:\n\nTokyo, Japan\n\nHead People:\n\nKazuyuki Fukushima\n\nFounded:\n\n1983\n\nDefunct:\n\n2007\n\nAlso Known as:\n\nNihon Telenet, Nippon Telenet\n\nTelenet Japan Co., Ltd. (株式会社日本テレネット Kabushiki-gaisha Nihon Terenetto?) was a Japanese video games and software developer founded in October 1983 by Kazuyuki Fukushima. Responsible of the birth and death of the Valis series and many other game series.\n\nHistory[]\n\nTheir first game was a single racing game called American Truck for the home computers MSX and PC-88. It started developing mostly platformer and RPG games for such systems and the success of some of them lead consequently to console adaptions. They were allied with NEC thus releasing most of their games for the PC-Engine CD/Turbografx-CD and later for Sega's Mega Drive/Genesis; thus some of them arrived in America, although most of them remained in Japan. This lead to the foundation of their American Publisher, Renovation Games, which years after was acquired by Sega. Other known subsidiaries of Telenet were Riot, Wolfteam and Shin Nihon Laser Soft.\n\nThrough the years after the 90s most of Telenet Japan's games were ports of other common games with poor quality that didn't sell too much leading the company to a crisis where it was decided to resurrect the Valis series and Arcus series by giving their rights to Eants in order to make adult themed visual novels with the characters of such series and save the company. But nothing went as planned and finally the company closed its doors in 2007.\n\nGames List[]\n\nPublished[]\n\nGame Boy\n\nPachinko CR: Daiku no Gen-San GB\n\nGame Gear\n\nZan Gear\n\nMega Drive/Genesis\n\nGaiares\n\nSyd of Valis\n\nThe Tennis Tournament: Grandslam\n\nTraysia\n\nValis III\n\nValis: The Fantasm Soldier\n\nZan: Yasha Enbukyoku\n\nArcus Odyssey\n\nEl Viento\n\nGain Ground\n\nEarnest Evans\n\nWhip Rush\n\nArrow Flash\n\nDino Land\n\nExile\n\nBeast Wrestler\n\nMaster of Monsters\n\nSol Feace\n\nYs III: Wanderers from Ys\n\nGranada\n\nFinal Zone\n\nMega-CD\n\nCyborg 009\n\nSol-Feace\n\nCobra Command\n\nTime Gal\n\nRoad Avenger\n\nCosmic Fantasy Stories\n\nEarnest Evans\n\nMSX\n\nSa-Zi-Ri\n\nValis II\n\nAlbatross Tournament Golf\n\nAmerican Truck\n\nExile\n\nNintendo 64\n\nParlor Pro Pachinko\n\nPC\n\nAlbatross\n\nAlbatross 2: Master's History\n\nValis X\n\nZan\n\nZan II\n\nZan III\n\nPlayStation\n\nCybernetic Empire\n\nPlayStation 2\n\nEnjoy Golf!\n\nMahjong Party: Idol to Mahjong Shoubu\n\nSuper Famicom/Super NES\n\nDark Kingdom\n\nDoomsday Warrior\n\nThe Journey Home\n\nSuper Valis IV\n\nZan II Spirits\n\nZan III Spirits\n\nPsycho Dream\n\nPC Engine/TurboGrafx-16/TurboGrafx\n\nAndre Panza Kick Boxing\n\nAvenger\n\nBabel\n\nBrowning\n\nColumns\n\nCosmic Fantasy\n\nCosmic Fantasy II\n\nCosmic Fantasy Visual Collection\n\nCosmic Fantasy III\n\nCosmic Fantasy IV-Chapter 1\n\nCosmic Fantasy IV-Chapter 2\n\nDeath Bringer-Knight of Darkness\n\nDekoboko Densetsu Hashiru Wagamanma\n\nExile\n\nExile: Wicked Phenomenon\n\nFinal Zone II\n\nF1 Team Simulation Project F\n\nGolden Axe\n\nHigh Grenadier\n\nJantei Monogatari\n\nKiaiden 00\n\nLady Phantom\n\nLast Alert\n\nLegion\n\nMaho Shoujo Silky Lip\n\nMeikyu no Elfeene\n\nMirai Shounen Conan\n\nSuper Albatross\n\nValis: The Fantasm Soldier\n\nValis II\n\nValis III\n\nValis IV\n\nValis Visual Collection\n\nPolice Connection\n\nPop 'n Magic\n\nPsychic Storm\n\nPuzzle Boy\n\nSugoroku '92 Nari Tore Nariagari Trendy\n\nSuper Albatross\n\nTenshi No Uta\n\nTenshi No Uta II Da Tenshi no Sentaku\n\nTravel Epuru\n\nXak I & II\n\nZan Kagerou No Toki\n\nSharp X68000\n\nDeath Bringer\n\nSol-Feace\n\nValis II\n\nDeveloped[]\n\nMega Drive/Genesis\n\nBeast Wrestler\n\nExile\n\nGaiares\n\nSyd of Valis\n\nTraysia\n\nValis III\n\nMSX\n\nValis\n\nValis II\n\nNintendo 64\n\nParlor Pro Pachinko\n\nGameCube\n\nWaiWai Golf (a.k.a.
