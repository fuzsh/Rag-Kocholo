        "text": "For December, I had accepted the fact that I won't hit my target of 40 video games. In fact I didn't even beat last year's record if I got my notes right. But what I did decide to do was go for the ones that I had wanted to play immediately and that was the classic PlayStation games that were available on PlayStation 5. These are all short in length but still proper games at the end of the day and I had a good time with each one.\n\n#22 - Jet Moto (Jet Racer) (PlayStation via PS5)\n\nAcquired: November 2023 (via PS3)\n\nThe first PlayStation classic that I decided to play is Jet Moto, also known as Jet Racer in Europe. This is a racing game released in 1996 by developer SingleTrac, the folks behind Twisted Metal 1 & 2, where you drive a floating jet and it's an intriguing title.\n\nThe concept is pretty simple, you race to reach the finish line but this is no easy game in all honestly. Jet Moto has some complicated controls and gameplay as your bike is rather sensitive, so if you don't angle your vehicle correctly you will swerve off the edge and even hit the various obstacles that are in your way, like trees or props. You can even hit the checkpoint header in one of the maps which is pretty funny to see.\n\nThe game offers different modes, from a regular race and tutorials, to tournaments and elimination rounds. As you race the tournaments you do unlock more maps to play and add more variety to the repetitiveness of the game. The maps even have hidden paths which I found one by accident. Also on the maps are a lot of steep curves which sounds like a challenging but your vehicle can grapple onto a pole so you can swerve around the corner and maintain your speed which is a good feature for a game like this.\n\nFor a short game I did like what the game provides. The rag doll when your character hits an object was entertaining even if its annoying but the emulator's rewind feature does help for situations like this. While I don't necessarily enjoy every single map, the level design was pretty solid and the grapple concept was cool.\n\nThe trophies for this game are pretty simple. Race every map, win each type of mode and play a certain number of races. I got the Platinum trophy after about 2 hours of playtime. Because the game does make you swerve numerous times I did take breaks here and there to avoid any form of motion sickness.\n\nAlso a bonus mention - normally when it comes to re-releases onto emulators that sometimes licensing and banners tend to get updated due to expirations but this release on PlayStation 5 has kept the advertisements which is a surprise.\n\nOverall Jet Moto was a fun little game and I recommend giving it a shot on the PlayStation Plus service if you have that. I bought the game on the PlayStation 3 store to get the PS5 version for free.\n\n#23 - Jumping Flash! (PlayStation via PS5)\n\nAcquired: June 2022 (April 2021 via PS3)\n\nThe second PlayStation classic is an early launch game from 1995 with Jumping Flash! by Japanese developers Exact and Ultra, with some assistance from Japan Studio. This is a platformer where your goal is to find some carrots on each stage before proceeding to the next, and along the way you can even find a special stage to play around with.\n\nDespite being a launch game, the visuals look pretty good and runs fairly well. The controls for the camera is my only major issue because it's not aged well, and part of that is due to how this came before the analog sticks were introduced. I did enjoy the first-person perspective and when you jump around your shadow helps with guiding you to where you are at on the map.\n\nThe enemies have a good variety but I tend to avoid them as it's easy to dodge. That said you do have the option to shoot them when needed. They do respawn though from what I have seen. The boss fights were neat and one of them I did have an issue with at first until I realised that jumping and falling can do tons of damage to them. The final boss was a challenge as they tend to run away and hit you at various angles but overall it was a good time.\n\nFor a short game Jumping Flash! was pretty fun, and they did patch it to include trophy support which is completing the game and getting all of the collectibles and extra stages completed. I bought the game on the PlayStation 3 store back when the store was planned to be closed, so the PS5 version was available for free.\n\n#24 - I.Q.: Intelligent Qube (Kurushi) (PlayStation via PS5)\n\nAcquired: June 2023 (via PS3)\n\nNext is a game that I am very familiar with but never managed to play and that was I.Q.: Intelligent Qube, also known as Kurushi in Europe. Developed by G-Artists Inc. (PoPoLoCrois) in 1997, the game is a very fun puzzle experience.\n\nIn fact knowing about the series I was worried it would be too complicated but in reality it is a lot simpler than it looks and the video tutorials were handy to learn how the game's mechanics works. The idea is that you need to get rid of the cubes in front of you before they crush you or they fall off the edge behind you. You highlight a block and when the cube lands on it, you press a button to make it disappear.\n\nThere are three types of cubes. The regular grey cubes are the ones you can remove as per normal, then there's colourful ones where if you highlight and remove it it will also highlight all of the squares around it which extends even further if another colourful cube is caught in the mix. Then you have the black cubes which are the ones you want to avoid highlighting and capturing. You can highlight a cube and let the cube go past it, but capturing black cubes will result in your path behind you losing space which is what you want to avoid.\n\nAnd to mention again, when you highlight blocks, it will stay there for as long as you want it to be before pressing the button to remove it, even if its going to take about 5-10 more seconds to get the right cubes. This tactic is useful for situations where the black cubes are in the way before getting the right combination.\n\nThe game adds more challenge to the mix for each stage as it adds more columns to the mix. I was able to get through roughly 80-85% of the game without having to use the rewind feature just so that I don't end up getting any rows behind me removed. The trophies for this game is essentially finish the stages which is fine, and if you want more challenge the second game is also available on PlayStation 5 (which is PAL only as it wasn't released in North America).\n\nOverall Kurushi was a lot of fun and took a few hours to finish. I highly recommend playing this game if you like to try out a classic PS1 puzzle to play next.\n\n#25 - Ape Escape (PlayStation via PS5)\n\nAcquired: June 2023 (via PS3)\n\nI've played an Ape Escape game before when I was younger and I believe it was Ape Escape 2, but I never owned it, only rented it. The closest that I got to owning an Ape Escape game was with Eye Toy: Monkey Mania on the PlayStation 2. So being able to play the original Ape Escape was a treat and its neat to see Sony bringing it back as a Classic title for PlayStation 5 was appreciated especially as the first three games were not added onto the Classics line-up on PlayStation 3 in the west (Japan got them at least). The second game is on PlayStation 4 via the PS2 on PS4 line-up but is only the PAL version.\n\nSo how do I feel about the original 1999 Ape Escape game from Japan Studio after all of these years. I felt the game held up pretty well and had a fun time going through each level. The game uses the analog sticks a lot and part of that is to showcase PlayStation's DualShock controller and in most cases it works really well, except that I had struggled a lot with the boats.\n\nI have been told that I wasn't controlling the boats properly but I do think they are messy regardless (I also kept spinning in circles which is funny not going to lie), and while the idea works the execution I felt doesn't age well. Controlling the tank later in the game weren't too bad though. Besides those two, the rest of the controls works fairly well and I got used to how the mechanics work.\n\nThe game has a ton of gadget variety to capture the apes, from an RC Car, slingshot, dash hoop and the most powerful one which isn't available until you finish the normal ending of the story - the magic punch. Each gadget has a tutorial stage before you are able to use them in the levels which is handy to learn how they work. Much like a lot of platformer games, you won't be able to 100% the levels as soon as you enter them because a lot of apes are not accessible due to not having the right gadget available. Alongside the apes in each level are gold coins which you can collect to unlock some mini-games which involve ski racing and even a punch-out.\n\nI didn't go for 100% completion in this game but I was able to get over 100 apes and over 40 gold coins that qualify for the Platinum trophy. If you want to get the best ending in the game you'll need to find all of the apes in each level. It's fairly lengthy at about 8 hours spent on the normal route in general so there's enough value here to enjoy.\n\n#26 - Twisted Metal (PlayStation via PS5)\n\nAcquired: November 2023\n\nAfter a brief break I started Twisted Metal, the second SingleTrac game in this backlog to play, released in 1995. The Twisted Metal franchise is one that I am familiar with but much like Ape Escape I never played them. I did consider the PlayStation 3 instalment but decided to focus on the classics that Sony added earlier in the year. I did attempt to get the games on PlayStation 3 but when they were added onto modern platforms it corrupted the listing on PS3's store so I had to go to support to fix that and rebuy them from PS5.\n\nTwisted Metal is a vehicular combat game where you control a vehicle and destroy every enemy vehicle in your map across multiple stages. Each stage adds an extra vehicle enemy to battle and eventually you'll land on the final stage which has a big enemy type that is challenging to beat.\n\nDespite its concept and age, Twisted Metal is actually really surprisingly challenging to play because of how much damage you can take, which carries over into the next stage adding more difficulty to the mix. The benefit of this game however, is that it does not punish you for using password codes to continue where you left off. For me this is essentially like restarting a stage with full health than making the enemies easier to beat. Heck the game does provide difficulty levels but the only difference is how many lives you receive which doesn't add much.\n\nTwisted Metal does have credit for having different variety of designs and stats for each vehicle that's available for you to control. Some deal better damage, some have better pacing and some use specific weapons that can be close-range or easy to use. In addition each vehicle's stages has different enemies to fight which makes each experience different and better paced. I also loved how some cars just fall off the edge at random though.\n\nI used the password method for the trophies so that I can replay the final stage for each character which can take ages as there's a lot of vehicles to use. The progress was roughly about almost 3 hours get the Platinum trophy, but overall I found Twisted Metal to be a solid start to a franchise for Sony. I have heard the second game is a big improvement so I'm curious to see how that's done.\n\n#27 - Hot Shots Golf (Everybody's Golf) (PlayStation via PS5)\n\nAcquired: June 2023\n\nFrom the Japanese studio that brought you the Shining Force games, Mario Golf and Golden Sun comes the first instalment in the Everybody's Golf franchise, also known in North America as Hot Shots Golf. For an old game, this was a lot of fun to play.\n\nThis game holds up pretty well on PlayStation 5, with a wide variety of characters and courses you can play and beat. The controls are pretty solid and the rewind feature from the emulator is your best friend here due to the challenge and RNG the game throws in your face.\n\nSpeaking of RNG, this is the game's biggest problem because its so random that it makes the idea of reaching a hole in one or an Albatross extremely low in chance because of the positioning of your ball but also the wind direction which changes for each time you enter the course. Despite that though, the courses themselves I appreciated its design and the AI you go up against is pretty decent as it's not annoying but not dumb either, though some do end up hitting their ball into the water from time to time.\n\nI was able to unlock all of the characters at a steady pace and unlock the later courses via the tournament without too much grinding required. I will admit that I did use practice mode to get the Albatross and Hole in One trophies. I did try to get them both on the regular courses but the RNG made it near impossible in a lot of my shots (they were very close but wasn't doable). I managed to get the Platinum trophy after roughly 11 hours.\n\nMuch like Twisted Metal, I have heard the next game is much better on the performance so I look forward to it.\n\n#28-#30 - Syphon Filter, Syphon Filter 2 & Syphon Filter 3 (PlayStation via PS5)\n\nAcquired: June 2023 (via PS3)\n\nAt this point I caught a bad cold which was absolutely frustrating because I had finally taken the time off work that I needed. Miraculously I was just well enough to play some more classic PlayStation games and to wrap up the year I decided to play all three games in the Syphon Filter trilogy released in 1999, 2000 & 2001 by Bend Studio (Bubsy 3D).\n\nAgain like the others in this backlog, I've been fully aware of the Syphon Filter franchise but I never understood why it was popular. After playing these games I can definitely see the appeal that it brings because it's a great addition to the PlayStation backlog even with its unique control scheme.\n\nSyphon Filter is an action stealth third person shooter game where you control a few characters, mainly our main lead Logan, as he kills enemies, completes objectives and makes sure the job is done in his spy adventure. The first game came out after Metal Gear Solid and before more 007 games were being released so it was left under the radar by a lot of people but did well enough to keep the franchise going.\n\nThe controls is interesting because it is unusual. You have the D-Pad/Left Analog stick to move your character forward, backwards and sideways. Then you have L2 & R2 to strife side-ways as you shoot against other enemies. Then there's L1 for a first-person view to get a better accurate shot, while R1 is a lock-on which is fine but a lot of enemies tend to have armour which makes this idea rather useless. In addition to shooting, you can also perform a barrel roll and use the Select button to switch weapons. In the first game I struggled on the first mission because there's a flashlight that you needed to use which can only be accessed in the menu and not in the select section which was rather annoying. I have noticed that the lock-on is rather delayed for shooting so it does make some moments frustrating.\n\nI do think the first mission does setup the controls and concept of the Syphon Filter games very well, and in general I had a great time with each one. Each game does have their ups and downs interestingly. I found the stealth to be decent but in a lot of cases it can be a pain in the neck. The weapon variety is really cool and I love how the weapons and armour stay on the ground on the level so you can backtrack and pick them up without having to worry about them disappearing. The enemies do respawn when backtracking which is annoying and you can easily force yourself to backtrack because you didn't fulfil an objective.\n\nEach game has some really well done level designs. In the first game, I did find the ending missions to be very reactive (i.e you need to be quick) because you can easily get killed if you aren't careful. The second game improves on its storytelling narrative though it does fall flat in its final few missions, but I found the constant use of having to perform headshots on enemies rather annoying. The third game tries to provide a balance but there were some missions that really frustrated me especially the one in the desert where you are defending a vehicle and enemies randomly appear to which if you aren't fast enough you can get a game over immediately.\n\nThe Rewind feature is your saving grace for these games due to how ******** some of the 'mission failed/parameter failed' notices you get throughout.\n\nThe graphics hold up pretty well and I thought it was interesting how the first game had some mouth movement, the second game didn't and then the third game went for CG cutscenes. UI and everything else wasn't updated so it does feel like you're playing the same game at times. The story was intriguing. The first game felt too fast paced so it was easy to get lost, the second game improved on the pacing but it falters in its last few chapters, and the third game felt like an oddity from the others due to the direction they went with its storytelling. Despite the story, I did like Logan and Lian as characters that you follow throughout. Somewhat reminds me of Mission Impossible at times. The voice acting has aged but at least they tried.\n\nThat said, despite my issues I am still very much interested in what else the Syphon Filter franchise has to offer and I got the Platinum trophy for each game in the series. The first game took me 7 hours to finish the story, the second game was much longer at 8 hours, while the third game is shorter at about 6 hours. The trophies are mostly just finishing the story which is fine by me.\n\nAll three games I bought on the PlayStation 3 store to get them for cheaper as they will provide the PlayStation 5 version for free.\n\nMy backlog so far:\n\n#​\n\nPC/Steam Backlog - Game Name:​\n\nGenre:\n\n1​\n\nThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the SkyTurn-Based RPG\n\n2​\n\nThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SCTurn-Based RPG\n\n#​\n\nPlayStation 3 Backlog - Game Name:​\n\nGenre:\n\n1​\n\n3D Dot Game HeroesAction RPG\n\n2​\n\nBleach: Soul ResurrecciónFighting\n\n3​\n\nCastlevania: Lords of ShadowAction, Hack n Slash\n\n4​\n\nCatherinePuzzle\n\n5​\n\nDrakengard 3Action RPG\n\n6​\n\nEternal SonataTurn-Based RPG\n\n7​\n\nFolkloreAction RPG\n\n8​\n\nGran Turismo 5 Academy EditionRacing\n\n9​\n\ninFAMOUSAction\n\n10​\n\ninFAMOUS 2Action\n\n11​\n\nKatamari ForeverPuzzle\n\n12​\n\nPrince of PersiaAction, Platformer\n\n13​\n\nPuppeteerPlatformer\n\n14​\n\nSEGA RallyRacing\n\n15​\n\nSly Cooper: Thieves in TimeAction, Platformer\n\n16​\n\nSplit/Second: VelocityRacing\n\n17​\n\nStrangleholdAction, Shooter\n\n18​\n\nTears to Tiara II: Heir of the OverlordTactical RPG, Visual Novel\n\n19​\n\nWay of the Samurai 4Action\n\n#​\n\nPlayStation 4 Backlog - Game Name:Genre:\n\n1​\n\n13 Sentinels: Aegis RimTactical RPG, Visual Novel\n\n2​\n\nAI: The Somnium FilesAdventure, Visual Novel\n\n3​\n\nBlack Clover: Quartet KnightsAction, Fighting\n\n4​\n\nBullet Girls PhantasiaAction, Shooter\n\n5​\n\nBurnout Paradise RemasteredRacing\n\n6​\n\nThe Caligula Effect: OverdoseTurn-Based RPG\n\n7​\n\nCaptain Tsubasa: Rise of New ChampionsSports\n\n8​\n\nCatherine Full BodyPuzzle\n\n9​\n\nChaos;ChildVisual Novel\n\n10​\n\nConception Plus: Maidens of the Twelve StarsTurn-Based RPG\n\n11​\n\nCRYSTARAction RPG\n\n12​\n\nCyberdimension Neptunia: Four Goddesses OnlineAction RPG\n\n13​\n\nDanganronpa 1 ReloadVisual Novel\n\n14​\n\nDanganronpa 2 ReloadVisual Novel\n\n15​\n\nDanganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair GirlsAction, Shooter\n\n16​\n\nDanganronpa V3: Killing HarmonyVisual Novel\n\n17​\n\nDate A Live: Rinne Utopia (Rio-Reincarnation)Visual Novel, Dating Sim\n\n18​\n\nDate A Live II: Ars Install (Rio-Reincarnation)Visual Novel, Dating Sim\n\n19​\n\nDate A Live III: Twin Edition: Rio ReincarnationVisual Novel, Dating Sim\n\n20​\n\nDigimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's MemoryTurn-Based RPG\n\n21​\n\nDisaster Report 4: Summer MemoriesAdventure, Simulation\n\n22​\n\nDissidia Final Fantasy NTArcade, Fighting\n\n23​\n\nDragon Quest Heroes IIAction RPG, Musou\n\n24​\n\nDragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive EditionTurn-Based RPG\n\n25​\n\nDragon's Crown ProAction RPG\n\n26​\n\nFairy TailTurn-Based RPG\n\n27​\n\nFate/Extella LinkMusou\n\n28​\n\nFinal Fantasy IXTurn-Based RPG\n\n29​\n\nFinal Fantasy VIII RemasteredTurn-Based RPG\n\n30​\n\nFull Metal Panic!

There are some new things to do, and there was a pretty cool ending thing to do after all the main stories were done.\n\nOST was as usual very good, and I quite like the 2.5D art that this type of game has, but I wish they'd tone down the blurring stuff a bit around the edges of your view. Voice acting was very good (I play this in Jpn audio with subs) and the story arcs for most characters were interesting, though naturally some were more interesting than others.\n\nI disliked that you had to swap party members to be able to do the various actions each one had when using against townspeople. Gearing felt pretty meh in general, I wound up just clicking the auto-gear everyone option, because trying to juggle 8 characters and gear was not my idea of fun.\n\nI'd like to have the ability to swap my party members around whenever I wanted without the need to visit a tavern, the current story character would probably need to be locked in but should be able to swap the other 3 around at will. Difficulty wise I found most encounters either way too easy, or too hard, as you run about and do story chapters, it can become difficult to strike the right balance for challenge as enemies don't scale with your level and your party can have unbalanced levels and such.\n\nOn the whole I enjoyed this one much like the 1st game.\n\nFF7 Remake pt1 Intergrade\n\nIt's been ages since I played this, with Rebirth coming out soon I figured it wasn't a bad time to replay this one, and with Intergrade I can also do the Yuffie DLC.\n\nThis is still a great game I think, but it's not perfect. The game at times feels far too linear (something Rebirth looks like it will solve). Often I am stuck traversing through the same terrain a few times, and a lot of the routes you can go feel like corridors of a maze more than areas to explore.\n\nTrying to min/max learning skills from weapons, and leveling materia isn't bad, but by the time you're almost done, the game is ending! I had the same issue in both the main game and the Yuffie DLC.\n\nSpeaking of, Yuffie DLC was new to me, and I enjoyed this one, I was sad it ended so soon because I was getting into it and enjoying the flow of this, in some ways more than the main game.\n\nThere are some reasons for this, but primarily:\n\nCombat with Yuffie is more fun than with Cloud and the crew, the mobility of her throwing star thing allowing you to teleport about, along with her elemental infusion techniques and ninjutsu stuff she can do is a lot more engaging to play for me.\n\nI enjoyed the Fort Condor mini-game a lot, and almost the first thing I did was running around finding people to play against. I beat all of them and became a grand-master in no time at all.\n\nIt was fun just having a stupid goal of getting materia, without the gravity of the concurrent main story that was going on, it was a bit more light-hearted.\n\nI did the Soldier challenge and got 50K points, that took me a good couple of hours, a very hard challenge, but the gamer in me wouldn't admit defeat on that one so I kept at it until I got it.\n\nYuffie is a bit too \"genki-girl\" for me though, Tifa is still best girl by far.\n\nI am awaiting releases of the following games:\n\nPersona 3 Reload\n\nFF7 Rebirth\n\nWhilst I am waiting for these I am a little unsure what to do next. I am still playing Elden Ring (about 50 hours into my 1st run) but alongside that, I want something else to get stuck into. AC Valhalla is OK but it's a little samey, and I think Elden Ring is the better adventuring game, but I may flip back to it once I put that down.\n\nI could try and get all of the endings on Triangle Strategy. I have not done them all.\n\nI was considering playing the Trails games, but it's a very big commit, and some of those games are very old at this point, so am not sure if I want to commit the time to it, I also generally prefer newer games that have better graphics/quality of life (not that old games can't be good, but I just want the same sort of quality with great visuals!).\n\nAlso on my consideration list is the Xenoblade chronicle games, but for a similar reason (bit commit) I haven't started them yet.\n\nSpiderman 2 is one of those cases where I started convincing myself I did not need to get it day 1 but when reviews started coming out, I took notice. That kind of warped my expectations and I was really bummed with it being so derivative overall, as I said earlier in the thread. Had no drive to do anything beyond the main story. The Wolverine footage that’s out there makes it feel more focused.\n\nIt was good but I am not a completionist either, I did all the main stuff and as much side stuff as I felt like, then chopped it in on resale. It felt like just another iteration of Spiderman mostly, but was still a decent game I think.\n\nReal quick recommendation: if you have Ghostwire Tokyo and somehow haven’t played it since the Spider Thread update, do so for the couple of new missions taking place in a school. There is a (small) part in there that is extremely effective. Diapers recommended.\n\nI don't have Ghostwire Tokyo but having looked at it before, it doesn't seem to be grabbing me as the type of game I'd enjoy necessarily, not even sure why, I just have this feeling lol!\n\nThis was a good one to play over Christmas. It makes a solid first impression with its depiction of Hogwarts itself, a sprawling labyrinth of a school that's filled with quests and environmental puzzles, every inch of it lovingly detailed with whimsical charm. For the simple pleasure of just exploring a place without necessarily following quest markers, it might be one of the all-time great game locations, and that's coming from someone who only has a casual interest in the movies (and hasn't read the books...).\n\nThe castle was a fantastic location and I almost think it was worth buying it and playing just to explore the castle and see some of the locations from the movies in the game.\n\nIt was also annoying that it gates an end-of-school-year event (presumably an epilogue) behind a high level requirement that I would probably have needed to do another 10+ hours of sidequests and copy-pasted open world bloat to reach.\n\nThanks for reminding me of this! I'd almost forgotten I also had this pointless end game thing that required me to go and grind some levels to be able to do it!"
