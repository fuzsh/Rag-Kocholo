        "meta_description": "I sure hope you’re curled up on the couch watching a horror movie, because the only thing scary coming out of the Nintendo Switch Online this week is the lack of announcements. The good news is that there are still a lot of 8- and 16-bit games that haven’t been given the Review Crew treatment. Today we’re going to go back and cover three Super NES classics, including Super Valis IV, Breath of Fire and Demon’s Crest. Sure, all three of these games hit Nintendo’s subscription service years ago, but I’m still obligated to ask: Are they actually worth playing? To answer that question, I decided to flip through the pages of Electronic Gaming Monthly, GamePro, Die Hard Game Fan and more classic magazines to see what the critics said back when these games first came out. So, go and grab a fire-resistant suit, because this is going to be another hot, hot episode of Nintendo Switch Online Review Crew.",
