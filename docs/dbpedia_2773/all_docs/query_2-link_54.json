        "text": "Updated with three new GBA Starfy titles following the 12th July 2024 update.\n\nNintendo Switch Online had a slow start initially, but with the introduction of SNES games, we've seen added value coming to the service which better justifies the asking price. Nintendo has been slowly but surely fleshing out the number of games available, now including Game Boy and Game Boy Color titles, and we've pulled together a complete list of all the titles you'll get when you subscribe to the service – including the most recent additions as well as the bonus SP iterations of certain games. We've also listed the Japanese exclusives that aren't available to subscribers in the West (unless you have a Japanese Nintendo Account, of course).\n\nAnd there's also the Expansion Pack tier that features Nintendo 64, Sega Genesis / Mega Drive, and Game Boy Advance games, providing a more varied library of retro games — for a price, of course.\n\nRemember, these games aren't individual downloads but are bundled together in the Nintendo Switch Online NES, SNES, GB, N64, Genesis / Mega Drive, and GBA applications, which are 'free' to download. Each title benefits from save states (and the ability to rewind the action for the NES, SNES, and GB games).\n\nIf you're interested in which games are really worth your time, you can find out in our reader-ranked polls and check out our reviews for many of them:\n\nEvery Nintendo Switch Online NES Game Ranked\n\nEvery Nintendo Switch Online SNES Game Ranked\n\nEvery Nintendo Switch Online Game Boy (Color) Game Ranked\n\nEvery Nintendo Switch Online N64 Game Ranked\n\nEvery Nintendo Switch Online Sega Genesis / Mega Drive Game Ranked\n\nEvery Nintendo Switch Online Game Boy Advance (GBA) Game Ranked\n\nPlease note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale. Please read our FTC Disclosure for more information.\n\nAll Nintendo Switch Online Games\n\nBelow, we have listed every single Nintendo Switch Online game available on the service. We've separated these by console and by region.\n\nNintendo Switch Online: NES Games (78)\n\nThere are currently 78 NES games playable via Nintendo Switch Online.\n\nBalloon Fight\n\nBaseball\n\nDonkey Kong\n\nDouble Dragon\n\nDr. Mario\n\nExcitebike\n\nGhosts ’n Goblins\n\nGradius\n\nIce Climber\n\nIce Hockey\n\nThe Legend of Zelda\n\nMario Bros.\n\nPro Wrestling\n\nRiver City Ransom\n\nSoccer\n\nSuper Mario Bros.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. 3\n\nTecmo Bowl\n\nTennis\n\nYoshi\n\nNES Open Tournament Golf\n\nSolomon's Key\n\nSuper Dodge Ball\n\nMetroid\n\nMighty Bomb Jack\n\nTwinBee\n\nAdventures of Lolo (Western version)\n\nNinja Gaiden\n\nWario's Woods\n\nZelda II: The Adventure of Link\n\nBlaster Master\n\nSuper Mario Bros. 2\n\nKirby's Adventure\n\nKid Icarus\n\nStarTropics (Western exclusive)\n\nSuper Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels\n\nPunch-Out!!

Metroid and Gradius have two SP versions each.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda - Living The Life of Luxury! (Loads of Rupees, all gear)\n\nGradius - Stage 5 And Maxed Out! (Stage 5, full power)\n\nGradius - The Second Loop (Harder difficulty)\n\nMetroid - The Decisive Battle Against Ridley!

Here's an explanation of those options, as well as all the links you need to buy them:\n\nNintendo Switch Online - Standard Membership\n\nThe standard, original Nintendo Switch Online membership gives you access to online multiplayer, as well as all of the NES, SNES, and Game Boy games listed above. We actually offer these subscriptions on our own store for our readers in Europe, and are sometimes able to offer discounts. Any deals will be highlighted below if active:\n\nNintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack\n\nIf you'd like to go one step further, the Expansion Pack tier gives you everything the standard membership has to offer as well as Nintendo 64, Sega Genesis / Mega Drive, and Game Boy Advance games, and some Switch game DLC packs.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat Switch games come with Nintendo Switch Online?\n\nNintendo Switch Online will come with multiple games depending on what tier you sign up for.\n\nIf you subscribe to the standard NSO membership, you will have access to NES, SNES, and Game Boy games.\n\nIf you subscribe to the NSO + Expansion Pack tier, you will have access to NES, SNES, Game Boy, Mega Drive, N64, and Game Boy Advance games, as well as three pieces of DLC for Nintendo Switch games — Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Splatoon 2.\n\nWe will provide a list of all of the games available with each tier of the subscription above, per console.\n\nHow many games are there for Nintendo Switch Online?\n\nCurrently, there are 170 games available through the Nintendo Switch Online standard membership. This does not include titles only available in Japan, or SP versions of games.\n\nNintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers have access to 267 games, which is an additional 97 games. Again, this does not include titles only available in Japan or the SP versions of games.\n\nCan you play all games with Nintendo Switch Online?\n\nYou can play all games available on Nintendo Switch online only if you are subscribed to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack tier.\n\nThis will give you access to all 267 games on the service, plus SP versions. For Japanese-exclusive releases, you will need to create a Japanese Nintendo Switch profile.\n\nRemember, only retro games or select Nintendo Switch DLC are available on the Nintendo Switch Online service. You will still need to buy Nintendo Switch games from the eShop or via online or local retail stores.\n\nWhat are 'SP' versions of Nintendo Switch Online games?\n\nSome NES and SNES games are also available on Nintendo Switch Online as 'SP' or 'Extra' versions.\n\nThese 'Special' versions are usually available alongside the standard version of the game, and change it in some way. This varies between games, but some start out in an entirely different place, while others give you new levels, new items, or new modes.\n\nThey exist to help make old games feel different and encourage you to try out a new take on an old favourite.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing all the NES games available for the Nintendo Switch Online service ranked (or all the SNES games given the same treatment), we've got you covered. Same for every N64 game and every Genesis / Mega Drive game on the service, too. We're nothing if not comprehensive!\n\nThis article is one of our Switch Essentials guides which cover a wide variety of genres, including the Best Switch FPS Games, the Best Switch RPGs, the Best Switch Games For Kids, the Best Switch Couch Co-Op Games and the Best Switch Fitness and Exercise Games. We can also help out hunting down the Best Switch Horror Games, the Best Switch Racing Games, the Best Switch Action-RPGs, the Best Nintendo Switch Roguelikes, Roguelites and Run-Based Games, the Best Free Switch Games, the Best Remakes And Remasters, the Best Switch Music And Rhythm Games, Best Feel-Good Switch Games, Best Switch Open-World Games, Best Switch Soulslike Games, Best LGBTQ+ Switch Games, and even Games to Play After You've Finished Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\n\nWhatever your favourite genre, we've got you covered: Strategy Games, Metroidvanias, Puzzle Games, Party Games, Online Multiplayer Games, Local Wireless Multiplayer Games, Shmups, Twin-Stick Shooters, Visual Novels, Kart Racers, Fighting Games, Football Games, Funny Games, Golf Games, 'Walking Sims' And Narrative Games, Switch Games For Lovers And Lonely Hearts, Detective Games, Hidden Gems, 2D Platformers, 3D Platformers, Puzzle Platformers, Tabletop Mode Games, Run and Gun Games, LEGO Games, Sports Games, Survival Games, Beat 'Em Ups, Camera Games, Chill Games, Family Games, Retro-Inspired Games, Short Games, Card Games and Deck-Builders, and Life Sims And Farming Games.\n\nStill hungry for more?
