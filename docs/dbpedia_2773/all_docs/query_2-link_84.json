        "text": "The collection has just popped up on ESRB with Limited Run Games listed as publisher. I believe this collection includes the first two games.\n\nCosmic Fantasy Collection - ESRB\n\nThis is a collection of two role-playing games in which players control Cosmic Hunter members as they battle space pirates in a fantasy setting. From a ¾-overhead perspective, players explore worlds, interact with characters, and battle human and fantastical enemies (e.\n\nIt's a turn-based JRPG series that was on the PC-Engine CD, one of the first major ones to have anime cutscenes & voice acting. The second game is the only one to have gotten an official release in English, by Working Designs back in the day.\n\nDespite literally using it to name one of my games (Cosmic Star Heroine was named by combining Cosmic Fantasy + Phantasy Star), I've never actually played any of the game, so I'm extremely excited for this, even though I know that chances are they haven't aged the best.\n\nDespite literally using it to name one of my games (Cosmic Star Heroine was named by combining Cosmic Fantasy + Phantasy Star), I've never actually played any of the game, so I'm extremely excited for this, even though I know that chances are they haven't aged the best.\n\nI saw this thread title and that you posted it, and was like \"wait...have I been misreading their game's title all this time?!\"\n\nThink the collection just came out a few days ago in Japan, curious if there's any hands on impressions. If it's like the Valis collections, may just have stuff like rewind, save states, & a music player.\n\nOne of those game franchises I've heard about a few times whenever I'm reading up on the PC Engine, this is the first time these have been re-released? & it seems Sunsoft owned all of Telenet's catalog as well before Edia got the rights in 2020?\n\nVic does\n\nThe Lunar games were only in the Japanese versions of the Genesis 2 Mini because he specifically refused to allow the WD localization to be used unless he got paid more than they were offering.\n\nand considering how much Sega paid for Captain Tsubasa and all the VO rights for that one (seriously I cannot imagine how hard that was to work out)... Yeah, it's pretty clear Vic's being selfish lol. Will never get over how Atgames somehow licensed his turbo translations for their arcade machine though, nor will I get why they'd waste so much money on the EN Exile games when they're borderline broken due to the difficulty edits.\n\nBut I was wondering where this thing went; the crowdfunding campaign for both it and the second collection had English stretch goals and this had taken so long even the telenet shooting set that didn't hit a EN goal got released here before CF. I was worried it was secretly canceled lol\n\ngonna guess that it's subtitling the JP originals like the Valis sets did so thus CF2 will be free of the bad WD script, but that also means the dub is gone, which is a bit of a bummer. On the bright side this means CF 3/4 will be coming later in english as well.\n\nand considering how much Sega paid for Captain Tsubasa and all the VO rights for that one (seriously I cannot imagine how hard that was to work out)...

Vic will never play ball like Sony, Ubisoft and SE did for Grandia.\n\nI'd love to be proven wrong, but I don't think Gungho thinks there's enough of an audience to make it worthwhile to do anything with Lunar these days. Would be amazing to get a Lunar collection on modern consoles.\n\nThey were clearly interested at one point and obviously played ball for the Genesis 2 Mini in Japan.\n\nThe big hurdle is that if Vic is holding out for too much money, they need to relocalize the games. That was probably a non-starter years ago, but something seems to have changed over the past few years that has made it to where there's a lot of interest in going back and localizing some of this stuff. If the Valises, Cosmic Fantasies, and the Ninja Jajamaru-kun RPGs can all receive new localizations (and it must be reiterated that it seems like Cosmic Fantasy 2 is getting relocalized away from WD), then maybe whatever pipeline is helping with that will be enough to make it worthwhile for Gung Ho.\n\nReally, the only thing to worry about at this point would be Lunar getting new localizations without a dub.\n\nWould it be available digitally as well?\n\nThey should be, and if it's like Edia's other collections, you might even be able to buy the games individually as well as collected.\n\nNo clue on when, though it should be sometime before summer based on the LRG release. Most likely well before then. Oddly enough Valis Collection 3 is already available even though it hasn't gone on LRG yet, while Cosmic Fantasy is the opposite.\n\nThey were clearly interested at one point and obviously played ball for the Genesis 2 Mini in Japan.\n\nThe big hurdle is that if Vic is holding out for too much money, they need to relocalize the games.

The Grandia + Grandia II remasters were my initiatives and I fought for 4+ years to make them a reality. There would need to be internal \"champions\" at the US office to make them happen, but after I left, there were no more Game Arts fans left to continue to fight for Lunar or the other Grandias (or even create new games in the franchises or consider GunGriffon, Silpheed, Thexder, etc).\n\nWhen I worked directly with the CEO of GungHo, he didn't care about the Game Arts IPs and had no interest in doing anything with them.

At the very least, I can thank you for championing us getting Grandia 1 rereleased. It is a deeply important game to me and having it available again was a dream I was never expecting to come true.\n\nWell dang.

But alas the gaming industry lost him at such a young age.\n\nah okay - really hoping collection 2 has both parts of 4 on it, then?\n\nLooks like it does.\n\nCosmic Fantasy Collection 2 announced for Switch\n\nEdia has launched a Makuake crowdfunding campaign seeking 3 million yen (approx. $20,700) to fund the release of Cosmic Fantasy Collection 2 for Switch.
