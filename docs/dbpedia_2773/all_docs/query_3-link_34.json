        "text": "Sam Houston State vs. No. 9 Texas\n\nFriday, 4 p.m. • Longhorn Network • Radio on Bearkats Sports Network\n\nAUSTIN - The Sam Houston State softball team will face Texas Friday to open the Austin Regional of the NCAA Tournament at Red and Charline McCombs Field.\n\nThe Bearkats and the No. 9 national-seeded Longhorns will play at 4 p.m. The game will be aired on the Longhorn Network and be radio broadcast online on the Bearkats Sports Network at www.gobearkats.com.\n\nTexas A&M and Houston are the other two teams in the double-elimination regional. The Aggies and Cougars will play Friday at 1 p.m. on ESPN3.\n\nThe Bearkats (34-21) have faced all three teams in the regional this season. Sam Houston State lost 9-1 in five innings at Texas (41-14) on Feb. 22, fell to Houston (37-17) 2-1 on Feb. 10 and 17-1 in five innings on April 30 and dropped a doubleheader to Texas A&M (28-25) 5-4 and 4-3 on March 27.\n\nThe Bearkats only other regional appearance came in 2007 when Sam Houston State topped Texas State 1-0 in the Southland Conference championship game at Bearkat Softball Complex.\n\nThe Bearkats were sent to the College Station Regional and fell to host Texas A&M 9-5 in the opener. Sam Houston stayed alive by beating Louisiana-Lafayette 2-1 before being eliminated by the Aggies 11-0.\n\nThe Bearkats went 22-5 in league play to capture the program's first regular-season championship since 1993 and fourth overall. Sam Houston State earned the top seed in the SLC tournament in Natchitoches, Louisiana this past week.\n\nThe Kats rolled to a 7-0 victory over Southeastern Louisiana in the opening game thanks to a stellar performance in the circle by SLC Player and Pitcher of the Year Lindsey McLeod (21-8), who struck out 11. Sophomore Bailey White drove in three runs and junior Taylar Fuselier had a two-run single.\n\nSam Houston State faced second-seeded Nicholls in two instant classics to clinch the SLC tournament championship. McLeod blanked the Colonels for nine innings May 9 before sophomore Brooke Malia launched a two-run, walk-off home run to left field off All-SLC first-team pitcher Megan Landry to advance to the championship round.\n\nNicholls survived elimination to meet the Bearkats once again Saturday.\n\nMcLeod and Landry went toe to toe in another nail-biter. The Colonels struck first with a solo home run in the top of the sixth, but junior Tiffany Thompson and Malia hit back-to-back home runs in the bottom of the inning to put Sam Houston State on top. McLeod shut the door on Nicholls in the seventh to cap the tournament with a perfect 3-0 record.\n\nThings to know for fans making the trip\n\n• Please note that a clear bag policy is in effect at all Texas Athletics venues.
