Most noteworthy to Sega/Sonic fans, this includes the first six episodes of Sonic X in its original Japanese dub. The entire campaign begins on August 5th, 2024. This is a good chance to get a taste of what Sonic X was originally like, free of both English voices and the cacophony of censorship edits imposed on it in its original English dub by 4Kids Entertainment.\n\nGotta go fast as you rush past the break for the skinny on this special event. GO! GO! GO! GO! LET’S GO!\n\nContinue Reading ➜\n\nSEGA and Nintendo’s long running Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games series has come to an end. Speaking with Eurogamer, series veteran Lee Cocker explained that the International Olympics Committee left the partnership with SEGA and Nintendo in favor of new partners that focused on NFTs and esports. Believe it or not, there IS a game based on the 2024 Summer Olympic Games out right now. You just wouldn’t know it because it isn’t really being marketed and it looks like crap. Olympics Go! from developer nWay released to smart phone stores and the Epic Games Store and it features microtransactions and officially licensed “commemorative” NFTs. Whee.\n\nContinue Reading ➜\n\nFrom the fans behind the Shenmue fan site Shenmue Dojo comes the third issue in their fan magazine Shenmue World! Hitting Kickstarter just yesterday, the campaign for Shenmue World: Issue 3 is already $17,330 pledged of a $22,496 goal. If issues 1 and 2 are any indication of the quality we can expect, then issue 3 is sure to be a feature filled book sized magazine featuring impressive fan artwork, fictional and journalistic coverage of the Shenmue series and several bonus goodies that should not be missed!\n\nContinue Reading ➜\n\nThanks to the production team of the upcoming streaming series Like a Dragon: Yakuza and Prime Video, SEGAbits was given the opportunity to interview Series Lead Ryoma Takeuchi and Co-Star Kento Kaku, and series Executive Producer Erik Barmack.\n\nIn a round table setting, joined by fellow video game fan sites, we asked the creative team about how the project began and the challenges of portraying characters like Kazuma Kiryu (played by Ryoma Takeuchi) and Akira Nishikiyama (played by Kento Kaku). You can see their answers to our questions after the break or watch our video interview above, and stay tuned to SEGAbits for more coverage of the series as we near the October 24th release date on Prime Video!\n\nContinue Reading ➜\n\nAn all new homebrew action platformer for Genesis/Mega-Drive, called Hayato’s Journey, has just finished development and is now free to download. Developed by Master Linkuei, Hayato’s Journey is a fanmade spiritual sequel to the Master System game Kenseiden (1988). The game is now available on his itch.io page for whatever price you wish to pay. Although it is free, it couldn’t hurt to give Master Linkuei a buck or two to reward their hard work.\n\nHave a look beyond the break for a trailer and a link to the game.\n\nContinue Reading ➜\n\nSega Rally 2006, the first Sega Rally game made exclusively for a console, has just gotten an all new fan translation released. Previously only released in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, this PS2 classic had all of its text in those countries’ only, until now, that is. For the first time ever, you can play the game almost entirely in English now.\n\nWhile graphics featuring text could not be translated, as there is no way to easily change the text in graphics at this time, much of the important text in the game has been completely translated into English, making menus much less of a chore to navigate for the Japanese impaired. The newly translated text consists of:\n\nCareer Mode intro and profile creation.\n\nCareer Mode top menus (Calendar, trophies, etc.).\n\nCalendar race names, vehicle restrictions, and rewards.\n\nGarage and Shop menus, including part and tire names, descriptions, and tuning menu.\n\nPre-race splash screens.\n\nSponsorship contract tutorials and objectives.\n\nFor a link to where you can download this patch, have a look past the break.\n\nContinue Reading ➜\n\nHow many of you were aware the Grand Theft Auto III (2001) was originally meant to have a version on Sega Dreamcast? It moved away from Dreamcast after developer DMA Design, today known as Rockstar North, came into agreement that the Dreamcast was no longer a viable platform for the game, most likely due to Sega bowing out of the console hardware race in 2001. Had the game released on Dreamcast as originally intended, it would’ve gone on to be a major feather in the Dreamcast’s cap for years to come.\n\nWhile we can’t go back in time and make DMA Design stick to it’s original Dreamcast release plans, one fan has taken it upon themselves to convert the game over to Dreamcast. Homebrew developer SKMP has been building a new Dreamcast GTA III port using assets and reverse engineered code from the original PC version. Lately, he’s even gained some help from a few other Dreamcast homebrew developers, including Frogbull, who’s best known for creating a Metal Gear Solid 2 tech demo for Dreamcast. While the port is still work-in-progress as of this writing, what’s been done so far is nothing short of amazing. After all, just because GTA III was originally meant to be a Dreamcast game, doesn’t mean that bringing the finished game to Dreamcast is as simple as you might think.\n\nYou’ll find out more about what I mean past the break.\n\nContinue Reading ➜\n\nToday, ATLUS announced that the next livestream showcase for their upcoming fantasy RPG Metaphor: ReFantazio will take place on July 29, 2024 at 6pm PT/9pm ET on the ATLUS West YouTube channel. The showcase titled, Metaphor: ReFantazio “ATLUS Exclusive” Showcase – Characters will reveal more details about Metaphor: ReFantazio’s dynamic cast of characters, social systems and the fight to be crowned king. The livestream will be led by Studio Zero director Katsura Hashino with English subtitles and dubbed audio.\n\nMetaphor: ReFantazio is a full-scale fantasy RPG from the creative minds of the Persona series. Players will write their destiny and rise above fear as they step into a fantasy world unlike any other. Metaphor: ReFantazio launches October 11, 2024 for Xbox Series X|S, Windows, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4 and Steam. Physical and digital pre-orders are available now.\n\nThis is for the Sega Saturn racing fans out there. Solo indie developer Walaber (Creator of the Jelly Car series and credited on Where’s My Water?) is paying tribute to the mighty Saturn with his brand new retro styled time trial racer Parking Garage Rally Circuit. This game is designed to look like an authentic Sega Saturn game from 1998 and is currently listed on Steam, where it is planned to release for Windows, Linux, and Steam Deck sometime within 2024.\n\nMore exciting than that is that Walaber wants to bring this game to Nintendo Switch and the very console he’s paying homage to, the Sega Saturn. He will bring the game to Switch if it can sell 50,000 downloads on Steam, and then make a special Saturn version of the game after achieving 100,000 downloads on Steam. If you wanna see this game in your collection for either console, then you can start by wishlisting the game on Steam right now and then buying it after it’s released. Let your money do the talking.\n\nBut if you need more convincing than that, we have extra info for you beyond the break. We bet you’ll be heading on down with this kind of ferocity.\n\nContinue Reading ➜\n\nIf you’re a fan of old school Sega and the 32X, then chances are you’ve heard of the Sega Neptune before. It was an official Genesis console with the 32-bit 32X hardware built right in, allowing for Genesis and 32X games to be run from one unit. We all know what happened with the 32X in the end, and with it, so went Sega’s plans to finalize the Neptune and bring it to market. I’m sure 32X fans would’ve preferred a Neptune over installing a 32X into a Genesis with its 2nd power cable though.\n\nThe Brazilian company Gamescare seems to agree with that notion, and thus have designed their own, all new FPGA-based clone console based on this unreleased Sega console, called the GF-1 Neptune. This Neptune will be able to run Genesis, Mega-Drive, and 32X games all in one unit, just like Sega’s Neptune was meant to do. It even has the same shape as Sega’s original Neptune prototype. It can also attach to a Sega CD unit with its expansion port on its side, like an original Genesis and, presumably, the original Neptune would’ve done.\n\nSound exciting to you? Join us past the break, then, and find out more about this promising development.\n\nContinue Reading ➜"
