A magical girl plot, the games tell the story of a Japanese schoolgirl who is fated to protect three realms by wielding a mystical sword known as Valis.[2]\n\nThe original game, Valis: The Fantasm Soldier (1986), was developed for the PC-88 and ported to several other platforms. This was followed by a series of platform games released during the 16-bit era for various home consoles, most notably the TurboGrafx-16 and Sega Mega Drive. Outside the original series, an erotic visual novel was released in 2006, followed by compilations of the original games.\n\nAfter Telenet Japan shut down in 2007, Sunsoft acquired the rights to the series.[3] These rights were passed on to Japanese media company Edia in December 2019.[4]\n\nGames\n\n[edit]\n\nAll Valis games are platform games except Valis X, an erotic visual novel released for Windows in 2006 on the 20th anniversary of the series. Developed by Eants, it was the last game published by Telenet Japan. Valis X is divided into five episodes that retell the stories of the first four games, containing copious amounts of lesbian acts and tentacle erotica.[5][6]\n\nIn June 2021, on the 35th anniversary of the Valis series, Edia announced a crowdfunding campaign to bring ports of the Valis games to the Nintendo Switch.[7][8]\n\nAfter the crowdfunding period, Edia ported several games from the Valis series to the Switch through collections. The first collection, Valis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection, was released in December 2021 in Japan and in March 2022 in Western territories.[9][10] In March 2022, Edia also announced the launch of a second collection of Valis that will feature Valis IV (PC Engine), Syd of Valis (Genesis / Mega Drive) and Valis: The Fantasm Soldier (Genesis / Mega Drive and MSX).[11] In December 2023, the third collection was launched in Japan.[12]\n\nYear Title Original platform Notes 1986 Valis: The Fantasm Soldier PC-8801 1989 Valis II PC Engine CD-ROMÂ²/TurboGrafx-CD 1990 Valis III 1991 Valis IV 1992 Super Valis IV Super Famicom/Super NES Despite a similar name, it is significantly different from Valis IV Syd of Valis (SD Valis) Sega Mega Drive/Genesis Super deformed remake of Valis II 2006 Valis X Windows Erotic visual novel\n\nCompilations\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Platform Games included 2006 Valis Complete Windows The four original games.
