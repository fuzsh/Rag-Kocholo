        "text": "This article is over 13 years old and may contain outdated information\n\nBefore she received the legendary Valis sword, Yuko was an ordinary schoolgirl. She’s even wearing her uniform while fighting a monster, but that’s besides the point. When side-scrolling action games were all the rage Telenet Japan created the Valis series.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nValis II takes place in our world, which has been overrun beasts. The game was first released on the MSX and ported with upgraded graphics to the TurboGrafx-16’s CD system.\n\nOn March 16, you’ll be able to get Valis II on PlayStation Network in the Game Archives folder. The digital re-release is PSP and PS3 compatible and it just costs 800 yen ($9.60). Far East of Eden II, another TurboDuo game, is on deck for 800 yen and Galaga ’88 is just 600 yen ($7.25) since it was a HuCard game."
