        "text": "Mugen Senshi Valis (夢幻戦士ヴァリス, Mugen Senshi Varisu), also known as Valis: The Fantasm Soldier or Valis 1, is the first game of the Valis series, introducing the main protagonist, Yuuko Asou, and the worlds where the series takes place.\n\nStory[]\n\nMain versions[]\n\nThe story tells of a normal school girl, Yuuko Asou starting yet another day at high school. When school ends though, it suddenly starts to rain, so Yuuko tries to find refuge. In doing so, she encounters a fellow student, Reiko Kirishima, who talks with her and leaves her with many unanswered questions. Soon afterward, Yuuko is attacked by a monster but a sword appears in her hands, flashing light that strikes her foe. Trying to run back home, Yuuko finds her whole city to be attacked by monsters.\n\nAfter defeating their main general, Yuuko is transported to a different world. There, the ghostly figure of Queen Valia appears in front of Yuuko, telling her that the sword named Valis summoned her to save the Dream World, Vecanti, from the claws of the evil emperor Rogles, so she can also save the human world. After being convinced by Valia, Yuuko starts to beat Rogles's generals one by one and get the phantasm jewels they carry, winning new powers.\n\nAfter beating them, Yuuko goes to Rogles's domains and arrives at his castle only to find that Reiko, who is under under Rogles's control, is guarding the entrance because of her dark emotions. Yuuko fights her and makes her regain consciousness but then Reiko agonizes. Before her death, Reiko tells Yuuko about her bad emotions and her hard life, believing that nobody cared about her, but Yuuko then says her that she truly cares for her and they become friends.\n\nShortly after, Reiko dies in her hands. Then Rogles appears and challenges Yuuko to enter his castle and fight him. Yuuko does so and kills him, enraged by the death of her friend. After this, Yuuko goes home with the presentiment that she will return to Vecanti someday.\n\nFamicom/NES version[]\n\nThe story starts originally in the trailer with Yuuko going to Vecanti and finding out why she was there, although she refused to fight in the beginning. After finding out that her friend Reiko was there serving Rogles, she finally decided to go after him and save Reiko. She returned to the real world finding the Valis sword in the middle of the chaos in the city due to Rogles's invasion\n\nShe uses it to get to a safe place where the Valis energy font tells her that Rogles kidnapped the queen of the Dream world, Valia, and that she had to save her by collecting the phantasm jewels from Rogles's generals. She found Reiko in the process and they fought, Reiko ended mortally wounded. Before dying, she helped Yuuko by giving her information about the last phantasm jewel. After Yuuko obtained the last one, she went to face Rogles in his castle.\n\nAfter she defeated the dark king, she went to free Valia, only to discover that Valia herself was behind the plot to find someone powerful enough to possess her soul, as her body was disintegrating. She tries to possess Yuuko but fails. Yuuko then goes to the Valis font. The font tells her that Valia destroyed the controller and someone powerful needed to be the new controller and tried to force Yuuko to do so. Valia then appears realizing her mistake and uses the phantasm jewels as the containers of her soul so she can become the new controller. The Dream world comes to peace once again and Yuuko returns home.\n\nGameplay[]\n\nThe basic premise of the gameplay in the game, as all the main games from the series, is that of a straightfoward 2D platform game.
