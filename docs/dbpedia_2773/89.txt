The Valis saga—the origin of bishoujo action—makes its return on Switch!

First released in the 80s and adored by fans, the Valis series is a side-scrolling bishoujo action game series that will celebrate its 35th anniversary in December 2021.

In commemoration of this, the highly popular PC Engine versions of Valis: The Fantasm Soldier, Valis II, and Valis III have been ported to Switch as part of Valis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection.

The game also includes a Gallery Mode that lets you enjoy the gems of Valis sounds and beautiful visual scenes.

Other features include the ability to save / load anywhere, a “rewind” function to go back and try again if you make a mistake, and more.
