Sam Kinison was an American stand-up comedian and actor. A former Pentecostal preacher, he performed stand-up routines that were characterized by an intense sudden tirade, punctuated with his distinctive leaning forward scream, similar to charismatic preachers. Initially performing for free, Kinison became a regular fixture at the Comedy Store where he met and eventually befriended such comics as Robin Williams and Jim Carrey. Kinison’s comedy was crass observational humor, especially towards women and dating, and his popularity grew quickly, earning him appearances on Late Night with David Letterman and Saturday Night Live.

Kinison was one of the most popular comedians of the 1980’s. His trademark voice as well as screams put him on the map as he sold out shows all over the world. Kinison’s life was tragically cut short when he was struck by a drunk driver on his way to a sold out show in Nevada in 1992. Dying at the age of 38 make Kinison’s signatures very scarce.
