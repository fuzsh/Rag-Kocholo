        "text": "The Poconos have seen some pretty good comics come here in the past thanks to the Caesar's properties, and Jim Norton will add his name to that list this weekend.\n\nIt got me thinking about my favorite comedians — now and all-time — the ones that I'd pay money to see.\n\nIt's too hard to rank, so here is my list of my favorite stand-ups that I've seen on TV or in person or heard on CD or radio.\n\nAnd no, you won't see Dane Cook on this list now or ever:\n\nChris Rock\n\nI've broken about 20 different bones jumping on and off the Chris Rock. On: Pre-\"SNL,\" he released a hysterical comedy CDs, Born Suspect. Then he starts one of the most underrated SNL characters of all time, Nat X. Off: He leaves SNL in a huff, briefly joins the cast of post-Jim Carrey \"In Living Color\" and couldn't even be found on a milk crate. On: He makes the riotous \"Bring the Pain\" in 1996, becomes the best host of MTV Video Awards history and delivers some of the funniest five minutes of cameo screen time ever in \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.\" No matter what he does from now on — and it's still amazing — he's one of the best comedians ever.\n\nRick\n\nDuchoman\n\nLong forgotten by now, Duchoman's 1989 HBO special \"Piece of Mind\" remains one of the funniest things I've ever seen on TV. He later had small parts in \"Groundhog Day\" and \"Die Hard,\" starred opposite Tom Hanks in \"The 'Burbs,\" but never achieved the stardom I could have swore he was destined for.\n\nMitch Hedberg\n\nHere's a problem. Valentine's Day 2005, I saw Hedberg and the hysterical musical comic Stephen Lynch at the Scranton Cultural Center. It was my wife's Christmas present, we're both huge Hedberg fans. Lynch was great, but then Hedberg stumbles through his act — literally and figuratively — so obviously drunk or high he couldn't even remember his own material. Two months later, he died of a drug overdose. My wife and I both swore of Hedberg for screwing us out what should have been a great night. Trouble is, he's too darn funny to boycott. His stuff remains some of the most original you'll find of the last 10 years.\n\nSteven Wright\n\nBut without Wright, there is no Mitch Hedberg. The thinking man's comic, Wright was cracking one-liners like we've never heard before that had to even make Henny Youngman and Rodney Dangerfield wish they had worked that hard on their act.\n\nJerry Seinfeld\n\nPerhaps we should curse Seinfeld instead of honoring him. He ushered in a wave of \"observational comedy\" clones, none of which were nearly as funny or dead-on as he was. You can even put Jim Carrey in that hideous group if you wanted to. Bottom line, his stand-up comedy was ground breaking, and he can bang out an hour of stage time without breaking a sweat.\n\nDave Chappelle\n\nCrazy? Maybe. Unbelievably funny? Definitely. Even before he reached another stratosphere with \"Chappelle's Show\" on Comedy Central — rightfully so — he was working some of the funniest concerts you'll ever see. Not to mention the longest — he just broke his own record, now six hours and 12 minutes at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. The best part? He only did it because he heard Dane Cook was gunning for the record. Awesome.\n\nDave Attell\n\nEven though he looks like he's about 60 at this point — who knew drinking and staying out all night ages you? — Attell still comes up with some of the funniest-yet-repulsive jokes out there, surprising you with almost light-hearted brashness. Call him the charming raunchmaster.\n\nMitch Fatal\n\nA somewhat new face on the scene, Fatal is like nothing you've ever seen or heard before. A former intern on The Howard Stern show, Fatel's dull, monotone delivery and extraneous material lulls you to sleep before he wakes you up with how much he likes girls underpants.\n\nDenis Leary\n\nThe perfect anti-PC comedian at the perfect PC time, Leary exploded thanks to the height of MTV's popularity and his commercial rants against things like bottled water and Richard Gere. But beyond those 30-second freak-outs, Leary was putting together some of the funniest concerts you can find.\n\nSam Kinison\n\nYeah, it was shtick. Yeah, it was offensive, misogynistic and just downright crude. But in a new age of women's rights, he spoke for every man in the country — whether we would admit it to our girlfriends, mothers and sisters or not.\n\nEddie Murphy\n\nSomewhere along the line, Murphy completely lost his sense of humor, and no one seems to know where it went. But when he had it, there wasn't anything like him. The second coming of Richard Pryor, Murphy destroyed comedy as it was known then with the back-to-back classic stand-up movies \"Delirious\" and \"Raw.\" He's basically off the stand-up scene now, which is a shame, because it would be truly a gift to see Murphy, a stool and a microphone for just one more show. Minus the leather though.\n\nMichael Sadowski is the editor of Sharp who has seen way too much stand-up. E-mail him at msadowski@sharpmag.com."
