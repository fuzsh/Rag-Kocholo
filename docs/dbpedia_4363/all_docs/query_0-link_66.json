        "text": "Having a career path both in and out of the corporate world, a unique skill set and diverse experiences, Wyatt works fluidly in both clean and blue comedy, with jokes about past failed relationships, observational humor, political and topical humor. He has self-labeled his comedy as \"nonsensical surrealism.\"\n\nHis comedy influences--George Carlin, Sam Kinison, Bill Hicks, and Greg Giraldo, are all deceased.\n\n​\n\nWith a tight 30 minutes of material, his comedy can be both unhinged and edgy and/or clean and raunchy. He can tailor his set to a client's requests within reason, and is available for private events, parties, weddings etc. He has appeared as a background actor on SNL and 30 Rock.\n\nUnder his pen name, he has written satirical articles for The Spoof.com.\n\n​"
