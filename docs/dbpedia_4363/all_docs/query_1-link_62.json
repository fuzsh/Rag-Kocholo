        "text": "VOICE OVER: Rebecca Brayton WRITTEN BY: George Pacheco\n\nThese stand up comedy specials never fail to make viewers laugh. For this list, we'll be ranking the funniest and most enduring examples of the stand-up comedy show as art. Our countdown of the best stand up comedy specials of all time includes “Robin Williams: Live on Broadway” (2002), “Eddie Murphy: Delirious” (1983), “Bo Burnham: what.” (2013), “Maria Bamford: The Special Special Special!” (2012), and more!\n\nWelcome to WatchMojo, and today we’re counting down our picks for the Top 20 Stand Up Comedy Specials of All Time. For this list, we’ll be ranking the funniest and most enduring examples of the stand-up comedy show as art. What’s your favorite stand-up comedy special? Let us know in the comments!\n\n#20: “John Mulaney: New in Town” (2012)\n\nIf John Mulaney’s 2023 stand-up tour was all about celebrating his newfound sobriety, then “New in Town” from 2012 showcased a comedian with something to prove. This was Mulaney’s second stand-up special for Comedy Central, and debuted just as the funny man’s career as an “SNL” writer was winding down. “New in Town” even features bits where Mulaney references his work as a writer, and it’s fun to see him work both sides of the camera. His ease on the microphone and with the audience is readily apparent, and it’s clear that Mulaney is in for some truly great things on the horizon. He may have been “New in Town,” but John Mulaney already felt like an old pro.\n\n#19: “Ali Wong: Baby Cobra” (2016)\n\nIt was perhaps a very easy joke for Ali Wong to make: the fact that she was very pregnant while filming her Netflix special, “Baby Cobra.” Don’t think for a second that this special is cliché or boring, however, as Wong proved her wit was razor sharp, her joke arsenal primed and ready. The audience definitely feels game to go along for the ride with Wong, as well, and “Baby Cobra” is made all the better for this fact. Wong’s delivery is quick and fearless, and the bits here feel fresh and full of life. “Baby Cobra” has definitely stood the test of time.\n\n#18: “Bo Burnham: what.” (2013)\n\nMany stand-up comedians appear confident and invincible while on stage. Or, at least it sometimes appears that way on the outside. Bo Burnham’s “what.” special from 2013 was a huge success for the comedian, but it reportedly caused Burnham bouts of anxiety and panic. The show never suffers a result of this, of course, and Burnham’s unique style of musical and prop comedy feels honed and well-rehearsed. There’s a certain, surreal quality to “what.,” a self-referential quality that feels deeper than your average observational stand-up. This is something special that may not appeal to everyone, but is just the perfect palate cleanser when your diet of samey stand-up needs one left-of-center refresh.\n\n#17: “Patrice O’Neal: Elephant in the Room” (2011)\n\nPatrice O’Neal is a much-missed figure of comedy and one that would probably still be making us laugh were it not for his tragic death back in 2011. “Elephant in the Room” serves as a fitting coda to a comic who could consistently be relied upon to deliver the yucks. There’s a lot of relationship and observational humor here, delivered in O’Neal’s warm and conversational style. The vibe is as if you’re enjoying a meal or a drink with the comedian, engaging in a spirited back-and-forth full of laughter and good times. Patrice O’Neal may be gone, but his humor will never be forgotten.\n\n#16: “Louis C.K.: Shameless” (2007)\n\nOkay, we’ll address the elephant in the room: in 2017, Louis C.K. confirmed multiple reports of misconduct, tarnishing his reputation as one of the great comedians of his generation. However, taken on its own merits, his 2007 stand-up special “Shameless” still resonates as a prime example of his power as a comedic auteur. Many comics have reflected upon the minutiae of everyday life, but none have done so with quite the same skill. C.K. is a master of redirection, starting down such normal paths as marriage and parenthood, but ending up with punchlines that are revealing and dark, yet simultaneously side-splitting. It’s a wonder to behold, and essential viewing for anyone interested in the art and pathos of comedy.\n\n#15: “Sarah Silverman: Jesus is Magic” (2005)\n\nThere is a lot of “shock humor” that goes into Sarah Silverman’s “Jesus is Magic” from 2005. The comedian takes no prisoners when it comes unleashing salvos of blatantly offensive material that takes swipes at just about everything and everyone. Racism, sexism, politics and more are fair game for Silverman during “Jesus is Magic,” and the show is an equal opportunity offender. Silverman’s charisma is palpable through it all, however, and she delivers some biting material with the sort of smile that just knows it’s up to no good. Buckle up, buttercup: it’s gonna be a wild ride.\n\n#14: “A Steven Wright Special” (1985)\n\nIf there were a Mount Olympus for low-key, low-energy comedians, then Steven Wright would definitely be wearing a toga and crowned with some serious laurels. That’s because Wright has been serving as a voice for progressive and idiosyncratic comedy for years. “A Steven Wright Special” served as an early example of the man’s vision and voice, a show that makes up in genius bits for what it lacks in traditionally “cohesive” flow. Wright’s non-sequiturs are hilarious, his observations at once confusing, smart, and even maddeningly silly. “A Steven Wright Special” feels like comedy for comedians: a show that pushes boundaries and rewards those who dare to walk on the mild side.\n\n#13: “Maria Bamford: The Special Special Special!” (2012)\n\nMaria Bamford is another comedian that has turned to her own personal struggles to serve as a source for inspiration. “The Special Special Special!” wasn’t Bamford’s first rodeo, as she’d already amassed a loyal fanbase by the time it aired in 2012. That said, the show still manages to feel, well, special, doing exactly what it says on the tin. This is achieved via the setup, because Bamford’s audience consists solely of her parents. As a result, “The Special Special Special!” feels confessional, personal and even somewhat uncomfortable. Still, the end effects are simply impossible to ignore, and “The Special Special Special!” remains compelling, right to its closing moments.\n\n#12: “I’m Sorry You Feel That Way” (2014)\n\nThere are very few certainties in life. There’s death. There’s taxes. And there’s the comedy of Bill Burr, comedy that never seems to take a night off. The black-and-white photography of “I’m Sorry You Feel That Way” gives the show a certain level of intimacy, while Burr’s wit and brazen demeanor are set on full display. “I’m Sorry You Feel That Way” feels like classic, old-school stand-up that’s been adapted to the modern day. There's a bit of generation gap humor here, some sacred cow slaughter there, and Bill Burr goes through it all with ease.\n\n#11: “Zach Galifianakis Live at the Purple Onion” (2005)\n\nOne of the great things about stand-up comedy specials is their ability to serve as time capsules for a comedian’s career. “Zach Galifianakis Live at the Purple Onion” is one of those specials, a debut for a future comedy star that showcases all of the bits we would come to love about Galifianakis and his quirky style of comedy. Meta humor? Check? Musical accompaniment? Double check. Of course, all of this wouldn’t really matter if Galifianakis wasn’t funny, right? Thankfully, “Live at the Purple Onion” still manages to make us crack up, even though we can all remember when we heard these bits for the very first time.\n\n#10: “A Wild and Crazy Guy” (1978)\n\nCan we reminisce, for a minute, the art form that WAS the comedy album? Today’s streaming world benefits from an embarrassment of riches when it comes to Netflix specials. However, those of a certain age will likely recall the first time they heard spun LPs from the Firesign Theatre or National Lampoon. Steve Martin’s “A Wild and Crazy Guy” was definitely cut from that same cloth, and the album experience was brought to television screens back in 1978. The special mixed in concert clips of Martin’s act with comedy sketches, all of which helped promote his generational talent to the masses. So, get those bunny ears ready, turn on that tube TV and take in some cathode ray sunshine with this “Wild and Crazy Guy.”\n\n#9: “Bill Hicks: Relentless” (1992)\n\nBill Hicks’s abrasive, no-filter style has been often imitated, but never duplicated. The Georgia native was a comedian’s comedian, one whose satirical and transgressive approach served as a huge influence for future stars like Denis Leary. While a CD with the same name captured his last show before his 1994 death, the “Relentless” show released for home video was filmed at a different time, during Montreal’s Just for Laughs festival. And it showcased the comic at the peak of his powers: smart, sharp and confident. Hicks never shied away from being brash and satirical with his work, caring less about laughs and more about challenging audiences every step of the way, and “Relentless” perfectly documents that.\n\n#8: “Comedy Central Presents: Mitch Hedberg” (1999)\n\nMitch Hedberg had a unique perspective on comedy, and a delivery that had fans dying of laughter in the aisles… or scratching their heads in confusion. “Comedy Central Presents: Mitch Hedberg” may have started out as simply another half hour of comedy from the channel’s long-running series, but it ended up as an early showcase for one of stand-up’s most promising stars. The special was simple and to the point: broadcasting Hedberg’s shy, stoner stage presence with a barrage of wordplay one-liners that were instantly quotable. Hedberg’s 2005 death may have robbed the comedy world of his great potential, but at least we have these laughs to remember him by.\n\n#7: “Sam Kinison: Breaking the Rules” (1987)\n\n“Breaking the Rules” was released right at the cusp of Sam Kinison’s major mainstream success as the louder-than-hell voice of heavy metal comedy. The 1987 HBO special brought together all of the comedian’s fantastic early material with a delivery which, by this point, was honed to perfection. “Breaking the Rules” touched upon such taboo subjects as religion, while at the same time making the most of Kinison’s early life as a Pentecostal preacher. Sam was all fire, brimstone and hilarious anger, possessing an almost effortless connection with his audience that, even today, is absolutely remarkable.\n\n#6: “Chris Rock: Bring the Pain” (1996)\n\nHe may be a household name in comedy today, but it was a slightly different story when Rock shot his second HBO special, “Bring the Pain.” The performance solidified the inimitable Rock delivery we know and love, and also shot the comedian into the public eye, completely rebounding his career. Rock didn’t shy away from anything in “Bring the Pain,” commenting on touchy subjects like race with a voice that was both humorous and furious. Rock would double down only two years later with “Bigger and Blacker,” a performance that only echoed the comic’s status as one of the premier stand-up voices of his generation.\n\n#5: “Robin Williams: Live on Broadway” (2002)\n\n​​Robin Williams had nothing to prove when he released his fourth HBO special. The actor and comedian was already a certified star at this point, and long removed from his “Mork and Mindy” days. As such, “Live on Broadway” showcases a supremely confident Williams on stage in front of a ready and willing New York crowd. Robin touches upon then-topical subjects like Michael Jackson and Anne Heche, but it’s Williams’s observational humor and natural delivery that are the real gold. “Live on Broadway” is all manic and relentless energy; a portrait of a comedic artist that makes his absence all the more poignant today.\n\n#4: “Richard Pryor: Live in Concert” (1979)\n\nChoosing the best of Richard Pryor’s work is a difficult task, but “Live in Concert” ranks up there not only in Pryor’s enviable career, but also among the finest stand-up performances of all time by anyone. Pryor’s influence as a comedian cannot be understated, and “Live in Concert” showcases him at the height of his prowess as a cultural commentator and storyteller. Sure, it’s profane as hell and not the least bit politically correct, but it’s also a hilarious and vital moment of the man’s career, and is an essential part of any proper comedy education.\n\n#3: “On Location: George Carlin at USC” (1977)\n\nGeorge Carlin was a true wordsmith; a man whose usage of the English language was honed to a razor’s edge and a hunter’s accuracy. “Live at USC” was Carlin’s first HBO special, and as such, he was basically exploring what could be considered new territory in 1977. In fact, network execs were so worried about Carlin’s famous “Seven Dirty Words” bit, that they actually froze the feed and included a message informing audiences about the language used before continuing with the special. It may seem quaint today, but this is just a small example of how much impact Carlin had as one of comedy’s finest voices.\n\n#2: “Dave Chappelle: Killin’ them Softly” (2000)\n\nDave Chappelle is another comedian whose public image hasn’t held up. But it’s similarly hard to overlook his place in stand-up history. Before “Chappelle’s Show” turned him into a household name, Dave Chappelle was slaying audiences with this inaugural HBO special, “Killin’ Them Softly.” Comedy ages and some specials don’t hold up, but “Killin’ Them Softly” is just as funny today as it was back in 2000; a real and honest collection of material from one of modern comedy’s defining voices. The voices of Richard Pryor and Redd Foxx echo loudly in Chappelle’s work, while his delivery is smooth and conversational. “Killin’ Them Softly” is low key and unassuming, but, like all great comedy, it’s also personal, real and honest.\n\n#1: “Eddie Murphy: Delirious” (1983)\n\nIs there any stand-up special as popular or influential as Eddie Murphy’s “Delirious?” This 1983 performance turned Murphy into a legitimate comedy badass; a rock star decked out in iconic red leather. Murphy already made serious waves during his tenure on “Saturday Night Live,” but “Delirious” was when the stars aligned just right, and he truly broke out into the mainstream. Although the A.I.D.S. and homosexuality material hasn’t exactly aged well, “Delirious” on the whole is something combustible and cosmic; a perfect storm of look, talent and delivery that has rarely been equaled by any comic past or present. Goonie goo goo, to you sir."
