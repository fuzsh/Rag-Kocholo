        "text": ".Robert Ferraro: Gary, if I said that I knew a person who went to Boston College on a football scholarship and made Dean’s list every semester, and then I said I also knew a person who was a substitute teacher and lived with their parents until their late 20’s, someone might ask me\n\nwho those two people are. But both of those people are Gary Gulman.\n\nGary Gulman: [laughs] I know! I contain multitudes!\n\nRobert: When you went to B.C. did you have a specific plan, or did you attend college simply because you thought it was a good thing to do?\n\nGary: A little bit of both. I was influenced by my family’s practicality and the fact that we grew up pretty poor. Having security and a good job were definitely in my head, and my brother was a successful accountant, so I gravitated to the business school. It was well respected and the graduates would get jobs.\n\nRobert: You were headed for a white collar life.\n\nGary: Definitely. I got an accounting degree and knew I was going to be a C.P.A. like my brother, but I suppose subconsciously, and sometimes consciously, I believed that I would become a comedian to save myself from that torture. Early on in my freshman year I started thinking about becoming a standup because I was usually the funniest person in our group, or at least the wittiest. I thought I had a knack for it, and felt that there was a naturalness to it for me. But in my sophomore year I had my first girlfriend, and when I told her I wanted to be a comedian she scoffed and told me it was unrealistic. So I sort of put that dream to bed until my senior year, when I resurrected it, except this time with a college degree.\n\nRobert: Did you ever work in the accounting field?\n\nGary: I worked for what is now Price Waterhouse Coopers (one of the world’s most prestigious auditors) for about a year and a half, while doing open mics and low paid shows at night. I was unmotivated and inept at accounting. I was very weak.\n\nRobert: Because you had no passion for accounting?\n\nGary: No passion, no concentration, no anything. Part of the job of an auditor is to go to businesses and ask for paperwork, and then go over that paperwork with people who already had jobs that didn’t involve me. I was asking them to do extra work, which I felt was provoking anxiety in them, and I was not an assertive person in that way. I was consciously anxious about approaching these people. I enjoyed them, and I enjoyed making my co-workers laugh, but I hated the actual work."
