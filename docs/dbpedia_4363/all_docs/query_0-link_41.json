        "text": "March 10, 2018 · Doors open at 7:00 pm\n\nJimmy Shubert\n\nA Philly native, growing up as the son of a Philadelphia Detective wasn’t easy for Jimmy. He says“ It was like having Lieutenant Colombo as a roommate, most of my childhood was an interrogation scene from Law & Order ” Jimmy and his band of six brothers were always getting into trouble, and being the middle child, Jimmy learned at an early age that a sense of humor could get him through any situation. He attended the Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts. It was from those experiences in acting class that Jimmy knew he wanted to be an Comedian. Always the class clown, Jimmy performed magic tricks for his friends and family at 10 years of age. By the age of 15, he had become an accomplished professional magician. He later channeled that energy into stand-up comedy.His unique ability to see the humor in social trends and deliver his poignant and hilarious point of view on world issues has made Shubert one of the most respected and original comedians working today.\n\nJimmy started performing right out of high school in comedy clubs around the Philly area. He later moved to Los Angeles and started working at the Comedy Store. It was at the Comedy Store where he later met Sam Kinison, and after taking him offstage on a Motorcycle at the Comedy Store’s Main room in front of a packed house , they became fast friends . Kinison liked Shubert’s cockeyed chutzpah and included him as one of the original “Outlaws of Comedy” which he toured with for five years, playing major casinos in Las Vegas and other venues like the Universal Amphitheater in front of audiences as large as 6,500 people. In 1997, after a well recognized performance at the prestigious Just For Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal , he was spotted by the late Brandon Tartikoff , who signed Jimmy to a holding deal to develop a pilot sitcom for him to star in at 20th Century Fox, which led to another holding deal and then finally a Pilot.\n\nJimmy’s comedy routine is usually performed with an observational point of view, in comedic short-story form, and typically focuses on poking fun at pop culture. As AllMusic.com put it, “His confidence and lucid delivery enhances his humor, making even his most perverse moments hilarious.”\n\nJason Lawhead\n\nJason Lawhead is as relatable a comic as you’ll see working live on stage today. Observational everyday takes, with personal family experiences & an array of sports material along with a knack for impressions, voices & story telling make the Cleveland born comedian funny from start to finish. Lawhead made a name for himself as a regular opening act for Bill Burr on both his \"Billy Red State\" & \"Billy Bible Belt” tours in 2014 & 2015, as well as opening for Bill’s Netflix special “You People Are All the Same”. A favorite guest of the Artie Lange show, Jason has also appeared twice on Gotham Comedy Live & was on Season 9 of Last Comic Standing. Jason currently tours all over the country & can be seen regularly in Los Angeles at the Comedy & Magic Club in Hermosa Beach."
