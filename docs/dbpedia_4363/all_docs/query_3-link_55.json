        "text": "Read\n\nJanuary 7, 2017\n\nSam Kinison is a name that has always lingered in my mind since my days growing up in the church. My grandfather was an Apostolic Pastor and I often heard brothers from the church talking about this Sam Kinison fella, a former Pentecostal preacher turned comedian that took God’s name in vain and spoke vile things about the church. In each conversation I overheard, there was the constant threat that with such blasphemy God would seek vengeance. When Kinison died in a freak car accident in 1992, at the height of his career, people from our church agreed that God’s wrath had finally caught up to him.\n\nA few years ago while at the last standing records store in Fresno; I came across a compilation of Sam’s stand-up acts and purchased it. I could not stop laughing, funny man indeed, his God/church jokes are cringe worthy, especially if you grew up in a strict religious household. Then, on the Joe Rogan podcast I heard Sam’s brother Bill had wrote a book about him. I searched everywhere and found the book was out of print. Finally after nearly a year, I purchased the out of print, first edition, hard cover book of Brother Sam. I read it in a day. Now on to the review….\n\nSam Kinison was born in Yakima, Washington, the son of a fire and brimstone Pentecostal Preacher named, Samuel Earl Kinison. Preacher Kinison was a controversial man; he believed in things like the Holy Spirit and its gifts, such as the speaking in tongues, the interpretation of speaking in tongues, and faith healings. His controversial ways drew in crowds and also brought in the attention of the leaders of the Church of God. Bill Kinison, the older brother of Sam, writes of a violent scene where from the pulpit, Preacher Kinison was removed. The next morning, as Bill sat looking out their home window, a group of men dressed in black came and picked up Preacher Sam and took him away. When he returned he told his young wife and their 4 children that he had been banned from the church and ordered to leave. Needless, to say all four children of Marie & Sam suffered from insecurities as children. They lived in an old church house. They were poor, and often times ridiculed for their lifestyle.\n\nRegardless of their situation, the church played a huge role in the lives of the Kinison boys. Richard and Bill would soon follow in their father’s footsteps and become evangelists; Sam Kinison would also soon follow suit. Up to this point Sam Kinison had a rather typical religious upbringing but then something happened that changes the course of his life completely and may very well be responsible for his unpredictable behavior as an adult. At age three, Sam is hit by a car and suffers 30% brain damage. Bill writes that once Sam is brought home from the hospital he looked like his same brother. Although, his outward appearance was the same, internally he was not.\n\nBefore the accident Sam was a rather quiet child, passive and calm. Bill describes that Sam after the accident is aggressive and unruly and not calm or in control of his emotions. As Sam grows he is now prone to mood swings, temper-tantrums, drooling, and seizures and begins to pack on the weight. Sam also starts wetting his bed and continues to do so until his early teens. His mother has to cuddle him and hold him through his attacks.\n\nAs Sam grew, he becomes defiant and is very unhappy. Sam’s parents’ divorce and Sam and his younger brother Kevin are sent to live with their mother. His mother cannot control Sam and he runs away from home early on, he starts to experiment with drugs and alcohol. He also teaches himself to play the guitar. Throughout, his rather rebellious teenager years, Richard and Bill become evangelists and soon Sam heeds his calling to the ministry. Despite, his defiant behavior the church remains a strong foundation for his family. Eventually Sam attends bible schools and soon becomes an evangelist. Sam travels with his brothers and begins preaching around the country. His stint of comedic acts initially comes out during this time. Although, his humor is light and churchy, it would soon take a raunchy turn.\n\nSam decides to leave the church after his first wife cheats on him which makes his insecurities even worse. Once Sam begins his stand-up act it is not long before he is a hit, and a controversial one at that. Using church and God as a cornerstone of his jokes, Sam soon grows a cult following. By the time he makes it to Hollywood, he is already well known. Despite Sam’s outrageous lifestyle the relationship with his brothers is a tightly knit bond. Bill eventually becomes his manager and his younger brother Kevin moves in with Sam. Sam just makes bad choice, after bad choice. He sleeps and maintains sexual relationships with porn stars and strippers, is often broke. He drug binges and alcohol binges for days. He squanders all his money.\n\nSam Kinison was a funny man, to that there is no doubt but one could never say he was a decent man. When I found out his brother wrote the book, I definitely thought that Bill would sugarcoat the truth and write in a fashion to make his brother Sam seem like a great moral man that left a legacy of honor. That is not the case at all. Bill Kinison writes the book in complete truth. He gives the readers the real Sam Kinison and that is really what makes the book such a great read. It is littered with beautiful passages that show the Kinison family as an upstanding Christian family that weathered storms but never swayed from their faith. And then, like a punch in the gut it shows Sam Kinison, as a diabolical comedian that loves all things in excess and that has these horrible relationships with women.\n\nIt shoves in your face the real Sam, the drug addict, the lack of responsibility, the vile language and lack of respect Sam, the party rock star lifestyle, the Sam that carries on a sexual affair with his fiancé Malika’s sister and the Sam that is quietly still as insecure as in his childhood. Sam never gets it together.\n\nBill takes the reader down every avenue of Hollywood life through Sam’s eyes, all the disappointment, all the Hollywood elite favoritism and shadiness, all the fun. I recall once listening to a Howard Stern show where he praised Kinison and had said that Kinison had just married his beautiful bride Malika and spoke of this marriage between Sam and hanger-on Malika as a love story.\n\nAfter reading the book, that was not the case at all. There was no love between the two, there was no happily married man or woman, everything in Sam’s life seemed artificial, his first wife, his second and now his third all used him. Other than the unconditional love that Sam received from his mother, father and brothers, he was not endeared by any one woman in his lifetime. Sam endures heartache not only in his romantic life but also when his young brother Kevin commits suicide; Sam blames himself for this and never fully recovers.\n\nThere is a real fun edge to the book. To hear of all these 80’s stars and their wild antics was interesting to read of Motley Crew, Billy Idol and more made the book so intriguing. Sam truly lived like a rock star, and he was for a brief period of time. He made a hit record and song with remake “Wild Thing”.\n\nAt the end, according to Bill, Sam was hoping for a mainstream life and wanted to gear his career in a more acceptable way. Sam had quit using drugs and alcohol as he prepared for the next chapter to his life. However, Sam never got that chance to see what could have been. Days after his marriage to Malika, Sam was involved in a head-on collision and died at the scene. But he didn’t just die, his injuries were that of a broken neck, a fractured skull, a lacerated heart and a lacerated small bowel.\n\nYet, with suffering all those injuries Sam managed to get out of the car with help from his brother Bill and speak to someone or something that seemed to be above him and whatever this unknown being was, an angel or hallucination, no one could see it but Sam Kinision.\n\nIn the first moments after impact Kinison seemed as if he was going to make it, but within minutes he appeared to know he was about to die.\n\nWitnesses stated that Kinison appeared to be holding a conversation in which he stated, \"I don't want to die. I don't want to die.\"As the conversation continued Sam said, \"But why?”Sam said again, “Why Now?”\n\nAnd finally, Kinison stated, \"Okay, Okay, Okay\".The last \"Okay\" was stated in a very gentle and loving manner, as if he were talking with someone he knew, and loved.Sam Kinision died at 38 years old.\n\nI really enjoyed this book. We will never know who Sam was speaking with in his final moments of life, nor would the accusations I heard as a child, as to his death being a result of God's wrath. This book was just what it said it would be, a short, spectacular tale of the life of Sam Kinison the rest is for you to figure out.\n\nBrother Sam has scattered throughout some of Sam’s most brilliant jokes and stories. I must have looked like a crazy person, because at times I was laughing out loud while in the break room at work reading this book. Bill wrote a beautiful tribute and honest till the very end in Sam’s memory. I am glad I was able to finally obtain a copy and read it. For an interesting read, I suggest you start looking for it now, as the book is out of print, but worth the search.\n\nWritten & Reviewed by Anthem Book Review\n\nNovember 9, 2017\n\nI will never forget the first time I saw Kinison on HBO. It was late and I was probably 11 or 12 at the time, and it was about midnight which meant whatever I watched, I had to be quiet. Then I saw Sam, and I could not stop laughing. At the end of his set my stomach hurt, I had tears pouring out of my eyes, but I knew I saw something ground breaking. Sam was the voice of the people. He said what most guys thought, and even wished they had the balls to say. When he passed it stunned me, and I remember listening to Have You Seen Me Lately and tried to imagine a world without Sam. I heard about the book many years later, but it took me a while to track it down. Hell, I don't even think it's in print anymore. I own the hardback and when I did a search for it, that's all I could find.\n\nSo, reading the book there was a lot that stood out. Sam was truly a genius, and he was out of control which really didn't surprise me. This was a guy who connected with his audience, but I didn't realize how long it had taken him to achieve success, and I didn't realize just how many demons Sam had. I think the one thing I learned from the book was that Sam just wasn't emotionally mature enough to handle success, and it shows in all of the choices he made. This was a guy who lived fast, and partied hard. The way he died was truly tragic, and came at a time when he was finally cleaning himself up, and trying desperately to change his image. Reading the book there's the usual amount of heartbreak and sadness, but Bill Kinison rarely strays from the bad Sam. The guy that was out of control, the guy that couldn't keep his shit together very long.\n\nWhat I didn't know was that Sam had a two year affair with his girlfriend's sister, or he didn't even want to marry Malika at all, and felt pressured into it. Bill Kinison doesn't hold back on his dislike of Malika at all and after this book came out, she promptly sued him. Sabrina was really the only woman he really loved, and it seemed that of all the women he was with, she was the one that maybe could have pulled him from the brink of disaster. Also here is the brief affair with Jessica Hahn. Not much is here of course, and what we learn is that Sam actually fell asleep while still inside her. What didn't surprise me was the drinking, and the overall insanity of what it was like to be Sam Kinison. Warts and all is the correct way to describe this bio, but while it's not perfect it's an okay book that seems to quiet down the need for a book about Kinison's life. Hopefully a better one will come along that fills in the gaps that this one left behind."
