        "text": "Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Can you tell us a story about what brought you to this specific career path?\n\nI always loved Stand-up comedy and sitcoms. I saw the late Sam Kinison perform in a student union at Cal State Northridge right before he blew up. I was blown away and thought that would be fun. However, family and life circumstances came along and distracted me from that idea.\n\nI ended up working at the California Department of Motor Vehicles as a Driving Examiner. Probably the farthest thing from being a Comedian. My friend and I left DMV and opened a driving school. He talked me into doing the same thing in my area. I ended up also teaching traffic violator classes. People thought I was funny and this inspired me to start a comedy traffic school. I decided to recruit some comedians as instructors.\n\nMy then wife and I attended a comedy show at a local Lions Club. The comedian performing that night was Donald Lacy from Oakland. Turns out this was his first comedy show since his daughter has been murdered a month earlier. He did an amazing job and the audience, been more supportive. I thought if this man I had that strength and courage to get back on stage, I needed to summon some courage and try stand-up.\n\nI ended up taking a class at Laughs Unlimited Comedy Club in Sacramento. The teachers Del and Karen not only taught the class but hosted an open mi afterwards. I got onstage that night and knew I would continue doing comedy for years to come.\n\nCan you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?\n\nMaybe not the most interesting but the most unusual story was I was asked to do comedy on an Alaskan Airlines flight to Fairbanks. Surreal experience that I think may 20 percent of the passengers enjoyed.\n\nCan you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?\n\nI walked in to the legendary Punchline Comedy Club in San Francisco and completely clueless to their process, I asked if I could get a spot on their Sunday night showcase. Turns out that was a firm ‘No’ as comedians had to show up every Sunday for 3 to 6 months before being offered a spot. The lesson from that story was do you research before just jumping in to something you know little about.\n\nOk, thank you for all that. Let’s now jump to the main focus of our discussion. Can you describe how you are helping to make popular culture more representative of the US population?\n\nI think I try to humanize the struggles and similarities of people from all backgrounds. I talk lot about my life and the cultural differences just within my extended family. My children are half-Jewish; I’m part Native; my oldest married into an Arab family. I think it reflects and highlights how we are evolving and blending together in mostly positive but sometimes awkward ways. I’ve always thought my job was to entertain and bring audiences together rather than highlight our differences.\n\nCan you tell us a story about a particular individual who was impacted by the work you are doing?\n\nNo one person stands out but I’ve had a number of encounters with audience members where they shared with me that they had just lost a loved one or gone thru some traumatic life event, and how my comedy had uplifted them. Those moments are some of the best as comedy can seem banal and self-serving at times.\n\nAs an insider, this might be obvious to you, but I think it’s instructive to articulate this for the public who might not have the same inside knowledge. Can you share three reasons with our readers about why it’s really important to have diversity represented in Entertainment and its potential effects on our culture?\n\nThree reasons I think it’s important to have diversity represented in entertainment; one, is to expand our appreciation and understanding of other cultures; two, to diminish the the misconceptions and stereotypes of other cultures; three, to highlight our commonalities as humans despite our cultural differences.\n\nCan you recommend three things the community/society/the industry can do to help address the root of the diversity issues in the entertainment business?\n\nContinue to seek out talents and voices from underrepresented groups\n\nFoster a culture of curiosity and knowledge seeking to hear the stories that don’t always reach the mainstream\n\nFund and support arts program in underprivileged and economically disadvantaged communities of color as well as economically disadvantaged white communities that have been marginalized.\n\nWhat are your “5 things I wish someone told me when I first started” and why?\n\nThere are no overnight sensations. I’m an example of that. I’m in year 25 of my career and I’m still trying to grow my influence in the comedy world to get the recognition I would like.\n\nYour connections are probably as important as your talent. I wouldn’t have been apart of my first Showtime special had a friend I made in comedy not pitched me to the producer.\n\nDon’t waste time worrying or parroting what others are doing. Early on in my career I would try and go after the gigs that many of my peers were when I should’ve been pursuing projects and shows more suited to my talents.\n\nGet a mentor. I actually did but not because I sought one out consciously. I basically stumbled in to the mentor relationship and I’m grateful regardless.\n\nDoing comedy shows is only a small part of being a comedian. As a stand-up I spend most of my time doing things from my comedy career that aren’t directly comedy-related. I spend a lot of time on travel, researching travel, social media, sending out the promo, and interacting with my agents and avenue staff. It was a lot more than I ever imagined.\n\nYou are a person of enormous influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)\n\nHow about a Turn-Off Tuesdays where we disconnect from our devices and actually engage other people in conversation.\n\nCan you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?\n\nAlot of what is happening to us is how we perceive what is happening to us. I misinterpreted and overreacted to alot of negativity early in my career. I have consciously worked to reframe my outlook and thoughts try to garner positive lessons from whatever comes at me in life.\n\nIs there a person in the world, or in the US whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this, especially if we tag them. :-)\n\nYes, Carlos Santana. His music is an amazing balance of entertainment, inspiration and spirituality."
