        "text": "Tammy Pescatelli. Natasha Leggero. J.Jefferies.\n\nAnybody mention Billy Crystal yet? Whoopi Goldberg.\n\nAlliterative names are good.\n\nI sometimes forget how funny Billy Crystal was as a stand-up comic. He was once the resident MC for the Oscars ceremonies to great approval, so his appeal is broad and well-recognized.\n\nOne of my favorite HBO comedy specials back in the day was 'Billy Crystal; A Comic's Line' a play off of 'A Chorus Line'. That's how far back it dates.\n\nGoing back further, to the other 1970s comics; Robert Klein\n\nHis early HBO comedy specials are on YouTube for fee, still worth watching. Klein was among the best of young boomers bringing fresh blood into stand-up. Klein, David Brenner, Letterman, Jay Leno, Albert Brooks (pre-filmmaker), Richard Belzer (pre-'Munch') ..all these guys were in their early-mid 20s, and that 'borscht-belt' era of club comedy was decidedly ending.\n\nAnd believe it or not, Gilbert Gottfried started doing club stand-up around the time The Beatles broke up. Gilbert's first performance was at 'The Bitter End' club in 1970, he was only 15. His 2 older sisters had brought him there, and after that night he never looked back.\n\nChappelle\n\nBurr\n\nApril Macie\n\nHedberg (r.i.p.)\n\nNatalie Cuomo\n\nAnd any comedian that works clean and is funny, I don't mind dirty or language, but it's so cliche at this point If some is clean and funny, they are definitely solid.\n\nBrian Regan and Jim Gaffigan pull it off.\n\nIronically Regan played a charecter in Loudermilk who cursed alot, pretty sure it was done to play against his act.\n\nDirty is good. Any language is good. The concept of \"cursing\" is a silly restriction.\n\nUntil the ‘prohibited’ words are the whole point of audience association.\n\nTry watching a bleeped version of a lot of comedians to put it in context:\n\nyou won’t even know what the joke was, or if there was one. Underscores they are relying on just a few words.\n\nSeems to me even Eddie Murphy did that in some specials, despite being funny.\n\n\"Working clean\" is a faux pas.\n\nDirty is good. Any language is good. The concept of \"cursing\" is a silly restriction.\n\nSeems to me even Eddie Murphy did that in some specials, despite being funny.\n\n\"Working clean\" is a faux pas.\n\nThat’s a bit simplistic. Working “dirty” just because you can isn’t inherently funny. Nor is working “clean” necessarily unfunny. Saying f-this and f-that throughout a routine gets pretty monotonous. While initially titillating, nonstop raunchy jokes can be off putting. A well timed unexpected expletive can have more impact. I saw an interview years ago with George Carlin - certainly not a prude - who suggested that the use of “dirty words” had gotten out of hand, that it often was being used as a crutch to prop up weak material. Some of my favorite comedians are clean ( Seinfeld and Regan being two) but I also enjoy dirty comics. Most successful standups have a mix of different styles of humor.\n\nThat’s a bit simplistic.

Some of my favorite comedians are clean ( Seinfeld and Regan being two) but I also enjoy dirty comics. Most successful standups have a mix of different styles of humor.\n\nBut \"working clean\" makes me think how Taylor Tomlinson got her start. Performance Preconditions.\n\nWhat I’ve seen of Lenny Bruce—he wasn’t overly funny, but he did test boundaries that needed it.\n\nEnforced clean, aka censorship, is problematic.\n\nI agree on Lenny Bruce. The stuff of his I’ve heard didn’t make me laugh but comedy doesn’t always cross generations. For example, I don’t find some 50s-60s comics funny - Milton Berle and Don Rickles for example, but they killed in their day. I only know Bob Hope from his later TV specials which were pretty bland and unfunny.\n\nI shouldn’t go to mentioning comedians I find unfunny in a thread about good ones… but I concur.\n\nBerle is/was funny (to me).\n\nBut he painted outside the lines a bit much. Still, quite often he was the butt of his own jokes.\n\nLenny Bruce seemed like an intensely cynical person who used the cover of comedy & satire to critique uncomfortable truths abt society in his day, but was rarely funny in it.\n\nWatching Rickles leaves me uncomfortable, but he always ended it by signaling it was an act. He exemplified & lampooned narrow intolerance & pent up anger. And he worked clean.\n\nMeanwhile, some people in the public sphere today, learn the cliché trappings of comedy to sell ugly messages & rely on audience knee-jerk reactions because they know where the buy-in laughter is supposed to come.\n\nBob Hope needed a [movie] script. He was a comedic actor, not a skilled stand-up comic, (imo). He was rarely funny in the way we see stand up comedy today, but several of his pictures were funny.\n\nMeanwhile, some people in the public sphere today, learn the cliché trappings of comedy to sell ugly messages & rely on audience knee-jerk reactions because they know where the buy-in laughter is supposed to come.\n\nThere was a term coined and used in the writers' room at 'Saturday Night: Live' while Tina Fey was its head writer; 'clapter'\n\nA euphemism used for describing a joke that intentionally panders to the audience's expectations. I think it's an astute mash-up, because the jokes' 'tell' is always some perfunctory laughter accompanied by a smattering of applause. Fey found jokes like those to be low hanging fruit, and actively avoided them while at SNL.\n\nSwearing/cursing is invoking the Lord's Name.\n\nWorking dirty (or blue) is different, just coarse humor.\n\nWhen Carson would come back from a commercial break, quite often the audience would be rolling. The comic guests he had on would 'work blue' during the breaks, then come back and work clean. Always wondered what I'd missed.\n\nWorking dirty? Jimmy Carr, Dom De Louise, Buddy Hackett, Robin Williams, Gilbert Godfried, George Carlin, Eddie Murphy, Bob Saget and so many more.\n\nSide note---check out these two clown movies if you can find them---Bobcat Goldthwaite's \"Shakes the Clown\" and \"Death to Smoochie\". Robin William's in both. Both movies are basically insane, and also, hilarious.\n\nIt's odd that no one has mentioned W. C. Fields. The old timers like the Marx Brothers, Harold Lloyd, Charlie Chaplin and such broke the ground for the rest of them. I've never cared for Abbott & Costello aside from the \"Who's On First?\" bit. How many of us grew up with the Three Stooges?\n\nSwearing/cursing is invoking the Lord's Name.\n\nWorking dirty (or blue) is different, just coarse humor.\n\nWhen Carson would come back from a commercial break, quite often the audience would be rolling.

How many of us grew up with the Three Stooges?\n\nLanguage choices. This isn’t church. I’m just dandy with either one, so long as it is not in place of actual content. Like, y’know.\n\nPeople who interject \"like\" & “y’know” are equally annoying & hard to listen to, because often they’re not saying anything. There is no content in stand up if every third word is an \"F-bomb.\" But yeah, I don’t cower just because someone goes \"blue\" or \"blasphemous.\"\n\nA comedian should have SOME facility with language. Isn’t that the point? Else, only mimes would be doing stand up. ( where is my mime emoji? They got ninja emojis for cripes sake).\n\nThe people you mention occurred to me too, but just naming every comedian in one post seemed an overreach. Somebody was going to put me in a headlock & choke me out. Probably you.\n\nHarold Lloyd did stand-up? (I’m not clear whether we were supposed to restrict to stand up comedians).\n\nElse—Gene Wilder would rate too, at least when he’s not playing the ‘overly sensitive new age guy’)."
