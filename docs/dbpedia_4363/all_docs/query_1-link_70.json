        "text": "To think, I knew them when.\n\nAt least three times as a journalist, I had the opportunity to interview performers on the brink of a major advancement in their career, that moment just before they made the transition from unknown to ubiquitous. While at the Thousand Oaks News Chronicle, I spent a summer 1990 afternoon hanging with Alfonso Ribeiro and his father for a story on a dance club they planned to open once “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air” hit the airwaves that fall.\n\nThe same decade saw me dunned with so many publicist requests to interview George Lopez that it became something of an in-joke in the Stockton Record newsroom. Lopez was just a hard-working stand up in those days and I interviewed him twice in advance of gigs at the Punchline in Sacramento. The third interview coincided with a sold-out Stockton performance, Lopez having graduated from comedy clubs to theaters on the strength of his eponymous sitcom. An excerpt from the third article, circa 2003:\n\nThere were years – and they weren’t that long ago – when George Lopez was a regular on comedy stages from Sacramento to Bakersfield. Young and edgy, he earned laughs and more than a few knowing grins with his tales of growing up Latino in the San Fernando Valley.\n\nAll that, of course, is in the past. Today, as the star of a highly rated ABC sitcom, Lopez is among the most recognizable faces in America. Even when “The George Lopez Show” is on hiatus, the comic manages to find his way into prime time – witness his recent turns on the Latin Grammys and Emmy Awards telecasts. All of which begs the question: Has success changed George Lopez? As someone who has interviewed him three times over the past decade, I would suggest it hasn’t. The comic certainly retains the work ethic that drove him from one Central Valley comedy night to another.\n\nAlso largely the same, even with his success, is Lopez’s attitude toward the show-business establishment. Speaking to The Record 10 years ago, the comic came across as openly angry and not a little bit self-righteous as he considered the obstacles Hollywood presents ethnic performers. “I’m trying to maintain my integrity in an industry that doesn’t really allow you to do that,” Lopez said then, noting how he would continue to turn down the drug dealer-gang banger roles Hollywood was offering. ″If people want to think that this is arrogance, then it is. I think it’s nice to have somebody who’s not willing to sell himself out. I don’t feel I’m the last honest Latino, but I’m one.”\n\nReminded of these statements this week, Lopez sounded gruffly pleased. The success of “The George Lopez Show” clearly confirmed his decision to remain true to himself. “My break didn’t come through the Hollywood system. So if you remain pure, when your opportunity comes … it makes you appreciate it that much more. You earned it.” Besides, he never really wanted sitcom fame. “I just wanted a shot at the beginning,” Lopez said. “I just wanted a shot.”\n\nThe case of Jerry Seinfeld presents an intriguing twist on the before-they-were-big theme. Seinfeld was already a stand-up star when I interviewed him 30 years ago this summer, having earned a national following through multiple appearances on “The Tonight Show,” “Late Night with David Letterman” and various and sundry HBO and cable comedy showcases. I had caught a number of those performances and counted Seinfeld among my favorite young comedians of the ‘80s, right up there with the uber-angsted Richard Lewis. (Who, sad to say, never matched Seinfeld’s career trajectory.) When I had the opportunity to interview Seinfeld, I happily called his New York City home.\n\nWhat is striking about the resultant article is the total absence of the one subject that has dominated every Seinfeld profile since: “Seinfeld.” It’s like reading a piece on Harrison Ford that doesn’t mention “Star Wars”: more than just a glaring omission, it borders on reportorial malpractice. The only defense would be to note the interview occurred in 1975; same thing here. The reality is that Seinfeld at the time likely had not received any indication from NBC regarding the series’ future. The pilot episode of what was then titled “The Seinfeld Chronicles” had aired just the month before.\n\nThe pilot, the first of the 180 “Seinfeld” episodes, was written by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, and was directed by Art Wolff. It originally aired on July 5, 1989, and was re-broadcast July 5, 1990, after the show had been picked up as a series. The pilot guest stars Pamela Brull. The episode features several differences to the rest of the series. The character of Cosmo Kramer is named Kessler; Elaine Benes does not appear in the episode; Jerry and George eat at Pete’s Luncheonette as opposed to Monk’s Café; and the character of Claire the waitress (Lee Garlington) was originally planned as a regular but was dropped.\n\nI didn’t see the pilot and it appears not to have figured into our interview. That makes sense when you consider the “Seinfeld” timeline. After the pilot, the second episode would not air for nine months (May 31, 1990). That was followed by three more episodes that spring and then a seven-month hiatus. It would be January 1991 before the series really got rolling on its way to becoming a cultural landmark.\n\nIndeed, “Seinfeld” has so impacted American pop culture over the past 20 years as to overshadow the rest of the cast and creators’ impressive careers. And, with the sitcom still being seen daily by millions, it retains its cultural currency and potency – Seinfeld has essentially become “Seinfeld,” his pre- and post-series career largely erased from the public’s consciousness. This article then captures one of the last moments when he was not “Seinfeld,” when Seinfeld was merely the surname of a popular stand-up comedian.\n\nAugust 4, 1989\n\nFor most of the past decade, the news media has been reporting there is a comedy boom under way in America. The proliferation of comedy clubs in cities large and small, the increased television exposure for stand ups, even the film “Punchline” (1988) are said to be indications that we as a nation are desperately looking for laughs. A witness to comedy’s extraordinary growth is Jerry Seinfeld who, in the dozen years since taking the stage at a Catch a Rising Star amateur night, has attained a professional status that brings sold-out theater performances and late-night appearances with Johnny Carson and David Letterman. In Seinfeld’s opinion, the boom is more a resume.\n\n“It’s a comedy resumption because, you know, in the ‘20s and ‘30s there were far more vaudeville houses showcasing all kinds of entertainment but mostly comedy,” he noted in an interview from his Manhattan home. “In New York City, there were 120 vaudeville houses around at that time and now there’s 15 or 20 comedy clubs in town. And people call it a boom?”\n\nWhat’s powering the renaissance? Seinfeld says he found the answer recently in the New York theater district. “I went to see a Broadway play the other night and it’s difficult to go – the tickets are very expensive, you have to plan everything out. That’s why people go to the movies; you can either go or not go. Comedy clubs are just like the movies; it’s just show up. And it’s very easy to put on. You don’t have to know about show business – the comedian knows that. What you need is tables and chairs. You don’t even need a kitchen, you just need a bar.”\n\nWhile the Brooklyn-born comedian has benefited from the increased attention stand-up’s receiving, he also sees the downside, particularly for audiences. “Certain places, the comedy’s not that good because there are just too many places and not enough comedians. The clubs are kind of pushing the depths of the talent pool. If you went to a comedy club about 15 years ago in New York or Los Angeles, you would probably see the best there is in the country that night.”\n\nSeinfeld fits into that category today. A sharp, smart-alecky observational comedian in the manner of George Carlin and Robert Klein (two of his prime influences), Seinfeld’ casts in absurdist relief the traffic of our daily lives:\n\n* Renting a tuxedo: “That’s a thrill, wearing a suit that’s already been worn by 80 high school guys on the most exciting night their glands have known.”\n\n* Visiting McDonald’s: “Why are they counting at 65 billion? What is the goal? Do they want the cows to turn themselves in voluntarily?”\n\n* Getting married: “I wonder why the guy who stands up for the groom is called the best man? If he’s the best man, why is she marrying the other guy?”\n\nOnstage, Seinfeld is quick-witted, inventive, ingratiating and always funny. Another factor in his success is that he’s a “clean” comedian in an era where the right Lenny Bruce, Carlin and Richard Pryor fought to establish – the freedom to use all the words in the language – has been taken to controversial lengths by such comics as Eddie Murphy and Sam Kinison. Seinfeld says he had no problem with obscenity – he uses plenty of four-letter words in everyday conversation – but they have no place in his act.\n\n“I wasn’t clean when I first started out and the reason I started working clean was just to check my material. It’s not a matter of style, it’s just a matter of me wanting to check my material.” Besides obscenity isn’t what makes Murphy and Kinison funny. “It’s part of their style but not the entire substance.”\n\nSupposedly, it’s easier to get a laugh with obscenity and that’s why so many comedians resort to it. But what is the appeal for audiences? Why do they laugh? Seinfeld takes a thoughtful pause before responding. “It’s titillating somehow. It’s just that juvenile excitement of hearing it over a sound system. You usually just hear those words in conversation but when it’s broadcast over a loud speaker it’s out of place. What if some care manufacturer had a campaign that said, ‘Buy our cars because all the other cars are shit’? We’d all be stunned. It’s just the placement of it.”\n\nAnd if there’s no place for obscenity in a Seinfeld performance, there’s also none for topical humor. “It’s just not that funny. The point is to have a good time; if you want to effect social change, go into politics. If you think topical humor is funny, go ahead – no one is stopping you, there are no rules. But we’re responding to the culture, we don’t create it, and if something’s not in anybody’s mind, why bring it up? You have to reflect the culture.”\n\nThe mirror Seinfeld holds up possesses a bit of an Eastern skew, as the 35-year-old says his embrace of Zen gives his observations a unique spin. “I think the Easter philosophy always looks at things from a couple of steps back. Americans are mostly concerned with ‘Does she have a good body?’ and ‘How much money am I making?’ Eastern philosophy is not what you do but how you’re doing it.\n\n“Let’s say you’re standing in line at the bank. ‘Why do they make you go back and forth? Why are they doing that to us?’ That’s the third eye every comedian has.”"
