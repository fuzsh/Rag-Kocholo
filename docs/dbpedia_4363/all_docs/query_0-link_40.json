        "text": "Calgary comedian Kaylon Lambert shares laughs through his anecdotal and observational comedy style. Influenced by greats like Tom Segura and Dave Chappelle, Kaylon’s jokes, often laced with a splash of dark humour, resonate with diverse audiences. Kaylon’s upcoming Alberta tour marks his one-year milestone in stand-up comedy.\n\nHow would you describe your comedy style?\n\nVery much anecdotal and observational, with a splash of dark humour. Through my 33 years living on this floating rock we call home, I have experienced and seen my fair share of bizarre, funny and horrible situations. I knew where I wanted to take my comedy style, it was a matter of taking all of those experiences and moulding it into something that people can laugh at, and thankfully I have the ability to do so.\n\nWho are some of your influences?\n\nThe biggest influences on my comedy style would be Tom Segura, Shane Gillis, Dave Chappelle and Sam Kinison, to name a few.\n\nWho was your favourite comedian growing up?\n\nI’d have to say Chris Farley. Unlike a lot of my friends growing up, my parents gave me free rein to watch whatever. One of my favourite things to rent was the ‘Best of’ Saturday Night Live VHS, and my favourite is still Saturday Night Live: Best Of Chris Farley, I go back and watch that regularly and I still laugh as hard as I did when I was 8 or 9 years old. Jim Carrey is a close second.\n\nWho is your favourite comedian now?\n\nI actually have two, Mark Normand and Shane Gillis. They are truly two of the best standup comedians doing it right now, in my opinion. I was lucky enough to see Mark Normand at The Laugh Shop before doing my first set ever, and that set was also at The Laugh Shop, so I’d say Normand has a bit of an edge because of that.\n\nWhat is your pre-show ritual?\n\nEasy, I crush a couple of brewskis and while doing that I go over my set to see if there is a joke I want to replace or add, sometimes I’ll write out a completely different set because I feel the crowd will respond to different jokes better.\n\nWhat is your favourite place you have performed? Why?\n\nThe Laugh Shop in Calgary, AB. They gave me my first opportunity to try my standup and it’s also really cool to know that you’re performing on the same some of the biggest names in comedy, including mine and/or your favourites. There’s also no better feeling than walking into a packed club, full of people who came out to the show purely to enjoy some standup comedy.\n\nWhat is your favourite bit you have written and why were you proud of it?\n\nI have a bit about ‘parents and social media’ and the reason why I’m proud of it is because it was the first real anecdotal joke I wrote. One of my favourite things about this joke is that I put my own parents into the joke and that way I am able to relate more with the crowd, be it the younger or older generation, and it allows everyone in the room to take in the joke and enjoy it.\n\nWhat is your favourite medium for listening or finding new comics/comedians?\n\nPodcasts… I destroy comedy podcasts daily! It’s the only type of podcast I will listen to. I also enjoy checking out the weekend shows at the comedy clubs in my area to discover new comedians, local or touring, because a lot of yours or my favourite comedians have THEIR favourites and I’ve noticed those are the comedians touring and opening the comedy shows for them on the road.\n\nDo you have anything to promote right now?\n\nI am currently getting ready to do some light touring around Alberta this month! I just hit my 1 year mark of being a standup comedian, so it’s been really cool to see the hard work I’ve been putting into comedy over the last year start to open up some opportunities for myself. Now I’m always adding dates as the year progresses, but these are the upcoming dates I’m currently promoting and extremely excited for!\n\n– The Calgary Invasion Comedy Show at 50 North Pub & Eatery – Red Deer – March 22nd\n\n– Un-Prohibited Comedy at Prohibition Bar- Calgary – March 27th\n\n– Yuk Yuk’s Pro-Am Comedy at Yuk Yuk’s Comedy Club – Calgary – March 28th\n\nWhere can we follow you?\n\nYou can follow me on Instagram, that’s where I post and update everything related to me and my comedy! Also, you can catch me hosting & producing my weekly comedy show: Laughs at Kaks at Kaks Bar & Podcast every Thursday night.\n\nPAY IT FORWARD: Who is another local comic/comedian we should know about?\n\nErin MK Hill, there hasn’t been a show that I’ve also been a part of, alongside Erin, where she hasn’t crushed! She really is a femme fatale on the microphone, so check her out."
