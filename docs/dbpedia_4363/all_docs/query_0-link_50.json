        "text": "The Ultimate Best Stand-Up Comedians Of All Time\n\nThey say laughter is the best medicine, and there’s no better source of it than stand-up comics. From the unique one-liners George Carlin to the humor of Rodney Dangerfield, stand-up comedians have been making us laugh for decades. In this list, let’s remember the funniest comedians of all time, based on their ability to make us laugh until our sides ache.\n\nI myself did a stint at stand-up comedy in the late 80s and early 90s at a comedy bar called, Snickerz. Did a lot of open mic nights as well as a guest spot on their local tv show called, Nightshift. Comedy is not pretty is a quote from Steve Martin. Not always easy to do stand-up. So much fun if your joke lands right. Trust me a lot of mine bombed. Great experience doing stand-up, and great memories.\n\nWe have a great local comic scene around the Metro Detroit area. Lots of open mic stand-up comedians working on their material. Places like Mark Ridley’s Comedy Castle, The Nail has comedy nights on Fridays with Knuckle Heads Comedy. Detroit House of Comedy offers the best in stand-up comedy. Have a fun night out and do something different. Support your local stand-up comedians."
