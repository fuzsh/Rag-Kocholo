Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Fidelis\n\nMotto Translation: Faithful.\n\nCitations +\n\nBlack, George F., The Surnames of Scotland Their Origin, Meaning and History.
