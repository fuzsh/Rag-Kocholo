Playing with our sense of balance, weight shifts, and quick directional changes, we will carve our way through the space while exploring layers of theatrical performance and expression.\n\nAparna Pisharody is an active and committed Bharatanatyam artist from Greensboro, North Carolina. Growing up in Mumbai (India), Aparna was introduced to Bharatanatyam at a very young age, and she developed a deep love and passion towards this 2000 years old Indian Classical Artform. She continues to nurture her passion for Bharatanatyam under Sathvikaa Shankar (A senior disciple of world-renowned artist Smt. Anita Guha). Understanding the compelling nature of Bharatanatyam and how it connects one to the divinity within themselves is an exhilarating and ongoing journey for her. To move the audience through the presentation of this ancient art form is an inspiration for her. Aparna has performed at various prestigious events within India and the US.\n\nAparna founded Svasti School of Dance in 2013 to impart devotion to Bharatanatyam in all students with the hope that they make it a meaningful part of their lives. She loves to teach because every class is a learning experience for her. She grows artistically and spiritually with every student, every day. Being able to encourage, challenge, and develop passion in the next generation is a sadhana (spiritual prayer) for her. She strives to teach Bharatanatyam through a traditional curriculum, and rigorous practice. Through it all she encourages creativity and humility. Svasti School of Dance performances are held all over the Triad area raising money for Temples, Flood Relief and various charitable organizations. The ultimate wish is that physical and spiritual discipline required on this artistic voyage will guide all to success in every pursuit of their life.\n\nWhen: April 23, 2022\n\nWhere: Destiny Dance Institute\n\n417 Brooks St.\n\nWake Forest, NC 27587\n\nTime: 5:30PM - 7:00PM class/7:00PM - 7:30PM audition\n\n(Dancers auditioning for the summer program must attend the masterclass)\n\nCost: $15 per student\n\nAdvanced students ages 13 and up will have an opportunity to audition for the 4 week 2022 Summer Dance Intensive in Calabria, Italy!

We are so fortunate and so very grateful to work closely with the Dancing Angels Foundation, FINI Dance and the Holding Family Dancers Funds to provide opportunities for dancers like Ava and Kari to travel abroad and get a phenomenal opportunity to experience a different culture and study dance with some of the most celebrated artists and dance educators in the world of dance, all in the unforgettable setting of beautiful Italy.\n\n“Attending the Fini Dance Intensive in Italy this summer was the most amazing experience of my life. I was immersed and exposed to so many different styles of dance and was surrounded by people who are so dedicated and passionate about dance. The teachers were so knowledgeable and motivating, which allowed me to grow as a dancer and learn so much. However, this month abroad not only helped me grow as a dancer, I grew as a person by being introduced to the Italian culture and living in the beautiful town of Villapiana. This was the trip of a lifetime and an unforgettable experience.”\n\nAva Lanzas\n\n“The month I spent in Villapiana was easily the best time of my life. I learned so many new things about Italian Culture. Along with different styles of dance, including Arial and Albanian dance. I saw so much improvement in my dancing though such a short amount of time, I built strength mentally and physically. We would dance 7-9 hours on weekdays, and on the weekends, if there was no showing, we would be able to enjoy the small town. Over the four weeks I was being pushed to my limit in the best way possible, I accomplished things I would have never dreamed of. I am so incredibly thankful to all of the organizations and people who made this possible for me.”\n\nKari Sescoura\n\nSummer intensives like this often serve as stepping stones in the pursuit of dance as a career as they open up new doors, provide unexpected opportunities and allow such rising dancers to delve deeper into their dance training and WFDF is beyond thrilled to be a part of this discovery process. We can’t wait to see what the future holds for these passionate and driven young ladies.\n\nAva and Kari, we wish you both all the best as you continue to pursue your goals and dreams!\n\nDear dance enthusiasts, patrons, supporters, and artists, we hope this message finds you well, healthy, and thriving.

My mom is an opera singer and voice teacher and my father was a percussionist. So, growing up we were always encouraged toward creativity. Really lucky to have had that kind of support. I always got to grow up in New York City which was an amazing environment for culture and exposure.\n\nWhat are some of the challenges you have experienced being a dancer and choreographer and how did you overcome them?\n\nI think that one thing I have learned in all the time spent in pursuit of goals and ideas is that you have to maintain a good relationship with yourself. No matter what the obstacle or challenge is, no matter how many successes and failures, how you talk to yourself through it all, matters so much.\n\nPandemic and the lockdown of this year have been extremely challenging for all, and arts is not an exception. Can you tell us a bit about your experience and how you remained positive and creative during this time?\n\nI’ll go back to family on this one. I’m lucky to have family and good people around me in my professional and personal circles. Trying to stay open and communicative with people, sharing ups and downs and uncertainties, trying to work through frustrations with people I trust. In a time of isolation, I’ve been lucky to not have to take it all on alone and I’ve tried to be super conscious of returning this support in my treatment of others too. I probably don’t always succeed but its definitely something that has helped keep me grounded during this time.\n\nDo you have any projects, works in progress that you would like our audience to know about and follow?\n\nWe just released a very cool short film project with The Mobile Dance Film Festival. The film is titled Side by Side and it was created in tandem between The DASH Ensemble and DASH Academy artists. The film can be accessed through our website thedashensemble.org\n\nLast but not least, If you could meet any dancer or choreographer, dead or alive, who would it be and why? This is probably a little cliche but I would love to spend some time with Fred Astaire."
