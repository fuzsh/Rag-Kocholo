        "text": "This is the latest in a series of features on the 2010 University of Arkansas Sports Hall of Honor inductees.\n\nErick Walder was a member of head coach John McDonnell’s track and field team from 1991-94. He competed in the long and triple jumps under the tutelage of assistant field events coach Dick Booth. He is the 13th representative of men’s track and field inducted into the UA Sports Hall of Honor.\n\nOne of the nation’s best long jumpers during the 1990s, Walder was a 10-time NCAA Champion, a 13-time All-American and an eight-time Southeastern Conference champion in the long and triple jumps during his time with the Razorbacks.\n\nWalder swept the NCAA Indoor long and triple jump titles in 1992-94. He also swept the NCAA Outdoor long jump titles in 1992-94. He added his 10th NCAA title to his resume when he won the 1994 NCAA Outdoor triple jump title.\n\nHe still holds the Arkansas school records in the long jump, indoors (27-8) and outdoors (28-8.25). He also has the collegiate record in the outdoor long jump (28-8.25) to his credit. In the triple jump, his best indoor mark of 56-6.75 ranks No. 2 on the Arkansas all-time list. His best outdoor mark, 56-2, is No. 7 on Arkansas’ all-time list. Walder also holds the SEC Outdoor record in the long jump with his wind-aided mark of 28-1 from the 1992 SEC Outdoor Championships.\n\nDuring his four-year career with the Razorbacks, Arkansas never lost a SEC championship and won seven national team titles during his collegiate career (four indoor, three outdoor). Walder was the SEC Indoor Athlete of the Year and the SEC High point Scorer in 1993 and 1994.\n\nDuring his professional career, Walder was a World Championships participant and was a three-time medalist at the World Indoor and Outdoor Championships in the long jump. He was ranked No. 1 in the US in the long jump for three-straight seasons (1997-99).\n\nUA Sports Hall of Honor members are selected by a vote of former letterwinners in conjunction with the \"A\" Club. The official induction is Friday, Sept. 3, at the Springdale Convention Center. Tickets are $50 and can be purchased from the Razorback Foundation. For more information, call the Razorback Foundation at 479-443-9000."
