        "text": "Mechanics’ Institute Chess Club Newsletter #835\n\nJuly 13, 2018\n\nFischer’s play in that game evoked memories of 1972. In fact, the match games were of a fairly high quality particularly when compared with Kasparov’s championship matches of 1993, 1995 and 2000, for example. Yet the games also reminded many fans how out of place Fischer was in 1992. He was still playing openings of the previous generation. He was, moreover, the only strong player in the world who didn’t trust computers and wasn’t surrounded by seconds and supplicants. He was a player from the past.\n\n—Andy Soltis, in Bobby Fischer Rediscovered (p. 278)\n\n1) Mechanics’ Institute Chess Club News\n\nFIDE Master Ezra Chambers has a full-point lead in the Summer Tuesday Night Marathon with a round to go. The Pacifica teenager has 7 out of 7, including a win over International Master Elliott Winslow, who is tied for second at 6–1 with National Master Russell Wong. Class A-rated Ella Papanek, who is having an excellent tournament, with only a loss to Winslow, is alone in fourth with 5½ points.\n\nFrom round 7 of the Summer Tuesday Night Marathon:\n\nBlack to move (Wong–Walder after 10 Kh1)White to move (Wong–Walder after 20...Ke8)Black to move (Papanek–Askin after 15 g4)White to move (Mackenzie–Shi after 15...Nc5)Black to move (Nyangar–McKellar after 18 e5)White to move (Hilliard–Frank after 11...O-O)White to move (Enkhjargal–Vales after 7...Nbd7)For the solutions, see the game scores for round 7.\n\nSome of the Bay Area’s best players ventured East to play in the 12th Philadelphia International, held June 28–July 2. FIDE Master Josh Stearman led the way, scoring 6 from 9 to not only raise his USCF rating over 2400 for the first time, but also make his first International Master norm. International Master Teddy Coleman scored 5½ points, as did former Mechanics’ member Hans Niemann. Tuesday Night Marathon regular Derek O’Connor finished with 4, but the strength of his opposition was high enough that he actually improved his USCF rating from 2306 to 2309.\n\nBoth Stearman (2403 to 2411) and O’Connor (2320 to 2331) performed above their pre-tournament ratings in the World Open, held in Philadelphia over the July 4th weekend.\n\nGrandmaster Sam Shankland of Walnut Creek has not only won three important tournaments in a row, he is now on the cover of New in Chess, American Chess Magazine, and Chess Life. The 26th-rated player in the world recently filmed a video on how he won the 2018 US Championship. Sam’s website is https://samshankland.com/.\n\nThis program from the 1991 Pan Pacific International put on by the Mechanics’ Institute Chess Club features signatures from tournament participants: Lubomir Ftacnik, Joel Benjamin, Patrick Wolff, Eugenio Torre, John Fedorowicz, Mikhail Tal, Susan Polgar, John Grefe and Walter Browne.\n\n2) July FIDE Ratings\n\nThanks in part to Sam Shankland’s recent surge the United States is now tied with China for the second highest average rating of its top ten players at 2704 (Russia is far ahead at 2744).\n\nRank\n\nNameTitleCountryRatingGamesB-Year 1 Carlsen, Magnus g NOR 2842 8 1990 2 Caruana, Fabiano g USA 2822 8 1992 3 Mamedyarov, Shakhriyar g AZE 2801 8 1985 4 Ding, Liren g CHN 2797 3 1992 5 Kramnik, Vladimir g RUS 2792 0 1975 6 Giri, Anish g NED 2782 0 1994 7 So, Wesley g USA 2780 8 1993 8 Vachier-Lagrave, Maxime g FRA 2779 9 1990 9 Nakamura, Hikaru g USA 2777 9 1987 10 Karjakin, Sergey g RUS 2773 8 1990 11 Anand, Viswanathan g IND 2768 9 1969 12 Aronian, Levon g ARM 2767 8 1982 13 Yu, Yangyi g CHN 2766 14 1994 14 Grischuk, Alexander g RUS 2766 0 1983 15 Nepomniachtchi, Ian g RUS 2757 9 1990 16 Svidler, Peter g RUS 2753 0 1976 17 Radjabov, Teimour g AZE 2751 0 1987 18 Jakovenko, Dmitry g RUS 2749 9 1983 19 Topalov, Veselin g FID 2747 0 1975 20 Navara, David g CZE 2741 14 1985 21 Duda, Jan-Krzysztof g POL 2737 7 1998 22 Harikrishna, P. g IND 2734 1 1986 23 Vitiugov, Nikita g RUS 2734 0 1987 24 Wojtaszek, Radoslaw g POL 2733 3 1987 25 Le, Quang Liem g VIE 2728 0 1991 26 Shankland, Samuel g USA 2727 11 1991 27 Wei, Yi g CHN 2724 14 1999 28 Rapport, Richard g HUN 2719 0 1996 29 Vidit, Santosh Gujrathi g IND 2718 9 1994 30 Cheparinov, Ivan g FID 2712 0 1986\n\nMI Member Daniel Naroditsky is tied for number 12 in the United States at 2615 FIDE.

(Photo: Richard Shorman)\n\n4) Best-Selling Chess Books and Authors\n\nBobby Fischer Teaches Chess was first published in 1966 and according to one of the men involved in the production of the book, Stuart Margulies, it has sold over 1 million copies, making it a strong candidate for the best-selling English-language chess book of all time. Another book aimed for the beginner/near-beginner market, An Invitation to Chess by Kenneth Harkness and Irving Chernev, first published in 1945 (before the Fischer work), was the go-to manual for introducing newcomers to the game. It has sold several hundred thousand copies, making it another best-seller. Many books were published on the 1972 Fischer–Spassky match, with Svetozar Gligoric’s paperback the one which sold best. Visit a second-hand bookstore and you are likely to find copies of all three of these titles on the shelves.\n\nDetermining the best-selling author is a bit trickier, as Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess had multiple authors. Amazon publishes a list of its best-sellers, but this doesn’t include offline sales. We are not certain which author boasts the biggest sales, but International Master Jeremy Silman, a Mechanics’ member for close to twenty years, has to be a contender, with well over 400,000 books sold in a writing career that spans almost four decades. He and his wife Gwen Feldmen’s publishing company, Silman-James Press, has sold 384,000 chess books with just five instructional works—all devoted primarily to players in the 1400–2000 rating range. A sixth title, Pal Benko: His Life, Games and Compositions, a fantastic book, but on a decidedly less-commercial topic, has not sold as impressively.\n\nHere are the sales figures.\n\nHow to Reassess Your Chess 4th edition (published 2010) - 34,000 copies sold\n\nHow to Reassess Your Chess 3 (published 1993) - 73,000 copies sold\n\nAmateur’s Mind - 75,000 copies sold\n\nReassess Workbook - 42,000 copies sold\n\nSilman’s Complete Endgame - 53,000 copies sold\n\nComplete Book of Chess Strategy - 107,000 copies sold\n\nSilman is perhaps best known for How to Reassess Your Chess. Note the totals above do not include the first two additions (1986 and 1991) of this title, which were published by Thinkers’ Press.\n\nJeremy Silman during the filming of his Great Courses series on chess.

Marshall Beaten by Clark and Townsend at Chess Club.\n\nEither Frank J. Marshall, American chess champion, is not the player that he used to be, or the local chess enthusiasts are coming up in the world, for the last night when he played simultaneously against seventeen players but lost two games and drew four. Marshall played simultaneously against fifteen yesterday afternoon in the rooms of the Rochester Chess Club in the Reynolds Arcade, winning all of them. There was a full gallery to see him play at night.\n\nLee Clarke and R. E. Townsend were the players to beat him and Raymond Northrup, George Switzer, J. W. Pease and George Lawler drew with him.\n\nRochester Democrat and Chronicle, 11 Mar 1917, p. 39\n\nMarch 24\n\nBrooklyn Institute CC simul [+26-2=1]. Feuer of Boys High wins from Marshall.\n\nBenjamin Howard Feuer, a member of the champion chess team of the Brooklyn Boys High School, which captured the two interscholastic league trophies this year, distinguished himself by being one of two players to defeat Frank J. Marshall, the United States chess champion, in the simultaneous exhibition given by the latter before the members of the Brooklyn Institute Chess Club, Saturday night, when the international master, who only recently established another record in Buffalo, took on twenty-nine opponents, making a score of 26 wins, 2 losses and 1 draw. Feuer was the first to win his game and, as a reward, the U. S. Champion presented him with a copy of Marshall’s \"Chess Swindles\", a book containing a collection of the former Brooklyn expert’s most notable victories here and abroad, with his own annotation.\n\nJ. Perla was the other player to win his game, while Louis W. Jennings of the Ocean Hill Chess Club obtained a draw. All told, Marshall took about three hours and a half to complete his task. The art room was full to capacity with chess enthusiasts. The full list of the champion’s opponents:\n\nMax Sissman, J. Naylor, P. Wolfson, W. Folfman, Henry Wheeler, J. C. Percy, A. N. Joerg, Edward Taylor, J. P. Jansen, J. Perla, Charles O. Wolff, Henry Livene, B. H. Feuer, L. W. Jennings, Paul Schlein, J. H. Park, E. Hausleiter, S. Simon, Charles McMichael, L. W. Babbitt, W. H. Harpet, I. Chernofsky, J. Schneider, F. D. Radcliffe, W. A. Bristol, W. l. Chappel, Robert Cochrane, H. H. Ridge and C. Todenhaupt.\n\nBrooklyn Eagle, 26 Mar 1917, p. 9\n\nApril 12\n\nNY simul [+69-7=25]. New Record by Marshall In Huge Chess Drive.\n\nNo world records were broken at the New York City Chess Club in Manhattan [at the League of Foreign-Born Citizens, 138 Second Avenue], where Frank J. Marshall last night gave one of his sensational exhibitions of simultaneous play at 101 boards, the largest number of games ever contested at one time within the limits of Greater New York. The high-water mark in that respect had been 65 boards in the Capablanca exhibition in the Eagle Auditorium, February 12, 1915, where the Cuban champion was opposed by 84 opponents. Including consultation parties, there were 125 players in line last night, just 20 short of the total needed to surpass Buffalo’s world record of 144.\n\nMarshall was in fine fettle, starting at 8:45 o’clock, and showed no ill effects when play stopped at 1:20 a. m., at which time all unfinished games were adjudicated by Oscar Chajes, H. M. Phillips and F. P. Beynon. The total score made by the United States champion was 69 wins, 25 drawn games and 7 losses.\n\nThe winners against the champion, who included B. H. Feuer of the Boys High School, and A. Kreines of the Eastern District High School, all received valuable book prizes. The other winners were Harry Borochow of City College, who had also won from Kupchik [in a simultan exhibition two days earlier]; C. B. Isaacson of Columbia, John W. Scoville and Irving Kaplan of Morris High School, and Louis Gaber of the N. Y. City Chess Club. Drawn games were credited to Mrs. Harriet A Levasseur and Miss Mayo-Smith of the Women’s Chess Club, H. Holth, N. Stern, H. Polte, S. Scherr, Meyer Isaacs, A. J. Gordin, H. Wagner, Morris Tarkoff, Benjamin Levine, Nathan Pines, J. Bertrand Mulligan, S. A. Clapp, Walter Goldenberg, Ernest Knapp, J. Belloch, Dr. Samuel Deltz, David Perla, J. Perla, Abe Yennlock, S. Seplowin, George Strezynski and Percy Elias. Marshall was introduced to the gathering by Perez Atkes [sic], manager of the N. Y. Chess Club, and addresses were also made by Nathan Phillips, president of the League of Foreign-Born Citizens and H. M. Phillips.\n\nBrooklyn Eagle, 13 Apr 1917, p. 21\n\nFrench C14\n\nMarshall–Frank James Isaacson Jr.\n\n1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. Bxf6 Bxf6 6. Nf3 Be7 7.

Rxb4? 2 Kc3 Rb1 3 Ra7 is drawn, according to Gelfand,\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 3 Ra7)\n\nBut if now 3 ... b5 4 Rxc7 Rc1+\n\nWhite to move (analysis, after 4 ... Rc1+)\n\n5 Kd3 Rxc4 6 Rc6!\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 6 Rc6)\n\nOr 6 Rxc4? bxc4+ 7 Kxc4 -+.\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 7 Kxc4)\n\n6 ... Kg5 7 Rxd6 Rh4 8 Rb6\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 8 Rb6)\n\n8 ... b4 (8 ... Rxh2 9 Rxb5 is a draw)\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 9 Rxb5)\n\n9 d6 Kf6 10 d7+ Ke7 11 Rd6 Kd8 and Black wins.\n\nWhite to move (analysis, after 11 ... Kd8)\n\n2 Ra7\n\nBetter than 2 cxb5?! Rxb4+ 3 Kd3\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 3 Kd3)\n\n3 ... Rxb5 4 Kd4 and now\n\nIf 4 Kc4 Rc5+ 5 Kd4 g5.\n\nWhite to move (analysis, after 5 ... g5)\n\nOr if 4 Rc2?! Rxd5+ 5 Ke4?! Re5+ 6 Kd4 c5+\n\nWhite to move (analysis, after 6 ... c5+)\n\nSo, after 4 Kd4, 4 ... g5\n\nWhite to move (analysis, after 4 ... g5)\n\nThe pawns roll, and 5 Ra7 is met by 5 ... Rc5\n\nWhite to move (analysis, after 5 ... Rc5)\n\nAlso, 2 c5 is not a good idea, because 2 ... Rxb4+ 3 Ke3 dxc5\n\nHere 4 Ra6+ Kg5 5 Rc6\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 5 Rc6)\n\n5 ... c4 6 Rxc7 Kf6 7 d6\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 7 d6)\n\n7 ... Ke6 8 d7 Ke7 9 Kd4\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 9 Kd4)\n\n(9 Kd2? Rb2+) 9 ... Rb2 10 Rb7\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 10 Rb7)\n\n10 ... g5 11 Kc3 (11 Kc5? c3) 11 ... Rb3+ 12 Kc2 g4 13 Rc7\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 13 Rc7)\n\nand 4 Ra7 Rd4 5 Rxc7 Rxd5 -+.\n\nWhite to move (analysis, after 5 ... Rxd5)\n\n2 ... Rxb4 and Black is winning\n\n3 Rxc7\n\nIf 3 Kc3? Rxc4+.\n\nWhite to move (analysis, after 3 ... Rxc4+)\n\n3 ... Rxc4+\n\n4 Rxc4 bxc4\n\n5 Kxc4\n\nBlack to move\n\nNow Black wins with the kingside pawns.\n\n5 ... g5\n\n6 Kd4\n\nand if White tries to promote first, 6 Kb5 g4\n\nWhite to move (analysis, after 6 ... g4)\n\n7 Kc6 h4 8 Kxd6 g3 9 Ke6\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 9 Ke6)\n\n9 ... g2 10 d6 g1=Q 11 d7 Qb6+ 12 Ke7 Qc7 and wins.\n\nWhite to move (analysis, after 12 ... Qc7)\n\n6 ... g4\n\n7 Ke3 Kg5\n\nWhite to move\n\n8 Kf2 h4\n\n9 Kg2 Kf4\n\n10 Kf2\n\nBlack to move\n\n10 ... Ke4\n\n11 Ke2 Kxd5\n\n12 Ke3 Ke5\n\n0–1\n\nWhite to move\n\nThe starting position shown did not occur in the game. It arises if White plays 1 Ra2 instead of 1 b5. The actual game was\n\n1 b5 Rf3\n\n2 Ke4 Rf6\n\n3 Ra2 g5\n\n4 Ra7\n\nBlack to move\n\n4 ... Rf4+! this extra move moves White’s king a square further away.\n\n5 Kd3 Rf7\n\n6 c5!?\n\nBlack to move\n\n6 ... dxc5\n\n7 d6 Rd7!\n\nWhite to move\n\n8 Rxc7 Rxd6+ naturally Black does not trade rooks\n\n9 Ke4 Rd4+!\n\nWhite to move\n\n10 Kf5 h4\n\n11 Rc8 Rf4+\n\n12 Ke5\n\nBlack to move\n\n12 ... c4\n\n13 Rh8+ Kg7\n\n14 Rc8 Kg6\n\nWhite to move\n\n15 Rg8+ Kh5\n\n16 h3 c3\n\n17 Rh8+\n\nBlack to move\n\n17 ...

Qh2+)\n\nOr 23 Ra6 g4 (23 ... h3 24 Ra2 Rf6 -+ Black will advance the g-pawn) 24 Ra2 Rf6 25 Ra7+ Kg6 26 Ra6 Rxa6!\n\nWhite to move (analysis, after 26 ... Rxa6)\n\n27 bxa6 c2 28 a7 c1=Q 29 a8=Q\n\nBlack to move (analysis, after 29 a8=Q)\n\n29 ... Qc3+ 30 Kd6 h3 31 Qg8+ Kh6 32 Qf8+ Kg5\n\nWhite to move (analysis, after 32 ...
