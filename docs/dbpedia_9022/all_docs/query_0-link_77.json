Pensive--a much-publicized college speak- Several months ago I inserted in the in g, prr,!;ram and the campus-oriented Conl- RECORD a calculation provided by O. R. Strackbein, chairman of the Nationwide Committee on Import-Export Policy, in which he estimated the average global burden of freight and insurance on our total imports. His estimate, based on our trade with England and Japan, was 17%2 percent for our trade with the world as a whole. I have no reason for ques- tioning Mr. Strackbein's estimate. It was well documented. Virtually all other countries record their imports on a c.i.f. basis, which in- cludes not only the cost but also insur- ance and freight charges incurred in bringing the goods from the foreign port to the port of entry. This AS what we should do as a basis for reporting our imports. Because of the method we follow our imports are undervalued by the amount of the shipping charges, in- eluding insurance. That is why it creates the wrong im- pression to report that our 1965 imports were only $21.36 billion when it cost some $3.7 billion more to bring the goods to our ports of entry. We swell our breasts with pride over our ability to compete with other countries. Well, at this point we should release $3.7 billion of this air from our lungs and bring in our chest by that much. On the export side, in order to feel good and in order to prove that the trade agreements program has been a huge success, we commit an equally unpardon- able sin-one of about the same propor- tions as the one just described. Our executive departments--not in- eluding Agricultural which should be given honorable mention for showing the volume of farm exports generated by Public Law 480 and Federal subsidies of wheat, cotton, and so forth--namely, Treasury and Commerce, have not been satisfied to show our private commercial exports, free of vast subsidies, but in- clude giveaways, sales for foreign in- edible currencies and seemingly what- ever else they can lay their hands on. They do leave military shipments out of total exports, but that is about the only place where they draw the line. Mr. Speaker, I do not know how large the 19,65 exports were under Public Law 480, AID, and so forth, but in 1964 the combined exports generated in this fashion plus those called commercial- because they were sold through private channels but were subsidized-amounted to $3.7 billion. The outstanding ones among., the so-called commercial sales were wheat, wheat flour, and cotton. Our disposal of these products did noth- ing to prove our competitive capacity. Quite the contrary. Without the subsi- dies we could not have met the world price and could only have sold at cut prices, if at all. It is safe to say that the 1965 exports under .AID, Public Law 480, and so north, were at least equal to the $3.7 billion of 1964. Add this to the $3.7 billion by which we undervalued our imports in 1965 and we reach a total of $7.4 billion. This is a respectable distortion. Reduce our reported experts of $:16.56 billion by $3.7 billion and the figure drops to $22.9 billion. This operation might be called trimming away the blubber and streamlining our figures.

Therefore, the Communist influencer nfluence Is cleverly injected into civil disobedience and reprisals against our economic, political, and social system. There are those who scoff at the signifi- cance of these student flareups, but let us make no mistake: the Communist Party does not consider them insignificant, The partic- ipants of the new left are part of the 100,000 \"state of rnind\" members Gus Hall, the party's general secretary, refers to when he talks of party strength. He recently stated the party is experiencing the: greatest upsurge In its history with a \"one to two thousand\" increase in membership in the last year. For the first time since 1959, the party plans a national convention this spring. We can be sure that high on the agenda will be strategy and plans to win the new left and other new members. A Communist student, writing in an official party organ, recently stated, \"There is no question but that the new left will be won.\" 'T'hus, the Communists' intentions are abundantly clear. We hove already seen the effects of some of their stepped-up activities, and I firmly believe a, vast majority of the American public is disgusted and sickened by such social orgies. One recourse is to support and encourage the million of youth who refuse to swallow the Communist bait. Another is to let it be known far and wide that we do not intend to stand idly by and let demagogs make a mockery of our laws and demolish the foundation of our Republic. EXPORT SURPLUS A $7 BILLION MIRAGE (Mr. DENT (at the request of Mr. VIVIAN) was granted permission to ex- tend his remarks at this point in the RECOx) and to include extraneous mat- ter.) Mr. DENT, Mr.' Speaker, the Depart- ment of Commerce recently issued a re- port on our balance of trade for 1965. According to that report this country ran up an export surplus of $5.2 billion last year. This was a decline of $1.5 billion from the surplus reported for 1964, which was given as $6.7 billion. The setback came from an import increase of 14 percent in 1965 over 1964: while exports rose only 4 percent.

COMPTON I. WHITE, JR. OF IDAHO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 7, 1966 Mr. WHITE of Idaho. Mr, Speaker, the Job Corps program in Idaho has re- cently become a subject of national In- terest. To assure that the membership is kept fully informed on current devel- opments, I offer for publication in the RECORD the following three news- paper articles: [From the Owyhee (Idaho) Nugget, Feb. 10, 1966] MARSING JOB CORPSMEN GRADUATE FROM CENTER Two corpsmen, Roland Bland and Jeffery Bolden, Jr., received certificates of comple- tion February 7, 1966 at the Marsing Job Corps Conservation Center. ROLAND BLAND Roland Bland, 17, is from Petersburg, Va. and was transferred to the Marsing Center from Curlew Job Corps Conservation Center, Curlew, Wash., on October 25, 1965. He originally entered the Job Corps program June 10, 1965. Roland was promoted to as- sistant corpsman leader while at Curlew and was promoted to corpsman leader when he arrived at Marsing. He was sent to our cen- ter to assist us by providing corpsman lead- ership at our initial stages. While at Marsing he was assigned duties of teacher's aid and as work leader. He per- formed these duties in an excellent manner. He previously completed the education pro- gram while at Curlew Job Corps Conservation Center. Roland was transferred to Kilmer Job Corps Urban Center in Edison, N.J., to further his training in his desired trade skills of machinist and welding. This Urban Center has a maximum enroll- ment of 2,500 corpsmen and Roland will be able to stay up to a maximum of 2 years at this center starting from the time he entered the Job Corps in June 1965 JEFFERY GOLDEN Jeffery Bolden, Jr., 20, is from Mount Ver- non, Ala., and came to this center November 23, 1965. Jeffery excelled in the education and work program and progressed rapidly. He advanced from the Job Corps fourth level to the ninth level In approximately 3 months and has completed the basic education pro- gram. He also has learned and practiced basic work attitudes and skills. His qualifications were discussed with the employment service at his hometown and they stated that with his basic knowledge, work habits and attitudes, he can have a choice of several jobs at the present time. Because he has completed the basic educa- tion-work program and has been assured of job placement, he has fulfilled the purpose of the Job Corps program and was graduated to become a taxpayer. [From the Owyhee (Idaho) Nugget, Feb. 10, 1966] MARSING JOB CORPS CENTER To EXPAND TO 168 CORPSMEN Enrollees at the Marsing Job Corps Con- servation Center will be increased by 56 corpsmen by June 15, from the 112 now at the Center, reported Daniel Weir, regional Job Corps coordinator, Bureau of Reclama- tion, and Cleve S. Bolingbroke, Center direc- tor. This will make a total of 168 corpsmen, and the staff will be increased from the present 31 to 47. \"By expanding the Center,\" the men said, \"it will mean a far better vocational training program in automotive maintenance, heavy equipment operation, concrete and brick work, carpentry, welding, and many more vocational trades. More and better equip- ment will be brought to the site. Over $150,000 will be spent at the Center between now and June 15 for expanded fa- cilities which will include a new 58-man dormitory, a 1,000-square-foot dispensary, a new gym 90 by 96 feet, and a new shop building. Plans are being formulated to develop the corpsmen's social abilities and help them find a better place in society. Wednesday morning Mr. Weir, Mr. Boling- broke, E. R. Indreland, deputy director of the Marsing Job Corps works program, met with Marsing Mayor Dave Haken, and Harold Curt, president of the Marsing Rod and Gun Club, to discuss plans on beautifying the Marsing Island Park. The Center plans to spend several thousand dollars on the island project, which should make a beautiful place for all to enjoy. [From the Cottonwood (Idaho) Chronicle, Feb. 10, 1966] The need for better communication be- tween citizens of Cottonwood and the sur- rounding communities and the Job Corps Conservation Center at Cottonwood has been recognized since the opening of the camp and the arrival of the corpsmen at the Center. In November, a group of public-spirited citizens of Cottonwood from social-action groups and churches met with the staff at the Center and established a coordinating council. This council has now become a point of contact between the town and the camps. On February 1 the group met for the first time in the new year, to continue discus- sions of ways and means for interesting other organizations of the community in the work at the Job Corps Center, and es- pecially to devise methods for establishing more points of contact between the two groups. It was felt that one of the important ways in which men and women of Cotton- wood could observe the educational facili- ties and the accomplishments of the Job Corps conservation crews was by actual visits to the camp. During these visits, the staff and various counselors and instructors could answer questions and explain the educational and vocational facilities open to the corpsmen. The boys, themselves, would be available for answering questions about their life at the Center and in the forest \"spike camps\" to which they go vol- untarily for ranger training and experience. Another effective form of communication, it was felt, would be having some of the young men attend open meetings of the social-action groups in Cottonwood to ob- serve how these function-especially how various community projects are proposed, carried out, completed, or tabled. They also hope some of the women's organiza- tions might participate, so a broader under- standing of the aims and objectives of the program of the Job Corps might lessen the communication gap between the town and the Center. Attending the meeting were Len Kuther, chairman; Cletus Uhlorn for the business community, Bud Walkup and Ladd Arnoti; Center Director Robert R. Lusk, Margaret Raymond, VISTA Volunteer; Sam Jordan, and Otto H. Ost. An Important Warning for the Future EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. ABRAHAM J. MULTER OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, February 16, 1966 Mr. MULTER. Mr. Speaker, Samuel F. Pryor has just returned from a tour of all of our bases in southeast Asia and has made some very important observa- tions which should serve as a warning for the future. Some of his conclusions are given in the following column by Ruth Mont- gomery which appeared in the New York Journal American of February 11, 1966: CAPITAL LETTER: WHAT IF RED CHINA HAD OUR MUSCLE? (By Ruth Montgomery) WASHINGTON.-A nongovernmental avia- tion expert who directed the development of 50 overseas military airfields during World War II has just returned from a compre- hensive tour of all U.S. bases in southeast Asia. His conclusion: President Johnson has been right every step of the way in his Vietnam policy. Samuel F. Pryor, longtime executive of Pan American World Airways, made the trip in company with our Air Force Pacific Com- mander In Chief, Gen. Hunter Harris, Jr. Having convinced himself of the rightness of our policy-both the lull and the resumed bombing-Pryor reserves his scorn for those who say that America should pull out of the area. He has this word of warning for the doves, and for the fence-sitting nations of the world : \"Add together our guided missile program, our ICBM's and nuclear capacity, our Air Force, Polaris submarines, Navy, Marines, artillery and Army, and you have the great- est military strength In the history of man- kind. Couple this with our productive ca- pacity, which is half of the entire world's, Approved For Release 2005/06/29: CIA-RDP67B00446R000400020007-9 Approved For Release 2005/06/29 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000400020007-9 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX February 17, 1906 and imagine what would happen if the Red Chinese possessed this strength. \"They'd be in MoVow and Paris, Africa and South America right now, and half of our American cities would be bombed out. Let's face facts. Do we want this to hap- pen to our children, or do we want to stop the Red Chinese now? Do we want them to overrun southeast Asia and Thailand, and then pick off sparsely settled Australia? That's our choice.\" Pryor visited every U.S. base in South Viet- nam, Taiwan, and Okinawa, plus all the \"mil- it.ixy assistance\" places in Thailand. From long experience lie says that no war is kind, but that we are \"fighting a kind war in Vietnam.\" He explains that during the recent bombing lclll, the Presdent was in effect saying to the Vietcong: \"Now you see what's happening. Please stop. We don't want to hurt you.\" When the Reds refused to listen to the voice of reason, Pryor thinks the President had \"no alternative but to give them another taste of our strength.\" He also assures the hawks that the lull was by no means wasted on our side. We were using that period, he says, to build up \"tremendous strength,\" and through intelligence and flyovers to gage the cap- ability of the enemy in rebuilding its bombed-out bridges and supply roads. As a narcotics expert, Pryor looked into its smuggling problem during the Asian tour. The contraband drugs are moving out of Red China into the black markets of the world, and Pryor says: \"Heroin is the stuff you would only want your enemies to use. Iced China has a strict ban on its use by its own people, but it is moving out for sale .n the free world.\" Pryor, despite his conviction that the Pres- ident is right in stepping up the pace of the war, is anything but a saber rattler. Returning here only long enough to make a private report to the Bureau of Narcotics, he is now off to the Holy Land in company with Bishop Walter Gray of the Connecticut liipiscopal diocese. \"We will visit every spot in Jordan and Israel that was trod by the Prince of Peace,\" he says. Pryor and the bishop even have rare permission to pass both ways through the Mandelbaum Gate which separates the two warring nations. The U.S. Merchant Marine Academy- Training School for Our Nation's Sea- going Heroes EXTENSION OF REMARKS HON. LESTER L. WOLFF OL' NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday. February 16, 1966 Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Speaker, the Mer- chant Marine Academy at Kings Point, N.Y., which is located in the congres- sional district I have the honor to repre- sent in this distinguished body, has been a steady source of stalwart men of the sea. That the Academy produces men is evidenced by the fact that three Kings Point alumni have been cited for bravery and outstanding service in Vietnam. I would like at this point to include in the RECORD a newspaper story about the most recent Kings Point graduate, Navy Comdr. Alexander C. Kuegler, Jr., and his service to our Nation: THIRD KINGS POINT GRAD CITED AS VIETNAM HERO Navy Colndr. Alexander C. Kuegler, Jr_, of Sea Cliff is the latest of three graduate.' of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point to be cited for outstanding service in Vietnam. Kuegler was recently awarded the Viet- namese Medial of Honor and the Navy Com- mendation Medal for bravery under gun Lire while U.S. military adviser to the Com- mander, River Force. CLASSMATES IN 1944 Previously, Lt. Comdr. Harvey E. Rod:ers, of Smithtown, was awarded the Vietnamese Medal for Gallantry for his part in sinking a Vietcong armored vessel in Vung Ro Bay md Comdr. Paul C. Ewing, of McLean, Va., re- ceived the Navy Commendation Medal for establishing and operating a complex mari- time advisory program. Kuegler, a member with Ewing of the class of 194:4, was cited for his service be- tween July 4, 1963, and July 4, 1964, which \"provided advisory assistance which proved combat readiness of Vietnamese Navy in support of counterinsurgency of ellort against Vietcong.\" Water Pollution in Michigan-A Way to Its Solution Michigan, like all other States, has been a bit like the farmer who was approached by the county agent and offered new advice on the latest and best ways to farm. The farm- er replied, \"Thank you very much for your help, but I am not farming right now as well as I know how.\" I say this with due deference to Mr. Loring F. Deming, the execu- tive secretary, and to the other members of our Michigan Water Resources Commission who over the years have done one of the best jobs in the United States of managing water resources. I can well recall that for a long time I used to receive a visit during- just about every Congress from either Milt Adams, former ex- ecutive secretary of the Michigan Water Re- sources Commission, or from our able assist- ant attorney general, Nick Olds, two of any very dear friends. Both of these men are among the most able officials and public- interest oriented individuals anywhere, and I think that all three of us looked forward to these visits. They initiated a regular tilt dealing with legislation sponsored by me which each of these good gentlemen sin- cerely felt would put our State agencies out of business, a calamity desired by none of us. Our contacts started back in 1956 when Congressman Joarr BLATNIK first began the fight for meaningful water pollution control with the introduction of what was to become Public Law 660, the fundamental Federal water pollution :law. This was enacted after the opposition of the States, some com- munities, and most industries, as well as the dedicated opposition of the Eisenhower ad- ministration, was overcome. All of the op ponents of this legislation; industrial groups, State agencies, and the administration, stressed what to them were valid reasons for opposition. Industry pleaded the problems of compliance and cost increase; State agen- cies feared that the proposed legislation im- pinged upon their treasured jurisdiction; and the Eisenhower administration argued that \"water pollution was a uniquely local blight,\" and of course worried that the legislation would provide $50 million a year to assist communities in construction of desperately needed sewage abatement works. Ultimately the differences with the State administrators were resolved by limiting the Federal activity to areas of pollution origi- nating in one State and affecting health, life, and welfare in other States. The objections of the polluters and of the executive branch were simply battered aside, or compromises were made which resulted in garnering of a vote here or there, sufficient unto the need for passage of the legislation. To their great credit, the Michigan Water Resources Commission, and my old friend, Milt Adams, recognized the wisdom of that legislation and fought valiantly for it at the end. I saw my two beloved friends at the time I introduced a draft of the bill permitting communities to request the assistance of the Federal Government in the abatement of pollution coming; from their upstream neighbors. This bill was changed to pro- vide that the Governor of the State could request the Public Health Service to com- mence proceedings for the abatement of intrastate pollution. It then became :law and was supported by my two friends and Michigan's State agencies. Parenthetically, it was this legislation which was utilized. to initiate the Federal cleanup now taking place on the Detroit River at the request of former Governor Swainson. I was again visited by my two old friends when I introduced legislation to establish Federal standards for the abatement of pol- lution of interstate and navigable waters and to establish a. Federal agency to handle pollution of our waters. It has been a remarkable experience to me to observe the continuing opposition of EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. JOHN A. BLATNIK OF MINNESOTA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, February 16, 1966 Mr. BLATNIK. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to commend to my colleagues the very excellent speech delivered by our good friend JOHN DINGELL at the Clean Water Conference of the Michigan State Association of Supervisors on the subject of water pollution: WATER POLLUTION IN MICHIGAN-A WAy TO ITS SOLUTION (Address of Hon. JOHN D. DINGELL, Democrat, 16th Congressional District of Michigan, to the Michigan State Association of Super- visors, on. January 18, 1966, at their Clean Water Conference in Lansing, Mich.) Nly dear friends, I want to express my graaitude to you for the privilege of being here today and for the opportunity of dis- cussing one of the most pressing resource problems of our day. I want to commend both my valued friend, Ed Connor, one of our outstanding public officials, for his ex- pression of confidence in me, and the asso- ciation for its interest in this desperate p: ob- lem. of water pollution. The title assigned to me was, \"Water Pollu- tion in Michigan.\" I would like to take the liberty of adding to that title the word:-, \"A Way to Its Solution.\" Briefly that solution is Federal, State, and local cooperation, large expenditures of funds, and vigorous enforce- ment of our antipollution laws. Before I observe any of you going to steep, I want to make it very clear that it is not. my purpose to commence a doleful recitation of contamination of our State's once pristine waters. Nor do I intend to descend to a lugubrious recital of the effects of this con- lamination on health, welfare, and recrea- tional opportunities of our people. Neither will I go into its devastating effects upon fish and wildlife and on the attracting of new industry to our State. Certain of my comments will necessarily touch on these matters but only as incidental to a calm discussion of our water problems.

Dempsey who pointed up in a citation presented to Jessee by Don Russell of Wesleyan the gooc: fortune that accrued to Connecticut when Jessee left the Pacifio coast, where he already had demon- strated his prowess as athlete and mentor. Looking on were scores of football's finest, from admiring State colleagues to national figures such as Syracuse's Ben Schwartz- walder, Penn State's Rip Engle, Otto Graham of Coast Guard, Army's Paul Dietzel and Eddie Enos of Montreal Loyola, a University of Connecticut product. Representative EMILIO Q. DADDARIO, Demo- crat of Hartford, a Little All-America back at Wesleyan, added to the applause. Senator ABRAHAM RiBrcoFF, Democrat of Hartford, had commended Jessee earlier. Joe Fontana of Southington, who chaired the event, lauded Jessee as one of sports' \"most fierce competitors.\" Jessee will be AFCA's first Connecticut and small college president. Dempsey cited the coach's record of 144 victories to 74 defeats and 7 ties, and his 4 perfect seasons. The Governor saluted Jessee as \"a man wholly dedicated to the well-being and bet- terment of intercollegiate sports.\" Karl Kurth, Trinity line coach who is to succeed Ray Oosting as athletic director at the col- lege, introduced Costing at a brief ceremony. Jessee's wife, Charlotte, also was acclaimed for her contribution to the coach's achievements. Weaver High's Edward T. Knurek presented matched luggage to Jessee. There also were comments from Trinity Dean Bob Vogel, Fred Tonzel, of New York, called the col- lege's most loyal fan, and George Ferris, its most loyal alumnus. Also there were Wesleyai 's Norm Daniels, Hugh McCurdy, its athletic director, and Waino Fallback, of Middletown High. Jesse Dow represented southern Connecticut, and Bill Moore and Bill Loika were from cen- tral Connecticut. Tom Kelly, of Manchester, was among the football editors on hand, and Tom Monahan, athletic director at Bristol, and Connecticut's Bob Engels were among other well-wishers. Fern Tetreau, of Fairfield, spoke for the. Connecticut Football Coaches Association, which he heads. Connecticut's J. Orleans Christian, newly inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame, shared the throng's congratulations. \"I'm pretty proud,\" said Christian-of both his and Jessee's honors. Affiliated Young Democrats, Inc., of New York State Call for Positive Democratic Leadership in the New York State Legislature EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. ABRAHAM J. MULTER OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 7, 1966 Mr. MULTER. Mr. Speaker, Harold R. Moskovit, president of the Affiliated Young Democrats, made the following announcement: The State legislative committee of the Affiliated Young Democrats of New York, at a meeting held on January 8, 1966, at the Hotel Piccadilly in New York City, called for active and positive leadership of Demo- crats in the assembly and State senate with full responsibility to all the people of the State to assure reelection in 1966. The organization expects its legislative program for 1966 to be introduced in the State legislature by their 22 members in the State senate of which the chairman is Senator Samuel L. Greenberg, of Brooklyn, and their 47 members in the assembly, of-which the chairman is As- semblyman Daniel M. Kelly, of New York County. Their legislative program follows: We demand a bipartisan committee in State and New York City to set up a long- range tax program for 25 years and not the yearly rush for expediency.

L-` HON. ALVIN E. O.'KONSKI OF WISCONSIN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 7, 1966 Mr. O'KONSKI. Mr. Speaker, amid all the dissensions and the violence on our campuses today, unfortunately the voice of the dissenter gets the most pub- licity. The voice of the fairminded, in- telligent, and responsible student is sel- dom seen on TV or printed in the news- papers. This article written by Richard Rus- sell, a student in his junior year at Wis- consin State University-Eau Claire, and appearing in the Spectator, the student newspaper is one of the best appraisals of the Vietnam war that I have yet seen. I recommend this article to my col- leagues: DISEASES AREN'T CURED BY TREATING SYMPTOMS (ABOUT THE AUTHOR.-A 21/2-year veteran of the Spectator staff, Richard Russell has closely pursued the development of the Viet- nam war through extensive daily reading. (\"America can't keep playing diplomacy to please countries like the Upper Volta Repub- lic. It's about time our Government realized that, if we don't act in our own self-interest, no one else will do it for us,\" Russell says. (Russell's article is the first on \"The Soap- box,\" a page of opinion and depth reporting which will be featured throughout the year.) (By Richard Russell) Take an area of 40 million people and 284,000 square miles (about the same as Wis- consin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky). Give it a steady temperature of 70-plus degrees and a summer rainy season which yields 80 inches of precipitation an- nually (much like southern Florida). Run a mountain range of 9,000 feet (like Oregon's Cascades) through the middle of it, and cover the rest with densely overgrown swamp- land (like Louisiana's). Attack the inhabitants with 200,000 native guerrillas and respond with 200,000 fcreign mercenaries. You now have a recipe for war in Indochina. The people of the peninsula are largely a mixture of the Indonesians of the south and the Chinese of the north-whence the Indochinese. They had a flourishing civiliza- tion of their own between 600 and 1750 A.D. The Khmers, as they then called themselves, had their capital and chief religious center in the city of Angkor. The recently discov- ered ruins of the Angkor Wat (temple) indi- cate a high level of architectural development.

Be- tween 1859 and 1893, France occupied the splinter states of Cambodia, Laos, Cochin China, Annam, and Tonkin. Cochin China was made a colony; the rest were pro- tectorates. France improved the region somewhat, with roads, harbors, and commerce, but kept a firm hand on the controls of government. The native rulers were allowed to continue, but they had only nominal power. France operated Indochina as a. monopoly. There was considerable resentment built; up against this attitude of the French by the time World War II started. When Vichy Prance ceded control of Indochina to the tyrannical Japarese, resentment continued to mount. After Japan had lost the war, France had difficulty reasserting its terri- torial claim because of increasing pressure From Indochinese nationalists. THE RED MENACE Now, for a moment, let us look at another time and another place. Back in 1917, while Germany was at war with the world, a revo- lution broke out in Russia against the op.. pressive regime of Czar Nicholas II. Nicholas was defeated, deposed, and later killed. A democratic government lasted only a few months before Bolsheviks led by Nikolai Lenin and Leon Trotsky overthrew it for their own Communist regime. The Communists also gained control of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Mongolia, and parts of Finland and Japan. World War II presented them with an opportunity to seize Czechoslovakia, Rumania, Albania. Bulgaria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, East Germany, and Mast Austria. In 1947 they saw another opportunity. The world was weary of war, and dismissed and rebellion in China as insignificant. It was really a Communist invasion. In 2 years, Red leader Mao Tse-tung had driven the na- tionalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek onto the island of Taiwan, thus bringing into the Communist fold the most populous nation on earth. in later years, the world has seen commu- nism expand into North Korea, Tibet, East Congo, and Cub-a, with influence in Egypt, Algeria, Guinea, Indonesia, and any number of South American nations. 0 STRIKES In all their gore s, the Communists never once won a democratic election. Their only loss was East Alt=,tria, when that nation was neutralized. Yugoslavia, although pursuing its own course under Josef Tito, remains firmly Communist. Returning to the Indochina of 1947, we find that France had granted greater auton- omy to Cambodia and Laos. Cochin China, Anna.m, and Tonkin had been combined into the single country of Vietnam. All three nations were undergoing very gradual emancipation. lint some Indochinese could not wait. Na- tionalist forces demanded immediate sover- eignty. Rebellions flared. The French For- eign Legion busied itself with brush fire wars. During this period, the expansionist Mao met Vietnam's Lo Chi Minh, a leader who, like Mao himsel:, was it self-made man of great personal appeal and considerable mili- tary ability. With Mao's support, Ho organ- lied the immodestly named Vietminh, mas- queraded. as it nationalist to solicit support, and launched a. vicious guerrilla war against French rule in Indochina. As this war drew international attention, O.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles recognized the scope of the problem: \"The propagandists of Red China and Russia make it apparent that their purpose is to domi- nate all of southeast Asia * * * the so- called rice bowl which helps to feed the densely populated region that extends from India to Japan. It is rich in Inany ra,w materials, such as tin, oil, rubber. and iron ore.\" Unfortunately for the French colonial forces, they placed too many eggs in one basket. 'When that basket-the heavily fortified bastion at Dienbienphu was crushed by the Vietminh on May 7, 1954, the end was in sight. By an agreement of the major powers at Geneva, July 21, 1954, independence from France was granted to Laos, Cambodia. and Vietnam. and the latter was partitioned along the 17th parallel. The northern none, capitaled at Hanoi, went to Ho. The south had a West-oriented native government. A plebiscite was to be held in both zones in July 1956 to determine if the country should be reunified. However, Red-hating Pouth Vietnamese Premier Ngo Dinh Diem flatly refused to believe that the Communists would permit it free vote. Ii-.. July 19115 he virtually eliminated any chance of hold- ing elections, and the country has bee i di- vided ever since. THE WADING GAMI: To prevent further Communist incursions into southeast Asia, the United State: has joined in defensive alliances with Japan, Aus- tralia, the Philippine Republic. New Zea land, Great Britain, France, Pakistan, and Thai- land. This has not prevented the Pathet Lao from taking over half of Laos and forcing the rest to be neutralized. It has not prevented wavering toward communism by Camb,idia's Prince Norodom Sihanouk. It has not pre- vented the Vietcong from wreaking de: truc- tions over all of South Vietnam. 't'he United States has 200,000 troops in Vietnam, and will double that number by year's end. It has the 7th Fleet and heivy air support. It has the aid c, the South Vietnamese Government. Yet it, has not stopped the Vietcong. 'When the Cong is exhausted, it slips back into the rain forest. When it is defeated, it recruits in North Vietnam. When it is hungry, it terrorizes villages When it is ill-equipped, it ships in supplies along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. 'Who remembers the strategic ha!niet? Last year, the United States reverted to the medieval system of fortifying hamlets, ;end- ing the villagers out to work by day, and locking them behind barbed wire at right. Horrified French officials pointed out that Di.enbienphu was no more than a large 'stra- tegic hamlet.\" After losing several villages, the United States conceded, Who remembers the \"advisers\"? Thin was America's title for the 40,000 troops i' had stationed in Vietnam before 1965. Tha'v are now combatants. Who remembers the American p?omi:.a not to bomb in Laos? South Vietnamese Pre- nc.er Nguyen Cao Ky revealed recently that the United States has been doing so for over a, year. All these incidents are indications th; t the war is escalating. The United States is corn- nutted now to war, and war it must fif,ht to the logical end. But, as any physician, will testify, in fighting a disease, one doe!; not treat the symptom; one treats the cause. We must circumvent the symptom - the Vietcong--and strike directly at the ca we- Red China. And we must not stop untI the disease is totally exterminated. \"War is hell,\" remarked Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, and Benjamin Franklin agreed, \"There never was a good war or n bad peace.\" 'Then why are wars fought.? In nron gilt inunediate rejection by Hanoi. R:r.ther, the American proposal would place the Security Council officially in back of a. g}encral search for peace, such as the United :;rates has already, informally, asked the G.N. co undertake. This would include a conference, with the objective of applying the Geneva accords of 1954 and 1962 (the latter concerned Laos) and of setting up and supervising a cease-fire. Composition of the conference is not spelled out; the door re- mains open l or mediation or arbitra Lion, as suggested by Pope Paul. The effect of such a resolution would bring pressure upon the Soviet Union to do what it has thus far refused to do-vsponsor an- other session of the Geneva Conference. It would also, if adopted (or even if accepted by a majority and lose through a Soviet veto) furnish Security Council support for Ameri- can peace efforts. And in any case, by ac- companying the bombs with a resolution, President Johnson dramatizes anew the American position: to fight if necessary; to negotiate if possible. Federal Funds Already Have Aided Many Persons in Volusia County EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. SAM GIBBONS OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTA',:'IVES Monday, February 7, 1966 Mr. GIBBONS. Mr. Speaker I am proud to say that the great :sate of Florida is moving into the vanguard of those States making maximum use of provisions of the Economic Opportunity Act, the war on poverty. I am proud of the tremendous prog- ress being made by the city of Tampa and Hillsborough County which comprise the congressional district which I have the privilege to represent in the House of Representatives. On our east coast, Volusia County is moving forward in several antipoverty programs. 'Inc 'Day- tona Beach News-Journal, one of Flor- ida's great newspapers, is running a se- ries of articles dealing with that coun- Ly's efforts in this battle. The article follows: FEDERAL FUNDS ALREADY IIAva: Asia ii MANY PERSONS IN VOLUSIA COUNTY (By Ray LaPrise) As Project Upgrade officials are struggling to get approval from the Office of Economic Opportunity, Atlanta, on their own applica- tion for working funds and the application from the West Volusia Council on Human Relations, some Federal money to fight poverty already has come into the county. Volusia school officials got a $71,088 grant last summer to operate Head Start This is the project under which 526 5- and 6-year- olds from low-income families throughout the county got kindergarten instruction, medical care and nutritious lunches in 13 schools from June 8 to July 27. As the program went on for tuts, their parents also were invited to attend night meetings at the schools where qualified speakers lectured on such topics as legal aid and how to manage on low budgets The antipoverty program also has been felt through Neighborhood Youth Corps. John Shaw, manager of the local :Florida State Employment Service, said his office was asked to recruit young people-mostly high school. dropouts-by the Florida Park Serv- ice, Florida Forestry Service and Road Department. Shaw, who also serves as chairman of Upgrade's committee on employment, job training and counseling, said 37 young people from this area were hired out of the 61 who applied for Neighborhood Youth Corps since last June. As rnenibcrs of the Neighborhood Youth Corps, they work 32 hours a week and spend another 2 hours a day studying. Among them are eight youths and one girl on duty at Tomoka State Park. Financially handicapped students fat Bethune -Cookman College here and at Stetson University, DeLand, have been en- abled to continue their work because of what is called the work-study program. Bethune- Cookman College got a grant of $18,000 for the spring and summer semesters last year and another grant of $90,000 for the fall 1965 semester and 1966 spring semester. College officials distribute the money to student:, hired for such campus jobs as laboratory and library assistants and dormi- tory supervisors. A number of Stetson students also bene- fited by work-study grants received by the university, including $14,235 for last spring's semester, $40,000, last summer and $22,306 for the 1965 fall semester. Upgrade's present officers are former Day- tona Beach Commissioner Stanley Nass, president; Mrs. Glenn A. Bassett, Daytona Beach, secretary; Volusia School Superin- tendent John Smiley, vice president; and Volusia Juvenile Judge Robert L. Lee, treasurer. Upgrade also has 11 committees, whose chairmen are: Rev. Rogers P. Fair, resident partic:.potion, 15 members; Volusia Health Officer D. V. Galloway, health, 7 members; Florida. State Employment Service Manager John Shaw, employment, job training, and counseling, 5 members; Juvenile Judge Lee, finance, 4 members; Dr.:Harland Merriam, evaluation to programs, 5 members; County Commissioner Smith, governmental, 4 members; Mars.

Lilburn Moseley, consumer education and information, 6 members; and Daytona Beach Attorney Leon van Wert, legal aid, 7 members. Upgrade, until it gets money to rent its own office space, will go on filling out forms and storing its files in Van Wert's office at 136' South Beach Street. Public Land Treatment: Watershed Project Problem EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. COMPTON I. WHITE, JR. OF IDAHO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, Monday, February 7, 1966 Mr. WHIT of Idaho. Mr. Spcakel', I am impressed by the efforts being, made in the State through local soil conserva- tion districts to improve and make better use of our land and water resources. I am particularly interested in the work being done in local watershed projects to reduce flooding, protect lands and. homes, and bring about a brighter economic future. I am concerned that this work move ahead as rapidly as possible. Serious flooding in 1962 and 1964 produced millions of dollars in dar,mages in my State; we need to be better prepared in the future. One problem in watershed progress is potentially of concern in many States where public and private lands are inter- mingled. In several cases, public land agency funds have been insufficient to meet land treatment needs; but projects Approved For Release 2005/06/29 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000400020007-9 February 7., 6?ved For Q4 9R 1 67R$$4 q( 400020007-9 Buffalo's New Urban Renewal Commissioner EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. RICHARD D. McCARTHY OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 24, 1966 Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, my hometown of Buffalo faces all the chal- lenges which other major U.S. metro- politan areas face: the decline of the central commercial core, blight in the gray areas, traffic congestion, a dwin- dling tax base, and so forth. But I am happy to report the city of Buffalo, behind the leadership of Mayor Frank A. Sedita, is tackling these prob- lems with new vigor and determination. A keyman in this great undertaking is our new urban renewal commissioner, Richard L. Miller. I am proud to say that Mr. Miller is an old and close friend of mine. He played a key role in the conception and development of the Buf- falo urban renewal program and he comes to his new post with la,urels won In pushing forward Buffalo's dynamic downtown renewal program. Buffalo is on the move. And young men like 40-year-old Richard Miller are playing key roles. Under leave to extend my remarks, I here. include an article from the Buffalo Courier-Express of January 25, which sets forth Mr. Miller's view of his new and challenging assignment : MILLER TAKES STERN VIEW OF RENEWAL (By Jim McAvey) REALISTIC VISIONS Buffalo's new $17,500 a year urban renewal commissioner, Richard L. Miller, is no builder of castles in the sky. He is a hardheaded pragmatist with visions of a more beautiful city. He believes these visions can be made realities only through the down-to-earth, patient expenditure of energy needed to sail programs over seas of redtape. \"We are going to have to combine our aspirations with realism,\" Miller said. \"There is a lot of redtape to go through and it takes time.\" Just turned 40, the fair-skinned, 6-foot, 200-pound commissioner looks askance on \"miracle working\" urban renewal schemes. OBJECTIVE: CONFIDENCE \"I think Buffalo can be made a greater city, but this job is only part of it,\" he said. \"Urban renewal can only provide the physi- cal setting for living. There are other as- pects-economic, political, social, cultural.\" A native of Buffalo, the blue-eyed Miller has a full head of blond hair that sweeps straight back from a high forehead. He has the broad shoulders and coordinated move- ments of the athlete he was. He gives the impression of being intensely sincere about the job he is undertaking. \"I'm not starting anything,\" Miller said. \"This is a continuing program that has to grow. We have to develop a sound and ex- panding program, one that will gain the confidence of the people of Buffalo and of the Federal Government, which provides most of the money.\" Miller believes most people have a feeling the Federal Government runs the whole ur- ban'renewal program. \"Actually,\" ; he, said, \"the responsibility is on the city. We. have to merit continued Federal support or the Federal Government can put the brake on. Our local perform- ance 1s what counts.\" WELL PRIMED Miller said he is depending on men who have been working in the urban renewal department to brief him on the status of programs. There are 66 employees in the department. But he gave much evidence of having de- tailed knowledge of the programs. He said his work as executive director and secretary of the Greater Buffalo Development Foundation had much to do with his views on urban renewal. He was executive direc- tor of the foundation from May 1958 until he took over his present job January 1. The foundation played a vital role in the planning and promotion of the downtown renewal project. Miller sees the downtown project as an excellent example of what can be brought about without Government funds. CODES, INCENTIVES \"Downtown is showing what we can do on our own,\" he said. \"Part of the deal is for people in official capacities to encourage peo- ple to do something about their environ- ment.,. Miller does not believe that rehabilitation of dilapidated houses and neighborhoods. \"just happens,\" or that enforcement of hous- ing codes is, of itself, enough. \"People have to be convinced that some- thing good is. going to come from their efforts to improve their properties,\" Miller said. \"We must give people incentives, through public actions, to upgrade their properties far beyond minimum standards required by the code.\" FAMILY MAN A 1949 Dartmouth graduate who served in the Navy In World War II and the Korean war, Miller started out to be a newspaper- man. He was a reporter for the Buffalo Evening News in 1951 and again from 1953 to 1958. He smokes a pack a day, golfs, bowls, reads, and spends a lot of time \"amusing my four kids.\" He is married to the former Patrizia Nagy of Toledo, Ohio, a sculptress who has given him \"a great deal of interest in the arts.\" They live at 650 Lafayette Avenue. EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. THOMAS M. PELLY OF WASHINGTON IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 7, 1966 Mr. PELLY. Mr. Speaker, passage of H.R. 12410, the GI education bill, was not only morally right but economically sound for our Government. To provide for the smooth and con- structive return of our servicemen to civilian life is just as essential as it Is to prepare him with needed training and equipment to enable him to do a proper job in the Armed Forces. I venture to say, Mr. Speaker, that this action will pay similar dividends to those realized from the investment in educa- tion, for veterans of World War II and the Korea l conflict. I am sure this assist- ance will account for an increase in our A559 gross. national product as did the invest- ment in the education of veterans of . World War II and Korea. Mr. Speaker, the passage of this legis- lation was long overdue. America Understand/ f EXTENSION OF REMARKS HON. JACK BROOKS OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 7, 1966 Mr. BROOKS. Mr. Speaker, with the resumption of bombing of North Viet- nam there has risen considerable contro- versy in the American press concerning the bombing and the intensified peace efforts that preceded it and are continu- ing. Extensive coverage has been given to a very vocal minority that opposes our efforts to maintain the freedom of the Vietnamese with the result that it is, at times, difficult to determine how the average American views these activities. However, a recent editorial, which ap- peared on February 2, 1966, in the Beau- mont Enterprise, an outstanding news- paper published in southeast Texas, states succinctly the feelings of an over- whelming majority of our citizens who support the President and who under- stand and are aware of our responsibility and purpose in southeast Asia. The text of the editorial follows: A TEXAN DECIDES In spite of our disappointment that the 37-day lull in the bombing of North Vietnam failed to bring peace talks, we feel that the long pause was on the whole a net gain for this country. We have underscored our devotion to a peaceful settlement in Vietnam in a way that neither friend nor foe can misinterpret. We have cut the ground from underneath the feet of those critics in Europe and Asia, who, for varying reasons, have tried to paint us in the colors of aggressors or new colo- nialists. Our reconnaissance has been such that, now that the bombing is being resumed, we know where the enemy troop and supply buildups have taken place and we can hit those places quickly and in great force. Thus, it seems to us that the pause did more good than harm. Given the intransigence of Hanoi and Pei- ping, the negative, churlish and unyielding attitude of the Communists, the President had no choice but to renew the bombing attacks on the enemy's staging grounds in North Vietnam. Be it noted, also, that during the entire period of the bombing pause, there was never the slightest lull in the terrorist tactics of the Vietcong on the ground. Unharmed men, women, and children among civilian refugees were savagely slain, along with American and South Vietnamese soldiers. We are glad that President Johnson made a new Vietnam peace bid, even as he ordered the bombers back into action. The two ac- tions taken together would seem to indicate that we will, in' the words of the late Presi- dent Kennedy; \"never negotiate from fear, but never fear to negotiate.\" It is likely that hard decisions and harder days are ahead for President Johnson and all Approved For Release 2005/06/29 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000400020007-9 Approved For Release 2005/06/29: CIA-RDP67B00446R0004000 07-9 CONGRESSIONAL.

EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. JACOB H. GILBERT + H.' NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 7, 1966 Mr. GILBEH,T. Mr. Speaker, a few days ago I called to the attention of MY colleagues in the House the plight of our merchant marine and expressed dis- appointment and concern over the cut in the 1967 budget funds for this im- portant fourth arm of our country's de- fense. In this connection, I insert in the RECORD a statement by Mr. Joseph Curran, chairman of the AFL-CIO Mari- time Committee, which follows: The budget request for the Maritime Ad- ministration this year is sadly inadequate. It reflects an adoption of the Interagency Maritime Task Force report. This report was rejected by the President's Maritime Advisory Committee. We also understand that this report is opposed by the Secre- taries of Commerce and Labor. Longstanding national policy provides that we shall have a merchant marine to carry a substantial portion of our waterborne import-export foreign commerce, and also capable of serving as a naval auxiliary in time of war or national emergency. To as- sure that our merchant marine would serve the Nation in this dual capacity. various aids such as the operating and construction subsidies are extended to qualified operators. because of the lack of Government lead- ership which reflects indifference and neglect in advancing this policy, our merchant ma- rine has declined to where it carries less than 9 percent of our waterborne foreign commerce. The Secretary of Commerce must have realized the cause of the declining fleet clearly when just recently he stated that he is opposed to building foreign and that the Government has not fulfilled its obligation in building a merchant marine. in realization of the sad state of our mer- chant marine, the President established the Maritime Advisory Committee. At its first meeting. the Maritime Advisory Committee adopted a resolution endorsing our national maritime policy, as stated in the 1936 Mer- chant Marine Act, as in the public interest. Following this, the Committee developed a program, the basic theme of which is the renewal and expansion of the American merchant marine. At the time it became obvious that the Maritime Advisory Committee was going to come up with a program for developing a merchant marine, the Interagency Maritime Task Force was estabished to counter and add confusion to the MAC recommenda- tions. To add to the confusion, the task force, which' contains the Maritime Admin- istrator's recommendations, has advocated less ships to carry less cargo and even these ships to be built principally in foreign yards. This year's budget request of $85 million for construction subsidies ($47 million less than last year) provides for building only 11 ships. This is raised to 13 after some doubtful and very peculiar juggling of fig. ores. The operating-differential subsidy request is $185 million ($5 million less than last year). Members of the House and Senate have expressed their disappointment of the budg- et request. Their course of action to cor- rect the situation is not known at this time. Even If Congress should increase the inade- quate budget request, as its been suggested, it is doubtful that the Administration would use the funds. The Interagency Task Force report and this year's budget request highlight.; the fact that administrative dedication to our Nation's maritime policy is a prerequisite to the successful administration of our mari- time laws. Currently, the Maritime Admin- istration is set on a completely opposite course of action which would administer the merchant marine Out of existence. If this confusion and neglect is not, cor- meted soon, there will be no merchant marine to transfer into the President's proposed Department of Transportation. EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. PRENTISS WALKER OF MISSISSIPPI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 7, 1966 Mr. WALKER of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, the development of foreign trade in the poultry industry is most important for the continued growth of this vital industry in the United States, as well as the contribution it would make toward a more favorable balance-of-pay- ments picture for our country. I call to the attention of my colleagues a news release of the National Broiler Council, an organization dedicated to the growth, development, and improve- rnent of the poultry industry. This news release. dated December 23, 1965, announced participation of Mr. G Ted Cameron, president of the National Broiler Council, and Mr. Frank Frazier, executive vice president, in the U.S. Feed Grain Trade Exhibits and Seminar, scheduled to take place March 7 to 18, 1966, in Tokyo, Japan. Participation in this project by the National Broiler Council I am sure will prove most valuable in the de- velopment of foreign markets for the poultry industry in the United States. The article follows: DECEMBER 23, 1h65. WASHINGTON. D.C.-The appearance of two American broiler industry leaders on the program of the U.S. Feed Grain Trade Ex- hibits and Seminar scheduled for next March 7--18 at the U.S. Trade Center in Tokyo, Japan was announced here this we,,,k by Clarence D. Palnlby, executive vice pre:=.ident of the U.S. Feed Grains Council. Palmby announced that G. Ted Cameron, president of Mountaire Poultry Co., Inc., North Little Rock, Ark., and Frank Frazier, executive vice president of the National Boiler Council, Washington, D.C., will be key participants during various segments of the entire seminar. Cameron is president of the National Broiler Council. In making the announcement, Pnhnby pointed to the timely topics to be presented by each of the broiler industrymen. \"The realm of 'Practical Broiler Production in a Scientific Age' and `The Broiler Busir,ess- Finance, Controls, and Marketing' constitute two papers bearing important messages to be given by Mr. Cameron. He is a true prac- titioner and exemplifies the executive who heads the multiphased operation which comprises a modern broiler firm, and the Far East audience will be especially interested in what he has to say.\" The Feed Grains Council executive em- phasized that the topic Frazier will cover, \"Consumer Information, Market Research, and Market Support Functions of a Com- modity Organization,\" will not only benefit the sponsors of the trade show, but will strengthen market development programs in Japan. \"We were especially glad to receive the re- port that the Broiler Council's board of di- rectors accepted our invitation extended to Frank Frazier,\" stated Palmby who is acting for the various groups cooperating with the Foreign Agricultural Service of USDA in making the arrangements for the Tokyo event. \"We have observed the outstanding job that the National Broiler Council has done during the past several years, and con- sider it a classic example of intelligent self help in molding a production-oriented in- dustry into a hard-hitting, market-oriented group using strong programs in merchandis- ing, research, and consumer education-all to the benefit of both the industry and the general public,\" he added. Palmby noted that the Feed Grains Coun- cil cooperates wherever possible on. worth- while projects that can be of value to groups promoting the export of agricultural prod- ucts. \"We feel the planned trade show, done in cooperation with the American Soy- bean Association, the National Renderers As- sociation, the U.S. Agricultural Attachc's of- fice in Japan, and the International Trade Fairs division of FAS to be one of these ex- tremely worthwhile projects,\" he stated. The announcement from the U.S. Feed Grains Council concluded noting the satis- faction and appreciation of the council's executive when he said, \"Cameron and Frazier, along with the others who will make up the program, insure our efforts in making a positive contribution to our expanding dol- lar sales of an important, interrelated group of American agricultural products to Japan. We certainly are indebted to the National Broiler Council leadership for their coopera- tion.\" EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. L. MENDEL RIVERS OF SOUTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 7, 1966 Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, those of you who know and respect Vice Adm. John S. McCain will be as pleased as I to learn of the outstand- ing tribute paid' to Admiral McCain by our United Nations Ambassador Arthur J. Goldberg. On January 29, the Old Guard of the city of New York honored Admiral and Mrs. McCain. Ambassador and Mrs. Goldberg were unable to attend the ban- quet but the Ambassador sent the follow- ing telegram to the Old Guard Com- mandant. Colonel Rizza: I regret indeed that matters of state over which I have no control will prevent me from being with the Old Guard on Saturday evening, January 29, when you honor my friend and colleague, Vice Adm. John S. Mc- Cain, Jr. I am especially sorry I cannot be present because I have the highest regard for Admiral McCain. Please convey my regrets to the members of the Old Guard.

In August the Repub- lican leader called for a declaration of war. Also In August, Republicans under Mr. FORD'S leadership issued a \"white paper\" on the war charging that Mr. Johnson, in seek- ing a negotiated settlement, \"seemed to dis- card the independence of South Vietnam as an objective\" of the war. But when Congress reconvened this year, Mr. Foan's first newsletter to his constituents i;ook a different tone. \"We will support anything which Mr. John- on does to obtain a prompt, just, and secure ocace,\" he wrote. \"If this can be accom- plished by immediate negotiations through diplomatic, channels, we favor such negotia- tions. it the Commander of Chief finds that Further military action is necessary to achieve freedom and independence for the Viet- namese, we will support such action. Know- ing that there is no substitute for victory, we will back the President in his every effort to achieve military or diplomatic success.\" The concluding word, \"success,\" appeared to observers here to be the key to the state- ment. In effect, the Republican leader was backing Mr. Johnson fully, both diploniati- cally and militarily; but he was also insisting that the Johnson policy produce \"freedom and independence for the Vietnamese.\" Staternents by former Vice President Rich- ard M. Nixon also seem to reflect the develop- ing Republican position. Mr. Nixon con- ferred with Republican Congressmen before appearing on \"Issues and Answers\" on Ameri- can Broadcasting Co. television last Sunday. In that appearance he attacked Democrats who took \"the appeasement line\" but re- frained from direct criticism of Mr. Johnson. HON. J. ARTHUR YOUNGER IF CALIFORNIA IN' iHS HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 'vlonday, February 7, 1966 Mr. YOUNGER. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Jo- seph Alsop has given a very good analysis of the Vietnam war and the changes which have taken place in his column. published in the Washington Post. His column follows: AGAIN, A NEW WAR SAIGON.-Behind all the churning and wal- lowing and tergiversation of American policy in th'..'se last 6 weeks, there is one very simple, bleak fact. The war in Vietnam has been radically transformed, almost to the point of becoming a new war. The last major transformation occurred last suinmer, with the commitment of U.S. ground forces on it big scale. The President's decision to make this commitment was ex- tremely courageous, and the commitment paid :Ill magnificently. largely as a result of Secretary McNamara's reform and modernization of the Armed t0orces, every unit committed was hard trained and combat ready. Green troops fought like veterans. Brilliant victories were won against heavy odds-which will no (10WA surprise a lot of people at home, for we in the United States for some strange reason, were only told about the casualties. ;did not about the victories. Iii consequence, by the beginning of November, \"the Vietcong main forces were nearly on the ropes.\" This summary was given by Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge. His view is shared by just about every other American out here with experience to form a judgment. At this juncture, however, the next transformation of the war began to be evident. Precisely because the American commit- ment threatened to break the fighting strength of the Vietcong main force, as well as the North Vietnamese unite already in South Vietnam, a massive further invasion of South Vietnam by North Vietnamese regu- lars was ordered in Hanoi. The new units swiftly moving in quite naturally upset the whole balance of the war. This lied, in turn, to the exceedingly grim briefing given to Secretary McNamara when * he was last here. The chances are, in truth, that it was much too grim. For example, the North Vietnamese were credited with the capability of laying down 138 icons a day on the South Vietnamese border, via the Ho Chi Minh Trail. This tonnage, of course, would sustain all too many North Vietnamese divisions. In fact, however, if the enemy is currently laying down 60 tons a day oii the border, he is now doing a lot better than the wisest analysts believe. Furthermore, distribution from the border forward to the fighting units of 138 tons a day would require an army of at least 80,000 coolies, who would in turn consume about 65 tons of rice day. Thus there can be little doubt that Secre- tary McNamara was given a n exaggerated picture of the number of additional North Vietnamese units that can be permanently supported in South Vietnam. \"Per- manently\" is the key word, however, for the desperate decision to eat up all the stocks accumulated and cached in the jungles by the Vietcong would, of course, permit a good many additional units to be temporarily supported. And in any case. without regard to future capabilities, the stepped up North Vietnamese invasion of the south had al- ready created a wholly new situation. Secretary McNamara's report on the de- mands of the new situation thereupon touched off the churning and wallowing in U.S. Policy, typified by the peace offensive and the bombing pause. But no amount of wallowing and churning can change the necessities, as the outcome has shown. Three additional divisions. either three American or two American and one South Korea ii, are needed to redress the balance and recapture the initiative enjoyed in October. This increase in General Westmoreland's troop requirement, from six to nine division equivalents, in turn means a requirement for more U.S. troops than can be rapidly pro- vided without calling up the Reserves. For the time being, the President may perhaps think he can escape from meeting General Westmoreland's requirement by one dodge or another. If so, the enemy will soon enough teach him his error. It is far more likely, however, that the President thinks he can meet General West- more.tand's requirement without calling up the Reserves, by using a whole series of clever dodges. For example, all sorts of-specialized troop units, easily obtainable by a callup, are desperately needed to break the logistical logjam. here, without which larger forces cannot easily be supported. But at the cost of some delay, private con- tractors can be hired to attack the logistical logjam. By the same token, the Army's au- thorized troop strength has been greatly in- creased. Ready divisions may therefore be borrowed from the United States, with skeleton divisions taking their place in the Strategic Reserve. But such dodges are dangerous and un- worthy. They mean delay wh%n speed is vital. They mean a further show of irresolu- tion when stern resolve is vital. They mean no margin for the future., when the con- spicuous existence of a margin is vital, Thus Lyndon Johnson's fiber, as a leader of a na- tion at war, is now being put to a supreme test. Where Were a Pickets? Nowhere To Be Seen EXTENSION OF REMARKS HON. MASTON O'NEAL OF GEORGIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 7_1966 Mr. O'NEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, a newspaper in my congressional district has raised a very pertinent and interest- ing question. Where were the antiwar demonstrators last month when the United States undertook its worldwide peace offensive? It is now apparent that the Vietcong, Hanoi, and. other members of the international Commu- nist conspiracy have thumbed their col- lective noses at President Johnson's 37- day bombing pause and his peace mis- sions throughout the world. If the noisy pacifists in America were sincere in their desire for a peaceful set- tlement of the Vietnam conflict, it ap- pears that demonstrations against the Hanoi regime would have been in order. But they are not sincere. As a matter of fact, this is added proof that they are simply disloyal persons intent on em- barrassing America and giving aid, comfort, and political help to our ene- mies. An editorial appearing in the February 1 edition of the Tifton, Ga., Daily Ga- zette, concludes that the Vietniks oper- ate under a double standard. I wholeheartedly concur with the edi- torial which follows: WHERE WERE THE PICKETS? NOWHERE To BE SEEN Any time during the past month would have been an ideal time for a demonstration by the Vietnam war protesters-a demon- stration not against the United States but against the Hanoi regime. It was that long and more since this coun- try first halted bombing raids over North Vietnam. For 4 days during the Vietnamese new year's celebrations our troops main- tained a strictly defensive posture, although the Vietcong's unilateral cease-fire did not include Americans. In the meantime, Presidential peace emis- saries continued to scurry between Wash- ington and a dozen world capitals seeking the diplomatic formula that could lead to an armistice. Why did we not see a march on Washing- ton, or at least a few pickets outside the White House, to dramatize support for these efforts of the Government? Why no mass meetings putting a bit of pressure on the North Vietnamese who, as they themselves said, have been heartened by the activities of peace-loving American students'? Why indeed? The silence of the past weeks has done more than the noisiest demonstration to ex- pose th double standard of the vietniks and to prove the shallowness, naivete, and essen- tial futility of their cause. This is not to charge them with the blame for the failure of the peace offensive. They are not that important, and in any event a demonstration in support of the Govern- ment at this stage would probably have Approved For Release 2005/06/29 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000400020007-9 e~-F lI.5PPgPI'I NWXNM5.F5iB ~.1: APP inn NP5IaiIaaMMW'WIOPPgIWn,M5.

O'Ryan: A Professional Profile EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. GEORGE W. GRIDER OF TENNESSEE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 7, 1966 Mr. GRIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to- day to pay homage to a distinguished citizen of Memphis, Tenn.-Thomas M. O'Ryan, chairman of the board of O'Ryan & Batchelder, Inc., largest tran- sit advertising firm in the United States. Tom O'Ryan's story reads like a chapter from the saga of Horatio Alger. His amazing rise in our free enterprise sys- tem has been the subject of a United Press International success profile, and his career will be the subject of a chapter in a forthcoming book on outstanding American businessmen. Under unanimous consent I insert in the Appendix to the RECORD a profile of this outstanding American and resident of the Ninth Congressional District of Tennessee: PROFESSIONAL PROFILES THOMAS M. O'RYAN, CHAIRMAN, O'RYAN & BATCHELDER, INC. A 19-year-old Irish immigrant named O'Ryan applied for work with a New York section gang in 1932. The job, digging a subway tunnel through Manhattan's bedrock. Thirty years later, a new advertising poster went up in New York subways: \"An O'Ryan & Batchelder Operation.\" It was the same O'Ryan. In the years between, Thomas Michael O'Ryan had become chairman of the Na- tion's largest transit advertising firm. When he was awarded the New York subways ad- vertising franchise In 1962, O'Ryan had pro- gressed from subway laborer to subway ad- vertising czar. His story begins in Ireland. A. PLUSH TIMES ON THE AULD SOD Tom O'Ryan, second of six sons born (in 1912) to Edward O'Ryan and Mary Cusack O'Ryan in Limerick City, Ireland, didn't ex- actly begin life with a silver spoon in his mouth. In 1928, a family financial crisis developed. The elder O'Ryan's business plunged down- ward. Mary O'Ryan decided to make extra money opening a small hotel. Edward O'Ryan's wrath was old fashioned and quite Irish. \"No matter what happens, a woman's place is in the home,\" he raged. The rift grew. Living at home became untenable. B. STREETS PAVED WITH GOLD At 17, Tom O'Ryan booked passage for the United States. With $400 he arrived in New York in Sep- tember 1929, registered at a YMCA, began j obhunting. Within a short time, he was hired as a file clerk at a salary of $27.50 every 2 weeks. Indeed, the streets were paved with gold. One month later, the stock market crashed. Tom O'Ryan was out of a job. The era of wonderful nonsense skidded to a fast stop. In job interview lines, O'Ryan often heard: \"Look at that Irish immigrant taking jobs away from good American citizens.\" Even that traditional Irish haven, the police department, was closed to O'Ryan as a noncitizen. Right then O'Ryan filed citizenship papers. Later, he was awarded citizenship in the minimum time possible. O'Ryan took spot jobs on boats. He worked as a messenger. He even applied as doorman at Radio City Music Hall. \"Sorry,\" the Music Hall's chief of service said. \"You're big-but you're not big enough.\" Would there be an usher's job available? \"You're too big to qualify as an usher,\" the chief said. Size did prove helpful in landing the sub- way tunneling job. Unfortunately, it didn't last long. D. DO IT YOURSELF SALES AND ADVERTISING One day, as a messenger, O'Ryan delivered a package to a company trying to sell a con- signment of damaged men's suits. He volunteered to take on the job, invest- ing his last few dollars in sales brochures describing the suits. Soon he was holding sales meetings during lunch periods, handing out brochures, taking orders. \"Within 20 days, I had sold several hun- dred suits,\" O'Ryan said. E. THE BIG RHUBARB Then, bitten by the free enterprise bug, O'Ryan borrowed $20, rented a horse and wagon for $4 per day. Every morning, at 4 a.m. he would arrive at New York's whole- sale vegetable center, buy a load of produce, then clop-clop over the Brooklyn Bridge to sell it house to house in Flatbush. Often it was 10 p.m. when he reached home. \"On a good day, I made enough to buy food-for the horse,\" O'Ryan said. \"Why not specialize?\" a friend asked. That sounded good. O'Ryan chose rhu- barb. He bought stocks of rhubarb, stored the boxes in his landlady's basement. Unfortunately, the hot-water pipes caused fermentation in the rhubarb. The house took on a most distinctive smell. Pedes- trians began using the other side of the street. O'Ryan's landlady was irate. Only native Gaelic charm-and an. offer to whitewash her cellar free of charge-saved the day. At that time, to the envy of friends, O'Ryan got a full-time job as elevator opera- tor at Saks Department Store. O'Ryan, soon catching the eye of management, was pro- moted to floorwalker. F. BONANZA TO THE SANDWICH ISLANDS From Saks, O'Ryan kept an eye on Wall r' --et. When he heard a brokerage house ~.._s hiring runners, he took the job at pay no higher than his Saks salary. He figured investment opportunity as a side benefit. Soon he was investing a few dollars, then plowing It back. He parlayed his capital into several hundred dollars. When he had ac- cumulated close to $5,000, his longtime dream of a tropical island became stranger. Why not go to the island paradise-Hawaii? He quit his job and booked passage. In Hawaii, he became restless. He started teaching school part time. Money dwindled steadily. When he got down to passage money, he sailed for San Francisco. He then crossed the continent in his entire fortune: a secondhand car with Hawaiian plates. \"I soon realized I could have gone to Hawaii and invested my money at the same time,\" he said. \"I made a mistake: living off capital. I never did that again.\" A553 In 1936, he returned to Saks 34th Street store-broke, tanned,, wiser. By 1937, Saks had promoted O'Ryan to assistant to dress buyer at $75 per week. 0. ENTER: TRANSIT ADVERTISING Back in 1890, Tennessee's Barron G. Col- lier started selling streetcar ads In Memphis. By the time O'Ryan went to Saks, Collier was selling and servicing transit advertising throughout the United States. In 1938, O'Ryan heard Collier was hiring salesmen in New York. He applied. The sales manager raised his eyebrows at the lusty Irish brogue. \"Ever sell transit advertising?\" \"No.\" \"Look, fellow, we're turning down ex- perienced salesmen,\" the manager said. \"What makes you think you can do it?\" \"I'm willing to work,\" said O'Ryan, turning red. \"If I don't sell anything, don't pay me. Try me and see.\" If a man offered to pay his own expenses, he must have confidence, at least. \"You're on,\" he told O'Ryan. \"Twenty- five dollars per week draw.\" O'Ryan joined several new men in for training. Then Collier announced out-of- town territories. O'Ryan was told: \"Your territory is Georgia and the Caro- linas. You leave tonight.\" Although he'd never been south, O'Ryan suspected a greenhorn Irishman would not be particularly welcome. However, admit- ting defeat was not within O'Ryan's char- acter. He caught a train. H. IRISHMAN IN GEORGIA O'Ryan will never forget his first pros- pect-Craig's Honey Bread-in Columbus, Ga. \"Young man, we've never used your ad- vertising, and we don't intend to start now,\" the baker told him. O'Ryan went back Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. No sale. On Satur- day, he took a new tack. \"I've been taught to answer all sorts of objections,\" he said, spreading his literature on the table. \"Anything you ask I can find- even if I don't know the answer.\" The baker sighed, \"Looks like I'm going to have to have it. Better sign me up. O'Ryan said later, \"I think he bought so he could close shop and go home. But it gave me a big lift. After that, I started selling.\" And sell he did. In 1938, O'Ryan ranked No. 1 in the Nation among Collier salesmen in bringing in 5-year contracts-the longest term sold. In 1939, O'Ryan's outstanding sales record won him promotion to Collier district manager for Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas. 1. OUT OF TRAGEDY, NEW OPPORTUNITY In 1940, shortly after founder Collier's death, the organization went bankrupt. Funds from the advertising business had financed disastrous real estate ventures. O'Ryan joined a newly organized nation- wide firm-National Transitads. He became southern division manager in 1942. When he became a vice president in 1944, he moved to Memphis, his home and business headquar- ters since. In the meantime, he made per- manent contributions to the transit adver- tising field- In Oklahoma City when all Interior transit space was sold, O'Ryan developed the first exterior bus poster. (Exterior transit ads had been carried by streetcars. This was the first exterior bus poster.) Today, 65.9 per- cent of transit's volume comes from exterior vehicle posters. O'Ryan expanded the exterior poster into the prototype of today's king-size poster- the mass display panel seen today on buses throughout the United States. O'Ryan organized and served as first dean of National Transitdds new sales school. Approved For Release 2005/06/29 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000400020007-9 Approve~8K, 1 =RC,PP 6R000409pA1P9M, 7, 1966 .1.
