        "text": "THE VIRGINIAN-PILOT Copyright (c) 1996, Landmark Communications, Inc. DATE: Wednesday, September 4, 1996 TAG: 9608310155 SECTION: VIRGINIA BEACH BEACON PAGE: 03 EDITION: FINAL TYPE: CLOSE-UP LENGTH: 82 lines\n\nBLACKHAWK WALTERS: FIREFIGHTER, KARATE INSTRUCTOR\n\nBlackhawk Walters wears many hats - from a bright yellow helmet to a feathered headdress. His passions vary from fighting fires to acting to karate.\n\nAn American Indian, he is a Virginia Beach fireman, holds a seventh degree black belt and is the U.S. Middleweight Kick-boxing Champion. If that isn't enough, he produced, directed and starred in ``A Comanche's Sacred Love,'' a play he and his wife, Dina Mason-Walters, wrote about Quanah Parker, a Comanche warrior.\n\nWalters has been with the Fire Department 19 years as a professional fire fighter and is presently negotiating for a TV pilot to be produced.\n\nFull name: Bubba Blackhawk Walters\n\nHometown: Legend says my grandfather found me under a rock in Tuskahoma, Okla., and carried me in his medicine bag until it was my time to appear on the earth plane. I call Hampton Roads my hometown.\n\nWhat brought you to the Beach? One of my best friends, Chief Larry McInnis, convinced me to join the Virginia Beach Fire Department.\n\nBirthdate: When I was single I let women guess the date of birth. They would guess 1971, 1961 and 1951. They were always correct! I am told the day was March 19.\n\nOccupation: Master firefighter, karate instructor at Blackhawk Kick-Boxing and an actor.\n\nNickname: Champ and Hawk.\n\nMarital status: Married a beautiful actress May 25, 1996 - Dina Mason-Walters. My soul mate.\n\nChildren: One beautiful cat that I love like a daughter. Symbalina White-Paws, age 9.\n\nWhat is your idea of a perfect day off? To meet one of my best friends Dean Tribbett at the gym and lift weights then go for a 20-mile bike ride alone. Then to pack up the Harley and my wife, to take a nice long ride and find a cozy bed and breakfast for dinner and romance.\n\nLast smart thing you did: Played the part of Chief Quanah Parker in the play ``A Comanche's Sacred Love.''\n\nLast dumb thing you did: Rode my bicycle across the United States in 30 days.\n\nFavorite meal: Fried okra, mashed potatoes, sweet peas, fried squash, onions and strawberries for dessert.\n\nFavorite movies: ``Legends of the Fall,'' ``Last of the Mohicans'' and ``Big Trouble in Little China.''\n\nFavorite song: Anything by Travis Tritt and Little Texas.\n\nLast book read: I always read two books at a time. Keith Fournier's ``And Nothing but the Truth'' and Russell Means' ``Where White Men Fear to Tread.''\n\nHobbies: Native American storytelling and dancing, karate, bicycling, the Harley and weightlifting.\n\nIf you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be? To have been a heavyweight fighter at 6-feet-2-inches and 225 pounds, instead of a middleweight at 5-feet-9-inches and 160 pounds.\n\nIf you could change one thing about your spouse, what would it be? That she would have fallen in love with me 10 years sooner.\n\nSecret vice: I love to spend time completely alone to think and meditate.\n\nFavorite restaurant: Cara's Restaurant in Great Bridge.\n\nYour favorite night on the town: An early dinner at Cara's and a play at the Little Theatre of Virginia Beach followed by a romantic walk on the beach with my beautiful wife Dina.\n\nFavorite TV shows: I don't watch much TV, but if time allows I try to catch ``Northern Exposure'' reruns.\n\nFavorite sport: Most people now consider karate a sport but to me it is so much more. It is an art form, a physical discipline, a window to the soul.\n\nLast vacation: My best friend for the last 30 years, Randy Dockery, and I took a three-week vacation and rode our Harleys across the United States.\n\nWorst job: Never had one. My grandfather taught me there's only two ways to be happy about working - learn to love what you do or do what you love.\n\nOf what achievements are you most proud? I kept my vow to my grandfather to do the ``Sacred Red Earth Ceremony.'' It took me 26 years. I had to face lots of obstacles, hostilities and prejudice. Upon completion in July 1994 my road has been on the spiritual path and now my elders have directed me to teach others: ``We're all related - we belong to one tribe, one race - the human race and if we don't save our mother the earth not only will she die but the human race will die with her.''\n\nWhat would you like as your epitaph? Don't be dismayed at goodbyes. A farewell is necessary before we can meet again. And meeting again after moments or lifetimes, is certain for those who are friends. ILLUSTRATION: Staff photo by D.
