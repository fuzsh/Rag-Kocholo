        "text": "News : Wilson completed eight of 10 passes for 47 yards in Saturday's 9-3 preseason loss to the Bills.\n\nSpin : Wilson's stat line was underwhelming, but it overstates how well Pittsburgh's first-team offense was able to move the ball. That wasn't necessarily on Wilson, as he was under constant pressure and sacked three times. He narrowly missed out on connecting with George Pickens near Buffalo's goal line on his final drive of the game, though the duo's rapport may be lacking after Wilson missed a significant amount of training camp with a calf injury. The Steelers have consistently stated that Wilson is the starting quarterback heading into the season, though this performance didn't do him any favors in his competition with Justin Fields."
