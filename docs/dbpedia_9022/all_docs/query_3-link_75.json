        "text": "The Buffalo Bills certainly had an interesting off-season. While the team still expects to compete for a championship, many around the league can’t ignore the massive losses they suffered this off-season. Most notably Jordan Poyer, Micah Hyde, and Stefon Diggs.\n\nThe Bills haven’t taken any significant measures to fill these holes, but one trade would change that.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills Land Elite Talent In Trade Proposal\n\nESPN’s Seth Walder doesn’t think Adams will stay with the Raiders long-term. As part of his proposal, Adams would be traded to the Buffalo Bills for a second-round pick in 2025:\n\n“Adams is 31 years old and due to make only $17.5 million in cash this season,” Walder wrote in an August 7 column. “He’ll not only be older next year (and might be showing some initial signs of decline), but he’ll also be scheduled to make $36.25 million at that point. If the Raiders don’t deal Adams before the trade deadline this year, they might never be able to trade him.\n\n“The rational move would have been to do this last year or earlier this offseason, but there’s still time for the Raiders to salvage value from Adams. They should move him now for draft capital that will help the team down the road, even though Adams’ trade value has already regressed a bit.”\n\nThe Raiders have been adamant on not trading Adams ever since he arrived during the 2022 off-season. However, some analysts think that if the Raiders aren’t competitive by the trade deadline, the front office could explore trades for the future of the team.\n\nFor More Of My Content"
