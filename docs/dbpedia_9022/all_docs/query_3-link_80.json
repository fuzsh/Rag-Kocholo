        "text": "People with non-hereditary hair loss may be sacrificing their precious locks for simple lifestyle choices that could be easily avoided. Amid Hair Loss Awareness Month, Phil Day, the superintendent pharmacist at Pharmacy2U, shared how stress, nutrition, and fashion choices could be eroding your hair health.\n\nStarting off on a common mistake many people make, Day urged people to find their correct hat size. He explained: “Wearing tight hats can pull on the hair causing ‘traction alopecia’ which is hair loss caused by constant pulling of the hair, causing tension and stress on the hair and its follicle leading to hair falling out.”\n\nWearing looser headgear should rectify this hair loss if you’ve caught it early enough, according to the expert. Similarly, he also warned against tense hairstyles like top knots and ponytails. He advised: “It’s best to avoid hairstyles that pull on the hair too tightly, and if you are tying your hair up to tie it loosely.”\n\nStress can also play a major factor in hair loss, and not just from pulling it out in the midst of a crisis, as Day pointed out research has proven the impact stress has on hair growth. He urged it may be time to “seek help” with your unmanageable stress if it's causing hair loss.\n\nThe expert encouraged people to manage their stress by ensuring they have enough sleep, eat a balanced diet, cut down on alcohol and smoking and exercise regularly. Nutrition in general was another one of Day’s lifestyle choices impacting hair loss as he highlighted vitamins riboflavin, biotin, folate, and vitamin B12.\n\nDeficiencies in these vitamins, which can be found in eggs, leafy greens and meat, have a proven connection to hair loss. Using supplements can be an effective way to ensure you’re getting all the ideal vitamins and Day particularly noted vegans specifically should look at vitamin B12, which is usually found in animal food and products.\n\nLastly, Day noted that hormone changes can majorly affect hair thinning, growth and loss. Although there are not many lifestyle changes that can shift these enough to negate the effects, the expert said: “Women going through pregnancy or menopause, when their hormones are at different levels than usual, should especially look out for thinning hair or hair loss and seek help from a healthcare professional to discuss the best treatment.”\n\nWith up to half of men and women experiencing genetic hair loss in their lifetime, preventing and stalling the loss of their locks has become a priority for many. While genetically induced follicle issues will start becoming visible in your 30s, or even earlier for some, the sooner people address it, the higher their chances of halting or reversing the damage.\n\nThe pharmacist added: “Hair loss affects many people and can cause distress that affects a person’s self-image. It’s common to lose between 50 and 100 strands of hair a day, but if you’re losing more hair than usual or noticing thinning then please speak to your GP who will be able to help.”"
