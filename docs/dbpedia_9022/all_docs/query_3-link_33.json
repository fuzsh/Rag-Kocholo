        "text": "Windham Hill Records Sampler ’82\n\nSelections from the Windham Hill Records Album Catalogue\n\nReview\n\nWindham Hill was truly hitting its stride in 1981-82. It took four years for Ackerman to release the first nine Windham Hill Albums, and of those, only six remained in print. Numbers 14-23 came in just over a single year, and each became a defining album for the label – either the first release of important new artists such as Liz Story, or genre-establishing discs like Alex de Grassi’s Clockwork. Sampler ’82 excises one track from each of the nine discs that Windham Hill released since the initial sampler came out in 1981.\n\nSide One opens with the rather somber “Remedios” and continues in a generally solemn vein throughout the side, with Hedges’ “The Happy Couple” being the happy exception. Side Two picks things up a bit, and ends with the upbeat “Clockwork,” an ensemble piece which will be familiar to any Windham fan today thanks to its appearance on countless samplers since its initial release.\n\nAckerman was enraptured with the new digital technology of the time – his album Passage was one of the first commercial digital releases in the world. Each of the tracks here were remastered in digital – at some expense to the dynamics, detail and warmth of each of the recordings. Indeed, only “The Happy Couple” benefits from the increased detail and brightness of the remastering. Nonetheless, unless you’re a die-hard vinyl fan with a revealing system, the sound quality is still excellent.\n\nIn the end, I’m sure Sampler ’82 has its fans – it was the first introduction to many of these artists for many tens of thousands of people. However, the album is a broad overview rather than a cohesive statement of where the label was at the time, and each of the albums represented are strong and complete on their own. Nonetheless, while I do hesitate to second-guess Ackerman’s selections, for the modern listener, I would recommend you skip this one and buy the individual albums from the era. Sampler ’82 is an important snapshot of Windham Hill’s development, but not necessarily the place to start as a listener.\n\nTrack Listing\n\nSide One:\n\nRemedios 5:46\n\nWilliam Ackerman\n\nPassage C-1014\n\nWindham Hill Music BMI\n\nProduced by William Ackerman\n\nBlossom/Meadow 4:04\n\nGeorge Winston\n\nWinter into Spring C-1019\n\nWindham Hill Music BMI\n\nProduced by George Winston and William Ackerman\n\nThe Happy Couple 3:20\n\nMichael Hedges\n\nBreakfast in the Field C-1017\n\nMichael Hedges Music BMI\n\nAdministered by Windham Hill Music BMI\n\nProduced by William Ackerman\n\nMinou’s Waltz\n\nIra Stein & Russel Walder\n\nElements C-1020\n\nWindham Hill Music BMI\n\nProduced by William Ackerman\n\nA Thousand Teardrops\n\nShadowfax\n\nShadowfax C-1022\n\nGreenshadow Music BMI\n\nAdministered by Windham Hill Music BMI\n\nProduced by Chuck Greenberg\n\nSide Two:\n\nWedding Rain 5:44\n\nLiz Story\n\nSolid Colors C-1023\n\nWindham Hill Music BMI\n\nProduced by William Ackerman\n\nTideline 4:34\n\nDarol Anger & Barbara Higbie\n\nTideline C-1021\n\nSlow Baby Music BMI\n\nAdministered by Windham Hill Music BMI\n\nProduced by Darol Anger\n\nPurple Mountain 5:29\n\nScott Cossu\n\nWind Dance C-1016\n\nSilver Crow Music BMI\n\nAdministered by Windham Hill Music BMI\n\nProduced by George Winston\n\nClockwork\n\nAlex de Grassi\n\nClockwork C-1018\n\nTropo Music BMI\n\nAdministered by Windham Hill Music BMI\n\nProduced by Alex de Grassi\n\nLiner Notes\n\nDigital Transfers, Editing and Mastering by Jack Hunt, JVC Cutting Ctr., Hollywood, CA\n\nCover Photo by Tom Szalay\n\nDesign by William and Anne Ackerman\n\nManufactured by Windham Hill Records\n\nA Division of Windham Hill Productions Inc.\n\nBox 9388 Stanford, CA 94305\n\n(c) (p) Windham Hill Records 1982\n\nAll of the recordings included in the Windham Hill Sampler ’82 are thirty inches per second, no noise reduction analog masters with the exception of “Remedios” which is a digital recording.

Energetic, even upbeat moments abound, but the overall mood is warm, wistful, and well-paced with a real sense of rhythm and flow from one moment to the next.\n\n“Elements” is the recording debut for both Ira Stein and Russel Walder, and the twentieth album released on Windham Hill Records.\n\nStein’s playing is remarkable throughout, with both a solid command and a light touch on his instrument – with moments that remind one of the percolating playing of fellow Bay Area pianist Vince Guaraldi. Stein also composed all the tracks. More than most Windham Hill albums, “Elements” feels like jazz – the players so imbue their parts with feeling that each note sounds as if it could only be conceived in the moment.\n\nWalder had been training with some of the shining lights in modern acoustic music – Paul McCandles and Ralph Towner, and his training and own personal magic are apparent. Under lesser skills, the 0boe can become grating with its high piercing tone. Here, Walder’s tone and touch give us playing that is sweet, yet complex, almost mimicking a human voice more like a tenor sax than an oboe.\n\nI recently traded e-mails with Walder, and he shared some thoughts on his Windham Hill releases:\n\n“Elements and Transit came at the very beginning of my career. It was a very exciting time in music and for me personally. Windham Hill was the magic door to everything that has happened since. I recently returned from a music tour to Spain and I remember going there with Windham Hill and it was a circle that completed itself. I also just came back from a tour of India with my new band and it was the first time since Windham Hill that I have have played in anything other than as a soloist.”\n\nWalder has recorded a significant body of work, and fans of “Transit” in particular should check out his album “Rise,” available at Walder’s current sites:\n\nwww.nomadsoulrecords.com\n\nhttp://www.cdbaby.com/cd/russelwalder\n\nAs part of the overall Windham Hill vision of 1982, “Elements” shares more than a little DNA with Darol Anger and Barbara Higbie’s “Tideline,” released immediately after this. Both albums are central to the reasons I love Windham Hill music, although over the years, I find myself reaching for the glorious “Transit” over this release. No slur on “Elements,” it’s just that “Transit” is a masterpiece. Similarly, I sometimes play “Birth of the Cool” by Miles Davis. But more often than not, I’ll reach for “Kind of Blue” first.\n\nRecommended.\n\n“Keyboardist Ira Stein and oboist Russel Walder met in 1981 at a series of master classes taught at the Naropa Institute by two of their major influences, Ralph Towner and Paul McCandless. Shortly thereafter, Stein And Walder produced a demo and were signed to Windham Hill. Over the years, their sound has expanded from the acoustic duets of their 1982 debut, Elements, to a satisfying blend of electronic keyboards, drums, bass, and intricate studio enhancements.”\n\n~ Linda Kohanov, All Music Guide\n\nWalder was born and raised in Deerfield, Illinois. Following his graduation from Deerfield High School, he briefly attended the University of Arizona in Tucson Arizona.\n\nHe then also attended The Boston Conservatory of Music, and The California Institute of the Arts.[1] He also studied privately with teachers at The New England Conservatory of Music. At age 17 he toured Europe and North American with the United States Youth Symphony appearing in Carnegie Hall and Royal Albert Hall among many notable venues. Walder came onto the contemporary jazz instrumental scene quickly in 1982, at the age of 19, after joining Windham Hill Records and then recording Elements with pianist Ira Stein. The pair met at Naropa Institute while studying with the jazz fusion group Oregon. Walder also studied with Oregon Jazz legend Paul McCandles. After the success of Elements, Walders next recording, 1986’s Transit, again with Stein, also included performances by Bruce Hornsby and mixing by Mark Isham.\n\n~ Wikipedia biography for Russel Walder\n\nComments\n\nHave a thought, memory or experience to share about this album or any of the musicians?
