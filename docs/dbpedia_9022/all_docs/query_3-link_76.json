        "text": "The Pittsburgh Steelers open their preseason vs. The Houston Texans in a game where they’re 1-point favorites, a pick ‘em, or 1.5-point underdogs, depending where you shop. The total is set at 37.5. Last year, Pittsburgh finished the preseason 3-0 SU and won every contest by at least 10 points. The Texans were 2-1 SU in the preseason last year thanks in part to QB Davis Mills, who went 10-for-13 with 102 yards and a TD in the Texan 21-17 loss to the Chicago Bears in the Hall of Fame Game last week.\n\nOn Monday, Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said he plans to play his starters for a portion of this game and it’s currently unclear if the Steelers will be doing the same. All eyes will be on the chemistry between Houston QB C.J. Stroud and his new toy - WR Stefon Diggs - who was acquired from Buffalo.\n\nSteelers vs Texans Odds\n\nSteelers Vs Texans Picks – Preseason Week 1\n\nAs references above, the total is 37.5 which is very low compared to a regular season game, but somewhat high for a preseason contest. I’m opting for a 6-point, 2-team teaser and teasing the total down so I can grab OVER 31.5 and the Steelers +7.5. Always shop around for the best price on teasers because each sportsbook is different.\n\nI’m expecting the Texans offense to be sharp because their backups already have a game under their belt and we know the starters will play a bit in the first quarter as well. Even with that said, I’m taking the Steelers side of this teaser because Mike Tomlin doesn’t mess around in the preseason. While Baltimore coach John Harbaugh gets all the love in the media this time of year for his preseason success, Tomlin deserves some too. In fact, since 2017 the Steelers have never lost more than one preseason game with Tomlin at the helm and they’re 9-1 SU in their last 10 contests. That track record with a 7.5-point cushion feels comfortable, even without knowing how much Pittsburgh starters will play.\n\nWhile it’s not confirmed who will take snaps at quarterback for Pittsburgh, it’d make sense to see Justin Fields under center while Russell Wilson is banged up. If Fields is showcased, we can expect he’ll be strongly motivated while he makes the case that he’s still a starting QB and can lead this team. The Texans have capable backup QBs in Case Keenum and Davis Mills who can both improvise if things break down on the offensive line, which they often do in the preseason.\n\nTheoretically, teasers are more effective in game with lower totals, which is why I lean heavily on them in the preseason.\n\nSteelers vs Texans Preseason Week 1 pick: 2T, 6P Teaser: Steelers +7.5, Over 31.5 (-120)"
