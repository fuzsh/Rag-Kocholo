        "text": "A gran's 'paranoid' hunt for spiders in her bedroom every night didn't stop one from sinking its fangs into her - leaving her with a gaping hole in her stomach that nearly killed her. Karen Ashmore feels lucky to be alive after she was unknowingly bitten by a spider last month, which later developed into sepsis.\n\nThe 56-year-old believes she may have been targeted by the arachnid while hanging out her washing or gardening outside. The mum-of-four, who lives in Dukinfield, initially believed the bite was a heat rash or acne spot before the mark began feeling 'sore and itchy'.\n\nWhen her skin started flaking around the edges, Karen decided to visit her pharmacist who informed her she'd been bitten by an eight-legged creature - and to go to hospital if the bite didn't improve. Days later the grandma-of-ten's stomach began swelling, prompting Karen to rush to A&E where tests revealed she had sepsis.\n\nREAD NEXT: Two arrested after police assaulted during violent disorder after protest outside hotel in Manchester\n\nThe spider bite's venom had also caused an abscess to appear in Karen's stomach that urgently needed removing with surgery. Luckily Karen made a full recovery - but is now warning others about Britain's seemingly harmless arachnids.\n\nKaren said: \"I was obsessed with spiders before all this happened. I was always shaking my bedding before I went to bed to make sure there wasn't any in there.\n\n\"I'm not scared about them, but I'm a bit paranoid of them in the house. I had just had a shower and noticed I had a spot on my stomach. It was only the size of a drawing pin. As the week went on, it just started getting sore and itchy so I put some cream on.\n\n\"But then my skin was coming off around the edges so I knew something wasn't right. I didn't know what had happened, I just saw a red spot.\n\n\"I went to the chemist and they said it looks like a spider bite. They gave me antihistamine cream and tablets and said if it's no different in three days, go to the hospital. But the circle around the bite was getting bigger and my stomach was swelling.\"\n\nKaren rushed to hospital, where she was told the spider venom had caused an abscess in her stomach - and she was currently fighting sepsis. The mum underwent emergency surgery to cut out a chunk of her stomach where the spider had sunk in its fangs.\n\nKaren said: \"They said at the hospital that it's turned into sepsis and turned into an abscess. They said it's swollen that much, it needs cutting out.\n\n\"It was very painful. I didn't know what to think. I went in at 8am the next day for emergency surgery. They wanted to cut the abscess out. It was as big as a Â£1 coin and the hole I was left with was about two centimetres deep.\"\n\nKaren was left with an open wound after the operation and will have to wait for the skin to grow over for the area to be fully healed.\n\nKaren said: \"I was told my skin will always be very, very, thin there. It's left me scarred for life.\n\n\"I thought this was an acne or heat spot, I didn't think anything of it. I never found out what type of spider it was. You could see where it had put its fangs in.\n\n\"I don't know where it's come from. It could've been on the washing when I brought the washing in or I could've been bitten when I was in the garden cleaning.\"\n\nKaren is now urging others to always seek medical help if they see a suspicious new spot on their body.\n\nKaren said: \"I never thought a spider could cause this sort of damage. Sepsis is deadly. I could've easily lost my life. They said it was serious.\n\n\"I'm paranoid now [since the bite] about all creepy-crawlies. I'm checking all the nooks and crannies in the house now.\n\n\"I would encourage anyone else to go to the doctors as soon as they can if they see a new spot on them. I regret not going sooner.\""
