        "text": "Aurio Corrá, I started my piano studies at the age of four. At eighteen years of age I was educated in classical music at the Sao Paulo Conservatory. Later, I dedicated my atttention to the study of Jazz and contemporary music. I studied the viola and later I moved on to the guitar. In 2001 I started to study the soprano saxophone, influenced by the sound of Paul Winter, and with Ivan Meyer as my teacher, continuing until 2003. From here I started to teach myself how to play woodwind instruments. I released my first New Age piece of music in 1988 called 'Aura', with the participation of the harpist María Tereza Briamonte, and the production help of Luiz Antonio Gasperetto, I currently have 17 titles released in Brazil and some of them abroad with the American label Alcione. I dedicated my time to the study of musical technology in 1990, taking my first steps in the area of recording, mixing and digital remastering, the use of samplers, I.T applied to music and virtual intruments.\n\nI discovered New Age music in 1978, and ever since I have studied the style as an investigation of the energetic influences of the sounds of the human being. Currently I am working exclusivley on my study of discovering new musical alternatives which could help to improve our quality of life, creating environments and perfectioning recording techniques, but always with the open-mindedness of the spirit of evolution of New Age music.\n\nI am a lover of all types of music. I have approximatley 5000 discs, of which 3000 are New Age and World Music. The rest are divided between contemporary classical music and barroque, which continue being the base of my studies and, of course, progresive sound, modern jazz and a lot of jazz rock, mostly from the 70's and 80's. I still have my love of imported vinyl discs, of which I have more than a thousand titles, specially chosen and carefully stored.\n\nIn Parallel to my music, for the last thirty five years I have studied oriental spiritualist philosophies including Buddism, Tibetan and some lines of contemporary psychoanalysis. My favourite authors are Krishnamurti, Ken Wilber, Allan Wats, Fritz Pears, Alexander Lower, Eric Fromm, Robert Power, Dalai Lama, Kardec, Herculano Pires and the psychologist, Gestalt.\n\nI practice Tai-Chi, (I was a student of the master Liu Pai Lin) and Vipasana meditation.\n\nOnly when we have total consciousness of breathing, we are present, otherwise we go into the past to search for continuity or we go to an imaginary future which could change us. If we could do anything for ourselves in the present, here and now, this is the only pure state of meditation.\n\nMusic has taught me to persevere, days, months, years of studying betwen four walls. This practice made me discover that you need very little to live when you have something that you truly love. This vision made it possible to see my wishes clearly, which freed me of all anxiety. It was this state which magically opened the road to my composing and creation.\n\nSome of the contemporary musicians and composers that I like and which have influenced me are: the composer Arvo Part, the pianists Keith Jarret, Chick Corea, George Winston, David lanz, Carla Bley, the saxaphone player Jan Garbarek, the multi-instrument musician David Arkenstone, the keyboard player Karunesh, the 2002 duo, which has a divine sound, the keyboard player Constance Demby with his cosmic music, the oboe musician Russel Walder and Nancy Rumbel, Peter Sterling's magic harp, the space music of Jonn Serrie, David Helpling, the mantra of Patrick Bernard and the Japanese maestro Kitaro and many more which are too many to list.\n\nIf I was asked what New Age music was, I would say that it was the biggest tool that I have found in life.\n\nMuita paz e luz a todos vocês.\n\nTranslated by Louis 'Woody' Digwood\n\nDiscography:\n\nAura\n\nAlcatrazes\n\nCaminhos De Santiago\n\nChroma\n\nDeuses Esquecidos\n\nDos Confins Do Ceu\n\nEncantos Opus II\n\nGaia\n\nImagens\n\nLaize Om\n\nLuzes\n\nQuietude\n\nReiki, The Healing Hands\n\nReiki II\n\nReincarnation\n\nSolo Sagrado"
