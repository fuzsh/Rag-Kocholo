A recently opened theatre in Kingsland looks set to offer innovative artists a performance space in a city woefully short of small to medium sized venues.

Le Mata Theatre launches its Sound Shapes season with performances by avant-garde oboe player Russel Walder, who presents his Power Spot performance on September 17.

Describing itself as "a home for people who work in various art forms which have performance dimensions," Le Mata has already seen productions by Denmark's Odin Theatre (The Castle of Holstebro), dance workshops by Black Grace, and the New Zealand Noh Company's production of The Dazzling Night.

It has also been used as a rehearsal space for Shona McCullagh's production of Mad Angels with Douglas Wright.

The conversion of the factory in Central Rd has now been completed and the Sound Shapes series will run until two sculpture installation (with dance and music) in early November.

But opening the series will be the performances by Walder, a Grammy nominated oboist who has recorded for the Windham Hill and Narada record labels in the United States, and studied with members of the jazz group Oregon.

Walder's appearance at this year's Womad festival brought his ethereal and penetrating music to an Auckland audience when he layered his oboe playing over soundbeds of pre-recorded drones.

Other performances in the Sound Shapes series include a video, voice and sonic landscape production by Tabatha Forbes (October 1, 2); Tibetan chanting and trance music by Peter Haeder (October 8, 9); and a dance performance by Peter Ta'ouma (October 29, 30.)

With 18 artists - soloists and small groups - in an eight-week period, Le Mata Theatre is boldly launching itself into the life of the city as a self-avowed alternative venue for arts in performance.
