        "text": "Flight time: 10 hours\n\nWhen to go: December–April\n\nAverage winter temperature: 28°C\n\nThere is no bad time to go to the Maldives. There is nothing bad about going to the Maldives at any time ever. They are perfect little islands, whichever you choose – tiny castaway-fantasy sandy islets, mostly with one immaculate resort, with various levels of splendidness. Even people who think they will get bored in the Maldives end up loving the Maldives. They're family-friendly, and for blissed-out beachy nirvana, they're hard to beat. And they're at their best during the British winter and a quite do-able 10 hours away.\n\nWhere to stay: Families will love Soneva Jani, a tropical never-never land where guests trail about the jungly interiors on push-bikes, throwing themselves down slides into iridescent waters and hiding away in The Den, a fantastical kids’ club of dreams that’s the largest in South Asia. Newcomer to the region Six Senses Kanuhura has quickly become a popular haunt for those wanting to eat well, exercise, learn something new and snuggle up close to nature. See more of the best hotels in the Maldives\n\nFlight time: 4 hours 30 minutes from London\n\nWhen to go: March–May; October–November\n\nAverage winter temperature: 22°C\n\nThe eastern Mediterranean Sea around Cyprus may be chilly in winter, but the island gets plenty of sunshine all year, so there's a good chance you'll get T-shirt weather even in the coldest months. From March, the island's flowers start to bloom, and there's barely another visitor in sight. It's a great option for families too as it's only a short hop from the UK and there are plenty of child-friendly hotels once you're there.\n\nWhere to stay: Check in to Cap St George, where kids can roam free and explore the onsite horse ranch, head off on catch-and-eat fishing boat excursions and watch the latest Disney movie at the open-air cinema. Another prized address is Anassa in Latchi, where its elegant series of white buildings is particularly beloved for its multigenerational appeal thanks to a super slick kid's club and effortlessly chic adult-only spaces. For a child-free stay, adults-only Amavi is a glossy beachside bolthole with a fantastic rooftop sushi restaurant. For more, see our pick of the best hotels in Cyprus.\n\nFlight time: 7 hours from London\n\nWhen to go: November–March\n\nAverage winter temperature: 26°C\n\nFor year-round sunshine, spotless beaches and impeccable service a short hop away, Dubai is an obvious choice. The Palm, a manmade sweep of beaches packed with superb hotels, each with its own immaculate patch of beach, is perfect for family holidays. It's not all glass and shopping malls in Downtown Dubai: the Old Souk is a warren of glittering jewellery and pots, and the peaceful Dubai Creek hints at a time before the seven-star hotels and indoor ski slopes. Two new creative districts (Dubai Design District and Al Quoz) have gained the attention of the international art scene, too. To see the city in its best light, go in November when it's not too humid, and you can happily bronze by the pool all day.\n\nWhere to stay: For an intimate and “anti-bling” stay in Downtown Dubai, check into The Lana, the much-anticipated debut of the Dorchester Collection in the Middle East. Elsewhere the One&Only One Za’abeel is a food and spa destination in itself with a host of starry venues, including La Dame De Pic by Anne-Sophie Pic, DuangDy by Bo Songvisava, and Dylan Jones of Bangkok’s Bo.Lan, plus the first Middle Eastern Longevity Hub by Clinique La Prairie. For more, see our pick of the best Dubai hotels.\n\nFlight time: 13 hours from London\n\nWhen to go: November–March\n\nAverage winter temperature: 32°C\n\nThe islands of Thailand are the stuff of castaway fantasies. White sand, rustic-chic beach shacks, a hammock gently swaying between two palm trees as a turquoise sea laps at the shore… There are dozens to choose from, and each offers something quite different, from the super-spas of Koh Samui to barefoot beach-bum in Koh Lipe, while Koh Lanta remains quietly chilled out with lovely places to stay on beaches that stretch for miles.\n\nWhere to stay: On Phang Nga, Six Senses Yai Noi has created the perfect castaway experience via a collection of stilted thatched-roof villas and a hilltop half-moon infinity pool. If you're headed to Phuket, Amanpuri has a special location on Pansea Beach, plus an impressive selection of restaurants and a world-beating spa. For something the kids will love, the railway-themed InterContinental Khao Yai Resort has upcycled vintage railway carriages serving as suites and an old-timey ticketing booth for a lobby. See the best hotels in Thailand for more.\n\nFlight time: 3 hours 40 minutes from London\n\nWhen to go: March–May\n\nAverage winter temperature: 17°C\n\nFrom the 1920s to the 1950s, port city Tangier was a playground for the maddest and baddest bohemians: Beat icons like Burroughs and Kerouac; glamorously demon-plagued playwrights from Tennessee Williams to Jean Genet. But it wasn’t just the romance of boxy white-washed buildings fanning along a too-blue African shoreline that brought them. The city’s status as a near-lawless ‘international zone’ made strong drugs, strong cocktails and other strongly sordid entertainments all-too-readily available. The Moroccan monarchy later enacted punishment: the city was left to rot. A new king and a new attitude have revived it, widespread restoration inviting a smarter vitality, where cafés-cum-bookshops and speakeasies retain a raffish-cool, without segueing into seedy. In a hilltop casbah, El Morocco Club is where the leisure class make easy work of looking beautiful while slurping oysters and sipping Mojitos. And though chaotic Marrakech isn’t short of designer riads to escape to, Tangier is an infinitely jauntier option, and with T-shirt temperatures to boot.\n\nWhere to stay: One of the best hotels in Morocco, Jasper Conran's Villa Mabrouka has become an instant classic since he renovated the former Tangier love nest of Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé in a magical secret garden by the Kasbah. Another buzzing address is the Fairmont Tazi Palace Tangier, which has been reborn following a renovation as a showstopping 133-room celebration of Moroccan Art Deco glamour.\n\nFlight time: 9 hours from London\n\nWhen to go: December–April\n\nAverage winter temperature: 27°C\n\nWith its glorious beaches shifting gold to molten silver, dramatic piton peaks and thick rainforests offering up waterfalls and wildlife, St Lucia’s landscape is staggering, even for the Caribbean. Ribbons of protected coral skirt its shores, coves are flanked by coconut-laden palms and many of its hotels have scrambled uphill for front-row seats of those fabled Caribbean sunsets – a fleeting burst of crimson and orange. Inland, tropical rainforests heave and organic farms and cocoa plantations whisk visitors off on farm-to-fork and bean-to-bar tutorials. The island is at it's peak in December to March, when the humidity is low, rainfall is minimal and there's plenty of sunshine.\n\nWhere to stay: For a view of the island's famous Pitons, Jade Mountain has eight terrace levels cascading gracefully from a cliffside, so rooms – some with private infinity pools – enjoy sweeping views of the island. Another standout address is Sugar Beach, which occupies one of the most privileged spots in St. Lucia with its 96 rooms and villas spilling onto verandas with raised views over a calm turquoise bay. See our edit of the best hotels in St Lucia for more.\n\nFlight time: 11 hours 35 minutes from London\n\nWhen to go: December–February\n\nAverage winter temperature: 27°C\n\nCape Town is always a good idea, but particularly around Christmas and New Year, when the fledgling South African summer sets beaches and vineyards aglow. The mere sight of beautiful crowds bronzing against its theatrical, cragged mountain backdrop will banish the winter blues in one blow. And just when you thought the Mother City’s raw good looks, smart art and design scenes and world-class food couldn’t get more appealing, it only goes and adds a pair of super-hot hotels, too.\n\nWhere to stay: Set just off the coastal road between Camps Bay and Llandudno, The Twelve Apostles Hotel & Spa is built into its namesake mountainside, affording it quite possibly one of the best views of Cape Town. Another bolthole we love is Future Found Sanctuary, a transformed family house on the side of Table Mountain, from which you can drive to Cape Point, taste wine in the vineyards in nearby Constantia or simply lie about by the pool all day.\n\nFlight time: 13 hours from London to Mahé (including one stop)\n\nWhen to go: October–November\n\nAverage winter temperature: 29°C\n\nAdrift in the Indian Ocean, a thousand miles from the nearest coast of Africa, the Seychelles are the ultimate fantasy-island escape. The archipelago has year-round heat and sunshine, as well as its fair share of rain. The wettest months in Seychelles are November to March, but temperatures never get too oppressively hot (meandering around 24ºC at night and up to 29ºC in the daytime, year-round). October is a great month to go for a hit of sunshine before it gets too rainy and the air is fresher.\n\nWhere to stay: Sitting south of Mahé, newcomer Waldorf Astoria Seychelles Platte Island is heaven for eco-conscious travellers who want close encounters with hawksbill turtles, reef sharks and stingrays. Four Seasons Resort Seychelles at Desroches Island offers up true Robinson Crusoe vibes, except you’ll also find exquisitely designed rooms, fine dining and exemplary service from the Four Seasons staff. Another standout is Six Senses Zil Pasyon, where the villas are the closest thing to super-smart, minimalist tree houses. For more options, see our guide to the best Seychelles hotels.\n\nFlight time: 16.5 hours from London\n\nWhen to go: Bali is hot year-round. It is rainiest (and thus cheapest) November–April; but even when it rains, it's in short, tropical bursts.\n\nAverage winter temperature: 27°C\n\nBali is a heavenly island with earthly pleasures. Back-to-blissed-out spa retreats so fine that Bali has developed a style all of its own: clean and contemporary, dark wood and linen whites. Parties, from flip-flop full-moon raves in hidden-away coves to the cool Potato Head Beach Club and The Lawn at the boho beach spot that everyone's talking about, Canggu. There's glamping here now and chic boutiques. There's art in Ubud. There are spas absolutely everywhere. There are beaches, of course. And the pools here are something else: a classy, jungly deep green shrouded by tropical leafery. Those incredible horizon pools high up overlooking the rainforest – that's classic Bali.\n\nWhere to stay: Book ahead, and you could nab a night in one of the world's most popular Airbnbs, The Hideout, a magical-looking two-story bamboo hut in Selat. In Ubud, COMO Uma Ubud is a welcome slice of stillness, where days begin with sunrise yoga classes at the hotel’s central pavilion before nourishing, Australian-style breakfasts served next to the trickling koi pond. At the edge of the Uyung River, Mandapa, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve has a gilded, glittering on-site temple, spacious villas with jungle views and spa treatments by renowned intuitive healer Ibu Ketut Mursi. See our edit of the best hotels in Bali for more.\n\nFlight time: about 10 hours from London\n\nWhen to go: November–December, and March\n\nAverage winter temperature: 25°C\n\nOnce a hiding place for pirate treasure and prohibition liquor, Harbour Island in the Bahamas is a colourfully eccentric retreat where every night is a party and every day more vibrant than the last. The sand is pink, the turquoise water is home to green sea turtles and orange starfish, and yellow-throated birds fly about the trees. Days on the beach are long and lazy, and the time of day is forgotten.\n\nWhere to stay: Eleven Bahama House is the ideal home-from-home, offering plenty of privacy. Adjoining rooms act as apartments with private shared living spaces and spacious sun decks. For a boutique stay, The Other Side is a small, gorgeous set of tents and shacks on Harbour Island.\n\nFlight time: 12 hours from London\n\nWhen to go: May–December\n\nAverage winter temperature: 28°C\n\nWhat Mauritius has over its Indian Ocean neighbours, the Seychelles and the Maldives, is its size and natural diversity and the fact that you can do it independently. Its beaches are still potted tropical paradises, and here you can rent a car and go exploring to find your own deserted cove, drive or hike up into its rainforested hills, take a boat out and go snorkelling or dive in its extraordinary underwater world. It has a bit of a reputation for overly groomed resorts – but it also has some of the finest beach hotels in the world, and you can find little boutique hotels right on the beach, too. Perhaps the best months to go to Mauritius are September, October and November when it's hot but not too hot (averaging around 25-28ºC in the day, a cooler 17-19ºC at night), and at its driest (the rainy season in Mauritius is from January til April).\n\nWhere to stay: The most spectacular stay might be Shangri-La Le Touessrok, a private island escape with two pristine golf courses, a pagoda-style spa and a sushi restaurant. For a fun Soho house-style atmosphere, try LUX* Grand Baie – there's a poolside DJ, a rooftop athletics track and a nightclub underneath its fabulous Asian restaurant, Ai KISU. For families, One&Only Le Saint Géran has the best kids’ club on the island. See our best hotels in Mauritius guide for more.\n\nFlight time: 3 hours 30 minutes from London\n\nWhen to go: Year-round\n\nAverage winter temperature: 22°C\n\nIt's summer all the time in the Canaries, where temperatures average in the low-mid 20s all year round. As well as the well-known destinations – Gran Canaria, Tenerife, Fuerteventura, Lanzarote (pictured) – there are three smaller islands that are less visited and less spoilt: La Palma, El Hierro and La Gomera. They don't appear on the average British holidaymaker's mental world-map, and make for interesting exploring and winter sunshine.\n\nWhere to stay: The Ritz-Carlton in Tenerife made our Gold List in 2022 – a pastel-pink, Moorish palace mansion of a hotel with eight restaurants, a handful of swimming pools and a decadent spa.\n\nFlight time: 10+ hours from London\n\nWhen to go: November–March\n\nAverage winter temperature: 24°C\n\nMexico's Yucatán Peninsula, on the Atlantic Coast, has a magical mix of ancient and buzzy-right-now cultures. Swim in its green ceynotes, discover temples, salute the sun beneath the glitterball gods with fashionistas on the beach in Tulum. Mix it up in colonial Mérida. Go barefoot on Isla Holbox. The best time to come is during Britain's darkest months.\n\nWhere to stay: Beachside retreat Hotel Esencia, beloved by celebrities such as Bella Hadid and Lupita Nyong’o, made our gold list of the best hotels in the world for 2023. Likewise Habitas Bacalar, a small – just 34 rooms – off-the-beaten track stay that hosts local vendors for guests experiences and uses traditional Mayan cooking techniques within its restaurant. For more options, see our pick of the best hotels in Mexico.\n\nFlight time: 3 hours 50 mins from London\n\nWhen to go: December–March\n\nAverage winter temperature: 21°C\n\nOnce a slightly rough-around-the-edges hippie town, Taghazout is now Morocco’s top surf destination. The sleepy fishing village on the Atlantic coast hasn’t lost any of its old-fashioned charm, and goats still wander gormlessly through the dusty tangerine-coloured streets while fishermen haul in their daily catches from rickety blue and white boats. For serious surfers, winter marks the beginning of peak season, and as the swell rips up, the break-chasing crowds arrive. Temperatures usually hover around a very pleasant 20°C, but Saharan winds often push the mercury up much higher. The places to stay keep getting smarter, offering surf lessons in the day and rooftop yoga at sunset. And even if you’re not into surfing, there are plenty of beautiful hiking trails nearby, camel rides along the beach and excellent fishing too.\n\nWhere to stay: 15-room, Afro-inspired Munga Guesthouse is owned by former pro surfer Mounir Bouallaq.\n\nFlight time: 7 hours from London\n\nWhen to go: October–March\n\nAverage winter temperature: 24°C\n\nThe mid-Atlantic archipelago of Bermuda, mythical setting for Shakespeare's Tempest, is a land of pink beaches, pink houses and brightly coloured shorts. It is Caribbean in nature, though it's much closer to the UK – so shorter flight times – and has a distinctive character all of its own. Its pink-sand beaches are lovely, too. Those along the South Shore are the glory of the island. Horseshoe Bay is the best known and most crowded, though Warwick Long Bay, a short way along the coast, is just as alluring. At one end of Horseshoe there is a little patch of sand the size of a playground, cut off from the rest of it by a rocky hillock.\n\nWhere to stay: We like the Hamilton Princess & Beach Club, a 19th-century retreat set right on the capital's harbour.\n\nFlight time: 10 hours from London\n\nWhen to go: Year-round\n\nAverage winter temperature: 21°C\n\n'The Golden State' is an appropriate nickname; California is one of the sunniest of US states, with mild winters, little rain and plenty of sunshine, especially in the south. For a classic USA road trip, hire a convertible and hit the Pacific Coast road. State Route 1 runs 550 miles from Leggett all the way down to Malibu. It has famously beautiful views much of the way, and the best section is that from San Francisco through Monterey and San Simeon to San Luis Obispo (where the road drifts inland), although north of San Francisco the route is wilder and less crowded. Aim to drive southwards, to be closer to the sea.\n\nWhere to stay: In Los Angeles, The Hoxton has brought a healthy dose of European flair to the West Coast. For a classic stay, Shutters on the Beach in Santa Monica has come to embody the finest of So-Cal's barefoot luxury. In San Francisco, Proper is a buzzy stay beloved for its eclectic decor and perennially-packed rooftop bar, Charmaine’s. See our edit of the best hotels in California for more.\n\nFlight time: One full day from the UK\n\nWhen to go: Year-round (though March is particularly rainy on Tahiti).\n\nAverage winter temperature: 28°C\n\nIn both geography and spirit, just about as far from a drizzly British winter as you can get. French Polynesia is made up of 100-odd little islands in the South Pacific Ocean, the best-known of them Tahiti and Bora Bora. They are out of this world. Castaway fantasy, ringed by reefs; the water unbelievable shades of turquoise blue; the hibiscus flowers Gauguin bright; everything bright and light and hyper-real.\n\nWhere to stay: The Brando is the area's biggest-hitting hotel – owned by Marlon Brando and set on a stunning, living coral reef.\n\nFlight time: 8 hours from London\n\nWhen to go: October–March\n\nAverage winter temperature: 25°C\n\nWith its cities of pink, blue and gold, its romantic lakeside palaces and desert camps, Rajasthan is India's brightest and most beautiful state. Go there and get carried away, whether you're getting stuck into the hustle-bustle streets of Jaipur, escaping into the desert around Jaisalmer, or floating wistfully across the lake in romantic Udaipur.\n\nWhere to stay: Six Senses Fort Barwara took almost a decade to transform the 700-year-old fort into a 48-suite hotel. Its small garden grows everything from desi roses to cauliflower, cabbage, guavas, and jamun, while the ancient temple spa blends Ayurveda with Six Senses’ inimitable touch. Read more at our Six Senses Fort Barawara review.\n\nFlight time: 7 hours and 15 minutes from London\n\nWhen to go: October–April\n\nAverage winter temperature: 26°C\n\nOman is a less-glitzy, laid-back alternative to Dubai – only the landscape here is more dramatic: wide open spaces punctuated by oases and desert towns; valleys fragrant with rose and sandalwood; hidden coves with golden beaches and brilliant-turquoise water. The capital, Muscat dazzles in the year-round sunshine with its grand mosques and bustling souks. Up in the far north-east, the Musandam Peninsula has some of the best diving in the Middle East (whale shark and turtles are the big draw).\n\nWhere to stay: Six Senses Zighy Bay is on a golden sweep of sand backed by the impossibly steep Al Hajar Mountains. To feel truly isolated, camp in handmade Bedouin tents among the epic sand dunes of the Wahiba Sands south of Muscat – it's the best way to find authentic Oman.\n\nFlight time: 13+ hours from London\n\nWhen to go: October–April\n\nAverage winter temperature: 27°C\n\nWith its lovely Caribbean climate, guaranteed warm and sunny days and very little rain, Cuba’s weather is at its most reliable during the UK winter. The beaches down on the south coast may get the best sunshine and draw the biggest crowds, but there’s plenty beyond the palm-fringed stretches of sand. Havana’s got its colourful pastel-hued buildings, cigars and Cadillacs, while the perfectly preserved Spanish colonial architecture in UNESCO-protected Trinidad makes the city feel lost in time. Elsewhere, there’s no end of nature reserves, lush forests, mountains and tobacco plantations to explore.\n\nWhere to stay: Gardens Havana is a sweet guesthouse in a faded, renovated townhouse in Havana.\n\nFlight time: 20 hours from London\n\nWhen to go: November–March\n\nAverage winter temperature: 35°C\n\nThe north-west coast of Western Australia is remote (it closed its boarders to the rest of Australia for over two years during Covid), beautiful and largely uninhabited. It has the least-visited of all Australia's coral reefs, Ningaloo Reef, a pristine 260km stretch of coral where thrilling encounters are fairly routine, whether you're diving or snorkelling. Turtles nest from November to March.\n\nWhere to stay: Como the Treasury in Perth is the city's smoothest stay, with a rooftop restaurant and beautiful bedrooms.\n\nFlight time: 14+ hours from London (via Johannesburg)\n\nWhen to go: November–March\n\nAverage winter temperature: 27°C\n\nAstonishingly, Namibia gets barely half a million visitors a year – while neighbouring South Africa receives almost 10 times that number. But as travellers are slowly beginning to discover, this is one of Africa’s most fascinating destinations: rugged, intrepid and dramatic. More than a dozen new camps and lodges have opened up over the past few years, each one rocking a more creative approach to conservation. Namibia is usually touted as a year-round destination, but in truth the searing summer temperatures can be oppressive. November to March may coincide with the country’s wettest months, but with the rain comes a stunning transformation of scenery. The arid desert morphs into a lush green carpet; swarms of migratory birds arrive, and animals start breeding. Rain is localised and comes in short, sharp bursts, so it’s unlikely to have too much of an impact on your trip.\n\nWhere to stay: Habitas Namibia offers an intriguing blend of safari, wellness and culture. For more, see our favourite off-grid safaris in Namibia.\n\nFlight time: 16+ hours from London (via Houston)\n\nWhen to go: December–April\n\nAverage winter temperature: 30°C\n\nBelize’s peak season coincides perfectly with the UK’s coldest months. Although temperatures remain high all year-round, January to March has the lowest chance of rain, making this an ideal time to explore this tiny adventure-packed nation. Bordered by Guatemala and Mexico, Belize attracts a fraction of the crowds of its neighbours, yet the natural and cultural diversity of this former British colony is truly compelling. It’s home to Mayan ruins, national parks, nature reserves and the Belize Barrier Reef (which forms part of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, the world’s second largest), all begging to be explored. The country’s jungly interior contrasts with a dazzling Caribbean coastline and hundreds of small cayes and islands, while a flurry of fresh hotels have all put eco-tourism at the top of their agenda.\n\nWhere to stay: At rattan- and plant-filled Itzana.\n\nFlight time: 17+ hours from London, via Nairobi\n\nWhen to go: December–February\n\nAverage winter temperature: 32°C\n\nWhen the Foreign Office slapped a travel ban on Lamu after the 2011 Somali terrorist attacks, it fell off the map. But now with sanctions lifted, crowds are starting to flock back to this far-flung African island that still feels totally unchanged by time. It’s long been a popular beachy bolt-on after an epic Kenyan safari, attracting curious travellers rather than flag-following sightseers. There are no vehicles, just donkeys and dhows, and the heady mix of Arab, Persian, Chinese, Indian and European cultures is mesmerising. After a few days in the UNESCO-protected Old Town, head south to the deserted beaches or drift over by dhow to the nearby Robinson Crusoe islands of Manda and Kiwayu. From December to February, temperatures average a steamy 32°C, making winter the prime time to come and enjoy the postcard-perfect empty sands and Lamu’s laid-back rhythm.\n\nWhere to stay: Seafront Peponi was built in the 1930s and has been a hotel since the 1960s, with an incredible pool, shady verandah and a list of former guests that includes Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall.\n\nFlight time: 17+ hours from London (via Mexico City)\n\nWhen to go: December–April\n\nAverage winter temperature: 30°C\n\nOver on Mexico’s Pacific Coast, two beach towns sit side-by-side: Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo. They couldn’t be more different. Ixtapa, stacked with high-rise hotels and modern infrastructure was purpose-built for tourists, while, just round the bay, Zihuatanejo has kept hold of its old-world charm and sleepy-fishing-village feel. It’s a low-key beach retreat with genuine Mexican flair; fisherman flog their catches on the shore each morning, and the town centre is filled with historical cobbled streets and a buzzy market. Clutches of boutique properties sit right on the beach or overlooking the bay – which is a hit with surfers. It’s hot all year round, but October to April sees the least rain, making this a perfect spot for a hit of winter vitamin D.\n\nWhere to stay: We love the Thompson, which spotlights interiors from Mexico City-based studios.\n\nFlight time: 13+ hours from London\n\nWhen to go: December–March\n\nAverage winter temperature: 32°C\n\nThe Gulf of Chiriquí is nothing new – travellers have long been flocking to the white-sand beaches and dazzling turquoise waters of Panama’s Caribbean archipelago. But the Pacific side is still significantly less discovered. There’s Islas Secas, a highly exclusive, privately-owned archipelago of 14 islands offering pristine beaches and one of the largest coral reefs in the Pacific, making it the perfect spot for diving and snorkelling. It's just under an hour from Panama City by twin-otter plane and is totally worth it for the privacy and seclusion once you arrive. The best time to come is from January to April, when the wet rainy season gives way to a few months of glorious sunshine and scorching temperatures.\n\nWhere to stay: Philanthropist Louis Bacon opened Islas Secas, home to four individually designed Casita sites and, three Tented Casitas, all located on one of the islands and sleeping up to just 24 guests.\n\nFlight time: 13.5 hours from London UK (via Johannesburg, South Africa)\n\nWhen to go: April–November\n\nAverage winter temperature: 26°C\n\nThis southern African country has the most astonishing coast – the beaches of Mozambique are out of this world. Great stretches of sand, wild and dune-backed; lapped by the beautiful Indian Ocean where humpback whales breach, where you can swim with manta rays in the Mozambique Channel. In the little islands of Mozambique's Bazaruto Archipelago, a protected marine park towards the south, there are sand-floor bars and simple thatched lodges, and the most sensational sandy islets in bluer-than-blue waters, like wisps of cloud in a summer sky. On the beaches of northern Mozambique you feel as though you're at the end of the world; off this coast are the dreamlike Quirimbas Islands, including heavenly Vamizi\n\nFor those keen to tread where others have not, Mozambique has a certain caché – savvy travellers have been returning, in small numbers, to this coast for the past 20-odd years – and a few new spruced-up hotels are starting to appear – but are keen to keep it all a secret. We say go now, before the secret is out.\n\nWhere to stay: In one of the 17 prettily stripped-back bandas on the southern peninsula's tip at Machangulo Beach Lodge.\n\nFlight time: 13 hours from London\n\nWhen to go: October–February\n\nAverage winter temperature: 31°C\n\nOn Brazil's Atlantic seaboard, far from the tourist trail, Bahia has deserted beaches, rainforests full of wildlife, cocoa farms, a surfers' town and several barefooty resorts that you'll never want to leave. Head to the small town of Itácaré for surfing, sailing, walking and birdwatching; to Trancoso for people-watching and beach-partying.\n\nWhere to stay: Built between a deserted beach and a black lagoon, Butterfly House is an eco-luxe guuesthouse made up of five green-grass-roofed bungalows on bamboo stilts, enveloped by thousands of citronella plants.\n\nFlight time: 14 hours from London\n\nWhen to go: November–April\n\nAverage winter temperature: 32°C\n\nIf you want to see South-East Asia at its most beguiling, you need to head to Cambodia. Go to watch dawn break over the jungle temples of Angkor (pictured), and for the authentic traditions of its villages and laidback capital, Phnom Penh. But also go for its immaculate beaches.\n\nWhere to stay: Shinta Mani Wild consists of 15 tents across a private state. See our pick of where to stay in Cambodia for more.\n\nFlight time: 11 hours from London\n\nWhen to go: December–May\n\nAverage winter temperature: 26°C\n\nEcuador is less developed than Costa Rica, so expect an adventure — one with everything its Latin cousin has to offer, and more besides. Want wildlife? Take a luxury cruise into the Ecuadorian Amazon. Want surf? Ecuador’s 1,400 miles of Pacific coast has plenty of that. And then there’s Quito, a much smarter capital than San Jose: a heady blend of steamy salsotecas, grand Andean vistas, and fabulous hotels in ravishingly restored colonial mansions (none more elegant than the peerless Casa Gangotena). You may have heard of another of its under-the-radar destinations, the Galapagos, too. Ecuador’s different geographical zones have their own, distinct weather patterns, but Europe’s winter is when the weather is warmest in Quito and the Highlands; driest in the jungle; and sunniest on the coast.\n\nAbove: Laguna de Quilotoa is a beautiful crater lake in a secluded location of the Ecuadorian Andes.\n\nWhere to stay: Want an eco-stay? The five-star Mashpi Lodge is a sustainable, all-glass stunner hiding out in a cloud forest.\n\nFlight time: 14 hours from London\n\nWhen to go: January–March\n\nAverage winter temperature: 29°C\n\nEvery bit as dreamy as the Maldives, but more satisfyingly off-radar, the Andaman Islands have smartened up. This tropical archipelago — geographically closer to Myanmar and Indonesia than its owner, India — has always been brochure-beautiful, but only recently blessed with luxury digs. Those far-flung beaches and impossibly pure waters were more reward for intrepid surfers and gap-year backpackers until now. But it was only a matter of time before this primitive paradise turned upscale. Havelock is the most developed of the 572 islands, the vast majority of which are off-limits to visitors (and populated by indigenous tribes). It’s here that Indian luxury hotel giant Taj has newly scattered 72 thatched villas under a rainforest canopy, fringing the fabled Radhanagar beach, widely said to be among the best in the world. Winter is the clearest, driest time of year — particularly January to March — with temperatures around 29C.\n\nWhere to stay: Jalakara is a boutique, teak-and-concrete sanctuary tucked into a banana plantation, where there’s no WiFi, no TV — just utter, nature-swathed serenity.\n\nFlight time: 9 hours from London\n\nWhen to go: October–April\n\nAverage winter temperature: 27°C\n\nKarnataka’s beach scene is every bit as beautiful, but rather less glowsticky, than Goa’s, though it shares the same coast (the state of Karnataka is further south). Gokarna beach, often listed among India’s finest sandy crescents, is chilled-out, powdery and palm-fringed; beach-goers more hammock-swinging yogis than UV-painted ravers. Better still, there’s more to explore beyond browning and sun salutations. Hampi’s magical, ancient temples and bizarre, perilously-stacked boulders have fascinated wanderers and vagabonds for hundreds of years.\n\nWhere to stay: Try trekking and then de-stressing at the Taj Madikeri Resort & Spa, in the emerald, coffee- and spice-planted hills of Coorg.\n\nFlight time: 12 hours from London\n\nWhen to go: November–February\n\nAverage winter temperature: 27°C\n\nVietnam may well be one of the most fascinating, beautiful and charming countries you will ever visit. Saigon is wonderful, colonial and quirky; Ho Chi Minh City has one of the world's best food scenes. And the coast of Vietnam – oh, the coast! The beaches are extraordinary. So much untouched beauty. Little islands and dramatic bays to explore by boat. Out-of-this-world beach-chic places to stay, right on the sand. And even though it's easy-going and luxury can be found everywhere, it still feels like a secret, still some sense of discovery about a trip there.\n\nWhere to stay: On a stretch of under-rated Vietnamese coastline, Regent Phu Quoc is a luxury gem with all the trimmings for an idyllic long-haul fly-and-flop.\n\nFlight time: 7 hours from London\n\nWhen to go: October–March\n\nAverage winter temperature: 28°C\n\nGhana’s ‘Africa for beginners’ reputation tips a hat to the ease of a trip here — stable politics, developed towns, functional transport. But it misses all the other things that make Ghana great. Like the capital, Accra, a spirited city stuffed to the gills with red-hot food, nightlife and art. See Urban Grill, Afro-Latin fusion helmed by Andrew DiCataldo, of Manhattan’s once-loved Patria; rooftop club Carbon, owned by Nick House of Mahiki; and Gallery 1957, with its knack for edgy homegrown shows that blow up on social media. Then there’s the beaches: bonfire parties and street food at Accra’s own Labadi. Winter months are hot — temperatures average around 28°C — so you’ll be glad of a bracing Atlantic dip. Alright, there’s no Big Five, but there are safaris: walking with elephants, world-class birding, humpback-whale-watching. Plus there’s that handy hour’s time difference in common with South Africa, with only half the flight time.\n\nWhere to stay: The soothing White Sands Beach Resort & Spa, an exclusive private members’ club just an hour’s drive from Accra."
