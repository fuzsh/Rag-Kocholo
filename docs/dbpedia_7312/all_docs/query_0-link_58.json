        "text": "Val James\n\nRochester Americans Left Wing - 1980-85\n\nVal James, the first American-born black player in Amerks and NHL history, appeared in 253 games with the Amerks from 1980-81 to 1984-85 and was a fan favorite over his five seasons with the club.\n\n“This is an incredible honor as I spent some amazing years with the Amerks,” said James. “The Amerks organization is top notch, and the fans were always there for me. I have nothing but great memories of my teammates and coaches and am forever grateful for my time in Rochester.”\n\nAfter a brief three-game stint with the Amerks in 1980-81, James would remain in Rochester for the next four seasons, leading the team to a playoff appearance each year and culminating with a Calder Cup championship in 1983. His biggest on-ice contribution came that year when he scored the game-winning goal in the deciding game of the Calder Cup Finals against the Maine Mariners, earning Rochester its first of two Calder Cups in a four-year span during the 1980s.\n\nOriginally a 16th-round pick (184th overall) of the Detroit Red Wings in the 1977 NHL Amateur Draft, James collected 24 points (10+14) and 496 penalty minutes during his Amerks career.\n\nIt was also during his time with the Amerks that James made a substantial impact on the game of hockey, becoming the first African American player in the NHL when he took to the ice with the Buffalo Sabres in 1982. In 1987, he once again made history as the first black player of any nationality to skate for the Toronto Maple Leafs. While popular for his tough play and winning personality, James faced racist taunts at opposing arenas throughout his career.\n\nA native of Ocala, Florida, James retired following the 1987-88 season after additional stops in St. Catharines, Newmarket and Baltimore, concluding an eight-year professional playing career with 34 points (14+20) in 416 games at the AHL level as well as 11 career NHL games with Buffalo and Toronto.\n\nIn 2015, James authored an autobiography entitled Black Ice: The Val James Story. Co-written with John Gallagher, the book chronicles the life and story of the trail-blazing athlete who endured and overcame discrimination to realize his dreams and become an inspiration for future generations.\n\nEdit\n\nJason Pominville\n\nRochester Americans Right Wing - 2002-06\n\nAs the 67th member of the exclusive club, Jason Pominville spent his entire American Hockey League career with the Amerks from 2002-06 after being selected by the Buffalo Sabres in the second round (55th overall) of the 2001 NHL Draft. In 235 career games, he amassed 192 points on 96 goals and 96 assists while also adding 21 points (10+11) in 19 playoff appearances with Rochester.\n\n“I’m extremely honored and humbled to join so many other Amerks greats in the Hall of Fame,” said Pominville. “Rochester will always be the best place to play in the American Hockey League and my time there definitely helped me take the next step in my career and fulfill my lifelong dream of playing in the National Hockey League. My family and I look forward to seeing all the great fans and everyone who supported me along the way on Jan. 27.”\n\nAfter posting 34 points in 73 games as a rookie in 2002-03, Pominville nearly doubled his offensive output the following year with an astounding 64 points in 66 games to finish second on the team in scoring. He also made his NHL debut that year, appearing in one game with the Sabres before going on to pace the Amerks with nine goals and tie for the team’s scoring lead with 19 points during Rochester’s impressive run to the Western Conference Finals.\n\nPominville duplicated the effort in 2004-05, again tying for second on the team in scoring while also becoming the first Amerk to record back-to-back 30-goal seasons since Peter Ciavaglia in 1991-92 and 1992-93.\n\nHis biggest impact offensively came at the beginning of the 2005-06 season when he opened the campaign with 19 goals and 26 points in only 18 games. Pominville scored at least one goal in 10 games over that span, including a five-goal effort in an 8-4 home win over the Cleveland Barons on Oct. 21. He became just the third player in franchise history to score five goals in a game, joining Donald Audette and Dave Hynes.\n\nThe impressive start earned him a permanent promotion to the NHL, where he closed out the year with 30 points – including 18 more goals – in 57 games with Buffalo. After scoring his first NHL goal on Nov. 27, he would go on to score perhaps the biggest goal of his NHL career in Game 5 of the 2006 Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Ottawa Senators, marking the first time in NHL history that a playoff series was decided by an overtime shorthanded goal. The Sabres would advance to meet the Carolina Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference Finals after failing to qualify for the playoffs the previous three seasons.\n\nA native of Repentigny, Quebec, Pominville played an integral role during Buffalo’s record-setting season in 2006-07, his first full season at the NHL level, matching a career-high with 34 goals while appearing in all 82 games. He helped the Sabres set franchise records for the most consecutive wins and road wins to begin a season while also leading Buffalo to the 50-win mark for just the second time in franchise history. The Sabres also tied the franchise mark for the most points in a season on their way to capturing their first President’s Trophy as regular season champions and advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals for the second straight year.\n\nPominville’s first stint with Buffalo was highlighted by four straight 82-game seasons coinciding with a two-year term as Sabres team captain from 2011 to 2013. After parts of five seasons with the Minnesota Wild from 2012 to 2017, during which the Wild qualified for the postseason each year, Pominville returned to Buffalo for his final two seasons, including another 82-game campaign in 2017-18.\n\nPominville retired following the 2018-19 season having recorded 727 points (293+434) in 1,060 career NHL games with Buffalo and Minnesota.\n\nDomenic Pittis\n\nRochester Americans Center - 1998-2000, 2003-04\n\nDomenic Pittis quickly evolved into one of the franchise’s most prolific scorers during his three seasons in Rochester, reaching the 20-goal mark twice and recording at least 65 points on all three occasions. In 204 career games with the Amerks, Pittis produced 246 points, placing him among the top 20 forwards all-time in franchise history, and ranking 17th all-time with 171 assists. He also added 70 points (16+54) in 57 postseason appearances while leading the Amerks to the playoffs in each of his three seasons, including back-to-back trips to the Calder Cup Finals in 1999 and 2000.\n\nA year after breaking into the American Hockey League with the Syracuse Crunch, Pittis joined the Amerks for the 1998-99 campaign and assembled what would be his best season over his 19-year pro career. In 76 games with the Amerks, Pittis amassed an AHL-best 104 points on 38 goals and 66 assists, winning the John B. Sollenberger Trophy as the League’s top point-getter during the regular season while helping the Amerks to a franchise record 52 wins during the regular season. Rochester also set an AHL record for the fewest goals allowed with 176.\n\nPittis became just the sixth different player in team history to earn the honors and first to lead the AHL in scoring since Paul Gardner put up 112 points during the 1985-86 season. It was also the last 100-point performance by an Amerk in recent years.\n\nThat same season also saw Pittis accomplish the rarest of feats as he appeared in two games in the same day. On March 28, 1999, Pittis helped the Buffalo Sabres to a 4-3 overtime win over the Pittsburgh Penguins, who drafted the Calgary, Alberta, native in the second round (52nd overall) of the 1993 NHL Draft, before returning to Rochester in time to notch two assists in the 3-2 loss to the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks later that same day. Since then, no other Amerks player has done it.\n\nPittis and the Amerks would advance to their first of two straight Calder Cup Finals later that Spring, ultimately falling in five games to the Providence Bruins.\n\nThe following season limited Pittis to just 53 games due to injuries but was equally as productive, nonetheless. Despite missing the first 22 games, Pittis would rediscover his scoring touch and finish the year leading the Amerks with 48 assists and 65 points while leading Rochester back to the Calder Cup Finals. Pittis delivered a memorable performance during the postseason, scoring four goals and tying an AHL record with 26 assists in 21 playoff contests as Rochester fell to the Hartford Wolf Pack in six games.\n\nAfter three years away from the organization, including two full seasons in the NHL with the Edmonton Oilers, Pittis made a return trip back to Rochester in 2003-04 for what would be he his final stint with the Amerks. Much like the previous two years, Pittis averaged more than a point-per-game, leading the team in assists (57) and points (77) and ranking second in goals (20) while serving as team captain. The Amerks returned to the postseason for the third time under Pittis, who added 19 points (5+14) in 16 games as Rochester advanced to the Western Conference Finals.\n\nPittis departed the organization the following year, ending his tenure in Rochester as the franchise’s all-time leader in playoff assists (54) and second in points (70). He also ranks sixth all-time among playoff leaders in games played (57) and seventh in goals (16).\n\nHe played the remaining nine seasons of his pro career in Switzerland, winning two league titles along the way as well as a Champions Hockey League championship. Pittis also excelled at the international level while abroad, helping Team Canada claim gold at the 2007 Spengler Cup.\n\nPittis announced his retirement following the 2012-13 campaign and is currently in his sixth season as an assistant coach with the Stockton Heat, the AHL affiliate of the Calgary Flames.\n\nDoug Janik\n\nRochester Americans Defenseman, 2001-06\n\nDoug Janik spent five seasons patrolling the Rochester blueline from 2001 to 2006, establishing himself as one of the most dominant defensemen in franchise history. Janik recorded 91 points (18+73) over his five seasons with the club, ranking 31st all-time among Rochester blueliners, while also leading the Amerks to four straight playoff appearances. His 376 career games are the third-most of any defenseman and rank 14th all-time.\n\nAside from his offensive contributions, Janik was widely known for his strong physical presence and hard-nosed tenacity that became symbolic with his rugged style of play. Janik averaged more than 100 penalty minutes in each of his five seasons in Rochester, including a career-best 196 penalty minutes during the 2004-05 campaign. He racked up 686 penalty minutes as an Amerk, the third-most among any defenseman and the 12th-most all-time in team history.\n\nFollowing three years at the University of Maine, Janik began his pro career in Rochester in 2001-02, ranking third among all Amerks defensemen with 23 points (6+17) while appearing in all 80 regular-season games. After producing 16 points in each of the next two seasons, in addition to seeing time with the Buffalo Sabres, Janik helped the Amerks to their best regular-season record in franchise history during the 2004-05 campaign as Rochester finished the year with an AHL-best 51-19-6-4 record, winning the Macgregor Kilpatrick Trophy as regular-season champions. The Springfield, Mass., native accounted for two 12 points (2+10) that year and a team-best 196 penalty minutes.\n\nThe Amerks would set several single-season franchise records for the most points (112) and the longest home winning streak which saw Rochester win 17 consecutive home games between Dec. 17 and Mar. 4. The 51-win season would be the second-most in any season for Rochester and Randy Cunneyworth, the franchise’s all-time leader in coaching wins, would be named the AHL’s Coach of the Year.\n\nJanik had his best season as an Amerk during the 2005-06 campaign, his final year in Rochester, scoring five goals and adding 19 assists for 24 points in 71 games. He would also go on to appear in five NHL playoff games for the Sabres, scoring what would be his only NHL postseason goal.\n\nJanik departed the organization the following year and would spend the next six seasons with four different NHL organizations and their AHL affiliates. Janik split the 2013-14 season in the AHL between San Antonio and Chicago before playing one final year overseas. He retired following the 2014-15 campaign having played more than 870 professional games and 251 career points between the NHL, AHL and Europe.\n\nJanik would also spend a four-year stint as an assistant coach with AHL's Springfield Thunderbirds.\n\nSteve Langdon\n\nRochester Americans Right Wing, 1974-79\n\nSteve Langdon spent five of his six pro seasons in Rochester from 1974 to 1979, and much like Janik, helped the team to four straight playoff appearances, including a trip to the Calder Cup Finals in 1977. In 313 career games with the Amerks, Langdon scored 97 goals, ranking him 20th all-time, and added 87 assists for 184 points. He also recorded 14 points (3+11) in 35 postseason appearances.\n\nLangdon’s tenure in Rochester coincided over the Amerks’ five-year affiliation with the Boston Bruins, the team that drafted him 63rd overall in the 1973 NHL Draft. The Toronto, Ontario, native broke into professional hockey with the Albuquerque Six-Guns of the Central Hockey League in 1973-74. Langdon arrived in Rochester the following season, putting up 19 points (8+11) in 56 games while also making his NHL debut that year with Boston, appearing in one game for the Don Cherry-coached Bruins.\n\nDuring the 1975-76 season, Langdon more than doubled his goal output from the previous year before helping the Amerks to their second playoff appearance in as many years under the Boston affiliation.\n\nAfter leading the Amerks to the Calder Cup Finals in 1977, Langdon enjoyed his best season in 1977-78, finishing third on the team with a career-high 30 goals and fifth with 57 points, leading the Amerks to their fourth straight playoff appearance. He would play one final season with the Amerks in 1978-79, scoring 25 more goals, appearing in all 80 games while serving as team captain. He closed out his career in Rochester ranked 35th in scoring among all-time forwards.\n\nHe went onto to appear in seven career games with the Bruins, recording one assist, as well as three games for the Broome County Dusters of the North American Hockey League.\n\nLangdon’s contributions to the organization extend off the ice as well, and for the past several years, has made a strong commitment to give back to the Rochester community through his work within the Amerks Alumni Association.\n\nAfter retiring from the game as a player, Langdon served as a coach and administrator in Rochester Youth Hockey for over 20 years. He also founded the Stephanie Langdon Hockey School with the help of the Alumni. Over a five-year period, the program raised over $30,000 for the Golisano Children’s Hospital, in memory of his daughter.\n\nFor the past several years, Langdon has been instrumental in building and maintaining a network of local Amerks Alumni and has spearheaded numerous charitable endeavors, most notably the Thomas M. Nichols Scholarship Fund, which awards a scholarship to a local high school senior that actively participates in Section V hockey and displays excellence in their work ethic, character and determination.\n\nHe recently fostered a relationship between the Alumni and Oasis Adaptive Sports, a local organization that offers instruction, equipment and support to disabled military veterans in a variety of recreational sporting activities. Langdon, with the assistance of Alumni members, introduce hockey to the veterans and their families by providing on-ice instruction through their “Learn to Skate” program. His philanthropic and outreach efforts also extend to the Veteran Outreach Center, the Finger Lakes Donor Recovery Network and the annual Amerks Alumni Golf Tournament, which just celebrated its sixth year, and continues to generate thousands of dollars in support of other local charitable organizations.\n\nMartin Biron\n\nRochester Americans Goaltender, 1997-2001\n\nMartin Biron backstopped the Amerks for parts of four seasons from 1997 to 2001, during which he compiled a 59-32-9 career record with a .921 save percentage and a 2.36 goals-against average, which ranks 12th among all goaltenders in franchise history.\n\nA native of Lac-Saint-Charles, Quebec, Biron played his first full professional season with the Amerks during the 1997-98 campaign, posting a 14-18-6 record while appearing in 41 of Rochester’s 80 games that year. He also became just the second netminder in franchise history to record five shutouts in his first season with the team, a feat originally accomplished by Gerry McNeil in 1957-58, and that would soon be matched just two years later by former teammate Mika Noronen.\n\nBiron’s best season as an Amerk came the next year during the 1998-99 campaign when he appeared in 52 of Rochester’s 80 games, finishing with a 36-13-3 overall record while setting the franchise mark for the lowest goals-against average (2.07) and highest save percentage (.930), the latter of which also tied an AHL record. For his efforts, Biron was named the recipient of the AHL’s top two goaltending awards – the Aldedge (Baz) Bastien Memorial Award, presented annually to the goaltender voted best at his position, and the Harry (Hap) Holmes Memorial Award, which recognizes a team’s goaltender(s) with the fewest number of goals-against per game who has appeared in at least 25 games during the regular season. He also represented Rochester at the 1999 AHL All-Star Game and would later be named to the AHL’s First All-Star Team at the conclusion of the regular season.\n\nThe former first-round pick of the Buffalo Sabres became just the second netminder in team history to post six shutouts in a single season that year, matching the then franchise record originally set by Amerks Hall of Famer Bobby Perreault in 1967-68.\n\nBiron played his final season in Rochester in 2000-01 while also splitting time with the Buffalo Sabres, concluding his Amerks career with 2,761 saves and 13 shutouts in 103 games in the red, white and blue. His 13 shutouts are still the fourth-most among any Rochester goaltender in the 62-year history of the franchise.\n\nAfter making 68 NHL appearances for the Buffalo Sabres between 1995 and 2001, Biron made a permanent jump to the NHL beginning in 2001-02 when he took over the starting goaltending duties for the Sabres. He finished the year with a career-best 2.22 goals-against average in 72 games for Buffalo, in addition to setting NHL career-highs in wins (28), saves (1,630) and shutouts (6).\n\nAfter departing Buffalo midway through the 2006-07 season, Biron closed out his 16-year playing career with stops in Philadelphia, the New Islanders and the New York Rangers. He retired following the 2013-14 NHL season with a 230-191-52 record and 28 career shutouts to go along with a 2.61 goals-against average and a .910 save percentage.\n\nBiron served as the director of goaltending at the Academy of Hockey at HarborCenter and is now in his fourth season working alongside Brian Duff for all Sabres TV broadcasts on MSG.\n\nScott Nichol\n\nRochester Americans Center, 1994-2000\n\nScott Nichol played parts of six seasons for the Amerks from 1994-95 to 1999-00 and helped Rochester capture the 1996 Calder Cup championship during the team’s impressive run of six straight postseason appearances. In 326 career games with the Amerks, Nichol amassed 173 points on 80 goals and 93 assists while also adding 19 points (9+10) in 34 playoff contests in the red, white and blue. A two-time former captain, Nichol’s 173 points rank 37th all-time among Amerks forwards and his 813 penalty minutes are seventh-most in franchise history. In addition, he was named the organization’s recipient of the McCulloch Trophy for the 1997-98 season for his dedicated service to the Rochester community.\n\nAn 11th-round pick of the Buffalo Sabres in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft, Nichol joined the Amerks for the 1994-95 campaign after playing just two seasons of junior hockey for the Portland Winterhawks of the WHL. In his first season with the Amerks, the Edmonton, Alberta, native recorded 27 points (11+16) and finished fourth on the team with 136 penalty minutes while appearing in all but nine games for Rochester.\n\nHe upped his offensive contributions the following year to 31 points (14+17) in 62 games as he and the Amerks made a late-season surge during their unprecedented run to the Calder Cup Finals despite a third-place finish in the regular season. Nichol recorded 13 points (7+6) in the playoffs with perhaps his biggest goal as an Amerk coming in overtime in Game 5 against the Portland Pirates to give Rochester a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series. He also made his NHL debut that season, appearing in two games for the Buffalo Sabres.\n\nNichol enjoyed his best season in Rochester in 1996-97 when he set career-highs in goals (22), assists (21) and points (43) to rank tied for seventh on the team in scoring. He went on to add 71 more points (33+38) over 124 games over his final three seasons with the Amerks, which included another trip to the Calder Cup Finals in 2000.\n\nAfter departing Rochester following the 1999-00 campaign, Nichol rounded out his 20-year playing career by scoring 127 points (56+71) over 662 NHL games with stops in Buffalo, Calgary, Chicago, Nashville, San Jose and St. Louis. Perennially one of the NHL’s top face-off men, Nichol led the league in face-off efficiency in 2007-08 with Nashville and again during the 2009-10 season with San Jose. He enjoyed success in the playoffs, helping his teams advance to the postseason in six of his final eight seasons, including back-to-back trips to the Western Conference Finals with San Jose, before hanging up his skates for good at the end of the 2012-13 campaign.\n\nImmediately following his retirement, Nichol returned to the Nashville Predators organization as the team’s director of player development before being promoted to assistant general manager. He also currently serves as the general manager of the MIlwaukee Admirals, Nashville's AHL affiliate, and remains actively involved in the Rochester Americans Alumni Association.\n\nKevin Oklobzija\n\nBeat Reporter for the Democrat and Chronicle, 1986-2017\n\nKeviin Oklobzija holds the distinction of becoming just the second reporter in franchise history to earn the honors and first since Hans Tanner was inducted as part of the inaugural class of 1986.\n\n“When I look at the members of the Amerks Hall of Fame, the true stalwarts, builders and champions of this franchise, I’m quite sure I don’t belong alongside them, especially since I merely chronicled the endeavors and exploits of those who wore the Amerks sweater,” said Oklobzija. “Covering this team and the American Hockey League for 31-plus seasons was much more of an honor and privilege than it was a job or vocation, and the passion and loyalty of the legions of fans fueled my desire to tell stories and inform.”\n\nOklobzija’s first-rate coverage of the team spanned more than four decades during his 31-plus years with the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle Media Group. Since taking on the Amerks beat prior to the 1985-86 season, the Minnesota native has had the privilege of covering two Calder Cup championships (1987 and 1996) and 23 of the team’s 44 playoff appearances, including five other trips to the Calder Cup Finals. Additionally, Oklobzija has witnessed and covered four ownership changes, eight Division Championships, two regular season point championships, the continuation of hockey’s longest standing relationship between an NHL club and its AHL affiliate following the long-awaited reunion of the Amerks and Buffalo Sabres in the summer of 2011 and has worked with 10 different Amerks head coaches during his tenure. Adding to his list of professional hockey coverage includes four of the five most recent Winter Olympiads (Nagano, Japan in 1998; Salt Lake City, Utah in 2002; Torino, Italy in 2006; Sochi, Russia in 2014) for the USA Today Sports Group.\n\nA two-time winner of the American Hockey League’s James H. Ellery Award (1992-93, 1995-96) for outstanding media coverage in the newspaper category, Oklobzija provided consistent and first-rate coverage of the Amerks and the American Hockey League in an ever-evolving industry. In addition to providing game stories, player features, previews and daily practice coverage of the Amerks for the newspaper, Oklobzija also utilized the emergence of digital media to keep the fans closely engaged and informed. His blog, appropriately named the “Hockey O-Zone,” was the most-read sports blog on democratandchronicle.com since its launch prior to the 2008-09 season, and provided fans with daily notes, quotes and anecdotes, while his utilization of Twitter to cover the team enhanced the overall media coverage of the Amerks.\n\nOklobzija also implemented the use of video along with his traditional methods in an effort to expand and diversify his online coverage of the team. He regularly introduced player interview videos to supplement his game stories, contributed hockey content to the D&C’s “ROC Sports Talk” podcast, and most recently, played an instrumental role in bringing Amerks game highlights to the paper’s website. Oklobzija also hosted, along with Amerks Hall of Famer Jody Gage, a meet-and-greet for fans on the concourse of The Blue Cross Arena prior to the home opener for each of the last two seasons so he could talk hockey and preview the season with Amerks fans.\n\nIn recent years, Oklobzija’s beat expanded to include not just the Amerks but the entire local hockey scene as well as Rochester’s Triple-A baseball team, but his coverage of the Amerks over the years has been a staple in Rochester sports.\n\nChris Taylor\n\nRochester Americans Center, 1999-2011\n\nRochester Amerians Assistant Coach, 2011-16\n\nRochester Americans Head Coach, 2017-20\n\nChris Taylor spent a total of 17 seasons with the Rochester Americans as either a player or coach, marking one of the longest runs with the organization in franchise history.\n\nTaylor enjoyed a 19-year professional career that saw him become one of the all-time greats in an Amerks uniform. After spending parts of nine seasons with the Amerks between 1999 and 2011, Taylor finished his career ranked among the franchise’s all-time leaders in assists (3rd, 339), games played (4th, 519), points (5th, 481) and goals (10th, 142). He also served as team captain during the 2004-05 and 2005-06 seasons and was an alternate captain during several other campaigns. Taylor received perhaps the highest honor of his career during the 2014-15 season when he was unanimously inducted into the Amerks Hall of Fame on Jan. 10, 2015 in his first year of eligibility, becoming the 56th member of the prestigious club.\n\nA member of the Amerks’ 50th Anniversary Team, Taylor is also a three-time Amerks team MVP and scoring champion (2001-02, 2002-03, 2004-05) and is the only player in franchise history to achieve those two feats in the same season on three occasions. During his final season as a player in 2010-11, Taylor ranked second on the Amerks in scoring with 51 points (10+41) in 72 games. He also finished second on the team in scoring the previous year with 61 points (17+44) when he returned to Rochester following a three-year stint in Germany, where he played for the Frankfurt Lions.\n\nDuring the 2004-05 campaign, Taylor led the Amerks with 79 points (21+58) in 79 games to help the Amerks capture the MacGregor Kilpatrick Trophy for the AHL’s best regular season record and he was honored with the AHL’s Fred T. Hunt Award for sportsmanship, determination and dedication to the game of hockey. Taylor also shares the franchise record for most assists in a single game with six, set on Oct. 21, 2005.\n\nDuring his pro career, Taylor appeared in 149 NHL games with the New York Islanders, Boston Bruins and Buffalo Sabres, recording 32 points (11+21) and 48 PIM. Of those 149 games, 90 came in a Buffalo uniform. In 2003-04, he set NHL career-highs in games played (54), goals (6), assists (6) and points (12) while with the Sabres.\n\nPrior to joining the Sabres/Amerks organization in 1999, Taylor won two Turner Cup Championships with Denver and Utah of the International Hockey League. The Stratford, Ontario native was originally drafted by the Islanders in the second round (27th overall) of the 1990 NHL Entry Draft and finished his pro career with 1,297 games played at the NHL, AHL, IHL and European levels.\n\nUpon his retirement as a player, Taylor shifted into a coaching role, first joining the Amerks staff as development coach prior to the 2011-12 season. He was soon elevated to assistant coach midway through the 2012-13 season before returning as head coach prior to the start of the 2017-18 campaign, becoming the 32nd head coach in team history and just the 12th former Amerk to get named to the position.\n\nIn three seasons at the helm of the Amerks, Taylor compiled a 116-65-33 record and led Rochester to back-to-back Calder Cup Playoff appearances. During his final season, he was named as the head coach of the North Division team for the 2020 AHL All-Star Classic in Ontario, Calif., becoming the first Amerks head coach to represent Rochester at an AHL All-Star event since John Tortorella in 1997.\n\nExcluding the 2016-17 season, when he led the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins to an AHL-best 51-20-3-2 overall record as an assistant coach, the Amerks have finished in third place or better in the AHL’s North Division standings and advanced to the postseason in five of the eight years with Taylor on the coaching staff.\n\nDarcy Wakaluk\n\nRochester Americans Goaltender, 1986-91\n\nIn parts of five seasons with the Amerks from 1986-87 to 1990-91, Darcy Wakaluk appeared in 181 games while posting a record of 81-57-13 with a 3.36 goals-against average, a .884 save percentage and seven shutouts. His 81 wins rank fifth all-time in franchise history.\n\nIn 36 playoff games, Wakaluk finished with an outstanding 21-12 record for the Amerks to go along with a 3.40 goals-against average and a .875 save percentage. During the team’s run to the Calder Cup championship in 1987, Wakaluk won both games in which he started while appearing in five games. In 1990, he went 10-6 while helping the Amerks come within two wins of another Calder Cup before falling in the Finals to Springfield. The following spring, Wakaluk went 6-3 in the postseason as the Amerks once again advanced to the Calder Cup Finals before losing to Springfield.\n\nIn 1989-90, Wakaluk posted a record of 31-16-4 to set a career-high for wins while also ranking fifth in the AHL with a 3.35 goals-against average. The following season, he shared the Harry “Hap” Holmes Memorial Award, given annually to the AHL’s outstanding goaltenders, with teammate David Littman as Wakaluk ranked second among AHL netminders with a 2.99 goals against average.\n\nAside from his stellar record between the pipes for the Amerks, Wakaluk even contributed offensively and is perhaps best remembered for becoming the first goaltender in North American professional hockey to score a goal by shooting the puck into the net during a game against the Utica Devils on Dec. 5, 1987. Just three days later, Philadelphia Flyers goalie Ron Hextall repeated the feat, becoming the first National Hockey League netminder to score a goal. Wakaluk owns the Amerks franchise record for most career points by a goalie with one goal and 16 assists.\n\nWakaluk, a native of Pincher Creek, Alberta, is just the fourth goaltender to be inducted into the Amerks Hall of Fame in the 56-year history of the franchise, joining Bobby Perreault, Gerry Cheevers and Jacques Cloutier.\n\nDoug Houda\n\nRochester Americans Defenseman, 1995-96; 1999-2003\n\nRochester Americans Assistant Coach, 2003-06\n\nDoug Houda spent a total of eight seasons with the Rochester Americans as either a player or assistant coach.\n\nThe gritty, hard-nosed defenseman joined former teammate Randy Cunneyworth on the Amerks coaching staff three seasons after serving as the team’s captain his final year of playing in 2002-03. The Amerks had a 125-86-16-13 record over his three seasons as an assistant coach, including a 51-19-4-6 record and a franchise-record of 112 points in 2004-05, which was the top record in the American Hockey League that season. Houda also had the distinction of coaching Rochester’s 50th anniversary team in 2005-06, which comprised former NHLers Clarke MacArthur, Chris Thorburn, Nathan Paetsch, Jason Pominville, Derek Roy and silver-medal winning netminder Ryan Miller.\n\nDuring his playing career, Houda logged 1,114 games over the span of 17 professional seasons. A total of 561 of those games were spent in the National Hockey League with the Buffalo Sabres, Detroit Red Wings, Hartford Whalers, New York Islanders, Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks. The Blairmore, Alberta, native would go on to score 19 goals and 63 assists for 82 points, while compiling 1,104 NHL career penalty minutes.\n\nAfter making his pro debut in the 1985-86 campaign, “Houds” officially made the jump to the pros in 1986-87 in the AHL, where he would split his career between the Adirondack Red Wings and Rochester. During his tenure in the AHL, Houda recorded 238 points (55+183) in 550 games, 284 of those in the red, white and blue over the parts of five seasons (1995-96, 1999-2003.) The blueliner registered 23 goals and 87 assists as an Amerk, and his 683 penalty minutes still stand 11th best on the Amerks all-time list. In the postseason, he notched 19 points (4+15) in 49 games, including eight (3+5) in the 1996 playoffs to help guide Rochester to its sixth and most recent Calder Cup championship – one he recalls as his best memory with the Amerks.\n\nAfter leaving Rochester for the next three years, Houda would return to the Flower City for the 1999-00 season, playing in all but one regular season game before appearing in 21 postseason outings to lead the Amerks to the Calder Cup Finals. Houda was named Rochester’s Unsung Hero that year as the Amerks won the Empire Division and Western Conference Championship, playing a large role in the team’s run at the Calder Cup, finishing 12th on the team in points (24) and third among team defensemen.\n\nHe posted his best season as an Amerk in 2001-02, where he finished second on the team in points among team defensemen with 28 (6+22) in 64 appearances. In 2002-03, Houda would again finish the season second among Amerk blueliners in scoring with 25 points (3+22), while finishing third with 191 penalty minutes and team-best plus-17 on-ice rating.\n\nAdding to his resume of professional accomplishments includes earning a selection as an AHL First Team All-Star with the Adirondack Red Wings in 1987-88, just his second season of pro hockey. That very same year, he scored his first-ever NHL goal with the Detroit in a game against Philadelphia on December 11th. He skated in his first NHL game against Minnesota on December 10th, 1985, almost two years to the day of his milestone goal.\n\nHouda was originally drafted by the Red Wings with the second overall pick (28th overall) in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft. He played junior hockey with Calgary of the Western Hockey League.\n\nAfter leaving the coaching scene in Rochester in 2006, Houda would spend the next 10 years as an assistant coach with the Boston Bruins and is currently in his fifth in the same capacity with the Detroit Red Wings.\n\nDon Stevens\n\nPlay-by-Play Broadcaster, 1986- Present\n\nThe 2020-21 season marks Don Stevens’ remarkable 35th season as the “Voice of the Rochester Americans.” Stevens has seen many changes in the AHL since he first put on the headphones and called his first Amerks game at the old Rochester War Memorial. Known as the “Dean of AHL Broadcasters,” Stevens has witnessed the expansion of the league to an all-time high 32 teams and the explosion of media coverage of the AHL.\n\nThe Amerks’ broadcaster has served the team in numerous capacities during his tenure, including public relations director, TV host, radio talk show host, and TV and radio play-by-play broadcaster. In addition, Stevens founded the AHL Broadcasters/Writers Association and served as its president.\n\nThe “Voice of the Amerks” calls games on the new radio home of the Amerks, 95.7 FM/950 AM ESPN Rochester, in addition to calling select home games live on the MSG Network. He teams up with color analyst and former Buffalo Sabre Ric Seiling to bring AHL games to the City of Rochester and around the country. Stevens also had the distinction of covering the Amerks on multiple occasions over the NHL Network and SiriusXM Satellite Radio, introducing Amerks hockey on both a national and international level.\n\nIn 2009-10, Stevens called Rochester’s historic 2,000th franchise win as the Amerks joined an elite club, becoming just the second team in the American Hockey League and eighth overall in North American hockey history to achieve the feat. He was also behind the microphone for five of the 13 goals scored by an AHL goaltender, most recently in 2010-11 when Binghamton’s Chris Holt fired in an empty-netter against Rochester.\n\nStevens’ most memorable season with the organization came during the 2010-11 campaign, his 25th with the red, white and blue. Stevens’ years of dedicated service to the club was acknowledged with his enshrinement in the team’s prestigious Hall of Fame as part of the Class of 2011. As the 50th member of the Hall, and just the second broadcaster inducted, Stevens joined an elite group of individuals whose tireless contributions and commitment to the franchise matches those of the original 1956 Rochester Americans.\n\nFrom 1996-2009, Stevens maintained a dual role while also serving as the broadcaster for the Rochester Rhinos (United Soccer League). With the Rhinos, Stevens was part of back-to-back regular season championships (1998-99), three A-League championships in four years (1998, 1999 and 2001), the 1999 U.S. Open Cup and 14 consecutive playoff runs during his tenure. In 1998, he even covered an Amerks hockey game and the Rhinos’ championship game on the same day. Stevens was inducted into the Rhinos Hall of Fame on Sept. 24, 2016 during halftime of the club's final regular-season home matchup, becoming the first broadcaster in Rhinos team history to earn the honors.\n\nThroughout his career, he has received numerous awards for his work on radio and television. In 1993-94, he won the AHL’s James H. Ellery Award, given to the person that has made outstanding contributions to the progress of the AHL for his work on the Amerks Radio Network. Stevens has also won a national ACE Award for Cable Excellence as the host of the weekly television show, “Amerks Report,” and received the Rochester Press-Radio Club’s Louis MacMillan Award for sportscasting excellence.\n\nIn 2003, he was inducted into the Frontier Field Walk of Fame in the media category. The Walk of Fame is located inside Frontier Field and features the names of fans, players, contributors and media throughout Rochester’s sports history. Following the 2012-13 season, Stevens’ 27th as the Amerks play-by-play man, he was again awarded with the AHL’s prestigious James H. Ellery Memorial Award for excellence in radio coverage for the second time in his career.\n\nMost recently, in June of 2018, Stevens was named the recipient of the 2018 Gary Smith and George Beahon Sports Media Excellence Award at the 72nd annual Press-Radio Club Dinner held in downtown Rochester. This past season, he was honored as the 2020 Sportsperson of the Year by the Rochester St. Patrick’s Day Parade Committee.\n\nWith the Amerks, Stevens has broadcast seven Calder Cup Finals and the Spengler Cup in Switzerland, winning a pair of Calder Cup championships in the process. Stevens has taken the AHL to its highest level during the course of his career and has shown his true professionalism by working with younger broadcasters throughout the league. Each season he has made it a point to “promote the Rochester Americans and the American Hockey League,” from his seat in the radio booth to the podium at numerous charity events.\n\nDuring his career, broadcasting has taken the Wainwright, Alberta, native all over the United States, Canada and Europe. He has worked in such markets as Seattle, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Phoenix and Rochester.\n\nTHE DON STEVENS’ FILE:\n\nTOP FIVE MOST MEMORABLE MOMENTS\n\n1.) “My first season was 86-87, and there was a memorable moment in my very first game at the War Memorial. Shane Churla (Binghamton) went up on the stage after some of the fans.”\n\n2.) “Since then, there have been lots of memorable moments. One of the best was going to the championship in my first year and winning it at Sherbrooke and coming home to the thousands of people at the airport at 4:00 in the morning.”\n\n3.) “That same season at Binghamton, beating the Rangers on the last night of the season in a shootout, to win the regular season championship.”\n\n4.) “Going to the finals seven times in my first 14 years in Rochester is just an incredible statistic.”\n\n5.) “Calling the first ever goal scored by a goalie by ‘shooting’ it directly into the net (Darcy Wakaluk in Utica), about a week before Ron Hextall did it (for the Philadelphia Flyers). In fact, I called the first four goalie goals in league history - two for (Wakaluk & Robb Stauber) and two against.”\n\nRandy Cunneyworth\n\nRochester Americans Left Wing, 1980-85; 1998-2000\n\nRochester Americans head Coach, 2000-08; 2015-16\n\nRandy Cunneyworth stands as one of the most decorated players and coaches in Rochester Americans history. In all, he spent 16 seasons with the Amerks, seven as a player and nine as a head coach over two separate stints, and collectively has over 1,000 career games in the red, white and blue.\n\nAs a player, Cunneyworth owns the distinction of being one of only a few players to begin and end his playing career in Rochester, while also beginning his head coaching career with the Amerks. He is the only man to accomplish that feat in the 65-year history of the Amerks.\n\nHis coaching exploits were as legendary as his playing career. Cunneyworth remains the longest tenured and the most winningest coach all-time in franchise history, having accumulated 340 career coaching victories over his nine seasons as Rochester’s bench boss from 2000-08 and then again from 2015-16. He also guided Rochester to six playoff appearances, including each of his first five years behind the bench.\n\nAfter serving as the development coach for the Buffalo Sabres in 2013-14, Cunneyworth returned for his second stint as head coach of the Amerks in 2015-16 in what would be a record-setting season for the Etobicoke, Ontario, native. On March 23, 2016, Cunneyworth became the franchise’s all-time leader in coaching wins after leading the Amerks to a 6-5 come-from-behind win over the St. John’s IceCaps, surpassing former Calder Cup-winning head coach and fellow Hall of Famer John Van Boxmeer with his 338th career victory in Rochester. He would add two more victories by season’s end, finishing his tenure with a 340-311-65 career record (.541 percentage) over 716 games. He also added an 18-22 record in 40 playoff contests.\n\nCunneyworth served as interim head coach for the NHL’s Montreal Canadiens during the 2011-12 campaign. After starting the season as an assistant coach, Cunneyworth was promoted to interim head coach on Dec. 17, 2011 and guided the Canadiens to an 18-23-9 record in 50 games. His tenure in the Montreal organization also featured a one-year stint as head coach of the AHL’s Hamilton Bulldogs, whom he guided to a first-place finish in the AHL’s North Division followed by a trip to the Western Conference Final during the 2011 Calder Cup Playoffs.\n\nIn 10 totals seasons as an AHL head coach with Rochester and Hamilton, Cunneyworth compiled a record of 384-343-69 in 796 games, ranking fifth in games coached and eighth in wins.\n\nPrior to his time with the Canadiens organization, Cunneyworth spent two seasons as an assistant coach for the Atlanta Thrashers (2008-09 and 2009-10). He began his coaching career as a player-assistant coach with the Amerks under former head coach Brian McCutcheon during the 1999-00 AHL season and helped the team to an appearance in the Calder Cup Final. Upon his retirement as a player, he was hired by the Amerks to serve as head coach the following season and retained that post for eight seasons, the longest consecutive tenure of any coach in team history.\n\nDuring the 2006-07 season, Cunneyworth became only the second coach in team history to work 500 career games. He also passed legendary coach Joe Crozier for second place on Rochester’s all-time wins list.\n\nCunneyworth’s most successful season at the helm of the Amerks came during the 2004-05 campaign, when he guided Rochester to an AHL-best 51-19-6-4 record (112 points). In addition to earning the Louis A.R. Pieri Award as the AHL’s Coach of the Year, the Amerks set several single-season franchise records, including most points (112) and the longest home winning streak which saw Rochester win 17 consecutive home games between Dec. 17 and Mar. 4.\n\nAs a player, Cunneyworth had an NHL career that spanned parts of 16 seasons, including three as team captain of the Ottawa Senators. He began his NHL career with the Sabres in 1980-81 after the team selected him in the eighth round of the 1980 NHL Entry Draft and returned to Buffalo in the 1998-99 season for what would be his final NHL season. In 866 career NHL games with Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Winnipeg, Hartford, Chicago and Ottawa, Cunneyworth registered 414 points on 189 goals and 225 assists along with 1,280 penalty minutes.\n\nAside from two games with the Springfield Indians, Cunneyworth spent his entire American Hockey League career in Rochester. He began his career with the Amerks as a rookie in 1980-81 and went on to record 239 points (101+138) in 377 games over parts of seven seasons, highlighted by a Calder Cup championship in 1982-83. Cunneyworth would spend two more seasons with the Amerks before departing for the NHL in 1985-86, where he would remain for the next 13 seasons. He would ultimately find his way back to the Sabres in 1998-99, helping Buffalo to the 1999 Stanley Cup Final while also taking the Amerks to the Calder Cup Final that same year and again in 2000 as a player-coach for Rochester.\n\nDuring the 1990-00 season, his final as a player, he was named captain of Team Canada for the 2000 Kodak AHL All-Star Classic held in Rochester and he was the recipient of the of the Fred T. Hunt Memorial Award for his sportsmanship, determination and dedication to hockey.\n\nCunneyworth retired from hockey following the 1999-00 season, ending his career in Rochester ranked 13th on the franchise’s all-time games played list (377) and 19th in goals (101) while finishing 22nd among all-time forwards in points (239). He transitioned into coaching the following year, becoming the 26th head coach in franchise history.\n\nKent Weisbeck\n\nAthletic Trainer, 1985-Present\n\nKent Weisbeck enters his 36th season as an Athletic Trainer for the Rochester Americans. In the past 35 years, Weisbeck has worked more than 2,500 games, earned two Calder Cup rings (1987 and 1996) and has worked in the Calder Cup Finals on five other occasions.\n\nOn March 10, 2019, Weisbeck worked his remarkable 2,500th game with Amerks. Prior to the game against Binghamton, the organization honored him with a plaque and custom jersey commemorating his career milestone.\n\nDuring the 2016 offseason, the longtime member of the Amerks organization was honored by the Professional Hockey Athletic Trainers Society/Society of Professional Hockey Equipment Managers (PHATS/SPHEM) with the Career Achievement Alumni Award in recognition of his dedication and excellence in his field. In August of 2016, Weisbeck was inducted into the Frontier Field Walk of Fame as a member of the Class of 2016. Since 1997, a special section at the center of Frontier Field's Walk of Fame has been designated to Rochester's sports legends. These individuals (fans, players, management and media spanning Rochester's sports history) are those who have made a monumental impact on the community through their achievements in the Rochester-area sports scene.\n\nDuring the 2009-10 season, his 25th consecutive year of service to the organization, “Snacky” became the first-ever athletic trainer in the 65-year history of the franchise to be inducted into the Amerks Hall of Fame. He was honored as the 48th member of the prestigious club, joining former Amerks head coach Randy Cunneyworth and Jim Wiemer as part of the Class of 2010.\n\nWeisbeck worked one day in the NHL with the Buffalo Sabres, but the rest of his hours, days and years have been in Rochester. On October 23, 2010, Weisbeck reached a professional milestone working in his 2,000th game. The team honored him on November 7, 2010 with a plaque and fitted him with the first Blue Jacket, an honor bestowed to Weisbeck by then team owner Curt Styres as a testament to his personal milestone.\n\nWeisbeck has twice had the distinction of serving as a trainer at the AHL All-Star Classic. His first time on the bench came during the 2000 All-Star Classic hosted in Rochester at The Blue Cross Arena. He was also selected as head athletic trainer for the Western Conference All-Star team for the 2011 AHL All-Star Classic in Hershey. He was selected by the American Hockey League based upon his many years of excellence and dedicated service to the AHL and the City of Rochester.\n\nThe Buffalo, NY, native graduated from the University at Buffalo in 1977 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physical education with a minor in athletic training. After graduating from UB, he stayed at the university to work as an assistant athletic trainer from 1977-1985. In 1985, he made the jump to the AHL and the Amerks.\n\nLarry Hillman\n\nRochester Americans Defenseman, 1961-62, 1963-68\n\nLarry Hillman was inducted into the Amerks’ Hall of Fame for his stellar six seasons (1961-62, 1963-68) with the Rochester Americans, scoring 14 goals and adding 108 assists for 122 points in 169 games. At the time of his induction, he still ranked 12th on the team’s all-time points list for defensemen. Hillman also helped the Amerks win their first Calder Cup in 1964-65 as the team’s captain. In addition, he earned First Team AHL All-Star honors that season.\n\nHillman was not around for the Amerks’ Cup runs in 1966 and 1968 because he was helping the Toronto Maple Leafs win four Cups over a six-year period. After leaving Rochester, Hillman found success wherever he played. That Calder Cup championship was the second of 10 championships he would be a part of in his 24 years in professional hockey, 22 as a player and two as a head coach. To go along with the one Calder Cup, he won six Stanley Cups (1955, 1962-64, 1967 and 1969), two Avco Cups (1977-78) and was part of a third Western Hockey Association title (1979). He also holds two places in Stanley Cup history, as the youngest player to be engraved on the Cup (18 years, two months and nine days) and the first player to win Cups with three organizations. He was also the recipient of the Eddie Shore Award, honored as the American Hockey League’s best defenseman, during the 1959-60 season after scoring a career best 12 goals along with 43 points in 70 games with the Providence Reds.\n\nHe won his first Cup in 1955 with the Detroit Red Wings just after his 18th birthday. Hillman joined the Red Wings from the Hamilton Tiger Cubs of the Ontario Hockey Association. Thus, he established a record that can never be broken because of current National Hockey League rules. The rule states that a player must be 18 by September 15th to be eligible to play in the NHL that season. Hillman also made history by winning his final Stanley Cup in 1969 with the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nThe 1967 Cup was the most thrilling for Hillman, as Toronto defeated Montreal and Chicago each in six games. That playoff, defensemen Marcel Pronovost and Hillman did not allow an even-strength goal throughout the playoffs. The Cup was also the last for the Leafs and the last before the NHL expanded to 12 teams.\n\nIn his career, the Kirkland Lake, Ontario, native played in 791 NHL games with teams in Detroit, Boston, Toronto, Minnesota, Montreal, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Buffalo. During his tour in the NHL he scored 36 goals and added 196 assists for 232 points. Hillman also appeared in 74 NHL postseason games, tallying two goals and nine assists for 11 points.\n\nGates Orlando\n\nRochester Americans Right Wing, 1983-88\n\nGates Orlando entered the Hall of Fame after an impressive career that spanned parts of 15 seasons and included a Calder Cup championship and two trips to the Winter Olympics.\n\nThe Montreal native was selected by the Buffalo Sabres in the eighth round (164th overall) of the 1981 NHL Entry Draft. Orlando’s journey began at Providence College and landed the first-year pro in Rochester in 1983-84. In the regular season he recorded 15 points in 11 games and was clutch in the playoffs, scoring 14 points in 18 games as Rochester advanced to the Calder Cup Finals.\n\nIt was a sign of things to come for Orlando, whose Rochester career covered five seasons (1983-1988). The right wing amassed 64 goals and 92 assists for 156 points in 120 games. He also appeared in 45 playoff games and recorded a point per game, notching 15 goals and 30 assists. In 1986-87, he was a member of the Amerks’ fifth Calder Cup team. That season was also his best offensively, as he played in 44 games and recorded 22 goals and 42 assists during the regular season. In the Amerks’ march to the Calder Cup, he recorded nine goals and 13 assists in 18 games.\n\nWhile with the Amerks, Orlando was also often called up by Buffalo and played in 98 NHL games in his career. He scored 18 goals with 26 assists from 1984-87.\n\nFollowing the 1986-87 season, Orlando began his international career. In 1987-88 he began the season in Italy before returning to finish the season with the Amerks. He then spent the next 279 out of 280 regular season games playing overseas. His lone North American game was his last in 2003-04, with the Albany River Rats of the AHL.\n\nOrlando starred in Italy (1987-94) with the HC Meran, Bolzano and Milano Devils teams. Internationally he excelled for Italy at the \"B\" Pool World Championships. He was named the best forward at the 1990 tournament and selected to the all-star team when he led Italy to the \"B\" Pool title in 1991 and promotion to the \"A\" flight.\n\nBetween 1992 and 1998, Orlando represented Italy at seven consecutive \"A\" Pool World Championships. He also took part in the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics and the 1998 Nagano Games and was a domestic star for the Swiss team SC Bern.\n\nSince his playing days, he has been the head coach of the Adirondack IceHawks, worked as an assistant coach for the Albany River Rats and served as a professional scout for the New Jersey Devils.\n\nJohn Bednarski\n\nRochester Americans Defenseman, 1972-73; 1980-81\n\nRochester Americans Broadcaster and Humanitarian, 1985-05\n\nJohn Bednarski is in the Amerks’ Hall of Fame for his role as a defenseman, color commentator and humanitarian. The Thunder Bay, Ontario, native played in two seasons with the Amerks (1972-73, 1980-81), served as Amerks color commentator (radio and TV analyst) for 20 years (1985-2005) and helped establish the Cystic Fibrosis Golf Tournament and The Amerks at Your Service Dinner.\n\nDuring his playing days, Bednarski was a four-time American Hockey League All-Star, spending time in Rochester, New Haven, Adirondack, Providence and Erie. He played in 704 professional games and collected 104 goals, 339 assists and 1,397 penalty minutes. He also appeared in 100 National Hockey League games, spending 99 of them with the New York Rangers.\n\nHis began his professional career in Rochester in 1972-73. In his first season, he was part of one of the most memorable teams in franchise history. During the 1972-73 campaign, the independent Amerks and head coach Don Cherry restored winning hockey to Rochester. The Amerks, competing with a collection of castoffs and hard-working players, finished in third place in the Eastern Division and returned to the playoffs for the first time in four seasons. The Amerks fell in six games to Boston with Bednarski collecting nine points (1+8) in six postseason games. During his two seasons with the Amerks he scored 17 goals and added 42 assists for 59 points in 148 games.\n\nHe spent the next two seasons (1973-74 and 1974-75) with the Providence Reds. In 1973-74 he led the league in penalty minutes with 222 and was named a Second Team All-Star. After five straight seasons in the AHL, he finally got the call to the NHL with the New York Rangers. He spent three seasons with the Rangers from 1974-1977. In 1975-76, he played in a career NHL best 59 games.\n\nBednarski spent the majority of his final six seasons in the AHL. In 1980-81 he returned to Rochester and played in 76 games, recording three goals, 18 assists and 156 penalty minutes.\n\nThe 42nd member of the Amerks Hall of Fame was the 10th defenseman enshrined. He joined fellow blue liners Don McSween, Al Arbour, Darryl Sly, Don Cherry, Duane Rupp, Steve Kraftcheck, Jim Hofford, John Van Boxmeer and Dave Fenyves.\n\nAfter retiring from hockey in 1982 he remained close to the Amerks’ organization. In 1985 he became the color commentator for the Amerks and spent most of his days next to broadcaster Don Stevens. Bednarski spun yarns about the old days of hockey and bantered with Stevens to the delight of thousands of fans listening on radio, TV and online.\n\nBednarski was also instrumental away from the rink, helping maintain the Amerks Alumni Association and also serving as its president for many years. He also founded a charity golf tournament with former Amerks owner Ken Bonn and assisted Bonn in founding the Cystic Fibrosis Amerks’ at Your Service Dinner.\n\nScott Metcalfe\n\nRochester Americans Center, 1987-91; 1993-98\n\nScott Metcalfe was inducted into the Amerks Hall of Fame during the team’s historic 50th Anniversary season. Metcalfe played in Rochester for nine seasons (1987-91 and 1993-98) and was a fan favorite because of his tenacious play and work in the community. The former first-round pick of the Edmonton Oilers still ranked eighth on the team’s all-time points list with 349 at the time of this induction. He was also the all-time penalty minute leader with 1,424, sixth in games played (499), 10th in goals (137) and ninth in assists (211). Three times during his career he scored 20 or more goals and in 1996 he was a member of the Amerks’ last Calder Cup championship team.\n\nHe was a three-time winner of both the McCulloch Trophy for community service (1989-90, 1994-96) and the V.P. Supply Most Popular Player award (1994-97). He was also a three-time winner of the Executive Club Most Popular Player award (1994-97) and was the co-winner of the honor in 1997-98. In 1988-89 he captured the Rob Zabelny Award as the team’s Unsung Hero.\n\nHe began his professional career in 1987-88, playing 16 seasons and 800 regular season games before hanging up his skates in 2001-02. He spent the majority of his career in the AHL, playing in 542 games and registering 377 points and 1,511 penalty minutes.\n\nIn his rookie season he was a member of the Edmonton Oilers, playing two games with the NHL club and 43 with its AHL affiliate in Nova Scotia. Midway through the 1987-88 season, however, the Oilers traded Metcalfe to the Buffalo Sabres (along with Edmonton's ninth-round choice in the 1989 Entry Draft, which turned out to be Donald Audette) for rugged defenseman Steve Dykstra.\n\nThe Toronto, Ontario, native played 17 games with the Buffalo Sabres and spent the rest of his time in Rochester with the Amerks, playing in 499 regular-season contests and 65 playoff games. Along the way, Metcalfe also made stops in the United Hockey League, ECHL and the German and British hockey leagues.\n\nJody Gage\n\nRochester Americans Right Wing, 1985-96\n\nRochester Americans General Manager, 1996-2009\n\nRochester Americans Director of Player Personnel, 2009-11\n\nRochester Americans Director of Strategic Planning, 2011-Present\n\nJody Gage captured the hearts of the Rochester Americans fans many times throughout his 11-season hockey career with the Amerks as he wore the crest with great pride during that time. After retirement, Gage, a three-time Calder Cup winner, moved to the front office where he remains to this day.\n\nHe gained legendary status during a magnificent 17-year playing career in the American Hockey League as one of only three players in league history with more than 500 career goals and over 1,000 career points, including a record seven 40-goal seasons. In 1987-88, he became just the second AHL player ever to score 60 goals in a single season and earned league MVP honors.\n\nHe served as the team’s general manager from 1996-2009 and the team’s director of player personnel for another two years before moving onto his current role as the organization’s director of strategic planning.\n\nDuring Gage’s 13 seasons as the team’s general manager, he saw nine teams reach the finals (three hockey, six lacrosse). The Amerks advanced to the Calder Cup Finals in 1999 and 2000, and he was the Assistant General Manager when the Amerks won the 1996 Calder Cup.\n\nIn 1998-99, he won the James C. Hendy Award as the AHL’s outstanding executive. Gage assembled a team that won both the AHL Empire Division Championship and the Western Conference Championship and earned a berth in the 1999 Calder Cup Finals. The 1998-99 Amerks broke franchise records for most wins (52) and most points (111), and league records for fewest goals allowed (176) and fewest road goals allowed (86). In 2004-05 the Amerks rewrote the record books, setting franchise records for points (112) and shutouts (9). That Amerks team also won the regular-season points title, while wrapping up the North Division and Western Conference.\n\nGage received one of the highest honors of his career in 2006 as he was inducted into the inaugural class of the AHL Hall of Fame. He joined legends Johnny Bower, Jack Butterfield, Fred Glover, Willie Marshall, Frank Mathers and Eddie Shore. The ceremony was conducted at the 2006 Rbk Hockey American Hockey League All-Star Classic in Winnipeg, Manitoba (January 31st to February 1st).\n\nBecause his name is synonymous with AHL stardom, he was able to acquaint himself quickly with his peers and it did not take long for him to earn a reputation as a well-respected, savvy hockey GM. In his first season Gage's team captured the Amerks’ first division title since the 1990-91 season, making him the first Amerks’ GM to win a division title in his inaugural season.\n\nGage was involved with three Calder Cup championship teams during his pro career. He was a member of the Adirondack Red Wings Calder Cup team in 1981, the Amerks squad in 1987 and was Rochester's Assistant GM when the Amerks secured their sixth Calder Cup in 1996, having retired during the season due to lingering knee ailments.\n\nOriginally a third-round draft selection (45th overall) of the Detroit Red Wings in the 1979 NHL Entry Draft, the Toronto native spent six seasons in the Detroit organization before signing a free-agent contract with the Buffalo Sabres on July 31, 1985. Gage spent the rest of his career in the Sabres and Amerks organizations, signing his final contract with the Amerks on August 23, 1995, just a few months after Steve Donner purchased the Rochester club from Buffalo in June 1995.\n\nDubbed “Mr. Amerk” during his career in Rochester, Gage finished as the Amerks’ all-time leader in goals, assists, points and games played. He holds the Amerks’ record for game-winning goals in one season (9, 1987-88) and goals/points by a right wing in one season (60/104, 1987-88). Gage is one of just three players to record 500 career AHL goals and 1,000 career AHL points, and his 17 AHL seasons tie him for third in league history.\n\nSome of his other AHL accolades include the 1987-88 AHL MVP award and a berth on the First Team All-Star squad. He also earned AHL First Team All-Star honors following the 1985-86 and 1990-91 seasons, a place on the AHL's All-Time Team in 1992 -- as chosen by the media -- and selection as the U.S. Team Captain for the AHL All-Star Game in 1995. Gage also holds AHL records for the two fastest short-handed goals in one game (8 seconds, 3/25/89), the most 40+ goal seasons (7), and the most playoff goals (51) in AHL history.\n\nOn March 19, 1999, Gage and Dick Gamble had their No. 9 retired, joining Norm “Red” Armstrong as the only Amerks players to receive that honor.\n\nMike Keenan\n\nRochester Americans Head Coach, 1980-83\n\nAlthough just the fifth coach in the Amerks Hall of Fame, Keenan is one of the most celebrated. His tenure in Rochester was relatively short, but the results Keenan accomplished in just three seasons were impressive. He became the second coach in Amerks history to guide a team to the Calder Cup and the first to top the 100-point plateau since the inaugural Calder Cup team of 1964-65. Keenan’s 116 wins as an Amerks coach is third all-time.\n\nAfter his tenure in Rochester was over, Keenan made the jump to the National Hockey League where he would lead the Philadelphia Flyers to four consecutive postseason appearances from 1984-88. Under his reign, the Flyers would clinch the Patrick Division three out of the four years and advance to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1985 and 1987.\n\nAfter leaving his post as bench boss in Philadelphia, Keenan took the head coaching job with the Chicago Blackhawks for the next four seasons (1988-92) where he guided the team to two Norris Division championships and back-to-back trips to the Westerns Conference Finals.\n\nAfter a year-long hiatus from coaching, Keenan returned in the 1993-94 season as the head coach of the New York Rangers and led the Blue Shirts, captained by NHL Hall of Famer Mark Messier, to the 1994 Stanley Cup championship. That Stanley Cup championship would be the last and only of Keenan’s career as a head coach in the NHL.\n\nSince winning hockey’s holy grail 15 years ago with the Rangers, Keenan has served behind the bench with the St. Louis Blues (1994-97), Vancouver Canucks (1997-99), Boston Bruins (2000-01), Florida Panthers (2001-04) and most recently, the Calgary Flames (2007-09). In his 25-year career as an NHL head coach, Keenan has amassed a 672-531-183 record (1,429 points) in 1,386 career games. Additionally, he has compiled a 96-75 record in 171 postseason contests.\n\nRobert W. Clarke\n\nRochester Americans Franchise Organizer\n\nRobert W. Clarke was associated with the Rochester Americans since their beginning with the American Hockey League in 1956. Clarke, along with Fred Forman and Morrie Silver, contacted Jim Hendy, the owner of the Cleveland Barons, in 1956 to inquire about a franchise.\n\nAs a result, a group of Rochester businessmen became owners of 45 percent of the club, and the Montreal Canadiens and the Toronto Maple Leafs each became owners of 27.5 percent of the stock of the Rochester Americans Hockey Club, which Bob Clarke organized. “Hap” Day was appointed governor and Clarke was named alternate governor of the franchise.\n\nIn 1965 Clarke became the principal owner and governor of the Amerks until 1968, when the club was sold to Vancouver. During that period Rochester captured three Calder Cups under Coach Joe Crozier and was a finalist the other year. Clarke became Chairman of the Board of Governors of the American Hockey League in 1968. He has served on the constitutional committee and the player relations committee.\n\nWhen Vancouver re-sold the team back to the Rochester individuals in 1972, Clarke became part owner and director of the Western New York Hockey Club from 1972 to 1977. When the club was sold to the Buffalo Sabres in 1984, Clarke once again became a director of the club, and continued in that capacity.\n\nClarke received the James Hendy Award for his outstanding contribution to the AHL in 1971-72. He was also presented the Gold Skate award in February of 1986 for 30 years of service to the Rochester Americans and the American Hockey League.\n\nJoe Crozier\n\nRochester Americans Head Coach, 1963-68, 1983-84\n\nRochester Americans General Manager, 1964-69\n\nJoe Crozier made his first stop in Rochester in 1963, and since that time, the “Golden Age” of the Flower City’s franchise has been synonymous with his name. In the fall of 1963, “the Crow,” as he is known in hockey circles, turned a team that had finished a dismal 24-39-9 just the year before into a 40-30-2 team that finished second in the Western Division of the AHL, just one point behind Pittsburgh.\n\nThe next year, he led the Amerks to a first-place finish in the West and brought Rochester its first Calder Cup championship, a feat he repeated the next year as well. Crozier experienced a minor setback in 1966-67 when his club lost in the semifinals but rebounded in a big way the next year with another first-place finish and his third Calder Cup in four years.\n\nCrow, who had bought into the club as a part-owner, sold his portion of the Amerks in 1968 to a faction from Vancouver and left to coach the Canucks in the Western Hockey League. After coaching stints in Cincinnati, Buffalo, New Brunswick and Toronto, Crozier made a triumphant return to Rochester in 1983-84, leading the Amerks to the Calder Cup finals once again.\n\nIn six memorable years as coach of the Rochester Americans, Crozier compiled a record of 260-155-30, making him the winningest coach at the time. He is one of only six head coaches to win at least three Calder Cups, and only Fred “Bun” Cook has won more Calder Cups (seven).\n\nIn the 56-year history of the Rochester Americans, Crozier ranks third all-time in coaching victories and first in points percentage among Amerks coaches with more than 100 victories. In addition to winning three Calder Cups as Amerks head coach, Crozier also posted a 39-27 record in the postseason, guiding Rochester to a berth in the finals in five of his six years behind the bench. He was a charter member of the Amerks Hall of Fame in 1986.\n\nHe was later inducted into the American Hockey League Hall of Fame on January 30, 2012 as part of the Class of 2012.\n\nDick Gamble\n\nRochester Americans Right Wing, 1961-70\n\nRochester Ammericans Head Coach, 1968-71\n\nRochester Americans General Manager, 1968-71\n\nA quick, booming and heavy shot helped catapult Dick Gamble to the top of the Rochester Americans all-time scoring chart at the time of his induction.\n\nHe held virtually all of Rochester's scoring records until they were later broken by fellow Amerks Hall of Famer Jody Gage. To this day, Gamble still ranks second in franchise history in goals (300), points (565) and games played (569) and fifth all-time in assists (265).\n\nBesides a nine-year tour of duty as a player, Gamble also served the franchise as a coach during the era of Vancouver ownership in the late 1960s and early 70s.\n\nOnly once in his eight full seasons in Rochester did the sharp-shooting right wing ever fail to reach the 30-goal mark. His skills helped him to NHL stints with Montreal, Chicago and Toronto.\n\nGamble’s finest year with the Amerks came in 1965-66 when he scored 47 goals and added a career-high 51 assists for 98 points (another career high). For his efforts, the three-time AHL All- Star took the American Hockey League scoring championship and Most Valuable Player Trophy while helping the Amerks and Joe Crozier to their second consecutive Calder Cup title.\n\nA 20-goal scorer in all eight seasons played in Rochester, Gamble is part of the first three of the Amerks’ six Calder Cup championships. Gamble is still ranked fourth in AHL history with 468 goals and fifth with 892 points, respectively.\n\nOn March 19, 1999, Gamble and Gage had their No. 9 retired, joining Norm “Red” Armstrong as the only players in team history to receive that honor. He was later inducted into the American Hockey League Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nBobby Perreault\n\nRochester Americans Goaltender, 1956-57; 1962-63; 1965-69\n\nBobby Perreault, who tended the Amerks’ nets for six seasons, held club records for most games played by a goaltender (205) and most shutouts (16) at the time of his induction.\n\nDespite his talents in the crease, the always jovial Perreault perhaps is better remembered for his trait of kissing the ring he wore on his glove hand after coming up with a big save.\n\nPerreault’s goaltending skills were always evident. In 1955, while in the Quebec League, Perreault won the Vezina Memorial Trophy after collecting 10 shutouts and posting a sparkling 2.23 goals against average. Twice he was awarded the Harry Holmes Trophy as the AHL’s top goaltender, the last time being in 1967-68 while with the Amerks after posting a six-shutout performance that year, the second best in a single season in franchise history.\n\nIn 1956-57, Perreault led the expansion Rochester Americans to the Calder Cup finals, a feat unheard of for a new franchise. In the playoff semifinals, Perreault blanked the regular season champion Providence Reds twice in their own rink, out-dueling the legendary Johnny Bower.\n\nOverall, Perreault tossed seven shutouts for the Amerks in playoff competition. Perreault culminated his tenure in Rochester by backstopping the Amerks to their second and third Calder Cup championships in 1965-66 and then again in 1967-68.\n\nHe remains first all-time among Amerks goaltenders with 108 career wins and fifth in league history with 229 wins.\n\nPerreault was inducted into the American Hockey League Hall of Fame in 2014."
