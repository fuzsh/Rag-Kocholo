Linemate and fellow senior Corban Knight (Sr., High River, Alberta) has 10 points (2g, 8a) in nine career games against CC.\n\nPOLL POSITION: UND is ranked No. 7 in the most recent USCHO.com and USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine polls, released on Monday.\n\nColorado College is not ranked in either poll.\n\nLAST ACTION: UND wrapped up its non-conference schedule last weekend with a home sweep of 20th-ranked Holy Cross, winning 5-2 and 3-2. Senior center Corban Knight (High River, Alberta) enjoyed a 6-point weekend, collecting two goals and two assists on Friday and two assists on Saturday.\n\nLinemate Danny Kristo (Sr., Eden Prairie, Minn.) had a goal and an assist in each game, while new linemate Michael Parks (So., St. Louis, Mo.) scored a goal in each game. Parks had missed all but one period of UND's first 18 games prior to the series.\n\nUND's power play enjoyed it's best series of the season, going 5-for-10 with the man advantage.\n\nLUCKY 7: UND enters this week's series riding a season-long 7-game unbeaten streak (6-0-1).\n\nIt is UND's longest regular season unbeaten streak since a 9-game streak (8-0-1) to close out the 2010-11 regular season.\n\nUND is also in the midst of a season-best 5-game winning streak.\n\nNO REST FOR THE WEARY: Last week's Subway Holiday Classic sweep over No. 20 Holy Cross concluded a grueling 16-game stretch for UND that included 12 games against nationally-ranked opponents.\n\nUND, which went 10-4-2 (.688) during this stretch, ranks fifth nationally in strength of schedule.\n\nROCCO'S RETURN: UND will welcome forward Rocco Grimaldi (Rossmoor, Calif.) back to the lineup this weekend after the freshman helped lead the United States to a gold medal at the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) World Junior Hockey Championship in Ufa, Russia.\n\nGrimaldi scored the game-tying and game-winning goals in the gold medal game, his first goals of the tournament, and was named the player of the game for the U.S. He became UND's 19th medalist at the tournament and the 12th to win gold.\n\nHe finished the tournament with two goals and two assists and a +4 rating in seven games.\n\nGrimaldi is the 47th UND player to compete at the World Junior Championship and the 34th to play for the U.S.\n\nIn 18 games with UND, Grimaldi is tied for third on the team in scoring with 16 points (7g, 9a). He is tied for third in the WCHA rookie scoring race, and his 0.89 points per game rank second.\n\nAWARDS KNIGHT: Last Friday, senior forward Corban Knight (High River, Alberta) was named national player of the month for December. This week, he opened the month of January by nabbing two more honors.\n\nOn Monday, Knight was one of 77 players nominated for the Vote For Hobey fan voting process at HobeyBakerAward.com. Fans can cast their votes through March 10, 2013. Phase two of fan balloting will begin on March 22 from the list of Top Ten Hobey Baker finalists. The fans' vote accounts for a full 1 percent of the total ballot in each phase in selecting this year's award recipient.\n\nOn Tuesday, Knight was named WCHA co-Offensive Player of the Week after a 6-point series against Holy Cross. Knight scored twice (including the game-winner) and assisted on two other goals in Friday's 5-2 win. In Saturday's 3-2 win, Knight notched a pair of third-period assists on the power play, setting up the game-tying and game-winning game-winning goals as UND rallied from an early 2-0 deficit.\n\nKnight also won 31 of 40 (77.5 percent) faceoffs in the series, including a 21-of-24 (87.5 percent) performance on Friday, upping his season percentage to 60.2. That puts him on pace to break his own school record of 59.9 percent, set as a sophomore in 2010-11.\n\nKNIGHT STREAKING: Knight's performance against Holy Cross also extended his point streak to 15 games, UND's longest since All-American Brandon Bochenski had a 17-game streak during the 2002-03 season.\n\nA point in each game this weekend would put Knight's streak among the 10 longest in school history:\n\nKnight has 27 points (8g, 19a) during his streak, which began Nov. 3 against Boston University.\n\nUND is 31-2-4 all-time when Knight scores a goal, including an unbeaten 6-0-2 record this season.\n\nDYNAMIC DUO: Senior Danny Kristo (Eden Prairie, Minn.) is the leading active scorer among NCAA Division I men's hockey players with 134 career points, one better than Colorado College's Rylan Schwartz.\n\nWith 260 career points between them, Kristo and linemate Corban Knight (High River, Alberta) are the highest scoring active teammates in NCAA DI men's hockey:\n\nBoth are also among the NCAA's active career assists leaders, while Kristo is one of the top active goal scorers in the nation:\n\nKristo and Knight also each continue to climb UND's all-time scoring list. Refer to Page 7 for UND's all-time top 65 scorers and where Kristo and Knight rank.\n\nSENIOR SPOTLIGHT: This weekend's series against Colorado College will feature two of the highest-scoring senior classes in the nation.

He notched four goals and seven assists in 11 career games with the Huskies.\n\nNON-CONFERENCE NUMBERS: Last weekend's sweep of Holy Cross marked UND's final non-conference action of the regular season. UND finished 5-3-0 against non-conference opponents and is now 45-16-10 (.704) in regular season non-conference games under ninth-year head coach Dave Hakstol.\n\nUND has lost just seven of its last 31 regular season non-conference games dating back to the start of the 2009-10 season, going 18-7-6 during that stretch:\n\nYear W-L-T Opponents\n\n2004-05 5-1-2 Maine, BC, NE, Canisius, BSU\n\n2005-06 6-2-1 Miami, MSU, NE, UNH, BSU, Harvard\n\n2006-07 6-2-0 Quinnipiac, Maine, Dartmouth, STL, BSU\n\n2007-08 5-1-1 MSU, BC, NE, UNH, BSU\n\n2008-09 5-3-0 BU, UMass, Cornell, Harvard, BSU\n\n2009-10 5-1-2 Merrimack, OSU, Miami, Niagara, ND, Cornell\n\n2010-11 4-2-2 Alaska, Maine, Notre Dame, Robert Morris\n\n2011-12 4-1-2 Air Force, BC, Maine, Harvard, Clarkson\n\n2012-13 5-3-0 Alaska, UAA, BU, Notre Dame, Holy Cross\n\nTotal 45-16-10\n\nNODAK NATION: Thanks to the National Hockey League (NHL) lockout, North Dakota has been the top hockey draw in all of North America this season.\n\nUND is averaging 11,633 fans in the 11,634-seat Ralph Engelstad Arena, more than any other NCAA, American Hockey League, East Coast Hockey League or Canadian Hockey League team.\n\nNo other NCAA team is averaging more than 10,000 fans per game, and the only other team in North America averaging at least 10,000 is the Quebec Remparts of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL).\n\nLast season, North Dakota led the nation in total attendance (419,981) and average attendance (9,999.5) for all games -- which includes home, away and neutral -- and also led the country in total home attendance (249,501).\n\nUND's 2011-12 average home attendance of 11,341 fans per game ranked second nationally behind only Wisconsin's 11,772.9.\n\nHOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS: Thanks in part to that crowd support, UND has lost just once in 10 home games this season, having gone 6-1-3.\n\nUND has lost just three of its last 27 home games, including WCHA playoffs, going 19-3-5 (.796) during that stretch.\n\nLast season UND went 15-4-3 (.750) at Ralph Engelstad Arena.\n\nHEY JOE: Senior defenseman Joe Gleason (Edina, Minn.) is in the midst of the most productive stretch of his collegiate career.\n\nGleason has one goal and six assists in his last five games.\n\nSince sitting out as a healthy scratch in UND's 4-3 overtime win over Minnesota Duluth on Nov. 17, Gleason has eight points (2g, 6a) and is a +6 in eight games.\n\nCAPTAIN'S LOG: With 141 career games played, senior captain Andrew MacWilliam (Calgary, Alberta) is the active leader among WCHA defensemen and ranks fifth nationally among all skaters:\n\nMacWilliam has a goal and five assists and is a +6 in 19 games this season.\n\nCLARKE MAKING HIS MARK: Junior goalie Clarke Saunders (Brockville, Ontario) has started the last eight consecutive games for UND, and is riding a 7-game unbeaten streak and a 5-game winning streak, both of which are the longest of his career.\n\nIn 16 starts this season, Saunders is 10-3-3 with a 2.17 goals against average and .922 save percentage, the latter ranking as the fifth-best in UND single-season history:\n\nWORKIN' OVERTIME: UND is unbeaten (2-0-3) in five overtime games this season after going winless (0-1-3) in four overtime tilts last season.\n\nFour of those five overtime games have come on home ice (1-0-3), where UND has lost just seven times in 40 overtime games (6-7-27) since the new Engelstad Arena opened in 2001-02.\n\nSHOOTING GALLERY: Over the past eight games, UND has outshot its opponents by an average of 15 shots per game (39-24).

His third and final goal was the power-play game-winner.\n\nHELLO, MY NAME IS: UND's 2012-13 roster features seven newcomers, including five incoming freshmen, one returning freshman, and one junior transfer.\n\nThe incoming freshmen include forwards Drake Caggiula (Pickering, Ontario), Bryn Chyzyk (Virden, Manitoba) and Coltyn Sanderson (Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan), goalie Zane Gothberg (Thief River Falls, Minn.), and defenseman Jordan Schmaltz (Verona, Wis.).\n\nSchmaltz was a first-round draft pick of St. Louis in June, while Gothberg was taken by Boston in the sixth round of the 2010 draft.\n\nThe returning freshman is forward Colten St. Clair (Gilbert, Ariz.), who sat out the entire 2011-12 season due to an NCAA eligibility issue.\n\nThe junior transfer is goalie Clarke Saunders (Brockville, Ontario), who came to UND after two seasons at the University of Alabama-Huntsville.\n\nLast season, Saunders posted a solid .906 save percentage and an NCAA-leading 34 saves per game for a UAH team that went 2-28-1.\n\nAn eighth player, junior forward Mitch MacMillan (Penticton, British Columbia), became eligible to play for UND in January. MacMillan transferred to UND last January after a season-and-a-half at St. Cloud State.

The freshman defenseman was taken in the first round (25th overall) by the St. Louis Blues.\n\nSchmaltz is one of two 1st-round picks on UND's roster, joining 2010 selection Derek Forbort (Los Angeles).\n\nUND's other active draft picks include two 2nd-rounders (Rocco Grimaldi, Danny Kristo), two 4th-rounders (Mark MacMillan, Dillon Simpson), three 5th-rounders (Corban Knight, Michael Parks, Derek Rodwell), three 6th-rounders (Zane Gothberg, Nick Mattson, Brendan O'Donnell) and two 7th-rounders (Joe Gleason, Andrew MacWilliam).\n\nUND boasts six draft picks among its defensive corps, the most in program history.\n\nMAY I HAVE THIS DANCE?: UND advanced to the NCAA postseason tournament for the 10th consecutive season in 2011-12, the second-longest active streak in the NCAA behind only Michigan (22).\n\nIt was also the 27th all-time postseason appearance for UND. Head coach Dave Hakstol has now led the program to the NCAA tournament in each of his first eight seasons behind the UND bench, including Frozen Four appearances in five of those eight years.\n\nTRADITION NEVER GRADUATES: Seventeen former UND players appeared in the NHL last year, tying the program's most since 1993-94.\n\nThose 17 NHLers included: Jason Blake (Anaheim), Taylor Chorney (St. Louis/Edmonton), Mike Commodore (Detroit/Tampa Bay), Joe Finley (Buffalo), Matt Frattin (Toronto), Chay Genoway (Minnesota), Matt Greene (Los Angeles), Brian Lee (Ottawa, Tampa Bay), Brad Malone (Colorado), T.J.

Until 2015, the Uuniversity's varsity athletics teams will be referred to as \"the University of North Dakota,\" \"North Dakota,\"\n\nor \"UND.\"\n\nUND adopted the \"Fighting Sioux\" nickname in 1930 after previously being known as the \"Flickertails.\""
