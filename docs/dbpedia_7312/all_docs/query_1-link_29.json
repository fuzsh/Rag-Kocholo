        "text": "British Columbia Hockey League Sport Ice hockey Founded 1961 CEO Chris Hebb (2018-19) No. of teams 17 Country(ies) Canada Most recent champion(s) Surrey Eagles (7th) (2023-24) Most championship(s) Penticton Vees â€“ 14 Official website www.bchl.bc.ca\n\nThe British Columbia Hockey League is a Junior (formerly a Junior \"A\") ice hockey league from British Columbia under Hockey Canada, the league was a subsection of the Canadian Junior Hockey League until 2021. Founded in Vernon in 1961, the BCHL now includes 18 teams. These teams play in two conferences, known as the Coastal and the Interior. The winner of the BCHL playoffs (Fred Page Cup) formerly continued on to play in the Doyle Cup in a best-of-7 series against the champion of the Alberta Junior Hockey League. The winner of the Doyle Cup competed in the Junior \"A\" National Championship for the Centennial Cup.\n\nHistory[]\n\nIn 1961, the heads of four junior \"B\" hockey teams in the Okanagan region of British Columbia got together and formed a new Junior \"A\" league in British Columbia when no other existed. The Okanagan-Mainline Junior \"A\" Hockey League, the precursor to the BCHL, was comprised originally of the Kamloops Jr. Rockets, the Kelowna Buckaroos, the Penticton Jr. Vees, and the Vernon Jr. Canadians.\n\nIn 1967, the league expanded out of the Okanagan region, bringing in the New Westminster Royals and the Victoria Cougars. With the expansion, the league decided that since it had stretched out of the Okanagan region, that it need a new name - The British Columbia Junior Hockey League. A year later, the Vancouver Centennials joined the league as well. In the 1970s, the Victoria Cougars jumped to the Western Hockey League and the New Westminster team was forced to fold due to the invasion of the Estevan Bruins into their arena. In 1972, the Bellingham Blazers and the Nanaimo Clippers expanded the league to 8 teams.\n\nOn a side note, in the early 1970s the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association separated the two tiers of Junior \"A\" hockey. The BCJHL, being a Tier II league, was disallowed from competing for the Memorial Cup. Therefore, the variety of Tier II Junior \"A\" leagues across Canada agreed to compete for a new trophy called the Centennial Cup. The '70s also saw the rise of a rival league for the BCJHL. The Pacific Coast Junior Hockey League, which briefly existed in the 1960s, was resurrected by Fred Page, the man that the Eastern Champion Junior \"A\" Fred Page Cup and the BCHL Championship trophy are named for. The Richmond Sockeyes were the PCJHL's most dominant team, which even defeated Nanaimo in the BC Championship, the Mowat Cup, to move on to what was the precursor to the Doyle Cup. In 1979, the PCJHL and the BCJHL merged. The 77-78 season proved to be a strange one. The BCJHL sent their regular season champion, the Merritt Centennials off to play in the interprovincial playdowns as league champions without playing a single playoff game. The BCJHL continued their league playoffs without them, crowning Nanaimo as the playoff champion after Penticton refused to finish the playoff finals due to a series of brawls in the third game of the series. Merritt played off against the Prince Albert Raiders of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League in the Abbott Cup (the Western Canada Championship) and lost in 5 games (best-of-7). The Raiders lost the Centennial Cup finals to the Guelph Platers of the Ontario Hockey Association.\n\nIn 1986, Penticton won the BCJHL's first ever National Championship defeating the Metro Valley Junior Hockey League's Cole Harbour Colts by a score of 7-4 to win the Centennial Cup. A year later, the BCJHL's Richmond Sockeyes won the league's second national title as well.\n\nIn 1990, the BCJHL was renamed to its current name, British Columbia Hockey League, and changed its logo twice, in 1990 and 2000, continues to expand with new teams and younge players.\n\nThe most notable star to come from the BCHL is Olympian and National Hockey League hall of famer Brett Hull who played for Penticton. Hull holds the BCHL record for most goals in a season (105), which he set in 1983-84, a record that still stands today. Other NHLers who once played in the BCHL include Chuck Kobasew of the Boston Bruins who played for the since-renamed Penticton Panthers, Scott Gomez of the New York Rangers, who played for South Surrey, Paul Kariya of the St. Louis Blues who played for Penticton and Carey Price of Montreal Canadiens who played for the Quesnel Millionaires. Willie Mitchell is a native of British Columbia and happens to be the only current member of the Vancouver Canucks to have played in the BCHL, as a member of the Kelowna Spartans, in 1994-95.\n\nOn April 30, 2015 the Wenatchee Wild were approved by USA Hockey and Hockey Canada to transfer from the NAHL to the British Columbia Hockey League. The Wild had been trying since 2013 to make this transfer but could not get approval from both national governing bodies. The Wild organization motivation for the move was simply that the BCHL was a better fit travel wise, with the porential savings of tens of thosands of dollars just on travel expenses.\n\nOn October 8, 2019 the league announced the addition of the Cranbrook Bucks as an expansion team for the 2020-21 BCHL season. The team will be replacing the Kootenay Ice of the Western Hockey League, who relocated to Winnipeg for the 2019-20 season.[1]\n\nOn March 31, 2024 the board of directors of the Merritt Centennials announced that they would withdraw from the British Columbia Hockey League and cease operations at the end of the 2023-24 season.[2]\n\nDeparture from Canadian Junior Hockey League[]\n\nThe British Columbia Hockey League announced in March of 2021 that it was withdrawing from the Canadian Junior Hockey League. This means that the league will no longer be part of the Canadian Junior A classification. The league remains a member of BC Hockey and Hockey Canada. The full impact of the decision is not yet known but the league, its' players, and teams will no longer be eligible to compete for the Centennial Cup or in the World Junior A Challenge or the CJHL Prospects Game.[3]\n\nTeams[]\n\nInterior Conference Team City Arena Joined BCHL Cranbrook Bucks Cranbrook, British Columbia Western Financial Place 2020 Merritt Centennials Merritt, British Columbia Nicola Valley Memorial Arena 1961 Penticton Vees Penticton, British Columbia South Okanagan Events Centre 1961 Prince George Spruce Kings Prince George, British Columbia Rolling Mix Concrete Arena 1972 Salmon Arm Silverbacks Salmon Arm, British Columbia Shaw Centre 2001 Trail Smoke Eaters Trail, British Columbia Cominco Arena 1987 Vernon Vipers Vernon, British Columbia Kal Tire Place 1961 West Kelowna Warriors West Kelowna, British Columbia Royal Lepage Place 1994\n\nCoastal Conference Team City Arena Joined BCHL Alberni Valley Bulldogs Port Alberni, British Columbia Weyerhaeuser Arena 1998 Chilliwack Chiefs Chilliwack, British Columbia Chilliwack Coliseum 1996 Coquitlam Express Coquitlam, British Columbia Poirier Sport & Leisure Complex 2001 Cowichan Valley Capitals Duncan, British Columbia Island Savings Centre 1980 Langley Rivermen Langley, British Columbia George Preston Arena 1990 Nanaimo Clippers Nanaimo, British Columbia Frank Crane Arena 1972 Powell River Kings Powell River, British Columbia Hap Parker Arena 1988 Surrey Eagles Surrey, British Columbia South Surrey Arena 1976 Victoria Grizzlies Victoria, British Columbia The Q Centre 1967\n\nAlberta Conference Team City Arena Joined BCHL Blackfalds Bulldogs Blackfalds, Alberta Eagle Builders Centre 2024 Brooks Bandits Brooks, Alberta Centennial Regional Arena 2024 Okotoks Oilers Okotoks, Alberta Pason Centennial Arena 2024 Sherwood Park Crusaders Sherwood Park, Alberta Randy Rosen Rink 2024 Spruce Grove Saints Spruce Grove, Alberta Grant Fuhr Arena 2024\n\nTimeline of Teams[]\n\nKamloops Rockets (1967-73;
