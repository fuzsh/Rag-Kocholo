        "text": "The New York Times Sports department is revisiting the subjects of some compelling articles from the last year or so. Here is our June report on Charles Glenn’s final days with the Blues.\n\nCharles Glenn misses the concession workers at Enterprise Center in St. Louis. He misses the custodial staff there and the crew that cleans the ice. He misses the Blues’ players and management. He misses the energy that would pulse through the corridors before games where he sang the national anthem, his voice, a soulful tenor, resonating through the arena’s uppermost reaches.\n\nAfter 19 years as the Blues’ primary anthem singer, Glenn informed them on Jan. 6 — his 64th birthday, when the team ranked last in the Western Conference — that he would retire at season’s end. Even on better days, his multiple sclerosis left him fatigued and weak, and it was time to stop, it just was.\n\nBut Glenn promised that he would continue singing in the playoffs, if the Blues qualified. They kept winning, so Glenn kept singing — through April and May and deep into June, with three home games in the Stanley Cup finals, the latest a Blues season had ever stretched.\n\nThree days after St. Louis throttled the Bruins in Boston to win Game 7, Glenn and his band perched on a stage beneath the Gateway Arch, near the end of the victory parade route. Conducting with his cane, Glenn performed for about two hours, riffing during a soaring rendition of the team’s traditional goal song, “When the Blues Go Marching In.” He also belted out a different kind of anthem: “We Are The Champions.” Several times that afternoon, overcome with emotion, Glenn paused to collect himself.\n\n“I have never seen so many people at one place, just a sea of people, all united for one purpose,” Glenn said. “It brought a tear to my eye.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
