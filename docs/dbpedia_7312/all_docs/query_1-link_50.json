        "text": "Mark Reed was an assistant coach of the Ottawa Senators.\n\nMark Reeds\n\nBorn: January 24, 1960 (Burlington, Ontario)\n\nDied: April 14, 2015 (St. Louis, Missouri)\n\nMark Reeds, an assistant coach with the NHL’s Ottawa Senators from 2011, died in St. Louis of cancer after being hospitalized with pneumonia. He was 55.\n\nReeds was diagnosed with cancer a year before his death. His death was announced by the team the day before it was to begin a playoff series with the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nThe 5-foot-10, 178-pound right winger was a checking forward with the St. Louis Blues and the Hartford Whalers in a 365-game NHL career.\n\nHe played three years of junior hockey with the Peterborough Petes under mercurial coach Mike Keenan. He had a 34-goal season in his final campaign with the Ontario major junior team in 1979-80. Reeds scored the overtime winner for a 5-4 victory over the Regina Pats in the first game of the 1980 Memorial Cup tournament in Brandon, Man.\n\nThe Petes went on to face the Cornwall (Ont.) Royals for the Cup, a game they lost 3-2 in overtime, as Regina fans booed the Petes and belted them with eggs and rotten vegetables in the belief they had earlier thrown a game against the Royals to eliminate the Pats. He was named to the Memorial Cup tournament’s all-star team. (The Pats coach at the time, Bryan Murray, was the Senators general manager who hired Reeds as an assistant coach.)\n\nReeds also skated for Canada’s under-20 team at the world championships that season, scoring one goal in five games. (Canada’s top scorer on the junior squad was future NHL sniper Dino Ciccarelli, who scored five goals in five games.)\n\nThe St. Louis Blues drafted Reeds in the third round (No. 86 overall) of the 1979 NHL entry draft.\n\nThe slight forward spent most of the following three seasons with the Salt Lake Golden Eagles, though he was called up for a total of 29 games with the Blues.\n\nHe emerged as a full-time NHL player in 1984-84. His unenviable task was the check the top scoring line of the opposing team.\n\nOn Nov. 20, 1984, he scored a hat-trick and added an assist as the Blues demolished the Canucks, 5-1, in Vancouver. Canucks coach Bill LaForge was fired the following day.\n\nReeds missed to games in 1986-87 after suffering second- and third-degree burns from splattering hot oil while trying to make popcorn.\n\nHe was traded to the Whalers for a third-round draft choice in 1987. He played 45 games in Hartford, spending most of a season with the Binghamton Whalers of the American Hockey League.\n\nReeds scored 45 goals (all with the Blues) and added 114 assists in his NHL career. He had eight goals and nine assists in 53 playoff games.\n\nAfter two seasons with Fiemme Cavalese in Italy, Reeds retired as a player only to return to play 16 games with the Peoria Rivermen in 1992-93. He scored four goals for the International Hockey League team.\n\nReeds, who was nicknamed The Dude as a player, had an extensive coaching career in the minor pros with the Peoria Rivermen, Missouri River Otters and Kalamazoo K-Wings. He became head coach of the junior Owen Sound (Ont.) Attack in 2007-08. In 2011, he won the Matt Leyden Trophy as the Ontario Hockey League’s coach of the year. He had guided the Attack to a 46-17-5 record for 97 points, a 35-point improvement on their previous season.\n\nSteven Richard Montador\n\nBorn: December 21, 1979 (Vancouver, British Columbia)\n\nDied: February 15, 2015 (Mississaugua, Ontario)\n\nSteve Montador, whose 10-season NHL career was shortened by concussions, was found dead at his home. He was 35. No cause of death was immediately available.\n\nHe was discovered unresponsive at his home in the Toronto suburb of Mississauga, where he was pronounced dead by police, who began a sudden-death investigation. Foul play was not suspected.\n\nHis death brought an outpouring of grief from former teammates and rivals, as well as from the NHL Players Association, for which he had been an active member and part of the bargaining committee in 2012. Montador’s head injuries, as well as his subsequent struggle with depression, were much chronicled.\n\nIn May, an analysis of his brain revealed evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\n\nHis death will likely put greater pressure on the NHL as it seeks to cope with the brain injuries that plague the sport.\n\nMontador was a plaintiff in a case by former players against the NHL, the late player’s lawyer Bill Gibbs told Rick Westhead of TSN. The family can pursue the case on behalf of the player’s estate.\n\n“He was a guy who really cared about his brothers, the guys he played with,” Gibbs told TSN. “I think he felt strongly it was important for everybody to start advancing the conversation about what happens to guys after their hockey careers and what happens to their brains.”\n\nThe 6-foot, 205-pound defenceman played junior in the Ontario Hockey League with the North Bay Centennials, Erie (Penn.) Otters and Peterborough Petes. The Calgary Flames signed the undrafted rearguard as a free agent in 2000, assigning him to their American Hockey League affiliate in Saint John, N.B., where he won a Calder Cup in 2001.\n\nHe skated in 87 games for the parent Flames over three seasons. In 2004-05, he played in France for the Mulhouse Scorpions, before returning to the Flames the following season. Calgary traded him to the Florida Panthers on Dec. 2, 2005. He put in three solid seasons in Florida before joining the Anaheim Ducks for the 2008-09 season. After 65 games, the Ducks traded him to the Boston Bruins for Petteri Nokelainen. Montador lasted just 13 games in Boston. He next spent two seasons with the Buffalo Sabres before joining the Chicago Blackhawks for the 2011-12 season.\n\nHe suffered a concussion on Feb. 7, 2012, in a game against Colorado, returned seven weeks later only to be re-concussed. The head injury was re-aggravated in practice.\n\n“If I get into a game I expect to get hit and I expect to hit people,” Montador told sports reporter Tracey Myers. “If I went into a game fearful, the first thing that’s going to happen is I’m going to get hit and I’m going to get smoked. That’s part of the recovery.”\n\nMontador scored 33 goals with 98 assists in 571 regular-season NHL games. He recorded 807 penalty minutes in his 10 seasons with six clubs. He scored three goals with five assists in 43 NHL playoff games.\n\nMontador’s professional career ended with a 14-game rehabilitation assignment with the Rockford (Ill.) IceHogs of the AHL in 2012-13.\n\nOnce again a free agent, but with little NHL interest in him as a player, Montador, nicknamed The Matador, signed with Zagreb Medvescak of the KHL last season. He lasted 11 games.\n\nSports fans in Vancouver will remember broadcaster Don Taylor celebrating the defenceman’s appearance in a highlight package by singing a parody of the opening line of a Procol Harum’s “Conquistador”: “Steve Mon-ta-dor your stallion stands…”\n\nMarc Carol Dufour\n\nBorn: September 11, 1941 (Trois-Rivières, Québec)\n\nDied: January 23, 2015 (Trois-Rivières, Québec)\n\nMarc Dufour’s NHL career lasted just 14 games over three seasons with two teams. His lone goal was scored in a game played in the sad aftermath of John Kennedy’s assassination.\n\nThe forward spent 13 seasons in the professional minor leagues, enjoying one of his most productive seasons at the ripe age of 32.\n\nDufour, a 6-foot, 175-pound right winger who could also handle duties at centre, played junior hockey for the Guelph (Ont.) Biltmores, his hometown Trois-Rivières Reds and the Brandon Wheat Kings.\n\nHe showed a scoring touch in junior, leading the Manitoba Junior Hockey League in goal scoring with 37 markers in 33 games in 1961-62. He also scored two goals in the league’s Manitoba vs. Saskatchewan all-star game. He then scored 10 goals in 11 Memorial Cup playoff games, as his Wheat Kings lost the Western final in seven games to the Edmonton Oil Kings.\n\nDufour scored 50 goals with 49 assists for the Sudbury (Ont.) Wolves in 1962-63.\n\nHis NHL debut came when he was called up from the minors by the New York Rangers for a game against the Detroit Red Wings on Nov. 27, 1963, just five days after the U.S. president had been assassinated and two days following his burial and national day of mourning.\n\nIn his third game, Dufour scored against Denis DeJordy in the first period of a game the Rangers lost by 3-2 to the Chicago Black Hawks at Madison Square Garden. Assists went to Camille Henry and Don McKenney.\n\nHe recorded a minor penalty but no other points in a 10-game call-up before being returned to the minors. Dufour was the Central Hockey League’s leading scorer late in the 1964-65 season when the Rangers called him up for two games to replace Phil Goyette, who was suffering from a virus.\n\nThe fledgling Los Angeles Kings selected Dufour from the Rangers in the 1967 expansion draft. He had an uneventful two-game stint with the Kings in December, 1968. His NHL totals were one goal in 14 games played.\n\nMeanwhile, Dufour was a top scorer in the American Hockey League with the Springfield Kings and Baltimore Clippers. He had four 30-goal seasons followed by a 42-goal, 62-assist campaign in 1973-74.\n\nClarence Emmett Marquess\n\nBorn: March 26, 1925 (Bassano, Alberta)\n\nDied: January 19, 2015 (East Wenatchee, Washington)\n\nMark Marquess scored two goals in his NHL debut. Despite his first-day success, he would only score three more in his NHL career.\n\nMarquess was a forward who played for the Boston Bruins in the second half of the 1946-47 season. He scored five goals and added four assists in 27 games, helping the Bruins qualify for the playoffs.\n\nThe 5-foot-8, 160-pound right winger was one of three rookies summoned from the Hershey Bears farm club by Bruins manager Art Ross in January, 1947. Marquess was joined by centre Jack McGill and defenceman Fern Flaman. Going the other way were veterans Babe Pratt, Don Grosso and John Tierson.\n\nMarquess scored two goals in his debut playing on a line with McGill at centre and Eddie Barry on left wing. His goals came against Paul Bibeault in the net as the Bruins defeated the visiting Chicago Black Hawks by 6-3.\n\nMarquess scored against Detroit’s Harry Lumley two weeks later in a 4-1 win at Boston Garden.\n\nHis fourth goal came against Turk Broda in a losing cause as the Toronto Maple Leafs defeated the Bruins 5-2 at Maple Leaf Garden.\n\nWhat would be his fifth and final NHL goal was scored before 20,004 fans at Chicago Stadium, trumpeted at the time as the largest crowd ever to watch a professional hockey hame. The Bruins defeated rookie goaltender Emile (The Cat) Francis and the Black Hawks by 9-4.\n\nThe Bruins were swept by the Montreal Canadiens in the playoffs, Marquess failing to get on the scoresheet.\n\nBorn in Bassano, Alta., Marquess played two seasons of junior hockey with the Trail (B.C.) Smoke Eaters and the Moose Jaw (Sask.) Canucks. After just four games of senior hockey with the Saskatoon Elks, the forward joined the Boston Olympics of the Eastern Amateur Hockey League. Except for his stint with the parent Bruins, he spent the next five seasons with the Bears of the American Hockey League. He scored 25 goals in 58 games with Hershey in 1948-49.\n\nMarquess went west for the 1951-52 season, playing two seasons with the Tacoma (Wash.) Rockets, scoring 17 and 25 goals. He followed with a career-high 28 goals in 1953-54 with the Seattle Bombers. After 96 games with the Victoria Cougars over two seasons, he was sold to the old Vancouver Canucks. He wound up his career playing senior hockey with the Vernon Canadians and Kamloops Chiefs.\n\nThe forward was known among his teammates for playing his guitar, which he brought with him throughout his travels in the minor pros. In the summers, he worked on an Alberta cattle ranch.\n\nMarquess settled in East Wenatchee, Wash. Two of his sons played football for the University of Idaho Vandals. Wayne Marquess was a cornerback, while Rand Marquess was a linebacker.\n\nMarquess was predeceased by Loretta (Lori) Elizabeth (née Milane), his wife of 65 years, who died in 2013 at age 85. The couple met when she was a telephone operator in Boston.\n\nThe Day (New London, Conn.), Jan. 14, 1947\n\nGuy A. Trottier\n\nBorn: April 1, 1941 (Hull, Quebec)\n\nDied: June 19, 2014 (Dayton, Ohio)\n\nGuy Trottier, a diminutive forward known as The Mouse, spent two productive seasons with the Toronto Maple Leafs before jumping to the rival World Hockey Association, where he skated for four teams in three seasons.\n\nBorn in Hull, Que., Trottier played junior hockey in his region with the Ottawa-Hawkesbury Montagnards and Hull Bell Telephone. He turned professional for the 1962-63 season, which he spent with the Port Huron (Mich.) Flags, Knoxville Knights and Philadelphia Ramblers.\n\nThe 5-foot-8, 165-pound left winger was sold to the Dayton (Ohio) Gems of the Internatioknal Hockey League in 1964. In three seasons, he scored 46, 68 and 71 goals (leading the league in 1966-67). the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League signed him as a free agent in 1967. Trottier’s twice led the AHL in goal scoring, cementing his reputation as a top prospect by scoring 55 goals in 1969-70. Sports writers awarded him the Gil O. Julien Trophy as the top French-Canadian athlete of 1969.\n\nMeanwhile, Trottier made his NHL debut by playing two games for the New York Rangers in 1968-69. The Leafs claimed in an inter-league draft and Trottier notched 19 goals in 61 games for Toronto in 1970-71. He was used sparingly by coach John McLellan the following season, scoring just nine goals.\n\nIn the summer of 1972, Trottier became the fifth Maple Leaf to jump to the fledgling WHA. He scored 26 goals for the Ottawa Nationals in 1972-73 and 27 goals for the Toronto Toros the following season.\n\n“It was tougher than I expected because of the small rinks and poor accommodation and travelling,” Trottier told Paul Patton of the Globe and Mail in 1985. “In New Jersey, we had to dress in the hotel, take our skates with us, then after the game come back to the hotel and shower in our own rooms.”\n\nThe Toros traded hm to the Michigan Stags after just six games in 1974-75. The Stags collapsed midway through the season before the league revived the team as the Baltimore Blades.\n\n“I was going to retire but they offered to send me closer to home. I had a chance to go to either Indianapolis or Detroit, and I made a mistake and picked Detroit. The team had no money. We were moving in and out of hotels. We took forever to get to a game in San Diego because the team couldn’t pay its bills and didn’t want to take the same airline twice.”\n\nThe forward left the WHA to complete the season with the Dayton Gems. He played his final season of minor pro hockey with the Buffalo Norsemen of the North American Hockey League in 1975-76.\n\nTrottier made his debut as a coach with the Hull Olympiques of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. A sudden resignation led to his taking on the general manager role. The team went 19-24-3 before Trottier was asked to resign after Hull lost a game 10-0 to Cornwall.\n\nHe later worked as an assistant coach for the Dayton Ice Bandits and Dayton Bombers. For eight seasons, he was director of hockey operations for the Gems.\n\nTrottier retired after working for 20 years as operations supervisor for ABF Freight Systems.\n\nLazarus Zeidel\n\nBorn: June 1, 1928 (Montréal)\n\nDied: June 17, 2014 (Philadelphia)\n\nA tough, bruising defenceman, Larry Zeidel was known as The Rock for his stiff bodychecks.\n\nZeidel was not a stranger to the penalty box, accumulating an impressive rap sheet in more than 20 seasons of professional hockey.\n\nHe had his name engraved on the Stanley Cup with the Detroit red Wings in 1952, but after a brief time in the NHL seemed destined to close out his career in the minors. Instead, at age 39, he was signed by the expansion Philadelphia Flyers for their inaugural season.\n\nA rare Jewish player in his era, Zeidel endured anti-Semitic taunts throughout his career, most notably during an incident which ended in a vicious, stick-swinging duel against Eddie Shack.\n\nLazarus Zeidel was born in Montréal and raised in the gritty Park Extension neighbourhood, a blue-collar district home to many immigrants.\n\nAn older brother, Rudolph, known as Rudy, had been an amateur boxer and a member of the journalism club at the YMHA. After war broke out, Rudy signed up with the Royal Canadian Air Force. On the night of June 11-12, 1943, he was part of a Wellington crew with Squadron 429 assigned to a bombing mission on Dusseldorf, Germany. His plane was shot down over the Netherlands by a German Nightfighter. Flight Sergeant Zeidel, a bomb aimer, was 21. Three of the crew were buried nearby, while Zeidel and one other member have no known burial site.\n\nA year later, Larry Zeidel, aged 16, played two games with the Porcuine (Ont.) Combines, his first experience in senior hockey. After two seasons of further junior hockey with the Verdun (Que.) Maple Leafs and the Barrie (Ont.) Flyers, he joined the Quebec Aces of the Quebec Senior Hockey League at the start of the 1947-48 season. In three seasons with the Aces, Zeidel scored 18 goals with 57 seasons. He also had 57 assists. In 1949-50, his final season with the Aces, the 6-foot, 190-pound defenceman managed to record 176 penalty minutes.\n\nAfter a season with the Saskatoon Quakers, the defenceman was signed as a free agent by the Detroit Red Wings of the NHL. His only point was a goal in 19 games and he spent most of the 1951-52 season with the Indianapolis Capitals of the American Hockey League. When the Red Wings went on to win the Stanley Cup, Zeidel’s name was included on the roster, despite his short stint and minor contribution to the club.\n\nHe played nine pointless games with the Red Wings the following season, most of which was spent with the Edmonton Flyers of the Western Hockey League.\n\nPrior to the 1952-53 season, Detroit sold Zeidel, Larry Wilson and Lou Jankowski to the Chicago Black Hawks. Zeidel skated in 64 games with Chicago (one goal, six assists, 102 penalty minutes) before his rights were bought back by the Red Wings, who sold him a year later to the Hershey Bears of the AHL.\n\nIn eight seasons with the Bears, Zeidel cemented his reputation as a take-no-guff roughneck. He was whistled for 211 penalty minutes in 1956-57 and 203 minutes in 1959-60.\n\nZeidel skated for three Calder Cup winners as AHL champions — the Bears in 1958 and ’59, and the Cleveland Barons in 1964.\n\nHe spent two seasons with the Seattle Totems during which he earned a five-game suspension from the WHL for spitting on referee Willie Papp in a 1965 game against Victoria. He was also fined $200.\n\nThe suspension and fine was one of many he earned during his career. In 1958, he engaged in an on-ice brawl with Eddie Shack during an exhibition game in Niagara Falls, Ont. The fight continued in the penalty box and spilled into the stands, leading to the arrest of Shack and Zeidel. In 1960, the AHL suspended Zeidel for five games after he kicked Michel Harvey of Quebec during a fight. In 1963, he was suspended for four games and fined $100 for a stick-swinging fight with Willie O’Ree.\n\nAfter the NHL doubled in size with the 1967 expansion, Zeidel, aged 39, prepared an illustrated brochure describing his hockey skills, which he sent to the six new teams. Philadelphia Flyers general manager Ed Snider signed the defenceman, who had not skated in an NHL game in 13 seasons.\n\nIt was while with the Flyers that Zeidel renewed his feud with Shack, who was by then playing for the Boston Bruins. Philadelphia’s arena had lost part of its roof in a storm, so Flyers home games were moved to neutral territory. On March 7, 1968, in a game played at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, Zeidel and Shack engaged in an ugly, stick-swinging brawl midway through the first period. Both men were bruised and cut, Zeidel enduring a nasty gash to his forehead. Both men were assessed match penalties and NHL president Clarence Campbell suspended Shack for three games and Zeidel for four.\n\nCampbell denied reports that Zeidel had been subjected to anti-Semitic slurs. His assessment was backed up by Flyers general manager Ed Snider. “It appears that in the heat of the battle during an important game, Larry might have struck the first blow,” Snider said. “Shack had nothing to do with any vicious name-calling and reports of competitive baiting were blown far out of proportion.\n\nYet, two spectators at the game in Toronto sent separate telegrams to the NHL offices describing slurs they heard from the Bruins bench. Mary Patterson wrote “the remarks were uncalled for an ignorant.”\n\nMike Meade, who attended with his wife, named a player and described the slur he heard, which was later rendered by newspapers as “you Jewish …, you Jewish …”\n\nIn 2007, the sportswriter Gerald Eskenazi related that Zeidel said a Bruins player had yelled at him, “You’re next for the gas ovens, Zeidel!” Zeidel also said the player who said so was not Shack. The player remains unidentified.\n\nZeidel wound up his career by lacing up for nine games with the Flyers in 1968-69. He retired instead of returning to the minors. He became an investment advisor and, for a time, provided commentary on broadcasts of Flyers games.\n\nLast year, the Philadelphia Daily News reported Zeidel had been taken in by a neighbouring family after he fell sick. He lived in a basement bedroom, where he was visited by former teammates Joe Watson and Bernie Parent.\n\nZeidel is survived by four children and his estranged wife, Marie. He also leaves 10 grandchildren. He was predeceased by two brothers. The family’s paid obituary notice noted he had donated to Boston University’s CTE (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy) Center to advance the safety of athletes in future.\n\nRalph William Nattrass\n\nBorn: May 26, 1925 (Gainsborough, Saskatchewan)\n\nDied: April 30, 2014 (Edmonton, Alberta)\n\nA bruising defenceman who spent four seasons in the NHL, Ralph Nattrass played good defence on some bad Chicago Black Hawks teams.\n\nThe 6-foot, 185-pound rearguard made his NHL debut on Dec. 8, 1946, firing a pair of 60-foot shots past Montreal goalie Bill Durnan. He also added an assist on a goal by Doug Bentley, but the Canadiens won the game in Chicago, 5-3. The Associated Press account of the game praised the young defenceman’s “tremendous stick power.”\n\nNattrass skated in 35 games in his rookie season, but he was a regular among the Hawks’ blue-line corps for three seasons from 1947-50. He was often paired with Bill Gadsby, a future member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 223 NHL games, Nattrass scored 18 goals with 38 assists. He also received 308 penalty minutes. He never skated in an NHL playoff game.\n\nIn one of his final NHL games, he engaged in a memorable brawl with Murray Henderson of the Boston Bruins. The players high-sticked one another and Nattrass was assessed a misconduct for roughing up two linesman. He was also assessed a match misconduct. “The fight began anew when the two reached the penalty box,” the AP reported, “and Henderson was given an additional misconduct for his part.”\n\nBorn in a farm village in southeastern Saskatchewan, Nattress played juvenile for the Melita Bombers before joining the Moose Jaw Canucks for two seasons of junior play. The Canucks lost the 1945 Memorial Cup by four games to one to the Toronto St. Michael’s Majors. The defenceman scored nine goals and added five assists in 17 playoff games, while recording a leading 33 minutes in penalties.\n\nHe had been spotted by former NHL goalie Tiny Thompson, who recommended him to the Hawks. Nattrass turned professional with the Kansas City Pla-Mors in 1945-46, helping them win the regular-season and playoff championships in the inaugural season of the United States Hockey League.\n\nAt the 1950 training camp in North Bay, Ont., Nattrass skirmished with Harry Lumley, a new goalie acquired by the Hawks. Chicago then demoted the defenceman to Milwaukee, but he refused to report. On Oct. 4, he was traded to the Montreal Canadiens. He spent the season with their American Hockey League farm team, the Cincinnati Mohawks, where he recorded no goals with 30 assists in his final pro hockey campaign.\n\nThe retired defenceman worked as an NHL linesman in the 1954-55 season.\n\nNattrass sold cars for a living while playing hockey, one of many enterprises in which he engaged in a long business career."
