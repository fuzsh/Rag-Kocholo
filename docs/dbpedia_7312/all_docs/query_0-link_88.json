        "text": "The Tampa Bay Lightning has emerged as one of the best teams in the N.H.L., with stars like Steven Stamkos, Martin St. Louis and Vincent Lecavalier. But it is being transformed in other ways during its first full season under a new owner, Jeffrey Vinik, and new general manager, Steve Yzerman.\n\nLast week, the Lightning unveiled a redesigned uniform for next season  a simple, classic, traditional look for a nontraditional market.\n\n“The long-term goal is for the Lightning to be an iconic franchise, rich in tradition with championship values and a strong legacy,” Yzerman said at the unveiling at St. Pete Times Forum.\n\nRedesigning the Lightning’s uniforms took six painstaking months.\n\n“This is a big, long process involving researchers and writers and designers and strategists,” said Ed O’Hara, the chief creative officer of SME Branding, the New York firm hired to make the Lightning crest and uniforms evocative of hockey’s roots.\n\nThe path to rebranding the Lightning was littered with discarded sketches for jersey and crest designs, cashiered concepts for remaking the team’s image and weekly speakerphone conferences between New York and Florida to hash it all out.\n\nIt ultimately led to a simple blue-and-white uniform: a clean design redolent of the N.H.L.’s Original Six. Tampa Bay’s uniform is only the third in the league to use just two colors, after the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Detroit Red Wings.\n\n“We’re not trying to reinvent the wheel here,” Yzerman said. “We’re just going back to the basics of what a hockey uniform is.”\n\nThe club had been more successful than most Sun Belt teams in its 19-year history, winning the Stanley Cup title in 2004 and at times drawing large crowds. But in recent years, attendance dropped amid speculation that the team would move, exacerbated by a feud between the owners: Oren Koules, a producer of the “Saw” horror movies, and Len Barrie, a British Columbia real estate developer.\n\n“There’s been some uncertainty: two owners who didn’t see eye to eye,” said Tod Leiweke, who was hired last July as the chief executive after holding the same job with the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe rebranding of the Lightning had another point. “For those who think we’ll apologize for being a Southern market hockey team, well, we don’t feel that way,” Leiweke said.\n\nWithin a week of his hiring, Leiweke called SME, a 15-employee firm that has handled marketing campaigns, uniform design and branding efforts for more than a dozen N.H.L. clubs, as well as other professional sports teams and corporations.\n\n“They needed something bold, iconic, hockey-centric, classic,” O’Hara said.\n\n“We started with a bunch of really rough ideas  some fly and some don’t,” he added, leafing through sketches that played off lightning bolts, the bridges spanning the bay between Tampa and St. Petersburg and various typographic treatments of T.B., T.B.L. and Tampa Bay.\n\n“Some things you just have to sketch out so you can get them out of your system,” O’Hara said.\n\nHaving narrowed the concepts to adhere to Leiweke’s mandate of a classic design connoting “tradition, stability and commitment to the community,” O’Hara and his team sent mock-ups to Tampa Bay.\n\nA lightning bolt crest was decided on, not unlike the current crest but simplified, without shadowing or wording. The bolt was put in a three-quarters circle, but that was discarded as being too reminiscent of a hammer and sickle. A full circle followed and was eventually modified into a subtly horizontal oval to suggest forward movement.\n\nEither Vinik, Leiweke, Yzerman or Steve Griggs, the chief operating officer, was in on every call. But for final approval, everyone generally deferred to Yzerman, whose 20-year tenure as the captain of the Red Wings was the longest in North American sports. By November, SME and the Lightning had settled on blue and white, with two blues in contention: the deep blue used by the Maple Leafs and the navy used by the Yankees.\n\nO’Hara favored the deep blue, the main color in the Lightning’s current palette of blue, black, white and silver-gray. He had Reebok make a jersey in each blue, and in a November conference call, team executives overwhelmingly concurred.\n\nThe rest of the call was devoted to whether the numbers on the sleeve should go inside or above the single horizontal stripe, and whether the stripe was too high on the arm.\n\nThey applied what O’Hara called a TV test to both sleeve treatments  a videotaped session in which a player wears a mock-up and goes through the actions he would in a game.\n\n“Can you read the numbers? Is the logo registering?” O’Hara said, reeling off what the test can reveal. “Sometimes when a guy is skating in full pads, a biceps stripe that looked fine on a hanger can seem to disappear into the guy’s armpit.”\n\nBy mid-January, the final uniform design was ready, and the league  which had approved an accelerated timetable for the change  signed off.\n\nThe uniforms were unveiled as part what Leiweke said was an across-the-board transformation project that included a $2-million-a-year charitable campaign; a program in which season-ticket holders would receive a team sweater with a microchip that entitled them to food and merchandise discounts; and a renovation of the St. Pete Times Forum.\n\nO’Hara, looking back on the process and the uniform that resulted, said: “I love it. I can’t wait to wear one.”"
