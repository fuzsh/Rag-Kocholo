I was (un)lucky enough to have attended game 7 – I walked into Rogers Arena that night knowing I was either going to bear witness to the greatest sporting event this city had ever seen (yes, even greater than the 2010 Gold Medal Olympic game), or alternatively, endure the worst heartbreak since our beloved Canucks lost to the evil Rangers in 1994. Unfortunately it was the latter, and for myself, I couldn’t bear the sight of the Stanley Cup being ecstatically paraded around our home ice by another team – so I left with about five minutes remaining in the third, miraculous comeback be damned.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nLast season was a magical one for the team in blue and green, but injuries, failed officiating and disciplinary systems, horrible goaltending in the crunch, and a lack of production from key contributors all caught up to them, and they just couldn’t muster up enough to put them over the top.\n\nAlthough the team’s been successful, it’s strangely been a tough season to be a Canucks fan. On the ice, they have been masterful at times and average at others, garnering enough points even when not at their best to currently sit second in the NHL and Western Conference. The regular season is important – it keeps us entertained and helps us understand what we have come playoff time, and of course it determines whether or not we will have home ice advantage and against whom. Like every regular season, this one has had its highlights – defeating Boston in their rink being the biggest – that keep us going.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nStill, for me, most of the team’s games are coloured by the knowledge that for the most part, once the playoffs start, this regular season will quickly become irrelevant. I love the team, I love writing about them, analyzing them, discussing issues that affect them, and so on. And while we all watch, discuss, blog about, read, and consume everything Canucks, none of it will matter once the puck drops in the playoffs. That’s when the Canucks marketing machine will remind us, “This Is What We Live For”.\n\nSo here we are, now a mere 14 games away from the tournament – or the equivalent of two, seven game series. We are close. And much like last year’s playoffs, these fourteen games will go by in a flash. With that in mind, and with the trade deadline in the rear view mirror, it seems like an appropriate time to take stock of what we have with this current version of the Canucks, and how ready it is for the 2012 playoffs.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nHOW HAS THE REGULAR SEASON GONE – IN REGULATION?\n\nThe 2012 Canucks are six points behind their President’s Trophy winning pace set in 2011. That said, the composition of the team’s points total is much different. In examining standings, it’s my belief that looking at a team’s record in games decided in regulation time is a much better indicator of overall team strength than is the NHL’s “everyone gets points” system that keeps playoff races close.\n\nIf you changed the standings to reward teams that win in regulation by awarding three points for a regulation win instead of two (keeping the other awarded points the same), the Canucks would sit tied for third in the league with the Red Wings, behind the Blues and Rangers, and ahead of the Predators, Penguins, Flyers, and Bruins. At their current pace, using this points system, the Canucks would finish the season with a solid 147 points, 9 behind the Blues.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThis is in stark contrast to last season, when the Canucks dominant record in games decided in regulation would have propelled them to a whopping 163 points, a full 16 points ahead of the second place Flyers. Interestingly, the Bruins would have placed third using this measure, just one point in arrears of Philadelphia – this compared to the Bruins seventh overall placing using the wacky current-day points system. Perhaps we didn’t give the 2011 Bruins enough credit – the quality of their wins, and their season, was masked by the league’s points system.\n\nAs anyone who follows the team knows, it feels like the Canucks have had a ton of games go to overtime. Well, it’s true – this season, the Canucks have seen 29% of their games go to the extra session, whereas last year they only saw 21% of their contests require overtime. They are having trouble finding that extra goal, or keeping that last one out, that would enable them to finish off their opponents in regulation.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThey are in the top six in the NHL in both goals for and against, and while these are strong points, last season they finished ranked first in both categories. All in all – the Canucks are not blowing teams away the way they did last year, they just aren’t as dominant a team.\n\nIS THE TEAM NOW BETTER CONSTRUCTED FOR THE PLAYOFFS?\n\nGillis’ moves at the deadline were very telling about how Canucks’ management viewed their roster. A couple weeks before the deadline, in an interview coach Alain Vigneault contrasted his third line to last season, intimating that this year, he didn’t feel comfortable playing it against the opposition’s top players. When he is free to do this his team has typically found success, as the Sedin and Kesler lines are able to generate chances when faced with lesser opposition. That fact, along with the apparent discontent within Hodgson’s camp over his ice time, combine to make the Kassian and Pahlsson moves make a lot of sense. When the trades first went down I was against them, and while I still think Gillis gave up a future bona fide scoring centre, they were necessary to give the team what Gillis believed it needed. The lineup is now much more adaptable to the myriad of potential opponents and styles we’ll face in the playoffs.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAlso of note is the marked change in how the games are currently being officiated. In analysing the extended slump the Canucks’ power play is currently in (8 for 70 or 11.4% since January 7), the Canucks are just not getting the volume of power plays they were earlier in the season. You can see it – the officiating standard on “obstruction” fouls such as hooking, holding, interference, and the like has obviously changed – and it’s been confirmed statistically by Canuck blogger Daniel Wagner. I have my own theories as to why this is the case, but that’s an angle to discuss another day.\n\nRegardless, I believe Gillis realized what was going on and decided that his team needed to adapt, and all his moves have been geared toward these changes. The officiating has changed, and there are now more defensive “lock down” teams, especially in the West (now not just Nashville, but also St. Louis, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Dallas). The Rangers, playing a similar suffocating style, are in first place in the East. Other than the Canucks foibles this week (allowing five goals to each of Buffalo and Dallas), they have been quick studies – their 2-0 shutout of current league-leading St. Louis last week and another recent win against Phoenix being prime examples. The Canucks haven’t been giving up a lot of goals, and that will keep them competitive in almost any game.\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAt the end of the day, I’d contend the Canucks lost last year not for the reasons they so publicly stated (they ran into a hot goaltender, they had trouble scoring, the power play didn’t produce), but because they had trouble keeping the puck out of the net. Consider – of the three games the Canucks won in the finals, they allowed two goals against, combined. In their four losses, they allowed 21. I think those facts speak for themselves. The Nashville series was similar, the Canucks struggling to score, but winning as a result of also being able to suppress goals against. The only series in which the power play was a major factor was the San Jose series, which was over in five games (this of course being the best example of what should have been, had the games been officiated appropriately in the finals).\n\nAdvertisement 10\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWith all that in mind – while they aren’t as flashy, and haven’t been as dominant this regular season, those qualities disappeared at times in last season’s Cup run, and the Canucks struggled to win when they did. Conversely, this year, it appears that they are better constructed for a long playoff run. The team is extremely deep – in addition to today’s roster carrying four extra NHL-calibre skaters (including Keith Ballard), they have at least four forwards in the AHL that could step in to play NHL minutes (Duco, Bitz, Reinprecht, Mancari) if injuries again become a problem. The defense is nine players deep, providing Vigneault a ton of options.\n\nGillis has also improved the top-six forwards compared to last year, when Kesler’s lack of wings caused him to be frequently referred to as a helicopter. He’s now got Booth and Higgins to play alongside him (potentially Kassian, Burrows, or Hansen depending on what else is happening up and down the roster). The acquisition of Kassian also gives Vigneault different looks he can put on the ice – it seems he can play on any line, and thereby change the roster’s makeup on any given night.\n\nAdvertisement 11\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOverall – the Canucks have a deep, adaptable roster and can now realistically state they can ice a lineup that can compete with any team in the league, playing any different style – a much different situation than last year.\n\nGOALTENDING\n\nIn last year’s playoff run, Cory Schneider’s appearances gave us a glimpse into what we have had all season and will have in the coming playoffs – two bona fide number one goaltenders.\n\nWhile I’m a Roberto Luongo fan, I still have my fears – he’s melted down four times in the last three playoff years (Chicago X 3, Boston). What’s encouraging is the knowledge that if he comes out and lays any eggs like he did against the Bruins, the coach and the other 18 guys on the ice will be extremely confident in moving to Schneider in a hurry. They’ve seen him come up big this year – games against Boston, San Jose, and Chicago come to mind – and they all will be confident that he can win the toughest of games. At this point, in retrospect, those starts by coach Vigneault seem brilliant.\n\nAdvertisement 12\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMOTIVATION AND RECENT SLUMP\n\nSo with such a playoff-ready team and rock-solid goaltending, why have the Canucks struggled over the past month, and especially since the deadline? That’s not an easy question to answer, but overall, they appear to be a bit tired, and are simply being outworked physically and beaten mentally by these teams that are already in playoff-mode.\n\nOn one hand, this has disaster written all over it – if the team can’t perform well in these playoff-style games now, how can they be expected to compete once the playoffs roll around? On the other hand, one can view this lull as positive, as the team is learning to work through adversity – adversity that they haven’t faced in any significant way since early this season, but that is sure to come when the playoffs arrive.\n\nAdvertisement 13\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nLuckily, the Canucks have history on their side. The last five Stanley Cup winners experienced some sort of swoon at some point between January and March. It’s too difficult to keep up a torrid pace for the entire 82 game schedule. If we the fans are waiting in anticipation of the playoffs, imagine what it’s like for the team, especially with the division effectively wrapped up weeks ago. I have confidence that this veteran group will sort itself out and come to play when the games really matter.\n\nSimilarly, I’d rather the twins go through a seven game stretch without scoring now, as opposed to an entire playoff series. They really need to produce for the team to get positive results – their lack of production in last year’s Nashville and Boston series really put a lot of stress on the rest of the lineup. Even during this most recent slump, they have been generating chances, they just aren’t going in. Remember they faced three Norris-calibre defensemen in the three series last year – with any luck, the puck will start to go in again, and they won’t have to run a similar gauntlet this postseason.\n\nAdvertisement 14\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFor those reasons – I’m really not concerned about the team’s recent performances. They need the rest, they need the break, they need the mental ease. Tonight’s game against Winnipeg was competitive and entertaining, and the hard-fought, come-from-behind win was a step in the right direction.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nCompared to the team that came within a game of the Cup last spring, the Canucks 2012 Playoff Edition has much better depth, more versatility, better goaltending, and can play the game a number of different ways. They are in a bit of a lull, but based on their ridiculous schedule and the fact they’re resting up for the postseason, this shouldn’t be viewed as a negative – the recent malaise shouldn’t be of major concern.
