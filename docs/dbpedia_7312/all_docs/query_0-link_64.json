        "text": "The Vancouver Canucks are in the midst of their best season since Daniel and Henrik Sedin were still the driving forces of the offense. The Canucks led the Western Conference for long stretches of the 2023-24 campaign, and currently sit three points back of the Dallas Stars with six games to go. They do still lead the Pacific, a division the team has never won since it evolved from the Northwest Division in 2013 — with a seven-point lead on Connor McDavid and the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nIf you told a fan of this franchise that the above would be the case back in October, they'd be thrilled. It's been over a decade since an iteration of a Nucks team won 50 games, but at 47-21-8 — and with an equal amount of home and road games left down the stretch — there's at least a decent chance it will be No. 50 for the first time since 2011-12 (51). In 2010-11, the Canucks won a franchise-record 54 contests before marching all the way to the Stanley Cup Final for the third time in franchise history.\n\nComparing today's Vancouver with a roster from over a decade ago is pointless to the present, but there's no doubt that the Canucks have the weapons to make noise in the 2024 Stanley Cup Playoffs. Although the Western Conference is a gauntlet, and top teams are being upset more and more in general — just look at the Avalanche and Bruins last year — Vancouver is well-positioned to at least win a playoff round for the first time since 2020. Here are a couple reasons why the Nucks have at least a decent shot to end one of the longest Stanley Cup droughts in the history of the league.\n\nCanucks are phenomenal defensively, with key offensive firepower\n\nThe Canucks proved they were for real right from the start of the campaign. The roster won 12 of 16 games out of the gate, immediately vaulting to the top of the Western Conference and staying among the top teams throughout. And the star power has been the catalyst. Quinn Hughes is in the midst of his best season — by far — after being named captain, and he is the favorite, if not a shoo-in to win the Norris Trophy as the league's best defenseman.\n\nJT Miller is enjoying another phenomenal, energized campaign in Vancouver as well; he's up to 35 goals and 96 points in 76 games, and looks poised to shatter the 100-point mark for the first time (his career-high is 99). Brock Boeser is scoring again, with a team-leading 38, while Elias Pettersson has a new contract and has amassed 85 points of his own.\n\nThe top players in Vancouver all came to play right from the start of 2023-24, and it's carried this team to its sparkling record. What also can't be ignored is the incredible play of the third line — Conor Garland, Dakota Joshua, Teddy Blueger — which was one of the best third lines in the league before Joshua went down with injury. He's healthy now, and if that line gets put back together and starts playing like it did earlier in the year, it adds yet another weapon to the offense. That trio is constantly in the offensive zone and building chemistry on a game-by-game basis.\n\nEverything seems to have meshed well for the Canucks this year, and the addition of Nikita Zadorov on the back end has also been crucial, especially with injuries to Carson Soucy and Tyler Myers. All of them are healthy now, and along with Hughes, help make up one of the better defensive units in the league. Vancouver gives up just 2.66 goals per game, good enough for fifth in the league. With an offense averaging 3.42 tallies — ranking sixth — it's clear that this is an elite unit at both ends of the rink. When Elias Lindholm returns from injury, he should be a huge help in both facets of the game after the two-way Swede was acquired by the Canucks earlier in the season.\n\nAnd the team has been doing it all lately without their starting goaltender.\n\nThe return of bubble Thatcher Demko?\n\nThe Canucks have won nine of their last 14 games, but have played at just over a .500 pace since star goaltender Thatcher Demko suffered an injury in a 5-0 win over the Winnipeg Jets on March 10. Demko was having a fantastic season, with a sparkling .917 save percentage, excellent 2.47 goals-against average and five shutouts.\n\nAfter a fully healthy offseason, Demko was putting together a true Vezina Trophy-caliber season. The injury was hugely disappointing, but the hope in British Columbia is that the American can return to the lineup before the playoffs. He had been especially phenomenal in his three starts before the ailment, giving up just two goals on 64 shots in victories over the Kings, Golden Knights and Jets.\n\nCanucks fans will not soon forget bubble Demko from 2020. Vancouver first beat Minnesota in a shortened five-game series before upsetting the defending Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues in six games. In the second-round, the Canucks ran into a much superior Golden Knights team, but came back from 3-1 down to force a decisive Game 7. Those were mainly due to Demko's antics; he was nearly unbeatable in Games 5-7. Although the team would go on to lose 1-0 in the decider, Demko turned heads across the hockey world with his masterful playoff performance.\n\nDemko returning from injury and finding his early-season form will be a critical factor in how far this team goes in 2024. If he comes back strong, the Canucks probably have as good a chance as any team of coming out of the Western Conference. With a group of responsible two-way forwards led by a couple true stars, along with a mobile, puck-moving blue line headlined by one of the best D-men in the league, this is the best roster Vancouver has iced in over a decade. And they're hungry for success.\n\nWhether or not it will lead to the franchise's first Stanley Cup championship since its inception in 1970 is up in the air. But, for the first time since 2015, there will be playoff hockey at Rogers Arena this April."
