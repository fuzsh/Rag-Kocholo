        "text": "Known as the catfish capital of the U.S., famous for its long stretches of beach along the Gulf Coast, Mississippi is also the place to come face to face with alligators foraging in swamplands, a place to discover unlimited road biking opportunities, and a place packed with tranquil stretches of river for paddling. The birthplace of Oprah Winfrey, Elvis Presley, and B.B. King is also home to business owners who have turned this Deep South state into an emerging outdoor adventure destination. From canoe companies offering dugout trips down the Mississippi River to tiny home communities nestled against historic running and biking trails, there is a bit of everything for the hardcore outdoor enthusiast and the curious nature traveler.\n\nBeing an adventurer at heart, I made sure our north-to-south itinerary was packed with nature-based activities that ranged from kayaking to road biking.\n\nMy older cousin and I landed in Memphis, crossed the Tennessee-Mississippi border, and began our trip in Clarksdale, Mississippi, a small town with a population of fewer than 19,000 residents and known as the “Birthplace of Blues” for having spawned so many musical legends, from Muddy Waters to Sam Cooke. Filled with historic buildings housing juke joints, record shops, and blues clubs, Clarksdale was also unexpectedly home to the Quapaw Canoe Company, an outfitter that leads expeditions down the Mississippi River.\n\nAfter meeting up with African American naturalist guide Mark River, we set off in a dugout canoe on a stretch of the sediment-rich Mississippi with a leisurely 45-minute paddle to the nearby Montezuma Island. After we landed, the plentiful cottonwood trees rained down white cottony seeds all around us like snow. One of my most peaceful moments in recent memory is sitting at the edge of the island’s sandbank and watching bass and carp jump while turtles poked their heads out of the water and minnows nipped at the dead skin on my feet.\n\nSome must-dos in Clarksdale include catching live blues music in the evenings at the Hambone Gallery and starting your day with coffee and muffins at the local hipster café, Meraki. Needless to say, our trip was off with a bang.\n\nStarkville, Mississippi, is home to Mississippi State University and a 2.5-hour drive from Clarksdale. The destination immediately had a college-y town feel to it with its small, downtown area filled with bookstores, boutiques, and diners. We stopped for the day, explored the campus, and refueled at Nutrigroove, a small health-conscious eatery tucked away across from the main entrance. Some of the standout menu items were the cherry acai bowl; strawberry and blueberry bagels, and the beauty smoothies, infused with hyaluronic acid and probiotics for healthy skin and hair.\n\nAfter leaving Starkville, we spent a few days in Ridgeland, a suburb of Jackson, the state capital. We rented bikes and rode several miles along the Natchez Trace, a primitive trail traveled by Native Americans for thousands of years that stretches 400 miles from Natchez, Mississippi, to Nashville, Tennessee. Some of the sights I took in while biking: canopies of maple, hickory, oak, and pine; small, murky swamps; openings to weedy campgrounds; and a cute snake in the middle of the trail.\n\nIf you’re driving down the adjacent Natchez Trace Parkway, Milepost 22 is worth a stop. Here you can traverse a wooden boardwalk that hovers above the Cypress Swamp. The cypress and tupelo tree-laden waters were populated by several juvenile alligators that measured around three feet. It was difficult to spot them in the swamp water at first since their bodies camouflaged nicely, but as you look closer you can see them moving slowly while turtles sun on nearby branches.\n\nI recommend a stay at the AC Hotel Jackson Ridgeland and taking a cycling or yoga class a few steps away at The Club, a mega health center with a steam room, fitness center, and lap pool.\n\nThe capital of Jackson was established 200 years ago in 1822, and it has a checkered past. It is the location of the world’s first heart and lung transplants. It is also where civil rights leader Medgar Evers was shot and killed in 1963 while standing in his driveway.\n\nWe stayed at the Fairview Inn, a historic mansion from 1903 that is now a chic bed and breakfast. Here it’s possible to find meditative moments in the tons of outdoor space where red jays flit around stately trees, or you can choose to roast marshmallows over the eight-seater fire pit. Jackson was also the place where I could wind down from my adventuring with massages and pampering. I spent a few hours at the Westin Jackson’s Soul Spa, which was equipped with a jacuzzi, dry sauna, multi-jet experience shower experience, and peaceful massage rooms.\n\nThe last stop on my road trip was to the southern Mississippi city of Hattiesburg and one of the most tranquil parts of the voyage. After the one-hour drive from Jackson, we checked into the Longleaf Piney Resort, a collection of tiny houses in Hattiesburg with kitchenettes, comfortable beds, and TVs if you need some reverse digital detox.\n\nYou can rent manual or e-bikes from the resort and travel along some 50 miles of paved concrete on the Longleaf Trace Trail, which runs adjacent to the tiny homes. For food, a favorite stop was T Bones Records & Cafe, a record shop with gifts, memorabilia, and an eatery offering healthy fare from green salads to sandwiches with locally sourced produce.\n\nAfter sailing, scuba diving, and nursing tequila hangovers over the years in the popular Mexico playground of Cabo San Lucas, I wanted to see what other destinations were worth exploring in the region. In the middle of the Baja California peninsula, the sleepy desert town of Loreto called my name.\n\nFriends who recommended the cobblestone-clad town correctly described it as a peaceful town with a rocky, golden, arid landscape and white sand beaches with usually very few people around. Downtown Loreto itself is awash in colorful family-run restaurants with local artisan décor; a handful of boutique accommodations, which each house a modest 15 or fewer rooms; and a sleepy boardwalk perfect for running, stretching, or copping a quick yoga session on La Darsena beach.\n\nPerhaps even more noteworthy: In 1694 Loreto became the destination of the first mission established by the Spaniards in the entire Californias region. It’s also home to Loreto Bay National Park: a 200,000-plus hectare (almost 500,000 acres) marine area comprising five islands that was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.\n\nI’m an adventurer at heart, so my first move was to explore the Loreto Bay National Park: Catalana, Montserrat, Dazante, del Carmen, and Coronado are the islands that make up the largest marine protected area in the Gulf of California. I signed up for diving with Dolphin Dive Baja, which has PADI-certified dive instructors and dive masters that lead tours throughout the national park. For one of my dives, we visited Coronado Island, a volcanic landmass with rocky wall structures and intricate crevices created over scores of years with around eight healthy dive sites. As we approached, you could immediately hear the raucous barking of the male sea lions sunning on the island and in the water.\n\nOnce we geared up and descended, the sea lion pups dove in the water to play around us on the sandy bottom. Even if you’re not a diver, you can also snorkel along the perimeter of the island and interact with the pups as they careen off of the rocky structure. Coronado is also home to healthy amounts of tropical fish such as angelfish, parrotfish, and pufferfish that you can either dive or snorkel to see. Other marine life to look out for while exploring the national park include the slow moving Cortez conch, hermit crabs, moray eels, sea stars, and elusive seahorses.\n\nWhat I Did to Fall Back in Love with Baja California\n\nMEMORY LANE\n\nWinston Ross\n\nOn the return trip, we passed Carmen Island, which was nicknamed “white gold” back in the day because of the now defunct salt mine. Although I didn’t have a chance to try it, I saw seven tents propped up on the island and learned about kayaking companies like Sea Kayak Adventures that offer camping on the beach for around one week and they make an effort to allow guests to spend 2 nights per island. Being planted on a remote island to experience nocturnal nature sounds, fresh seafood, and active kayaking can only be described as an outdoorsy girl’s dream. Back in downtown Loreto, a must try culinary experience is the Almejas chocolatas (chocolate clam) buffet that takes place every Saturday at the Hotel Oasis. They put on a presentation of the traditional pre-Hispanic chocolate clams preparation: a fire pit in the middle of the sandy beach is covered with chamizo branches which creates a combination of roasting and steaming of the shellfish.\n\nBefore leaving Loreto, I saw Loreto Bay National Park through a different lens: by boat. ABT Sailing is a professional marine company with well-maintained boats and offer excursions from the mangrove-lined marina of Puerto Escondido. Depending on the time of the year, you can see manta rays by the hundreds near the marina in June and July and blue and humpback whales in January through March near Dazante Bay as 60 percent of the world’s mammals come to this area. The most impactful part of the sailing tour was the “honeymoon cove” at Dazante island where you can disembark, hike, and see all five islands of the bay in under 30 minutes. Some sights to look out for are the yellow footed gull (endemic to the Bay); pelicans; seagulls; and flora like the purple Mamilaria flowers and the Copal plant, whose sweet-smelling gum the missionaries used for incense.\n\nAfter a few Vitamin D-soaked days in Loreto, I said goodbye and boarded a 45-minute flight south to La Paz, Mexico, also located along the Baja Peninsula, which unfolded as a desert landscape around me as we descended. However, during the taxi ride over it was immediately apparent that the boardwalk of La Paz is the main attraction to the destination, containing trendy seafood restaurants like La Faim (casual dining) and Bismarkcito (a ’60s era establishment), high-end hotels, and tons of outdoor retailers from bike and scooter to watersport shops. The crowd was a mixture of couples, families, and groups of friends celebrating birthdays or last days as bachelors.\n\nADVERTISING\n\nI Just Took the Greatest Road Trip of My Life\n\nIT’S STILL A BIG WORLD\n\nWilliam O’Connor\n\nTo get away from the hustle and bustle of the boardwalk, I took an hour speedboat journey from the La Paz marina to the UNESCO World Heritage site, Espiritu Santo. One of the imposing islands in the destination, Los Islotes, houses a sea lion colony of 500: a combination of males, females and juvenile mammals and the largest sea lion colony in the Baja Californias. After my experience in Loreto, I became obsessed with the playful animals. They did not disappoint: several lithe pups nibbled my hand, fins, cameras, and even pulled at my hair. At the dive site, I also encountered thousands of sardines swarming around with cormorants, which are diving birds that create this artistic parting of large schools of fish. Snorkelers can encounter colorful sergeant majors, parrotfish, and sea turtles if choosing to explore from the surface.\n\nThe La Paz vibe that sticks out most in my mind is the local energy that urges you to be outside walking or biking the Malecon, dining, or shopping (be sure to visit the old Chinatown strip, now an arts and crafts market where you can score everything from artisanal wood sculptures to traditional shot glass souvenirs). For example, I challenged my Spanish skills while sampling artisanal dishes at Hambrusia with its Spanish-only menu and ordered craftfully done fish tacos. Feeling fancy one night, I dined at Nemi, a romantic spot with dusky grey and blue accent walls lit only by candlelight and Edison lightbulbs. I ordered the sugar, sea salt, and Mezcal marinated sea bass with white asparagus from Ensenada. As I washed my meal down with organic beer at the Panderia Pan D’Les bar, I also savored the essence of the Bajas: the smell of salt on the air with the colorful locals all around me that guaranteed a future return.\n\nIf you're a diving enthusiast, interacting with sea lions is an experience that should be at the top of your bucket list.These beautiful mammals guarantee a show, swimming loops around you and even coming up to nibble at your gear or your exhaled bubbles. Interacting with sea lions makes traveling to dive sites around the world totally worth the trip. From rocky outcroppings in the middle of the Sea of Cortez, Mexico to exotic islands in the South Pacific, here are seven places to dive with these charismatic and daringly friendly creatures:\n\nLos Isolotes is renowned for it’s population of playful sea lions.\n\nShutterstock.com/wildestanimal\n\nLos Islotes, Mexico\n\nFrom the marina of La Paz, Mexico, it is an hour speedboat journey to the UNESCO World Heritage site, Espiritu Santo. One of the imposing islands in the destination, Los Islotes, houses a sea lion colony of 500: a combination of males, females and juvenile mammals and the largest sea lion colony in the Baja Californias. Book one of several dive shops in La Paz and they will anchor in a prime location next to the island. Once you descend, interact with the playful pups that will nibble your hand, fins, cameras, and peck at your hair. You may also encounter thousands of sardines swarming around you as well as colorful sergeant majors and parrotfish. Note that the dive site is closed June through August to respect the safety of the sea lions’ mating season.\n\nRelated Reading: Six Awesome Animal Encounters in Mexico’s Baja Sur\n\nNew Zealand sea lions, once known as Hooker sea lions. is endemic to mainland and subantarctic New Zealand.\n\nShutterstock.com/John Carnemolla\n\nSouth Island, New Zealand\n\nThe New Zealand sea lion is one of the rarest species of sea lion due to being almost eradicated by Māori hunters in the 1700s. Luckily, numbers are recovering and colonies are now well established at the Caitlins and Otago Peninsula. The mammals frequent the coast of the South Island from Kaikoura all the way down to Dunedin. Both destinations offer organized diving tours to get up close to sea lions during the months of October through May, the spring and summer seasons in New Zealand.\n\nPlay With Caution\n\nIt’s important to keep in mind that no matter the location, keep your distance and don’t make eye contact with the males (distinguished by their size and bump on their foreheads) as they will consider you a threat.\n\nWANT MORE OF THIS?\n\nSign up for Scuba Diving’s weekly email and never miss another story.\n\nBy submitting above, you agree to\n\nScuba Diving's privacy policy.\n\nA diver watches as a Galapagos sea lion swims by.\n\nShutterstock.com/AndreaIzzotti\n\nLeon Dormido, Galapagos Islands\n\nThe sea lion population in the Galapagos is estimated to be around 50,000 with the pups born during the Garua season from June through November. Boating 10 miles from the capital of Galapagos, Baquerizo Moreno, you arrive at the island of Leon Dormido, one of the most photographed places in the archipelago. Here you can find a large sea lion colony, where there is a good chance pups will get up close and personal with you during your dive. Also keep an eye out for other impressive marine life including sharks, rays, turtles and endemic birds like the Galapagos duck and the blue-winged teal.\n\nRelated Reading: The Charismatic Animals You Can Only Dive With in the Galapagos\n\nPlayful Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) underwater near Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada.\n\nShutterstock.com/WilliamDrumm\n\nHornby Island, British Columbia\n\nDivers that love cold waters should head to Hornby Island, British Columbia, a fascinating place to see sea lions during the winter. The species of Steller sea lions are known to accelerate to speeds up to 30 knots. Even with their size and speed, they are not violent, but they can be very cheeky and may nibble and tug on your gear when you’re not looking. This is a great experience for novice divers, as dive operators use an anchor for every dive for easy entry and exit.\n\nOften called the puppies of the sea, these Australian sea lions sure aren't shy!\n\nShutterstock.com/Imagine Earth Photography\n\nHopkins Island, Australia\n\nLocated in South Australia, Hopkins Island is home to a population of Australian sea lions and with 15,000 individuals left in the world, they are one of the rarest species. With 80% of species found in South Australia, you can dive with these lions in abundant numbers at the Seal Cove dive site. Keep an eye out for other local fauna on the shark tooth-shaped island like little penguins and the short-tailed shearwater.\n\nSea lions lay on a boat in Santa Barbara, California.\n\nShutterstock.com/Jon Osumi\n\nSanta Barbara Island, California\n\nPlanted in the California Channel Islands, Santa Barbara is the smallest of five islands and is situated 44 miles from Redondo Beach. The population of sea lions at dive sites like Shag Rock and Landing Cove are mainly females and pups that are known to dive bomb in front of you and playfully blow bubbles. A wetsuit is recommended if visiting as the water temperatures can swing between 50F and 60F throughout the year.\n\nRelated Reading: How to Dive Lobos Rocks in Monterey Bay\n\nSea lion in Loreto, Baja California Sur, Mexico.\n\nKristin Paterakis\n\nLoreto, Mexico\n\nIn the middle of the Baja California peninsula, the town of Loreto is home to the first mission of the Californias as well as the Loreto Bay National Park, comprised of five islands that became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005. From the marinas of Loreto, you can book a dive charter out to one of those islands, Coronado, a volcanic landmass with rocky wall structures and crevices containing around eight dive sites. Coronado is home to a population of all male sea lions but it’s their pups that will swim and play around you. This island also allows the chance to see angelfish, parrotfish and pufferfish.\n\nLooking to reconnect with nature in an off-the-grid locale? From secluded islands to old-growth forests, there are isolated destinations around the world that are well worth the trek. Here are 12 of the most remote places on Earth that you can visit.\n\n1. Savusavu, Fiji\n\nDONYANEDOMAM/GETTY IMAGES\n\nPlanted on the remote southern coast of Vanua Levu is Savusavu. The island is known for its outdoor experiences, including first-rate scuba diving at Jean Michel Cousteau Resort, kayaking Salt Lake in Vatudamu, and hiking to see Maroroya Falls. Travelers can reach this verdant destination by flying one hour from Fiji’s Nadi International Airport to arrive in Labasa and driving an hour and a half to Savusavu.\n\n2. Carmen Island, Mexico\n\nCAMPPHOTO/GETTY IMAGES\n\nThe magical Loreto Bay National Park is a biodiverse UNESCO World Heritage Site comprised of five islands. One of the five, Carmen Island, is nicknamed “white gold” because of its now-defunct salt mine. Look out for barking sea lions on outcroppings near the island as you arrive by boat charter from the mainland of Loreto. Visitors to Carmen Island can hire a local adventure outfitter that will provide overnight tents along the beach. Enjoy spectacular scenery with a kayak ride around the island, stargaze without light pollution, and hike to see stunning cliffside views.\n\n3. Punta Islita, Costa Rica\n\nMARUNDE/GETTY IMAGES\n\nTucked away from the bustling towns of Costa Rica, Punta Islita is located in the province of Guanacaste and is home to one of the world’s five Blue Zones, regions where people are expected to live the longest. The destination has beautiful white-sand beaches and bays separated by volcanic rock thought to be 80 million years old. You can take nature walks with Hotel Punta Islita to see creatures like scorpions, howler monkeys, and even golden web spiders, which hold the record for creating the strongest webs. Punta Islita is a 2.5-hour drive from Liberia Airport.\n\n4. Bartang Valley, Tajikistan\n\nTRAVEL_NERD/GETTY IMAGES\n\nNestled in the Pamir Mountain Range, the Bartang Valley is replete with lush, green alluvial plains, turquoise alpine lakes, and raging rivers. Get your blood pumping with adrenaline-boosting activities in the Bartang, like road-tripping through the valley and exploring the rugged scenery in all-terrain vehicles. Getting to the valley involves flying into Dushanbe and accessing the mountains in four-wheel-drive vehicles via a side road from the Pamir Highway. Activities include overnight hiking in the Jizeu Valley and trekking to the popular Sarez Lake.\n\n5. Ko Rawi, Thailand\n\nCHRIS MOUYIARIS/ROBERTHARDING/GETTY IMAGES\n\nWith rugged old-growth jungle and only a handful of hiking trails, Ko Rawi is a remote island located in Thailand’s Tarutao National Park. It’s accessible only by boat from Ko Lipe, and there aren’t any accommodations on the island. The tropical haven is ideal for travelers looking to snorkel or swim along white-sand beaches and mangrove forests.\n\n6. Bastimentos, Panama\n\nDAMOCEAN/GETTY IMAGES\n\nAccessed only by water taxi from the larger island of Colón, Bastimentos is one of nine islands that belong to the Bocas del Toro archipelago. The action-packed island allows visitors to spot seahorses sleeping on coral while diving, see and hear monkeys and sloths feasting on leaves in the tree canopies, and kayak through the mangrove trees at Cayo Crawl, a shallow channel on the tip of the island. One of the most popular reasons for visiting is to see the inch-long, endemic red frogs found all over the island, especially in the forested areas of the Red Frog Beach Resort.\n\n7. Abia State, Nigeria\n\nThe Abia State is a bustling region in the eastern part of Nigeria and can be reached by a two-hour flight from Lagos. The local produce markets — where you can shop for goods like yams, bananas, and local greens — are among the area’s best attractions. You can also hail a keke (a Nigerian tuk tuk) to tour the Abia State and see the everyday life of the local Igbo people — keep an eye out for masquerade festivals during the holiday seasons.\n\n8. Chiloe, Chile\n\nBENJAMIN GREAVEZ/EYE EM/GETTY IMAGES\n\nChiloé, a remote Pacific island off the coast of Chile, is known for colorful, pastel palafitos (stilt houses on the water) and beautiful countryside. The island produces large amounts of wool and salmon and is regarded as the birthplace of the country’s salmon industry. Visitors can reach the island via a 30-minute ferry ride from the mainland.\n\n9. Longyearbyen, Norway\n\nSabrina Huiqun Wen/Eye Em/Getty Images.\n\nLocated in the isolated Svalbard Archipelago, the town of Longyearbyen is known as one of the most beautiful places in Scandinavia, thanks in part to the midnight sun and northern lights that illuminate night skies throughout the year. Despite its remote Arctic location, Longyearbyen has much to offer tourists, including dog sledding, snowmobiling, ice caving, and more. You can get a direct flight to this remote city from Tromsø, Norway.\n\n10. Saaremaa, Estonia\n\nFOTOMAN-KHARKOV/GETTY IMAGES\n\nThe tucked-away Baltic country of Estonia boasts the idyllic island of Saaremaa. The rural island has a bit of everything: You can explore quaint beaches, a lighthouse, and even a large medieval castle that towers over the town of Kuressaare. Visitors can book a stay at The Pilguse Manor House, which dates back to 1558 and is surrounded by gorgeous lakes and untouched nature. The easiest way to the island is a 30-minute ferry from the mainland harbor of Virtsu.\n\n11. Great North Woods, New Hampshire\n\nPICTURELAKE/GETTY IMAGES\n\nPacked with serene and rugged wilderness, New Hampshire’s Great North Woods lies just north of the White Mountains and just south of Quebec. Access the region on a road trip from Canada or southern New Hampshire. The Great North Woods is home to animals like moose, deer, bald eagles, and other rare birds. Activities include kayaking, canoeing, paddle boarding, hiking in Weeks State Park, and overnighting at cabins like the Tall Timber Lodge in Pittsburg, the northernmost town in New Hampshire.\n\n12. Deception Island, Antarctica\n\nLEAMUS/GETTY IMAGES\n\nLocated on a caldera brewing with geothermal energy, Deception Island is a remote destination absent of hotels or vehicles. Accessible via cruise ships, the island is home to black-bellied storm petrels, seals, and penguins that you can spot as you explore its black-sand beaches and hot springs.\n\nUpon leaving Tallinn airport, I breathe in so deeply I almost feel lightheaded. Armed with the knowledge that Estonia has the fourth best air quality in the world due to three-quarters of the country being covered in forests, I am eager to get some of that robust O2. I can immediately tell the difference between this fresh air and the smog-laden streets of New York.\n\nSet within the Gulf of Finland in the heart of the Baltic region, Estonia boasts 2,222 islands, 2,361 miles of coastline, and you can bathe in (and even drink from) many of its lakes. Estonia is also known for its sauna culture which dates back to the 13th century and is listed as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Getting away from the everyday stressors was the key reason I wanted to visit this tiny country and set off on a nature-based road trip.\n\nBy Clicking \"Subscribe\" you agree to have read the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy\n\nSettling in for a first night in the capital and specifically, the Old Town of Tallinn, I learn that Estonia has changed hands between Danes, Swedes, Germans, and Russians at various times in history. Walking the medieval cobblestone streets of the Old Town, I admire the fortitude of buildings that have held up over 700 years. I end up at Restaurant Lee, which has a serious romantic vibe with string lights, exotic trees, and a fairytale-like stone tower at the base. The venue specializes in local ingredients sourced from small producers and Estonian farmers. If you’re a vegan, this is a good spot to choose plates made with produce like roasted cabbage, fermented potato, and Estonian beetroot. I won’t forget the flavorful trout brought up in cold spring water.\n\nSince I came to Estonia for the adventure, my first stop is to the Rummu Underwater Prison: a must for PADI-certified divers. The last prisoner left in 2012 and the quarry where the prisoners were mining limestone is now flooded creating a marine park for divers, snorkelers, kayakers, and paddleboarders. Since you can have the most basic training to dive (Open Water Certified), I was able to explore the quarry which included an abandoned maintenance shack, two pump stations, and small underwater trees. It was a wonderfully eerie experience to see the green tint and haze underwater created by marine microorganisms. The water temperature varies from 55-68 degrees throughout the dive sites, so having a thick wetsuit and hood was necessary.\n\nIn the crazy digital world we live in, I constantly seek out nature-based accommodations to decompress and meditate. A stop at the Maidla Nature Villas was a highlight of my trip. Located only 45 minutes from Tallinn in the middle of Estonian wetlands, I checked into one of the property’s tiny Nature Villas that sit on stilts. The wetlands were an ecological wonder with trees that have died and decomposed naturally creating mystical backdrops to a yoga or fireplace session on your private deck. The wood chip path that leads to the villas, a private sauna, and exfoliating bath gel and salts made my stay attention-to-detail eco-luxurious. A local chef, Daanius Aas, prepared a five-course meal sourced from Estonian farms and in the evening the sounds of nature were abundant with small frogs hopping out of my way on the path to the villas.\n\nA drive through Estonia means you will see many fields filled with wildflowers, lots of agriculture, dotted with bucolic scenes of barns and farm animals. I experienced the smooth, well-paved roads with forested woodlands and local birds flying off on approach, gently disturbed from their hunting at the edge of the fields. Arriving at the Blue Springs of Saula, I took a short hike through the forest to land at a clearing with three springs with clear, aqua, and green colors. The springs were known to be spiritual waters for the historic inhabitants of Estonia. The Lahemaa National Park, 45 minutes from Saula, was a chance to continue communing with nature by walking the wooded paths throughout the many acres of peat moss bogs. The protected area is known to attract animals like bears, boar, lynx, and moose.\n\nI live for tiny-home stays in nature and the ÖÖD Hötels Laheranna did not disappoint. These architectural beauties were constructed with an entire house and separate private mini sauna—both encased in mirrors. The tiny homes are conveniently located in the Jõelähtme district to the east of Tallinn, which has tons of hiking trails, beaches, and the Jägala Waterfall, which you can swim in when the temperatures allow. The interiors have a plush bed, kitchenette, and a full bathroom: you can look clearly out through the walls but anyone looking at the home could not see inside, only the mirrors. There are European design books inside to complement the wifi-free zone as well as yoga mats and matches for the wood burning sauna. I chose to have dinner a few miles away at Restaurant Ruhe, a seaside spot with white and gray wicker seating featuring meat and seafood dishes prepared by chef Dmitri Fjodorov.\n\nÖÖD Hötels Laheranna.\n\nContinuing the road trip: the Lake Peipsi area of Estonia shares a border with Russia and is most famous for being the location of the “Old Believers”: a group of descendants of religious exiles who left Russia as they were facing persecution. They happen to be skilled fishermen and onion growers, creating what the locals call the “Onion Route”—similar to a wine route but for onions. I spotted dozens of bundles of yellow onions hanging on wooden stands, swinging in the slight breeze all along this route.\n\nFor example, you may stop at Talu Jalu, a small-scale family-run onion producer in the town of Kolkja, run by three generations of women.\n\nThe “Onion Route” in Estonia.\n\nWhile in Lake Peipsi, I checked into the Mesi Tare boathouses, for a very rustic experience sleeping next to a tranquil lake away from city life. The diminutive houses have a large double bed in the bow, a seating area, and a kitchenette. Plus there is outdoor seating next to the boat and a campfire site with barbecue facilities on the sandy beach. Depending on the weather, you can also swim or kayak here. One or two nights is sufficient to experience the cold shower house with water used from the lake. I woke up for an early morning bathroom break and the slight noise made a few water birds take flight with the sunrise just touching the skyline. A European storybook experience.\n\nThe Mesi Tare boathouses.\n\nLocated 20 minutes from the boathouses is the Turgi Farm where I met the husband and wife team Ergo-Hart Västrik and Veinika Västrik. Their main business is handcrafted textiles, but in the summer months you can experience an intimate four-course meal they whip up with local ingredients from their farm as well as from nearby farmers and fisherman. Some of the recent dishes included gluten-free bread with eggplant, seeds, and banana, and chickpea powder baked fish. I never felt heavy or sluggish while dining around this Baltic country. Besides, the healthy local cuisine, rustic cabins, water-based adventures, and cultural highlights unique to Estonia provided the long-overdue nature escape I was seeking.\n\nBlink and you might miss it. An island just 11.8-square miles big—smaller than the city of Providence, Rhode Island or Burlington, Vermont—St. Eustatius is a tiny Caribbean gem packed with adventure. Here you’ll find black sand beaches, snorkeling and scuba diving in the island’s 36 pristine dive sites, and sleepy volcanoes, all just a 30-minute flight from St. Maarten. And nearly half of the island is taken up by a national park.\n\nQuill/Boven National Park is split into two sides on either end of St. Eustatius, with its most notable feature being the 2,000-foot dormant volcano, the Quill. The sleeping giant is hard to miss as you start your descent by plane. Believed to be around 30,000 years old, the Quill’s last eruption took place about 1,600 years ago, and it was designated as part of the Sint Eustatius National Parks Foundation by the Dutch government in 1998. The Boven side has five hills and drier vegetation, but it’s the Quill side where most travelers spend their time.\n\nWith a lush crater that you can climb into, plus eight hiking trails, wild raspberries and orchids, a white limestone cliff overlooking the sea, and potent historical stories in the stones, St. Eustatius is a worthy stop on any Caribbean island-hopping jaunt. Here’s what to do in Quill National Park.\n\nWalter Bibikow/DigitalVision/Getty Images\n\nLearn the volcano’s history\n\nSint Eustatius, which locals call Statia, changed European hands several times from the 14th to 17th centuries, but eventually remained a Dutch territory. The colonizers first called the ancient volcano “Kuil,” meaning pit or hole, and so the English variation became the “Quill.” At one time, a majority of the volcano was used for farmland, so the long-dormant Quill was also the site of an extensive plantation.\n\nIf you look closely between the natural overgrowth of plant life, you’ll see the remnants of hundreds of rock boulders stacked in horizontal fashion, used (along with sugarcane) to keep the land from sliding as slaves worked their way up the volcano. This makes a visit to the volcano not only a reprieve into nature, but a meaningful experience with a reminder of how the past surrounds everything.\n\nFrans Lemmens/Corbis Documentary/Getty Images\n\nKeep an eye out for orchids, red bark, and iguanas\n\nThe keen observer will also notice the variety of vegetation that’s taken over the slopes. The Quill’s voluminous inner crater and surrounding land mass is home to a tropical-like rainforest replete with elephant ears, mahogany, begonias, figs, plantains, and dozens more varieties of tree and plants. You may spot the round, seedless breadfruit hanging from their parent trees; sample some of the wild raspberries throughout the forest; or see the sway of small round fruit growing on sea grape trees.\n\nThe distinct characteristics of the Gum tree will also pop out at you along the trails, because its bark peels in bright, red flakes. This tree has been used by the locals for generations, as they would boil the leaves and use it to fight gum infection. Hikers can also keep an eye out for some of the native and introduced varieties of colorful orchids, of which there are over a dozen types. And there’s a chance to see swift, 2-inch-long land crabs; iguanas; snakes; several butterfly species; as well as endemic birds like the brown striped killi killi.\n\nWestend61/Getty Images\n\nKnow when to go to Quill National Park\n\nThe trail to the crater rim can be done year round, barring any extreme weather during hurricane season (August through October). The dry season is the time of year where you have a greater chance of a more enjoyable hike. February, March and April are usually the driest months, and then the next ideal time would be December and January. It’s best to remember that because the volcano is a rainforest, the trails can become slick even in the dry seasons, since it rains frequently at the higher elevations.\n\nGolden Rock Resort, Dive & Nature Resort - St. Eustatius\n\nClimb over and into a crater\n\nThe Quill is known mostly for hiking, as it is not drive-able or developed with any man-made playthings. It’s just you and the outdoors here. Hikes vary from mild 1-hour cardio jaunts to more strenuous 2.5-hour crater treks to journeys around the volcano that can last all day. There’s a small parking lot at the base of the trail, near the intersection of Rosemary Lane, or you can walk much further by beginning your hike from the capital of Oranjestad, where the trail sign is marked.\n\nOne of the most popular trails is the 2.8-mile Quill Trail to the crater rim, which is a moderate hike with more advanced climbing when you approach the rocky top. Some ropes are there to help hikers ascend to the end of the trail. If you want to reach the highest point of The Quill, you can follow the rough track known as the Mazinga Trail, which offers breathtaking views of the surrounding islands and Caribbean waters. To check out the northern crater rim, you would turn left from the end of the Quill Trail, and follow the Panorama Point path.\n\nOne of the most thrilling hikes is into the crater itself via the Crater Trail, which has some stairs along the route to help navigate some of the steeper areas. The Crater Trail terminates in some lush vegetation. Another option for getting to the crater would be the Couchar Mountain Trail, which is actually a shorter route than the Crater Trail, but is consequently more steep.\n\nFor the most adventurous hikers, the Around the Mountain Trail does exactly as it says and circles the mountain. It’s a popular all-day hike with a visit to the summit, the crater, and views overlooking the White Wall limestone cliffs in front of the ocean. On the southeast side of the mountain, it joins with the Bird Trail and Botanical Garden Trail.\n\nNature and outdoor buffs should look no further than a trip to Central Oregon. The unique landscapes of the destination give way to a wide range of volcanic peaks, lava flows, waterfalls, and scenic rivers. The region is bordered by the Cascade Range to the west and the High Desert to the east which creates a natural abundance of hiking opportunities through its thousands of miles of trails and hundreds of trailheads.\n\nNo matter where you are—the center of Bend (a small city along the Deschutes River) or deep in the wilderness—you’re close to a trail. This accessibility is one of the area’s biggest draws. In fact, Bend-based nonprofit Oregon Adaptive Sports hosts hiking programs and events that ensure everyone can get out on the trail, in addition to providing additional equipment, instruction, and support to hikers.\n\nThere are hundreds of trails planted in several areas including the Deschutes National Forest, Cascade Lakes, the Three Sisters Wilderness, the Newberry National Volcanic Monument, River Canyon Country, and the Oregon Badlands. No matter if you crave a calorie-kicking hike with plenty of elevation or waterfall and lava flow scenes taken in from the car, there are a plethora of accessible routes in Central Oregon to explore.\n\nIf you’re looking for a scenic drive...\n\nTumalo Falls\n\nTumalo Falls in Central Oregon\n\nYou don’t even have to set out on a hike to witness some awe-inspiring landscapes. A 97-foot waterfall awaits at Tumalo Falls, located a quick drive (20 minutes) from downtown Bend. You can see the falls splashing even from the parking area. If you want to get closer, it’s about 0.25 miles of moderate incline up to the top of the falls for a bird’s eye view.\n\nOld McKenzie Highway and Dee Wright Observatory\n\nCentral Oregon is packed with volcanic landscapes. The Old McKenzie Highway—once the only connection between Central Oregon and Eugene—winds through an ancient lava flow. It’s the type of landscape that might make you wonder if you somehow landed on the moon. Note that the highway is closed during the winter and spring months (approximately November through July) due to snowfall and weather conditions. The drive is beautiful, but if you are looking for fresh air, there are a few short trails in the area. After parking (there are ADA parking spaces in the lot), head a quarter-mile down the paved trail to the Dee Wright Observatory, where you can surround yourself with views of the Cascade Range and the lava flow. Note that the roof-level of the observatory is only accessed by stairs.\n\nIf you're looking for a shorter distance...\n\nBig Obsidian Flow\n\nThe drive through the moonscape near the Lava Lands Visitor Center is like a trip to outer space. In fact, the area was once a training ground for NASA. If you’re looking for a short, accessible route, there’s a one-mile, wheelchair-friendly loop through the Big Obsidian Flow nearby. Note that it is quite a drive from the main highway, but the views are well worth the detour. Parking is free for recreation pass holders, or $5 for those who don’t have one. You can obtain a pass at the Lava Lands Visitor Center.\n\nPilot Butte\n\nGeology buffs will enjoy a stop at Pilot Butte: a 500-foot lava dome left behind by a now-extinct volcano. Considered Bend’s most recognizable landmark, hikers can also trek a popular two-mile loop that features some of Central Oregon’s best urban views and scenes of the surrounding plains. Beginning at the parking lot, the trail is paved and wheelchair-accessible, and there’s an ADA-compliant playground along the way. Parking is free.\n\nDillion Falls to Benham Falls\n\nGaining a mild 407 feet of elevation, the 6.8-mile roundtrip from Dillon Falls and Benham Falls offers a stop at a waterfall and opportunities for birdwatching and horseback riding during or after a hike. This wide, paved path is a popular route for cyclists, so keep an eye out for passersby. There are also a number of steep points along the gorges. You will need a recreation pass to park and access this area.\n\nMetolius River\n\nWith only 100 feet of elevation, the 5.7-mile family-friendly hike along the Metolius River provides spectacular views of the sapphire-colored waters of the river, Wizard Falls Hatchery, and vibrant wildflowers and fall colors. The narrow, unpaved path begins at the Canyon Creek Campground, guiding hikers along the west side of the Metolius River. At the end of the trail, Candle Creek Campground awaits. It’s free to access this trail.\n\nIf you’re looking for strenuous physical activity...\n\nPaulina Peak Trail\n\nThe Paulina Peak Trail spans 6.2 miles and features 1,610 feet of elevation gain. The route culminates 7,984 feet above sea level—the highest point of the Newberry National Volcanic Monument (you’ll remember the views for a lifetime). Just past Paulina Lake, you’ll pass an archeological site featuring a 10,500-year-old home. While many of the trail segments can be tough to navigate, the Paulina Peak Overlook is wheelchair accessible and offers a great view of East Lake, Paulina Lake, Obsidian Flow, and the Cascade Mountain Range. During the summer, there is a shuttle at the visitor’s center that will take visitors to the overlook at the summit.\n\nAnother nearby option is to ascend the 1,560-foot, 2.5-mile pancake-flat summit of Black Butte. You will be rewarded with views of Broken Top, North and South Sister, Mount Washington, and on a clear day, Mount Hood to the north. You will need a recreation pass to park and access this area.\n\nGreen Lakes Trail\n\nA 1,200-foot elevation gain with gorgeous forested vistas of pine, hemlock and Douglas fir, the Green Lakes Trail along the Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway is a nine-mile out-and-back hike where thundering waterfalls await as well as spots where you can see historic massive lava flow. The hike ends with an arrival to the Green Lakes basin and sweeping views of Broken Top and South Sister. You will need a recreation pass to park and access this area.\n\nSouth Sister\n\nFor those really looking to get out there, take on one of the region’s most iconic routes. With nearly 5,000 feet of elevation over 5.5 miles, the 12-mile advanced South Sister hike is considered a rite of passage in Central Oregon. Long and steep, the hike will require you to summit 10,358 feet above sea level, where you can finally catch your breath. Be warned: Fast-changing weather can quickly take over this trail and knowing how to use an ice pick is necessary during the colder months. The trail is not paved and often requires a bit of a scramble. You will need a recreation pass to park and access this area.\n\nExcitement runs through me as I take in the blissfully short lines gathered at St. Maarten airport with signs reading “transfer to St. Eustatius.” The line bore just a few patiently waiting locals and a handful of tourists with backpacks stuffed with long, diving fins: I knew that I was heading to a little-known mecca ripe for adventure and underwater enthusiasts. After boarding a 20-seater plane for a quick, 20-minute flight over sparkling blue waters, I landed on the tiny island (also known by locals as “Statia”). Immediately, you could see in the distance the imposing landmark of the destination: the Quill, a dormant volcano replete with healthy rainforests, hiking trails, and abundant plants and fruit that local herbalists source for their cuisine.\n\nMost people I spoke with before my trip had never heard of the off-the-map island, however the history of the destination is significant both globally and in U.S. history. After being colonized in 1493, St. Eustatius changed hands between European empires around 22 times before remaining Dutch territory. Despite being a tiny island off the tourist path, the capital of Oranjestad was actually the most important stop in the 1700s for the distribution of goods and slaves due to the fact that the port required no customs duties. This monetary boon gave the small island the nickname: “Golden Rock.” St Eustatius was also the first country to recognize the U.S. as being an independent nation during the American War of Independence in 1776 when cannons were ceremoniously fired to salute an American merchant ship visiting the island.\n\nSo, what brought me to St. Eustatius? The diving, of course. The St. Eustatius National Marine Park as well as other dive sites in the destination are arguably some of the best in the Caribbean, where you can get up close and personal with everything from colorful reefs, lava flows, boulder slides, rock outcroppings, and shipwrecks that have found their final resting place either by accident or intentional means.\n\nMy underwater exploration would be led by PADI-certified instructors at Scubaqua, a local dive shop in the Lowertown harbor area housed in the historic Dutch West India Company headquarters.\n\nAfter arriving, I wait for the other divers on the adjacent black sand beach and take in the beauty of these sparkling black minerals deposited over hundreds of years by the five volcanoes on the island. Our instructor tells us we were going to pay an underwater visit to a Taiwanese fishing vessel called the Chien Tong which sank in 2004, believed to have met its fate because of a tipsy captain. During the 80-foot-deep dive, I swam through the small, coral crusted doors of the vessel and took in a variety of marine life like Bearded Fireworms, Southern Stingrays, Bar Jacks, and Horse-eye Jacks.\n\nOur second dive of the day was to the STENAPA (St Eustatius National Marine Park) Reef which has a maximum depth of 60 feet. This man-made reef- a combination of items like a tugboat, pieces of broken shipwrecks, and long metal pipes- was created to attract marine life since local fishermen are prohibited from fishing in the southern and northern marine reserve. I enjoyed seeing the organisms that were indeed attracted to the area: a medley of barracuda, sponges, French Angelfish, and Caribbean reef sharks.\n\nOn the second day, we visited “Hangover Reef”: so called because of its abundance of coral overhangs, shelves, and tunnels that you can swim over and under. The reef appeared colorful and healthy despite some algae growth. The final dive at “Anchor Point” reef was perhaps the most interesting in terms of geology. The reef was formed from volcano flow which created a large coral overhang and crack that you can now swim through. Apparently, a French sailor many years ago sunk his anchor into the softened lava and could not retrieve it. There are other historical points of interest on the island to explore by land. For example, Fort de Windt has 18th century cannons on display in an open air museum-like setting with the island of St. Kitts visible in the distance.\n\nChecking in to luxurious accommodations is a welcome end to a day of adventure. The 40-acre Golden Rock Resort provided sweeping views of the Atlantic Ocean from my room as well as of the beautiful gardens and eye-to-detail landscaping. My first night, after having an outdoor solo yoga session on the grounds, I retreated to my room for a soak in the freestanding tub. Also, on property included a sizable swimming pool as well as an oceanfront gym where my muscles melted during a spa treatment in one of the tranquil treatment rooms. Perhaps the most standout part of the resort is the cuisine where you can order locally caught Mahi Mahi, snapper, grouper, tuna, and lobster at the on-site restaurant, Breeze. Depending on the length of your trip, you can also sample local goat during their international curry themed night.\n\nAlthough the Statia waters teeming with marine life make it a must for aquatic adventures, exploring the land gives an insightful perspective of the history and flora of the island. The dormant volcano, The Quill, offers 8 trails that weave throughout the thorny woodland and elfin forest. I recommend first timers explore with a guide. My experience hiking with a local, Celford Gibbs (who offers tours for $35-$50 depending on the size of the group) gave me a snapshot in time describing the history of slavery on the island as well as his decades of knowledge on the indigenous plant life. He uses many of these local plants and fruit for his local product Celebees company: neem oil for hair; natural soaps; as well as tamarind wine. Request the 2-hour round trip hike to Mazinga Peak: the highest point on St. Eustatius. This 360-degree view of the surrounding islands of St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat serve as inspiration for the next Caribbean adventure.\n\nIDEALLY IN ST. LUCIA, you end up on a boat. Getting around via the island’s cobalt blue water is much, much easier than navigating its volcanic, cliff-heavy terrain. It’s also preferable: If you’re lucky in your travels, you’ll float near local celebrity Blaze, one of a handful of vendors selling fruit and (heavy on the booze) frozen drinks from a frond-covered vessel. (If you see him, flag him down. You won’t regret it.)\n\nA boat is also the best way to pull up to the twin jewels of the isle: two verdant spires emerging majestically from the southwestern coast, dominating the skyline. They’re the Gros and Petit Piton, a UNESCO World Heritage site so symbolic of the country that they’re featured on the flag. They’ve also been rewarded with their very own beer.\n\nThere are multiple ways to enjoy the peaks. Perfecting both raw, biodiverse natural wonders and comfortable luxury, St Lucia appeals to adventurers and honeymooners alike. Take an aerial pic of the Pitons from a zipline or scale them on a rugged hike. Or enjoy one-of-a-kind views from two of the most unique hotel properties in the Caribbean. Both Jade Mountain and Ladera Resort feature rooms with private plunge pools and an open wall (read: missing a wall), revealing a spectacular front-seat view of the volcanic plugs. It all pairs nicely with a sunset and a Piton beer.\n\nRelax on white sand beaches, duck under waterfalls, or helmet dive along the bottom of a seahorse-filled ocean. Take in the pungent air as you slather and detoxify at the Sulfur Springs mud baths, and while you’re there, explore the Caribbean’s only drive-in volcano (it’s bubbly... and steamy). Whether you’re looking to get lost in a jungle-like paradise or indulge in some fresh lobster with a side of jerk chicken, here’s everything you need to do on your next visit to St. Lucia.\n\nTrails of varying difficulty bring you to the Pitons’ volcanic peaks. | BlueOrange Studio/Shutterstock\n\nHike volcanoes for incredible sweeping views\n\nThe Pitons aren’t the tallest mountains on the island—that would be Mount Gimie, at around 3,117 feet up. A trek takes you through terrain you have to machete, but the payoff is 360 degree views out to the Maria Islands.\n\nPlus, views of the Pitons, which admittedly are more difficult to see when you’re actually on them. But you’re definitely gonna want to get on them. The taller Gros Piton is your best bet, with a wide berth up to 2,619 feet and several marked trails of varying difficulty. Reaching the summit could take you three hours or six, depending on your skill level and selfie-snapping habits.\n\nOnly a few minutes from the town of Soufrière (French for “sulfur”), you can conquer an easy, 45-minute hike to the top of the Tet Paul. There you’ll again find panoramic views of the Pitons and the nearby islands of St. Vincent and Martinique. Pack a lunch for an excuse to use the cute picnic tables at the top while listening to the birdsongs of endemic parrots and warblers.\n\nDetoxify yourself at the mud baths. | fokke baarssen/Shutterstock\n\nHeal yourself with mud and waterfalls\n\nYou’ll smell Sulfur Springs before you see them. Located at the Soufrière Volcano on southwestern side of the island, here you can slather your body in the mineral-rich white and black mud believed to have healing properties for sun burns, eczema, arthritis, and sore joints. Afterwards, soak in the 110-degree spring to work out any residual achiness.\n\nThe volcanic geography of the island also gives way to the Toraille Waterfalls, located near Fond St. Jacques village. Dip into the plunge pool or indulge in an aquatic back massage at the base of the 50-foot waterfall that pours over the side of the cliff and terminates near a scenic garden.\n\nSnorkle, kayak, dive... or just float. | Afton Almaraz/Stone/Getty Images\n\nWalk underwater (or kayak, snorkel, or dive)\n\nBest thing about a kayak tour in St. Lucia? You could either get your heartrate up for a workout or just listlessly float in the soothing water—the choice is yours. The Roseau River is located in the Anse-La-Raye region, and flows into the southern part of the island. Starting at Marigot Bay, take in the scenery that served as the backdrop for the 1967 film Dr. Doolittle, then spend the rest of the day paddling through lagoons, Banyan tree canopies, and mangroves.\n\nThen duck—by way of diving and snorkeling at the base of the Pitons. The area is rife with eye-popping tropical fish, eels, sea turtles, and colorful coral landscapes. Don’t forget to visit the Anse Cochon beach, the launch spot for exploring two of the island’s shipwrecks. You could drift around the Lesleen M, a cargo ship sunk in 1986 to form an artificial reef, and the Danini Koyomaru, a 244-foot Japanese dredger transformed into an artificial reef in 1996.\n\nIf you aren’t a certified diver but want to experience something a bit more thrilling than snorkeling, consider helmet diving, where you’ll be connected to an oxygen source on a boat while you stretch your legs on the seafloor. Try it out at Pigeon Island, designated a National Park in 1979 and a National Landmark in 1992. You’ll find marine life like seahorses, squid, and—if you have time to explore Pigeon Island’s land mass—you’ll also come across an 18th century British fort as well as Fort Rodney, used by the British to spy on the French during colonization.\n\nRELATED\n\nThe Best Caribbean Destinations for an Easy Beach Getaway\n\nWell, relatively easy anyway.\n\nLoaves of hot and steamy Creole bread. | Megan M. Weber/Shutterstock\n\nFill up on hot bread, spicy seafood, and a barbecue fête\n\nOn the western coast of St. Lucia, the fishing village of Anse La Raye is home to Rhumba Daiquiri Bar & Grill, where you’ll find specialties like freshly caught lobster, barbecue ribs, jerk chicken and pork, and a standout catch-of-the-day. For dining with a view, the Treehouse restaurant in Anse Chastanet overlooks the Piton mountains. Try some of their locally caught Mahi Mahi, as well as vegetables sourced from the property’s farm in the Soufrière hills.\n\nPerhaps the best deals around the island can be found at family-run bakeries, where you can pick up baguette-shaped Creole bread for $1, made with baking powder instead of yeast, slathered with margarine, and stuffed with everything from cheese to caramelized onions to saltfish. If you find yourself in the hamlet of Norbert in Gros Islet on the northern side of the island, look for a local elder named Magdalene, who bakes her hot treats in an oil drum. Ask around, and you just might find the best steaming buns on the island.\n\nAnd as long as you're in Gros Islet, stick around for the Friday night \"jump-up,\" a weekly street party that's been taking over the friendly fishing town for over half a century. You'll find craft vendors, booming calypso reggae, and table-top setups serving up hot local pork, chicken, and barbecued seafood (try the conch or spiny lobster). Pair it all with rum punch or an ice-cold beer (Piton, of course).\n\nCacao on the Fond Doux Eco Resort. | Frederic J. Brown/ AFP/Getty Images\n\nThen finish off your meal with some chocolate\n\nSt. Lucia was once home to a thriving cacao industry. Thanks to their lush tropical rainforest, warm climate, and rich volcanic soil, they’ve been producing the prized fruit for centuries, and once exported their beans to Europe to be used as ingredients for the finest chocolate bars in the world. Over the past few years, St. Lucia’s cacao business has gone through something of a sweet revival. Chocolate tourism has exploded on the island, and they even celebrate Chocolate Heritage Month each August.\n\nWhile exploring, try cocoa tea, an invention of formerly enslaved St. Lucians that combine the British pastime with ingredients available on the island. Take a plantation tour at the Morne Coubaril Estate, La Dauphine Estate, or the Fond Doux Eco Resort. Come nightfall, book a stay at the Rabot Hotel from Hotel Chocolat, where you can tour cacao groves, taste all manner of chocolate dishes in the restaurant, or opt for a chocolate-infused spa treatment. Elsewhere, you can participate in a traditional “cocoa- rina” dance to polish the cocoa beans (it’s quite the ab workout), visit a fermentation house, or do the whole shebang—Jade Mountain’s Emerald Estate Organic Chocolate and Chocolate Laboratory provides the full beans-to-bar experience, including sampling the wares.\n\nEnjoy volcanic vistas right from the pool. | ANSE CHASTANET ST.LUCIA\n\nSleep among nature in a jungle treehouse\n\nAnd it’s not just a chocolate hotel. The hoisted-up wooden rooms at Rabot Hotel make you feel like you're sleeping in a treehouse, complete with some of the best views on the island courtesy of balconies looking right at the Petit Piton volcano. And you’re only a couple minutes away from beaches, waterfalls, and hot springs.\n\nThe Fond Doux Eco Resort is on a historic 19th-century working cocoa estate, with cottages so immersed in the rainforest you lean off the balcony (or your outdoor shower) and pick fruit off the trees.\n\nCamping isn’t just for the adventurous among us. Those who prefer the indoors, or simply an actual bed, can learn to love it, too—as long as they bring the right gear.\n\n“Accidents, issues, or annoyances on a camping trip usually occur or escalate because of the decisions you made at home,” said Marty Parichand, founder of Outdoor New England, a gear shop based in Franklin, NH. “Be sure to enjoy your downtime by packing gear like a water bottle, hiking boots, and bug spray. Missing any of these could result in a good day turned bad.”\n\nBelow, we’ve rounded up our favorite things to bring camping to ensure an enjoyable night in the great outdoors, even if you’d rather be staying in a hotel.\n\nSpark Ultralight Sleeping Bag\n\nStarting at $269\n\nStaying warm while sleeping is essential to any successful camping trip. To ensure comfort, invest in Sea to Summit’s mummy-style Spark Ultralight Sleeping Bag, which is engineered to keep you warm at the lightest weight and smallest compressed size. Ultra-light doesn’t mean small, however—the bag is snug but still has plenty of wiggle room for active sleepers. It’s also made with ULTRA-Dry Down 850+ to protect from external moisture and internal condensation, making it suitable for all sorts of weather.\n\nDon’t Bug Me! Bundle\n\nImage: Courtesy of Chagrin Valley Soap & Salve Co.\n\nDon’t Bug Me! Bundle\n\nStarting at $24\n\nIf not you, there’s guaranteed to be someone in your group who’s a magnet for mosquitos. Instead of hiding in your tent all night, come equipped with Chagrin Valley Soap & Salve Company’s all-natural bug repellent, which uses essential oils rather than harsh chemicals to keep bugs away. The “Don’t Bug Me! Bundle” includes a non-oily body spray, a lotion bar, and a soap so you’ll have several ways to keep your skin safe—and you’ll smell great, too.\n\nBiolite Headlamp 200\n\nStarting at $40\n\nWeighing only 50 grams, the Biolite Headlamp 200 offers a comfortable, easy way to see in the dark when you’re camping. You can even tilt down the front panel with a single hand to light the trail from your tent to the bathrooms in the middle of the night. Chargeable via micro USB, the light lasts up to 40 hours on low and three hours on high so you can count on it to last until sunrise, no batteries required.\n\nElsabet Throw\n\nStarting at $30\n\nCooler nighttime temps don’t have to deter you from stargazing, especially if you pack Ikea’s Elsabet Throw for cozying up around the campfire. Handmade by skilled craftspeople at the social enterprise Rangsutra in India, each throw is unique but equally comfy. The classic checks and fringes remind us of traditional picnic blankets, and the soft, sustainable cotton fabric means you can toss it in the washing machine if it gets dirty while camping.\n\nStarting $165\n\nEvery successful camping trip requires a reliable pair of hiking boots to get you to your site and back. Salomon’s popular X Ultra 3 Wide Mid Gore-Tex version offers the lightweight construction and foothold you need for safe ascents and descents, all with a wider fit for extra comfort. Plus the Gore-Tex material will ensure your feet stay dry no matter what kind of weather or water features you encounter on the trail. Find the women’s version here.\n\nStarting at $35\n\nYou can plan all the fun activities you want while camping, but if you don’t stay hydrated, you won’t enjoy any of them. The Ashbury bottle from Avana makes it easy to always have cool water on hand, thanks to its triple-layer insulation and flexible carry loop. It also features a wide-mouth spout for swigging and a built-in straw for sipping, and comes in a variety of colors and sizes. Best of all, every purchase helps provide water to communities in need.\n\nTwo-Person Dome Tent\n\nStarting at $24\n\nFor high-quality but low-cost shelter, turn to the two-person dome tent from Wakeman Outdoors. Lightweight and compact, it still has plenty of space for you and a camping partner thanks to its spacious interior with high center support. Other features include a dual-layer door for superior air flow, a removable rain fly, and an interior pocket to keep everything organized. With just two fiberglass poles, set-up and tear-down is quick and easy, and when you’re ready to head home, you can throw the tent components in the included carry bag for simple transport.\n\nAdventure Chef 6-Piece Summit Set\n\nStarting at $250\n\nThis cutlery set might be expensive, but it’s worth the price to guarantee good campsite cooking. With everything from chef’s and filet knives to a peeler and parer with a fish scaler, you’ll have the tools you need to whip up fresh, delicious meals no matter where you’re camping. Made from the same chef-grade materials as Messermeister’s regular kitchenware, each piece is full size but folds for portability and has an ergonomic handle for easy use outdoors. The set even comes with a waxed canvas case for simple packing.\n\nA hike through one of the country’s national parks can mean great exercise, sweeping views, and thrilling wildlife sightings—except for when the trail is packed with other people. Thankfully, most parks have several under-the-radar hikes that are just enjoyable, but with way less crowds. Whether you’re hoping to see rushing waterfalls, volcanic craters, or sandstone spires, take the path less traveled next time you’re hiking in a U.S. national park and you’re guaranteed a memorable experience.\n\nBlue Hen Falls along the Buckeye Trail in Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Ohio\n\nImage: Jophoto/Tripadvisor\n\nCuyahoga Valley National Park, Ohio\n\nPopular hike: Brandywine Falls Trail\n\nLess-crowded alternative: Buckeye Trail\n\nLocated on the Cuyahoga River between Cleveland and Akron, Cuyahoga Valley National Park may not have much name recognition, but it still garners millions of visitors each year. While the hike to Brandywine Falls can get crowded, the Buckeye Trail to Blue Hen Falls remains mostly clear no matter the time of day or year and offers the chance to spot chipmunk, deer, and even the elusive coyote. On your way up, you’ll pass wildflower fields and scenic ledges before reaching the Blue Hen Falls overlook, where you can watch a 15-foot cascade flow over shale and sandstone, surrounded by towering trees. The hike is three miles roundtrip from the Boston Mill Visitor Center and includes a 580-foot change in elevation.\n\nView from Riprap Trail in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nShenandoah National Park, Virginia\n\nPopular hike: Dark Hollow Falls Trail\n\nLess-crowded alternative: Riprap Trail\n\nThe popular, family-friendly Dark Hollow Falls Trail may lead to a 70-foot cascade and shallow pool, but the Riprap Trail has a spring-fed stream and 50-foot-wide swimming hole—plus half the people. It’s located in the less-trafficked South District of Shenandoah National Park and even includes a small section of the famed Appalachian Trail. The entire hike is a challenging, 9.3-mile loop, but you can always hike from the Riprap parking area to the scenic overlook at Chimney Rock and back if you don’t have 4.5-ish hours of hiking in you.\n\nPopular hike: Garfield Peak Trail\n\nLess-crowded alternative: Wizard Island Summit Trail\n\nThe Wizard Island Summit Trail requires more effort to access than most other hikes in Crater Lake National Park, including the favorite Garfield Peak Trail, but that’s likely why you can still find some solitude here. To get to the 2.3-mile, out-and-back trail, which is located on Wizard Island in the center of Crater Lake’s deep-blue water, you first have to hike the Cleetwood Cove Trail and then take a boat ride out to the island. Once at the summit, however, you’ll get to circle the crater of the cinder cone that formed Wizard Island and enjoy panoramic views over the lake. You can even climb down into the crater, called the Witches’ Cauldron, which is a popular activity for birders. Visit either in the early morning or late afternoon to ensure your peace and quiet.\n\nMoose in lake at Glacier National Park, Montana\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nGlacier National Park, Montana\n\nPopular hike: Avalanche Lake Trail\n\nLess-crowded alternative: Logging Lake Trail\n\nWhile the Avalanche Lake and Logging Lake trails both lead to breathtaking bodies of water, the latter is one of the least busy hikes in Glacier National Park owing to its longer length (about 11.4 miles to the foot of the lake) and remote location (the west side of the park). It may take a while to reach Logging Lake, but it’s a relatively easy climb with only 477 vertical feet of elevation gain. Along the way, you’ll pass by old-growth conifer forests, a historic patrol cabin, and a couple of campgrounds, and once at the lake, you’ll have spectacular views of the Livingston Range, including Mount Gedhun and Anaconda Peak.\n\nDruid Arch at Canyonlands National Park, Utah\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nCanyonlands National Park, Utah\n\nPopular hike: Mesa Arch Trail\n\nLess-crowded alternative: Druid Arch Trail\n\nEven though Canyonlands National Park draws fewer crowds than Utah favorites like Zion and Arches, its iconic Mesa Arch Trail can still feel packed at times. Instead, make the 10.4-mile, out-and-back hike to Druid Arch, located in the remote Needles District of the park. The trail starts at Elephant Hill and runs through scenic Elephant Canyon, passing by the district’s namesake spires. The last quarter mile of the path is pretty challenging (you’ll have to scale a ladder and then scramble up a steep ravine), but it leads to a sandstone bench with awe-inspiring views of Druid Arch, known for its angular profile that wouldn’t feel out of place in Stonehenge.\n\nBogachiel River, Olympic National Park, Washington\n\nImage: Management/Tripadvisor\n\nOlympic National Park, Washington\n\nPopular hike: Hoh River Trail\n\nLess-crowded alternative: Bogachiel River Trail\n\nOlympic National Park’s Bogachiel River Trail is a less-congested alternative to the Hoh River Trail farther south. Both paths go through one of the few examples of temperate rain forest in the United States, but with fewer people on the Bogachiel River Trail, you’ll actually be able to stop and appreciate the hanging moss, ferns, and wetlands along the way. The entire Bogachiel trail, which leads all the way to Seven Lakes Basin and up Bogachiel Peak, is almost 30 miles long, though you can access two shorter sections just outside the park boundary. The one-mile Homestead Loop Trail will take you past the 1890 Morgenroth homestead (the former home of pioneer Chris Morgenroth), while the three-mile Ira Spring Wetland Trail provides access to a moss-covered forest overlooking an active wetlands biome.\n\nRare blue iguanas, underwater bronze mermaids, and hundreds of dive sites: This Caribbean island has a lot more to offer than tax breaks.\n\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\n\nGrand Cayman is the largest of the three Caribbean islands that make up the Caymans. (Cayman Brac and Little Cayman are the other two.) Its most famous draw is the alluringly named Seven Mile Beach, a stretch of white sand to rival any in the Caribbean, but the island has a lot more to offer visitors, both on land and in the sea. From spotting blue iguanas to kayaking in a bioluminescent bay to diving through intricate shipwrecks, here is a guide to making the most out of a first-time visit to Grand Cayman.\n\n1. Get certified to scuba dive\n\nADVERTISING\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Cayman Islands are a premier diving destination, boasting 365 dive sites, as well as the International Scuba Diving Hall of Fame, and plenty of places to snorkel. Sign up for a tour or a PADI Open Water Certification course at Sunset Divers, a hotel that describes itself as “for divers, by divers.” The certification (which is good for your whole life) permits dives to a maximum depth of 40 feet. Try it out on an excursion along the north wall of the island, replete with sponges, sea fans, and gorgonians, plus large marine life, such as rays and sharks that come from deeper waters. Grand Cayman also has two underwater bronze mermaids for divers to meet, designed by artist Simon Morris to promote environmental awareness. And don’t miss a visit to the decommissioned submarine rescue ship Kittiwake, which was sunk as an artificial reef in 2011. Located only 800 yards from Grand Cayman’s Seven Mile Beach, you can swim by five decks, the captain's wheel, and the ship’s recompression chamber.\n\n2. Meet the iguanas that exist only on this island\n\nThere’s fascinating flora and fauna above the waterline, too. In fact, the island is full of species that can’t be found anywhere else, like the endangered Cayman blue iguana. Thanks to a conservation program started in 1990, about a 100 of these colorful reptiles now live at the Blue Iguana Conservation Facility, part of the island’s Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park. After visiting them, stroll the 65-acre green space to see an orchid garden that features four blooms endemic to Grand Cayman and a butterfly garden with five species that also are only found here.\n\n3. Paddle in a bioluminescent bay\n\nKick off one of your evenings with a kayaking trip in the Bioluminescent Bay as night falls. On the Cayman Kayaks Bioluminescent Tour, you can choose to explore the glowing body of water by gliding along in a kayak or in an electric-powered catamaran. Dip your hand in the water and you’ll see the organisms create a blue aura around your fingers. If more physical activity is your cup of tea, Vitamin Sea Cayman offers ways to break a sweat while still having fun, with classes that include paddleboard yoga, stand-up paddleboarding, and kitesurfing.\n\nPhoto by Michelle de Villiers/Shutterstock\n\nSnorkeling with stingrays is less daunting than it might sound.\n\n4. Snorkel with stingrays\n\nOne of the highlights of a trip to Grand Cayman is Stingray City, a wide sandbar surrounded by barrier reefs; it’s home to more than a dozen southern stingrays that inhabit the shallow waters. The animals are accustomed to people and so gentle that you can hold them (this is allowed) or, according to the locals, give them a kiss for seven years of good luck. Many companies offer tours here, so you’ll have a lot of options. Red Sail Sports offers both a breakfast trip and a sunset excursion on its 65-foot catamaran, giving guests ample space to eat and relax during the tour.\n\n5. Visit the other Caymans\n\nBoth Cayman Brac and Little Cayman are a quick 30-minute flight from Grand Cayman and offer their own advenures. Little Cayman, the smallest of the trio, is a diver’s paradise. Visitors come to explore its Bloody Bay Wall Marine Park and its sprawling Booby Pond Nature Reserve, home to red-footed boobies and frigate birds. Offshore, the even tinier uninhabited Owen Island is a secluded picnic spot accessible only by kayak or sailboat. Cayman Brac is also a big draw for divers, and it’s the site of the oldest museum in the Cayman Islands, where some artifacts on display date back thousands of years.\n\nOnce your flight descends over the Turks & Caicos islands, the first thing you’ll notice is the brilliant, blue Gatorade-colored water that encircles the land masses. There’s no seawater quite like Turks water. Most of the islands are framed by white limestone, there’s no murky runoff from volcanoes, mountains, or rivers, so the oceans keep their brilliant blues. That's also partly why you'll find the world’s third largest barrier reef here.\n\nThe intricate and colorful underwater landscape makes for awe-inspiring snorkeling and diving opportunities. Out of the nine inhabited islands of the Turks & Caicos, Middle Caicos is the one to visit if you’re looking to experience the least developed and least inhabited island. If you’ve ever wanted to have an entire beach to yourself, where your sandy footprints are the only ones as far as the eye can see, Middle Caicos is your place. Both idyllic and sleepy, pay a visit to some of the island’s hidden beaches and mangrove wetlands.\n\nOn the main island, Providenciales (Provo), you’ll find the most developments, high end shopping, and luxury properties. Despite the modernity, getting into the local way of life is still quite easy, where you can have a freshly cracked conch at a small shack, explore the pristine reefs by snorkel or dive, and strike up a conversation with locals while boating or kayaking.\n\nThe Turks & Caicos islands are for those looking to enjoy the fine white sand and take part in water adventures in a barely-touched Caribbean world. Here’s what to do while you're there.\n\nOcean waves are calling. | Matt Anderson Photography/Moment/Getty images\n\nExplore ocean-lined cliffs or tranquil beaches\n\nEasing into the slow pace of Middle Caicos, seek out the island’s abundant nature offerings with stunning rocky cliffs jutting out over white sand beaches. Not to mention, you can explore natural limestone tunnel formations, quiet coves, and outcroppings along the scenic Mudjin Harbor. Thrill seekers can stand out over these cliffs and watch the waves crash and shoot up dozens of feet in the air.\n\nThe island has over 2,200 feet white-sand beaches. For a gorgeous swimming and kayaking option, visit Middle Caicos’ Bambarra Beach, which sits along land that was a historic plantation from the 1700’s. If your visit to these sands is in the middle of the day in the middle of the week, don’t be surprised if it’s just you and maybe a fisherman or local catching some zzz’s.\n\nThe bats don't need a headlight to see you. | Matt Anderson Photography/Moment Open/Getty images\n\nHike above and below ground\n\nInto hiking? Venture along the Crossing Place Trail, a historical route full of rocks, sand, and paved areas that used to be the primary link for locals traveling to and from North and Middle Caicos islands (now connected by a bridge). Some of the sights to take in along the way include Juniper Hole, a craggy sea cave, and Blowing Hole, a 75-foot-long underwater cave.\n\nTaking things underground, venture to the Conch Bar Caves for a fascinating experience through an array of thousands year old stalactites, stalagmites, and columns, along with pools of water that flow in and out of the acidic limestone environment. You can picture settlers mining for bat guano, which was used for fertilizer in the 1880’s, as you hike through the cave. Keep an eye out for sleeping bats that like to literally hang-out on the overhead portions of the cave.\n\nThe fish are almost as big as you. | Stephen Frink/The Image Bank/Getty images\n\nExplore Provo’s marine life\n\nCatching the ferry to the island of Provo (where the international airport is located) to the island of Provo from the TCI dock in North Caicos is an experience in itself. Strike up a conversation with a commuting local while sitting on the top portion of the ferry: the place to get light splashes of cool ocean water while taking in sweeping views of passing islands on the 25-minute ride.\n\nBudget snorkeling is possible on Provo: take your own equipment and explore right from shore at Smith’s Reef to spot angelfish and butterfly fish, among dozens of other species. If you prefer a boat snorkeling excursion, you can join a group with Dive Provo, which spends a couple hours touring spots off of Grace Bay, including sites known for harmless nurse shark visits.\n\nAnother way to become acquainted with the clear Turks’ water is by getting a scuba diving certification via the Professional Association of Dive Instructors (PADI) through a reputable dive shop, which Dive Provo also offers. Depending on the conditions in the morning, the instructors will take you to the best dive site around the islands. For example, if you make a stop at the West Caicos “Piranha Cove” dive site, expect to descend to 40 feet max and come face to face with amazing marine life like slow-moving conch, fast-moving hawksbill turtles, elusive moray eels, and schools of Creole wrasse. You may have the opportunity to explore the “Crocodile” dive site, where frequent visitors include grouper, parrotfish, and reef sharks.\n\nYou could almost reach out and catch lunch yourself. | da Conch Shack\n\nEat from the abundant sea\n\nOn Middle Caicos, visit Seaview Café, located along the Crossing Place trail. Here you’ll find perfectly seasoned, minced curry lobster or baked salmon complete with garlicky potatoes, all of which you can enjoy on cozy outdoor picnic tables.\n\nOn Provo, go for an upscale dinner at the white tablecloth restaurant, Seven. The white tablecloth restaurant is known for their conch chowder prepared with garlic, onions, tomatoes, celery, carrots, and potatoes sautéed together.\n\nFor a local vibe, grab freshly caught seafood like lime-seasoned conch salad, buttery lobster and flaky conch fritters at da Conch Shack. While here, you can watch fisherman cleaning brilliant conch shells on the beach.\n\nSome pretty exclusive access. | Dragon Cay Resort\n\nWhere to Stay in Turks & Caicos\n\nIn Provo, book accommodations at the West Bay Club, which sits on Grace Bay Beach, one of the best beaches in the entire Caribbean. Depending on your accommodation, you can opt for a suite with a kitchenette or full kitchen, and the property gives you access to complimentary watersports with free kayaks and standup paddleboards. Ask for snorkeling equipment to check out some of the stunning coral along--remember--the world’s third largest barrier reef.\n\nFor a romantic stay, spend a few days on the private island of Pine Cay, located a short boat trip east of Provo. The island has the softest sand you’ll ever experience and luxury, beachfront cottages with king size beds, private hammocks, and your own golf cart to explore the island.\n\nIf you like hearing the sounds of breaking waves and tree frogs humming you to sleep at night, book a cottage or villa at the Dragon Cay Resort, on Middle Caicos. Equipped with kitchenettes and living rooms, the accommodations are perfect for small groups and families traveling on a budget. You can also request complimentary paddleboards, kayaks, and bicycles to use during your stay.\n\nhey say the Caribbean islands offer something for every type of sun baby, but for the outdoor adventure lovers, the 21-mile-long island of Aruba tops the chart. Being an avid scuba diver, I’ve experienced the intricate depths of the Tulum caverns in the Mexican Caribbean to the heart racing blue holes of the Bahamas. However, it wasn’t until I descended into the depths of Aruba’s clear waters that I realized something new and exciting was about to happen.\n\nThe YS-11 and Convair 240 are two airplane wrecks that were sunk for recreational purposes a short boat ride away from Aruba’s Renaissance Island. After being mildly interrogated by family and friends over the course of the pandemic for taking flights, it was refreshing to be absorbed into an underwater world where there were no COVID-19 risks, no judgements, only the exploration of these mask-free planes.\n\nStarting with the Convair 240, an airplane that was said to have been confiscated during a drug-bust in the late 1980s, it was later sunk by the government to form an artificial reef. A hurricane in the 1990s split the fuselage into two big pieces, but the amazing part of the dive is that the split allows you to penetrate the plane and explore the interior of the fuselage. My underwater photographer buddy captured a few pictures of me waving from the cockpit.\n\nA short swim away, I arrive at the second plane, the YS-11: an old Air Aruba passenger plane that sits at around 45 feet deep and is missing its nose cone. Of course, I had to take the opportunity to dive through the fuselage and revel in the colorful, coral crusted surroundings. If you’re a diver, you won’t want to miss the opportunity to see these impressive artificial reefs teeming with marine life like moray eels, pufferfish, lobster, crab, and the occasional shy nurse shark. I recommend starting a trip off in Aruba with becoming a PADI-certified open water diver at a local PADI dive shop. This new certification allows you to dive to depths of up to 40 feet and you can use the certification to dive for a lifetime.\n\nIf I could stay underwater and dive for days (and nights) on end I would, but thankfully Aruba has tons of other water adventure offerings to bring me back to my gill-less reality. Being a part-time pescatarian (I give it a good try), seafood is at the top of my menu. There’s nothing like being able to eat what you catch. Driftwood restaurant, located on the west side of the island in the capital city of Oranjestad, will grill up any of your catches for dinner. For deep-sea fishing on island, some of the possibilities during your half or full day excursion include catches of blue and white marlin, dorado, wahoo, shark, barracuda, kingfish, and blackfin and yellowfin tuna. After a four-hour excursion, my family and I were able to pull up a dozen red snapper, grouper, bonita, and I even caught (and released) a baby shark. Our puffed-out chests at our bounty made up for a few embarrassing bouts of sea sickness during the rolling journey.\n\nSometimes it’s nice to create peaceful, solo moments on the water, especially if you catch a mild day in Aruba where there are few ripples on the surf. I took advantage of those days with paddle boarding through the Spanish lagoons: the mangrove lagoons that sit along Aruba's southern fringe. There’s nothing quite like drifting along serenely while listening to the calls of the birds that rely on the ecosystem of the intricate mangroves. Also, the shadows of the mangrove leaves and branches that play along my body create an ethereal existence. You can also choose to take an organized tour by paddleboard or kayak, which usually leave from the neighborhood of Savaneta, and traverse through places like Mangel Halto and finally, the Spanish Lagoon.\n\nYou can’t leave Aruba without spending at least one day at Arikok National Park. This government-protected park comprises almost 20 percent of the island’s landmass and is a conglomerate of cactus-laden, beautifully dusty and dry desert terrain. It was an intense journey exploring the vastness of this rugged park by Jeep Safari, most of the trip spent climbing and descending at fast and sudden rates. Around us, there were fellow adventurers exploring the land by ATV, UTV, and horseback. Some of the wildlife that you have a chance of spotting (or accidently happening upon) in the park include Aruba rattlesnakes, burrowing owls, and blue whiptail lizards. In the northern part of the park, there are a few hidden beaches and coral limestone bridges and caves that you can safely explore.\n\nFor the more mellow travelers that like a little culture with their adventure, a walking or bike tour of San Nicholas is a must. This southernmost neighborhood of Aruba is also known as Chocolate City for the large population of Afro-immigrants that worked in the now closed oil refinery. Being located an hour south of the commercial touristy areas of Palm Beach and the capital Oranjestad, San Nicholas has emerged as being one of the largest Caribbean enclaves with sweeping murals that blanket its downtown area. One of the busiest seasons for San Nicolas are the three days every November during the Aruba Art Fair which brings together Aruban and international artists, music and dance performances, on-site sculpture making and culinary competitions.\n\nSan Nicolas also happens to be the under-the-radar location of Aruba’s best beaches, including Baby Beach and Boca Grandi. I had lunch with Tito Bolivar, founder of the Aruba Art Fair and resident of San Nicholas who took me to his favorite local restaurant (which I 100 percent recommend), Kamini’s Kitchen, where you can eat authentic Trinidadian food. Choose from dishes like curry chicken, lamb chops with mushroom curry, and grilled red snapper. Don’t dress up, this is a casual spot that you can just pull up to after a day at the beach or road tripping around the island. If you seek adventure and you seek to meet friendly people that will put you on to the best local food spots and hidden beaches, stay for a while in Aruba. The surprises don’t stop.\n\nI’ve run half marathons in Philadelphia and Washington DC; hiked the sweeping landscapes of Patagonia, Chile; road biked through the countryside of Myanmar; cruised through the Arctic Circle in Norway. But no experience has touched me quite like dipping into the deep blue—seeing the oddly colored shrimp underwater in Fujairah; the overwhelming abundance of fan corals that blanket Tela, Honduras; diving the UAE and through the cenotes of Tulum were some of my most impactful dives. As a black diver, it is my mission to encourage and inspire people of color to suit up, to explore the world’s diverse underwater gems and witness human’s impact on them, from coral bleaching to plastic pollution.\n\nI am the only black female diver on most of my recreational dives. As a people person, that doesn’t make me feel uncomfortable — divers are all there to support each other and have fun other under the sea and topside — but it would be encouraging to see more people of color experience the wonder of diving. Nothing compares to seeing the silhouette of a nurse shark looking for its next prey, the slow movements of rugged sea cucumbers on the ocean floor, the changing colors of a fast-moving octopus underwater. Based on my diving experiences, the following destinations and organizations support diverse dive communities.\n\nGetaway of Choice: The Caribbean\n\nBeing a black diver isn’t as notable in the Caribbean, where I have travelled extensively, as local PADI-certified dive instructors of African origin are widespread. “We can increase diversity by empowering divers and also supporting each other through constant conversations,” says Elijah Jean-Baptiste, a PADI dive instructor based in St. Lucia. “We should cultivate awareness, ensure there is equality and be inclusive.”\n\nMost of the instructors are black when I have stayed at Caribbean Sandals Resorts, including Bimini, St. Lucia, Grenada and Jamaica, where diving is included in your nightly rate.\n\n“At Sandals Resorts, our most predominant client profile has been women ages 35 to 55 and over who are the decision-makers and influencers in their households,” says Michael Clarke, Sandals Resorts International’s Group Watersports Director. “With this in mind, we began supporting PADI’s Annual Women’s Dive Day in collaboration with our Sandals Foundation, which has helped bring awareness to the destination’s marine life and controlled current invasive species, and we work closely with the local Ministry of Environment on over-fishing, coral reef restoration and more.”\n\nGreat Groups\n\nStateside, one way to delve deeply into the powerful stories of African Americans is uncovering the history of the transatlantic slave trade with Diving With A Purpose (DWP), an organization that documents the submerged heritage of slave ship wrecks.\n\nJordan prepares for a dive.\n\nNico Marin\n\n“The first time I dived a slave ship was the Henrietta Marie that ran aground off the coast of Florida in 1700,” says Ken Stewart, co-founder of DWP and Scuba Diving’s 2018 Sea Hero of the Year. “I was overwhelmed with emotion: my vivid imagination allowed me to feel the souls of the Africans that were on board on its journey to the Americas. Prior to 2003, I really had no clue about archaeology, anthropology and was not well versed in the slave trade. Like most Americans-and particularly African Americans-we don't learn it in school and unless you have a strong historical connection, it's not taught in the home.”\n\nOne of the most prominent and probable to find slave shipwrecks that they have been searching for during the last 16 years is the Guerrero, a Spanish slave ship that sunk in Florida’s Biscayne National Park in 1827. Through Stewart’s youth division of DWP, Youth Diving With A Purpose, young adults between the ages of 16 through 23 have been able to get involved in the search for the Guerrero.\n\nThe Slave Wrecks Project (SWP), run by the Smithsonian in partnership with DWP, focuses on wreck sites in North America, Mozambique, Senegal, St. Croix, among other global locations. In 2014 it recovered the wreck of the slave ship São José and participated the 2019 location of Clotilda, known as America’s last slave ship, in Alabama’s Mobile Bay. Visitors to the National Museum of African American History and Culture can see a permanent exhibit of the SWP with visual imagery and their projects depicted.\n\nWANT MORE OF THIS?\n\nSign up for Scuba Diving’s weekly email and never miss another story.\n\nBy submitting above, you agree to\n\nScuba Diving's privacy policy.\n\nBlack divers looking to connect with others can join the National Association of Black Scuba Divers, which seeks to “unite black scuba divers through education, dive safety, and scuba diving trips.” There are more than 3,000 members spread throughout chapters in many major cities, including one in my area of New York City called the Aquatic Voyagers Scuba Club.\n\nAnother group to have on your radar is Diversity in Aquatics. Its Scuba Council, chaired by Scuba Diving 2021 Sea Hero of the Year Anesti Vega, is currently accepting applications from divers of color for its scuba certification scholarship. The first class of recipients will be announced in February 2022.\n\nFinally, online, recent Black Out Tuesday and Black Lives Matter movements have propelled many influencers to showcase black content creators. Girls That Scuba has been particularly vocal and supportive on its Instagram account and Facebook group, and I find it comforting to know that there is a community that supports female divers of all backgrounds.\n\nWhether you're curious about exploring a new-to-you charming small town or want to visit one of the region's bustling cities, there is a Southern vacation spot for every family on a budget. From free tours at world-class art museums, scenic bike and hiking trails, and restaurants that are destinations in their own right, here are seven vacation ideas to put on your must-visit list for 2022.\n\n1. Raleigh, North Carolina\n\nFor families that crave the outdoors, go for a walk or cycle the William B. Umstead State Park—a 5,000-acre green space with 22 miles of dedicated hiking trails and 13 miles of multi-use trails. Be sure to check into to the new Heights House Hotel, a 9-room boutique property restored from a historic 1858 Italianate mansion in the heart of downtown Raleigh. Also, for those on a budget, admission is always free at the Contemporary Art Museum in the heart of downtown.\n\n2. Nashville, Tennessee\n\nOpened in 2021, families can travel through time at the National Museum of African American Music, a 56,000-square-foot facility that encourages visitors to discover the central role African Americans have played in shaping all genres of American music, from classical to country to jazz and hip hop. Take the free Architecture Tour at the Frist Art Museum every Saturday at 4:30 p.m. and afterwards, visit local, regional, national and international artist exhibitions. For a lunch break, Slim + Husky’s Pizza Beeria offers budget-friendly custom-built pizzas, takeout and delivery. Their Fifth + Broadway location is the first black-owned business on the famous Broadway honky tonk strip.\n\n3. Jekyll Island, Georgia\n\nAlthough Jekyll Island once had a reputation as being “Millionaire’s Island,” there are many activities available that cater to affordable travel. The Landmark Historic Trolley Tour takes you around part of the 240-acre historic district which includes former stately homes of the Morgans, Vanderbilts, and Rockefellers. Be sure to have lunch on the outdoor patio overlooking the marina at Zachry’s Riverhouse, which serves local seafood like crab cake, oysters, and shrimp (and chicken fingers for the kids).\n\n4. Montgomery, Alabama\n\nYou can attend church service (or just tour) the preserved Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his family resided during his pastorate from 1954-1960. Founded in 1917, Chris' Hot Dogs has been patronized by people from all backgrounds. One of their more notable patrons was Franklin D. Roosevelt who would frequently ask for a box of the ‘world famous’ hot dogs as his train stopped in the Montgomery’s Union Station. Make a day trip out of a 45-minute drive to Selma to see the Edmund Pettus Bridge. The journey is down the same highway from the Montgomery airport so it puts you on an easy path for your arrival or departure flight.\n\n5. Massanutten, Virginia\n\nWhen you need a place where your kids can burn off some real energy, take them to Massanutten, Virginia. One of the biggest highlights of the destination is the Massanutten Resort, which is located among 6,000 sprawling acres in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley. The best aspect is the resort is open all seasons, so families can explore some of 30 miles of mountain biking and hiking trails, ski slopes in the winter, escape rooms, and a Family Adventure Park that features a mega zipline, a golf course, water park, and scenic chairlift. The Shenandoah Caverns are a 40-minute drive from the property where you can explore the cave's 17 rooms and passageways.\n\n6. New Braunfels, Texas\n\nA must visit for history buffs is to Gruene, the historical part of New Braunfels, Texas. Here, families can enjoy live music in the iconic Gruene Hall, known as Texas’ oldest dancehall. Afterwards, take a walk around the area’s local shops. There are also many places in New Braunfels where you can take walking tours in safe outdoor places such as Landa Park, where you can explore the 51 acres by trail or by miniature train. Have lunch or dinner on a budget at the Huisache Grill, which serves favorites like fried catfish, mac ‘n’ cheese, and tilapia.\n\n7. New Orleans, Louisiana\n\nWalking the French Quarter is high on most tourist’s lists, but seeing New Orleans by bike should not be overlooked. Free Wheelin’ Bike Tours’ Creole Crescent Tour takes you to highlights like Saint Louis Cemetery No. 3, where you learn about the tombs and burial practices; Creole mansion and oak-lined Esplanade Avenue; Frenchmen Street & City Park; and the Treme’ neighborhood. Because kids have different appetites, head over to the St. Roch Market: a southern food hall featuring a diverse lineup of food and beverage purveyors including seafood, fried chicken, and southern snacks. Work off some of those tasty jambalaya and crawfish dishes you’ll be eating in New Orleans with a vinyasa yoga session at Reyn Studios.\n\nClocking miles during a wintry day? Make sure you've geared up properly, especially with running shoes for snow that can withstand the elements. “When you're picking the best shoes for running in the snow, you want to consider two main aspects: the traction and grip and what kind of protection the shoe provides from the elements,” says Eric Fruth, Co-Owner and Grassroots Coordinator of ColumbusRunning.com. “Ideally, you're looking for a shoe that has excellent grip on wet or icy terrain, and if it features a water-resistant upper or a weatherproof GORE-TEX upper, even better.”\n\nIn order to pick the right running shoe for you, look for shoes that list out features and materials specific to wet and cold conditions. “There are running shoes that use a rubber that gets tacky on wet surfaces, and that provides extra traction on everything from wet leaves in the fall to snowy paths in winter, says Fruth. “Some shoes are water resistant, which provides protection from conditions like dewy grass, while others are fully waterproof, ideal for anyone outside in the worst of conditions.” Whether you’re a newbie or a veteran runner, here are the best shoes that will hold up when the snowflakes start dropping.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\nThe 9 Best Shoes for Walking on Ice, According to Podiatrists\n\nBirkenstock Is 247 Years Old, But the Newest Designs Keep It Fresh...\n\nThe best running shoes for snow\n\nBrooks Ghost 14 GTX — $160.00\n\nWhen you need a lightweight running shoe for the snow, the Brooks Ghost 14 GTX is a great waterproof option that comes with the brand’s signature 100 percent DNA LOFT cushioning in the midsole. The carbon-neutral shoe is also constructed with a flexible fit, which is connected to the GORE-TEX Invisible Fit membrane.
