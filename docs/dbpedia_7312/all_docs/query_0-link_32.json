Saturday's 4-0 loss marked the first time in which the Huskies had been shut out this season.\n\nThe Huskies have surrendered just three goals on 39 opponent power plays since Jan. 1, a PK success rate of 92.3 percent.\n\nMTU is looking to finish above .500 in WCHA play for the first time since 1992-93, which is also the last time it hosted a first-round playoff series.\n\nMTU COACHING STAFF: Mel Pearson (MTU '81) is in his first season as head coach of his alma mater after spending the previous 23 seasons as an assistant coach at Michigan.\n\nPearson's staff includes assistant coaches Bill Muckalt (Michigan '98) and Damon Whitten (Michigan State '01), and goaltending coach Steve Shields (Michigan '94)\n\nSERIES HISTORY: The Fighting Sioux lead the all-time series with MTU by a 144-90-9 (.611) margin, including an 81-33-4 (.703) edge in Grand Forks.\n\nLast season, UND took a two-game series in Houghton with 6-1 and 11-2 wins, then swept the Huskies the following week in the first round of the WCHA playoffs with 8-0 and 3-1 victories.\n\nThe Sioux have won the last 11 meetings and are 16-2-1 in the last 19. UND is 22-5-1 (.804) against MTU under eighth-year head coach Dave Hakstol.\n\nSenior captain Mario Lamoureux (Grand Forks, N.D.) is UND's leading active scorer against the Huskies with eight points in 11 career games.\n\nJunior goalie Aaron Dell (Airdrie, Alberta) is 3-0 in his career against MTU -- all last season -- with a 0.67 goals against average and a .963 save percentage.\n\nSenior Brad Eidsness (Chesteremere, Alberta) has started 10 career games against the Huskies, going 8-1-1 with a 1.69 GAA and a .921 SV%.\n\nUND'S LAST ACTION: The Sioux are coming off of a series split at No. 3 Minnesota Duluth last week, winning 3-1 on Friday before falling 5-4 on Saturday.\n\nJunior forward Carter Rowney (Sexsmith, Alberta) was in on all three goals on Friday, scoring the first two and setting up the third, a power-play goal by Michael Parks (Fr., St. Louis, Mo.) in the third period. Junior goalie Aaron Dell (Airdrie, Alberta) stopped 26 of 27 shots and came within 66 seconds of his second straight Amsoil Arena shutout.\n\nOn Saturday, UND was done in by four UMD power-play goals on eight chances. The Sioux trailed 5-2 early in the second period before a pair of Rowney goals brought them to within a goal. Sophomore forward Brock Nelson (Warroad, Minn.) added his 20th goal of the season, while freshman Stephane Pattyn (Ste. Anne, Manitoba) notched his second.\n\nSaturday's loss snapped UND's four-game winning streak.\n\nPOLL POSITION: UND is ranked No. 14 in the USCHO.com poll and No. 15 in both the USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine poll and and the Inside College Hockey Power Rankings.\n\nUND sits tied for 15th in the PairWise Rankings and 17th in the KRACH rankings.\n\nHOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS: UND is attempting to secure home ice for the first round of the WCHA playoffs for the 10th consecutive season.\n\nUND's streak of nine straight years of hosting the first round is the longest active streak in the league.\n\nWE'RE GOING STREAKING!: Saturday's loss at Minnesota Duluth was just UND's fourth defeat in the past 17 games (12-4-1), a stretch that began Thanksgiving weekend against Colorado College.\n\nIT'S HOW YOU FINISH: With just three losses in 11 games to start the second half, UND has continued its trend of playing its best hockey after Christmas under eighth-year head coach Dave Hakstol:\n\nYear Before After\n\n2004-05 13-7-2 (.636) 12-8-3 (.587)\n\n2005-06 12-7-1 (.625) 17-9-0 (.654)\n\n2006-07 7-10-1 (.417) 17-4-4 (.760)\n\n2007-08 8-6-1 (.567) 20-5-3 (.768)\n\n2008-09 9-8-1 (.528) 15-7-3 (.660)\n\n2009-10 9-6-3 (.583) 16-7-2 (.680)\n\n2010-11 13-5-2 (.700) 19-4-1 (.813)\n\n2011-12 9-8-1 (.528) 7-3-1 (.682)\n\nTotals 80-57-12 (.577) 122-47-17 (.702)\n\nUND has been particularly effective once the calendar turns to February. Over the previous three seasons, the Sioux have gone 26-5-1 (.828) from February to April, and 77-24-12 (.735) overall in those months during Hakstol's entire tenure.\n\nGET CARTER: Prior to this season, junior forward Carter Rowney (Sexsmith, Alberta) had scored four goals in 67 career games.\n\nHe matched those four goals last weekend alone, and added an assist, in UND's split at No. 3 Minnesota Duluth.\n\nIn Friday's 3-1 win, Rowney scored the game's first two goals and assisted on the third, then added two more goals the following night.\n\nRowney now ranks third on the team with 12 goals and ranks fourth with 21 points.\n\nRowney has been held without a point in consecutive games just once (Jan. 13-14 vs. Minnesota) since UND's Nov. 19-20 series at Bemidji State.\n\nBROCK 'N' ROLL: Sophomore forward Brock Nelson (Warroad, Minn.) scored his team-leading 20th goal of the season in UND's 5-4 loss at No. 3 UMD last Saturday.\n\nAt 20 years old, Nelson became UND's youngest 20-goal scorer since an 18-year old Jonathan Toews scored 22 as a freshman in 2005-06.\n\nNelson trails only Minnesota's Nick Bjugstad (21 goals) in the WCHA goal-scoring race, and Nelson's 17 goals in 22 WCHA games lead the league.\n\nWith nine power-play goals (all games), Nelson is tied for second in the WCHA and is one off the league lead despite having gone 13 games without a power-play tally.\n\nPARKS AND REC: Freshman forward Michael Parks (St., Louis, Mo.) continued his consistent production with a goal and an assist in Friday's 3-1 win at No. 3 UND.\n\nAlthough he was held without a point the following night, Parks has now reached the scoresheet in six of the last eight games, with four goals and three assists during that time.\n\nParks leads all UND freshmen with seven goals and has added four assists through 29 games.\n\nBOLSTERING THE BLUELINE: Playing in his hometown for the first time in his collegiate career, Duluth native and sophomore defenseman Derek Forbort registered one assist and was a team-leading plus-4 in UND's split at No. 3 Minnesota Duluth last weekend.\n\nIn four games since returning to the lineup from an injury, Forbort has two assists and is a plus-3. He had a goal and three assists with an even rating in his first 18 games.\n\nDAN THE MAN: Junior forward Danny Kristo (Eden Prairie, Minn.) is just five points away from becoming the 83rd UND player to score 100 career points, and the first active Sioux to do so.\n\nKristo enters the week with 95 points (37g, 58a) in 104 career games. He was held without a point last weekend at Minnesota Duluth after having scored six points in his previous three games.\n\nIn 29 games this season, Kristo ranks second on the team with 31 points (14g, 17a) and is five points from matching the career-high 36 he recorded as a freshman in 2009-10.\n\nNOT YOUR AVERAGE JOE: Playing forward due to injuries, junior defenseman Joe Gleason (Edina, Minn.) assisted on three of UND's four goals in Saturday's 5-4 loss at Minnesota Duluth.\n\nGleason's three assists matched his career high for both assists and points in a game. He also dished out three assists in a 7-3 win over Harvard on New Year's Eve.\n\nGleason ranks third on the team with 13 assists in 28 games, 16 of which have come at forward and 12 of which have come at defense.\n\nEIDS WIDE SHUT: Senior goalie Brad Eidsness (Chestermere, Alberta) came off the bench to stop all 14 shots he faced in Saturday's 5-4 loss at Minnesota Duluth.\n\nIt was Eidsness' 98th career appearance, leaving him on the verge of joining select company among UND goalies with 100 appearances:\n\nWith 54 career wins, Eidsness needs one more victory to tie Jordan Parise (2003-06) for third all-time at UND:\n\nEidsness also ranks fifth all-time at UND in goals against average (2.42), sixth in save percentage (.906), tied for eighth in shutouts (four), ninth in saves (2,145) and 10th in winning percentage (.657).\n\nHis 2.08 goals against average and .924 save percentage this season are both the best of his career.\n\nCROWDED HOUSE: UND has played in front of capacity crowds in each of its last four games.\n\nThe Sioux boasted crowds 11,898 and 11,769 against Wisconsin (Jan. 27-28) and 11,964 and 11,846 against Minnesota (Jan. 13-14). Those four crowds were UND's largest of the season.\n\nUND is averaging 11,267 fans per game this season, down slightly from last season's school-record 11, 756 average attendance, and has sold out seven of 16 home games.\n\nLINEUP LIMITATIONS: With injured forwards Rocco Grimaldi (Fr., Rossmoor, Calif.), Brendan O'Donnell (Fr., Winnipeg, Manitoba) and Derek Rodwell (So., Taber, Alberta) all out for the season, UND will not have the luxury of playing with a healthy scratch (among skaters) for the remainder of the season.\n\nSix players have combined to miss 58 games due to injury so far this season:\n\nRocco Grimaldi, 25\n\nBrendan O'Donnell, 12\n\nDerek Rodwell, 10\n\nDerek Forbort, 5\n\nCorban Knight, 3\n\nMario Lamoureux, 3\n\nKNIGHTLINE IS ALWAYS ON: UND's top line of juniors Corban Knight (High River, Alberta) and Danny Kristo (Eden Prairie, Minn.) and sophomore Brock Nelson (Warroad, Minn.) has played together for 20 of UND's 29 games, including 12 wins and eight losses.\n\nIn those 12 wins, the trio has combined for 59 points (28, 31) and an average of 4.9 points per game.\n\nIn the eight losses, they have combined for nine points (6g, 4a), which equates to just 1.1 points per game.\n\nNelson (20-12-32), Kristo (14-17-31) and Knight (8-18-26) are UND's top three scorers and have scored 47.2 percent of the team's goals (42 of 89) this season.\n\nTHERE WILL BE BLOOD: Senior defenseman Ben Blood (Plymouth, Minn.) enters the week having appeared in 129 consecutive games, the longest active streak on the team.\n\nThe school record for consecutive games played is 175 -- also an NCAA record -- and is shared by Ryan Duncan (2005-09) and Chris Porter (2003-07). Porter currently plays with the NHL's St. Louis Blues and Duncan with the AHL's Portland Pirates (Phoenix Coyotes).\n\nIn 29 games this season, Blood ranks second among UND defensemen with 14 points on two goals and 12 assists. Both of his goals have been game-winners.\n\nBlood is a plus-5 over his last three games.\n\nBIG MAC ATTACK: Junior defenseman Andrew MacWilliam (Calgary, Alberta) was UND's top-scoring defenseman in January with five points (2g, 3a) in seven games after collecting just one assist through the team's first 20 games.\n\nHe has two goals in the last eight games after going his first 101 career games without a tally.\n\nMacWilliam is a plus-6 over the last five games.\n\nFOLLOWING THE \"GENERAL\": Freshman forward Stephane Pattyn (Ste. Anne, Manitoba) made his first career goal one to remember.\n\nPattyn scored with 1:54 remaining in the third period to break a 3-3 tie in an eventual 5-3 win over Wisconsin on Jan. 27. To top it off, the goal came on Pattyn's 21st birthday.\n\nSUPER DAVE: UND's 3-2 win at SCSU on Jan. 21 was the 200th victory for Dave Hakstol, enabling him to join John \"Gino\" Gasparini (392 wins, 1978-94) and Dean Blais (262 wins, 1994-2004) as the only UND coaches to reach that milestone.\n\nHakstol, Gasparini and Blais each won their 200th game in their eighth season. Hakstol played under Gasparini at UND, and was brought to the UND coaching staff as an assistant coach by Blais.\n\nWith 32 wins last season, UND has reached the 20-win plateau in each of Hakstol's first seven seasons behind the bench. It was also the 3rd-highest win total in program history.\n\nHakstol's streak of seven straight 20-win seasons is the second-longest in UND history, behind only Gasparini's 13 in a row (1978-79 to 1990-91).\n\nDUDE, WE'VE GOT A DELL: Junior goalie Aaron Dell (Airdrie, Alberta) earned a 26-save shutout in UND's 1-0 win over Nebraska Omaha (Dec. 10) to close out the first half of the season. It was his first shutout of the season and eighth of his career, which ranks fourth all-time at UND:\n\nDell was named WCHA Defensive Player of the Week following the UNO series.\n\nNORTHERN EXPOSURE: UND's win over Clarkson at the MTS Centre in Winnipeg on Jan. 7 drew 7,075 fans, out-drawing all but three NCAA Division I men's hockey games that night.\n\nOnly New Hampshire vs. Maine (38,456 at Fenway Park), RIT at Wisconsin (12,453) and Notre Dame at Minnesota (10,242) drew more.\n\nDubbed the 'U.S. College Hockey Classic,' the game was UND's first on Canadian soil in 59 years. The last time UND played a men's hockey game in Canada was Dec. 29-30, 1953, when UND lost a pair of games to host Fort Frances (Ontario).\n\nThe last time UND played outside of the United States was Dec. 26-29, 1982, when the team competed in the Spengler Cup in Switzerland.\n\nVOTE FOR HOBEY: Senior defenseman Ben Blood (Plymouth, Minn.) and junior forward Danny Kristio (Eden Prairie, Minn.) are among the 77 players on the ballot for the Hobey Baker Award 'Vote for Hobey' fan balltoing.\n\nBlood, who logs more minutes than any other UND player, has emerged as one of the top two-way defensemen in NCAA hockey.\n\nHe has played in all 29 games this season, registering two goals and 12 assists. Both of his goals have been game-winners, tying him for fifth-most by a UND defenseman in a single season.\n\nBlood leads all active UND skaters with 147 games played and has appeared in 129 straight games. Last season, Blood led the nation with a +32 rating and was named to his second straight Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) All-Academic Team.\n\nKristo ranks second on the team in scoring with 31 points (14 goals, 17 assists) in 29 games and ranks second on the team with three game-winning goals.\n\nThe 2009-10 WCHA Rookie of the Year, Kristo is UND's active scoring leader with 95 points (37g, 58a) in 104 career games.\n\nThis first phase of fan balloting will run now through March 4, 2012. Phase two of fan balloting will begin on March 16 from the list of Top 10 Hobey Baker finalists. The fan vote accounts for a full 1 percent of the total ballot in each phase in selecting this year's award recipient.\n\nHELLO, MY NAME IS: UND head coach Dave Hakstol announced on Jan. 10 that forward Mitch MacMillan (So., Penticton, British Columbia) transferred to UND and will join the team immediately. MacMillan is eligible to begin practicing with the team, but will not be eligible to compete until January 2013.\n\nMacMillan will have two years of NCAA eligibility remaining when he resumes competition next January.\n\nMacMillan transferred to UND from St. Cloud State, where he had five assists in 14 games this season. In 28 games last season as a freshman, MacMillan had four goals and two assists.\n\nMacMillan's younger brother, Mark, is currently a freshman forward at UND. The last time the two were teammates was in 2009-10 with Alberni Valley of the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL), when they were the team's top two scorers and combined for 173 points (87 goals, 86 assists) in 59 games.\n\nASSISTANCE PLAN: Junior goalie Aaron Dell (Airdrie, Alberta) has four career assists, a total topped by only one goalie in the history of the program: current volunteer assistant coach Karl Goehring.\n\nGoehring amassed a school-record seven assists from 1997 to 2001.\n\nMARIO'S MILESTONE: When senior captain Mario Lamoureux (Grand Forks, N.D.) scored the game-winning goal on Nov. 19 at Bemidji State, he entered the UND history books by scoring the 10,000th goal in program history.\n\nPerhaps it was fitting that Lamoureux would be the one to score the milestone goal, considering he is from Grand Forks, and his extensive family ties to UND hockey.\n\nLamoureux's sisters, Jocelyne and Monique, are junior forwards on UND's women's hockey team.\n\nHis father, Pierre, played goalie for UND from 1979-82 and was a member of two NCAA championship teams.\n\nHis brother, Jean-Philippe, was a goaltender at UND from 2004-08 and was an All-American as a senior.\n\nAnother brother, Pierre-Paul, is currently in his third season on UND's coaching staff as assistant video coordinator.\n\nFinally, his uncle, Roger Lamoureux, was a four-year letterwinner at forward for UND from 1973 to 1977.\n\nSUPER MARIO: In addition to the 10,000-goals milestone, Lamoureux's tally on Nov. 19 was significant for another reason.\n\nWith the goal, UND improved to 13-0-0 all-time when Lamoureux scores.\n\nTHE EAGLE SOARS INTO THE HALL: UND legend Ed Belfour made history on Nov. 14 when he became the first UND product to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nBelfour parlayed a historic 1986-87 freshman season into a distinguished professional career that saw him become the third-winningest goalie in NHL history. Only Martin Brodeur (636 wins) and Patrick Roy (551) have won more games than Belfour, who won 484 from 1988 to 2007.\n\nA native of Carman, Manitoba, Belfour won a UND-record 29 games (since broken) in 1986-87 and was named an NCAA All-American after leading UND to the 1987 national championship. He was the backbone of the famed \"Hrkac Circus\" team that won a then-NCAA-record 40 games.\n\nBelfour twice won the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's best goalie and helped lead the Dallas Stars to a Stanley Cup championship in 1999.\n\nA six-time all-star game participant, Belfour ranks third in NHL history in wins (484), fourth in games played (963) and saves (24,750), and ninth in shutouts (76). He finished his career with a 2.50 goals against average and a .906 save percentage.\n\nBelfour also excelled on the international stage, winning a Canada Cup in 1991 and an Olympic gold medal in 2002 for Canada.\n\nWE WERE MERELY FRESHMEN: Forwards Rocco Grimaldi (Rossmoor, Calif.) and Mark MacMillan (Penticton, British Columbia) were both ranked among the top 20 freshman forwards in the country by InsideCollegeHockey.com in October.\n\nGrimaldi was ranked No. 5 and MacMillan was ranked No. 11.\n\nUND's overall freshman class was ranked No. 2 in the nation behind only Miami's.\n\nCALLING ALL CAPTAINS: Senior forward Mario Lamoureux (Grand Forks, N.D.) was named team captain at UND's annual preseason media day luncheon.\n\nIn 43 games last season, Lamoureux established career highs in points (17) and assists (14) while earning his second straight WCHA All-Academic selection. In 109 career games, Lamoureux has amassed 13 goals and 22 assists.\n\nLamoureux's younger sister, Jocelyne, was named captain of UND's women's this season.\n\nMario Lamoureux joins Steve Johnson (1987-88), Jeff Panzer (2000-01) and Andy Schneider (2003-04) as the only Grand Forks natives to captain their hometown team.\n\nSenior defenseman Ben Blood (Plymouth, Minn.), junior defenseman Andrew MacWilliam (Calgary, Alberta) and junior forward Corban Knight (High River, Alberta) were named assistant captains.\n\nHELLO, MY NAME IS: UND welcomes 10 freshmen to the lineup this season, including forwards Rocco Grimaldi (Rossmoor, Calif.), Connor Gaarder (Edina, Minn.), Mark MacMillan (Penticton, British Columbia), Brendan O'Donnell (Winnipeg, Manitoba), Michael Parks (St. Louis, Mo.), Stephane Pattyn (Ste. Anne, Manitoba) and Colten St. Clair (Gilbert, Ariz.), and defensemen Nick Mattson (Chanhassen, Minn.), Dan Senkbeil (Fremont, Calif.) and Andrew Panzarella (Washington, D.C.).\n\nIt is UND's largest freshman class since 2005-06, when UND brought in 13 freshmen.\n\nThat class included future NHLers Jonathan Toews, T.J. Oshie, Taylor Chorney and Brian Lee, as well as 2006-07 Hobey Baker Award winner Ryan Duncan.\n\nFEELING A DRAFT: The 2011-12 UND roster boasts 15 National Hockey League draft picks, including 2011 selections Rocco Grimaldi (Fr., Rossmoor, Calif.) and Dillon Simpson (So., Edmonton, Alberta).\n\nGrimaldi was taken in the second round (33rd overall) by Florida, while Simpson went in the fourth round (92nd overall) to Edmonton.\n\nSimpson's father, Craig, won two Stanley Cups with Edmonton during his 10-year NHL career. He is now the lead color analyst on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's (CBC) Hockey Night in Canada.\n\nUND's current collection of draft picks features two 1st-rounders (Derek Forbort, Brock Nelson), two 2nd-rounders (Rocco Grimaldi, Danny Kristo), three 4th-rounders (Ben Blood, Mark MacMillan, Dillon Simpson), four 5th-rounders (Brad Eidsness, Corban Knight, Michael Parks, Derek Rodwell), two 6th-rounders (Nick Mattson, Brendan O'Donnell) and two 7th-rounders (Joe Gleason, Andrew MacWilliam).\n\nTRADITION NEVER GRADUATES: Fourteen former UND players have played in the NHL this season: Jason Blake (Anaheim), Taylor Chorney (Edmonton, St. Louis), Mike Commodore (Detroit), Joe Finley (Buffalo), Matt Frattin (Toronto), Matt Greene (Los Angeles), Brian Lee (Ottawa), Brad Malone (Colorado), T.J. Oshie (St. Louis), Zach Parise (New Jersey), Chris Porter (St. Louis), Drew Stafford (Buffalo), Jonathan Toews (Chicago), and Travis Zajac (New Jersey).\n\nWith the exception of Blake, who played at UND from 1996-99, each of the above players was coached by Hakstol during his tenure as a head coach or assistant coach at UND.\n\nOther UND products in the NHL include Phoenix head coach Dave Tippett, Columbus assistant Brad Berry, Buffalo assistant James Patrick, Minnesota assistant Rick Wilson, Phoenix video coach Steve Peters, Minnesota Wild Director of Player Development Brad Bombardir, and Chicago Blackhawks radio analyst Troy Murray. Additionally, former UND football letterwinner Mark Chipman is the chairman of the Winnipeg Jets.\n\nSixteen UND products played in the NHL last season, including: Jason Blake (Anaheim), Taylor Chorney (Edmonton), Mike Commodore (Columbus), Matt Frattin (Toronto), Matt Greene (Los Angeles), David Hale (Ottawa), Ryan Johnson (Chicago), Brian Lee (Ottawa), T.J.

Kings and forward Drew Stafford (2003-06) holds the same title for the Buffalo Sabres.\n\nFOREVER UND: Every member of UND's coaching staff is a graduate of the University of North Dakota.\n\nHead coach Dave Hakstol (1989-92), associate head coach Cary Eades (1978-82), assistant coach Dane Jackson (1988-92) and volunteer assistant Karl Goehring (1998-2001) each played for UND.\n\nAdditionally, nearly every member of the support staff is also a graduate of UND, including director of hockey operations Pat Swanson (2002), athletic trainer and strength coach Mark Poolman (1992), team physician Dr. Greg Greek, media relations director Jayson Hajdu (2000) and administrative assistant Carmen Pester.\n\nRANK AND FILE: UND was voted No. 2 (four first-place votes) in the 41st annual Grand Forks Herald WCHA Coaches Preseason Poll and No. 3 (two first-place votes) in the 93X (Duluth) WCHA Media Preseason Poll.\n\nIn both polls, UND freshman forward Rocco Grimaldi (Rossmoor, Calif.) was named the preseason WCHA Rookie of the Year.\n\n2011-12 Grand Forks Herald\n\nWCHA Coaches Preseason Poll\n\nRk Team (1st place votes) Points\n\n1.
