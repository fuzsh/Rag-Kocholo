        "text": "Several superb athletes have gotten their start on Little League® fields, and many have gone on to have great careers on the ice. Here are some Little League graduates who have achieved success in the world of hockey.\n\nChris Drury (Trumbull Little League – Trumbull, Conn.)\n\nMr. Drury is perhaps the most famous Little Leaguer® turned professional hockey player. He was the pitcher for the 1989 Little League Baseball® World Series champions from Trumbull, Conn. He pitched a complete game in the World Championship game, giving up five hits and driving in two runs. He would go on to play four years of NCAA Division I Ice Hockey at Boston University (BU). He won a National Championship with the BU Terriers as a freshman in 1995. As a senior in 1998, he took home the Hobey Baker Award which is presented annually to the best NCAA Div. I men’s ice hockey player. In the NHL, Mr. Drury played more than 800 games and amassed in excess of 600 points. He won the 1999 Calder trophy as the NHL’s rookie of the year and in 2001 reached the pinnacle of the NHL, when he won the Stanley Cup with the Colorado Avalanche. To this day, Drury remains the only player to win a Little League Baseball World Series title and a Stanley Cup. In 2009, Mr. Drury was enshrined in the Little League Hall of Excellence, and joined the Little League International Board of Directors in 2011.\n\nPierre Turgeon (Rotary Little League – Rouyn, Quebec)\n\nA participant on the Canada Region Champions at the 1982 Little League Baseball World Series, Mr. Turgeon is often referred to as one of the best players who never won a Stanley Cup. Playing more than 1200 games in the NHL, he still holds numerous records for the Buffalo Sabres, who drafted him first overall in 1987. Mr. Turgeon won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, which is awarded each year to the player in the NHL deemed to have exhibited the best sportsmanship along with ability. Mr. Turgeon played in more than 100 playoff games, scoring 35 goals. His deepest run in the Stanley Cup Playoffs came in 2001, when as a member of the St. Louis Blues, his team lost to Mr. Drury’s Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference Final. Mr. Turgeon was enshrined in the Little League Hall of Excellence in 2007.\n\nStephane Matteau (Rotary Little League – Rouyn, Quebec)\n\nA teammate of Mr. Turgeon’s on the Canada Region’s 1982 Little League Baseball World Series team, Stephane Matteau is certainly the player on this list with the most iconic NHL postseason moment. His Game 7 double-overtime game-winning goal for the New York Rangers in the 1994 Eastern Conference Final is considered by many to be the greatest goal in team history. Mr. Matteau, who was known more for his dedication and hard work than his goal scoring, scored in double overtime twice in the 1994 Eastern Conference Final, including that Game 7 goal the secured his team a ticket to the Stanley Cup Final. That spring, he became the first player to play in the Little League Baseball World Series and win the Stanley Cup; a feat that he and Mr. Drury now share.\n\nRay Ferraro (Trail Little League – Trail, British Columbia)\n\nNow recognized as a hockey analyst in his home country of Canada, Ray Ferraro played in the 1976 Little League Baseball World Series with the team representing Canada that year out of Trail, British Columbia. On the ice, Mr. Ferraro put together an impressive career that spanned from the 80s through the earliest part of the new millennium. He dressed in more than 1,200 games and amassed more than 800 points, including 400-plus goals. He never won the Stanley Cup, but he does have some playoff highlights. He is most well-known for the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs, where his New York Islanders beat the two-time defending champion, Pittsburgh Penguins. He helped set up the series clinching goal.\n\nKrissy Wendell-Pohl (Brooklyn Park American Little League – Brooklyn Park, Minnesota)"
