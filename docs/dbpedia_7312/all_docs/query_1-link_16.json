        "text": "Brad Bombardir\n\nHometown: Powell River, B.C\n\nDefenseman Brad Bombardir started playing hockey at the age of five and participated in junior hockey with his hometown Powell River Paper Kings of the BCJHL for two years before enrolling at the University of North Dakota in 1990-91. He played with the school for four years. During his sophomore year at North Dakota, Bombardir was chosen to represent Canada at the 1992 World Junior Championships.\n\nBombardir was originally selected in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft by the New Jersey Devils in the third round, 56th overall. Following the completion of his NCAA playing days at North Dakota he joined the Devils AHL affiliate in Albany where he played exclusively for three years before getting a chance at playing with the Devils in 1997-98 when he dressed for 43 games. His presence with the team increased to 56 games the following year. Bombardir remained in the Devils’ organization for another season winning the Stanley Cup before being traded to the expansion Minnesota Wild in the summer of 2000 and went on to play parts of four seasons with the Wild before being acquired by the Nashville Predators in the latter stages of the 2003-04 season.\n\nAdam Presizniuk\n\nCenter\n\nBorn Nov 29 1986 — Calgary, ALTA\n\nHeight 6.00 — Weight 180 — Shoots L\n\nPresizniuk led the Dutchmen in scoring last season with seven goals and 18 assists, becoming the first freshman to be the team’s top scorer since Chris Ford in 1993-94. Presizniuk had five multipoint games, including a career-high three-point effort (all assists) at Quinnipiac Nov. 30. He was named to the ECACH All-Rookie team, and won the team’s most valuable and rookie of the year awards. Played three seasons for the Powell River Kings of the British Columbia Hockey League … Recorded 212 points with 86 goals and 126 assists in 166 games … Served as an assistant captain in 2006-07 … Named the team’s Rookie of the Year in 2004 … Led the team in scoring in 2006-07 with 101 points on 45 goals and 56 assists in 64 games … Named the team’s MVP … Played in the 2007 BCHL All-Star Game.\n\nJeff Hoggan\n\nHometown: Hope, British Columbia\n\nJeff Hoggan was born February 1, 1978 in Hope, British Columbia. A free-agent signing of the AHL’s Worcester IceCats in the summer of 2004, Hoggan played three years at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, where he registered 99 points along with 252 penalty minutes. Named to the CCHA’s First All-Star Team in 2002, Hoggan was also named to the NCAA West Second All-American Team that same year before opting to forego his senior year to sign as a free-agent with the AHL’s Houston Aeros..\n\nHoggan went on to play two seasons with the club from 2002 to 2004, helping the Aeros capture their first Calder Cup title in 2003 before joining the St. Louis Blues organization in 2004-05. After one full season with the club’s AHL affiliate Worcester, Hoggan would split the 2005-06 season between the AHL and the parent club in St. Louis. In the summer of 2006, Hoggan signed as a free agent with the Boston Bruins.\n\nRobb Gordon\n\nHometown: Murrayville, British Columbia\n\nMurrayville, British Columbia native Robb Gordon lived the dream of many young hockey players in that province when he was drafted by the local Vancouver Canucks. Gordon was taken with their second choice in the 1994 Entry Draft while playing for the Powell River Kings and spent the next two years preparing for his professional career with a year at the University of Michigan followed by a season of Junior with the Kelowna Rockets. Gordon excelled with the Rockets by firing home 51 goals and 114 points in 58 games. He was also named to Canada’s World Junior Championship team in December.\n\nGordon’s first season as a professional was spent with the Canucks primary farm club, the Syracuse Crunch. The center was able to score 11 goals and 25 points as a rookie in 63 games. His second year in the organization saw his development move in the wrong direction however. He split the season between the East Coast Hockey League’s Raleigh Icecaps and Syracuse but he managed just seven goals and 23 points that year combined. The 1998-99 season featured Gordon’s only stint in the National Hockey League. The bulk of his year was spent back with the Crunch, but he did receive a call from the Canucks, which resulted in a four game run with Vancouver. Gordon was unable to register a point but he was called for a minor penalty.\n\nThe following season Gordon was in the International Hockey League with the Long Beach Ice Dogs, however he was only able to produce 18 points in 50 games with the club, it was clear he was running out of options for his career. In the summer of 2000 Gordon looked across the pond for his next opportunity. Gordon signed a deal with the Manchester Storm of the British Super League. The Storm roster featured four other former Western Hockey League players, so Gordon was treading on totally unfamiliar ground.\n\nLudek Broz\n\nHometown: Pardubice, Czech Republic\n\nLudek was one of the most skilled players to ever wear a Kings jersey. He made the long adventure overseas in the early 1990’s to play for the Kings. Ludek was another one of those players that made Powell River a Canadian Junior “A” powerhouse. The talented forward is #12 in BCHL history for both career assists (184) and points (314) .\n\nHe played for the Kings during the 1993/94 and 1994/95 seasons before embarking on his very succesful European hockey career. Ludek was one of many European players to make the Powell River hockey program their choice in the 1990’s.\n\nDerek Bekar\n\nHometown: Burnaby, British Columbia\n\nDespite being drafted by the St. Louis Blues in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft while playing for the Powell River Kings left winger Derek Bekar elected to take his game to the NCAA level rather than go the pro route. Bekar spent the next three years at New Hampshire University where he excelled on the ice and was named to the Hockey East Second All-Star Team in 1998.\n\nIn 1998-99 Bekar began his pro career when he joined the Blues farm team, the Worcester Ice Cats of the American Hockey League. During his second year with the ‘Cats Bekar reached the 20-goal plateau and also earned a brief call-up to St. Louis. After getting off to a slow start the following campaign with Worcester the Blues traded him to the Washington Capitals. Though he was never given a chance to suit up for the Capitals, Bekar did manage to rediscover his touch with their farm team and contributed 19 goals and 35 points in 58 games. At seasons end Bekar became a free agent and signed a deal with the Los Angeles Kings. Though Bekar did earn a call-up from the Kings early in the 2001-02 season, he never got into their line up and was soon sent back to their affliate in Manchester.\n\nWith the Manchester Monarchs Bekar enjoyed his most productive season as professional scoring 27 goals and 47 points, both career highs. After one more season in the Kings system, Bekar signed as a free agent with the New York Islanders in the summer of 2003.\n\nBret Meyers\n\nHometown: Uxbridge, Ontario\n\nBret was recruited out of Ontario by Powell River in the early 1990’s and had a remarkable career in a Kings uniform.

His line of NHL 2nd round draft pick Rob Gordon and import Czech recruit Ludek Broz share the team record for most points by a line in one season. They totaled 354 points between the three of them. Bret received a full sholarship to Michigan Tech University and then went on to a pro career.\n\nBret had a busy first pro season as he played for four different teams in three leagues.

Bret is currently coaching in the Ontario Junior A Hockey League.\n\nRichard Seeley\n\nHometown: Powell River, British Columbia\n\nRichard played for the Kings as a 16 year old in the 1995/96 season. He decided to go the route of the Western Hockey league and became very succesful. He is a Powell River kid who was drafted by Los Angeles in 1997. Richard continues to play profesionally in Germany and is a good example that Powell River provides a good learning atmosphere in its hockey program which enables players to pursue either an American scholarship or play in the Western Hockey League which Richard decided was best for him.\n\nEthan Cox\n\nHometown: Richmond, British Columbia\n\nPlayed for Powell River of the British Columbia Hockey League for two seasons … Recorded 41 goals and 43 assists for 84 points in 64 games during the 2005-06 campaign … Finished his final season ranked 16th in the league in scoring … Accumulated 65 penalty minutes during the 2005-06 season … Scored 10 points in five playoff games his final seaosn … Received six team awards in 2005-06: most inspirational player, most popular player, player of the year, most valuable player, top scorer, and the True Grit Award … Served as an assistant captain.\n\nPreviously played for the Delta Icehawks of the Pacific International Junior Hockey League.Currently playing College hockey for the Colgate Raiders in the ECACHL after receiving a scholarship during the 2005/2006 season in Powell River.
