        "text": "Photo by Jennifer Small Photography\n\nThe Kings have acquired 2004 born defenseman Lucas Marshall from the Trail Smoke Eaters in exchange for forward Kailus Green.\n\nMarshall hails from Newport Beach, California and is in his second BCHL season where he has played in 73 games between the Wenatchee Wild and Smoke Eaters. Marshall will be a welcomed addition to the blue line with the Kings defense dealing with a number of injuries and assistant G.M. Stephan Seeger Jr. expects him to fit in very well with his new team. “He is a defender who is going to bring speed and mobility to our D core” he says “He’s very good on the blueline at finding tough shooting lanes and has a high compete level. We are very excited to add Lucas, he will acclimate to our system nicely.” This season for the Smoke Eaters Marshall has 3 goals and 3 assists in 29 games.\n\nMarshall comes from a hockey family with his father Jason having a professional career that spanned for nearly 20 years. He was drafted 9th overall in the 1989 NHL Draft by the St. Louis Blues, and he went on to play 526 games in the NHL for the Blues, Ducks, Capitals, Wild, and Sharks. During his time with the Wild he was teammates with Powell River’s own Brad Bombardir.\n\nGoing to Trail is forward Kailus Green who joined the Kings in a trade with the West Kelowna Warriors in the offseason. In 26 games this season he had 2 goals and 6 assists."
