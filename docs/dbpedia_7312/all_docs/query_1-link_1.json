        "text": "Canadian ice hockey player (born 1981)\n\nIce hockey player\n\nBarret D. Jackman (born March 5, 1981) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the St. Louis Blues and the Nashville Predators. Jackman was selected 17th overall in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft by the St. Louis Blues. Jackman was born in Trail, British Columbia and grew up in Salmo, British Columbia & later Fruitvale, British Columbia. Jackman was often known for his physical style of play and fighting abilities.\n\nPlaying career\n\n[edit]\n\nJackman first started playing Junior \"A\" and \"B\" with his hometown's Trail Smoke Eaters and the Beaver Valley Nitehawks in the 1996-97 season. With the Nitehawks, he captured the KIJHL Championship along with winning the Cyclone Taylor Cup; the British Columbia Junior \"B\" Championships in his first and only season in juniors.\n\nThe following year he was named the youngest captain ever in the history of the Regina Pats in the Western Hockey League and played four seasons there, with 796 penalty-in-minutes (PIM) in 234 regular WHL season games played.\n\nAfter playing junior and major junior hockey for five years, he was drafted in the first round, 17th overall, in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft at the FleetCenter in Boston by the St. Louis Blues.\n\nIn the 2002–03 NHL season he finished with a plus-23 rating and was among the leaders for NHL rookies in average ice time per game. Jackman won the Calder Memorial Trophy (Rookie of the Year) in 2003, narrowly beating out the Detroit Red Wings' Henrik Zetterberg and the Columbus Blue Jackets' Rick Nash.[1]\n\nHe was sidelined by a chronic dislocated shoulder during much of the 2003–04 season, and thus played in only 15 games that season; a somewhat disappointing follow-up to his stellar rookie year.\n\nWhen the NHL was locked out Jackman stayed in St. Louis and played for the Missouri River Otters. He returned to the Blues for the 2005–06 season. For the 2006–07 season Jackman set career highs in assists and points. He was a member of the 2007 Canadian IIHF World Championship team that won gold in a 4–2 win against Finland in Moscow, Russia.\n\nOn June 18, 2012, Jackman was re-signed by the Blues to a three-year contract extension.[2]\n\nOn June 11, 2015, Jackman was informed by the Blues that his association with the club after 16 years would end, releasing him to free agency. On July 1, 2015, Jackman signed with Central Division rivals the Nashville Predators on a two-year contract, worth an average of $2 million per season.[3] In the 2015–16 season with the Predators, Jackman was a staple on the blueline, adding 5 points in 74 contests. He appeared in all 14 post-season games before the Predators were eliminated in the Conference Semi-Finals by the San Jose Sharks. After only one year in Nashville, on June 30, 2016, Jackman was placed on unconditional waivers for the purpose of buying out the final year of his contract.[4]\n\nJackman officially retired on October 4, 2016, after signing a one day contract with St. Louis to retire as a member of the Blues.[5]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nJackman married Jenny Jackman in July 2007. They have two children together. Jackman's childhood home was used for filming in the Canadian television series Road Hockey Rumble.\n\nCareer statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nRegular season and playoffs\n\n[edit]\n\nRegular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 1996–97 Beaver Valley Nitehawks KIJHL 32 22 25 47 180 — — — — — 1996–97 Trail Smoke Eaters BCHL 10 1 1 2 6 — — — — — 1997–98 Regina Pats WHL 68 2 11 13 224 9 0 3 3 32 1998–99 Regina Pats WHL 70 8 36 44 259 — — — — — 1999–00 Regina Pats WHL 53 9 37 46 175 6 1 1 2 19 1999–00 Worcester IceCats AHL — — — — — 2 0 0 0 13 2000–01 Regina Pats WHL 43 9 27 36 138 6 0 3 3 8 2001–02 St. Louis Blues NHL 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 2001–02 Worcester IceCats AHL 75 2 12 14 266 3 0 1 1 4 2002–03 St. Louis Blues NHL 82 3 16 19 190 7 0 0 0 14 2003–04 St. Louis Blues NHL 15 1 2 3 41 — — — — — 2004–05 Missouri River Otters UHL 28 3 17 20 61 3 0 0 0 4 2005–06 St. Louis Blues NHL 63 4 6 10 156 — — — — — 2006–07 St. Louis Blues NHL 70 3 24 27 82 — — — — — 2006–07 Peoria Rivermen AHL 1 0 0 0 0 — — — — — 2007–08 St. Louis Blues NHL 78 2 14 16 93 — — — — — 2008–09 St. Louis Blues NHL 82 4 17 21 86 4 0 1 1 5 2009–10 St. Louis Blues NHL 66 2 15 17 81 — — — — — 2010–11 St. Louis Blues NHL 60 0 13 13 57 — — — — — 2011–12 St. Louis Blues NHL 81 1 12 13 57 9 0 1 1 21 2012–13 St. Louis Blues NHL 46 3 9 12 39 6 1 1 2 10 2013–14 St. Louis Blues NHL 79 3 12 15 97 6 1 2 3 6 2014–15 St. Louis Blues NHL 80 2 13 15 47 6 0 0 0 4 2015–16 Nashville Predators NHL 73 1 4 5 76 14 0 0 0 22 NHL totals 876 29 157 186 1102 53 2 5 7 84\n\nInternational\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Team Event Result GP G A Pts PIM 2000 Canada WJC 7 0 1 1 8 2001 Canada WJC 7 0 3 3 10 2007 Canada WC 9 0 2 2 6 Junior totals 14 0 4 4 18 Senior totals 9 0 2 2 6\n\nAwards and honours\n\n[edit]\n\nAward Year WHL East Second All-Star Team 2000 NHL All-Rookie Team 2003 Calder Memorial Trophy 2003\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBiographical information and career statistics from NHL.com, or Eliteprospects.com, or Hockey-Reference.com, or The Internet Hockey Database"
