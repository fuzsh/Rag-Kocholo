He spent four years playing at the University of Michigan, where he earned a degree in Psychology. During his seven-year professional career – which featured three seasons with the Wolves – Vaughan launched businesses in a variety of fields. Those business pursuits continue to be his focus.\n\nBest Book: “Between The World and Me” by Ta-Nehisi Coates\n\nBest Movie: “Finding Forrester”\n\nBest Documentary: “I Am Not Your Negro”\n\nBest person to follow on Instagram: @thefakepan\n\nCharity I recommend: Kids for Camps\n\nFirst time I dealt with prejudice: There has not been a year that I’ve played hockey and not experienced racism. 90% of it was from my own teammates and coaches.\n\nWhat I want folks to know: If you avoid conflict to keep the peace, you start a war inside of yourself.\n\nPlayer Activist: Brandon Pirri\n\nBorn in Toronto, Pirri attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for one year before launching his professional career in the Chicago Blackhawks organization. He joined the Wolves prior to the 2017-18 season and helped the team win two division titles and the 2019 Western Conference championship.\n\nBest Book: “All Are Welcome” by Alexandra Penfold\n\nBest Movie: “Remember The Titans”\n\nBest Documentary: “13th”\n\nBest person to follow on Instagram/Twitter: @ACLU\n\nCharity I recommend: ACLU\n\nWhat I want folks to know: Empathy. “Seek first to understand, then to be understood.”\n\nPlayer Activist: Keegan Kolesar\n\nDrafted by the Columbus Blue Jackets in 2015, this affable Winnipeg native was traded to the Vegas Golden Knights organization in 2017. That enabled him to spend most of the last three seasons with the Chicago Wolves, where he developed into a physical forward known for big goals and big hits.\n\nBest Book: “To Kill a Mockingbird” by Harper Lee\n\nBest Movie: “American History X”\n\nBest Person to follow on Instagram/Twitter: LeBron James (@kingjames)\n\nFirst time I dealt with prejudice: I was at a hockey camp and a white kid called me the N word on the ice and I didn’t know what it meant at the time. Until I asked my dad and he explained everything to me then and there.\n\nWhat I want folks to know: Don’t be afraid to have those awkward conversations with your family and friends. Bring light to these issues and become more educated and involved with these issues in your community.\n\nPlayer Activist: Oscar Dansk\n\nBorn in Stockholm, Sweden, Dansk moved to Minnesota at the age of 13 to further his education and goaltending skills at Shattuck-St. Mary’s. After several years of junior and professional hockey in America and Sweden, Dansk joined the Wolves in 2017. He was the Wolves’ workhorse in goal when the team reached the 2019 Calder Cup Finals.\n\nBest Book: “To Kill a Mockingbird” by Harper Lee\n\nBest Movie: “12 Years A Slave” or the TV series “Roots”\n\nBest Person to follow on Instagram/Twitter: I like following LeBron James and The Rock. They are very influential and good symbols for both athletes and social equality.\n\nWhat I want folks to know: I think it’s great that the Hockey Diversity Alliance was created to give everybody within the hockey community a symbol and leaders to “rally” around and keep this conversation going. My thought is that these strong leaders in the hockey community and every other social circle do a great job of raising this important topic.\n\nFor me, as a white male, I listen and read about their stories because I haven’t been exposed to racism. My parents raised my brothers and I well in what’s right and wrong. We are all part of this world together and love conquers all. I believe that spreading that love is bigger now than ever. As well as keeping the conversation going and educating constantly for us now and the next generations to come.\n\nPlayer Activist: Curtis McKenzie\n\nAfter attending Miami University in Ohio for four years, this British Columbia native launched a long professional career in the Dallas Stars organization.

When he was one, his birth parents gave him up in order for him to find a better life. Eventually, Stan and Tara Loewen visited him in a Jamaican children’s home, adopted him at the age of five and took him home to Manitoba. Jermaine didn’t start playing organized hockey until he was 11, but improved rapidly and in 2018 became the first Jamaican-born player to be selected in the NHL Draft. He joined the Wolves for the 2019-20 season and scored his first AHL goal in front of family and friends in Manitoba.\n\nDocumentary: “13th”\n\nBest person to follow Twitter/Instagram: Malala Yousafzai @malala\n\nCharity I recommend: Advancement Project\n\nFirst time I dealt with prejudice: Happened at a hockey tournament when I was a young kid. It was a lot to take in, but knowing what you stand for — and the people who are close to me — helped me through the difficult time.\n\nWhat I want folks to know: It’s in all of us to help stop social inequality by educating ourselves first, so we can help others out and they don’t have to go through that pain. It’s a long process, but being aware what’s going on will help move things into a positive place for the future.\n\nPlayer Activist: Jordan Schmaltz\n\nSchmaltz grew up in Wisconsin and attended the University of North Dakota for three years.
