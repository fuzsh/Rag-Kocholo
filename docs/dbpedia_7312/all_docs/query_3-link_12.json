Upon arrival, Captain 801 reported that the active pile of garbage was on fire and would need to be extinguished. The active fire was approximately 350ft wide by 100ft tall. Two landfill employees were on scene and told Captain 801 that if the Fire Department could get most of the fire under control that they could cover the pile with dirt. Chief 800 arrived on scene, assumed incident command, and requested that the alarm be upgraded to a 3 rd alarm fire for Tenders, Engines, and Chiefs.\n\nRescue Pumper 810 was the first-in apparatus and was able to use one of the rock roads to nose in near the fire. Engine 802 then completed a reverse lay with 800 feet of 5 inch supply hose back to a wider landfill road where a relay pumping operation was established. The Hillsboro Fire Department Tender was the first to\n\narrive and they assisted by setting up their dump tank next to Engine 802. Hillsboro Chief 614 then assumed water supply command and began to line up all incoming Tenders to prepare for a lengthy Fire Attack.\n\nA Tender refill site was established at the intersection of St. Francis Way and Franciscan Drive by Unit 805 staffed with one Litchfield Firefighter and one retired Litchfield Lieutenant. They reportedly refilled 12Tenders at the refill site.\n\nPersonnel from 5 different departments stretched just over 1000 feet of 2.5 inch hoseline through dark and muddy conditions into position for an attack on the fire. Three portable master stream devices were put into operation and one handline was deployed to the top of the hill above and to the south of the fire. The fire\n\nattack was coordinated by Captain 801. Witt Assistant Chief 322 served as the accountability officer, Carlinville Chief 1290 supervised the staging area, and Raymond Harvel Chief 520 served in a logistics role helping shuttle\n\npeople around the expansive grounds. Once all hose lines and Tenders were in position the fire attack was initiated. Captain 822 and Firefighter 833 executed a seamless drafting/relay pumping operation.\n\nApproximately 35,000 gallons of water was used to extinguish the fire enough to where the landfill personnel could cover the pile with dirt. Chief 800 called a loss stop at 11:52pm.\n\nThe Litchfield Fire Department would like to thank the following agencies for their roles in response to this incident. The Hillsboro Fire Department, Coffeen Fire Department, Witt Fire Department, Fillmore Fire Department, Raymond Harvel Fire Department, Mt. Olive Fire Department, Carlinville Fire Department, Taylor\n\nSprings Fire Department, Shoal Creek Fire Department, Staunton Fire Department, Hillsboro Area Ambulance,Montgomery County Sheriff’s Department, Litchfield Police Department, and Montgomery County EMA.\n\nThe first responders acted quickly and effectively to contain and extinguish the fire at the Envotech Landfill. Their hard work and dedication are commendable, and I am grateful for their professionalism in handling this challenging situation. The Litchfield Fire Department would like to express gratitude to all personnel involved\n\nin the operation including the Envotech Employees who provided great support and insight throughout the incident.\n\nNokomis Sets Oiling and Chipping for Monday (7/22)\n\nThe following roads and streets in Nokomis will be closed for oiling and chipping if weather allows.\n\nStreets to be Oiled weather permmitting July 22, 2024\n\nSheridan St. from Spruce - Pine\n\nHenry St. from Warren- Lincoln\n\nSchool St from Capps- Stevens\n\nDorris from Blue Ave - Singer\n\nOak from RT. 16 - South\n\nWalnut from State St. - South\n\nHickory from RT. 16 - Central\n\nEdwards from Kinney - Bertolino\n\nGriffin from Herman - Bertolino\n\nTruck Strikes Jubelt's\n\nThe Litchfield Fire Department responded to a call reporting a vehicle that struck a building at Jubelt's Bakery and Restaurant. Upon arrival, the fire department found a four-door white Dodge pickup truck partially inside the structure, having struck the southwest corner of the building. The cab of the truck had pierced the wall\n\nand came to rest in the back portion of the structure. Fortunately, the occupant was already out of the vehiclebefore Fire and EMS arrival. He was promptly evaluated and ultimately transported to St. Francis Hospital for further care.\n\nFire personnel worked to isolate the utilities and electrical panel. Two personnel along with the City of Litchfield Builiding Inspector accessed the roof. They made three cuts to the roof of the damaged part of the structure before Brian’s Towing safely removed the truck. The Litchfield Street Department was contacted to\n\nbring fence panels to isolate the area overnight. Four panels were set up to deter anyone from trying to enter the structure. After the scene was secured command was terminated and all units returned to service.\n\nThe Litchfield Fire Department would like to thank all those involved in the quick and efficient response to thisincident and assure the community that the necessary steps have been taken to secure the area for publicsafety.\n\nHSHS/Aetna Standoff Over for Now\n\nAn 11th hour reprieve has been achieved for Aetna customers who use HSHS hospitals, medical group facilities or prairie cardiovascular. — After much negotiation, Hospital Sisters Health System (HSHS) has reached a a tentative agreement with Illinois Aetna and will not terminate service on July 1, 2024.

Here are the details of the earlier fire that drew a large number of departments for mutual aid.\n\nCarlinville Fire Department along with mutual aid resources from\n\nMacoupin, Montgomery and Sangamon Counties are presently engaged in\n\nfire suppression activities at an industrial site north of Carlinville. The\n\naddress of the fire is 14855 University Street.\n\nThe initial call for response was placed to Macoupin County 9-1-1 at 3:55\n\nAM\n\nChief Jess McKee of Carlinville Fire Department established defensive fire\n\noperations and begin requesting mutual aid resources.

Alderman Dan Newkirk’s chair was empty when Mayor Steve Dougherty dropped the gavel to open last night’s meeting. That won’t change as the legendary former Litchfield High coach has decided to step down from his Ward 2 seat. Newkirk joined the board back in May of 2022 to fill the seat vacated by Mark Brown. Newkirk was elected to fill the remaining two years of Brown’s term in last April’s election. Mayor Steve Dougherty will appoint a successor but the City Council would have to confirm the choice. We reached out to former Alderman Newkirk and he is not commenting on his departure at this point."
