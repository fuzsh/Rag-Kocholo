They officially qualified for the playoffs on Saturday, and these last eight games will determine their post-season opponent.\n\nAnother victory also pushes them into sixth place in Canucks history. Two more wins and they’re tied for fourth with the 2002-03 West Coast Express team. The team record is 117 points, set by the 2010-11 Canucks (54-19-9) which featured the Sedin twins, Roberto Luongo, Alain Vigneault and, regrettably, that Stanley Cup Final against the Boston Bruins.\n\nIn honour of the 100 points, the improvement from recent years and the fact sports editor Paul Chapman wanted to keep me busy for a few days so I would stop pestering him with emails, here’s 100 reasons why the Canucks are that much better this season:\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n1\n\nCanucks owner Francesco Aquilini is a popular target when the team struggles. He merits some love for this success. The club hasn’t been shy on spending on hockey operations. It appeared to be running lean, especially when parting with Trevor Linden as president of hockey operations in July 2018 and not immediately bringing someone in to replace him. Jim Rutherford was hired to head up player personnel decisions in December 2021, and the club has been adding to the hockey operations department ever since.\n\n2\n\nRutherford went into Hockey Hall of Fame in the builder category in 2019, having been the architect of Stanley Cup winning teams with both the Carolina Hurricanes (2006) and Pittsburgh Penguins (2016 and 2017). Linden and former general manager Jim Benning were both rookies at their positions when they started in Vancouver. The same can be said for Benning’s predecessor, Mike Gillis.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n3\n\nPatrik Allvin, who was named GM of the Canucks in January 2022, is new to his position, outside of a four-game stint as Penguins GM between the departure of Rutherford and the hiring of Ron Hextall in 2021. Allvin has Rutherford’s trust, from their time with the Penguins. And Allvin has paid his dues. He worked four seasons with Montreal as a scout and then 16 seasons with the Penguins as a scouting director and then assistant general manager.\n\n4\n\nThe NHL dates back to 1917, and in the history of the league there have only been 396 players suit up for 1,000 games. The Canucks regularly put five of those guys on the ice at practice in head coach Rick Tocchet (1,144), assistant coach Adam Foote (1,154), defensive development coach Sergei Gonchar (1,301) and development coaches Daniel (1,306) and Henrik Sedin (1,330). That’s ample been there, done that. “I walk in that room and I get challenged by great hockey minds,” Tocchet said Sunday on TNT.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n5\n\nThe Canucks coaching staff also includes assistant Mike Yeo, who has 542 games of head coaching experience (263-217-62) under his belt from stints with the Minnesota Wild, St. Louis Blues and Philadelphia Flyers.\n\n6\n\nOn TNT on Sunday, Tocchet admitted to picking the brains of Wayne Gretzky, Jon Cooper, Craig Berube and former Canucks coach Travis Green on a regular basis. “There are three or four guys around the league that I bounce ideas off of. It’s a small circle but it’s a circle that helps me out,” he said.\n\n7\n\nFormer Vancouver defenceman Adrian Aucoin has talked about how he could see the Sedins teachings on the team’s offence. “I truly believe they revolutionized the game with time and space and moving gives and goes,” Aucoin said. “You really see it with how the (Canucks) forwards work together. I think everybody coaches that way, but not as detailed (as the Sedins).”\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n8\n\nTo suggest Bruce Boudreau’s firing in January 2023 had been thinly veiled might well prompt a class-action lawsuit from thin veils everywhere. Cutting Boudreau as coach was transparent — Rutherford told a media gathering before it actually happened “I’m not going to go into (coaching) names, but even going back a couple of months, I have called a few people to talk” — but it had fans feeling badly for Boudreau, and overshadowed the fact the team had dropped nine of 10, had given up multi-goal leads in eight losses at that juncture in the season and was 14 points out of a playoff spot when he was let go. Rutherford and Allvin wanting their pick as coach made sense, and there’s history with Tocchet going back to their time together with the Penguins. It’s easier to preach chemistry in the dressing room when the players can see it in the team offices.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n9\n\nFun fact or unity builder? You make the call on Tocchet admitting on TNT on Sunday that he had several dinners after signing on last year with team owner Francesco Aquilini, as part of “trying to pick his brain where he wanted the team to go.”\n\n10\n\nBringing in Tocchet last season also gave him a head start on getting his messaging to the players and creating the culture he wanted for this season. “Coming in better shape, training camp is important, systems stuff, self assessment … I think those guys took that heart and came into camp with those qualities,” Tocchet said recently.\n\n11\n\nTocchet played 18 years in the NHL, was a head coach with Tampa Bay and Arizona and an assistant with the Penguins. Tocchet can also still rattle off the names that coach Terry Crisp gave his drills when Tocchet was playing junior for him with the Soo Greyhounds in the mid-1980s. Says something about the man’s passion for the game. He “worked for everything he got,” according to Crisp.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n12\n\nA Gordie Howe hat trick is when a player has a goal, assist and fight in a game. Tocchet (18) is the NHL’s all-time leader in that category. We’re not sure exactly how that pertains to the Canucks’ success this season. More than anything, we just wanted to slip it into the list. Howe, oddly enough, is credited with just two Gordie Howe hat tricks.\n\n13\n\nTocchet has talked about how important communication with the players is at various points this season and has said the coaches break up the roster regularly to make sure that every player is checked in with. Rutherford has talked about seeing that ability when Tocchet worked in Pittsburgh, because he “takes the time,” and he was “so good with these guys, whether it was the top player or a player that had just come up from the minors.”\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n14\n\nTocchet has his non-negotiables. It’s things like team play and compete level and he doesn’t waver off them one bit. Consider the gifted Andrei Kuzmenko. He had 39 goals last season and signed a two-year extension last January. He could never get in sync with what Tocchet wanted, and this January he was traded to the Calgary Flames in the deal that brought Elias Lindholm to the Canucks.\n\n15\n\nWith Tocchet leading the way, the Canucks have stayed even-keeled. It’s felt like they weren’t getting too ahead of themselves despite success. And this is a team that has qualified for the playoffs just once in eight years.\n\n16\n\nYou routinely hear from Vancouver media folk about how accommodating and forthcoming Tocchet has been with the press. He gets the gig. He was a media guy at TNT. Having that comfort with his media dealings is a positive in a Canadian market. About the only time he’s been cranky with the media came in January, saying his comments about Elias Pettersson after a 4-3 loss to the St. Louis Blues — “I haven’t liked his game the last three or four games. We gotta get him going” — were blown out of proportion. Tocchet said: “Maybe it’s a story that we’re winning a lot and we’re looking for negativity. That’s the way I look at it. Not to blast you guys. It’s just frustrating, because It’s all over the internet about how I was blasting Pettersson. I don’t know how I blasted him. I just said he had a tough night.”\n\nAdvertisement 10\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n17\n\nAllvin hasn’t been nearly as forward facing with the media as Tocchet, but Rutherford says that he’s a great communicator internally. “He wants to work with people and get people’s ideas. He wants to talk to everybody in the organization all the time,” Rutherford said.\n\n18\n\nBenning had been a target for the team’s struggles over the years. We’ll credit him here, too. The core group of Pettersson, centre J.T. Miller, defenceman Quinn Hughes, winger Brock Boeser and goaltender Thatcher Demko were all acquired with Benning at the controls.\n\n19\n\nThe Canucks took Pettersson No. 5 overall at the 2017 NHL Draft. Linden told Sportsnet 650 in November that it was then-director of amateur scouting Judd Brackett who spearheaded the pick. “Jim wasn’t sold,” Linden said. Benning balked at Linden’s comments to Hockey Night in Canada: Punjabi analyst Raja Shergill. Speculation has been that Benning was keen on picking Portland Winterhawks centre Cody Glass. He’s been playing bottom-six minutes with the Nashville Predators this season.\n\nAdvertisement 11\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n20\n\nThe Canucks took Hughes at No. 7 overall in the 2018 Draft. They didn’t expect the University of Michigan product to be available, with the Detroit Red Wings picking at No. 6. The Red Wings instead selected Filip Zadina, a Czech winger who was playing with the Halifax Mooseheads. Zadina never panned out in Detroit and player and team mutually agreed to terminate his contract last July with two years remaining on it. He’s playing bottom-six minutes this year with the San Jose Sharks.\n\n21\n\nOn the 2019 NHL Draft floor, there was considerable talk about the Canucks possible adding defenceman Tyson Barrie in a deal with the Colorado Avalanche. That swap didn’t happen and Vancouver instead shipped a 2020 first-round pick, a 2019 third rounder and minor league goalie Marek Mazanec to Tampa Bay for Miller. It’s hard to fathom that Vancouver gets this far, this fast with the Barrie deal replacing the Miller one.\n\nAdvertisement 12\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n22\n\nBoth Miller and centre Bo Horvat had contracts coming due at the end of 2022-23 and the salary cap disarray over the years made it likely that Vancouver could only sign one of the pair to an extension. Horvat, who was team captain and had been career-long Canuck, seemed to be the odds-on favourite to get the deal, but Allvin inked Miller to a seven-year contract with an $8 million cap hit in September, 2022. Horvat was traded in January 2023 to the New York Islanders and he agreed to an eight-year deal there with a cap hit of $8.5 million. If you can only have one, there’s plenty of ammo that the Canucks picked the right one.\n\n23\n\nIt felt for a time that Miller wore the black hat with a chunk of the fan base. It’s not that case any longer. Fans were chanting his name during a 4-2 win over Calgary on March 23. “I never thought I’d be in a situation where that was possible,” Miller admitted. “It’s a passionate fan base.”\n\nAdvertisement 13\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n24\n\nWhat makes Miller so good? According Tocchet, “he takes it personal if he’s not driving play. … Millsie will tell you after a game is over he doesn’t feel he played well and that means he didn’t drive play. And I like that attitude.”\n\n25\n\nThere was a time as 2020-21 was coming to a close that it looked like the Canucks might lose goalie coach Ian Clark. Clark’s contract was up, and the buzz around the team was that he was going to look at options elsewhere. Demko told the media then: “The way he’s guided me and mentored me, it’s been amazing. I desperately hope that they can figure something out and have him return.” Coincidence or not, Clark signed a five-year extension in June, matching the five-year deal with Demko signed in March.\n\nAdvertisement 14\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n26\n\nRemember when the Canucks were on the verge of trading Boeser? And the same with the Conor Garland? Seems silly now. Hard to imagine this year’s team is better if either of those deals happened.\n\n27\n\nGarland has said that Tocchet has helped guide him through trade speculation. “He tried to block out the noise and keep me day to day. Those first six games were pretty tough on me, especially that first road trip. Any time I was in a tough spot, I could lean on him and guys in the room to understand the situation I was in.”\n\n28\n\nSpeaking of trades, the rumours of the Canucks talking with the Hurricanes regarding Pettersson in early January and Pettersson signing an eight-year extension with an $11.6 million cap hit per season soon after may have been coincidental. Or maybe not. Either way, Rutherford and Allvin getting a deal done with one of their core players ahead of the trade deadline gave them clarity about both their immediate and long-term future. Pettersson had said all along that he wanted to wait until the season was over.\n\nAdvertisement 15\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n29\n\nTocchet has brought more structure and attention to detail than Boudreau, who favoured a free-wheeling style. Vancouver’s goals against per game heading into Sunday was 2.64 after being 3.61 last year, and their shots against per game was 28.8 after being 30.8 a season ago. The goals against per game is the lowest its been since 2.40 in 2012-13. The 2010-11 team was 2.20.\n\n30\n\nAllvin rebuilt the defence, which obviously has resulted in the improved play in the Canucks’ zone. Five of the seven regulars on the blue line are in their first full seasons with Vancouver. Vancouver made smart plays rather than bold, flashy ones in free agency, bringing in the likes of Carson Soucy and Ian Cole.\n\n31\n\nThe Canucks finished last in the NHL on the penalty kill (71.6 per cent) last season. They were 19th (79.4 per cent) going into Sunday. What does that mean? They had given up 46 power-play goals through 73 games this season, compared to 69 in the 82-game campaign last year.\n\nAdvertisement 16\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n32\n\nAllvin rebuilt the penalty kill group as well. Three of the top four guys (Cole, Filip Hronek and Teddy Blueger, along with Tyler Myers) in penalty kill ice time on the season as of Sunday were in their first full season with Vancouver.\n\n33\n\nThe Canucks buying out defenceman Oliver Ekman-Larsson last June for $19.3 million opened up $7.1 million of cap space for the team this season. That goes down to $4.8 million the following season, and he’s on the books with Vancouver through 2030-31. With the salary cap expected to rise, it shouldn’t be as painful as the Roberto Luongo cap recapture was for the club.\n\n34\n\nThe Canucks’ power play has been so streaky that contrasting stats are popping up all over. Here’s one: Vancouver’s man advantage unit was working at 13.8 per cent through the first 11 games in March after connecting at 33 per cent during a streak from mid-October to mid-December. Here’s another: it was good on 25 per cent of opportunities leading to the All-Star break and working at 14.5 per cent since then going into this weekend. Figuring out how to score again with the extra man will be paramount to whatever playoff success they have. And they have the pieces to make it work.\n\nAdvertisement 17\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n35\n\nVancouver is ninth in the NHL in face-off winning per cent (52 per cent). They were 18th last year (49.5 per cent).\n\n36\n\nVancouver entered Sunday fifth in the NHL in hits per 60 minutes (25.35). Thats up from eighth (24.33) last year and 14th (22.89) in 2021-22.\n\n37\n\nThe Canuck have been a strong starting team all season. Going into Sunday, they scored the most first-period goals (87) in the league and have given up the fourth-least (49). They were also tops in wins when scoring first (35).\n\n38\n\nThe Canucks have only had 20 seasons since 2000-01 where a player has scored 80 or more points. As of Sunday, three of them have come this year with Miller (35-57-92), Pettersson (33-51-84) and Hughes (13-68-81). The Canucks have 252 goals as of Sunday, which is their sixth-best total since that 2000-01 campaign.\n\nAdvertisement 18\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n39\n\nMiller had 99 points with Vancouver in 2021-22. He’s one of just four Canucks — Pavel Bure, Henrik Sedin and Markus Naslund were the first three — to record multiple 90-point seasons. Pettersson could also join that group.\n\n40\n\nAs Cody Severtson of Canucks Army pointed out on X — formerly Twitter — on Sunday, the Canucks top scorers the last time they were a 100-point squad in 2014-15 were Daniel Sedin (20-56-76), Henrik Sedin (18-55-73), Radim Vrbata (31-32-63), Nick Bonino (15-24-39) and Chris Higgins (12-24-36). You have to like this year’s team more.\n\n41\n\nThe Demko injury remains prevalent currently, but the Canucks have been relatively healthy this season. The NHLInjuryViz web site had them last week at 194 man-games lost at a cap-hit of $6.0 million for their injured players through March 29. The Vegas Golden Knights, for comparison, were at 427 man-games lost at a cap hit of $19.7 million.\n\nAdvertisement 19\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n42\n\nThe Canucks moved their farm team from Utica, N.Y., to Abbotsford ahead of the 2021-22 season. Putting the team somewhere in that gaggle of California AHL teams would mean less travel, more practice time and probably cheaper operations. Among the pluses in the move is that there’s more direct access between the Canucks and their main farm team. For instance, it allows development coaches like the Sedins to travel back and forth between the two teams on a more regular basis.\n\n43\n\nMaybe it’s that change in locale. Or maybe it’s the new leadership. Most likely, it’s a little of Column A and a little of Column B that has the Canucks developing players at the minor league level better than they have in recent memory. Nils Hoglander tops that list. He spent much of last year in Abby rebuilding his game after two full seasons in Vancouver. He’s back up with the Canucks this season, has won the trust of Tocchet as a more complete player and had 22 goals for Vancouver as of Sunday to boot. The Canuck say they have had a similar plan for fellow winger Vasili Podkolzin this year. Giving prospects time to marinate is something you see good teams do.\n\nAdvertisement 20\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n44\n\nHoglander admitted in October that getting sent down was tough to stomach but “at some point, you just have to realize to make the best of the situation and trust that they sent you down to get better.” Abbotsford head coach Jeremy Colliton said then that Hoglander worked on several aspects, including his “awareness defensively,” and “understanding where you can attack or something off the rush, or make something happen.”\n\n45\n\nHoglander’s development is a good story for Canucks brass to share with young prospects. Arshdeep Bains’ progress is another. Bains signed with the Canucks as an undrafted free agent in the midst of leading the WHL in scoring with the Red Deer Rebels during his 20-year-old season in 2021-22. He worked on becoming a more dependable two-way player and he made the AHL All-Star game this year and got promoted from Abby to Vancouver for the first time in February. “I ask our guys all the time: Do you want to be a 10-year, 70-point guy in the American League? I can find you all sorts of those guys. Do you want to play in the NHL? That’s the question. Bainsie is somebody who has taken it personally. He doesn’t want to be a lifer in the AHL. He wants to play in the NHL and he’s doing the things to give himself a chance to do it,” said Abby general manager Ryan Johnson.\n\nAdvertisement 21\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n46\n\nJohnson became the proud holder of dual job titles in March when the Canucks added Vancouver assistant GM to his Abby GM duties. The club announced that he had signed an extension that day as well, but didn’t give out any more details than that. A centre for 13 seasons in the NHL, Johnson joined the Canucks staff as a player development consultant in 2013 and has climbed his way up. He’s the first point of contact for many new players to the organization. He’s key to the messaging.\n\n47\n\nThe Canucks also extended assistant general managers Cammi Granato and Emilie Castonguay at the same time they added to Johnson’s job description. Rutherford and Allvin both signed three-year extensions in January. “Having a strong, intelligent and diverse leadership team sets us up nicely for future success,” Allvin said.\n\nAdvertisement 22\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n48\n\nThe Canucks brought in Colliton to guide Abby ahead of last season. He’s a guy with three seasons of NHL head coaching experience already with the Blackhawks. “Very smart hockey mind. A fantastic way of communicating with players and the steps they have to take,” Johnson said.\n\n49\n\nMuch has been made about Hughes and his scoring exploits. Heading into Sunday, he had already bettered his team record for points by a defenceman (81) and he’s set a career high for goals (13). Hronek’s production has slowed in the second half, but his totals going into Sunday (5-40-45) marked the most points by a Canucks defenceman not named Quinn Hughes since Alexander Edler hit 49 in 2011-12.\n\n50\n\nHughes was a plus-39 going into Sunday. The team record is plus-36, set by defenceman Christian Ehrhoff and winger Daniel Sedin in 2009-10. Hronek’s plus-33 going into Sunday was sitting at No. 10 on the Canucks’ list.\n\nAdvertisement 23\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n51\n\nHughes went into the season looking to be more dangerous with his shot. His career high in goals had been eight, set in his 2019-20 rookie season and then equalled again 2021-222. He had seven last season. He’s at a career high 173 shots already. He’s previous best was 154, setting in 78 games in last year.\n\n52\n\nHughes was named captain in September, dethroning Ottawa winger Brady Tkachuk as youngest captain in the league. Hughes, 24, hasn’t seemed to be fazed by any of the added responsibility. “This means a great deal to me, especially in a Canadian market,” Hughes said upon getting the ‘C’. “I know how important hockey is to the city, and to be the captain is an incredible honour and something I never even dreamed of. I’m never going to be the loudest guy in the room, but a guy who can be a leader through work ethic.”\n\nAdvertisement 24\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n53\n\nBoeser pledged at training camp in 2022 he was going to score 30 goals. He broke his hand at camp and his season unravelled. This year? “I think you know I’m not gonna sit here and promise you anything anymore,” he said at camp. “I just got to take it day by day and prove myself, to not just you guys, but to my teammates and the city.” Boeser did find a new trainer and worked out differently in the offseason.\n\n54\n\nAllvin talked in June about how the team felt Boeser’s play had taken a step with the change to Tocchet from Boudreau.”There was definitely a significant improvement in Brock’s game and how we played. He definitely made it clear to myself and the coaching staff that he was excited about the vision and the path of this team and wanted to make sure that from his standpoint that he wanted to be part of it,” Allvin said.\n\nAdvertisement 25\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n55\n\nProof Boeser has added to his game? He had 37 goals going into Sunday and eight goals had come via tip-in. He has 20 tip-in goals for the 176 goals on his career. Going into Sunday, Boeser’s tip-in tally was tied with four other players for third highest in the league this season, behind Chris Kreider (12) and Mikko Rantanen (10). Going into Sunday, the Canucks lead the NHL in tip-in goals (38), followed by the Pittsburgh Penguins (32). The Canucks led the league last season with 50, behind 14 from Kuzmenko. Boeser had five.\n\n56\n\nThe Canucks’ third line of Garland, Blueger and Dakota Joshua had been so good at setting a tone and controlling play for extended stretches that there had been a push from media and fans to give them a name. Garland balked at giving the trio a monicker back in January. “We don’t need a name. We’re a third line. We’re a hard line to play against that just tries to chip in,” said Garland. “You score three goals a game and then you can start having a name. We’re not getting there. We’ll just stick with being the third line.”\n\nAdvertisement 26\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n57\n\nJoshua has been so good this season that it’s easy to forget that Tocchet called him out publicly in training camp. He missed six weeks with a broken hand but he’s back now in time for the final few games of the regular season. Joshua is in the final year of a two-year deal that has him at a cap hit of $825,000. He’s an unrestricted free agent at season’s end.\n\n58\n\nIt’s easy to forget now, but the Canucks lost a preseason game 10-0 to the Calgary Flames on Sept. 24. We’ll never know for certain what it meant internally to the club but it’s easy to wonder. “Listen, we were disorganized. Guys tried hard. I’m going to tell you that right now, they worked hard. They looked a little bit disorganized because they were trying too hard,” Tocchet explained to the media later that week.\n\n59\n\nThe Canucks opened the season with an 8-1 win over the Edmonton Oilers on Oct. 11, and then proceeded to beat the Oilers 4-3 in their home opener on Oct. 14. That had to create some belief in the dressing room.\n\n60\n\nBack-up netminder Casey DeSmith afforded the Canucks the ability to rest Demko. They landed him in a September trade with Montreal, with Tanner Pearson and a 2025 third-round pick going the other way. DeSmith was 11-7-6, with a 2.71 goals against average and a .901 save percentage, going into Sunday. In the past five full seasons — leave out the two campaigns affected by the COVID pandemic — Vancouver’s main backup netminders have averaged seven wins a year.\n\n61\n\nThe Canucks dropped a 4-3 road decision to Tampa Bay on Oct. 19, moving to 2-2-0 on the season. Miller had a goal and an assist against his former club. “Loved the battle, hats off to the guys because they competed,” Tocchet said. “We’ve just got to clean up the crucial mistakes. … For the overall team effort, the guys played hard until the end.”\n\n62\n\nVancouver beat the Florida Panthers on the road Oct. 21, ending the losing streak at two games. DeSmith had 34 saves. Vancouver’s ability to bounce back from loses and poor outings has been a familiar theme this season.\n\n63\n\nDefenceman Jack Rathbone, who had been considered a top Canuck prospect at one point, was dealt Oct. 17 to the Penguins in a 2-for-2 swap that brought defenceman Mark Friedman to the Canucks. Friedman, a stay-at-home type, has gotten into 21 games with the big club this season. Puck-mover Rathbone, 24, has remained with the Penguins’ AHL team. It says something about the Canucks’ improved prospect pool that they were willing to move Rathbone.\n\n64\n\nMiller was benched by Tocchet after taking a retaliatory high stick penalty against Nashville in a 5-2 win at home on Oct. 31. It was Miller’s third penalty of the night. It was Vancouver’s ninth game of the season and you can bet it was a statement for the entire roster, as much as it was for Miller specifically. Miller played 13:02, which remains a season low in ice time for him this season. “He’s fine. He came up and apologized to me and I apologized to him. I love the kid. I have no problems with J.T. Miller,” Tocchet told the media afterwards. “He’s an emotional leader for this team and we’re a quiet team. We give him crap sometimes because he’s got to draw the emotion for a lot of guys. Sometimes, he’ll go over an edge and he got back. I have no problems with his emotions.”\n\n65\n\nThe Nashville game was followed by a 10-1 win over the San Jose Sharks two days later. That was the start of a five-game win streak for Vancouver.\n\n66\n\nThe Canucks’ streak came to an abrupt end with a 5-2 road loss to Toronto on Nov. 11. Tocchet was his even-keeled, big-picture self afterwards: “I thought the last few games there’s pockets of the game where I think teams are outworking us. We’ve got to play desperate hockey, too. You have to match the level of your opponent, it’s 82 games. There’s some stinkers and sometimes you learn from a stinker.” The Canuck did win the next night in Montreal, beating the Canadiens 5-2.\n\n67\n\nThe Canucks edged the Islanders 4-3 in overtime on Nov. 15 at home, with Hughes bagging the winner on a set-up by Miller. Vancouver moved to 12-3-1 on the season on what was a hyped-up night at Rogers Arena. Horvat scored for the Islanders and received a standing ovation from fans and players on both benches following a video tribute at 6:11 of the first period. “It definitely felt good, I’m not going to lie,” Horvat said.\n\n68\n\nVancouver was on the wrong end of another statement game on Nov. 22, falling 5-2 in Denver to the Colorado Avalanche. “I think we played all right,” Hughes said. “We did some good things tonight, but I think they just capitalized a little bit more on their looks in the third. We had our looks as well, but sometimes you’re just going to lose a close game. That’s what happened.”\n\n69\n\nKuzmenko coming under fire from Tocchet first came to the fore on Nov. 24, when he told reporters after practice that “I think Kuzy needs a reset,” and that “Kuzy’s got to start playing a little harder.”\n\n70\n\nThe Canucks traded Anthony Beauvillier and the $4.15 million cap hit on his expiring contact to the Chicago Blackhawks for a 2024 fifth-round pick on Nov. 28. Two days later they brought in defenceman Nikita Zadorov and the $3.75 million cap hit on his expiring deal from the Calgary Flames, sending that fifth rounder from Chicago and a 2026 third rounder to the Flames. It was a tidy piece of business from Allvin, making Vancouver a more difficult team to play in the process.\n\n71\n\nThe 6-foot-6, 248-pound Zadorov adds to Vancouver’s physical game. He was sixth on the Canucks in hits (103) going into Sunday despite playing just 46 games. “I love it when people hate to play against me,” Zadorov told reporters a few days into his Canucks tenure. “It’s something I’ve developed throughout my career and it’s kind of like playing with the fish. You open some space for the forwards and they think it’s open and you just close it at the last second.”\n\n72\n\nAllvin believed that Vancouver’s depth at forward allowed them to make the Beauvillier deal. Forward Linus Karlsson was called up from Abbotsford right after the trade. “We’re fortunate to have Abbotsford down the road and that they are playing really well and a lot of players have been taking steps,” Allvin said.\n\n73\n\nThe trade with Chicago was announced on the same day that the Blackhawks were cutting ties with forward Corey Perry for conduct off the ice. Allvin wasn’t about to offer up a timeline on how the deal with Chicago came together. “You’re always talking to teams and see what’s available and what teams are looking for. And where our needs are. So sometimes it takes longer and sometimes it goes quicker,” he said. Regardless, it felt like Allvin was ready to react to a situation quickly.\n\n74\n\nThe New Jersey Devils blew a three-goal lead in the third period but got a goal from Jesper Bratt with 34 seconds remaining to beat the Canucks 6-5 at Rogers Arena on Dec. 5. It was another learning moment for the Canuck crew. “We felt confident the whole game that we were going to have chances to tie it up,” Hughes said. “We can’t hang our hat on that. We have to find a way to get that one to [overtime]. It’s terrible to lose a game like that.”\n\n75\n\nVancouver bounced back from that loss to the Devils, reeling off four straight wins at home, including beating the Carolina 4-3 on Dec. 9, Tampa Bay 4-1 on Dec. 12 and Florida 4-0 on Dec. 14.\n\n76\n\nDemko recorded a 36-save shutout against the Panthers on what was Roberto Luongo Ring of Honour Night at Rogers Arena. Whether Luongo’s career with Vancouver merited having his No. 1 jersey raised to the rafters is a delicious debate for another time. Our point here is that it was a big evening in the team’s season. The Canucks do top-flight special ceremony nights, and they had Sedins and Cory Schneider welcome Luongo and his family to the ice, and Luongo won over the crowd with his speech. They even had Demko and Florida goalie Sergei Bobrovsky take the ceremonial face-off.\n\n77\n\nJoshua had two goals in that Florida game and that started a run of five goals in six games and nine points in nine games. Joshua’s take? “I just want to keep going about my job and try to keep making things happen and not get caught up in what’s going on,” he said.\n\n78\n\nInjuries to free-agent addition Soucy allowed Noah Juulsen to prove his worth at the NHL level. By the middle of December, he was the leading Vancouver defenceman with 55 hits and 29 blocks. He’s another guy who’s developed in Abby; he had played 109 games in the AHL and 20 in the NHL in the two seasons leading into this one. He’s was up to 52 games with the big club this year going into Sunday.\n\n79\n\nRutherford was asked in mid-December about whether he was concerned about Pettersson re-signing and said: “I haven’t heard anything yet to have any reason to be concerned. I think that he can be in the in the top five players in this league. He has the ability to do that. There’s no urgency here.”\n\n80\n\nThe Maple Leafs signed forward William Nylander to an eight-year extension on Jan. 8 with a cap hit of $11.5 million. That was a logical comparison to Pettersson’s situation with Vancouver and Boudreau spoke about it that week, saying his former club re-signing Pettersson was imperative because “if you have him and J.T. for a minimum of the next six years as your No. 1 and No. 2 centres, you’re pretty well established with two of the best in the league.” He also went on to say “Pettersson is a stubborn guy just like Nylander is. He knows what he’s worth, and Petey knows what he’s worth and isn’t going to back down.”\n\n81\n\nSoucy, who hadn’t played since Nov. 12 due to an ankle fracture, got back in the line-up Jan. 6 in New Jersey. It was the second game of a seven-game road trip, and Vancouver wound up going 5-1-1. He was a key add for Vancouver, brought in to help shore up the defensive zone and the penalty kill.\n\n82\n\nPettersson scored the game winner In four straight games on that trip. He couldn’t pull off five — Sam Lafferty had the game’s lone goal in a 1-0 triumph in Buffalo on Jan. 13. A Pettersson winner that night would have tied Newsy Lalonde’s 1921 NHL record with Montreal. Daniel Alfredsson also counted four winners in a row for the Ottawa Senators in 2007. Pettersson has 10 game winners on the season going into Sunday, which ties him for the league lead. The Canucks franchise record is 12, set by Markus Naslund in 2002-03.\n\n83\n\nThe Lotto Line — Boeser (No. 6), Pettersson (No. 40) and Miller (No. 9) — combined for 15 goals and 30 points in the last six games of that trip. Tocchet split them up on the home stand that followed. They were outshot 18-4 at five-on-five over a three-game span during that turn. Tocchet was asked about putting them back together in March. “That’s not the secret sauce. No, I don’t believe that,” Tocchet said. “Good question, though. I put those guys together once in a while, but we got enough people here to turn to turn the tide.”\n\n84\n\nVancouver saw its five-game winning streak come to an end with a 4-3 shootout loss in Columbus on Jan. 15, but Miller bagged his 20th of the season and joined Boeser (27) and Pettersson (23) to tie the Avalanche as the only team with three 20-goal men by that point in the season.\n\n85\n\nRutherford signed his three-year extension on Jan. 19, and admitted then that Aquilini “didn’t put any sugar on what he told me what the challenges were going to be there,” when Aquilini first sought out Rutherford to come run the Canucks hockey operations in 2021. “And all those challenges that he told me were here, they’re still here,” Rutherford continued. “Even as the team gets better, and even if the team can have success over a few years, you’re always going to have challenges, and that’s really what my life’s been all about. I’ve dealt with challenges over and over. That’s what drives me.”\n\n86\n\nAlso on Jan. 19, Tocchet was very clear and public that he wasn’t pleased with Kuzmenko’s play, saying after practice that “I’m not trying to make him a Selke winner,” which goes to the NHL’s best defensive forward. He added that “I think there’s certain parts of your game you have to be there for us.”\n\n87\n\nVancouver moved to 7-0-1 in their past eight and 31-11-4 on the season when they defeated the Maple Leafs 6-4 at Rogers Arena on Jan. 20. Eight different Canuck forwards had points, led by two-goal efforts from Garland and Hoglander. Hughes had three assists. Demko made 42 saves. It was one of the more complete wins of the season.\n\n88\n\nRutherford has a history of making marquee additions well ahead of the trade deadline, and the Canucks kept with that this time around, adding forward Lindholm from the Calgary Flames for Kuzmenko, Vancouver’s first-round pick in this summer’s NHL Draft, a conditional fourth rounder and defence prospects Joni Jurmo and Hunter Brzustewicz on Jan. 31. The trade deadline was March 8. Lindholm was a 42-goal scorer in 2021-22, but he’s known for his two-way game. Lindholm, 29, is in a pending unrestricted free agent with a cap hit of $4.85 million\n\n89\n\nThe Canucks landed Lindholm, who was scheduled to represent Calgary at the all-star game in Toronto on Feb. 3, without giving up their top prospect Jonathan Lekkerimäki, 19, who was the most valuable player of the world juniors after helping the Swedes to second spot. They also hung on to defencemen Elias Pettersson, 20, and Tom Willander, 19, who were world junior teammates of Lekkerimaki.\n\n90\n\nHughes was one of the initial 32 players picked to the All-Star game. He was joined by Lindholm, as well as Miller, Pettersson, Boeser and Demko, who were all picked in a fan vote. Tocchet was also named to the game.\n\n91\n\nThe Canucks became the last NHL team to lose three or more games in a row in the season when they dropped four straight from Feb. 17 to Feb. 22.\n\n92\n\nThe Canucks ended their four-game slide by beating the Bruins 3-2 in overtime at Rogers Arena on Feb. 24. They scored twice in the third to set up the OT, and then got the winner from Boeser. “Our bench was pretty calm in the sense that we weren’t panicking. I like that,” Tocchet said. “The last three, four games, the bench would have been a little different, see a little bit of frustration, slamming and sticks and stuff. I didn’t see that tonight.” The Canucks still finish the month 5-6-2, compared to their 10-1-1 mark in January.\n\n93\n\nThe Canucks signed Pettersson to an eight-year, $92.8 million contract on March 2, keeping him from going to restricted free agency at the end of the season. The cap hit is $11.6 per season. While predictions had Pettersson’s cap hit on a new deal with Vancouver being north of $12 million, there are only four players with a bigger cap hit this year than his new deal: Nathan MacKinnon ($12.6), Connor McDavid ($12.5), Artemi Panarin ($11.642) and Auston Matthews ($11.640). It’s the richest contract in team history, rocketing pass the former best of 12 years, $64 million set by Luongo in 2009, and comes due after the 2031-32, when Pettersson will be 33 years old.\n\n94\n\nAlong with having Pettersson locked in long term, Vancouver also has Miller on the books until 2029-30, Hughes until 2026-27 and Demko until 2025-26. Boeser becomes a free agent after the 2024-25.\n\n95\n\nIn regards to signing the deal, Pettersson said: “I always wanted to play for a good team and I wanted to see where this team was heading and ever since Jim and Patrik have come in, obviously getting to know them and seeing the direction we’re going in as an organization, I’ve liked everything I’ve seen.” Allvin added: “This shows the commitment from the Aquilini family and the organization to build a championship team here in Vancouver.”\n\n96\n\nSoucy returned to the line-up on March 5 for a road game in Los Angeles after missing 17 games with a hand injury. He’s at 31 games on the season as of Sunday. Soucy played 78 games last year with the Seattle Kraken.\n\n97\n\nMiller scored the winner that night against the Kings, blasting one home at the 1:36 mark of overtime in a 2-1 triumph. It was his ninth OT tally with Vancouver, tying him with Brendan Morrison for second all-time. Daniel Sedin leads with 16.\n\n98\n\nThe Canucks blanked the Winnipeg Jets 5-0 at home on March 9 for their fourth straight win. That was also the game that Demko left during the second period with an apparent knee injury.\n\n99\n\nThe Canucks clinched a playoff spot Saturday with a St. Lous Blues 4-0 loss to the San Jose Sharks. It’s the first time they’ve advanced to the playoffs since the 2019-20 COVID-19 bubble season. The last time they advanced in a full season was 2014-15.\n\n100\n\nWe offer up this Rutherford quote from September: “I think to be very to the point, the changes that we’ve made, we have a playoff team if everything goes right. Your goalie has to be good. Your specialty teams have to be good. You can’t get into a lot of injuries. OK, now I’m not saying if one of those things go wrong, we can’t still make it. Because we have some impact players that can win games by themselves. But we want to get to a point that we have enough in our lineup, that you can have a few things go wrong on a regular basis and overcome that.”\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\n'Proud of the guys': Canucks clinching first playoff spot in four years was a journey of collective belief\n\nCanucks prospects: Super Swedes make AHL debuts, Willander headed to Frozen Four\n\nBookmark our website and support our journalism: Don’t miss the news you need to know — add VancouverSun.com and TheProvince.com to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here.\n\nYou can also support our journalism by becoming a digital subscriber: For just $14 a month, you can get unlimited access to The Vancouver Sun, The Province, National Post and 13 other Canadian news sites.
