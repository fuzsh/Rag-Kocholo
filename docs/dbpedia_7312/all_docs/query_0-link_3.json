        "text": "Oct. 4, 2016 Jackman announced his retirement from the NHL on Tuesday after signing a one-day contract with the Blues. Selected by St. Louis with the 17th overall pick of the 1999 draft, Jackman made an immediate impact by winning the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year in 2003. He is only member of the Blues to claim the award. Jackman collected 28 goals, 153 assists and 1,026 penalty minutes in 803 regular-season games with St. Louis. The 35-year-old British Columbia native joined Hall of Famer Bernie Federko as the lone Blues' players to appear in 13 seasons with the organization. June 30, 2016 The Predators placed Jackman on waivers Thursday for the purpose of buying out his contract. Jackman had one goal and four assists in 73 games for Nashville last season after spending his first 13 seasons with the Blues."
