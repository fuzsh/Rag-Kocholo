        "text": "Ray Bennett has been an assistant coach in the National Hockey League for close to 12 years and loves it as much today as the day he first joined the Los Angeles Kings in 1999.\n\n“Absolutely I love what I’m doing,” said the St. Louis Blues assistant coach while in Red Deer as the keynote speaker for the Community Sports Awards banquet at the Capri Centre. “It’s also an interesting time to be in the NHL. In the 12 years I’ve been in it it’s changed significantly, but it’s still a lot of fun . . . hockey is hockey.”\n\nBennett, who grew up in Innisfail and graduated from the University of Alberta, has seen a lot of change since first becoming involved in the game some 27 years ago. He was an assistant coach with the RDC Kings under Mike Babcock and later was the head coach of the Kings for one season. He also was an assistant with Babcock with the Moose Jaw Warriors and Spokane Chiefs of the Western Hockey League. He was manager of high performance/video for the Canadian Hockey Association and the National team and was an assistant for the National women’s team, who won silver at the 1998 Olympics and gold in the 1999 world championships.\n\nHe also did video for the silver medalist national junior team at the 1999 World Junior Championships.\n\nBennett also was with the organizing committee for the 1995 Red Deer World Junior Championships and later worked with Hockey Alberta and Hockey Canada.\n\nHe was with Hockey Canada in Calgary when he met Andy Murray, who took Bennett with him as video coach when he got the head coaching position with the LA Kings. He spent close to eight seasons with the Kings working his way up the ladder.\n\n“My job has changed a fair amount over the years,” explained Bennett. “I went there as the video coach with the idea of moving up. I enjoyed the video part, and there was nothing wrong with it, but I wanted to continue to expand my horizons. I still watch a ton of tape (with the Blues), but I work mostly with five-on-five and power play stuff.”\n\nBennett stayed with Murray during his time in Los Angeles, but it eventually came to an end in following the 2005-06 season. Murray was let go late in the season and was replaced on an interim basis by John Torchetti. Following the season the complete coaching staff, including Bennett and former Red Deer Rebels goaltender coach Andy Nowicki, was let go.\n\nBennett was out of a job, but not for long. Murray was hired as the St. Louis Blues head coach on Dec. 11 of 2006 and two days later Bennett was hired as an assistant.\n\n“When he got the job in St. Louis we talked and he brought me along at an increased role,” explained Bennett. “He knew I wanted to do more.”\n\nThe St. Louis job was perfect, although Bennett did have “a couple of other things” on the back burner.\n\n“I interviewed with Toronto although they weren’t sure where they were going and there were some other things not associated with the NHL. But that’s where I wanted to stay. I wanted to stay in the best league in the world and see where it would take me and Andy was good enough to give me a job.”\n\nMurray’s job lasted about four years before he was dismissed and replaced by Davis Payne on Jan. 2, 2010. It came as complete shock to all concerned.\n\n“It was one of those things when I got to work in the morning Andy was there putting on his track suit ready to do when he got a call to go upstairs. He came back and said they wanted to make changes, but they wanted me to stay. They came down a while later and told me Andy was leaving and the new guy was coming in but they wanted me. It was a tough day, but at the same time I enjoy working with Davis and it’s my job to keep going and doing the job.”\n\nBennett isn’t sure what the future holds, but would like to be a head coach down the road.\n\n“If it’s in the NHL I’m not sure that will be, but possibly somewhere like college or junior. Whatever, it’s something I’d like to do.”\n\nBennett enjoyed returning home last weekend, however brief a time it was. He mentioned he enjoyed the opportunity to look back.\n\n“Looking back is tremendously positive,” he said. “I look back at all the experience I had and just seeing Mike (Babcock) grow as a coach and seeing how intense, how focused and how driven he was and seeing what he has done now is tremendous. It was the same with Andy.\n\n“But sometime you don’t take time to look at all those experiences and what’s going on you. You don’t take the time, you’re just trying to stay in the job and stay in the moment,” he said.\n\nWhat he would like is to spend a little more time helping with the resurrection of the Kings hockey program.\n\n“They’ve talked with me about it and asked me to sit and talk about it and I’d love to, but it just hasn’t worked out,” he said. “I played golf with the president (Joel (Ward) and (RDC’s vice president of community relations) Michael Donlevy and I said I’d do whatever I can, it a matter of finding the time.\n\n“I really believe it’s something that’s critical for the college and the city. I felt that way when the program went away and I feel that way now.”\n\ndrode@www.reddeeradvocate.com"
