Although shows early in the tour featured a setlist with \"Cygnus X-1\" preceding \"Something For Nothing\", eventually those songs traded places and the setlist was standardized for the rest of the tour except for when \"Anthem\" was occasionally dropped. \"Lakeside Park\" would not be heard again until the R40 tour 37 years later, while \"Fly By Night\" would be retired permanently:\n\n\"I know ['Fly By Night'] is well-loved now, but it's always been one of my least favourite Rush songs. It sounds kinda dinky to me! The first time I heard it on the radio I went, 'Ugh.' To my taste there was something too sugary, too corny about the chorus. I must have liked it somewhat when we finished it, or it wouldnât have made the record, but itâs never wrapped its arms around me.\" - Geddy Lee, My Effin' Life\n\nBastille Day\n\nLakeside Park\n\nBy-Tor and the Snow Dog (abbreviated)->\n\nXanadu\n\nA Farewell to Kings\n\nSomething For Nothing\n\nCygnus X-1\n\nAnthem\n\nCloser To The Heart\n\n2112 (minus Oracle)\n\nWorking Man\n\nFly by Night\n\nIn The Mood\n\nDrum Solo\n\nEncore: Cinderella Man\n\nHemispheres (Tour of the Hemispheres)\n\nOpening Bands: Max Webster, Ambrosia, April Wine, Golden Earring, Madcats, The Good Rats, Head East, Molly Hatchet, Pat Travers, Starz, Saxon, Wild Horses, UFO, Streetheart\n\n\"Between October '78 and June '79 we trundled around the globe, playing around 135 gigs, many of them with the same opening bands as before, as well as the Pat Travers Band, Judas Priest, Golden Earring and April Wine.

As demonstrated in numerous recordings, Rush had fun this tour, often changing the lyrics to some of the older songs such as \"The Spirit of Baseball\" and \"The Plumbers of Syrinx\" (with Lerxst adding additional vocals), and a short instrumental was played leading into \"YYZ\". For this tour, \"The Camera Eye\" was abbreviated such that only the \"New York\" or \"London\" section would be performed each night on a seemingly random basis. Although the setlist remained the same throughout most of this tour, \"Chemistry\" and \"The Camera Eye\" were dropped from the setlist in Germany, and although \"The Camera Eye\" was brought back for later dates, \"Chemistry\" was never played again.\n\n\"Shows open with a re-recorded version of the Three Stooges theme. 'It's not the original theme because they won't let you use that,' Lee explained. 'So I hired my friend, violinist Ben Mink, who's a musician extraordinaire and a very big Three Stooges fan, and we had him recreate the original version. The three hellos you hear at the beginning are the three of us talking to him on the phone.'\" - United Press International, December 1, 1987\n\nThe Spirit of Radio (with \"Three Stooges theme\" intro)\n\nTom Sawyer\n\nFreewill\n\nDigital Man\n\nSubdivisions\n\nVital Signs\n\nThe Camera Eye (abbreviated)\n\nCloser To The Heart\n\nChemistry (dropped after 5/3/83)\n\nThe Analog Kid\n\nBroon's Bane\n\nThe Trees\n\nRed Barchetta\n\nThe Weapon (with Count Floyd intro)\n\nNew World Man\n\nLimelight\n\nCountdown\n\nMedley: 2112: Overture/The Temples of Syrinx ->\n\nXanadu (abbreviated)->\n\nLa Villa Strangiato (abbreviated)->\n\nIn The Mood (abbreviated)\n\nEncore: YYZ/Drum Solo\n\nGrace Under Pressure Warm Up Tour (Radio City Music Hall Five Night Stand)\n\nOpening Band: Marillion\n\nGrace Under Pressure Warm Up Tour Dates\n\nSeptember 18-23, 1983 Radio City Music Hall.

This is one of only three tours in which \"Limelight\" was not included in the set, either full time or as an alternate/replacement (the other two being the Presto and R40 tours).\n\nSetlist changes during this tour: for the first leg \"Afterimage\" followed \"Closer to the Heart\", and the Drum Solo was a medley with \"Red Lenses\". After the summer break \"Kid Gloves\" replaced \"Afterimage\", and the all new extended jam section was added to \"Closer to the Heart\". After a 10 day break, beginning October 18th the Drum Solo found its way back to \"YYZ\" as on previous tours, and a new bass intro and full bass solo were added to \"Red Lenses\". \"Kid Gloves\" was dropped from the setlist in Japan. For most of the tour a short Get Smart video was shown as the introduction to \"New World Man\", although during early dates it was shown as the introduction to \"Vital Signs\".\n\nThe Spirit of Radio (with \"Three Stooges theme\" intro)\n\nThe Body Electric\n\nThe Enemy Within: Part I of 'Fear'\n\nThe Weapon: Part II of 'Fear'\n\nWitch Hunt: Part III of 'Fear'\n\nNew World Man\n\nBetween the Wheels\n\nRed Barchetta\n\nDistant Early Warning\n\nRed Sector A\n\nCloser To The Heart (with extended instumental break added beginning Sept. 14)\n\nAfterimage (replaced by Kid Gloves beginning Sept. 14)\n\nYYZ ->\n\n2112: The Temples of Syrinx ->\n\nTom Sawyer\n\nEncore: Red Lenses (bass solo added beginning Oct. 18)\n\nDrum Solo (moved to follow YYZ beginning Oct. 18)\n\nRed Lenses (reprise)\n\nVital Signs\n\nFinding My Way ->\n\nIn The Mood\n\nPower Windows Warm Up Tour (Spring Training 1985)\n\nPower Windows Warm Up Tour Dates\n\nMarch 11-12, 1985 Civic Center.

Additionally, \"New World Man\" was apparently dropped from the last month of the tour; its last known performance was April 22, '86, and it would not be performed again until the Vapor Trails tour.\n\nThe Spirit of Radio (with \"Three Stooges theme\" intro)\n\nLimelight\n\nThe Big Money\n\nNew World Man (dropped sometime after 4/22/86)\n\nSubdivisions\n\nManhattan Project\n\nMiddletown Dreams\n\nWitch Hunt\n\nRed Sector A\n\nCloser To The Heart\n\nMarathon\n\nThe Trees\n\nMystic Rhythms\n\nDistant Early Warning\n\nTerritories\n\nYYZ ->\n\nDrum Solo ->\n\nRed Lenses (abbreviated)\n\nTom Sawyer\n\nEncore: 2112: Overture/The Temples of Syrinx\n\nGrand Designs\n\nIn The Mood\n\nHold Your Fire Tour\n\nOpening Bands: MSG, Tommy Shaw, Chalk Circle, The Rainmakers\n\nHold Your Fire Tour Dates\n\nOctober 29-30, 1987 Memorial Stadium.

Beginning with the European leg a short \"Cygnus X-1\" teaser was added to close the finale (a practice which was brought back for the Test For Echo tour). Beginning with the Denver show, with less than a month left in the tour, \"Subdivisions\" and \"The Pass\" were dropped and \"The Trees\" was added, and as early as two shows later \"Vital Signs\" and \"The Analog Kid\" were also added in the slots previously held by \"Subdivisions\" and \"The Pass\"; these three songs would remain in the setlist for the remainder of the tour. During this final leg's performances of \"The Trees\", Alex regularly played a few notes similar to the Beach Boys' \"Sloop John B\", a treatment that would continue during the following tour.\n\nForce Ten (with \"A Show of Hands\" video intro)\n\nLimelight\n\nFreewill (abbreviated)->\n\nDistant Early Warning\n\nTime Stand Still\n\nDreamline\n\nBravado\n\nRoll the Bones\n\nShow Don't Tell\n\nThe Big Money\n\nGhost of a Chance (added 12/4/91)\n\nSubdivisions (dropped 5/27/92, replaced by Vital Signs beginning 5/31 or 5/29)\n\nThe Pass (dropped 5/27/92, replaced by The Analog Kid beginning 5/31 or 5/29)\n\nThe Trees (added 5/27/92)\n\nWhere's My Thing?\n\nThe Rhythm Method (Drum Solo)\n\nCloser To The Heart\n\nXanadu (abbreviated)->\n\nSuperconductor\n\nTom Sawyer\n\nEncore Medley: The Spirit of Radio->\n\n2112: Overture->\n\nFinding My Way (abbreviated)->\n\nLa Villa Strangiato (abbreviated)->\n\nAnthem (abbreviated)->\n\nRed Barchetta (abbreviated)->\n\nThe Spirit of Radio (reprise)->\n\nCygnus X-1 (teaser, added as early as 4/29/92)\n\nCounterparts Tour\n\nOpening Bands: Candlebox, The Melvins, Primus, The Doughboys, I Mother Earth\n\n\"It was Primus that got us to bring back parts from 'Hemispheres'...they would jam at soundcheck with all this stuff and we'd stand at the side of the stage and laugh. We got very close with them and hung out a lot and they said, 'You know, you should bring some of that stuff back, it was so cool, it's what we grew up with...' So we figured, 'Yeah, ok!' We started messing around in sound check with bits and pieces from 'Hemispheres' and then brought it back on the [Counterparts] tour.\" - Alex Lifeson, A Show Of Fans #13, Winter 1996\n\n\"We had The Melvins open for us.

Although not included in the final setlist, during pre-tour rehearsals \"Distant Early Warning\" was performed between \"Force Ten\" and \"YYZ\". This was the last tour in which Rush toured with an opening band. In addition, this is the only tour that did not include any part of \"2112\" in the setlist; in fact, nothing from the first four albums was in the set. This tour marks the return of \"Hemispheres\", with 'Prelude' performed for the first time in twelve years; other than a short teaser in the \"R30 Overture\", \"Hemispheres: Prelude\" would not be heard again until the final tour.\n\nHaving fun this tour, Geddy usually introduced \"Cold Fire\" as a country song (often with a country music introduction), and Alex would introduce \"Stick It Out\" with a humorous comment and later in the show gave humorous band introductions during the \"Closer To The Heart\" jam; the introductions were never the same, and never did he make correct introductions, usually introducing each member of the band as a famous celebrity. Alex also again played a few notes from the Beach Boys' \"Sloop John B\" at the end of \"The Trees\", a practice that began on the final leg of the previous tour.\n\nDreamline (with \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" intro)\n\nThe Spirit of Radio\n\nThe Analog Kid\n\nCold Fire (with Country music intro)\n\nTime Stand Still\n\nNobody's Hero\n\nRoll the Bones\n\nAnimate\n\nStick It Out (with introduction by Lerxst)\n\nDouble Agent\n\nLimelight\n\nBravado (added 4/20/94)\n\nMystic Rhythms\n\nCloser To The Heart (with member introductions by Lerxst)\n\nShow Don't Tell\n\nLeave That Thing Alone!\n\nThe Rhythm Method (Drum Solo)\n\nThe Trees\n\nXanadu (abbreviated)->\n\nHemispheres: Prelude\n\nTom Sawyer\n\nForce Ten\n\nYYZ\n\nCygnus X-1 (teaser)\n\nTest for Echo Tour\n\n\"Rush performed 47 shows between October 1996 and July 1997. Seven of those dates-again consisting of arenas and amphitheaters-were sold out. Tickets were in the $40-25 range, with gross ticket sales totaling almost $14 million.

Following this tour, \"Driven\" and \"Resist\" (acoustic) would be played on the Vapor Trails tour, and \"Resist\" would also be played on the R30 tour. No other songs from Test for Echo would ever be heard again.\n\nSetlist changes during this tour: \"Resist\" and \"Time and Motion\" were both performed for the first two dates only; following these two dates, the band alternated these two songs from one night to the next (and as demonstrated in various recordings, both were introduced with a Scottish reference). After the first ten dates, \"Time and Motion\" was dropped completely in favor of \"Resist\" and the setlist remained constant throughout the rest of the tour. The Surfaris' \"Wipe Out\", last performed during the Presto tour, was brought back for the first leg of this tour as the second half of a medley with \"The Big Money\". On the second leg of the tour \"The Big Money\"/\"Wipe Out\" was dropped and replaced with \"Limelight\" and \"Stick It Out\"; \"Subdivisions\" was also dropped; \"Red Sector A\" moved up in the set to follow \"Freewill\".\n\nDreamline (with \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" intro)\n\nThe Big Money (replaced by Limelight second leg)\n\nWipe Out (replaced by Stick It Out second leg)\n\nDriven\n\nHalf the World\n\nRed Barchetta\n\nAnimate\n\nLimbo\n\nThe Trees\n\nRed Sector A (moved to follow Freewill second leg)\n\nVirtuality\n\nNobody's Hero\n\nCloser To The Heart\n\n2112 (complete)\n\n(-Intermission-)\n\nTest For Echo\n\nSubdivisions (first leg only)\n\nFreewill\n\nRoll the Bones\n\nResist (dropped 10/23,26,29/96 and 11/1,4,7/96)\n\nLeave That Thing Alone!\n\nThe Rhythm Method (Drum Solo)\n\nNatural Science\n\nForce Ten\n\nTime and Motion (10/19-20, followed Roll the Bones on 10/23,26,29 and 11/1,4,7/96; completely dropped 11/9/96)\n\nThe Spirit of Radio\n\nTom Sawyer\n\nEncore: YYZ\n\nCygnus X-1 (teaser)\n\nVapor Trails Tour\n\n\"Canadian power trio Rush will kick off its first tour in five years June 28 in Hartford, Connecticut...The tour is billed as 'An Evening With Rush,' and will not feature an opening act.
