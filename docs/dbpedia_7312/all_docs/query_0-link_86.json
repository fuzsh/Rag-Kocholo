        "text": "West Kelowna 7 Vernon 1\n\nFor anyone who could not attend or watch tonight’s Vipers game here are my thoughts and views from tonight’s game. You may agree or disagree but we all have our own view and opinion on any game we watch. This is my opinion and my thoughts on how I saw tonight’s game. I try to be unbiased and give a fare recap on both sides. Thanks for stopping by & visiting my blog.\n\nI was at tonight's BCHL game as West Kelowna defeated Vernon 7-1 in front of 1,018 fans at Royal Le Page Place.\n\nStarting Goaltenders:\n\nVernon: Danny Todosychuk\n\nWest Kelowna: Tyler Briggs\n\n1st Period: Off the opening faceoff Ryan Renz was caught way inside the Warriors blueline giving up the two on one as Seb Lloyd & Brennan Clark went in before Clark dished off to Lloyd who went in for the breakaway beating Danny Todosychuk fivehole on the Warriors first shot just twenty nine seconds into the hockey game. Clark with the lone assist. Off the next faceoff and just twenty seconds later Colton Sparrow setup Adam Tambellini on a odd man rush who beat Tyler Briggs tying the game at :49 seconds. Sparrow with the only helper on the goal. Two minutes later Braeden Russell setup Liam Board on a odd man rush but it was Briggs who come up with the nice save off Board. West Kelowna come right back after Matt Anholt stole the puck from Ryan Renz before being stopped in the slot by Danny Todosychuk. The Warriors with some good pressure deep in the Vipers zone took a 2-1 lead after former Vernon Vipers forward Marcus Basara setup Seb Lloyd for his second of the night at 3:30 Basara with the lone assist. West Kelowna was the better of the two teams early and often carrying the better of the play. Brennan Clark and Jetlan Houcher on a two on one was stopped by Todosychuk. Vernon would get the games first powerplay but with no real scoring opportunities the Warriors killed off the minor. Just as the penalty expired a shot from the side of the net went through the Warriors crease and out the other side on a close call. Jedd Soleway took a stick or elbow to the chops and had to get some repairs done on the Vipers bench but stayed in the game. West Kelowna carried the edge in play and was the better of the two teams in the first half. The Vipers did play a little better early in the second half getting some pressure and carried the edge in play but didnt get any real good scoring chances before the Warriors would get back to back powerplays and blow the game wide open before the end of the first period. David Pope setup Adam Plant who walked in from the slot beat Todosychuk giving West Kelowna a 3-1 lead at 16:50 with Pope and former Salmon Arm Silverbacks d-man Josh Monk collecting the assists. On the second man advantage Vernon had two chances to clear the zone but didnt and it cost them after Seb Lloyd scored his third of the game giving the Warriors a 4-1 lead at 18:39 Adam Plant & Josh Monk picked up the helpers. This was the end of the night for Danny Todosychuk who gave up four goals on thirteen shots as Austin Smith sporting his new goal equipment replaced Todosychuk in the final minute and a half. The Warriors were the better of the two teams and outplayed the Vipers for most of the period. West Kelowna was up 4-1 after 20 minutes of play. The Warriors outshot the Vipers 13-8.\n\n2nd Period: Just twenty two seconds into the middle frame West Kelowna went on their third powerplay of the game and capitalized. Moving the puck around the Warriors setup David Pope for a wide open net but it was Austin Smith who somehow come across his crease diving to rob Pope with a huge glove save leaving Pope shaking his head. Pope would get the last laugh on the next shift the Warriors moved the puck around setting up Pope who beat Smith from the slot giving West Kelowna a 5-1 lead at 1:14 Seb lloyd and Adam Plant picked up the helpers. Off the next faceoff the Warriors come right back and just about went up 6-1 after ringing a quick shot off the post. A few minutes later Warriors captain Marcus Basara was stopped by Smith who made another quick glove save. Brennan Clark left the ice during the 2nd and didnt return. Atleast I didnt notice him for the remainder of the game. The Warriors went up 6-1 after Matt Anholt's point shot was stopped by Austin Smith who thought he had it covered under his pads, but with no whistle Shawn Hochhausen went to the net found the loose puck in the crease before tapping the puck into the back of the net at 8:43 Anholt with the only assist on the goal. Just over three minutes later Matthew Berry setup Ambrose Firkus who put West Kelowna up 7-1 at 12:04 Berry with the only assist. On the next shift West Kelowna would then get their fourth powerplay of the night but it was the Vipers who had a pretty good penalty kill would kill off the minor. Just two minutes later a huge scrum formed deep inside the West Kelowna zone with everyone pushing and shoving punches were thrown as everyone had a dancing partner. In the end the Warriors come out of the scrum with the man advantage after Brendan Persley was given a ten minute misconduct and hit the dressing room. The Warriors would get a four minute powerplay but unable to capitalize on the first two minutes West Kelowna would take a penalty as both teams played a little four on four late in the period. The Warriors with three goals in the second put this game out of reach as the Vipers didnt record a single scoring chance this period. The Warriors took their foot off the gas once they went up 7-1 as both teams kinda coasted for the remainder of the period. West Kelowna was up 7-1 after 40 minutes of play. The Warriors outshot the Vipers 20-15.\n\n3rd Period: The Vipers would get an early chance after Tyler Briggs was forced to make back to back saves off Braeden Russell and Liam Board before the Warriors come right back with an odd man rush. Devon Hascarl and Brent Lashuk on a two on one but Hascarl was stopped by Austin Smith. A few shifts later TJ Dumonceaux who returned to the Vipers lineup tonight went in for the breakaway but shot high and over the goal. West Kelowna would call an early timeout before getting an early powerplay. Vernon would kill off the minor. Marc Hetnik had a great chance jumped up into the play and alone behind the net tried beating Tyler Briggs on the wrap around but the Warriors veteran goaltender come up with the big save. With Vernon on a late man advantage it was the Warriors who come up with a two on one. Matt Anholt and Brent Lashuk were hauled down as both teams played a little four on four. With about four minutes remaining the Vipers with lots of traffic in front come up with atleast three or four good opportunities in close but it was Tyler Briggs who was down and out but somehow made three or four big saves. In the dying ten seconds Logan Mick made a nice move around his defenceman before making another move on Briggs, looking to have the goaltender out of position Mick was unable to get off a shot before the final buzzer went. The Warriors snapped a three game losing streak with the 7-1 victory. With the game already over before the period started there wasnt alot of action in the final frame as both teams were just playing out the clock. Vernon outshot West Kelowna 11-10.\n\nTop Players: (Vernon)\n\nAdam Tambellini (1 goal) I thought played hard, skated hard and was one of the Vipers lone bright spots.\n\nColton Sparrow (1 assist) I thought also played hard, battled and competed and made atleast three maybe four shot blocks through out tonight's game.\n\nAaron Hadley who didnt show much of anything from the start of the hockey game really seemed to play with a bit of an edge and looked mean in the final three or four minutes of the 2nd period and into the final period. Hadley played with some emotion and probally frustration but was hitting anybody in sight.\n\nGame Thoughts: (Vernon)\n\nLast weekend & this weekend are two big home and home series vs teams the Vipers are trying to catch. Splitting last weekends home and home series with Penticton the Vipers come into tonight's game-home and home series vs a West Kelowna team that has been struggling as of late. Riding a three game losing streak and winners of just two games in their last eleven games tonight was a great opportunity for Vernon to make a statement. So what happens they get blown out 7-1 and dont show up to play. Ive said it all season, this team is very uncosistant and you just never know what team your going to see from game to game. Where's the Vipers team that I watched defeat the Vees 2-1 last weekend in Penticton? Saturday night's 3-1 loss at home to Penticton and tonight's 7-1 loss was not the same team. This was a very dissapointing game and loss as a fan and should be as the Vipers team-organization. I didnt see anything positive tonight from the Vipers side, this game was over before the end of the opening period. You couldnt blame the Vipers goaltenders on any of the seven goals. Vernon had maybe ten good scoring chances all night as Tyler Briggs didnt see alot of action. Once again too many mistakes for this time of year. With tomorrow's BCHL Card Deadline you have to wonder if the Vipers are going to shake things up or stick with this group that cant seem to get the job done.\n\nTop Players: (West Kelowna)\n\nSeb lloyd (3 goals & 1 assist) Played a heck of a game tonight. I remember when West Kelowna played in Vernon back in October Lloyd was the lone Warrior to score that night and really stood out. Well he played very well tonight. Saw alot of ice and was always open and in and around the goal.\n\nAdam Plant (1 goal & 2 assists) Was very solid on the Warriors blueline. A strong-smooth skater, moves the puck well, reads and sees the ice-play. Jumps up into the play and makes things happen in a hurry.\n\nDavid Pope (1 goal & 1 assist) Played a strong game for West Kelowna.\n\nShawn Hochhausen (1 goal) Played very well for the Warriors. Always seems to play well against Vernon.\n\nBrent Lashuk played with alot of jump-energy, was involved in the play, had some chances.\n\nBrennan Clark (1 assist) I thought made things happen tonight, very involved in the play early. I saw him leave the ice and the bench in the 2nd period and didnt notice him return for the remainder of the game.\n\nMatt Anholt (1 assist) Another kid who stood out, created some chances and was involved in the play.\n\nGame Thoughts: (West Kelowna)\n\nRiding a three game losing streak and just two wins in their last eleven games the West Kelowna Warriors without captain Max French and injured Brett McKinnon made a statement tonight dumping the Vipers 7-1 in the first of three meetings between these two teams within a week. Give the Warriors credit with some big-key injuries and in a slump they come to play tonight and jumped five points up on Vernon in a big Division game. I thought West Kelowna's powerplay was very strong. The Warriors capitalized on their chances and made the Vipers pay off their mistakes-penalties. The Warriors are quick, move the puck well and show they can find the back of the net. Up 7-1 the Warriors took their foot off the gas and sat back as both teams didnt really put up much in the final period and a half. Max French took the warmup but didnt play tonight.\n\nScratches:\n\nVernon:\n\nMichael Roberts\n\nCraig Martin (Injured)\n\nWest Kelowna:\n\nBrett McKinnon\n\nMax French\n\nWarriors Energy Player Of The Game:\n\nBrent Lashuk\n\nThree Stars:\n\n1st Star: Seb Lloyd (3 goals & 1 assist)\n\n2nd Star: Adam Plant (1 goal & 2 assists)\n\n3rd Star: Shawn Hochhausen (1 goal)\n\nFor more on tonight's game visit the boxscore,\n\nhttp://www.bchl.ca/leagues/hockey_boxscores.cfm?clientID=1413&leagueID=2393&gameID=1102966&link=bchl\n\nFor more on tonight's game & the West Kelowna Warriors visit Jon Zack's West Kelowna Warriors blog,\n\nhttp://thegeneralsreport.wordpress.com/\n\nAmericans Sign Former Vipers Goaltender Lee-Knight:\n\nThe WHL Tri-City Americans have signed former Vernon Vipers tryout goaltender Luke Lee-Knight. Lee-Knight was invited to the Americans Training camp this year before being reassigned. In two pre-season games with the Americans Lee-Knight went 0-1 with a 5.98 GAA. Lee-Knight then signed with the SJHL Humboldt Broncos in October before going back to the Western Hockey League Americans. In five games with the Broncos Lee-Knight went 4-1 with two shutouts and a 2.56 GAA. Lee-Knight attended the Vernon Vipers Training camp last year before being released-cut. Lee-Knight played last season with the WHL Spokane Chiefs and Prince Albert Raiders.\n\nLuke Lee-Knight's Player Profile:\n\nhttp://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=145164\n\nThis is posted on the Americans website:\n\nFiebelkorn Leaves Team; Lee-Knight Rejoins Club from Humboldt\n\nNov 12, 2012\n\nKennewick, WA – Tri-City Americans Governor/General Manager Bob Tory announced today that 18-year-old goaltender Brenden Fiebelkorn has opted to leave the club for personal reasons. Additionally, Tory announced that 19-year-old goaltender Luke Lee-Knight will join the club immediately.\n\nFiebelkorn, a 6’1, 185-pound netminder from Winnipeg, Manitoba, appeared in two games this season, picking up his first WHL win on November 4 vs. Vancouver. Fiebelkorn has played in three WHL games in his career, making his WHL debut in a relief appearance back during the 2010-11 season while a member of the Prince Albert Raiders.\n\nLee-Knight, meanwhile, rejoins the WHL club he started training camp with from the Humboldt Broncos of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League. The 6’2, 195-pound goaltender from Calgary, Alberta appeared in 5 games with the Broncos, going 4-1 with a 2.56 goals against average, 0.924 save percentage and 2 shutouts. Lee-Knight spent last season between the Prince Albert Raiders and the Spokane Chiefs, appearing in 22 games and collecting a 2-4-2-1 record along with a 4.82 goals against average and a 0.841 save percentage.\n\nIn an unrelated move, Tory also announced today that 15-year-old goaltender Evan Sarthou will join the club this week for practice while Eric Comrie is away with Team WHL at the Subway Super Series. Sarthou was the Americans’ third round draft pick (65th overall) at the 2012 Bantam Draft and was signed by the club in late August. The Black Diamond, Washington-native is currently playing with the L.A. Jr. Kings of the Tier 1 AAA Elite Hockey League, going 7-2 in 9 games played, along with compiling a 2.31 goals against average, a 0.900 save percentage and 3 shutouts.\n\nComrie and Team WHL will play host to Team Russia on Wednesday, November 14 in Vancouver, B.C. and on Thursday, November 15 in Victoria, B.C. Currently, Team Russia is 2-1 in the Subway Super Series, splitting the two games against Team QMJHL and taking the first of two games against the OHL. Game 2 vs. Team OHL and game 4 of the 6-game series is tonight in Sarnia, Ontario. Comrie is the sixth Tri-City Americans player to compete with Team WHL at this event and the third goaltender to be chosen. He joins former Tri-City players Brendan Shinnimin, Chet Pickard, Carey Price, Logan Stephenson and Shawn Belle as participants in the series.\n\nThis is in the Tri-City Herald Newspaper:\n\nGoalie Lee-Knight rejoins Americans\n\nPublished: November 14, 2012\n\nBy Annie Fowler\n\nLuke Lee-Knight was crushed when he was released by the Tri-City Americans just days before the season opener.\n\nThe veteran goalie, who has spent time with Prince Albert and Spokane last year, opened the season at the Americans’ training camp as a free agent, fighting for the backup job behind Eric Comrie with Brenden Fiebelkorn, 18.\n\nIn the end, Tri-City opted for Fiebelkorn, who was a year younger.\n\n“There weren’t too many hard feelings,” Lee-Knight said of his dismissal in September. “Going back was hard at first, but I think it boosted my confidence. I got a call last Wednesday asking if I would come back. I was in a pretty good spot with my Junior A team and playing a lot. But this is a pretty special opportunity, and I jumped at it. I like the guys here a lot, and that motivated me to come back.”\n\nFiebelkorn, a native of Winnipeg, Manitoba, appeared in just two games before he left the team after last Saturday’s game against Kamloops, citing personal reasons.\n\nFiebelkorn won his only start — 9-1 against Vancouver on Nov. 4.\n\nLee-Knight had been playing with the Humboldt Broncos of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League. The native of Calgary, Alberta, was 4-1 with the Broncos with a 2.56 goals against average, a .924 save percentage and two shutouts.\n\nLee-Knight got to Kennewick on Monday, while 15-year-old goalie Evan Sarthou arrived Sunday to help out at practice while Comrie is at the Subway Super Series with Team WHL.\n\n“I’ve been enjoying it,” said Sarthou, who leaves today. “Just the opportunity to come up and practice with everyone was worth the trip. It’s a lot quicker here, and you have to be quicker to get in position to make saves. The shots are better and the compete level is pretty high.”\n\nSarthou, who plays for the L.A. Jr. Kings, missed one game with his team, but he said they were in good hands while he was gone. Like Fiebelkorn, Lee-Knight knows he will have to pay his dues to earn ice time.\n\n“This is a business where nothing is promised,” Lee-Knight said. “You control your own destiny. Eric is a great goalie. He can go a lot of the work, but I want to be able to push him and get a lot of work myself. I want to help the team win a championship.”\n\nVees Collect Split With 3-1 Win:\n\nThis is in todays Morning Star Newspaper:\n\nVees collect split with 3-1 win\n\nPublished: November 26, 2012\n\nGraeme Corbett\n\nMorning Star Staff\n\nPlenty of chirping, a decent scrap, emotions red-lining and a playoff vibe – the second leg of a home-and-home set between the Vernon Vipers and Penticton Vees had it all Saturday night.\n\nAfter dropping the opening B.C. Hockey League tilt the night before, the Vees rebounded with a workmanlike effort to secure a split with a 3-1 win in front of 2,000 fans at Wesbild Centre.\n\nThe result puts Penticton (17-7-0-2) back into a two-way tie for first overall with the Chilliwack Chiefs (17-6-1-1). Vernon is fifth in the Interior at 9-10-0-6.\n\n“Both games were playoff-style hockey games,” said Vees’ head coach Fred Harbinson. “You’ve got to give Vernon credit – they came into our building and found a way to win. I give our guys credit for finding a way to win in another tough place in the BCHL.”\n\nWith Viper newcomer Liam Board serving a hooking minor, the Vees’ Sam Mellor (7th goal) fired the winner on a late first-period powerplay.\n\n“It was just a knuckle puck from the point and it found a way in,” said Mellor, named first star. “I was pretty pumped about it.\n\n“We thought we deserved the win (Friday). We thought we outplayed them a little, so it was good to come back here and rebound.”\n\nMellor left the NCAA Alaska-Anchorage Seawolves after one season to return to Junior A. He has since recommitted to the Western Michigan Broncos.\n\nThe former Trail Smoke Eater credited Penticton’s line of Cody Depourcq, Travis Blanleil and Cam Amantea for hounding Vernon’s No. 1 unit – Pearce Eviston, Adam Tambellini and Logan Mick – all weekend.\n\nEviston must have noticed their presence too, as he gave Depourcq a face full of mitt right in front on the Penticton bench behind the play.\n\n“You go at it a few times with them and the emotions are pretty high there,” said the 20-year-old Vancouver product.\n\n“You start to despise the guys on the other team when you play two games in a row.”\n\nDepourcq’s unit generated the Vees’ first goal as Amantea (3rd) used a slick top-shelf finish over Austin Smith’s glove after Tambellini (18th) had given Vernon the lead on the Vipers’ first and only man advantage of the game.\n\nPenticton defender Sean Flanagan showed great hands and patience to find Amantea in the slot.\n\nTambellini’s goal came midway through the first period when his quick release from the top of the right circle deflected off a shin pad to beat Chad Katunar (28 saves).\n\nKatunar had denied Tambellini on a backhand from in close in the opening minute.\n\n“We got a couple big saves early in the game and it was a good push back after we gave up that powerplay goal,” said Harbinson.\n\n“We talked about putting the puck in areas we could get to it first and we did a better job on our forecheck tonight than (Friday). We were pretty efficient tonight.”\n\nThe Vees sealed the win with Brad McClure’s 15th of the season. The Stratford, Ont. native took a drop pass from Mellor and beat Smith (29 saves) blocker side with four minutes to play.\n\nSee WARRIOR on B3\n\nContinued from B1\n\n“We had a few breakdowns on the third goal,” said Vipers’ assistant coach Dave Robinson. “A few guys were trying to leave the zone (after the faceoff).”\n\nRobinson liked the Vipers’ overall effort but said they needed to do more to stifle Penticton’s talent.\n\n“We have to take the game to them because they’re so skilled,” he said. “They’ve got team speed and they’ll take advantage of you if you’re sitting back.\n\n“Even though we lost tonight, I think it’s a confidence booster. First-place team and we go in there and take two points from them. It’s definitely something to build off.”\n\nBrendan Persley and James De Haas dropped the mitts in a spirited bout late in the second frame. Persley opened with a couple of hard rights to the button, but De Hass came right back with a flurry of his own to earn a draw.\n\nVernon opens another home-and-home with the West Kelowna Warriors (10-7-1-6) Friday night at Royal LePage Place. Rylan Ferster’s squad visits Wesbild Saturday.\n\nSNAKE BITES: The Vipers are 6-3-0-1 in their last 10 games. The Warriors are 2-5-1-2...Just four points separate sixth place (Trail, 23) and third (West Kelowna, 27)...Vernon’s powerplay has steadily risen in recent weeks and is now 10th in the league at 18.75 per cent. Penticton’s is third-last at 17.09 per cent...Former Viper Steven Weinstein, now with the NCAA Bentley Falcons, is Player of the Week in the Atlantic Hockey Association. Weinstein had a goal and three assists as Bentley split a pair of games against Mercyhurst. The Los Angeles native had all three helpers in Saturday’s 5-1 Falcons win. He now leads all NCAA d-men with 14 points.\n\nBCHL Team-By-Team Reports:\n\nThis is in the November Issue of the BC Hockey Now Newspaper:\n\nBCHL Team-By-Team Reports\n\nNovember 08, 2012\n\nPosted in BC Edition, Junior A\n\nBy / Brent Mutis\n\nWith the World Junior A Challenge (WJAC) going on in Yarmouth, N.S., several BCHL teams are making do without some of their top players. Penticton Vees forward Wade Murphy is one of 15 BCHLers on Team Canada West (TCW) and his absence means there could be a change atop the scoring race. Will Langley’s Mario Puskarich overtake him? Or maybe West Kelowna’s Marcus Basara? It’s going to be fun to watch.\n\nINTERIOR DIVISION\n\nMerritt Centennials\n\nThe Cents remain in striking distance of first-place Penticton thanks partly to offseason acquisitions Sebastian Pare and Derek Huisman who are second and third in team scoring. Goalie Tyler Steel narrowly missed making TCW but that’s helpful for the Cents as the Vernon-native is having a great season.\n\nPenticton Vees\n\nLosing Wade Murphy, Mike Rebry, Troy Stecher and James De Haas to the WJAC will present a challenge to Penticton but it will give opportunities to youngsters Ryan Gropp, Cody DePourcq, Louie Nanne and Alex Jewell. Vets Sam Mellor and Chad Katunar will help steady the ship as well.\n\nSalmon Arm SilverBacks\n\nIf they could play Vernon all the time, this team might be at the top of the division. The Gorillas have defeated the rival Snakes three times in overtime already. A recent road win over West Kelowna provides a confidence boost and an improving powerplay is a good sign.\n\nTrail Smoke Eaters\n\nThey’re holding down the final playoff spot despite the fact they’ve surrendered the most goals in the league and are last in powerplay and penalty kill. Forward Brent Baltus is having a breakout campaign and has been piling up the points while goalie Lyndon Stanwood remains the frontrunner for team MVP.\n\nVernon Vipers\n\nThe Snakes have struggled to find real momentum and wins on Oct. 27 and Nov. 2 were their first consecutive victories this season. Aaron Hadley made TCW for the second straight year but Adam Tambellini did not so the team retains its top scorer. More production from their 14th-ranked power play would help.\n\nWest Kelowna Warriors\n\nA four-game losing streak in late October and early November allowed Merritt to overtake them for second place and now Seb Lloyd will be away for three games since he made TCW. Getting captain Max French back from injury will be a big boost; he’s second in team goal-scoring despite just nine games played.\n\nISLAND DIVISION\n\nAlberni Valley Bulldogs\n\nNo longer the league’s top-scoring team, the ‘Dogs will also be without leading scorer Evan Tironese due to TCW commitments. The blockbuster deal that sent Evan Anderson and Turner Popoff to Langley for defenceman Bo Pellah was a surprise but a six-game losing streak prompted a shakeup by ‘Dogs management.\n\nCowichan Valley Capitals\n\nThe BCHL’s second-best powerplay is detracted from by the fact the Caps also have the third-worst penalty killing in the league. Four players – Ryan Hanes, Teal Burns, Jordan Grant and Steen Cooper – are at a point per game or better but the team is still on the wrong side of the goals for/against category.\n\nNanaimo Clippers\n\nIt’s tight from second to fourth in the Island standings but the Clips lead the group that’s chasing Victoria and have games in hand on both Alberni Valley and Powell River. Nanaimo has the fewest powerplay goals in the league and has just an average PK – sharpening up the special teams will go a long way.\n\nPowell River Kings\n\nProbably no team is more challenged by losing players to the WJAC than the Kings as they’re losing their starting goalie in Jonah Imoo plus forward Evan Richardson and defenceman Luke Ripley. No Kings are even near a point-a-game and the loss of Matt Scarth with a shoulder injury is not helping.\n\nVictoria Grizzlies\n\nSafe to say they are the real deal. After a tragic finish last season, the Grizz are tops on the Island and boast one of the best goalie tandems with Brady Rouleau and Michael Stiliadis. The Fitzgerald triplets are 1-2-3 in team scoring and D-men DJ Jones and Nolan De Jong have been contributing though De Jong is with TCW from Nov. 5 to 11.\n\nMAINLAND DIVISION\n\nChilliwack Chiefs\n\nWith three scorers – Austin Plevy, Josh Hansen and Luke Esposito – in the top six in league scoring, the Chiefs are a consistent offensive threat each night out. Couple that with rugged defensive work by captain David Thompson, Shay Laurent and Alexandre Perron-Fontaine and it’s not a leap to suggest the Chiefs could overtake Prince George for first place in the division.\n\nCoquitlam Express\n\nThe Express have also been pilfered by TCW as Alex Kerfoot, Brandon Morley and Zach Pryzbek are all missing time for the WJAC. But goalies Cole Huggins and Daniel Urbani continue to put up microscopic goals-against averages and big save percentages. Express penalty killing has been lights-out as well.\n\nLangley Rivermen\n\nIn a division where all the teams are above .500, somebody’s got to be last and lately it’s been Langley. But trading Bo Pellah brings in talented young forward Evan Anderson and with the way Mario Puskarich has been playing, the opposition will be on their toes. Production from the back is questionable now though without Pellah.\n\nPrince George Spruce Kings\n\nIt looks like another successful season in PG and the home fans are taking note with attendance up almost 200 fans a night. Mitch Eden is one of two defencemen in the league leading his team in scoring (Shane Hanna in Salmon Arm is the other) and Coltyn Hansen and Cam Lawson have made up for the loss of the Fitzgerald triplets.\n\nSurrey Eagles\n\nBrady Shaw made an immediate impact after arriving in a deal from Coquitlam that sent Brandon Morley the other way. Shaw scored four times in his first two games and has kept Surrey in the picture in the tightest division in the league. There’s another good goalie tandem here with Michael Santaguida and Glenn Ferguson."
