        "text": "At 5-10-4, the Minnesota Wild are off to their worst start since the inaugural season in 2000-01. The latest loss came Sunday, a 4-1 blow to the Red Wings in Detroit. No matter what happens Tuesday night when the Wild host the St. Louis Blues, the 2023-24 season is the worst 20-game start for Minnesota since the 2000-01 expansion team went 4-12-3-1 in the first 20 games.\n\nMinnesota's record through 20 games, year by year:\n\n2022-23: 9-9-2\n\n2021-22: 13-6-1\n\n2020-21: 12-7-1\n\n2019-20: 7-11-2\n\n2018-19: 12-6-2\n\n2017-18: 9-8-3\n\n2016-17: 11-7-2\n\n2015-16: 11-6-3\n\n2014-15: 12-8-0\n\n2013-14: 12-4-4\n\n2012-13: 10-8-2\n\n2011-12: 12-5-3\n\n2010-11: 10-8-2\n\n2009-10: 7-11-2\n\n2008-09: 12-7-1\n\n2007-08: 11-7-2\n\n2006-07: 12-7-1\n\n2005-06: 9-9-2\n\n2004-05: Strike season\n\n2003-04: 8-9-3\n\n2002-03: 11-5-4\n\n2001-02: 7-8-4-1\n\n2000-01: 4-12-3-1\n\nMinnesota tied Sunday's game 1-1 with 11 seconds left in the first period when Kirill Kaprizov's shot was deflected into the back of the net by Joel Eriksson Ek for his team-leading 10th goal of the season. The goal was initially awarded to Kaprizov before the change was announced between periods.\n\nDylan Larkin gave Detroit a 2-1 lead with 3:07 left in the second period. The goal came during 4-on-4 play when Larkin cut to the center of the ice and fired a shot that Wild goalie Filip Gustavsson couldn't control and neither Frederick Gaudreau or Brock Faber were able to clear the juicy rebound before Larkin got to it and buried a shot for his eighth goal of the season.\n\nWith the Wild on the power play in the final two minutes of the second period, Eriksson Ek found himself alone on a breakaway with a chance to tie the game but he never got a shot off, instead mishandling the puck and turning it over.\n\nThat proved a costly missed opportunity because Pat Maroon was whistled for a tripping penalty just 54 seconds into the third period and the Red Wings made the Wild pay as David Perron's second goal of the game – the 300th of his career – came on the ensuing power play for a 3-1 Detroit lead.\n\nDetroit would add an empty net goal in the final seconds after Minnesota didn't capitalize on a pair of third period power plays.\n\nUp next: Wild vs. Blues, Tuesday at 7 p.m. CT."
