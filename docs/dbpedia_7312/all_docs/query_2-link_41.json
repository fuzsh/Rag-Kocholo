        "text": "The St. Louis Blues may be in dire straits but the man running the troubled NHL franchise is already raising cash to invest in new sports businesses.\n\nBloomberg recently reported that SCP Worldwide, run by Dave Checketts, was getting an extension from Citigroup to repay the $120 million loan it used to buy the Blues in 2006 for $150 million from billionaires Bill and Nancy Laurie. The purpose of the extension is to give Checketts more time to sell the team, which he believes he can do before the 2011-12 NHL season begins.\n\nOur figures show the debt-laden Blues to be worth just $165 million and losing $6.2 million from operations during the 2009-10 season."
