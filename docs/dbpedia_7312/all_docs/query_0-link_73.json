        "text": "Going into my second year of U Sports Hockey and into my second removed from the Western Hockey League, I thought it would be fun to reminisce about the league I spent four years of my life in. This will be the first of a series of articles reflecting on the players, teams, arenas and cities I visited.\n\nIn this article I will be counting down the top five best arena atmospheres. Bear in mind this is all coming from a slight Western Conference-bias, as I spent all four years on the Vancouver Giants, only visiting each Eastern Conference division every other year. Enjoy:\n\n#5: Scotiabank Saddledome – Calgary\n\nThe atmosphere for a Hitmen game isn’t quite like a Flames game at the Saddledome (duh) however the Calgarians do their best to make it comparable. Each time I played here (usually a Saturday or Sunday afternoon), there were still around 10,000 people jammed into the lower bowl. Not much can compare to the sound of an NHL team’s goal horn blaring in through your ears… except when you’re on the visiting team. Let’s also just fathom that us WHLers were lucky enough to lace up in an NHL arena.\n\n#4: The Arena (not used anymore) – Medicine Hat\n\nIf you want to discuss hell on ice, then playing the Medicine Hat Tigers in The Arena was just that. This 4,006 seat building was built in 1970 and believe me, did it ever look like something out of the helmet-less, straight-bladed wooden stick hockey era. It seemed as though every time I played there we were down 3-0 when the game began. By the time you had found your legs you were sitting on the bus leaving the rink. The building was nothing short of spectacular to play in, whether or not you were getting walloped.\n\n#3: ShoWare Center – Kent\n\nThe 6,500 seat home of the Seattle Thunderbirds was tucked away in Kent, Washington but it was a perfect venue for junior hockey. No matter if it was a sellout or 3,000 people in on a Friday night, it all sounded the same. Once Gary Glitter’s Rock & Roll Part 2 started playing to welcome the ‘Birds to the ice, you knew the crowd was waking up. The contours of the rink made you feel like you were playing on an ice surface half the normal size, plus you were getting physically dominated by the lineups Seattle put out each and every game. I am 99.99% sure that in the 8 times I played there I was put on my ass well over 50 times.\n\n#2: XFINITY Arena – Everett\n\nIf there was an award for loudest atmosphere in relation to the number of fans in an arena, then the home of the Everett Silvertips would win every single year. The 8,100 seat facility was always rocking. Whether it was Friday or Saturday night, you were going to need your earplugs. I played 13 games in this arena, and I’m not kidding when I say that EVERY time the ‘Tips skating out across their blue line the crowd would ring their cowbells as if they had just won the league championship, how amazing is that?! It seemed as though we played in 4 or 5 military appreciation night’s which made it that much louder with the crowd almost at capacity. I also vividly remember coach Don Hay drawing up a play late in a game during a timeout and me skating dumbfounded into the faceoff circle afterwards, not knowing the play, as I was too busy staring at the man directly behind the glass of our bench flipping me off with two beers in his hands (great multitasking). The icing on the cake was the P.A announcer’s, “ let’s play hockey!” at the drop of the puck to begin each period. The atmosphere the fans have created in Everett is fantastic.\n\n#1: Moda Center/Veterans Memorial Coliseum – Portland\n\nIf you were to tell me five years ago that the best atmosphere I’d be apart of in the WHL is a game in Portland, I would’ve laughed at you. Boy, was I ever wrong. It could’ve been the fact it felt like you were playing against the Harlem Globetrotters of hockey, but playing in either the Moda Center or the The Coliseum was treacherous. Both venues brought in about 10,000 fans for a hockey game and you heard it from every single one of them. One of my very minimal playoff experiences came at the Moda Center, which could easily be confused for a Trailblazers playoff game – the atmosphere was that good. At The Coliseum I played in an “outdoor” game where they would open up all the curtains around the arena and have the sun shining in through all the windows. The game was delayed an hour because it was so bright, and once it did commence, the second period was strictly dump-and-chase hockey. The Winterhawks also hold the title of having the greatest goal song/fan chant of all-time. “TNT” by ACDC would blare with all the fans standing and fist-pumping to “Oi! Oi! Oi! TNT!”\n\nCarter is a hockey player, formerly in the WHL for the Vancouver Giants, currently at the University of British Columbia.

Rightfully so, as there were six different teams ranked #1 in the AP Poll, including the preseason (Kansas on two separate occasions). But nobody could’ve predicted what we’ve all witnessed thus far. 2016 is bringing a whole new meaning to the moniker “March Madness.”\n\nThe First Round saw four, yes four, buzzer beating (or near-buzzer beating) games:\n\n1) Iowa-72 Temple-70 OT – Iowa seemingly attempted to give the game away, missing free throws down the stretch of regulation. However an offensive tap in by Adam Woodbury at the buzzer gave Iowa the win.\n\n2) Northern Iowa-75 Texas-72 – UNI, as a #11 seed, continued to be a dangerous non-power conference team come March as Paul Jesperson sunk an unworldly half-court shot for the win.\n\n3) Providence-70 USC-69 – Again, free throws were a factor in this game, with USC missing some important ones. Rodney Bullock canned a layup moments before the buzzer to give the Friars their first tournament win since 1997.\n\n4) St Joes-78 Cincinnati-76 – This wasn’t technically a buzzer beater, but was an unbuzzer-beater. Octavius Ellis appeared to tie the game with a dunk at the end of regulation but was called back after he didn’t get the shot off in time.\n\nAlso in Round 1, we saw the upsets of some prominent basketball programs. The likes of Baylor, Purdue, Arizona, West Virginia and Michigan State were all eliminated.\n\nThe Spartans, which many were slotting to win the National Championship, were outclassed by a high-flying Middle Tennessee State team. The Blue Raiders shot 58% from 3-point range en route to a 90-81 shocker against a Michigan State team that gave up more than 80 points just twice all season.\n\nOne of the most talented and supposed “dangerous” teams in Baylor was ousted by a Yale side making their first tournament appearance since 1962. They had never won a tournament game before their ousting of the Bears.\n\nWichita State thoroughly dominated Arizona wire-to-wire and handed the Wildcats a perplexing loss in a game that was never even close. Although upon closer inspection, this matchup shouldn’t have even happened in the first place as, according to their kenpom ranking*, Wichita State was the 12th best team in the country (Arizona came in at 16th).\n\nWest Virginia (a highly touted team this year which finished 2nd in an extremely competitive Big 12 conference) laid an egg against Stephen F Austin and was crushed by the Lumberjacks. Many analysts picked West Virginia to possibly match up with UNC in their regions final (much like us).\n\nAs for Purdue, the Boilermakers coughed up a 13 point lead with 3:33 left in the game and ended losing in double overtime to the Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans who last won a tournament game back in 1986.\n\nRound 2 continued to impress the viewers with a handful of close decisions. Wisconsin shocked #2 seeded Xavier on a Bronson Koenig buzzer beating 3 pointer, as the Badgers added to their recent tournament dominance.\n\nIronically, 2016’s tournament also had two teams deemed unworthy of even receiving tournament invites moving into the Sweet 16 (Gonzaga and Syracuse). ‘Cuse defeated an average Dayton team and Middle Tennessee on route to their arrival in the final 16 while the Zags beat Big East tournament champions Seton Hall in Round 1 and then trounced Utah 82-59. Also, ironically, these two teams were then slotted to play one another. #11 Gonzaga and #10 Syracuse are looking to become the lowest seeded team to make the Final Four since #11 VCU made it in 2011.\n\nLastly, the highlight of the tournament to date has to be the comeback Texas A&M mounted to take down Northern Iowa. Coming back from this type of deficit, in any level of organized basketball is simply unheard of. Down by 12 (57-69) with 44 seconds to go, Texas A&M went;\n\nLayup (69-59)\n\nSteal\n\nLayup (69-61)\n\nTimeout\n\nSteal\n\nDunk (69-63)\n\nForced turnover\n\n3 Pointer (69-66)\n\nConceded dunk (71-66)\n\nLayup and 1 (71-69)\n\nSteal\n\nLayup (71-71)\n\nTo tie up the game at 71-71.They then went on to win 92-88 in double OT. Epic. Check out the madness below:\n\nWith the upsets, Cinderellas, and buzzer beaters that we’ve illustrated here, this year’s edition of the NCAA Basketball Tournament has had a little bit of everything. And while you’ll find a more polished game at the NBA level, the excitement and action that is evident in every March Madness is unparalleled in sport.\n\nCarter is hockey player, formerly in WHL for the Vancouver Giants.

Read more about what the rankings are all about here.\n\nAs the season dwindles down, I have decided to take my aim at providing the cases for the potential award winners in the respective leagues. I’ll quickly touch on the ROY, while diving deeper into both CY races, as they remain the most intriguing of all, and of course round it out with my picks for AL and NL MVP (Yoenis for both).\n\n2015 has been deemed ‘the year of the rookie’ by many of those in the press, and rightfully so. Cubs super rookies trio – Bryant, Schwarber and Russell – to go along with Joc in L.A. and unexciting Matt Duffy in San Francisco have set the NL on fire, while the AL has provided us with their fair share of exciting young stars as well. Devon Travis of the Blue Jays jumped out to a terrific start, but multiple stints on the DL has hindered his otherwise promising season and has eliminated him from what could have been a ROY campaign in the American League. In lieu of Travis, two players immediately jump out to many. A pair of shortstops: Houston’s Carlos Correa and Cleveland’s Francisco Lindor. If we revisit this after game 162 we might have to change our minds and go with GREG BIRD YANKEE LEGEND, but for now, we will focus on these two studs (sorry Miguel Sano, you’ve been outstanding, but it’s a two man race).\n\nAMERICAN LEAGUE ROY\n\nWho should win: Francisco Lindor\n\nFrancisco Lindor has been elite this season. In 87 games, the switch hitting shortstop has amassed 3.7 WAR (leading all AL rookies) while providing great offense at the position with wRC+ of 127, including 10 jacks (the three best offensive shortstops this season are rookies). The Indians 2011 first rounder hasn’t only performed with the bat, but also with the glove. He has been among the top shortstops in defensive runs saved and UZR/150 (leading all rookies).\n\nWho will win: Carlos Correa\n\nThe Houston Astros took Carlos Correa 1st overall in the 2012 draft, and he has been so, so good ever since. Despite missing significant time with after breaking his leg in a freak sliding accident in A+ in 2014, Correa wasted no time getting to the big leagues. He started 2015 in AA, and was Barry Bonds in his 29 games, and produced at a well above average level in AAA. Houston has been a surprise to many all season long, and when they called Correa in June he joined in on it. Correa wasted no time, and has been terrific since. Offensively, he’s out performed Lindor to date, but only slightly, with a wRC+ of 133. Correa is second to Lindor in WAR among AL rookies at 3.1, and has provided average defense for the *potentially* playoff-bound Astros. And that is the biggest distinction for Correa. He is playing playoff like baseball in September, whereas Lindor and the Indians will be on the outside looking in. Both have tremendously bright futures (although not as bright as GREG BIRD YANKEE LEGEND), but Correa will be crowned 2015 AL Rookie of the Year, becoming the 4th first overall pick to win the award (trivia fans: Bob Horner, Darryl Strawberry, and Bryce Harper).\n\nNATIONAL LEAGUE ROY\n\nOn the NL side, a race that was as hot as could be at the All Star break, has cooled down dramatically. If you tuned in to the 2015 Home Run Derby, you were treated to two of the most promising young sluggers in the game; Kris Bryant and Joc Pederson. Bryant has been incredible and he should and will win this award, no rookie has come close (EXCEPT GREG BIRD YANKEE LEGEND). The rest of the NL rookie class includes unexciting Matt Duffy, one armed Randal Grichuk, the (once) heavy hitting Joc Pederson and the (now) one-legged Jung-ho Kang (Thanks, Chris Coghlan).\n\nKris Bryant has lived up to the massive expectations he had earned since being drafted out of the University of San Diego. The former 2nd overall pick has hit 26 home runs, sports a wRC+ of 139 and has been a 6 win player this season. Bryant and the Cubs have been so exciting this season, and will continue to be for many seasons to come as they seek their first World Series title since ‘Nam. Actually they haven’t won since before World War 1, which is ridiculous. I don’t think people talk enough about how ridiculous that is. I’m unsure if anyone on the planet is 107 years old. I digress. Go Cubs.\n\nAMERICAN LEAGUE CY YOUNG\n\nThe AL CY race has been fairly flat-lined for most of the season. Dallas Keuchel has emerged as a top of the rotation guy for a *potentially* playoff-bound Astros team, while David Price has been David Price and Chris Sale has been Chris Sale.\n\nThe main criteria I’ve chosen to compare the pitchers are as follows: FIP, K/9, BB/9, HR/9 and RA9-WAR. I cannot stress how important it is to use measures that show how well a pitcher has pitched, independent of the defense playing behind them. If you want a better explanation of which each of the meaning of these, please explore fangraphs.com glossary on pitching (http://www.fangraphs.com/library/pitching/fdp/).\n\nAnyone who routinely watches Toronto Blue Jays’ broadcast (anyone…?) will painfully listen to Buck and Pat talk about how much energy Price has brought to the Jays since being acquired at the deadline. They like to credit him with the success of the four other starters, it seems (I’m kidding, but it certainly feels like it). Unfortunately for David, I will not be evaluating his teammate’s success in any way; in fact I’m going to avoid measuring any stat that has anything to do with Price’s teammates at all.\n\nThat being said, there is no disputing Price’s dominance since coming over to Toronto.\n\n2015 Tigers: 3.07 FIP, 8.51 K/9, 1.79 BB/9, 0.80 HR/9\n\n2015 Jays: 2.10 FIP, 10.51 K/9, 2.21 BB/9, 0.39 HR/9\n\nTotal: 2.76 FIP, 9.15 K/9, 1.92 BB/9, 0.67 HR/9, 7.4 RA9-WAR\n\nPrice has been more dominant in his new uniform, while logging the second most innings in the AL this season. The Jays, with the help of acquiring Price and Tulowitzki, and MVP caliber performances in the second from Donaldson and Edwing, have leapfrogged the New York Yankees in the AL East and have a 2.5 game lead with 11 to play. It looks like they will be making their first appearance in the playoffs since 1993 (longest drought in professional sports).\n\nChris Sale is having another dominant season. This guy is emerging as possibly the best threat to take Kershaw’s title of best pitcher in baseball as far as consistently dominating year to year. Unfortunately, much like former Cy Young winner Felix Hernandez went through, he’s playing on a dreadful team every season.\n\nSale’s 2015 numbers are nasty: 2.67 FIP, 11.97 K/9, 1.85 BB/9, 0.97 HR/9, 3.7 RA9-WAR\n\nHe leads the AL in K/9 by more than a whole strikeout, as well as leading in FIP and xFIP. Sale’s conventional numbers (W-L and ERA) don’t look so great. He’s 12-10 with a 3.47 ERA. He plays on a terrible White Sox (literally one of the worst group of position players in MLB history – their first half position player total WAR was -3.2), and in a ballpark that plays like Williamsport; thus his FIP- is 3rd in baseball. His stuff might be the nastiest, his true talent might be the highest, but Sale again seems to be just about the 2nd or 3rd best pitcher in the AL this season, not quite the best.\n\nDallas Keuchel has been the breakout story of the season: 2.89 FIP, 8.43 K/9, 1.93 BB/9, 0.66 HR/9, 7.6 RA9-WAR. He’s emerged as the ace of a young Astro’s team that performing above expectations and looking like they’ll *potentially* be at least in the Wild Card game, sooner than many thought. He has been a workhorse for Houston, leading the AL in innings pitched. His groundball rate remains one of the highest in the game (only Brett Anderson is higher). Hitters have only managed hard contact off Keuchel 20.5% of the balls put in play, which is the lowest among qualified starting pitchers in all of baseball. Averaging over 7 innings per start, and generating ground balls like a coach hitting fungo during BP, Keuchel is as close to Crash Davis’ dream as anyone.\n\nWho should win: Dallas Keuchel\n\nHe has been rather consistent throughout the entire season and has the gaudy conventional numbers that voters love (18-8 with a 2.51 ERA). He leads the AL in RA9-WAR, and should be the sure bet to start a potential Wild Card game for Houston.\n\nWho will win: David Price\n\nThe narrative is so strong right now. As mentioned above, his absolutely outstanding performance since coming over to the Jays as given him a lot of momentum in the Cy race. Good luck to AA in his quest to re-sign David.\n\nNATIONAL LEAGUE CY YOUNG\n\nNow the fun begins. Clayton Kershaw has won 3 of the last 4 CY’s, as well as last year’s NL MVP and is making another strong case for his fourth. Among him are teammate Zack Greinke and Cubs ace Jake Arrieta. There are others (Scherzer, MadBum, DeGrom, Cole) but these three are the only guys with legitimate chances of winning.\n\nPitcher A: 2.09 FIP, 11.39 K/9, 1.67 BB/9, 0.59 HR/9 and 7.1 RA9-WAR\n\nPitcher B: 2.44 FIP, 9.17 K/9, 2.00 BB/9, 0.42 HR/9 and 8.5 RA9-WAR\n\nPitcher C: 2.77 FIP, 8.02 K/9, 1.56 BB/9, 0.56 HR/9 and 9.3 RA9-WAR\n\n1999 Pedro: 1.39 FIP, 13.2 K/9, 1.56 BB/9, 0.38 HR/9, and 10 RA9-WAR\n\nI added Pedro for absolutely no reason other than to remind you of his dominance.\n\nAnyways, I often like to evaluate players objectively by doing this. We have the three top pitchers in NL above. Can you guess whom is whom? Kershaw, Arrieta, Greinke. I’m not sure you can really argue against any one of them. They’ve all been excellent this season. One could obnoxiously argue that Kershaw was better last season, and they would be obviously right. But that shouldn’t discredit him. He has been absolutely outstanding again, striking out more hitters than he ever has (flirting with 300 k’s). Greinke has been ridiculous all season long. Every time he pitches it seems to be 7 innings of scoreless baseball. It’s magical to watch. However, he doesn’t have the independent stats that Arrieta and Kershaw do. Arrieta threw a no-hitter against the Dodgers – which really brings this thing full circle, hey? – and has been nearly unhittable in all his other second half starts as well (hitters hitting .157 in second half).\n\nWho should win: Clayton Kershaw\n\nHe has been the best pitcher in baseball for five seasons, and was the best pitcher in baseball again in this season alone. Numbers don’t lie.\n\nWho will win: Jake Arrieta\n\nKershaw’s better independent numbers will get overshadowed by Arrieta’s 20-6 and 1.88 ERA. Voting will probably finish Arrieta, Greinke, Kershaw and will be the closest since 2009. Arrieta will win a Wild Card game against the Pirates and the Cubs will face the Blue Jays in the World Series.\n\nAMERICAN LEAGUE MVP\n\nIt’s a two horse race and it’s neck and neck. The reigning MVP and greatest player on the planet, Mike Trout against Canada’s superhero, Josh Donaldson. Gregg Zaun has been lobbying against Donaldson for months and Gregg Zaun is usually right about everything, always. But, Gregg with two g’s has no grounds for arguing against the Jays third baseman and master of the man bun. He leads the AL in WAR, albeit 8.1 to Trout’s 8.0. Trout has 40 dingers, Donaldson has 39. Where Trout trumps Donaldson on offense, Josh provides value by playing excellent defense. Trout strikes out more, but also walks much more and is more powerful (.291 ISO vs .274 ISO). Trout’s wOBA is higher, his wRC+ is higher. As good as Donaldson has been offensively this season, Trout has been a little (sometimes significantly) better. I’m torn. These are two of my favourite players to watch. They are incredible.\n\nWho should win: Josh Donaldson\n\nJosh Donaldson has been slightly more valuable than Trout this season, and has all the things that shouldn’t matter but for some reason do matter to BBWAA going for him. Donaldson has driven in 120 runs, and has been the best player on a team on their way to winning the division and making their first appearance in the postseason in 22 years. Mike Trout has Clayton Kershaw syndrome, in that he may be disadvantaged by his prior years of absolute awesomeness; although he didn’t suffer from this last season, winning the MVP in his worst statistical year of his career. He’s been better than last year, but Donaldson has been slightly, just slightly, more valuable this season.\n\nWho will win: Josh Donaldson\n\nMuch like Price, the narrative is so strong. Donaldson had been scorching Earth in the second half before his recent mini-slump and has led the Jays to the top of the AL East standings. Jays playoff bound while the Angels will have to fight until the last day of the season to possibly get into a playoff spot hurts Trout’s case. Donaldson wins in an extremely close vote. Or maybe they tie.\n\nNATIONAL LEAGUE MVP\n\nLol. To really appreciate Bryce Harper please go here.\n\nThis is a list of the best offensive seasons since 1908 (the last year the Cubs won the World Series) by wRC+. Bryce Harper is sitting in 23rd place…ALL TIME. Four of those seasons belong to Barry Bonds – who was the most ridiculous player of the last two and next fifty generations. Seven…SEVEN of those seasons belong to The Babe. That puts us at eleven, half of the 22 ahead of Harper. Ted Williams owns six of these seasons. Basically what I am getting at is there aren’t many players – seven to be exact – that have had a better season than Bryce Harper in 2015. Here’s the craziest part: only one of those seasons were from a player as young as Bryce Harper is. In 1941, Ted Williams finished with a wRC+ of 221. He turned 23 on August 30th that year. Harper turns 23 on October 16th this year. Baffling. To emphasis one final time, wRC+ is a measure of how well a player has performed offensively, with 100 being MLB average, and every one point higher is one percent better than average. Bryce Harper, at age 22, has put up a wRC+ of 206. He has been 106% better than league average. He has been 98% better than Carlos Gonzalez. He has been 69% better than Mets cult leader Yoenis Cespedes. 64% better than GREG BIRD YANKEE LEGEND. Harper is absolutely sensational. HOWEVER…the Washington Nationals are not making the postseason, and thus; by rule of BBWAA (as Mike Trout knows all too well) he cannot be named NL MVP! So, as a result we must discover our NL MVP from one of the remaining teams in playoff contention.\n\nThe candidates include: Votto? No. Goldschmidt? No. Pollock? No. Posey? No. The five best players in the NL this season aren’t going to be in the playoffs. That’s insane. BBWAA might need to make an exception on this ridiculous rule of thumb, otherwise rookie Kris Bryant may be named NL MVP. I’m kidding of course. Bryce Harper might receive first place votes in the AL this season, he’s been that good. It’s a no-brainer. Who should, would, will, is going to win: Harper.\n\nBryan is a former draft pick of the New York Yankees.

Now, at Hit the Cut, we like to see ourselves as innovators in terms of the sporting community, striving to produce modern day “stats” and “ideas” towards viewing each sport through a new lens. During the past few years the MLB has been overthrown by “advanced stats,” most notably through the whole Billy Beane-Moneyball craze. More and more MLB managers, general managers, scouting staffs and front office buffs are using advanced stats to evaluate draft-eligible prospects, but more importantly their own rosters. Since there is a stat for virtually everything in today’s game, we have spun our wheels and invented our own take on what a 5 tool player truly is, today. Using the foundation of the 5 tools (as listed above) we compiled five crucial statistics inserted into one formula to create a super-stat. Of the five stats, four are of the offensive variety, and one of the defensive variety. Through the remainder of this article we will break down each stat, explain why we chose this stat and end by providing you, the reader, with knowledge of who we deem the top true 5 tool players. Here we go:\n\nOffensive Stat #1 – wOBA\n\nWeighted On-Base Average is the ultimate offensive stat. It is created on the basis that all hits are not equal and should have their own specific value. Compared to OBP (On-Base Percentage) which gives every time reaching base the same value; whether that’s a single, double, walk, hit by pitch, etc or SLG (Slugging Percentage) which has a double as twice as valuable as a single, or a triple three times as valuable, etc.\n\nHow to calculate wOBA from Fan Graphs: The wOBA formula for the 2014 season was: wOBA = (0.689×uBB + 0.722×HBP + 0.892×1B + 1.283×2B + 1.635×3B + 2.135×HR) / (AB + BB – IBB + SF + HBP) footnote\n\nOffensive Stat #2 – ISO\n\nIsolated Power is a measure of a player’s ability to hit for extra base power. Compared to stats like SLG and OBP which give you partial answers of how a player hits, ISO is a quick stat displaying the percentage of extra base hits a player gets.\n\nHow to calculate ISO three different ways from Fan Graphs: ISO = SLG – AVG ISO = ((2B) + (2*3B) + (3*HR)) / AB ISO = Extra Bases / At-Bats\n\nOffensive Stat #3 – Off\n\nOffense is a stat that shows how a player is relative to league averages, taking into account Batting Runs Above Average and Base Running Runs Above Average. It is a park adjusted statistic and shows how valuable offensively a player is to their team. We really liked Off here, because it puts baserunning (one of the five traditional tools) into the player-value equation.\n\nHow to calculate Off from Fan Graphs: Off = Batting Runs Above Average + Base Running Runs Above Average\n\nOffensive Stat #4 – O-S%\n\nOut of Zone Swing Percentage is a plate discipline stat that measures the amount of pitches out of the strike zone that a hitter swings at. We noticed that a major facet of the game, in plate discipline, was not one of the traditional five tools, yet it factors into the game more than a few of these aforementioned tools.P late discipline stats are important because they show what type of hitter a player is (aggressive, passive, etc) and if they have a particularly good eye for each pitch up to bat.\n\nHow to calculate O-S% from Fan Graphs: O-Swing% = Swings at pitches outside the zone / pitches outside the zone\n\nDefensive Stat #1 – Def\n\nDefense is an all-around defense measuring statistic, which takes into consideration the value of positional fielding average and positional value in relation to other postions. Rather than just looking at the value of a player’s arm, we chose to take a more broad defensive approach and Def establishes that quite well.\n\nHow to calculate Def from Fan Graphs: Def = Fielding Runs Above Average + positional adjustment\n\nMethods and Ranking\n\nTo put all five of these statistical categories into one metric was no easy task as one of our main goals was to ensure that each stat was valued equally in the final calculation. Also adding to this difficulty was the fact that some of the stats are presented as percentages (ISO, wOBA, O-Swing%), while others come in the form of runs (Off, Def). How we addressed this was to represent the percentage stats as a deviation from the league average (this gave us values that ranged between -1 and 1). We did the same thing with the runs stats, but it became evident that, because of their comparatively larger values, if a player excelled in Off or Def, the ranking would sway in their favour. To address this, we scaled down the Off and Def so their range of values was comparable to the other stats used. Once these values were added, we had our final number, which we referred to as “tooliness”. The “tooliness” ranking of players from the beginning of the 2012 MLB season to now (games up to and including June 8, 2015) are presented below (for length concerns, only the top 25 players are included; full rankings can be seen at the Google Sheet linked at the bottom of the page).\n\nRank Name ISO* wOBA* Off** Def** O-Swing%* Tooliness 1 Mike Trout 0.615 0.250 1.245 0.058 0.078 2.246 2 Miguel Cabrera 0.640 0.278 0.914 -0.148 -0.049 1.635 3 Andrew McCutchen 0.371 0.220 0.926 -0.026 0.058 1.548 4 Giancarlo Stanton 0.788 0.192 0.579 -0.034 -0.022 1.503 5 Paul Goldschmidt 0.544 0.217 0.706 -0.130 0.065 1.401 6 Jose Bautista 0.621 0.186 0.510 -0.045 0.092 1.364 7 Edwin Encarnacion 0.704 0.174 0.557 -0.236 0.071 1.270 8 Joey Votto 0.269 0.232 0.561 -0.069 0.147 1.141 9 Troy Tulowitzki 0.467 0.226 0.264 0.096 0.045 1.098 10 Josh Donaldson 0.301 0.106 0.378 0.180 0.061 1.026 11 Buster Posey 0.160 0.146 0.492 0.153 0.046 0.996 12 Chris Davis 0.711 0.106 0.335 -0.135 -0.061 0.957 13 David Ortiz 0.608 0.165 0.295 -0.180 0.039 0.926 14 Bryce Harper 0.390 0.137 0.396 0.011 -0.045 0.890 15 Adrian Beltre 0.256 0.143 0.416 0.095 -0.094 0.816 16 Ryan Braun 0.474 0.149 0.328 -0.073 -0.087 0.791 17 Brandon Moss 0.583 0.103 0.301 -0.155 -0.055 0.776 18 Anthony Rizzo 0.358 0.125 0.314 -0.038 -0.016 0.744 19 Carlos Gomez 0.301 0.082 0.294 0.183 -0.116 0.744 20 Robinson Cano 0.166 0.125 0.427 0.059 -0.062 0.715 21 Nelson Cruz 0.519 0.110 0.235 -0.172 -0.003 0.688 22 Yasiel Puig 0.256 0.183 0.305 -0.019 -0.039 0.685 23 Matt Holliday 0.160 0.140 0.486 -0.142 -0.006 0.638 24 David Wright 0.038 0.091 0.314 0.124 0.066 0.634 25 Todd Frazier 0.320 0.064 0.217 0.077 -0.049 0.628\n\n*These stats are deviations from the league average for the measured time period. **These stats are deviations from the league average for the measured time period which are also scaled down.\n\nResults\n\nAs the table shows, your “expected” players are at the top and throughout the results we see many recognizable names.\n\n1) Mike Trout – There’s no surprise whatsoever to see Trout as the leader for our statistic. Since he has come into the big leagues Trout has absolutely raked at the plate, leading the league in wRC+, runs scored, Off, WAR, and amongst the top 5 in several other categories. He’s won an MVP and finished second in voting twice (both to Miguel Cabrera). Arguably the best player in the game today, Trout continues to shine as the poster boy for MLB baseball.\n\n2) Miguel Cabrera – The king of consistency himself, Cabrera isn’t far behind Trout. Due to his lack of defensive ability “Miggy” takes some knocks but what he can do at the plate is nothing sort of extraordinary. Having hit 25 homeruns and driven in 100 RBI in every full season he has played (2004-14) Cabrera is a top example of a quality hitter. He’s the leader in wOBA, RBI, and HR since 2012.\n\n3) Andrew McCutchen – If you want to talk about player’s that do everything for their team, then McCutchen is your guy. Easily the top 5 tool player in the National League, ‘Cutch has enjoyed major success since coming into the MLB in 2009. SInce 2012, he’s 2nd in WAR and Off (both behind Trout) and 3rd in wRC+ (behind Trout and Cabrera). There’s no question he’s one of the top MLBers today.\n\nCarter is hockey player in WHL for the Vancouver Giants.
