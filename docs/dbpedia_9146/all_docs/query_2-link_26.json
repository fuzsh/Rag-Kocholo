        "text": "The Arizona Rattlers are playing in the Indoor Football League in 2017, their first season in the league.\n\nEach week, azcentral sports will preview the matchup and recap the game on this page.\n\nWe are currently moving the Rattlers scouts and recaps to a new home. Please be sure to follow that page as this page will be phased out soon.\n\nIt’s the midway point in the Rattlers’ first season in the Indoor Football League, and more flaws than strengths were on display in a 60-51 loss to the Spokane Empire in front of 12,725 on Saturday night that dropped them to 1-3 at home.\n\nThe Rattlers didn’t lose inside Talking Stick Resort Arena last year in their final season playing in the Arena Football League. Their only loss in the Valley was in the ArenaBowl to the Philadelphia Soul, but that game was moved to Glendale because the Mercury needed the Phoenix arena for a WNBA game.\n\n“We’re one and three at home,” coach Kevin Guy said. “I didn’t think the Rattlers would ever be in that situation. We also have played some of the best teams at home. But there’s no excuse for it. We’ve got to win at home.”\n\nThe Rattlers (4-4), for the most part, owned Spokane at home in their history. But that was when the team was called the Shock and was playing in the AFL.\n\nNow the Empire (6-2), Spokane had a one-year head start into the net-less IFL, while the Rattlers (4-4) basically overhauled their roster after their 24th season in the AFL with new quarterbacks, running backs, linemen and mostly new receivers.\n\nBut defensive backs Arkeith Brown and Allen “Bubba” Chapman are veterans of the AFL game with the Rattlers, and they weren’t able to make plays against Charles Dowdell, who threw six touchdown passes, two each to Bryan Pray and Devonn Brown, on Saturday.\n\n“We could not make a play on a ball to save our life,” Guy said. “We’ve got to get mentally tougher. I’m sure when I look at the film, it’s going to be technique. We went in with a game plan, felt good about it. If you look at first couple of drives, we were stopping them. You’ve to give Coach Shak (Adam Shackleford) credit. He had his team ready to play.”\n\nAfter making a stop to start the game, the Rattlers were penalized on their first pass, a big play that was returned and put them at their 3. Quarterback Cody Sokol, making his fourth straight start, was stopped in the end zone for a safety on a read-option run. That turned into a nine-point turnaround after the Empire then scored a touchdown on their next possession.\n\nThat put the Rattlers into catch-up mode the rest of the game. Sokol threw a career-high six touchdown passes and gave Arizona the lead a couple of times before the Empire went from man-coverage to zone. The Rattlers only made one stop in the second half, and that came when the Empire were trying to run out the clock in the final minute with a nine-point lead.\n\nSokol, who was 22 of 34 for 252 yards, misfired on his last eight throws, his last one intercepted.\n\n“There are plays you wish you could get back,” Sokol said. “Every game, you wish you could get back a couple of plays. But you can’t whine about it. You’ve got to keep fighting.”\n\nGuy has a decision to make now. Does he stick with Sokol or go back to Darron Thomas at quarterback?\n\nHe gave both quarterbacks four games to see who the right guy is to replace Nick Davila, who set numerous Rattlers passing records and led them to three consecutive ArenaBowl titles, before retiring and becoming a Rattlers assistant once the team made the move into the IFL.\n\nPreview\n\nThe season hits the halfway point on Saturday when the Rattlers (4-3) play host to the Spokane Empire (5-2) at 6 p.m., at Talking Stick Resort Arena with first place in the Intense Conference at stake.\n\nThe game is being televised by FSAZ Plus.\n\nHere are three things about the Rattlers this week:\n\nWho runs the offense?\n\nWill it be Cody Sokol or Darren Thomas?\n\nThomas, the mobile quarterback who became a big name in college leading Oregon, started the first four games. Sokol, the local guy who played at Phoenix Desert Vista High and Scottsdale Community College, will be making his fourth start Saturday.\n\nCoach Kevin Guy said he wanted to give each quarterback four starts before settling on one for the rest of the season.\n\nIs there a need for a jumbo receiver?\n\nGuy's three-year championship run was marked with tall, strong receivers, guys like Maurice Purify, Rod Windsor, Tysson Poots and Kerry Reed.\n\nThis is a smaller group of receivers than what the Rattlers rolled out the last seven years with Anthony Amos now the main target.\n\nPart of the reason Guy hasn't had to rely on that big receiver to take over, making big plays after catches, is because of the success of the run game. The Rattlers average 107 yards rushing per game, second only to six-time defending IFL champion Sioux Falls Storm (118.3). The Rattlers' 116 carries are second in the league to Sioux Falls and their 21 rushing TDs are also second.\n\nSokol only threw 10 passes, completing six, one for a TD, last week when the Rattlers scored 73 points against Salt Lake City, with Darrell Monroe and receiver Jamal Miles combining for eight rushing scores.\n\nRELATED: Indoor Football League standings\n\nWhen does Borel return?\n\nThe Rattlers quickly figured out this is no longer a 99 percent passing league. It's almost 50-50 pass-run, and the Rattlers still are adjusting to stopping the run. They rank eighth out of 10 teams on rush defense, giving up 86.6 yards a game. They're seventh in sacks with just eight, and eighth in turnover margin at minus-2.\n\nGuy always takes pride in being more physical and winning the turnover battle. But that may not get turned around until defensive end Damien Borel is medically cleared to play. Borel was the Rattlers' best pass rusher last year before a knee injury took him out early in last year's ArenaBowl loss to Philadelphia. Borel is a game-changer, possibly the one guy who takes the Rattlers over the edge and gives them hope of ending Sioux Falls' IFL dynasty.\n\nThe Rattlers need him to return.\n\nUPCOMING GAMES\n\nApril 29\n\nWho: Rattlers vs. Green Bay Blizzard\n\nWhere: Talking Stick Resort Arena, Phoenix\n\nWhen: 6 p.m.\n\nTV: FSAZ Plus\n\nMay 5\n\nWho: Rattlers at Cedar Rapids Titans\n\nWhere: U.S. Cellular Center, Cedar Rapids, Iowa\n\nWhen: 5 p.m.\n\nTV: Indoor Football League on YouTube\n\nMay 12\n\nWho: Rattlers at Spokane Empire\n\nWhere: Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena, Spokane, Wash.\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nTV: Indoor Football League on YouTube\n\nMay 20\n\nWho: Rattlers vs. Salt Lake Screaming Eagles\n\nWhere: Talking Stick Resort Arena, Phoenix\n\nWhen: 6 p.m.\n\nTV: FSAZ Plus\n\nMay 28\n\nWho: Rattlers vs. Nebraska Danger\n\nWhere: Talking Stick Resort Arena, Phoenix\n\nWhen: 3 p.m.\n\nTV: FSAZ Plus\n\nJune 3\n\nWho: Rattlers at Spokane Empire\n\nWhere: Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena, Spokane, Wash.\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nTV: Indoor Football League on YouTube\n\nJune 11\n\nWho: Rattlers vs. Cedar Rapids Titans\n\nWhere: Talking Stick Resort Arena, Phoenix\n\nWhen: 3 p.m.\n\nTV: FSAZ Plus\n\nJune 16\n\nWho: Rattlers at Colorado Crush\n\nWhere: Budweiser Events Center, Loveland, Colo.\n\nWhen: 5 p.m.\n\nRattlers 73, Salt Lake 60\n\nDarrell Monroe ran for five touchdowns, Jamal Miles added three more rushing scores, and the Rattlers (4-3) secured to a 73-60 win over the host Salt Lake Screaming Eagles on Friday night. Rattlers quarterback Cody Sokol was 6-of-10 passing for 102 yards, one touchdown and one interception. Arkeith Brown and Allen Chapman each had an interception to help Arizona hold on to the win.\n\nPreview\n\nRattlers coach Kevin Guy likes to call them \"Thunder\" and \"Lightning.\"\n\nKetrich Harmon, the bigger of the two backs, has a better name:\n\n\"Thunder Storm,\" he says.\n\nHarmon and fellow running back Darrell Monroe have been a wrecking crew in the first six games of the Rattlers' first foray into the run-friendly Indoor Football League, where quarterbacks often have to be ready to run and running backs are looked at as the same way they are in the outdoor game. They're not just there as the last means of protection for the quarterback in this 50-yard game.\n\n\"We're fighting for that No.1 rushing spot,\" Harmon said. \"We're in the top four in the league right now.\"\n\nHarmon leads the IFL in average rushing yards a game with 50 in the four games he has played. He has 200 rushing yards and four touchdowns on 45 carries. Monroe is fourth in the league with an average of 44 yards in his four games played. He has rushed for 176 yards and two TDs on 36 carries.\n\nLast week, in a 39-36 win at Nebraska, Guy, for the first time, rotated both backs. Monroe ran for 39 yards on nine carries, Harmon for 34 yards on nine carries.\n\n\"We're going to do a little Thunder and Lightning action there,\" Guy said. \"We have two good backs. We want to give them opportunities to play. That's an adjustment I'm going through. ... They're both weapons. They're both going to see plenty of playing time.\"\n\nThe Rattlers (3-3) return to the road to play the Salt Lake City Screaming Eagles (1-4) on Friday night at 6 p.m., at the Maverik Center. The Screaming Eagles receive play-calling input from fans. They're coached by former Arena Football League coach Matt Sauk, who had a stint as a quarterback in Guy's first season with the Rattlers in 2008. The game is streamed live on YouTube.\n\nRattlers 39, Danger 36\n\nSawyer Petre made a 20-yard field goal with two seconds remaining to lift the Rattlers to a 39-36 win over the Nebraska Danger in Grand Island, Neb.\n\nArizona quarterback Cody Sokol completed 17 of 30 passes for 165 yards and four touchdowns to lead the Rattlers.\n\nUp next: Rattlers (3-3) at Salt Lake Screaming Eagles (1-5), Friday, 6 p.m. | Season schedule\n\nRattlers-Danger preview\n\nThe Rattlers (2-3) will stick with Cody Sokol at quarterback as they try to get to .500 in Nebraska on Friday night against the Danger (4-2) in an Intense Conference matchup. Kickoff is set for 5 p.m. and will be streamed live on YouTube\n\nSokol, who hadn't started a football game since leading Louisiana Tech to a 2014 bowl win over Illinois, improved during his debut last week in a 60-53 home loss to Wichita Falls. He threw four touchdown passes, bouncing back after getting intercepted early in the game.\n\n\"Now I know how to really prepare going into the game,\" said Sokol, who played at Phoenix Desert Vista High and Scottsdale Community College. \"I'm excited to get back out there.\"\n\nThe Danger are coming off a 42-36 win over the Spokane Empire, another former Arena Football League team. Patrick McCain completed 12 of 17 passes for 52 yards and three TDs and ran for 27 yards and a score on 13 carries.\n\nWichita Falls 60, Rattlers 53\n\nCody Sokol hadn’t played a full football game since he led Louisiana Tech to a bowl victory in 2014.\n\nSokol needed a half to get used to the quicker Indoor Football League pace Saturday, and by the time he found himself in a groove, he had the Rattlers leading one of the top teams by eight points in the final quarter.\n\nBut Wichita Falls quarterback Charles McCullum continued to shred a flat defense and maneuvered the Nighthawks to a late touchdown and a 60-53 victory before 10,879 fans at Talking Stick Resort Arena.\n\nThe loss spoiled a franchise-record rushing effort by Ketrich Harmon, who ran for 123 yards on 20 carries. He had two scoring runs and had a 39-yard scoring run called back by a penalty.\n\nAfter quarterback Darron Thomas struggled in last week’s 30-29 win in Green Bay, coach Kevin Guy decided this week to go with the local kid, Sokol, who starred at Phoenix Desert Vista High and Scottsdale Community College.\n\nSokol bounced around in the Arena Football League, getting very little playing time, before catching on this year with the Rattlers.\n\nHe showed rust, especially early when the 25-second play clock wound down and the Rattlers were hit with a delay penalty and had to burn a timeout.\n\n“I think the pace definitely is a lot quicker,” said Sokol, who completed 15 of 28 passes for 224 yards and four touchdowns with one interception in his Rattlers debut. “When you’re sitting there watching it, you don’t realize how fast it is going. A lot of it has to do with that 25-second play clock. I had to get my feet wet and bounce back.”\n\nGuy said he will have to look at the tape first to determine whether Sokol is the quarterback he goes with moving forward.\n\nBut the Rattlers are sitting at 2-3 and now head to Nebraska for a game next week.\n\nWichita Falls (5-1) bounced back from its first loss to six-time defending IFL champion Sioux Falls, showing off the offense that made it the highest-scoring team in the league before being held to fewer than 30 points to the Storm.\n\nMcCullum, the top-rated quarterback in the league, was 20 of 27 for 256 yards and seven TDs. He also had 18 yards on two runs.\n\nGuy blamed this loss more on the defense that didn’t make a stop in the second half.\n\n“I’m very disappointed with how we played defensively,” Guy said. “We’ve played better defense here. For whatever reasons, we weren’t getting it done. We’ll look at the tape. But the bottom line, it just looked like we struggled covering their receivers. Their receivers were better than our coverage.”\n\nNobody caught more than six passes, but McCullum spread it out among Jolly Jordan (three TD catches), Phillip Barnett, Tyron Laughinghouse and Angelo Pease for TDs.\n\nAfter the Nighthawks sacked Sokol and forced the Rattlers to try a long field goal that was wide, they went 45 yards, using up 1 minute, 30 seconds, before McCullum found Jolly for his third TD from 6 yards out with three second left to break a 53-53 tie.\n\nJamal Miles returned the kickoff to midfield before he was stopped as time ran out.\n\nGuy said he wanted to evaluate Sokol at this point in the season. Thomas ended up not dressing out.\n\n\"We needed to see what he brings to the table,\" Guy said. \"We missed some passes last game in Green Bay. I felt we should have been two or three touchdowns out in front of them. He's got to go through his growing pains. He'll have to see the tape and get better. I thought he was a competitor tonight and he did some good things. At the same time, we're going to have to settle him down a little bit and see the field better.\"\n\nRattlers-Nighthawks preview\n\nThe Rattlers (2-2) return home Saturday at 6 p.m. to face the Wichita Falls Nighthawks (4-1), who are considered among the upper echelon of teams in the Indoor Football League.\n\nCoach Kevin Guy would rank Wichita Falls up there with the six-time defending champion Sioux Falls Storm.\n\n\"I expect to see them compete for a championship,\" Guy said. \"Their quarterback is the reigning MVP of the league. I believe they're the No. 1 scoring offense coming into the game. They also have a group that's been together for a few years. We've got our work cut out for us.\"\n\nThe Nighthawks are coming off a 55-21 loss to Sioux Falls, but QB Charles McCullum ranks first in the league in yards per game (213.2) and touchdown passes (22).\n\nThe Rattlers should have running back Darrell Monroe back after he missed last week's 30-29 win at Green Bay for the delivery of his child. Ketrich Harmon has done a good job at running back. He has 62 yards in two games. Defensive back Adam Sauder leads the IFL with 10 tackles per game.\n\nThe game is televised live on Fox Sports Arizona Plus.\n\nSaturday, March 26\n\nRattlers 30, Green Bay 29\n\nThe Rattlers (2-2) won their first road IFL game 30-29 over the Green Bay Blizzard at the Resch Center in Green Bay, Wis., on Sunday.\n\nRattlers running back Ketrich Harmon rushed 13 times for 50 yards and two touchdowns, while quarterback Darron Thomas threw for 85 yards and a touchdown, to go along with a rushing touchdown.\n\nThe Rattlers defense held the Blizzard to minus-8 yards rushing and recorded five tackles for loss, including two sacks, one by Chris McAllister and the other by Justin Martin and Josh Gordon. Arkeith Brown also intercepted Green Bay QB Matt Behrendt.\n\nPreview\n\nRattlers (1-2) at Green Bay Blizzard (2-2)\n\nThis game will be streamlined live on YouTube. The Rattlers are coming off their second bye week in a month. They're taking on a franchise that has no Arena Football League history, but gave birth in the af2, which was considered the minor leagues of the AFL in the 2000s. Rattlers coach Kevin Guy felt his team took a step forward after a 71-27 win over the Colorado Crush two weeks ago. But he's not ready to say they've arrived on the IFL scene.\n\n\"We've got a long ways to go,\" Guy said. \"We're developing mental toughness, and physical toughness. We're going to push the buttons.\"\n\nSaturday, March 11\n\nRattlers 71 vs. Colorado Rush 27\n\nDarrell Monroe rushed for 93 yards, quarterback Darron Thomas threw three touchdowns and the Rattlers (1-2) rolled to their first win in the Indoor Football League, burying the Colorado Crush 71-27 on Saturday at Talking Stick Resort Arena.\n\nAdam Sauder led Arizona with 15 total tackles and recovered a fumble, while Chris McCallister racked up two sacks and five tackles for loss.\n\nThe Rattlers now enter a bye week before returning to action March 26th against the Green Bay Blizzard.\n\nPreview\n\nColorado Crush (0-2) at Rattlers (0-2)\n\nWhen: 6 p.m.\n\nWhere: Talking Stick Resort Arena.\n\nTV/Radio: YouTube/The Fanatic 1580 AM, 99.3 FM.\n\nScouting report: Both teams look break through the win column. This is an Intense Conference game. The Crush is coming off a 54-36 loss to the Nebraska Danger. The Rattlers struggled to close out their first two games at Sioux Falls and at home against the Iowa Barnstormers. Rattlers receiver Demarius Washington was the IFL Offensive Player of the Year last season when he played for the Crush. Crush QB Sean Goldrich passed for 131 yards and two TDs last week. Rattlers QB Darron Thomas ranks fifth in the IFL in average passing yards at 172.5. He has thrown nine TD passes and three interceptions. Goldrich is seventh at 136.5.\n\nInteractive football taking IFL by storm\n\nThe Rattlers host the Colorado Crush on Saturday, one of two Indoor Football League teams that have fans involved in the play-calling.\n\nProject FANchise ownership group acquired the Crush in October. It also owns the Salt Lake City Screaming Eagles, which had a storm-the-field moment in the season opener after the team's first touchdown called by the fans, who pay a $9.99/month premium fee to be involved in in-game decisions.\n\nFans hopped the sideline boards and celebrated as if their team had just won the championship, even though the team was trailing by a touchdown even after the score. They were doing selfies with players, before order was restored and the game resumed.\n\nThrough an Eagles app, fans go to their iPad or iPhone and download the play in which they want run. It's not just Salt Lake City fans. Fans from 99 countries can sign up for it. Fans even voted on the team's colors, uniforms, logo.\n\nThis is ground-breaking stuff.\n\nBut can it work?\n\nWilliam McCarthy lasted just two games with the Screaming Eagles, before he was let go after a 42-41 win over Colorado. He has since been replaced by former Arena Football League coach Matt Sauk this week.\n\nIn a Screaming Eagles release on the IFL website, team President Thom Carter said, \"philosophical differences pertaining to the management of the team have led us to the decision to part ways with Coach McCarthy.\"\n\nRattlers coach and general manager Kevin Guy said he didn't know too much about the virtual coach concept those teams are doing.\n\n\"I don't know how it works, to be honest with you,\" Guy said.\n\nLast month, Project FANchise and the IFL launched Virtual Front Office in a partnership with all 10 IFL teams. Fans can sign up for the premium package for Virtual Coach, Virtual GM, or Virtual Scouting. It allows them have inside access to the team they choose.\n\n\"It's steps to get more fans involved,\" IFL Commissioner Mike Allshouse said. \"Every team is going to have its own comfortability level. Each team in the league goes at its own pace. See what's working. It's a business model. There is nothing wrong with more input and involvement with the teams. It pays great dividends.\"\n\nAsked about it, Guy said, \"I have no idea.\"\n\n\"If it doesn't make sense to me, I don't deal with it,\" he added.\n\nRattlers receiver Demarius Washington, who played for Colorado last season when he was the IFL Offensive Player of the Year when he had 1,223 receiving yards, said it would be difficult to run plays called by fans.\n\n\"To come in, if you were the coach, you want to call the plays to be successful,\" Washington said. \"To have the fans call the plays, I think that can be a little bit intriguing.\"\n\nAllshouse said it's too early \"to put a feather in our cap\" about it, but \"the early results are very encouraging.\"\n\n\"The sample size is not big enough,\" he said. \"The league as a whole has followed the lead (of the Crush and the Screaming Eagles). We were behind the technology. I think you're seeing the league and other member teams get more interactive with video or social media.\"\n\nSo far the biggest hit with the fans, Allshouse said, has been the YouTube live streaming of all games at no cost.\n\nSunday, Feb. 26\n\nBarnstormers 51, Rattlers 47\n\nTwo weeks into a new Rattlers era, coach Kevin Guy said he’ll have a lot of evaluating to do following Sunday’s 51-47 loss to the Iowa Barnstormers.\n\nThe Rattlers, among the elite for much of their 24 years in the Arena Football League where they won five championships, are now 0-2 in what many had considered a lesser league, the Indoor Football League.\n\nA respectable crowd of 11,438 showed up for the Rattlers’ home opener at Talking Stick Resort Arena, where it seemed the Rattlers would take apart the team they beat 20 years ago at home in the ArenaBowl.\n\nEven newly inducted Pro Football Hall of Famer Kurt Warner, who was on the losing end as the Barnstormers quarterback in that 1997 ArenaBowl, came out to be part of the pregame coin flip.\n\nBut after taking a 14-6 first-quarter lead on two Darron Thomas touchdown passes, the Rattlers were held scoreless until five seconds remained in the third quarter when Thomas found Anthony Amos for a 7-yard scoring pass.\n\nBy then, the Rattlers were scrambling back to try to catch the Barnstormers (1-1).\n\n“We have to execute better,” said Thomas, who ran for 61 yards on seven carries. “It just comes with hard work.”\n\nAmos is one of the only two holdovers from last year’s AFL Rattlers that reached the title game, and he served as a complementary piece.\n\n“We’ve got all new players,” Guy said. “It’s not necessarily the rules and the game. You’ve got all new players and you’re learning what they can and can’t do. We’ve only had a few weeks with them. We’re trying to figure out who can do what.\n\n“Right now we need some leaders. We need some guys to step up. Right now I feel like we’ve got too many individuals. It’s too quiet. Not enough energy on the sidelines, and guys stepping up like we’ve had in the past. That’s part of development. We’ve got to develop that right now as a team.”\n\nAfter Guy felt good about his defense in the 40-29 loss at six-time defending IFL champion Sioux Falls in the opener, he now has to reevaluate that part of the team after the way the Barnstormers ran on his team Sunday.\n\nQuarterback Travis Partridge completed 15 of 19 for 153 yards and four touchdowns. He also ran seven times for 25 yards and a score. Ryan Balentine, a wide receiver, ran nine times for 19 yards and two scores.\n\nGuy didn’t want to see 36 passes thrown, but that is what Thomas did, completing 20 for 189 yards and six touchdowns. But he had two passes intercepted with the last one coming with 24 seconds left.\n\nThomas showed flashes of what made him such a standout college player at Oregon with his legs. He took off for a 20-yard score, then found running back Ketrich Harmon for a 21-yard score in the final quarter when the Rattlers executed two onside kicks to overcome a two-touchdown deficit and regain the lead 47-44 with 5:51 left.\n\nBut a long kick return led to a 9-yard scoring pass from Partridge to Brady Roland with 3:53 left for Iowa’s winning score.\n\nHarmon, starting at running back for the first time, fumbled two handoffs from Thomas. The Rattlers lost one of those fumbles.\n\n“We need to look at our defenses and see if we’re putting them in the right positions,” Guy said. “The first thing I’m going to do is look at myself, critique myself, then we’ll move to the players.
