It opened in 1954, at the Stolley Park Rd.\n\nHistory of Fonner Park\n\n1953 – The Hall County Livestock Improvement Association purchased the site in April 1953. It was originally purchased to make it a permanent home for the Hall County Fair. Its name originated after August L. “Gus” Fonner, its original landowner. This same group of businessmen planned to build a racetrack and grandstand facility shortly.\n\n1954 – First year of live thoroughbred horse racing with thirteen days of racing was held. Before its inaugural season (April 29, 1954), its first livestock exhibition in September was The Old Reliable Hereford Show and Sale. On April 29, 1954, it opened for pari-mutuel racing in Grand Isle.\n\n1956 – Al Swihart was appointed as General Manager of Fonner Park in January.\n\n1958 – In March, a new concourse, main entrance, canopy, and enclosing the grandstand with glass was completed.\n\n1959 – Gus Fonner passed away.\n\n1962 – A mezzanine was added to the grandstand.\n\n1962 to 1968 – The seven additional barns were constructed.\n\n1965 – 100 ft. was added to the south end of the grandstand. I extended the grandstand and added a new paddock, jockey’s quarters, first aid station, general offices, and inside rail.\n\n1966 – New paddocks, jockey quarters, and general offices were added.\n\n1970 – Big Red Barn was built, followed by a clubhouse, grandstand seating, an indoor quarter-mile training track, and other amenities.\n\n1972 – Fonner Park Clubhouse was added – the first in the State.\n\n1975 – An electronic tote board was added.\n\n1976 – Completed Clubhouse addition and new third-level Skyline addition.\n\n1978 – In February, Fonner Park celebrated its 25th anniversary.

Fonner traded Tuesday racing for Sunday and added 1,543 new box and grandstand seats.\n\n1980 – In April, the jockeys walk out on operations because of the “unfit” track surface. While on May, the Grand Island voters rejected the continuation of Sunday racing by a vote of 4,183 against 3,079.
