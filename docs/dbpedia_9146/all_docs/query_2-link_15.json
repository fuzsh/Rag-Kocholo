        "text": "Grand Island's mayor expressed his frustration and hopes for an asset he considers the crown jewel of Grand Island.\n\nMayor Jeremy Jensen was upset about the tardiness of the discussion for the Heartland Events Center's fate, and said the current state is more or less confusing.\n\nThe time is ticking on a contract with Fonner Park to run the center. Mayor Jensen called an informal study session with Fonner Park, the Nebraska State Fair and Grow Grand Island to finally open up discussion about the Heartland Event Center.\n\nWhen the center was built by Fonner Park in 2006, a contract was written to say after the debt was paid off for the building, ownership would go to the city.\n\nThat deadline is getting close and the Mayor is saying the city should not own the building.\n\n\"The only option, in my mind, is that the city should not own it,\" he told NTV.\n\nThe Mayor said there are plenty of other things the city needs to worry about in the future and the event coordination business is not one of them.\n\n\"Once the debt is extinguished, that contract is essentially voided, and so there's going to be some decisions to be made, and really the decision needs to come down to who is best suited to run that operation and what does the future of it look like?\" said Jensen.\n\nThere is approximately 5 years left until the debt is paid off. Jensen said not knowing who is currently in charge is a challenge. \"We have a lot of different groups that are involved, there is no clarity of who's in charge,\" he said.\n\nJensen also noted that if someone called him and said they wanted to have an event in the city, he would not now who to contact.\n\n\"It created the opportunity for mass confusion,\" Jensen said. And that's why is he calling all parties involved for an open discussion. \"I think the State Fair is obviously something we should give consideration to,\" he said.\n\nThe Heartland Events Center is an asset. 300,000 people a year that come to the State Fair is one reason this \"Jewel\" is important for the city and the fat needs to be discussed.\n\n\"The thing that I talk ad nauseum about is the importance of Grand Island to continue to bring people to our community. And when we look at that campus out there, it's definitely something in the future, we have to have a clear direction as far as what it is the expectations are and how the development is going to continue to benefit the city,\" Jensen said.\n\nDuring the study session, the State Fair Executive Director Lori Cox brought up future plans for the State Fair with a possibility to expand. She hinted that the concert venue is important in that plan."
