In 1953 the Fonner's sold their land that became known as Fonner Park to the Hall County Livestock Improvement Association and became the permanent home of the Hall County Fair. In 1954, the first year of live thoroughbred horse racing was held at the track, with thirteen days of racing. Fast forward to May 27, 2020, and Fonner Park adapted a standard 11-week racing season into a 15-week season, totaling 40 days of live racing.\n\nIn addition to live horse racing and live streaming and replays, the 220-acre Fonner Park Complex hosts national livestock shows, the Hall County Fair, the Nebraska State Fair and is the home of the ASKARBEN 4-H Stock Show and Nebraska State 4-H Horse Show, event and conference facilities, a restaurant and keno area, an RV & campground, and the coming Grand Island Casino Resort.\n\nTop Rated Online Casinos for Germany\n\nup to\n\nT&C's Apply\n\nVisit Casino\n\nRead Review\n\nup to\n\ntest\n\nVisit Casino\n\nRead Review\n\nLoading...\n\nThere are no available casinos for requested criteria.\n\nSomething went wrong.
