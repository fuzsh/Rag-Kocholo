Angle buttresses with keeled shafts swallowed by head stops flank a nine-light east window of Lady Chapel with reticulated tracery, beneath a three-light mullion window with a label mould running into a string course, a central niche to parapet above and drip mould. The two-bay Lady Chapel has transomed four-light and three-light windows to north and south, the north aisle of five bays has transomed four-light windows, all with two alternating patterns of reticulated tracery. The single-storey Elder Lady Chapel is of four bays with three stepped lancet windows to each bay, and a c1275 Decorated east window of five lights; buttresses with gargoyles and tall diagonally-set pinnacles between a parapet of pierced trefoils, and a large square clasping buttress at the east end with a tall octagonal pinnacle.\n\nThe north transept has a six-light east window with rectilinear tracery, and a west window and door and a Geometrical six-light north window by Street with a three-light mullion window above covered by a clock, and a gabled, crenellated parapet with square, crenellated turrets. two-stage crossing tower with a north east stair turret, angle buttresses to the lower stage and diagonal ones to the belfry; five transomed two-light Perpendicular windows to each stage, louvred to the centre of the belfry, separated by thin buttresses with finials; weathering above, a blind arcade and a crenellated parapet with corner pinnacles.\n\nThe five-bay nave has four-light transomed windows with Geometrical tracery, separated by deep buttresses with pinnacles linked to those on the parapet by flying buttresses; above is a course of weathering and a parapet of pierced trefoils.\n\nAn ornate north porch with an arch of three orders below a statuary panel of the Adoration, with two-light transom lancets to each side and above; set-back buttresses with round, weathered tops, and attached shafts to canopied niches with statues. Inside, the porch has two bays, each with a bench and two niches styled after the Elder Lady Chapel, Purbeck marble shafts and trefoil tympana, joined by hoods with foliate stops; Purbeck marble shafts beneath a sexpartite vault, and lancet windows with quatrefoil heads in the north bay; the entrance arch is three orders with Purbeck marble shafts and a rose window in the tympanum, running foliage to the lintel and a two-leaf door with strap hinges.\n\nThe Berkeley Chapel has three-light windows to the east, a four-light south window and a rounded triangular window with three trefoil openings to the west; gableted buttresses with diagonally-set pinnacles and a crenellated parapet, and on the southwest corner an octagonal stair turret with a weathered top. Two mullion windows to the Sacristy, buttressed like the adjoining chapel. The Newton Chapel, in the angle against the south transept, has a five-light east window and a small mullion window just below a plain parapet, and a five-light south window. South transept has a four-light south window with reticulated tracery and a small C12 lancet above, a four-light west window by Street and a coped parapet.\n\nThe west front has two large flanking three-stage towers: the lower stage has a four-light window, the second-stage a blind arcade of four lancets with engaged shafts, with setback buttresses and a band of trefoil panels at the top; the belfry has two louvred two-light windows flanked by narrower blind two-light lancets,with crocketed gable hoods; below the top corners are statues in canopied niches, and broad octagonal gableted pinnacles; on the rear outer corners of the towers are octagonal stair turrets with panels on the belfry stage and gabled panels above it.

Above this lower gable is a large rose window with a crocketed gable hood, fronting blind pointed-arched panels of two tiers forming a parapet, divided by diagonally-set buttresses with large finials.\n\nINTERIOR: Lady Chapel has a richly decorated stone C14 reredos of three large, cusped, crocketed ogee-arched niches with ball flowers, flanked by pinnacle buttresses, with narrow gabled niches in between and shields in the spandrels above; diaper work to the backs of the niches, and original cornice with heads and fleurons beneath an elaborate crested parapet added by Abbot Burton 1526-39; four C19 sedilia by Pearson in a similar style with slender shafts to cinquefoil arches formed from intersecting ogee arches; three very fine C14 stellate memorial niches, two on the north side, of five foliate finials linked by convex curved labels with naturalistic crockets and head stops, which surround on three sides an octagonal stilted arch with open cusps and trefoil spandrels; all these are painted by E Tristram, c1930s. The window reveals of the Lady Chapel are splayed, above a gallery through the piers with concave-headed doorways and head keys and a parapet of pierced, slanted quatrefoils; banded Purbeck marble shafts with foliate capitals to a lierne vault, with richly carved bosses.\n\nChancel: a five-bay arcade of steep, pointed arches without capitals (a remarkably early example), and attached shafts with foliate capitals to the vaults, which are as the Lady Chapel but with cusped lozenges. Similar galleries to the aisles, of the same height as the chancel, but bridged by horizontal stone beams on pointed arches, with pierced mouchette spandrels; the aisle vault rests, with fine head corbels, on the beam, and is made open by the absence of the two lower cells. The north aisle has two stellate niches, and the two west bays are pierced by shallow Perpendicular arches dying into the jambs, with quatrefoil panelled intrados and large naturalistic foliate bosses. These give onto the Elder Lady Chapel, entered from the north transept by an arch of three orders with Purbeck marble shafts, bases and capitals; four bays, each with a lower arcade of four deeply moulded trefoil arches, with Purbeck shafts and stiff leaf capitals, enriched with anthropomorphic masks; hoods with finely carved foliate and animate stops and spandrels with various genre scenes; above them is a horizontal roll moulding which is swallowed at the ends by the head stops; three stepped rere arches to each bay, the outer ones with a cusp, on Purbeck marble shafts, capitals and bases, are separated by banded shafts to a sexpartite vault; on the south side the rere arches are cut short for the openings to the chancel, with three stiff leaf corbels in the east bay. The south aisle has three similar stellate niches, that to the east open to the Berkeley Chapel. This is entered by a cuspate arch with ball flowers and a crocketed ogee hood, flanked by niches with gabled hoods, with pinnacle buttresses dividing them.\n\nThe Ante Chapel or Sacristy has three south niches with cuspate, convex hoods and fine, foliate finials and carved leaves on the spandrels; between are gabled niches and pinnacle buttresses, and the east niche has a flue to a chimney in the pinnacle above; in the north east corner is a niche with a crocketed gable, beneath a gargoyle head; the arch to the Berkeley Chapel has small pomegranates which fade into the jambs, and an ogee hood with coiled sea shells, beneath a canopied niche. The ceiling is flat, with a flying vault of three bays beneath it, described by Pevsner as a 'tour de force'.\n\nThe Berkeley chapel has an aumbry, two canopied piscinas, and three small trefoil-headed niches in the south wall with carved heads to spandrels and a label mould; fine naturalistic foliate carving, and ball flowers and fleurons to the south window soffits; beneath the open stellate niche is a running moulding of five rings encircling stiff leaves above five shields; shafts with foliate capitals to a quadripartite vault.\n\nThe Newton Chapel is one bay with part of a blind round arch in the south wall and a quadripartite vault; borders small bay to the south aisle with an octopartite vault.\n\nTransepts: the chamfered arches to the east and west aisles die into the jambs; lierne vaults, after the chancel, that to the north with fine bosses; to the south a cusped arched door, blocked Norman lancet and Norman stair to the Dormitory.\n\nNave: six-bay arcade has Purbeck marble corner shafts and foliate capitals to piers; tierceron vault; the aisle vaults follow the chancel aisles, but with the vault springing from the beam forming two open arches.

The west arcade bays are closed by blind tracery; the west end has four crocketed gable hoods separated by buttresses, with an arcade of trefoil niches below the rose and flanking Purbeck marble shafts; the rooms below the towers have trefoil arcades after the Elder Lady Chapel. Each bay has a memorial niche of cinquefoil arches flanked by pinnacle buttresses.\n\nChapter House of 1150-70: entered from the east cloister through three semicircular arches to a two-bay quadripartite vaulted lobby, with columns with half shafts and scallop capitals, very early pointed ribs, and beaded soffits. The very fine Chapter House has two quadripartite vaulted bays, with an arcade of semicircular-arched seat niches from the ground, beneath side arcades of interlacing semicircular arches, effectively forming pointed arches, on enriched shafts with scallop and foliate capitals, rope moulding, and semicircular-arched tympana above decorated with basket weave and chevron. The west end has three semicircular arches, the outer ones containing two-light windows with a black marble central shaft, the central one a C19 double door with wrought-iron, beneath an arcade as the side, with a further arcade rising across the arched wall above;

The C14 work with its tall aisles, remarkable vaulting and spatial effects is one of the earliest major hall churches, 'superior to anything else built in England and indeed in Europe at the same time'(Pevsner), and is an exceptionally early example of a hall-type church which achieved more popularity on the continent.\n\nCLOISTER: mid C19 entrance from the south transept to the cloister, which occupies five bays to the south side of the nave; each bay has two three-light Perpendicular windows, articulated by buttresses with crocketed pinnacles breaking though the cornice with gargoyles to the middle. Similar east cloister walk without pinnacles, much restored C19. To the sooth end a deep ogee gable with crockets to the gable and jambs.\n\nINTERIOR has early C14 door; monuments include Elizabeth Draper d.1780 by John Bacon, with two allegorical figures. Glass includes fragments of medieval glass.\n\nDormitory has Norman, C14 and C17 windows.\n\nINTERIOR includes C13-C16 floor tiles and late C16 drawings.
