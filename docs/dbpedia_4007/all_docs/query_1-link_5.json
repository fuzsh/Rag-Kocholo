        "text": "Walking, running or cycling your local footpath network is ideal for regular errands and exploring your local area and beyond. Local paths can take you to and from work or school, get you to your favourite activities and connect you with your friends, all for free. At the same time you can enjoy the benefits of spending time outdoors and exploring your local parks while greatly improving your mental and physical wellbeing.\n\nThere are many miles of footpaths running through Carlisle’s green spaces, creating safe and well-maintained corridors for you to explore a very green Carlisle. Many of these green spaces are connected by an extensive public rights of way network, meaning that you can walk from one side of the city to another easily, often without needing to walk near busy roads.\n\nPublic rights of way\n\nA right of way is legally a highway and anyone can use them at any time. There are different types of rights of way, for walking, horse riding, cycling and driving. Cumbria County Council are the highway authority responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the public rights of way network in Cumbria. The definitive map shows the alignment and status of public rights of way in Cumbria.\n\nSee the Definitive Map information on the Cumbria County Council website for an illustrative map of public rights of way in Cumbria. Email [email protected] to report a problem with the public Rights of Way network.\n\nGetOutside has lots of ideas of ways to explore the local area and beyond\n\nCycle ways\n\nThere is an extensive network of on and off-road cycle ways running through Carlisle. There are two National Cycle Network routes running through Carlisle and it’s greenspaces. These are:\n\nRoute 7 – Lochs & Glens\n\nRoute 10 – Tynemouth to Whitehaven\n\nRoute 72 – Hadrian’s cycle way\n\nMore information on the National Cycle Network available from Sustrans\n\nCarlisle is a leafy place! With majestic mature trees found within Bitts Park or Knowefield Wood, to newly planted woodlands found within the Kingmoor Nature Reserves.Trees provide many benefits that are essential to a healthy city, they improve the wellbeing of residents, improve economic opportunity, improve individual prosperity, improve the urban micro-climate, stabilise soil, reduce air pollution by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reduce noise pollution, benefit wildlife and are a symbol of civic pride.\n\nCarlisle City Council is responsible for:\n\nTrees in parks and amenity green spaces.\n\nTrees in cemeteries and closed churchyards.\n\nTrees on council allotments.\n\nTrees on council owned industrial estates.\n\nCarlisle City Council is not responsible for:\n\nTrees on highways, please contact Cumbria County Council 0300 303 2992\n\nTrees in school grounds\n\nTrees in private gardens, you are responsible for maintain the trees on your property and making sure they are safe. You can find a list of qualified tree surgeons on the Arboricultural Association website. Before carrying out any work, check to see if your tree has a Tree Preservation Order on the tree or is it within a Conservation Area by using the Your Neighbourhood search facility on Carlisle City Councils Residents home page. If the tree/trees you wish to carryout work on do have a tree preservation order or are within a conservation area please see Planning & Building Control.\n\nCarlisle City Council will fell or carry out tree surgery when:\n\nA dead tree or dead timber posing a safety risk\n\nA dying tree or part of a tree posing a safety risk\n\nA diseased tree posing a risk to health of other trees in the vicinity\n\nGrowth is obstructing roads, footpaths, official signs or streetlights\n\nGrowth is (above or below ground) causing damage to nearby buildings\n\nPriority is given to trees that are dead, diseased or dangerous. We also carry out pruning when it’s needed to keep trees healthy.\n\nCarlisle City Council will not normally carry out felling or tree surgery work for the following reasons:\n\nTo prevent shading/loss of light to properties\n\nTo prevent minor or seasonal effects such as leaf litter, bird mess, fruit or seed fall or sticky secretions from insects and aphids (honeydew)\n\nTo prevent effects on TV reception (satellite or terrestrial television)\n\nTo prevent obstruction of private CCTV cameras\n\nWhere the work will result in a loss to the wider community\n\nWhere the threat posed by a tree is based on a perception – decisions will be based on actual evidence and inspections.\n\nPruning of overhanging branches that are not causing an actionable nuisance\n\nObstruction of telephone/utility cables (these are the responsibility of the statutory undertaker such as a utilities provider)\n\nTo benefit an individual even if they are willing to pay for the removal or pruning of a tree\n\nPlease see a full copy of Carlisle City Councils Tree Management Principles in the downloadable documents below.\n\nIs a council tree affecting your property?\n\nOverhanging branches - If branches from a council tree are overhanging your property, you can cut them back yourself, unless the tree is protected by a Tree Preservation Order or is in a Conservation Area (link to My Carlisle). You may prune the branches back to the boundary of your property but no further. The work must be done from your own property. You must dispose of any cuttings yourself, do not leave them on Council land.\n\nTree damaging property - If you think a tree is damaging your property, the first thing to do is contact your home insurance company for advice. If it is proved that a council tree has damaged your property, or could cause damage in the future, we may carry out work on the tree.\n\nTree damaging pipes - It is very rare for underground water pipes to be broken by tree roots. Tree roots don’t break into undamaged pipes but will take advantage of a pipe that is already damaged. We don’t carry out work on trees to prevent roots entering damaged pipes, as repairing the pipe is the only certain solution. If you think a tree is damaging pipes on your property, the first thing to do is contact your home insurance company for advice.\n\nTree work standards\n\nCarlisle City Council follows nationally recognised standards of best practice, British Standard 3998. All tree surgery work is carried out by Arboriculture Association Accredited Tree Surgeons.\n\nTree planting\n\nWe plant new trees between October and March. These usually replace trees in the vicinity of the area where a previous tree was removed. If this not possible, we re-plant in alternate locations. Carlisle City Council endeavours to increase the tree stock and undergo wider planting projects.\n\nHow to select an Arboricultural Contractor\n\nAn arboricultural contractor, sometimes described as an 'Arboriculturist', 'Arborist' or 'Tree surgeon', will undertake tree work to a specification. However, contractors may say they are members of a trade association - Check the validity of any such claim. The Arboricultural Association produces a list of approved contractors.\n\nGet at least three written quotes and be aware that the lowest quote may not be the best one. It is also advisable to indicate to the contractor when you would like the work to be carried out. Remember that quotes only remain valid for a specific amount of time. Please let the contractor know your decision be it acceptance or refusal.\n\nAvoid contractors who use the words 'Lopping' and 'Topping'.\n\nMany reputable contractors cover large areas of the country, but you should generally avoid 'door knockers'.\n\nThe contractor should be able to provide proof of adequate insurance cover for the type of work being undertaken (usually at least 2 million pounds Public Liability Insurance).\n\nReputable contractors will be happy to answer all of your questions, as they have got nothing to hide.\n\nOnce you have selected your contractor, ensure that the work to be carried out for the agreed sum is confirmed in writing.\n\nOut of hours emergency\n\nIf emergency work needs carrying out to a tree on Carlisle City Council land out of hours please contact 01228 817200 or report with online enquiry form\n\nIf the emergency is a tree on a highway, please contact 0300 303 2992\n\nChalara ash dieback\n\nAsh die back is caused by a fungal pathogen hymenoscyphus fraxineus and those trees affected by the disease can decline rapidly.Carlisle City Council has a “Ash Dieback Action Plan” which will identify trees affected by the disease and take the appropriate action to those which pose a risk to the health and safety to people and property.\n\nReport a tree issue\n\nIf you have any queries or concerns regarding a council owned tree then please contact the Green Spaces Team by using the online enquiry form, email [email protected]. or call 01228 817200.\n\nPlease note that any unauthorised work undertaken to trees owned by Carlisle City Council will be considered as criminal damage and could lead to prosecution.\n\nTrees for schools and community groups\n\nGrants for schools and community groups tree planting can be found through the Woodland Trust\n\nTree planting\n\nIf you would like a tree planted on green space managed by Carlisle City Council please contact [email protected] to put a request in.\n\nThere is an overflowing bin in a Green space - Please report overflowing bins to 01228 817200 or using the online enquiry form\n\nWhat are the opening times of toilets in the parks?\n\nThere are toilets available at:\n\nBitts Park – open daily 9am – 5pm\n\nHammonds Pond – open daily 9am – 5pm\n\nTalkin Tarn Country Park – open daily 9am – 5pm\n\nWhen will the grass be cut in my area – Please see programme in Green Space Maintenance above.\n\nI wish to report an unauthorised encampment on a Green Space - Please see Unauthorised Encampments\n\nI would like to report fly tipping in a Green Space - Please report any fly tipping within a green space to 01228 817200 or by using the online enquiry form\n\nI would like to report an issue in a play area - Please report any issues in a play area to 01228 817200 or by using the online enquiry form\n\nHow can I find out more information about Hammonds Pond and Talkin Tarn - Use our map search to find out lots of useful information about Hammonds Pond and Talkin Tarn as well as other parks in Carlisle.\n\nHow do I report anti-social behaviour in a Green Space - Please call 101 or use the Police.uk online form.\n\nI am locked in or locked out of my allotment - Please call 01228 817200 to speak to a member of the Green Spaces Team.
