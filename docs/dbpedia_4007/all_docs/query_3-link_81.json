        "text": "Our Cathedral of the Diocese of Great Britain and Western Europe, following the Gospel, Holy Canons and pastoral tradition of the Church Abroad, abhors violence and warfare, and explicitly prays and works for the immediate end to the unjust bloodshed taking place in Ukraine — the spiritual homeland of all the faithful descendants of St Vladimir: the great baptiser of our Church. The Church Abroad, as an autonomous Church governed by her Holy Synod in New York, is not affiliated with any government or national identity, but, in the spirit of pre-revolutionary Imperial Russian Orthodoxy, centred in the diaspora for more than a century and incorporating our Parish which has been in London for more than three centuries, calls firmly for the unity of all Orthodox Christians in the Church, regardless of nationality or language, and for the immediate end to the war currently dividing, wounding and killing our many peoples.\n\nSince the outset of the war in Ukraine, our Diocese has prayed and worked — and continues to do so — for the immediate end to unjust hostilities, warfare and persecutions. Prayers are offered for the cessation of the warfare in Ukraine at every service of our Cathedral; and responses to the war have included the organisation of our Cathedral Food Bank for refugees, fundraising for refugees arriving in London and for those suffering in Ukraine; and, at a Diocesan level, assistance in relocation and housing of refugees, provision of legal and social support, the organisation of summer camps for the children of refugee families, the pastoral provision of care for clergy and faithful arriving in Europe from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church; as well as fundraising for the humanitarian works of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Ukraine itself, together with specific parishes and monasteries; and for the support of those seeking shelter in the territory of our Diocese.\n\nThose wishing for more details on the Diocese’s activities in response to the war may read announcements outlining its extensive practical works on those suffering in and from the war in Ukraine (as well as older and more recent updates on the same); and for those wishing clarity on the issue of anti-Christian persecutions taking place within the broader context of the war may read Bishop Irenei’s open letter on the persecution of Christians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Cathedral of the Nativity of the Mother of God and the Holy Royal Martyrs is the Cathedral See of the Diocese of Great Britain and Western Europe of the Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR), and is one of the oldest Orthodox parishes in the British Isles, having been founded in 1725. Having moved several times in its three-century history, today it lifts up prayers in the full splendour of the Orthodox Christian Divine Services in a new Cathedral in Chiswick, West London, built in the Pskov style and consecrated in 2018.\n\nThe Cathedral is the seat of the Diocesan Bishop for the whole of Western Europe, and is a vibrant Parish in its own right. Divine Liturgies are celebrated 4-5 times per week, with multiple evening services also each week. The services are in a mixture of Church Slavonic (the traditional liturgical language of Orthodoxy in the Slavic lands and their diaspora) and English.\n\nThis web site provides details on the Divine Services, contact and arrival information, as well as information on a few of the Cathedral’s principal activities, such as its Youth Group, Food Bank and Sisterhood.\n\nThe Cathedral is pleased to announce publication of a new book: The London Cathedral of the Nativity of the Most Holy Mother of God and the Holy Royal Martyrs: Architecture, Iconostasis, Painting (eds. Prof A Zdanovich and N Mabin) is an album of beautiful photographs of the Cathedral’s iconography, together with information about the parish, its history, and the unique architectural and artistic significance of the Cathedral building itself. Essays within the volume include ‘Christianity in the British Isles’; ‘A Brief History of the London Cathedral’; and texts examining the Cathedral’s architecture, iconostasis and frescoes.\n\nWriting in the Foreword, His Grace Bishop Irenei of London and Western Europe notes: ‘We pray that through the present volume, the unique treasures of this place may be appreciated and shared; and these pages will find their intended fulfilment if, having read them and gazed upon the images they convey, the desire stirs within the reader to “come and see”, and to experience directly the beauty of this sacred space and the God to Whom it is dedicated.’\n\nThe book is available at the kiosk of the London Cathedral (Hardback, 96 pages, £15); copies can also be ordered for delivery by post, by contacting the Cathedral via e-mail."
