        "text": "Description\n\nNY 3955 NE, 671-1/10/18\n\nCARLISLE,\n\nTHE ABBEY\n\nCathedral Church of the Holy and Undivided Trinity\n\n01/06/49\n\nGV\n\nI\n\nPriory Church and Cathedral, now all Cathedral. Early C12 with\n\nvarious rebuildings until the early C15, with 1652 alterations\n\nto west end; minor 1764 alterations; 1846 (by Thomas Nelson)\n\nand 1853-57 restorations by Ewan Christian; 1950s restoration\n\nand vestry etc additions.\n\nOldest parts are of mixed red and\n\ncalciferous squared sandstone blocks; the remainder is red\n\nsandstone ashlar, heavily restored, on chamfered plinth, with\n\nstepped buttresses carried up as pinnacles; string courses,\n\ndentilled cornices and solid parapets, battlemented on tower.\n\nSteeply pitched lead roofs, copper on south transept and flat\n\non tower; coped gables, that at east end with numerous cross\n\nfinials.\n\nEarly C12 nave originally seven bays, now two bays with a fragment\n\nof the third bay remaining as buttresses, with aisles and north\n\nvestry. South transept also C12 with C13 chantry chapel\n\n(dedicated to St Catherine); north transept is late C14\n\nincorporating part of C12 structure (original transept thought\n\nto have been destroyed when the tower fell in 1380). Tower\n\nrebuilt late C14/early C15.\n\nINTERIOR: 7-bay choir is internally C13 but completed in the\n\nlate C14, the east window is probably c1380. Nave has\n\ntriforium and clerestory in Norman style with some internal\n\ndistortion due to subsidence; the west wall is c.1652 with\n\n1870 windows; some of the other windows in the nave are later\n\ninsertions; north door (now internal) was added in 1813-4 and\n\ngives access to the 1956 vestry. Blocked south doorway to\n\ncloisters appears to have been C12. South transept of similar\n\nNorman details, the south door is 1856 (here originally the\n\ndormitory range joined the Cathedral and roof line can be seen\n\nexternally); chapel has panelled and traceried wooden screens\n\nof late C15. North transept has 1858 inserted north window to\n\nmemory of Dean Tait's children replacing earlier windows of\n\n1764 and c1380; former external window now internal, lit the\n\ncrossing when the transept had a flat roof (similar windows\n\nover nave and south transept were removed in 1855-7\n\nrestoration). Choir has C13 arches on clustered columns with\n\nelaborately carved capitals representing the 12 seasons. C15\n\nchoir stalls with later C15 mural painting on the backs.\n\nBarrel-vaulted ceiling is painted with stars on a blue ground\n\nand coats-of-arms of local gentry (originally to the design of\n\nOwen Jones in 1856 and replacing a similar medieval ceiling\n\ncovered by a false ceiling in 1764). East window contains\n\nmedieval glass in tracery head, the lower glass having been\n\nremoved in 1764, was replaced with the present plain glass in\n\n1862. For fuller details of the interior see Pevsner (1967)\n\nand the Pitkin guide to the Cathedral.\n\n(Pevsner N: The Buildings of England: Cumberland &\n\nWestmorland: 1967-: P.88-94; Pitkin Guide to the Cathedral).\n\nListing NGR: NY3989855964\n\nExternal Links\n\nHistoric England Listing\n\nCarlisle Cathedral at Wikipedia\n\nCarlisle Cathedral official website\n\nWikidata Q2533552\n\nExternal links are from the relevant listing authority and, where applicable, Wikidata.
