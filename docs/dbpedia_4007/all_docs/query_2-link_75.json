        "text": "Carlisle Cathedral is the second smallest of England’s ancient cathedrals and in located in Carlisle, in the north west of England. It was originally founded as an Augustinian priory and became a cathedral in 1133.\n\nThe building is constructed of red sandstone and its notable features include the great East Window, figurative stone carving, a set of medieval choir stalls and the largest window in the Flowing Decorated Gothic style in England. The Policeman gargoyle at the cathedral is of PC George Russell. He was shot and fatally injured at Oxenholme railway station on 10 February 1965. The Deanery, has a 14th century Prior’s Tower, with a fine painted 16th Century heraldic ceiling.\n\nCarlisle Priory was founded in 1122, by King Henry I, replacing earlier buildings on the site. Ten years later the king created the diocese of Carlisle, and the priory church became the Cathedral."
