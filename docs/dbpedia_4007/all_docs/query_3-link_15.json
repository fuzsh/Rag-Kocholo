        "text": "This is Norwich Cathedral.\n\nI walked most of the way around. Went past the modern looking bit built on the ruins, and around to the back.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich_Cathedral\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Norwich Cathedral</a> on Wikipedia\n\nNorwich Cathedral is a Church of England cathedral built in Norwich, Norfolk, dedicated to the Holy and Undivided Trinity.\n\nThe cathedral was started in 1096 and constructed out of flint and mortar and faced with a cream coloured Caen limestone. A Saxon settlement and two churches were demolished to make room for the buildings. The building was finished in 1145 and had the fine Norman tower, that we see today, topped with a wooden spire covered with lead. Several periods of damage caused rebuilding to the nave and spire but after many years the building was much as we see it now, from the final erection of the stone spire in 1480.\n\nThe large cloister has over 1,000 bosses including several hundred carved and ornately painted ones. The buildings are on the lowest part of the Norwich river plain and surrounded on three sides by hills and an area of scrubland, Mousehold heath, to the fourth and North direction. This means that the Cathedral could be seen from just about any location in the city.\n\nIt is also one of the Norwich 12 heritage sites.\n\nIt is Grade I listed.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-228917-the-cathedral-of-the-holy-and-undivided-\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">The Cathedral of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, Norwich - British Listed Buildings</a>\n\nCathedral and Cloisters.
