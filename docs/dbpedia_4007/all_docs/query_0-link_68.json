        "text": "Preached at Carlisle Cathedral\n\nCarlisle Cathedral has a special form of torture that it reserves for its friends. It invites them back to preach on its feast day, which is wonderful, and Jean and I are so glad to be here – and then confronts them with the Trinity as the obvious subject for the sermon. Ouch! Having to live up to Bishop Michael Curry who is so fresh in folks’ memory just adds insult to injury. I am reminded of the new curate, a short chap like me, who was told by his vastly experienced six-foot incumbent to preach on Zacchaeus. Not so bad, you might think, but he was incapacitated with nerves; so on ascending the huge pulpit he kept his sermon short: “Zacchaeus was a little man. So am I. Zacchaeus was up a tree. So am I. Zacchaeus got down. So will I. Amen.”\n\nBut for once it’s not just me that’s feeling my inadequacies as we are confronted by the Trinity. St Augustine himself, author of the classic work on the subject, so the story goes, was once walking along the seashore (for some reason in full episcopal robes) pondering the mystery of the Trinity too. “Father, Son, Holy Spirit; three in one!” he muttered, shaking his head. Soon he passed a small pool, and saw a little boy running back and forth between the sea and the pool with a seashell of water. Augustine craned his neck and asked him: “What are you doing?” asked the saint. “Can’t you see?” said the boy. “I’m emptying the sea into this pool!” “You can’t do that!” said Augustine. “I will sooner empty the sea into this pool than you will manage to get the mystery of the Most Holy Trinity into your head!” retorted the boy, who was of course an angel sent to teach Augustine the limits of even his brainpower, and then disappeared, leaving him alone with the mystery.\n\nThe sea-shell and its story is in that sense a better image for the Trinity than any clever diagram, comparison with ice, water and steam, or three-leaved clover. It reminds us that yes, the doctrine emerged to state some of our core beliefs as Christians – that there is one and only one God; that we know God as our Father and Creator, that we know him in Jesus, that we know him in the Spirit; and that all these are distinct identities while still being One. But it reminds us of them in a way that prevents us from thinking that we can reduce the transcendent reality of God to the thoughts of the human mind, let alone a diagram in a textbook. As Rowan Williams keeps reminding us, God is not a thing among things to be described and accounted for as we do other things: he is the ground of being on which thingness, existence itself, depends.\n\nPerhaps you remember seeing the famous triangular diagram of the Trinity – it’s often seen in stained glass: I’m meaning the one in which a circle with Deus, God, written in it is placed at the centre with three other circles saying Father, Son and Holy Spirit at the three points of the triangle. The connections of each to God in the centre are marked “is”, but the connections around the edge are marked “is not”. The Father is God, the Son is God, the Spirit is God. But the Father is not the Son, the Son is not Spirit and the Spirit is not the Father. It captures the logic of the doctrine very well, but how icy, how insufficient that “is not” is compared with the rich language of the Gospels of how the Son and the Father are one, of how as the Father has loved the Son, so we are to love one another: the language of love that turns a diagram into a dance. No wonder St Bernard of Clairvaux could say that “If, as is properly understood, the Father is he who kisses, the Son he who is kissed, then it cannot be wrong to see in the kiss the Holy Spirit, for he is the imperturbable peace of the Father and the Son, their unshakable bond, their undivided love, their indivisible unity.”\n\nIt’s important, then, that we approach the Trinity as we are doing this morning, in worship. I’m glad Augustine and many others have written substantial and helpful treatises about it: but I’m even gladder when they lead us to go deeper into the relationship that God desires for us, for otherwise they are dead letters on a library shelf, not steps towards life.\n\nI think that’s why, of today’s set readings, it’s the Old Testament one that moves me the most, even though I have spent the last ten years digging ever more deeply into John’s Gospel. Even though the triple formula, “Holy, Holy, Holy” was of course in no sense understood in Isaiah’s time as a statement of the doctrine of the Trinity, I am completely prepared to see the phrase, which is put in the mouths of the seraphs, as an inspired response not just to the utter, thrice-emphasised holiness of God, which is enough to make the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, but also to the three-fold nature of his being, which Isaiah himself will also begin to glimpse as perhaps the greatest of the early prophets, writing what is sometimes called the Fifth Gospel, because it coheres so strongly with the self-understanding of Christ himself. The Spirit of the Lord was upon him.\n\nSo, my prayer for each of us today is that we will be drawn ever more fully into the holy, holy, holy presence of God and formed ever more fully in that holiness ourselves. That is the dynamic, the divine exchange, on which Bishop Curry’s royal wedding sermon depended: the fire of the divine love, touching us by the pure grace of God and searing away our sins, which so fills us that it becomes, in us, a love that can change the world. And as he implied but did not stress, just as our love has power because God is love, to lose our connection with the love of God is to separate us from the source of that power and see our love lose its loveliness, and be love in name alone.\n\nUnderstood in this way, the Trinity is not a problem or a puzzle, but an invitation to participate in a power, the power for good, the foundation for the hope we have been holding on to as we have been praying “Thy Kingdom Come, Thy Will be Done.”\n\nIt offers the hope of a clear single source of holiness, goodness, truth, beauty and meaning to a world that struggles to find its moorings any more. But the singularity to which it points is one which we can in no sense properly appropriate and weaponise to our ends, religious or otherwise, but which shows that hard-wired into the deep-down nature of things is a self-giving love and deep joy in relationships that is continually inviting every one of us, whatever and whoever we are, into its dance of love.\n\nThat has implications for how we are to be as church, holding together our trust in the revelation that we have received and the creating, saving, inspiring work of God; while at the same time letting the love and joy of that melt away the anxiety that seems to be so marking both our society and our church at the moment, so that we can truly welcome and include all who would journey with us, and indeed love those who would not as well, as best as we can.\n\nSo, to the church I want to say, love one another as God has loved you; and let yourselves be known by that love, not by the lack of love, suspicions and incriminations. that have marked the response of some even to that Curry sermon on love itself. We have come to a dangerous place when, however conservative we are, we are judging one another by how wrathful we are prepared to say the God of love can be.\n\nBut we need to break out of a conversation which is just between ourselves as churchgoers: introspection and anxiety are the enemies of the day. We need to find ways of speaking about God and love far more widely – and the Trinity gives us the opportunity.\n\nSo, to Muslim and Jewish friends, I want to say, the one God whom you worship is the one God I worship too. I am unlikely to convince them easily that I am not a tri-theist, but I can rejoice that whatever the Trinity means it means that God is one. And I was proud to use my position as Bishop of Huntingdon to make sure that when I sat on that place’s Local Strategic Partnership I was there on behalf of those of other faith too, and helped all of us found an Interfaith Group. Just as when I was in a parish in these parts I was glad to help a local Jewish family in pastoral need, and more recently to bless a Jewish visitor with an Aaronic blessing at the altar rail.\n\nAnd then to those who are following different sorts of faith or none, I want to say that though the specificity of that mono-theism may well seem a threat, the revelation of the one God’s nature summed up in the Trinity is that here above all and perhaps here alone is the place where we can see pure self-giving love, that will never use its power for ill, even towards those who would condemn it to the Cross. I may again be unlikely to convert many to that deep truth – the narrative of suspicion about the church runs deep – but I can at least rejoice in it myself and try a little harder to live it out in my life. So, when an old friend who did not share my belief died, it was a privilege to help his family put together a funeral that did not compromise my own faith but left full room for their varying approaches to it. And it is why too that I do what I can to promote loving inclusion for all sorts of people in the church, even if there are dividing lines between us. By our fruits we will be known.\n\nSo, at its best, this Cathedral Church, we the living Church, are those who by faith are a place and are a people that have so encountered the love of God in Christ Jesus, who came into the world not to condemn the world but that it might be saved through him, that with open hearts and open doors we are able offer that love to all we meet, until the kingdom in all its fulness is come. Amen."
