It isn't one of the largest, best known or spectacular of English cathedrals, but I thought it was a real gem of a building, despite suffering the loss of its nave in the Civil War. A small building is thus made all the smaller by the loss of over a third of its original length, but the remainder of this more modest cathedral is ample reward for the visitor.\n\t\n\tThe former nave is a mere two bays long and now a memorial chapel, whilst the somewhat gloomy transepts and crossing adjoining it are equally modest and collectively serve as a kind of ante-chapel to the wonderful choir beyond. The choir with its rich painted and gilded ceiling and superb medieval stalls is the highlight of the church and more than makes up for the truncated western limb and rather cramped crossing. \n\t\n\tThe only problem I had here was not being able to use a tripod (hence some wobbly photos) and also the staff being so charming and friendly that I ended up spending half my time there chatting with them (hardly a negative, but slightly awkward when time is limited).",
