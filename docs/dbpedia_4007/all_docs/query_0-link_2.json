We offer an inspirational space for worship, rest, and prayer, a safe space for conversation and debate and a creative space in the tranquil setting of the cathedral precinct and café.\n\nWe are home to the Bishop’s ‘seat’, the mother church of the Diocese for over 900 years and we welcome all whether a curious visitor, a faithful pilgrim, or a regular worshipper. We seek to be a living community of faith which proclaims afresh the good news of God’s transforming love to the city, county and beyond. Whoever you are and wherever you come from, you are most welcome here."
