        "text": "The tallest building in the city of Carlisle is the much debated Civic Centre Tower, headquarters of Carlisle City Council. It is located just down the road from the Castle, on the edge of the famous roundabout called Hardwick Circus. Few people get to visit the top of the tower, but I decided to email the City Council to see if it would be possible as I suspected the view would be worth seeing. They granted my request, and the next day Gemma and I ascended to the roof of the building to look out across the city…\n\nCivic Centre, Carlisle\n\nThe tower is one of the defining landmarks of the city, and it is a rather divisive building as well. Many residents hate it, many think its its iconic, but new proposals mean it’s future is in doubt. The latest plans suggest demolishing it the complex and building shops and restaurants in it’s place, so it spurred me on to get to the top whilst I still can. Many people are not aware that you can actually visit the top, all you have to do is ask, so if you contact the City Council then they should be able to arrange it for you.\n\nThe Civic Centre was built in 1964, and stands an impressive 135 feet tall. Three lifts can transport you to the roof section, but they require a special key to get this far up. It takes but a matter of seconds to pass through the 10 floors to get to the top, and it has been the home of the Council since it was built. The most well known section is the tower, but the rotunda and rectangular section at the bottom is still part of the overall development.\n\nAt the time Carlisle was the county town of Cumberland, which was merged with Westmorland and the far North of Lancashire to create Cumbria. When this happened the Carlisle County Borough merged with other local parishes to create the present day City of Carlisle District.\n\nThis is one of the many stunning views available from the roof, looking West through to South West. At the far right of the picture is Carlisle Castle, with it’s might stone outer walls making it an impenetrable fortress. The main stone sections, the Keep, walls and Central Tower date from just after 1122, when Henry I (1068 – 1135) gave the order to build a stone Castle here, to replace the previous wooden version built by William II (1056 – 1100). This was due to the threat of attack from the Scottish as Carlisle is only 10 miles away from the Anglo-Scottish Border.\n\nThe main A595 road, also known as Castle Way, runs in front of the Castle, and further up the road past the Castle is a modern suspension bridge for pedestrians to cross the road. A pedestrian underpass runs underneath the road and also gives access to the Castle. Moving left across the picture we reach Dixon’s Chimney, part of Shaddon Mill, which was built in 1836. It opened as a Cotton Factory, and at the time was the largest in England. It became a Woolen mill in 1883 after the Cotton company, Peter Dixon & Sons Ltd went into administration. Today it is inhabited by apartments and the University of Cumbria, after it was converted in 2005. The original height of the chimney was 305 feet, but it was cut down to 209 feet in 1950. It’s grand height was necessary to keep the smog from drifting down into the city itself, and was instead released into the air high above the city.\n\nNext to that is Carlisle Cathedral, one of the dominating features in the city. Although as you explore the city street it looks like its on flat ground, it is on a hill high above the rest of the buildings, and often the first city centre building you see as you drive into Carlisle, particular if you are coming from the Northern end of the city. Construction began the same year as the Castle, and operated as an Augustinian Church for 10 years, before it became a Cathedral in 1233. Find out more in my special Carlisle Cathedral post here.\n\nIn the foreground of the picture at the far left is Carlisle Market Hall, one of the few remaining Victorian Covered Market Halls left in the country. It was built between 1887 and 1889, and contains around 100 stores. The stonework blends in brilliantly with the other old buildings around the city, and it looks even more impressive from above.\n\nLooking South to South East, the view from the Cathedral and the Market Hall continues, through to the large Debenhams store at the North end of the Lanes Shopping Centre, which originated as narrow housing streets built in medieval times. These were converted in the 1980’s into shops and became the Shopping Centre in 1986, with a roof added over the top. The rest of the shopping streets are pedestrianised, including the main street which runs between Debenhams and the Market Hall. If you head up this road you will reach the central square of the pedestrianised streets, where the old Town Hall and Tourist Information Office are located. The Market is one of the main bus stops in the city, with various services calling here.\n\nAt the far right of the picture is the Carlisle Magistrates Court, directly across the road from the Civic Centre.\n\nDirectly to the North of the Civic Centre is Hardwick Circus, shown above. It’s a large roundabout that has a park inside, and you really don’t get a sense of the scale of the place from the ground. It looks incredible from this height, and three walkways run under the road so you can easily cross the roundabout. Behind the roundabout is the Sands Centre, the local theatre and exhibition space where various acts perform each week.\n\nEven further beyond the Sands Centre the hills of the Lowlands of Scotland in the Dumfries & Galloway area are visible, and even the chimneys of Chapel Cross, a decommission power station just outside the town of Annan, also in Scotland can be made out, but sadly they didn’t stand out well enough to make it onto the picture. Built in 1959, it was decommissioned in 2004 and the cooling towers were demolished in 2007.\n\nYou can’t actually tell on this picture, but the road leading North away from Hardwick Circus and the Sands Centre is actually being carried by the Eden Bridge, which carries the A7 towards Scotland, over the river Eden which flows beneath it. Built in 1815, it was was widened in 1932 so two lanes now run both North and South. It consists of five large arches supported by pillars in the centre of the river.\n\nThe area to the left of Hardwick Circus is called Bitts Park, and connects Hardwick Circus with the large stone walls of the Castle. It contains a hedge maze, various leisure facilities, and a statue of Queen Victoria in the centre, shown above, surrounded by neat flower beds. The Eden flows around the Northern edge of the park, and meets with the river Caldew to form one river which then runs out to the Solway Firth near Gretna.\n\nThe top of Debenhams is visible at the very front of this picture, and if you look up the road to the left (called Lowther Street) you will see two circular figures of the Citadel Towers at the end of the road. These identical towers were built between 1810 and 1811, and were designed by Thomas Telford (1757 – 1834, famous Scottish Civil Engineer) although the designs were finished off by Sir Robert Smirke (1780 – 1867, English Architect). The road that leads up to, and through the gap between the towers is called Botchergate and the original gate that guarded the city was located at the South End of the street. This was superseded by a 16th century gate built by Stephan von Haschenperg (circa 1540’s) an architect from Moravia, a historic country that now forms part of the Czech Republic. He was employed by Henry VIII (1491 – 1547) to create the gate. This in turn preceded the present Citadel, which houses courts and a prison, although the towers are mainly used as offices for Cumbria County Council today. The East Tower (the one in full view) has some original 16th century foundations remaining.\n\nJust to the right of the West Tower, but out of shot, is the Citadel Station, the only station in Carlisle, located on the West Coast Main Line between London and Glasgow/Edinburgh, with local services all over Cumbria, as well as regional destinations including Newcastle, Preston and Birmingham.\n\nThe crowning glory for the fantastic views of Carlisle has to be the hills of the Lake District, visible in the distance to the South of the city. They provide a great backdrop for one of the North’s most historic cities, and who knows what adventures await us on the horizon. I hope you are intrigued enough to check out my dedicated post on the city of Carlisle, and it’s many treasures, which you can find here.\n\nIn the border city of Carlisle, one landmark stands out above all others, sat on a hill in the city centre. The Cathedral Church of the Holy & Undivided Trinity is a stunning building in the middle of the historic city centre, and there is plenty to discover inside…\n\nHoly & Undivided Trinity:\n\nLocation: Carlisle, City of Carlisle District, Cumbria (historically Cumberland), England\n\nStatus: Cathedral\n\nFaith: Church of England\n\nConstructed: circa 1122\n\nArchitect: Various\n\nOur story begins back in 1122 as it was around this time that the building was founded as an Augustinian Priory, built out of Red Sandstone. Incidentally this is quite interesting, as it is one of only four such buildings that would be upgraded to Cathedrals. The building was begun by a man named Aethelwold (died 1156), and after the Church was upgraded to Cathedral status a decade later, he became the first Bishop of Carlisle, from 1133 to 1153.\n\n100 years later the Cathedral was surrounded by two friaries, a Dominican Friary and a Franciscan Friary, which were both founded slightly further out in what would become the City Centre, near the West Coast Main Line station today. During 1307 Edward I (1239 – 1307) visited the Cathedral, and because of this the building received a refurbishment over the next century. Whilst the Cathedral has survived the main centuries from its conception to the modern day, the friaries were not so lucky, and after King Henry VIII pursued the Dissolution of the Monasteries from around 1536, the friaries ceased to have any function, and the Cathedral stood alone. As I said the Cathedral survived through many centuries, but it lost an important section of itself when the English Civil War hit Carlisle between 1642 and 1651. The Castle and City Walls were in need of repair, and the easiest way to do this was to remove stone from the Cathedral to patch up the other defences. The original Nave of the building, shown at the back of this picture, was once much longer, but a large portion of it was demolished for the stone by the Scottish Presbyterian Army. If you look at the stone work on the side of the surviving Nave as well you can tell that it has been patched up with new materials, presumably where extra stonework was taken.\n\nVarious restorations of the Cathedral have followed, including between 1853 and 1870 when Ewan Christian (1814 – 1895, British Architect, who also designed the National Portrait Gallery in London) helped to restore the building.\n\nThe main entrance to the Cathedral is at the end of the South Transept, and as you walk in the shop/information office is directly to your right. Moving straight ahead you will enter the space between the Transepts, with the Tower high above. Supposedly the tower once had a spire, which blew down at some point before 1420. If you turn to the left, this is the view that greets you. The Nave is a stunning area of the Cathedral, and the place where I shall start our virtual tour.\n\nIt contains a font in the centre, and the beautiful West Window behind it. This is one of a number of windows around the Cathedral designed by John Hardman, a manufacturer of Stained Glass from Birmingham, which also includes the East Window which we shall get to in a minute.\n\nA chandelier hangs from the ceiling, and this area happens to be the shortest Nave of any Cathedral in England. Usually the Nave is the main portion of the Church, but as noted above this was demolished for other uses, leaving the Chancel as the more prominent part of the building. Within the Nave there is a Chapel of the Border Regiment, set into one of the two bays that remain, one on either side.\n\nMoving towards the Chancel, this is the view you see as you enter the Cathedral, looking from the South Transept into the North. It’s most notable feature is the Tait Memorial Window , which features 5 of the 7 daughters of Dean Archibald Campbell Tait. Sadly they all died within 33 days from March to April in 1856, all aged under 11, of an infection. The 2 other children survived and moved with their parents to London when the Dean became the Bishop of London. They are actually buried in Stanwix Graveyard elsewhere in Carlisle, where a memorial also sits.\n\nBeneath the window is the Bishops Court, which was a miniature courtroom, with the central panels behind the Altar and the pews on either side for people attending the session. The main panels are called the Brougham Triptych, which was built in 1520, in the Belgian city of Antwerp, and it contains the mark of the Antwerp Guild of Woodcarvers. It is called the Brougham Triptych as it previously inhabited St Wilfred’s Chapel in Brougham, after it was bought by Baron Brougham from a church in Cologne in the 1840’s. At some point it moved to Carlisle. A Triptych is made up of three carved panels together, as shown above.\n\nThese types of Court are also known as a “Consistory Court” and were established by King William I (1028 – 1087, AKA William the Conqueror) and this is a great example of the court. Others exists in the other Diocese’s around the country, with the most complete example being in Chester Cathedral, in the city of Chester. Whilst today these courts mainly discuss matters relating to the buildings themselves and facilities contained within, they can take members of the Church below the rank of Bishop to court for misconduct.\n\nThe Chancel is by far the most impressive part of the Cathedral, and the largest. It stretches all the way up to the East Window at the far end, which sits above the main altar. A fire badly damaged the building in 1292, and the window dates to the rebuild afterwards, from around 1350. It is a staggering 50 feet tall, and you can tell by the size of the people stood below how large it looks. As it happens, it is the largest such window in the whole of England, and sits 26 feet wide. There are two main sections of Glass, with the top half being original glass, showing the Last Judgement of Christ, with the lower portion showing the Lift of Christ. This portion was built Hardman & Co (John Hardman), around 1861, in memory of Bishop Hugh Percy (1784 – 1856, Bishop of Rochester and Carlisle).\n\nThe area at the front of the picture is the Choir, which was installed before at least 1545, with space for six chorus boys. This has been expanded to include space for 16 male and 16 female choristers, along with 6 clerks. The beautiful wooden sections are from the aforementioned 1545, but the actual choir of singers dates back to 1133, when there were 4 laymen and 6 male choristers. A laymen is a “non-ordained member of a Church”.\n\nThe Choir area was built in the 13th century, and damaged by the subsequent fire leading to a rebuild from 1322 until 1350. On the back of the wooden stalls are a series of painted panels, depicting various religious scenes. The Labours of the Months, 12 scenes depicting different labours from the 12 months of the years, are carved into the capitals of 12/14 pillars in the Choir area. A capital is a carved section at the top of the pillar. You can see a slideshow of the 12 pictures here.\n\nTurning to look back at the far end of the Choir, the stunning wooden spires above the 46 seats are visible, beneath the impressive Cathedral Organ. Whilst the earliest records for a physical Organ date back to 1571, an actual Organist wasn’t employed until 1650 when a man named Thomas Southick was hired.\n\nThe current Organ was built in 1856, by Henry Willis (1821 – 1901, British Organ builder from London) and it was a revolutionary design at the time. It was later enlarged in 1875, and again in 1906. I am unsure of it’s original position within the building, but it was moved here in 1930. It has been rebuilt twice since then, first in 1962 by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd, a British firm from 1828 established by Joseph William Walker, and again in 1997 when David Wells gave it a more Victorian tone.\n\nOur favourite part of the Cathedral is the ceiling, above the Chancel, Choir, East Window and main Altar. It’s a masterpiece and one of the most colourful ceilings we have seen inside a religious building, which are usually just wood or stone.\n\nThe structure of timbers was erected around 1400, after the fire that destroyed many of the previous wooden timbers. The patterns on it are much newer however, and were only added between 1853 and 1856, by an artist called Owen Jones (1809 – 1874). It was repainted in 1970, and it looks stunning, and it really stands out so that you can see every detail. Its amazing how much detail has gone into each panel, and although they all look the same they come together to create a fantastic pattern.\n\nThis is a close up view of the Chancel, with the chairs on either side. Just behind where I am standing is the Bishops Throne, with a golden Eagle Lectern in front of it. The sun shines brilliantly through the East Window, illuminating this whole section of the building. Its humbling entering the Chancel, as although Carlisle Cathedral is the 2nd smallest of the ancient Cathedrals around England (after Christ Church in Oxford) it has one of the most amazing views entering this area of the Cathedral.\n\nLocated in the North and South Aisles of the Choir, behind the wooden stalls, are a number of tombs, with perfectly sculpted figures adorning the tops of them. This particular one is for Francis Close (1797 – 1882), who was the Dean of the Cathedral for 25 years between 1856 and 1881. The statue on top is made out of Marble, and looks almost saintly, and it was glowing slightly earlier in the sunlight.\n\nCarlisle Cathedral is a beautiful building, to go with a beautiful and historic city. You can find out more about the Cathedral by visiting it’s official website here, and you can explore the city itself in my dedicated post here. There is a certain feature on the outside of the building which caught our eye, a grotesque on the side of the outer wall in a rather odd shape, and Gemma will tell you more in her post here.\n\nJust 20 minutes out of Carlisle City Centre, is a historic landmark that until I found it on a map, even Gemma didn’t know about, even though its her local area. As soon as we found out about it, we couldn’t resist taking a look…\n\nThe imposing figure of Wetheral Priory Gatehouse loomed out of the trees, down a small track just outside of Wetheral Village. It is all that remains of Wetheral Priory, and is open to the public for free. You can climb the spiral staircase inside to look out across the areas once covered by the two floors, and sometimes the roof, however the roof door was locked when we visited.\n\nCompleted in the 14th Century, the Gatehouse was part of the larger Priory complex, which was founded in 1066 by the Benedictine Order, from St Mary’s Abbey in York. Buildings in the complex included a Chapel and a Monastic School. The Gatehouse itself had two residential floors, for Officials and Visitors, as well as a number of Travellers who passed through the area. It’s fate was sealed in 1538 when the Priory was dissolved, falling into ruin. The Gatehouse survived by chance and was used as a vicarage throughout the 16th and 17th Centuries, being abandoned thereafter.\n\nWe started at the bottom, and entered the ground floor.This area was the main hall, which contained a fireplace, a separate toilet and an oriel window. The floors that one existed directly above it were broadly similar in their appearance, although they are long since gone leaving the interior of the Gatehouse hollow.\n\nThe spiral staircase can’t be accessed via the hall, only directly from outside over to the left as you enter the Priory grounds through the Gatehouse.\n\nThe view from the exit onto the original top floor affords a stunning view down through the Gatehouse to the bottom, as well as out over the wooden beams that hold the roof up, which have been restored. There is another room located across from our position here, but there is no access to it anymore as it is cut off without the floor.\n\nThe top stop is the roof, although the metal gate that gives access to the roof itself was locked when we visited, but I assume it must be open at some point. I can imagine some great views across the surrounding countryside and hills, so it’s a shame we couldn’t get up there. A view over the battlements must have been grand, and a commanding position in the area.\n\nThis is a view from inside the Gatehouse grounds, with the entrance to the staircase visible on the right. Off to the left is a small room with what looks like a wooden bed, minus a mattress. A plaque in the room explains that the Gatehouse could offer:\n\n“The right of Sanctuary. One of Wetheral’s most jealously guarded privileges was the right of sanctuary. Within an area bounded by market stones (sanctuary crosses), wrongdoers from elsewhere could claim freedom from arrest. Those who claimed sanctuary had to toll a bell in the priory church, and swear before the bailiff of the manor that he would keep the peace. No sanctuary was offered to those whose crime had been committed in Wetheral itself.”\n\nThis means that there were probably a lot of visitors to the area, seeking refuge from other law enforcements, which probably made it a rather unpopular place with the law. Many of these possibly arrived by boat, as the RIver Eden runs just behind the Priory site, coming from around Appleby and Penrith, before running from here into Carlisle and ultimately the Solway Firth.\n\nThe Gatehouse is a beautiful piece of history, and it’s nice to see what a good condition it has been kept in. This was just the start, as we soon made our way into Wetheral Village itself, to explore the famous Cross and Viaduct…\n\nWe have been to Carlisle quite a few times, and each time we explore a little bit more of it. It is a handy rail link for that part of the UK, with trains to all parts of the lake district, down to Lancashire, up to Glasgow, Edinburgh and Kilmarnock in Scotland, as well as over to Newcastle, Sunderland, Durham and Berwick-upon-Tweed, via Hexham and Haltwhistle. So this post covers all of our adventures in Carlisle.\n\nCarlisle:\n\nStatus: City of Carlisle District, Cumbria (Historically Cumberland), City, England\n\nDate: Various\n\nTravel: Virgin Trains (Carlisle – Preston, Glasgow, Edinburgh Waverley), Northern Rail (Carlisle – Hexham, Newcastle, Middlesbrough), Scotrail (Carlisle – Gretna Green, Kilmarnock, Newcastle)\n\nEating & Sleeping: Nando’s, Castle View Cafe, Fontana’s Chip Shop, Costa Coffee\n\nAttractions: Carlisle Cathedral, Carlisle Castle, The Citadel, Bitts Park, River Eden, Town Hall, Market Hall, The Lanes Shopping Centre, Tullie House Museum, Solway Aviation Museum at Carlisle Private Airport, Military Museum, The Abbey, Guildhall Museum etc\n\nIf you arrive in Carlisle by train then the first building you will encounter is the beautiful façade of Carlisle Citadel Station which opened in 1847. It was designed by a man called William Tite (1798 – 1873, English Architect) and was one of three stations in the city, the other two being Crown Street and London Road. The station was the only regularly used one by 1851, and it was expanded between 1875 and 1876 to add new platforms.\n\nI love the turreted octagonal tower shown on the right, and it makes the station feel more like a Castle than anything else, you could almost imagine it flying the English Flag back when border raids were common from Scotland.\n\nWhilst the first building you will encounter physically is the station, the first view of the city itself will be this one as you exit the station. The imposing figures of the Citadel Towers greet travellers into the city, marking the original south entrance into the city.\n\nThe original towers were built by Henry VIII (1491 – 1547) in 1541, as defensive towers. Rebuilt in 1810, the courts and County Gaol (Jail) were housed inside. Today the towers no longer fulfil these functions however and there is a separate Crown Court in the city. The Two Towers have their own features:\n\nEast:\n\nThis tower held Civil Trials and outside stands a statue of the Earl of Lonsdale, William Lowther (1757 – 1844, British Nobleman).\n\nWest:\n\nThe West Tower held Criminal Trials, and whilst there is no statue outside this one, which is a genuine cannon that helped to protect the city during the Stuart Uprising in 1745 when Bonnie Prince Charlie attacked Carlisle. On this side there are a number of benches as well, so one day I just sat there outside the tower and watched the world go by. It was a very relaxing experience and it’s such a lovely part of the city to be in.\n\nMoving past the Citadel, just up the road you will come to the extensive pedestrianised section of the city which contains most of the cities major landmarks. The buildings up and down either side are of a lovely stone construction and Carlisle has retained a lot of its heritage with lots of new Victorian buildings appearing in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nCarlisle is full of finely detailed sculptures and statues. The first of these is on the pedestrianised section coming from the station, where the proud figure of James Steel, a former Mayor of the city between 1845 and 1846.\n\nThe next statue needs no introduction, her Britannic Majesty Queen Victoria (1819 – 1901) stood in Bitts Park (opened 1897) next to Carlisle Castle, which also contains a variety of flowers artworks.\n\nThe third and fourth sculptures are both located within “The Lanes” shopping centre, and there is an entrance to the centre just down from the James Steel statue. The first of the two is of a fiddler named Jimmy Dyer (1841 – 1903, who regularly performed at festivals and markets). The second is a pair of Bronze Otters that were once part of a fountain. Any money thrown into the fountain was donated to charity. They were eventually moved to this area of the shopping centre in 2004 and are sat on a glass base.\n\nThe final statue is sat outside Brunton Park, home to Carlisle United Football Club. This is Carlisle favourite Hughie Mcllmoyle (Born in 1940) a Scottish Player who has played all over the UK from Port Glasgow, to Leicester, Preston, Carlisle, Bristol and Middlesbrough.\n\nMoving into the very centre of the pedestrianised area where three streets converge, the pleasant looking structure of the Old Town Hall greets you. It looks a lot newer than it is, and actually dates back to 1669, with an extension in 1717 adding the right hand side with the Clock Tower, which only has 3 clock faces. This section also has a plaque on it bearing the name of the mayor, the city arms and 1717 in Roman Numerals (MDCCXVII). An extension on the left was added sometime after 1788. The whole building became Grade I listed in 1949, and recently underwent a refurbishment which is now complete.\n\nThe building now houses a number of shops, along with the Tourist Information Centre on the top floor up the outer steps, which are a replacement from 1825 of the original 1717 ones. As you go into the Tourist Information Centre you enter the old council chamber, evident from the wooden panelling at the far end of the room. There was also a large model of the building made out of cake last time I went inside!\n\nThe best picture I have of the building is from Christmas 2013, with the lights up, and the annual Golden Angel figures stood outside.\n\nAlso, that same evening, the Coca-Cola Lorry from the adverts was in Carlisle, which we had seen previously in Preston. Both of these occasions were part of it’s national tour of 2013. The whole area was also decorated in Christmas Lights and it was a mini wonderland.\n\nOn the right, in front of the Lorry is the Market Cross, erected in 1682, and bearing the name of the then mayor Joseph Reed. Prior to this there was an earlier Market Cross and the new one is stood on the same spot.\n\nJust off to the left of the Old Town Hall is the Guildhall Museum, housed in the ancient Carlisle Guildhall, built before the 1400’s. It is one of the oldest buildings in the city, and when it first opened it was a series of shops and workshops attached the house of a wealthy merchant. It passed into the care of the City Council since the 1400’s.\n\nToday it houses the Guildhall museum, and you can find out about the original 8 Guilds, although only four remain today. The 8 were:\n\n1) Shoemakers\n\n2) Skinners & Glovers\n\n3) Smiths\n\n4) Tanners\n\n5) Tailors\n\n6) Butchers\n\n7) Merchants\n\n8) Weavers\n\nContinuing down the street past the Guildhall, you will arrive at Carlisle Cathedral, which is easily visible on the approach into the city centre by car, due to it’s elevated position up a hilly area of the city centre.\n\nConstruction started on this magnificent building in 1122, as an Augustinian Priory by Athelwold (Died 1156), who would go on to become the first Bishop of the new Cathedral between 1133 and 1155. Cathedral status was instated 11 years later in 1133. This makes it notable as the Cathedral is one of only four Augustinian Priories in England to actually become a Cathedral.\n\nIt was part of a complex of buildings related to the monastery/priory, although the dissolution of the monasteries in 1536 by Henry VIII meant that these become unused and the building became Church of England. During the English Civil War part of the Nave was demolished by the Scottish Presbyterian Army to reinforce Carlisle Castle. Carlisle has changed hands a number of times between England and Scotland due to their long history of fighting each other, along with Berwick-upon-Tweed, a town in Northumberland right next to the Scottish border that has also changed hands, starting in Scotland and finally staying in England.\n\nThe Cathedral is free to enter, and the interior ceiling is worth a look. It is painted a radiant blue with stars peppered all over it. On the outside there is also a grotesque of a Policeman, see if you can find it. Find out more about that particular item in Gemma’s post here.\n\nContinuing down the road you will come across one of the two entrances (the other being out on the main road opposite the Castle) to the Tullie House Museum.\n\nThe building opened in 1893, after the original Jacobean Mansion was converted. The main front of the mansion still survives however and is visible from the adjacent street, Abbey Street. In 1893 it contained a Museum, Library, Art and Technical School. The Schools moved to new premises in the 1950’s and the Library in 1986 leaving on the Museum, with part of it moving to the Guildhall in 1980. Inside the museum is a large collection of Roman artefacts related to the nearby Hadrian’s Wall which stretched from Coast to Coast, from Cumbria to Northumberland. There are also art collections, fine gardens and of course the original front of the building.\n\nMoving out onto the main road from here, there is a White Metal Bridge which crosses over to the Castle. Standing on the bridge you get a fantastic view of Dixon’s Chimney, part of Shaddon Mill, which was built in 1836 by Peter Dixon. The Mill made Cotton and the sheer size of the Chimney made it a landmark in the area, and it was designed to take the smoke from street level far away from residents. By 1883 Peter Dixon’s company had gone bust and Robert Todd and Sons Ltd took over, converting production to Wool.\n\nWhen it was built it was the largest cotton mill in England the and Chimney was the 8th largest in the World. The Chimney started off at 305 feet tall, before a reduction in 1950 left it at only 290 feet. Parts of the Mill are flats, with the rest being used by the University of Cumbria.\n\nOn this picture you can see the aforementioned bridge, which as a lift at either end. If it one of two ways to cross the main road, the other being a subway tunnel that runs from outside the 2nd entrance to Tullie House to the main path into the Castle. If you take the second route you will pass the Cursed Stone of Carlisle, which was installed in 2001. It bears an inscription all round it over a 16th century curse, and it is said that since the arrival of the stone there has been disaster for Carlisle, including the outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease, a Flood from the River Eden and many others, although many think it is just a coincidence.\n\nThe main landmark in Carlisle of is of course the Castle, which is nearly 1000 years old, with construction starting in 1093 on the orders of William II (1056 – 1100) of England. He was the son of William the Conqueror (1028 – 1087) who invaded England in 1066.\n\nThe Castle endured attacks throughout it’s history by the invading Scottish, and of course the English who took back the Castle many times. This lasted until the union between England and Scotland in 1603 under one Monarch, as most armies were being lead by the monarch of the time, including Henry VIII who converted the Castle for artillery, and later in 1568 Mary Queen of Scots (1542 – 1857) who was imprisoned here.\n\nI mentioned before about the Stuart Uprising when Bonnie Prince Charlie attacked Carlisle in 1745, and this was one of the major battles the Castle saw. This was also the last battle at Carlisle Castle as England and Scotland were united to form one country.\n\nIt’s a great building and you can go inside and explore the Castle Walls, and look back out over the city. The Castle also contains the Kings Own Royal Border Regiment Museum.\n\nMoving out of the city centre towards the River Eden, is an unusual feature, situated in the middle of a large roundabout. The roundabout isn’t your standard grass mound, it is more a large open hole accessible via subway passages containing a fountain and flowerbeds, with the road running around it above.\n\nThis is called Hardwick Circus, and located just over the main bridge over the River Eden (Mallerstang near the Yorkshire border, through to the Solway Firth), which you can see in the picture below. The rivers Caldew and Petteril also run through the city and run into the Eden.\n\nWe spent a bit of time walking down the river on one of our many trips to the city, and looking back got a perfect view of the bridge from 1815, designed by Sir Robert Smirke (1781 – 1867). It has five large arches, and the overall width of the bridge was doubled in 1932 to accommodate the amount of traffic as the popularity of the car increased.\n\nAlso in this area of the city, just out of shot behind the trees on the left bank of the river is the Sands Centre a large theatre complex with regular appearances by notable comedians and singers.\n\nElsewhere in the city you could visit Hammond’s Pond (Upperby Park) with a number of entrances on Blackwell road, Buchannan Road, Henderson Road and Scalegate Road. As you can see in the picture gallery, there are a number of features, from the miniature railway that runs around part of it, the boating lake that has a wide variety of ducks and birds, and the aviary where birds can come and go as they please and build a nest inside. It’s a pleasant, open space with a lot of different foliage. The colours on the trees came out really well on our last visit as you can see.\n\nThat marks the end of our exploration through the city, which was a fascinating experience.\n\nThere are a number of train lines converging on Carlisle, with Virgin Trains services from London/Birmingham running to Glasgow and Edinburgh via Crewe, Wigan, Lancaster and Preston, Northern Rail trains to Newcastle, Middlesbrough, Whitehaven, Barrow-in-Furness, Leeds, Settle and Lancaster, and Transpennine Express trains between Manchester and Glasgow/Edinburgh.\n\nThe other user of the station is Scotrail, which runs trains to Glasgow from Carlisle via Gretna, Annan, Dumfries, and Kilmarnock and occasionally services continue on to Newcastle or start there. Local buses run to Dumfries and Annan via Gretna and Longtown, and the X95 runs to Edinburgh bus station.\n\nCarlisle is a fascinating, ancient city with many old buildings, and a long history of conflict with neighbouring Scotland, giving it many stories to tell. It is easily accessible by train and road, as the M6 Motorway runs around the city with a number of junctions given access to North, South and Mid Carlisle.\n\nTo find out more about Carlisle’s rich history and to see many old photographs of the city, visit this Facebook page."
