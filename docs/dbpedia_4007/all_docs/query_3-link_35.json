        "text": "Summary\n\nMarlow is an internationally acclaimed artist. His career began in photojournalism, working within zones of conflict in the 1970s such as Northern Ireland and Lebanon. He joined the Sygma photo agency in 1976, and Magnum Photos in 1986. In 1987, alongside Chris Steele-Perkins, Marlow founded Magnumâs London office, being twice appointed President. Throughout his career he received commissions from publications such as The Sunday Times, producing photographs of politicians including Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair and David Cameron. Later work by Marlow shifted to colour photography and became more self-reflective. This extended to long term documentary projects focusing on aspects of British life, such as Liverpool-Looking out to Sea (1982-1990), which documented the decline of the inner city and dockland area of Liverpool under Margaret Thatcher.\n\nIn 2008, Peter Marlow was commissioned by Royal Mail on the 300th anniversary of the completion of the rebuilt St Paulâs Cathedral to photograph six cathedrals for a set of commemorative stamps. Marlow continued this project, photographing the naves of all 42 cathedrals of the Church of England. Shot on large format film and captured at dawn to utilise natural light, his pictures offer a view removed from the modern age. Marlowâs photographic typology of cathedrals was published in a monograph by Merrell with an introduction by Martin Barnes in 2012. The series was exhibited at Coventry Cathedral in 2016."
