        "text": "A Cornerstone grant to help fund essential roof repairs. The church was built in 1890 and is constructed in the High Victorian style. It plays a central role within the local community in Magheralin. Youth Outreach is extremely important within the parish and the Red Door Project plays a major role in bringing young people of different faiths, and indeed no experience of faith, together. This has had a positive impact on relations within the community. Failing gutter and lead detailing on the roof was allowing rainwater to penetrate, whilst the use of cement pointing is helping to trap moisture within the core of the walls. The grant was to help fund a project to replace leadwork and essential roof repairs including some new slates. The external pointing would be partly replaced and new plasterwork carried out internally."
