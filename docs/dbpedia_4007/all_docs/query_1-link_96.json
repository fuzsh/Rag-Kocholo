        "text": "A new chapter in our 900-year history has taken shape as we have brought the Fratry building back to life – the most significant development at Carlisle Cathedral in living memory.\n\nThis vital work has realised the Cathedral’s vision to be a place of discovery, celebration, challenge and opportunity, bringing the building into full use by creating spaces for teaching and learning, cultural activity and use by the community. Fratry work has been made possible by funding from the Friends of Carlisle Cathedral, grant-making trusts, generous donations by members of the public, Cathedral activity and a major contribution of £2m from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF).\n\nArchitect: Feilden Fowles\n\nContractor: Cubby Construction\n\nProject Manager: FWP Group\n\nConsultants: Buttress\n\nStructural Engineer: Structure Workshop\n\nContractors:\n\nStone cutting: Cumbrian Stone\n\nStone installation : Askins + Little\n\nWindows, doors, curtain walling: Martec Engineering\n\nBronze structure : Victoria John of London\n\nM&E installations : JJ Group\n\nThe Fratry Project has been made purpose thanks to the hard work of all the Cathedral staff and our volunteers, the support of all our donors and to the exceptional Project Team. We hope you will enjoy this significant development and ambitious transformation, not only for the Cathedral but for the city and county.\n\nWhat is the Fratry?\n\nIn medieval times the Fratry building was the dining hall of the Cathedral Priory. Over the intervening 800-or-so years it has been used as a kitchen, a place of worship, an arsenal for the King’s Army, a Civil War storeroom, a chapter house, a brewery and granary, a barn and a library.\n\nOur project brings this hugely under-used building back-to-life, with a world-class education and events space at the heart of the Cathedral precinct. The Fratry and Undercroft is now a cultural hub and Carlisle’s newest-oldest exhibition and events space, with a brand new café and meeting point created alongside. The project realises our vision for the Cathedral as a place of discovery, celebration and challenge."
