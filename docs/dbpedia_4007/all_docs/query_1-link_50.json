        "text": "Event Details\n\nA full day Study Event held at Carlisle Cathedral's Fratry Hall looking at the Cathedral Library's collection of rare books and manuscripts. This event is for an in-person audience only and will not be recorded.\n\nThe Library at Carlisle Cathedral is a collection of rare books and manuscripts over 300 years in the making. On Saturday 1 June, the Regional Heritage Centre will travel to the Cathedral’s beautiful Fratry Hall for a full day of presentations exploring this magnificent collection. We will be placing the Cathedral Library into context, examining how its history and collection relate to those of other cathedral libraries as well as private libraries. We will also reflect on the insights the Cathedral Library’s records afford into social and intellectual life in Carlisle since the later seventeenth century. We will conclude the day by considering the Cathedral Library’s future, taking orientation from its past and present histories. Our speakers include Matilda Houston-Brown (Wadham College, Oxford), Lois Wignall (University of Liverpool), Professor Matthew Sangster (University of Glasgow), Dr Matthew Shaw (Queens College, Oxford) and Professor Mark Towsey (University of Liverpool). There's even an optional, pre-bookable lunch in the Cathedral's atmospheric Undercroft. With so much on offer, it's sure to be a fascinating day, so don't miss out - secure your place now.
