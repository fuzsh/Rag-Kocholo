        "text": "Cubby has wide experience of working on heritage buildings such as churches, public buildings, period homes and a variety of other historically important structures.\n\nThe Company was extensively involved in the renovation carried out on Carlisle’s historic Cathedral and has been contracted on a regular basis to manufacture and fit one-of-a-kind timber components on a number of English Heritage properties.\n\nCarlisle Town Hall\n\nA prominent two storey Grade 1 Listed building of Medieval origin, Carlisle’s Old Town Hall mostly dates from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Located in the centre of the city on the Market Square, this splendid building is a much-loved local landmark.\n\nBased on their excellent work on the city’s nearby Cathedral and other local historic buildings, Cubby Construction were contracted to undertake extensive external refurbishment work on the building in 2013. This was followed by a comprehensive renovation of the interior spaces, which included specialist fit-out of a Tourist Information Centre on the first floor which is accessed by a Platform Lift.\n\nThe building’s exemplary Grade 1 listing status meant that Cubby had to work in close association with conservation officers and English Heritage to ensure that the historically important fabric of the structure was conserved and repaired in a sympathetic and period-correct manner.\n\nClose attention to detail played a vital role during the works, helping to return the Old Town Hall to a structurally sound condition that will ensure it remains an attractive, functional civic building at the heart of the city and the local community for many years to come."
