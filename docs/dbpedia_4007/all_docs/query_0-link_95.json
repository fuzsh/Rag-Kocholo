        "text": "UPDATE 18 June, 2019\n\n“He showed me a little thing, the quantity of a hazel nut, lying in the palm of my hand. And it was as round as any ball. I looked upon it with the eye of my understanding, and thought, ‘What may this be?’ And it was answered thus, ‘It is all that is made.’”\n\nJulian of Norwich\n\nJulian scholars seem to cluster into two groups, those who believe her to have been an unlettered peasant with no theological training, and those who perceive in her a rich stream of theological thought whether accessed directly from books, or learnt from others, perhaps taught by Augustinians or Benedictines.\n\nMy reading of Julian is of someone with deeply sophisticated theological thought. Her writing on the atonement and on the Trinity show such depth and so carefully avoid heresy that it is impossible to believe that she had not received considerable theological education in some way.\n\nI am particularly interested in the influence of Augustine of Hippo on her. A comparison of her work and that of Augustine (see, for example Soskice) reveals influence and difference. For me, a particular interest not examined by any of the scholarship I have found so far (please feel free to send me any!) is the connection between the hazel not metaphor and Augustine’s conception of time. The post below is an old one of mine examining the Cloud of Unknowing as the source of a technique of prayer, based on this Augustinian concept of time. The Cloud is often mi-read as if it suggests that any prayer phrase is fine. In fact, the Cloud author is determined that the prayer word must be one syllable.\n\nIt is almost certain that Julian knew the Cloud. Her reference to the hazel nut, or rather the hazel nut sized ball is tantalisingly brief but matches perfectly the single-pointedness that the author of the Cloud is aiming for.\n\nI continue to teach this single syllable prayer to individuals. ‘Teach’ is probably too strong a word. There is nothing to teach really, just a suggestion of this form of prayer and some people take that up and some don’t. Those who do continue to report its helpfulness. It is the technique I use most often when driving. Starting with a hymn to the Holy Spirit, a Taizé Veni, Sancte Spiritus …, a period of the Jesus Prayer and then the single syllable ‘God’. Interestingly driving is the closest I come to the physical labour that was always a part of the contemplative life. My body and part of my mind is occupied, concentrated even, leaving me free to pray. The desert monks wove baskets. Modern contemplative communities make cheese, bread or beer. Many of the women solitaries I know practise some form of simple craftwork in a similar way.\n\nThis famous quote from Julian provides further suggestions for the single syllable:\n\n“The Trinity is our maker,” writes Julian,\n\n“the Trinity is our keeper,\n\nthe Trinity is our everlasting lover,\n\nthe Trinity is our endless joy and our bliss”\n\n*\n\nJoy\n\nBliss\n\n***\n\nThis post is a combination of three previous posts on The Cloud of Unknowing and some additional sections (marked as Updates) on my experience of practising and teaching the technique of prayer proposed by The Cloud.\n\n3/10/18\n\nUPDATE:\n\nA common reaction to my posts and talks on The Cloud’s method of prayer, is that ‘I do that already’, or ‘It’s just what I do’ and the speaker goes on to say that they use a prayer phrase or the Jesus Prayer. Those form of phrase prayers are powerful means for praying, however, the author of The Cloud is proposing something DIFFERENT. My personal experience and my experience in teaching this ‘one-syllable’ method is that it leads to a DIFFERENT kind of experience. I am not saying better or worse.\n\nI will continue to teach the Jesus Prayer and use of a phrase of Scripture as part of lectio and other ways of prayer, but I would like to see where this one-syllable prayer leads. It may not (certainly won’t!) work for everyone. But it is not the same as other methods of prayer and I think we should take The Cloudseriously.\n\nThe one-syllable is the essential matter of this prayer.\n\n***\n\n“The moment is not properly an atom of time but an atom of eternity …”\n\nKierkegaard\n\nYou will be able to picture, no doubt, the orange robes of the Krishna consciousness devotees who have been a feature of life on London’s Oxford Street and in other cities since the 1960s:\n\nHare Krishna Hare Krishna\n\nKrishna Krishna Hare Hare\n\nHare Rama Hare Rame\n\nRama Rama Hare Hare\n\nThe George Harrison version of the mantra captures the zeitgeist of the time perfectly.\n\nAt the same time, Christians began to look at our own spiritual traditions to discover mantras and other methods of prayer. Some people saw the Orthodox Jesus Prayer as a sort of mantra. Others developed Centering Prayer, and other techniques, suggesting adopting a sacred word or phrase.\n\nJohn Main founded the World Community for Christian Meditation and proposed using the Aramaic word from the end of the book of Revelation, Maranatha, Come Lord!\n\nJohn Main like many others picked on what had been a somewhat neglected English book of the fourteenth century which seemed to suggest something similar: The Cloud of Unknowing.\n\nWe don’t know who wrote The Cloud but most scholars agree it was probably a Carthusian hermit-monk, who was also a priest, and most likely – because of the English he used – lived in the East Midlands, a form of English very similar to Chaucer. Those of us who studied Chaucer at school will well remember:\n\nWhan that Aprille with his shoures sote\n\nThe droghte of Marche hath perced to the rote,\n\nAnd bathed every veyne in swich licour,\n\nOf which vertu engendred is the flour;\n\nThe Cloud author, however, does not suggest a multi word mantra or poly-syllabic word like Maranatha. He repeatedly insists on praying with one single, mono-syllabic word. He suggests ‘God’ or ‘Love’ and using that repeatedly to batter the cloud that separates us from God. He suggests that the word be a ‘dart of longing love’, an arrow piercing the cloud. Later he says that it doesn’t really matter what word we choose – ‘sin’ or ‘out’ would do. The most important thing is that the word must be only one syllable.\n\nThat is interesting. I think some of those who have referred to The Cloud to support use of a Christian mantra have missed the author’s point about this. The word itself does not matter; that it must be of only one syllable is not optional.\n\nThe text of The Cloud also reinforces this, using simple monosyllabic words whenever possible and avoiding complex latinisms and polysyllabic words. I recommend the version by Fr John-Julian recently published by Paraclete Press. But the original Middle English is not difficult and worth persevering with.\n\nHere is the author of The Cloud explaining his technique for the first time:\n\nWhen you apply yourself to this work, and feel by grace that you are called by God, lift up your heart to God with a humble stirring of love. And mean God who created you, and redeemed you, and who has graciously called you to this work: and admit no other thought of God. And yet not all of these, but only as it pleases you; for a bare intent directed to God is sufficient, without any other object besides himself. And if it pleases you to have this intent wrapped up and folded in a word, so that you might have a better hold on it, take just a little word of one syllable; for such a word is better than one of two syllables, for the shorter it is, the more fitting it is to the work of the spirit. And such a word is this word GOD or this word LOVE. Choose whichever of these two you wish, or another as it pleases you: whichever word you like best that is of one syllable. And fasten this word to your heart, so that it is never separated from it, no matter what happens.\n\nJordan Kirk is clear that readers have not read The Cloud carefully enough:\n\n“Although readers of the Cloud have regularly (and, to my mind, inexplicably) referred to the “litil worde” as “preferably” or “ideally” monosyllabic, in fact the Cloud-author admits no compromise on this point.\n\nHe has only one stipulation: you can choose whatever word you like, as long as it be monosyllabic. To use a multisyllabic word is not to perform the work of unknowing in a less than ideal manner; it is not to perform it at all.”\n\nIn another helpful passage Jordan writes:\n\n“The purpose of the Cloud’s technique is to do away with all the thoughts in your mind in order that the intellect may encounter the very absence of thought, the so-called cloud of unknowing. This encounter will be accomplished by means of the “litil worde,” which, according to an improbable figure, you use simultaneously to bludgeon your thoughts and to pound against the cloud. The double operation of unknowing consists in this blow — to which the Cloud-author gives the name “loue put” (love-thrust) — which takes place when you turn the word into an accouterment of battle, at once a sword you bash against the cloud of unknowing and a shield to keep your thoughts at bay. In being wielded in this manner, the word produces “þis lityl blynde loue put, when it is betyng upon þis derke cloude of unknowing, alle oþer þinges put doun and forзeten” (this little blind love-thrust, when it is beating upon this dark cloud of unknowing, all other things having been put down and forgotten; 58).\n\nIf the word of one syllable lends itself to this operation, it is because it can be kept whole. The Cloud-author explains that your importunate thoughts will constantly attempt to get you to explain the word, analyze it, that is, break it up into its parts, but this is what you must not do.\n\nзif any þouзt prees apon þee to aske þee what þou woldest haue, answere him wiþ no mo wordes bot wiþ þis o worde. And зif he profre þee of his grete clergie to expoune þee þat worde and to telle þee þe condicions of þat worde, sey him þat þou wilt haue it al hole, and not broken ne undon. (28–9)\n\nIf any thought presses upon you to ask you what you are seeking, answer him with no more words than this one word. And if he offers to explicate that word for you, using his impressive learning, and to tell you about its various aspects, tell him that you want to have it entirely whole, and not broken or undone.”\n\nI have been using the Jesus Prayer for over 35 years, since my mid-teens. It is as much a part of me as breathing. But just before Christmas in 2017 I thought I would take the author of The Cloud at his word (so to speak) and use just one word. I didn’t feel quite ready to adopt ‘sin’. ‘Love’ seemed a bit too emotion-laden. I went for ‘God’.\n\nSince then I have been using the word ‘God’, aloud whenever I can (driving, walking, in the bath etc) and silently dropping it into my consciousness at the end of each in and out breath when I can’t. The rhythm, the pace is slow. When I first started I happened to be somewhere where a neighbouring farmer was installing some fence posts. Hammering them deep into the ground with a sledge hammer. The pace is similar to that and it’s an image that has stuck with me, driving the word deep into my heart, the slow swing of the breath, the drawing back of the hammer and the next blow, repeating the cycle over and over again.\n\nI‘ve been amazed at the effect it has had on me and the significance it feels to have had in my prayer life. I still use the Jesus Prayer formally for two or three periods of 15 minutes a day but the remainder of the time it is the word ‘God’ that I use.\n\nThe inner experience of this is hard to describe and I am conscious that talking about one’s own prayer life isn’t quite the done thing.\n\nThe author of The Cloud writes about ‘naked intent’ repeatedly. How can we have only one intention, closeness to God, piercing the cloud of unknowing and not the multiple, mixed motives that characterise us most of the time?\n\nI don’t want to make any great claims, but using this one word I have experienced something closer to ‘naked intent’ than I have ever experienced before. There are three reasons I think, for this:\n\n1 Firstly, and strangely, because it is deeply unsatisfying. The Jesus Prayer is complete in itself, it names our Saviour and makes a request of him. Job done. The single word leaves me wanting more. The constant repetition renders the word almost meaningless. Yet that emptiness, that nothingness, nonsense-ness also makes it transparent, so that when I come to pray the Office or Mass the liturgy seems to complete the word, and the word seems to continue in and through the liturgy in a way not possible with a more complex phrase. The word can repeat itself throughout the worship in a way that the Jesus Prayer can’t.\n\n2 Secondly, one of the best ways I can think of describing the experience is physical nakedness. Unless we are naturists we so rarely find ourselves naked in another’s presence other than with a marital partner. Even the doctor normally sees only a part of us. The nakedness of the single word of prayer locking each utterance to the present moment is like the nakedness of the first sexual encounter, not the consummation, but preceding it, the exposure. The moment of utter vulnerability, of utter surprise and unknowing, mixed with delight and anticipation. We often think of sexual passion as a metaphor for our relationship with God, we all know that the Song of Songs and other biblical texts point us to that. But I wonder if, in our sex-obsessed culture we make enough of chastity? Desire examined for its own sake, enjoyed and appreciated without the need for consummation. And not just sexual desire. How about allowing ourselves the time to linger in that liminal moment of hunger without eating, or not getting or knowing what the next job will be, of not being in control.\n\n3 Thirdly, another image for how this works is the reason, I think, the author is so insistent on the word being just one syllable. If our prayer is to enable us to experience the eternity of God’s existence/presence, if the opposite of that eternal ‘moment’ is time passing, perhaps one way of experiencing eternity is to be totally present in just one moment, the smallest possible unit of time, the present moment, so our prayer word needs to be the shortest possible duration, one syllable, one moment. If we can focus all our attentiveness, all our own presence in that spilt moment we will experience, we are experiencing eternity. Time splits and opens us to eternity.\n\nThis last idea relates particularly to an Augustinian understanding of time and eternity. Two articles have pointed me in this direction and encouraged me to use this technique in praying:\n\nThis essay by Jordan D Kirk, has resonated deeply with the effect my reading of The Cloud has had on my own prayer life in recent weeks. Jordan is working on a book length study of mysticism and has re-worked his paper into a chapter which is very good indeed and fills out the paper somewhat. I am grateful for an advance read of the chapter and look forward to the book being published.\n\nAnother essay, by Eleanor Johnson, is also important in understanding the prayer method proposed by the author of The Cloud:\n\nFeeling Time, Will, and Words: Vernacular Devotion in the Cloud of Unknowing\n\nThe quote from Kierkegaard at the start of this post seems to suggest something similar to Johnson’s ideas on the monosyllabic word as the shortest possible unit of time and therefore as closest to eternity. There is an interesting article on time here, also see here. I am working on this concept and on Augustine’s view of this and hope to write more in the future.\n\nIt is early days yet. But this practice does seem to create a softening or expanding of the heart. I have found myself experiencing the gift of tears in prayer and accessing an outpouring of poetry in my writing. I don’t know how these relate to each other. It is not about emotion or angst, quite the opposite, almost the simplest experience I have known. I would be interested in the experience of others. Monastic authors talk of purity of heart / single heartedness – the single syllable can be a way of getting close to that. It is a technique that seems to make living in the present moment possible.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nOver this last few months I have used opportunities to introduce this prayer to individuals and groups. I don’t think I have found exactly the right way of teaching the method yet but several individuals have reported extensively on the profound effect this prayer has had on them, here are two extracts quoted with permission:\n\n“When X left me and I was on my own I didn’t think I’d ever be able to pray again. All those words seemed too much, choking and just made me angry. Just using one word has been sort of liberating. I couldn’t use ‘Love’, that word has been ruined for me. But ‘God’ works. I don’t know what it is, but that’s OK.”\n\n*\n\n“I only came to the Mindfulness course because someone said it would help me deal with stress. The breathing works really well, and it does help. But it’s the use of one word over and over that has, well, sort of changed my life. I use the word ‘Love’, it kind of means all the best moments of my life. When I do this I feel part of something much bigger than me, like I belong, that I’m not one my own. Almost like there’s ‘someone’ there. You’ll be pleased to hear this: I’ve started going to church. Well, the cathedral actually. I just sit at the back on Sunday afternoon while the choir are singing. It’s the best place I know to do this. You haven’t made me a Christian yet, but I certainly want more of this.”\n\n*\n\nThe ‘cloud of unknowing’ is not a cloud that will part in this life, if it did we would be destroyed by the reality of God. The cloud protects us. When RS Thomas writes of the presence of God as the presence that has just left the room, he is describing how we can only cope with seeing God out of the corner of an eye. Like Moses who could only see the backside of God on the mountain and whose face still had to be covered afterwards it shone so brightly.\n\nThomas in his famous poem The Absence writes:\n\n…\n\nIt is a room I enter\n\nfrom which someone has just\n\ngone, the vestibule for the arrival\n\nof one who has not yet come.\n\nI modernise the anachronism\n\nof my language, but he is no more here\n\nthan before. Genes and molecules\n\nhave no more power to call\n\nhim up than the incense of the Hebrews\n\nat their altars. My equations fail\n\nas my words do. What resources have I\n\nother than the emptiness without him of my whole\n\nbeing, a vacuum he may not abhor?\n\nTwo other poems can help us here, I think. One The Panther by the poet Rilke, and the other The White Tiger by R S Thomas.\n\nThey are about the cloud of unknowing. For Rilke the bars of the panther’s cage only occasionally allow him to see through the bars:\n\n“an image, [that] enters in,\n\nrushes down through the tensed, arrested muscles,\n\nplunges into the heart and is gone.”\n\nFor Thomas, the Tiger:\n\n“beautiful\n\nas God must be beautiful …\n\nIt was the colour of moonlight\n\non snow\n\nand as quiet\n\nas moonlight, but breathing\n\nas you can imagine that\n\nGod breathes within the confines\n\nof our definition of him, agonising\n\nover immensities that will not return.”\n\nThe colour of moonlight on snow. No colour at all. But totally present, totally real.\n\n***\n\nWhat is clear from the communications I am receiving from people who trybthis is that there are many people who have found praying with a one syllable word helpful. Some have mentioned contact with Indian Christians through the teaching of Bede Griffiths, Shantinavam and Abhishiktananda (who I will quote from extensively later), most have come to this by their own intuition. A few mention the gift of tongues leading into this, one sound from that forming their word.\n\nThree questions stand out:\n\n– How does this experience relate to praying in tongues?\n\n– How does it relate to Jesus?\n\n– Are there any other places where praying with a monosyllabic word are suggested?\n\n*\n\nIn Relation to Praying in Tongues\n\nIn the article cited below, Eleanor Johnson writes about the place of ‘nonsense’ in the technique suggested by the author of The Cloud. This fits with his suggestions that any word of one syllable will do and that the meaning is irrelevant. We all know that when you think about any word too much it becomes nonsense. As children acquire language and particularly young teenagers they find this nonsense quality of words particularly amusing. It seems to be a phase they often go through.\n\nI have my doubts about the usefulness of the nonsense image. Just as children are now taught artificial phonics through made up, but phonetically correct, words, but the author doesn’t suggest that. In fact he chooses two powerful words God and Love to start with. I suspect that most of us need the positive connotations of words like that to sustain us in this sort of prayer. I have only been practising like this for a few months so can’t claim any great expertise but I certainly don’t feel drawn to ‘sin’ one of the author’s other suggestions. I wonder whether for a new-comer the author would always have suggested positive words? Or even how serious he was about the use of the word sin …\n\nAmong the words that some of you who have been in touch use are:\n\nHeart\n\nHome\n\nLord\n\nCome\n\nDance\n\nDepth\n\nThis is a good list. I suspect that most of us need a word with a positive vibe. We come to prayer in various states, sometimes tired and weary, sometimes in an even darker place than that, even after appropriate introductory prayers a positive mental state is needed.\n\nPraying in tongues has been a part of my experience since I experienced baptism in the Spirit as a fourteen year old. However, it is not a form of prayer that is, for me, sustained for a long period of time. Using the word ‘God’ in the Cloud’s way of prayer does often lead into or from a time of praying in tongues but the mono-syllable is one way to maintain this prayer in my daily life.\n\nIn terms of the inner feeling or sensation I think there is much in common between the way of The Cloud and the gift of tongues; it is a suspension of the rational mind, a stepping out of mind-consciousness into another place and there is a liminal quality to it.\n\nA common experience when I meet and talk to Pentecostal and charismatic Christians is conversation about how the practices of the spiritual life often associated with the Catholic stream of Christianity can enable them to sustain prayer on a daily basis. One danger of charismatic spirituality is the need for a ‘high’ every now and again to top up the spiritual feeling. Allowing these intense experiences to lead into contemplative ones can build resilience and sustainability.\n\n*\n\nThe place of Jesus in the Way of the Cloud and another source for the one-syllable prayer\n\nThe Jesus Prayer is clearly a Jesus-centred prayer. The way of the monosyllable is less obviously so. I always begin prayer with an invocation of the Trinity and prayer to the Holy Spirit – normally the Orthodox prayer “Heavenly King …” and then a time of singing “Veni Sancte Spiritus.” It is important to remember that The Cloud, like Julian’s Showings assume a normal liturgical and sacramental life within a Bible-based, orthodox, Christian community.\n\nHowever, the experience of the Way of the Cloud seems to – as it should – relate to Jesus at a more fundamental level. I happened to dip into the writings of Abhishiktananda as I was thinking about this and came across some remarkable passages. Abhishiktananda was a French Christian monk (Henri le Saux) who travelled to India and lived the life of a Hindu renunciate while remaining faithful to his Christian faith and monastic and priestly vocation.\n\nAbhishiktananda stresses that the point of all we do is to enter into the inner silence which …\n\n“Can be summed up in one Hebrew phrase of Psalm 65, which Jerome translates: silentium tibi laus. Silence is praise for you. Silence in prayer, silence in thanksgiving, prayer and adoration, silence in meditation, silence inside and outside as the most essential preparation for this stillness of the soul in which alone the Spirit can work at his pleasure.\n\nIn the old tradition of Vedic yajna (sacrifice) four priests had to sit around the Vedi (altar). One of them had the function of performing the rite and meanwhile repeating the mantras … Another was in charge of chanting the hymns … The third invoked the devas … But the fourth one, the brahmana priest par excellence, was to remain silent, whispering as it were without any interruption an almost inarticulate OM. Yet it was that silent OM which was considered as the thread uniting all the different parts of yajna and giving to the whole its definitive value.”\n\nFurther Shore, pp 117-118\n\nOm is a meaningless syllable, but it is also the sacred sound, sometimes called the seed syllable. Two more passages stand out for me in Abhishiktananda’s writing, the first:\n\n“God is outside all time. And eternity is present in each moment of time.\n\n‘The smallest abyss.’\n\n*\n\nWe must leap just the right distance,\n\nor else we shall miss our aim and find ourselves further off than ever,\n\non a ‘further shore’ which is not the true one.\n\n*\n\nGod is too close to us. That is why we constantly fail to find him.\n\nWe turn God into an object – and God escapes our grasp.\n\nWe turn him into an idea – but ideas pass him by.\n\nSo Mary Magdalene was too much taken up with her thoughts about Jesus\n\nto be able to recognise him in the gardener …”\n\nThe Further Shore p. 121\n\nThis theology of time and eternity is utterly Augustinian and surely that held by the author of The Cloudwhich explains his reliance on the shortest possible prayer? I don’t know where the phrase ‘the smallest abyss’ comes from, it is perfect. As is the description of God being too close to us for us to see him. This is exactly R S Thomas’s presence that has just left the room, or the movement that we can never quite catch, no matter how quickly we turn our heads.\n\nAbhishiktananda embraced the Hindu devotion to the word ‘Om’. I am not advocating that western Christians adopt this practice wholesale. I have only once experienced the use of this word in Christian circles. It was at Park Place, the Pastoral Centre of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portsmouth and must have been some time in the late 1990s. Staying there for a conference I happened to wander into the chapel when the sisters, who at that time ran the centre, were praying. They were mostly Indian (I think a Franciscan community) and used many Christian mantras in their prayers, often including the word ‘Om’. I was very interested in this and spoke at length to some of the sisters about it.\n\nThe second passage from Abhishiktananda is even more profound and describes, I believe, exactly how Jesus relates to the mono-syllable, the Way of the Cloud:\n\nThe OM which our rishis heard resounding in their souls,\n\nwhen they descended to the greatest depths in themselves,\n\ndeeper than their thoughts and deeper than all their desires,\n\nin the existential solitude of being,\n\nthe OM which sounds in the rustling leaves shaken by the wind,\n\nthe OM which howls in the storm\n\nand murmurs in the gentle breeze,\n\nthe OM which roars in the rushing torment\n\nand the gentle murmur of the river flowing peacefully down to the sea,\n\nthe OM of the spheres making their way across the sky,\n\nand the OM that throbs at the core of the atom.\n\n*\n\nThat which sings in the song of birds,\n\nthat which is heard in the call of beasts in the jungle,\n\nthe OM of people laughing and the OM of their sighs,\n\nthe OM that vibrates in their thoughts and in all their desires,\n\nthe OM of their words of warfare, of love, or trade,\n\nthe OM that Time and History utter on their way,\n\nthe OM uttered by Space when entering into Time.\n\n*\n\nThis OM suddenly burst out, whole and entire,\n\nin a corner of space and at a point of time,\n\nin its indivisible fullness,\n\nwhen in Mary’s womb was born as Son of man,\n\nthe Word, the Son of God.\n\nDiary pp 189-190\n\n*\n\nThe Word that God uttered in the beginning, the divine logos, the Word that is Jesus. This is the “deep calling to deep” abyssus abyssum invocat, of the soul meeting God. The Spirit groaning within us. The blade slicing into the thinnest fragment of time to open eternity.\n\n***\n\nREADING\n\nWhen the new edition of the complete works of John of the Cross came out last year (review/note from me here) I began re-reading the prose works (I have read his poetry pretty much constantly over the years) and a number of commentaries and books about his writing. That reading led me back to David Knowles’ The English Mystical Tradition. The chapter in that on The Cloud of Unknowing is particularly strong and makes an excellent comparison between the teaching of The Cloud and that of John of the Cross. It is well worth reading.\n\nThis essay by Jordan D Kirk, has resonated deeply with the effect my reading of The Cloud. the prayer method proposed by the author of The Cloud:\n\nFeeling Time, Will, and Words: Vernacular Devotion in the Cloud of Unknowing\n\nThe Cloud has been much favoured by the ‘spiritual but not religious’ and given that ‘all translation is treachery’ has not been well served by all its translators. Maggie Ross has written a splendidly frank view of the various versions of The Cloud:\n\nDifferent Versions of the Cloud of Unknowing\n\nRoss is an Anglican solitary and lives the life, her recent Silence: A User’s Guide (in two volumes) is fundamental reading on the contemplative/solitary life. I preached this sermon recently which picks up on some of the themes in The Cloud, notably the word ‘behold’, and was profoundly influenced by Ross and her earlier books.\n\nTEXT\n\nThe Cloud of Unknowing and the Book of Privy Counselling, Ed Hodgson, Phyllis, Early English Text Society/OUP 1944 (the 1982 edition is the most recent and the one usually used as a reference text. Eg by Gallacher – below).\n\nThis is the ‘base text’ for study of The Cloud. reproducing the best available reading of the Middle English text with extensive notes. Given Maggie Ross’s comments and my own experience of the various dodgy translations that are around I am making increased use of this, the Middle English (I studied Chaucer at A’ Level) is not as difficult as it looks at first glance. I also find that the more familiar I become with sections of the original the more dissatisfied I am with the translations available. I wish I could find a recording of the Middle English text being read, let me know if you find one.\n\nThe TEAMS Middle English Texts version ed by Patrick Gallacher, it is a version of the ME text using modern orthography which makes reading a little easier. It is also more readily available. Maggie Ross is not keen on the introduction and it certainly is not particularly incisive on the practice of prayer but it is a good overview of the Tradition. The notes are very good and update Hodgson often referring to other modern translations. More importantly it is available online and is interactive which makes looking up notes etc very easy. HERE\n\n**\n\nTranslations\n\nThe Complete Cloud of Unknowing with the Letter of Privy Counsel, Fr John-Julian OJN, Paraclete Press 2015\n\nThis has become my go-to translation. I like the style used and most of all the notes, a facing page for every page of text from The Cloud, are extremely detailed. Even when the reader might disagree with a choice made there is always either an explanation or pointing out of alternatives. The introduction is also very helpful and there is some useful material in appendices.\n\n*\n\nThe Cloud of Unknowing and Other Writings by an English Mystic of the Fourteenth Century with a Commentary on the Cloud by Fr Augustine Baker OSB, Ed. McCann, Justin, Abbot, Burns and Oates 1924 (1960 edition)\n\nSee Maggie Ross’s comments on this, which are right:\n\n“Oh dear, there are a number of problems here. First, while he claims to have used an assortment of mss, his version differs from Gallacher/Underhill enough so that one suspects he is privileging the Ampleforth manuscript, which he calls the ‘second recension’, and which is very different from the Hodgson text. Next, he has paraphrased, often quite patronizingly. His filter seems to be an effort to make this radical manuscript acceptable to a highly conservative, anti- ‘modernist’ pre-Vatican II Roman Catholic church. He has kept ‘thee’ and ‘thou’ and the -eth endings but there is something deliberately antiquated, a bit kitsch olde worlde about his paraphrases for reasons I haven’t been able to put my finger on—yet. He also censors phrases such as that in chapter 12 about private parts—but we have to cut Underhill and McCann a little slack in this regard as they were working in the 1930s. McCann somehow makes the Cloud author sound precious, which he most certainly is not.”\n\nPocket and nicely bound versions are regularly available second-hand but I find it so difficult to read that I don’t use them.\n\n*\n\nA Book of Contemplation the which is called the Cloud of Unknowing, in the which a soul is oned with God, Underhill, Evelyn, Watkins, 1912 (1956 ed.)\n\nPocket versions of this turn up second-hand regularly and I have one that I carry with me so refer to quite often.\n\nMaggie Ross: “This is the closest of the modernized versions to the Hodgson benchmark but has some curious interpolations about spiritual direction, possibly due to her contact with von Hugel. She has not changed many words and for the modern reader may have not changed enough, but her version hast the advantage of clarity without intruding too many anachronisms. She has kept thee and thou and the -eth endings but somehow these are not intrusive as with McCann. This version is published online at several sites including the Christian Classics Ethereal Library. Type ‘Cloud of Unknowing Underhill’ into your search engine. She omits the author’s hyperbolic phrases that would offend genteel sensibilities, such as the mention of cutting off of private parts in chapter 12.”\n\n*\n\nThe Cloud of Unknowing and Other Works, Wolters, Clifton, Penguin, 1961 (1978)\n\nThis is disappointing given that it is the Penguin version. Not a book I refer to.\n\nMaggie Ross: “Wolters’ is an outright translation and he has the same concerns as McCann to make this work acceptable to a very conservative Roman Catholic audience on the cusp of Vatican II. His version has the advantage that he has dropped the ‘thee’, ‘thou’, and ‘-eth’, but sometimes his paraphrases amount to Counter-Reformation glosses, and he seems to leave out or condense sections. He claims to be using Hodgson, but he also says he has consulted McCann, and, like McCann, he leans towards Ampleforth and the Latin (the original text is in English). As I create a parallel text of these versions, there are often times when I wonder if Wolters and McCann are using the same Middle English text as I and some of the others are.”\n\n*\n\nThe Cloud of Unknowing, ed. Walsh, James, Paulist Press 1981 (Classics of Western Spirituality)\n\nMaggie Ross is, in my view, unnecessarily harsh. The introductions are good and the notes helpful. I use this volume a lot as a check. It is, as Maggie suggests, clearly written with an orthodox Catholic standpoint, but that is helpful as an antidote to some less than orthodox perspectives that are common.\n\nMaggie Ross: “Walsh tries to make the Cloud-author into a neo-scholastic, which he most certainly is not. His translation is prolix and full of the ‘experience’ problem. He is prone to making absurd and completely unsupportable claims such as: the practice the Cloud teaches cannot be undertaken by non-Christians. His scriptural and other citations are often wildly scattershot, not really seeming to relate to the text properly, as if he had a lot of references on slips of paper and threw them all up in the air and then wrote down whatever came to hand. He did the same with Julian’s texts. However, his text has the advantage that it includes Richard Methley’s comments in the footnotes. To my ear (but maybe this is due to the fact that I dislike his translation so much) he sometimes sounds fatuous.”\n\n*\n\nThe Cloud of Unknowing and the Book of Privy Counselling, Ed, Johnston, William, Doubleday, 1973\n\nMaggie Ross really doesn’t like this version. She is right in what she says. However, it is a useful reference book in terms of understanding the reception and use of The Cloud. It also reads well. I like Johnston and find his drawing on the Eastern/Buddhist tradition very illuminating and helpful, particularly at the level of experience.\n\nMaggie Ross:“This purported translation—only in part; it is really more a platform for Johnston himself—is so strange and has so many modern interpolations that I often wonder if he is using the same text as the rest of this group as a basis for what he is writing. Johnston comes from a humanistic psychology and human potential movement background, and is anachronistically continually looking at the Cloudthrough the lens of the much later John of the Cross. Johnston feels free to move paragraphs around or omit them altogether, to interpolate material that simply isn’t there or even implicit. I’m not quite sure what this book is, but it doesn’t have a lot to do with The Cloud of Unknowing.”\n\n*\n\nThe Cloud of Unknowing With the Book of Privy Counsel, Butcher, Carmen Avecedo, Shambhala, 2009.\n\nNot mentioned by Ross. She wouldn’t like it! This is definitely one for the ‘spiritual but not religious’. It reads well. I have been listening to the Audible version which is very easy to hear. But it is more like using The Message version of the Bible, not a translation but a meditation, Jim Cotter would call it an ‘unfolding’ of the text. Good for lectio, but needing to refer to the original.\n\n*\n\nParaphrase\n\nThe Cloud of Unknowing for Everyone, Obbard, Elizabeth Ruth\n\nAgain, not a translation, and it doesn’t pretend to be. A useful book for lectio and prayer. Obbard’s books are deceptively simple, with charming (perhaps rather too charming) cartoon like sketches – think, Good News Bible. In fact the text is rather profound and very helpful, Obbard is always orthodox and accessible.\n\n**\n\nCommentaries and Notes\n\nThe Cloud of Unknowing: An Introduction\n\nJohn P.H. Clark\n\nVol 1: Introduction, 1995\n\nVol 2 Notes on the Cloud, 1996\n\nVol 3: Notes on the Book of Privy Counselling, 1995\n\nAnalecta Cartusiana 119:4,5 and 6, Salzburg\n\nThese three slim volumes, if you can get hold of them, are, again, essential reading for anyone studying The Cloud, especially for engaging with Hodgson’s Middle English text. Immensely detailed, wise and sensible I use these all the time.\n\nThis series will lead the reader to the Augustine Baker tradition of the English Benedictine Congregation which is such an important part of the reception of The Cloud.\n\n*\n\nThe English Mystical Tradition, Knowles, David, Harper 1961\n\nAs already mentioned Knowles’ chapter on The Cloud is excellent. The whole book is important to read and has worn remarkably well given when it was written.\n\n*\n\nEnglish Spirituality, Mursell, Gordon, SPCK, 2001 (2 volumes).\n\nA brilliant overview of spirituality. Mursell has a superb writing style and makes excellent connections across spirituality, literature, theology and the different spiritualities described. The section on The Cloud is relatively short but a must read. Another for the essential reading list.\n\n**\n\nUPDATED CONCLUSION 3/10/18\n\nTeaching Mindfulness it is clear to me that this is a pathway for faith, a way that doesn’t do violence to people and allows them, very gently, to experience the presence of God as the Other who is as close to us as our breathing. Use of the one-syllable method is a helpful next step. There is a tenderising, softening effect that cuts through negative attitudes to religion as well as the hardened crust that life creates on our hearts. The suspension of the intellect, the rational mind is especially important in inoculating the mind against the poison that so much of our anti-religion, anti-mystical training plants there.\n\n4 Comments\n\nfabfininbarOctober 29, 2018 at 6:24 pm EditMaggie Ross is pretty brutal! Any thoughts on the new Penguin Translation by AC Spearing? I like the Carmen Butcher translation, it reads really well. I have the TEAMS but I haven’t ventured to try yet! Just found this site yesterday looking for articles on the Cloud, thanks for this all the best.LikeReply\n\nFather Richard PeersOctober 29, 2018 at 9:02 pm EditShe certainly doesn’t mince her words! Butcher is a paraphrase not a translation in my view, good read and the Audible version is easy to listen to, Penguin not at all bad … Thanks for the Feedback! Blessings.Liked by 1 personReply\n\nNeil WorkOctober 29, 2018 at 7:30 pm EditThank you so much for this blog, Ive only just come across it. The Cloud writer’s insistence on one syllable has interested me for years.\n\nI once came across Fr. Augustine Baker’s commentary on the Cloud. It may have been the Underhill version,(it was in a relative’s library).\n\nI looked up what he said about the single syllable. If I remember correctly, he appeared to say this was not to be taken too literally, that, for example, a phrase was o.k. or something else short. He gives the example of one of St. Francis’ brothers, whose prayer was to simply run. (I had to think of Forest Gump running across America!) .\n\nI once put this apparent puzzle to an Augustinian monk. He said continuous prayer will start off with many words (like this, he said, praying quickly ) which over time will distill & concentrate until there are no words.\n\nI notice that in ‘Privy Counsel’ the author emphasises that everything we can think about God is contained in the word ‘ is’.\n\nI feel very cautious about the ‘Centering Prayer’ movement, not least because the CDF letter from then Cardinal Ratzinger in the 1990’s so obviously referred to some of what it was doing. The introduction to the Cloud is so clear about the need to be orthodox, not to pick bits & leave others. In this vein , I like what the writer says later about people who do not submit to church teaching – they have some vice they want to continue with.. There aint no short cuts.LikeReply\n\nFather Richard PeersOctober 29, 2018 at 9:05 pm EditInteresting, lots of people say one syllable or a few it doesn’t matter, that may be true but that is not what the Cloud says. I am not do cautious about the CP stuff, they at least try and address what original sin/falleness might be instead of just ignoring it. I don’t think I was ready for The Cloud 30 years ago. CP really helped me then.LikeReply\n\nPlease let me know your experience of this prayer, I am keen to develop ways of introducing and teaching it.Advertisements\n\nM.Ed., Institute of Education\n\nIn the last fifteen years or so I’ve enjoyed working with Christians from Pentecostal churches and introducing them to elements of my own tradition that are new to them, just as they have challenged and encouraged me in my understanding and experience of the faith. Among the greatest gifts I have received from them is the gift of fasting as a serious discipline of prayer. I wrote about this on my previous blog and will move that post to this blog in due course: for now, it is here.\n\nOne of the elements in my own practice that I am often asked about is retreats. Where should I go? What do you do?\n\nBelow is a a long piece in three parts. In the first I make some observations about retreats. It is not a “How To” guide to retreats, jut some random thoughts I have had while being on retreat this week (the week of Advent 3, 2019). The second part is a rambling, stream of consciousness note-book of this retreat. I have been making retreats since I was fifteen. For many of the retreats I’ve made I have kept a notebook. I have twenty-seven of them, some more complete than others. They are not really journals, often consisting of not much more than a series of quotes on whatever I have been reading or reflecting on. I’m not sure they show much ‘progress’ as such but they do show change. They are very useful sources of quotes, thoughts and research over the years.\n\nI am not expecting anyone to read every word of the notebook below. Scan it and it will give you the pattern of what I do and the way I keep a notebook. I have edited for publication, omitting some of the self-reflection on my life at the moment and my experiences in prayer as well as mentions of the living. Occasionally I have added rather more explanation than I would for myself.\n\nI decided that the best way to answer “What do you do on retreat?” is the format here, a sort of timetable with notes. I realise that I probably learned this style from the journals of Thomas Merton, of which this is a pale imitation.\n\nI have removed references to intercessory prayer although that is a big part of what I do on retreat. The formal prayer elements of the retreat (Office, Mass, Meditation, Rosary, lectio) should be understood within the opportunity this intense Christian living gives for spontaneous praise and, especially important for me, expressing this in tongues. This is an important part of retreat for me. The opportunity retreat provides to pay attention more closely is always a spark for praise.\n\nI read a lot in an ordinary week so a retreat is a chance to read intensely too. Often I have picked a book (part of the Philokalia, Camus’ The Rebel, Julian of Norwich, The Imitation Of Christ, Wesley’s Hymns, The Rule of the Jerusalem Community, Herbert’s poetry, have all been topics in the past). Sometimes I choose a biblical book, Romans, Revelation, the Gospel of John, the Psalms have all been retreat topics.\n\nThis year has been Isaiah – all 66 chapters. But the length hasn’t seemed to matter using Robert Alter’s beautiful translation, Hebrew Scriptures (an essential translation). On retreat I have read multiple chapters in place of the lectionary readings at each Office and used in-between time for study.\n\nI also generally have a fiction book on the go for reading just before sleep. Oh, and the ever present in my life: poetry.\n\n“It is quite cogent how psalms in choir, how prophecy and gospel, how all great poetry, nurtures prayer; equally cogent are prayer and poetry. They can do without one another, and often do, but not as well. Like kissing cousins, you have to keep them apart sometimes or they will get to scrapping, get in each other’s way, get to too much kissing.”\n\nPaul Quenon (In Praise of the Useless Life)\n\nThat is, I realise, quite a lot of words. I try and make sure that my retreat reading is not new, first-time, reading, but going deeper with stuff I have read previously. I didn’t quite manage that this year with some of the commentary on Isaiah but, of course, Isaiah is not new to me!\n\nPlease don’t read anything here (apart from one or two comments, notably on alcohol) as my saying this is how you should do your retreat. It’s how I do it, some of the ideas might work for you some not.\n\nFinally, I end with a section of photographs of the books I have used on Isaiah for those who are interested.\n\nWhere?\n\nThere are various ‘retreat houses’, generally these are best for led retreats where there will be talks each day and a set fee. I have enjoyed leading this style of retreat very much but I prefer a bit more solitude when I am on retreat.\n\n– Monasteries\n\nMost of my retreats have been made at monasteries of one sort or another. Most have guest houses. It is good to have worship going on to join in with. Some guest houses are pretty sociable places so that they may not suit everyone.\n\n– Walsingham\n\nI have made my retreat at the Shrine of Walsingham four times. Always off season in November. It actually works quite well. Meals will involve talking in the refectory and some other chatting around the place, the Bull has to be resisted but the accommodation is good, there are plenty of walks nearby and a pattern of worship to join in with.\n\n– Cottages\n\nBorrowing, or if you have the money, renting a cottage somewhere is another option. I quite like self-catering, a balance to the reading, and being in the middle of nowhere. I’ve done this a few times as well and it has worked.\n\n– Monastery of the Holy Trinity at Crawley Down\n\nThis is where I have made most retreats although with a. gap of a few years at one stage. There is a guest wing with shared bathrooms that works well although the walls are paper thin so chanting or praying out loud wouldn’t go down well. The community’s worship has Orthodox influences and is very prayerful, there are very many walks in the neighbourhood. They also have hermitages in the woods which are perfect in every way. As described below.\n\nAs I write I am staying in one of the three hermitages at the Monastery of the Holy Trinity, Crawley Down in West Sussex. I have been visiting the monastery since I was eighteen. Usually staying in the guest wing but occasionally in one of these hermitages in the woods. They are self-contained with a little kitchen, shower room and one room with a bed for everything else. They overlook the largest of the ponds in these woods, created for the iron smelting works that was here in the sixteenth century. Now the only disturbances in the woods are the dog walkers from the nearby housing estates.\n\nFood is provided for residents of the hermitages in Red Riding Hood style baskets just before lunch each day. A hot lunch and enough food for an evening meal and breakfast.\n\nI am self-catering, mainly because I am trying to sort out some food allergies that have been bothering me for the last few weeks. But it has the advantage of allowing fasting without fuss.\n\nThe monastic community, the Community of the Servants of the Will of God, pray Vigils, Lauds, Eucharist, Sext, Vespers each day and shared Jesus Prayer several evenings a week. Sometimes I join them for some or all of that. This time I am doing my own thing liturgically.\n\n– Home\n\nSome people make retreats at home. Sometimes there is no choice. I don’t think it is as ideal as being away from home but there could be ways of turning off the phone and internet and making space.\n\nWhen / how long?\n\nThe pressure to cut away a retreat time is enormous. I really think six or more days are needed. But just before I came away I was persuaded to do Sunday cover on what had been due to be the last day of my retreat. It is hard. Even more so for those with families and children. Obviously any time, even a few hours or one day is better than nothing, but generally I think the longer the better. There is a rhythm to a week or more that doesn’t seem to work for shorter periods. That rhythm includes a squirming point when I wonder why I am wasting my time and just want to go home.\n\nBooks?\n\nSome writers on retreats suggest that only the Bible, or a single devotional book should be allowed. Catherine de Hueck Doherty, author of the brilliant Poustinia, is a great advocate of this approach. But I am a disciple of Thomas Merton. Reading his journals it is hard to imagine him without a pile of books. Perhaps this love of books stems from the Benedictine influence on my teenage years.\n\nA little like my changing ideas about education I think the more content-rich retreats have borne more fruit than the more ‘sit and do nothing’ retreats. Anyway, even with a lot of reading there is still plenty of time for sitting and being still (see notes on times below).\n\nI am, however, increasingly cautious about all the reading so many of us do in the great mystics as if we are going to achieve such heights or depths. Better that we spend as much time digesting the words of Scripture and leave spiritual experiences for God to decide. Pursuing such experiences is certainly very much against the tradition. Even contemplative prayer is a gift from God, a grace, for Christians. Not a technique to be developed. The New Testament is full of the wonderful gifts of the Spirit that we can expect to receive in prayer and as a normal part of our Christian lives. The ‘dark night of the soul’, is not something we should seek and is very different to the ordinary sadnesses, depressions and low moods of everybody’s life.\n\nFasting\n\nIt won’t always be possible to fast on retreat, probably only if you are self-catering. I have written about the importance of fasting before. For the Bible fasting and prayer are almost inseparable. If you can fast for part of the time on retreat it really is worth trying. This year (see below) I did two one day total fasts. I think it really changes and intensifies the experience of prayer and creates a certain spaciousness, as well as time. It adds to the sense of seriousness and that this is not a holiday.\n\n“August 14, 1967. Vigil of the Assumption Said Mass quietly at the hermitage and fasted in the morning. (In the evening made too much rice and creole and am weighted down with it.”\n\nThomas Merton\n\n“Fasting clears the head and lessens the angustia, also brings order into one’s life.”\n\nThomas Merton\n\nSleep\n\nSleep deprivation is never a good idea. I need seven hours sleep a night, with, ideally one lie-in (9-10 hours) a week. I normally get this on a Saturday, so leave Morning Prayer, often even til after breakfast. On Saturdays I only pray one day-time Hour.\n\nI usually get up at 5am so need to be in bed by 9:30 for sleep at 10 to get my full quota. On retreat this week I am getting up at 3:30 and aiming to get to bed at 8.\n\nThe reason I am doing that is the quality of time in the early hours and my energy in it. If I stayed up later in the evening instead it would be an extended preparation for sleep, my energy would be low. In the morning my energy is higher, there is a feeling of a whole day beginning, of movement into light that makes the prayer and quiet powerful. I was so excited for that on the first morning this week like a child on Christmas Day I was awake by 2:20.\n\nWhile I am here I am also getting a nap in the afternoon, just 30 minutes or so gives me extra sleep.\n\n“February 7, 1966. F[east] of St. Romuald I don’t know what happens to time in the hermitage. Three and four hours in the pre-dawn go by like half an hour. Reading, meditation, a few notes, some coffee and toast–there is not much to show for it, but it is probably the most fruitful part of the day.”\n\nThomas Merton\n\nAlcohol\n\nThere is a scene in the TV series Rev where the hero goes on retreat. I don’t remember the details, but there is a priest-friend with him and I think they both open their cases to reveal the bottle of gin or whiskey they have with them. For many of us what makes this funny is its truth. In the guest wing of the very monastery I am writing in I have drunk the pre-mixed gin and tonics another priest guest had brought with him.\n\nI find that even two glasses of alcohol interfere with my prayer – I can tell the difference and, as Herbert says and I have so often ignored, “take not the third glass.”\n\nIf we can’t do without alcohol on retreat we have to ask ourselves some serious questions.\n\nE-communications\n\nI take a break from Twitter and Facebook on retreat. But I do phone home daily and check texts and FB Messenger. This week I have heard two pieces of bad news which have been a cause for intercession, I am glad I heard them when I did. The internet has aided my study of Isaiah. It’s a tool. The test for me is to the extent that something enhances my prayer, or lessens the peace of my prayer.\n\nRetreats are not …\n\n– Pilgrimages\n\nRead Chaucer. I don’t think I have always got this right myself. I was looking at the pack for a pilgrimage I led from StAndrew, Earlsfield a few years ago. It is pretty full on liturgically. I wouldn’t put so much into a pilgrimage now. A pilgrimage is a social occasion and there should be plenty of time and space for that.\n\n– Conferences\n\nWhen we started our Sodality we called our annual three-day get together a retreat. We are now calling it our Annual Residential. If there is an intention to socialise, build community, talk, it is probably not really a retreat but a Spiritual Conference.\n\n– Holidays / Time off\n\nI often hear people say they need a retreat because they need rest. Only you can decide how much rest you need. But I would offer a challenge. That rest should be built into our weekly, monthly and yearly patterns separate to retreat time. The weekly sabbath rest is an important biblical principle. Holidays should not be missed. If you are so exhausted that you are desperate for rest probably time off is needed not a retreat. I would draw a subtle difference where there is spiritual exhaustion and renewal of the spirit is needed not total rest. Of course, if you need rest and genuinely the only way you are going to get it is to call it a retreat, then do so.\n\nMeditation\n\nIn the Notebook section below I refer to ‘Meditation’. I don’t especially like this word, or even ‘Mindfulness’ (despite spending much of my life teaching it). They both sound too much like a method, a technique.\n\nIn this time, I just sit. I sit in the lotus or half-lotus position on a zafu (meditation cushion) because it is the most stable posture I know. I can easily sit like this for 45 minutes and on retreat with massaging of my legs for an hour or more. The posture gives it a sort of intentionality, energy; it is not just sitting doing nothing. I like the Japanese term shikantaza “just sitting”, to describe this “methodless method”. As I sit, the breathing naturally deepens but the breath is not the object. Neither is God, as if he is to be sought. He is present. What he chooses to do or not do is his business, not mine. I offer him this time as free gift.\n\n“I am inclined to think that the more a thing is a “practice,” the less it is a prayer. You cannot do without practice, of course, but the better you get at it the more you forget practice and go beyond.”\n\nPaul Quenon\n\nI also sit on the zafu for the Office, but use a prayer stool for the Eucharist and Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, this enables me to prostrate more easily. When using the Jesus Prayer I sometimes stand and bow deeply to touch the floor at each invocation and prostrate with my forehead on the ground every 25 invocations. That helps my energy levels and keeps my body loose when I have been sitting for a long time. I often pray the Rosary while walking.\n\nSo all of this is quite a physical business!\n\nHard Work?\n\nWell, I have probably put you off completely if you are new to this. If this all seems too much like hard work, I suppose yes, I am saying this is hard work. Paul Quenon, monk of Gethsemane in his brilliant book, In Praise of the Useless Life (quoted often here, as also his collections of poetry) comments on his following of the Rule of Saint Benedict:\n\n“I follow—or stumble along—the “Benedictine way,” which approaches life mostly in terms of prayer, work, and reading. To follow all three of these essential principles to the fullest is real work, and indeed at times a hard battle! Key phrases found in the Rule of St. Benedict are “the labor of obedience,” “the strong, bright weapons of obedience,” “the instruments of good works.” It is only when the work of obedience is advanced and matured that we “run the way of God’s commandments in the unspeakable sweetness of God’s love.”\n\nBut he also goes on to talk about the ‘Holy Game’ and the element of play. I often say that liturgy, worship, is a rehearsal for the way God wants the world to be. A retreat is a bit like that too. It is liturgical time. God’s playground for us. Hard work can, of course, be relaxing and rewarding. I have ended this week’s retreat invigorated and energised. Making a good retreat, like doing anything ‘well’ can be deeply satisfying and very far from exhausting\n\nNot Just for Clergy\n\nWhile working with the leaders of the Anglican Religious Communities earlier this year I had an interesting conversation with the Abbot of Mucknell about the many guests they welcome there. 95%, he said, are clergy. And this is a complete reversal to the situation twenty years ago. I checked with other community leaders where there are significant guest facilitates. They all confirmed that the vast majority of guests are now clergy. There may, of course, be many explanations for this. The pressures of work. People being too busy to visit for weekends. But I wonder if those of us who preach and teach do so about retreats often enough?\n\n***\n\nADVENT RETREAT 2019\n\n“In the hermitage, one must pray or go to seed. The pretense of prayer will not suffice. Just sitting will not suffice. It has to be real–yet what can one do? Solitude puts you with your back to the wall (or your face to it!) and this is good. One prays to pray. And the reality of death.”\n\nThomas Merton\n\nPART TWO – RETREAT JOURNAL\n\nDAY 1\n\nIt’s a long drive from the north-west to West Sussex, but the lane to the monastery takes the retreatant through a half mile or so of woodland before arriving. That last stretch is always a powerful letting go. Once I’d arrived and received the warm welcome I got on with unpacking and setting up the hermitage.\n\n3:30 arrive\n\n4:15 Eucharist –\n\nMass said, the Eucharistic presence. It is you, Jesus, it is you present as gently as you can be, like the hand on the shoulder, not imposing. You are the guest as so often you were, invited here by words and signs.\n\nNext to you. I place mum’s picture. She is not here, but she is present. In my breathing that she gave me. As you are, Jesus. breathing in: Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God. Breathing out: have mercy on me a sinner.\n\nMeditation\n\n5:15 Evening Prayer Isaiah 1 -2\n\nFollowed by reading of the commentaries on the reading\n\nLearn to do good,\n\nseek justice.\n\nMake the oppressed happy,\n\nDefend the orphan,\n\nargue the widow’s case.\n\n1:29ff is the opposite of Psalm 1: a garden without water, a tree whose leaves wither.\n\n6:30 Supper – soup and cheese\n\n7:00 Reading (on Isaiah)\n\n7:45 Compline – Isaiah 3-4\n\nFollowed by reading the commentaries\n\nChapter 4 unlike most translators Alter has this as poetry\n\n5And the LORD shall create over all the sanctuary of Mount Zion\n\nand over its solemn assemblies\n\na cloud by day\n\nand an effulgence of flaming fire by night,\n\nfor over all the glory there shall be a canopy.\n\n6And a shelter it shall be\n\nas a shade by day from heat\n\nand a covert and refuge from pelting rain.\n\n8:30 lectio divina on tomorrow’s Gospel Reading and first draft of my ‘todaysgospel’ tweet.\n\n9:15 bed\n\nDAY TWO\n\n3:30 Rise, two cups of tea\n\nJesus Prayer with prostrations 20 minutes or so\n\n“On me a sinner”: words that don’t make me feel shame, but human. Knowing the stupid things I have done. Love never diminished by any of them. There is a stage in friendship when you do or say something stupid, when your friend knows you for a fool, a sinner: and it matters but makes no difference. Or rather it does. It deepens. Then we can be undefended.\n\n4:00. Vigils Isaiah 5 – 6\n\nOpening parts of CWDP Morning Prayer\n\nWith the history psalms (104/105) forming two nocturns\n\n“Here I am, send me.”\n\nNot a happy message:\n\n“Go and say to this people:\n\n‘Indeed you must hear but you will not understand,\n\nindeed you must see but you will not know.’\n\n10 Make the heart of this people obtuse\n\nand block its ears and seal its eyes.\n\nLest it see with its eyes\n\nand with its ears hear\n\nand its heart understand\n\nand it turn back and be healed.”\n\nReading the commentaries.\n\nA walk in the woods (20 minutes or so)\n\nI put my cloak on. Envying Jewish friends their prayer shawls. “He shall cover you with his wings.” (Ps 91:4) I am immersed in dark. Wrapped in light.\n\nSuddenly I remember. thirty six years ago. My friend Danny (long since dead). Staying over, in the morning he passed me his talit to put on. Hugging me as the wool embraced me with its black bands and titzit. I pulled the crown together and kissed it as I had seen him do. Then we prayed. He in his tefillin, me in his talit. Shacharit and Matins simultaneously. Psalms we shared, melodies different. A cacophony for sure. When he died we had lost touch. I didn’t hear about it for months. Yet now I feel as close to him as when he put the talit around me and breathed on my face, his breath rich from the cheap wine we’d stayed up drinking. I wrap my cloak around me and weep. Strange how our little griefs can stand in for all our griefs.\n\nMeditation – 45 minutes\n\nJesus Prayer with Prostrations\n\nBlessed Sacrament Exposed – Adoration 30 minutes or so\n\n7:45 Lauds / Morning Prayer Isaiah Chapters 7-8\n\nReading the commentaries\n\n8:30 Prime\n\n10:00 Terce Isaiah Chapters 9-10\n\nEucharist\n\n12:00 Sext Isaiah Chapters 11-12\n\nReading the commentaries\n\nRosary – walking up and down outside in my cloak.\n\n“The presence of Our Lady is important to me. Elusive but I think a reality in this hermitage. Here, though I do not agree with the medieval idea of Mediatrix apud Mediatorem [the Mediatrix with the Mediator] (without prejudice to her motherhood which is a much better statement and truth). Her influence is a demand of love, and no amount of talking will explain it. I need her and she is there. I should perhaps think of it more explicitly more often.”\n\nThomas Merton\n\nMeditation – 30 minutes\n\nLunch – main meal of the day\n\nSnooze – walk\n\n2:30 None Isaiah 13-14\n\n4:00 Adoration\n\n5:00 Evening Prayer Isaiah Chapters 15-17\n\nMeditation\n\nSupper – soup and cheese\n\n7:00 Compline Isaiah Chapters 18-21\n\nlectio on the following day’s gospel\n\n8:30 bed\n\nDAY TWO\n\nPart way through Vigils, about 4:30, a cock starts crowing on the farm next door. It continues for about 15 minutes.\n\nThe rain is falling hard. Rain in the woods always seem louder, deeper than anywhere else.\n\nMerton’s festival of rain:\n\n“What a thing it is to sit absolutely alone, in the forest, at night, cherished by this wonderful, unintelligible, perfectly innocent speech, the most comforting speech in the world, the talk that rain makes by itself all over the ridges, and the talk of the watercourses everywhere in the hollows! Nobody started it, nobody is going to stop it. It will talk as long as it wants, this rain. As long as it talks I am going to listen.”\n\nThomas Merton\n\nThe hermitage is cosy and very warm from the night storage heaters.\n\nI open the large glass doors. It’s not that cold but it feels a shock.\n\nI put my cassock and cloak on, the warmest clothes I have. Take the umbrella provided and walk in the woods. Enjoying the rain.\n\nIt is pitch black but I walk slowly on paths I know pretty well, barely needing to use the torch. I get to the little weir at the end of the pond. Although it is not a large fall of water it makes a suitably crashing noise in the dark and quiet – the thunder of waters.\n\nISAIAH\n\nTwo pieces of advice are really helping me read Isaiah. The first is in Leslie Hoppe’s New Collegeville Bible Commentary volume on Isaiah. Like scholarship on the Psalms, the academic world has moved on from the granular source-critical stance. It is easy to get hung up on which sections are first, second or third Isaiah. Hoppe takes the canonical, final form seriously and identifies five sections of relatively similar length. She doesn’t mention it but, of course the psalms are also in five books, Matthew’s Gospel is sometimes seen as being in a pattern of five. Do all these reflect the final form of the Five Books of Moses, the Torah?\n\nEach of Hoppe’s five sections relate to Jerusalem, making that the dominant motif.\n\n1\n\nChapters 1 -12 Jerusalem’s Future\n\n2\n\nChapters 13 – 27 Jerusalem and the Nations\n\n3\n\nChapters 28 – 39\n\nJudgement and Salvation for Jerusalem\n\n4\n\nChapters 40 – 55 Jerusalem’s Liberation\n\n5\n\nChapters 56 – 66 The New Jerusalem\n\nEach section begins with an oracle of judgement and ends with a word of salvation.\n\nAlthough the salvific endings are balanced by the final verse of the book which is dark indeed. Alter points out that when this section is read as the Haggadah (the second reading following the Torah) in the synagogue, verse 23 with it message of hope is repeated after verse 24 to end on a positive note.\n\nHoppe also identifies the two main motifs of the book as firstly, the typically Isaianic phrase for God “the Holy One of Israel”, what is so very clear is that this holiness consists not just or only in the being of God but in the justice he requires of his people. It is all too easy to think of social justice as something we read into Scripture. In fact justice is woven deeply into it.\n\nThe second motif is that of Jerusalem/Zion.\n\nHoppe recommends reading the text straight through without commentary.\n\nThis is a recommendation also made by Nicholas King in his Bible (which is a translation of the Septuagint). King makes ten recommendations which I won’t repeat in full here. However some key phrases:\n\nConcentrate on the beauty of the prophet’s language\n\nThe entire scroll belongs together and should be read as a whole\n\nIn the text consolation only comes in the Exile, when Israel is recalling in a mess\n\nDon’t sit on the fence or remain uninvolved\n\nAllow your unhealthy images of God to be systematically demolished\n\nMotyer in his The Prophecy of Isaiah, also divides the book other than by source critical means. His reading of Isaiah is profoundly Christological, he sees three themes:\n\n1 The Book of the King Chapters 1-37\n\n2 The Book of the Servant Chapters 38-55\n\n3 The Book of the Anointed Conqueror Chapters 56 – 66\n\nAlthough this christological reading is helpful it does feel imposed on the book contrasting with the way in which Hoppe’s analysis emerges from the actual text.\n\nHoppe on Chapters 3 and 4: the wealthy are to blame for Israel’s fate. Strong portrait of the bejewelled rich.\n\nSERAPHIM: are serpents, angelic tradition is post-biblical\n\nAt Vigils chapters 5 and 6. Six is the first real revelation to the prophet and includes the burning al image. I am so used to that image, and to thinking of it metaphorically that I think of it as painless.\n\nAlter does this brilliantly, I like his “Woe to me, for I am undone” so much stronger than NRSV “I am lost”. Alter also refers to Alexander Pushkin’s poem “The Prophet” based on this chapter. It is stunning, here it is.\n\nThe Prophet\n\nBy Alexander Pushkin\n\nTranslated by A.Z. Foreman\n\nMy spirit was athirst for grace.\n\nI wandered in a darkling land\n\nAnd at a crossing of the ways\n\nBeheld a six-wing’d Seraph stand.\n\nWith fingers light as dream at night\n\nHe brushed my eyes and they grew bright\n\nOpening unto prophecies\n\nWild as a startled eagle’s eyes.\n\nHe touched my ears, and noise and sound\n\nPoured into me from all around:\n\nI heard the shudders of the sky,\n\nThe sweep of angel hosts on high,\n\nThe creep of beasts below in the seas,\n\nThe seep of sap in valley trees.\n\nAnd leaning to my lips he wrung\n\nThereout my sinful slithered tongue\n\nOf guile and idle caviling;\n\nAnd with his bloody fingertips\n\nHe set between my wasting lips\n\nA Serpent’s wise and forkèd sting.\n\nAnd with his sword he cleft my chest\n\nAnd ripped my quaking heart out whole,\n\nAnd in my sundered breast he cast\n\nA blazing shard of living coal.\n\nThere in the desert I lay dead\n\nUntil the voice from heaven said:\n\n“Arise O Prophet! Work My will,\n\nThou that hast now perceived and heard.\n\nOn land and sea thy charge fulfill\n\nAnd burn Man’s heart with this My Word.”\n\nSource\n\n7am I return from my walk. My cloak is soaking wet. I am breathless. Partly the fear: is there a mad axe-man in the woods? Standing on the bridge over the weir is breath-taking too. There are lights on in the next door hermitage and in the monastery in the distance. I am grateful for these companions in prayer. The monks too have prayed Vigils and are now back in their cells before Lauds.\n\nI am grateful that I found this place when I was eighteen, for the times I have spent here. For the lives lived here. Later I will go to the monastery cemetery and pray for the dead. Gruff but loving Brother Mark, provider of tea and digestives. Charles the friend of the community who spent many years living and praying here. Fr Brian, the sweetest and warmest of smiles but brightly intelligent. My memories of him are mainly from his days at the monastery at Hove. And Fr Gregory, so long Superior. About him complicated memories and feelings. On all the things that divide our church he and I disagreed. But he in many ways created the life here and all the gospel that it holds. As Isaiah knew it is a messy world. As today’s gospel (Matthew’s genealogy) makes clear:\n\nTamar\n\nRahab\n\nRuth\n\nWife of Uriah\n\nJeconiah and his brothers\n\nAfter the walk I still need exercise, that helps with the sugar-hunger too. So 20 minutes of prostrations with Jesus Prayer works up a sweat.\n\n8:45\n\nLight comes late on this dull December day. The dawn chorus just penetrates the sound of the rain. But as the trees emerge I am singing the Canticle from Baruch at Morning Prayer:\n\n“The woods and every fragrant tree\n\nHave shaded them at God’s command.”\n\nInteresting essay by Torsten Uhlig in Interpreting Isaiah ed David G Firth et al\n\nOn the motif of ‘hardening’ of the heart in Is 6 (and elsewhere).\n\nBrueggemann on Isaiah Chapters 7 and 8:\n\nTwo possible readings: historical or christological (virgin birth etc) but he offers a third;\n\nThe offer of faith\n\n“Faith is to resist circumstances and to continue ‘a more excellent way’ a way with no guarantees beyond promises and the One who makes those promises.”\n\n“The non-negotiable verdict of the prophet still lingers: No faith … no future.”\n\nHoppe;\n\n8: 7b-9\n\nWordplay\n\n‘If you do not make yourself firm [in the Lord]\n\nYou will not be affirmed.’\n\nSame Hebrew root as ‘mn from which we derive Amen\n\nIsaiah 65:6 literally translated is that the Lord is “the God of Amen” [Alter makes the same point, notes]\n\nRevelation 3:14: Jesus is “the Amen”\n\nImmanu el\n\n7:14, 8:8 and 10\n\nEven here in the hermitage news comes in.

Tonight is still and dark. Not even the sound of rain. Just animals moving, the occasional bird.\n\nThese chapters from Isaiah this morning and yesterday afternoon have been especially challenging to understand.\n\nBriggs is very comforting on this:\n\n“First, you cannot study everything. Much of chapters 13–33 is obscure. I rather like Walter Brueggemann’s comment regarding chapter 21, that it is ‘extraordinarily enigmatic and elusive and, given our present understandings, almost completely beyond comprehension. I take comfort in the surmise that likely the only people who attend to this poem are those, like myself, who attempt to write a commentary that does not permit skipping over the material.’ So we take comfort in that too, and skip over large sections.”\n\nKey chapters demanding study:\n\n6, 7 (especially 7.14), 9, 40, 53, 61,\n\nAnd would require inclusion in a bible study, sermon series\n\nIsaiah 7\n\n“The Lord commissions Isaiah in v 3, and gives him an oracle to take to King Ahaz in vv 7–9. This includes the striking word-play, which translates rather nicely into English: ‘If you do not stand firm in faith, you shall not stand at all’ (v9:‘imlo’ta’aminu/kilo’te’amenu) or, as NT Wright has suggested rather more idiomatically, ‘Trust or bust.’ In fact, when this Hebrew text was translated into Greek (in the Septuagint version as used by the early church), this line became, ‘If you do not believe, neither shall you understand.’ As such, it was often cited by Augustine in his famous description of Christian faith as the pursuit of the mysteries of God, captured in the Latin phrase, fides quaerens intellectum (faith seeking understanding).”\n\nBriggs\n\nRead 2 Kings 16.5–20, on Ahaz’s reaction to Isaiah (he tries to make a deal with the Assyrians)\n\nSee Is 36-37 for where the historical events come to a head\n\nSee also 2 Chronicles 32 and 2 Kings 19\n\nBriggs: chapter 6 does not function (whatever some commentaries suggest) as the opening call, chapters 1-4 prepare the way for it:\n\nFirst, 5.7b carries a careful word-play, literally: He expected justice (mishpat) but behold: bloodshed (mispach) Righteousness (tsedaqah) but behold: a cry! (tse’aqah)\n\nIn ch 5 the NRSV ‘ah’ is inadequate ‘woe’ is better\n\n6:11 ‘Till, when, O Master?’ How long, O Lord.\n\nIs highly significant.\n\n[isn’t this what we all say in the midst of uncertainty / suffering]\n\nAnd the answer is “until …:\n\nAnd the gloom only rises in chapter 40\n\nBriggs thinks of the putative three authors as three movements in a symphony\n\n40 marks a shift to the servant, answering who will answer God’s call (ch 6) but mostly this is plural (except see 53)\n\n55 – 66 ‘Unspectacular postscript’\n\n61 a return to the anointed servant\n\nBriggs: “It has always struck me as a relatively neglected aspect of the book of Isaiah that it wants to offer us such a broad range of visions of the life of faith among the people of God. The difficult bit today is holding on to the whole range and, even more, it is rightly discerning where in this vast narrative we find our own situations illuminated”\n\nBriggs:\n\n“It is, I suspect, easier to be visionary when you are heading somewhere or about to engage in some dramatic new project than it is when you are back home, working with the long-term issues of faithful living in the same old place. But it is dangerous to lift the Second Isaiah emphasis on vision and newness and transpose it to today without recognizing that a lot of our Christian living is about faithfulness in the place where God has put us, and that this kind of long-term and comparatively unspectacular faithfulness is just as important for many people much of the time.“\n\nCorporate nature of the text:\n\n“When preaching on ‘the armour of the Lord’ from Isaiah 59.15b–20, for example, I was struck by the way in which God’s armour is appropriated for the church as a whole community in Ephesians 6 rather than each individual wearing the full armour of God: it is as a whole church that we are corporately engaged in the mission of God as it is pictured in the book of Isaiah.”\n\nIn Firth et al Lyndsay Wilson on Wisdom in Isaiah: Proverbs 25:1 locates the collection of wisdom sayings in the time of Isaiah, some scholars even think Isaiah may have been among the wisdom school before entering the prophetic school; Isaiah certainly seems to inc some wisdom language, and a wisdom approach to Torah.\n\nVigils reading: 24-27 the apocalyptic\n\nStrong movement 24 25\n\n24 full of desolation yet even in the middle of the destruction some praise:\n\n“It is they who shall raise their voice, sing gladly,\n\nIn God’s grandeur they shall shout from the sea”\n\nAnd then trust emerges in ch 25:\n\nGod’s steadfast faithfulness\n\nThe Lord shall prepare a banquet\n\nHe swallows up the mantle (shroud)\n\nHe wipes away tears\n\nLook! This is our God!\n\nIn whom we hoped and he has rescued us\n\nMore Trust in ch 26:\n\n“a steadfast nature You guard in peace”\n\nJenni Williams (‘The Kingdom of our God’)\n\n“Essentially, this is what trust looks like: it is not so much a state of mind as a choice about how to act.”\n\nBrueggemann has it as:\n\n(26:12) Those of steadfast mind you keep in peace:\n\nIn peace because they trust in you.\n\nJenni Williams draws attention to 26:12\n\n“O Lord, grant peace to us,\n\nFor our every act you have wrought for us.”\n\nHow does God do our acts?\n\nIs it all working out as God intended? Despite our need for repentance?\n\nKeep coming back to this idea of God’s wrath (so strong in much of Isaiah) what might God be angry with me for/about?\n\nAnger is what we feel for those we love and care about; it is easiest to show those we are close to. God being angry does not diminish his love for us!\n\nLauds Isaiah 28 – 30\n\nThe first antiphon for today:\n\nMy soul has yearned for you in the night,\n\nAnd as the morning breaks, I watch for your coming.\n\nAs the night vigil moves to daylight.\n\nThe first psalm 88 with all its darkness\n\n“in a palace of darkness in the mighty deeps\n\nWill your wonders be known in the darkness\n\nBut as for me, Lord, I cry to you;\n\nEven in the dawn my prayer comes early before you.\n\nMy best companion is now the darkness.”\n\nEaton\n\nI love that last line. “My best companion is darkness”. Grail has it as “my only companion”. Sadly CWDP has an alternate reading: “hid my companions out of my sight.” Which seems to be from Coverdale.\n\nS29:11-12 “Pray, read this.”\n\nAmbrose recommended Augustine read Isaiah first when he was close to coming to faith; is this the origin/inspiration for tolle, lege must look up the Vulgate.\n\n[Just done so, lege, but not tolle]\n\n30:15\n\nIn quietness and stillness you shall be rescued,\n\nIn calm and trust shall your valour be,\n\nBut you did not want it.\n\nThe final phrase is often omitted when quoting this!\n\n***\n\nA brighter day. Jesus P and prostrations outside as the sun breaks through the trees.\n\nEarly yet but hunger not too bad. The sugar high of the weekend was over after two days normal diet.\n\nThe perfect thing about praying outside is the sound of the water from the air. Pretty small scale really but definitely a torrent in sound.\n\n***\n\nOn Is 28 Williams points out the wisdom language: pay attention, hear, instructed, teachers, counsel, wisdom: final words His Wisdom is great.\n\n8:30 Prime\n\n10am Terce Isaiah 31-32\n\nLong walk in the sunshine.\n\nOver the bridge across the weir the first house is interesting. Now a significant mansion with extensive grounds (it sold recently for £3m), it was once two labourers cottages.\n\nThe woodland is called Furnace Wood and the house just Furnace. In the mid sixteenth century for about 75 years the area was the site of an iron foundry and blast furnace; latter in the eighteenth century bronze smelting was added for a short time. The woodland provided the fuel and there is evidence of coppiced chestnut still in some of the gardens of the houses that now occupy part of the site. The pond is man-made for the furnace and at some later date there may have been a water mill. The dam decayed and the pond drained towards the end of the nineteenth century. In the early twentieth century the dam was re-built after the land had been sold with the invitation to create a trout pond, and indeed it is now used by a local fishing club.\n\nOn the side of the house a small plaque has appeared since I last walked this way. It commemorates Alfred Towes who died in the First World War and had previously lived in the house.\n\nWith very little googling it is easy to discover a little more about him. Born in about 1880 he was one of probably 10 children. His family lived in the house for just a few years before moving on. At some point he and his wife, Alice, moved to New South Wales, where address is available, when he signed up in 1917 he was listed as a gardener. Travelling back to Europe he lasted only a week at the front before being killed. At some point, by 1921 his wife (and children?) moved back to England to a house that still stands, the Laurels at Copthorne, just a couple of miles from the house where Alfred had lived.\n\nI check the phone directories and there are still Towes’s listed, perhaps his direct descendants or those of his brothers.\n\nOf such dreams and tragedies are our human lives made.\n\nThe town of Mosman where Alive and Alfred lives is close to Sydney harbour. The plot they lived at looks very beautiful, even if it didn’t then have the swimming pool it has now. Was it a dream come true to them? In contrast to the nightmare of war he returned to Europe for? When Alice moves back to England did it seem like she had left her dream?\n\nReading Isaiah this week and getting my head around the shifts of Empires 2700 years ago I note that not much has changed. Those armies sweeping the Middle East in Isaiah’s time were made up of Alfreds with their dreams and tragedies too.\n\nIt doesn’t make me sad. Just glad to have located a human story. And as I walk in the woods, despite the aircraft flying over from Gatwick, they are idyllic, I image the sounds and smells of a blast furnace here half a millennium ago.\n\nRead more local history here.\n\nEucharist\n\nSext Isaiah 33-36\n\nIsaiah 33:17\n\nA king in his beauty your eyes shall behold\n\n…\n\nYour heart shall murmur in awe.\n\nProse passage beginning Isaiah 36 see 2 K 18:13 to 2 K 20:19\n\nSlept for 40 minutes: I wondered whether I would be able to make on an empty stomach; but no problem!\n\nNone Isaiah 37 – 40\n\n38:10ff is one of the Canticles in the Roman Office (Tuesday II) and is rather fine “I said in the noon time of my days …” but it doesn’t appear in CWDP\n\nch 40 Comfort, comfort marks the beginning of what many call second or Deutero Isaiah\n\nHoppe makes an important point that Isaiah is using two images for Jerusalem’s future, one male and one female. The servant is male; Jerusalem is female. From here to 66 the “reader hears the story of a woman’s life from her abandonment by her husband and consequent childlessness to their recon isolation and the birth of many children.”\n\nGoing through the Canticles in CWDP and marking up a Bible with the verses used; they are quite chopped about; obviously any imprecation stuff omitted, but also anything particularly related to judgement. It gives a slightly swayed view of Isaiah, and indeed, of God.\n\nThere are 15 Canticles from Isaiah in CWDP, 16 in the Roman Office, 9 of them are similar texts but most not identical. CWDP chops the verses around much more and is much freer in creating Canticles by doing this. Both remove or don’t include texts about God’s wrath or judgement. It is a rather sanitised version of the prophet.\n\nI hadn’t realised that in the Extended Vigil Office in the Roman rite several of the Isaiah canticles are repeats of those found at Morning Prayer.\n\nVespers Isaiah 41 – 42\n\n11 Look, they shall be shamed and disgraced,\n\nall who are incensed against you,\n\nthey shall be as naught and shall perish,\n\nthose who contend with you.\n\n12You shall seek them and shall not find them,\n\nthose who battle with you.\n\nThey shall be as naught and as nothing,\n\nthose who war against you.\n\n13For I am the LORD your God,\n\nholding your right hand,\n\nsaying to you,\n\nDo not fear, I am helping you.\n\nHoppe makes an important point about 42:14\n\nGod in feminine role:\n\nNow, I cry out like a woman in labour,\n\nGasping and panting.\n\nCompline Isaiah 43 – 44\n\nDo not fear, for I have redeemed you.\n\nI have called you by name, you are Mine.\n\n2Should you pass through water, I am with you,\n\nand through rivers—they shall not overwhelm you.\n\nShould you walk through fire, you shall not be singed,\n\nand flames shall not burn you.\n\n3For I am the LORD, your God,\n\nVery tired after not eating at all. It will be hard to get through to tomorrow lunchtime. But it does create a kind of spaciousness/lightness about the prayer.\n\nDAY FOUR\n\n3:30 Rise. A deep sleep but my head is pounding. It is always difficult to drink enough water when fasting.\n\nFinish lectio and tweet todaysgospel. Read Rachel Mann’s Rossetti book for today and tweet sentence from that.\n\nHunger strikes and sudden feeling of despair. Why am I wasting my life like this? Six days away from home, fasting, getting up in the middle of the night, when I get back I have four services on Sunday. On Monday I shall spend the day seeing sorcerers for Spiritual Direction. I could be with the people I love. Relaxing, enjoying the build up to Christmas.\n\nI start Vigils heavily, unwillingly. But immediately the words strike.\n\nIn the darkness (very dark and rain outside) I pray “Reveal among us the light of your presence.”\n\nAnd the psalms (104, 105) the story of creation and salvation speak.\n\nThen the magnificent power of Isaiah, especially in the translation by Alter which reads aloud so well. In fact it makes RSV/NRSV/CWDP seem very flat indeed.\n\nVigils Isaiah 45-49\n\nSo many powerful lines and sections. This second movement of the book (‘second Isaiah’) really does contain the greatest poetry.\n\n45:3\n\nI will set before you treasures of darkness\n\nAnd hidden store,\n\nSo that you may know I am the Lord.\n\nTreasures of darkness is such a beautiful phrase. It will stay with me. Darkness will be the strong memory of this retreat. The long December nights. And they have produced treasures. Just as the darkness of our lives can.\n\n45:15\n\nIndeed, You are a God who hides\n\nGod of Israel, Rescuer.\n\n47:5\n\nSit mute and come into darkness.\n\nAnother powerful line. Sit in silence.\n\n49:15ff\n\n15Does a woman forget her babe,\n\nhave no mercy on the child of her womb?\n\nThough she forget, I will not forget you.\n\n16Why, on My palms I have inscribed you,\n\nHoppe on 49:15: “It is difficult to find a more touching image of God’s love anywhere else in the Bible.”\n\nWow. So by the end of Vigils I feel the exact opposite of the emptiness I felt an hour ago. There is fullness. Perhaps I should give up everything and live as a hermit!\n\nSuch are the whims of our feelings. So taking that advice and after all those words I will take the prophets advice. Silence. Lights out. The Blessed Sacrament with a single candle. Adoration.\n\nSit mute and come into darkness. Invites the Holy One who sets before me the treasures of darkness from his hidden store, the God who hide.\n\nWalk. In the dark and rain in the woods. To the weir. The thunder of mighty waters.\n\nWhile I am out the day arrives. Sheep and geese emerge in the middle of the field next to my hermitage. On the wooden bridge I wallow in the all-consuming sound of water.\n\nWalking in the woods I am also wallowing in the deep mud. Even though it is quite short the bottom 12” of my cloak are mud spattered. Memories of funerals. Once dry it will brush clean.\n\nBack at the hermitage I had thought when I woke up hungry that I would break my fast at breakfast time. But now, praying and walking, I am enjoying the lightness. I will eat at lunchtime. I’ll fast again tomorrow, Friday, but will break my fast first thing on Saturday. Food will make me sleepy and I don’t need that for the drive north on Saturday afternoon.\n\nHome stretch now on Isaiah. I will finish the read aloud at the Offices today, making tomorrow lighter liturgically. And also finish the verse by verse commentaries (Brueggemann, Williams, Hoppe) and begin to think about the bigger picture. The idea of Isaiah as a symphony with movements has really helped me, as has the five-fold division, rather than the somewhat artificial constructions of Deutero – Trito – Isaiah and as one writer put it the obvious need for Quarto- and Quinto- !\n\nStrong themes from Isaiah so far:\n\nTrust\n\nDarkness\n\nHiddenness\n\nSin/judgement – God’s anger\n\nJerusalem\n\nMorning Prayer (later than planned, my walk it turns out was 45 minutes, glad I didn’t have a clock/phone with me).\n\nReading: Isaiah 50 – 52\n\nStrongest verse: 51:17\n\nAwake, awake,\n\nRise up, Jerusalem,\n\nYou who have drunk from the hand of the LORD\n\nThe cup of his wrath\n\nWe are so phobic to the idea of God’s wrath, this must be something we have to reckon with. Isaiah is full of it!\n\nThe Suffering Servant in 51 -53\n\nPrime\n\nTerce Isaiah 53–55\n\n53: the first of the songs of the suffering servant, powerful reminder of how these passages fit into the wider prophecy and record of rescue/salvation. These would make good canticles, a shame they are not used as such anywhere.\n\n53:4-5 (Alter)\n\n3Despised and shunned by people,\n\na man of sorrows and visited by illness.\n\nAnd like one from whom the gaze is averted,\n\ndespised, and we reckoned him naught.\n\n4Indeed, he has borne our illness,\n\nand our sorrows he has carried.\n\nBut we had reckoned him plagued,\n\nGod-stricken and tormented.\n\n5Yet he was wounded for our crimes,\n\ncrushed for our transgressions.\n\nThe chastisement that restored our well-being he bore,\n\nand through his bruising we were healed.\n\nHoppe: about 40 allusions or citations of this text in the NT\n\nSitting in these woods that would have been alive with the sound of a blast furnace a few centuries ago 54:16 is pertinent:\n\nIt is I who created the smith,\n\nWho fans the charcoal fire ….\n\nWalk\n\nUp to All Saints’ Church in Crawley Down, sadly locked but in the churchyard there is a Towes grave. Frederick. Local history sites suggest this is / could be Alfred’s cousin. He died in 1921 but it is a military grave, so perhaps he died of injuries sustained in the war. No sign of a grave for Alfred’s wife. I may look in the church yard at St. John’s Copthorne on the way home. A find a grave search finds nothing for here other, so perhaps she remarried?\n\nSext Isaiah 56 – 58\n\n56:3 following the foreigner and eunuch accepted into Israel, no opposition between Jesus and the Hebrew Scriptures here\n\nFasting: is not this the fast I choose\n\nGood corrective balance on a day I am indeed fasting:\n\nDo I give my bread to the hungry?\n\nClothe the makes?\n\nLunch: Avocado, tuna, cream cheese, boiled egg; chilli con carne and peas – cheese and fig jam – Brazil nuts, coconut and dark chocolate\n\nand the immediate effect of lunch after 42 hours total fast: Sleep.\n\n3pm None Isaiah 59 – 61\n\n60\n\nPartly CW Canticle 34\n\nAlter: “Rise, O Shine for your light has come. Often thought of with the next two chapters, as the core of Truro Isaiah, this poem picks up the motif of transcendent light from Second Isaiah and transforms it into an enthralling poetic vision of Zion magnificently restored. This vision is dramatically developed in the next two verses, in which the whole earth is imagined engulfed in darkness, and Zion’s brilliant dawn offers light for humankind.”\n\n1Rise, O shine, for your light has come,\n\nand the glory of the LORD\n\nhas dawned over you.\n\n2For, look, darkness covers the earth,\n\nand thick mist, the peoples,\n\n3but nations shall walk by your light,\n\nand kings by your dawning radiance.\n\n60:15\n\n19No more shall the sun be your light by day,\n\nnor the moon’s radiance shine for you,\n\nbut the LORD shall be your everlasting light\n\nand your God become your splendour.\n\n20No more shall your sun set,\n\nyour moon shall not go down.\n\nBut the LORD shall be your everlasting light,\n\nand your mourning days shall be done.\n\nSee Rev 22:4-5\n\nAnd night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever. Revelation 22:5\n\n61v2\n\nA day of vengeance for our God\n\nThe start of 61 forms CW Canticle 35\n\nBut This half verse is omitted:\n\nWhich is such a shame:\n\nLord, avenging God\n\nAvenging God appear.\n\nPsalm 93 (Grail)\n\nThe end of ch 61, verse 11, is, unusually used in two CW Canticles nos 35 and 36\n\n61:4\n\nHoppe calls this ‘the priesthood of the poor’\n\nThen listening to Bach. Really listening, not doing anything else. As Chrysogonus Waddell advised me in 1992. He took me to see Merton’s hermitage when I was at Gethsemane and so somehow Bach is always associated with hermit times in my mind. I listen to settings of Isaiah, one I don’t remember listening to before of the Do not be afraid text. Fürchte dich nicht. Very beautiful.\n\nAnd then Goldberg.\n\n4:30 To revive me and getting the energy flowing Jesus Prayer and prostrations, then Adoration\n\nRaining hard outside.\n\n“January 2, 1966. Feast of Holy Name of Jesus It has been raining steadily for almost 36 hours. This morning toward the end of my meditation the rain was pouring down on the roof of the hermitage with great force and the woods resounded with tons of water falling out of the sky.”\n\nThomas Merton\n\n6pm Vespers Is 62 – 64\n\n62: 4b ff\n\nPart of CW Canticle 36, some very unCW language in Alter:\n\nAnd your land shall be bedded\n\nAs a young man beds a virgin,\n\nYour sons shall bed you …\n\nAlter’s note says:\n\n“The One Bedded. Again, the transliteration, Beulah, became an English name. Most translations render it as “espoused,” but that is too formal and too decorous. This passive form of the verb baʿal does indicate a woman who has a husband (the noun baʿal), but it has a sexual connotation: Zion, the woman who has been forsaken, will now enjoy consummation again. The sexual implication of the term is clearly suggested in verse 5: “and a bridegroom’s rejoicing over the bride / shall your God rejoice over you.” 5. your sons shall bed you. This sounds inadvertently like incest (in the next line of poetry, it is rather God’s relationship with Israel that is analogous to the bridegroom’s relationship with the bride), but the intended idea is that the desolate land, personified as a woman, will be plowed and cultivated by its sons, as a young man is intimate with a virgin and makes her fruitful.”\n\n63:1\n\nIn ensanguined garments (Alter): nice play on words\n\n63:2\n\nAlter: “the association between wine and blood is not only because of the colour red but also because a kenning for wine in biblical poetry, inherited from the Ugaritic is ‘blood of the grape’ (see Gen 49:1)”\n\nAnd of course Eucharistic for Christians\n\nSupper: Soup, cheese and Piccalilli, Brazil nuts, coconut and dark chocolate.\n\nShort walk in the dark, wind and rain. Which at least ensures there are no dog walkers about. Pretty much had the woods to myself in this weather.\n\nMeditation\n\n9pm Compline Isaiah 65-66\n\nAnd so Isaiah finished, at least the read aloud through is. And just wonderful it has been, never wearisome. Alter’s poetic sense is perfect, there is a lovely sharpness to his English and a sense of rhythm and metre. The language is spare.\n\nAnd here to end with a koan from 65:1-2\n\nI yielded oracles\n\nwhen they"
