Priory Church and Cathedral, now all Cathedral. Early C12 with

various rebuildings until the early C15, with 1652 alterations

to west end; minor 1764 alterations; 1846 (by Thomas Nelson)

and 1853-57 restorations by Ewan Christian; 1950s restoration

and vestry etc additions.

Oldest parts are of mixed red and

calciferous squared sandstone blocks; the remainder is red

sandstone ashlar, heavily restored, on chamfered plinth, with

stepped buttresses carried up as pinnacles; string courses,

dentilled cornices and solid parapets, battlemented on tower.

Steeply pitched lead roofs, copper on south transept and flat

on tower; coped gables, that at east end with numerous cross

finials.

Early C12 nave originally seven bays, now two bays with a fragment

of the third bay remaining as buttresses, with aisles and north

vestry. South transept also C12 with C13 chantry chapel

(dedicated to St Catherine); north transept is late C14

incorporating part of C12 structure (original transept thought

to have been destroyed when the tower fell in 1380). Tower

rebuilt late C14/early C15.

INTERIOR: 7-bay choir is internally C13 but completed in the

late C14, the east window is probably c1380. Nave has

triforium and clerestory in Norman style with some internal

distortion due to subsidence; the west wall is c.1652 with

1870 windows; some of the other windows in the nave are later

insertions; north door (now internal) was added in 1813-4 and

gives access to the 1956 vestry. Blocked south doorway to

cloisters appears to have been C12. South transept of similar

Norman details, the south door is 1856 (here originally the

dormitory range joined the Cathedral and roof line can be seen

externally); chapel has panelled and traceried wooden screens

of late C15. North transept has 1858 inserted north window to

memory of Dean Tait's children replacing earlier windows of

1764 and c1380; former external window now internal, lit the

crossing when the transept had a flat roof (similar windows

over nave and south transept were removed in 1855-7

restoration). Choir has C13 arches on clustered columns with

elaborately carved capitals representing the 12 seasons. C15

choir stalls with later C15 mural painting on the backs.

Barrel-vaulted ceiling is painted with stars on a blue ground

and coats-of-arms of local gentry (originally to the design of

Owen Jones in 1856 and replacing a similar medieval ceiling

covered by a false ceiling in 1764). East window contains

medieval glass in tracery head, the lower glass having been

removed in 1764, was replaced with the present plain glass in

1862. For fuller details of the interior see Pevsner (1967)

and the Pitkin guide to the Cathedral.
