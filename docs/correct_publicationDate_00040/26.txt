Kim Newman (1959) is an English journalist, film critic and fiction writer. In his books, Newman combines film history, horror fiction, and alternative history. Newman's first published novel, The Night Mayor (1989), was set in an imagined reality based on old black-and-white detective films. Newman's most famous novel is "Anno Dracula", which takes place in 1888, during the murderous spree of Jack the Ripper - but in a different 1888 than the one we know, in which Dracula succeeds in becoming the ruler of England. (The book "Anno Dracula" was published in Serbian by Vulkan publishing house). He is the author of short stories, as well as a Doctor Who novel, Time and Relative, published in 2001. A theme that Newman constantly returns to in his literature is his tendency to reinterpret historical figures and characters from the works of other authors in a different environment. , either in realistic alternate histories or in complete fantasy. Newman can often be seen as a commentator and critic on the Discovery Channel's Sci-Fi Saved My Life. He has won Bram Stoker, International Horror Guild and BSFA awards and was nominated for a World Fantasy Award.

You are a journalist, film critic and fiction writer. Which of these three occupations do you prefer?

- I'm not a real journalist - although I wrote for a British newspaper. I maintained a couple of parallel careers that developed, sometimes overlapping - writing new film reviews for magazines like Empire and Sight & Sound and writing books about film, such as Nightmare Movies (a history of the modern horror film ) and "Video Dungeon" (a collection of reviews of twisted, obscure and strange films); and wrote novels, plays, comics, short stories and so on. There's a sense that my critical work has caught on to my fiction—some of my stories are about movies or drawn from cultural observations. I've probably become a bit post-modern. Some of the parts of my fiction include criticism.

Why did you choose to write fiction?

- I don't know if it was really a choice. I have been writing stories since I was a child. I've done a bit of a see-saw between writing plays and prose (now I write both genres), but writing prose fiction is still the most prevalent and fulfilling form of writing - just the weird fun of making things without any other consideration (like how theater can afford to make a big battle) it's still overwhelming for me. I try to react to the world by thinking in stories... what if... if this continues... imagine that... what about time... look at it another way... all these are and further stepping stones for me.

Like some other writers, you often write books together with other writers. You wrote the first two books Ghastly Beyond Belief: The Science Fiction and Fantasy Book of Quotations, published in 1985, together with Neil Gaiman. Was there any particular reason for that?

- I met Neil in a pub in 1984 and he wanted to make a book of science fiction quotes - which we finally worked on together. It was his idea, but the title was mine (Ghastly Beyond Belief) and the book was largely shaped by our wonderful editor, Faith Brooker. The original idea was a little more serious and scientific, but Faith encouraged us to focus on more silly material... I collected so many quotes that didn't make it into the book that I still tweet them daily. With Neil and Eugene Byrne and a few others, I wrote a lot of funny pieces for British magazines (mainly women's magazines) - which brought in some income until we really managed to make a fortune anywhere else, and it encouraged us to exercise our weird senses humor. Sometimes we repeat those old jokes. Writing is by its nature a solitary pursuit, but I'm quite sociable - I've written fiction in collaboration with Eugene and science fiction writer Paul J. Macaulay, and I worked with various people in the theater and on the radio. I am currently working intensively on a novel - which means being alone for a long time - but also on a TV documentary series - which means sitting for many hours with some friends talking. I enjoy both processes, but I'm glad I can do both.

With your colleague Eugene Byrne, also a fiction writer, you wrote the book "The British Question", which was never published in Great Britain. Why? Is it because of the bizarre view of the history of England, because in that book you deal with many intriguing questions, such as: what would have been the course of the Second World War if the Germans had occupied Britain? That the German invasion had succeeded. That the royal family is in exile, members of the Resistance Movement, too.

- I think the book was written during the publishing crisis - it was planned as the first in a series of six books, and no one was ready to commit. Južin and I still love that material and want to go back to it, even though we were both on other projects. There were a lot of other Nazi novels, and we thought we had a unique angle on that premise—one that would become more unique as the books that began, set in the following decades, were written. We did a lot of serious research and thought about what might have happened in the situation we're describing - my other alternate history books are more surreal - although in the end we had to take over the story and the characters.

The book "The Secret Files of the Diogenes Club" tells about the strange circumstances in which London found itself. He is saved by a mystic, a man from Diogenes' club, from negative forces, curses and maniacs who control the human mind. How did you create that character?

- I was a kid during the 1960s and 1970s and I wanted to write about a hero - Richard Jefferson - who fits into those decades. I actually created it when I was in my early teens and wrote a bunch of (terrible) stories and one (even worse) novel about it... but I enjoyed the opportunity to go back to it and give it a little more life, especially since I had to engage in those wonderful, raunchy psychedelic scenes. Like most of my generation, I was heavily influenced by TV shows like Doctor Who, The Prisoner and The Avengers (not really Marvel comics, although I read American comics in the 60s as well) and things like Hammer Films, Sherlock Holmes and Bond movies (and books). These things continue in my work, I've noticed.

Who is Richard, the mysterious young man who does not remember his childhood? And who is Vanessa his collaborator?

- I have some ideas about who he really is... although I haven't explored them in the stories yet (maybe not, just to keep the mystery)... and I recently discovered who Vanessa really is and worked out how to explain her history, which appears in another series of books I'm writing (The Drearcliff Grange School books).

You also write about vampires. It would be said that you are especially inspired by the stories about the vampire Vlado Cepes, better known as - the vampire Dracula. You deal with it in the book "Anno Dracula". What can you tell us about this book?

- I've always felt that the reason vampires are the most popular of all monsters is that there are so many different ways to present them - across the spectrum from Sesame Street vampires, to Nosferatu - so they went beyond the question of are vampire stories still trendy? As well as asking what kind of vampire stories are trending right now? And in Anno Dracula, instead of sticking to one type of vampire or sticking to one set of rules, I arranged things so that I could have every possible type of vampire - even one of Hugh Wells' bloodthirsty Martians - in the same world. . The original vision of the novel was simply what if Dracula won? Instead of being destroyed by Van Helsing, he overcomes his enemies when he goes to Britain in the 1880s and becomes the de facto ruler of the British Empire, bringing the vampires out into the open and creating great changes in society. This led to the series, in which the history of the 20th century is largely as it is, but with vampires as a significant minority group.

After this book, you also published the book "Johnny Alucard". Both of these books are about vampires. What is the essential difference between the characters and content of these two books?

- "Johnny Alucard" is the fourth novel in the series, the action takes place in America (mostly) during the 1970s and 1980s - the other novels are "The Bloody Red Baron" (the action takes place in the First World War 1918), "Dracula cha cha cha" (in Rome in 1959) and "A Thousand Monsters" (in Japan in 1899). There is also a comic book, Seven Days in Mayhem, set near the time of the first novel. My next novel - which will be written this year - starts a Japanese story, but in 1999. All are different in tone, but certain themes, characters and plots are intertwined.

I know people who are convinced that vampires really exist, because if there were no vampires, there would be no stories about them. To make the miracle even greater, these stories have been created since ancient times all over this planet and are very similar to each other in terms of content. What do you think about that?

- I tend to think of vampires as useful metaphors, but I'm always interested in hearing new theories.Communist America and Imperial Russia

In the book "Return to USSA", you talk about the environment in which, after the revolution of 1917, the USA became a socialist superpower, opposite the second world superpower, imperial Russia. How was this book received in America?

- We called it Return to the USSA, after the return of the Beatles back to the USSR (which was after Chuck Berry's Return to the USA). It happened when Eugene came back and I went to visit him - the Berlin Wall had come down and there was a lot of glory about it, but Britain was still under the iron heel of Margaret Thatcher. We started talking about what the 20th century would be like if Communism was an American thing... and we wrote a series of short stories that became a book. A few Americans were very upset by the whole idea - especially since it was written by English people (even though one of the stories in the book is about Britain) - but most readers at least found it amusing.

Do you really think that a socialist system could succeed in the USA? How would it affect political and economic trends in the world?

- That hasn't happened yet, and what does it mean to Americans when they say that socialism is very different from what the rest of the world does... maybe it's a kind of individualism so ingrained in American culture that even a modest collective opinion that leads to, say , that it is impossible to have a national health service or legislate so that mass murderers use machine guns. In my opinion, it is foreign even in any of my books.
