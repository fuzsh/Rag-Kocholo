        "text": "Good review Ryan - I've not read this collection but I've read a lot about it, and it did strike me as a good exemplar for how to do analogous history parallelism with a decent balance between cleverness and silliness.\n\nThanks!\n\nPart of the reason it works so well is how much of it is tongue in cheek, I always thought of it as a mid to late 90s work but finding out that the first two stories (\"In the Air\" and \"Ten Days That Shook the World\") were both published in Interzone before the Berlin Wall came down was a real surprise for me.\n\nI'm surprised (and annoyed) it's still out of print when Titan's reprinting every non-Games Workshop Newman book\n\nIt is odd, perhaps because it's co-authored with Byrne? I do know they were touting a similar anthology of stories set in a Nazi victory TL, but this never materialised aside from a couple of vignettes published on its Geocities page.\n\nYes, on its Geocities page.\n\nA very good and well-detailed review. Back in the USSA is actually the book that got me into alternate history, so I have a lot of time for it but you're quite right in that it's an example of 'copy-and-paste' AH; more than anything, I've always found it to be a fun read, especially some of the more wider-focused stories like Teddy Bear's Picnic which is understandable given it's the longest of the stories in the anthology. My copy of it is probably my most prized possession, if only because it's one of the first books I bought with a real passion for as a young adult.\n\nThanks! Very similar to myself in most respects there, I've a lovely hardback copy that must have been one of its last print runs.\n\nRe-read this collection a little while ago, and a thought occurs, given the description of Newman's horror work:\n\nThe first Sheriff in the \"Citizen Ed\" story is named Harry S. Truman. At first, that just looks like another famous name (in this case a U.S. President) being dropped into the story, though it felt a little odd having a Missourian as a Wisconsin sheriff. Having become more familiar with Twin Peaks recently, however, and its sheriff of the same name, I can't help but wonder if Newman was making another horror-related reference there, blending it with the larger Chikatilo retelling. The story was published in 1996, and Twin Peaks ended in '91, so it feels possible, but I might also be reading too much into it. Anyone have any thoughts on this?"
