It was the first mash up of literature, history and vampires, and now, in a world in which vampires are everywhere, it’s still the best, and its bite is just as sharp. Compulsory reading, commentary, and mindgame: glorious.’ Neil Gaiman’Politics, horror, and romance are woven together in this brilliantly imagined and realized novel. Newman’s prose is a delight, his attention to detail is spellbinding.’ Time Out Stephen King assumes we hate vampires; Anne Rice makes it safe to love them, because they hate themselves. Kim Newman suspects that most of us live with them Anno Dracula is the definitive account of that post modern species, the self obsessed undead. New York Times Anno Dracula will leave you breathless…\n\none of the most creative novels of the year. Seattle Times Powerful…\n\ncompelling entertainment…\n\na fiendishly clever banquet of dark treats. San Francisco Chronicle’A ripping yarn, an adventure romp of the best blood, and a satisfying read’ Washington Post Book World’The most comprehensive, brilliant, dazzlingly audacious vampire novel to date. ‘Ultimate’ seems an apt description…\n\nAnno Dracula is at once playful, horrific, intelligent, and revelatory.’ Locus ‘A marvelous marriage of political satire, melodramatic intrigue, gothic horror, and alternative history. Not to be missed.’ The Independent ‘Once you start reading this Victorian era thriller, you will not be satiated until you reach the end.’ Ain’t It Cool’Anno Dracula is the smart, hip Year Zero of the vampire genre’s ongoing revolution.’ Paul McAuley’Kim Newman brings Dracula back home in the granddaddy of all vampire adventures. Anno Dracula couldn’t be more fun if Bram Stoker had scripted it for Hammer. It’s a beautifully constructed Gothic epic that knocks almost every other vampire novel out for the count.’ Christopher Fowler ‘The most interesting take on the Dracula story…\n\nto date. Recommending this one to all those that love Dracula and historical fiction!’ RexRobotReviews It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula. Peppered with familiar characters from Victorian history and fiction, the novel follows vampire Genevi ve Dieudonn and Charles Beauregard of the Diogenes Club as they strive to solve the mystery of the Ripper murders. Anno Dracula is a rich and panoramic tale, combining horror, politics, mystery and romance to create a unique and compelling alternate history. Acclaimed novelist Kim Newman explores the darkest depths of a reinvented Victorian London. This brand new edition of the bestselling novel contains unique bonus material, including a new afterword from Kim Newman, annotations, articles and alternate endings to the original novel.\n\nThe Bloody Red Baron\n\nThis sequel to ‘Anno Dracula’ finds Dracula in power in the German court, where his desire for power and domination leads to World War I. Charles Beauregard is still working for Intelligence and hears about the Red Baron flying ace and his ‘circus’ of vampire fighters.\n\nJudgment of Tears / Dracula Cha Cha Cha\n\nA gothic romance set in Rome 1959, in which Bram Stoker’s fictional spawn meet Fellini’s paparazzi and a host of other hybrids who you may or may not recognise…\n\nRome 1959. Along the Via Veneto, the living and the dead enjoy la dolce vita, as the vampires, intellectuals, conspirators, jet setters and swindlers of Europe gather in an endless round of indulgence and gaiety, dancing giddily to the music of the Dracula Cha Cha Cha. The Vampire King, in Italian exile, is to be married to a Moldavian princess, and rumours circulate that his wedding will be the first move in a campaign to return him to his position as Lord of the Undead and a power in the world. In the eternal city, three corpses in the Fontana di Trevi lead three vampire women towards the destinies of their hearts. A flamboyant murderer stalks the elder vampires of the city, perhaps intent on wrecking the Royal Marriage; an undead British secret agent with a license to kill is swept up in a titanic conflict with the supernatural agents of SMERSH; a living American opportunist sees a way of surviving as a parasite upon the dead; and a creature older even than Count Dracula is awakened to decide the fates of lovers and monsters. From the author of ANNO DRACULA and THE BLOODY RED BARON comes this novel of horror and mystery, romance and intrigue.\n\nThe Night Mayor\n\nA funny first novel with elements of science fiction, fantasy and horror, set in a fantasy world fabricated from images of classic American crime movies where it’s always 2. 30am and always raining. Kim Newman has also published several SF stories and a book on horror films ‘Nightmare Movies’.\n\nBad Dreams\n\nAnne Nielson, an American journalist, comes to London to investigate the strange death of her sister. Soon, she becomes sucked into a netherworld of corruption and perversion and is hurtled toward a final confrontation where she has only the dead as allies. From the author of Anno Dracula.

As a vehicle for satire, social commentary, or sheer fantasy adventure, Doctor Who is unparalleled. It was a show created for children, but it was immediately usurped by adults.

A British fantasy adventure that has unfolded across television screens over decades in the tradition of Lewis Carroll, Conan Doyle and HG Wells, the strength of Doctor Who has always been its writers and the ideas they nurtured.
