        "text": "– For Immediate Release –\n\nTICKETS ON SALE FOR KIM NEWMAN’S “LONDON UNDERGROUND: DEATH LINE”\n\nAT THE MISKATONIC INSTITUTE OF HORROR STUDIES – LONDON\n\nwww.www.miskatonicinstitute.com\n\nAfter its packed March session of 70s Sado-Masochistic erotica, the Miskatonic Institute of Horror Studies – London is proud to present acclaimed film critic and fiction writer Kim Newman, author of Nightmare Movies and Cat People, on the political subtext of Gary Sherman’s 1972 unsettling British underground horror tale Death Line on Thursday 9th April. Tickets are now on sale.\n\nLONDON UNDERGROUND: DEATH LINE\n\nThursday 9 April, 7pm-10pm\n\nInstructor: Kim Newman\n\nEvent details: https://miskatonicinstitute.com/events/london-underground-death-line/\n\nTickets: £10 advance / £11 on the door / £8 concs\n\nTICKETS: https://www.wegottickets.com/event/312733\n\nKim Newman will screen and talk about Gary Sherman’s 1972 British horror film, Death Line (aka Raw Meat), one of the first British horror films to compete with the wave of stronger, more politicised American splatter movies that came in the wake of Night of the Living Dead.\n\nA series of disappearances on the London Underground Railway are traced back to the inbred, cannibal descendants of navvies trapped by a cave-in during the building of the tunnels. A human monster (Hugh Armstrong) who looks like a scabrous tramp haunts the Piccadilly Line, picking off and eating the odd commuter, trying to keep alive his diseased wife. Tea‑drinking copper Inspector Calhoun (Donald Pleasence) is called into the case with his sidekick sergeant (Norman Rossington) when the latest victim (James Cossins) turns out to be a high-ranking civil servant fresh from a neon-lit sleaze spree in Soho, and has to cut through bureaucratic red tape (represented by Christopher Lee in a bowler hat). Meanwhile, down in the tunnels, the last of the monsters lives out his pathetic, horrid leftover life, expressing himself through the only words he knows, ‘mind the doors’. It includes a wonderful, apparently improvised drunk scene from Pleasence and a breathtaking 360º pan around the cannibals’ dripping, dank, corpse-strewn underground lair.\n\nLess makeshift than a lot of its rivals from the 1970s, it has solid, witty dialogue, a memorably funky music score and the sort of urban legend premise that people will swear is based on truth rather than new-minted for the movie. American writer-director Gary Sherman also made the cloying New Seekers ‘I’d Like to Buy the World a Coke’ ads, and used his share of the fee from that to finance this gutsy, gritty debut. The discussion will highlight the film’s political subtext, transgressive use of cannibalism as metaphor and for shock value, black humour, performance styles, relationship with American and other British films on similar subjects (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Frightmare) and exploration of London lore and locations. The Horse Hospital is just round the corner from Great Russell Street Station, so attendees who come by tube will pass through the film’s main setting before and after the class.\n\nAbout the instructor:\n\nKim Newman is a novelist, critic and broadcaster. His fiction includes The Night Mayor, Bad Dreams, Jago, the Anno Dracula novels and stories, The Quorum, The Original Dr Shade and Other Stories, Life’s Lottery, Back in the USSA (with Eugene Byrne), The Man From the Diogenes Club, Professor Moriarty: The Hound of the d’Urbervilles and An English Ghost Story under his own name and The Vampire Genevieve and Orgy of the Blood Parasites as Jack Yeovil.
