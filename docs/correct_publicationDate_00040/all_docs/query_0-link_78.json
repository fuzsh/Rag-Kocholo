        "text": "Horror Roundtable 8 – Writing a Series\n\nWhen: May 11, 2013\n\nTime: 12 noon EST (use the Time Zone Converter to find your local time)\n\nWriting a Series\n\nWhat do writers owe their readers when they write books in series? Or do they not owe anything at all? The readers are the people who buy the books and “pay” the writer with eventual [we hope!] royalties. The people and situations in a book and a series are the writer’s creation and for themselves foremost … but if a writer isn’t thinking of potential readers, then why bother sending the book to an agent or publisher? Why try to get it published? And … what does a writer owe her own characters? Did she form them and breathe life into them only to cut things off in a matter of a few books? Of course, we can think of Sherlock Holmes who died but was brought back after Doyle got a lot of Victorian flak.\n\n* * * * *\n\nYou can follow the Roundtable discussion in the comments section of this post.\n\nNote: the page will auto refresh every 5 minutes.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSpecial Guests:\n\nNancy Holder is a founding member and former trustee of HWA. She is a New York Times bestselling author (the dark fantasy series Wicked) who has written over eighty novels, and two hundred short stories, essays, and articles, many of which have appeared in “Best of” anthologies. She has received five Bram Stoker awards, one for Novel (Dead in the Water), Young Adult Novel (The Screaming Season), and three for Short Fiction (“Lady Madonna,” “I Hear the Mermaids Singing,” and “Cafe Endless: Spring Rain”). She received a Scribe award for Saving Grace: Tough Love, based on the Saving Grace TV series. She was given a Pioneer award from Romantic Times for her young adult fiction. She also received a Special Sales Award from amazon.com.\n\nHer other horror work includes the young adult Possessions trilogy from Razorbill, stories in Deep Cuts, V Wars, the mosaic novel Zombie Apocalypse series, and the upcoming young adult horror special from Dark Moon. She has written spooky tales for Nancy Drew and as Chris P. Flesh and Melissa J. Morgan for Grosset and Dunlap. She is well known for her work on such properties as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, MTV Teen Wolf, Saving Grace, Hellboy, Hulk, Highlander, Sherlock Holmes, Kolchak, Zorro, and many others. She will be one of two Author Guests of Honor at the 2014 World Horror Convention. She edits comic books and pulp fiction for Moonstone Books and she is on the faculty of the Stonecoast MFA in Creative Writing Program offered through the University of Southern Maine. Visit her @nancyholder, https://www.facebook.com/nancyholderfans, and www.nancyholder.com.\n\n*\n\nKelley Armstrong has been telling stories since before she could write. Her earliest written efforts were disastrous. If asked for a story about girls and dolls, hers would invariably feature undead girls and evil dolls, much to her teachers’ dismay. All efforts to make her produce “normal” stories failed. Today, she continues to spin tales of ghosts and demons and werewolves, while safely locked away in her basement writing dungeon. She’s the author of the “Otherworld” urban fantasy series, “Darkest Powers” & “Darkness Rising” teen paranormal trilogies as well as the upcoming “Cainsville” modern gothic series and “Blackwell Pages” middle-grade fantasy adventure trilogy (co-written as K.L. Armstrong with M.A. Marr). She lives in southwestern Ontario with her husband, kids and far too many pets. Photo credit: Kathryn Hollinrake\n\n*\n\nF.
