        "text": "I recently noticed that one of my favourite Alternate History books, if not my favourite book, Back in the USSA didn't have a thread on here. So I thought that I should correct this, especially after I saw the fan made script for its trailer in the trailer thread on here.\n\nI know that Back in the USSA isn't a completely authentic Alt. History book, especially since it contains larges amounts of pop culture references and characters, but I'm curious to see what other people have thought of the book.\n\nWas this Kim Newman's book about a Socialist USA?Read it and liked it.I will try and find a copy?There was another book in which the US occupies what is now the former USSR after WW3 and tries to import ITS concepts to Russia.\n\nYes, that's the one. Took me forever to find it; live in the UK and was only printed in US. What was this other book? Sounds like an interesting read\n\nOne of the things that I like to get some help on with it is who the leaders of the USSA, Great Britain and Russia are throughout the book's history.\n\nHere's what I have so far:\n\nUSSA\n\nEugene Debs (1917-1926)\n\nAlphonse Capone (1926-195?)\n\nBarry Goldwater (195?-196?)\n\nRichard Nixon (197?-197?)\n\nUnknown (197?-198?)\n\nUnknown (198?-198?)\n\nUnknown (198?-198?)\n\nKurt Vonnegut (198?-1991)\n\nGreat Britain\n\nWinston Churchill (1940-1955)?\n\nAnthony Eden (1955-1966)?\n\nEnoch Powell (1966-19??)\n\nAlan Clark (19??-19??)\n\nDon't have much on Russia other than Kerensky was the first PM there, Kissinger served as Premier during the Indochina War and Smoktunovsky was assasinated as a mirror of JFK. Anyone think they might be to help with this?\n\nOne of the things that I like to get some help on with it is who the leaders of the USSA, Great Britain and Russia are throughout the book's history.\n\nHere's what I have so far:\n\nUSSA\n\nEugene Debs (1917-1926)\n\nAlphonse Capone (1926-195?)\n\nBarry Goldwater (195?-196?)\n\nRichard Nixon (197?-197?)\n\nUnknown (197?-198?)\n\nUnknown (198?-198?)\n\nUnknown (198?-198?)\n\nKurt Vonnegut (198?-1991)\n\nGreat Britain\n\nWinston Churchill (1940-1955)?\n\nAnthony Eden (1955-1966)?\n\nEnoch Powell (1966-19??)\n\nAlan Clark (19??-19??)\n\nDon't have much on Russia other than Kerensky was the first PM there, Kissinger served as Premier during the Indochina War and Smoktunovsky was assasinated as a mirror of JFK. Anyone think they might be to help with this?\n\nHow in the Hayle does Debs get elected in 1916?\n\nI honestly still don't get the ending, was it nuclear or godzilla?\n\nI think that it's supposed to be a 'Meltdown' created thought as a reference to Godzilla, in response to the fire on the oil-streaked Pacific created by the flare from Los Angeles in-fighting\n\nI read it a while back: entertaining, but definitely wins the Harry Turtledove Award For Cut and Paste History.\n\nBruce\n\nThat is one part of the book that lets it down in terms of accuracy. Although I think the book was written as entertainment more than an accurate and realistic attempt at looking at a Red Revolution in the US. There are moments that go against this direct mirroring of history in relation to its own history, though, albeit to put history back onto a more mirrored version i.e. Communist North Vietnam is made as a result of France going Red and them leaving ideologues there whilst pulling of their colonies to help them out\n\nJust a question if anyone can help; what is the song 'My Socialist Heart' based on? I've looked at Sinatra's song from '53 and couldn't find any that seemed to fit the transposing of the lyrics into their melody, so I think it must be a song by another artist like 'My Way' has become 'God's Way' by Ken Dodd\n\nI read it a while back: entertaining, but definitely wins the Harry Turtledove Award For Cut and Paste History.\n\nBruce\n\nIt's not meant to be a strict counterfactual. It's a satire of the Cold War, and American anti-communism. The USSA's familiar figures transformed into commies ape a lot of Russian events like the purges and the collectivizations, but they dress it up in the exact same kind of rhetoric as they did IOTL as capitalists.\n\nI'd also like to note that I loved the book, and it's part of the genesis of my own TL, and ultimately why I stayed away from the cliche \"USSA\". I wanted to make a history of a revolution that didn't just recapitulate all the tragedies of OTL, and represented something authentically plausible."
