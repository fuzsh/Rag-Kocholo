Ziesing Books.\nThe title is a reference to the song \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" by The Beatles. The stories are linked through their setting, an alternate history of the twentieth century in which the United States experienced a communist Second Revolution in 1917 and became a communist superpower, whereas Russia did not. Six of the stories first appeared in Interzone magazine, and the concluding story in the sequence, \"On the Road\", was written especially for the collection.",
