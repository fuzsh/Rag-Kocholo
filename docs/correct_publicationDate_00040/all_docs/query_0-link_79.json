NOW THE CHARACTER HAS BEEN REVIVED, AND THREATENS TO EXTEND HIS SINISTER VIGILANTE INFLUENCE TO THE REAL WORLD...\n\nIn this startingly original collection, Kim Newman brings together stories of science fiction, fantasy and horror, revisiting the worlds and characters of such novels as The Night Mayor and The Quorum, featuring monsters from pulp fiction, Victorian ghosts, strangely familiar byways of the 20th Century, the evils of colorisation, cruel sports of the future, London nightmares and a private detective who specialises in the unbelievable. Shards from the splintered mind of the critically-acclaimed best-selling author of Anno Dracula, Jago and Bad Dreams, and proof that Kim Newman is one of the most stimulating and inventive young British writers in the business.\n\nWith a foreword by Neil Gaiman\n\nFound this on the back-of-the-van man's stall yesterday along with copies of Greenberg & Co's The Dean R. Koontz Companion (figured i needed it) and Jules Michelet's Satanism And Witchcraft (Tandem 1965). But for the terrific title novella, The Man Who Collected Barker and Week Woman, all the rest are new to me which came as an unexpected bonus.\n\nMrs. Vail: (Brian Stableford, (ed.), The Dedalus Book of Femme Fatales, 1992). Martin Vail believes he has murdered his wife and thrown her weighted corpse into the Serpentine. Vail, it seems, chose the unnamable above other suitors because she is/ was as mute as she is/ was pleasing on the eye, except, once the Wedding ceremony was over, he could hear her voice nagging incessantly in his brain. Yet here is the lovely lady, dispensing tea, scones and beautific smiles to Vial's pompous guest (our narrator). But no, protests her husband: that plate is hovering unaided in mid-air. An item in the newspaper some days later reveals the truth. \"This was written to be read aloud, at Lisa Tuttle's Halloween party.\"\n\nPatricia’s Profession: (Interzone, 1985). Mr. Newman provides an afterword to each of the stories. In this instance he reveals that the original title, Killograms, was rejected as \"too obvious\", which gives you some indication as to Patricia's particular area of expertise. Ian Dearborn, a twenty-one-year old executive is the lucky birthday boy. Everyone, living or ex-living, enjoys the jolly jape.\n\nadrianmarley\n\nNew Face In Hell\n\nPosts: 7\n\nPost by adrianmarley on\n\nNewman is one of my favourite writers and there are a few doozies here in his first collection.\n\nThe title novella alone is well worth the price of admission.\n\nAlso worth read are:\n\nDreamers (which formed the basis of his novel The Night Mayor\n\nMother Hen - a nice riff on The Maltese Falcon featuring Sally Rhodes who appears in several short stories and, if I'm not mistaken, an appearance by Derek Leech, Newman's Rupert Murdoch-like character (who also reappears in several stores and in the novel The Quorum.\n\nPatricia's Profession is great fun and The Man Who Collected Barker is nicely macabre.\n\nAlso worthwhile is The Next But One Man, a nastly little tale about a man who is never first in the queue.\n\nAll in all this is an excellent collection and a great introduction to the diversity of Newman's stories. (Can you tell I'm something of a fan?) Enough gushing for now...\n\ndem bones\n\nJanitor Of Lunacy\n\nHail Horrors, Hail\n\nThirsty Dog\n\nPosts: 17,650\n\nPost by dem bones on\n\nAlso worthwhile is The Next But One Man, a nastly little tale about a man who is never first in the queue.\n\nIt's not exactly subtle, is it?\n\nThe Next-But-One Man: True to form, Trevor, a racist, Leftie-hating, Tory-voting vibrator salesman, pushes in front of a customer at the local branch of the Midland Bank. The man in the white hat doesn't take to such rudeness, and Trevor momentarily fears physical confrontation, but the injured party merely looks him in the eye, quietly informs him \"You've lost your place in the queue.\" From that day, Trevor's life falls to pieces as he's inexplicably overlooked in shops and at work and generally treated as though he were already a ghost. He fast degenerates into a dog-eating tramp until it's almost a mercy when the Grim Reaper pays him a visit ....\n\ndem bones\n\nJanitor Of Lunacy\n\nHail Horrors, Hail\n\nThirsty Dog\n\nPosts: 17,650\n\nPost by dem bones on\n\nFive Derek Leech/ Sally Rhodes related stories from the original The Original Dr. Shade - the title novella, Organ Donors, Mother Hen, The Man Who Collected Barker and Gargantuabots Versus the Nice Mice - are included in the recent Titan reprint of Newman's 1994 novel, along with the scary/ hilarious/ prophetic Going To Series from the Stephen Jones & David A Sutton co-edited Dark Terrors 5.\n\nKim Newman - The Quorum (Titan, 2013; Pocket, 1994)\n\nAmazing15 Images/ Dreamstime\n\nBlurb:\n\nIn the polluted River Thames, a monster is born. Formed of filth and grime, Derek Leech emerges from the murky depths, destined to found a global media empire.\n\nIn 1978, three school friends with high aspirations—Michael, Mark and Mickey—are offered a deal by the mysterious magnate. If they agree, their future wealth will be ensured, but they must offer Leech a sacrifice in return, a conspiracy of lifelong pain against their absent friend, Neil. Accepting the terms, the men prosper over the next fifteen years. But as the era of excess comes to an end, the trio must pay the price for their success, and they soon discover that fame and fortune is a fate worse than death.\n\nA brand-new edition of the critically acclaimed novel, featuring five short stories by the award-winning author.\n\ndem bones\n\nJanitor Of Lunacy\n\nHail Horrors, Hail\n\nThirsty Dog\n\nPosts: 17,650\n\nPost by dem bones on\n\nKim Newman - Famous Monsters (Pocket, 1995)\n\nTrevor Scobie\n\nPaul J.

I read/ revisited three of the stories last night including the 80-plus pages of Sapper gone insane that is Pitbull Brittan, wilder and funnier than I remember it, if not quite as dark."
