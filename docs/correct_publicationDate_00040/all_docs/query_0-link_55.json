        "text": "At the start of 2023 I set myself a target to read 365 short stories, which I’ve now done – and which is why Jonathan asked me to contribute to this ongoing project.\n\nIt’s a big number, 365. But when you do the sums, it’s not really a lot of reading. If we assume the average collection of short stories contains ten pieces, it only equates to about 37 books. The time was easy to find: I just spent less time refreshing Twitter, and more time with a paperback in my hand.\n\nThe biggest challenges were, first, deciding what to read and, secondly, accumulating the necessary books.\n\nAs someone who mostly writes stories of varying degrees of weirdness, I crowdsourced a list of spooky stories on Twitter and Mastodon as a starting point, which nudged me to acquire collections by Shirley Jackson, Patricia Highsmith and Elizabeth Jane Howard.\n\nNext, I went on a spree picking up anthologies of short stories from charity shops, community bookswaps, and bookshops. One of the great bargains was a hardback collection of stories published in The New Yorker between 1950 and 1960, including writers who have gone on to become part of the canon, and others who are quite forgotten.\n\nThis new habit also gave me the shove I needed to subscribe to some magazines, such as the long-running science fiction publication Interzone, and buy zines like Cloister Fox and Lunate. (Disclosure: I’ve had a story in Cloister Fox.)\n\nAs for my relationship with short fiction, it’s been up and down over the years. As a dorky teenager I read a lot of short stories and wrote plenty, too. After university, though, when I started writing seriously, I skipped straight to novels, because that was the prescribed path to publication.\n\nThen, in 2017, I read a snarky blog post by author Owen Booth entitled ‘24 Rules for Writing Short Stories’ which flipped a switch in my head. It simultaneously makes the case for the sheer variety possible in short fiction, and catalogues its cliches.\n\nThe pandemic was another trigger. I finished writing a novel in autumn 2020, somehow, but once that was out of the way, I found myself itching to write short stories again. Perhaps because they better suited my scattered attention as we struggled through successive lockdowns and waves of infection.\n\nI published one story, ‘Modern Buildings in Wessex’, as a chapbook in the style of an architectural guide from 1968 and it went very gently viral, among the sort of people who enjoy both M.R. James and Ian Nairn. It formed the basis of an entire collection, Municipal Gothic, with which I’ve had more success, and apparently excited more readers, than anything in the preceding (wasted?) 20 years.\n\nThe list below is a mix of stories I read for the first time this year, along with some all-time favourites. I’ve tried not to overthink it but could, of course, easily have listed three times as many stories below.\n\n‘Teddy Bears’ Picnic’ by Kim Newman and Eugene Byrne (First published in Interzone, August and September 1997, and then collected in Back in the USSA, 1997)\n\nFilm critic Kim Newman is a prolific author of fiction. His trademark is mashing up characters from the works of others, as well as historical figures, in alternate histories. His novel Anno Dracula, for example, asks what might have happened if Dracula had not been defeated and became king of an imperial Britain ruled by vampires. You might call it clever-clever fan fiction but I often find it dazzling. How many pop culture connections can one brain hold?\n\n‘Teddy Bears Picnic’ is a particularly thrilling example. It has Bob and Terry from The Likely Lads fighting with the British Army in Vietnam, alongside Frank Spencer and Blakey from On the Buses. And in the sky overhead, between cricket games, psychotic special forces officers Jennings and Molesworth blast ‘The Teddy Bears Picnic’ from their helicopters, to terrify the enemy. William ‘Just William’ Brown, meanwhile, has gone mad in the jungle.\n\nYears later, Bob writes a book which Michael Powell wants to adapt into an epic movie to be called It Ain’t Half Hot, Mum…\n\nYou get the idea, there’s a lot going on.\n\n‘Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?’ by Joyce Carol Oates (First published in Epoch, autumn 1966, and frequently anthologised since)\n\nThis isn’t a horror story but is certainly horrific. Arnold Friend is a monstrous fake teenager fashioned from hair lacquer and denim. When he decides to take Connie, a teenage girl, he stalks, seduces and seizes her while her well-to-do parents are out at a barbecue. It distils a huge amount into a few thousand words, making small town America a menacing, sickly place.\n\nI came to it via The Vintage Book of Contemporary American Short Stories (ed. Tobias Wolff, 1994) but knew the story obliquely from Don Moser’s 1966 newspaper article ‘The Pied Piper of Tucson’, about the real-life murderer Charles Schmid, which inspired Oates. Schmid uses to put crushed drinks cans in his shoes as makeshift lifts and similarly Oates has her Arnold Friend standing and walking strangely, as if he’s a simulacrum of a human.\n\nThis year also happened to see the resurfacing of Joyce Chopra’s 1985 excellent film Smooth Talk, the final act of which is a remarkably faithful adaptation of Oates’s story, with Treat Williams as Arnold Friend and Laura Dern as Connie.\n\n‘Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?’ is also a story that makes you look askance at Arthur ‘The Fonz’ Fonzarelli – gritty Happy Days reboot for Netflix, anyone?\n\n‘The Pennine Tower Restaurant’ by Simon K. Unsworth (First published in Lost Places, Ash Tree Press, 2010)\n\nAnother idea I had for this list was to identify 12 stories to form an anthology of ‘municipal gothic’ – that is, weird fiction set in everyday post-war British environments such as council estates and shopping arcades.\n\nUnsworth’s story is just such a modernist horror built around a quirky 1960s building at Forton services on the M6 near Lancaster. A ghost story of an antiquary this is not.\n\nUnsworth, perhaps inspired by Fargo, opens the story with: “This is not fiction.” He insists that everything that follows is perfectly true, and makes the narrator a version of himself for added verisimilitude. The premise is that a 1960s motorway services restaurant can be haunted, or possessed, like a British Amityville.\n\nHe piles up the evidence and the urban legends one after another – missing people, murders, strange noises, unexplained phenomena. And provides footnotes, too, in case you should want to continue the research yourself.\n\nIt’s especially interesting to read as Danny Robins’s podcast and TV show Uncanny takes people’s personal ghost stories into the mainstream. If this was really a true story, he’d be all over it.\n\n‘A Snowy Night on West Forty-Ninth Street’ by Maeve Brennan (First published in The New Yorker, January 1967 and available to subscribers to read here. Collected in New York Stories, ed. Diana Secker Tesdell, Everyman, 2011)\n\nNot a story so much as a snapshot of a moment in time, like the street photography of Saul Leiter given voice. It is snowing and New York City is subdued, as Brennan captures in long, ornate sentences:\n\n“At night, when the big Broadway lights go on, when the lights begin to run around high in the sky and up and down the sides of buildings, when rivers of lights start flowing along the edges of roofs, and wreaths and diadems begin sparkling from dark corners, and the windows of empty downtown offices begin streaming with watery reflections of brilliance, at that time, when Broadway lights up to make a nighttime empire out of the tumbledown, makeshift daytime world, a powdery pink glow rises up and spreads over the whole area, a cloudy pink, an emanation, like a tent made of air and color.”\n\nLonely, the narrator goes to a French café and sits alone observing the regulars and staff playing their roles. Michel the charmer, Betty the secretary, Mrs Dolan the faded beauty, ‘Mees Katie’ the exhausted manager… This is nothing, this is not the New York people will want to remember or preserve, she says, but of course she records it anyway. I’m glad she did.\n\n‘Night Fears’ by L.P. Hartley (First published in Night Fears, 1924. Collected in The Travelling Grave and Other Stories, 1948)\n\nI could have picked several stories from this collection, many of which foreshadow a mood we now think of as ‘Aickmanesque’. Something strange happens, it’s not always clear what, and the protagonists are left changed, and darkened, by their experiences.\n\nThis little vignette is an early bit of ‘municipal gothic’, perhaps, with a working class character at its centre, which was unusual for the time. He’s a nightwatchman on a building site, with a wife and child at home. On a cold night, when he feels especially lonely, he engages a loitering stranger in conversation and invites him to sit with him by the dwindling brazier.\n\nThe stranger asks him a series of snide, undermining questions. Is he certain his wife is faithful? Is the job worth it for the poor money they pay? Couldn’t he do any better? We begin to suspect that the stranger is Death himself, but don’t hope for a tale of redemption after A Christmas Carol:\n\n“The stranger seemed to have said his say, his head drooped a little more; he might even be dropping off to sleep. Apparently he did not feel the cold. But the night-watchman was breathing hard and could scarcely stand…”\n\nRather than death, I wonder if the stranger might not be that self-doubting voice we all hear in the fretful small hours.\n\n‘It's a Good Life’ by Jerome Bixby (First published in Star Science Fiction Stories No.2, 1953. Collected in various anthologies including The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929-1964, ed. Robert Silverberg, 2005)\n\nA small masterpiece and justly famous, mostly as a result of being adapted for an episode of The Twilight Zone in 1961. It does something I really love in a short story: drops us in at the deep end and makes us race to catch up. We know we’re in a small town in America and that everything is just fine, just wonderful… by why is the word ‘sun’ in quotes in the second line?\n\nLittle Anthony is a toddler and a powerful, petulant monster who can make things happen with his mind. Even when he means to help, it rarely goes well. We slowly realise that he is the apocalypse that has befallen this town, with its dwindling supplies and rusting cars.\n\nSo, his family and neighbours, stranded somewhere in space, have learned never to express a wish, or even to think about anything being different or better. Because Anthony will respond and the chances are someone will die, or the world will end up a little more broken.\n\nIt’s also clearly a product of nuclear paranoia – what might life be like in the rural Midwest after the cities have been destroyed? Would survival be desirable, or hell on earth? It also probably, I think, suggested the plot of the Japanese science fiction manga series and anime feature Akira.\n\n‘Love of Life’ by Jack London (First published in McClure’s Magazine, December 1905. Collected in Love of Life and Other Stories, 1906, available online via Project Gutenberg)\n\nReading 365 short stories was a great opportunity to dip into authors I’d previously missed or avoided. This particular story is famous as one of those London was accused of plagiarising from a factual article that appeared in the same magazine four years earlier. London said: “I plead guilty… I took the facts of life contained in it, added to them the many other facts of life gained from other sources, and made, or attempted to make, a piece of literature out of them.”\n\nWhatever its genesis, it is a gruelling, thrilling story of survival in the cold, wolf-infested northern wilderness. Our hero, a prospector, is abandoned by his mate when his crocked ankle begins to slow them down. Left with an empty rifle and an empty stomach, what keeps him moving, to his own amazement, is his desperate desire to live.\n\nObstacle after obstacle, pain after pain, I found myself rooting for him, and completely immersed in a beautiful but hostile landscape. By the final act, it has become a story of suspense. Rescue is at hand, but does he have the strength to crawl that final mile?\n\n“The patience of the wolf was terrible. The man's patience was no less terrible. For half a day he lay motionless, fighting off unconsciousness and waiting for the thing that was to feed upon him and upon which he wished to feed. Sometimes the languid sea rose over him and he dreamed long dreams; but ever through it all, waking and dreaming, he waited for the wheezing breath and the harsh caress of the tongue.”\n\n‘Evening Primrose by John Collier (First published in 1940. Collected in Fancies and Goodnights, 1951)\n\nCollier was a British writer in Hollywood whose stories are often saucy and somewhat smart-arsed. This particular tale, however, is considered a classic of weird fiction, and deservedly so.\n\nA poet, struggling for money, decides to move into a New York department store. After all, it’s got everything a man needs to live a comfortable life. Only it turns out he’s not the first person to have had this idea and, after dark, sinister squatters emerge from their hiding places:\n\n“I looked, and it was empty. I looked, and there was an old lady, clambering out from behind the monstrous clock. There were three girls, elderly ingenues, incredibly emaciated, simpering at the entrance of the perfumery. Their hair was a fine floss, pale as gossamer. Equally brittle and colorless was a man with the appearance of a colonel of southern extraction, who stood regarding me while he caressed moustachios that would have done credit to a crystal shrimp. A chintzy woman, possibly of literary tastes, swam forward from the curtains and drapes.”\n\nIt’s not just this store, either. Every shop in New York has its night creatures, including delicatessens and even funeral homes.\n\nCollier walks the line between overblown gothic melodrama (Poe, Ray Russell) and wit. My one-word review on first reading the story was “Ghastly.” It’s one of those pieces of writing that feels wrong, and touched with genuine madness.\n\n‘A Flower in her Hair’ by Pauline C. Smith (First published in Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine, July 1968. Collected in various Alfred Hitchock story collections over the years)\n\nBefore a long train journey I grabbed a copy of Alfred Hitchcock’s Book of Horror Stories, a cheap paperback anthology from the early 1980s. My intention was to read some stories that aren’t part of the canon and perhaps make a discovery or two. Frankly, most of the contents were pretty terrible, but this piece of forgotten folk horror made it worth the slog.\n\nIt’s similar in tone to Thomas Tryon’s cult 1973 novel Harvest Home and is about a young woman, known only as ‘the girl’, who goes to visit distant relatives in the country. The matriarch of the clan, Aunt Abbie, collects human hair in different colours, which she is slowly weaving into a beautiful wreath of flowers. She covets ‘the girl’s’ red hair – a rare colour:\n\n“‘See?’ Aunt Abbie's long finger pointed. ‘I ain't got that rose in yet.’ Reflectively, she gazed at the girl in the chair. ‘I just got the rose left.’”\n\nBut as a point of principle, she only uses hair from dead people. So how else can this go? Art is art, after all.\n\n‘The Swords’ by Robert Aickman (First published in The Fifth Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories, ed. Robert Aickman, 1969. Collected in Cold Hand in Mine, 1975)\n\nIt's as if Aickman thought, “Where's the least spooky place on earth?” and took Wolverhampton as a challenge.\n\nI could have included any number of Aickman stories here, having first read Cold Hand in Mine as a student 25 years ago and feeling as if I’d been initiated into a cult. He’s having a well-deserved moment now, on a similar trajectory to H.P. Lovecraft. Aickman’s great power is in recording how nightmares feel, in drab contemporary settings, and refusing ever to explain what is going on.\n\nHere, we get a lonely young commercial traveller eager to lose his virginity. Wandering the streets of Wolvo, avoiding the miserable boarding house the firm has dumped him in, he finds a fairground on a bombsite. There’s a grotty tent with a seedy show in which men first stab then kiss a pretty girl, who is also available for private shows to respectable men like him. Over tea and pies in a cafe, he gives into temptation, and agrees to bring her back to the boarding house after dark. But his first time with a woman doesn’t go quite as planned.\n\n‘Three Miles Up’ by Elizabeth Jane Howard (First published in We Are for the Dark: Six Ghost Stories, 1951. Collected in Mr. Wrong, 1975)\n\nThis story first appeared in a shared collection with three early stories by Robert Aickman and is similar in style and mood to his work. Like Aickman, Howard insists on her nightmare horrors taking place in recognisably modern settings, without distancing Victoriana and cosy gaslight.\n\n‘Three Miles Up’, like Aickman’s ‘The Trains’ from the same collection, starts with a relatable real-world horror: you’ve agreed to go on holiday with a friend only to realise that perhaps you don’t get along quite as well as you’d imagined. Here, it’s two chaps exploring Britain’s neglected canals on a narrowboat, snapping at each other and bickering. Then they come upon a young woman sleeping on the bank and convince her to join them, hoping her presence might change the dynamic.\n\nShe’s a prototypical manic pixie dream girl, I suppose, except in British mythology pixies are famous for tricking travellers and leading them to their doom:\n\n“To the left was the straight cut which involved the longer journey originally planned; and curving away to the right was the short arm which John advocated. The canal was fringed with rushes, and there was one small cottage with no light in it. Clifford went into the cabin to tell Sharon where they were, and then, as they drifted slowly in the middle of the junction, John suddenly shouted: ‘Clifford! What's the third turning?’”\n\nThe inconclusive ending of the story only adds to its power. Where has this third channel taken them? Have they slipped through time, or into another plane of existence? I wonder if it’s some other aspect of The Beyond from Lucio Fulci’s 1981 film of that name.\n\n‘Like Mother Used to Make’ by Shirley Jackson (First published in The Lottery and Other Stories, 1949)\n\nMany of Shirley Jackson’s stories would fit just as well in horror anthologies as literary collections. Even in a novel called The Haunting of Hill House it’s hard to say for sure that anything supernatural has really happened.\n\nJames Harris, a recurring character in several short stories, might be the devil – or perhaps we just need to accept that ordinary men can also be controlling – and gleefully, pettily wicked.\n\nIn this story, David, a pernickety young man, has his neighbour Marcia over for dinner in his neat little apartment. He doesn’t earn much but what he does have goes on silver cutlery and other small things that make bedsit life tolerable. Then Marcia’s colleague, Mr Harris, shows up. Without explanation, Marcia begins to act as if David’s flat is hers, and as if she has cooked the gourmet dinner on the table. David, trapped in a game of manners, plays along:\n\nEventually, he leaves his own flat, defeated:\n\n“He went down the hall and let himself into Marcia's apartment, the piano was still awry, the papers were still on the floor, the laundry scattered, the bed unmade. David sat down on the bed and looked around. It was cold, it was dirty, and as he thought miserably of his own warm home he heard faintly down the hall the sound of laughter and the scrape of a chair being moved. Then, still faintly, the sound of his radio. Wearily, David leaned over and picked up a paper from the floor, and then he began to gather them up one by one.”\n\nRay Newman is a writer and editor based in Bristol.
