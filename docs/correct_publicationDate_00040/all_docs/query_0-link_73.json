        "text": "Mark V. Ziesing\n\nThe Hunger and Ecstasy of Vampires (1996)\n\nBrian Stableford\n\nI first encountered Brian Stableford's work in the Grainger (aka Hooded Swan) ) series of science fiction novels done by DAW in the early 70s. In the recent past, he has done more fantasy and horror that anything else. This original novel is rather offbeat in comparison to his usual work. It follows the adventures of a time-traveling professor and includes appearances by Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, Oscar Wilde and a bunch more of the late Victorian mainstays so familiar to most readers.\n\nSilicon Embrace (1996)\n\nJohn Shirley\n\nAliens have been watching us for a long time. But now they are finally ready to go public with the help of the US government. But they need the right spin. Faraday, an experienced ad man is hired. Because civilization in 2017 has changed -- there is the Famine, the new American Civil War, the sparring fundamentalist groups, the survivalist warlords, etc. Add to the mix a alien splinter group to whom a kid named Anatole becomes oddly important and an alternative-media guy named Quinn and his band of peculiar companions. A secret Nevada military base will serve as one meeting point for those from officialdom, anarchy, and general bewilderment while an East Coast prison is another. And then there's a manic, frowsy tramp called the Street Sweeper... About the only adjective that seems inapplicable to John Shirley's work is tame.\n\nSlippage (1997)\n\nHarlan Ellison\n\nThis mix of 25 items are all previously uncollected. One story is by Donald E. Westlake, along with an essay and teleplay written by Harlan Ellison. This editon includes 4 items which do not appear in the Houghton Mifflin edition which is titled Slippage: Previously Uncollected, Precariously Poised Stories. It collects the following items:\n\nIntroduction: The Fault in My Lines\n\nThe Man Who Rowed Christopher Columbus Ashore\n\nAnywhere But Here, with Anybody But You\n\nCrazy as a Soup Sandwich\n\nDarkness Upon the Face of the Deep\n\nThe Pale Silver Dollar of the Moon Pays Its Way and Makes Change [version 1]\n\nThe Pale Silver Dollar of the Moon Pays Its Way and Makes Change [version 2]\n\nThe Lingering Scent of Woodsmoke\n\nThe Museum on Cyclops Avenue\n\nGo Toward the Light\n\nMefisto in Onyx\n\nWhere I Shall Dwell in the Next World\n\nChatting with Anubis\n\nThe Few, the Proud\n\nThe Deadly \"Nackles\" Affair\n\nNackles [as by Curt Clark] by Donald E. Westlake\n\nNackles [teleplay]\n\nSensible City\n\nThe Dragon on the Bookshelf [written with Robert Silverberg]\n\nKeyboard\n\nJane Doe #112\n\nThe Dreams a Nightmare Dreams\n\nPulling Hard Time\n\nScartaris, June 28th\n\nShe's a Young Thing and Cannot Leave Her Mother\n\nMidnight in the Sunken Cathedral\n\nForthcoming Titles\n\nBooks slated for future release include:\n\nA Curious Volume of Forgotten Lore edited by Mark V. Ziesing which features weird and dark stories about books and book collectors. Contributors include Thomas Ligotti, Brian Stableford, A.A. Attanasio, Patrick O'Leary, and several others.\n\nA Handbook of American Prayer by Lucius Shepard is planned once the author finally turns in his manuscript.\n\nMark V. Ziesing\n\nBack in the USSA (1997)\n\nKim Newman & Eugene Byrne\n\nAfter a 1917 revolution, the US became a socialist super-power opposed to the other one, Czarist Russia. Not really a novel, this episodic adventure spans the years between 1912 and 1989 (all but one of the stories were published originally in the British magazine Interzone) We meet a mixture of real and fictional characters. Trying to figure out the story context is half the fun. In the book you'll run across Norman Bates, Harlan Ellison, Jake and Elwood Blues, Randall Flagg, Harry Truman and Isaac Asimov. A familiarity with \"Apocalypse Now\" will add to the flavour of \"Teddy Bears' Picnic\" while \"Abdication Street\" tips its hat to the UK TV series, \"Coronation Street.\" It collects the following stories:\n\nIn the Air (1989)\n\nTen Days That Shook the World (1912-1917)\n\nTom Joad (1937)\n\nTeddy Bears' Picnic (1965-1969)\n\nCitizen Ed (1945-1984)\n\nAbdication Street (1972)\n\nOn the Road (1998)\n\nBlack Butterflies: A Flock on the Dark Side (1998)\n\nJohn Shirley\n\nSplit in two parts, Black Butterflies contains 8 stories set in \"This World\" (aka reality) and 8 stories set in \"That World\" (the surreal, the supernatural), 2 of which are original to the collection. Apparently John Shirley wanted the trade paperback format rather that hard cover in order to be affordable by his fans. Story highlights include \"Barbara,\" a story about a woman carjacked by two punks who shows them the true meaning of the word sociopath. Then there is \"How Deep the Taste of Love,\" an exploration of sexual fantasies by a recent widower with someone he picks up in a bar. It collects the following stories:\n\nThis World\n\nBarbara\n\nWar and Peace\n\nYou Hear What Buddy and Ray Did?\n\nAnswering Machine\n\nThe Rubber Smile\n\nThe Footlite\n\nCram\n\nWhat Would You Do For Love\n\nThat World\n\nDelia and The Dinner Party\n\nPearldoll\n\nWoodgrains\n\nThe Exquisitely Bleeding Heads Of Doktur\n\nPalmer Vreedeez\n\nFlaming Telepaths\n\nHow Deep the Taste of Love\n\nAftertaste\n\nBlack Hole Sun, Won't You Come"
