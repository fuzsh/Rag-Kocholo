        "text": "English writer and novelist (born 1959)\n\nKim James Newman (born 31 July 1959) is an English journalist, film critic and fiction writer.[1] He is interested in film history and horror fiction—both of which he attributes to seeing Tod Browning's Dracula at the age of eleven—and alternative history. He has won the Bram Stoker Award, the International Horror Guild Award and the BSFA award.\n\nKim Newman was born 31 July 1959 in Brixton, London, the son of Bryan Michael Newman and Julia Christen Newman, both potters.[1][2] His sister, Sasha, was born in 1961, and their mother died in 2003.[1] Newman attended \"a progressive kindergarten and a primary school in Brixton, and then Huish Episcopi County Primary School in Langport, Somerset\".[1] In 1966 the family moved to Aller, Somerset.[1] He was educated at Dr. Morgan's Grammar School for Boys in Bridgwater.[1][3] While he attended, the school merged with two others to become Haygrove Comprehensive.[1] He graduated from the University of Sussex with an English degree in 1980 and set a short story, Angel Down, Sussex (1999) in the area.[1] Newman acted in school plays and with the Bridgwater Youth Theatre.[1]\n\nEarly in his career, Newman was a journalist for the magazines City Limits and Knave.\n\nNewman's first two books were the non-fiction Ghastly Beyond Belief: The Science Fiction and Fantasy Book of Quotations (1985), co-written with his friend Neil Gaiman, a light-hearted tribute to entertainingly bad prose in fantastic fiction and Nightmare Movies: A Critical History of the Horror Film, 1968–88 (1988) is a serious history of horror films. An expanded edition, an update of his overview of post-1968 genre cinema, was published in 2011. Nightmare Movies was followed by Wild West Movies: Or How the West Was Found, Won, Lost, Lied About, Filmed and Forgotten (1990) and Millennium Movies: End of the World Cinema (1999). Newman's non-fiction also includes the BFI Companion to Horror (1996).\n\nNewman and Stephen Jones jointly edited Horror: 100 Best Books, the 1988 horror volume in Xanadu's 100 Best series and Horror: Another 100 Best Books, a 2005 sequel from Carroll & Graf, U.S. publisher of the series. The books comprise 100 essays by 100 horror writers about 100 horror books and both won the annual Bram Stoker Award for Best Non-Fiction.[4]\n\nNewman is a contributing editor to the UK film magazine Empire, as well as writing the monthly segment, \"Kim Newman's Video Dungeon\", in which he gives often scathing reviews of recently released straight-to-video horror films. He contributes to Rotten Tomatoes, Venue, Video Watchdog ('The Perfectionist's Guide to Fantastic Video') and Sight and Sound.[5] Newman is the author of the Doctor Who entry in the British Film Institute's book series on TV Classics.[6] In 2018, Newman became the chief writer on the BBC Four documentary series Mark Kermode's Secrets of Cinema.\n\nNewman participated in the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll, where he listed his ten favorite films as follows: 2001: A Space Odyssey, Apocalypse Now, A Canterbury Tale, Céline and Julie Go Boating, Citizen Kane, Duck Amuck, Let's Scare Jessica to Death, Mulholland Drive, Notorious, and To Have and Have Not.[7]\n\nNewman's first published novel was The Night Mayor (1989), set in a virtual reality, based on old black-and-white detective movies.[8] In the same year, as \"Jack Yeovil\", he began contributing to a series of novels published by Games Workshop, set in the world of their Warhammer and Dark Future wargaming and role-playing games. Games Workshop's fiction imprint Black Flame returned the Dark Future books to print in 2006, publishing Demon Download, Krokodil Tears, Comeback Tour and the expanded, 250-page version of the short story \"Route 666\".\n\nAnno Dracula was published in 1992. The novel is set in 1888, during Jack the Ripper's killing spree—but a different 1888, in which Dracula became the ruler of England. Anno Dracula was followed by the Anno Dracula series of novels and shorter works, that followed the same alternative history. The fourth novel in the series was published in 2013 as Johnny Alucard.[9]\n\nOther novels include Life's Lottery (1999), in which the protagonist's life story is determined by the reader's choices[10] (an adult version of the Choose Your Own Adventure series of children's books), The Quorum (1994), Jago (1991) and Bad Dreams (1990).\n\nNewman wrote a Doctor Who novella, Time and Relative in 2001.\n\nThe Night Mayor (1989)\n\nBad Dreams (1990)\n\nJago (1991)\n\nThe Quorum (1994)\n\nLife's Lottery (1999)\n\nAnno Dracula series\n\nAnno Dracula (1992)\n\nThe Bloody Red Baron (1995)\n\nDracula Cha Cha Cha (also published as Judgment of Tears: Anno Dracula 1959) (1998)\n\nJohnny Alucard (2013)\n\nOne Thousand Monsters (2017)\n\nAnno Dracula 1999: Daikaiju (2019)\n\nTime and Relative (2001)\n\nAn English Ghost Story (2014)\n\nThe Secrets of Drearcliffe Grange School (2015)[11][12][13][14][15]\n\nThe Haunting of Drearcliff Grange School (2018)\n\nAngels of Music (2016)\n\nSomething More Than Night (2021)\n\nThe Original Dr. Shade, and Other Stories (1994)\n\nFamous Monsters (1995)\n\nBack in the USSA (1997) (with Eugene Byrne)\n\nSeven Stars (2000)\n\nWhere the Bodies are Buried (2000)\n\nUnforgivable Stories (2000)\n\nDead Travel Fast (2005)\n\nDiogenes Club series\n\nThe Man from the Diogenes Club (2006)\n\nThe Secret Files of the Diogenes Club (2007)\n\nMysteries of the Diogenes Club (2010)\n\nThe Man From the Diogenes Club (2017)\n\nMoriarty: The Hound of the D'Urbervilles (Titan Books, 2011; ISBN 9780857682833)\n\nAnno Dracula – 1895: Seven Days in Mayhem (Titan Comics, 2017, five issues) with artist Paul McCaffrey.\n\nWarhammer setting\n\nDrachenfels (1989)\n\nBeasts in Velvet (1991)\n\nGenevieve Undead (1993, three novellas published as a single book)\n\nSilver Nails (2002, short stories)\n\nThe Vampire Genevieve (2005, compilation of the above four books)\n\nDark Future setting\n\nKrokodil Tears (1990)\n\nDemon Download (1990)\n\nRoute 666 (1993)\n\nComeback Tour (1991)\n\nOrgy of the Blood Parasites (1994)\n\n\"The Big Fish\" in Shadows over Innsmouth (1994)\n\nThe Horror Writers of America Bram Stoker Award for Best Non Fiction, shared 1989 (Horror: 100 Best Books, edited by Stephen Jones and Newman)[4]\n\nThe Horror Writers of America Bram Stoker Award for Best Non Fiction, shared 2005 (Horror: Another 100 Best Books, eds.
