        "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground The surgical burden in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) as reported by the number of surgical cases per capita is great. To improve global health and help address this burden, there has been a rise in surgical outreach to LMICs. In high-income countries, an electronic health record (EHR) is used to document and communicate data critical to the quality of care and patient safety. Despite this, there is little guidance or precedence on the data elements or processes for utilizing an EHR on outreach trips. We validated data elements and process steps for utilizing an EHR for hand surgery outreach trips. Methods We conducted a literature review to identify data elements collected during surgical outreach trips. A future-state process map for the collection and documentation of data elements within an EHR was developed through literature review and semistructured interviews with experts in global outreach. An expert consortium completed a modified RAND/University of California at Los Angeles Delphi process to evaluate the importance and feasibility of each data element and process step. Results In total, 65 data elements (e.g., date of birth) and 24 process steps (e.g., surgical site marking) were validated for use in an EHR for hand surgery outreach trips to LMICs. Conclusion This validated portfolio of data elements/process steps can serve as the foundation for pilot testing of an EHR to document and communicate critical patient data on hand surgery outreach trips. Utilization of an EHR during outreach trips to LMICs may serve to improve the safety and quality of care provided. The validated data elements/process steps can serve as a guide for EHR development and implementation of other surgical specialties.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1055/s-0042-1749465\n\nView details for PubMedID 38152677\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10751199\n\nAbstract\n\nDelayed or missed diagnosis of perilunate or lunate dislocations can lead to significant morbidity. Advances in computer vision provide an opportunity to improve diagnostic performance. In this study, a deep learning algorithm was utilized for detection of perilunate and lunate dislocations on lateral wrist radiographs. A total of 435 lateral wrist radiographs were labeled as normal or pathologic (perilunate or lunate dislocation). The lunate in each radiograph was segmented with a rectangular bounding box. Images were partitioned into training and test sets. Two neural networks, consisting of an object detector followed by an image classifier, were applied in series. First, the object detection module was used to localize the lunate. Next, the image classifier performed a binary classification for normal or pathologic. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the overall system were evaluated. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the associated area under the curve (AUC) were used to demonstrate the overall performance of the computer vision algorithm. The lunate object detector was 97.0% accurate at identifying the lunate. Accuracy was 98.7% among the sub-group of normal wrist radiographs, and 91.3% among the sub-group of wrist radiographs with perilunate/lunate dislocations. The perilunate/lunate dislocation classifier had a sensitivity (recall) of 93.8%, specificity of 93.3%, and accuracy of 93.4%. The AUC was 0.986. We have developed a proof-of-concept computer vision system for diagnosis of perilunate/lunate dislocations on lateral wrist radiographs. This novel deep learning algorithm has potential to improve clinical sensitivity to ultimately prevent delayed or missed diagnosis of these injuries.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/PRS.0000000000010928\n\nView details for PubMedID 37467052\n\nAbstract\n\nOutcomes after repair of chronic rotator cuff injuries remain suboptimal. Type-1 collagen-rich tendon hydrogel was previously reported to improve healing in a rat chronic rotator cuff injury model. Stem cell seeding of the tendon hydrogel improved bone quality in the same model. This study aimed to examine whether there was a synergistic and dose-dependent effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on tendon-bone interface healing by combining PRP with stem cell-seeded tendon hydrogel. Human cadaveric tendons were processed into a hydrogel. PRP was prepared at two different platelet concentrations: an initial concentration (initial PRP group) and a higher concentration (concentrated PRP group). Tendon hydrogel was mixed with adipose-derived stem cells and one of the platelet concentrations. Methylcellulose, as opposed to saline, was used as a negative control due to comparable viscosity. The supraspinatus tendon was detached bilaterally in 33 Sprague-Dawley rats (66 shoulders). Eight weeks later, each detached tendon was repaired, and a hydrogel mixture or control was injected at the repair site. Eight weeks after repair, shoulder samples were harvested and assigned for biomechanical testing (n = 42 shoulders) or a combination of bone morphological and histological assessment (n = 24 shoulders). Biomechanical testing showed significantly higher failure load and stiffness in the concentrated PRP group than in control. Yield load in the initial and concentrated PRP groups were significantly higher than that in the control. There were no statistically significant differences between the initial and concentrated PRP groups. The addition of the highly concentrated PRP to stem cells-seeded tendon hydrogel improved healing biomechanically after chronic rotator cuff injury in rats compared to control. However, synergistic and dose-dependent effects were not seen.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/09636897231190174\n\nView details for PubMedID 37592455\n\nAbstract\n\nPURPOSE: Partial rotator cuff tears can cause shoulder pain and dysfunction and are more common than complete tears. However, few studies examine partial injuries in small animals and, therefore a robust, clinically relevant model may be lacking. This study aimed to fully characterize the established rat model of partial rotator cuff injury over time and determine if it models human partial rotator cuff tears.METHODS: We created a full-thickness, partial-width injury at the supraspinatus tendon-bone interface bilaterally in 31 Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were euthanized immediately, and at 2-, 3-, 4-, and 8-weeks after surgery. Fourteen intact shoulders were used as controls. Samples were assessed biomechanically, histologically, and morphologically.RESULTS: Biomechanically, load to failure in controls and 8 weeks after injury was significantly greater than immediately and 3 weeks after injury. Load to failure at 8 weeks was comparable to control. However, the locations of failure were different between intact shoulders and partially injured samples. Bone mineral density at 8 weeks was significantly greater than that at 2 and 3 weeks. Although no animals demonstrated propagation to complete tear and the injury site remodeled histologically, the appearance at 8 weeks was not identical to that in the controls.CONCLUSIONS: The biomechanical properties and bone quality decreased after the injury and was restored gradually over time with full restoration by 8 weeks after injury. However, the findings were not equivalent to the intact shoulder. This study demonstrated the limitations of the current model in its application to long-term outcome studies, and the need for better models that can be used to assess chronic partial rotator cuff injuries.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: There is no small animal model that mimics human chronic partial rotator cuff tears, which limits our ability to improve care for this common condition.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jhsa.2022.08.027\n\nView details for PubMedID 36280554\n\nAbstract\n\nThe objective of this study was to quantify the cost-effectiveness and economic value of a reconstructive surgery visiting educator trip program in a resource-constrained setting.Reconstructive surgical capacity remains inadequate in low- and middle-income countries, resulting in chronic disability and a significant economic toll. Education and training of the local surgical workforce to sustainably expand capacity have been increasingly encouraged, but economic analyses of these interventions are lacking.Data were analyzed from 12 visiting educator trips and independently-performed surgical procedures at 3 Vietnamese hospitals between 2014 and 2019. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using standardized methodology and thresholds to determine cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity analyses were performed with disability weights, discounting, and costs from different perspectives. Economic benefit was estimated using both the human capital method and the value of a statistical life method, and a benefit-cost ratio was computed.In the base case analysis, the visiting educator program was very cost-effective at $581 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Economic benefit was between $21·6 million and $29·3 million, corresponding to a 12- to 16-fold return on investment. Furthermore, when considering only costs to the organization, the cost decreased to $61 per DALY averted, with a 113- to 153-fold return on investment for the organization.Visiting educator programs, which build local reconstructive surgical capacity in limited-resource environments, can be very cost-effective with significant economic benefit and return on investment. These findings may help guide organizations, donors, and policymakers in resource allocation in global surgery.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/AS9.0000000000000181\n\nView details for PubMedID 37601156\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10431359\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) from high-income countries provide surgical outreach for patients in low and middle-income countries (LMICs); however, these efforts lack a coordinated measurement of their ability to build capacity. While the World Health Organization and others recommend outreach trips that aim to build the capacity of the local health-care system, no guidance exists on how to accomplish this. The objective of this paper is to establish a framework and a blueprint to guide the operations of NGOs that provide outreach to build orthopaedic surgical capacity in LMICs.METHODS: We conducted a qualitative analysis of semistructured interviews with 16 orthopaedic surgeons and administrators located in 7 countries (6 LMICs) on the necessary domains for capacity-building; the analysis was guided by a literature review of capacity-building frameworks. We subsequently conducted a modified nominal group technique with a consortium of 10 U.S.-based surgeons with expertise in global surgical outreach, which was member-checked with 8 new stakeholders from 4 LMICs.RESULTS: A framework with 7 domains for capacity-building in global surgical outreach was identified. The domains included professional development, finance, partnerships, governance, community impact, culture, and coordination. These domains were tiered in a hierarchical system to stratify the level of capacity for each domain. A blueprint was developed to guide the operations of an organization seeking to build capacity.CONCLUSIONS: The developed framework identified 7 domains to address when building capacity during global orthopaedic surgical outreach. The framework and its tiered system can be used to assess capacity and guide capacity-building efforts in LMICs. The developed blueprint can inform the operations of NGOs toward activities that focus on building capacity in order to ensure a measured and sustained impact.\n\nView details for DOI 10.2106/JBJS.22.00353\n\nView details for PubMedID 35984012\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Building local surgical capacity in low-income and middle-income countries is critical to addressing the unmet global surgical need. Visiting educator programs can be utilized to train local surgeons, but the quantitative impact on surgical capacity has not yet been fully described. The authors' objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of training utilizing a visiting educator program on local reconstructive surgical capacity in Vietnam.METHODS: A reconstructive surgery visiting educator program was implemented in Vietnam. Topics of training were based on needs defined by local surgeons, including those specializing in hand surgery, microsurgery, and craniofacial surgery. A retrospective analysis of annual case numbers corresponding to covered topics between the years 2014 and 2019 at each hospital was conducted to determine reconstructive surgical volume and procedures per surgeon over time. Direct costs, indirect costs, and value of volunteer services for each trip were calculated.RESULTS: Over the course of 5 years, 12 visiting educator trips were conducted across three hospitals in Vietnam. Local surgeons subsequently independently performed a total of 2018 operations corresponding to topics covered during visiting educator trips, or a mean of 136 operations annually per surgeon. Within several years, the hospitals experienced an 81.5 percent increase in surgical volume for these reconstructive clinical conditions, and annual case volume continues to increase over time. Total costs were $191,290, for a mean cost per trip of $15,941.CONCLUSIONS: Surgical capacity can be successfully expanded by utilizing targeted visiting educator trips to train local reconstructive surgeons. Local providers ultimately independently perform an increased volume of complex procedures and provide further training to others.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/PRS.0000000000008874\n\nView details for PubMedID 35089267\n\nAbstract\n\nEarly detection of limb ischemia, strokes, and heart attacks may be enabled via long-term monitoring of arterial health. Early stenosis, decreased blood flow, and clots are common after surgical vascular bypass or plaque removal from a diseased vessel and can lead to the above diseases. Continuous arterial monitoring for the early diagnosis of such complications is possible by implanting a sensor during surgery that is wirelessly monitored by patients after surgery. Here, we report the design of a wireless capacitive sensor wrapped around the artery during surgery for continuous post-operative monitoring of arterial health. The sensor responds to diverse artery sizes and extents of occlusion invitro to at least 20cm upstream and downstream of the sensor. It demonstrated strong capability to monitor progression of arterial occlusion in human cadaver and small animal models. This technology is promising for wireless monitoring of arterial health for pre-symptomatic disease detection and prevention.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.isci.2021.103079\n\nView details for PubMedID 34568798\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: ReSurge International is a nongovernmental organization that organizes surgical team trips to low- and middle-income countries. Cleft palate repair is commonly performed on these trips. A comprehensive cleft care program was implemented to help reduce postoperative palatal fistula rates.METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients undergoing cleft palate repair surgery with ReSurge International in Vietnam from 2013 through 2019 was performed. The cleft care program was implemented in 2018. This intervention involved preoperative education of patients and close postoperative monitoring. Critically, this program also provided closer access to providers. Subsequent follow-up was performed by a ReSurge physician. Parent-reported outcomes were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively using 5-point Likert-like survey questions.RESULTS: Two hundred three patients underwent cleft palate repair. The patients were older and of higher Veau classification than is usually seen in the United States. The palatal fistula rate in the preintervention group was 37.5% and 14.3% in the intervention group (P = 0.014). Patients without fistulas demonstrated improvements on parent-reported outcomes compared with those with fistulas, with food less likely to go up their nose (P < 0.001), less difficulty eating (P < 0.001), and more understandable speech (P = 0.015).CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a comprehensive cleft palate program reduced postoperative fistula rates by more than 50%. Improvements in parent-reported outcomes were observed after surgery among patients without fistulas. The blueprint for improved outcomes in these more complex patients includes enhanced perioperative patient counseling, close follow-up, and maintenance of communication with patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/SAP.0000000000002795\n\nView details for PubMedID 33661215\n\nAbstract\n\nSuccess in global surgery interventions cannot be claimed until consistent long-term follow up is achieved and corresponding outcomes are studied. However, post-operative outcomes remain inconsistently collected and analyzed in the setting of global surgery, with current efforts largely focused on the delivery of surgical care. Barriers in low- and middle-income countries include patient cost and distance, low surgical workforce capacity, poor patient health literacy, lack of affordable technology availability, inconsistent documentation, and structural deficiencies. Here, we suggest that future work can be focused on (1) enhancing systems to facilitate long-term follow up and care, (2) expanding availability and adoption of electronic medical record systems, and (3) collaboration with local surgeons in the development of international cross-organizational registries and standardized quality measures. Long-term collaborations between local healthcare administrators and providers, policymakers, international bodies, nonprofit organizations, patients, and the private sector are necessary to build and sustain processes to achieve reliable long-term follow up and rigorous data collection, with the goal of ultimately ensuring better patient outcomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ijsu.2021.01.011\n\nView details for PubMedID 33513453\n\nAbstract\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of using mouse models for translational study of flexor tendon repair and reconstruction.Quantitative data detailing the gross anatomy, biomechanical characteristics, and microscopic structure of the deep digit flexor tendon (DDF) of the mouse hindpaw were obtained. Histological characterization of the DDF and the anatomy of the digit in the mouse hindpaw are detailed. Biomechanical testing determined the load-to-failure, stress, elastic modulus, and the site of tendon failure.In gross anatomy, the origins and insertions of the mouse deep digit flexor tendon are similar to those of the human digit, surrounded by a synovial sheath that is only 1- to 2-cells thick. A neurovascular network runs on each side of the digit outside the synovial sheath, but does not clearly penetrate it. The thickness of the DDF is 0.14 ± 0.03 mm and the width is 0.3 ± 0.03 mm. The thickness of the DDF is less than that of 9-0 nylon needle. The mean failure force of the deep flexor tendon was 2.79 ± 0.53N.The gross anatomy of the mouse hindpaw digit is similar to that of the human digit except for key differences seen in the synovial sheath and vascular supply. The dimensions of the mouse DDF make it challenging to create a clinically translatable repair model using currently available surgical techniques. Despite the similarities between the human and mouse anatomy, and the powerful basic science tools available in murine models, mice are an unreliable model for assessing flexor tendon injury and repair.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/GOX.0000000000003359\n\nView details for PubMedID 33552814\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7859083\n\nAbstract\n\nOur laboratory has previously developed a novel collagen-rich hydrogel (cHG), which significantly increases the speed of wound healing in diabetic rats.In this study, we examine the in vitro survival and migration of fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and adipose-derived stem cells in a novel cHG. Furthermore, we test the ability of adipose-derived stem cell-seeded cHG to support cell survival and accelerate healing in vivo.In vitro, cell survival within the cHG was retained for 25 days. We were unable to detect cellular migration into, out of, or through cHG. In the in vivo model, bioluminescence of stem cells seeded within the cHG in diabetic rat wounds was detected until day 10. Rate of wound closure was higher for cHG plus adipose-derived stem cells versus control from day 2 until day 16 and significant on days 6, 8, and 12 (P < 0.05). This significant difference was also observed on day 16 by histology (P ≤ 0.05).We conclude that cHG is a good candidate for delivering adipose-derived stem cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts to wounds. Future studies will determine whether the delivery of combinations of different cell lines in cHG further enhances wound healing.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/GOX.0000000000003049\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000572118600049\n\nView details for PubMedID 32983797\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7489666\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Chronic wounds are a prominent concern, accounting for $25 billion of healthcare costs annually. Biofilms have been implicated in delayed wound closure, but treatment options continue to be limited and susceptible to developing antibiotic resistance. A novel collagen-rich hydrogel derived from human extracellular matrix presents an avenue for treating chronic wounds by providing appropriate extracellular proteins for healing and promoting neovascularization. Using the hydrogel as a delivery system for localized secretion of therapeutic dosage of antibiotics presents an attractive means of maximizing delivery while minimizing systemic side-effects. We hypothesize that the hydrogel can provide controlled elution of antibiotics leading to inhibition of bacterial growth and disruption of biofilm formation.METHOD: The rate of antibiotic elution from the collagen-rich hydrogel and the efficacy of biofilm disruption was assessed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa Bacterial growth inhibition, biofilm disruption, and mammalian cell cytotoxicity were quantified using in vitro models.RESULTS: The antibiotic-loaded hydrogel showed sustained release of antibiotics for up to 24 hours at therapeutic levels. The treatment inhibited bacterial growth and disrupted biofilm formation at multiple time points. The hydrogel was capable of accommodating various classes of antibiotics and did not result in cytotoxicity in mammalian fibroblasts or adipose stem cellsConclusion: An antibiotic-loaded collagen-rich hydrogel is capable of controlled antibiotic release effective for bacteria cell death without native cell death. A human-derived hydrogel that is capable of eluting therapeutic levels of antibiotic is an exciting prospect in the field of chronic wound healing.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1128/AAC.00136-20\n\nView details for PubMedID 32690648\n\nAbstract\n\nTrauma is the leading cause of mortality in patients aged 5 years and older. Globally, trauma kills more people than malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDs combined. As the number of surgical outreach trips to low- and middle-income countries and resources provided for such trips increase, hand surgeons are uniquely positioned to address this global burden. However, the delivery of surgical care alone is insufficient without effectively evaluating the quality of care delivered. It is critical that the care provided on outreach trips improves patient and population health, does not harm patients, and develops the local health care ecosystem. An estimated 8 million lives could be saved annually in low- and middle-income countries with higher-quality health systems. Currently, data collection systems for evaluating quality during outreach trips are lacking. Insight into current methods of quality assessment and improvement in both developing and developed countries can help inform future efforts to implement innovative data collection systems. Thoughtful and sustainable collaboration with host sites in low- and middle-income countries can ensure that care delivery is culturally competent and improves population health.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jhsa.2020.04.027\n\nView details for PubMedID 32680787\n\nAbstract\n\nPURPOSE: Tendons are difficult to heal owing to their hypocellularity and hypovascularity. Our laboratory has developed a tendon-derived hydrogel (tHG) that significantly improves tendon healing in an animal model. We hypothesized that a potential mechanism for improved healing with tHG is through the attraction of systemic stem cells.METHODS: Homing of systemic adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) to tendon injuries was assessed with acute and chronic injury models. Injury sites were treated with saline or tHG, and animals given a tail vein injection (TVI) of labeled ADSCs 1 week after treatment. One week following TVI, rats were harvested for histology. To further evaluate a potential difference in homing to tHG, a subcutaneous injection (SQI) model was used. Rats were treated with an SQI of saline, silicone, ADSCs in media, tHG, tHG+ fibroblasts (FBs), or tHG+ ADSCs on day 0. One week after SQI, rats underwent TVI with labeled ADSCs. Samples were harvested 2 or 3 weeks after SQI for analysis. Flow cytometry confirmed homing in the SQI model.RESULTS: Systemically delivered ADSCs homed to both acute tendon and chronic tendon-bone interface (TBI) injury sites. Despite their presence at the injury site, there was no difference in the number of macrophages, amount of cell proliferation, or angiogenesis 1 week after stem cell delivery.In an SQI model, ADSCs homed to tHG. There was no difference in the number of ADSCs homing to tHG alone versus tHG+ ADSCs. However, there was an increase in the number of living cells, general immune cells, and T-cells present at tHG+ ADSC versus tHG alone.CONCLUSIONS: The ADSCs home to tendon injury sites and tHG. We believe the attraction of additional systemic ADSCs is one mechanism for improved tendon and TBI healing with tHG.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Treatment of tendon and TBI injuries with tHG can augment healing via homing of systemic stem cells.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jhsa.2020.05.003\n\nView details for PubMedID 32605739\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: As global rates of mortality decrease, rates of non-fatal injury have increased, particularly in low Socio-demographic Index (SDI) nations. We hypothesised this global pattern of non-fatal injury would be demonstrated in regard to bony hand and wrist trauma over the 27-year study period.METHODS: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 was used to estimate prevalence, age-standardised incidence and years lived with disability for hand trauma in 195 countries from 1990 to 2017. Individual injuries included hand and wrist fractures, thumb amputations and non-thumb digit amputations.RESULTS: The global incidence of hand trauma has only modestly decreased since 1990. In 2017, the age-standardised incidence of hand and wrist fractures was 179 per 100000 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 146 to 217), whereas the less common injuries of thumb and non-thumb digit amputation were 24 (95% UI 17 to 34) and 56 (95% UI 43 to 74) per 100 000, respectively. Rates of injury vary greatly by region, and improvements have not been equally distributed. The highest burden of hand trauma is currently reported in high SDI countries. However, low-middle and middle SDI countries have increasing rates of hand trauma by as much at 25%.CONCLUSIONS: Certain regions are noted to have high rates of hand trauma over the study period. Low-middle and middle SDI countries, however, have demonstrated increasing rates of fracture and amputation over the last 27 years. This trend is concerning as access to quality and subspecialised surgical hand care is often limiting in these resource-limited regions.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1136/injuryprev-2019-043495\n\nView details for PubMedID 32169973\n\nAbstract\n\nApplication of collagen products to wounds has been shown to improve wound healing. Using a collagen-based hydrogel (cHG) capable of cellular support previously developed by our laboratory, we hypothesize that our hydrogel will increase the speed of wound healing by providing a 3-dimensional framework for cellular support, increasing angiogenesis and cell-proliferation at the wound bed.Two, 10-mm excisional wounds were created over the dorsum of 12 male, genetically modified Zucker diabetic rats. Wounds were splinted open to limit healing by wound contracture. One wound was treated with an occlusive dressing (OD), whereas the adjacent wound was treated with an OD plus cHG. Occlusive dressings were changed every other day. Hydrogel was applied on day 2 and every 4 days after until complete wound closure. Rate of wound closure was monitored with digital photography every other day. Wounds were harvested at days 10 and 16 for histological and immunohistochemical analysis.Wound closure was significantly faster in cHG-treated wounds compared with OD-treated wounds. By day 10, cHG-treated wounds achieved 63% wound closure, compared with 55% wound closure in OD-treated wounds (P < 0.05). By day 16, cHG-treated wounds achieved 84% wound closure, compared with 68% wound closure in OD-treated wounds (P < 0.05).Histologically, wound depth was not different between the cHG and OD groups on days 10 and 16. However, wound length was significantly less in the cHG group compared with the OD group (P < 0.05) consistent with digital photographic analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis for RECA-1 demonstrated that blood vessel density in the wound bed was 2.3 times higher in the cHG group compared with the OD group (P = 0.01) on day 16. Cell proliferation was 3.8 times higher in the cHG group versus the OD group (P < 0.05) on day 10.Collagen-based hydrogel-treated wounds demonstrated significantly improved healing compared with control. The thermoresponsive feature of collagen hydrogel and its structural stability at body temperature demonstrate promising clinical potential as a vehicle for the delivery of therapeutic cells to the wound bed.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/SAP.0000000000002380\n\nView details for PubMedID 32349080\n\nAbstract\n\nThe ReSurge Global Training Program (RGTP) is a model for building reconstructive surgery capacity in low- and middle-income countries.1 The aim of this study is to assess attitudes toward social media, to develop an initial RGTP Facebook Education Group, and to assess the early results of the group's implementation.A survey of the RGTP community assessed group demographic, interests, concerns, and familiarity with Facebook from July to August of 2018. A \"secret\" Facebook group was launched on October 30, 2018. Narrated lectures were posted weekly to the group. Educational cases were shared on the group's discussion page. Facebook \"Group Insights\" and individual post review were used to obtain group statistics.Senior faculty were less likely to have an existing Facebook account (58% vs 93%, P < 0.05). Trainees were more confident using Facebook (97% vs 54%, P < 0.05) and favored viewing the training curriculum through Facebook (93.0%, P < 0.05). At 6 months, the group enrolled 103 members from 14 countries. Twenty-two lectures were posted, obtaining an average of 59.4 views (range, 36-78).

The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of burnout specifically among hand surgeons and to identify factors unique to the practice of hand surgery that may contribute to burnout.A Web-based survey, developed in conjunction with the American Medical Association, was administered to all active and lifetime members of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand using the Mini Z Burnout assessment tool. Additional data were collected regarding physician demographics and practice characteristics.The final cohort included 595 US hand surgeons (American Society for Surgery of the Hand members) and demonstrated that 77% of respondents were satisfied with their job, although 49% regarded themselves as having burnout. Lower burnout rates were correlated with physicians aged older than 65, those who practice in an outpatient setting, practice hand surgery only, visit one facility per week, having a lower commute time, those who performed 10 or fewer surgeries per month, and being considered grandfathered for Maintenance of Certification. It was shown that sex, the use of physician extenders, compensation level, and travel club involvement had no impact on burnout rates.The survey demonstrated that nearly half of US hand surgeons experience burnout even though most are satisfied with their jobs. There is a need to increase awareness and promote targeted interventions to reduce burnout, such as creating a strong team culture, improving resiliency, and enhancing leadership.Burnout has been shown to affect physicians, their families, patient care, and the health care system as a whole negatively. The findings should promote awareness among hand surgeons and inform future quality improvement efforts targeted at reducing burnout for hand surgeons.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jhsa.2020.03.023\n\nView details for PubMedID 32471755\n\nAbstract\n\nHand surgeons can alleviate the burden associated with various congenital anomalies, burn sequelae, and trauma that debilitate individuals in low- and middle-income countries. Because few surgeons in these areas have the necessary resources to perform complex hand surgery, surgical trips provide essential surgical care. The authors aimed to determine the economic benefit of hand surgical trips to low- and middle-income countries to comprehensively determine the economic implications of hand surgery trips in low-resource settings.The authors collected data from two major global hand surgery organizations to analyze the economic benefit of hand surgery trips in low- and middle-income countries. The authors used both the human capital approach and the value of a statistical life-year approach to conduct this cost-benefit analysis. To demonstrate the economic gain, the authors subtracted the budgeted cost of each trip from the economic benefit.The authors analyzed a total of 15 trips to low- and middle-income countries. The costs of the trips ranged from $3453 to $87,434 (average, $24,869). The total cost for all the surgical trips was $373,040. The authors calculated a net economic benefit of $3,576,845 using the human capital approach and $8,650,745 using the value of a statistical life-year approach.The authors found a substantial return on investment using both the human capital approach and the value of a statistical life-year approach. In addition, the authors found that trips emphasizing education had a net economic benefit. Cost-benefit analyses have substantial financial implications and will aid policy makers in developing cost-reduction strategies to promote surgery in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/PRS.0000000000006470\n\nView details for PubMedID 31985644\n\nAbstract\n\nThe burden of hand surgery in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) is immense and growing. Although outreach trips to LMICs have been increasing, there has remained a gap regarding assessment of quality of care on outreach trips. We developed quality measures to assess hand surgery outreach trips to LMICs.We followed the recommendations set forth by the World Health Organization for practice guideline development. We used the results of a systematic review to inform the development of quality measures. Eight hand and upper-extremity surgeons with extensive global outreach experience (mean surgical outreach experience of >15 years, completed >3,000 surgeries in 24 countries) completed a modified RAND/UCLA (University of California Los Angeles) Delphi process to evaluate the importance, the feasibility, the usability, and the scientific acceptability of 83 measures. Validity was defined according to established methods.A tiering system that was based on the resources available at an outreach site (essential, intermediate, and advanced) was developed to classify the application of the measures since care delivery in LMICs often is constrained by local resources. Twenty-two (27%) of 83 measures were validated. All 22 (100%) were classified as essential (e.g., availability of interpretation services for the visiting team); no measures that were classified as intermediate or advanced were validated.Field-testing and implementation of quality measures served to identify the safety and the quality of hand surgical care that was provided on outreach trips to LMICs and inform improvement efforts. Tiers of care can be applied to quality measures to incorporate resource and capacity limitations when assessing their performance.Ensuring safety and high-quality care on hand surgical outreach trips to LMICs is foundational to all participating organizations and physicians. Valid quality measures can be implemented by organizations undertaking outreach trips to LMICs.\n\nView details for DOI 10.2106/JBJS.19.01506\n\nView details for PubMedID 33337798\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Accurate monitoring of free flap perfusion after complex reconstruction is critical for early recognition of flap compromise. Surgeons use a variety of subjective and objective measures to evaluate flap perfusion postoperatively. However, these measures have some limitations. We have developed a wireless, biodegradable, and flexible sensor that can be applied to real-time postoperative free flap monitoring. Here we assess the biocompatibility and function of our novel sensor.METHODS: Seven Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used for biocompatibility studies. The sensor was implanted around the femoral artery near the inguinal ligament on one leg (implant side) and sham surgery was performed on the contralateral leg (control side). At 6 and 12 weeks, samples were harvested to assess the inflammation within and around the implant and artery. Two animals were used to assess sensor function. Sensor function was evaluated at implantation and 7 days after the implantation. Signal changes after venous occlusion were also assessed in an epigastric artery island flap model.RESULTS: In biocompatibility studies, the diameter of the arterial lumen and intima thickness in the implant group were not significantly different than the control group at the 12-week time point. The number of CD-68 positive cells that infiltrated into the soft tissue, surrounding the femoral artery, was also not significantly different between groups at the 12-week time point. For sensor function, accurate signaling could be recorded at implantation and 7 days later. A change in arterial signal was noted immediately after venous occlusion in a flap model.CONCLUSION: The novel wireless, biodegradable sensor presented here is biocompatible and capable of detecting arterial blood flow and venous occlusion with high sensitivity. This promising new technology could combat the complications of wired sensors, while improving the survival rate of flaps with vessel compromise due to its responsive nature.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1055/s-0039-1700539\n\nView details for PubMedID 31675757\n\nAbstract\n\nPURPOSE: Conventional angiography is often used in the preoperative work-up of hand surgery patients with systemic sclerosis. The goal of this study was to propose a classification system based on the pattern of arterial involvement in a series of upper extremity angiograms. The authors hypothesized that this classification system would demonstrate high inter- and intrarater reliability.METHODS: A retrospective review of 110 upper extremity angiograms in patients with systemic sclerosis (obtained between 1996 and 2017) was performed. Images were classified into 4 types based on the patency of the radial and ulnar arteries at the wrist, and into 3 subtypes based on the patency of the superficial and deep palmar arches. Classification reliability was compared with Fleiss' Kappa (for inter-rater) and Cohen's (for intrarater) coefficient between 4 fellowship-trained hand surgeons and a hand fellow.RESULTS: The inter-rater reliability between all 5 observers using types alone was 0.83 (0.80-0.85), whereas the inter-rater reliability using subtypes was 0.64 (confidence interval [CI] 95%, 0.62-0.65). The intrarater reliability using types alone ranged from 0.80 to 0.95, whereas intrarater reliabilities using subtypes were 0.81 (CI 95%, 0.72-0.90), 0.78 (CI 95%, 0.69-0.87), 0.87 (CI 95%, 0.80-0.95), 0.64 (CI 95%, 0.53-0.75), and 0.92 (CI 95%, 0.86-0.98) for the 4 attendings and a hand fellow, respectively. Fifty-seven percent of angiograms were interpreted as having loss of ulnar artery patency at the wrist (type 2) with 77% having additional loss of superficial palmar arch patency (type 2A).CONCLUSIONS: This large series of angiograms in patients with systemic sclerosis demonstrates a classification system for conventional angiography that shows high inter-rater and intrarater reliability using type alone. When subtypes were used, the inter-rater and intrarater reliabilities decreased to moderate and moderate-to-high, respectively.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study represents the first step in establishing a classification system that, by grouping patients with similar angiogram findings, may allow for targeted research into risk stratification, monitoring, and treatment in systemic sclerosis.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30797658\n\nAbstract\n\nRotator cuff (RTC) repair outcomes are unsatisfactory due to the poor healing capacity of the tendon bone interface (TBI). In our preceding study, tendon hydrogel (tHG), which is a type I collagen rich gel derived from human tendons, improved biomechanical properties of the TBI in a rat chronic RTC injury model. Here we investigated whether adipose-derived stem cell (ASC)-seeded tHG injection at the repair site would further improve RTC healing. Rats underwent bilateral supraspinatus tendon detachment. Eight weeks later injured supraspinatus tendons were repaired with one of four treatments. In the control group, standard transosseous suture repair was performed. In the ASC, tHG, tHGASC groups, ASC in media, tHG, and ASC-seeded tHG were injected at repair site after transosseous suture repair, respectively. Eight weeks after repair, the TBI was evaluated biomechanically, histologically, and via micro CT. Implanted ASCs were detected in ASC and tHGASC groups 7 weeks after implantation. ACS implantation improved bone morphometry at the supraspinatus insertion on the humerus. Injection of tHG improved biomechanical properties of the repaired TBI. RTC healing in tHGASC group was significantly better than control but statistically equivalent to the tHG group based on biomechanical properties, fibrocartilage area at the TBI, and bone morphometry at the supraspinatus insertion. In a rat RTC chronic injury model, no biomechanical advantage was gained with ASC augmentation of tHG. Statement of Clinical Significance: Tendon hydrogel augmentation with adipose derived stem cells does not significantly improve TBI healing over tHG alone in a chronic rotator cuff injury model.

Previously, we demonstrated that an injectable, thermoresponsive, type I collagen-rich, decellularized human tendon-derived hydrogel (tHG) improved healing in an acute rat Achilles tendon injury model. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether tHG enhances the biomechanical properties of the regenerated TBI in a rat model of chronic RTC injury and repair.METHODS: Tendon hydrogel was prepared from chemically decellularized human cadaveric flexor tendons. Eight weeks after bilateral resection of supraspinatus tendons, repair of both shoulders was performed. One shoulder was treated with a transosseous suture (control group) and the other was treated with a transosseous suture plus tHG injection at the repair site (tHG group). Eight weeks after repair, the TBIs were evaluated biomechanically, histologically, and via micro-computed tomography (CT).RESULTS: Biomechanical testing revealed a larger load to failure, higher stiffness, higher energy to failure, larger strain at failure, and higher toughness in the tHG group versus control. The area of new cartilage formation was significantly larger in the tHG group. Micro-CT revealed no significant difference between groups in bone morphometry at the supraspinatus tendon insertion, although the tHG group was superior to the control.CONCLUSIONS: Injection of tHG at the RTC repair site enhanced biomechanical properties and increased fibrocartilage formation at the TBI in a chronic injury model.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Treatment of chronic RTC injuries with tHG at the time of surgical treatment may improve outcomes after surgical repair.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30685142\n\nAbstract\n\nAs the global burden of disease continues to rise, it becomes increasingly important to determine the sustainability of specialty surgery in the developing world. The authors aim to (1) evaluate the cost-effectiveness of plastic and reconstructive surgery in the developing world and (2) quantify the economic benefit.In this study, the authors performed a retrospective analysis of surgical trips performed by ReSurge International from 2014 to 2017. The organization gathered data on trip information, cost, and clinical characteristics. The authors measured the cost-effectiveness of the interventions using cost per disability-adjusted life-years and defined cost-effectiveness using World Health Organization Choosing Interventions That Are Cost-Effective thresholds. The authors also performed a cost-to-benefit analysis using the human capital approach.A total of 22 surgical trips from eight different developing countries were included in this study. The authors analyzed a total of 756 surgical interventions. The cost-effectiveness of the surgical trips ranged from $52 to $11,410 per disability-adjusted life-year averted. The economic benefit for the 22 surgical trips was $9,795,384. According to World Health Organization Choosing Interventions That Are Cost-Effective thresholds, 21 of the surgical trips were considered very cost-effective or cost-effective.Plastic and reconstructive operations performed during short-term surgical trips performed by this organization are economically sustainable. High-volume trips and those treating complex surgical conditions prove to be the most cost-effective. To continue to receive monetary funding, providing fiscally sustainable surgical care to low- and middle-income countries is imperative.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/PRS.0000000000005984\n\nView details for PubMedID 31461047\n\nAbstract\n\nPURPOSE: Hand surgery outreach programs to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) provide much-needed surgical care to the underserved populations and education to local providers for improved care. The cost-effectiveness of these surgical trips has not been studied despite a long history of such efforts. This study aimed to examine the economic impact of hand surgery trips to LMICs using data from the Touching Hands Project and ReSurge International. We hypothesized that hand surgery outreach would be cost-effective in LMICs.METHODS: We analyzed data on the cost of each trip and the surgical procedures performed. Using methods from the World Health Organization (WHO-Choosing Interventions That Are Cost-Effective [WHO-CHOICE]), we determined whether the procedures performed during the outreach trips would be cost-effective.RESULTS: For the 14 hand surgery trips, 378 patients received surgical treatment. Trips varied in the country where interventions were provided, the number of patients served, the severity of the conditions, and the total cost. The cost per disability-adjusted life-year averted ranged from United States (US)$222 to $1,525, all of which were very cost-effective according to WHO-CHOICE thresholds. The cost-effectiveness of global hand surgery was comparable to that of other medical interventions such as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment in similar regions. We also identified a lack of standardized record keeping for these surgical trips.CONCLUSIONS: Hand surgeries performed in LMICs are cost-effective based on WHO-CHOICE criteria. However, a standardized record-keeping method is needed for future research and longitudinal comparison. Understanding the economic impact of hand surgery global outreach is important to the success and sustainability of these efforts, both to allocate resources effectively and to identify areas for improvement.TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic/Decision Analysis III.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30579691\n\nAbstract\n\nA paradigm shift is underway in the world of humanitarian global surgery to address the large unmet need for reconstructive surgical services in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Here, we discuss the ReSurge Global Training Program (RGTP), a model for surgical training and capacity building in reconstructive surgery in the developing world. The program includes an online reconstructive surgery curriculum, visiting educator trips, expert reconstructive surgeon involvement, trainee competency tracking system, and identification of local outreach partners to provide safe reconstructive surgery to the neediest of patients in the developing world.A retrospective review of the components of the RGTP from July 2014 through June 2017 was performed. Trainee milestones scores were analyzed to observe trends toward competency in specific plastic surgery skill sets.There were a total of 38 visiting educator trips during the study period. The trips took place in 10 LMICs. A total of 149 trainees were evaluated in the context of the visiting educator trips with 377 distinct submodule evaluations. Four trainees had more than 10 submodule evaluations over 2 or more visiting educator trips. There was notable improvement in milestones ratings over time among the trainees in this program.The RGTP is a model of reconstructive surgical training and capacity building in LMICs. Trainees develop important skill sets in reconstructive surgery as a result of their involvement in the program. This comprehensive training approach addresses the disparity in access to care in the developing world by providing short- and long-term solutions to unmet reconstructive needs.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001513\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000442239900003\n\nView details for PubMedID 29905604\n\nAbstract\n\nIn Nepal, burn trauma causes more than 55,000 injuries each year. Burn-related mortality is high in Nepal, in part due to lack of allograft, leading to high infection rates. To address this challenge, our collaboration between Kirtipur Hospital, America Nepal Medical Foundation, Stanford University, and ReSurge International established Nepal's first skin bank.We identified 3 major tasks to create a sustainable skin banking program: 1) identify and acquire the equipment and personnel needed to collect, process, store, and graft cadaveric skin for burn injuries; 2) develop safe donation protocols and documentation tools that remain feasible for low-resource settings; and 3) develop a long-term awareness program to educate the Nepali people on skin donation, a previously foreign concept.Kirtipur Hospital acquired the necessary equipment and materials for the skin bank through a combination of local and international fundraising efforts. Existing U.S. skin banking protocols were adapted for the Nepali setting and piloted on potential patients, donors, and physicians. For the first time in the hospital's history, patients with > 40% total body surface area burns were successfully treated with extensive allografts.It is feasible to create a skin bank in a country with no tradition of allograft skin use. Long-term sustainability now depends on spreading awareness and education in the Kathmandu Valley to overcome religious and cultural barriers that have hindered donor recruitment. Our low-cost and high-impact skin bank provides a model to expand this system to other hospitals both within Nepal and beyond.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/GOX.0000000000001510\n\nView details for PubMedID 29263946\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5732652\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: Suboptimal healing of the tendon bone interface (TBI) remains an unsolved problem. One solution is a biocompatible tissue engineered construct that promotes augmented healing. We hypothesisze that 1.) the presence of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) and prolonged in vitro incubation produces tissue engineered tendon bone interface scaffolds with greater reseeding of viable Adipo-derived Stem Cells (ADSC) and 2.) when implanted with extracellular matrix hydrogel, constructs will display superior in vivo strength repair and biocompatibility.MATERIALS AND METHODS: 1. Achilles-calcaneal composite TBI scaffold grafts were harvested from thirty Wistar rats. After physicochemical decellularization and lyophilization, paired scaffolds were revitalized in either rat plasma or 100% activated rat PRP and reseeded with 1x10ADSCs/mL for 3, 7 and 14 days. Reseeding efficacy was quantified by live cell and total cell assays and qualified histologically. Statistical analysis of live cell and total cell assay data was performed using a paired Students t-test. 2. Ninety Sprague Dawley rats underwent Wistar tissue engineered TBI scaffold allograft reconstruction with one of five scaffold revitalization/reseeding conditions: (1) Decellularized, lyophilized, phosphate buffered saline , (2) Decellularized, Lyophilized, 100% activated PRP, (3) Decellularized, lyophilized, 100% activated PRP and extracellular matrix hydrogel, (4) Decellularized, lyophilized, 100% activated PRP and 14 day reseeding with ASC-luc2-eGFP cells and (5) Decellularized, lyophilized, 100% activated PRP, 14 day reseeding with ADSC-luc2-eGFP cells and extracellular matrix hydrogel. Daily, real-time in vivo bioluminescence imaging of all rats containing reseeded grafts was performed to follow cell viability. Subjects were sacrificed at weeks 2, 4, and 8 and constructs underwent biomechanical and histological evaluation. Comparisons across groups for biomechanical testing data was performed by one- way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significance was set at p<0.05.RESULTS: 1. PRP revitalized grafts demonstrated greater live ADSC loads at 3 (p< 0.01), 7 (p< 0.001) and 14 days (p< 0.001), total ADSC loads at 7 (p< 0.001) and 14 days (p<0.001) with visibly greater live surface cellularity, layering, migration and penetration on histology. 2. Real-time in vivo bioluminescence imaging confirmed cell viability to day 22 post-implantation. Biomechanical strength testing demonstrated a significant increase in Ultimate failure load for reseeded groups compared to all other groups at week 2 (p<0.001), whereas only reseeded grafts supplemented with hydrogel remained significantly stronger compared to all other groups at weeks 4 (p<0.001) and 8 (p<0.01). Histology demonstrated most increased tendinous cellular invasion and fibrocartilage repopulation at 8 weeks in the reseeded group supplemented with hydrogel. Massons Trichrome staining demonstrated persistence of the scaffold structure at week 8 and blinded Image J analysis of Picosirius red staining specimens demonstrated significantly more Type III collagen in the ADSC reseeded hydrogel group at 2 (p< 0.01), 4 (p< 0.01) and 8 weeks (p< 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Decellularized lyophilized allogeneic tendon-bone interface scaffolds can be optimized by revitalization in PRP, reseeding with ADSCs and supplemented by an extracellular matrix tendon hydrogel at the time of implantation. When done so, they display greater repair strength and biocompatibility.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28806294\n\nAbstract\n\nDecellularized cadaveric tendons are a potential source for reconstruction. Reseeding to enhance healing is ideal; however, cells placed on the tendon surface result in inadequate delivery. The authors used an injection technique to evaluate intratendinous cell delivery.Decellularized tendons were reseeded with adipose-derived stem cells in culture, and injected with fetal bovine serum or hydrogel. PKH26-stained cells in cross-section were quantified. To evaluate cell viability, the authors delivered luciferase-labeled cells and performed bioluminescent imaging. To evaluate synthetic ability, the authors performed immunohistochemistry of procollagen. Adipose-derived stem cells' ability to attract tenocytes was assessed using transwell inserts. Cell-to-cell interaction was assessed by co-culturing, measuring proliferation and collagen production, and quantifying synergy. Finally, tensile strength was tested.Both fetal bovine serum (p < 0.001) and hydrogel (p < 0.001) injection led to more cells inside the tendon compared with culturing. Hydrogel injection initially demonstrated greater bioluminescence than culturing (p < 0.005) and fetal bovine serum injection (p < 0.05). Injection groups demonstrated intratendinous procollagen staining correlating with the cells' location. Co-culture led to greater tenocyte migration (p < 0.05). Interaction index of proliferation and collagen production assays were greater than 1 for all co-culture ratios, demonstrating synergistic proliferation and collagen production compared with controls (p < 0.05). There were no differences in tensile strength.Hydrogel injection demonstrated the greatest intratendinous seeding efficiency and consistency, without compromising tensile strength. Intratendinous cells demonstrated synthetic capabilities and can potentially attract tenocytes inside the tendon, where synergy would promote intrinsic tendon healing.Therapeutic, V.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/PRS.0000000000003359\n\nView details for PubMedID 28538572\n\nAbstract\n\nThe importance of flexor tendon repair with both core and epitendinous suture placement has been well established. The objective of this study was to determine whether suture placement order affects gliding resistance and bunching in flexor digitorum profundus tendons in a human ex vivo model.The flexor digitorum profundus tendons of the index, middle, ring, and little fingers of paired cadaver forearms were tested intact for excursion and mean gliding resistance in flexion and extension across the A2 pulley. Tendons were subsequently transected and repaired with either an epitendinous-first (n = 12) or a control (n = 12) repair. Gliding resistance of pair-matched tendons were analyzed at cycle 1 and during the steady state of tendon motion. The tendon repair breaking strength was also measured.The mean steady state gliding resistance was less for the epitendinous-first repair than for the control repair in flexion (0.61 N vs 0.72 N) and significantly less in extension (0.68 N vs 0.85 N). Similar results were seen for cycle 1. None of the repairs demonstrated gap formation; however, control repairs exhibited increased bunching. Load to failure was similar for both groups.The order of suture placement for flexor tendon repair is important. Epitendinous-first repair significantly decreased mean gliding resistance, allowed for easier placement of core sutures, and resulted in decreased bunching.Epitendinous-first flexor tendon repairs may contribute to improved clinical outcomes compared with control repairs by decreasing gliding resistance and bunching.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jhsa.2017.04.013\n\nView details for PubMedID 28501340\n\nAbstract\n\nAdipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are a potential candidate for cell-based therapy targeting tendon injury; however, their therapeutic benefit relies on their ability to interact with native tenocytes. This study examines the mechanism and effects of coculturing human tenocytes and ASCs.Tenocytes (T) were directly cocultured with either ASCs (A) or fibroblasts (F) (negative control) in the following ratios: 50% T/50% A or F; 25% T/75% A or F; and 75% T/25% A or F. Cells were indirectly cocultured using a transwell insert that allowed for exchange of soluble factors only. Proliferation and collagen I production were measured and compared with monoculture controls. Synergy was quantified using the interaction index (II), which normalizes measured values by the expected values assuming no interaction (no synergy when II = 1). The ability of ASCs to elicit tenocyte migration was examined in vitro using a transwell migration assay and ex vivo using decellularized human flexor tendon explants.Compared with monoculture controls, II of proliferation was greater than 1 for all tenocyte and ASC direct coculture ratios, but not for tenocyte and fibroblast direct coculture ratios or for tenocyte and ASC indirect coculture. The ASCs elicited greater tenocyte migration in vitro and ex vivo. The II of collagen I production was greater than 1 for direct coculture groups with 25% T/75% A and 75% T/25% A.Direct coculture of ASCs and tenocytes demonstrated synergistic proliferation and collagen I production, and ASCs elicited tenocyte migration in vitro and ex vivo. These interactions play a key role in tendon healing and were absent when ASCs were replaced with fibroblasts, supporting the use of ASCs for cell-based therapy targeting tendon injuries.When ASCs are delivered for cell-based therapy, they directly interact with native tenocytes to increase cell proliferation, collagen I production, and tenocyte migration, which may enhance tendon healing.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28888566\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Tendon-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogel has been shown to augment tendon healing in vivo. We hypothesized that reseeding of the gel with adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) could further assist repopulation of the gel and that combinations of growth factors (GFs) would improve the survival of these cells after reseeding. Methods: A tendon-specific ECM solution was supplemented with varying concentrations of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB). Gels were then seeded with ASCs transfected with a green fluorescent protein/luciferin construct. Cell proliferation was determined using the MTT assay and histology, and GF and ASC augmented gels were injected into the back of Sprague Dawley rats. Bioluminescence of seeded gels was continuously followed after reseeding, and cell counts were performed after the gels were explanted at 14 days. Results: Synergistic effects of the GFs were seen, and an optimal combination was determined to be 10 ng/mL bFGF, 100 ng/mL IGF-1, and 100 ng/mL PDGF-BB (2.8-fold increase; P < .05). In vivo bioluminescence showed an improved initial survival of cells in gels supplemented with the optimal concentration of GF compared with the control group (10.6-fold increase at 8 days; P < .05). Cell counts of explants showed a dramatic endogenous repopulation of gels supplemented by GF + ASCs compared with both gels with GF but no ASCs (7.6-fold increase) and gels with ASCs but no GF (1.6-fold increase). Conclusion: Synergistic effects of GFs can be used to improve cellular proliferation of ASCs seeded to a tendon ECM gel. Reseeding with ASCs stimulates endogenous repopulation of the gel in vivo and may be used to further augment tendon healing.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/1558944715628005\n\nView details for PubMedID 28082847\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5207276\n\nAbstract\n\nSurgical site infections (SSIs) affect the safety of surgical care and are particularly problematic and prevalent in low and middle Human Development Index Countries (LMHDICs).We performed a systematic review of the existing literature on SSIs after tissue flap procedures in LMHDICs through the PubMed, Ovid, and Web of Science databases. Of the 405 abstracts identified, 79 were selected for full text review, and 30 studies met inclusion criteria for analysis.In the pooled analysis, the SSI rate was 5.8 infections per 100 flap procedures (95% confidence interval [CI] 2%-10%, range: 0-40%). The most common indication for tissue flap was pilonidal sinus repair, which had a pooled SSI rate of 5.6 infections per 100 flap procedures (95% CI 2%-10%, range: 0-15%). No fatalities from an infection were noted. The reporting of infection epidemiology, prevention, and treatment was poor, with few studies reporting antibiotic agent use (37%), responsible pathogens (13%), infection comorbidities (13%), or time to infection (7%); none reported cost.Our review highlights the need for more work to develop standardized hospital-based reporting for surgical outcomes and complications, as well as future studies by large, multi-national groups to establish baseline incidence rates for SSIs and best practice guidelines to monitor SSI rates.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28915094\n\nAbstract\n\nBurn scar contractures remain a common source of severe disability in resource-limited countries. However, existing outcome measurements are unable to fully capture the impact of the scar contracture and surgical attempts at correction. To that end, we have developed a new outcome instrument, the Stanford-ReSurge Burn Scar Contracture Scale-Upper Extremity that can be used as a measurement of disability and reconstructive procedure outcomes. The outcome instrument was created through item generation, item reduction, and preliminary field testing. We performed a literature review using multiple databases to gather a comprehensive list of existing burn contracture metrics, removed metrics that were inapplicable in resource-limited settings, and submitted remaining items to plastic and hand surgeons for evaluation of clinical and cultural relevance, comprehensiveness, and feasibility. The remaining items were field tested to evaluate patient comprehension and ability to detect change over 1 month. A literature review found 32 unique scales that were eventually reduced to a pool of 38 potential items that were field tested with patients. Patient feedback further reduced the item pool to the final 20-item scale. Patients who underwent burn scar contracture release of the upper extremity showed an average of 14 points improvement between the preoperative and 1-month postoperative time point. The Stanford-ReSurge Burn Scar Contracture showed clinical utility for assessing outcomes in burn scar contracture release of the upper extremity. Our goal is to develop a standardized outcome instrument for burn reconstruction in the world's poorest burn patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/BCR.0000000000000403\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000391867500049\n\nView details for PubMedID 27532614\n\nAbstract\n\nTelemedicine in outpatient burn care, particularly in burn scar management, may provide cost-effective care and comes highly rated by patients. However, an effective scar scale using both video and photographic elements has not been validated. The purpose of this study is to test the reliability of the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) using live video-conferencing.A prospective study was conducted with individuals with healed burn scars in Kathmandu, Nepal. Three independent observers assessed 85 burn scars from 17 subjects, using the Observer portion to evaluate vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, relief, pliability, surface area, and overall opinion. The on-site observer was physically present with the subjects and used a live videoconferencing application to show the scars to two remote observers in the United States. Subjects used the Patient portion to evaluate the scar that they believed appeared the worst appearance and had the greatest impact on function.The single-rater reliability of the Observer scale was acceptable (ICC>0.70) in overall opinion, thickness, pliability, and surface area. The average-rater reliability for three observers was acceptable (ICC>0.70) for all parameters except for vascularity. When comparing Patients' and Observers' overall opinion scores, patients consistently reported worse opinion.Evaluation of burn scars using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale can be accurately performed via live videoconferencing and presents an opportunity to expand access to burn care to rural communities, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where patients face significant access barriers to appropriate follow-up care.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.burns.2016.11.006\n\nView details for PubMedID 27931764\n\nAbstract\n\nBurn contractures can cause significant disability, particularly in patients in resource-limited settings. However, a gap exists in our ability to measure outcomes in patients with burn contractures of the neck. The objective of this study was to develop and validate the Stanford-ReSurge Burn Scar Contracture Scale-Neck to longitudinally assess functional status and measure functional improvement following contracture release of the neck.A literature review was performed to identify scales used in neck assessment and burn assessment. Items were then removed from the pool based on redundancy, feasibility, cultural appropriateness, and applicability to patients in international resource-limited environments. Remaining items were administered to patients with burn contracture of the neck.The initial literature review found 33 scales that were combined to create an initial pool of 714 items, which was first reduced to 40 items. Feedback from field testing then yielded a 20-item outcome tool to assess appearance, activities of daily living, somatosensation, satisfaction, and range of motion, with a floor of 20 and a ceiling score of 100 points. Preliminary testing with 10 patients showed an average preoperative score of 58 points and an average 1-month postoperative score of 42 points.The authors have created an outcome tool for measuring functional status following burn contracture release of the neck, which can easily be implemented in resource-limited settings where the burden of burn injuries and morbidities is disproportionately high. Ongoing work includes a multicountry study to evaluate validity and reliability.\n\nView details for PubMedID 27783006\n\nAbstract\n\nTendon hydrogel is a promising biomaterial for improving repair strength after tendon injury. This study compares the capacity of fibroblasts and adipose-derived stem cells to proliferate, survive, and acquire tenogenic properties when seeded into tendon hydrogel in vitro and in vivo.The effect of cell density on hydrogel contraction was measured macroscopically. To assess tenogenic properties, RNA was isolated from cells seeded in vitro in hydrogel, and tenocyte markers were quantified. To assess in vitro proliferation and survival, MTS and live-dead assays were performed. Finally, to assess the in vivo survival of cells in hydrogel, subcutaneous injections were performed on rats and in vivo imaging was performed.At 0.5 million cells/ml, both the fibroblasts and adipose-derived stem cells induced minimal hydrogel contraction compared with higher cellular concentrations. Fibroblasts and adipose-derived stem cells seeded at 0.5 million cells/ml in tendon hydrogel up-regulated several tenocyte markers after 1 week. On MTS assay, fibroblasts and adipose-derived stem cells proliferated in hydrogel at similar rates. On live-dead assay, fibroblasts survived longer than adipose-derived stem cells. With use of the in vivo imaging system and histologic evaluation, fibroblasts survived longer than adipose-derived stem cells in hydrogel in vivo.Tendon healing is mediated by the proliferation, survival, and tenogenic differentiation of cells at the site of injury. Tendon hydrogel delivering dermal fibroblasts may improve and stimulate this process compared with adipose-derived stem cells. Future studies will be needed to evaluate the effects of this hydrogel-based cell delivery on chronic tendon injuries.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/PRS.0000000000002515\n\nView details for PubMedID 27140055\n\nAbstract\n\nPrevious work has characterized the development of a human tendon hydrogel capable of improving mechanical strength after tendon injury. Animal tendon hydrogel has not yet been described, but would prove beneficial due to the cost and ethical concerns associated with the use of human cadaveric tendon. This study details the manufacture and assesses the biocompatibility of porcine tendon hydrogel seeded with human adipoderived stem cells (ASCs).Porcine tendon was dissected from surrounding connective and muscle tissue and decellularized via 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid wash solutions before lyophilization. Tendon was milled and reconstituted by previously described methods. Decellularization was confirmed by hematoxylin-eosin staining, SYTO Green 11 nucleic acid dye, and DNeasy assay. The protein composition of milled tendon matrix before and after digestion was identified by mass spectrometry. Rheological properties were determined using an ARG2 rheometer. Biocompatibility was assessed by live/dead assay. The proliferation of human ASCs seeded in porcine and human hydrogel was measured by MTS assay. All experimental conditions were performed in triplicate.Decellularization of porcine tendon was successful. Mass spectrometry showed that collagen composes one third of milled porcine tendon before and after pepsin digestion. Rheology demonstrated that porcine hydrogel maintains a fluid consistency over a range of temperatures, unlike human hydrogel, which tends to solidify. Live/dead staining revealed that human ASCs survive in hydrogel 7 days after seeding and retain spindle-like morphology. MTS assay at day 3 and day 5 showed that human ASC proliferation was marginally greater in human hydrogel.After reconstitution and digestion, porcine hydrogel was capable of supporting growth of human ASCs. The minimal difference in proliferative capacity suggests that porcine tendon hydrogel may be an effective and viable alternative to human hydrogel for the enhancement of tendon healing.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/SAP.0000000000000361\n\nView details for PubMedID 25305229\n\nAbstract\n\nThe authors have developed a tendon hydrogel that may be injected into the site of tendon injury to improve speed and strength of repair. The aim of this study was to compare the biological and physical properties of fresh, hydrated tendon hydrogel with its reconstituted lyophilized counterpart with the goal of increasing clinical feasibility.Hydrogel was prepared from fresh human cadaveric flexor tendon. Fresh gel was compared to gel aliquots that were lyophilized and reconstituted with sterile deionized water. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the microarchitecture of gelated samples. Rat adipose-derived stem cells were seeded in hydrogel, and cell viability was assessed after 7 days. MTS colorimetric assay was used to evaluate both the effect of prolonged storage on gel and the ability of reconstituted lyophilized hydrogel to activate platelet-rich plasma. The viability and proliferation of luciferase-transfected adipose-derived stem cells embedded within hydrogel in vivo was assessed by a bioluminescence in vivo imaging system.Reconstituted lyophilized hydrogel demonstrated similar handling properties compared to fresh gel. Adipose-derived stem cells remained viable 7 days after reseeding in both conditions. Lyophilized hydrogel retained its ability to activate platelet-rich plasma and retained 95 percent of its maximal proliferative capacity at 30 days. The in vivo imaging system demonstrated similar cell proliferation, with signal persisting through day 13.Reconstitution of lyophilized hydrogel stimulated cell proliferation and platelet-rich plasma activation to a greater degree than did fresh hydrogel. Efficacy after prolonged storage was also shown to be superior. Therefore, this lyophilized formulation of tendon hydrogel may have wider clinical applicability.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/01.prs.0000480012.41411.7c\n\nView details for PubMedID 26910664\n\nAbstract\n\nPeriarterial sympathectomy is a treatment option for patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) suffering from digital vasculopathy. Despite potential benefits of ulcer healing, pain improvement, and amputation prevention, this operation appears to be infrequently performed. The aims of our study are as follows: (1) to assess national digital sympathectomy rates in patients with SSc and (2) to improve our understanding of referring physicians' perceptions of operative management and access to hand surgeons. Our hypothesis is that rheumatologists' practices largely influence their referral patterns for digital sympathectomy.To determine the rates and demographics of hospitalized patients with SSc who had undergone digital sympathectomy, we queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2006 to 2010. Additionally, we mailed a self-administered survey to a national sample of 500 board-certified rheumatologists to elicit their practice patterns and perceptions of digital sympathectomy. Using logistic regression, we analyzed potential predictor variables associated with rheumatologists performing the following: (1) routinely counseling patients about digital sympathectomy and (2) expressing the desire to refer these patients for operative evaluation.Of 348,539 hospitalizations associated with a diagnosis of SSc, only 0.2% were for digital sympathectomy. Our questionnaire revealed that only 50% of rheumatologists routinely counseled, whereas 67% expressed the desire to refer. Factors associated with increased rheumatologists' interest in surgical management for patients with SSc included positive perception of the operation's efficacy, comfort with postoperative management, and interdisciplinary relationship with a hand surgeon.Critical components to increasing appropriate utilization of digital sympathectomy include enhancing rheumatologists' understanding of the operation, comfort with postoperative management, and promoting strong, interdisciplinary relationships with hand surgeons. Increasing education and awareness, as well as establishing a solid referral network of hand surgeons may thereby improve patient access to digital sympathectomy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/SAP.0000000000000614\n\nView details for PubMedID 26418780\n\nAbstract\n\nSystemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare connective tissue disease associated with significant digital vasculopathy. Peripheral sympathectomy is frequently offered late in the disease process after severe digital ischemia has already occurred with patients being symptomatic for numerous years. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the results of peripheral sympathectomy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SSc.A retrospective analysis of 17 patients (26 hands) who underwent peripheral sympathectomy between January 2003 and September 2013 was performed. Data regarding patient demographics, clinical features, and postoperative outcomes were retrieved. Of note, preoperative pain was present in all patients with a mean duration of 9.6 years prior to peripheral sympathectomy.Pain improvement/resolution was seen in 24 hands (92.3%). Digital ulcers healed in all patients with only two patients (two hands; 7.7%) requiring surgical intervention for ulcer recurrence 6 months and 4.5 years later. Minor complications were seen in seven hands (26.9%); including infection, wound opening, and stitch abscess, but none required surgical intervention. Seven of eight patients queried would have preferred surgical treatment at an earlier point in the disease process.Peripheral sympathectomy is a well-tolerated procedure in patients with SSc and is associated with predictable pain relief and ulcer healing in the majority of patients. In light of these findings it seems prudent to offer surgical treatment not as a last resort but rather earlier in the disease process to decrease the duration that patients suffer pain. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study assesses the capacity of platelet-rich plasma to stimulate proliferation and migration of rat adipose-derived stem cells in tendon hydrogel in vitro.To assess proliferation, adipose-derived stem cells were exposed to plasma, plasma supplemented with growth factors, or platelet-rich plasma in culture medium and tendon hydrogel. To assess migration, adipose-derived stem cells were plated onto tendon hydrogel -coated wells and covered with medium containing plasma, plasma supplemented with growth factors, platelet-rich plasma, or bovine serum albumin. Migration from cell-seeded to cell-free zones was assessed at 12-hour intervals.Platelet-rich plasma augmented proliferation to a greater extent compared with plasma and plasma supplemented with growth factors (10%: optical density, 1.18 versus 0.75 versus 0.98, respectively). Platelet-rich plasma was superior to plasma in tendon hydrogel (10%: optical density, 1.19 versus 0.85) but did not augment proliferation to the extent that plasma supplemented with growth factors did (10%: optical density, 1.19 versus 1.56). Platelet-rich plasma enhanced the migration of adipose-derived stem cells compared with serum-free medium (bovine serum albumin) (36 hours: platelet-rich plasma, 1.88; plasma, 1.51; plasma plus growth factor, 1.80; bovine serum albumin, 1.43).Tendon healing is mediated by migration of cells to the injured area and cellular proliferation at that site. Tendon hydrogel supplemented with platelet-rich plasma stimulates these processes. Future studies will evaluate this combination's ability to stimulate healing in chronic tendon injuries in vivo.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/PRS.0000000000001268\n\nView details for PubMedID 26017614\n\nAbstract\n\nAcute and chronic tendon injuries would benefit from stronger and more expeditious healing. We hypothesize that supplementation of a biocompatible tendon hydrogel with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) would augment the tendon healing process.Using 55 Wistar rats, a full-thickness defect was created within the midsubstance of each Achilles tendon with the addition of one of five experimental conditions: (i) saline control (50-μL), (ii) tendon hydrogel (50-μL), (iii) tendon hydrogel (45-μL)+PRP (5-μL), (iv) tendon hydrogel (45-μL)+2×10(6)-ASCs/mL in phosphate buffered saline (5-μL), and (v) tendon hydrogel (45-μL)+2×10(6)-ASCs/mL in PRP (5-μL). Hydrogel was developed from decellularized, human cadaveric tendons. Fresh rat PRP was obtained per Amable et al.'s technique, and green fluorescent protein/luciferase-positive rat ASCs were utilized. Rats were sacrificed at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8 after injury. Real-time in vivo bioluminescence imaging of groups with ASCs was performed. Upon sacrifice, Achilles tendons underwent biomechanical and histological evaluation. Comparisons across groups were analyzed using the two-sample Z-test for proportions and the Student's t-test for independent samples. Significance was set at p<0.05.(i) Bioluminescence imaging demonstrated that total photon flux was significantly increased for hydrogel+PRP+ASCs, versus hydrogel+ASCs for each postoperative day imaged (p<0.03). (ii) Mean ultimate failure load (UFL) was increased for hydrogel augmented with PRP and/or ASCs versus hydrogel alone at week 2 (p<0.03). By week 4, hydrogel alone reached a similar mean UFL to hydrogel augmented with PRP and/or ASCs (p>0.3). However, at week 8, hydrogel with PRP and ASCs demonstrated increased strength over other groups (p<0.05), except for hydrogel with PRP (p=0.25). (iii) Upon histological analysis, Hematoxylin and Eosin staining showed increased extracellular matrix formation in groups containing PRP and increased cellularity in groups containing ASCs. Groups containing both PRP and ASCs demonstrated both of these characteristics.PRP and ASCs are easily accessible bioactive products that have potentiating effects on tendon hydrogel. Augmentation with these two factors encourages earlier mechanical strength and functional restoration. Thus, biochemically, tendon hydrogel augmented with PRP and/or ASCs, serves as a promising therapeutic modality for augmenting the tendon healing process after injury.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1089/ten.tea.2014.0490\n\nView details for PubMedID 25625433\n\nAbstract\n\nUsing a through-the-needle local anesthetic bolus technique, ultrasound-guided infraclavicular perineural catheters have been shown to provide greater analgesia compared to supraclavicular catheters. A through-the-catheter bolus technique, which arguably \"tests\" the anesthetic efficacy of the catheter before initiating an infusion, has been validated for infraclavicular catheters but not supraclavicular catheters. This study investigated the through-the-catheter bolus technique for supraclavicular catheters and tested the hypothesis that infraclavicular catheters provide faster onset of brachial plexus anesthesia.Preoperatively, patients were randomly assigned to receive either a supraclavicular or an infraclavicular catheter using an ultrasound-guided nonstimulating catheter insertion technique with a mepivacaine bolus via the catheter and ropivacaine perineural infusion initiated postoperatively. The primary outcome was time to achieve complete sensory anesthesia in the ulnar and median nerve distributions. Secondary outcomes included procedural time, procedure-related pain and complications, and postoperative pain, opioid consumption, sleep disturbances, and motor weakness.Fifty patients were enrolled in the study; all but 2 perineural catheters were successfully placed per protocol. Twenty-one of 24 (88%) and 24 of 24 (100%) patients in the supraclavicular and infraclavicular groups, respectively, achieved complete sensory anesthesia by 30 minutes (P= .088). There was no difference in the time to achieve complete sensory anesthesia. Supraclavicular patients reported more sleep disturbances postoperatively, but there were no statistically significant differences in other outcomes.Both supraclavicular and infraclavicular perineural catheters using a through-the-catheter bolus technique provide effective brachial plexus anesthesia.\n\nView details for DOI 10.7863/ultra.34.2.333\n\nView details for PubMedID 25614407\n\nAbstract\n\nThe ability to use the anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap as a vascularized fascial flap, without skin or muscle, was first documented by Koshima et al in 1989.

Despite its description more than 20 years ago, little literature exists on the application of the ALT flap as a vascularized fascial flap. In our experience, the ALT flap can be used as a fascia-only flap for thin, pliable coverage in extremity reconstruction.After approval from the institutional review board, the medical records and photographs of patients who had undergone fascia-only ALT free flaps for extremity reconstruction were reviewed. Photographic images of patients were then matched to patients who had undergone either a muscle-only or a fasciocutaneous free flap reconstruction of an extremity. Photographs of the final reconstruction were then given to medical and nonmedical personnel for analysis, focusing on aesthetics including color and contour.Review of cases performed over a 2-year period demonstrated similar ease of harvest for fascia-only ALT flaps compared to standard fasciocutaneous ALT flaps. Fascia-only flaps were used for thin, pliable coverage in the upper and lower extremities. There was no need for secondary procedures for debulking or aesthetic flap revision. In contrast to muscle flaps, which require muscle atrophy over time to achieve their final appearance, there was a similar flap contour from approximately 1 month postoperatively throughout the duration of follow-up. When a large flap is required, the fascia-only ALT has the advantage of a single-line donor-site scar. Photograph comparison to muscle flaps with skin grafts and fasciocutaneous flaps demonstrated improved color, contour, and overall aesthetic appearance of the fascia-only ALT over muscle and fasciocutaneous flaps.The fascia-only ALT flap provides reliable, thin, and pliable coverage with improved contour and color over muscle and fasciocutaneous flaps.

In this study, we report an objective means for expert evaluators to reliably rate trainees' technical skills under the microscope, with the use of our novel global rating scale.\"Microsurgery Essentials\" (http://smartmicrosurgery.com) is our on-line training curriculum. Residents were randomly divided into 2 groups: 1 group reviewed this online resource and the other did not. Pre- and post-tests consisted of videotaped microsurgical sessions in which the trainee performed \"microsurgery\" on 3 different models: latex glove, penrose drain, and the dorsal vessel of a chicken foot. The SMaRT (Stanford Microsurgery and Resident Training) scale, consisting of 9 categories graded on a 5-point Likert scale, was used to assess the trainees. Results were analyzed with ANOVA and Student t test, with P less than 0.05 indicating statistical significance.Seventeen residents participated in the study. The SMaRT scale adequately differentiated the performance of more experienced senior residents (PGY-4 to PGY-6, total average score = 3.43) from less experienced junior residents (PGY-1 to PGY-3, total average score = 2.10, P < 0.0001). Residents who viewed themselves as being confident received a higher score on the SMaRT scale (average score 3.5), compared to residents who were not as confident (average score 2.1) (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in scoring among all 3 evaluators (P > 0.05). Additionally, junior residents who had access to our website showed a significant increase in their graded technical performance by 0.7 points when compared to residents who did not have access to the website who showed an improvement of only 0.2 points (P = 0.01).Our SMaRT scale is valid and reliable in assessing the microsurgical skills of residents and other trainees. Current trainees are more likely to use self-directed on-line education because of its easy accessibility and interactive format. Our global rating scale can help ensure residents are achieving appropriate technical milestones.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/SAP.0000000000000139\n\nView details for PubMedID 24691332\n\nAbstract\n\nMany unsolved problems in plastic and hand surgery are related to poor healing of acute and chronic tendon injuries. The authors hypothesized that tendon healing could be augmented by the addition of a tendon-derived, extracellular matrix hydrogel that would guide tissue regeneration.Both Achilles tendons of 36 Wistar rats were given full-thickness injuries approximately 5 mm long and 0.5 mm wide from the tendon insertion at the calcaneus to the midsubstance. The hydrogel was injected into the injury site of one leg and compared with control saline in the other. The ultimate failure load, ultimate tensile stress, and stiffness were evaluated at 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Tendon cross-sections underwent histologic analysis (hematoxylin and eosin and picrosirius red) after the animals were killed. Statistical analysis of biomechanical data was performed using a paired t test.There was no significant difference in strength between gel and saline injections in ultimate failure load (p = 0.15), ultimate tensile stress (p = 0.42), or stiffness (p = 0.76) at 2 weeks. However, there was a significant difference in ultimate failure load (74.8 ± 11.6 N versus 58.4 ± 14.2 N; p = 0.02) at 4 weeks. The difference in ultimate tensile stress (p = 0.63) and stiffness (p = 0.08) remained insignificant. By 8 weeks, there was no significant difference in strength in ultimate failure load (p = 0.15), ultimate tensile stress (p = 0.39), or stiffness (p = 0.75).Treatment with the tendon hydrogel significantly increases the ultimate failure load of tendons at the critical 4-week time point, and is a promising method for augmentation of tendon healing.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/PRS.0000000000000106\n\nView details for PubMedID 24776566\n\nAbstract\n\nThe ability to use the anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap as a vascularized fascial flap, without skin or muscle, was first documented by Koshima et al in 1989.

Lyophilized decellularized tendons were milled and enzymatically digested to form an ECM solution. The ECM solution properties are assessed by proteome analysis with mass spectrometry, and the material's rheological properties are determined as a function of frequency, temperature, and time. In vivo application of the gel in a rat model is assessed for remodeling and host cell repopulation. Histology for macrophage invasion, fibroblast repopulation, and nanoscale properties of the gel is assessed. Gel interaction with multipotent adipoderived stem cells (ASCs) is also addressed in vitro to assess possible cytotoxicity and its ability to act as a delivery vehicle for cells. Proteome analysis of the ECM-solution and gel mass spectroscopy identified the most abundant 150 proteins, of which two isoforms of collagen I represented more than 55% of the sample. Rheology showed that storage (G') and loss (G″) of the ECM solution were stable at room temperature but displayed sigmoidal increases after ∼15 min at 37°C, matching macroscopic observations of its thermo responsiveness. G' and G″ of the gel at 1 rad/s were 213.1±19.9 and 27.1±2.4 Pa, respectively. Electron microscopy revealed fiber alignment and good structural porosity in the gel, as well as invasion of cells in vivo. Histology also showed early CD68(+) macrophage invasion throughout the gel, followed by increasing numbers of fibroblast cells. ASCs mixed with the gel in vitro proliferated, indicating good biocompatibility. This ECM solution can be delivered percutaneously into a zone of tendon injury. After injection, the thermoresponsive behavior of the ECM solution allows it to polymerize and form a porous gel at body temperature. A supportive nanostructure of collagen fibers is established that conforms to the three-dimensional space of the defect. This hydrogel holds the distinctive composition specific for tendon ECM, where tissue-specific cues facilitate host cell infiltration and remodeling. The results presented indicate that injectable ECM materials from tendon may offer a promising alternative in the treatment of tendinopathies and acute tendon injuries.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1089/ten.tea.2013.0207\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000335661400020\n\nView details for PubMedID 24341855\n\nAbstract\n\nInjuries involving the tendon-bone interface (TBI) are difficult to address. Standard techniques typically lead to diminished strength of the healed insertion site. We hypothesized that these injuries would benefit from being reconstructed with decellularized composite grafts replacing both tendon and bone. To test this hypothesis, decellularized grafts were compared with conventional pullout repairs in an in vivo animal model.We harvested 48 Achilles TBI grafts from rats and decellularized them. Tendon-bone interface graft reconstruction and pullout repairs were compared using a pair-matched design. Biomechanical properties were evaluated at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. We evaluated histological analysis of insertion morphology and collagen type I/III content.There was a significant increase in ultimate failure load (35 ± 11 vs 24 ± 7 N) and ultimate tensile stress (1.5 ± 0.3 vs 1.0 ± 0.4 N/mm(2)) of the TBI grafts compared with pullout repairs at 2 weeks. These differences remained at 4 weeks. At 12 weeks, both TBI grafts and pullout repairs were as strong as native tissue and not significantly different from each other. Histology showed a more organized extracellular matrix in the TBI graft group at the early time points. Repopulation of the decellularized grafts increased over time. At 12 weeks, the insertion points of both groups were richly populated with cells that possessed morphologies similar to those found "
