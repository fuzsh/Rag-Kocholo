        "text": "Prospects for Ukraine in 2024–2027\n\nThe Road to Here\n\nThree years into the Ukraine War, it is worth recalling the breathless American and European estimates of Ukrainian collapse, including from then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley and President Joseph Biden.1 Germany and France reacted with a combination of disbelief and wish-casting. Germany wholly discounted the prospects of an invasion.2 This explains the volte-face that characterised Olaf Scholz’s Zeitenwende speech on 27 February, when per American estimates, Russian troops should have been in Kyiv.3 A serious French intelligence failure did occur, but France clearly viewed Russian aggression as a political opportunity, hence Emmanuel Macron’s high-speed dashes to Moscow.4 It is a testament to Macron’s political instincts that Macron ultimately transformed France’s strategic position, making it a crucial rhetorical supporter of Kyiv’s independence and European alignment.5 American intelligence failure was more explicable in one respect: the Russian campaign plan did very nearly succeed.6 Russia’s multi-axis assault, intelligence preparation, and country-wide air campaign were designed to overwhelm Ukrainian decision making, allowing Russian paratroopers to hold Hostomel Airport and Russian armored forces to enter Kyiv by 25 February. The Ukrainian military would dissolve into disconnected units that could be encircled and mopped up over the coming weeks, while the Russian Special Services would begin population control measures to occupy the country. Russia’s failure stemmed partly from planning complexity, much like Graf Schlieffen’s planned single-wing envelopment of French forces. Graf Moltke did weaken the right wing of the envelopment, but his moves never actually decreased German combat power on the right.7 But despite its theoretical merits, the Germans ultimately failed because of a number of friction points, primarily the need to neutralize Liege in 48 hours, conduct a high-speed advance through France on foot, and maintain momentum despite encountering battles. In the event, the third factor spoiled the operational plan. Much like Valery Zaluzhny and Oleksandyr Syrskyi assembled a defense of Kyiv after the shock of war dissipated, Joffre’s decision to drive forward and disrupt the German advance broke the battlefield theory of victory.8\n\nWestern planners should have understood the dangers of an overwrought, hyper-intellectualized view of battlefield maneuver.9 Even though Russian forces had pushed over the Irpin River, the capital remained in a defensible position, particularly since the Desna River narrowed Russian options in the east and the Dnipro prevented direct assault from the north. Moreover, absent the intelligence penetration that enabled Russia’s southern advances, there was little chance of Russian forces rapidly capturing urban areas. Hence Kharkiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv all resisted despite Russian encirclement, pressuring Russian supply lines running and forcing Russia to choose between an assault on the capital or methodical high-casualty urban combat elsewhere.10\n\nUnsurprisingly, 2022 was a year of operational movement. Most wars begin with a movement phase. Even the World War, a partial exception, proves the rule: the Phoney War from September 1939 to May 1940 was a strategic interlude, finally broken with a rapid maneuver campaign.11 Indeed, the Wehrmacht’s Fall Gelb is also illustrative in the Ukraine case.12 Ukraine and Russia have fought since 2014 over the Donbas, generating well-constructed, multi-layered fortifications along the line of contact.13 Assaulting these locations is difficult and costly, as Russia’s combat record demonstrates: it took Russia three months to capture Severodonetsk, six months to take Bakhmut, and six months of concerted combat after a decade of war to take Avdiivka. Much like the Wehrmacht’s General Staff in 1940, the Russian General Staff generated an aggressive operational plan that bypassed positional defenses. Yet, even the World War, a supposed maneuver war, had static stretches, including German and British minefield breaching operations, Soviet-German see-saw engagements around Moscow, brutal frontal assaults against trenches in Italy, and the costly U.S.-UK punch through the Siegfried Line.14\n\nThe Ukraine War’s positional-movement dynamics are similar. Ukraine staged three counteroffensives in 2022: a limited operation in Kharkiv that broke Russia’s siege, a broader Kharkiv operation that liberated 12,000 square kilometers of territory, and a more methodical operation in Kherson that threw Russian forces back over the Dnipro. Yet, since that point, there has been little to no movement, and not for lack of trying. Russia has executed two major offensives, a winter-spring 2022–2023 offensive that sought to capture Vuhledar and Bakhmut, and the winter 2023–2024 offensive against Avdiivka and Kupyansk. Neither has resulted in a major operational change, and both have imposed enormous losses on Russian forces. Ukraine, meanwhile, launched a major offensive June–September 2023, which failed to deliver operationally significant gains at obvious cost.\n\nWestern military and security officials repeatedly anonymously criticized Ukrainian strategic and operational decision making during the 2023 offensive.15 Ukraine, of course, largely disengaged with Western advice after the opening phase of its offensive, rapidly judging after the failure of its first breakthrough attempt against Robotyne that Western advice was irrelevant considering combat conditions.16 For example, the West has never fought a war under mutual air denial, limited but prised long-range strike capacity, and the acceleration and fusion of reconnaissance-strike and reconnaissance-fires complexes, all with a mass-mobilization army. Indeed, no Western country has executed a combined-arms breakthrough operation of the type Ukraine attempted since the World War or defended against one since the Vietnam War.\n\nWhat, then, are the conditions that Ukraine faces? How can the advice and support effort be better calibrated to assist Ukrainian strategic planning and operational work? What might this tell us as a diagnostic for the battlefield and European policy over the next three years?\n\nPositional Warfare\n\nAmerican advice and support missions have largely failed since Vietnam and notably failed in Iraq and Afghanistan.17 In the latter two cases, the United States refused to create a military organization that actually matched tactical and strategic requirements. The United States excels at Special Operations Forces (SOF) support. In Afghanistan and Iraq, U.S.-trained SOF were, and in the latter case remain, the backbone of state combat capacity.18 Ruthlessly deployed as assault infantry with extensive U.S. enabling capabilities behind them, local SOF tactically outfought any adversary. But the issue was strategic. Absent an American-sustained support network around them, Iraqi and Afghan SOFs lose combat effectiveness. In the Afghan case, this led to the regime’s collapse: absent air support, the Afghan National Army SOF were overwhelmed once the United States ended its sustainment mission.19\n\nWe arguably see a similar pattern in Ukraine. The closest contact between the U.S. military and the Ukrainian military prior to February 2022 came in SOF training missions.20 U.S. operators have spoken since 2022 of their lack of surprise at Ukrainian success—their view of the Ukrainian military, for bureaucratic reasons, was never transmitted to higher command or to net assessment and combat forecasting teams.21\n\nYet, bureaucracy alone does not explain the shortcomings of American and allied perceptions of the Ukrainian-Russian military balance, or difficulties in the advice and support mission. Bureaucratic inertia matters: Western-trained Ukrainian soldiers did receive high-quality combat medical instruction, but their trainers, never having fought on a UAS-saturated battlefield, did not provide coherent tactical and operational guidance that applied to the Ukrainian battlefield.22\n\nUnderstanding the gap between the American advice and support mission and the realities of the battlefield requires a return to military theory. Specifically, we need to understand the character of positional war, to which the Ukrainian battlefield has evolved, and from there, build out a series of analytical inferences and programmatic recommendations.\n\nThe recently relieved Valery Zaluzhny’s Economist piece last November offers a useful but incomplete starting point, particularly since he patterned his essay off Soviet military-theoretical models.23 His analysis centered upon the interlocking character of UAS, air defense, mines, electronic warfare, and counter-battery fire. When combined, they create a nasty problem for the attacker—dense minefields slow the attacker, persistent UAS surveillance identify attacking units rapidly while effective electronic disruption, counter-battery fire, and air defenses limit the offensive battlespace isolation. A breakthrough is possible with sufficient mass, but training and equipping that mass is difficult. Moreover, the combat power benefits of mass decline on the Ukrainian battlefield when massed forces are discovered and thereby attacked and destroyed, a reality Ukraine has amply demonstrated through its use of precision-guided munitions.\n\nZaluzhny’s piece is a relevant starting point because it identifies the fundamental positional logic of the Ukraine War. But Zaluzhny, to his detriment, never explicitly defines a positional war. This generates a significant difficulty since the term itself is not thoroughly defined elsewhere.\n\nAnglo-American military thought often conflates position with attrition. Attrition, in turn, is charged with significant negative implications. A war of attrition is often contrasted with a war of maneuver. The former is an unsophisticated slugfest akin to that of the Great War’s Western Front, in which materiel production and political resilience outweigh factors of military command.24 The latter is a model of military art, akin to Napoleon’s campaigns, in which tactical skill and aggression combine to create real examples of strategic and operational leadership.\n\nThe American bias toward maneuver over attrition is odd considering American military history. The greatest U.S. supreme commanders of the 18th and 19th centuries, George Washington and Ulysses Grant, were both masterful attritional fighters. Washington’s genius was in the retreat. While better-trained and equipped British forces won major engagements, Washington executed multiple successful retreats that preserved the bulk of Colonial forces. This was undoubtedly an attritional approach: by wearing the enemy down, Washington created the conditions for a more equitable strategic balance. Grant, meanwhile, embraced the logic of attrition. His Overland Campaign involved constant pressure on Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia, compelling it to give battle multiple times in just a few weeks, ultimately locking the Confederate forces into a brutal static war they could not win. William T. Sherman, the third great general of the American tradition, fought an equally attritional war in the Confederacy’s heartland, slicing it in half and destroying its war-making capacity through his March to the Sea and subsequent Carolinas Campaign.\n\nMoreover, the American military tradition lacks, in several fundamental respects, the concept of strategy given the United States’ commanding economic capacity. With the partial exception of the War of 1812, the United States has never engaged in a conflict from a position of structural weakness. The Confederacy did take with it well-trained officers and U.S. cotton production, but the Union’s industrial-mercantile northeast gave it a dominant advantage. Imperial Spain in 1898 was decaying. In 1917 and 1941, the United States did face significant adversaries, but America held advantages in population, industrial production, and resource wealth. Hence Franklin Roosevelt’s fundamental supposition, prior to December 1941, that ultimately American policy was simply to engage in the fight given its natural advantages.\n\nThe American strategy is, therefore, logistics, the skill of translating industrial capacity and population into combat power, and subsequently sustaining forces during engagements. This is an all-to-often neglected aspect of military science. However, it does not provide the American military practitioner with great fodder for theoretical inquiry.\n\nThe American tradition largely reaches to its German counterpart for examples of tactical military excellence. This began immediately after the World War, with the U.S. Army’s rational insistence upon debriefing German armored officers. Samuel Huntington’s The Soldier and the State solidified the trend. It takes the Prussian-German General Staff as its modern civil-military model, viewing the military officer as a professional dedicated to the rational political control of violence.25\n\nTactically and operationally, American military art emphasizes initiative, aggression, and the application of superior firepower and simultaneity between armor, artillery, and airpower, today coupled with cyberspace operations to collapse enemy cohesion and win a rapid, decisive victory akin to DESERT STORM or IRAQI FREEDOM. The Marine Corps equally embraced maneuver warfare and arguably drove beyond the Army’s obsession with it by the 1990s.26\n\nThis view self-evidently embraces maneuver warfare for partly self-serving reasons. Maneuver engagements are expressions of true military skill, embodied by Patton, Guderian, or Rommel—but they also keep wars short, crucial for U.S. democracy. Moreover, U.S. political authorities, per Huntington’s model, provide general objectives, while the military identifies the most rational combat solution to the problem presented. The military commander becomes capable of challenging the political leader on ostensibly objective military grounds, thereby abdicating responsibility to understand the totality of the combat environment in a manner Clausewitz would find inexplicable.\n\nYet, the dichotomy between attrition and maneuver, while common in American and Western military thought, is unhelpful intellectually. For one, attrition is the basic state of conflict, both from combat realities and due to Clausewitz’s friction.27 For another, the maneuver paradigm has prevented American strategists from coherently linking ends and means. By overwhelmingly emphasizing American combat methods, U.S. maneuver warfare departs from the contextual factors, political and military, that actually color combat.\n\nThe Soviet tradition conceived of maneuver and attrition rather differently. Most valuable is the work of AA Svechin, the first—and arguably the most intellectually coherent—of Soviet theorists.28 His text Strategy counterposes not attrition and maneuver, but attrition and destruction, the latter being a form of war in which the object is the destruction of the enemy’s combat capacity in direct engagements, the former being any other way of prosecuting an armed conflict. Svechin’s point is to demonstrate the limited context under which a war of destruction may be waged.\n\nHistorical comparison in military arts is difficult, hence Clausewitz’s demand that analogy should be sought from cases near in time.29 War is a political phenomenon, hence its nature is by necessity fixed, as is the nature of politics. But the character of politics, namely the organization of the political unit and the sorts of political and economic technologies employed, change over time, as does the character of warfare. The period of late 18th and early 19th century warfare thus marked the high point of the destruction approach, exemplified by Napoleon. Army size greatly expanded by the late 18th century due to changes in political technology and sustainment, but communications and transportation limits meant that tactical engagements could retain a direct link to strategy. Moreover, the 18th and early 19th-century state was personalized and post-feudal, not bureaucratic. Napoleon could win transformational victories because his enemies, as sovereigns or near-sovereigns, commanded their forces in combat, creating a direct link between the tactical and the political. This explains Napoleon’s success at Austerlitz, Jena-Auerstadt, and Wagram: in each engagement, he defeated an enemy sovereign and was, therefore, able to impose a peace. By contrast, Napoleon’s ultimate defeats from 1812 to 1815 stemmed from his inability to generate political effects from tactical victory. Borodino lacked it, while even Napoleon’s victories during the German Campaign were never overwhelming enough to achieve political reverberations. Subsequent examples of tactical engagements with direct political effect do exist, namely the Prussian victory at Koniggratz and the German victory at Sedan. But there are obvious differences between these victories and that of Austerlitz and Wagram. For in neither case did defeat lead to immediate enemy capitulation. After Koniggratz, it took Bismarck’s restraint to end the war on favorable terms. The French fought on for a year after Sedan, despite Napoleon III’s abdication.\n\nSvechin grasped that the Great War’s brutality was a result of this loss of the tactical-political link that dominated the age of linear tactics.30 The battlespace had expanded in width and depth, through a combination of societal mobilization, advances in communications, and the advent of indirect fire artillery to necessitate an organizing principle for combat well beyond that of individual engagements. The Prussian General Staff model did provide some help, particularly with Scharnhorst and Gneisenau’s political emphasis—an approach Prussian military genius Graf Moltke the Elder missed. However, the Prussian model did not successfully provide a logic for large-scale modern combat. Svechin’s objective was to demonstrate that, rather than emphasizing a decisive point and harmonizing all efforts toward that goal, modern war would typically be a societal contest of attrition in which victory would go to the side capable of winning the final engagement, not the first one.31\n\nSvechin’s understanding of positional warfare is couched within these terms.32 All wars have either offensive or defensive aims, which often change through a conflict, as tactical actions have strategic reverberations that compel a shift in political goals. A positional war occurs when at least one side adopts, even if temporarily, defensive objectives and digs in, creating Western Front-style layered fortification systems. Although offensives remain possible, a well-constructed defense requires excellent planning to conduct a breakthrough and exploitation operation at a high cost to the attacker. We can see this logic in action during the Soviet offensives from 1943 to 1945, when the Soviets were able to maintain the operational momentum from Kursk to Berlin through the careful management of reserves and staging of attacks, thereby preventing the Wehrmacht from reconstituting a stable defensive line.\n\nSvechin distinguishes between two types of positional offensives, those that are conducted still under positional conditions and those that break a positional war and return it to conditions of manoeuvre. His examples for the former include some of the highest-cost battles in human history, namely Verdun and the Somme.\n\nTransforming a positional battlefield into a manoeuvre one therefore requires immense effort and careful planning. Svechin’s analysis is instructive on the conditions necessary to prepare a positional offensive. There are two fundamental mistakes a commander can make in a positional war. First, a positional commander can reduce strategic and operational questions to those of logistics, viewing the positional fight as a contest with a static adversary that hinges upon production. Positional combat does demand a materiel focus. Yet, war is a non-linear and human phenomenon, requiring focus on far more than just materiel factors.\n\nSecond, and more dangerously, a positional commander can retain an unwarranted commitment to the offensive. Under maneuver conditions, commanders often decline the offensive, falling back to positions in the hope of making an enemy fight on unfavorable ground. This impulse, in Svechin’s view, is often taken to the extreme, although there is some good sense in it: had Lee followed it during the Gettysburg Campaign, the Army of Northern Virginia might well have retreated with its forces intact and compelled the Army of the Potomac to follow. However, under positional conditions, the scale of planning, coordination, and sequencing necessary for a breakthrough demands preparation beyond a single engagement or scrap of ground. But positional commanders rapidly become wedded to the ground upon which they fight, creating a dynamic where each side leans on the other.33\n\nCommanders maintain positions on unfavorable ground to use them for a future offensive, even if eminently defensible territory exists just a few hundred meters behind the current front line. Limited positional offensives can succeed with proper patience and planning to unpick an enemy defensive system. But positional conditions demand the careful accumulation of resources for an ultimate offensive, with force preservation and the limitation of adversary attrition being the tactical priority.\n\nAttrition and Decision\n\nThe Ukraine War is locked in a positional phase, with fortifications dominating the battlefield. The question, however, is whether Ukraine or Russia has any prospect of breaking the war’s positional character or whether or not the contest will continue in this manner until external political factors compel one or both parties to change their strategic calculus and accept a settlement.\n\nRussia and Ukraine face distinct geographic problems. Viewed purely economically, and bracketing diplomatic issues and political pressure, Ukraine could accept a peace that ceded most occupied territory to Russia. Prior to 2022, Ukraine had already moved much of its industrial production away from the Donbas. Russian gains do jeopardize both Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, but Ukraine can shift production elsewhere. Moreover, Ukraine has successfully reopened the Odesa port and expanded its rail links to Romania, reducing its reliance upon Kherson and the Azov Sea ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk.\n\nRussia, however, cannot conclude a peace in this fashion. It lacks a wide enough land corridor between the Donbas and Crimea to maintain coherent logistics under Ukrainian pressure, as the war has demonstrated in ample fashion. In the east, it lacks an anchor for defensive lines by virtue of geographic chance, as well as sufficient strategic depth. Ideally, the Oskil and Siverskyi Donbets would anchor the line in the north, while at minimum Slovyansk and Kramatorsk would anchor the line in the center.34 Ideally, Russia would push to the Dnipro, bisecting the country and establishing that as a long-term defensive shield from Ukrainian strikes in depth. Russia requires greater territorial gains to stabilize its strategic position, or it risks—much like from 2014 to 2022—facing an insoluble strategic problem that its regime seeks to solve through conquest.\n\nRussia has clung to the tactical offensive with the exception of Sergei Surovikin’s command during late 2022 and the summer 2023 defense in the south. Russia’s offensive results have been remarkably poor—the Russian military has lost north of 300,000 men killed and wounded, has burned through nearly all of its high-end armored vehicle stocks, and has turned to North Korea and Iran to provide it with ammunition. The difficulty is that absent a long refit period, better command-and-control structures, and improved planning, Russia will struggle to conduct and exploit a major breakthrough despite its materiel superiority.\n\nSvechin provides two points of additional reference for commanders in a positional, attritional war. This war is undoubtedly one of attrition for Ukraine, if not for Russia, since Ukraine is incapable, for political and strategic reasons, of conducting a destruction campaign.\n\nFirst, in a war of attrition, the decisive point in a post-Clausewitzean sense does not exist. Svechin does not mean that Clausewitz’s center of gravity is irrelevant—as authentically understood, Clausewitz’s center of gravity is not a physical piece of ground, but the nexus between moral cohesion, political objectives, economic capacity, and military power.35 In an attrition campaign, it is exceptionally difficult to identify a specific decisive point, because the objective is the overthrow of the enemy’s system. Hence per Svechin, the conditions for a decisive point must be created over time.\n\nSecond, in a positional war, the most crucial element of planning and operational art is the ability to manipulate enemy reserves. Positional defenses are extraordinarily difficult to break. If they are to be broken, the enemy must be corroded over time, with his forces divided, placed off balance, and attrited cumulatively to enable a final, decisive breakthrough that transforms the character of the war into one of destruction, rather than attrition.\n\nProspects\n\n2024 will be a year of defensive planning, fortifying, and attrition. Russian resources are finite, and more specifically, broader economic constraints will begin to impinge upon Russian planning. Hence a successful strategy from Ukraine and the West must use this year to build combat capacity in anticipation of actions in the future.\n\nRussia’s strategy is to buy time and keep up pressure in anticipation of a Western unraveling. Yet, it seems increasingly unlikely that this will occur. Aid is stalled in the U.S. Congress due to a combination of politicking and moral absurdity, for which blame is unevenly but collectively distributed between the Biden administration, House Republicans, and Congressional Democrats. However, the European powers look to have finally woken up. Ukraine has secured defense pacts with the UK, France, and Germany, while Central and Eastern Europe and Scandinavia are aggressively expanding defense production. Even if the United States abandons Ukraine, expanding European support and declining American leverage make this unlikely to end the war.\n\nRussia, however, has a ceasefire as its objective for obvious reasons. The Russian labor market is already extraordinarily tight and tightening daily with more losses in Ukraine and subsequent conscription for the war effort. Military product quality has dropped as a result. Moreover, much of Russian production is instead refurbishment from Soviet stockpiles. This is enough to keep Russia in the fight, to be sure, and an old tank or artillery piece is just as deadly if employed en masse. Yet, attrition is cumulative—additional stresses on the system will unravel it.\n\nGeneral mobilization in Russia would place the Kremlin in an increasingly insoluble bind, particularly in light of solidifying European support for Ukraine. Russia is unlikely to win the ground war absent a period of reorganization, planning, and stabilization. But accepting this would require reducing front-line pressure, all as Ukraine executes public drone attacks embarrassing to Putin. Hence the pressure must be maintained. However, this will demand greater mobilization—soon, given the sheer number of casualties Russia has taken. A mobilization will lead to another round of human and capital flight, squeezing an already tight labor market, and triggering another round of inflationary pressure.36 As the rouble depreciates, Russia will find it increasingly difficult to purchase foreign supplies, military and otherwise. This raises the odds of a domestic that Russia has continuously sought to prevent since February 2022. This crisis will destroy the state if left to fester long enough, demanding that Russia either win the war, a proposition beyond its capacity or pause the war, a move within its power if the Europeans do fragment.\n\nUkraine, meanwhile, must execute a well-organized active defense that inflicts severe casualties on Russia, forces it into a mobilization cycle, and maintains the pressure during that cycle to expand societal stress. Avdiivka is an example of this. Ukraine inflicted severe attrition upon Russian forces during the six-month engagement, committing several brigades, including 47 and 110 Mechanised Brigades, elements of 10 Mountain Assault Brigade, and other smaller units to the city’s defense, against a dozen Russian line brigades and regiments, likely a half-dozen territorial brigades, and a variety of Storm-Z units. The extraction from Avdiivka, conducted by the 3 Assault Brigade, came at a cost, including 200 stranded Ukrainian soldiers, while the 110 Mechanised Brigade in particular took a beating. But in return, Ukraine inflicted north of 30,000 casualties on the Russians, in exchange for around 6,000 Ukrainian dead and wounded—a rate of two Ukrainian brigades to around ten Russian brigades depending upon precise combat strength and combat medicine.\n\nA slow, methodical defense during which Ukraine cedes ground in a careful, painstaking manner is the best way to inflict this degree of trauma upon the Russian military. Yet, the issue is a political one. Ukraine will lose more ground this year, as Russia hopes to press Ukraine back to Orikhiv in Zaporizhzhia Oblast and then take it, and drive Ukraine back over the Oskil in Kharkiv Oblast. Russia will trumpet every victory, especially in the lead-up to the November 2024 U.S. elections.

Rather, both are elements in a force planning strategy that implements the Service’s strategic concept.1 It is the Marine Corps strategic concept that defines and drives its education and training requirements, and those requirements should determine the architecture of its schools and curriculums.\n\nFor its first one hundred years, the Marine Corps’ strategic concept required no formal education or training. Marines “were aboard ship to protect the ship’s officers and the vessel from the crew, many of which were or might be drunkards, malcontents, thieves, arsonists, thugs and mutineers,” and “were basically soldiers detailed for sea service whose primary duties were to fight aboard but not sail their ships.”2 This Service’s force plan centered upon ships’ detachments, which sometimes were used ashore to strengthen naval landing parties.\n\nThis changed after the Mexican War (1848) with the Marines’ primary missions altered to that of going ashore to protect American lives and property, manning ship’s guns, and quelling civil disorder. These were still missions that could be accomplished by provisional battalions and regiments organized from Marines drawn from ship detachments and Marine Barracks, but these larger landing forces required some basic training, and new officers and enlistees were joined to Marine Barracks for a prescribed initial period of instruction.\n\nAs modern steel battleships were developed, a higher technical proficiency was required of crews, requiring more extensive naval training. This led to greater Navy professionalism and less need for a ship’s guard. Generally, Navy officers began to view Marine officers as their intellectual and social inferiors, and beginning in the 1890s, an influential cadre of Navy officers tried to eliminate Marines from ships altogether.3 The reform-minded Colonel Commandant Charles McCawley, who had seen his own position as Commandant reduced in grade to colonel from brigadier general, addressed the difficulties through a major reorganization of the Corps. As part of this reorganization, all of the 50 officers joining the Corps between 1881 and 1897 were Naval Academy graduates, promotion examinations were instituted for corporals and sergeants and included “reading, writing, and the simple rules of arithmetic,” and in 1885, the Navy Department published a Marines Manual: Prepared for the use of The Enlisted Men of the United States Marine Corps, ordering its distribution to all Marines having more than one year left on their enlistments.4 At Colonel Commandant McCawley’s insistence, the distribution of this manual “for enlisted men” was also distributed to all Marine officers.\n\nMcCawley’s restructuring continued under Colonel Commandant Charles Heywood. On 1 May 1891, Colonel Commandant Heywood created the School of Application. Heywood located the school at Marine Barracks, Washington, DC, and put it under the direction of Capt D.P. Mannix assisted by SgtMaj Thomas F. Hayes. Colonel Commandant Heywood would also introduce mandatory examinations of officers and fitness reports.5\n\nUnlike the commissioning of only Naval Academy graduates, the creation of the School of Application, the introduction of examinations, and the publication of a Marine Manual were changes in education and training tied to a force planning strategy. Restricting new officers to the ranks of Naval Academy graduates was an early form of joint professional military education (JPME), “grounded in the justification that officers need a common basis of knowledge with each other and with others in the national security community in order to operate effectively,” a justification of JPME that continues.6\n\nLacking under McCawley and Heywood was a Marine Corps strategic concept. Unwanted, disorganized, flaying, and shrinking, the Commandants struggled to maintain the Corps as a separate Service within the Navy Department. It was the 1900 Navy Board that provided the Marines with a strategic concept.\n\nThe 1900 Navy Board, under ADM George Dewey who had claimed that if there had been 5,000 Marines with which to garrison Manila in 1898 there would have been no Philippine Insurrection, formally changed the Marine Corps’ primary mission to defending bases in the Caribbean and off the Chinese mainland—creating what became known as the advance base mission.7 In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt, no fan of the Marine Corps, tried to isolate the Marines from the Army and Navy ships with Executive Order 969 defining the duties of the Marine Corps, in order of priority, as:\n\nGarrison naval yards and stations inside and outside of the United States.\n\nProvide mobile defense for naval bases and stations outside the United States.\n\nMan static naval base defenses outside the United States.\n\nGarrison the Panama Canal.\n\nProvide expeditionary duty overseas in times of peace.8\n\nFor the first time since the era of sailing ships, Marines had a place within the national security apparatus to develop a strategic concept that would establish the Corps’ education and training requirements for the next forty years.\n\nDespite all efforts to reduce Marines to yard guards, the Marines focused on other missions. In 1910, the Corps founded the Advance Base School in New London and created the Advance Base Force in 1913. The following year the First and Second Advance Base Regiments conducted the first advance base exercise on Culebra.\n\nAs the Marine Corps focused on advance base operations, its missions of defending bases in the Caribbean and expeditionary duty overseas in times of peace took on new importance. Marines were called upon to fulfill President Theodore Roosevelt’s corollary to the Monroe Doctrine to intervene in the Caribbean and Central America to guarantee European financial interests. Initially, these interventions were peaceful; however, in 1915 the nature of these interventions changed when President Woodrow Wilson offered armed intervention to the Dominican Republic government to protect it from rebels—euphemistically referred to as bandits. “The policy had thus been extended from financial supervision to the necessary control to assure the maintenance of peace.” The issue of whether such armed occupations constituted an initiation of war was resolved when it was agreed, “If you land one section of the Army that is war.” But “you can land a Sailor or a Marine and it is not considered war.”9 In that single sentence, the Marine Corps expeditionary mission was solidified.\n\nWhile on expeditionary duty in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, Marine Corps education and training would further evolve with the creation of regimental schools in 1922. In addition to valuable bush warfare and counterinsurgency training, these schools also provided Marines with communication and cooperation with aircraft training, marksmanship, using bayonets and grenades, and interior guard. Officers were further instructed in using aviation, artillery, naval gunfire, armored cars, and tactics. Enlisted men lacking general education competencies were enrolled in correspondence courses initially developed by the International Correspondence School (ICS) and delivered through the Marine Corps Institute (MCI).10\n\nA different form of expeditionary duty saw Marines joining the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) in France where, in addition to providing a Marine brigade for combat, Marines served at all levels of command across the AEF. John Lejeune commanded the Army’s 64th Brigade and three French regiments before taking command of the U.S. Second Division. Eli Cole commanded the Army’s 41st Infantry Division (First Depot Division), and Smedley Butler commanded Camp Pontanezen, a key chokepoint in the AEF’s Service of Supply. Field-grade Marine officers distinguished themselves in command and on the staffs of Army formations. Marine captains and lieutenants did the same leading Army units in combat.11\n\nThis experience, coupled with the continued Marine Corps occupation of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, shaped a new Service identity within the Corps. The Marine Corps had developed its own cadre of flag officers and had achieved success in organizing and commanding large formations. The Corps now had Marine Corps bases, independent of a naval yard or station, at Quantico and Parris Island. The Marine Corps began to think of itself as an independent Service within the Department of the Navy. To sustain this independence as a Service would require a significant shift in the strategic concept of the Corps. In January 1920, this shift in Service self-concept saw officer training moved from Parris Island and Philadelphia and formally reconstituted as Marine Corps Schools at Quantico. Also relocated to Quantico were the remnants of the Advance Base Force which had been left at the League Island Naval Yard under the command of temporary MajGen L.W.T. Waller, one of the Marine Corps’ most distinguished and colorful officers, who was too old and too incapacitated for service in France or the Caribbean.\n\nInitially, the curriculum of Marine Corps Schools “mirrored that of the Army’s staff school at Fort Leavenworth and the studies centered around Army doctrine, Army Organization, and Army problems.”12 With the exception of The Basic School, Marine officers were not required to attend Marine Corps Schools, and many elected to attend Army schools instead. Similarly, they could attend the Naval War College or the new Naval Aviation School, bypassing the Company Officers’ and Field Officers’ Course. Within the operating forces, Marines trained in amphibious warfare and advanced base operations with the Navy in Cuba, Hawaii, and Culebra.\n\nMeanwhile, the Marine Corps Schools used the Marines stationed at Quantico to enact large Civil War battles. Under the command of BGen Smedley Butler, the East Coast Expeditionary Force (formerly the Advance Base Force) conducted long field marches to enact large-scale re-enactments of Civil War battles, including Pickett’s Charge while at Gettysburg. In both field exercises and lectures, students at Marine schools were provided instruction on lessons learned in the American Revolution and Civil War.13\n\nFor a Service whose self-concept was as an independent Service within the Department of the Navy, its education and training were lacking in both content and focus. This would change with the creation of a Division of Operations and Training within Headquarters Marine Corps, the individual scholarship of Marines such as Dion Williams, the publication of the Tentative Landing Operations Manual in 1934, and command of the Marine Corps Schools passing to James Carson Breckinridge.14\n\nCol Breckinridge first commanded Marine Corps Schools from 2 July 1928 to 25 December 1929. Following service in China, BGen Breckinridge returned to Marine Corps Schools on 25 April 1932, with a reform agenda and the direction provided by his predecessor, the departing MajGen Commandant Lejeune:\n\nThere is a field in the conduct of war which can be properly covered only by Marines, and that is military operations connected with naval activities. Once ashore, there is no great difference between Army and Marine forces, but skillful execution of the vital operation of transfer from troopship to a safe position on the beach, of itself, justifies the maintenance of an efficient Marine Corps as an essential part of the naval establishment.\n\nThe design of courses at the Marine Corps Schools should, therefore, have in view that the Marine Corps is not an Army but an essential part of the Navy to be employed for naval purposes and that emphasis on the education of its officers should be placed on the requirements of those purposes.15\n\nUnder Breckinridge, the curriculum of Marine Corps Schools—including its Extension School which included courses for non-commissioned officers—was revised with fully one-half of the instruction focused on advance base operations. For a time, Breckinridge closed the senior course to allow the faculty to participate in creating doctrine. In 1934, a change in the school’s course titles to the Amphibious Warfare Junior Course and Amphibious Warfare Senior Course was pushed by Breckinridge to reflect better what was being taught to Marines at Marine Corps Schools.\n\nThe Marine Corps strategic Service concept would be further refined under Commandants Russell and Holcomb as they prepared for war in the Pacific. Marine Corps training and education would continue to evolve as part of force planning. Outside of Marine Corps Schools, specialized training was taking place in aviation, the employment of supporting weapons, logistics, and fleet operations. By 1939, the Marine Corps, although understaffed, was prepared to expand quickly and conduct offensive operations in the Pacific. Its training and education programs had been an effective part of a force planning strategy that successfully implemented the Marine Corps’ strategic concept.\n\nThe five years immediately following the end of the Second World War were exhausted in various schemes for defense unification, all of which envisioned a substantially reduced Marine Corps—if such a Corps continued to exist. Even within the Marine Corps, a special board, the Advance Base Problem Team at Marine Corps Schools reported that within an atomic age of warfare, the World War II type of amphibious assault was dead. LtCol Victor Krulak, a member of The Advance Base Problem Team, said the report voiced:\n\na prospective military philosophy. It consists of thinking in terms of the next war instead of the last. This means starting with ideas, when you have nothing more tangible, and developing them into concepts, procedures, and weapons for the future.16\n\nThe work begun by the Advance Base Problem Team remains interrupted and unfinished.\n\nOn 5 July 1950, elements of the U.S. Eighth Army engaged the North Korean Army at Osan. By August, the Eighth Army and its allies had been pushed south into the 230-kilometer-long Pusan Perimeter. On 2 August, the First Provisional Marine Brigade, led by BGen Edward Craig, landed at Pusan, entering combat on 7 August. Marines were once again deployed as part of the Army and the work begun by the Advance Base Problem Team was interrupted.\n\nDuring the Korean War, “Marine Corps Schools, Camp Pendleton and MCAS El Toro carried the main burden of training … the Schools for turning out junior officers, and Pendleton and El Toro for preparing and processing the steady flow of replacements. … By the end of the war, 60 percent of the Corps had traveled that path … Conspicuous in the Pendleton cycle was the ordeal of cold-weather training.”17\n\nA similar scenario would take place on 8 March 1965, when the 9th MAB landed at Da Nang, South Vietnam. Again, the Marines would be placed under Army control, and a steady flow of reinforcements followed by replacements would travel through Marine Corps Schools, Camp Pendleton, and MCAS El Toro. “Two and Thru” Marines dominated the force, spending six months in training, followed by thirteen months in Vietnam and 90 days in garrison before an early release. The work of the Advance Base Problem Team was now forgotten, and its members retired.\n\nThirty-five years (1945–1975) of a policy of defense unification, major deployments as part of an American land army, and a continuously transitory force changed the Marine Corps Service concept. While Marines would continue to make landings in Lebanon, the Dominican Republic, Cambodia, and elsewhere, the Corps as an organization was adrift, moving away from its Service strategic concept and advance base and amphibious heritage.\n\nAt the Marine Corps Development and Education Command, curriculums were revised to both confront and embrace these changes. At the Command and Staff College, its curriculum began to include topics “outside of its previous narrow Marine Corps and amphibious warfare focus.” Emphasis was now placed on statecraft, analysis of treaty obligations and restrictions, unified and specified commands, and the career potential of service “with departmental, combined, joint, and high-level Service organizations.”18 Envisioned as a sort of field-grade workshop, “a good portion of the student’s time will go into individual research projects, with corresponding free time for independent work written directly into the course syllabus.”19 “The Commandant of the Marine Corps also desired that the students be competitive; competitive not against each other, but against the high standards expected of a Marine officer.”20 Once again, the Corps was adrift with an unclear strategic concept, as was reflected in its training and education.\n\nAs the Marine Corps struggled to regain a Service concept other than that of the Nation’s better-prepared “second land army,” two visionary leaders were emerging. At Fleet Marine Forces Pacific, LtGen Louis Wilson was loudly arguing for modernization, insisting the Marine Corps should be a force in readiness—responsive and mobile while maintaining fast-moving, hard-hitting, seabased, air-ground task forces. In the same time frame, BGen Alfred Gray was changing Marine Corps training to emphasize large-scale maneuvers in desert and cold-weather environments. Both Wilson and Gray were redefining the Marine Corps strategic Service concept, but Gen Gray would take it the furthest, publishing a statement concerning service philosophy that became doctrine (FMFM 1, Warfighting). Warfighting provided a Service philosophy, but it fell short of providing a strategic concept for the Corps.\n\nWhile the Marine Corps likes to tie the creation of Marine Corps University in 1989 to the publication of Warfighting in that same year, Marine Corps University is actually an end-product of defense unification as expressed in the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986. Goldwater-Nichols itself was a congressional reaction to the incessant inter-Service rivalries of the previous century and the perceived military failures that were the result of these rivalries.\n\nGoldwater-Nichols sought to replace each Service’s strategic concept with a DOD-wide, Joint Services strategic concept (“joint” becoming the operative word replacing “unified”). Much of Goldwater-Nichols focused on the effective management of military officers, and section 663 (Education) contained additional requirements specifically related to “Joint Professional Military Education (JPME).” One of these requirements was a “review of service schools’ curricula to strengthen the focus on joint matters and to ensure that graduates were adequately prepared for joint duty assignments.”21 The House Armed Services Committee panel on military education (the Skelton Panel) recommended that Phase I JPME be taught in service colleges with a follow-on, temporary, Phase II taught at the Armed Forces Staff College (AFSC).22 Congress integrated this recommendation into the Fiscal Year 1990–1991 National Defense Authorization Act as a statement of congressional policy.23 In follow-up inducements to encourage attendance, Congress authorized the offering of accredited master’s degrees and more flexibility in follow-on assignments. Marine Corps University is a direct outgrowth of a congressionally mandated, Joint Services’ strategic concept, and funding earmarked to effect that joint concept.\n\nMilitary education and training do not take place in a vacuum. Rather, both are elements in a force planning strategy that implements the Service’s strategic concept. The development of such a Service strategic concept has been hampered by two factors. The first is the extraordinary success Marine officers have enjoyed in rising to the top of the DOD unified command structure. In many ways, Marines have far exceeded their counterparts. Finding a Service strategic concept will require general officers willing to forgo the career opportunities “with departmental, combined, joint, and high-level Service organizations” Goldwater-Nichols jointness has provided in favor of leading Marines. The other factor is once again Marines have been deployed for an extended period as part of an American land army.\n\nAs the Armed Forces regroup from the decades-long Global War on Terror, the JPME concept has come under increased scrutiny and criticism. On 5 February 2019, the Secretary of the Navy announced decisions and immediate actions resulting from the department-level, department-wide, Education for Seapower study. This memorandum called for the refocusing of Navy and Marine Corps education and training on warfighting capabilities, naval war‑\n\nfighting, and the consolidation of the department’s education programs into a single Naval University System with departmental education and student selection standards. It also directed a review of JPME with recommendations for changes to make naval JPME more relevant to naval careers and the “unique, expeditionary-centric, forward operational requirements of the Navy-Marine Corps team.”24\n\nAs has been discussed within the Gazette, controversy surrounds the formulation of a Marine Corps strategic concept and the strategic force plan to implement that concept. EABO, as a strategic concept continues to be challenged by advocates for a Marine Corps focused on extended land operations in conjunction with the Army. This focus on supporting Army operations has critics not only within the Marine Corps but also within the Air Force, Navy, and Pentagon. For the time being, this lack of an accepted Service concept and force plan makes the design of effective training and education impossible. However, this might be the proper time for Marine Corps Schools (i.e. Marine Corps University) to undertake the challenge of the 1950s Advance Base Problem Team to start with ideas, when you have nothing more tangible, and develop them into concepts, procedures, and weapons for the future.\n\n>Dr. Doyle was in federal service for 22 years including 9 years in the Marine Corps, resigning as a CWO2 to accept a civilian appointment within the DOD as a Supervising Academic Programs Officer.

To remedy this problem, this article advocates the MLR obtain an unmanned air platform for target acquisition in organic sea-denial operations. First, this article will review the operational context and define the constraints of both landbased and naval aviation in supporting the MLR. Next, it will describe the MLR’s current capabilities and advantages in expeditionary advanced base operations (EABO). Lastly, the article will propose the capabilities needed for an unmanned platform to support MLR sea-denial operations, provide a use case, and considerations for its adoption.\n\nOperational Context\n\nThe source of alarm for American military power in the Western Pacific is China’s anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) system, a sheaf of sea, air, and landbased ballistic and cruise missiles extending outward from the Chinese coast, and at the heart of China’s A2/AD system is a recognition of the American way of war. As the Chinese Communist Party and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) witnessed the overwhelming defeat of Iraq in the Gulf War via precision munitions and advanced communication technology, a new strategy was necessary to prevent a similar defeat in a future campaign for the PLA historic objective: Taiwan. This consisted of a military build-up of rocket forces, air forces, and long-range scouting capabilities to strike U.S. forces in forward locations where it can build up combat power or the sea lanes that transport said combat power. Today, American bases in the Western Pacific fall under the looming threat of over 4,000 missiles that can impose significant costs to American air and naval forces alike.\n\nLandbased Aviation ConstraintsThe PLA’s A2/AD poses a significant threat to landbased aviation in the Western Pacific. If hostilities broke out, the PLA could launch a variety of missile systems at airbases, damaging or destroying hangars, runways, aircraft, and vital supplies like fuel and ordnance.2 Landbased aviation in the Western Pacific would be hard-pressed to provide support without the necessary facilities and logistics to support them. Furthermore, joint aircraft, including Marine Corps aircraft, are tasked via the air tasking cycle, a joint 72-hour process of assigning, allocating, and apportioning all aircraft to support varying missions within a joint operations area, which makes them susceptible to competing missions. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Army ISR aircraft will be responsible for more than just missions in support of the MLR.\n\nDistant support is also dubious. The Air Force boasts a considerable long-range ISR and bomber force—both of which could theoretically support the MLR’s sea denial operations. However, most long-range ISR and bomber aircraft are stationed in the United States, and without forward basing, would face similar constraints. For example, in a Taiwan contingency, B-52s launching from the CONUS were calculated to suffer a severe sortie generation loss of only one sortie per aircraft every 48 hours.3 Extrapolating the challenges to other continental aircraft, the sortie generation rate would not be high enough to reliably depend on for persistent surveillance; additionally, these aircraft would also need to support various missions that would further limit available sorties to support the MLR.\n\nNaval Aviation Constraints\n\nIn modern naval operations, the aircraft carrier has been the striking and sensing arm of the Navy while surface combatants have provided close-in defense of air and subsurface threats for the carrier. With the PLA’s A2/AD system able to target ships and aircraft from 1,000 miles to over 3,000 miles, and due to the quantity and variety of missiles, A2/AD would pose a serious threat in wartime that the carrier strike group must mitigate.4 To do so, the CSG must sail between 1,000 to 1,500 nautical miles away from the Chinese coast, where the variety of anti-ship missiles declines from six variants to only two—the H-6-bomber launched YJ-12s and landbased DF-26s—and subsequently reducing the total number of missile systems capable of targeting it to within a manageable threshold of the CSG’s air defenses.5 As a consequence, naval aviation suffers and constrains the MLR in receiving necessary support for its sea denial mission.\n\nThe Navy’s special mission aircraft are essential to multiple kill chains which is their fatal flaw vis-à-vis the MLR.6 The E-2D is a carrier-launched early warning and control aircraft that can detect and track air targets as well as conduct wide-area surface searches. In this capacity, it acts as the eyes of the carrier to scout for air and surface threats, and it also networks ship and airborne sensors into a singular picture through the Cooperative Engagement Capability. With a common air picture, the Cooperative Engagement Capability enables ships and aircraft to fire at a target with high-quality data consolidated from various radars, which increases accuracy, range, and reaction time.7 Assigning the E2-D to a mission outside of its doctrinal use, like supporting the MLR, would jeopardize the survivability of the carrier and the wider fleet; additionally, its few numbers means the loss of even one, whether by enemy fire or poor tasking, could be catastrophic. The P-8 is the Navy’s primary means of locating submarines by deploying sonobuoys, launching weapons, and collecting and synthesizing track data from various sources. Like the E2-D, the P-8 is too few and exquisite a collections platform to risk far forward of the fleet. Unlike the E2-D, the P-8 is a landbased aircraft, so it will launch from airfields more distant than carrier-based aircraft drastically impacting its sortie rates. Consequently, the P-8 will be hard-pressed to support both the fleet’s and the MLR’s sea denial operations. The E-2 and P-8’s central roles in multiple kill chains make them indispensable, and unreliable for support to the MLR.\n\nThe Navy also operates the MH-60R to support sea-control and sea-denial operations. The rotary-wing platform is designed to provide detection and targeting of submarines and ships for the CSG. As a rotary-wing platform, however, the MH-60R is designed for close-in sensing and striking of surface and subsurface threats and thus has limited range to support any operations outside a certain diameter around the carrier—if the CSG were even willing to part with its vital support. Although as a vertical take-off and landing aircraft it would fit well in expeditionary advanced base operations, it supports up to twelve mission sets, which already would spread the numerous aircraft across the fleet thin.8\n\nThe Navy and Marine Corps’ tactical aircraft (TACAIR), specifically the F/A-18 and F-35C, face the most intensive constraints. As the primary means of conducting anti-surface warfare, TACAIR sorties will be spread thin supporting the CSG’s degradation of A2/AD. Tactical aircraft missions will vary from defending against H-6 bombers and DF-26s, finding and striking PLA surface combatants, and escorting high-value airborne assets to combating PLA carrier aircraft, straining the support available to the MLR. Tactical aircraft that could support the MLR will not be responsive and extremely costly. Due to the distances that the CSG will operate at, TACAIR would be required to conduct a three-to-six-hour sortie to support operations in the first island chain. The length of the sorties requires tanker support, fixed loadouts, more maintenance, strained and tired manpower, and more that the Navy must contend with in their own sea control efforts. The MLR will require higher fidelity intelligence to justify TACAIR assuming such risks.\n\nMLR Sea Denial and Its Constraints As a stand-in force, the MLR is expected to disrupt the adversary through reconnaissance, counter-reconnaissance, and sea-denial operation in the littoral environment in support of a maritime campaign. For fires, the MLR can organically employ the Naval Strike Missile from EABs and command and control multi-domain fires and effects via the MLR’s Alpha Command, which consists of a Fire Support Coordination Center, the LAAB’s Fires and Air Direction Center, an Intel operations center, the Regimental S-3, and regimental commander. Within the Alpha Command, the Fires and Air Direction Center can control and coordinate air support for long-range surface strikes while employing distributed tactical air control elements and air defense systems and sensors, like the Marine Air Defense Integrated System and the TPS-80 groundbased air surveillance radar. The EABs prove resilient to A2/AD for two reasons: survivability and resources. Relative to air and sea, and due to the vegetation, dense population centers, and complex topography of the FIC, the littorals prove challenging for radar, electro-optical/infrared (EO/IO) sensors, and space sensors to find targets.\n\nWhen finding ground targets, radar platforms face multiple challenges. When radar energy is scattered by objects other than its intended target, also known as clutter, the radio wave can be attenuated, meaning the waves are scattered or absorbed in such a way that reduces the intensity of the wave and, as a consequence, the quality of the information gleaned.9 At sea, attenuation can be caused by weather effects like fog, rain, clouds, dust, and more.10 In the littorals, the clutter would be two-fold, with weather effects as well as vegetation, man-made infrastructure, topography, and more that could further attenuate radar energy.11 For high-frequency fire control and targeting radars, higher frequencies suffer more attenuation, which complicates finding a target and receiving track-quality data to fire with.12 The amount of clutter in the littorals offers a unique opportunity for EABs to conceal themselves from radar systems and remain resilient against adversary targeting. Littoral clutter also offers considerable concealment from EO/IO sensors. Electro-optical/infrared sensors benefit from lower altitudes to generate higher quality imagery to satisfy identification requirements, and—due to the dense environment of the littorals—EO/IO-equipped aircraft will have to descend to altitudes that will expose them to the LAAB’s layered air defenses. Once detected, an EAB can reduce their signature to avoid detection, employ decoys, engage the aircraft, displace to an alternate position at the first available opportunity, or a combination therein.\n\nDespite their ubiquity, satellite observation is still a resource-intensive undertaking. Most remote sensing satellites orbit in a sun-synchronous orbit. Sun-synchronous orbits are polar orbits that pass overhead any given place on the earth’s surface at the same local mean time daily. This makes the satellites’ flight paths and on-station times not only predictable and momentary but also limits the area that can be surveilled, particularly in a region as vast as the Pacific. Additionally, military surveillance satellites are built with target sets in mind. For example, the Jianbing Ocean surveillance program of the Yaogan satellite series is designed to collect electromagnetic emissions of aircraft carriers like aircraft launches, communications transmissions, and radar emissions.13 As subsets of the PLA’s remote sensing satellites are designed with specific targets in mind, the breadth of targets that they are optimized to observe is limited and restrains the quality and quantity of observation that the PLA can employ against U.S. forces, including the MLR. Much like other sensors, with signature management and mobility, the MLR can defeat such systems.\n\nIt is unlikely that the MLR will be able to defeat adversarial ISR wholesale—and that is part of the appeal. One of the critical functions of joint fire support is to synchronize and optimize very limited resources, and although adversary A2/AD is robust, it too must adhere to similar tenants.14 If enough EABs occupy the first island chain capable of firing on Chinese air, surface, and subsurface forces while multiple Carriers steam across the Pacific to do the same, the PLA is faced with a dilemma: which target is the priority? Whichever answer the PLA chooses exposes them to resource constraints in targeting the other. For example, if they prioritize reconnaissance efforts in finding expeditionary advanced bases, using a combination of radar systems, reconnaissance aircraft, and satellites to target them, they now have fewer resources to employ against the Navy. By drawing Chinese attention and resources toward the first-island chain, stand-in forces bind targeting resources that may otherwise be used against naval and air forces, granting them critical maneuver and decision space. To do so, the MLR must pose a credible threat, of which its sea denial kill chains are the crux. Yet, due to competing missions and lower sortie generation rates, the MLR will need to meet higher intelligence requirements to justify support for its kill chains, which due to the reliance on external ISR support from the exact forces the MLR is supporting, will prove difficult. Thus, the credibility of the MLR hinges on acquiring an unmanned aerial platform capable of vertical take-off and landing, equipped with a surface search radar, link-16 capabilities, electro-optical/infrared sensors, and with the option to deploy sonobuoys.\n\nCapabilities\n\nAn MLR intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance asset, herein referred to as “the asset,” would be a boon for both the MLR and the larger Joint Force and enable the MLR to organically fulfill its sea-denial mission. First, the asset must fit within the logistical framework of the MLR. To do so, it must be capable of vertical take-off and landing to operate from dispersed EABs as well as naval vessels ranging from full-scale amphibs to smaller ships like the landing ship medium. As an unmanned system, the logistics requirements and operations costs would be lessened. In a cost comparison, unmanned platforms were cheaper on average than manned platforms in both acquisition costs and flight cost per hour by 200 million dollars and 60,000 dollars, respectively.15 Cheaper operations and acquisition costs allow additional funds to be allocated to procuring more systems and preserving sustainable maintenance cycles. However, the asset must not carry armaments. If the asset were equipped with armaments, its logistics chain would become needlessly cumbersome, adding specialized personnel, equipment, and ordinance that would slow down its operations and bloat the MLR’s logistics footprint.\n\nFor the asset to support the MLR in command and control of multi-domain fires, it requires multiple sensors and communications capabilities, primarily a surface search for mobile targets at sea. Once the asset paints a target with its radar, track data is generated and then can be transmitted via Link-16 to Alpha Command, where the track can be analyzed to discern the category (merchant or combatant), type (patrol or destroyer), and class (Renhai or Luyang) of the targeted ship.16 The track data generated from the asset’s radar can also prove useful in anti-submarine warfare by detecting surfaced submarines. If a surfaced submarine is detected with the asset radar, it can force the submarine to dive prematurely or be at risk of being targeted while transmitting the track data to a higher-echelon asset, like a P-8 which will have a more holistic ASW picture.17 With sonobuoys equipped, the asset can rely on cueing from the P-8 or its surface search radar to deploy sonobuoys in maritime chokepoints and likely transit lanes of submarines.\n\nWith EO/IO sensors, the asset can confirm intelligence requirements set by the Target Engagement Authority, which is “the authority and responsibility to engage targets [that] rests with the [Joint Force Commander] responsible for the operational area.”18 With EO/IO sensors, the asset can provide the MLR with the positive identification requirements necessary to conduct a strike that includes the ship hull, name, and flag.19 Due to the asset’s maneuverability and speed, it can gain vital proximity to the target to glean such information while simultaneously forcing the target to divert air defense and reconnaissance resources to target the asset rather than other friendly forces.20 In tandem with the asset radar, the asset’s EO/IO sensors satisfy positive identification requirements for strike coordination, which with high enough situational awareness and trust, could encourage the TEA to delegate to a lower level, which would doubtlessly accelerate MLR kill chains.21\n\nThe capability that binds the asset, the Alpha Command, and the Joint Force together is Link-16, a jam-resistant, high-capacity data link that disseminates radar, sonar, electronic warfare, and other positioning data to users.22 With a Link 16-terminal, the asset can push track data generated from its radar and pull track data from other Link-enabled sensors, like F/A-18s, F-35s, naval ships, and more—ensuring reliable access to a theater common operational picture (COP) for the Alpha Command. The asset can not only ensure access to the theater-level COP for the Alpha Command but also to the MLR’s other Link-enabled EABs beyond the Alpha Command’s line-of-sight by acting as a node to not only disseminate awareness but also to ensure the economic use of force by deconflicting fires for friendly forces.23\n\nThe combination of the asset’s capabilities, the radar, EO/IO sensors, and Link-16 would support the prerequisites for the MLR’s anti-ship missile fires to launch. Through the radar, the asset generates primary targeting data, identifying the type of ship, its class, location, and other relevant targeting data. Leveraging its maneuverability and speed, the asset can gain vital proximity to the target and employ its EO/IO sensors to confirm the information as well as glean more. All the while, the Alpha Command is processing the sensor data received via Link-16 while it simultaneously populates on a theater-level COP for the Joint Force’s situational awareness. At this juncture, the TEA decides to engage the target with the MLR’s anti-ship fires in combination with joint missile fire. Once target engagement is approved, the Alpha Command can relay the targeting data received by the asset either via a J-series message to launch platforms and their Fires Direction Centers have a Link-16 terminal or through a K-series message on the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System. The Fires Direction Center can conduct the necessary checks and gunnery to launch the Naval Strike Missile while the Alpha Command conducts the air and waterspace deconfliction for the missile’s flightpath. Once both are confirmed and cleared, the Alpha Command provides approval to launch. While the asset is still on station, it can provide target updates to inbound missile salvos, if necessary, as the high-quality track data it generates allows network-enabled missiles to adjust course until they reach a certain radius from their aimpoint that they can detect and target on their own, otherwise known as a kill radius.24 During the engagement, the asset can provide a means to assess effects that would inform the TEA’s divert or abort decisions. After the engagement, the asset can continue to monitor to assess effects and support reattack decisions.\n\nOnce the engagement is completed and the desired effects achieved, the asset can either continue to monitor, repeating the above targeting cycle for follow-on targets, or return to base. With either a Group 3 or Group 4 unmanned platform, the asset could monitor throughout the MLR’s zone of fire with an eight-to-ten-hour loiter time, making it available for multiple missions within one on-station window. However, once an MLR asset has landed and completed its tasking for the day, if acquired in sufficient quantity, another can take its place. With enough platforms, the asset could support 24-hour operations, which will likely be necessary in the scale of conflict envisioned in the Western Pacific.\n\nConditions\n\nIt is well known in scholarship that the intersection of technological employment and force employment, onset by new organizational approaches, pays dividends for increases in military power, and the asset is no different.25 To profit from this dividend, the MLR must form a Littoral Scouting Squadron (LSS) under its command. This LSS would be task-organized in similar fashion as the MEF’s VMU Squadrons, purpose-built to operate and maintain the asset while training the requisite personnel in its unique employment and mission. With access to adjacent Battalion-level staffs, the LSS would have access to a myriad of experts, from Air Command and Control and Air Ground Support in the LAAB to the Fires expertise in the LCT. This creates a coherent kill chain organic to the MLR: The LSS to sense, the LCT to shoot, and the LAAB to connect them. Alternatively, the asset could be operated and maintained at the regimental S-2, provided they have the manning and training available to effectively operate it. If feasible, adopting an existing platform, like the Navy’s MQ-8 or similar platform, would shorten the learning curve for the MLR by reducing procurement costs and tapping into a well of established operational experience. This structure provides the Joint Force a holistic option for organic and external sea-denial kill chains that alleviate the distance and resource constraints that the current MLR structure would suffer from.\n\nConclusion: Sense and Make Sense\n\nAnti-access/area-denial imposes extensive costs on forward basing and ships alike, leaving naval and air forces to fight their way into a Western Pacific conflict under such challenging conditions that ready ISR support to Stand-In Forces will be strained. Without the asset, the MLR will be unable to complete its own sea-denial kill chains, and with it, the MLR can sense and make sense of its own battlespace. The marriage of the MLR’s mobility and survivability and the asset’s scouting capabilities, the PLA is placed in a resource and targeting dilemma that makes for a credible and lethal threat.\n\n>Capt Costello is an Air Support Control Officer and Chinese Foreign Area Officer.

As such, the Marine Corps is also rapidly evolving and transforming—using such critical documents as the Commandant’s Planning Guidance, Force Design 2030, Expeditionary Advanced Based Operations, Training and Education, Talent Management 2030, and Stand-in Forces (SIF) as guiding features to enable our transformation to meet the challenges posed by our strategic enemies.2\n\nAs stated in A Concept for Stand-in Forces, SIF: (1) “reassure the Nation and our allies and partners,” (2) “win the all-domain reconnaissance battle,” (3) “win the all-domain counter-reconnaissance battle, and (4) “intentionally disrupt adversary plans.”3 Specifically, for this article, SIF “disrupt an adversary’s plans at every point on the competition continuum.”4 While individual Marines, tactical units, or the Marine Corps are not tasked with creating strategy, the truth is that we do not expect mere tactical-level results with the SIF concept during times of competition, crisis, and conflict. Rather, we expect impacts on the operational and (preferably) the strategic level of war by our SIF units.\n\nHowever, while we desire and hope for enduring strategic-level results of our SIF, we as an entity generally do not educate our tactical-level Marines on the strategic level of war or strategic competition. As stated in Training and Education 2030, “As we prepare for the future fight, we need Marines who possess the intellectual ability to out-think their adversaries,” and “the most important warfighting advantage we have is the mental and physical endurance of our Marines, and their ability to make better decisions under pressure than our adversaries.”5 Therefore, the purpose of this article is to describe and illustrate strategic competition in a novel manner for our SIF units. As stated in A Concept for Stand-in Forces (ref), “SIF also practice ‘integrated deterrence,’ which means they coordinate their activities with the joint force, interagency, and allied and partnered nations to achieve greater results than could be gained by acting alone.”6 Thus, by arming SIF with knowledge and a conceptual model on strategic competition in outside declared theaters of active armed conflicts (ODTAAC), tactical units have the potential to facilitate strategic objects to a greater extent in ODTAAC environments.\n\nStrategic Environment\n\nFormer Secretary of Defense, Mr. Weinberger, noted that gray-area conflicts are the most likely and most difficult challenges for democracies to face.7 In 2023—with the compression of the three levels of war, in which the tactical individual is closer to the strategic level of war—tactical warfighters must recognize that gray-zone conflicts must be understood as cohesive organized campaigns that typically apply non-military measures to achieve political goals over several years to decades while remaining below the threshold of war. These campaigns are suited for the educated and trained Marine(s) due to our history in small wars (i.e., Banana Wars, combined action platoons, etc). Additionally, history clearly demonstrates that foreign militaries who are seen as a liberation force and not an occupation force, such as a surge of conventional forces, have a higher likelihood of strategic success. Regarding gray-zone conflicts, Mazaar states that gray-zone conflicts are “a pattern of state rivalry that can substitute for traditional military aggression, and which can pose serious challenges to U.S. strategy.”8\n\nAs stated by Jeffrey Record, “the United States has become a victim of its conventional military success.”9 According to Colin Gray, the U.S. war machine can be defined as: (1) apolitical, (2) astrategic, (3) ahistorical, (4), problem-solving, optimistic, (5) culturally ignorant, (6) technologically dependent, (7), firepower focused, (8), large scale, (9), profoundly regular, (10) impatient, (11), logistically excellent, and (12) sensitive to casualties.10 The 2018 National Defense Strategy of the United States of America states, “it is increasingly clear that China and Russia want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model … Rogue regimes such as North Korea and Iran are destabilizing regions through their pursuit.”11 Our strategic adversaries have studied our history and analyzed our strengths and weaknesses and are conducting active measures to domestically and internationally weaken the United States to achieve their national objectives.\n\nAccording to Kilcullen, Chinese military strategists developed a simultaneous dual-pronged strategy; one of economic and political engagement.12 This dual-pronged strategy is in combination with their acceleration of their military competencies. This development appears to be in line with the concepts put forth in Unrestricted Warfare written by the Chinese colonels, Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui. Unrestricted Warfare provides numerous examples of how non-conventional methods can be used against the United States to achieve political goals in a form of hybrid warfare.13 As stated by Hassett,\n\nthe U.S. military is insufficiently postured, trained, and resourced through doctrinal publication guidance to counter current and emerging hybrid threats in the future. Hybrid warfare will continue to serve as an effective operational concept for adversary state and non-state actors in the future.14\n\nThus, education and understanding are paramount for SIF during times of competition.\n\nStrategic Competition\n\nThe principal reason for this article is to describe strategic competition in a novel way in hopes of facilitating strategic impacts in ODTAAC environments by tactical units, primarily SIF units. The terms great-power competition and strategic competition have come to be buzzwords in the U.S. military. While these words are thrown around constantly, few can define great-power competition and even fewer can define strategic competition, despite these words dominating military leaders’ meetings, plans, and actions. As stated by Miller et al., “Competition now permeates nearly every contemporary U.S. strategic document.”15 Miller et al. define competition as “the interaction among actors in pursuit of the influence, leverage, and advantage necessary to secure their respective interests.”16 Additionally, Miller et al. define influence, leverage, and advantage as being “the power to cause an effect in indirect or intangible ways,” “the application of influence gained or created to achieve an effect or exploit an opportunity,” and “the superiority of position or condition,” respectively.17 Using the framework by Miller et al., the author visually displays strategic competition using Figures 1, 2, and 3.\n\nAt the bottom of Figures 1–3, the reader can see that at the base are the competing interests of the United States (blue) and the competing interests of an adversary (red). Miller et al. define interests as “things or concepts that a nation values—those things which states seek to protect or achieve concerning each other.”18 No matter what the United States positively performs when contending in strategic competition, the adversary’s interest will likely not go away. While the number of resources put into the targeted competition in a specific region will vary with the level of interests, it is important to note that the adversary’s general interests will remain a constant over the years; thus, patience and the emphasis on playing the long game must occur in strategic competition.\n\nWe must be cautious not to default to competition as being negative or problematic, especially tactical SIF units. Rather, tactical SIF operators should look at competition as an opportunity: “Competition provides opportunities to achieve outcomes before war, ensure favorable conditions for escalation, and gain advantage in the event of conflict. By building influence with allies, partners, and other actors is critical to producing opportunities in competition.”19\n\nIn Figure 1 (strategic competition- balanced), influence for both nation-states is depicted as equal. Advantage (represented via a triangle) acts as a fulcrum in the diagram, and for Figure 1 on the previous page, the advantage "
