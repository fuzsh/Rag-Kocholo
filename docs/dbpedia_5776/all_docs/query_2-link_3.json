On 15 April 1945, without having been charged or tried, General von Rabenau, one of the last inmates remaining in the Flossenbürg concentration camp, was shot on Himmler's specific orders. The execution order was issued by Gestapo Chief Heinrich Müller with additional orders to report his death as resulting from a low-flying allied air attack.\n\nLink to Wikipedia biography\n\nRelationships\n\nhomicide perpetrator relationship with Himmler, Heinrich (born 7 October 1900).
