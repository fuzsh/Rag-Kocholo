        "text": "FOREWORD [II]\n\nKropotkin had the keenest talent for observing all that is manifest in life. If cyinics and \"practical\" persons see in Kropotkin only the \"naive dreamer\", they ought to be advised to adjust their wisdom, and take a more profound view of this social and economic world which is so rapidly disintegrating, and many of whose old institutions have already crumbled. Kropotkin's ideas have helped do this, and will in the future even more effectually shatter the shameful structure of a society based upon hypocrisy, lies, and robbery.\n\nKropotkin is one of the brightest stars in the firmament of famous revolutionists. In him is seen the ideal rebel exemplified. His long activity in the field of human emancipation sufficiently proves that his life was dedicated to the masses.\n\nTo thoushands upon thousands of readers has his work become a most precious and enduring literature, and not only the ranka nd file, but to a great extent, scientists and liebral professors admire and follow his precepts.\n\nMany of his sociological predictions have become verified. The ideas which he advocated have, through the cupidity of pseudo-revolutionists, received a temporary set-back on the road to freedom. Nevertheless, his own eyes qitnessed the downfall of Russian Czarism, the greatest despotic power an oppressed world has ever inherited. The heart of the old rebel must have overflowed with joy at its achievment. It was one of his \"Utopias\" come true! If what had happened has happened to Russia, of all nations, then Kropotkin's other \"Utopias\" must be earnestly awaited because they are certain of realization.\n\nKropotkin's ideas have struck deep root, and they are striking further and further down, establishing themselves more and more fundamentally, they only await the ripening time which is speedily and inevitably approaching, those liber-\n\n[III] FOREWORD\n\ntarian ideas which have been watered with tears and sweat and blood since the beginning of human slavery.\n\n• • •\n\nThis book, as it here appears, may be criticised by some as an egoistic venture or as the effort of a well-financed individual or group, because of its limited number of copies and its uncommercial form. The fact remains that it is the exclusive expression of a proletarian; neither group nor individual has financed this work. It was accomplished solely through the effort and will of the writer.\n\nHis determination to publish these collected tributes at his personal expense and labor, is his way of honoring the great personality of Kropotkin. He was inspired by Kropotkin's almost unique idealism in a world drenced with the putrid materialism of a hypocritical civilization. The task was by no means a light undertaking. To see so much accumulated material which was gathered from various sources, and to have to sift it down and compress it in book-form, was exceedingly difficult. It was necessary to limit the size and number of pages. Thus many of the articles are fragmentary, and numerous biographical and incidental repetitions which are almost parallel in one way or another, had to be omitted. The unincluded material is voluminous and varied and could easily form several volumes. Kropotkin's articles on revolutionary topics are of the utmost importance. It is the research and creative work of a life-time, which he was too occupied to shape in book-form. Of these are included only a few freagments as a mere illustration, for the greater part remains still buried in the oblivion of scattered papers"
