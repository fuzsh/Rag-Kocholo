        "text": "Political History: To gain an understanding to the historical contexts of past and present radical political thinkers. How does the form of capitalism at a given time period (industrial, post globalized, etc.) effect the feasibility of radical theoretical models of societal organization?\n\nTo learn more about specific historical events of radical theory put into practice, and the effectiveness of the employed strategies.\n\nReading extensive historical texts on the West Virginia Coal Wars (1912-1921), the Paris Commune (1871) and the Haymarket Affair (1886).\n\nThree reflection papers, two to four pages every three weeks, about these events.\n\nWatching documentaries of actions and social movements and biographical documentaries on political thinkers.\n\nKeeping an annotated bibliography of each reading and film.\n\nWeekly seminar via video-chatting with another student reading and studying the same topics.\n\nMy sponsor will evaluate me on reflection papers that will contain a summary of the text, as well as personal inquiry and analysis.\n\nMy sponsor will evaluate my on my annotated bibliography for formatting and quality of summaries.\n\nPolitical Theory: To synthesize, critique, and analyze philosophies as well as proposed models of societal organization other than capitalism of past and contemporary radical political theorists.\n\nListening to speeches and lectures from theorists and radicals, such as Fred Hampton, Emma Goldman, Katherine Gibson, David Harvey, and Noam Chomsky.\n\nWriting two to four page weekly synthesis papers that analyze, parallel, and critique effectiveness of radical theories and people through time and place based on the readings and lectures.\n\nCreating a WordPress site throughout the quarter that will be completed by week 10. The website will encompass the main points that had an impact on my learning.\n\nWeekly seminar via video-chatting with another student reading and studying the same topics. I will be keeping a brief (one-paragraph) log of our discussions.\n\nMy sponsor will evaluate my weekly synthesis papers for cohesive arguments and understanding of lectures and readings.\n\nMy sponsor will evaluate my WordPress site to gauge my ability to meet learning objectives throughout the quarter.\n\nMy sponsor will evaluate me on my brief seminar discussion log, looking specifically for growth and development on ideas between both students participating."
