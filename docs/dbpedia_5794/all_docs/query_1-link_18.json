        "text": "faustus: Just to stick to the focus of the article, I think it has quite a bit to tell us about how our educational system is primarily a terrible system of discipline and how it could be (fairly easily, I think) radically transformed along Deweyite/Freieian lines.\n\nHowever, I do think you’re right, to an extent, about big stuff like vaccination policy or energy supply. But I think it’s precisely here that anarchism’s shouty “smash the state” rhetoric is most incoherent: anarchists don’t actually try and smash the stateâ€”or at least I’ve never met an anarchist who wanted to smash the state so no one could get healthcare anymore (ok, not relevant in the US context, but anarchists in Europe don’t do this). And, after all, what anarchists actually spend all the their time doing is pretty much the opposite of smashing: building mutual aid networks, ensuring that communities are democratically organized, etcâ€”essentially, Landauer’s “internal colonization” that Chris cited.\n\nWhich is to say that there isn’t really a coherent anarchist end goal vision with no state where they’ve thought up how we’re going to do vaccinations and energy infrastructure. That isn’t to say that it isn’t possible to organize those things democratically, but when you begin with horizontal practice and direct action as your first concerns, it’s easier to see how anarchists are comfortable with a kind of compromise: eg, building unalienated spaces in which to live while fighting for universal healthcare or against nuclear power.\n\nObviously, this sort of compromise is always in flux, and, as you say, it’s much harder to imagine this making sense while maintaining (say) the existing industrial division of labor. But this, too, is sort of the point: if the current labor system demands mass alienation, I don’t think that leaves much of a good argument for preserving itâ€”especially when, absent coercion and massive wealth disparities, there’s no technological reason we couldn’t develop tons of robots to do all the dangerous and boring work, freeing up everyone to pursue far more unalienated lives.\n\nIt only â€œknocks away the entire basis for the criminal justice sytemâ€ if you assume in advance that punishment is a â€œwrong,â€ which is what Graeber is supposed to be proving.\n\nWhooooa, that’s the kind of statement that should need no proof. How is the act of punishment not a wrong? You would not want someone to go around inflicting punishment on people. Surely you’d agree that unfair acts of punishment occur somewhat regularly and frequently in the world, and I can say that confidently without knowing precisely what ‘unfair’ means to you.\n\nYou’re assuming contexts in which punishment is not a wrong. But the whole point of the passage is to rob commonplace acts of their context–because the context is perhaps inappropriately exculpatory–and evaluate the acts in isolation.\n\nWhy do this? Maybe we get too used to how we are doing things, by default finding rightness in acts and ordinances that in isolation are cruel and hideous to us. Maybe we find ourselves baffled or upset by behaviors and practices that others take for granted, and seek some grounds on which we could protest those acts and be meaningfully understood. Maybe we’ve discovered that others are baffled by our own taken-for-granted behaviors and practices, and we want to understand them better.\n\nI think you’re replacing the meaning of ‘wrong’ intended by the phrase, with ‘wrong’ as evaluated by your own moral code. But this isn’t a phrase you would normally say to yourself; you say it to a misbehaving kid. Presumably you are saying “two wrongs don’t make a right” to the kid precisely because their behavior was categorically unacceptable — they can’t point to other people’s bad behavior as exculpatory. But notice, to the kid, the punishment they inflicted does not seem wrong. “Tommy took my toy, so I pushed him off down and kicked him.” That’s your kid, punishing Tommy for a wrong. In the kid’s eyes, the punishment is consummate to the crime: “But it’s not wrong! Tommy deserved it!” In reply, you short-circuit this with: No, dear, pushing and kicking people is wrong, so it’s not OK to do that even if you really, truly feel Tommy ‘deserved’ it–two wrongs don’t make a right. The act of pushing and kicking somebody is essentially never OK, even though you personally feel that it would be just desert.\n\nOk, so you can say, that’s only because the subject was a kid, who has a lot to learn. But that’s how the phrase is used. And I don’t think it applies to kids only–violent vigilante justice, and domestic acts of terrorism, come to mind as examples of ‘punishments’ that are almost never OK, even if they feel like just deserts to us in context.\n\nI think that’s an important and too-easily abrogated stage of moral development; apparently, so does Graeber (all I’ve done is recapitulate what’s already there). You can disagree with us… but probably not on the grounds that ‘it really was okay for your kid to push and kick Tommy, because punishment is not a wrong.’\n\nIf you want us to consider context that ‘punishment’ implies, then you have to consider the context in which someone actually utters the phrase “two wrongs don’t make a right” and means something by it. It’s only fair.\n\nI think this comment thread has been fantastic (although I liked the original Chomsky article that has come in for criticsm as well). In general I think the Crooked Timber comments section gets a bum rap (starting with the often peevish reactions to criticism by the front-page posters) and is actually one of the best parts of the site. The occasional trollish derail is a small price to pay for often very well-informed commenters who are willing to be aggressively critical to get a good conversation going rather than just me-too the original post.\n\nChomsky rightly emphasizes those moments when the distinction between discipline and freedom seems to vanish because discipline is a voluntary expression of free desire or communal cooperation. In such moments the distinction seems artificial and discipline seems subsumed under freedom. But I think there is still some degree of tension (summarized by Faustus @9) between discipline and freedom that Chomsky is underplaying. It is true that those in power have an incentive to massively exaggerate this tension in order to preserve/expand their right to discipline others. Without opposition, those in power will radically shrink the spaces in which freedom and discpline are complementary and remove the voluntary aspect of discipline altogether if possible (or at least to the degree that this is compatible with any motivation for underlings). But that doesn’t mean that the tention doesn’t exist. It is present at both the individual level and the level of social order. Learning to discipline yourself is often an important part of realizing even genuine desires — I can’t be the only person here who sometimes has to ‘force’ himself to do repetitive or unpleasant tasks that are associated with a larger goal. (I think it’s telling that Chomsky appears to be a fantastically self-disciplined person who probably does not feel this tension very much). And on the social level even spontaneous cooperation is often underpinned by a larger committment to respect communal decisions even when you don’t like them.\n\nThe relationship between discipline, freedom, and desire strikes me as very subtle and intricate and not well represented by ideological plays that try to reduce any of these polarities to the other…there is both a mutual dependence and sometimes a tension.\n\nChris: thanks, definitely have to checked out the Ward reader. Embarrassingly, I’ve never read his stuff, but AK seems to have some kind of awesome sale right now.\n\nPGD: I think the way you use discipline here already assumes a bit too much. From a sufficiently abstract perspective, playing video games, reading a book, and writing a paperâ€”or, hell, my writing this responseâ€”are all equivalent tasks, at least in the sense that they require work and time. But social contextâ€”and, for my purposes, especially alienationâ€”is what determines how you experience those tasks. Video games can become wage labor if you’re employed to test them; caring for children, as another comment pointed out, can vary wildly from demeaning and disgusting to ennobling and rewarding; even writing this post can be play (or procrastination) if I have to write a (very, very) late paper right now, but note the ridiculousness of this: I am writing to avoid the identical task of writing. Even the distinction here between work and play seems very unstable to me, at least for present purposes; rather, the crucial distinction is between alienated and unalienated work and play.\n\nTo give another personal example, last fall, the first time I visited Liberty Square in NYC, I found myself picking up picking up trash and helping out with Sanitation within a couple of hours. It’s hard to overstate just how deeply bizarre this kind of behavior is in New York: you never, ever pick up trash in New York (or talk to strangers or do any of the other things that became the fabric of normal life in that park for two short months last year). But picking up trash on Anarres has virtually nothing in common with picking up trash on Urras.\n\nI don’t think this makes me a “fantastically self-disciplined person.” In fact, I’m pretty sure all of my professors were laugh in disbelief at that suggestion. But think of the material work of, say, being an activist: hard manual labor, running in the streets, carrying heavy things, childcare, sitting in endless meetings, writing emailsâ€”in short: labor, most of it stuff we spend most of our time trying desperately to avoid in professional/academic life. Certainly, there is activist burnoutâ€”but this is only more to the point: activists don’t burnout because they hate what they’re doing. They generally burnout because they take on too much, entirely of their own volition, for no reason other than that it needs to be done. And for the many activists who don’t burnout, this work isn’t experienced as the drudgery it would have been had they been employed to do it. I found answering emails for Strike Debt really rewarding where I imagine I would’ve hated more or less the exact same job in even a liberal/left leaning NGO.\n\nThis, I think, is what makes alienation the crucial factor.\n\nbianca: I may be reading other Chomsky stuff I’ve read into this interview (I’ve, uh, procrastinated too much to go back and look), or just as likely I’m reading other anarchist writers into it, so you may well be right. I’m also not familiar with your Papert/Feynman example, so I can’t really comment there.\n\nI do think, though, there there is at least an implicit idea of play as developmentally crucial, especially in his personal narrative of starting in Deweyite school in which play and work weren’t really that distinguishable (for reasons I elaborated on above). To the point, whether a five year old sits down with the collected works of Shakespeare or figures out how to play baseball with his friends without any formal structures, both are kind of goalless, unpredictable, purposelessâ€”but are radically different from being forced to sit down and read a giant tome in a public school classroom or told how to play baseball in a formal league.\n\nThis also has some personal resonance for me, because I started in a Deweyite/Freireian school as a little kid, and it fucking ruined me for formal hierarchical education in pretty a similar way.\n\nSpeaking of being ruined for school, gonna have to check out of this thread; way behind on alienated academic labor.\n\nLiberty60: your comments (and those of some others here) strike me as rather misconceived. First, note that you’ve moved the goalposts from “no natural constituency outside academia” to claiming that most self-described anarchists have a tertiary education. As it happens, a rather large proportion of the population now has a tertiary education so that’s a rather different claim to the jibe that anarchism is the preserve of pointy-headed intellectuals. But what people like Ward were keen to do was not to preach anarchism as a doctrine according to which the state would be directly confronted and overthrown by some mass anarchist movement. Rather, they argued that elements of anarchy (free association, mutual aid, etc) are present within our societies and that these extra-statist forms of communal organization should be encouraged . That’s why Ward spend much of his life writing about children’s play, allotments, squatters movement etc. Almost certainly, most of the people who participated in, say, squatters’ movements did not think of themselves as anarchists, but for Ward they are part of anarchy nonetheless.\n\nMany of the individual elements of Ward’s (and Landauer’s and Kropotkin’s and Scott’s…) thought can be learnt from by non-anarchists (like me). But I think it wrong to say that there is no connection between their anarchism and the good things they write about that we can acknowledge. Like it or not, that egalitarian liberal (Rawlsian) and the social democrat have a project of social transformation that involves using the democratic state to organize and regulate so as best to realize egalitarian principles of justice. Extra-legal forms of activity and self-organization don’t really get a look-in in that vision which, as a consequence, has a bureaucratic and administrative feel to it. It also has the defect of focusing on the moment of transformation (the social democrats take power) after which a legislative programme can be enacted that puts the principles into operation. But like Godot, the moment never comes, and social democratic (or Democrat) administrations normally find themselves too hemmed in by circumstances to achieve much (exceptions being the New Deal in the 1930s, or British Labour in 1945).\n\nDo you really doubt that much of the science behind vaccination was developed by people who were freely seeking to understand the world better, as opposed to following orders or pursuing some personal advantage? Do you really doubt that vaccination and other public health programs only work today of the genuine personal desire of the people administering them for them to be successful, as opposed to external incentives?\n\nI think “as opposed to” is doing a lot of work here — rather, the systems you describe are as successful as they are precisely because people are able to align their personal desires with their interests and do well by doing good. Otherwise they would likely have been obliged to do what they had to do rather than what they wanted to do.\n\nAnd I do think at least some of the drug/medical paraphernalia factory workers and pharmacists’ assistants (to say nothing of the transport networks, utilities, etc. without which neither the labs nor the pharmacies and clinics could continue functioning) probably are just punching a clock to collect a paycheck without any deep personal satisfaction in their jobs; fortunately, that isn’t really a problem as long as they do a decent job while they’re on the clock.\n\nISTM that the opportunity for some to do work they are emotionally invested in is, ultimately, founded on the existence of lots of people who do jobs that nobody really wants to do, but must nevertheless be done for society to function. That’s where the analogy to Omelas comes in (although it, like all analogies, goes only so far): the happiness of some is ultimately grounded on the suffering[*] of others and this is a necessary part of the system without which it will cease to function. Omelas is taking this property to the extreme (literal torture of a child) for illustrative purposes and that means the analogy must not be overstrained, but in real societies there is no walking away from the proletariat.\n\n[*] The extent to which drudge-workers actually suffer at their jobs is highly variable based on the political choices made by a society, but anyone spending a substantial portion of their day at a job that isn’t fulfilling or enjoyable is probably suffering to at least some degree even if they *do* make a living wage, have job security, have safety measures to reduce their on-the-job injuries as much as practicable, can access health care when needed, aren’t continually tyrannized/bullied/humiliated by supervisors, etc.\n\n@Liberty60\n\nI would add that I have also known anarchists who are not white and college educated, some having come from distinctly poor backgrounds, in both the SF Bay Area and Seattle. Not so many trade-union anarchists, other than some involved in the IWW in some small-shop organizing (they were usually pretty against the big mainstream unions).\n\nfaustnotes is correct that anarchists frequently focus more on the “lumpen” than in the usual “working class.” You will find a lot of anarchists around organizations like Food Not Bombs (feeding homeless), Books to Prisoners, et. al.\n\nThe charge of choosing to remain fringe is not entirely true, but neither is it entirely false. One aspect of anarchism (in the US at least) is that it attracts people who are often very distrustful of authority figures and bureaucratic organizations in general. Thus they tend to be distrustful of any organization that seems to be in a position of having too much success, and thus taking too much power. This distrust is often accentuated because their â€œconstituencyâ€, so to speak, is often the very same people who fall outside the realm of larger, more successful organizations â€“ the chronically unemployed, homeless, people in prisons, et al. Many anarchists are most comfortable on the fringe in part because they see the “collateral damage” from more successful organizations.\n\nComplicating it a little further is the fact that some people who gravitate towards anarchism are dealing with some pretty significant psychological issues with authority. Some folks I knew in the Seattle anarchist scene came from horrifically abusive families, and had a very difficult time with any sort of authority or restriction. They also had difficulty separating basic health and hygiene from abuse and corruption (I can remember some who were horrified by the bourgeois suggestion that it was a bad idea to source food for a benefit dinner by dumpster diving). Even the democratic decision of a collective could be an abuse trigger, which would then be turned into accusations of authoritarianism. As a result, they were really, really difficult to deal with in any sort of organization (I suspect this was partly what Bruce @ 12 was encountering).\n\nPsychological/social issue like this in organizations and politics is hardly unique to anarchists, and in no way invalidates the broader political movement (in fact, I suspect that many if not most people gravitate toward certain political positions or styles of organizing for equally individual reason â€“ the personal is the political, and the political is often the personal). But I think they do play a big role in the character of many anarchist organizations, at least in the US.\n\nChris B. @100: Lest it not be obvious, the chris who seems to think that the amount of crappy work in an economy is invariant is not me.\n\nMore straw. There’s a long middle ground between “invariant” and “abolishable”. But of course the former is *much* more convenient to argue against.\n\nMarginal reductions in the amount of crappy work may well be worthwhile. But IMO we shouldn’t delude ourselves into thinking we can reduce it to zero. Crappy work will continue existing and someone will have to do it. Therefore we have to think about how to decide who will do it, and how to compensate them for the crappiness of it (if everyone else is happy craftsmen).\n\nJWM @99: Incidentally I did not use the phrase â€œdefenders of the system.â€\n\nTrue. That phrase actually belonged to Ktotwf at comment 93. When you subsequently said in comment 96 “But I think Ktotwf is right” I interpreted that to mean you thought Ktotwf was right, but maybe you meant he/she was right about something else entirely. I was responding somewhat loosely to multiple people, so I suppose it’s worthwhile to take this chance to clear up the attributions.\n\nIn any case, there’s a big difference (IMO) between skepticism about how much improvement over the status quo is possible, and defending the status quo as the best of all possible worlds. I reject the label “defender of the system” regardless of who attempts to apply it to me, because there are a lot of things I don’t like about the system as it stands.\n\nI don’t claim that the system is already at maximum improvement — only that I expect maximum improvement to be well short of perfection. And I have little (perhaps too little) patience with what I see as pie in the sky.\n\nChomsky (as quoted in JWM @98): Or just plain physical labour â€“ thatâ€™s also gratifying. If you work on command then of course itâ€™s just drudgery but if you do the very same thing out of your own will or interest itâ€™s exciting and interesting and appealing.\n\nMaybe to some people some of the time. Not to enough people about enough tasks to actually get the drudgery done. I don’t really believe Chomsky finds his laundry exciting just because he does it of his own will — and if someone else does it for him, it’s even harder for me to believe *that* person finds it exciting. (So yes, alienation does have some power. But there are still some tasks that are drudgery whether alienated or not.)\n\nBut even if there is some group of people who find laundry exciting, and even if Chomsky is one of them, I doubt there are enough of them to go around. And if not laundry, there’s plenty of tasks even more unpleasant than that which people have to do (for pay or otherwise) every day.\n\nI’m honestly surprised to encounter this much pushback to returning Chomsky to earth regarding the overlooked drudgery all around us and taking up part of all our daily lives.\n\nWow, nice strawman. â€œAffected the quality of workâ€ is such a low bar it would be practically impossible not to get over it.\n\nWhat an absurd thing to say, chris. You said: No society in history has ever succeeded in eliminating or even drastically reducing the amount of unpleasant work;\n\nJWM responded, You really believe this? The end of feudalism, the emancipation of the slaves, the labor movement, social democracy —\n\nAnd you reply by complaining about a few pithy words that came after that dash? Whyyy?\n\nDo you really, honestly feel that JWM was not attempting in good faith to give you four examples of occurrences in which societies succeeded in drastically reducing the amount of unpleasant work?\n\nDo you really, honestly feel that “the end of feudalism, the emancipation of the slaves, the labor movement, social democracy” are not four examples in which societies succeeded in drastically reducing the amount of unpleasant work?\n\n(I willfully condensed “eliminating or drastically reducing” to “drastically reducing” — I make note of this just in case you’re inclined to complain that I modified your wording.)\n\nThere’s a reasonable case to be made in the direction you’re aiming, but complaining about low-bar claims and then saying “I expect maximum improvement to be well short of perfection” is asinine. Obvs, any realizable reality is well short of perfection. The question is whether it’s possible for everyone in a society to have, in their own estimation, a flourishing life, on balance. And what would that look like? That doesn’t mean that 100% of your energy is invested into creative pursuits. It hopefully means that you can spend substantially more time and energy in the week on your creative pursuits than you expend on things you find tediously drudgerous.\n\nIs there any reason to believe we could limit each person’s drudgerous and exhausting work to two full days (eh let’s say 16 hours) per week, allowing each person a great deal more time and energy to invest into pursuits they’ll find more fulfilling? Maybe, maybe not, but who cares about the pithy point that 16 hours/week of drudgery is nonzero and therefore not perfect? Chomsky doesn’t care. JWM doesn’t care. I don’t care. Nobody fuckin’ cares, dude. We’re all okay with everyone having to do some drudgery, and we share the assumption that an ideal society would compensate people who take on more drudgery, well enough to ensure they’re satisfied and happy with taking on an extra couple workdays per week.\n\nIf you found some sentences that makes you feel that we care about whether we can actually achieve zero hours not spent in complete freedom, let them go and let it go. If you want to argue that no society will be able to allow everybody to retain enough time and energy to invest in pursuits of their choosing, there’s a case to be made, but make the case instead of complaining about semantics. If you want to argue that no society will be able to spread drudgery work roughly equitably, there’s a case to be made there, but maaaake it thennnnn.\n\nIt looks like most other participants in this thread have a, well, drastically lower bar for what constitutes “drastically reducing”, so maybe I shouldn’t have said that, since it seems everyone else just interpreted it as “reducing” and then pointed out all the cases where drudgery has been reduced.\n\nWhich I never argued that it hadn’t been (or that it couldn’t be in the future). Confusion ensued.\n\nSalient @105: Thereâ€™s a long middle ground between marginal reductions and reductions to zero.\n\nRight, and I only ever argued the impossibility of the latter. Seems you’re making my point for me; that long middle ground is between me (reduction is possible, but not to zero, so the plight of the drudgeworker remains as an issue needing consideration in any achievable society) and straw-me (no improvement is possible, the status quo is the best of all possible worlds and must be defended).\n\nSalient @104: Do you really, honestly feel that â€œthe end of feudalism, the emancipation of the slaves, the labor movement, social democracyâ€ are not four examples in which societies succeeded in drastically reducing the amount of unpleasant work?\n\nYes. I would describe them instead as some reduction, some rearrangement, and a lot of old wine in new bottles. See the working class? They’re still there, under another name. The material conditions of workers have improved, thanks partly to technology and partly to social changes. And nobody doubts that the end of slavery was important. But social democracy has not gotten people to stop pushing mops or scrubbing toilets while living in subsistence conditions — it just means they now own their cheap clothes and rent their run-down apartments and buy their low-quality food (sometimes having to borrow at ludicrous rates against their next paycheck to do so) instead of being issued them by their lord/owner/the company store; and God help them if they get sick, because nobody else will. They’re free people who have to take personal responsibility for their own lives, don’t you know.\n\nMany, many people still spend most of every day doing drudge work, even though the institutions that compel them to do so have changed.\n\nIt’s hard enough to believe that we could someday in the future achieve a society without large numbers of people living by drudgery (it would be great if we could even get it below a majority!), but sheesh, if you think we’re already there, you really don’t know the right people, and haven’t held the right jobs.\n\nJWM @107: The exact same task can be tedious, unpleasant, degrading when done under orders from someone else but very satisfying when done of oneâ€™s own choice.\n\nWell, this may be the real meat of the disagreement. Yes, in theory, that could happen, but I think it is likely to be rare, compared to the tedious and unpleasant tasks that remain tedious and unpleasant regardless of who makes the decision when and how to do them. That’s why the idea that dealienation could remove all need for tedious, unpleasant work strikes me as far-fetched.\n\nLet’s leave housework for a minute and consider, say, mopping the floor of a hospital. (I assume we can all agree it must be done with some minimum frequency for sanitary/safety reasons.) Do you expect the doctors to enjoy mopping their own hospital and derive personal satisfaction from it? I don’t; if you put a mop and bucket in the doctors’ lounge and expected the mopping to get done voluntarily there’d be a round of “I didn’t go through medical school for this” jokes and then dirty floors, unless someone has the authority to write a schedule and compel them to keep it. Ditto the nursing staff. So someone else has to be brought in and hired to mop the floor.\n\nThey could be paid a decent wage, with benefits, and job security, and a retirement plan, in some other society than the one we have now. But they’d still be living by mopping floors, not following the dreams of their heart.\n\nThis remains true regardless of whether the hospital is owned by a corporation, the government, a nonprofit organization, or the doctors and nurses as a collective; in all those cases, none of the people with actual health care skills wants to waste those skills mopping the floor. Maybe, in the nonprofit case, you could find someone who valued the contribution they were able to make to the nonprofit’s cause. Would you want to count on that?\n\nSteven’s story is interesting, but I wouldn’t bet on it generalizing widely enough to fill the needs of whole societies. He doesn’t even follow the story to its end — once he voluntarily picks up the garbage and, most likely, puts it in a garbage can, where does it go from there, without a city employee (I presume, since it was a park) to take the garbage cans to the landfill?\n\nFor that matter, where do the garbage cans come from? Some hobbyist handcrafter of garbage cans? Do you really think there will be enough of those to let the society get by without garbage can factories (especially considering handcrafters’ much lower output per man-hour, which is after all why all these industrial methods were invented)? Ditto the garbage *trucks*, which I defy anyone to handcraft without access to factory-made parts and machine tools (although they would certainly be justified in taking pride in their accomplishment if they did!).\n\nEvery day people interact with dozens, if not hundreds of products made by alienated labor. Most, if not all, of which would be impossible, impractical, or vastly less efficient to be made solely by people who enjoyed making them, acting on their own initiative with nobody giving orders. Are you suggesting giving up technological society and all its benefits? Or, if not, who makes and distributes and cleans all the things that are no fun to make and distribute and clean? (An earlier draft of this sentence included “fix”, but some people enjoy fixing things, so I’ll spot you the people who fix everything that needs fixing. Although they still need parts, and tools, and transportation to the work site, and means of communication so they can find people who have things that need fixing…)\n\nIt seems unlikely that this is because making cars and aircraft is universally easier than picking fruit, and therefore easier to automate.\n\nActually, that seems completely likely to me. The fruit grows wherever it feels like and you have to perceive it before you can pick it. “Perception is hard” is one of the earliest and most stubborn results in robotics. It intuitively seems easy to humans because we have a highly developed instinct for it, but if you’re trying to design a robot to find the fruit on a tree, I’m pretty sure that’s still well beyond the current state of the art. If you want to pick only the *ripe* fruit and leave the unripe fruit on the tree to be picked next week, that’s even worse. The fact that this requires no “specialized training” from a human perspective does not, at all, make it easy for a robot.\n\nAssembly lines, by contrast, can (and do) put all the parts in prearranged locations so the robot can just do a preset series of motions and hit the part every time.\n\nLaundry under current technology is actually a not too bad example of the limits of automation: it’s the human’s responsibility to put the laundry and detergent in a prearranged location (inside the machine) because the machine is helpless to do those things for itself. It’s the human’s responsibility to select an appropriate set of wash settings because the machine can’t perceive what kind of laundry is inside it and deduce what settings are appropriate for it. It’s also the human’s responsibility to fold the laundry afterwards if they want it folded, because that’s a task too difficult to automate (although trivial from a human perspective).\n\nAs for the supervisor of a fleet of mopping robots, I thought about that, but wouldn’t that inherently lead to *more* alienation rather than less? Who is emotionally invested in acres of flooring spread out among 50 different buildings? And someone has to manufacture robot parts, which is back to the assembly line. (Of course, under capitalism, most of the profits will go to the business owner, and as little as possible to the robot herder. But sweeping away the institutions of capitalism is the least of the obstacles standing in the way of the hobbyist’s utopia.)"
