        "text": "The MIT Press (1997, 1998) This biography describes the intellectual and political milieus that helped shape Noam Chomsky, a pivotal figure in contemporary linguistics, politics, cognitive psychology, and philosophy. It also presents an engaging political history of the last several decades, including such events as the Spanish Civil War, the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the march on the Pentagon to protest the Vietnam War. The book highlights Chomsky's views on the uses and misuses of the university as an institution, his assessment of useful political engagement, and his doubts about postmodernism. Because Chomsky is given ample space to articulate his views on many of the major issues relating to his work, both linguistic and political, this book reads like the autobiography that Chomsky says he will never write. Barsky's account reveals the remarkable consistency in Chomsky's interests and principles over the course of his life. The book contains well-placed excerpts from Chomsky's published writings and unpublished correspondence, including the author's own years-long correspondence with Chomsky.\n\nMany of those people vaguely familiar with Noam Chomsky's political stance, notably his anarchy, would find it difficult to imagine what relationship might exist between Noam Chomsky and The Law.[1] The reasons for this reflect misconceptions about anarchy, which lead people to associate it quite specifically with lawlessness; chaos, violence, destruction, and challenges to authority (including the police and other representatives of state order). Other people may have heard Chomsky's political lectures, which often contain references, generally positive, to international law, rule of law, domestic law, and specific legal remedies that rely upon documents such as the Bill of Rights, the US Constitution, the Declaration of Rights and Freedoms, as well as a range of United Nations resolutions and international laws. Despite the problems inherent in the status quo, it does have these mechanisms which, if followed would cut down on some of the misery of the world. \"Choice of policy is determined by the goals that are sought. [For example,] if the goal had been to secure Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, settle regional issues, and move towards a more decent world, then Washington would have followed the peaceful means prescribed by international law: sanctions and diplomacy. If the goal is to firm up the mercenary-enforcer role and establish the rule of force, then the Administration policy of narrowing the options to capitulation or war has a certain chilling logic.[2] Finally, there are the personal anecdotes about Chomsky, including those that emanate from widely-reproduced articles such as \"Noam is an Island\", by Jay Parini (Mother Jones October 1988), in which Parini expresses his surprise at the care that Chomsky takes in crossing the street, and his respect for traffic laws generally. I would suggest that Chomsky is wholly consistent in his views of law, and that a critical source for understanding his approach is, yet again, found in the writings of Rudolf Rocker, notably in the 1933 book Nationalism and Culture, if only because it indicates how a link between Cartesian thinking of the type that Chomsky has long upheld and the anarchist society to which he aspires could be made.[3] I will therefore begin with references to Rocker and the law as a means of unearthing them basic values that underwrite Chomsky's anarchist approach to law, discuss current debates relating thereto, notably discussions concerning the rule of law, and then turn to some specific examples in Chomsky's writings to illuminate the uses he makes of this work."
