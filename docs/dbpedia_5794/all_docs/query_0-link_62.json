        "text": "3. Noam Chomsky – A Radical Linguist, Philosopher, Activist and one of world’s most foremost intellectuals. – Known for evisceration of American Foreign Policy, State Capitalism and Mainstream Media. – A Formidable and Unapologetic Critic of established Authority. – A Professor of Linguistics.\n\n4. On Anarchism: An Overview – The book sheds light on Chomsky’s thoughts, specifically his constant questioning of legitimacy of entrenched power. – The book is a collection of Chomsky’s essays and interviews which give us insight to Chomsky’s version of Anarchism.\n\n5. Anarchism is a living being – Chomsky refuses to accept Anarchism as a fixed idea. – He says, it is a living and evolving tradition. – He also sheds light on the traditional fault lines between Anarchism and Socialism. – He emphasizes on the power of collective action rather than Individual.\n\n6. Chomsky’s views – Chomsky focuses on Libertarianism, Socialism and Anarchism. – Soviet Union was not a socialist or a communist but a totalitarian. – The difference between right wing and left wing dictatorship: – In Left Wing, State is property owner. – In Right Wing, foreigners are property owner.\n\n7. Economy over People – Citing Tocqueville, Chomsky says that Governments prefer the right of property over right of individual. – Example is Bill of Rights came two years after Constitution in US. – Chomsky says that US operates under State Capitalism just as Soviet Union operates under State Socialism.\n\n8. No Free Market Exists – The idea of Free Market in US is “BALONEY”. – America has a planned economy. – States do not rely on market but on tax dollars. – The Difference between American, Asian and Russian Success Stories is the amount of state centralization and bureaucracy. – The Soviet System although proved inefficient, did provide safety net for people.\n\n9. Problems of Today’s Democracy – In Democracy, the power should lie not just formally with population but actually in the people. – People are losing control of Governments – Politicians court corporations and favor their interests – People hate tax but want roads, schools and military force – In a welfare state, every child should have right to food, healthcare and education.\n\n10. Freedom – Adam Smith, champion of free market, believed that people should be free – Free from authoritarian government and institutions – Chomsky argues that Smith is opposite of Capitalism – According to him, people’s character involve sympathy, solidarity and the right to control their own work.\n\n11. Chomsky as an Idealist – Chomsky admits that his ideas may not be entirely possible today. – He argues in 18th century political democracy was a dream yet it exists today. – Chomsky believes that change can happen"
