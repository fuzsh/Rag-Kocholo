        "text": "Katy Perry has been live streaming her album release weekend from a highly stylized and undisclosed location in Los Angeles. Following the last day of her production, the singer has revealed the location of her weekend residence as the Kim Sing Theatre in Chinatown. The dynamic event space was transformed into her avant-garde hideaway with the help of interior designer, Sally Breer from Etc. For Short. From this space, Katy shared her life with the world from meditation and yoga classes, to casual conversations with stars like Neil Degrasse Tyson, Gordon Ramsey, America Ferrera and Anna Kendrick. After the marathon livestream, a pop-up shop with all of her new merchandise was unveiled to the public, along with a tour of the actual residence. The shop ran for three days and offered Katy Perry fans and architectural admirers alike the opportunity to be a witness."
