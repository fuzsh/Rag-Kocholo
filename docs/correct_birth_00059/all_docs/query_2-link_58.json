Perry's first chart-topper, it's a startling turnabout from just seven years earlier, when she was a gospel singer recording under her real name: Katy Hudson.More\n\nTeenage Dream, Katy Perry's second major-label album, is released. It goes to #1 in the US, where the first five singles, starting with \"California Gurls,\" all top the Hot 100.\n\nKaty Perry launches her worldwide California Dreams Tour in support of her Teenage Dream album, starting in Lisbon, Portugal, where she transforms the venue into a candy-coated wonderland. \"It's very kitsch,\" she says. \"I'm borrowing from The Wizard of Oz, Alice In Wonderland, Black Swan, Pee Wee's Big Adventure and a little John Waters. People are raising the bar so you either have to get to that level or you're out of the game.\"\n\n\"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" by Katy Perry hits #1 on the Hot 100, making her just the second artist with five #1 singles from the same album (Teenage Dream). The other five-time chart topper: Michael Jackson's Bad.\n\nRussell Brand files to divorce Katy Perry, citing irreconcilable differences. According to Perry, she finds out the next day when he texts her the news.\n\n\"The One That Got Away\" from Katy Perry's album Teenage Dream hits #1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart, making the album the first in history with seven #1s on that tally.\n\nWith one day to go until the United States presidential election, dozens of music stars take to the press to support incumbent Barack Obama over Republican challenger Mitt Romney.

This should come as no surprise, as music celebrities traditionally come out to support the progressive candidate in elections.\n\nAt the People's Choice Awards, One Direction win Favorite Album (Up All Night) and Favorite Song (\"What Makes You Beautiful\"). Katy Perry gets Favorite Music Video (\"Part of Me\"), Favorite Female Artist, Favorite Pop Artist, and Favorite Music Fan Following for her fan club, the Katycats.\n\nKaty Perry performs her songs \"Roar\" and \"Rise\" on the final night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.
