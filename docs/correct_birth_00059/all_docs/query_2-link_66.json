        "text": "Katy Perry made her Capitol Records debut with 2008's \"One of the Boys\" after signing to the label in 2007. She cemented her status as a global superstar with the follow-up album \"Teenage Dream\" (2010), which made her the only female artist (tied with Michael Jackson) to have five No. 1 singles from one album on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (\"California Gurls,\" \"Teenage Dream,\" \"Firework,\" \"E.T.\" and \"Last Friday Night\"). \"PRISM,\" her 2013 album, debuted at No. 1 on iTunes in 100 countries and has sold 15 million adjusted albums worldwide. With the singles \"Roar,\" \"Firework\" and \"Dark Horse,\" each surpassing the 10 million threshold including song sales and streams, Perry became the first artist to earn three RIAA Digital Single Diamond Awards. She is one of only five artists in history to have topped 100 million certified units with their digital singles â€“ and the first-ever Capitol Records recording artist to join the elite RIAA 100 Million Certified Songs club.\n\nHer fourth studio album, \"WITNESS,\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200 and No. 1 on iTunes in 46 countries. The certified 2X platinum lead single \"Chained To The Rhythm\" has over 1.75 billion streams worldwide; views on the accompanying video made her the most-viewed female artist on VEVO. Globally, it has achieved more than 6.5 billion cumulative streams and sold 4 million adjusted albums.\n\nHer summer 2019 single \"Never Really Over\" off her latest album \"SMILE\" is certified gold and was the biggest streaming launch of Perry's musical career. 2020's \"SMILE\" release has sold over 1.25 million adjusted albums, with nearly 2 billion combined streams to date.\n\nIn her 12 years with Capitol, Perry has racked up a cumulative 50 billion streams alongside worldwide sales of over 47.5 million adjusted albums and 135 million tracks. She was also the first to reach 100 million followers on Twitter. Her 2015 Super Bowl performance is the highest rated in the event's history. She was the first female artist to have four videos surpass a billion views each. Her videos for \"Firework,\" \"Last Friday Night\" and \"Bon Appetit\" have over 1 billion views, while \"Dark Horse\" has surpassed the 2 billion mark. \"Roar\" now has over 3 billion views.\n\nAside from being one of the bestselling musical artists of all time, Perry is an active advocate of many philanthropic causes. In 2013, she was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador as a result of her commitment to improving the lives of children worldwide. From traveling to Vietnam and Madagascar to highlight the needs of some of the world's most vulnerable children, to empowering girls and supporting adolescents living with HIV/AIDS, as well as raising awareness for UNICEF's emergency relief efforts, Perry has used her powerful voice to advocate for children and support UNICEF's mission to ensure every child's right to health, education, equality and protection. She was awarded with the Audrey Hepburn Humanitarian Award in 2016.\n\nPerry has also been a champion for LGBTQ+ equality. She has received numerous awards for her work including the Trevor Project's Hero Award in 2012, the Human Rights Campaign's National Equality Award in 2017 and amfAR's Award of Courage in 2018. She has also performed at various events to raise funds for the fight against HIV/AIDS including 2009's Life Ball and 2016's amfAR Cannes Gala."
