        "text": "Topline\n\nKaty Perry’s single “Woman’s World”—her long-awaited return to music—has been clouded with bad reviews and controversy after the pop star was called a “hypocrite” for collaborating with embattled producer Dr. Luke, who was sued by singer Kesha for sexual assault, though he’s denied the allegation.\n\nKey Facts\n\nWhy Is It Controversial For Katy Perry To Work With Dr. Luke?\n\nIn 2014, Kesha accused Dr. Luke of sexual and physical assault in a since-dismissed lawsuit, though Dr. Luke has denied these allegations. This caused Dr. Luke to file a countersuit accusing Kesha of defamation, though the two settled out of court. In texts to Lady Gaga that were revealed in court, Kesha accused Dr. Luke of raping Perry, though both Dr. Luke and Perry denied this claim. Several artists like Pink and Kelly Clarkson have vowed to stand in solidarity with Kesha and never work with Dr. Luke again. Actress Abigail Breslin seemingly called Perry out for working with Dr. Luke in an X post on Wednesday. “Working with known abusers in any industry just contributes to the narrative that men can do abhorrent shit and get away with it,” Breslin wrote. “On another note, I love @KeshaRose and she gave one of the best shows ive ever been to last year <3 stream Kesha!” Breslin later said she received death threats for the post. Perry was labeled a “hypocrite” by Pitchfork for collaborating on a feminist song with Dr. Luke. The Cut also criticized Perry for working with Dr. Luke, saying in its review “she’s so pro-woman, in fact, she rehired Dr. Dr. Luke, the embattled producer behind some of her biggest hits, whom she had ceased working with following allegations that he sexually assaulted Kesha, once her friend.”\n\nKey Background\n\nPerry and Dr. Luke have worked together for over a decade, and he’s co-produced eight of her nine Billboard No. 1 hits. He received two Grammy nominations for collaborating on Perry’s work: One in 2011 for “Album of the Year” for her album “Teenage Dream,” and another in 2014 for “Song of the Year” for Perry’s song “Roar.”\n\nTangent\n\nOther’s online have pointed to Perry’s support of billionaire Rick Caruso during his 2022 run for Los Angeles Mayor as another contradiction to her “Woman’s World” message. Caruso was a longtime Republican-turned-Democrat who lost the election to now-Mayor Karen Bass, and was criticized by liberals for previously donating to anti-abortion organizations and politicians. Perry posted a picture to Instagram of her at a voting booth with Caruso’s name selected and the caption “I am voting for a myriad of reasons (see the news) but in particular because Los Angeles is a hot mess atm.” She has since turned the comments off on the post.\n\nForbes Valuation\n\nForbes estimated Perry was worth $340 million in September 2023, calling her one of the richest self-made women in the U.S.\n\nFurther Reading"
