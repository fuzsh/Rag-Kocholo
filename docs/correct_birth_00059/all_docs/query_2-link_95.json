        "text": "Katy Perry proclaims it’s a “Woman’s World” in the extravagant music video for her upcoming “143” album’s first single. On Thursday, the single was released alongside a cinematic video that sees Perry dressed as both Rosie the Riveter and a bionic woman.\n\n“Fire in her eyes / Feminine divine / She was born to shine,” Perry sings as a crew of dancers surround her in the first half of the clip. The dancers and Perry wave around props one would find “living in a woman’s world”: women’s vitamins, whiskey for women, and skin care and wellness tools galore.\n\nAfter getting crushed by a massive anchor, Perry wakes up with bionic legs to a world of destruction with cameos from internet celebrities including Trisha Paytas.\n\nPerry’s upcoming sixth studio album, her first since 2020’s “Smile,” will be released on Sept. 20. Perry’s return to music comes after the singer wrapped her Play residency in Las Vegas, and after her seven-season stint as a judge on “American Idol.”\n\nOn July 10, Perry officially unveiled “143” with the album’s futuristic album artwork. “143” is code for “I love you,” often used in the early 1990s in messages sent on pagers. In a press release, Perry said she “set out to create a bold, exuberant, celebratory dance-pop album with the symbolic 143 numerical expression of love as a throughline message.”\n\nPerry has been teasing bits of “Woman’s World” since her initial announcement in June on TikTok. It was eventually revealed that the single was largely produced by Dr. Luke, who helped craft two of her most commercially successful albums to date (“Teenage Dream” and “Prism”). The move sparked a lot of controversy, considering “Woman’s World” is all about female empowerment, and Dr. Luke was accused of sexually, physically and emotionally abusing his former artist, Kesha.\n\n“143” is also said to include previous collaborators of Perry’s like Stargate, Max Martin, and Sarah Hudson, according to Rolling Stone.\n\nWatch the video for “Woman’s World” below."
