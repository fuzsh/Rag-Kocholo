        "text": "She makes us feel good\n\nThe mark of a good pop song is whether or not you can disappear into a world where you're the star of the show, and Katy Perry's songs give us that sensation every single time. Whether you're belting along to \"Legendary Lovers\" or dancing to \"Teenage Dream\", you're the star of the ball and Katy Perry is your fairy godmother.\n\nKaty is a living pop icon\n\nIf you were asked to name 5 Katy Perry songs on the spot, it would probably be the easiest thing you did all day. Hit after hit, Perry never fails to deliver.\n\nShe worked hard to get to where she is\n\nShe pulled herself out of poverty, was dropped by multiple labels, moved to a city she knew nothing about on her own at a very young age, and never stopped pushing for her dream career. If she never showed such perseverance, we wouldn't have her amazing hits on our party playlists!\n\nThe Cube Hat\n\nPerry's outfit for the 2011 VMAs included a hat that was literally just a yellow cube with a corner \"sunk\" into her head.\n\nThe Boxer\n\nFor her pugnacious performance at the 2013 VMAs, Perry went onstage in a boxing-inspired outfit, including lace-up flats, flame-print athletic shorts, and a leopard-print crop top."
