        "text": "Sheâs the dream girl. The free spirit. The candy-coated pinup and the well of inner strength. Sheâs a little Disney, a little Betty Boop. But sheâs also an avatar for the modern female pop star in a post-Madonna worldâthe liberated woman who kicks open doors without knocking. Under all the sparkle and glitter, you could sense an artist grappling with messy human contradictionsâabout sexuality, about self-love, about asserting femininity in a manâs world. Talking to Apple Music in 2019, Katy Perry said she leads with her gut and lets her mind follow, and doesnât make much sense of any of it until the work is done. âThe themes are joy,â she said. âThey are empowerment. They are trying to expand the boundaries of what I think, and trying to learn from all this opportunity.â She might actually be a superhero. But she also might just be what she is: a girl from Southern California who worked like crazy and didnât flinch. Born in 1984 to Pentecostal pastors in Santa Barbara, Perry (originally Katy Hudson) grew up on gospel music, putting out her first album, 2001âs Katy Hudson, on a Christian label. At some point during adolescence, she discovered Queen, a band whose mix of flamboyance, power, and sexualized wit cracked her creative world open. (Perry named her fragrance Killer Queen, after one of the bandâs signature songs.) Club tracks, ballads, classic pop-rock, and contemporary electronic musicâPerryâs production collaborators are brilliant (Dr. Luke, Max Martin, benny blanco), but it's her songwriting, her image, her balance of playfulness and confidence that pull the package together. And for every âTeenage Dreamâ or âI Kissed a Girl,â there's a âFireworkâ or a âRoar,â music that turns expressions of vulnerability into anthems of inclusion and self-renewalâa dynamic that has made Perry an inspirational figure not only to young women, but for an LGBTQ community she vocally supports. Perry doesnât quite know how she went so platinumâ2010âs Teenage Dream reached commercial heights previously set only by Michael Jacksonâbut while the numbers are nice, the work is what's important. âItâs up to me to make the right choice in my mind to keep putting one foot in front of the other and going forward,â Perry told Apple Music. âNot going backwardsâI could easily go backwards by literally looking at a photo. But I have to go forward, because I know whatâs good for me now.â"
