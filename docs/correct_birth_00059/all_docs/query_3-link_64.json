        "text": "Born: 1984. Living in: United States\n\nKaty Perry was born in California, the middle child of pastor parents. She has an older sister and younger brother. Raised in a deeply religious family, Perry's first experience of performing was singing in church. A passion for music grew and at the age of 15, Perry began visiting Nashville, gaining experience of song writing and recording demos.\n\nShe signed to a Christian record label, Red Hill, and recorded an album, under her birth name of Katy Hudson. The album was not a success. At age 17 she moved to Los Angeles and collaborated with producer Glen Ballard, but was not able to secure a lasting record deal. Perry did sign to Columbia Records in 2004, but again this did not prove a success, and she was dropped.\n\nAn executive at Columbia recommended Perry to the chairman of Virgin Records, Jason Flom, which resulted in her signing for Capitol Music Group. She recorded her second album, \"One of the Boys\" and in the Spring of 2008 released the lead single, the controversial \"I Kissed a Girl\". The song proved a smash, hitting the number one slot in several countries. Other hit singles followed and the album was a commercial success.\n\nPerry was now established as a pop superstar and cemented her position with the release of her next album \"Teenage Dreams\", which spawned more huge hits including \"California Gurls\" and \"Firework\". Many awards and music industry records followed. In 2012 Perry made the move into movies, releasing the documentary feature film Katy Perry: Part of Me (2012)."
