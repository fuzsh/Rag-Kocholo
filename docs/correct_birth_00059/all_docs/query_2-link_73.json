        "text": "At a time of great national discord, it’s rare that we can arrive at a consensus. But in a year of truly excellent entries into the annals of pop history — Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter, Charli XCX’s brat, and more — Katy Perry decided to foist her new single “Woman’s World” from her upcoming album 143 upon us this weekend and, arms linked together, we responded in choral unison, “No.”\n\nPerry had been teasing — or perhaps threatening — the general public with her single for weeks, an overture that included wearing a dress to Paris Fashion Week with the song’s lyrics sewn into a never-ending train. But after all that edging, there was no joyous release, only disgust. The public hate-hate-hated “Woman’s World” and its accompanying glossy video, which features the most basic quasi-feminist iconography diluted by Perry’s corniest instincts.\n\nShe’s Rosie the Riveter getting a half dozen jade rollers to the face! Sure! And, because everything in Perry’s world feels forced, there’s a shot of two guys kissing for no apparent reason. All the bad press for the single didn’t even amount to an ironic streaming victory. Just one day after release, “Woman’s World” disappeared from the Spotify charts after a chilly debut at #110.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nPerry hasn’t enjoyed a mainstream pop hit since “Chained to the Rhythm,” the first single from her June 2017 album Witness. The LP became a punchline; Perry tried her hand at a “purposeful pop” rebrand that ended up resembling your mom’s friend strolling into brunch wearing a pussy hat. That Perry felt the need to shift gears as we changed political administrations makes sense. The greatest pop music is timeless, able to slip into any playlist with relative ease. Perry’s music is not so much timeless as timeful; perhaps no other pop star’s oeuvre is as tied to a single political era as Perry’s is to the Obama administration.\n\nObama formally announced his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in February 2007, just nine months before Perry released her debut single “Ur So Gay,” a melodic, tongue-in-cheek rebuff to an effeminate partner who … wears an H&M scarf. That flirtation with mild homophobia didn’t stop “I Kissed a Girl” from becoming something of a gay club anthem during a summer of primary battles between Obama and Hillary Clinton — and by the time her second single “Hot N Cold” debuted in September, Obama had clinched the Democratic nomination for president at the party’s August convention.\n\nPerry’s subsequent albums became a sort of unofficial soundtrack to Obama’s presidency and the pop culture of the 2010s. With the release of Teenage Dream at the start of the decade, she became the second-ever artist, after only Michael Jackson, to have five songs from the same LP “California Gurls,” “Teenage Dream,” “Firework,” “E.T.” and “Last Friday Night,” — go number 1. Her brand of confection-laden poptimism made sense within the confines of an administration that ascended to the White House on a message of hope and change.\n\nThe Democratic establishment tried to keep the Perry magic going: Her song “Roar” was featured in a 2016 Clinton campaign ad, and she performed the song at that year’s Democratic National Convention. But, as Obama left, so did Perry’s hitmaking skills. Her rebrand didn’t take and the residual love that helped “Chained to the Rhythm” make the top 10 has since faded. (Her closest effort was 2019’s banger “Never Really Over,” a bop that honestly should have been bigger for Perry.)\n\nMany of Perry’s contemporaries have been able to hit the reset button. To stay relevant in music requires some sort of evolution: Kesha dropped the dollar sign and continues to experiment sonically, all the while revealing more about herself in her lyrics. Ten years ago, Charli XCX assisted Iggy Azalea on “Fancy,” the 2014 Song of the Summer, and is now earning more critical acclaim than ever before for her summer-defining album brat. And, of course, many of Perry’s contemporaries seem very comfortable being a part of queer culture, even doing the work of highlighting the LGBTQ+ pioneers who help make their music great, like Beyoncé did on Renaissance. Perry, on the other hand, has made a series of missteps — like thanking Elon Musk for a Cybertruck — that have cost her a lot of queer affection.\n\nBut perhaps no mistake was bigger than her choice of producing partner. Much of the backlash to “Woman’s World” seems rooted in her choice to craft the second-wave feminist anthem with Dr. Luke, whom Kesha accused of drugging and raping her in 2014. (In 2023, the two reached an out-of-court settlement in a defamation lawsuit over the allegations.) By disregarding who she chooses to work with, Perry’s work smacks of a sort of capitalist lean-in feminism that prizes getting the hit over standing in solidarity.\n\nThe reality is that the “Last Friday Night” hitmaker makes little sense outside of the 2010s; we can’t go back to the naïve optimism of songs ready-made to be featured on “Glee.” Since Donald Trump’s ascendance, we have opened Pandora’s Box and seen too many horrors. While we search for the mythical hope at the bottom of the chest, the last thing we want to see is more Katy Perry.\n\nGet the best of what’s queer. Sign up for Them’s weekly newsletter here."
