        "text": "Hi Katherine,\n\nEnjoyed your post about Katy Perry. Having the Perry name in my\n\nancestry I have been very curious about her Portuguese roots and was\n\ntrying to find out more about her Faial ggrandfather's surnames and\n\nfamilies. If anyone has more information please let me know. Thanks....\n\nPat\n\nî—“\n\n>--\n\n>To unsubscribe from this group, send email to\n\n>Azores+un...@googlegroups.com.

At\n\nleast in my grandfather's family, the first son was named for his\n\nfather and given his mother's name as a middle name (in the records\n\nover here). It looks like all my mother's ancestors were originally\n\nfrom Faial, with my maternal grandmother's people from Flamingos. My\n\ngrandfather was Augustus Perry Monteiro--his father was Augustus\n\nGarcia Monteiro and his mother was Olivia Perry.\n\nJoan Mary Jurancich\n\nSacramento, CA\n\nResearching Monteiro, Perry, Fialho, Gonsalves (Goncalves), Garcia,\n\nda Silva, da Rosa on Faial"
