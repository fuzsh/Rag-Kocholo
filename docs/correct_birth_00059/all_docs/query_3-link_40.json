        "text": "Katy Perry is a popular American singer who mostly performs her own compositions. The track I Kissed a Girl is in some way the visiting card of the singer, thanks to which she introduced the whole world to her work.\n\nShe is the author of world-famous hits that were at the peak of popularity in 2000.\n\nChildhood and youth Katy Perry\n\nThe future star was born on October 25, 1984 in a small town near California. Interestingly, the girl's parents were evangelists, from an early age they preached the laws of the Evangelical Church in their family.\n\nThe girl's parents constantly traveled around California, which was related to work. The children were brought up with the utmost rigor. Katie sang in the church choir with her brother. Then she first thought about what she would like to devote herself to music in the future.\n\nIn the Parry family home, contemporary music was not encouraged. However, this did not prevent the girl from studying the compositions of world famous performers. Initially, Katy became a \"fan\" of such legendary bands as Queen and Nirvana.\n\nAs a teenager, Kathy made the decision to leave school and devote herself entirely to music. Parents did not approve of the choice of a young girl, despite this, she entered the Academy of Music, graduated from the Italian opera course.\n\nAlong with the courses, Kathy took singing lessons from country musicians. Even before she became an adult, Katy recorded several of her own songs. True, the quality of the compositions left much to be desired.\n\nThe first steps towards the popularity of Katy Perry\n\nKaty Perry actively wanted to make her way into show business. The first compositions Trust In Me and Search Me did not give a positive result, and they were coldly received by music lovers and music critics. But Perry decided not to stop there, recording her debut album Katy Hudson.\n\nThe singer's first record was recorded in the gospel style. She received positive reviews from music critics, and although the discs were not taken off the shelves at lightning speed, the young singer was still able to \"correctly\" show herself in the right light.\n\nA few years after the release of the first album, the performer recorded the Simple soundtrack for the film \"Jeans-talisman\".\n\nSince that time, the number of \"fans\" has increased significantly. By the way, it was after writing and recording this single that the girl decided to change her creative pseudonym. She has since become Katy Perry.\n\nThe first serious step towards popularity took place in 2008. Thanks to the musical composition I Kissed a Girl, the singer gained hitherto unheard-of popularity.\n\nThe track and video did not want to leave the leading positions of the music charts for a long time. Over time, the track was popular far beyond the United States of America. It began to be played on TV of the CIS countries.\n\nAlbum One of the Boys\n\nThe success was reinforced by the second disc of the performer, which was called One of the Boys. By the way, it soon went platinum. And the top songs of the album deservedly became Hot n Cold and If We Ever Meet Again.\n\nSome time later, the singer introduced the world to the new single California Gurls. The musical composition topped all English-language charts for more than 60 days. The single was followed by the third album Teenage Dream. Four songs from this disc became world hits.\n\nThe popularity of Katy Perry knew no bounds. In the wake of this success, the biopic Katy Perry: Part of Me was released. The film is a vivid story in which the author spoke about the biography of the artist from her earliest childhood to receiving various awards and world fame.\n\nIn 2013, Kathy delighted fans with a new album, Prism. Top compositions Unconditionally and This is How We Do were appreciated not only by fans of the singer's work, but also by \"fans\".\n\nThis is one of the highest paid American performers. The Forbes edition included the singer in the list of \"dear singers\".\n\nHer performance income is over $100. Not so long ago, Perry signed a contract with Moschino, becoming the official face of this brand.\n\nWhat's going on with Katy Perry now?\n\nDespite the very strong competition, Kathy does not get tired of holding the position of the most successful pop singer of our time.\n\nTwo years ago, at the Grammy ceremony, a world-class star showed guests and fans a new single, Chained To The Rhythm, thanks to which the listeners were in a pleasant shock.\n\nKaty Perry organizes solo concerts every year. Her concerts are a real enchanting show that deserves attention and praise.\n\nKathy says that she loses between 5 and 10 kg when preparing for performances and organizing concerts.\n\nInteresting facts about singer Katy Perry:\n\nin addition to a beautiful voice, the girl knows how to play the acoustic and electronic guitar;\n\ncats are the singer's favorite animals. And by the way, she often uses a cat costume as a stage persona;\n\nKaty Perry has a tattoo of Jesus;\n\nthe native hair color of the artist is blond.\n\nThe style of the girl deserves considerable attention. No, in ordinary life, she tries not to stand out, but her stage appearances are always accompanied by bright and original stage costumes. Katie does not forget about the defiant makeup.\n\nShe changes her hair color more often than she experiments with her image. Today she is a brunette, and tomorrow a new video clip is released, in which she appears already with pink hair.\n\nLike many American singers, she maintains her blog on Instagram. It is there that the latest news about personal life, musical career and free time appears.\n\nKaty Perry in 2021\n\nIn 2021, Perry presented a video for the Electric track to fans of her work. In the video, the artist appeared with Pikachu, remembering the wonderful years of her youth."
