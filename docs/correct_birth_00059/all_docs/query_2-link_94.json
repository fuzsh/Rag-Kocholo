Hear Perry play the hits and share her quarantine stories as she takes over Hits 1 (Ch. 2) for the hour.\n\nFans can tune in to catch Perry offering advice on keeping busy during social distancing and sharing what she’s been up to during this time in an effort to connect with Katy Kats across the United States. The four-time Guinness World Record holder and American Idol judge will also be introducing some of the channel’s biggest songs on the heels of her brand new single, “Daisies,” off of her upcoming fifth studio album.\n\nAfter the episode premieres, listeners can hear Perry roar again on Monday at 9pm ET and Tuesday, May 19 at 12am and 3am ET, as well as On Demand. As part of SiriusXM’s continued effort to bring superstars and fans together, Hits 1 n chill specials featuring Demi Lovato, Halsey, and more are also available On Demand below."
