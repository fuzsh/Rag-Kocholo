        "text": "Orlando Bloom and Katy Perry are loving parenthood.\n\nIn August 2020, they welcomed their little girl, Daisy Dove Bloom, into the world.\n\nBloom is also a father to his 13-year-old son, Flynn, whom he shares with his ex-wife, Miranda Kerr.\n\nIn an interview with People, Bloom talked about what it's like to be a dad and he said he enjoys every moment that he gets to spend with his kids. When asked what family time looks like for him, he said, ‚ÄúFamily time is, for me, a meal together. Sitting down at a table. It is going out on a walk or going on an adventure. It‚Äôs games, it‚Äôs play. It‚Äôs connection. It‚Äôs holding hands and hugging. And telling people you love them a lot.\"\n\nAs for Perry, she told ET Canada that motherhood brought more joy into her life.\n\n‚ÄúThe most mundane, beautiful things. You get this surge of joy back and it just makes everything come to life,‚Äù she said.\n\n‚ÄúFor me, I‚Äôve learned a lot about presence and that was something that I really wanted to give as a mother is just, ‚ÄòYeah, there‚Äôs a zillion WhatsApp chats on fire, but I‚Äôm going to put this down and I‚Äôm going to color with you right now for 30 minutes because I love you,‚Äô‚Äù she added.\n\nRead on to learn more about Orlando Bloom and Katy Perry's blended family.\n\nFlynn, 13\n\nBloom became a father for the first time when he welcomed his son, Flynn, with his then-wife, Miranda Kerr, in January 2011.\n\nDuring a 2017 appearance on ITV's \"Good Morning,\" Bloom revealed his son is a big fan of his work and loves to watch the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" movies. In the franchise, Bloom plays the brave Will Turner.\n\n\"My son, bless him. He's 6 and he's seen the first three films at least, and he loved them,\" Bloom shared.\n\nOther than watching movies, Flynn enjoys drawing. On Instagram, Kerr shared a photo of a beautiful horse that her son had drawn.\n\n\"Sunday sketch by my little artist Flynnüßë‚Äçüé®üíñüê¥,\" she captioned the post.\n\nOn Instagram, Bloom has also talked about his kid. In 2017, he shared a photo of him and his little guy together.\n\n\"Mighty monday the morning mash up...these moments at 6am ü§£before the storm of #mondays üëäüèª,\" he penned the caption. \"When I was a boy I dreamed of creating a kingdom to share and balance love with life career and everything in between something I didn‚Äôt fully comprehend till my son opened my heartüôåüèªcould not be more grateful #myboy and that #evolutionüôèüèª.\"\n\nDaisy Dove Bloom, 3\n\nIn August 2020, Perry and Bloom welcomed their daughter, Daisy Dove Bloom, into the world.\n\nWhen she was born, the couple gave the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) the honor of announcing the news.\n\n‚ÄúWelcome to the world Daisy Dove Bloom! We are honoured to introduce Goodwill Ambassadors Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom‚Äôs new bundle of joy,\" the organization said on its website and Instagram account.\n\n‚ÄúWe are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter,‚Äù Perry and Bloom told UNICEF.\n\nOn \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" Perry revealed why she named their daughter Daisy Dove.\n\nShe said, ‚ÄúDaisy, to me, means purity and Dove means peace and Bloom feels like it means joy, so it‚Äôs very pure, peace and joy.\"\n\nAs for Daisy's appearance, Bloom told Ellen DeGeneres that his daughter is the \"perfect\" combination of him and Perry.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny, when she first came out I was like, ‚ÄòOh it‚Äôs me, it‚Äôs mini-me,‚Äô and then fortunately she‚Äôs got those Katy blues, which was perfect. And then she sort of looked like my mom,‚Äù he said."
