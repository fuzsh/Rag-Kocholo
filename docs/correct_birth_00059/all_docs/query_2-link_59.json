She's also pictured horseback riding with friends, and attending a movie on the beach.\n\nOrlando took to his own Instagram account to wish his future wife a happy birthday.\n\nThe image shows Katy getting ready to blow out a birthday candle, while Orlando looks on lovingly.\n\nHe captioned his post: \"We do life we do love and it‚Äôs fun.
