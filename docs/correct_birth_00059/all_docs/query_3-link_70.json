        "text": "Katy Perry (Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and artist. She was born in 1984 in California and grew up in a crowded family of two Christian activists, Keith and Mary Hudson. Kathy has 2 siblings, and her childhood was spent traveling from one place to another in search of a better life. Her stage debut took place at the age of 15 when she recorded her first demo songs with the help of Steve Thomas. In 2001, she recorded her first album, Katy Hudson, with the songs close to gospels and Christian pop. In 2007 she made a contract with Capitol Records to release her second album, but in 2008 a real breakthrough for the young singer took place when she released her first hit \"I Kissed a Girl\", which gained an extreme popularity around the world. In 2012, one more single from Perry, \"Part of Me\" found its place on the top of Billboard Charts. The same year her 4th album Prism was released. Katy Perry was married to Russell Brand, a famous British actor, but the couple split just two years later. Katy dated Orlando Bloom. She took part in various cinema projects, including the Smurfs. She is known as one of the first celebrities who managed to gain over 205 million followers on her Instagram account. She has a few own perfume and clothing lines."
