        "text": "The Art Show, Art Dealers Association of America, The James Cohan Gallery art booth, New York, March 2-6, 2011, no cat.\n\nYinka Shonibare: Magic Ladders, The Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia, PA, January 19-April 21, 2014, no. 63.\n\nYinka Shonibare’s Planets in My Head, Physics celebrates the mystery of the night sky and the thrill of discovery. Here, a curious young girl, wearing high-top button shoes and a Victorian dress cut from Colonialist fabric, steps upon a wooden case to peer through a telescope into the vast beyond. Her head, a black celestial globe, dances with the names of physicists and astronomers. Like us, she is the inheritor of knowledge gleaned through centuries of time by scholars from every part of the world. Archimedes, Galileo, Einstein and Hawking are there, as are Shen Kuo, Ibn Rushd (Averroes), Yoshio Nishina and Brahmagupta. Additional works in Shonibare’s Planets in My Head series include Arts and Literature.\n\nNames of Physicists and Astronomers on Shonibare’s Celestial Globe Head:\n\nNicolaus Copernicus, Democritus Donald, Edwards Marcelo, Danny de Sousa, Samos Al-Hassan ibn al-Haytham, Hippolyte Louis Fizeau, Enrique Lodel Palumbo, Ghulam Murtaza, Leo Esaki, Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, Charles Edouard Guillaume, Archimedes of Syracuse, Brahmagupta, Abdul Hameed Nayyar, Dignaga, Zhang Heng, Hafeez-ur-Rehman Hoorani, Lev Gorkov, Leucippus, Yuval Ne’eman, Richard Gans, Herman Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholz, Hideki Yukawa, Albert Einstein, Thomas Alva Edison, Slu Shen, Claudius Ptolemaeus, Al-Kindi (Abu Yusef Yaqoub ibn Ishaq Al-Kindi), Sir Leonard George Holden Huxley, Pakudha Katyayana, Hugh Le Caine, William Henry Eccles, Su Song, Nikola Tesla, Hans Bethe, Keith Alexander Nugent, John McNeil Hunter, Gan De, Hipparchos, Ashok Das, Rutherford Adkins, Mohammed Masud Ahmad, Sir Marcus ‘Mark’ Laurence Elwin Oliphant, Isaac Newton, Al-Biruni (Abu Rayhan Muhammed ibn Ahmad Biruni), Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius, Stephen William Hawking, G.O.S.
