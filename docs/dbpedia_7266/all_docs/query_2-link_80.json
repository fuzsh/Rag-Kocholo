        "text": "By Nam Sang-so\n\nIt's a country possessing the technology to quickly build nuclear weapons but not actually having done so yet.\n\nAs latent capability is not prescribed by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Japan is a clear case of a country with complete technical prowess to develop a nuclear weapon quickly, being one screwdriver's turn from the bomb.\n\nJapan is considered to have the materials, expertise and technical capacity to make a nuclear bomb at will. Japan now does not try to hide its intent to have the weapon of mass destruction (WMD). A right-wing Japanese politician recently slipped or intentionally his mouth that the country should be able to produce WMD within 90 days.\n\nHe wasn't bluffing as Japan had had reached near success in producing an atomic bomb, only a few steps behind laboratory tests behind the Manhattan Project. The history goes like this. The Japanese programs to develop nuclear weapons were conducted during World War II.\n\nLike the German nuclear weapons program, it suffered from an array of problems, and was ultimately unable to progress beyond the laboratory stage before the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.\n\nOne of the leading figures in the Japanese atomic program was Dr. Yoshio Nishina, a close associate of Niels Henrik, David Bohr and a contemporary of Albert Einstein. Niels Bohr was a Copenhagen born physicist who made foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum mechanics, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922.\n\nIn 1939, Nishina recognized the military potential of nuclear fission, and worried that Americans were working on a nuclear weapon which could be used against Japan.\n\nMeanwhile, the Imperial Japanese Navy's Technology Research Institute had been pursuing its own separate investigations which lead Nishina to chair the Committee on Research in the Application of Nuclear Physics.\n\nWhile the initial experiments were in progress, the Army and Navy carried out searches for uranium ore, in locations ranging from, coincidently Fukushima Prefecture, only 30 km away from now disabled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, to North Korea and China.\n\nJapan also attempted to transport 540 kg of uranium oxide from Germany in April 1945 aboard the German submarine U-234, which however surrendered to U.S. Navy in the Atlantic following Germany's surrender.\n\nIn 1943, a different Japanese Naval command began a nuclear research program under Bunsaku Arakatsu at Kyoto Imperial University. Arakatsu studied at Cavendish Laboratory, Berlin University under Albert Einstein. His team included Hideki Yukawa, who would become in 1949 the first Japanese physicist to receive a Nobel Prize.\n\nThe Tokyo bombing in May 1945 by U.S. Forces destroyed most of Japan's nuclear research facilities practically ending Japan's nuclear weapons research. The nuclear weapons development expertise gained, however, remained alive, which now qualifies Japan as the top nuclear latency power.\n\nThe genesis of Pyongyang's nuclear program is shrouded in secrecy, but accounts suggest that former South Korean scientist named Do Sang-rok was instrumental in its rapid development.\n\nDo, a student of theoretical quantum physics and a graduate of Kyoto Imperial University, the base for Japan's nuclear research, fled to Pyongyang in May 1946. He helped establish Kim Il-sung University, where he built his own particle accelerator and conducted North Korea's first experiments in nuclear physics, so now being called the \"Father of North Korea's nuclear weapons program.\"\n\nMany South Koreans support the obtainment of nuclear weapons to combat the threat of North Korea. South Korea by its own destiny, however, slipped out of the nuclear latency, fortunately or unfortunately.\n\nThe writer is a Japanese-English-Korean translator.
