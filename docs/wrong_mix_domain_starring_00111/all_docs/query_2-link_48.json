        "text": "Playing by Heart Synopsis: Eleven articulate people work through affairs of the heart in Los Angeles.\n\nPlaying by Heart is a 1998 romantic drama film directed by Willard Carroll. The movie weaves together multiple interconnected love stories involving a diverse group of characters in Los Angeles. The ensemble cast includes Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, Angelina Jolie, and others. Each character grapples with the complexities of love, relationships, and the challenges that come with them. The film explores themes of connection, vulnerability, and the various forms that love can take, portraying the intricacies of romantic relationships with humor and depth.\n\nPaul and Hannah are preparing to renew their vows, but long-buried secrets from their 40-year-old marriage surface, threatening their future. Gracie, disillusioned with her marriage, embarks on an affair with Roger, who is also married. Hugh is bored with his life but finds excitement by pretending to be a different person every night.\n\nKeenan and Joan are both young adults amidst the L.A. night scene. They carry their own emotional baggage but find themselves falling in love. The persistent Trent charms Meredith, a rather uptight theater director, but she is reluctant to open her heart after several poor relationships have damaged her trust in men. Mildred and Mark attempt to mend their strained mother/son relationship before time runs out.\n\nAs each story progresses, it becomes evident they are all connected in some shape or form. Love Actually before Love Actually? Perhaps. But where Love Actually has some storylines that feel rather contrived, Playing By Heart is rather earnest in its approach, which may be why I enjoy it so much.\n\nThis is one of the first movies I watched with my husband when we first began dating. He actually owned the movie on DVD and suggested it, so my love of Playing By Heart may come from nostalgia and sentiment more than anything else. But this is a cute movie. It can sometimes be melodramatic, but there is enough fluff and humor to balance some of the heavier moments.\n\nWith an overall fantastic cast, it’s challenging to narrow down the best performances, but I loved the scenes between Paul (Sean Connery) and Hannah (Gena Rowlands) as they came to terms with their past and their future. Both are acting powerhouses, and while they’re not known for their comedic talent, it’s certainly on display here.\n\nI also adored Angelina Jolie’s Joan, who is boisterous and quirky without crossing the line into obnoxious territory. I think in terms of romance, Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart have the best “love story” because it felt natural and relatable, especially to those who may have had a string of bad relationships before finding The One.\n\nDirector Willard Carroll examines various types of love with Playing by Heart. Romantic, platonic, familial. Every character strives to find that connection with another or to reforge the connections they once had. Some storylines aren’t as strong as others, but Carroll makes them all compelling in their own way.\n\nPlaying by Heart is extremely earnest, almost to a fault, but strong performances from the cast keep it from becoming cloying. If you like some drama in your rom-com, or… you know, just like romance in general, I definitely recommend watching this one."
