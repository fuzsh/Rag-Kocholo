        "text": "A trailer has been released for the presidential biopic Reagan, about the life and career of the 40th President of the United States, Ronald Reagan. Emmy and Golden Globe nominated actor Dennis Quaid is playing the lead role, after having been nominated for his portrayal of the 42nd POTUS, Bill Clinton in the 2010 TV movie, The Special Relationship. He is joined by cast members Mena Suvari, Jon Voight, Penelope Ann Miller, Xander Berkeley, Amanda Righetti, C. Thomas Howell, Justin Chatwin, and Robert Davi.\n\nThe film’s synopsis reads: “From dusty small-town roots, to the glitter of Hollywood, and then on to commanding the world stage, Reagan is a cinematic journey about overcoming the odds.\n\n“Told through the voice of Viktor Petrovich, a former KGB agent whose life becomes inextricably linked with Ronald Reagan's when Reagan first catches the Soviets’ attention as an actor in Hollywood, this film offers a perspective as unique as it is captivating.\n\n“Quaid brings to life a story that transcends the boundaries of a traditional biopic, offering a profound exploration of the enduring impact of the power of one man who overcame the odds, sustained by the love of a woman who supported him in his journey, Nancy Reagan played by Penelope Ann Miller.\n\nReagan is directed by Sean McNamara (P.U.N.K.S., Soul Surfer, The King's Daughter), who most recently directed On a Wing and a Prayer also starring Dennis Quaid. The screenplay is written by Howard Klausner and Jonas McCord.\n\nCheck out the trailer below, and watch Reagan in theaters nationwide on August 30th."
