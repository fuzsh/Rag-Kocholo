        "text": "Had a movie fest the last couple of days...\n\nPride & Prejudice (2005) - IMDb - I liked it, Keira Knightley gives a fine performance and Matthew Macfadyen makes for a fine Mr. Darcy. The BBC mini-series still tops as the best version, but this makes for a good time at the movies with nothing really lacking.\n\nKing Arthur (2004) - IMDb - An entirely different take on King Arthur & The Knights of the Round Table, here they are shown as Roman soldiers who are fighting their own countrymen the British. However, when the Romans lose the war and leave the country its up to Arthur and his friends to save the day for a new England. Performances were ok, Clive Owen makes for a good Arthur/friend who cares for people but makes for a very unconvincing action hero. Ioan Gruffudd does his job well and so does Stellan Skarsgrd along with Keira Knightley. Recommended for a different take on Arthur's story especially if the Sean Connery and Richard Gere version disappointed you.\n\nLove Actually (2003) - IMDb - A mix of multiple love stories and filled with many stars. In the end everybody turns out to be either related or friends with each other. Entertaining fare and filled with pretty faces. However, because there are so many stars you might be left desiring more of your favorite star or love story. For me the pick was Colin Firth in terms of performance and Liam Neeson in an understated role of a recent widower. Either way a good movie that should entertain everyone.\n\nLondon Boulevard (2010) - IMDb - I did not like this one actually. Too much British stuff in there and the pretty Keira Knightley has limited screen time not to mention the story tended to drag and meander. However, its a good outing for fans of Colin Farrell who puts in a good performance.\n\nThe Man in the Iron Mask (1998) - IMDb - The story of the Three Musketeers and D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne). Good performances by everyone including Leonardo DiCaprio as the bad King Louis and Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, and Grard Depardieu as the Three Musketeers. The story is a departure from the usual Three Musketeers where its all about saving the King. Here they have to change the bad king by replacing him with his good twin.\n\nThe Three Musketeers (1993) - IMDb - This one is more in line with Hollywood's big budget summer action fare. The Three Musketeers are played by Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, and Oliver Platt and Chris O'Donnell is a very young D'Artagnan along with Rebecca De Mornay, Gabrielle Anwar and Julie Delpy. Ok performances. the sword play tends to drag especially towards the ending but its high on the entertainment factor with lots of superstars and good humor.\n\nThis Means War (2012) - IMDb - Its a laugh riot about two guys competing with each other to date the same woman and the woman dating two guys at the same time. Lots of laughs and gags but may offend the sensibilities of those who are offended by the very notion of two timing. The guys (Chris Pine and Tom Hardy) do a better job here, however, Reese Witherspoon falls flat as a hottie the guys are fighting over. She does well in terms of performance, but does not really pass for a blonde bombshell which is central to the story. However, the gags more than make up for it and its worth for a few good laughs.\n\nLast Night (2010) - IMDb - An okay movie, you will probably dig into it if you are really into either Keira Knightley or Sam Worthington. It is about a married couple who are struggling to stay faithful to each other, both emotionally and physically. Performances are okay to good, the pretty Keira Knightley delivers as always, and Sam Worthington is decent, but Eva Mendes is definitely wasted. Newcomer Guillaume Canet does impress very much. Not a romance movie, and not a happy love story either, but it's a narration on modern-day marriages. Recommended only if you're into Keira Knightley or Sam Worthington.\n\nAt Any Price (2012) - IMDb - Disappointing fare really, though Dennis Quaid has come up with a really fine performance as a father struggling to keep his family and his business together. Dennis Quaid is a farmer struggling against big corporations and rich millionaire farmers and has already lost his elder son who has left the family business of farming and is content climbing mountains in Argentina. Zac Efron plays the younger son who is not interested in taking up the family business either and instead wants to take up professional racing. Zac Efron ends up with an accident the same time Dennis Quaid ends up in trouble professionally and this acts as a catalyst to bring both the father and son together and the rest of the story is about how they end up saving the family business. Both Dennis Quaid and Zac Efron have come up with fine performances as well as the rest of the cast. Unfortunately though the movie is too slow in terms of pace and offers very little in the action/romance departments.\n\nCaught up on a few Nicholas Sparks movies\n\nThe Lucky One (2012) - IMDb - Another Zac Efron movie along with the beautiful Taylor Schilling (from Orange Is the New Black). Zac Efron is a marine in Afghanistan who comes across a photograph of Taylor Schilling and begins to believe she is his guardian angel because he begins to escape death from the time he begins to carry the photograph. Naturally he promises himself that once he returns home safely he will find and thank his guardian angel. However, when he does come across Taylor Schilling he is not able to share his history with her photograph and instead ends up working in her dog kennel. Romance follows and all ends well for the lovers as expected, barring a couple of incidents with Taylor's ex. Fine performances by everyone, I'll probably be biased about Taylor Schilling because I'm a fan of Orange Is the New Black, but Zac Efron does come up with a fine performance.\n\nDear John (2010) - IMDb - Another romance featuring Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried. Channing is a marine on a two-week holiday who runs into college (or high school) student Amanda and both fall in love. They promise to stay in touch and in love and write to each other regularly despite Channing returning to the Army. 911 happens and Channing extends his army tenure to fight for the country and this drives the couple apart with Amanda falling for another guy and getting married. The movie has a different ending compared with the novel and did not do much for me, but do check out the alternate ending on YouTube which remains faithful to the novel. Performances are uniformly good though the ending kind of messes things up.\n\nA Walk to Remember (2002) - IMDb - Probably the best adaptation of any of Nicholas Sparks' novels. A very simple story of a rich brat in high school falling for a Reverend's daughter. Poles apart, but as they say opposites attract. Shane West plays the spoilt brat and Mandy Moore the church going/choir singing Reverend's daughter. The story is typical, but the treatment and the performances elevate it to one of the best teenage romances ever. I'll not go much into the story, but do recommend checking this one out.\n\nMessage in a Bottle (1999) - IMDb - I was a kid when this came out and remember watching it in the theatres. Okay performances from Kevin Costner and Robin Wright as well as especially by Paul Newman elevate this ordinary cheesy romance. Robin Wright comes across a bottle with a message and it and tracks down the owner Kevin Costner and ends up falling in love with him. Costner is a widower with his own past love story and the rest of the story deals with how he makes peace with himself thanks to Robin Wright. An okay movie, though definitely the womenfolk will appreciate it more. A walk down the path of nostalgia for me, especially to see Kevin Costner who was one of my favorite heroes back in the day.\n\nKeith (2008) - IMDb - Not just another teenage love story, Keith elevates the genre to something special. The premise is the usual, 2 teenagers from opposite backgrounds fall in love, but cannot be together because one of them is terminally ill. However, performances and the treatment elevate Keith to something special, something wonderful. Jesse McCartney is spot-on in the character of Keith, and Elisabeth Harnois more than holds her own as the love interest who has everything in life figured out until she meets a boy who has no plans whatsoever. Keith is definitely recommended for being more than your average teenage love story.\n\nHere on Earth (2000) - IMDb - Another teenage love story along the same lines and with the same plot, someone has to die from a terminal illness. Nothing special about this one, the story, the characterization, the performances, etc. are okay but nothing extraordinary. Leelee Sobieski is beautiful, Chris Klein is okay and Josh Hartnett is definitely wasted. An okay movie, with pretty leads that should help pass the time.\n\nSweet November (2001) - IMDb - An adult love story with the same theme again. However, Charlize Theron elevates it to something special with her performance as a terminally ill patient. Keanu Reeves is okay as an executive who has little time for life or anything else other than to make money. The story is limited, but if you're into Charlize Theron then this movie is a must, if only to watch her performance as well as the chemistry between Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves which elevates an otherwise ordinary movie.\n\nThe First Time (2012) - IMDb - I walked into this one without any major expectations, but was very pleasantly surprised. Not your average teenage love story, it's more about relationships, even human interaction, but from a teenage perspective. Excellent performances all around, both Dylan O'Brien and Britt Robertson are spot-on in their performances and the on-screen chemistry between the leads makes this an outright winner. Definitely recommended.\n\nJohn Tucker Must Die (2006) - IMDb - You get what you expect, as long as you don't expect too much. The premise is interesting, 3 girls who are cheated by the same guy plan to take revenge on the guy along with a 4th girl. Performances are okay, as is the entire movie. Nothing really special, but an average entertainer.\n\nThe Lake House (2006) - IMDb - Two lonely people begin to correspond with each other via snail mail, but from different years. Keanu Reeves lives in 2004 and writes to Sandra Bullock who lives in 2006 (don't ask how that works). The rest of the story is how they fall in love and have to bend and overcome time to be together. Despite the plot, the movie works mainly because of the performances from both Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. As in the movie Speed, their chemistry works and elevates The Lake House to a good, solid love story. It's not sappy like teenage love stories or overtly melodramatic, and it works very well as an adult love story because of the treatment and the lead performances. Definitely one of Keanu Reeves better movies.\n\nJoy Ride (2001) - IMDb - This one is a really good thriller, very nicely done, without too much blood or gore and thrills simply based on performances, and the very basic premise. Two brothers are driving home across states and pull a prank on CB radio on unsuspecting motorists they meet along the way. Unfortunately for them one of them, a truck driver, does not take the prank lightly and starts a game of cat and mouse where he begins to terrorize them, by stalking them, threatening them and even kidnapping their co-passenger Leelee Sobieski. Steve Zahn and Paul Walker are good performance wise, but it's the truck driver who is never shown, and who only communicates via CB radio, who steals the show here simply by his voice. Highly recommended thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seats, and without any spilling of blood either. Reminds me of the excellent Duel directed by Steven Spielberg.\n\nBring It On (2000) - IMDb - An okay teenage drama about cheerleaders and a cheerleading competition that every school/everyone wants to win. Okay performances by everybody like Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Jesse Bradford and Gabrielle Union. Nothing special, an okay movie.\n\nTwo Weeks Notice (2002) - IMDb - Romantic comedy from Sandra Bullock that works mainly because of the performances of the main leads Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant. Nothing much in terms of the story, a millionaire boss and his legal secretary work together for 2 years, and then fall in love when she gives her 2 weeks notice to quit. Decent comedy that works for the most part thanks to the leads. Only recommended if you are into Sandra Bullock or Hugh Grant.\n\nA Walk in the Clouds (1995) - IMDb - Remember watching this as a kid. A good romance from Keanu Reeves who returns home from the war and wants to settle down with his wife. Unfortunately things don't go as planned and he has to find work as a chocolate sales man and comes across a young pregnant woman who is afraid to go home without a husband. Keanu Reeves offers to step in and smooth things over with the family before leaving and you can guess how it ends. If the movie had been shortened by 10 to 15 minutes, it would have worked much better. Definitely recommended if you're into Keanu Reeves. Aitana Snchez-Gijn, the female lead is pretty and Anthony Quinn more than makes up with his fine performance. Think of it as good wine, it needs to be savored and enjoyed slowly, not something most of us in this modern age can appreciate. That might be one reason this movie would be lost on most folks today. However, the movie works if you are into passion and romance and enjoy a slow cooked meal as opposed to quick sex and a hot shower. I liked it though it has its flaws, but I will definitely take it any day over The Dependables and its ilk."
