I am an immensely privileged person, was able to get representation pretty early on, and that's more than half the battle.\n\n\"I knew the door was open for me in a lot of ways that it's just not for a lot of actors.\n\n\"And I've just tried to work as hard as I possibly can to prove that I deserve to walk through that door. So if that's in the rom-com space, it's got to be different enough, and I need to work my a** off.\"\n\nMeg previously defended her son over being branded a nepo baby, but while Jack can understand why she spoke out, he doesn't shar eher concern that it undermines his talent.\n\nHe said: \"My first thought was like, she's being a mom. She's being a loving mom.\n\n\"But I don't think she's trying to say that I'm not a nepo baby. I think she's just trying to say that, in her opinion, it undermines my talent. I don't think it undermines my talent.\n\n\"I know that I work hard, and I know I've heard 'no' way more than I've heard 'yes.'\n\n\"But I also know that this industry is insanely hard to break into, and I had an easier time doing that than most. Both things can be true.\n\n\"So no, I don't think she was trying to say that I'm not a privileged person. She knows. She must know. I think she was being a mom.\"\n\nThe 'When Harry Met Sally' star had previously insisted calling her son was \"dismissive\".\n\nShe told Glamour magazine: \"That nepo stuff is so dismissive of his work ethic, his gifts, and how sensitive he is to the idea of his privilege.\""
