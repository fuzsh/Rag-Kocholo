        "text": "One day after a bullet grazed Donald Trump’s ear during an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania, the former President got on his plane and flew to the Republican National Convention, in Milwaukee, to accept the Party’s formal nomination for President, again. Before taking off for Wisconsin, he posted, “UNITE AMERICA!” on Truth Social. Several hours later, on Sunday night, delegates in Milwaukee began to assemble for a “Red, White, and Brew” opening party. Outside the venue, a group of anti-abortion protesters chanted, “Blood, blood, blood on your hands.” The city was all roadblocks and shuttle buses; fireworks went off in the rain. Some delegates wore black hats that said “REAGAN”—a new bio-pic, starring Dennis Quaid, was being screened at the convention.\n\n“I’m interested to figure out what the vibe is,” a man named Ryan, who works on digital advertising for Trump’s campaign, told me on his way into the party. “Anybody who was thinking of going really hard, that angry tone—‘Grab your pitchfork’—they’re probably going to tone it down. Trump’s whole thing is success is going to be his retribution. I would not be surprised if they now went in a positive direction—not an ‘Our country’s falling apart’ direction.” Trump had, in fact, reportedly revised his convention speech with de-escalation in mind. “I want to try to unite our country, but I don’t know if that’s possible,” he said on Sunday. “It is a chance to bring the country together. I was given that chance.”\n\nBy Monday morning, the convention’s official theme of the day, Make America Wealthy Once Again, was recast under the motif of unity. Many attendees insisted that actually this was nothing new; a senior Trump campaign adviser told me, “This convention was always about unity. The underlying reality of the campaign remains the same.” He went on, “President Trump is not only looking to unify the Party but the nation.” Charles Hart, a Florida delegate in a seersucker suit and a boater hat, agreed. “They want us to be one country, one great American people, one great American family,” he said, as we waited for the nominating proceedings to begin. When I mentioned that Trump, on the campaign trail, often talks about retribution and revenge, he accused me of twisting Trump’s words to suggest that he had brought on the assassination attempt, and started recording our conversation. “I’ll be bluntly honest with you. I don’t know if the media has been trying to lower the political temperature or change the narrative of pitting Americans against Americans. It’s pretty sad. We live in a country where if, God forbid, something happened to Joe Biden, I guarantee the news stories about how evil the Republican Party is alleged to be would black out the skies.”\n\nA sign outside the convention center read “Together, we will write America’s next chapter.” Around 1 P.M., delegates from each state took their seats on the floor for roll call. Alvin Porter, Jr., an alternate delegate from South Carolina, wore a top hat bearing an image of Abraham Lincoln on the cover of Life magazine. “Lincoln is my first favorite President, and after that Donald Trump,” he said. “We have to quit this fighting. After this is over, we are still Americans, and we need to learn to love each other. Otherwise, we’ll be conquered from the outside and wonder what happened to our democracy.” Porter handed me a printed photo of himself at the 2004 convention, wearing the same Lincoln hat.\n\nMichael Whatley, the chairperson of the Republican National Committee, opened the nominating session with a gavel sound effect; the crowd chanted “U.S.A.!” and “Fight, fight, fight.” (On Saturday, seconds after he’d been shot, Trump had pumped his fist and mouthed, “Fight,” before he was taken offstage by the Secret Service.) A Texas delegate in a cowboy hat was buying a gold R.N.C. belt buckle from another delegate. “In light of what happened, you can’t have a choice,” she said, counting out cash. “Trump almost took a bullet for us.” Her husband interjected: “He did take a bullet for us!”\n\nAt the 2016 convention, a shouting match broke out between Trump’s supporters and a group of delegates who opposed him. No such fracture took place this year. At the Iowa caucuses, Trump got more of the Republican vote than any candidate in history. On Super Tuesday, he won every state; at Mar-a-Lago, where I was watching the results come in, a donor suggested to me that Trump is now the “big-tent party.” On the convention floor on Monday, states stood up, one by one, to give all their delegates to Trump. When Mitch McConnell came up to a microphone to pledge Kentucky’s delegates, he was loudly booed. The message was clear. “This is the Trump era of history,” Henry McMaster, South Carolina’s governor, said. Trump had just announced that his running mate would be J. D. Vance, the junior senator from Ohio and a former Never Trumper who had, in 2016, wondered whether Trump might be “America’s Hitler.” But all of that was in the past. Nikki Haley, the last anti-Trumper standing, had released her delegates to the former President, and had accepted a last-minute invitation to speak. Kevin McCarthy, whose ouster from the House Speakership Trump had declined to block, hung around, posing for photos and glad-handing, looking tan and wearing Allbirds.\n\nAt an Italian restaurant just outside the convention’s security perimeter, the National Italian American Foundation hosted a reception. Ric Grenell, Trump’s former director of National Intelligence, mingled; Kash Patel, a former Trump official who has promised the media that, in a second Trump term, “we’re going to come after you, whether it’s criminally or civilly, we’ll figure that out,” stood in the corner by platters of bruschetta. At the bar, the chef wore a MAGA hat with an Italian flag on the side.\n\nBack at the convention, Whatley convened the evening’s session, which would include a lineup of speeches. “Only Trump can unite us,” he said. Marjorie Taylor Greene told the crowd that the establishment “promised unity but they gave us division.” Mark Robinson, the lieutenant governor of North Carolina, called Trump “the Braveheart of our time.” (Recently, Robinson had given an address to a church in which he said, “Some folks need killing! It’s time for somebody to say it. It’s not a matter of vengeance. It’s not a matter of being mean or spiteful. It’s a matter of necessity!”) Videos were played of Trump dancing to “Y.M.C.A.,” and of President Biden falling on stairs.\n\nDuring the past few months of the campaign, I’d seen Trump call himself “a shepherd to mankind” in a video titled “God Made Trump,” and compare himself to Jesus on the cross, gesturing under his suit to the proverbial wounds on his body. His campaign has always been inflected with a bit of martyrdom; the mug shot taken during his arraignment in Georgia showed him defiant—never surrender—and he would often tell crowds, “I’m being indicted for you.” When Trump walked onto the convention floor late on Monday night, his right ear bandaged, it was the most profound and unexpected culmination of all the messianic talk—God Saved Trump. (“I’m supposed to be dead,” he had said on Sunday.) Lee Greenwood played “God Bless the U.S.A.” as Trump waved and made his way to a box seat. People had been speculating about whether Trump would speak to the crowd; at rallies, he often talks for three hours, but on Monday night he didn’t need to say anything. The sea of people turned toward him and raised their fists, as he had after he was shot, chanting “Fight.” Amber Rose, a model and former Trump critic, took the stage. “Élites have no party, élites have no nation,” she said. “Whether we’re Republicans, Democrats, or liberals, no matter your politics, the best chance we have is to elect Donald Trump.” To close the program, Harmeet Dhillon, an R.N.C. member from California, delivered a Sikh blessing, praising Trump’s absence of hate when faced with vitriol. Trump smiled and laughed and closed his eyes in prayer. Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’ ” played as he descended a staircase to the convention floor.\n\nOutside, a summer rainstorm had begun, and Carla Sands, a Pennsylvania delegate who was Trump’s Ambassador to Denmark, was waiting for it to stop. “It’s heroic that he’s here,” she told me. “It’s a miracle that we aren’t a nation in mourning.” (She made sure to add that the campaign’s platform was about unity, and always had been.) A line was forming in front of a studio that Fox had built inside the convention center, where Vance was doing his first post-nomination TV hit. When he emerged, flanked by his new Secret Service detail, a crowd chased after him. I talked to Edward, a delegate from New Jersey, who wore a green Trump hat that said “MOGUL” on the back; a group next to us was dressed in Revolutionary War garb. “What happened Saturday changed everything,” Edward said. “I’ve been to seventy-nine Trump rallies. These rallies are fun. I’ve developed a friendship with ex-Deadheads—Jerry died and now they follow Trump. I brought a lot of goofy hats with me to Milwaukee, but I can’t in good faith wear them now, because it’s all changed. Our party has always been about unity. There’s unity, but now it’s serious.” The insistence on unity revealed how much discord remains. Edward went on, “The Democrats are responsible. The blood is on Joe Biden’s hands. They relentlessly attack Trump supporters saying we’re Nazis, we’re Hitler, we’re Dracula, the living dead. They’ve called us a threat to democracy, they think we’re the threat in the world they have to destroy.” ♦"
