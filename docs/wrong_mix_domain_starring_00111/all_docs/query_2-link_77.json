        "text": "The world lost one of its brightest stars last month when Debbie Reynolds passed away, following the tragic death of daughter Carrie Fisher. Although best known for Singin’ in the Rain, I’ll always have a fondness for her 1950’s rom-coms. One of my favorites is this week’s film Tammy and the Bachelor (DVD), a film equally famous for Reynolds’ rendition of the theme song. Sweet, dreamy, Tammy’s in love. And so am I.\n\nWhen country cutie Tammy rescues wealthy farmer Peter Brent from the wreckage of a plane crash, I couldn’t help but be shocked when the lifeless face pulled out of the swamp is that of ’80s comedy star Leslie Nielsen. I’m of the generation who only knew him as the deadpan comedy star from Airplane! and the Naked Gun film series. Seeing him as a sexy leading man with brown (not stark white!) hair is certainly a trip. Add to that an aged Fay Wray as the matriarch of his Antebellum mansion, and you’ve got a cast that has to be seen to be believed.\n\nTammy’s journey is set in motion when her grandfather gets arrested for making moonshine, forcing her to turn to Peter and his family for sanctuary. This makes me appreciate what a wonderful time we live in, where homebrew is as easy and legal as ordering the kit from a catalog. Back on a bayou river in the 1950’s, things were tougher. If you’re watching Tammy and the Bachelor and you care to wet your whistle, I recommend drinking Riverwater*.\n\nRiverwater\n\n1.5 oz white moonshine\n\n4 oz sweet tea\n\n1 oz lemon juice\n\nMix all ingredients together in a mason jar, and stir until combined. Fill jar with crushed ice, and garnish with a lemon twist.\n\n(*Good for your constitution!)\n\nReynolds’ star was formed in the golden age of the Hollywood studio system, and lucky for us it resulted in so many endearing performances. It’s hard to watch her and not smile. Her sweetness and joy were infectious, and Tammy was no exception. As she sings her signature song in the moonlight, we realize that nothing in that sky outside her window could ever shine as brightly as her. Cheers!\n\nInternational intrigue! Fighting gypsy women! Venomous shoe daggers! Only in a Bond film, folks. While I appreciate the more recent James Bond films for their sincerity, I can’t help but love the original 60’s variety. The cheese-factor is just unparalleled. This week, I’ll be watching an absolute classic in the Bond oeuvre, From Russia With Love (DVD/Download).\n\nAdmittedly, I get a little lost with any Bond film. There are just too many sinister villains, subplots and gorgeous women to keep track of. I mainly watch for the charisma of Sean Connery, the Bond girl clothes, and the clever spy gadgets. And Miss Moneypenny, who is really the Girl Friday of these films, oozing smarts and unconventional sex appeal. As the opening titles appear, and we get to watch the producer’s names projected on the gyrating skin of a belly dancer, you pretty much know what you’re in for with this one. Sure there’s some Cold War-era intrigue that takes us from Istanbul to Venice on the Orient Express, but who are we kidding- we’re all here for the double entendres in James Bond’s bedroom.\n\nAlthough the film is called From Russia With Love, we never really see Russia. We do however see Russian-accented Bond Girl Daniela Bianchi, who plays double agent Tatiana Romanova. She falls head over heels in love with Bond, because well, he’s Bond. While watching From Russia with Love, I recommend drinking a Moscow Mule.\n\nMoscow Mule\n\n1 ½ oz Russian Vodka\n\n4 oz Ginger Beer\n\n½ oz Lime Juice\n\nCombine ingredients in a copper mug over ice and stir gently to combine. Garnish with a lime slice.\n\nEveryone has their favorite Bond, but for me it will always be Sean Connery. That furry chest, that light Scottish brogue, and the twinkle in his eye gets me every time. Even in a jaunty sailor cap, he still looks stylish, cool, and definitely a man of mystery. Cheers!\n\n(*For anybody curious, I will absolutely be watching this movie and drinking this cocktail on January 20th, 2017).\n\nI love a good disaster flick. The bad acting, women in impractical footwear, explosions, campy special effects- this is the stuff of some great cinematic cheese-fests. One of the best films in the disaster genre is this week’s The Poseidon Adventure (DVD/Download). Although it was remade about ten years ago, I’ll always have a fondness for the 1972 version. Shelley Winters and all those unfortunate 70’s hairstyles make this a classic of epic size.\n\nAboard the S.S. Poseidon, revelers are toasting the New Year in the ship’s ballroom. Suddenly the captain (Leslie Nielsen- who else?) hears of an underground earthquake that has created a giant wave heading straight for the luxury liner. Soon, the ship flips over, the tables are on the ceiling, bodies are crashing into the chandeliers, and a ragtag group of survivors begins hatching an escape plan through the ship’s hull. As the hip Reverend, Gene Hackman leads them through corridors full of twisted metal, rapidly flooding rooms, and way more fire than one would think possible with so much water around. Ernest Borgnine guides his saucy former prostitute/now wife Linda through the wreckage in her silver lame platform heels and men’s dress shirt, while Shelley Winters and Jack Albertson are the cute old couple you want to be someday. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the hit song “Theme from Poseidon Adventure (The Morning After)” as sung by a band that’s quite a relic from the 70’s. All those sideburns and grooves- yikes.\n\nMy cruising experience is limited to one ill-fated trip to Bermuda during hurricane season, but from what I recall the drinks were sugary and bright-hued. In homage to the 70’s vibe and underwater footage in murky green water, while watching The Poseidon Adventure I recommend drinking a Rogue Wave.\n\nRogue Wave\n\n1 oz Midori\n\n2 oz Vodka\n\n5 oz Fresca\n\nMaraschino Cherry\n\nBuild drink in a glass over crushed ice, stirring gently to combine. Drop Maraschino cherry in and let it sink to the bottom.\n\nDespite the over-the-top acting and questionable costuming, this movie still pulls me in with its never-ending suspense and peril around every corner. Plus it provides some valuable lessons. Such as, no matter how much weight you gain at the buffet, you’re still light in water. Also, never leave your stateroom without a bra. Cheers!\n\nAfter living it up in New Orleans last week it was tough to come back to work. My office just doesn’t have that same excitement of the French Quarter, and there’s no hurricane mix in the breakroom (I think). To ease myself back into office life, this week I’ll be watching the Mike Judge comedy Office Space (DVD/Download).\n\nThis cult classic was the film that inspired all the work-place comedies we’ve become so familiar with. Before Lumbergh and his TPS reports came along, there really wasn’t another movie that so effectively mocked the daily drudgery of white-collar worker bees. The fictional Initech could be any number of companies in bland office parks around the country, buttressed by crappy chain restaurants with names like Flinger’s and Chotchkie’s. We’ve all driven past them (hell, perhaps you might work in one) and this movie gets so much right about the culture. The annoying receptionist, the sad birthday cake celebrations in the breakroom, the disappearing staplers- I could go on and on. So when lead character Peter Gibbons takes a symbolic (and literal) hammer to all that is wrong with this world, we can’t help but cheer him on.\n\nAs I’m sure anybody who’s ever worked in an office can tell you, most of the day is spent dreaming of tropical vacations you may or may not ever take. If it’s been a rough eight hours, and you just need a tasty escape, while watching Office Space I recommend drinking a T.P.S (Tequila Pineapple Sunrise).\n\nT.P.S.\n\n1.5 oz tequila\n\n.5 oz Cointreau\n\n2 oz Orange Juice\n\n2 oz Pineapple Juice\n\n.5 oz Grenadine\n\nPour the tequila, Cointreau, orange and pineapple juices into a glass over ice. Add the grenadine, which will sink to the bottom, creating a sunrise effect (and NO salt on the rim).\n\nIn Office Space, the question is asked, “what would you do if you had a million dollars?” Sadly, a million dollars doesn’t get you that far these days, but it could at least buy you some freedom. For me, the answer to that question is write, read, and watch movies. For now I have to settle for doing these things after 5:00pm and on weekends, but maybe someday I’ll be able to enjoy them whenever I want. Perhaps on a tropical island, with a cocktail in my hand. And I’m keeping my stapler. Cheers!\n\nAs 2016 comes to a close it’s time for my annual Top Five list. Full disclosure, I didn’t get a chance to see everything (sorry Moonlight), but I saw a lot, even some I wished I hadn’t (lookin’ at you The Lobster). This is always a tough list to make, but these five films were the ones that entertained me the most in 2016. Yes Manchester By the Sea is great, but it sort of made me want to sit in a dark closet and never come out. Thank heavens La La Land was around to pick up the pieces. In ranking order, my Top Five Film picks for 2016:\n\n1. La La Land\n\nTrue story- I left the theater and my cheeks ached from smiling so much. This musical about struggling entertainers feels both timeless and fresh, and reminds me of why I love movies. Simply stunning!\n\n2. Arrival\n\nThis intelligent sci-fi film isn’t about aliens, but rather about communication. I’ll never look at language the same way.\n\n3. Hell or High Water\n\nChris Pine, where have you been?? Nobody else could make a dusty bank robber in West Texas look quite so appealing. Quit hiding behind Star Trek and be the actor I know you can be!\n\n4. The Edge of Seventeen\n\nHailee Steinfeld makes my Molly Ringwald-forged heart beat once more in this homage to classic (read- good) teen films.\n\n5. The Nice Guys\n\nWas I the only one who saw this? If so, that’s a shame because this Ryan Gosling/Russell Crowe LA noir comedy was witty, sharp, and energetic. I’ll watch these two together any time, any place.\n\nGreetings from New Orleans! I’m off on a little sojourn in the Big Easy, taking in the sights and doing some much-needed cocktail research (very important business). To prepare for my trip I’ve been watching some New Orleans-set films, including this week’s The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (DVD/Download). Some star-crossed romance and beautiful Garden District scenes are just what I need to kick off this week of bon temps.\n\nBased on the story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button stars Brad Pitt as a man who ages in reverse. Fate intervenes and brings him together periodically with his true love Daisy, played by Cate Blanchett. We know going in that this can’t be a story with a happy ending, though there are some beautiful scenes of the two lovers “meeting in the middle” of their lives. What Benjamin’s tale teaches us is that backwards or forwards, life is a long journey that we’ve just got to make the best of. Also, we learn that Brad Pitt will one day be a very adorable old man.\n\nPart of my excitement over a trip to New Orleans is that this was the city that launched SO MANY cocktails. The Hurricane, the Ramos Gin Fizz, the Vieux Carré- I could go on and on. But for this film, I’ll be drinking perhaps the most iconic NOLA cocktail- the Sazerac.\n\nSazerac\n\nAbsinthe\n\n1 sugar cube\n\n2 ½ oz Cognac or rye whiskey\n\n3 dashes of Peychaud’s bitters\n\nLemon twist\n\nRinse an old-fashioned glass with absinthe, discard, then fill the glass with crushed ice. Muddle the sugar cube with a few drops of water in another old-fashioned glass, and add a few large ice cubes. Add in the cognac or rye, and bitters, and stir gently to combine. Discard the ice in the first glass, then strain the cocktail into this prepared glass. Add a twist of lemon.\n\nAlthough the concept of reverse aging is something the beauty industry has been chasing for decades, Benjamin Button shows us how futile it all is. Eventually we all end up in diapers. Until then, I plan on making the most of every day that I find myself in the middle, and appreciating this random collision course that we call life. Cheers!\n\n(Dear Friend,)\n\nAlthough I adore a black & white Jimmy Stewart film at Christmas time, I’ve already covered the classic It’s a Wonderful Life on Cinema Sips. So instead this week I’ll be featuring another holiday favorite, The Shop Around the Corner (DVD/Download). While not as overtly sentimental as the Capra film he’d later become known for, it still features a good dose of Stewart charm and some delightful send-ups of the holiday shopping season.\n\nI first came across this wonderful picture after watching the remake, You’ve Got Mail. Nora Ephron did a fabulous job of updating this classic for modern audiences, and it’s truly one of my favorites. But the original is no slouch either. Directed by Ernst Lubitsch, the story of boy-meets-girl anonymously through mail is timeless. Think of it as Catfish pre-sexual predators and con artists. Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan trade barbs as they work side-by-side in a Budapest gift shop, never realizing that they’ve fallen in love with each other through their letters. Special mention goes to scene-stealer Pepi the delivery boy- I’m still trying to figure out how to get him as my outgoing voicemail message.\n\nOne of the famous scenes in this film (as well as in You’ve Got Mail) is the disastrous face-to-face meeting of the two lovers at a café. Identifying herself with a red flower in a book, Margaret Sullavan has no idea that her true love is standing across from her in the form of tall, lanky Jimmy Stewart. While watching The Shop Around the Corner, I recommend drinking a Red Carnation.\n\nRed Carnation\n\n1 ½ oz Vodka\n\n2 oz Sparkling pomegranate juice\n\n½ oz lime juice\n\n½ oz Vanilla vodka\n\nDash of bitters\n\nTopo Chico sparkling water\n\nSprig of mint for garnish\n\nCombine ingredients in a cocktail shaker filled with ice, and stir to combine. Strain into a glass with crushed ice, top with Topo Chico, and garnish with mint.\n\nThis is a great movie to watch while you’re wrapping gifts because the dialogue is so darn snappy. And perhaps it will inspire you to go back out to the store for a cigarette case that plays music. Or, maybe you can just send Pepi. Cheers!\n\nIt happened again this year- I found myself getting sucked down the Hallmark Christmas movie wormhole. I tell myself I’ll just watch this one about a single mom who has sworn off men but then meets the love of her life working at a soup kitchen (it’s always a soup kitchen), until 6 hours later I’m wrapped up in a blanket cocoon, cookie crumbs everywhere, weeping as fake snow falls around yet another happy couple in chunky sweaters (it’s always a chunky sweater). Clearly, I’m in need of something to wean me off of this TV movie crack. To that end, I’ll be watching The Family Stone (DVD/Download). It’s got the lighthearted romance I crave, mixed with the gravitas of a cancer-subplot that tugs at the heartstrings. But also, it includes some intelligent conversations about world cultures and gay rights. I like to think of this one as Hallmark for the liberal elite.\n\nThe Family Stone stars Sarah Jessica Parker as an uptight career gal who is brought home to meet her boyfriend’s family at Christmas. From the NPR-tote bag-carrying little sister played by Rachel McAdams, to the funky jewelry/Coldwater Creek-wearing mom played by Diane Keaton, The Family Stone is full of lofty ideals and snarky judgement. To be fair, Parker’s character says some pretty abominable things when she gets nervous and backed into a corner, but still- tough crowd. Luckily Luke Wilson is around to lighten up the mood, as well as Craig T. Nelson in his typical gentle giant patriarch role. There are some fun moments where SJP finally lets her “freak flag fly”, but then- cancer (it’s always cancer).\n\nThe house in this film is meant to evoke all the warm fuzzies. It’s messy, full of love, and big enough for a crowd. And what is the perfect thing to drink at a New England holiday gathering? Pumpkin Spice Lattes of course! I’m making mine a little boozy because family get-togethers can be rough. While watching The Family Stone, I recommend drinking a Spiked Pumpkin Spice Latte.\n\nSpiked Pumpkin Spice Latte\n\n5 cups strong brewed coffee\n\n3 cups milk\n\n½ cup heavy whipping cream\n\n½ cup Bourbon\n\n½ cup Bailey’s Irish Cream\n\n¼ cup canned pure pumpkin\n\n1/3 cup sugar\n\n1 tsp vanilla\n\n1 tsp pumpkin pie spice\n\nWhipped cream topping\n\nIn a slow cooker, mix all ingredients except the whipped cream topping. Stir with a whisk until well combined. Cover and cook on High setting 2 hours, stirring once after an hour. Serve in mugs, and top with whipped cream and additional pumpkin pie spice.\n\nThis would be a great drink to serve on Christmas morning when you’re opening gifts and settling in for a lazy day with food and family. Or, you could be like me and make a whole pot for yourself, not realizing until you’re 3 Hallmark movies in that you’ve consumed a week’s worth of heavy cream and alcohol. Whatever works for you and yours. Cheers!\n\nThis is serious folks- I’ve been writing Cinema Sips for three years, and I’m starting to run out of Christmas movies! Next year we might be down to The Gremlins. It’s bad. Thankfully, last year’s masterpiece Carol (DVD/Download) has delayed the inevitable just a little bit longer. Featuring 1950’s holiday dysfunction, beautiful vintage clothes, and classic cocktails, this is the perfect thing to kick off a season of overindulging.\n\nBased on the novel by Patricia Highsmith (a personal favorite author of mine), Carol tells the unlikely love story between glamorous suburban housewife Carol, and bohemian shopgirl/photographer Therese. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara portray these characters so beautifully, and I find myself rooting for their impossible romance with all my heart. Director Todd Haynes has made what feels like a classic film in modern times, and this quiet story that happens to be set at Christmas is just the reminder I need that despite the tinsel and holiday music and greeting cards, real life is still happening too.\n\nI’ve said it before and I’ll say it again- nobody drinks a martini like Cate Blanchett. She’s in rare form here, ordering a lunch of dry martinis and poached eggs with creamed spinach. I’m not sure this combo is the best (or most appetizing) food pairing, it is the best cocktail choice for this movie. While watching Carol, I recommend drinking a Dry Martini (with an olive).*\n\nDry Martini\n\n2 ½ oz Gin\n\n½ oz Dry Vermouth\n\n1-2 Olives\n\nStir gin and vermouth in a cocktail shaker filled with ice. Strain into a martini glass and garnish with an olive.\n\nI’ll always love my old Christmas stand-bys like The Holiday, Love Actually, Little Women, etc, but it feels good to add a new classic to the mix. Sipping a martini in a Sandy Powell dress while 1950’s New York buzzes around you? Sounds like a perfect holiday fantasy to me. Cheers!\n\n(*Note: I made this same cocktail selection two years ago for The Thin Man. Perhaps a double feature is in order!)\n\nIf you’re like me, the end of November is a panic-inducing time where I realize that I have a million people on my Christmas shopping list and NO IDEA what to buy. The rise in online shopping options means that I haven’t been to a mall in years, however I almost wouldn’t mind going if it meant I could run into Claire Danes at the Saks glove department in this week’s film Shopgirl (DVD/Download).\n\nAdapted from the novella by Steve Martin, Shopgirl stars Claire Danes as Mirabelle Buttersfield, a 20-something visual artist caught in a love triangle between clueless hipster Jeremy and emotionally distant millionaire Ray. Steve Martin’s performance as Ray is quiet and nuanced, and refreshingly different from his broader comedic roles. And as the well-meaning but utterly oblivious suitor Jeremy, Jason Schwartzman brings to mind so many hapless men of his generation. With less-than-ideal romantic options such as these, it’s no wonder Mirabelle spirals into depression.\n\nI love that one of Jeremy’s steps toward maturing is a newfound appreciation for cocktails. He tries a mojito for the first time, and we see the wheels spinning. Yes- there is more to life than cheap beer. As further ode to this film’s stunning visual depiction of the city of Los Angeles, while watching Shopgirl I recommend drinking an Echo Park Mojito.\n\nEcho Park Mojito\n\n1 oz blood orange juice\n\n1 Tbsp lime juice\n\n1 oz light rum\n\n2 Tbsp simple syrup\n\nTopo Chico sparkling water\n\n5-6 sprigs of mint\n\nPour blood orange juice, lime juice, and simple syrup into a glass. Add the mint leaves and muddle them. Add rum and crushed ice, then top the rest of the way with Topo Chico. Stir gently. Garnish with fresh mint.\n\nI can identify with Mirabelle’s plight of having to take a retail job to support her dreams of being an artist, because I too have been a shopgirl in the past. It’s just what you do when you have a creative dream. You stand behind that counter and hope that maybe someday, somebody looks at you and declares, “this one has value”. And in the meantime, there are cocktails. Cheers!"
