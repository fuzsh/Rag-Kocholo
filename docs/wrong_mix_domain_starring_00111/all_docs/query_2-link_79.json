        "text": "#10: “500 Days of Summer” (2009)\n\nMost people can probably agree that Tom Hansen and Summer Finn weren’t meant to be. But there's no denying that \"500 Days of Summer\" is a quintessential 2000s rom-com. The film follows the emotional roller-coaster that is the relationship between Tom and Summer, two greeting card company employees. She clearly doesn’t want anything serious, but he lets himself get swept up in the romance and falls hard. Of course, things don't end well. Covering everything from their meet-cute to their heartbreaking goodbye, \"500 Days\" is an honest look at how some romances just aren’t meant to last.\n\n#9: “No Reservations” (2007)\n\nWhen it comes to her career, acclaimed head chef Kate runs a tight ship. And the same can be said of her personal life, too. But everything changes when the ill-tempered perfectionist becomes responsible for the care of her young niece. And things get even crazier when fellow chef Nick begins working at the restaurant. This 2007 flick aces the classic opposites attract trope. as we watch them flirt, argue, and ultimately win each other over. Between the heat in the kitchen and the piping hot chemistry between lead actors Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart, \"No Reservations\" has all the right ingredients.\n\n#8: “Woman of the Year” (1942)\n\nThe first collaboration between screen legends Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, \"Woman of the Year,\" is a true classic. Tess and Sam both work for the same newspaper, but they despise each other. That is, until they eventually fall in love. They say their \"I do’s,\" but he struggles with how dedicated she is to her career. Released in 1942, the film is very much a product of its time and features some problematic ideas around gender. Still, Tess is a powerful female character from an era where strong cinematic roles for women were few and far between.\n\n#7: “Secretary” (2002)\n\nLong before there was \"50 Shades of Grey\", there was \"Secretary.\" In 2002, audiences were buzzing over this dark comedy following a receptionist named Lee and her boss Mr. Grey, as they ventured into a BDSM relationship. Underneath its mature subject matter, the story is an exploration of mental health, sexuality, and power dynamics. To make matters even more interesting, the picture features Academy Award nominee Maggie Gyllenhaal in her breakout role alongside James Spader. Although such topics have become less taboo in the years since the film’s debut, the story continues to be discussed by many today.\n\n#6: “Set It Up” (2018)\n\nWhen burned out corporate assistants Harper and Charlie discover that their overbearing bosses are single, they hatch a plan to fix them up. As the two assistants turned matchmakers cleverly execute their scheme, they discover that they have feelings for each other, too. This is the plot of 2018's Netflix original movie, \"Set It Up,\" starring Zoey Deutch, Glen Powell, Lucy Liu and Taye Diggs. The story is an exploration of hustle culture, and the importance of work-life balance in modern times. Yet it also has the perfect lighthearted rom-com aesthetic that’s sure to make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside!\n\n#5: “Jerry Maguire” (1996)\n\nThere’s absolutely no doubt that “Jerry Maguire” is one of the '90s most quotable flicks. The Cameron Crowe written and directed flick is about a big-time sports agent experiencing a major life shift. After he's fired from his job, Jerry and his colleague, single mom Dorothy, venture off to start a firm of their own. And soon enough, sparks begin to fly between them. The film is packed with star power, featuring big names like Tom Cruise, Renée Zellweger, and Cuba Gooding Jr. The latter actor even won an Oscar for his portrayal of Rod.\n\n#4: “Broadcast News” (1987)\n\nTaking audiences behind the scenes of a hard-hitting television program, \"Broadcast News\" was an awards darling in the late ‘80s. Indeed, it was nominated for a slew of Oscars, including Best Picture. The story follows hard-working producer Jane as she finds herself in the middle of a workplace love triangle. Caught between two polar opposite reporters, Tom and Aaron, she attempts to balance her job and personal life. Conceived by James L. Brooks and led by actors Holly Hunter, William Hurt, and Albert Brooks, this cerebral and satirical portrayal of the media hasn’t lost its punch.\n\n#3: “Two Weeks Notice” (2002)\n\nThey’re the three little words that every employer dreads: “two weeks notice.\" But those same words gave us the title and plot of the 2002 movie starring Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant. When overworked lawyer Lucy hands over her resignation to her clueless and wealthy boss George, their relationship is forever changed. As her last day of work draws near, we see that a growing attraction between them is about to complicate things. With a winning plot and two of the greatest romantic comedy stars, \"Two Weeks Notice\" is one flick that's too good to pass up.\n\n#2: “Working Girl” (1988)\n\nA staple of the romantic dramedy genre, \"Working Girl\" was one of the hottest films of its time. Between the blowouts and outfits, this Mike Nichols directed picture is definitely peak ‘80s. After her cruel boss Katharine becomes incapacitated, undervalued assistant Tess takes matters into her own hands. The OG “girlboss,” she assumes the identity of her superior and sets out to prove her worth. She meets Jack Trainer along the way, and business and romance begin to mix. Melanie Griffith, Sigourney Weaver, Harrison Ford, and Joan Cusack make up the movie’s talented cast, providing a sincere portrayal of gender politics and corporate life.\n\n#1: “His Girl Friday” (1940)\n\nBased on the 1928 Broadway play, \"The Front Page,\" \"His Girl Friday\" has kept cinema lovers laughing for over 80 years. And we don’t think that’s going to change anytime soon. It’s the story of newspaper editor Walter and his former spouse and reporter, Hildy. She’s about to remarry, so he tries to stop her by offering her the chance to cover a career-defining story. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell portray the exes, whose comedic timing and chemistry are off the charts. Their fast-paced dialogue and exchanges make the film a classic, setting a high rom-com bar that few movies have managed to reach."
