        "text": "MARINA DEL RAY, Calif. -- Dennis Quaid's bags are packed for football training camp.\n\nHe'll be joining the San Francisco 49ers in a few weeks to get in shape for his next movie.\n\nIn Oliver Stone's On Any Given Sunday, Quaid will play a Joe Montana-style quarterback who must grapple with the downside of his career.\n\n\"The whole thought of football camp and making this movie brings back a lot of painful memories,\" says Quaid.\n\n\"On my last football movie (Taylor Hackford's Everybody's All-American), I broke my collarbone.\"\n\nThere's a touch of irony in Quaid's movie image as a super athlete.\n\n\"I was too small for sports in high school,\" he says.\n\n\"That's how I got into drama. Sports are a rite of passage for guys in Texas and that's something I didn't go through.\"\n\nThat was a sore spot for Dennis, whose brother Randy Quaid was a hulking athlete and a bit of a family bully.\n\n\"There's a trail of blood in my youth from all the beatings I took from Randy. He beat up on me regularly and relentlessly. The only time I really ever got back at him was once when I locked him out of the house. It drove him crazy.\"\n\nIt's Quaid's new movie, The Parent Trap, that has him reflecting about his upbringing and his marriage to actress Meg Ryan.\n\nIn The Parent Trap, Quaid plays a divorced American wine baron whose twin daughters conspire to get him to fall in love with their mother (Natasha Richardson) all over again.\n\n\"My parents divorced when I was 12,\" says Quaid.\n\n\"I still have a secret fantasy of getting them back together. It's because I was the peacemaker in our family, so I always felt it was my duty to get them back together.\"\n\nQuaid feels one of the reasons the original 1961 Disney version of The Parent Trap and his version appeal to families is that \"we all fantasize about the perfect nuclear family, even if we don't have one.\"\n\nThe 44-year-old actor has been married to Ryan, 37, for seven years. They have a six-year-old son, John Henry.\n\nQuaid was married briefly to actress P.J. Soles. He and Ryan first worked together in 1987 on the film Innerspace but, as he recalls, \"we were both involved with other people at the time, so we never became more than friends.\"\n\nTwo years later, they were reteamed for D.O.A.\n\n\"Our other relationships had ended and we were filming on my home turf in Texas, so I felt more confident.\n\n\"It really helped that we were already good friends.\"\n\nIt was Ryan who helped Quaid deal with his drug and alcohol addictions. Today, they are a model Hollywood couple.\n\n\"The paparazzi aren't interested in Meg and I any more. The days of having photographers follow us everywhere are mercifully behind us.\n\n\"What makes our marriage work is that our identities are no longer wrapped up in our careers. We're a husband and wife who also just happen to be working actors.\n\n\"There's no competition between us and therefore no The Parent Trap. When Disney offered me the role, I said I'd have to think about it.\n\n\"Meg told me there was absolutely nothing to think about. The Parent Trap is one of her all-time favorite movies.\n\n\"She says it was her introduction to screen romance and she knows this new one will have the same effect on a whole new generation of young girls.\" Tuesday, July 28, 1998\n\nParenting no trap for Dennis\n\nStar credits six-year-old son with giving him a new perspective\n\nBy BOB THOMPSON -- Toronto Sun Sunday, October 26, 1997\n\nSwitched-on Quaid\n\nBy LISA WILTON -- Calgary Sun\n\nTuesday, May 28, 1996\n\nDennis Quaid comes clean\n\nBy LOUIS B. HOBSON -- Calgary Sun Sunday, May 26, 1996\n\nRomantic Knight\n\nDennis Quaid continues his life's quest in 'Dragonheart'\n\nBy WILDER PENFIELD III -- Toronto Sun July 31, 1995\n\nDennis Finds Something To Talk About"
