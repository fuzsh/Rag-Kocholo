        "text": "Get\n\nActor Dennis Quaid is engaged!\n\n“Extra's” Jenn Lahmers caught up with Quaid, just hours after he asked his girlfriend, Laura Savoie, to marry him.\n\nWhile promoting his new movie “Midway” in Hawaii alongside his co-stars Woody Harrelson and Patrick Wilson, Quaid confirmed that he is engaged. He shared, “It happened on the very northernmost point of Oahu, at Turtle Bay. It was kind of spontaneous. It was very much a surprise.”\n\n“I had the ring in my pocket… It has been kind of a month-and-a-half plan… I wanted it to be private,” Dennis added of the “sunset” proposal.\n\n“She was actually taking a selfie of us, and I put the ring in front and said, 'Will you marry me?' — and then she fell down,” Dennis dished.\n\nThe 65-year-old and the 26-year-old PhD student at the University of Texas have been dating since this summer.\n\nOn a professional note, Quaid is playing Vice Admiral William \"Bull\" Halsey in “Midway,” which is based on the real events of the 1942 Battle of Midway between the American forces and the Imperial Japanese Navy, the battle after Pearl Harbor.\n\nQuaid commented, “He was such a character, such a strong personality men would follow him anywhere.”\n\nThe role gave him the opportunity to get a better understanding of the famous battle. He said one of the perks of doing the film was, “Learning more about Midway, 'cause I heard about it when I was a kid.”"
