But when Cher finds herself falling for him, she’ll do whatever it takes to make him believe she’s more than just a pretty face.\n\n38. Sense and Sensibility (1995)\n\nAn adaptation of Jane Austen’s novel of the same name, Sense and Sensibility is a classic tale of love. Two sisters, Elinor (Emma Thompson) and Marianne (Kate Winslet) Dashwood are suddenly left with nothing when their father dies and their half-brother leaves them empty-handed.\n\nThough the sisters are struggling to adjust to life as peasants, they still have time to pursue gentlemen callers. Marianne is smitten with both John Willoughby (Greg Wise) and Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman). Elinor has fallen for Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant), who’s wholly unavailable.

What they do have is a budding romance. While struggling to keep their new business afloat, Jerry and Dorothy find themselves falling for one another.\n\n41. Romeo and Juliet (1996)\n\nWe all know the story and the brutal ending, but it’s director Baz Luhrmann’s touch that makes this retelling so brilliant. Set in Verona Beach, the Capulets and the Montagues are warring mafia rivals. When Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) spots Juliet (Claire Danes) at a party, it’s love at first sight.\n\nIn a rapid-fire chain of bloody deaths and hurried teenage lust, Romeo and Juliet secretly marry. When Juliet’s family declares she must marry someone else, she foolishly turns to a fake suicide plot. The movie ends the same way we expect, but it’s the gorgeous imagery and beach scenes that change the way we watch this movie. From the pair’s first meeting while staring at each other between an aquarium to the gruesome double suicide, this movie is not your grandmother’s Shakespeare.\n\n42. One Fine Day (1996)\n\nAfter being late to the bus for her son Sammy’s (Alex D. Linz) field trip, Melanie (Michelle Pfeiffer), a single mother, is forced to work together with fellow single parent, Jack (George Clooney) to entertain their children throughout a busy work day.

The dog also helps him get more attention from Carol. Through a series of good deeds and a love for the dog, a friendship grows between Melvin, Carol, and Simon. While a dog is no real cure for OCD, love and friendship might help it seem more manageable. The story goes outside the bounds of your classic rom-com, and it even landed both Nicholson and Hunt Academy Awards.\n\nRELATED: Why Tim Riggins from Friday Night Lights Is Our #1 TV Boyfriend\n\n44. My Best Friend’s Wedding (1997)\n\nJulianne (Julia Roberts) and Michael (Demot Mulroney) always agreed to get married at 28 if they were both single. But when 27-year-old Michael calls Julianne to tell her he’s marrying a 20-year-old named Kimmy (Cameron) in four days, Julianne realizes that she’s been in love with Michael all along. She heads to Chicago to stop the wedding and tell Michael how she feels.\n\nAs Julianne attempts to sabotage the wedding, she uses her gay friend George and pretends to be engaged to him to make Michael jealous. Basically, Julianne makes a bunch of foolish choices and in the process hurts many of the people closest to her. While it may seem predictable, the best part of this movie is the fact that things don’t turn out exactly how you’d think.\n\n45. Titanic (1997)\n\nOur hearts are still having a hard time moving on from this Leo and Kate classic. When divers in 1996 are looking for a rare diamond hidden in the remains of the Titanic, elderly Rose comes to help them find it, since she was the original owner. This brings back memories of the Titanic for Rose. In 1912, Rose (Kate Winslet) was 17 and just stepping onto the giant ship. At the same time, Jack Dawson (Leonardo Dicaprio) gambled his way onto the Titanic with dreams of being an artist.\n\nRose is deeply unhappy in her high-class life, and she is engaged to marry someone she doesn’t love. She considers jumping off the ship’s edge, but Jack steps in and tries to stop her. While at first Rose doesn’t want to be with Jack, she quickly falls in love with him and they start a secret affair. And then the Titanic never sinks, and they get to live happily ever after. Right? We wish. Even though we all know the ending, it’s still a beautiful story about following your own path and falling in love with the most unlikely of people. We’ll debate the door in the icy water later.\n\nRELATED: 13 Titanic Movie Facts to Help Your Heart Go On\n\n46. The Parent Trap (1998)\n\nWhen Hallie Parker and Annie James (Lindsay Lohan and Lindsay Lohan) meet at summer camp, they immediately hate each other. The fact that they happen to look exactly the same doesn’t help, either.

The twins decide to switch places, one in California, the other in London, so they can meet the parent they’ve never known.\n\nWhile Hallie has a blast with her unwitting mom Liz (Natasha Richardson) in London, Annie has trouble keeping her accent straight around her vineyard owner dad Nick (Dennis Quaid) and his new evil girlfriend. Hallie is found out, and is forced to return to California with her mom. When they arrive, the twins find out that Nick wants to marry his girlfriend. Can the girls make their parents fall back in love before the wedding and before the family is forced to be separated again?\n\n47. Shakespeare in Love (1998)\n\nWe all like to imagine that Shakespeare’s own love life was as inspired as his plays. In this movie, a young William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) is suffering from writer’s block. But when Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), a wealthy merchant’s daughter, disguises herself as a man and auditions for his play, something changes. Shakespeare questions her audition, and she runs away. She gets the part, but the real fun begins when Shakespeare meets Viola as a woman. They dance together and something lights up in both of them.\n\nInspired by Viola, Shakespeare begins writing a little play called Romeo and Juliet. Maybe you’ve heard of it? Unfortunately for Will and Viola, the bounds that keep Romeo and Juliet apart ring a little too true for their real lives. Even though Shakespeare in Love is fictional, we can’t help but hope that a love like this actually inspired Shakespeare.\n\n48. There’s Something About Mary (1998)\n\nTed (Ben Stiller) has been in love with Mary (Cameron Diaz) since high school.

But can he make it through Pat and Mary’s other suitors to redo that night at prom?\n\n49. The Wedding Singer (1998)\n\nAdam Sandler with a mullet — it's better than you’d think!

She wants him to help her plan her upcoming wedding to Glenn Gulia (Matthew Glave).\n\nJulia, soon to be Julia Gulia, and Robbie spend more time together as he gets over his breakup and ruined wedding while they plan Julia’s wedding.

Or will Robbie whip out a sweet song for her and save both of them? Only time will tell.\n\n50. You’ve Got Mail (1998)\n\nIndependent bookstores for the win. Kathleen (Meg Ryan) runs a struggling bookstore, and she’s constantly competing with Fox Books, an evil chain store owned by Joe Fox (Tom Hanks). This was the beginning of email and the Internet, and Kathleen and Joe take full advantage. Without knowing each other’s identities the pair begins an online romance through email.\n\nIn real life, Joe and Kathleen continue to hate each other. Her store goes under due to Fox Books’ success, and Kathleen realizes that even though her store and dream have died, Fox Books might not be so bad. When the two of them meet in real life with their email identities, they have to reconcile the love and the hate that unites them. Hey, at least they’re both book people!\n\n51. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)\n\nIt’s the ideal 90s romantic comedy. Inspired by Shakespeare’s Taming of the Shrew, 10 Things I Hate About You follows sisters Kat (Julia Stiles) and Bianca (Larisa Oleynik), who couldn’t be more different. Kat is smart, serious, downright rude to many of her classmates, and couldn’t care less about the “no dating” rule her father has implemented, because she’s full of disdain for the boys at her school. Bianca is ditzy, popular, and desperately wants a date.\n\nWhen nerdy new kid Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) develops a crush on Bianca, the two of them devise a plan to get a date for Kat, thus making it okay for Bianca to date. The pair pays bad boy Patrick (Heath Ledger) to take out fearsome Kat, but when the two of them develop real feelings for each other, will everything come crashing down? This movie, set in beautiful Seattle, also gives us the gift of Kat’s version of a Shakespeare sonnet, titled “10 Things I Hate About You.”\n\n52. Notting Hill (1999)\n\nWe all know that quote: “I’m just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.” The thing is that American movie star Anna (Julia Roberts) is not just a girl, and Will (Hugh Grant) really is just a boy. A bookstore owner in London, to be exact. When the couple meets at Will’s bookstore, Anna proves to be more than what her movies suggest. Though the two connect deeply, it seems impossible for them to ever be together due to their vastly different lives.\n\nBut their paths keep crossing. Though they try to stay away from each other, there’s a magnetic field between them that keeps them coming back together. Great supporting characters make this movie even better, and it’s the encouragement from his friends that gives Will the final push to see Anna as something more than just a movie star. After all, don’t we all want to be seen for something more than our label?\n\n53. Love and Basketball (2000)\n\nWhen Quincy (Omar Epps) meets Monica (Sanaa Lathan), they’re just kids who love basketball more than life itself.

At prom, Monica reveals her feelings to Quincy and they make love for the first time.\n\nThey go to the University of Southern California as a couple, but things get harder as Quincy gets attention as the best player on the basketball team while Monica has to fight to play and is disliked by her coach. We follow Monica and Quincy for many years as they break up, make up, and always play ball. In the end, we’re cheering for their relationship like it’s the final minute in a tied-up championship game.\n\n54. Meet the Parents (2000)\n\nWhen you marry someone, you also marry their family.

While Greg tries to hang on for Pam’s sake, Jack finally gets his way as Pam breaks up with him. But Greg thinks he can find his way back into Pam’s, and Jack’s, good graces.\n\nRELATED: 8 Romantic Vampire Movies That Will Quench Your Thirst\n\n55. Amélie (2001)\n\nAmélie (Audrey Tautou) likes to skip rocks, dip her hands into grain, and mourn the loss of her childhood fish. Let’s put it this way: She is very lonely. She works at a cafe in Montmartre, France, but it’s not fulfilling. When she finds a tin container in her bathroom full of childhood relics, she sets out on a mission to find the original owner. As she completes the well-meaning task, she takes it upon herself to improve every life she can.\n\nShe helps a blind man see the world around him, sets up couples, and befriends a fragile painter in her apartment building. All the while she is playing a game of cat and mouse with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), a similarly lonely man who’s missing his photo album of rejected photo booth pictures. The movie is whimsical and romantic at its heart, but the true joy is watching for small moments of joy and the pleasure of appreciating the banal instances in life.\n\n56. Bridget Jones’s Diary (2001)\n\nIn this hilarious retelling of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) navigates singlehood in her 30s. Through an endless diet of cigarettes, ice cream, and self-help books, Bridget finds her way into the bed of publishing magnate and certified sex god, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).\n\nWhen Daniel cheats on her with a rude American, Bridget finds herself at a new rock bottom. All the while, Bridget’s old playmate from childhood keeps finding his way into her business. Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) is a grumpy, divorced barrister who seems to think he’s far above Bridget’s shenanigans.

(2001)\n\nIn this musical set in Paris in 1900, romantic writer Christian (Ewan McGregor) falls (literally) into a writing job in the Bohemian movement. After writing Spectacular Spectacular for the Moulin Rouge, Christian meets Satine (Nicole Kidman), though she is under the pretense that he is the wealthy Duke.\n\nThe movie is wild, colorful, and yes, a musical. Although their love might be short-lived, Christian and Satine make the most of their time and we get to see Nicole Kidman as a courtesan. Big Little Lies, who?\n\n58. A Walk to Remember (2002)\n\nNicholas Sparks, how does this still hurt 16 years later? In what seems like a classic bad-boy-meets-good-girl scenario, rebellious Landon (Shane West) has to participate in a school play as punishment for a prank. There, he meets the local minister’s daughter, Jamie (Mandy Moore). She’ll help him learn his lines, with one rule: don’t fall in love with her.\n\nDoes he fall in love with her? Absolutely. Oh, is that a spoiler? You totally knew that was coming. But what comes next isn’t your classic rom-com formula. All we’re saying is that The Fault in Our Stars had to get some inspiration somewhere.

When they get engaged, it’s a wild ride towards the altar with her overbearing parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, second cousins, etc. Toula deserves love after being overshadowed for her whole life, but the really rewarding part of this movie is seeing her fall in love with herself.\n\n61.
