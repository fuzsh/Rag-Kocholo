        "text": "It's officially Christmastime, which means Love Actually is definitely playing right now on someone's screen. Keira Knightley was literally deemed \"perfect\" as Juliet, but the actress herself was feeling very flawed during shooting. As a teen, she had typical acne issues -- hence the hat, which wasn't a trendy fashion choice. Let Knightley explain:\n\nThat is kind of hilarious. Is it surprising to anyone else that she was only 17 when she filmed this movie? It's weird when you think about her character getting married at the start of the film. But considering she carried the name Juliet -- of Shakespearean fame -- and was adored/stalked by her husband's best friend, it's humanizing to think of the very normal girl behind that worship.\n\nThe Nutcracker and the Four Realms star shared her story with BBC Radio 1 (via ET), laughing at how different her memories are vs. what the fans think about when they watch the film:\n\nAnd now we have a new appreciation for that hat. Love Actually is considered one of the best romantic comedies of all time, but it's amazing how much angst was going on behind-the-scenes. Keira Knightley's skin issues are one thing, but we were heartbroken to read about the real pain behind Emma Thompson's famous breakdown scene.\n\nIt has been 15 years since Love Actually first came out, and made more than $246 million around the world, off a reported $40 million budget. Several stars, including Keira Knightley, reunited in 2017 for the Red Nose Day Actually short film as a mini sequel to the feature. It was shown that Juliet was still married to Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Mark (Andrew Lincoln) was still showing up at their door with cue cards."
