        "text": "If you ask Dennis Quaid if he’s content with where he’s at in his long career, he’ll tell you that he’s just “happy to be anywhere.”\n\nAnd he’s not being facetious. After years of drug and alcohol abuse, the ruggedly handsome Texan is finally in a good enough place to fully relish his craft almost as much as he adores his three children: Jack (with ex Meg Ryan), 21, and 5-year-old twins, Thomas and Zoe.\n\nIt hasn’t been easy, he admitted on a recent visit to Boston to promote his latest film, the “Wall Street”-on-a-farm saga, “At Any Price,” which opens Friday.\n\nBut even he is surprised by how far he has come since famously conquering his vices 20 years ago. He even picked up a Screen Actors Guild nomination, playing a closeted executive in 2002’s “Far From Heaven,” and could well pick up another for “Price,” in which he plays a farmer cutting legal and ethical corners to survive in a highly mechanized, big-money business.\n\n“I’m just glad to still be here – I truly, truly am,” said Quaid between puffs on an electronic cigarette while sprawled on a couch in his posh suite at Boston’s Liberty Hotel. “Some of the people I started out with, I wonder where they are now.”\n\nQuaid said his experience in confronting demons helped him fit snuggly into the role of “Price’s” Henry Whipple, a man so trapped by his father’s legacy that he feels compelled to sacrifice just about all decency to win Daddy’s grudging approval. And what Henry wants is not only to be Iowa’s most successful farmer, but also the state’s top salesman for the Monsanto-like seed giant, Liberty.\n\nBut that’s just the cusp of his megalomania. His real desire is to lure his prodigal sons into – excuse the expression – his field. But Henry’s eldest, Grant (Patrick Stevens), thinks so little of the idea, the former Iowa State football star has hightailed it to Peru to take refuge in the Andes, while his little bro, Dean, counts the days until he too can flee, hopefully onto the high-paying NASCAR circuit.\n\nThe recalcitrant kid, if you may not have heard, is portrayed by the love-him or hate-him Zac Efron, who tries his hardest to not just play Dean, but to play him as James Dean.\n\nHe fails, of course, but it’s still a pretty respectable performance.\n\nOne that Quaid sees a lot of his younger self in.\n\n“He’s such a great actor, Quaid said of his much-maligned co-star. “He kind of reminds me of me. He started out in these kinds of heartthrob roles because that’s all they are offering you at that age. But he’s willing to grow and expand. And he’s got all the tools in his toolbox.”\n\nIf Efron is going to continue emulating Quaid, he’s has a pretty tough row to hoe. With more than 60 films to his credit, or about one flick for each of his 59 years, Quaid has managed to be that rare actor who is always in demand.\n\n“The only strategy I’ve had is to try and do as many different types of characters as I can because I’ve always seen myself as a character actor,” said Quaid, who has played everything from an astronaut (“The Right Stuff”) and pro quarterback (“Any Given Sunday”) to President Bill Clinton (“The Special Relationship”).\n\nFew roles, he says, have captivated him as thoroughly as Henry, who Quaid insists is a decent guy even though he cheats on his wife (Kim Dickens) almost as much as he cheats on his employer.\n\n“I don’t see Henry Whipple as a bad guy,” said Quaid, dressed comfortably in faded jeans and a stylish sweater. “I see Henry as a person living in a world he no longer recognizes. He came from being a kid on his family’s farm. And now it’s all becoming about technology and corporations, and this sort of Wall Street atmosphere of ‘get big or get out.’ And he’s swept up in it. He’s become kind of ruthless . . . and he actually believes his own delusional thinking. But inside, he feels broken. And as this film progresses, he starts to crack.”\n\nQuaid said he was intrigued by Henry, but the reason he accepted the role was director Ramin Bahrani, the North Carolinian who has won universal acclaim for modest, deeply touching indies like “Goodbye Solo” and “Man Push Cart.” But it was Bahrani’s “Chop Shop” that sealed the deal.\n\n“The performances in that were amazing,” said Quaid of “Chop Shop,” which tells the affecting tale of a 12-year-old New York street orphan (non-actor Alejandro Polanco) scraping by in a Queens scrapyard.\n\n“That kid was so natural, so compelling, that when Ramin and I met, I said, ‘Look, if you can get a performance out of me like you did with that kid, that’s what I want to do.’”\n\nEven though he’s playing farming’s version of a stage mother, Quaid said he could never see himself manipulating his children the way Henry does, swearing he never pressured son, Jack, into entering the family business.\n\n“With him, I guess, it’s because both his father and his mother are actors,” a proud and beaming Quaid said of Jack, best known for playing Marvel in the megahit, “The Hunger Games.”\n\n“It just seemed like a natural thing to him right from the very beginning. And he’s doing it all on his own.”\n\nQuaid said he prays Jack never encounters the hordes of paparazzi he and Ryan faced when they were locked in their tumultuous marriage. And as much as he’d love to be rid of that flashbulb vermin, he knows it’s a price he must pay for doing what he enjoys most.\n\n“I’ve become immune to it in a certain sense because it comes with the territory,” he said of the undue attention. “And I love acting too much to ever want to give it up.”"
