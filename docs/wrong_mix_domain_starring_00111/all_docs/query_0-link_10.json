        "text": "In many ways, I owe the existence of Cinema Sips to this week’s film, Far From Heaven (Disc/Download). When I had the idea seven years ago to start writing about films and cocktails, it was based on the image of Julianne Moore in a perfect pastel 1950s dress, pouring a pitcher of daiquiris for her girlfriends in the middle of the day. That, right there, was the life I wanted for myself. Unfortunately, I (and most of my girlfriends) have day jobs. There are no lunchtime daiquiris, and most of us live in different states at this point. But what if we could all watch a movie, make a cocktail, and feel like we were together? And what if I could share the experience with the whole world? Just like that, Cinema Sips was born.\n\nIt’s no shock that I adore this movie, since I’ve raved on here before about my love of the ’50s melodrama. From Douglas Sirk films like Magnificent Obsession and All That Heaven Allows, to Sirk-adjacent picks like Peyton Place and A Summer Place, I simply cannot get enough of beautiful facades hiding the torrid scandals of a soap opera. Every detail of Todd Haynes’ homage to vintage melodramas is perfection, from the tailored dresses, to the stellar production design, to the script that touches on everything from racism to homosexual shame to domestic violence. You see, even though these characters exist in an idyllic world of brightly colored autumn leaves and silk party dresses, beneath that surface lies a lot of pain and sadness.\n\nAs I mentioned, this movie gets me very excited about daiquiris in the middle of the day. If you’re looking for that recipe, you can find it here. However, now I’d like to pay tribute to modern housewives, who, each September, start sucking back the Pumpkin Spice products like a seasonal heroin. Pumpkin Spice was not really “a thing” during the 1950s, but if it were, I’m pretty sure Cathy and her gal pals would be enjoying a pitcher of these Pumpkin Spice Margaritas.\n\nPumpkin Spice Margaritas\n\n2 parts Reposado Tequila\n\n1 part Cointreau\n\n1 part Lime Juice\n\n2 parts Pumpkin Spice Puree*\n\nCombine all ingredients in a cocktail pitcher with ice. Stir until chilled, then pour into glasses filled with fresh ice.\n\n*Pumpkin Spice Puree: Combine 1 cup brown sugar + 1 cup Water + 2 Tsp Ground Pumpkin Spice in a saucepan. Heat until lightly boiling and the sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat, then stir in 3/4 cup Canned Pure Pumpkin Puree. Cool, and refrigerate.\n\nIn the role of Cathy Whitaker, Julianne Moore shows us that even though many of us may look back fondly on a lot of things from this era, in the end we’re only gazing at a pretty picture. The reality was anything but pretty. If I had my pick, I’d leave the intolerance back in the previous century, but keep the dresses and decor. Day-drinking with friends can also stay. Cheers!\n\nFor anybody who thinks Breaking Away (Disc/Download) is only about cycling, let me enlighten you to the real reason we watch this movie— Dennis. Quaid’s. Abs. All kidding aside, this is a great flick for when you find yourself in the summer doldrums, waiting for something to change, even when it seems like nothing ever will. It’s a movie about feeling like you’re on the precipice of… something. You just don’t know what yet.\n\nStarring Beck doppelgänger Dennis Christopher as a teen obsessed with Italian cyclists, Breaking Away follows Dave and his three buddies as they figure out how to go from high school to adulthood. As “townies” in Bloomington, IN, they’re ridiculed by the university jocks and frat boys, their ambitions reduced to pipe dreams that’ll never come true. But Dave doesn’t care—he goes after the pretty sorority girl, pretends he’s Italian, and trains obsessively to compete in the local bike race. His friends think he’s a little nuts, his parents think he’s really nuts, but none of that matters. He’s got a goal, and nothing’s gonna stop him.\n\nWhen the Italian racers come to Indiana, they’re sponsored by the Cinzano alcohol brand. How fortuitous for Cinema Sips! But the thing is, these Cinzano racers are evil. Threatened by Dave’s natural talent, they sabotage his bike, leaving him broken and bloody on the side of the road. So I’m boycotting Cinzano, in favor of my other favorite summertime Italian aperitif Aperol. While watching Breaking Away, I recommend drinking this Cutter Collins.\n\nCutter Collins\n\n1 ½ oz Gin\n\n1 ½ oz Aperol\n\n¾ oz Lemon Juice\n\n¼ oz Simple Syrup\n\n4 basil leaves, roughly torn\n\n½ oz Prosecco\n\nCombine all ingredients in a shaker with ice, and shake until well chilled and combined. Strain into a glass filled with crushed ice, and top with prosecco. Garnish with a sprig of basil.\n\nFor anyone who’s ever felt like their dreams are unattainable, this is a good reminder that hard work and dedication can go a long way. Also, it’s okay to ask for a little help from your friends. Especially if that friend is a glistening, shirtless Dennis Quaid. Cheers!\n\nHappy Election Day! I know, the future of our nation rests on the results tonight. However, I felt it time to weigh in on an even more important topic- fictional presidents. There have been so many memorable performances, making it incredibly hard to choose. Nevertheless, here are my picks for Top Five Movie Presidents. They may not be who I’d want in office (except you Michael Douglas!!) but they are the most memorable:\n\nBill Pullman, Independence Day\n\nAh, Bill Pullman. Or is it Paxton? No, it’s Pullman. He’s the voice of reason in an otherwise campy doomsday fest. He will not vanish without a fight!!!\n\n2. Billy Bob Thornton, Love Actually\n\nIs this supposed to be Bill Clinton? With the accent of a Bush? Either way, his performance is smarmy and perfect, and gives America a sense of what the rest of the world thinks of our elected officials.\n\n3. Michael Douglas, The American President\n\nHe’s handsome, he’s single, he’s a Democrat- what more could a girl want? Oh, he also gives fantastic inspirational speeches, wants to pass meaningful gun legislation, and still gets nervous around a beautiful woman. *sigh*\n\n4. Terry Crews, Idiocracy\n\nThis one hits a little too close to home. Political satire or Mike Judge’s crystal ball? Only time will tell.\n\n5. Dennis Quaid, American Dreamz\n\nOh, thinly-veiled W. Bless your little heart."
