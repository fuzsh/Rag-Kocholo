Quaid says, \"God is in the relationship. I've never had a relationship like that before.\" Together, they launched the production company Bonniedale Films based in Nashville, where the couple live.[50]\n\nQuaid is a Christian, coming to faith around 1990 after struggling with addiction.[51] He wrote the Christian song \"On My Way to Heaven\" dedicated to his mother and included in the film I Can Only Imagine, in which Quaid starred.[52]\n\nIn addition to acting, Quaid is a musician and plays with his band, the Sharks.

After the filming of The Express: The Ernie Davis Story, Quaid went to Cleveland Browns Stadium to dedicate Davis's jersey.\n\nQuaid began podcasting in 2020. He started The Pet Show with Dennis Quaid and Jimmy Jellinek. Its first episode premiered on July 10, 2020.[54] During that podcast, Quaid learned of a cat in Lynchburg, Virginia also named Dennis Quaid.[55] He adopted the cat and flew it out to California to live at his recording studio.[56]\n\nThere have been extensive stories about Quaid's past abuse of cocaine. In an 2002 interview with Larry King on his talk show, after King asked about his motives for using drugs, Quaid responded, \"Well, you got to put it in context. Back in the late 1960s, early 1970s. That was back during the time where, you know, drugs were going to expand our minds and everybody was experimenting and everything. We were really getting high, we didn't know it. And cocaine at that time was considered harmless. You know. I remember magazine articles in People Magazine of doctors saying it is not addicting. It is just—alcohol is worse. So I think we all fell into that. But that's not the way it was.\"\n\nWhen Quaid was asked if he believed he had ever been addicted to the drugs, Quaid responded, \"It was a gradual thing. But it got to the point where I couldn't have any fun unless I had it. Which is a bad place to be.\" Later in the interview, he said, \"But I saw myself being dead in about five years if I didn't stop.\"[57]\n\nIn a 2018 interview with the New York Post, Quaid stated he was a registered Independent and has voted for both Democratic and Republican candidates, saying that he did not consider himself an adherent to any particular ideology; though he did opine that Ronald Reagan was his favorite president of his lifetime.[58] In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Quaid stated that President Donald Trump was handling the pandemic well, calling him \"involved.\"[59] Quaid subsequently recorded an interview with infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci as part of an advertising campaign by the Department of Health and Human Services to \"defeat despair\" surrounding COVID-19.[60]\n\nIn May 2024, Quaid endorsed Donald Trump for president during an interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored.[61]\n\nYear Title Role Notes Ref(s) 1975 Crazy Mama Bellhop Uncredited 1977 I Never Promised You a Rose Garden Shark, Baseball Pitcher September 30, 1955 Frank 1978 Our Winning Season Paul Morelli The Seniors Alan 1979 Breaking Away Mike 1980 Ed Miller Gorp Mad Grossman 1981 All Night Long Freddie Dupler Caveman Lar Travis Child Stripes Extra at Graduation Ceremony Uncredited [62] 1983 Tough Enough Art Long Jaws 3-D Michael \"Mike\" Brody Gordon Cooper 1984 Dreamscape Alex Gardner 1985 Enemy Mine Willis Davidge 1987 Det.
