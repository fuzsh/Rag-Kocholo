        "text": "American actor (born 1992)\n\nJack Henry Quaid (born April 24, 1992)[2] is an American actor. The son of actors Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid, he made his acting debut with a minor role in the dystopian film The Hunger Games (2012). His breakout role was as vigilante Hughie Campbell in the satirical superhero series The Boys (2019–present).\n\nQuaid was part of the main cast of the drama series Vinyl (2016). He has voiced Brad Boimler in Star Trek: Lower Decks since 2020, and Superman in My Adventures with Superman since 2023. In film, he has appeared in Logan Lucky (2017), starred as Richie Kirsch in the slasher film Scream (2022), and played theoretical physicist Richard Feynman in Oppenheimer (2023).\n\nQuaid was born on April 24, 1992, in Los Angeles, California,[2] the only child of actors Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid.[3] He was president of the Bad Movie Club at Crossroads School in Santa Monica, California,[4] and attended NYU Tisch School of the Arts for three years.[5]\n\nIn 2012, Quaid made his film debut as Marvel in the film The Hunger Games.[6] In an interview, he explained his experience while filming: \"We had torrential downpours, flooding, scorching heat and then a bear would wander onto the set. But it was an amazing bonding experience. We definitely all had a great story to tell about what we did on our summer vacation.\" He also said that he was warned of a backlash from fans because of his character's dastardly acts: \"When I got cast, I was told that people would be spitting on me in the streets.\" In 2013, he reprised Marvel for a flashback scene in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire in a cameo appearance.\n\nFollowing his involvement with the Hunger Games franchise, Quaid took part in a series of independent films, including his own film Roadies, which was funded through donations on the crowdsourcing website Indiegogo.[7] During this time, he was part of the sketch comedy troop Sasquatch Sketch, which was active from 2013 to 2017,[8] produced dozens of comedy videos, and performed live in the Los Angeles area.[9] Quaid also acted in other comedic webseries and shorts.\n\nQuaid appeared in the main cast of the short-lived television series Vinyl, which premiered in February 2016.[10] In 2017, he appeared in Steven Soderbergh’s heist comedy Logan Lucky, and starred as Jordan Welch in the horror comedy film Tragedy Girls, which was released in theaters on October 20, 2017.[11][12]\n\nOn March 6, 2018, Deadline announced that Quaid was cast as Hugh \"Hughie\" Campbell, the lead role of The Boys.[13] The series premiered in July 2019. Since its debut, it has been renewed for a second, third, and fourth season.[14][15] In late 2018, Quaid and his fellow The Boys co-star Erin Moriarty both appeared in the music video for Creedence Clearwater Revival's song \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain?\".[16]\n\nIn July 2019, Variety announced that Quaid was cast as Ensign Brad Boimler in the new CBS All Access animated series Star Trek: Lower Decks.[17] This follows his voice acting role on the animated series Harvey Girls Forever! In the same year, Quaid starred in romantic-comedy Plus One. In September 2020, he was cast in the fifth Scream film,[18][19] which was released on January 14, 2022.[20][21]\n\nQuaid was cast in Christopher Nolan's historical epic Oppenheimer, released on July 21, 2023.[22] Quaid plays physicist Richard Feynman.[23]\n\nQuaid lived in Los Angeles, California. He was in a relationship with actress Lizzy McGroder from 2016 to 2021.[24][25] In February 2024, Quaid confirmed he was in a relationship with actress and The Boys costar Claudia Doumit.[26]\n\nIn July 2024, Quaid addressed being labeled a \"nepo baby\". In a podcast interview with The Daily Beast, he acknowledged his privileged position and agreed with the label, noting that while his early access to representation gave him a significant advantage in his career, he stressed his efforts to prove his own merit. In the past, his father had also remarked that Quaid was determined to achieve success on his own, referencing his debut in The Hunger Games. Meanwhile, his mother criticized the label, describing it as dismissive of her son's work ethic, talent, and awareness of his privileged position.[27]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2012 The Hunger Games Marvel The World is Watching: Making the Hunger Games Himself Documentary Just 45 Minutes from Broadway Danny 2013 The Hunger Games: Catching Fire Marvel Cameo 2014 Just Before I Go Dylan 2015 Running Wild Eric Ithaca Marcus Macauley 2016 Aberrant Cole Formerly known as Vineland 2017 Logan Lucky Fish Bang 2017 Tragedy Girls Jordan Welch 2018 Rampage Connor Smallfoot Pilot Voice[28] 2019 Plus One Ben King 2021 Batman: The Long Halloween: Part One Alberto Falcone Voice, direct-to-video[29][30][28] 2022 Scream Richard \"Richie\" Kirsch 2023 Scream VI Uncredited cameo Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Earth-65 Peter Parker / Lizard Voice role Oppenheimer Richard Feynman 2025 Companion † TBA Post-production Novocaine † Nathan Caine Filming TBA Heads of State † TBA Post-production\n\nKey † Denotes films that have not yet been released\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2013 Mrs. Jack Episode: \"The Blind Date\" 2016 Vinyl Clark Morelle 10 episodes\n\nMain role 2017 Workaholics Clark Episode: \"Party Gawds\" The Tap Warren Michaels Episode: \"Pilot\" 2019–present The Boys Hugh \"Hughie\" Campbell 32 episodes, Main role 2019–2020 Harvey Girls Forever!
