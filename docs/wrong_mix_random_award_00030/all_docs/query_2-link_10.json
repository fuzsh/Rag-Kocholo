        "text": "“Mining the deep, dark, difficult things leads to worthwhile discoveries.”\n\nLight Skin Gone to Waste (University of Georgia Press, 2022)\n\nA question from Monic Ductan: Who are your literary heroes?\n\nJames Baldwin, John A. Williams, Toni Morrison, Lorraine Hansberry, August Wilson, Tennessee Williams, Ntozake Shange\n\nWhy?\n\nHansberry and Morrison because of the example they set not only as excellent writers but also Black women intellectuals. They both had brilliant minds and because they existed, I could ignore it when the world I was trying to enter as a young writer suggested that because I was Black and female I wasn’t as smart or capable as my white and male colleagues. Ms. Shange provided monologues for me to learn, feel, and perform as a young actor moving into playwriting. She was witty, eloquent, and rhythmic on the page. August Wilson and Tennessee Williams also wrote rhythmically–poetically. As an actor, if you find the timing and poetry in their plays and say the lines, the rhythms will reveal the way into the characters. It’s music. I enjoyed seeing both their plays performed and reading them aloud myself. I still read their plays for nourishment. When I write monologues in my prose I work to find the rhythm in the characters’ speech. This evolved out of performing Shange’s theatrical poems when I was an acting student, and from studying and listening to Wilson and Williams and others. James Baldwin was the first literary writer whose work I read voraciously. I learned how to write fiction from reading his novels repeatedly. John A. Williams was a contemporary of Baldwin who didn’t become as famous but who I find equally as instructive and brilliant. His writing is stunningly beautiful and also so visual I see the stories in my mind as I read him. And like Baldwin, Hansberry, and Morrison, he was fierce and fearless in the ways he illuminated racial politics.\n\nA question from Monica Macansantos: Do you ever find yourself inspired or guided by your childhood in your work?\n\nYes. Light Skin Gone to Waste is autobiographical fiction based on my childhood experience being born and raised in A white town in Upstate New York where my family was one of the only Black families. It was a mostly working class town, and my father was a highly educated psychologist and psychoanalyst, and we were upper middle class. The experience led to my confusion about race, class, and identity.\n\nI think all artists’ childhoods can provide fodder for their work, because where you come from helps shape who you are, and the work we create is often revealing who we are even if we’re not conscious of that. I didn’t realize it when I began writing, but even when I wasn’t directly writing about me or my family, where I came from—the influence of my upbringing—was constantly revealing itself in what I chose to write about. I have always been examining race and class because I never fit the image the dominant culture said I was supposed to be as a Black woman.\n\nA question from Anna Laura Reeve: Do you understand your role in society—as a writer—to be influential, critical, observant, or something else?\n\nI think it depends on the story or book, but I am typically observant and critical about race relations. I would love to be influential, though I think that’s out of my control. I also see my role as that of an entertainer. I began as an actor, became a playwright, and then a screenwriter before I moved into fiction. Entertaining an audience is essential when you’re a storyteller of any sort, in my opinion. I wouldn’t endeavor to be observant and critical (or influential) without trying to give the reader an emotional experience or one that makes them laugh.\n\nCould you tell us a bit about your growing up and your path to becoming a writer?\n\nI started as an actor. At twelve, I was studying improvisation; at fourteen, I was studying method acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute in New York City. As an actress who didn’t look identifiably Black, I had to think about creating material for myself to act in. I studied playwriting with Arthur Kopit, Judi Ann Mason, Leslie Lee, Charles Fuller and others before I left New York with a play that I brought to Los Angeles hoping to stage and act in. The play was eventually produced by The New York Stage and Film Company but by then I was working as screenwriter. The same play also got me signed to a big Hollywood agent, and a fellowship to the Sundance Screenwriter’s Lab. My first produced screenplay was Ruby Bridges. That was in 1998. In 1999 when the play was produced, I wasn’t offered an audition for the lead in my own play, Gramercy Park is Closed to the Public which I’d written for myself. Nicole Ari Parker played the role. After a few more of my scripts were produced, I was drawn away from that movie world and into fiction because as a screenwriter, my voice was too often lost due to the way movies are developed. I dropped out of the business, earned an MFA in Creative Writing and have since been focused on novels and short stories. My first novel, Remedy For a Broken Angel, was nominated for an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work by a Debut Author, my second book, Homegoing, a novella, won a contest that came with publication, and my third book Light Skin Gone to Waste, won the Flannery O’Connor Award and was nominated for a 2023 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work.\n\nCould you share a representative or pivotal excerpt from your book? Perhaps something that that invites the reader into the world of the book?\n\nWhy did you choose this excerpt?\n\nIt’s the shortest story in the collection and I wanted to share something complete. I think a reader can get a sense that book is about how the speaker’s experience growing up a an only Black child in a white neighborhood affected her life from this story.\n\nWhat’s the oldest story in your book? Or can you name one piece that catalyzed or inspired the rest of the book? What do you remember about writing it?\n\nThe story “Claiming Tobias” is the first story I wrote for the linked collection. I wrote it in 2007. It’s the story about Maddie and her first best friend, a white boy named Tobias. (These are also the characters in “Time Travel,” the excerpt I shared, though they are not named.)\n\nIn the beginning of the story, Tobias doesn’t realize that Maddie is different. She is light skinned and they are under six years old and up to that point, they haven’t discussed race except for him to remark that if he draws her, he uses a tan crayon and he is drawn with a peach crayon. During the story some other kids in the neighborhood single Maddie out and call her the N-word. It’s the first time she hears it and she’s not sure what it means. Unfortunately, Tobias aligns himself with the other kids and rejects Maddie, and this destroys their friendship.\n\nI do remember why I wrote it. There was an incident on the set of Ruby Bridges (which I wrote) wherein the child actor playing Jimmy, who was white, had to say a line that called the child actor playing Ruby, who was Black, the N-word. (This is based on the real Ms. Bridges’ account of what happened to her.) At first he refused to say it because, he said: It was mean. After the director, Euzhan Palcy, finally persuaded him to say it, he cried, hugged the actress and apologized, telling her he didn’t mean it. I was moved by how caring the little boy was about his colleague’s feelings. At around the same age, my friend called me that word and I never received an apology. I realized it still hurt. I didn’t write the story then, but I began thinking about that childhood friendship. I knew I’d write about it at some point.\n\nAbout ten years later, I could not stop thinking about a girl in my childhood neighborhood whose brothers were the bullies that first called me the N-word. They also threw rocks at me. I’d never gotten over the incident. The girl died in childhood, and as she came to mind repeatedly, I felt that she wanted me to forgive her brothers for how they’d treated me. I finally wrote the story and it was what led me to focus on my childhood throughout the collection.\n\nHow did you decide on the arrangement and title of your book?\n\nI always loved the phrase Light Skin Gone to Waste. It’s not something I’d say myself. It’s insulting. But I used it in a story where one character says it to Maddie because she was a light-skinned girl with long hair, which was supposedly desirable. However, she cuts off her long hair in favor of an Afro. Without long, straight hair, Maddie no longer looks almost white (which was her goal). From the POV of the character who hurls the insult Light Skin Gone to Waste at her, she was foolish to ruin her looks by calling attention to the fact that she has Black hair.\n\nThe phrase is the title of that story, and I chose it as the title of the collection as a way to encompass the light skinned family’s experience in the white town. The parents think that they and Maddie are light enough to be accepted in the environment, but the environment does not really accept them. One could argue that the attempt at assimilation does more harm to the family than good and yet there are advantages to the proximity to whiteness.\n\nThe arrangement is mostly chronological from 1962 (when the young Black couple moves to the town) through 1978 when Maddie is a teenager and decides she wants out.\n\nWhich story is the “misfit” in your collection and why?\n\nProbably the one story that takes place in West Africa and seems to have little relationship to the family’s experience in the town where the rest of the book is set. While it is somewhat incongruent, because it’s about the family and something consequential happens there, it does belong in the book. Still, I debated whether or not to include it and then I wrote another story to complement it so that it would better fit into the narrative.\n\nDo you have a favorite prompt or revision strategy? What is it?\n\nI like to look at the motifs that exist naturally in the piece and then explore ways to make them echo throughout. I also like to try to make some relationship between my beginnings and my endings. Usually, the main character should be somewhat different at the end of a story than they are at the beginning and sometimes returning to a place or idea that existed in the opening and finding a way to tweak that place or idea to show the character’s growth or change is satisfying to me.\n\nWhat advice would you offer to students interested in creative writing?\n\nBe prepared to go deeper than you might expect into character exploration. Mining the deep, dark, difficult things leads to worthwhile discoveries. If you let it, your writing shows you what you think and who you are.\n\nWhat question would you like to ask the next author featured at Speaking of Marvels?\n\nI’d like to ask: Why are you writing about what you’re writing about?\n\n*\n\nToni Ann Johnson won 2021 The Flannery O’Connor Award for her linked story collection Light Skin Gone to Waste, which was also nominated for a 2023 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work.
