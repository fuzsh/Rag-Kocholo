(WCBI) – A local Tennessee Williams tribute group is getting ready for a state theatre competition this week.\n\nAnd there was no better way to prepare than to perform three shows for Columbus residents at the Mississippi University for Women, Sunday.\n\nThey performed “Kingdom of Earth,” which was written by Williams.\n\nThe tribute committee will perform this play at the Mississippi Theatre Association competition this Friday in Vicksburg.\n\nMoney raised from Sunday’s performances will help cover traveling expenses to the competition."
