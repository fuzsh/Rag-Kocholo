        "text": "The Glass Menagerie\n\nPresented by The Everyman\n\nWritten by Tennessee Williams\n\nDirected by Emma Jordan\n\n2–26 AUG 2023 – The Everyman, Cork\n\n“Glass breaks so easily. No matter how careful you are.”\n\nThe Everyman was proud to present Tennessee Williams’ classic play, The Glass Menagerie.\n\nAn unremarkable apartment, 1930’s St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nAmanda, a force to be reckoned with despite how she might appear, clings to the romance of her past whilst ardently aspiring to a better future for her children. Her daughter Laura, left fragile by a childhood illness, shies away from the outside world, and dedicates herself to her glass menagerie; whilst her son Tom, a poet and the play’s narrator, longs to escape his warehouse job and the suffocation of his existence.\n\nHope delivered in the arrival of a “gentleman caller” is inevitably shattered, but memories are not so easily demolished.\n\nThe Glass Menagerie propelled Tennessee Williams to fame. Award-winning theatre director Emma Jordan returned to The Everyman stage with that new production following the success of The New Electric Ballroom by Enda Walsh (Gate Theatre) earlier that year.\n\n“…beautifully staged and never less than absorbing.” – Frank McNally, The Irish Times\n\n“Director Emma Jordan gives us a sparse and honest version of Tennessee Williams’ breakout 1944 play” – Irish Independent (Read HERE)\n\n“Mesmerising production of an American classic” – Sunday Independent\n\nCAST\n\nNatalie Radmall-Quirke as Amanda\n\nDarragh Feehely as Tom\n\nChloe O’Reilly as Laura\n\nLórcan Strain as Jim\n\nCREATIVE TEAM\n\nWritten by Tennessee Williams\n\nDirected by Emma Jordan\n\nSet & Lighting Designer Ciarán Bagnall\n\nComposer & Sound Designer Peter Power\n\nCostume Designer Valentina Gambardella\n\nAssistant Director Éadaoin Fox\n\nAssistant Designer Hannah Lane\n\nDownload the programme HERE\n\nPost-Show Talk – TUE 15 AUG\n\nLouise Crowley, a Professor in Family Law at the School of Law, UCC and spear-head of the Bystander Intervention, led a post-show talk on Tuesday 15 August.\n\nLouise Crowley is a solicitor and a first-class honours graduate of University College Cork (BCL 1996; LLM 1997), (MATLHE 2020) and Cardiff University (PhD 2010). She is a Professor in Family Law at the School of Law, UCC. Her research interests include Family Law and the recognition and regulation of multiple family formations, and the breakdown of those relationships, particularly marital breakdown, as well as domestic violence and the adequacy of regulatory responses and capacity for perpetrator programmes to play an effective role in protecting the victims of domestic violence.\n\nAt UCC, Louise has developed the campus-wide Bystander Intervention initiative which seeks to educate and empower staff and students to challenge the normalisation of sexual abuse and to recognise their role as pro-social bystanders to effect change and bring about a new normal of safety and respect."
