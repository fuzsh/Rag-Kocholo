        "text": "Eugene Lamar Long, 37, of Chattanooga Tennessee passed away March 20, 2020 at home of a heart attack. He was born March 18, 1983 in Halifax P.A. and was raised in Lebanon P.A.\n\nHe Leaves behind a wife, Jessica A. Long, and two sons Rymond and Mykal Long. He was the son of Tammy Hakema (Abdul) and the late Edward L. Myers. He also leaves behind two sisters, Ruth Stoneroad from Harrisburg P.A., and Tammy Mendoza (Williams) of Halifax P.A., a brother Kraig Long from Harrisburg P.A. He also has one surviving niece and one nephew that pasted away, Brent Allen Sallada. Eugene served our country for ten years in the United States Army and National Guard as a E4. Out of those ten years he was honored and received the Army Commendation Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, Army Reserve Components Achievement Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Global War On Terrorism Service Medal, Iraq Service Medal with Campaign Star, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon and Armed Forces Reserve Medal. Eugene was the kind of man that took pride in his family and job. He was the kind of man that always tried to make you laugh and smile. His main love was for his family especially his two sons. He had such a big heart and that's what made who he was, a special kind of man that went out of his way to help as much as he could wherever he could. He will forever be in our hearts and memories.\n\n\"Fill not your hearts with pain and sorrow, But, remember me in every tomorrow. Remember the joy, the laughter, the smiles. I've only gone to rest a while. Although my leaving causes pain and grief, my going has eased my hurt and given me relief. So, dry your eyes and remember me, Not as I am, but as I used to be. Because I will remember you all and look on with a smile. Understand in your hearts, I've only gone to rest a little while. As long as I have the love of each of you, I can live my life in the hearts of all of you.‚Äù\n\nThere will be no service due to the virus. The family may decide at a later date if they would like to hold a service."
