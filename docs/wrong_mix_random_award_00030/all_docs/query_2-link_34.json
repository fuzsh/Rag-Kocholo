        "text": "“Home is where you hang your childhood,” said playwright Thomas Lanier “Tennessee” Williams, who was born in Columbus, Miss., and spent his childhood in what he described as “a gloriously idyllic life” with his mother and grandparents in Clarksdale, Miss.\n\nAnd yet, Williams loved the Gulf Coast because he reveled in the atmosphere and the people. Some of his best and most celebrated works are drenched in the humid sensuality of the region.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright described his adopted hometown of New Orleans as “vagabond’s paradise,” and he extended that description all the way down the Gulf Coast to Mobile when he depicted the shore’s occupants in plays such as “The Rose Tattoo” and “Sweet Bird of Youth.”\n\nThose plays will be the subject of a discussion led by Williams’ biographer, Kenneth Holditch, Ph.D., at 5 p.m. March 19 at the Mobile Carnival Museum downtown. (See information box.)\n\nThe event is part of the Southern Literary Trail’s “Trailfest 2011” events in Mobile, which begins March 17 and continues through May 1 in partnership with Mobile Public Library and the Historic Mobile Preservation Society during the annual Historic Homes Tour.\n\nIn addition to Holditch, program presenters for Mobile include New York and Alabama scholars of Albert Murray and Broadway actor Joel Vig (“Hairspray”). Alabama Poet Laureate Sue Walker will present Williams’ unheralded poetry.\n\nPresenters from Mobile include John Hafner, Carolyn Haines and Kern Jackson whose students will read from “Trading Twelves” March 17 at Bernheim Hall in the Ben May Main Library.\n\nHolditch, a scholar and professor emeritus at the University of New Orleans, knew Tennessee Williams (1911-1983) and never tires of studying his plays. He co-edited a two-volume set of Williams’ plays for the Library of America, which will release the works in conjunction with the centennial of Williams’ birth.\n\n“That’s the wonderful thing about great literature,” Holditch says via long distance. “You can always learn something new from it.\n\n\"A lot of writers we read, with one reading that’s enough. And you go back to them and you don’t learn anything. Like Faulkner with ‘Absalom, Absalom!’ My students always complain that they couldn’t understand it. I tell them, ‘Well, I’ve read it seven times and now I do understand it.’”\n\nWith Williams’ plays, “you can learn something new because a lot of it depends on the performance,” he says. “But even just reading you can find new meanings.”\n\n“The Rose Tattoo” and “Sweet Bird of Youth” are very different plays in dramatically dissimilar settings. The former is set in a Sicilian community near Pascagoula; the latter mostly takes place in a hotel room in St. Cloud, Fla.\n\nAnna Magnani, one of Williams’ close friends, earned an Oscar for her performance in the 1955 film version of “The Rose Tattoo,” even though she had a limited command of English, according to Holditch. The playwright wanted her for the lead in the Broadway version, but it was not to be.\n\nGeraldine Page was nominated for an Oscar for her work in “Sweet Bird of Youth,” which co-starred Paul Newman.\n\nThe Gulf Coast is undeniably a major character in both plays, says Holditch, who met Williams in January 1978.\n\n“I had been reading and studying his work for a number of years,” he says. “He and I had a lot of mutual friends, We came so close to meeting over the years but it didn’t happen until 1978. He and his grandfather used to come to Memphis . . . where I did my undergraduate work.\n\n“I was born about 60 miles from where he was born . . . (and) he knew my older cousin. When I got to New Orleans, I would see him on the street, and I would nod and he would nod. We didn’t meet each other and I didn’t want to push myself on him.”\n\nEventually, however, Holditch met and spent some time with Williams when the professor introduced the famous playwright to an enormous audience during a rare public appearance. They later had dinner and talked about Southern literature and the price of property in New Orleans.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, Williams didn’t spend his life saying and writing negative things about his native Mississippi. He once wrote to his grandfather: “I need to go back to Mississippi, where most of my material comes from. I need to store up more memories and more energy from there.”\n\n“It’s quite remarkable that he had that love and devotion,” Holditch says.\n\nThe playwright was never comfortable talking about his own work.\n\n“I gave him an article I had written about him,” says Holditch. “He didn’t like academics very much because they always wanted talk about his work, and he didn’t want to discuss it. And of course he felt the work really didn’t fully exist until it was on the stage.\n\n“He said on more than one occasion that people told him, ‘Oh, I’d much rather read your work than see it performed.’ And he said, ‘That’s wrong, because until you see it performed, it doesn’t exist.’”\n\nHolditch’s connections to Williams go well beyond his biography of the playwright. He still requests and gets Williams’ favorite table at Galatoire’s, one of New Orleans’ most celebrated restaurants. The professor says: “He could see the whole room and see what’s going on.”\n\nHere are a few other “Trailfest” highlights at a glance:\n\nMarch 14: The Classics Revisited Book Group will discuss Truman Capote’s society novella “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” at 6:30 p.m. at the Ben May Main Library.
