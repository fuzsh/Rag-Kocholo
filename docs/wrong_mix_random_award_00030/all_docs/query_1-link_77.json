        "meta_description": "The Tennessee Williams Project- Chopin Theatre- The Tennessee Williams Project directed by Matt Hawkins (Jeff Award winner for Best Director and Musical for The Hypocrites' Cabaret, 2010) is an evening of one-act plays written by Tennessee Williams. Titles include The Big Game, And Tell Sad Stories of the Deaths of Queens and The Remarkable Rooming House of Mme Le Monde. These rarely produced plays are about the aching need for love and connection and the isolation and loneliness that come from rejection. They contain many of the familiar themes explored in his well-known plays, but they reveal a side of the author that many may have never seen before.",

        "text": "Chicago Tribune - Somewhat Recommended\n\n\"...Certainly Williams' playwriting output in the 1940s and '50s was up there with the best of them, though the same could be said of his drug and alcohol consumption. It is from those decades in between that the Hypocrites and director Matt Hawkins have pulled from obscurity three short plays.\"\n\nRead Full Review\n\n- Nina Metz\n\nChicago Sun Times - Highly Recommended\n\n\"...The Hypocrites' production also thrives on a hugely imaginative, intensely physical collaboration between director Matt Hawkins (who starred as Stanley Kowalski in David Cromer's memorable revival of \"Streetcar\" at Writers Theatre in 2010), his ingenious design team (sets by San Stratton, lights by William Kirkham, costumes by Alison Siple and sound by Heath Hays), and his cast of six. And the company's performance space - the wildly eclectic basement of the Chopin Theatre - could not be more ideally suited to this project.\"\n\nRead Full Review\n\n- Hedy Weiss\n\nChicago Reader - Somewhat Recommended\n\n\"...The iconic characters and bitter poetry can't make up for the play's stalled dramatic engine. The other two, The Remarkable Rooming-House of Mme Le Monde and The Big Game, are impenetrable and precious, respectively. Hawkins has a strong cast, but he too often pushes them to breathless extremes, giving much of the nearly two-hour evening a wearying sameness. Typical of Hypocrites productions, the design elements are clever and evocative.\"\n\nRead Full Review\n\n- Justin Hayford\n\nTime Out Chicago - Recommended\n\n\"...The slate of one-acts Hawkins put together feels quite telling of Williams's career-long obsessions. It also seems like a glimpse into his unrulier side: Where the playwright's major works are dotted with semi-coded references to homosexuality (i.e. the neverending debate about just how close Cat on a Hot Tin Roof's Brick was to poor dead Skipper), And Tell Sad Stories is remarkably blatant for the time it's thought to have been written, the late 1950s.\"\n\nRead Full Review\n\n- Kris Vire\n\nThe Fourth Walsh - Highly Recommended\n\n\"...The terrific ensemble, Patrick Gannon, Osiris Khepera, Eric Leonard, Christopher Meister, Mary Redmon, Joseph Wiens, morph into multiple roles for this Tennessee Williams showcase. A masterful Hawkins facilitates impressive distinctions from his actors from play to play. A noteworthy Patrick Gannon goes from mentally crippled to physically crippled. Gannon effectively morphs from an aging drag queen to a paraplegic with incredible upper arm strength. Mary Redmon goes hilariously from lewd landlady to prim nurse. Although Joseph Weins performances from play to play are great, his ongoing transformations within Sad Stories is unforgettable. His emotional turmoil is an unexpected rollercoaster ride. At one point, he even serenades poignantly. Its heartbreakingly beautiful.\"\n\n- Katy Walsh"
