Williams, considered the most important American playwright, was born in Columbus, Mississippi in 1911. He spent his beginning years in an old Victorian home that was the rectory for St. Paulâ€™s Episcopal Church, where his grandfather served as minister. The home was recently honored with the designation of a National Literary Landmark, and it now serves as the official Welcome Center for Columbus."
