        "text": "(1911–83). The dramas of Tennessee Williams are some of the most moving and powerful ever written for the American stage. His Southern settings and characters depict a world of human frustration in which sex and violence underlie an atmosphere of superficial, faded gentility.\n\nHe was born Thomas Lanier Williams on March 26, 1911, in Columbus, Mississippi. He attended the University of Missouri from 1931 to 1933 and Washington University in St. Louis (1936–37), where he became interested in writing. Williams worked at it during the Great Depression while employed in a shoe factory. He studied dramatic writing at the University of Iowa, from which he graduated in 1938. Afterward he traveled around the country, working at insignificant jobs and writing short plays that were often produced at community theaters. He won some recognition for American Blues (1939), a group of one-act plays.\n\nWilliams continued doing odd jobs, however, until his first real success in 1944: The Glass Menagerie, a play about a decadent Southern family living under great emotional tension in a city tenement. The play won the New York Drama Critic’s Circle award, as did three more of his plays. His next major play was A Streetcar Named Desire (1947), a study of the mental and moral ruin of a former Southern belle, Blanche Du Bois. Her genteel pretensions are no match for her brutish brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski. This success was followed by Camino Real (1953), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1955), Suddenly Last Summer (1958), Sweet Bird of Youth (1959), and Night of the Iguana (1961). A Streetcar Named Desire and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof were both awarded Pulitzer prizes. In addition to long theater runs, all of these plays were filmed. His novel The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone (1950) also became a motion picture.\n\nWilliams’s later writing was compromised by health problems, addiction to alcohol and sleeping pills, and a nervous breakdown. His last plays were not well received. He died in New York City on February 25, 1983."
