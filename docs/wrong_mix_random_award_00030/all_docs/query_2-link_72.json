        "text": "Good Friday morning Memphis, where the Tigers are a step closer to having a ticket to March Madness and the weekend is starting with another sun-kissed weather day. Enjoy it before the rain arrives Sunday.\n\nBut, first, we're introducing an interim state senator from District 33 and it's a familiar name.\n\nAfter multiple rounds of voting and several stalemates that dragged on into Thursday night, State. Rep. London Lamar, D-Memphis, was selected as interim senator filling the Tennessee State Senate District 33 seat formerly held by the ousted Katrina Robinson, our Katherine Burgess reports.\n\nLamar will serve until the Nov. 8, 2022 election.\n\nSpeaking to commissioners Thursday, Lamar stressed that her current district in the Tennessee House overlaps with Senate District 33.\n\n“My passion for public service goes beyond relationships, merit and experience,\" Lamar said. \"I have consistently gone above and beyond of what is required of my district.”\n\nDistrict 33 “is in my blood,\" she said.\n\nGov. Lee, Speaker Cameron Sexton offer Memphis differing visions on fighting crime\n\nTwo of the most powerful people in Tennessee came to Memphis Thursday and used a pair of news conferences to offer different visions on fighting the violent crime that plagues the city, our Sam Hardiman reports.\n\nOne, House Speaker Cameron Sexton, offered the stick to violent criminals. He stood next to Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland and touted a bill that would lengthen prison sentences for 14 violent felonies and goes by the 1990s catch phrase truth-in-sentencing.\n\nThe other, Gov. Bill Lee, is offering Memphis a financial carrot — a proposed 20 new Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers on Memphis interstates as well as funding for police recruitment and violence intervention programs.\n\nLee does not appear to be a fan of the truth-in-sentencing legislation. He did not say whether he would sign the bill Thursday and said there would be further dialogue on the it before its passage.\n\nOakland prepares for Ford's Blue Oval City\n\nOakland Public Works Director Harvey Ellis remembers what the Fayette County town was like when he began working there 23 years ago.\n\nThere were only a few hundred or so people living there when Ellis arrived. Oakland did not appear on the brink of the population boom that solidified its status as a fast-growing town over the next two-plus decades, our Omer Yusuf reports in this story for subscribers.\n\nNow it’s a town with a population of nearly 9,000, after undergoing multiple waves of growth, and is seemingly growing by the day. Oakland typically averages 300 new home builds a year, Ellis said. That’s about the size of the population when he first started his role as public works director.\n\n“Oakland has been a pretty steady growth pattern, so most of our residents are new, if you will,” Ellis said. “I think the old core of people is shrinking.”\n\nMakeda's won't reopen its Airways Blvd. store\n\nNearly four months after Memphis rapper Young Dolph was shot and killed there, Makeda's Homemade Butter Cookies announced it will not reopen its original Airways Boulevard location, our Dima Amro reports.\n\nMakeda's owner Pamela Hill said the decision came Wednesday, shortly after the building owner announced the coming down of the memorial wall dedicated to Young Dolph, whose legal name is Adolph Thornton Jr.\n\n\"We had so much negative response to this man saying he's going to remove the memorial and allow us to reopen,\" Hill said. \"We had decided it wasn't worth us risking our lives, our employees' lives.\"\n\nMemphis unveils sewer expansion plans\n\nThe city of Memphis told local officials Thursday that its efforts to ease the burden on its strained sewer system will definitely include myriad tanks to store sewage so it can be off-loaded during the middle of the night, our Samuel Hardiman reports.\n\nThis practice is already in place for private developments in northeast Memphis and Bartlett. It has been known for some time that Memphis would have to build the tanks but Thursday's news amounted to detailed specifics, a timeline for when the city would build the first two tanks and the overall cost.\n\n\"The flow has to stay in that pipe. That's the critical thing,\" Memphis Public Works Director Robert Knecht said Thursday. The tanks are needed to help withstand heavy rainstorms, which bring rainwater into sewer pipes and cause sanitary sewer overflows.\n\nMemphis' first black football player recalls the experience\n\nWalk into Glenn Rogers Sr.’s game room and the blue wall stands out. So do the dozens of plaques from his coaching career and other honors from working in education.\n\nBeneath his Memphis State diploma, one plaque reminds of his football playing career. It’s a framed picture of Rogers from his senior season with the Tigers that mentions he was a hard hitter who contributed at safety and special teams, our Evan Barnes reports.\n\nWhat’s missing is the history associated with it. Rogers was the first Black player to integrate the football team by walking on in the spring of 1968. A year later, he and Stan Davis became the first Black players to appear in a game for the Tigers.\n\nTigers beat UCF, setting up finale Sunday against Houston\n\nIt wasn't completely devoid of anxious moments.\n\nBut Memphis basketball overcame a shaky outing, handling its business late Thursday to sack South Florida 73-64 at the Yeungling Center, its ninth win in the last 10 games. Jalen Duren powered the Tigers (18-9, 12-5 AAC) again, notching a game-high 16 points against the Bulls (8-21, 3-14), the 10th game in a row he's hit double figures. His 10 rebounds gave him his sixth double-double of the season, our Jason Munz reports.\n\nPenny Hardaway and Co. can officially turn their attention toward Sunday's meeting with No. 14 Houston.\n\nTigers reverse course, will honor Alex Lomax on Senior Day\n\nThe final home game of the regular season is traditionally referred to as senior day.\n\nAnd that goes for all college sports. It's a time when programs carve out time, usually before or after gameday activities for the home finale, to honor those players who have exhausted their eligibility. Division I rules stipulate athletes have five years to play four seasons. Team managers, cheerleaders and band members are also typically included, Jason reports.\n\nInitially, the Memphis basketball team planned to forego recognizing any of its three seniors – Alex Lomax, Tyler Harris or DeAndre Williams – when it hosts No. 14 Houston Sunday (11 a.m., CBS). But coach Penny Hardaway said Thursday the program will, in fact, honor Lomax on senior day.\n\nMark Russell is executive editor of The Commercial Appeal.
