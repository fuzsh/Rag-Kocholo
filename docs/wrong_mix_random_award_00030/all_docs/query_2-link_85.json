Yeah, I know it’s been some time since I’ve posted a written blog, but you know draft season brings me out of hibernation. Been going through it tbh since FSU got robbed out of the playoff. BUT I DIGRESS! Obviously, it’s whatever though because CFB is over and so is theContinueContinue reading “Dre’s 2024 NFL Mock Draft 1.0”\n\nQuarterback Carousel\n\nOh, the offseason. I know football is technically still going on but when your heart out of the running NFL Playoffs just become an excuse to give up on your new years resolutions. This offseason has the potential to possibly rival last in terms of sheer movement with some big names looking to change cities.ContinueContinue reading “Quarterback Carousel”\n\nDre Predictions: NFL 2022-2023 Szn\n\nOhhhh how we missed you!! It always feels so long waiting for the kickoff of the NFL season but we finally made it! The Bills and the Rams kicked us off last night with an ass beating of the Rams, but it’ll be all too glorious when Scott Hanson officially utters the sentence: “7 hoursContinueContinue reading “Dre Predictions: NFL 2022-2023 Szn”\n\nWeek 5 Review/Week 6 Preview\n\nIt’s the part of the season where contenders are separated from pretenders. With 5 weeks down, we’re getting into the bye weeks where fantasy leagues are won and lost. I do these blogs to fully ensure a player isn’t dropped from my UNDEFEATED TFTB Squad. Sorry Steph but just know I still love the wheelContinueContinue reading “Week 5 Review/Week 6 Preview”\n\nWeek 2 Review/Week 3 Preview\n\nI still have not come up with a good title for these weekly pieces. I promise to be better in that department and will also take on any ideas you may have for a title. I feel that it’s worth mentioning that you can find my last week’s review/preview here. It’s also worth mentioning thatContinueContinue reading “Week 2 Review/Week 3 Preview”\n\nWeek 1 in Review/Week 2 Preview\n\nDeke is a mad man! Content is coming every week so I don’t get players cut from my TFTB Fantasy team! Calvin Ridley and DeAndre Hopkins (Editors Note – Hopkins stayed, but Dre performed his content duties before the announcement) are officially on the waiver wire in this league because Smalls and Elsass/Chip did notContinueContinue reading “Week 1 in Review/Week 2 Preview”\n\nWhat really happened to lamar last night?\n\nIf you went to bed at a normal hour and don’t hate yourself this wonderful Tuesday morning, you may have missed one of the best NFL games in recent memory. Nothing screams prime time football like the AFC North* in December led by two of the more electric sometimes godly sometimes pretend quarterbacks in theContinueContinue reading “What really happened to lamar last night?”\n\nThe Apologies Series: Sorry Benny Buckets\n\nLast week, I had the pleasure of embarrassing Vo in our first week of the Thoughts From The Bench Fantasy Football League, and before it even happened, I knew I had to apologize because it was just the right thing to do. The last thing I wanted him to do was to quit the leagueContinueContinue reading “The Apologies Series: Sorry Benny Buckets”\n\nQuarterback Bracket Challenge Finals\n\nIt’s finally here guys. The moment you have been waiting for. The finals of the Quarterback Bracket Challenge are here. I kind of expected these two to be the last ones, but seeing where the other ones ended up on the way here has always fascinated me. Whenever the result gets posted maybe I’ll doContinueContinue reading “Quarterback Bracket Challenge Finals”"
