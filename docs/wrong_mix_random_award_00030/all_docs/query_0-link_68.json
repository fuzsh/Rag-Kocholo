        "text": "• Lamar Jackson leads the way at quarterback: Jackson is a near lock to win his second MVP award. He ended the 2023 regular season with a 90.3 PFF overall grade and an 85.1 PFF passing grade, both career highs.\n\n• Myles Garrett and Micah Parsons top the best position in football: They led the way in PFF pass-rushing grade and pass-rush win rate among edge defenders.\n\n• Looking for more grades and data? To access PFF Premium Stats, subscribe now!\n\nEstimated Reading Time: 7 minutes\n\nIt's time to look back on a 2023 NFL regular season that produced elite efforts worthy of All-Pro consideration.\n\nPFF's 2023 All-Pro team is selected, in part, based on the data and grades collected after thousands of hours of work by our data collection team.\n\nNote: This team is not just PFF's highest-graded players at each position. Consideration has been given to role, supporting cast and consistency, among other factors.\n\nQB: Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens\n\nSecond Team: Josh Allen, Buffalo Bills\n\nThe three highest-graded quarterbacks from the regular season are separated by just one point on the 0-100 scale, so any of them could be the pick here. However, Jackson is a near lock to win his second MVP award, not just because of his own performance but also the stress he puts on opposing defenses with his rushing ability. He ended the 2023 regular season with a 90.3 PFF overall grade and an 85.1 PFF passing grade, both career highs.\n\nRB: Christian McCaffrey, San Francisco 49ers\n\nSecond Team: Kyren Williams, Los Angeles Rams\n\nMcCaffrey did it all this season, averaging 5.4 yards per carry on 272 rushing attempts and producing 3.42 yards after contact per attempt. His 60 missed tackles forced on rushes tied for the second most in the league, while his 87.1 PFF receiving grade ranked second at the position. He is a true three-down running back, and an elite one at that.\n\nFB: Michael Burton, Denver Broncos\n\nSecond Team: Hunter Luepke, Dallas Cowboys\n\nThere aren't many true fullbacks in today’s NFL, but of the 15 players to record at least 50 snaps lined up as a fullback this season, Burton led the way in PFF run-blocking grade (67.2).\n\nWR: Tyreek Hill, Miami Dolphins; CeeDee Lamb, Dallas Cowboys; Brandon Aiyuk, San Francisco 49ers\n\nSecond Team: Amon-Ra St. Brown, Detroit Lions; A.J. Brown, Philadelphia Eagles; DJ Moore, Chicago Bears\n\nHill not only led the league in receiving yards, but he was also the highest-graded wide receiver (94.0 PFF receiving grade). Lamb was only 50 yards behind him and ranked third in PFF receiving grade, dropping just 3.6% of the passes thrown his way this season. Aiyuk lacked the volume of other highly esteemed receivers this season, ranking 31st in targets, but his 3.01 yards per route run average was the third highest at the position.\n\nTE: George Kittle, San Francisco 49ers\n\nSecond Team: T.J. Hockenson, Minnesota Vikings\n\nKittle would have earned this spot had we considered only receiving ability, finishing the 2023 regular season as the tight end leader in yards, yards per catch, yards per route run and PFF receiving grade. And for good measure, he also paced the position with a 79.0 PFF run-blocking grade.\n\nLT: Trent Williams, San Francisco 49ers\n\nSecond Team: Jordan Mailata, Philadelphia Eagles\n\nWilliams missed two games this season but still proved to be the best left tackle in football. From 438 pass-blocking snaps, he allowed just 18 quarterback pressures, including no sacks. His 89.9 PFF run-blocking grade ranked third among all offensive tackles and first among his peers on the left side.\n\nLG: Joe Thuney, Kansas City Chiefs\n\nSecond Team: Tyler Smith, Dallas Cowboys\n\nWhile he didn't dominate as a run blocker in 2023, Thuney offset that with his work as a pass blocker. His 83.4 PFF pass-blocking grade was the best among all guards after he let up 33 quarterback pressures from 740 pass-blocking snaps.\n\nC: Frank Ragnow, Detroit Lions\n\nSecond Team: Jason Kelce, Philadelphia Eagles\n\nRagnow surrendered 18 quarterback pressures across 576 pass-blocking snaps during the 2023 regular season to rank fifth among centers in PFF pass-blocking grade (73.9). He also excelled as a run blocker, finishing as one of three centers to earn a 90.0-plus PFF run-blocking grade.\n\nRG: Chris Lindstrom, Atlanta Falcons\n\nSecond Team: Kevin Dotson, Los Angeles Rams\n\nThe 2023 campaign didn't quite live up to his 2022 season, but Lindstrom still made a strong case for being the best guard in football for the second straight year. His 78.6 PFF pass-blocking grade ranked sixth at the position, while his 87.6 PFF run-blocking grade placed third.\n\nRT: Penei Sewell, Detroit Lions\n\nSecond Team: Lane Johnson, Philadelphia Eagles\n\nSewell has gone from strength to strength since entering the league in 2021, and his third NFL season was his best yet. His 90.7 PFF grade ranked first among all offensive tackles, with the former Oregon Duck also leading the way with a 93.1 PFF run-blocking grade. He allowed just 20 quarterback pressures from 674 pass-blocking snaps.\n\nEDGE: Myles Garrett, Cleveland Browns; Micah Parsons, Dallas Cowboys\n\nSecond Team: Nick Bosa, San Francisco 49ers; Maxx Crosby, Las Vegas Raiders\n\nEdge defender is the most difficult position to decipher, with elite pass rushers such as T.J. Watt, Trey Hendrickson and Aidan Hutchinson missing out. The position's highest PFF pass-rushing grades belong to Myles Garrett (94.8) and Micah Parsons (93.7). Garrett and Parsons also led the way in pass-rush win rate, with Garrett winning 28.1% of his reps this season and Parsons at 24.2%.\n\nDI: Dexter Lawrence, New York Giants; Aaron Donald, Los Angeles Rams\n\nSecond Team: Quinnen Williams, New York Jets; Derrick Brown, Carolina Panthers\n\nDonald earns a first-team spot after another dominant season as a pass rusher, leading the position in quarterback pressures (84) and pass-rush win rate (22.3%). Lawrence was the best interior defender in football this season, though, ranking first with a 92.6 PFF pass-rushing grade and third with an 89.5 PFF run-defense grade.\n\nLB: Fred Warner, San Francisco 49ers; Demario Davis, New Orleans Saints\n\nSecond Team: Roquan Smith, Baltimore Ravens; C.J. Mosley, New York Jets\n\nWarner was the NFL's highest-graded linebacker during the 2023 regular season, with his ability to impact the passing game highlighted by three sacks as a blitzer and four interceptions in coverage. Davis quietly had an incredible season himself, giving up just 6.6 yards per reception when he was the primary coverage defender and ranking behind only Warner in PFF grade (89.6).\n\nCB: Jaylon Johnson, Chicago Bears; DaRon Bland, Dallas Cowboys; Sauce Gardner, New York Jets\n\nSecond Team: Devon Witherspoon, Seattle Seahawks; Kendall Fuller, Washington Commanders; Trent McDuffie, Kansas City Chiefs\n\nJohnson, Bland and Gardner were the only three cornerbacks to play 400 or more snaps and earn 89.0-plus PFF coverage grades. Gardner didn’t have the best start to his season but wound up surpassing his impressive rookie campaign with a 90.8 PFF coverage grade. Johnson allowed just 195 yards on plays where he was the primary coverage defender, the lowest of any cornerback to play at least 250 coverage snaps in coverage. Bland paced the league with nine interceptions and set an NFL record for the most pick-sixes in a season.\n\nS: Antoine Winfield Jr., Tampa Bay Buccaneers; Jessie Bates III, Atlanta Falcons\n\nSecond Team: Jevon Holland, Miami Dolphins; Kyle Hamilton, Baltimore Ravens\n\nWinfield's 92.5 PFF run-defense grade led all safeties, and he racked up six sacks while ranking seventh at the position with an 85.3 PFF coverage grade. Bates tied for the position lead in combined pass breakups and interceptions (10), and he ranked second with a 90.2 PFF coverage grade. He was underrated as a run defender, placing third among safeties with an 89.8 PFF run-defense grade.\n\nK: Chase McLaughlin, Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nSecond Team: Jake Elliott, Philadelphia Eagles\n\nP: Bradley Pinion, Atlanta Falcons\n\nSecond Team: Bryan Anger, Dallas Cowboys\n\nKR/PR: KaVontae Turpin, Dallas Cowboys\n\nSecond Team: Ihmir Smith-Marsette, Carolina Panthers\n\nLS: Ross Matiscik, Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nSecond Team: Mitchell Fraboni, Denver Broncos\n\nST: Matthew Adams, Cleveland Browns"
