        "text": "Available On-Demand JAN 8-10\n\nThis refreshing new take on Tennessee Williams’ The Glass Menagerie is told through the lens of a Chinese American family. Set in St. Louis in 1937, Tom Wingfield, an aspiring poet recalls the memories of his mother and sister. Tom’s father ran off years ago and, except for one postcard, has not been heard from since…until now. This audio drama will include images of the final set and costumes designed by M.F.A. students that were captured in the fall. The Glass Menagerie is directed by MFA directing student Alvin Chan.\n\nTicket Information\n\nAll our winter offerings offer single tickets for $10 (general public) and $5 (full-time, non-NU students) with the exception of Tomas and the Library Lady ($20 for adult plus child).
