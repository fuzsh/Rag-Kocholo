        "text": "Preston “Big Al” Redding was born to the late William Herbert and Charlotte Marie Wood Redding on July 14, 1952. He had two brothers (Douglas Cosby of Miami, Fl., and Henry Herbert of Atlanta - both deceased) and one sister, Gwendolyn, who was 20 years older than he. Big Al was greeted by the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ to be fitted for his angel wings on July 3, 2024 at just 71 years young.\n\nHe was a native of Chattanooga, and a graduate of Riverside High School, Class of 1970 and attended Cleveland State Community College. He later met and married Jeanine Faye\n\nMcDaniel on July 26, 1980, as they were the first couple to marry at Miller Park in downtown Chattanooga. He was a long-time member of Stanley United Methodist Church and later moved his membership and became an active member at Rock Island Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nBig Al was a lover of all things transportation whether it be train, tractor trailer, bus or boat, he had to be a part of it all. In 1973, he was employed at Norfolk Southern Railway as a Yard Clerk for 27 years at the tender age of 21. While still employed at Norfolk Southern, he and long-time friend Elroy Bailey began pressure washing tractors, commercial buildings and homes as a small business. A short time later, he and his wife Jeanine then became the owners and operators of Tennessee Valley Charter and Tours which remained in business for 22 years. He later began employment with Kandy Kastle transportation which opened a lot of doors for him to get back to his love for driving. Shortly after leaving Kandy Kastle, he became employed with Millenium Transportation where he would shuttle passengers from the Chattanooga Airport to the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International airport in Atlanta, GA for Delta Airlines. Once that contract ended, he began driving for Blood Assurance where he would pick up samples and organs from hospitals and labs. Once Blood Assurance dissolved the transportation department, he came onboard as a railroad crew hauler for Professional Transportation Incorporated (PTI) where he was known to many as “100”.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, William Herbert and Charlotte Marie Wood Redding; brothers, Douglas Cosby and Henry Herbert; son, James Pittman.\n\nHe leaves to cherish his memories, his wife and absolute love of his life, Jeanine F. Redding of 45 years, Chattanooga; daughters, LaShondra Redding-Mills (Jeremy) of Chattanooga, ReNesha Redding of Pell City, Al., Janis Redding, Erica Pittman, Anita Burgess, Regina Corbin and Yolanda White, all of Chattanooga; one sister, Gwendolyn Walton of Chattanooga; nieces, Cheryl Brown, Shonda Taylor of New Jersey, LaRhonda Hobson of Buford, Ga., and Kenyada Williams of Chattanooga; nephew, Cornelius Redding of Atlanta; a host of nieces, nephews, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nHe also leaves his memories to his long-time friends who became family: James (Duke) and Jeff Sears, Belinda (Pinky) Sears Smith, Pam Taylor, Elroy Bailey, Cecil Hanner, James Steele, Jesse Bragg, James Hines, Clifford Bryant and the Looney family of Ragland, Al."
