        "text": "“…an opportunity to be awakened from passivity and indifference”\n\nFox and Hound Theatre presents a rare opportunity to see three of Williams’ lesser known short plays:\n\nPlay 1: Ivan’s Widow\n\nAttempting to cope with her husband’s death, a widow seeks answers from her psychiatrist- a cold, predatory and promiscuous man with a seemingly genuine concern for his patient. The widow struggles to differentiate between fantasy and reality but who’s truth is real?\n\nPlay 2: Talk to Me Like the Rain and Let Me Listen\n\nA couple find themselves in a cycle of deprivation. The scene between them is one of eternal repetition, where emotions are worn out and the hopelessly unalterable is accepted.\n\nPlay 3: 27 Wagons Full of Cotton\n\nIn desperate times, the rules are different. Do two wrongs make a right? A dysfunctional relationship is at the centre of this disturbing look at abuse and how one woman may find her silver lining.\n\nCREATIVE TEAM\n\nProducer: Helen Fox\n\nDirector: Ellie Jay Stevens\n\nDesigner: Fiona McKeon\n\nCast: Codge Crawford, Helen Fox & Massimiliano Acerbi\n\nTo gain access to priority booking and many other perks, become a member from just £4 per month.
