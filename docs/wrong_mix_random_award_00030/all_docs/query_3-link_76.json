He is the author of three collections of poetry including, Androgyne, Mon Amour (New Directions Publishing, 1977).\n\nWilliams is best known as one of the most influential American playwrights of the 20th century. He received the Pulitzer Prize in Drama in 1948 for his play “A Streetcar Named Desire” and in 1955 for “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.” His more than twenty other full-length plays include “The Glass Menagerie” and “The Night of the Iguana.”\n\nHilton Als, writing in the New Yorker, said of Williams, “His work spoke to those who could not fit within the parameters of all those neat lawns and white picket fences and solid heterosexual values.”\n\nWilliams died on February 25, 1983, in New York City.\n\nPoetry"
