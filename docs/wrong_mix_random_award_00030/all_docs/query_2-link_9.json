The speech was given in opposition to SB 1325 during the floor debate, a bill that passed along party lines by the TN Senate GOP with a vote of 26 to 5 in the Tennessee State Senate on Monday to allow K-12 teachers and school staff to carry concealed handguns on school grounds. \nLamar passionately spoke, with baby Nylinn in her arms the following words on the State Senate floor after the gallery was cleared, “Guys! This is irresponsible! The public school teachers don’t even want the bill! They’re not even asking you for this! We just passed legislation to have SROs in every school, can we see if that works yet? I’m upset, not out of that I don’t like you all individually, but because I’m mad because this bill puts MY child at risk and all the mothers out here that just got put out! They’re saying their children are at risk. Look at that gallery. They are asking you not to do this! Put partisan politics aside, I ask you this all the time but this bill is dangerous! Don’t do it. Teachers don’t want it. The school districts don’t want it. Nobody doesn’t want it. It’s not going to work. It’s going to cause more school shootings. I ask that we legislate with common sense. What happened today is a gallery full of mothers who are concerned and we put them out because you are trying to put guns in teachers hands. We oughta be ashamed, Mr. Speaker.” \n\n@londonlamartn and baby boy Nylinn in elevator at the Tennessee State Capitol in Nashville. 4/9/24. 3:07pm. \n\nLeica M10-R + Summilux 35mm f/1.4 asph fle lens\".",
