        "text": "When a young Laura Dern told her mother, Diane Ladd, she wanted to act, Ladd had a few choice words of advice: “Don’t do it! Be a lawyer, a writer, anything else!” Happily, Dern — whose dad, Bruce, was Ladd’s first husband — didn’t listen, and Ladd eventually found herself with a “phenomenal” co-star: Both mother and daughter were nominated for Academy Awards for 1991’s “Rambling Rose” and more recently teamed for HBO’s “Enlightened.” Now Ladd has a new series: “Chesapeake Shores,” debuting on the Hallmark Channel Aug. 14. A relative of Tennessee Williams and poet Sidney Lanier, the Mississippi native is also a writer and director whose ’“Mrs. Munck” in ’95 starred her ex, Bruce Dern.\n\nHere’s what’s in her library.\n\nA Stone, A Leaf, a Door by Thomas Wolfe\n\nWolfe is a great novelist, of course, but he’s also one of my favorite poets of all time. The poems in this collection are knockouts! You can just breathe in the man’s love and understanding and compassion, and you know you’re fixing to get some humdinger insights. One of my favorites starts: “Pity is a learned emotion/a child will have it least of all.”\n\nSecret Places of the Lion by George Hunt Williamson\n\nThis is a spiritual, metaphysical, powerful book that came to me through my angels. Williamson believes in reincarnation. On the cover is a sphinx, a symbol of mysteries, and it starts with a quote from psalms in the Bible: “like as a lion that is greedy of his prey.” I found it very interesting reading.\n\nMister Paradise and Other One-Act Plays by Tennessee Williams\n\nTennessee was a third cousin of mine. His real name was Tom. I once said, “Tom, you have a great brain,” and he said, “Diane, I don’t write with my brain!” He wrote with his soul. One of my favorite plays here is “The Fat Man’s Wife.” I’d love for Laura [Dern] and I to do “The Glass Menagerie” one day. That was Tom’s favorite play.\n\nThe Collected Stories by Eudora Welty\n\nThey say the greatest writers have come from my state, Mississippi. Welty did, and the stories here are thrilling. She inspired me to write . . . One of the stories here is called “Bitches and Other Sad Stories,” and I’ve always wanted to turn it into a movie."
