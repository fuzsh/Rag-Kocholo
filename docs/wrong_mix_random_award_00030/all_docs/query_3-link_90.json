        "text": "The Soft City\n\nBy Tennessee Williams\n\nI\n\nEastward the city with scarcely even a murmur\n\nturns in the soft dusk,\n\nthe lights of it blur,\n\nthe delicate spires are unequal\n\nas though the emollient dusk had begun to dissolve them...\n\nAnd the soft air-breathers,\n\ntheir soft bosoms rising and falling as ferns under water\n\nresponding to some impalpably soft pressure,\n\nturn with the city, too.\n\nThe petals of tenderness in them,\n\ntheir tentative ways of feeling, not quite reaching out\n\nbut ever so gently half reaching out and withdrawing,\n\nwithdrawing to where their feminine star is withdrawing,\n\nthe planet that turns with them,\n\nfaithfully always and softly...\n\nII\n\nAnd if there is something which is not soft in the city,\n\nsuch as a cry too hard for the soft mouth to hold,\n\nGod puts a soft stop to it.\n\nBending invisibly down, He breathes a narcosis\n\nover the panicky face upturned to entreat Him:\n\na word as soft as morphine is the word that God uses,\n\nplacing His soft hand over the mouth of the cryer\n\nbefore it has time to gather the force of a cry.\n\nIt is almost as if no cry had ever been thought of...\n\nAnd, yes, over all,\n\nsoft canopy over soft canopy,\n\nweb over soft, soft web,\n\ngauze hung over gauze,\n\nthe mysteries of the tall heaven,\n\nthe tall and very soft heaven,\n\nare softest of all!\n\n\"The Soft City\" by Tennessee Williams, from The Collected Poems of Tennessee Williams, copyright Â© 1937, 1956, 1964, 2002 by The University of the South.
