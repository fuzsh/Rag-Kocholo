        "text": "Dolly Parton estimates that she has written close to 3,000 songs throughout her illustrious seven-decade career. While 450 of those songs have been recorded, Parton hasn't always been the artist to sing them: Merle Haggard, Hank Williams Jr. and Kenny Rogers have famously recorded and released tracks written by the 10-time GRAMMY winner.\n\n\"I love to write songs for men,\" Parton says in her 2020 book, Dolly Parton, Songteller: My Life in Lyrics. \"And it's a good thing I do because back then, there weren't that many women in the country-music business to write songs for. Especially ones who weren't writing their own songs, like Loretta Lynn was. I didn't have a lot of space to write songs for women so I purposefully tried to write songs that men could record. Or songs that could go either way.\"\n\nThat's not to say women haven't been a part of Parton's canon. She penned songs that have been recorded by Emmylou Harris and Skeeter Davis, and even gave Whitney Houston one of the biggest songs of her career.\n\nParton's songs have taken on new life thanks to artists across countless genres. In celebration of the Country Music Hall of Famer's 76th birthday on Jan. 19, GRAMMY.com takes a look back at 10 songs you may not have known Dolly Parton wrote.\n\n\"Put It Off Until Tomorrow,\" Bill Phillips\n\nBefore Parton became a household name for her own music, she was a songwriter for other artists. In January 1966, Bill Phillips released one of the songs she penned, \"Put It Off Until Tomorrow,\" on which she provided backing vocals. The song peaked at No. 6 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart three months later, and the track's success helped garner Parton a recording contract with Monument Records. (Phillips also recorded Parton's \"The Company You Keep,\" which became another top 10 hit later that year.)\n\n\"Fuel to the Flame,\" Skeeter Davis\n\nParton's career may not have taken off without her uncle Bill Owens, who recognized his niece's talent from a young age. In her early years in Nashville, Parton would frequently write with Owens and one of their earliest cuts together was when Skeeter Davis recorded and released \"Fuel to the Flame\" as a single in 1967. A beautiful ballad of a burgeoning love, \"Fuel to the Flame\" gave Davis her first major hit in two years, helping the star prolong her career while simultaneously helping launch Dolly's.\n\n\"Kentucky Gambler,\" Merle Haggard\n\nA year before he wrote \"Always Wanting You\" for Dolly, Haggard recorded \"Kentucky Gambler\" in September 1974 at Nashville's Columbia Studios while Parton provided harmony. A song about a miner who left behind his wife and kids, \"Kentucky Gambler\" is a classic Dolly Parton story song providing a lesson on greed.\n\nReleased as a single with the Strangers later that year, Haggard's version of \"Kentucky Gambler\" reached No. 1 on Jan. 18, 1975. Parton recorded her own version of the song in 1973 and included it on her 1975 album The Bargain Store, but Haggard's rendition is most recognized today.\n\n\"There'll Always Be Music,\" Tina Turner\n\nTwo years after Tina Turner and then-husband Ike Turner got the world dancing with their iconic hit \"Proud Mary,\" Tina kicked off her solo career by dabbling in country music. Her 10-track debut solo studio album, Tina Turns the Country On!, had an A-list roster of songwriters including Kris Kristofferson, Bob Dylan, James Taylor, Hank Snow and Parton, who penned \"There'll Always Be Music.\"\n\nThe piano ballad showcased Turner's soulful vocals and was an introduction to Turner apart from the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. While the album didn't chart, it did earn Turner a GRAMMY nomination for Best R&B Vocal Performance, Female.\n\n\"I'm In No Condition,\" Hank Williams Jr.\n\nLike many of Parton's songs that were recorded by someone else, the singer still included her own version of \"I'm In No Condition\" on her 1967 album Hello, I'm Dolly. But after listening to Hank Williams Jr.'s rendition, it's hard to believe it was written for anyone but him.\n\nAn honest portrayal of the struggle in the aftermath of a breakup, the song laments a love he didn't want to end — underlined by the song's titular chorus line, \"I'm in no condition to try to love again.\" Though it wasn't one of Williams Jr.'s most successful singles, it certainly encapsulated the vulnerability the bellowing star brought to the genre.\n\n\"Circle of Love,\" Jennifer Nettles\n\nJennifer Nettles played the role of Parton's mother, Avie Lee Parton, in the 2016 television movie \"Dolly Parton's Christmas of Many Colors: Circle of Love\" based on a true story from Parton's childhood. In classic Dolly fashion, she penned the film's heartfelt title track by herself.\n\nMoved by the waltzing song's biblical message, Nettles also included her version on her solo To Celebrate Christmas holiday album released that year. Parton shared her own recording on her 2020 holiday album, A Holly Dolly Christmas, which is nominated for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album this year, and teamed up with Nettles to duet the song on \"The Voice\" that December.\n\n\"The Stranger,\" Kenny Rogers\n\nOne month before Parton and her longtime collaborator Kenny Rogers released their revered Once Upon a Christmas holiday album, Rogers unveiled his What About Me? album in October 1984. Though that project didn't include vocals from his singing partner, Rogers still had a touch of Dolly on the record: the powerful story song \"The Stranger,\" written by Parton.\n\nIt's a tale of a boy wondering why his father deserted him before he was born only to meet him a decade after his mother's death. \"The Stranger\" is a descriptive and heart-wrenching tune that pulls the listener right into the song. \"It was me and mamma that you left behind,\" Rogers croons at the song's close. \"You're just a stranger.\"\n\n\"Waltz Me to Heaven,\" Waylon Jennings\n\nWhile Parton reportedly wrote \"Waltz Me to Heaven\" for Waylon Jennings, the song first appeared on the 1984 film soundtrack for \"Rhinestone,\" starring Parton and Sylvester Stallone. Her youngest brother, Floyd Parton, sang on the original track.\n\nLater that year, Jennings included \"Waltz Me to Heaven\" on Waylon's Greatest Hits, Vol. 2. The stirring waltz highlights Jennings' memorable baritone alongside sweeping pedal steel and delicate fiddle accompaniment. Jennings' \"Waltz Me to Heaven\" made the soundtrack song a hit, reaching No. 10 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart.\n\n\"To Daddy,\" Emmylou Harris\n\nA song written from the perspective of a teenager watching an unhappy relationship between her parents transpire, \"To Daddy\" sees the mother leaving her unaffectionate husband. The poignant tale clearly meant a lot to Harris and Parton, as Emmylou released it as a single from her 1977 album, Quarter Moon in Cent Town, and Dolly included it in her 1995 compilation, The Essential Dolly Parton, Vol. 1.\n\nHarris' version also resonated with fans: It scored her a No. 3 hit on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart in 1978, and it was the only song featured on the 2003 tribute album Just Because I'm a Woman: Songs of Dolly Parton that wasn't recorded specifically for the project.\n\n\"I Will Always Love You,\" Whitney Houston\n\nLong before Whitney Houston broke countless records with her rendition of \"I Will Always Love You,\" Parton wrote and released the song as a letter to Porter Wagoner. After telling Wagoner she wanted to leave The Porter Wagoner Show countless times and Wagoner ignoring those wishes, Parton decided to do what she does best: write a song.\n\n\"I wrote the song, took it back in the next day, and I said, 'Porter, sit down. I've got something I have to sing to you,'\" Parton recalled in Dayton Duncan and Ken Burns' Country Music book and documentary. \"So, I sang it, and he was sitting at his desk, and he was crying. He said, 'That's the best thing you ever wrote. Okay, you can go, but only if I can produce that record.'\"\n\nWhile Parton's recording landed at No. 1 on two different occasions (upon its release in 1974 and again in 1982, when a new version was recorded and released for the film The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas), it was Houston's spellbinding 1992 version from The Bodyguard that took the world by storm.\n\nSpending 14 consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\" became the best-selling physical single by a woman, with 20 million copies sold to date. Houston's version also took home Record Of The Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female at the 1994 GRAMMYs — creating an everlasting legacy for Whitney and Dolly alike.\n\n30 Must-Hear Albums In 2022: Kendrick Lamar, Cardi B, Rosalía, Machine Gun Kelly, Charli XCX, Saweetie & More\n\nIf Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers landed in 2024, how would we define them? For fans of the beloved heartland rockers and their very missed leader, it's a compelling question.\n\n\"It's not active rock. It's not mainstream rock. It's not country. It would really fall in that Americana vein,\" says Scott Borchetta, the founder of Big Machine Label Group. \"When you think about what his lyrics were and are about, it's really about the American condition.\"\n\nTo Borchetta, these extended to everything in Petty's universe — his principled public statements, his man-of-the-people crusades against the music industry. \"He was an American rebel with a cause,\" Borchetta says. And when you fuse that attitude with big melodies, bigger choruses, and a grounded, earthy perspective — well, there's a lot for country fans to love.\n\nThat's what Coran Capshaw of Red Light Management bet on when he posited the idea of Petty Country: A Country Music Celebration of Tom Petty, a tribute album released June 21. Featuring leading lights like Dolly Parton (\"Southern Accents\"), Willie and Lukas Nelson (\"Angel Dream (No. 2),\" Luke Combs (\"Runnin' Down a Dream\"), Dierks Bentley (\"American Girl,\") Wynonna and Lainey Wilson (\"Refugee\"), and other country luminaries covering Tom Petty classics, Petty Country is a seamless union of musical worlds.\n\nWhich makes perfect sense: on a core level, Petty, and his band of brothers, were absolutely steeped in country — after all, they grew up in the South — Gainesville, Florida.\n\n\"Tom loved all country music. He went pretty deep into the Carter Family, and \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken?\" and the folk, Americana heart of it,\" says Petty's daughter, Adria, who helps run his estate. \"Hank Williams, and even Ernest Tubb and Patsy Cline… as a songwriter, I think a lot of that real original music influenced him enormously.\" (The Flying Burrito Brothers, and the Byrds' Gram Parsons-hijacked country phase, were also foundational.)\n\nA key architect of Petty Country was the man's longtime producer, George Drakoulias. \"He's worked with Dad for a hundred years since [1994's] Wildflowers, and he has super exquisite taste,\" Adria says.\n\nIn reaching out to prospective contributors, he and fellow music supervisor Randall Poster started at the top: none other than Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton. \"Having Willie and Dolly made people stand up and pay attention,\" Dreakoulias told Rolling Stone, and the Nashville floodgates were opened: Thomas Rhett (\"Wildflowers\"), Brothers Osborne (\"I Won't Back Down\"), Lady A (\"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\"), and so many others.\n\nEach artist gave Petty's work a distinctive, personal spin. Luke Combs jets down the highway of \"Runnin' Down the Dream\" like he was born to ride. Along with Yo-Yo Ma and founding Heartbreakers keyboardist Benmont Tench, Rhiannon Giddens scoops out the electronics and plumbs the droning, haunting essence of \"Don't Come Around Here No More.\"\n\nAnd where a lesser tribute album would have lacquered over the songs with homogenous Nashville production, Petty Country is the opposite.\n\n\"I'm not a fan of having a singular producer on records like this. I want each one of them to be their own little crown jewel,\" Borchetta says. \"That's going to give us a better opportunity for them to make the record in their own image.\"\n\nThis could mean a take that hews to the original, or casts an entirely new light on it. \"Dierks called up and said, 'Hey, do you think we would be all right doing a little bit more of a bluegrass feel to it?' I was like, 'Absolutely. If you hear it, go get it.'\"\n\n\"It had the diversity that the Petty women like on the records,\" Adria says, elaborating that they wanted women and people of color on the roster. \"We like to see those tributes to Tom reflect his values; he was always very pro-woman, which is why he has such outspoken women [laughs] in his wake.\"\n\nTwo of Petty Country's unquestionable highlights are by women. Margo Price chose \"Ways to Be Wicked,\" a cut so deep that even the hardcore Petty faithful might not know it; the Let Me Up (I've Had Enough) outtake was buried on disc six of the 1995 boxed set Playback.\n\n\"Man, it's just one of those songs that gets in your veins,\" Price says. \"He really knew how to twist the knife — that chorus, 'There's so many ways to be wicked, but you don't know one little thing about love.'\" Founding Heartbreakers guitarist Mike Campbell features on the dark, driving banger.\n\nAnd all interviewed for this article are agog over Dolly Parton's commanding take on \"Southern Accents\" — the title track of the band's lumpy, complicated, vulnerable 1985 album of the same name. \"It's just revelatory… it brings me to my knees,\" Adria says. \"It's just a phenomenal version I know my dad would've absolutely loved.\"\n\n\"It's one of Dolly's best vocals ever, and it's hair-raising,\" Borchetta says. \"You could tell she really felt that track, and what the song was about.\"\n\nAdria is filled with profuse gratitude for the artists preserving and carrying her dad's legacy.\n\n\"I'm really touched that these musicians showed up for my dad,\" she says. \"A lot of people don't want to show up for anything that's not making money for them, or in service to their career, and we really appreciate it… I owe great debt to all of these artists and their managers for making the time to think about our old man like that.\"\n\nIndeed, in Nashville and beyond, we've all been thinking about her old man, especially since his untimely passing in 2017. We'll never forget him — and will strum and sing these simple, heartfelt, and profound songs for years to come.\n\nLet Your Heart Be Your Guide: Adria Petty, Mike Campbell & More On The Enduring Significance Of Tom Petty's Wildflowers\n\n“How it all came about was a miracle,” saysTerry Britten, the co-writer and producer ofTina Turner’s “What’s Love Got To Do With It.”\n\nThe enduring single on Turner's 1984 album Private Dancer, released 40 years ago this month, was the songstress' ultimate emancipating act. It liberated her from the strictures of a music career bound to former husbandIke Turner, and debuted a new, self-possessed persona that highlighted her own rich talents as a solo artist. Decades on, the album remains a searing testament to resilience and the power of raw, honest expression.\n\nPrivate Dancer, her fifth solo outing, was the beginning of Turner's renaissance and next era. Still, some of its most powerful songs — including “What’s Love” — almost didn’t make the cut. In fact, the song’s woeful quality and halted vocals proved an obstacle for Turner.\n\n“After all this time, I’ve realized what the problem was and why she didn’t like it: because she was so damn vulnerable in it,” Britten tells GRAMMY.com. “She’d never been that vulnerable before in a song.”\n\nTurner had long wrestled with her public image and allowing listeners into her inner world. Despite her success in the '70s and the subsequent 1976 breakdown of her abusive marriage to Ike (which left her penniless), followed by less successful Las Vegas revue shows, Turner was wary of conceding defeat.\n\nHer career revival was largely born after Turner had made a cameo appearance in 1982 on the synth-inspired remake of The Temptations' “Ball of Confusion.” Masterminded by pop band Heaven 17’s Martyn Ware, the song netted Turner a singles deal with Capitol Records. Her next pairing with Ware, a remake ofAl Green’s “Let’s Stay Together,” was a runaway success, charting at number six in the UK and No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100, in late 1983 and early 1984 respectively.\n\nChart success had eluded Turner for years, so by February 1984 Capitol quickly demanded a full album — with two weeks to deliver it. With Turner already on tour in the UK then, her manager, Roger Davies, raced around London seeking potential tracks. Davies had been old friends with Britten back in Australia, and reached out about available songs.\n\nCo-written withGraham Lyle, Britten's \"What’s Love” had been skipped over by British rock singer Cliff Richard. Its rumination on sexual over romantic desire awaited a new voice.\n\nTurner's powerhouse vocals gave the track the justice it so called for. Just as her vocal prowess was put on display, \"What's Love\" also underscored Turner's ability to bring both fragility and sultriness to a song. The combination would soon propel Turner to worldwide domination.\n\nIn the studio, Britten leaned on Turner’s dancing background to make the meditative ballad work. Turner struggled with the song’s languid rhythm, so Britten suggested she jog on the spot. “We jogged at the mic,” he says. “Soon enough, she got it!”\n\nBritten believes “What’s Love” showed Turner, for the first time, how empowering vulnerability could be. “She realized she could act out these songs,” he reflects. “The whole direction of her career changed in that moment.”\n\nReleased in May 1984, “What’s Love” slowly scaled the charts, competing for prime position with the likes ofPrince’s “When Doves Cry” andLionel Ritchie’s “Stuck on You.” “What’s Love” ultimately landed at No. 1 in August 1984 — staying there for three weeks — and fast-tracked Turner’s forceful musical renaissance.\n\nThe arrival of Private Dancer only galvanized the transformation.\n\nThe album was a mixture of old and new, figuratively stitching together a reinvigorated yet still rock ’n’ roll Turner. There were completely new tracks and sounds, like the synth-infused “What’s Love” and spunky, pulsating “Show Some Respect” (another Britten number). Covers of the Beatles’ “Help!” andDavid Bowie’s “1984,” meanwhile, were reimagined with searching gospel energy and symphonic orchestral strings.\n\nThere was an emphasis on storytelling across Private Dancer, with lyrical explorations of respect, love, and desire, paired with Turner’s frayed timbre. “I Might Have Been Queen” was penned by Jeannette Obstoj and Rupert Hine in response to hearing Turner’s life story. From a youth picking cotton in Tennessee to her years as a double act with Ike, Obstoj took Turner’s trying life (and lifelong interest in Ancient Egypt) to craft an earthy narrative textured by stories of grief and self-understanding. The stomping funk result was an anthemic tribute, celebrating Turner as she sang proudly of being a “sole survivor.”\n\nAllowed into Turner’s inner sanctum, listeners could better understand and relate to the singer’s past life — whether these were real stories or imagined tales. Songs like “Private Dancer,” seemingly about a dancer who keeps a firm psychological distance from her job as a means of self-protection, couldn’t help but be tied back to Turner’s former life as the mistreated singing partner to Ike. Turner’s coarse vocals — retelling regret with the ballad “Better Be Good to Me,” or celebrating self-confidence on “Show Some Respect” — underscored her toughness as she sang about respect and recognition.\n\nTina Turner’s emotional depth and lyrical confessions resonated with critics and listeners, affirming Turner as sensitive, soulful and, above all, an iconic solo artist. The success of the record at the 1985 GRAMMYs only affirmed Turner's status.\n\nBritten, who won two gramophones for his work and joined Turner on stage to collect the GRAMMY for Record Of The Year, said that the audience — there and even at home watching — manifested her three wins that night. “In between introductions, you could hear the whole crowd going, ‘Tina! Tina! Tina!’” he says. “It was like the whole auditorium wanted her to win. In fact, they willed her to win.”\n\nThe entire musical project was a frenzied worldwide phenomenon: the confident comeback story of a 45-year-old liberated woman. Private Dancer represents a rare redemption for a female artist over 40 — a script contemporaries have taken cues from.\n\nMadonna enjoyed a return serve with her revealing 1998 spiritual album Ray of Light, a record that saw her achieve renewed commercial success — and perhaps most important to her, critical acclaim. After the abject failure of 2001’s Glitter,Mariah Carey stormed the charts (and GRAMMYs) in 2005 with her confessional but defiant album, The Emancipation of Mimi.Janet Jackson, no longer suffering public shame after the infamous Superbowl incident and finally free to release music under her own label, returned revealing a more mature, reflective artist with 2015’s Unbreakable. Each album privileged some aspect of self-exposure and sonic difference to mount a comeback where audiences were invited in.\n\nPublicly sharing some vulnerability while also celebrating fortitude, continues to enliven the story of Private Dancer — and the listening experience decades on. After Tina Turner's death in 2023, critics reappraised the record and the seismic impact of “What’s Love.” Somesaid the song was an enduring “call to action” on finding independence, while others concluded that Private Dancer alone “lifted [Turner] into the pop stratosphere.”\n\nThe record represents one of history’s greatest musical comebacks. Its emotional depth, paired with a tough if sometimes frayed sound, gave listeners a deeply resonant tale about overcoming.\n\n“She gave me such trust,” Britten says of recording with Turner. “I can’t tell you what a moving experience it was.” With Private Dancer, Turner entrusted listeners with her own vulnerable admissions, many of which continue to resonate and inspire today.\n\nRemembering The Artistry Of Tina Turner, \"The Epitome Of Power And Passion\"\n\n\"Genres are a funny little concept, aren't they? In theory, they have a simple definition that's easy to understand. But in practice, well, some may feel confined.\"\n\nWith those words, spoken on \"SPAGHETTII\" by Linda Martell — the first commercially successful Black female artist in country music and the first to play the Grand Ole Opry solo — Beyoncé provides a proxy response to her original call on Instagram 10 days before COWBOY CARTER was released: \"This ain’t a Country album. This is a “Beyoncé” album.\"\n\nShe delivered on that promise with intent. Through a mix of homage and innovation, Beyoncé's latest is a 27-track testament to her boundless musicality and draws from a rich aural palette. In addition to its country leanings, COWBOY CARTER includes everything from the soulful depths of gospel to the intricate layers of opera.\n\nBeyoncé's stance is clear: she's not here to fit into a box. From the heartfelt tribute in \"BLACKBIIRD\" to the genre-blurring tracks like \"YA YA,\" Beyoncé uses her platform to elevate the conversation around genre, culture, and history. She doesn't claim country music; she illuminates its roots and wings, celebrating the Black artists who've shaped its essence.\n\nThe collective album proves no genre was created or remains in isolation. It's a concept stoked in the words of the opening track, \"AMERIICAN REQUIEM\" when Beyonce reflects, \"Nothing really ends / For things to stay the same they have to change again.\" For country, and all popular genres of music to exist they have to evolve. No sound ever stays the same.\n\nCOWBOY CARTER's narrative arc, from \"AMERICAN REQUIEM\" to \"AMEN,\" is a journey through American music's heart and soul, paying tribute to its origins while charting a path forward. This album isn't just an exploration of musical heritage; it's an act of freedom and a declaration of the multifaceted influence of Black culture on American pop culture.\n\nHere's a closer look at some of some of the musical genres touched on in act ii, the second release of an anticipated trilogy by Beyoncé, the most GRAMMY-winning artist of all-time:\n\nCountry\n\nBefore COWBOY CARTER was even released, Beyoncé sparked critical discussion over the role of herself and all Black artists in country music. Yet COWBOY CARTER doesn't stake a claim on country music. Rather, it spotlights the genre through collaborations with legends and modern icons, while championing the message that country music, like all popular American music and culture, has always been built on the labor and love of Black lives.\n\nIt's a reckoning acknowledged not only by Beyoncé's personal connection to country music growing up in Texas, but the role Black artists have played in country music rooted in gospel, blues, and folk music.\n\nEnter The World Of Beyoncé\n\nCountry legends, Dolly Parton (\"DOLLY P\", \"JOLENE,\" and \"TYRANT\"), Willie Nelson (\"SMOKE HOUR\" and \"SMOKE HOUR II\"), and Martell (\"SPAGHETTII and \"THE LINDA MARTELL SHOW\") serve mainly as spoken-word collaborators, becoming MCs for Queen Bey. Some of the most prolific country music legends receiving her in a space where she has been made to feel unwelcome in music (most notably with the racism surrounding her 2016 CMA performance of \"Daddy Lessons\" with the Dixie Chicks) provides a prolific release of industry levies. Martell, a woman who trod the dark country road before Bey, finally getting her much-deserved dues appears as an almost pre-ordained and poetic act of justice.\n\n\"BLACKBIIRD,\" a version of the Beatles' civil rights era song of encouragement and hope for the struggle of Black women is led softly by Beyoncé, backed by a quartet of Black female contemporary country songbirds: Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy, and Reyna Roberts.\n\nBeyoncé holds space for others, using the power of her star to shine a light on those around her. These inclusions rebuke nay-sayers who quipped pre-release that she was stealing attention from other Black country artists. It also flies in the faces that shunned and discriminated against her, serving as an example of how to do better. The reality that Beyoncé wasn't stealing a spotlight, but building a stage for fellow artists, is a case study in how success for one begets success for others.\n\nRead more: 8 Country Crossover Artists You Should Know: Ray Charles, The Beastie Boys, Cyndi Lauper & More\n\nGospel, Blues, & Folk (American Roots)\n\nAs is Beyoncé's way, she mounts a case for country music with evidence to back up her testimony. She meanders a course through a sequence of styles that serve as the genre's foundation: gospel, blues, and folk music.\n\n\"AMERIICAN REQUIEM\" and \"AMEN\" bookend the album with gospel-inspired lyrics and choir vocals. The opener sets up a reflective sermon buoyed by the sounds of a reverberating church organ, while the closer, with its introspective lyrics, pleads for mercy and redemption. The main verse on \"AMEN\", \"This house was built with blood and bone/ The statues they made were beautiful/ But they were lies of stone,\" is complemented by a blend of piano, and choral harmonies.\n\nHymnal references are interlaced throughout the album, particularly in songs like \"II HANDS II HEAVEN\" and in the lyrical nuances on \"JUST FOR FUN.\" In the later track, Beyoncé's voice soars with gratitude in a powerful delivery of the lines, \"Time heals everything / I don't need anything / Hallelujah, I pray to her.\"\n\nThe gospel-inspired, blues-based \"16 CARRIAGES\" reflects the rich history of country songs borrowing from the blues while simultaneously calling back to songs sung by field laborers in the colonial American South. \"Sixteen dollars, workin' all day/ Ain't got time to waste, I got art to make\" serves as the exhausted plea of an artist working tirelessly long hours in dedication to a better life.\n\nRhiannon Giddens, a celebrated musician-scholar, two-time GRAMMY winner, and Pulitzer Prize recipient, infuses \"TEXAS HOLD 'EM\" with her profound understanding of American folk, country, and blues. She plays the viola and banjo, the latter tracing its origins to Sub-Saharan West Africa and the lutes of ancient Egypt. Through her skilled plucking and bending of the strings, Giddens bridges the rich musical heritage of Africa and the South with the soul of country, blues, and folk music.\n\nPop, Funk, Soul & Rock 'n' Roll\n\nAll in, Beyoncé is a pop star who is wrestling with labels placed on her 27-year career in COWBOY CARTER. Fittingly, she brings in two other pop artists known for swimming in the brackish water between country and pop, Miley Cyrus and Post Malone. Her intentional inclusion of two artists who have blurred genres without much cross-examination begs the question, Why should Beyoncé's sound be segregated to a different realm?\n\nOn \"YA YA\" Linda Martell returns as the listener's sonic sentinel, introducing the track like a lesson plan: \"This particular tune stretches across a range of genres. And that’s what makes it a unique listening experience.\" The tune sinks into the strummed chords of Nancy Sinatra's \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\" before leaping into a fiery dance track that features reimagined lyrics from the Beach Boys, with soulful vocal flourishes and breaks that show the throughline connection between '60s era rock, funk, and pop music.\n\nRobert Randolph lends his hands on \"16 CARRIAGES\" with a funk-infused grapple on his pedal-steel guitar. It's a style he honed through his early years touring and recording with his family band and later in his career as an in-demand collaborator working with names including the Allman Brothers, and Norah Jones.\n\nThe lesson is solidified as the album transitions into an interlude on \"OH LOUISIANA,\" featuring a sped-up sample of a classic track by Chuck Berry. This moment emphasizes the pop superstar's nod to civil rights era music history, spotlighting a controversial artist celebrated for his pioneering contributions to rock 'n' roll. (It's a part of music history Beyoncé knows well, after starring as Etta James in the 2008 film Cadillac Records, a veiled biopic of the legendary Chicago label Chess Records.)\n\nClassical & Opera\n\nOpera was missing from many listeners' Beyoncé Bingo card, but didn't surprise those that know her background. Beyoncé was trained for over a decade starting at an early age by her voice teacher David Lee Brewer, a retired opera singer who once lived with the Knowles family.\n\nCOWBOY CARTER gives sing-along fans a 101 opera class with \"DAUGHTER.\" In Italian, Beyoncé sings passages from the 1783 Italian opera \"Caro Mio Ben,\" composed by Giuseppe Tommaso Giovanni Giordani. The aria is a classic piece of vocal training that fittingly shows off her full range — taking us back to the earliest days of her vocal teachings.\n\nHip-Hop & R&B\n\nMidway through the album on \"SPAGHETTII\" Beyoncé announces, \"I ain't no regular singer, now come get everythin' you came for,\" landing right where expectations have confined her: in the throes of a romping beat, experimenting with sounds that blend hip-hop with R&B and soul. The track notably highlights the talent of Nigerian American singer/rapper Shaboozey, who also shows up to the rodeo on \"SWEET HONEY BUCKIN'\" brandishing his unique mix of hip-hop, folk-pop, and country music.\n\nBeyoncé worked with longtime collaborator Raphael Saadiq on this album, a career legend in the R&B industry, who lends his mark to several tracks on which he wrote, produced, and played multiple instruments. Beyoncé also utilizes the Louisiana songwriter Willie Jones on \"JUST FOR FUN,\" an artist who draws on a contemporary blend of country, Southern rap, and R&B in the hymnal ballad.\n\nThe violin-heavy \"TYRANT\" and \"SPAGHETTII\" both underscore hip-hop's long love affair with the classical string instrument (See: Common's \"Be,\" and Wu Tang Clan's \"Reunited\" as the tip of that particular iceberg) with a blend of soulful R&B lyrics paired with beat-based instrumentalization.\n\nIn a world quick to draw lines and label sounds, Beyoncé's COWBOY CARTER stands as a vibrant mosaic of musical influence and innovation. Ultimately, Beyoncé's COWBOY CARTER isn't seeking anyone's acceptance. As a Texan once told she didn't belong, her critical response claps back at this exclusion. It's also a reminder that in the hands of a true artist, music is limitless.\n\nRun The World: Why Beyoncé Is One Of The Most Influential Women In Music History\n\nLatin music has gone global and Enrique Iglesias is one of the superstars who laid the foundation for that crossover. The Spanish pop icon's music career spans four decades of hits both in his native tongue and in English. Following his reign as Billboard’s Greatest Latin Artist of All-Time, Iglesias marks the end of an era with the last album of his career, Final Vol. 2.\n\nIglesias followed in the footsteps of his father, singer/songwriter Julio Iglesias, and made his own debut in the 1990s with Spanish-language love songs. He began singing in English at the end of the decade, and subsequently led an explosion of interest in Latin pop alongside acts like Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, and later Shakira.\n\nAs of writing, Iglesias has a record-breaking 27 No. 1 singles on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart, and solidified himself as a global heartthrob with an allure that defies language barriers. For his efforts, Iglesias has won one GRAMMY and five Latin GRAMMY Awards.\n\nEnrique Iglesias will release what will likely be his final album on March 29, aptly titled Final (Vol. 2). Ahead of his final bow, here are 10 tracks that celebrate Iglesias' legacy in Latin music.\n\n\"Experiencia Religiosa\" (1995)\n\nIglesias proved that he was here to stay with his third album, 1997's Cosas Del Amor. The LP includes one of his signature love songs, \"Nunca Te Olvidaré.\"\n\nIglesias' voice reached angelic highs in the Spanish-language power ballad, which details romance that left a lasting impression. No matter what happened, the love Iglesias shared with that person couldn't be forgotten — much like his impact on the Latin pop explosion that was brewing.\n\n\"Bailamos\" (1999)\n\nProving he was so much bigger than the Iglesias last name, he crossed over into the English-language market with his 1999 album Enrique. Iglesias became a global Latin pop heartthrob with the sultry club banger \"Bailamos.\" The song was featured on the Wild Wild West soundtrack, after Will Smith personally invited Iglesias to contribute music to the project.\n\nBacked by the strum of the Spanish guitar with alluring synths, he invited the world to dance with him in English and Spanish. In a major moment for Latin acts at the time, the song topped the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 chart. The massive success of the song led Iglesias to sign with Interscope Records, where he released his breakthrough album.\n\n\"Could I Have This Kiss Forever\" (1999)\n\nOne of the underrated gems on Iglesias' Enrique album is his collaboration with six-time GRAMMY-winner Whitney Houston.\n\nThe late pop legend joined forces with him for the sensual \"Could I Have This Kiss Forever,\" making worlds collide with an irresistible mix of Latin percussion, Spanish guitar, and R&B. Houston also sang a bit in Spanish with Iglesias. His dreamy duet with Houston (who also sings in Spanish) broke down barriers for collaborations between Latin and English-language pop acts. In the years that followed, he collaborated with superstars like Kelis, Ciara, and Usher.\n\n\"Hero\" (2001)\n\nIglesias' love songs in English touched the hearts of millions around the world. One of his enduring classics is the empowering \"Hero\" from his 2001 album Escape.\n\nThe beautiful ballad was released in both English and Spanish. In one of most tender vocal performances, Iglesias serenades his lover with sweet lyrics about always being by her side. After the song impressively peaked at No. 3 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, Iglesias proved that his star power was here to stay.\n\nThe song also became an anthem of hope for the U.S. following the Sept. 11 attacks, and Iglesias was invited to perform \"Hero\" for the broadcast special \"America: A Tribute to Heroes.\"\n\n\"Bailando\" (2014)\n\nAfter laying the foundation for the globalization of Latin music, Iglesias enjoyed one of his greatest career triumphs in 2014 — in both Spanish and English.\n\nThe feel-good smash \"Bailando\" blended Caribbean rhythms with flamenco influences, bringing together Sean Paul and Cuba's Descemer Bueno and Gente De Zona. The Spanglish banger peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. At the 2014 Latin GRAMMYs, Iglesias and his collaborators took home golden gramophones for Song Of The Year, Best Urban Performance, and Best Urban Song.\n\nThe success of the song also helped usher in the reggaeton music revival of the last decade. Pop and reggaeton collaborations became more commonplace with songs like \"Despacito\" by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee and J Balvin’s \"Mi Gente\" remix with Beyoncé later following suit.\n\n\"Beautiful\" (2014)\n\nIglesias joined forces with GRAMMY-winning dance-pop icon Kylie Minogue for \"Beautiful,\" a haunting love song about a formidable romance that could withstand the apocalypse.\n\nThe electronic ballad was co-produced by Mark Taylor, who was also at the helm of Iglesias' collaboration with Houston. Iglesias and Minogue's voices melted together in a hypnotic harmony that made this song live up to its name. The song was included on Minogue’s Kiss Me Once album and deluxe edition of Iglesias’ Sex and Love LP.\n\n\"El Baño\" (2018)\n\nBefore he became a GRAMMY-winning global star, Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny teamed up with Iglesias for a freaky reggaeton romp, \"El Baño.\"\n\nIglesias first turned up the heat by singing about getting intimate with his lover in the restroom. Bad Bunny dropped in that halfway point as his wingman with a fiery guest verse. The hypnotic collaboration was included on Iglesias' penultimate album Final (Vol. 1).\n\nIglesias later added a woman’s perspective to the song, bringing on Dominican reggaeton star Natti Natasha joining them on the remix. As one of Latin pop’s most daring artists, he was never afraid to push boundaries with his risque tracks.\n\n\"Space In My Heart\" (2024)\n\nAfter the release of his reggaeton-heavy Final (Vol. 1), Iglesias was ready to be more adventurous with the music that followed. In 2022, Iglesias ventured into country music for the first time with \"Espacio En Tu Corazón.\"\n\nTo bring some more authenticity to the English-language version of the song, \"Space In My Heart,\" Iglesias teamed up with GRAMMY-winning country star Miranda Lambert. The breathtaking country-pop ballad features Iglesias and Lambert singing passionately about winning over the hearts of their crushes.\n\nThe song is a highlight on the last album of his career, Final (Vol. 2). And while it seems like this may be the singer's final hurrah, Iglesias told PEOPLE in 2021: \"No, I'm never gonna retire! I'm gonna keep on writing songs but that doesn't mean I need to be putting out albums every so often.\"\n\n\"Fría\" (2024)\n\nIglesias is going out in style with \"Fría.\" For the most vibrant song on Final Vol. 2, Iglesias collaborates with Cuban singer/songwriter Yotuel on a frisky and refreshing banger, which blends reggaeton beats with elements of tropical music.\n\nIglesias sounds like he's having a blast with Yotuel as they try to convince their partners there was no infidelity at last night's wild party. \"I just went out for a cold one,\" Iglesias winkingly sings in Spanish. Cheers to the legacy of one of Latin pop's greater stars.\n\n10 Women Artists Leading A Latin Pop Revolution: Kenia Os, Belinda & More"
