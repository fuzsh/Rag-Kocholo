        "text": "Tennessee Williams (born Thomas Lanier Williams, March 26, 1911 â€“ February 25, 1983) was an American playwright who received many of the top theatrical awards for his works of drama. He moved to New Orleans in 1939 and changed his name to \"Tennessee\", the state of his father's birth.\n\nHe won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for A Streetcar Named Desire in 1948 and for Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in 1955. In addition, The Glass Menagerie (1945) and The Night of the Iguana (1961) received New York Drama Critics' Circle Awards. His 1952 play The Rose Tattoo received the Tony Award for best play.\n\nPlaywright, Author. Thomas Lanier Williams III, known by his pen name Tennessee Williams, was an American playwright. Along with contemporaries Eugene O'Neill and Arthur Miller, he is considered among the three foremost playwrights of 20th-century American drama. At age 33, after years of obscurity, Williams suddenly became famous with the success of \"The Glass Menagerie\" (1944) in New York City. This play closely reflected his own unhappy family background. It was the first of a string of successes, including \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1947), \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" (1955), \"Sweet Bird of Youth\" (1959), and \"The Night of the Iguana\" (1961). With his later work, Williams attempted a new style that did not appeal as widely to audiences. His drama \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" is often numbered on short lists of the finest American plays of the 20th century alongside Eugene O'Neill's \"Long Day's Journey into Night\" and Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman.\" Much of Williams' most acclaimed work has been adapted for the cinema. He also wrote short stories, poetry, essays and a volume of memoirs. In 1979, four years before his death, Williams was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame"
