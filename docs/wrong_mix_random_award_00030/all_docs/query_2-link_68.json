        "text": "MSNBC did not air its signature political talk show “Morning Joe” on Monday over concerns its hosts may make an inappropriate comment regarding the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, CNN .\n\nHosts of the left-leaning program often engage in critical of Trump and his actions. Anchor Joe Scarborough in March claimed Trump is to blame for young rape victims having “state-forced births.”\n\nA CNN source reportedly said MSNC pulled the program because such comments could prove damaging to the network during such a sensitive political moment. The network is instead reportedly focusing on the Republican National Committee during Morning Joe’s Monday timeslot and will air the segment again on Tuesday.\n\n“Given the gravity and complexity of this unfolding story, NBC News, NBC News NOW and MSNBC have remained in rolling breaking news coverage since Saturday evening,” a spokesperson for NBCUniversal News Group told the outlet. “As we continue to cover this story into the week, the networks will continue to cross simulcast, alternating between NBC News, NBC News NOW and ‘MSNBC Reports,’ so there is one news feed covering this developing situation.”\n\nMany major Democrats have been forced to retract statements regarding the actions of Trump’s attempted assassin. Colorado state Rep. Steven Woodrow, D-Denver, earned backlash for suggesting “the last thing America needed was sympathy for the devil but here we are.”\n\nTennessee state Sen. London Lamar, D-Memphis, also wrote “the extremism from the MAGA regime has brought us to this moment.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden is reportedly an watcher of Morning Joe and often becomes frustrated if the program runs poor coverage of him. The president called into the show last week to dissuade those who questioned whether he could handle another term in the White House.\n\nJackson Walker on X at @_jlwalker_ for the latest trending national news.
