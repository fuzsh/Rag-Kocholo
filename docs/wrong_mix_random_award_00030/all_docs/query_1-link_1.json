        "text": "American basketball player (born 1998)\n\nGrant Dean Williams (born November 30, 1998) is an American professional basketball player for the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Williams played college basketball for the Tennessee Volunteers. He was drafted 22nd overall in the 2019 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics and reached the NBA Finals with the team in 2022.\n\nWilliams was elected as the First Vice President of the National Basketball Players Association in February 2023, replacing Andre Iguodala in the role.[1]\n\nBorn in Houston, Texas, Williams moved to Charlotte, North Carolina as a child.[2][3] He attended Providence Day School in Charlotte, where he was teammates with future and fellow NBA player Devon Dotson.[4] As a junior in 2014–15, he averaged 18 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game while leading the Chargers to a 25–5 overall record. As a senior, Williams averaged 15.8 points, 10.1 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 3.0 blocks per game.[3]\n\nRated a three-star recruit in the class of 2016, Williams committed to Tennessee on November 13, 2015.[5][6][7]\n\nWilliams was an All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) player as a freshman, sophomore and junior for the Tennessee Volunteers.[3] He was awarded back-to-back SEC Player of the Year honors for the 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons, becoming the first player to do so since Corliss Williamson in 1995.[8] Williams led Tennessee as a third seed in the 2018 NCAA tournament and second seed in the 2019 NCAA tournament.\n\nWilliams was selected with the 22nd overall draft pick by the Boston Celtics in the 2019 NBA draft.[9] On July 11, 2019, the Celtics announced that they had signed him to a four-year, $11.8 million rookie-scale contract.[10] On October 23, 2019, Williams made his professional debut, coming off the bench in a loss to the Philadelphia 76ers.[11] On December 4, 2019, he made his first career start in a winning effort against the Miami Heat.[12] In an effort to garner support for teammates making the 2020 NBA All-Star Game, Williams pledged to dye his hair pink if Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Kemba Walker all received a selection.[13] However, Williams did not do so as Brown did not make the team. Williams finished his rookie season averaging just over 15 minutes per game in 69 games, 3.4 points per game and 2.6 rebounds per game.[14]\n\nUpon completion of the 2020–21 NBA season, Williams' second season in the league, he slightly increased his averages in all major statistical categories. He finished the season averaging just over 18 minutes per game, 4.7 points per game and 2.8 rebounds per game.[15]\n\nOn March 21, 2022, Williams scored a then career-high 20 points in a win against the Oklahoma City Thunder.[16] He finished the 2021–22 NBA season with career-best averages with over 24 minutes per game, 7.8 points per game and 3.6 rebounds per game. On May 15, Williams scored a career-high 27 points in a decisive game 7 win over the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. His performance was highlighted by a 7-for-18 mark from three point range, records for both made threes and three attempts in an NBA game 7. Williams helped the Celtics reach the NBA Finals, but lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games.\n\nOn October 26, 2022, Williams was suspended for one game without pay for making contact with a game official during a 102–120 loss to the Chicago Bulls two days earlier.[17]\n\nOn March 6, 2023, Williams missed two critical free throws in the final seconds, costing his team the victory. Adding to the disappointment, Williams yelled at Cavs shooting guard Donovan Mitchell before the shots that he would make them both. Despite his pledge, both shots missed their mark, resulting in a 118–114 loss in overtime. Williams was attacked online with fans naming him \"Not him\".[18]\n\nOn May 19, 2023, during game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals versus the Miami Heat, Williams had nine points, two rebounds, two assists and one block in 26 minutes off the bench.[19] After Williams scored on a three-pointer to give Boston a 96–87 lead with 6:37 left, he mouthed some words to Heat forward Jimmy Butler while in transition to defense. Williams then fouled Butler on a made basket.[20] They then confronted each other verbally, resulting in technical fouls being issued to both players.[21][22][23] Butler said that the incident energized him; the Heat finished the game on a 24–9 run and won 111–105.[21]\n\nOn July 12, 2023, Williams was traded to the Dallas Mavericks in a sign-and-trade agreement.[24] He made his debut for the Mavericks on October 25, 2023, in a 126–119 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[25]\n\nOn February 8, 2024, Williams was traded to the Charlotte Hornets alongside Seth Curry and a 2027 first-round pick in exchange for P. J. Washington and two future second-round picks.[26]\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2019–20 Boston 69 5 15.1 .412 .250 .722 2.6 1.0 .4 .5 3.4 2020–21 Boston 63 9 18.1 .437 .372 .588 2.8 1.0 .5 .4 4.7 2021–22 Boston 77 21 24.4 .475 .411 .905 3.6 1.0 .5 .7 7.8 2022–23 Boston 79 23 25.9 .454 .395 .770 4.6 1.7 .5 .4 8.1 2023–24 Dallas 47 33 26.4 .413 .376 .745 3.6 1.7 .5 .6 8.1 Charlotte 29 10 30.6 .503 .373 .765 5.1 3.2 .7 .4 13.9 Career 364 101 22.6 .453 .377 .768 3.6 1.4 .5 .5 7.0\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2021 Boston 1 0 1.9 — — — 1.0 .0 .0 .0 .0 Career 1 0 1.9 — — — 1.0 .0 .0 .0 .0\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2020 Boston 17 0 10.0 .577 .588 .700 1.5 .4 .1 .3 2.8 2021 Boston 5 0 11.4 .500 .500 1.000 2.0 .8 .2 .8 3.4 2022 Boston 24 5 27.3 .433 .393 .808 3.8 .8 .3 .8 8.6 2023 Boston 15 0 17.7 .472 .450 .800 2.2 1.2 .3 .4 5.1 Career 61 5 18.8 .461 .433 .800 2.6 .8 .3 .5 5.7\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2016–17 Tennessee 32 29 25.4 .504 .375 .667 5.9 1.1 .8 1.9 12.6 2017–18 Tennessee 35 35 28.8 .473 .120 .764 6.0 1.9 .6 1.3 15.2 2018–19 Tennessee 37 37 31.9 .564 .326 .819 7.5 3.2 1.1 1.5 18.8 Career 104 101 28.9 .516 .291 .758 6.5 2.1 .9 1.5 15.7\n\nHis mother, Teresa Johnson, is an electrical engineer for NASA.[27] His father, Gilbert, is a jazz artist and former college basketball player, who has worked as a bodyguard for musicians, including Prince.[28] He is a cousin of former NBA players Salim and Damon Stoudamire.[29] Turning down offers from Ivy League schools Harvard and Yale,[30] Williams graduated from Tennessee in three years with a degree in business.[31] At Tennessee, he received the C & C Millwright Athletic Scholarship.[32]\n\nWilliams threw out the first pitch at the Boston Red Sox game on August 7, 2019.[29]"
