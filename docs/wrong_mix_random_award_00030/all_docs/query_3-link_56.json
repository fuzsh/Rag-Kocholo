        "meta_description": "Williams was born Thomas Lanier Williams III, of Welsh descent, in Columbus, Mississippi to Edwina and Cornelius Williams. His grandfather was Walter Dakin, the local Episcopal priest, and his maternal grandmother was a music teacher. His father was a hard-drinking traveling salesman who spent most of his time away, while his mother, Edwina, was considered a \"Southern belle,\" with beauty and social inclinations, often performing as a singer.\r\n\r\nHe had one brother, Dakin, and a sister, Rose. He became closest to his sister, their ages only sixteen months apart. Theater scholar Allean Hale notes that they were \"as inseparable as twins, sometimes referred to as 'The Couple.'\" She adds that they were so close that \"when one was ill, the other developed symptoms;\" she would become his \"only companion\" as a child. Hale speculates that his growing up in a female-dominated environment gave Williams the \"empathy\" for his woman characters as a playwright. Rose would become a prominent feature",
