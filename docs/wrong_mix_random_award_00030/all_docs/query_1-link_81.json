        "text": "Centennial weekend events at Georgetown University March 24-27, 2011 explore the man and the material — featuring Edward Albee, John Waters, Michael Kahn, Theodore Bikel, Kathleen Chalfant, Sarah Marshall, Ted van Griethuysen, Rick Foucheux, Target Margin Theater, Christopher Durang, Joy Zinoman, and more.\n\nWashington, D.C. — Georgetown University Theater and Performance Studies Program, in partnership with the American Studies Program and Arena Stage at the Mead Center for American Theater, presents the Tennessee Williams Centennial Festival (Tenn Cent Fest), a multifaceted celebration of Williams’ indelible legacy on the occasion of his 100th birthday.\n\nAs part of the festival, a special Centennial Weekend Celebration (March 24-27, 2011) held at venues on Georgetown University’s main campus in Washington, D.C. will feature fully staged productions, interactive multimedia experiences, workshops, concerts, panels, screenings, discussions, and readings — bringing together work by many of the leading professionals from around the world and across D.C. with Georgetown students and faculty. Events will appeal to both aficionados of Williams and those new to his work alike, offering fresh perspectives on Williams’ established classics, as well as rarely performed experimental and neglected works. The festival features not only Williams’ fictional works (many of which are highly autobiographical), but also non-fiction works and adaptations which reveal Williams’ character and his unique place in American culture.\n\nDavis Performing Arts Center Artistic Director and Theater and Performance Studies Program associate professor Derek Goldman says, “To celebrate Williams’ legacy is also to reckon with the complexity, beauty, and despair that made up his life, so powerfully and prolifically documented in his memoirs, letters, essays, notebooks, and so memorably and often nakedly poured into his artistic creations. The opportunity to engage so deeply with the singular lyricism, tenderness, violence, excess, desire, laughter, and tragedy that characterize Williams’ work and life has inspired and transformed our students and our wider community. His work is still radical. It was not only ahead of its time, but is in many ways ahead of our time.”\n\nAssociate Professor Diana Owen, director of the Georgetown University American Studies Program, says “The Tenn Cent Fest provides an opportunity for students, scholars, artists, and admirers of Williams to examine his life and work from multiple perspectives. Williams’ extensive repertoire stands as a unique record of American history and culture that informs our understanding of society today. The festival draws upon talents from across disciplines and generations to enhance our appreciation of Williams’ singular contributions and entertain us along the way.”\n\nTenn Cent Fest highlights include the following:\n\nThursday-Saturday, February 24-26 at 8 p.m.\n\nSunday, February 27 at 2 p.m.\n\nThursday-Saturday, March 17-19 at 8 p.m.\n\nSunday, March 20 at 2 p.m.\n\nWednesday and Thursday, March 23 and 24 at 8 p.m.\n\nSaturday, March 26 at 2 p.m.\n\nGEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY THEATER & PERFORMANCE STUDIES PROGRAM\n\nThe Glass Menagerie\n\nBy Tennessee Williams\n\nDirected by Professor Derek Goldman\n\nIn a tenement apartment in 1930’s St. Louis, the Wingfield family struggles to hang on to their dreams for the future. Featuring Professor Sarah Marshall as Amanda Wingfield, this innovative production of Williams highly autobiographical masterpiece captures the fragility and stifled yearning of characters clinging to hope against the harsh realities of a rapidly changing world. Offered as part of the partnership between Arena Stage at the Mead Center for American Theater and Georgetown University, the production and surrounding events are presented at Georgetown Feb. 24-March 26 and then at the Mead Center June 9-July 3.\n\nDAVIS PERFORMING ARTS CENTER, GONDA THEATRE\n\nFri/Sat Evening Only: $18 general / $15 faculty, staff, alumni, senior / $10 student\n\nAll Other Performances: $15 general / $12 faculty, staff, alumni, senior / $7 student\n\nFebruary 26-March 27\n\nGEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY THEATER & PERFORMANCE STUDIES PROGRAM\n\nThe Glass Menagerie Project\n\nIn addition to the fully staged production of this Williams classic, a diverse range of additional short pieces will complement the show, exploring aspects of Williams’ life and family that inform the highly autobiographical play. Content will be drawn from his notebooks, memoirs, essays, and letters, as well as the numerous versions of the story that he grappled with in different forms (the screenplay of The Gentleman Caller; the play The Pretty Trap, with its happy ending; the short stories “Portrait of a Girl in Glass” and “If You Breathe It Breaks,” many of which have rarely been seen). Using the play as a prism, the Project digs into Williams’ deeply layered creative process around The Glass Menagerie and how he ultimately arrived at the final masterpiece. Works will be presented in different combinations at different performances.\n\nDAVIS PERFORMING ARTS CENTER, GONDA THEATRE\n\nSee Glass Menagerie Project schedule below.\n\nSaturday, February 26 at 10:45 p.m.\n\nSunday, February 27 at 5 p.m.\n\nSaturday, March 19 at 10:45 p.m.\n\nalso presented March 26 and 27 with Elegy for Rose and The Menagerie Variations (see below)\n\nThe Glass Menagerie Project: For Whom the Southern Bell Tolls\n\nThis 30-minute parody of Tennessee Williams’ classic “The Glass Menagerie” is one of Durang’s most popular one acts, a crackpot comedy of parent-child tensions that appeals to audiences unfamiliar with the play as well as those who have deep knowledge of it.

Set in 1945, following the opening of his first Broadway success, The Glass Menagerie, this provocative and intimate portrait offers a unique glimpse into the heart of the young Williams – the desires and demons that shaped him, and the muse who inspired yet nearly destroyed him.
