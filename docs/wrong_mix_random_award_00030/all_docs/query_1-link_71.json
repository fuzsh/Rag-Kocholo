        "text": "On September 9, 2017 I found myself sitting in a “sea of orange” at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. (Heinz Field is a stadium located in the North Shore neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. It primarily serves as the home to the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League and the (University of) Pittsburgh Panthers of the National Collegiate Athletic Association.) Orange is one of the colors of Oklahoma State University (OSU). Now, you may ask, “Why is a Pittsburgh gal wearing orange and sitting in a “sea of orange” at Heinz Field?”\n\nA most appropriate question. Dear friends from Oklahoma came to Pittsburgh to see their OSU Cowboys play the Pittsburgh Panthers in a college football game. So, I ended up in a section filled with OSU fans all decked out in orange (or something representing OSU) and all with a level of enthusiasm that gave the football team the “12th player” that the fans are often referred to. (The fans, when cheering loudly, are often considered the “12th player” because their enthusiasm transfers to the players and often something good/big happens on the field in favor of their team.)\n\nEnthusiasm is showing an excitement for something and the OSU fans that day were over-the-top enthusiastic. They were excited. They were energetic. They were passionate about the game. And, they were interested in what was happening on the field. All of these qualities that the OSU fans had in abundance that day are the same qualities that can help us negotiate the ups and downs that we might experience with change.\n\nThink about what change does to you, especially unexpected change. You get moved off center; things shift. You often have to step out of your comfort zone. While some things may remain the same or seem similar, often there is much in the new environment that is different. Oftentimes what is different is hard to accept. However, developing a deep interest in the change, in the difference(s), or at least developing a deep interest in one aspect of what has changed will help make the change a little easier to come to grips with. And, if for some reason you aren’t able to develop any interest in the “change,” if you can determine at least one thing in your life about which you are interested, enthusiastic or passionate and can focus on that, that in itself will help you deal with whatever is changing around you.\n\nImproving this one single quality (being enthusiastic) in the changed environment can change your life for the better. When you are enthusiastic about something, you are excited to deal with it. When you are enthusiastic about something, you get so engrossed in dealing with it or working through it or with it that time just flies by. When you are enthusiastic about something, you put your whole heart and soul into making it happen and when you do this, you often forget that there has been a change; that you are no longer in your original comfort zone. Your enthusiasm can often create a new comfort zone in the changed environment. Being enthusiastic when dealing with change has other benefits which include:\n\nHelps us maintain a positive outlook. It is difficult to be around someone who is positive, upbeat, and has a zest for life without some of that same feeling catching hold to us. Enthusiasm is contagious and can spread from person to person quickly and easily.\n\nEnhances motivation. Enthusiasm is the fire that lights us up and keeps us moving forward in the face of difficulties. It gives us momentum. It lifts us up when the situation looks dark, and it energizes us when we are tired. As Norman Vincent Peale said, “Enthusiasm releases the drive to carry you over obstacles and adds significance to all you do.”\n\nPuts us in a position to better deal with fear, worry, and stress. The positive outlook that comes with enthusiasm helps us see the lighter side of life and helps us laugh at the craziness around us. When we can keep things in perspective and see the humor around us, then we are better able to manage the fear, worry, and stress that might accompany the unknowns of a change.\n\nConnects us with our inner child. Our inner child is one enthusiastic rascal. Think back to when you were younger and approached many things with wide-eyed wonder. Think about how creative you could be. When we have unbridled enthusiasm, we can release our inner child and qualities like creativity and risk taking may come to the forefront – qualities that can help us move beyond a sticking point in a change environment. Enthusiasm can generate creativity which can lead to innovation which can lead to coming up with ways of effectively and positively dealing with change.\n\nReinforces confidence. Being enthusiastic makes us feel good about ourselves. When we feel good about ourselves, we are confident. When we are confident, we do not worry as much about things that may or may not happen (especially in a changed environment). We are more likely to take risks and not worry about making mistakes or failing (both of which may be needed in dealing with change) when we are confident about who we are and what we are doing.\n\nWhen dealing with change, enthusiasm can make the difference between success and failure. If we mope and fight the change, we may be doomed. If we cope and look for ways to co-exist with the change, we will most likely thrive. Enthusiasm is the fire that lights us up and keeps us moving forward in the face of difficulties. It lifts us up when the situation looks dark, and it energizes us when we are tired. Being enthusiastic about our approach to things in a changed environment can increase our experience in a really good way. And, if we can see/find the good in the change, we are in a wonderful position to manage the change and thrive in the changed environment."
