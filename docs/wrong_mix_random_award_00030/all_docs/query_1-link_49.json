        "text": "Mark the calendar for the award-winning 1944 Tennessee Williams classic The Glass Menagerie on stage Oct. 17- Oct. 26 at Lone Star College-CyFair.\n\nAmanda Wingfield, an aging Southern Belle, longs for her youth and dreams of a better life for her children, Tom and Laura. Her restless son, a would-be poet and the storys narrator, gets swept up in his mothers well-meaning, yet heartbreaking schemes to find his painfully shy sister a husband.\n\nFew plays have explored the byways of the human heart as poignantly and poetically as this exquisite family drama filtered through Toms memory, said Jeff Wax, director.\n\nPerformances will be held at 7:30 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays Oct. 17, Oct. 18, Oct. 24, and Oct. 25 and 3 p.m. Sundays Oct. 19 and Oct. 26 in the Main Stage Theatre at 9191 Barker Cypress.\n\nIn addition, History Professors James Seymour and Sandra Harvey will moderate a post-show talk-back Sunday, Oct. 19."
