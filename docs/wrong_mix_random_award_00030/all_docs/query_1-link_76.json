        "text": "In the 1920s and 1930s, New Orleans’ French Quarter was home to one of America’s most influential playwrights—Tennessee Williams. An iconic figure in literature and theater, Williams’ works remain classics of the stage and screen.\n\nBorn in Columbus, Mississippi, Williams moved to New Orleans with his family at the age of eight. He quickly fell in love with the city’s culture and unbridled spirit, which inspired many of his most famous plays like A Streetcar Named Desire and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.\n\nThroughout his life, Williams lived in many different places around the world—but he always returned to New Orleans as a source of inspiration for his work. In fact, many of his characters were based on actual people he met living in the French Quarter during his visits. His plays often captured the excitement and chaos that comes with living in such a vibrant city.\n\nToday, fans from all over flock to New Orleans to pay homage to Tennessee Williams. Whether it's exploring some of his favorite haunts or taking in a theatrical production based on one of his works—there are plenty of ways to experience the literary genius' legacy throughout town.\n\nFrom visiting The Historic Carousel Bar—which was featured in Sweet Bird Of Youth—to strolling down Bourbon Street at night where much of A Streetcar Named Desire takes place; make sure to take some time during your trip to celebrate Tennessee Williams' lasting impression on New Orleans."
