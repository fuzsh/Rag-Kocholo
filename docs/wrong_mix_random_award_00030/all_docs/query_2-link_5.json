        "text": "Anton in Show Business\n\n-4, 2014 at 7:30 p.m.\n\nOct. 5, 2014 at 2 p.m.\n\nWritten by Jane Martin\n\nDirected by Brian LeTraunik\n\nStudio Theatre\n\nThis madcap comedy follows three actresses across the footlights, down the rabbit hole and into a strangely familiar Wonderland that looks a lot like American theatre. As these women pursue their dream of performing Chekhov in Texas, they're whisked through a maelstrom of \"good ideas\" that offer unique solutions to the Three Sister's need to have life's deeper purpose revealed. In the tradition of great backstage comedies, Anton in Show Business conveys the joys, pains and absurdities of \"putting on a play\" at the turn of the century.\n\nEleemosynary\n\n-8, 2014 at 7:30 p.m.\n\nNov. 9, 2014 at 2 p.m.\n\nWritten by Lee Blessing\n\nDirected by Deena Conley\n\nStudio Theatre\n\nLee Blessing often focuses on family dynamics in his plays. Eleemosynary , one of his most acclaimed works, is no exception. The play focuses on the lives of three Wesbrook women: Dorothea, Artie and Echo. Dorothea, an admitted New Age eccentric, has complicated the lives of the two other Wesbrook women by imposing her thwarted dreams on them. Blessing presents fragmented vignettes of the lives of the three women as they struggle to define themselves both as individuals and as part of a family unit. In this poignant and mature study of familial relationships, Blessing highlights the human need for connection and forgiveness.\n\nAcademic Lecture Series: Judith Jamison, Alvin Ailey Artistic Director\n\nNov. 10, 2014, 7:30 - 9 p.m.\n\nUniversity Theatre\n\nJudith Jamison - American dancer, choreographer and artistic director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater - is a legendary icon in the world of the performing arts. Ms. Jamison, who as a dancer with the troupe, from 1965 to 1980, became the most stellar of modern dance's female performers, was appointed artistic director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in December 1989 at the request of her mentor, Alvin Ailey, who personally chose her to succeed him before his untimely death. In her decades at the helm of one of the most respected dance companies in America, Ms. Jamison has successfully kept the Alvin Ailey brand alive.\n\nThe Lamar University Academic Lecture Series, sponsored by the students, brings a significant element to the university experience by allowing Lamar’s academic community to offer two lectures each year featuring prominent speakers from disciplines represented by each of the university’s colleges. Previous speakers include astronaut Sally Ride, entrepreneur Jerry Greenfield, journalist Tony Snow and professional basketball player Bob Love.\n\nThe lecture is free to the public.\n\nFall Dance Concert\n\nUniversity Theatre\n\nGuest choreographers and artists will enhance the varied dance offerings in this concert.\n\nThe Glass Menagerie\n\n-28, 2015 at 7:30 p.m.\n\nWritten by Tennessee Williams\n\nDirected by Joel Grothe\n\nStudio Theatre"
