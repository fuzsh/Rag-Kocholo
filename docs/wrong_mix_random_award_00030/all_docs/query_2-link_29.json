Holliman\n\nBiographical Note\n\nRalph Ancil Wooster was a born at home in Baytown, Texas on November 9, 1928. As a child he did farm chores and as a teen worked in his father’s filling station. He always loved reading and had a passion for history. While a student at Robert E. Lee High School he belonged to the junior historians and wrote articles for their publication. He continued his education at Lee Junior College where he graduated in 1948. Then he attended the University of Houston where he obtained both ba and ma degrees by 1950.\n\nHe earned a Ph.D. from the University of Texas in 1954 where he was influenced by UT historians including Fulmer Mood, a student of landmark historian Frederick Jackson Turner, who introduced him to the collective biography; Barnes F. Lathrop, who utilized cliometrics, or the application of quantification to historical research, often making use of the federal census, a previously underutilized resource for historians, and the legendary Walter Prescott Webb who was a model of prolific research and writing.\n\nRalph Wooster served in the U.S. Army between 1944-1953, he was assigned to the Historical Division Headquarters, US Army Europe in Germany where he worked on SECRET and TOP SECRET historical reports for the Army.\n\nDr. Wooster joined the faculty in the history department at Lamar in 1955, where he worked as an instructor until 1957 when he was promoted to assistant professor. He served as associate professor from 1959-1962. Dr. Wooster became a full professor in 1964. He served as head of the Department of History from 1966-1970.\n\nProfessor Wooster is a well-known, accomplished historian who specializes in the American Civil War. His contributions to the field include hundreds of book reviews for scholarly journals, The Beaumont Enterprise, and Review of Texas Books, a Lamar University publication. He was a frequent presence at historical conferences where he gave papers and served as a commentator.\n\nWooster has a remarkable record of scholarship. He has written over 70 articles for scholarly publications and is the author, co-author, or editor of eleven books, \"The Secession Conventions of the South\" (Princeton University Press, 1962); \"The People in Power: Courthouse and Statehouse in the Lower South 1850-1960\" (University of Tennessee Press, 1969); \"Politicians, Planters, and Plain Folk: Courthouse and Statehouse in the Upper South\" (University of Tennessee Press, 1975); \"Texas and Texans in the Civil War\" (Eakin Press, 1995); \"Civil War Texas: A History and a Guide\" (Texas State Historical Association, 1999); \"Lone Star Generals in Gray\" (Eakin Press, 2000); \"Lone Star Regiments in Gray\" (Eakin Press, 2002); \"Texas and Texans in World War II\" (Eakin Press, 2005); and \"Texas and Texans in the Great War\" (State House Press, 2009). He was the co-author of \"Texas and Texans\" (Steck-Vaughn, 1972; revised 1978, 1987, and 1993), a junior high school textbook adopted by the State of Texas; co-editor of \"Texas Vistas\" (Texas State Historical Association, 1980; revised 1986 and 2006); and was the editor of \"Lone Star Blue and Gray: Essays on Texas in the Civil War\" (Texas State Historical Association, 1995).\n\nDr. Wooster’s knowledge and prestige as a historian was acknowledged by his serving as a consultant to David Wolper’s Production on the ABC Television Network, and as an editorial consultant to Random House, Princeton University Press, and the Texas State Historical Association Press.\n\nOne of his colleagues wrote of Wooster’s teaching: “Wooster would teach as Spencer Tracy acted, straightforward, honest, and compelling.” He was one of those rare professors who genuinely cared about his students, had a zeal for what he was teaching, and exhibited fairness and openness and because of this he consistently received student evaluations which said he had no faults as an instructor.\n\nDr. Wooster’s distinctions include teaching one of the first two graduate classes at Lamar and the first history graduate class. By 1976 he had supervised 27 completed master’s theses in history at Lamar. One of Wooster’s great legacies is the number of his students that are contributing to the field of history as teachers, museum professionals, and administrators.\n\nRalph Wooster’s excellence at teaching and scholarship was acknowledged with awards including being chosen as Piper Professor, which is awarded to only ten professors in Texas each year, in 1964; selected as a fellow in the Texas State Historical Association, 1964; Regents Professor, 1972; Phi Kappa Phi Award for Distinguished Teaching; Fellow, East Texas Historical Association, 1983; Ralph W. Steen Award, East Texas Historical Association, 1989; and Otis Locke Teaching Award, East Texas Historical Association.\n\nDr. Wooster was a leader at Lamar and in the historical community. He was president of Lamar’s Faculty Senate and president of the local chapter of TACT (Texas Association of College Teachers), president of the Texas State Historical Association, and president of the East Texas Historical Association.\n\nHe became a Lamar administrator in 1976 but continued to teach and research. As an administrator he held increasingly responsible positions over time. Dean of Graduate Studies, 1976-1977. Dean of Faculties and Graduate Studies, 1977-1980. Dean of Faculties and Assistant to Vice President for Academic Affairs, 1980-1984; Assistant Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of Faculties, 1984-1986; Associate Vice President and Dean of Faculties, 1986-1991; and Interim Executive Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs, 1989-1990.\n\nHe retired from work as an administrator in 1991 but continued teaching on a part-time basis until 2006.\n\nDr. Ralph Wooster married Edna Lee Jones in 1947 when she was 19 and Wooster was 18. They have one son, Robert Allen Wooster, who was named for Robert E. Lee. The younger Wooster is a prolific historian who teaches at Texas A&M University, Corpus Christi.\n\nFor more information on Ralph Wooster, please consult “Ralph A.
