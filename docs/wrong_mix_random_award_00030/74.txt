Tennessee Williams

Born Thomas Lanier Williams III in Mississippi, the playwright Tennessee Williams became instantly famous at thirty-three after the premiere of his play The Glass Menagerie. His other plays, for which he won two Pulitzers and a Tony Award, include A Streetcar Named Desire, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Sweet Bird of Youth, Suddenly Last Summer, and The Night of the Iguana. He was found dead in a Manhattan hotel at age seventy-one after reportedly choking on the cap for a nasal spray or eye drop bottle. He noted in his will that he wanted to be buried at sea near the spot where poet Hart Crane jumped off a boat and disappeared; his brother instead buried him in Missouri.
