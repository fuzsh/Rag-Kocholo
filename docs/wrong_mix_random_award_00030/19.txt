The William Lemar/Lamar (original spelling was Lemar) who went to Anderson County, TN was born in about 1768 in Augusta County, VA (probably a part that became Rockingham County).His father was also a William Lemar who was accused of desertion from his duties in the Revolution in 1777 but found to be very ill and died a short time later.He was dead by August 24, 1778, when his estate was set for administration (no will) in Rockingham County.The elder William Lemar was married twice and we are still trying to identify his first wife.His second wife was Hannah ____ (surname unknown).His first wife may have been half or all Native American, because one of the brothers of William went west on the Trail of Tears to Oklahoma and is on a roster of Native Americans.In Nodaway County, Missouri, the Lamar Wallaces were called the "Black Wallaces" or "Dark Wallaces" because the earliest Lemar/Lamar settlers there (1842) claimed they were part Native American.Not all Lemars/Lamars were dark.Amanda Caroline Lemar, my ancestress who married Joseph Franklin Miller Wallace Jr., was blonde.

On the tax lists for Botetourt County, VA, were the following brothers and sisters: William Lemare first appears in 1785 and then again in 1790.His mother, the widow Hannah Lemare is listed in 1785 and 1790.He does not appear to have been "of age" 1785, but he was the oldest male in the household and tithable, indicating he was at least 16 years of age.Between 1778-1785, there are no records of this family in Rockbridge or Botetourt Counties, but a Hannah Lemare, widow, was in Berkeley County in 1782.However they returned to Botetourt, which was carved from Rockbridge by 1785.This suggests the children were all seriously under-age when William Lemare died in 1778, and she temporarily, for the rest of the Revolution at least, moved to where she had some relatives to help raise and protect the children.However, the family continued to own the land which had to go to the oldest son, who seems to have been able to manage it by 1785.In 1791, James Lemar and Christian Lemar were of age to be taxed.In 1797, John Lemar (who later went to Oklahoma) first appeared on the tax records.There is no will record, only a few administration records in Botetourt and Rockingham Counties in 1778.William Seavers, father of Polly Seavers also appeared on the Botetourt County, VA tax lists, from 1786-1801.By 1795, he had 3 males over the age of 16 in his household.

According to Donnis Borcher (a descendant of James Lemar and Elizabeth Seavers/Severs.James Lamar, the second known son of William Lemar who died in 1778,was born March 17,1772.Although he was a tithable in 1791, he apparently was not quite of age.He married Elizabeth Severs in Botetourt County, VA March 18, 1796.James and Elizabeth (Seavers/Severs) Lemar/Lamar had the following children: William b. January 21, 1797; Thomas b. 1802; Catherine b. April 8, 1806; Anne b. February 7, 1809; Henry b. February 25, 1813; James b. 1815; John b. Octobr 29, 1819;I have marriage names and dates also if you need them.Many of this Lamar family are buried in Bryant Cemetery in Belton, Cass County, MO.James and Elizabeth (Seavers) Lemar/Lamar were the ancestors of the Lamar/Lemar family of Jefferson County, Tennessee. Donnis Borchers wrote the book _ Thomas Lamar, The Immigrant_ and contributed to Ruth Lamar Petracek's book _The Lamar Legacy_, which I have.I believe both Mrs. Borchers, as well as Ruth Lamar Petracek are now deceased.Ruth died in 2003.

William Lemar (VA to TN), based on the date of his first marriage record and the 1830 census record was born just before 1770.(About 1768, it looks like.)This means he was probably a tithable under his widowed stepmother's household tax record in Botetourt in 1785.He married Rosannah Mills, a daughter of John and Mary Mills in Botetourt County, VA, August 19, 1796.

From a letter written by Joseph Blagg Lamar, son of William to a Longmire relative:"Father first married Rosann Mills; then a Severs (Polly) and they had 8 children.All of them are dead but Jack and myself. ... Aunt Betty was father's half sister..I can't tell you who your grandparents were but your mother was a Blagg.I was named for Joseph Blagg."Joseph Blagg Lemar/Lamar was a child of William (the younger) by his second wife: Polly Severs/Seavers.This indicates Polly's mother was a Blagg by birth surname.

William (the younger) Lemar had a half-sister named Jane who married A. P. Sprucehead October 17, 1796 in Botetourt County. Another record indicates William (the younger) had a second half sister named Sarah who married William Mills--a brother of Rosannah Mills, May 20, 1788 in Botetourt County, VA.Another possible sister or half sister is Annie (Anne) Wheeler who is mentioned in an 1818 deposition of William Mills on behalf of William Lemar, as another Lemar.(Lawsuit of John McIntire, second husband of Mary Mills over slaves left to his stepchildren by their biological father, Captain John Mills (died 1780--John Mills Jr. son, executor of his estate).The Mills were at one time, Quakers and members of the Lost Creeking Meeting House in Anderson County.It is believed that Hannah Lemar/Lamar had once also been a Quaker, and possibly from Frederick County, VA.

The children of William (the younger) Lemar and Rosannah Mills were: William Lemar Jr. b. May 23, 1797--died young; Mary b. December 16, 1798, md. Elijah Adkins Jr.; James b. December 5, 1800, md. Elizabeth Kirby; Jane b. 1802 md. Wallace Dew; John Mills Lemar/Lamar b. July 6, 1804, md. Hannah Smith, then Susannah Spencer; Charles Mills Lemar/Lamar b. October 9, 1806, md. Rhoda Ross (my ancestral line).Rosannah Mills Lemar did not recover from the birth of her last child and died in Anderson County, TN, December 6, 1807.

The children of William (the younger)Lemar and Polly (Mary) Seavers (his second wife) whom he married in 1811 or 1812 were: Charlotte b. November 13, 1813--died young; Hugh Barton Lamar b. August 11, 1815 md. Abigail Margrave; Thomas Jefferson Lamar b. April 14, 1816 md. Elminia Hart; Joseph Blagg Lamar b. December 20, 1818, md. Nancy Wallace; Ann E. Lamar b. November 21, 1820 md. Crockett Wade; Andrew Jackson Lamar b. August 25, 1822 md. 1st unknown, 2nd Phoebe Chapman; Catherine Lamar b. April 4, 1824, md. James Davis; and Wiley Blount Lamar b. September 26, 1826, md. Rutha Havens.

William Lemar/Lamar (the younger) died in Anderson County, Tennessee on October 10, 1830.

Some of this data is from Ruth Longmire's family Bible (Anderson County, TN).

It is not known who William Lemar's father was (the elder William).There are a couple of possibilities.One possibility is Gallant Lemar II, who went to North Carolina with sons just before the Revolution.He came from the border area of Virginia and Maryland originally.Gallant Lemar II had a son named James according to some records and it is not known how many sons Gallant Lemar II had (unless someone now has more up-to-date information on this line).However, Gallant Lemar II may have been a BROTHER of William because Gallant Lemar I who married Mary Wheeler in Maryland September 27, 1733, a possible father of Gallant Lemar II was still alive and active in Dorchester County, Maryland as late as 1758--and inherited the plantation of James Broadaway by his will that same year.

A second possiblity, that Donnis Borchers believed was more likely was James Lemar, a younger son of Thomas Lemar whose will was proved in Prince George's County, Maryland 31 January, 1748.In that will, James, a younger son, is of age and inherited from his father part of a tract of land called "Two Brothers," aka "Joseph and James."Two older brothers: Robert and Thomas Jr. got larger pieces of the tract: 100 and 200 Acres respectively, and a third brother, John got a "remainder" of this tract and part of another that included another property of brother Thomas referred as "the Marsh."For James--and John, these odd bits and pieces were not great prospects for raising families of their own.James additionally had a brother-in-law named William Williams--and another named Clementious DAVIS.

However, a last, intriguing possibility, is William Bishop Lemar, son of John Lemar Jr., whose will was proved March 24, 1757.This is the only Lemar will that has thus far been found with a William Lemar in it.John Lemar Jr. left a wife SARAH; and sons: William Bishop Lemar (the oldest son); Mark, Jacob, Rebecca, Susannah, and John (III).The will was witnessed by Robert Lamar (a brother of John Jr.--as per their father's will).The problem with this is except for the names William and John, and wife Sarah, they don't line up with William Lemar of VA-TN.Sarah Lemar for William, is also his HALF sister and could have been named for Hannah's mother.William's next older brother is James, not John, in the naming tradition position of William the younger's grandfather.

By the way, Thomas Lemar "Sr." and John Lemar Sr. were brothers and actually sons of Thomas Lemar/Lemare Sr. (Thomas Sr.'s will was proved in Prince George's County, Maryland in 1714 and named both sons.)

Prince George's County, Maryland is right across the Potomac River from Fairfax County, Virginia--and two counties away from Frederick County, VA (originally just one county).Berkeley County, now West Virginia but originally Virginia was carved from Frederick County, VA in 1772.

Additional proof that James Lemaire/Lemare/Lemar was the probable father of William is found in early Kentucky records.A James Lemaire and his brother John Lemaire acquired land on Beech Fork (1,000 acres for James and 400 acres for John) on June 26 and September 29, 1780, respectively. (Land records of Lincoln and Jefferson Counties, KY.)Nothing more has been found of them, suggesting they may have retreated further east since the Revolution was still going on and this was an area hard hit--repeatedly--by Shawnee, strong allies of the British. Going from bits and piece--including part of a marsh--to the less than tender mercies of the Shawnee and British on the frontier, suggests going from frying pan to fire--and in the case of the Shawnee that could be literal.I can understand why James might not have stayed in Kentucky at the time and retreated eastward.

Now forreal kick, James and John appear to have had a younger brother or nephew named Charles, born in Berkeley County, VA in April, 1776--d. February 15, 1867 aged 90 years and 10 mos. who went to Ohio with his widowed mother born about 17__--d. 183__ (tombstone not completely legible when last seen in the 1970's), named "Hannah."Charles and his mother are buried in the Sharon Methodist Churchyard in Clinton County, OHIO.Oddly, although his wife and mother are buried adjacent to him, Charles had no children buried near him--but GRAND-children.Hannah, Charles' mother was a Quaker--she's also in the Centre Meeting House Records for Clinton County.Apparently, her children, as quite a surprising number of Quakers did, became Methodists in that part of Ohio.I have Kirks and Maples who did exactly the same thing at about the same time not far from this area.Some of Charles' children are buried in the Burlington Cemetery in Clinton County, Ohio, notably son Samuel d. 1-2-1898 aged 85 years 1 day (born January 1, 1813). and a son John L. Lamar b. December 25, 1825--d. December 31, 1901.Charles Lemar/Lamar was married twice.His wife Elizabeth buried next to him in the Sharon Cemetery was his first wife and she died December 31, 1812, aged 35 (one transcriber had 55 but that would have made her 20 years older than her husband--who was listed as husband, so she was most likely aged 35--and thus born in 1777.)

Charles Lemar/Lamar of Berkeley County, had a mother named Mary--who died in Rockingham County, Virginia in 1820, intestate.Charles was named administrator of her estate, December 19, 1820.This would be logical if her other sons were dead.By the way, administration of the estate of William Lemar Sr. in the same county in 1778 was eventually granted to JAMES Blair, who might have been a relative.

I hope this helps someone.I have additional materials, such as the rest of the Clinton County cemetery records I found at the Historical Society there one trip long ago., and of course the rest of the data in Ruth Lamar Petracek's book, and a few additional notes of my own addition research.I also have a description of the original Lemaire coat of arms as it was in Normandy France when they were giving fits to the Kings of France by allying themselve with the very Protestant kings of Navarre...
