Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge, or Knowing Me, Knowing You (sometimes abbreviated to KMKYWAP and occasionally referred to as The Alan Partridge Show), is a spoof chat show hosted by Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge. It was a TV adaptation of the radio series of the same name.

Synposis[]

"Aiming to 'quite literally put the chat amongst the pigeons', Alan took on prime time TV - and lost, badly. As chat show host he is brash, cheesy and uncompromisingly narrow-minded. Forced into crude clown groups, risque men's dance troupes and fashion designers, he is obnoxious and downright rude. As only Partridge can, he humiliates, infuriates, assaults and even kills his guests - but as always, ends his show like a true professional... 'On that bombshell...'" (BBC Studios)

Format[]

Knowing Me, Knowing You followed a standard chat show format, where guests (see list) were invited onto the programme to discuss their life and work with the host. Each show typically had four main guests, as well as some kind of live performance or event. Show 4 was ostensibly set in Paris. Episodes began with Partridge shouting "A-ha!" and cracking a couple of jokes, before having a short discussion with musical director Glenn Ponder. This opening segment saw the first use of the greeting "Knowing Me, Alan Partridge, Knowing You[...] A-ha" which was used religiously throughout the series. Other segments included "Alan's Big Pocket" (relegated to show 3 only), and "Another Alan Partridge", where someone who shared Alan's name was invited onto the programme. A one-off hustings for the West Chalfont by-election in show 5 was titled "Partridge Over Britian".

Guests on the show were gifted Alan Partridge Tie and Blazer Badge Combination Packs and, in show 6, Alan Partridge masks. These products did not prove particularly popular with guests.

The set of Knowing Me, Knowing You was deisgned to mimic a "top international hotel". A chair, sofa and table were positioned centre-stage, behind which could be found various pieces of set dressing including a fountain, foliage, and a hot tub. The set had two entrances, one for the host (underneath a stage for Ponder and the house band), and one for the guests. There was one additional room, off stage right, which appeared only in show 1.
