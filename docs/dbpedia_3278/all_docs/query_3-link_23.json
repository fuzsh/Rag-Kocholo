        "text": "Hello (First time poster, first time browser).\n\nI've posted this elsewhere without any success.\n\nI was talking to some of the younger ones in here about KMKYWAP the other day (wasting my time really) and I said that many of the segments/interviews are 'inspired' by actual chat show events and genuine TV moments.\n\nI remember as a lad watching 3-2-1 and a guy came on with an ostrich puppet. He then did a 3 minute routine which involved him just laughing basically.\n\nIt was terrible. At the table Ted asked him some questions like what the puppet's name was \"I don't know, I only bought it today\" the guy said. I'm sure he also admitted that he made the act up in the taxi and so on.\n\nIt HAS to be the inspiration for Cheeky Monkey and Joe Beesley and even if it isn't it's still a great piece of British telly.\n\nI know it's very obscure (the people at CaB couldn't help) but does anyone else remember seeing this?\n\nI have to see it again.\n\nI meant in and around me here in work where I often feel the tidal wave of age washing over me when I talk about things that happened more than six months ago.\n\nBlank faces stare back at me while I become increasingly frustrated by the 'If it wasn't on Celebrity Juice I haven't seen it' mentality.\n\nYou try explaining the concept of 3-2-1 to a 20 year old.\n\nAnd, yeah - hello to you too."
