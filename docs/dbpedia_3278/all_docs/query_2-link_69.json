        "text": "He's one of comic actor Steve Coogan's most enduring characters, yet the socially inept, politically incorrect Norwich broadcaster Alan Partridge pops up only every few years.\n\nCreated by Coogan in the mid-'90s when he was working with Armando Iannucci and Chris Morris on BBC Radio 4, Partridge first appeared as a sports presenter on their program The Day Today before gaining cult status hosting his own fictional chat show, Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge, followed by a spin-off, I'm Alan Partridge.\n\nCoogan occasionally revived Partridge for stand-up tours, but since the second series of I'm Alan Partridge in 2002, and some one-off specials aside, Partridge has been ''resting\" for some time.\n\nNow Alan has achieved big-screen glory Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa. Reviving a TV character for a feature film is always a risky venture, but the film has been a huge success in Britain - and it's Partridge's absences, says Coogan, that have assured this success and the character's longevity.\n\n''It is amazing he's lasted 22 years but we've only returned to him when we've felt creatively that we want to. With Alan, we did a little bit - then stopped from 2001-2009, so that was an eight-year gap where we didn't do anything with him. We went off and did other things.''\n\nFor Coogan, that was a string of film roles - among them 24 Hour Party People, Tropic Thunder, Tristram Shandy and his recent television series with Rob Brydon, The Trip. But people were always asking about Alan.\n\n''So I called Armando [Iannucci] and said let's do a film!'' Coogan says on the phone from Britain.\n\nThe next challenge was translating Partridge's world, confined to regional England, to the big screen.\n\n''We thought it'd be wrong to do something Hollywood - you have to sort of do something that uses his world which is sort of a myopic little Englander, but also we thought if we did something that was very pedestrian, it wouldn't have been very cinematic - you need to do something that justified it being a film, as it were, by having an event take place.''\n\nCoogan says they tried to marry an ''expansiveness'' with Alan's parochial world.\n\n''So we don't go to London, we don't go to New York, or anything like that - we kept it in its locale, which was important to give it that feel of a small world,'' he says.\n\nWe catch up with Alan at North Norfolk Digital Radio, where he has settled into a role presenting the graveyard shift, when a corporate takeover threatens his gig. Eager to keep it, Alan, in typical form, happily suggests his long-time colleague Pat should get the boot. Things go awry when Pat returns, armed, to hold the station's staff hostage, Dog Day Afternoon style. Believing they're still mates, Pat will only negotiate through Alan, who finds a perverse pleasure in the ''fame'' the situation brings him.\n\nIt's sort of a very low-rent \"Die Hard\".\n\nIt is, almost, an action film. Of sorts.\n\n''I'm not sure it is that much of an action film … there's a lot of talking in it,'' Coogan says, laughing. ''It's sort of a very low-rent Die Hard I suppose.''\n\nAlan hasn't quite reached action-hero status, but he has, says Coogan, evolved somewhat.\n\n''From a creative point of view, the character's become more refined - we've made him less caricatured, if you like, because for film, if he was too pantomime-like - on the sitcom I perform him in a slightly bigger way, but on screen, that could start to wear after 90 minutes. So we had to make him sort of more … real,'' explains Coogan.\n\n''But the character of Alan as a person has changed as well. He had to change with the times - he's 20 years older, so he's got different priorities. he's not quite as ambitious as he was, he's settled into comfortable middle-age, doing a comfortable show where he's quite … resolved into that way of life, minding his own business as it were, when the event happens.\n\n''He's become slightly more liberal. He's a conservative middle Englander - with a small and a big C - but I think in the same way that David Cameron endorses gay marriage, Alan's trying to be 'modern', as it were.''\n\nAnd, of course, largely failing. Which is part of his uncomfortable charm.\n\n''Of course, he still commits faux pas and says thing that are inappropriate, but the audience need to feel some sort of empathy for him. I remember early on in the writing of Alan, about 15 years ago, I would get a little defensive about him with the other writers if I thought they were too cruel. I didn't like them to have people just laughing at him, and having no sympathy for him at all.\n\n''To me it's much more interesting, although he's sort of a grotesque creation, to have an element of humanity … not only to make the character more interesting, but to make the film sustain itself. You can't have a grotesque character for 90 minutes. The audience may laugh at his inappropriateness but they need to sometimes think 'there but for the grace of God go I' - that's important.''\n\nAustralian audiences might be divided into which category Alan's love of John Farnham's You're the Voice, which features in a key scene, falls.\n\n''It's both slightly portentous and a bit grand, but then it's also very melodic and you can't help but sing along with it. Also it's from the '80s and it's got sort of Alan's taste to it as well. It was a hit here, but it's also slightly forgotten. We thought that would be a great song to sing, and the lyrics slightly reflect where Alan and Pat are in the film at that point,'' he says, before admitting, Partridge-style: ''It's a guilty pleasure that song, too.''\n\nAlan Partridge: Alpha Papa\n\nGenre Comedy\n\nBuzz Critically acclaimed as a fine outing for Partridge, backed by a clever plot\n\nStars Steve Coogan, Colm Meaney\n\nDirector Declan Lowney\n\nRated M\n\nRelease Out now\n\nWho is Alan Partridge?\n\nSteve Coogan originally based Alan on ''the slightly banal commentaries you get on sports programs from sports presenters'' who don't like to leave gaps in the commentary.\n\n''That's a dangerous situation to be in, because it means you have to speak, even if you're not quite sure what you're saying,'' he says. ''So inevitably it leads to people saying slightly silly things.''\n\nAlan began his career as a DJ on Radio Smile hospital radio, until he had to leave for arguing with patients. He then presented the drive-time program on Radio Norwich.\n\nHe worked his way up to a role as a sports reporter on BBC Radio, where he became famous for his lack of sporting knowledge and his talent for mixed or just plain unintelligible metaphors.\n\nHe made the transition to TV, and hosted a chat show, Knowing Me, Knowing You, during which time he accidentally shot a guest on live TV and punched a paraplegic, among other lowlights."
