        "text": "Episode 7\n\nJeremy and the Stig race two Caterham 7s around a circuit in Scotland, but Jeremy needs to build his own car from scratch first. Richard and James road-test the Ford S-max, the Mercedes B200 turbo and the Vauxhall Zafira VXR - three family cars that promise a bit of excitement. Plus comedian Steve Coogan is the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car.\n\nCaravan Conkers\n\nRichard heads for the south of France, via the Alps, in the Pagani Zonda roadster, Top Gear gets its hands on steel cable and cranes for a fun filled game of caravan conkers and there's a clash of titans on the test track.\n\nBunch of Marys\n\nMartinâs mother Debra is keeping busy hitting the campaign trail to support Mary Robinsonâs bid for the Irish presidency. A neglected Martin soon tires of his sisterâs cooking and befriends new boy Trevor whose chef-parents feed the boys like kings.\n\nA Tale of Two Dentists\n\nUnexpectedly, a new young dentist, Dr. Stanway, opens up a swanky new practice across the street from Bob. Bob panics and threatens a dental fight to the last root canal; until Dr. Stanway pops over for a friendly visit."
