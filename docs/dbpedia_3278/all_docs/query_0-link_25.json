        "text": "Radio 4 Extra celebrates Steve Cooganâ€™s career as one of the most successful and influential British comedians, actors and writers. From Spitting Image voice artist to Academy Award nominee, his various talents have delighted audiences down the years. Here is a selection of some of Steve's memorable performances.\n\nA Word in Your Era, 1992\n\nSteve performing with Steve Steen and Helen Atkinson in an early TV appearance. 'A Word In Your Era' was a comedy panel show in which comedians and actors were asked to become their favourite character from history and explain why they deserved to be immortal.\n\nThe Day Today, 1994\n\nSteve with fellow co-stars of the surreal news parody created by Armando Iannucci and Chris Morris. Steve played a variety of characters in the current affairs spoof including the one which would go on to make him a household name, Alan Partridge.\n\nKnowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge, 1994\n\nWithout a doubt, Alan Partridge is Steve's most recognisable and enduring character. Alan first appeared in the Radio 4 spoof current affairs programme 'On The Hour' as the show's sports correspondent. Alan soon returned to the Radio 4 schedule with the spin-off spoof chat show 'Knowing Me, Knowing You', which was then adapted for television in 1994. Steve has kept Partridge fans satisfied ever since with a variety of TV shows, a spoof autobiography and even a feature length movie, 'Alpha Papa', which hit the big screens in 2013.\n\nPaul Calf's Video Diary, 1994\n\nSteve in costume as Mancunian siblings Paul and Pauline Calf. In this spoof video diary Steve played the offensive drunk Paul Calf and his sister Pauline in a tale of love and lager. Paul originally came to life as part of Steve's stand-up routine and came to the wider public's attention with appearances on 'Saturday Zoo', a late-night Channel 4 variety show hosted by Jonathan Ross.\n\nCoogan's Run, 1995\n\nIn 'Coogan's Run' Steve played a variety of oddball characters living in the fictional town of Ottle. This picture is taken from the final episode in which Steve plays Tim Fleck, the curator of a very dull museum under threat of being turned into a steak house.\n\nThe Tony Ferrino Phenomenon, 1997\n\nTony Ferrino is \"the biggest star to work in Portugal's entertainment industry. He is also widely adored across Brazil and in Iraq.\" Coogan developed the Ferrino character for a one off BBC Two special, which was accompanied by a spoof documentary about Ferrino's life. Ferrino also released an album and single to accompany the series. The single was a cover of Tom Jones' 'Help Yourself', which included 'Bigamy at Christmas' as the B side.\n\nRobbie The Reindeer, 1999\n\nSteve gave a fine example of his versatility when he voiced the part of Blitzen the reindeer in two animated Christmas specials following the exploits of Robbie the reindeer, son of Rudolph. Steve is well known for his voice work, beginning his career as an impersonator on the satirical puppet show 'Spitting Image'. He has returned to voice work on TV and in films throughout his career, most recently in the hugely successful 'Despicable Me' franchise.\n\nDr Terrible's House of Horror, 2001\n\nA comedy-horror series created by Graham Duff. Graham and Steve co-wrote the series which affectionately parodied British horror movies made by production companies like Amicus and Hammer. Steve introduced each episode as Dr Terrible and played a variety of roles throughout the series.\n\nThe Private Life of Samuel Pepys, 2003\n\nLou Doillon and Steve Coogan in costume as their characters Elizabeth Pepys and Samuel Pepys respectively. Steve played the naval strategist and serial adulterer in a darkly comic vision of the man behind the famous diaries.\n\nI Am Not an Animal, 2004\n\nIn this animated comedy series created by Peter Baynham, Coogan again illustrated his vocal prowess by voicing the characters of Philip the horse and Mark Andrews the sparrow. The series followed the only six talking animals in the world, whose cosseted existence in a vivisection unit is turned upside down when they are liberated by animal rights activists.\n\nSaxondale, 2006\n\nTommy Saxondale, the Stevenage based pest controller with anger management issues. Steve Coogan said: \"The joke with Partridge was always at Alan's expense, whereas Tom is genuinely witty... whilst still being a bit of a dick\".\n\nThe Trip, 2010 & 2014\n\nSteve with his friend and occasional collaborator Rob Brydon. Steve and Rob play fictionalised versions of themselves taking on the challenging task of reviewing restaurants across northern England and Italy. Both series were directed by Michael Winterbottom, whom Steve had worked with in the past on feature films '24 Hour Party People' and 'A Cock and Bull Story'."
