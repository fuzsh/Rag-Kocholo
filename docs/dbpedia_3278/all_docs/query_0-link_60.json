        "text": "WHEN “Saxondale,” the comedian Steve Coogan’s first television series in four years, had its premiere on the BBC in June, the British press was nearly unanimous in praising the originality of the show: a finely tuned comic portrait of a former rock roadie named Tommy Saxondale (played by Mr. Coogan) coming to terms with the fact that he and his generation of baby boomers are indeed growing old.\n\nAnd when these same publications expressed their few reservations with “Saxondale” (which makes its stateside debut Oct. 13 on BBC America), they were just as consistent in invoking a name that has stuck to Mr. Coogan like a piece of discarded chewing gum: Alan Partridge.\n\nAs British viewers know well, Alan Partridge is the bumbling, unctuous talk show host that Mr. Coogan, 40, has portrayed over a period of 15 years, in two BBC comedy series, on radio shows and in live performances. The success that Mr. Coogan has enjoyed in Britain, stemming primarily from his convincing embodiment of the ingratiating Partridge, has propelled him onto a global stage, in a steady supply of television shows and movies (including Sofia Coppola’s film “Marie Antoinette,” which opens later this month).\n\nYet for Mr. Coogan, his alter ego has been both a springboard and a hurdle, a role that he has become so closely associated with that obsessive, eagle-eyed comedy fans seem to find elements of it in all of Mr. Coogan’s work. As he remarked in a recent telephone interview, “When people go, ‘Oh, I saw Steve Coogan do this thing, and it’s a little bit like Alan Partridge,’ what I have to say is: ‘No, that’s not Alan Partridge. That’s me. I came first.’ ”\n\nAfter emerging from the Manchester comedy scene in the 1980’s, Mr. Coogan created Alan Partridge for a BBC Radio news satire called “On The Hour,” envisioning the character as a send-up of British sports correspondents. “They have a kind of confidence that doesn’t tally with their intelligence,” he said. “I liked the idea of someone who loved the camera, liked to say things with authority, and had a well-modulated voice, but was more style than substance — and not much style, either.”\n\nIn 1994 Partridge was made the host of his own BBC television talk show parody, “Knowing Me, Knowing You With Alan Partridge,” and given ample room to be the architect of his own demise. Over six episodes he faced off against a roster of equally obnoxious guests, played with venomous glee by emerging talents likes the actress Minnie Driver and the playwright Patrick Marber; his first show began with a horse defiling his stage, and his finale ended with him accidentally shooting a guest with an antique dueling pistol.\n\n“Knowing Me, Knowing You” was a hit, but when Mr. Coogan returned to British television three years later, it was in a radically different format: “I’m Alan Partridge” was a sitcom that gave the character a fully realized (if depressing) life outside the studio, one in which his talk show had been canceled, his wife had left him, and he was now living in a motel near Cambridge. While the trajectory of “I’m Alan Partridge” (which has its first season DVD release on Oct. 24) placed its protagonist in a series of increasingly pathetic scenarios — struggling to tell his production staff that they’ve been fired; stalking a BBC executive at a funeral — there was a faint undercurrent of humanity to the show, in Partridge’s obliviousness to his gradual ruination, and his refusal to accept his overwhelming mediocrity.\n\n“You’ve got to give him some little, tiny moments of salvation, because otherwise it’s like pulling the legs off an insect,” Mr. Coogan said. “However much we laugh at him, I would sometimes want to defend him. He may be a jerk, but there’s a lot of other jerks in the world too.”\n\nIn recent years Mr. Coogan has enjoyed acclaim in Michael Winterbottom’s films “24 Hour Party People” (in which he played a stylized version of the rock music impresario Tony Wilson) and “Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story” (in which he played, among other roles, a comedian named Steve Coogan, who is constantly berated for portraying a character called Alan Partridge). But he was distracted from his own writing, and dissatisfied with the projects being offered to him. “I was looking around, going, ‘Will someone please give me an interesting job?’ ” Mr. Coogan said. “And a lot of people said, ‘No, but here’s some uninteresting work we might let you do.’ ”\n\nSo Mr. Coogan returned to the BBC, where he and the writer Neil MacLennan created “Saxondale,” a subtler shift away from the caustic tone of the “Alan Partridge” shows. The new series follows Tommy as he works as an exterminator, intermittently attends anger management therapy and stands in for a generation of disenchanted British 50-somethings. “They want to live in a comfort bubble of unreconstructed rock ’n’ roll, where men are men and women are scared,” Mr. Coogan explained. “When Tony Blair carried an electric guitar into Downing Street, the party was over.”\n\nThough the character wasn’t consciously designed to be the antithesis of Alan Partridge, Mr. Coogan said there were crucial thematic differences between “Saxondale” and his previous shows. “I wanted to do a comedy series that wasn’t cynical about being human,” he said. “I wanted to do a comedy that would have some love in it, and not be all about acrimony and discord.”\n\nHenry Normal, an executive producer on “Saxondale” and a longtime collaborator of Mr. Coogan’s, said that in this respect, the show had been heavily influenced by American sitcoms, whose protagonists tend to be more satisfied with their lives than their British counterparts. “Take the example of ‘Cheers,’ ” Mr. Normal said. “There’s a man that was a big sports star, now he runs a bar, but actually he’s comfortable with himself. Tommy Saxondale is a man that’s had glory days, but he’s essentially happy.”\n\nBut have television audiences finally accepted the idea of Mr. Coogan writing and performing comedy for characters other than failed talk-show hosts named Alan Partridge? “Your question betrays the answer,” Mr. Normal said with a laugh. “Obviously they haven’t, because we’re having to discuss it. But I’m sure people are sophisticated enough to hold two images in their head.”\n\nMr. Coogan, who now splits his time between Britain and America, where he has a deal to develop his BBC shows for NBC, said he had largely come to terms with his most recognizable creation, and was still tinkering with the idea of writing a movie based on the character. “He’s like an old friend who’s annoying,” he said. “At some point you still want to see them again, until they annoy you, and then you can say goodbye.”\n\nStill, Mr. Coogan said he was enjoying his part-time existence in Los Angeles, where he is recognized for playing Tony Wilson as often as he is for Alan Partridge, and then only in hip, independent music stores. “If I’m feeling like I’m not being validated, or insignificant in Hollywood, all I do is just take a trip to Amoeba Records and get my ego massaged,” he said. “Then I step back into anonymity when I walk out the door.”"
