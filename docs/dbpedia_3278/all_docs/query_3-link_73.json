        "text": "Steve Coogan's legendary comic creation has been around in one form or another since 1991.\n\nPartridge was created for the BBC Radio 4 comedy programme On The Hour, a spoof of British current affairs broadcasting, as the show's hapless sports presenter.\n\nOn the Hour transferred to television as The Day Today, in which Partridge reprised his role as sports reporter.\n\nPartridge presented six episodes of a spoof Radio 4 chat show, Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge, before that transferred to television.\n\nHe then returned in the sitcom I'm Alan Partridge.\n\nHow old is Alan Partridge?\n\nThere are very few references to Partridge's actual age.\n\nHowever, in the 2002 series I'm Alan Partridge during the episode 'The Talented Mr Alan', Partridge tells his former schoolmate: \"I’m 47. My girlfriend's 33. She's 14 years younger than me. Back of the net!\"\n\nIf we do some maths then that was 17 years ago, which would make him around 63 or 64 now.\n\nThis tallies with a fan website which has Partridge born on April 2, 1955.\n\nBut he's definitely been at the Just For Men, judging on the colour of his hair for the new series This Time.\n\nHow old is Steve Coogan?\n\nSteve Coogan is a lot easier to age than his character Alan Partridge.\n\nHe was born 14 October 1965, which makes him 53-years-old."
