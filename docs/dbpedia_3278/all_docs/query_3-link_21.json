Portrayed by Steve Coogan, and co-created by a number of comedic individuals, including Coogan and Armando Iannucci, the character began in a supporting role on The Day Today before moving on to Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge, I’m Alan Partridge and Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge. Despite these shows and numerous appearances on other shows, however, the character has yet to make the jump to the big screen, something that is set to change with Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa. Coogan reprises his role, joined by Colm Meaney, Sean Pertwee, Monica Dolan, and Simon Delaney. The first trailer for the feature has now been released, and can be seen below.\n\n(Source: First Showing)\n\nThe post ‘Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa’, the first movie featuring the popular Steve Coogan character, releases a...\n\n\"It's started!\"\n\nWhile not as popular here as he is in the United Kingdom, actor Steve Coogan first portrayed the character of Alan Partridge in the the early 1990s on the BBC Radio news parody On The Hour as an absurdly ineffectual sports reporter, eventually moving on to host parody talk show Knowing Me, Knowing You and his own two seasons of the sitcom I'm Alan Partridge. While Coogan has found more success in the States in movies like Tropic Thunder and Our Idiot Brother, the British actor has continued to find time to play the arrogant and narcissistic Partridge, most recently in a webseries titled Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge, which showed Alan hosting a radio show for North Norfolk Digital. An Alan Partridge movie featuring the character has been teased for many years, and it looks like it will finally arrive this summer, though what it will...\n\nSneak Peek the first teaser trailer from the upcoming British comedy feature, \"The Alan Partridge Movie\", aka \"Alan Partridge Is In Alpha Papa\", based on fictional radio/television presenter 'Alan Partridge'.\n\nThe new film is produced by \"Partridge\" creator Armando Iannucci and directed by Declain Lowney, from a script by Steve Coogan, Armando Iannucci, Peter Baynham and Neil & Rob Gibbons, based on the web series, \"Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge\":\n\n\"...'Alan Partridge' has had many ups and downs in his life including being a national television broadcaster, responsible for killing a guest on live TV, a local radio broadcaster, a nervous breakdown in Dundee and his self-published book, 'Bouncing Back', subsequently remaindered and pulped.\n\n\"'Alan Partridge' portrays the events of the greatest low-to-high-ebb spectrum in his life to date, specifically how he tries to salvage his public career while negotiating a potentially violent turn of events at 'North Norfolk Digital Radio'."
