        "text": "The Day Today\n\nRan: 1 Series (1994)\n\nEpisodes: 6 Episodes\n\nFollowing the characters origins on radio, Alan first appeared as part of this comedy show as the sports presenter. Though short lived the show was enough of a launch pad that Alan would very quickly re-emerge later the same year in his own show.\n\nKnowing Me, Knowing You\n\nRan: 1 Series (1994-1995)\n\nEpisodes: 7 Episodes\n\nDelivered in the format of a spoof chat show, the Alan led series showcased Partridge's speciality of making any situation awkward. Interviewing guests, each played on Alan's failings and parodied well known real life interviews leading up to the infamous final moments that defined the character ever afterwards where he shot and killed a guest on air.\n\nI'm Alan Partridge\n\nRan: 2 Series (1997-2002)\n\nEpisodes: 12 Episodes\n\nFor many, these two series are Alan's defining moments. In the years following the on screen guest shooting, Alan's career is almost over bar a stint on Radio Norwich. Living from a Travel Inn following a failed marriage, he has only his assistant Lynn and the hotel staff for company. The second series moved Alan in with his new Ukranian girlfriend living on the building site of their new home as he made desperate attempts to revive his career. Responsible for a large number of fan favourite moments, the show also sowed the seeds for Alan's big screen moment.\n\nAlan Partridge: Welcome to the Places of my Life\n\nRan: 1 Special (2012)\n\nEpisodes: 1 Episode\n\nThis one off episode followed on a long time after the previous series and begins as a travelogue of Alan's life before descending into darker territory as Alan's personal demon's once again get the better of him.\n\nAlan Partridge: Alpha Papa\n\nRan: 1 Movie (2013)\n\nThe next year Alan returned in his hit big screen entry that saw him still living life as a Radio Norwich presenter but also finding a moment back in the spotlight as a hostage situation unfolds as the station giving Alan a moment to put himself back in the centre and potentially revive his failed career. The film was a success entirely on the basis of its low budget and appeal to UK audiences with the movie making £9.8m against a £4m budget but scoring immense critical praise.\n\nAlan Patridge's Scissored Isle\n\nRan: 1 Special (2016)\n\nEpisodes: 1 Episode\n\nAlan returned to screens with this special that saw him present a mockumentary on the North of England, exploring the divide between each end of the nation's classes.\n\nThis Time with Alan Partridge\n\nRan: 1 Series (2018)\n\nEpisodes: 6 Episodes\n\nAlan will finally return in series long form later this year with this new show that see's him finally reviving his TV career. The show see's Alan given the lifeline of co-presenting a weekly One Show style mid-week news story show. What could go wrong?\n\nShare your thoughts an memories of Alan's career! A-ha!"
