        "text": "British comedy series — you get in, you get out. I really do wish we had more than six episodes with this show, but if there’s any consolation, we have gotten plenty more (and some even better) Alan Partridge since then.\n\nThis is a fantastic show. I’ve never seen anything quite like this. It’s such compelling television, with a horrifically unprepared television host asking awkward questions to his guests and offending them, utilizing ill thought out segments to horrific effects. And just about everything that could go wrong in a chat show, does.\n\nBut Alan is the real showstealer here. He’s such a fully realized character, performed incredibly by Steve Coogan.\n\nEvery episode is great, and some are among the best half hours of comic television you’ll ever see.\n\nRating: 10/10"
