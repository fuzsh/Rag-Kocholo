        "text": "Alan Partridge is a fictional character portrayed by English comedian Steve Coogan. Two radio and four television series have presented this spoof television and radio presenter through his career - as well as several TV and radio specials, two books, a web series, plus appearances on the BBC's Comic Relief and a feature length film Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa.\n\nThe Day Today\n\n[edit]\n\nTwo fat ladies, 88! Not that you'd find these ladies at a bingo hall, of course... they're altogether a higher class of fat lady.\n\n(commenting on random clips of football/soccer matches in a build up to the upcoming 1994 FIFA World Cup): Shit! Did you see that!? He must have a foot like a traction engine. Striker! And that, was a gooooooal! The proof is in the pudding and in this case the pudding, is a football...\n\nRemember, lives matter.\n\nKnowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge\n\n[edit]\n\nCould someone clear that shit away, please? It's just, it's in my picture. People may associate it with me.\n\nLet me tell you something about the Titanic, people forget, people forget that on the Titanic's maiden voyage there were over 1000 miles of uneventful, very pleasurable cruising before it hit the iceberg!\n\nWell at this stage of the show, some of my viewers maybe thinking \"Alan, You're a liar! You promised that this show would be hot and now you're chatting to three senior citizens.\" But if I said I am now going to jump into a TARDIS, go back in time and recreate the Berlin Olympics with these three old women, you'd say \"Alan, that is hot, we were wrong earlier.\"\n\nYou join us live at the Berlin Olympics on \"Grandstand\" in 1936 on this pleasant summer morning in Nazi Germany. Everyone's here. Hitler's in his box, Jesse Owens just waved to him. He doesn't like that.\n\nYou're not ordinary, you're French!\n\nYou're sacked! You are sacked, I'm sacking you. In fact, it's happened, it's over, it's already happened, you are a sacked man. You've been sacked. You're the subject of a sacking, I want you off these premises in 10 minutes. Knowing me, Alan Partridge, sacking you, Glenn Ponder. A-ha!\n\nThroughout the questions I will be remaining impartial at all times. I will remain Pontius Partridge.\n\nMy face was designed as a leisure accessory.\n\nI'm Alan Partridge\n\n[edit]\n\nYou know what this room says to me? Aqua. Which is French for water. It's like being inside an enormous Fox's Glacier Mint, which again, to me, is a bonus.\n\nWould you like me to lap dance for you?\n\nA detective series based in Norwich called \"Swallow\". Swallow is a detective who tackles vandalism. Bit of a maverick, not afraid to break the law if he thinks it's necessary. He's not a criminal, you know, but he will, perhaps, travel 80mph on the motorway if, for example, he wants to get somewhere quickly...Think about it. No one had heard of Oxford before Inspector Morse.\n\nMonkey Tennis?\n\nmmmmm Ladyboys.\n\nSmell my cheese, you mother!\n\nThat was Big Yellow Taxi by Joni Mitchell, a song in which Joni complains they 'Paved paradise to put up a parking lot', a measure which actually would have alleviated traffic congestion on the outskirts of paradise, something which Joni singularly fails to point out, perhaps because it doesn't quite fit in with her blinkered view of the world. Nevertheless, nice song.\n\nLet battle commence!\n\n(talking to representative of a farming union): If you see a lovely field with a family having a picnic, and there's a nice pond in it, you fill in the pond with concrete, you plough the family into the field, you blow up the tree, and use the leaves to make a dress for your wife who's also your brother.\n\nJurassic Park!\n\nIâ€™m 47, my girlfriend's 33; she's 14 years younger than me: Back of the net!\n\nI've got a girlfriend, she's only 33. Cashback!\n\nBritain has some of the safest roads in Europe. But this isn't Britain...This is der Autobahn!\n\nRight, I'll tell you an anecdote. In 1974 I was catching the London train from Crewe station. It was very crowded; I found myself in a last-minute rush for the one remaining seat beside a tall, good-looking man with collar-length hair, it was the seventies; buckaroo! I looked up and saw it was none other than Peter Purves, it was the height of his Blue Peter career. He said, \"You jammy bastard\" and quick as a flash, I replied, \"Don't be blue, Peter!\" Needless to say, I had the last laugh, now fuck off!\n\nNot my words Carol, the words of Top Gear magazine!\n\nI can read you like a book, and not a very good book. Especially no Bravo Two Zero by Andy McNabb, which actually improves with every read.\n\nLynn! I've pierced my foot on a spike!\n\nMid Morning Matters\n\n[edit]\n\nI realised I had nothing to worry about. The man was a perfect gentleman. But if you told me 25 years ago that I would be talking about rigid inflatable hulls with Dale Winton I would probably have spat at you.\n\nBut not too informal; it's not Nigel Pinsent's \"In Depth\", but neither is it Wally Banter's Junk-Box\n\nAlan Partridge: Welcome to the Places of My Life\n\n[edit]\n\nKids like to go to the zoo but the beasts I like to look at are made of zinc galvanised steel - they're cars.\n\nAlpha Papa\n\n[edit]\n\nI would've taken it off sooner but I was having a fascinating conversation with the proud father of Norfolk's most sun-tanned child. Just passed his details on to the Social Services.\n\nLater we'll be taking dedications for anyone wrongly turned down for planning permission. Also, I'll be asking: Which is the worst monger? Fish, iron, rumour or war?\n\nNever, never criticise Muslims. Only Christians. And Jews a little bit.\n\nThat was soft rock cocaine enthusiasts, Fleetwood Mac.\n\nLynn, get rid of her. She's a drunk racist. I'll tolerate one, but not both.\n\nDo I look like I suffer from panic attacks? I've had one panic attack in a car wash. It was a perfect storm of no sleep, no wife, and angry brushes whirring towards me. By the time the giant hair dryer came on, I was in the footwell.\n\nLet's not get into who hit who or, you know, who may have deserved it.\n\nI'm not retreating, Pat's tugging me off.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, Neil Diamond will always be King of the Jews.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\n\"I'm Alan Partridge\" quotes from the BBC television series \"I'm Alan Partridge\" [1]\n\n\"On The Hour\" quotes from the BBC Radio 4 program \"On The Hour\" [2]\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nAlan Partridge.co.uk: Fan site with audio and video links.\n\nAlan Partridge Quotes, Every Ruddy One: Site with transcribed scripts from Series 1 & 2, Knowing Me, Knowing You and the Partrimilgrimage specials."
