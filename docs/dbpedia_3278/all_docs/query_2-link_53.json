        "text": "LONDON – The legion of British comedy fans of Steve Coogan‘s cult radio DJ creation Alan Partridge were delighted Friday after Henry Normal, co-founder of Baby Cow, Coogan’s production company, said a follow-up to last year’s movie was in the pipeline.\n\nMagnolia Pictures acquired North American rights to Declan Lowney‘s Alan Partridge, starring Steve Coogan as the title character well-known in the U.K., where he first appeared more than 20 years ago as a BBC sports reporter on the radio show On the Hour.\n\nCoogan’s fictional Norfolk DJ is about to star in a new series for Sky Atlantic, part of pay TV satellite operator BSkyB’s offering in the U.K.\n\nSTORY: Box Office: ‘Captain America: Winter Soldier’ Opens to Huge $10.2 Million Thursday Night\n\n“We are planning a sequel [to Alpha Papa], yes, that will be great,” Normal told The Guardian.\n\nPartridge’s big-screen debut found the DJ at the center of a siege after a disgruntled fellow radio presenter, played by Colm Meaney, decides to hold their station hostage after learning that he’s getting fired by the new management.\n\nNormal said there are plans for new episodes of an online series, Mid Morning Matters, as well as a new one-off program for Sky.\n\nHe described the new idea as “a little bit like [BBC documentary] Coast with Alan Partridge, except I don’t think he goes out of Norfolk.\n\nSTORY: Steve Coogan Comedy to Get FearNet Premiere\n\n“I think it’s things of interest in Norfolk, that’s the general theme.”\n\nThe Partridge character has made frequent appearances throughout the British media: He’s been a sports reporter on the TV news spoof The Day Today; host of his own TV chat show, Knowing Me, Knowing You; star of the fly-on-the-wall sitcom I’m Alan Partridge, and most recently he appeared on Mid Morning Matters.\n\nReleased as Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa last summer, the movie took in just south of $10 million at the U.K. box office, a respectable amount for the StudioCanal release. Baby Cow’s TV credits also include Gavin & Stacey and The Mighty Boosh."
