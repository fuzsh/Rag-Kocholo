        "text": "It's very difficult when talking to Steve Coogan, even about terribly sensible matters, to not picture Alan Partridge, the provincial, narcissistic sportscaster turned talk show host.\n\nFor Partridge is Coogan's most famous comic creation - more recognisable, in Britain at least, even than his creator.\n\nA grotesquely unsympathetic character, desperately seeking fame and with a habit of mixing his metaphors, Partridge was inducing cringes long before Ricky Gervais' David Brent came along in The Office.\n\nHe was born 17 years ago when Coogan worked on the radio show On the Hour, and was fleshed out further in 1994 when the show moved to television. Next, Partridge spawned his own spin-off chat show, Knowing Me, Knowing You, which made him a household name. The mock chat show was then spun-off even further with the sitcom I'm Alan Partridge.\n\nCoogan, 43, has several other well-loved characters and has starred in films and other TV programs. But it remains Partridge for whom he is best known - even in Australia, where none of the series have been broadcast on free-to-air. Word-of-mouth, loaned DVDs and, of course, YouTube, have combined to ensure you can't keep an appalling man down, and so next week Partridge and other characters will appear live in Australia for the first time.\n\nCoogan returned to live stand-up only late last year after more than a decade away. After so long, was it daunting to head back out on the road?\n\n\"Yes, it was,\" he says. \"Scary, but exciting too. I wanted to get back that feeling I'd had 10 years before, which I knew was the best feeling in the world, hearing a large number of people laugh at your funny jokes.\"\n\nLike many comedians who need the reassurance of applause, Coogan missed the immediacy of live performing: \"You don't get that with film and television. You lose touch with the audience.\"\n\nThe show he toured in the UK, Steve Coogan Is Alan Partridge and Other Less Successful Characters, got mixed reviews, most of them praising only the show's second half, in which he resurrects good old Mr P.\n\nCoogan bridles at talk of \"mixed reviews\" but concedes that it is indeed Partridge who always gets the biggest laughs.\n\nOutside Britain, though, it's Coogan, rather than Partridge, who is popular. His break-out role was as Factory Records boss Tony Wilson in the 2002 film 24-Hour Party People, and since then he's gone on to appear in several US films, working with Ben Stiller in Night at the Museum and Tropic Thunder and with Jim Jarmusch in Coffee and Cigarettes.\n\nSo does Alan Partridge feel like something of a millstone? \"Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't,\" Coogan says.\n\nEither way, he remains a favourite for the comic to perform. And to watch:\n\n\"I like the character and when I see him on TV it makes me laugh too, even though I'm watching myself; it's kind of weird. I don't feel like I'm being funny, I feel like I'm playing a character who's funny. He seems real for me.\"\n\nThere is speculation in the British press that Coogan is resurrecting Partridge yet again, with a feature film on the cards. He is at first reluctant to talk about it, but finally concedes: \"Um, well, I may as well say yes now. It's going to happen, yes. It's already being plotted.\"\n\nAs for his Australian debut, Coogan doesn't see his lower profile as an obstacle. \"I actually think there's an advantage in being an underground thing; the cool people like it. And also, there's no danger in there being a backlash because I haven't even arrived yet.\"\n\nCoogan says he has adapted his live show for Australia, dropping references to certain British celebs, and omitting his finale, in which he plays \"Steve Coogan himself\" while singing a song called Everyone's a Bit of a C--- Sometimes. A self-deprecating ditty trading on his tabloid reputation, the song has been a major talking point among reviewers and fans alike.\n\n\"That was the highlight of the show in the UK, but the whole point of the song depends on me being known,\" he says. \"It's about me being famous and trading on some of the stories people have read about me, so it doesn't really work in Australia. I will miss it.\"\n\nThe song makes reference to many of Coogan's alleged extra-curricular activities: strippers, cocaine-fuelled nights, and a certain short-lived relationship with one Courtney Love.\n\n\"It was my favourite part of the show,\" he muses wistfully. \"It was the killer blow at the end of the show. And it was nice to say it over and over, although it was a bit weird singing it when my mum and dad came.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Coogan's star continues to rise in Hollywood. Among his films scheduled for release this year are the political comedy In the Loop with James Gandolfini, Safety Glass with Hilary Duff, and a sequel to Night at the Museum.\n\nSo perhaps on his next tour, when he's a little more famous at this end of the world, he might be able to roll out that song after all.\n\n\"That's true,\" Coogan says, laughing. \"Although if you use that word in America you'd probably get sent to Guantanamo Bay.\"\n\nSteve Coogan is at the Forum Theatre as part of the Melbourne Comedy Festival, April 2-12."
