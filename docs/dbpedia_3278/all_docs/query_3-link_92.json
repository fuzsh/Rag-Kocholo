        "text": "Twenty years on from the first series of I’m Alan Partridge, the Norwich based comedic creation is returning to the BBC.\n\nPrefacing Partridge’s return is the documentary ‘Alan Partridge: Why, When, Where, How and Whom?’, airing tonight (27 December) and featuring cast and crew members ruminating over the character’s creation.\n\nDespite Partridge’s near-universal popularity (aside from the late Tony Hayers), it’s surprising to learn that Steve Coogan and his fellow writers had major doubts about the Norfolk presenter’s longevity.\n\nI’m Alan Partridge at 20: what it was like to play Michael the Geordie\n\nPitching Partridge\n\nWhen Coogan first pitched his character of a sports presenter at comedy radio show On The Hour, he quickly had his colleagues in raptures.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nim8pj8CWqw\n\nCo-creator Armando Ianucci explains the origins of the character’s name:\n\n“The moment he started speaking everyone else started laughing and somebody said ‘he’s a Partridge, he’s Mr Partridge’ and somebody else said ‘and he’s Alan’.”\n\nHe was an instant hit with his fellow comedians.\n\nCoogan recalls how screenwriter Patrick Marber predicted Partridge’s success during the character’s development: “This character is going to change your life – people are going to be shouting “aha!” at you from across the street.”\n\nDespite this vote of confidence, Coogan had his doubts. Speaking candidly, he says: “I remember thinking this character can’t sustain half an hour.”\n\nIf it weren’t for the encouragement of Marber, Coogan may have packed in Partridge before he found a wider audience.\n\n25 of the most textbook Alan Partridge quotes\n\nScepticism over a sitcom\n\nAlan Partridge quickly became a hit with audiences despite Coogan’s doubts, through his chat show Knowing Me, Knowing You, after a stint on The Day Today.\n\nCoogan notes that the mock chat show was the launchpad for his character.\n\n“Knowing Me Knowing you: that’s what really put Alan on the map.”\n\nWith this confidence, Ianucci and Coogan began plotting Partridge’s move to a sitcom.\n\nThe script was initally pitched to Marber, who admits to scepticism.\n\n“When Armando and Steve showed me the first script they had, charmingly seeking my approval, I didn’t give it.”\n\nOnce again, Partridge’s future was in doubt.\n\nCoogan notes that there was a fear of “losing Alan’s DNA”, which had been painstakingly built up over the past few years.\n\nI’m Alan Partridge: checking into the Linton Travel Tavern\n\nHowever, Marber’s fears proved to be unfounded as Coogan and Ianucci pushed on with the creation of the sitcom, which would become known as ‘I’m Alan Partridge’.\n\n“I should have had the sense to think about what it would be like when it was shot by Armando and played by Steve,” admits Marber.\n\nTwenty years on from the debut of I’m Alan Partridge, the show remains as popular now, its best scenes and lines enjoying a weird kind of immortality on social media.\n\nThe desperate, despicable, but strangely lovable character displayed hilariously awkward tendencies unseen by audiences before.\n\nThe genius of the character was developed by Coogan, Ianucci and writer Peter Baynham, who would film themselves pitching ideas and bouncing ideas off each other.\n\nCoogan notes that the hit rate of these sessions was typically “10 per cent.”\n\nIanucci describes how the trio would “muck about a bit”, while Peter recalls that the three of them would pitch in Partridge’s voice, resulting in a surreal but hilarious situation.\n\n‘Give me another series, you s**t’\n\nFollowing the popularity of the instantly iconic first series, a second quickly followed.\n\nFollowing a mental breakdown, Alan stops living full time in a hotel and moves into a caravan – this was designed to retain a claustrophobic style.\n\nCoogan, however, says he regrets this move.\n\n“In retrospect we probably should have done two series in the hotel, but it was just this sort of fear of getting lazy.”\n\nCoogan believes that the second series was far darker than the debut outing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIqa11NCbmA\n\n“Series two is quite dark I think, there’s not much hope in it,” he says.\n\n“The spike[scene] was a real low point. We were thinking what would be literally and metaphorically painful for Alan.”\n\nWhile the scene proved to be comedy gold, Ianucci admits that things got “a little bit tense” during filming.\n\nCoogan notes that he was becoming overwhelmed with the character and that after a second season “we had to stop it”.\n\nJet from Gladiators on her 90s fame – and Alan Partridge\n\nWhat would Alan do?\n\nAs Coogan stepped away from Partridge he admits to initial “wildernessy” years in which he tried to forge a different comedy career path.\n\nDespite stepping away from the character, Partridge remained close to his heart.\n\n“I started thinking, what would Alan do in these moments?”\n\nIn 2010, eight years after the finale of I’m Alan Partridge, Coogan made the decision to breathe life back into Alan Partridge, with the low-key web-series Mid Morning Matters, and three years later came the film Alpha Papa.\n\nWith the imminent arrival of a new chat show, audiences will soon be introduced to the next chapter in the iconic character’s life.\n\nActress Felicity Montagu, who played Lynn in I’m Alan Partridge, insists that audiences “will see him [Alan] growing old – definitely.”\n\nAnd Coogan, despite his initial scepticism over the character’s potential, admits that he would be devastated if he ever said farewell to Partridge for good.\n\n“If I had to say goodbye to Alan forever I would be very upset. He’s my friend.”\n\nAlan Partridge: Why, When, Where, How and Whom? is on tonight (27 December) at 9pm on BBC Two."
