        "text": "My love for Alan Partridge knows no end. I love both KMKYWAP and IAP, but my favourite out of the two has to be I'm Alan Partridge, especially the first series. I've always loved the Farmers episode - it never stops being funny.\n\nMy highlights are probably the running joke about Alan's fascination with ladyboys, his radio interview with the farmer played by Chris Morris (\"You feed beefburgers to swans!\"), his meeting with the producers of the Waterbreak advert, especially the one with the voicebox (\"You sound like the little girl from The Exorcist.\"), and the part where the farmers dump a dead cow on Alan when he's on the barge. Just laugh-out-loud funny from start to finish!\n\n0\n\nLike bits of all three series-probably the first Im Alan Partridge series is the best for me. The episode creating comedy out of his own boredom and frustration-dismantling the trouser press/walking to the garage/driving round and round the ring road etc is a brilliant portrayal of dysfunctional singlehood imo-and the crazed fan episode always makes me laugh but manages to be pretty scary all the same. Loved the bit about the guy liking David Copperfield too-just not as much! - with Partridge pointing out that he agreed he was losing the battle for wallspace.\n\nLiked KMKY too-the Jon Thomson Cheeky Monkey skit is totally inspired.\n\nThe film was good-Geordie Michael was woefully underused though.\n\n0\n\nFrom one of my favourites A Room With an Alan -\n\nAlan: As you know, at the end of the week, I’m meeting Tony Hayers, at the BBC. And, he is Mr. Numero… one…. And the problem is I’ve got some rude daubings on the side of my car.\n\nSophie: Can you still drive the car?\n\nAlan: Well, yeah, yeah, obviously. I mean that’s not… do you know what it says on the side of my car?\n\nSophie: Tosser?\n\nAlan: No. Well, you’re in the right ballpark. No, it actually says ‘Cock’, ‘Piss’, ‘Partridge’.\n\nSally Phillips delivered that line perfectly.\n\n0\n\nI think I like im alan Patridge best but when I think about the two series there are favourites from both series. I particularly like the interview with the farmer and the presentation he does after he steps on the spike. But then I like the Valentine's Day one with the owls and the chocolate!\n\n0"
