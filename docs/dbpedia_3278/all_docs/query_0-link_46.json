        "text": "A is for Aha!\n\nAlan’s catchphrase on 90s chatshow Knowing Me, Knowing You. He greeted everyone with it, even the policemen who led him away after he accidentally shot and killed a guest. Later voted 84th in Channel 4’s 100 Best Catchphrases. It’s now journalism law that every headline about Alan must begin with “Aha!”. Except this one.\n\nA is also for: Abba (both Alan’s son and TV show were named after the pop quartet’s hits); Angela Ashbourne (Alan’s girlfriend whom he met during the siege of North Norfolk Digital but who later binned him for texting a female colleague “a raunchy joke that got out of hand”).\n\nB is for BBC\n\nAlan’s chatshow wasn’t recommissioned, which led to a breakdown and Toblerone-based weight issues. Now he’s back at Broadcasting House for new series This Time, a quarter-century after his BBC debut. Needless to say, he had the last laugh.\n\nB is also for: Brexit (Alan’s the voice of it on This Time); Best of the Beatles (his favourite Fab Four album); Backshall, Steve and Brookes, Bruno (Alan loathes both).\n\nC is for Coogan\n\nSteve Coogan might be a Bafta winner and Oscar nominee, but Partridge remains his career-defining role, one he’s played on and off for 28 years across radio, TV and film. His 2008 live tour was called Steve Coogan Is Alan Partridge and Other Less Successful Characters.\n\nC is also for: Carol (Alan’s ex-wife who ran off with her fitness instructor, AKA a “narcissistic sports pimp who drinks that yellow stuff in tins”); Corsodyl Mouthwash (Alan’s a brand ambassador); Castrol GTX (logo on the jacket he wore to a funeral).\n\nD is for Day Today\n\nAlan made his TV debut on Chris Morris’s news satire The Day Today, where his beat was sport (“plus the Paralympics”), despite knowing little about it. See him mistaking a 33-year-old jockey for a schoolboy.\n\nD is also for: Dan Dan the Kitchen Man (Alan’s best mate, who turned out to be a “sex swapper”); Dance, Charles (whom Alan wants to play him in a biopic).\n\nE is for East Anglia\n\nAlan’s favourite area of the UK, which he poetically calls: “The plump peninsula. Albion’s hind quarters. Or, quite simply, the Wales of the east.”\n\nE is also for: Emily Maitlis (she makes a cameo in This Time’s opening episode); ecstasy (which Alan took during hard-hitting documentary Scissored Isle, inducing “a mild high, during which I felt a bit hot and couldn’t stop talking about Lewis Hamilton”).\n\nF is for Fernando\n\nAlan’s son rarely speaks to his father, partly because he gives advice such as: “Fernando, you’re 22 years old and you’re spending your Saturday afternoon in bed with a girl. You’re wasting your life. It’s a beautiful day. Take her out to a local fort or a Victorian folly.” Alan also has a daughter named Denise but he’s less bothered about her.\n\nF is also for: Farmers (whom Alan angered with allegations of making pigs smoke and feeding beef burgers to swans); Fleetwood Mac (“soft-rock cocaine enthusiasts”).\n\nG is for Gibbons brothers\n\nWriter twins Neil and Rob Gibbons submitted a spec script to Coogan’s company Baby Cow in 2008. They’ve co-written every Partridge project since, giving the character a new lease of life. They not only wrote and directed new series This Time but Neil makes a fleeting cameo in the first episode. See if you can spot him.\n\nG is also for: Gordon (Alan’s middle name); Glen Ponder (bandleader whom Alan sacked on his chatshow); Gunnell, Sally (Alan’s all-time favourite athlete).\n\nH is for Hayers, Tony\n\nBBC commissioning editor, played by David Schneider, who was invited on to Christmas special Knowing Me, Knowing Yule and got hit in the face by Alan with a turkey. Later, he invited Alan to lunch to explain that his BBC career was over – cue another assault, this time with cheese. To Alan’s delight, his nemesis died Rod Hull-style while adjusting the TV aerial on his roof.\n\nH is also for: Hamilton’s Water Breaks (for whom Alan made a promotional video on the Norfolk Broads, hijacked by protesting farmers dropping a dead cow from a bridge on to his boat); “homosceptic” (how Alan describes himself, as opposed to homophobic).\n\nI is for Iannucci\n\nArmando Iannucci co-created Alan for Radio 4’s On the Hour. He asked Coogan to come up with a sports presenter and recalls: “We were on the floor when we heard this voice. Someone instantly said: ‘He’s an Alan,’ and someone else said: ‘He’s a Partridge.’”\n\nI is also for: I, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan (his spoof autobiography); Inverdale, John (real-life presenter prone to Partridgisms).\n\nJ is for Jennie Gresham\n\nAlan’s co-presenter on This Time, played by Susannah Fielding as an ambitious fembot who keeps stealing his lines. There may be trouble ahead.\n\nJ is also for: “Jurassic Park!”/“Jackanackanory!” (more Alan expressions of triumph); Jill (receptionist whom he bedded and sacked the same night); James Bond (Alan’s hero, hence his one-man re-enactment of The Spy Who Loved Me in his static caravan).\n\nK is for Knowing Me, Knowing You\n\nAlan’s chatshow, which ended with the host accidentally shooting restaurant critic Forbes McAllister with Lord Byron’s duelling pistol. Given one last chance with a Christmas special, Alan assaulted a BBC bigwig and a paralysed former golfer, ending his TV career. Until now.\n\nK is also for: Kate Bush (Alan performed a medley of her hits on Children in Need, which Coogan claims inspired Bush to make a live comeback herself); Knowles, Nick (“a big horrible git of a man”).\n\nL is for Lynn\n\nAlan’s long-suffering, underpaid PA Lynn Benfield (Felicity Montagu), whose duties include buying his fungal foot powder. Member of a local Baptist church. Wearer of snazzy cardigans.\n\nL is also for: Lexus (plural: Lexi, AKA “the Japanese Mercedes”); Linton Travel Tavern (off the A11 midway between London and Norwich, where Alan lived for 182 days); “Let battle commence!” (what Alan says before sex).\n\nM is for Michael\n\nAlan’s geordie mate, played by Simon Greenall. The army veteran was a hotel handyman, worked in the local BP garage and as a security guard at North Norfolk Digital. Last seen jumping off Cromer pier and declared legally dead, although no body was found.\n\nM is also for: Mid Morning Matters (Alan’s show on North Norfolk Digital, home to such phone-ins as “Which is the worst monger: fish, iron, rumour or war?”); Monkey Tennis (one of Alan’s TV proposals, now shorthand for shoddy TV formats); Mini Kievs (his favourite canape).\n\nN is for Norwich\n\nAlan’s home town. Iannucci and Coogan considered Milton Keynes but decided it was too obvious and Norwich had “more finesse”. “It’s geographically just that little bit annoyingly too far from London and has this weird, kind of isolated feel that seemed right for Alan,” says Iannucci. An Alan statue was erected in the city for Comic Relief in 2015, while its 2013 Christmas lights featured a giant sculpture of his face with laser-firing eyes.\n\nN is also for: Nomad (2016 book sequel to I, Partridge – the title is “Scottish for not mad”); “Needless to say, I had the last laugh” (phrase used 14 times in Alan’s first memoir, Bouncing Back, which was pulped after poor sales).\n\nO is for On the Hour\n\nRadio 4 news spoof where Alan was born in 1991. Patrick Marber, Stewart Lee and Richard Herring wrote much of his early material.\n\nO is also for: Owl sanctuary (Alan’s favoured date venue); Oddie, Bill (one of Alan’s few remaining celebrity friends).\n\nP is for Pear Tree Productions\n\nAlan’s production company, until he fired the entire workforce rather than downsize his car. It went into liquidation, but Alan prefers to think of it as “a sleeping volcano, always ready to ejaculate hot TV content into the air and over the surrounding land”.\n\nP is also for: Pat Farrell (fellow North Norfolk Digital DJ who was sacked during a corporate takeover in 2013 film Alpha Papa and returned with a shotgun to hold employees hostage); the Police (“or as they’re now known, Sting”).\n\nQ is for Queen Elizabeth Hospital\n\nAlan’s birthplace in King’s Lynn, on 2 April 1955. A midwife held the baby aloft like a “fleshy World Cup”.\n\nQ is also for: Quaddy (imaginary water monster which Alan feared in childhood, meaning he refused to go swimming for five years).\n\nR is for Radio\n\nAlan’s first love. He began his career DJing on hospital station Radio Smile but left “following arguments with patients”. After his TV sojourn, Alan returned to Radio Norwich – first on pre-breakfast show Up With the Partridge, then the station’s “third best slot”, Norfolk Nights.\n\nR is also for: Roachford (Alan lip-syncs to his hit Cuddly Toy in Alpha Papa until distracted by another motorist’s fog lamps); Richard Madeley (gaffe-prone, real-life broadcaster often compared to Partridge).\n\nS is for Sidekick Simon\n\nSimon Denton, played by Tim Key, was Alan’s co-host-cum-whipping boy on Mid Morning Matters – nicknamed “SS” with a tasteful “Sieg Heil!” jingle. He accompanies Alan to This Time to take “a sideways look at the news” but has trouble swiping at the studio’s “digiwall”.\n\nS is also for: Sonja (Alan’s “mildly cretinous” Ukrainian girlfriend, 14 years his junior); Smelly Alan Fartridge (his childhood nickname); “Smell my cheese, you mother!” (his career-ending threat to Tony Hayers over lunch).\n\nT is for This Time\n\nAlan’s new series: a weekday evening magazine show that bears a certain resemblance to The One Show. A perfect fit for the man whose broadcasting style was described by Ross Kemp as “equidistant between chitchat and analysis”.\n\nT is also for: Toblerone (Alan’s go-to vice when he let himself go); Thetford Forest (“To some it means dogging or suicide, but I’m old school and I’m off for a walk”).\n\nU is for U2\n\nThe stadium rock bores provided two plot points in I’m Alan Partridge. Alan offended Irish TV execs by misunderstanding Sunday Bloody Sunday (“it really encapsulates the frustration of a Sunday”). He later tried to impress Sonja by claiming to be a friend of Bono and taking her to his house (actually stately home Blickling Hall).\n\nU is also for: UK Conquest (cable channel on which Alan hosted military gameshow Skirmish); Ursula Andress (one of Alan’s celebrity crushes, along with Julia Bradbury and Anthea Turner); UB40 (Alan likes “the Britpop bands like UB40, Def Leppard”).\n\nV is for Vauxhall Vectra\n\nThe car Alan drove to Dundee in when he was “clinically fed up”.\n\nV is also for: Valance (“the skirt thing around the bed”).\n\nW is for World Cup Countdown\n\nAlan’s splutteringly inept football commentary in this Day Today segment remains the pinnacle of his sports journalism career: “TWAT! That was liquid football! SHIT! He must have a foot like a traction engine. BOOF! Eat my goal! The goalie has got football pie all over his shirt.”\n\nW is also for: Welcome to the Places of My Life (Alan’s Bafta-winning tour around Norfolk: “A Partridge pilgrimage. Or a Partrimage. A Pilgrimartridge. A Partrimiligrimage”).\n\nX is for X-Ray\n\nArmando Iannucci said the writers used I’m Alan Partridge as “kind of a social x-ray of male, middle-aged, Middle England”.\n\nX is also for: Oh please. We struggled to come up with one X, let alone two.\n\nY is for Yeovil Aerodrome\n\nAlan’s desired venue for a millennium barn dance, hosted by Jet from Gladiators. “Properly policed. Must not, repeat must not turn into an all-night rave.”\n\nY is also for: Yachting Mishaps (another of Alan’s programme ideas: “Some funny, some tragic”); Yvonne Boyd (fashion designer whom Alan offended on his chatshow, based on Vivienne Westwood’s appearance on Wogan when the audience laughed at her collection).\n\nZ is for Zombies\n\nBored at Linton Travel Tavern, Alan dressed as a zombie for a backfiring practical joke. His costume comprised a shower curtain cloak, ketchup around his mouth, the flex off a mini kettle for a vestigial tail, tungsten-tipped screws for claws and complimentary biscuits Sellotaped to his face. Watch and learn, The Walking Dead.\n\nZ is also for: Zeinab Badawi’s Twenty Hotels (a horse in Alan’s racing commentary, alongside Massive Bereavement, Onion Terror, Trust Me I’m a Stomach and Two Headed Sex Beast)."
