It is named after the song \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" by ABBA (the main character's favourite band), a rendition of which was used as the show's title music. Steve Coogan plays the incompetent but self-satisfied Norwich-based talk show host Alan Partridge, who often insults his guests and humiliates himself in the process. Alan was a spin-off character from the spoof radio show On the Hour (which later transferred to TV as The Day Today). Knowing Me, Knowing You was written by Coogan, Armando Iannucci (who produced the radio version) and Patrick Marber (who also starred), with contributions from the regular supporting cast of Doon Mackichan, Rebecca Front and David Schneider, who played Alan's weekly guests. Steve Brown provided the show's music and arrangements, and also appeared as Glenn Ponder, the man in charge of the house band (the name of which changed, without explanation, every episode).\n\nAlan went on to appear in two series of the sitcom I'm Alan Partridge, following his life after both his marriage and TV career come to an end, though the latter was subsequently revived. It was generally well received by fans and critics, and was nominated for a BAFTA and a British Comedy Award.\n\nFormat\n\n[edit]\n\nKnowing Me, Knowing You is a parody of the 1980s and 1990s UK chat show, such as Wogan and Des O'Connor Tonight.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Austin Chronicle called it \"one of the most hilarious satirical comedies in recent memory\".[1]\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nTransmission date House band Rebecca Front Patrick Marber David Schneider Doon Mackichan Other guests Another Alan 1 16 September 1994 Glenn Ponder and Chalet Sue Lewis, a quiet showjumper Keith Hunt, new host of This Is Your Life Big Red Book on This Is Your Life (untransmitted sequence) Shona McGough, an abrasive punk singer Keith's son, Shona's band and Roger Moore (voice; performed by Steve Coogan) - 2 23 September 1994 Glenn Ponder and Debonair Tania Beaumont, actress Gary Barker, washed-up actor and Tania's husband Tony Le Mesmer, magician and hypnotist - Daniella Forrest, transgender Playboy columnist (Minnie Driver) A sailor with a facial tic (John Thomson) 3 30 September 1994 Glenn Ponder and Ferrari Gina Langland, singer Lawrence Knowles, a sleazy promoter Clive Sealy, Lawrence's dermatologist - The Olympic Golden Girls of 1936; Hot Pants, an all-male strip troupe - 4 7 October 1994 Glenn Ponder and Savoir Faire Yvonne Boyd, a fashion designer with odd ideas Philippe Lambert, famous but arrogant French chef Head of Cirque des Clowns, a very risqué mime act - Nina Vanier, Alan's French co-host (Melanie Hudson) Alain Perdrix, a lorry driver who couldn't speak English 5 14 October 1994 Glenn Ponder and Lazarus Charlotte Fraser (Lab) Martin Dwyer, alias Lt.
