It aims to create supportive family environments, and to prevent, as well as treat, behavioural and emotional problems in children and teenagers.\n\nThe below animation explains what Triple P is:\n\nTriple P fits the needs of every family, whether they are struggling with temper tantrums or sleeping patterns, parents in conflict with their child or with each other, or have children with additional needs, including those struggling with their mental health.\n\nTriple P programmes draw on social learning, cognitive behavioural and developmental theory, in addition to research into risk factors associated with the development of social and behavioural problems in children.
