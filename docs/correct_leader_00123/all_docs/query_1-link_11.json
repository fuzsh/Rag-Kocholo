        "text": "As Spain’s second city in terms of its population and economic activity, Barcelona is one of the leading urban centres of Catalonia and of Spain as a whole. Founded more than 2,000 years ago, the city is home to countless riches dating back to Roman times, including the remains of the wall which once encircled the town, the temple of Augustus, the necropolis, and the architectural features to be seen in the basement of the town’s History Museum. The port of Barcelona is a genuine economic powerhouse. As a major hub for foreign trade, it has made Barcelona an important European trading center. Barcelona is also a leading tourist destination. Its cultural and architectural heritage (including the church of the Sagrada Familia, the medieval district of Barrio Gotico, the Pedralbes Monastery, the Royal Palace, the Picasso Museum, the Juan Miro foundation and the town’s History Museum) regularly attracts tourists from all over the world. Considered to be one of the finest Mediterranean towns, Barcelona is characterized by a charm and a dynamism unique of its kind.\n\nPlaza del Rey, Barcelona © Tourist Office of Spain\n\nA tradition dating back several centuries, the Spanish “Corrida” (bullfight) is one of the country’s best known popular customs. These fights, which set the bravery of the bull against the courage of the matador, have become extremely popular in Mediterranean Europe. The art of bullfighting, which first appeared during the 11th century, must be practiced according to clearly defined rules. The show takes place in three phases known as “Tercios”, during which the matador engages in face-to-face combat with the animal. Other forms of corrida have also appeared. The famous bull run in the town centre, the “encierro”, is without a doubt one of the most spectacular Spanish festivals. The event involves running in front of the bull for as long as possible and getting as close as possible to the animal. This has led to the Spanish corrida becoming well known far outside the borders of Spain, just like the horseback corrida, the “rejoneada”, an ancient activity which is still practiced today.\n\n© Tourist Office of Spain"
