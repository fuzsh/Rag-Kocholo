        "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Gray News) - Triple-digit temperatures in California have turned deadly.\n\nThe Sacramento County coroner’s office has confirmed that a 58-year-old man died from complications related to the heat.\n\n“Neighbor right here was knocking on the on the wall right there,” neighbor Donovan Garten said.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Donovan Garten said he heard calls for help coming from Kevin Gerhardt’s brother in their Village Green neighborhood.\n\n“I got up as fast as I could, got the boots on, ran into the house and, you know, went to go check on him and stuff,” Garten said.\n\nHe said Gerhardt seemed to be having a heat stroke inside of his home.\n\n“Kind of felt like I walked into an oven? Yeah, it felt like 20 degrees more than, you know, it usually should be. He wasn’t sweating at all, and that’s a sign of heat stroke,” Garten said.\n\nHe called 911, and medics took Gerhardt to a hospital, where he later died.\n\nThe coroner’s office confirmed his death was heat-related.\n\n“It seems like a senseless death,” said his mother Marilyn Sellers, who lives in the Los Angeles area.\n\nShe said Gerhardt and his brother didn’t have air conditioning inside of their home.\n\n“He needed to have some place else to go in the heat wave. And he didn’t,” Sellers said.\n\nHer message after losing her son: Dangerous heat should be taken seriously.\n\n“Don’t not take it seriously when they tell you it’s going to be over 100 and 105, take some precautions. If you don’t have air conditioning, get out and go someplace where there is because this is serious.”\n\nShe said she hopes his story can help to save other people.\n\nA major heat wave that has blanketed much of the United States over several days is to blame for at least 28 deaths.\n\nMost of the heat-related deaths were in California and Oregon but the high temperatures have killed people as far east as Maryland.\n\nAs of Wednesday, more than 135 million people across the country were under heat alerts.\n\nThe intense heat is expected to stick around through the weekend, and authorities fear the death toll could rise."
