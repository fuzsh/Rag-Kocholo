The situation in Spain affects the development of US policy in Europe because Franco's totalitarian and anti-democratic government makes Spain unacceptable to the other Western European nations aS a participant in the European recovery program and in the Western Union. Political aspects of Spain's Protocol with Argentina are of interest to US policy in the Western Hemisphere, and its doctrine of Hispanidad affects U3 interests in all the Latin American nations and the Philippine Republic. In economic terms, Spain is relatively unimportant to the US, except insofar as the US might have to deny to its enemies Spanish strategic raw materials. Normally less than two percent of US exports go to Spain while less than one percent of US imports come from that country. The military power of Spain is slight, although its armed forces are maintained at a numerical strength of more than 500,000 and almost half of the national budget is devoted to the military and police establishments. These forces lack modern equip- ment, and their training is curtailed by a shortage of oil and gasoline. Spain could not repel attack by a strong modern army. Its military capabilities cannot be effec- tively improved without weapons, aircraft, and equipment from foreign sources. The national economic development is retarded, and the capacity for war production is insufficient to sustain the armed forces except fn brief combat. Although there are important deposits of strategic minerals, these are not sufficiently inclusive to meet the demands of war. In the event of war, Franco probably would align himself eventually with the Western Powers, both out of expediency and because of his genuine abhorrence of Communist expansion. He would first, however, attempt to remain neutral. Spanish agricultural and industrial production has not been restored to the level attained before the Civil War of 1936-39. Modernization and renewal of equipment are sorely needed in all fields, but Spain's foreign exchange position is extremely poor. At the end of World War II, Spain was denied admission to the UN as a former Axis collaborator. Since December 1948, the government has been under the more specific disadvantages resulting from an UNGA resolution which, after censuring Franco because of his former close ties with Nazi Germany and because of his rightist totalitarian regime, excluded Spain from participation in international agencies or bodies affiliated with the UN, and recommended the withdrawal from Madrid of ministers and ambassadors of member nations. General Franco's calculations have Note: The information contained in this. report 5s as of September 1948. Th1s report has the concurrence of the intelligence organizations of the Navy and the Alr Force. Dissents by the O1flce of Intelligence Research, Department of State, and the Intellf- Bence Division, Department of the Attny, appear immediately following the Summary. Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP78-01617A001500020001-2 SECRET included the possibility that danger of war between the USSR and the Western democ- racies would overshadow the reasons for this international diplomatic and economic isolation and lead, if not to full normalization of his international relations, to the granting of direct aid by the US in the form of credits and goods necessary to rehabili- tate the Spanish economy and equip the Spanish armed Porces. The US, however, has not deviated in the case of Spain from its general policy with reference to all of the Western European nations in such matters: namely, action through multilateral ac- cords and the UN. Because of their opposition to Franco, the 16 European nations concerned have excluded Spain from the European recovery program. What line Franco will finally adopt in dealing with these conditions is not yet clear. During 1947 and the summer of 1948 he chose to draw close to Argentina in foreign relations, obtaining from Peron at crucial times two large loans for food im- ports and expressing solidarity with Peron's proposals fora \"third international po- sition\" apart from either the Communist or \"the capitalist\" bloc. In domestic policies he re-emphasized the Falangist theories of national self-sufficiency under close economic and social regimentation and denial of press and political freedom. He took an at- titude of intransigence toward suggestions of the US Department of State that he improve Spain's unfavorable international position by liberalizing his regime so as to make it more acceptable to public opinion in the US and the Western European nations. On the eve, however, of the 1948 UN General Assembly in Paris (where the Spanish question has been placed on the agenda at Poland's request), he gave ground by announcing that municipal elections would be allowed, and he renewed his efforts to obtain a rapprochement with the Spanish Pretender, Don Juan. Although objectionable to large numbers of the Spanish people, the Government of General Franco has been able to remain in power for nine years after obtaining mastery of the country in the 1938-39 Civil War. Under this regime, Spain is an \"authoritarian, National Syndicalist State\" which, for reasons of political strategy, has been proclaimed a \"kingdom\". The legitimate claimant to the throne is in exile and the Government fn practice is a dictatorship under General Franco, who by law is Chief of the Armed Forces as well as Chief of State, with no limit to his term of office and the right to name his successor. The Government exercises absolute control over press and propa- ganda, has suppressed civil and political liberties, and forcibly suppresses all political opposition, including that of Monarchists. It has regimented the national economy to a point which all but suffocates private enterprise. Most Spaniards are friendly toward the US and unfriendly toward the USSR. As the proletarian opposition to Franco has lost its former hope of intervention by the democracies to overthrow the regime, some sectors have tended to turn to the Spanish Communist Party. Moderate liberal forces have been weakened by repression and by their inability to unite. Were these processes to continue, ultimately only the Communists, now a discredited minority, might be ready to act with discipline and to obtain outside help if an emergency weakened the Government. The stability of the present Government depends on maintenance of a preponderant physical force and capacity to keep the faltering national economy on its feet. Franco has given no indication that he would relinquish his authority voluntarily, and there 0 0 is no present sign that the Army will withdraw its support. The future reliability of this support will depend a great deal, however, on economic trends. At best, in the foreseeable future, Franco will have to continue his practice of intrigue in order to maintain a balance among the three pillars of his power: namely, the Army, the Spanish Catholic hierarchy, and the fascist-type unitary \"party\" known as the Falange Es- panola. Franco has skillfully used and coordinated these groups despite antagonisms among them, but his Government has not achieved national unity. It is strong be- cause it holds the population in subjugation and has kept alive mutual fears of reprisal between Spaniards who took opposite sides in the Civil War. A popular uprising against Franco is unlikely. A coalition of anti-Franco centrist forces, combining Monarchist, Socialist, and labor groups, in the interior and outside of Spain, is being sought by exiled leaders with the object of obtaining peaceful transition from Franco's anti-liberalism to a more moderate regime. Even if such a group demonstrates capacity for unified action, it will succeed against the entrenched power of the regime only if it obtains moral support from the Western Powers or is able to capitalize, possibly through pressure by Spanish bankers, on the government's financial weakness and vulnerable economic position. In any case, the backing of a strong group of the Spanish Army generals would be required to induce Franco to yield his power. The only serious threat to the regime at the present time thus lies in the pre- carious economic situation. Early relief through UN or similar channels appears doubt- ful. Credits sought from private sources abroad have been denied, principally be- cause of lack of confidence in the long-term stability of the regime and because of its restrictions on foreign investments and free enterprise. Bilateral trade agreements concluded during 1947 and 1948 plus indirect benefits from the European recovery program have begun to provide some relief and probably will continue to do so iri the coming year. These benefits may avert, at least temporarily, the danger of economic collapse. So long as he feels able to keep the economic situation under control, Franco is unlikely to make important concessions toward democratic evolution, and there may be a prolongation of the Spanish totalitarian system under his rule. As a long-term prospect, this probably would lead eventually to a violent explosion of popular forces, in which the Communists would enjoy at least an initial advantage. The short-term outlook, however, is that the nation's economic situation will be critical during the fall and winter of 1948-49; if no striking development occurs to reverse this prospect, Franco will continue under domestic and foreign pressures which may oblige him either to make basic policy changes, radically altering the character of his regime, or abandon power. His ability to withstand these pressures will be impaired if there is marked contrast between the rate of Spanish economic rehabilitation under bilateral agreements and the rate of recovery fn the other Western European countries under multilateral international arrangements. On the other hand, if he decides to make policy changes and revamp the Government in order to satisfy these pressures, he will have to run the risk of strong opposition and possible overthrow at the hands of the forces whose vested interests would be endangered by change. 0 DISSENT OF THE OFFICE OF INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT OF STATE The Intelligence organization of the Department of State cannot concur in the subject report, particularly with respect to Sections I and II which analyze the general economic situation in Spain and the position of the Franco regime. It is our view that the economic outlook in Spain is not as unfavorable as the report implies and that no political change is to be expected in the foreseeable future. There is now a distinct trend toward the improvement of Spain's international position which may well strengthen the Franco regime both economically and politically. On the one hand, an increasing number of bilateral commercial agreements with Western European and Latin American countries, together with the indirect aid derived from ERP assistance to the Western European countries, should improve the economic po- sition of Spain; on the other, the action of various Latin American countries in ac- crediting Chiefs of Mission to Madrid wlll enable Franco to escape, at least in part, the burdens of diplomatic isolation imposed on Spain by the i7N General Assembly. In view of the widening East-West split, Franco can expect to receive increasing support, directly or indirectly, from the Western powers. ? DISSENT OF THE INTELLIGENCE DIVISION? - - _ _ - , DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY ' The Intelligence Division, Department of the Army, substantially dissents with the conclusions set forth in this paper as to the probable future developments in Spain which will affect United States security. These conclusions are that, while no change is probable within six months, the situation in Spain is ultimately one of danger to the United States because of the possibility of Communist domination of the area. It is indicated that such domination might result from (a) revolution aided by the USSR, or (b) military aggression by the USSR. a. Regarding the first possibility, revolution, the paper states that the dissatis- fied working classes are susceptible to Communist propaganda. Furthermore, the assumption is implicit that no evolution toward a form of government more satis- factory politically and economically is possible within the Franco regime and that no alleviation of internally and externally imposed pressures can be expected. This divi- sion, on the other hand, believes revolution unlikely. It considers the Franco govern- ment one of the most stable in Western Europe and it believes the Spanish people to be much less susceptible to Communist propaganda than those of France or Italy. This division also believes that, given its present strength and stability, the Franco regime can begin to implement certain long-considered plans for internal evolution which in turn will help relieve external pressures. That the external situation is not static even now is shown by the betterment of Spanish relations with many countries during the past year, and particularly with France where anti-Franco feeling has had great strength. That the internal situation is not static is shown by the partial compromise between Franco and Don Juan and by the announcement of the forthcoming municipal elections. b. As to the second possibility, direct military aggression by Soviet forces, this is believed impossible unless the USSR first dominates the major part of Western Europe including either France or Italy. This set of circumstances is not mentioned in the paper, leaving one with the impression that aggression might be undertaken from present bases in the USSR or satellite countries, without a European or World War. c. The Intelligence Division, Department of the Army, considers that the paper fails to bring out the two most pressing problems affecting United States security which the Spanish situation presents. First, the potential strategic importance of Spain to the United States in the event of war with the USSR renders extremely serious the present coolness of relations between Spain and the United States. Second, the stra- tegic importance to the United States of Western Europe as a whole renders equally serious the present coolness of the major Western European nations toward Spain. O The United States has shown that ft recognizes the importance to its own security of the i ,tegration of Western Europe economically, politically, and militarily. Such inte- gration is incomplete and inadequate without Spain, yet Spain has been specifically Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP78-01617A001500020001-2 SEf`RF?r excluded from all moves in this direction. The Intelligence Division, Department of the Army, realizes that the problem of bringing Spain into the Western group of nations is a difficult one but does not consider it insoluble. This division believes evolution within Spain is not only passible but probable and considers that evolution will lead to bettered relations with the Western Powers, including the United States, with the possible ultimate inclusion of Spain in the Western defense system. However, should efforts to achieve a measure of union of Western European nations fail or should they prove so inadequate as to merit no further encouragement or support from the United States, the strategic value of Spain to the United States would warrant increased efforts on the part of the United States to establish full cordiality in relations between the two countrtes. O 0 For a century and a half, the Spanish people have struggled against oppression. Their history during this period is a record of poverty, insurrection, administrative incapacity, class warfare, declining world influence, and determined resistance to foreign domination. Above all, there has been a conflict between authoritarians and liberals, between the desire of the Church, the Army, and the propertied classes to preserve the medieval Spanish Catholic tradition by the discipline of a powerful government and the wish of anti-clerical intellectuals and workers to modernize Spain and free it from traditional backwardness and misgovernment. This conflict of classes and ideas has been intensified especially in the 20th century bq parallel movements for regional autonomy fn Catalonia, the Basque provinces, and Galicia.. Since 1800, the Spanish people have fought two of the bloodiest civil wars of modern times, while five monarchs (from three different dynasties) have been exiled. Two republics have been short-lived and unsuccessful experiments. Military dictators, after several years of rule, have had to abandon power and take refuge abroad. Stability of government has thus, at best, been measured by decades rather than by generations, and instability has gone so far that in one year (1873) Spain had five Chiefs of State. This record of change is the outward manifestation of deep maladjustments which are as yet far from corrected. It is noteworthy, however, that after several centuries of disintegration, culminating in the war with the US, Spanish thinking began to alter in response to the loss of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. The \"Generation of '98\" was awakened to a critical analysis of its country's plight and produced the first large group of distinguished, progressive intellectuals and writers Spain had known since the 17th century. Simultaneously, ademand developed throughout the nation for a more representative government. It was not until 1931 that these developments had a directing influence on public affairs. In April of that year the municipal elections resulted in an overwhelming victory for the Socialists and Republicans who stood for the establishment of a republic. On the evening of the 14th the leader of the emerging provisional government advised King Alfonso XIII that he should leave Spain. To avoid bloodshed, the King departed immediately. There followed, between 1931 and 1936, a republican period in which the liberal and leftist forces of the nation attempted to establish long-needed reforms. Such changes required, among other factors, a considerable period of political education conducted in a favorable atmosphere, which was denied by the situation itself and the personalities involved. Whether or not the Republic could have succeeded in modernizing the Spanish state remains an academic question. The reforming elements were opposed, then Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP78-01617A001500020001-2 SECRET as now, by the Army, which during the past century has been the controlling factor in the nation's Real Politik, by the propertied classes, and by the Spanish Catholic clergy which traditionally has been identified with reactionary political forces and has been unresponsive to progressive policies adopted by the Church in other countries. The position of the Republic was precarious even without this powerful oppos[tion. The successive Governments were weakened by the factionalism of their components, conservative Catholics, anti-clericals, Socialists, and left and right Republicans. The Governments were pressed for reform from all sides; parliamentary discussion was in- terminable; strikes were followed by insurrections characterized by great ferocity. The world economic crisis added to these difficulties. The period ended on 17 July 1936 when the Army in Spanish Morocco mutinied under the leadership of Franco and other generals. On the following day, garrisons throughout Spain rose according to plan. The Army leaders with the backing of various conservative groups and the radical new Falange Party aimed at a quick seizure of the Government but were confronted by a widespread and furious popular resistance, which they quelled only after nearly three years of bitter fighting. On 29 September 1938 the council of rebel generals appointed General Franco Chief of the Government to take over the powers of State. Immediatelq thereafter, on 1 October, he assumed the position of Chief of State which he has retained ever since. Foreign aid was a decisive factor in the military operations of the Civil War. While the Western democracies largely adhered to a policy of non-intervention, General Franco received substantial aid from the Axis powers from the beginning of the uprising until his victory was assured. Soviet aid was given the Republican Government, but was limited in amount and effectiveness because of eventual Republican refusal, following a period of collaboration, to accede to Soviet political demands designed to secure the predominance of the Communist Party. The end of hostilities was announced on 1 April 1939 by General Franco. During the conflict, more than one million persons died; half that number went into exile; and almost as many found themselves in prisons and concentration camps. One effect of this violence has been to implant in the people a strong desire to avoid a renewal of civil conflict. After the war, harsh laws were enacted; a police state was organized, and cordial relations were maintained with Hitler and Mussolini. Franco's domestic maneuverings, which involved playing off the Army, Church, and Falange against each other in masterly fashion, were successful. With equal skill he manipulated his \"neutrality\" in World War II. He encouraged the Axis during its early victories and as far as pos- sible supported it in ways short of war. With the decline of the Axis he became more amenable to the desires of the Allies. Much informed foreign and Spanish political opinion had believed that, in view of his pro-Axis policies and dictatorial procedures, Franco would be forced out as a result of the Allied victory. Condemned by the Potsdam Declaration, censured by the United Nations, he nevertheless was able to convert these foreign criticisms into a challenge to the Spanish people themselves, many of whom put aside their opposition to him out of nationalistic pride. V C C' While Franco's prestige at the head of national affairs has been prejudiced by diplomatic and economic isolation, and by the decline of the national economy, his foreign relations have been substantially aided by his long and outspoken anti-Com- munism and by the fact that Spain's strategic position might be of great importance to the western democracies should the USSR drive toward the Atlantic. His domestic position is stable for the immediate future because of the close support of the Army, the Church, and the Falange. The Army, particularly the officer corps, is maintained at maximum strength and is allowed special economic benefits; the Church and the religious orders enjoy privileges and influence greater than at any time since the 18th century; and the Falange has a heavy vested interest in the regime because it dominates the bureaucracy which directs the national economy, labor, students, and the youth movement. Although Spain's importance as a colonial power ceased after the Spanish-American War, Spain controls the Protectorate of Morocco ,and possesses three small territortes and several islands off the Atlantic coast of Africa. They are: Alhucemas, Pifion de Velez de la Gamorea, and Chafarinas Islands off the Moroccan Coast; Ifni (enclave in French Morocco on the Atlantic Ocean) ; Rio de Oro (including Spanish Sahara and Sekia El Hamara) ; Spanish Guinea (including Rio Muni, Los Elobeyes, Corisco, Fer- nando Po, and Annobdn Islands). The colonies and protectorate are administered by the military under a Directorate for Morocco and Colonies. These areas are generally economic liabilities rather than assets to Spain. A large part of the cost of administration has been borne by the central Government and the value of raw materials supplied to Spain up to the present has been exceeded by the value of foodstuffs and manufactured goods supplied by Spain. Within the past year, however, the Government has begun to take serious cognizance of the potentialities of these regions. ]:n late 1947 Construction was Commenced on a 200 kw. radio broad- casting station on Fernando Po Island. When completed, this station will be an important link in Spain's propaganda network, particularly its Hispanidad program. ffi January 1948 an serial survey of Spanish Guinea was made by several Cabinet Ministers, and funds were appropriated for development of two seaports, Bata, on the mainland of Rio Muni, and Santa Isabel on Fernando Po Island. Trial air service between Madrid and Spanish Guinea reportedly has taken place. Scientific expeditions have been dispatched to outlying areas. Spain has always been interested in North Africa. The cities of Ceuta and Melilla have been administered since 1640 and 1470, respectively, as Spanish cities although physically located within Morocco. In 1904 aSpanish-French treaty recognized the integrity of the Moroccan Empire and established \"special rights\" of each nation therein, which actually was equivalent to the creation of two zones of influence. Negoti- ations in 1912 provided that the Sultan be represented by a Caliph at Tetuan, seat of the Spanish Commissioner General. Titular chief of Government only, the Caliph has in fact no genuine governing powers, and Spanish Morocco in reality is under military occupation with some 66,000 troops, about half of them natives. Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP78-01617A001500020001-2 SECRET Spanish occupation of Morocco has been bitterly resisted and so costly in Spanish lives and money that it has caused the downfall of many Spanish governments. In 1909 and 1921 Riffian revolts mere successful, but when the Riffs attacked the French in 1923 a combined Franco-Spanish military force defeated them and sent their leader, Abd-el-Krim, into exile. Abd-el-Krim's escape to Egypt in mid-1947 stimulated the nationalistic spirit of his former followers. Spain has done little for the internal welfare of Morocco but has striven to make the Moors believe they are treated with more consideration in the Spanish Protectorate than in the French. Despite these efforts, the Moors are no more satisfied in the Spanish zone than in the French. Nationalist activities are increasing, and efforts are being made to have the question of Moroccan independence brought before the UN. Another uprising of the Riffs is a future possibility. Against it Spanish troops now are no more likely to be successful than in the past. a. Other Island Possessions. The Balearic Islands (Mallorca, Minorca, Ibiza), in the Mediterranean, and the Canarq Islands, off the coast of Africa opposite Ifni and Rio de Oro, are administered as part of metropolitan Spain. Trade with the Canaries is of high importance in the national economy as this area supplies fish, tomatoes, bananas, and onions for main- land consumption and for trade with the UK and other northern European countries. The Balearics are mainly developed as a vacation place. Several good harbors exist in both island groups and the Government is engaged in improving the air facilities. Military installations include a submarine base in the Canaries. $. PRESENT GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURE. a. Theory of Government and Basic Late. Spain is a totalitarian syndicalist state,' defined fn 1947 as a monarchy in which Franco is the Captain General of the armed forces, Chief of State, and head of the Falange. The Government has proclaimed itself \"a totalitarian instrument at the service of the Fatherland opposed to liberal capitalism and Marxist materialism.\" It was ad- ditionally defined in the Law of Succession, announced 31 March 1947 and promulgated 27 July 1947 and interpreted in Franco's speeches as a Catholic kingdom oP corporative type, devoted to social and material advances through a mechanism of \"organic democ- racy.\" \"Organic democracy\" means that an individual citizen's participation in the management of State affairs occurs, to the limited extent permitted, by reason of membership in a family, a vertical syndicate,' a provincial or municipal organization but not in a political party. ? $panfsh State Syndicalism is Sdentical 1n basic pattern to Fascism and Nazism, with certain d111erences !n application. It views the nation as a collectivity of \"producers\" who exist and work prlmarlly for the benefit of the State. It therefore compels the regimentation of all \"producers\" !n a series of \"vertical syndicates,\" each syndicate embracing the workers In a given Industry up and down the scale vertically through entrepreneurs, managers, technicians, and laborers. The vertical syndicates !n theory replace and are opposed to the \"horizontal\" organization of labor in tree trade unions. These are forbidden as provocative of \"class struggle\" which State syndicalism is supposed to eliminate. Professional workers, such as lawyers and doctors, are organized 1n national corporations. Both vertical syndicates and professional corporations are cantroll_ed by the State. J V Through a referendum on 7 July 1947, the regime obtained ratification of the \"Law for the Succession of the Chief of State.\". Since no freedom of press, radio, or assembly was allowed prior to the voting, the referendum cannot be assumed to reflect accurately the will of the majority. This referendum, however, has been the only direct reference of a public question to the Spanish people since General Franco set aside the Constitution of the Republic and established the Syndicalist State. Elections have been announced for November 1948, in which heads af,families and syndicates will vote for two-thirds of the members of town and city councils. The new Law of Succession allows General Franco to retain power indefinitely and establishes the procedure, over which he retains control, for the selection of his successor, who may, but does not have to be of royal blood. Additionally, the act establishes as the fundamental laws of the nation the Fuero de 1os Esp?noles or Spanish Blll of Rights, the Bill of Labor Rights, the Constituent Law of the Cortes, the Law of National Referendum, and the Law of Succession. Despite the existence of a \"Bill of Rights\" on the statute books, the Spanish people possess neither civil nor political liberty. Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment without trial are common. Freedom of speech and press and freedom of association are strictly proscribed. Freedom of religion is limited by legal provisions assuming that all Spaniards are Catholic by birth, and specifying that \"the only external public [religious] services or demonstrations permitted will be those of the Catholic Church.\" The right to work is curtailed by laws fostering the integration of workers into the Falange syndical organization. Those excluded for political reasons are deprived of free access to many standard means of livelihood other than self-employment, irregular, or menial work. ' The Fuero de los Espafwles was approved by the Cortes 27 July 1945, as an instrument describing the liberties, duties, religious rules, property rights, and capital- ]abor relationships of all Spaniards. Its provisions may appear generous, but they have no meaning in practice, because the Cortes has never passed the necessary enabling legislation. The Fuero contains a clause, moreover, which limits the civil and political rights described, by providing that they shall not be exercised in any way endangering the security of the State or attacking its fundamental principles. The State, mean- while, enjoys unlimited authority to interpret this provision as best suits its convenience. The Fuero del Trabajo or Bill of Labor Rights (promulgated 9 March 1938) is designed to realize the \"National-Syndical Revolution\" by regimenting the entire economic-social activity (i.e. all personnel engaged in production, including employers and management) in \"vertical syndicates,\" under the control of the Falange Party, in accordance with principles of \"unity, totality and hierarchy.\" The authors of this legislation sought to wipe out all traces of what they re- garded as the errors of the liberal democratic state, particularly by doing away with \"class struggle\" through subordinating all persons engaged in production to the single objective of serving the State. Under this system, the \"citizen\" of the democratic state is replaced by the \"producer,\" who possesses many duties but few rights. The Fuero del Trabajo deals with the \"social duty of work\" and is the basic Spanish law by which virtually ail industry and commerce have been brought under strict Government Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP78-01617A001500020001-2 SECRET regulation and fully organize in vertical syndicates. (See note at bottom p. 4.) Free labor unions have been outlawed; their properties seized and transferred to the Na- tional Syndical Delegation. The Law of Referendum provides that the Chief of State may, at his discretion, refer to the people any matter of transcendent importance. In such case, voting is obligatory, and those who fail to comply are subject to rigorous penalties. The fran- chise is extended to women, but is denied to a large number of persons disfranchised for political reasons. Only the Chief of State may initiate a referendum. ?. Legislative Br?nch. The legislative power resides ultimately in the Chief of State. The Spanish Cortes, as constituted by a decree-law of 17 July 1942, amended 9 March 1946, forms a corporative assembly of about 450 members which acts upon any legislation the Chief of State submits. The Cortes may recommend laws for con- sideration by the executive, but there is no provision for legislation to be introduced by individual members, and no proposed law may be drafted without the approval of the Chief of State. A representative character is ascribed to the Courts since some of its members are elected by provincial and municipal councils and professional corporations as well as by the National Syndicates. The majority of members, however, owe their offices directly or indirectly to the Chief of State, who may summarily remove any appointed member. The organization of the courts and the administration of justice have not greatly changed since the regime came into power. The judicial system is similar to that of other European countries where the law is based on the Napoleonic Code. The ordinary civil ?nd criminal courts are almost completely independent of the legislative and executive branches of the government. Judges are selected through competition under a Superior Council of Judges (Consejo Superior de la Magistratura). A complete purge of judges and public prosecutors throughout Spain was ordered, how- ever, after the defeat of the Republic and the resulting vacancies were filled by adherents of the National Movement (i.e., Falange). Franco controls the appointment of the Superior Council of Judges, and an oath of allegiance to the Chief of State is required of all persons involved in the administration of justice. Labor Courts, which adjudicate cases arising under the labor laws, are separate from the civil and criminal courts. The judges are appointed by the Minister of Labor. The Council of State (Consefo de Estado), an advisory body of the executive branch of the government, acts as a court for hearing complaints or suits by private individuals against the Government. More characteristic of and more closely identified with the regime are the extraordinary courts charged with administering special laws for the defense of the security of the state, some of which are ex post facto. These courts are: Tribunal for Political Responsibilities during the Republic. This court was established by a decree of 9 February 1942 which was an adaptation of a similar law of the Republic directed against Monarchists. It formerly prosecuted persons on charges related to political activities of the Popular Front during the Republic. The Tribunal is now inactive but continues in legal existence, represented by a secretariat which maintains its archives. Tribunal for the Repression of Freemasonry and Communism. This court was established under a law of 1 May 1940. The court is presided over by political appointees. It was mainly devoted to prosecution of alleged Masons and has now become relatively inactive except for supervising a parole system under which persons sentenced for Masonic affiliation and subsequently released from prison must report to the tribunal at frequent intervals. Trials of persons charged with other political crimes are now conducted almost exclusively by military courts. Military Courts handle all cases concerning attacks on \"the security of the State.\" Bq law and custom a broad interpretation is given this phrase, generally in accordance with Franco's declaration that \"dissidence is treason.\" Severe penalties, ranging through fines and imprisonment to death, are prescribed for activities regarded as subversive. The Supreme Court of Military Justice in Madrid acts as the supreme court for the revision of sentences imposed by the lower military courts. Civilian lawyers may appear before the lower tribunals, but the defense normally is conducted by an Army officer whom the defendant is allowed to choose from a panel named by the Court. Petitions to employ civilian counsel usually are refused. As Chief of State, President of the Government, and Chief of the Falange Party, General Franco controls the executive branch. Theoretically he is aided by a Council of State, a Council of Ministers, the National Council of the Falange, and the related Falange Political Council. To this list, a Council of the Realm has been added, in accordance with the Law of Succession. Most members of these bodies owe their appointment to Franco, either directly or through their Falange Party or other affilia- tion. They serve for indefinite terms and most of them may be dismissed at his will. Although supposedly guided by their advice in his conduct of the Government, General Franco has authority to issue orders and decrees independently. He may conclude treaties with other countries but only after consultation with the Council of the Realm. The Council of the Realm is a consultative body created in keeping with the concept of a renovated monarchy proclaimed by the Law of Succession. It consists of fourteen members, mainly chosen because of other State, Army, and Church offices they hold. The establishment of this council tended to consolidate the already advanced centralization of the Spanish Government under the personal rule of General Franco. Since the council legally is responsible for advising the Chief of State on all matters Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP78-01617A001500020001-2 SECRET within his exclusive competence, it could supersede all other advisory and executive agencies of the Government. It brings together the Presidents of the Council of State, the Cortes, the Spanish Institute, the Supreme Court, the Chief of the Supreme Military Staff, the senior Army General, and the ranking prelate from among those Churchmen who are members of the Cortes. In addition the Cortes is represented in the Council by seven members, four of whom are elected within the Cortes, the remain- der named by General Franco. The Council of the Realm was formally Constituted on 26 February 1948. The Regency Council, likewise created under the Law of Succession, consists of three members of the Council of the Realm, namely the senior Army General, the President of the Cortes, and the prelate. This Council would assume the executive power in the event of the death or incapacity of the Chief of State pending the installa- tion of his successor. The Council of State was created provisionally on 10 February 1940 and reor- ganized by decree of 26 November 1944. It is in theory the chief consultative body on all national administrative and economic matters and may make recommendations to the Government in affairs of public interest. Its functions are largely honorary, as it meets only at the call of the Chief of State and is infrequently summoned. The appoint- ment of the Council of the Realm probably will further diminish the importance of the Council of State. The Council of Ministers is presided over by General Franco as President of the Government. This council i5 composed of the heads of the twelve ministries or departments of government: Foreign Affairs, Government, War, Marine, Aviation, Justice, Finance, Industry and Commerce, Agriculture, Education, Public Works, and Labor, listed in the order currently approved by official censorship. Their importance as advisers to the Chief of State may be reduced fn the future as a consequence of the creation of the Council of the Realm, their duties becoming largely administrative. Four of the Ministries-those of Government, Education, Labor, Industry and Commerce-preside over activities of special importance in guaranteeing the sta- bility of the regime and rooting its policies deeply into the national life by means of (1) the police force, (2) education, propaganda, and control of information, (3) economic control, and (4) labor regimentation and bureaucracy. The Ministry of Government controls the police, the armed constabulary or Civil Guard, and the important DGS, or Directorate General of Security, all of which are charged with maintaining internal order. The DGS is the servant of the dictatorship; through it Franco is the master of a \"police state.\" While not as thorough as the Gest?po, the DGS is similar and was given its present organization on the advice of Nazi experts, including Heinrich Himmler, Its persecution of Franco's political opposition is relentless and effective. It maintains close liaison with other intelligence agencies of the government, including Army intelli- gence and the High General Staff. It has numerous subdivisions including a Commis- sariat General of Public Order and a Commissariat General of Politico-Social Affairs. The secret police in these two subdivisions number about 7,000. 0 Q Q bong famed in Spanish history, the Civil Guard has a record of severity as the guardian of any government to which its loyalty is pledged. Its present strength is 60,000. Its personnel and pay administration are handled by the Army, but its opera- tions are under the control of the Ministry of the Government. Local government also comes under the authority of this Ministry. In contrast to the traditional autonomy of the old Spanish communities, the central government and the Falange jointly control local administration. Each of Spain's fifty provinces is administered by a Civil Governor who represents the central Government and is also the Provincial Chief of the Falange. These appointments are made by General Franco. Mayors of municipalities owe their appointment to the Minister of Government. Mu- nicipal elections, promised by the government in 1945, are to be held in November 1948, according to recent announcement. The Ministry of Education controls public education and information. Through the Subsecretariat of Popular Education, it issues government policy state- ments, censors all newspapers, radio broadcasts, books, magazines, motion pictures, and the legitimate theater; and promulgates directives which must be obeyed by all Spanish press agencies. It also issues press cards to foreign correspondents. While their despatches are not subject to censorship, the Ministry can and sometimes does withdraw the cards of correspondents whose articles are considered \"inaccurate\" or \"unfriendly to the regime.\" Education is state controlled. The Ministry of Education has administrative supervision while the Church greatly influences policy. The preparation of all text- books is supervised by the Falange. Instruction in Catholic doctrine is compulsory in all grades, including the universities. The Spanish secondary schools approximate US high school and junior college grades and provide their graduates with a Bachelor's degree. Private secondary schools, largely operated by religious orders, far outnumber state schools. . The law places in the Falange the responsibility for indoctrination of all stu- dents in the principles of the National Syndicalist Movement. Students enrolled in the twelve state universities (there are no private universities) are compelled to maintain membership in the Falange Syndicate of University Students. The law provides for compulsory school attendance in the lower grades, and the government is making efforts to overcome Spain's age-old blight of illiteracy and ignorance. Progress is slow, however, as funds for education are meager, and the attendance law fs not enforced. School facilities are inadequate; most instructors are selected for their Partq or Church loyalty rather than for their technical qualification. Government efforts to regiment the cultural life of the country by assuming restrictive control over such institutions as the National Academies and former liberal forums retard creative effort and critical capacity. The arts are not flourishing, and the creative and critical spirit in literature is largely subordinated to repetitious glorlfl- cation of ancient Spain, attacks on nineteenth century liberalism, and defense of the National Movement and the Franco regime. The Ministry of Labor desires to bring every Spanish worker under its super- vision and protection. The Ministry fixes wages and hours, regulates working condi- Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP78-01617A001500020001-2 SECRET tions, and in general is charged with carrying out the social welfare program outlined by the Falange. Its activities parallel, and at some points interlock, those of the National Syndicates. Although the Falange has been divested oP the prominence it formerly had in the Franco Government, it has not been eliminated as a working organi- zation. It retains undisputed control of this Ministry and of the related .National Syndical Organization. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry has been one of the main instruments for expanding State control over the nation's business and industry, restricting private enterprise within narrow limits which the State agencies constantly tend to invade still further. The process is illustrated by the history of the most favored agency of this Ministry, namely INI (Instituto National de Industruz or National Institute of Industry) . Although INI is chartered only as a State financing agency, in practice it is an operating agency which has entered various fields normally covered by private enter- prise. INI can intervene in any industry judged of \"national interest.\" It has estab- lished various subsidiaries which are engaged m shipbuilding, aircraft construction, and other industries. In one phase of its activities, an IDTI subsidiary operates all mer- chant vessels belonging to the State, which now number forty. ~ IIQI receives govern- ment aid in various ways. It fs directly subsidized with the proceeds of government bonds and the Bank of Spain may provide it with \"working funds\" at an interest rate of .75 percent. The industries in which it intervenes enjoy tax reductions up to 50 per- cent, customs duty exemptions, preferential allocation of controlled supplies, and are favored by Government price regulations. Whlle the list of IIJI projects is long, Concrete results in the form of increased production or capacity for production are less impressive. II1I is firmly entrenched, however, and shows no sign of withdrawing from any of the fields it has entered; rather, it probably will continue to expand under the present regime. On 19 April 1937 Franco, by forcing the merger of several groups of his supporters, formed the Falange Espanola Tradicio?alista y de las J.O.N.S. (the Falange Party) and declared it the sole, legal political party. It is in effect a,division of the Government. The designation of National or National-Syndical Movement was adopted so as to make clear that the organization bears no resemblance to the free political parties of liberal democratic states. It was formed by uniting the Spanish Falange, organized on Fascist lines in 1931, the rival Juntas de OJensiva National-Sindicalista with which the Falange voluntarily combined forces in 1934, and the much older Comuni6n Tradicionalista, a body.of Catholic Absolutists dating back to the Carlist Wars, in recent years active mainly in Navarra. Because of its similarity to the Nazi and Fascist movements, and the pro-German sentiment of many of its most prominent members, the Falange became an embarrass= ment to the Franco Government in its international relations after the defeat of the Axis. It was not disbanded, however, and continues to receive Government funds and 0 Q to have an influential part in the administration of the Government and in molding the national life. In recent months, various indications have appeared of a Falange resurgence. The largest division of the Falange directlq incorporated into the Government is the National Syndical Organization, which embraces nearly all workers in most branches of production and maintains a large administrative bureaucracy. The Falange jealously guards its prerogative of indoctrinating the rising generations in the ideology of National Syndicalism. It controls the Syndicate of Spanish university students and the Franco Youth Movement. Apprentices seeking employment may be required to show proof of membership in the latter. The Feminine Section has a somewhat parallel national organization for girls and women, but its operations are limited and are gradually diminishing in range and effectiveness. The Falange is a Para-military body and has a uniform which is commonly worn by Section Chiefs, National Delegates, and other officers. It maintains, on a small scale, a University Militia and has its own arsenals of small arms. It has special representation in certain sections of the Direction General of Security, particularly the Politico-Social Brigade. In Madrid and other large cities the Falange endeavors to maintain a network of mili- tant members organized as House, Block, Neighborhood, and District Chiefs, particu- larly in the sections where large numbers of the poorer working class families are concentrated. Over-all planning and direction of the Falange are carried on by a National Coun- cil and a Political Council composed of high-ranking Falange officers and ecclesiastical advisers. Although the Falange is the sole legal party, the Army, the Church and its official lay affiliate, Acc:dn Catblica Espafzola (Catholic Action), exercise political influence: Many clandestine opposition political groupings and parties also exist. These legal and extra-legal organizations and groupings fall naturally into three divisions: (a) groups supporting Franco, (b) the rightist opposition, and (c) the leftist opposition. a. Groups Supporting Franco. (1) The Army is the chief bulwark of the Franco regime. While Franco has placated the Army in many ways, he has taken care to shift appointments so that no other officer has been able to build up sufficient following to challenge his power. Many officers who have shown either sympathy with the monarchist movement favor- ing Don Juan, or an inclination to believe that the elimination of Franco might benefit the nation have been relieved of active command. The Army's group loyalty to the regime is reinforced by the knowledge that a liberal, constitutional regime would reduce its forces, particularly the excessively large officer corps. (2) The Falange is Franco's largest and best-organized body of supporters. It is deeply entrenched in the machinery of national and local government and in the operation of the state-directed syndicates of workers, and it controls the syndicate of Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP78-01617A001500020001-2 SECRET university students. It contains a nucleus of revolutionary Fascists inspired by ideas of social reform and the Nazi strong-arm technique of imposing it, but the original party ideology has been somewhat diluted by the influx of bureaucrats and orthodox conservatives who have regarded the Falange as a vehicle for personal advancement. This element has an enormous vested interest in the regime and constitutes a formidable obstacle to any attempts to modify its basic policies. On some issues, the Falange has lost ground in clashes with the Church and the Army, but Franco has juggled these forces so as to preserve an equilibrtum, yet avoid suppression of the Falange. During 1947-48 it regained influence in the shaping of foreign and economic policies and showed marked resistance to efforts of some Accibn Cat6lica leaders to recapture a dominant role in social reform and labor welfare. Because its existence absolutely depends on the successes of the regime as now constituted, the Falange militants will fanatically defend the maintenance of the totalitarian state. (3) The Catholic episcopacy, which is rigidly conservative, has an important influence upon certain spheres of public opinion and on the conduct of governmental affairs. Most of its members support Franco, although some are severely critical of his policies and a few are in open opposition to him. By an agreement with the Vatican, even though the Pope retains and reportedly recently exercised the power to reject his nominations, Franco has virtually controlled the appointment of the Spanish higher clergy. Both out of religious conviction and political expediency, Franco is disposed to magnify the role of Catholicism in the national life and has been a willing instrument whereby the Church in Spain has fully regained the position of privilege, wealth, and influence lost during the growth oP constitutionalism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The Spanish Church, in fts turn supporting Franco, has followed the policy of allying itself with the political force best able to guarantee its prerogatives. In the present century, as in the past, this highly national church has execrated every liberal institution that found a place in Spanish life. As a consequence, most Spanish liberals, including monarchists, desire the separation of Church and State, while the anti-liberal hierarchy continues to regard Franco, with his dream of recreating the 16th century Spanish Catholic monarchy of Philip II, as the defender of its most cherished interests. (4) Accibn Catblica (Catholic Action) is predominantly pro-Franco. It offi- cially exists for the purpose of translating into reality the ideals of the Papal Encyclicals and is composed of four associations (for men, women, young men, and young women). Boasting a membership of more than 360,000, it is efficiently organized and enjoys the benefits of adroit clerical guidance, educated lay leadership, and substantial financial banking. Although it appeared in 1946 to be a potential nucleus of conservative oppo- sition to Franco-Falangist rule, its apparent endeavor to gain ascendancy by partici- pating in the Government has been frustrated. Several of its lay officials nevertheless occupy important positions, including that of Foreign Minister. While supporting Franco, they have worked for reduction of the power of the Falange. Members of Catholic Action and affiliated groups such as the National Association of Catholic Propa- gandists have authority in the Government offices controlling education, censorship, 0 and propaganda but possess little influence in the Ministries of Government, Labor, and Industry and Commerce. (5) Monarchist \"Conservatives,\" especially a faction of the anti-liberal Carlist movement, supported the regime from its inception. Indications have appeared, from time to time, that a body of such loyal Monarchists might be given the status of an official opposition party for the purpose of making the regime appear more democratic. During late 1947 and thus far in 1948, however, Franco has placed renewed emphasis on the \"authoritarian\" character of his regime and has postponed fulfilhnent of his promises to move toward political liberalization. He is likely to show little interest even in the fiction of tolerating any opposition group. V C: (1) Monarchist \"liberals,\" who advocate the restoration of a constitutional monarchy, with Don Juan de Borb6n, third son of Alfonso XIII, as King, have spon- sored the most serious opposition to Franco within the complex of groups that rebelled against the Republic. Don Juan has made it clear that he would institute a constitu- tional monarchy if in power. The Pretender's supporters include army officers, poli- ticians, and diplomats who have been in Franco's service, few of whom, however, remain in positions of power. Certain important industrialists and financiers are identified with his cause in the belief that Spain's economic problems can best be met under the type of governmerlit he offers. The extinction of male heirs to the Carlist succession, coupled with disillusionment with Franco's regime, also has led one faction of Carlists to support Don Juan. Franco's determination to maintain his authority and his skill in arrogating to himself certain advantages connected with the monarchical institu- tion have prevented the badly divided monarchists from making effective inroads upon the Army's loyalty. The extremely reactionary attitude of many monarchists clashes with the desire of others to broaden the Crown's appeal through advocacy of constitutionalism and cooperation with the Socialists and trade unions. Don Juan's problem is, there- fore, twofold: to outbid Franco for leadership of the Right, and simultaneously to obtain mass support through friendly relationships with moderate leftists. Promulga- tion in 1947 of the Law of Succession to Franco was denounced by Don Juan and his supporters and stimulated a renewal of their organizational and propaganda efforts. It was reasserted that Don Juan would continue to reject proposals to take the throne on Franco's terms. The campaign against Franco since then has been focused on the weakness of his economic policies, denouncing in particular the concessions made to Argentina in return for credits and his failure to obtain for Spain the benefits of participation in the European recovery program. The leftist opposition is numerically greater than the rightist opposition. During the Republic, the Spanish leftists stood for representative parliamentary gov- Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP78-01617A001500020001-2 SECRET ernment, land tenure reform, a less influential Church, vastly extended public educa- tion divorced from Church control, international cooperation, reduction of the Army, and other measures which they considered essential to making Spain modern and progressive. Because of the repression of all opposition by. the Franco Government, the real strength of the leftist groups, their degree of organization, and their positions on major issues are not clear. Abundant evidence exists, however, that in spite of unre- lentingpersecution, the leftist movement has not been destroyed. To the contrary, the parties which were in existence during the Republic have continued to maintain clan- destine organizations, and new leftist parties and groups have been formed inside Spain. Parallel organizations of both old and new groups also operate in exile. Com- municationsbetween the groups inside and outside Spain are precarious, but exist. (1) The Socialist Party. One of the oldest in Spain, the Socialist Party has always had a large following among middle-class professional groups and skilled workers. The majority of the Spanish Socialists, both in Spain and in exile, are anti-Communist and favor middle-of-the-road policies. A dissident, left-wing group, under the leadership of Juan Negrfn, adheres to policies similar to those of the Communist Party. The moderate and rigrit-wing Socialists, led by Indalecio Prieto, have taken the initiative in negotiations with representatives of Don Juan with the object.of uniting leftist and monarchist forces in support of an interim government to succeed Franco. The Spanish Socialist Party maintains a close relationship with the Socialist parties of the other European countries. Its voting strength in the past was, and again would be, greatly increased by its trade union affiliate, the UGT (Union Gen- eral de Tr?b?jadores or General Union of Workers). (2) The Trade Unions. The trade union movement exists tenuously in spite of repression and the compulsory regimentation of labor in the Falange Syndicates. Organized labor has long been about evenly divided between two groups-the UGT and the CNT-whose combined strength before the Civil War was 3,000,000. The UGT was established by the founder of the Spanish Socialist Party, Pablo Iglesias, and has always been directed by Socialist leaders. At present most of the UGT members are believed to be anti-Com- munist. There is a minority faction corresponding to the pro-Communist faction of of the Socialist Party. The CNT (ConJederaci6n Nacional del Tr?bajo or National Confederation of Labor), which is the anarcho-syndicalist trade union, has always been unalterably anti-Communist. In its early development it was strongly influenced by the theory of the anarchist, Bakunin, that labor should effect the social revolution by direct means, such as strikes, rather than through organized participation in politics. At the present time, the majority leaders have temporarily abandoned this policy in favor of political action. They advocate cooperation with all the non-Communist opposition in order to establish a liberal government to succeed Franco. Inside Spain, CNT leaders who 0 0 0 C' believe in political action have been at the forefront of the effort to unify the opposition to Franco and were first to undertake negotiations with the monarchists. A minority faction of the CNT rejects this program and still clings to the theory of pure anarchism, which would have nothing to do with any government save to work for its destruction. Although factionally divided, the Anarcho-Syndicalists, like the Socialists and their affiliated trade union, represent a deeply ingrained aspect of Spanish politics. Franco has been no more able than was the Dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera, to eradi- cate the appeal of this formerly extremist, now apparently more moderate, labor and social reform movement, which draws its main strength from the deep-seated social and economic maladjustments in Catalonia and Andalusia. The small Partido Sindicalista (Syndicalist) Party, which is an offshoot of the anarcho-syndicalist movement, also maintains an existence inside Spain and in exile. Its influence is negligible. (3) The Spanish Communist Party. This party's strength is not in numbers but in the discipline and training of its members. The party is hated and distrusted by most Spaniards, including the majority of leftists, but if the economic deterioration of Spain continues, it is con- ceivable that Communist leadership will be able to outbid other leftist organizations in the exploitation of mass resentment. The younger members of the other parties of the Left are particularly susceptible to Communist propaganda and some of them are being won over because of the inability of the other parties to offer a program of direct action at this time. The excellent organization of the small Communist Party enables it to maintain communications between the units in Spain and in exile with more success than that of other leftist groups. It receives directives and substantial propaganda but little or no financial aid from Moscow. Scattered money contributions are sent by sympathetic organizations all over the world, but the fact that the Party has to raise funds from among its own members to cover most of its operational costs limits its program. The current strength of the Spanish Communist Party cannot be esti- mated accurately. It may have 100,000 affiliates or sympathizers but probably has less than 10,000 active or trained members. Its efforts are mainly directed toward infiltrat- ing the Socialist and other leftist groups. Its activities have been in part favorable to the continuance of the Franeo regime in that it has worked to confuse, retard, and disrupt the efforts of moderate opposition groups which it has been unable to dominate. It formerly participated in such opposition organizations as the Republican Govern- ment-in-exile, the National Alliance of Democratic Forces, the Basque and the Catalan Nationalist governments; but during the past two years it has been dropped or expelled from all of them. (4) The Republican Parties. The Spanish parties having the most purely democratic doctrines are the threw Republican groups: Izquierda Republicans (Left Republican), Unidn Repub- Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP78-01617A001500020001-2 SECRET Zicana (Republican Union), and Partido Federalists (Federalist Party). Their appeal always has been principally to the white-collar classes and liberal intellectuals. The Spanish Republican leadership in exile has been distinguished from that of the other leftist parties by its refusal to participate in attempts to solve the Spanish problem through any means other than direct restoration of the Republic. There are indications that some of them now are prepared to modify this die-hard, legalistic attitude should other opposition elements form an effective coalition. Members of the three Republican parties have formed two loosely organ- ized clandestine \"blocs\" in Spain, known as the ARE (Alianza Republicans Espsnoke or Spanish Republican Alliance) and the Bloque Repubiicano (Republican Bloc). The former advocates the restoration of democracy in Spain by means of a plebiscite, while the latter desires the re-establishment of the Republic under the 1931 Constitution. (5) The Regional Parties. Another type of movement which has always had great vitality, despite severe repression by successive governments, is that for regional autonomy and a reduc- tion of the centralizing authority of Madrid. It is manifest particularly among the Catalans and Basques, and, to a lesser extent, among the Galicians. These proponents of a federalized Spain are part of the Spanish Left because the Right, advocating the principle of centralized authority, has always uncompromisingly opposed their aspira- tions. In the social and economic sense most Basque and Catalan nationalist leaders are moderates or even rightists, but it was the Republic which granted Catalonia and the Basque provinces a certain measure of autonomy, whereas Franco has banned even their regional languages, except as folklore. Linguistic and historical diversities, geographical barriers, and conflicting economic interests have given Catalan and Basque nationalism considerable inherent strength, especially during the past half century. Much of the effective political power of these movements has been dissipated, however, by the diversity of parties seeking to represent each region's aspirations. As the seats of Spain's most important industrial centers, they also are strongholds of the labor movements. (6) The Republican Government-in-Exile. This body was established in Mexico on 17 August 1945 and moved to France the following winter. It bases its authority on a quorum of deputies elected to the Spanish Cortes in 1936, whose popular mandate was considered by many leftists to be still in force because no authentic free elections had been held since. This Gov- ernment-in-exile has been weakened by several crises and reorganizations caused by the questions of cooperation with the opposition monarchists and of inclusion of Communist representation. The Communist Party is presently excluded. The Social- ists and certain other leftist groups have withdrawn voluntarily, so that only the three Republican parties now participate. These representatives, moreover, appear at the present time to be carrying on the Government-in-exile mainly for the purpose of pre- serving its existence as a symbol of the legal institution of the Republican Government, pending the time when the Spanish people will be able freely to express their choice as to the form of government under which they wish to live. (a) The ANFD (National Alliance of Democratic Forces). Beginning in 1943, the leftists in Spain endeavored to unite the oppo- sition in a clandestine coalition which all parties of the Left were invited to join. They succeeded in organizing the ANFD or AZianza National de Fuerzas Democrkticas, an organization composed of all the leftist groups except the Communist Party. Subse- quently the Communists gained admission. Their activities weakened the group and, in 1947, finally rendered it ineffective. (b) The Leftist-Monarchist Rapprochement. Since the end of the Civil War, in 1939, moderate leftist and rightist leaders have advocated the formation of a Centrist coalition as the only feasible way to solve the problem of replacing the Franco regime without recourse to violence. Efforts toward this end made bq monarchists and leftists in Spain were unsuccessful, but the project has never been abandoned. Current negotiations are being carried on mainly by representatives of these groups in exile. Indalecio Prieto, moderate Socialist leader, has taken the initiative for the Left in meetings with followers of Don Juan, represented by Josh Marla Gil Robles Prieto's object is to procure the removal of Franco and estab- lish an interim regime to be followed by a constitutional government. This movement appears to have the support of the UGT and CNT trade unions and is positively opposed only by the left-wing Socialists and the Communist Party, which has been excluded from the negotiations. The discussions between Prieto and Gil Robles were initiated in October 1947, and several meetings have taken place, the most recent between Prieto and one of Don Juan's emissaries being in August 1948. Agreement has been reached on most issues, including the form of government to succeed Franco on an interim basis, and the deferment of a plebiscite thereafter for an indefinite time, depending on internal conditions following the change in regime. The means of removing Franco must still be found and successfully exploited before the validity of this secret agree- ment between opposition factions can be tested. An additional problem is that of effecting agreement between the opposition groups and leaders in exile and those in Spain. Distrust and resentment color the attitude of the latter toward many of the former political leaders who fled following the defeat of the Republic. Few of them, either in monarchist or leftist ranks, could soon return to party leadership in Spain if political liberty were restored. The paucity of experienced leaders now existing might, however, lead to temporary accept? ante of such men as Prieto during a period of national reorganization. The stability of the present Government depends primarily upon Franco's retaining control of the instruments of force now at his command. The a1egiance of the Army and of the police is essential. To maintain this allegiance, Franco provides special privileges for the armed forces and the Falange. To insure that his position is not undermined, he must also provide security for the bureaucracy and must exercise skill Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP78-01617A001500020001-2 SECRET in maintaining a balance between his supporters and, at the same time, keeping opposition divided. Franco's government has remained in control mainly because his rightist and leftist oppositions have been unable to compose their differences, because the armed forces are determined to prevent a reversal of the political outcome of the Civil War, and because the people fear a renewal of disorder and violence. The military would with- draw its support from Franco in certain circumstances; for example, should the opposi- tion offer superior inducements with which to tempt them, and should the weakness of the national economic situation endanger the individual welfare of the higher officers. The laboring classes, while deeply dissatisfied, cannot undertake large-scale strikes or similar protest actions so long as they remain at bare subsistence level. Both physical and economic weakness reduce the likelihood of a spontaneous mass revolt. No time limit can be set for the ending of this artificial and ruthlessly imposed stability. It probably will depend in the long run on economic rather. than political factors. While Franco today appears to possess political strength as great as at any time in his career, his power rests on a basis of support which has narrowed since the beginning of his rule, despite outward appearances, and which recently has been further straitened because of his renewed attacks on the Don Juan monarchists and because of the impact on various sectors of society of the practical disadvantages resulting from Spain's international diplomatic and economic isolation. Franco has met interna- tional diplomatic criticism and has overshadowed the defections of former elements of support by using the powerful propaganda machine of his regime.to stir up nation- alistic resentment against foreign interference with the domestic affairs of Spain, always a potent stimulus to Spanish patrtotic sentiment. This has led to wide accept- ance of the belief that overt pressure on Franco from abroad strengthens rather than weakens his standing with the Spanish people. Such a reaction is apparent particularly among vast numbers whose jobs and prospects depend on preserving the regime, or who fear change in the absence of a clear and safe alternative, even though they dislike the regime and distrust its ability to resolve the nation's problems. Franco's domestic propaganda position has been weak- ened nevertheless by the recession of the Communist menace in France and Italy and by th_e protracted economic hardships at home. The decisive rejection by other Euro- pean nations of Spain's inclusion in the European recovery program in March 1948 evoked little popular response to the government-sponsored show of resentment, as compared with the mass demonstration stirred up after the adoption of the iTAl reso- ., lution of December 1946' which Franco then was able to exploit as foreign intervention: Fear of change, nevertheless, continues as the most important factor in Franco's favor. The greatest threat to the stability of the Franco Government lies in the country's precarious economic situation. Although the regime survived a severe crisis in 1945-46 and perhaps could weather another, although by a narrow margin, and although some recuperation may take place during the next six months, far-reaching agricultural, ? For text of the Resolution ~ see Appendix F, p. 85. - SECRET 18 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP78-01617A001500020001-2 0 industrial, and transport rehabilitation will be required to put the national economy on a secure basis. Bilateral trade agreements concluded during 1947-48 with Argen- tina, France, the UK, and other countries will afford relief, but probably will not be sufficient for effective recovery. There is, moreover, no assurance that Spain will be able to fulfil the commitments it has made in these agreements, in view of the difficulty it has had in meeting obligations contracted to date. Economic improvement without some political and economic reforms could even become an additional factor of instability for the Franco regime. The will and the ability of the popular opposition to organize probably would gradually increase with improvement in the standard of living of the laboring and middle classes. This stand- ard is at present too ]ow to enable wage earners to finance organizations of any kind or to strike. Their basic complaints have not been overcome by labor regimentation practices. The failure of the Spanish governing classes, past and present, to eliminate conditions which have caused immense discrepancy between the means and oppor- tunities of the impoverished masses and those of a small class of very wealthy Spaniards has injected vitality into all movements aimed at progressive government as well as virulence into extreme radical movements. These conditions cause groundswells of discontent which the Franco regime has contained by unrelenting political and physi- cal repressions. Those in power are constantly aware that beneath them are multi- tudes ready to grasp the first opportunity to throw off the authority which they believe has withheld justice from them, that a repressed people, apart from any particu- lar political ideology or leadership, vengefully seeks to abolish the laws, institutions, and personalities of the government under which they suffer. This knowledge, com- bined with fear of Communism, has been a factor in Franco's refusal to modify the governmental system which protects him and his adherents. It has caused bankers and industrialists, despite their severe criticisms of the regime, to accept the disadvan- tages of economic totalitarianism, even though they have recognized the possibility that these policies eventually may lead to economic breakdown and political chaos. Although the stability of the Franco regime depends primarily upon control of the domestic situation, certain powerful external influences affect it. Because of Franco's avowed anti-Communism, and because of fears abroad that his removal might be followed by Communist rule, or a period of chaos favorable to Communist aims, cer- tain foreign governments have declined to participate in any direct action aimed at forcing him out. This determination has been reinforced by the demands of the USSR and satellite states for such a solution, and by some acceptance of the theory that the Iberian peninsula, while Franco is in power, could serve as a bulwark against Commu- nist control of the European continent. Also, the failure of opposition forces to unite on a program for removing the present Government and on the kind and composition of regime to replace it has caused lack of confidence abroad in their ability to govern the country if in power. Franco also has been aided by the substantial economic support and moral en- couragement given him by Argentina following the disastrous 1945 drought and par- ticularly after passage of the 1946 UN resolution. This assistance enabled him to adopt an independent and self-assured attitude in rejecting or evading the official and Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP78-01617A001500020001-2 SECRET unofficial intimations from the US and other countries that while improved relations with the Spanish people were desired, basic liberalization of the policies of the Spanish Government was essential to progress toward this objective. External influences unfavorable to the regime lie chiefly in the practical and psychological disadvantages of the exclusion of Spain from the UN and its related international organizations. The Spanish Foreign Office failed, with certain excep- tions, in a campaign to win return of ministers and ambassadors to Madrid before the UN General Assembly of September 1948. Despite some favorable international devel- opments, Franco's prestige both at home and abroad is still impaired by diplomatic isolation. Other external influences detrimental to stability are Spain's failure to gain inclu- sion in the European recovery program and the rejection of Portugal's proposal to bring Spain into the framework of the Western European Union. The tolerance of the French Governrent toward the Spanish Government-in-exile and the encouragement given by the French and British Socialist parties to Indalecio Prieto's initiative for anon-Com- munist coalition movement against Franco have also been of concern to the regime. By permitting opposition groups to remain in France, the French have provided them with a well located base for their operations and ready access to press and radio. The British Government has not concealed its preference for the restoration of a constitu- tional monarchy, although it evidently contemplates no direct intervention in favor of Don Juan. The attitude of the Vatican also Ys somewhat unfavorable to Franco. The Pope has received Don Juan and approves his claim to the Spanish Croam. Certain Vatican statesmen fear that a general upheaval will take place in Spain when Franco's dictator- ship ends and are apprehensive as to the effect on the stability of the government of his current financial and economic policies. As a means of peaceful transition to a suc- cessor government, they would favor an accord between Franco and Don Juan, whereby Franco would prepare to retire voluntarily, so as to make possible the establishment of a regime under which Spain can be integrated into the Western European Union and participate in the European recovery program. Certain former leaders of Spanish thought have been studying for the past two years the possibility of forming a Chris- tian Democratic Party in Spain in case of political liberalization. Some members of the Spanish hierarchy are known to favor these endeavors, of which the Vatican is informed. Franco's control of the Government will be endangered only if some of the high Army, Church, or Falange leaders become seriously alarmed over the deterioration of the national economy, in which case some combination of these elements might act against him. In such circumstances, the succession might be determined through seizure of power by a coup d'~tat backed up with force, although a precedent exists 1n Spanish history for the voluntary retirement of a military dictator. General Primo de Rivera withdrew when his policies were definitively rejected by the Army leaders after the nation's bankers had withdrawn their financial support from his Government. It is improbable that the three groups named above would act with unity against Franco; he well understands how to keep a balance between them and there appears to be no alternative to him on which they could agree. If fears of national bankruptcq caused some combination of national leaders to attempt his removal, their problem scarcely could be confined to anything so simple as putting him out of office and selecting a successor to replace him. It would involve decisions as to the type, extent, and timing of changes to be made in the structure and policies of the Government. The only unity of purpose which at present holds these groups together under Franco is the desire to preserve their vested interests as protected by the regime, since none of them can be said to be primarily concerned with the interest of the country as a whole but rather with special grnup and class interests. If any of the leaders decided to abandon Franco, it would be because they considered him unable further to protect their inter- ests. A question of preponderance of power would then arise. It is unlikely that any realignment of the forces now sharing power could be accomplished so as to change their present relative strengths, or that any one of these elements alone could assume control, except through force. The possibilities of a period of strife would follow, opening the way for widespread, if sporadic, disorders. A peaceful transition from Franco's regime to a successor government, therefore, either in the near or distant future, probably will be possible only under the leadership which can get the support of a strong group of military officers and of elements now excluded from influence in public affairs. Anew government could then be estab- lished on a broadened basis of popular support. If important defections among his military, clerical, or Falangist supporters became imminent, Franco might act in time to avert disaster. He apparently has put off criti- cism and alarm among some of them, during the past year, by his assurances that direct aid would eventually be forthcoming from the US. His only bargaining point for this aid, i.e., Spain's strategic importance, is debatable. Unless an outbreak of war between the US and the USSR were imminent, such a grant would be subordinated to interna- tional political considerations. Various efforts to obtain credits from private US sources have failed. An offering of dollar bonds by the Spanish Governrent-a device which appeared to be almost a last-resort attempt to raise needed foreign exchange-has been received with little interest. The short-term outlook is that the economic situation will remain critical during the fall and winter of 1948-49. Franco will probably continue under domestic and foreign pressures which could oblige him either to make basic policy changes, radically altering the character of his regime, or abandon power. His ability to with- stand these pressures will be reduced if there is a marked contrast between the rate of Spanish economic rehabilitation under bilateral agreements and the rate of recovery in the other Western European countries under multilateral international arrangements. Franco is not likely to liberalize his regime so long as he believes he can retain power without doing so. If he decides concessions are unavoidable, he will first attempt to make them piecemeal, in token form. Economic betterment resulting from foreign aid; if distributed so as to benefit the working classes as well as the favored ranks of Franco's supporters, could lessen politi- cal tensions and make possible gradual restoration of civil liberties. Before this could develop, Franco's personal power would be put to a severe test. He has become ever Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP78-01617A001500020001-2 SECRET more deeply committed to anti-liberal, totalitarian policies and to the advocates and beneficiaries of these policies. The structure of his regime has become rigid; there are many antagonisms between its components, and it is riddled and corroded with favort- tism and corruption. No liberalizing change of any kind can be made without invading the privileges of some of the elements supporting him. Franco's regime is one of extremism, and it wIIl be difficult even if he has the will, to change the course of his policies or evade their consequences. The long-term outlook for Spain at best is for a slow and halting recovery of eco- nomic stability and political liberty, while Franco's totalitarian rule, unless substan- tially modified, would probably lead ultimately to revolutionary violence. 1. GENESIS OF THE PRESENT ECONOMIC STTUATION. Spain today is economically weak, incapable of providing either the US or another power appreciable assistance in time of emergency and is dependent on foreign aid for basic economic recuperation. Spain's long-term economic problems are both chronic and acute. They arise from such deep-seated causes that no government has yet been able to survive the political consequences of serious attempts to make far-reaching reforms. A marked and continuing characteristic is the unwillingness of the privileged classes to bear a fair share of the costs of government, national defense, and public works and their consequent effort to place the main burden on the middle classes and the perennially impovex3shed working population. Historically, wealthy Spaniards have not used their capital or devoted their energies to improving the nation's basic indus- tries. Foreign capital, especially British, was allowed to play a prominent part in exploiting the national mineral wealth while the electric power potential, mainly kept in the hands of Spanish enterprise, was only partially developed. Agriculture has suffered because many large proprietors have held arable land out of production, while both proprietors and peasants have resisted modern methods; moreover, comparatively little has been done to irrigate potentially productive land. Centuries of inefficient land use and exploitation of natural resources have contributed to the national heritage of unsolved economic problems. Spain shared the universal depression of the 1930's. During the Spanish Civil War industrial plant sustained severe damage and business was generally dislocated. Large areas of agricultural land mere damaged or abandoned and have been only par- tially restored to production. Livestock numbers were decimated and have not been restored to the pre-1936 level. Recovery which might have been initiated after the Civil War was retarded by World War II, when few capital goods and industrial raw materials could be obtained. Mining, steel, and textlle industries deteriorated during this period for lack of new machinery. Since coming to power in 1939, Franco's \"Syndi- calist State\" government has pursued the object of making the country more nearly self-sufficient. This has led to adoption of policies inimical to the interests of foreign investors and has thus halted the inflow of capital, while available capital and labor have been directed into some inefficient and uneconomic enterprises. Even though it be conceded that the country is adversely affected by world economic troubles, these policies and the types of controls imposed by the government over labor and business are partly responsible for the present ]ow levels of production and low standard of living. The answer of the Franco Government to the undeniable need for economic reform has been an effort to extend government control even more closely aver every economic act and to adopt measures dictated by political theory or expediency rather than eco- nomic need. In addition to such necessary emergency controls as the rationing of Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP78-01617A001500020001-2 SECRET basic foods and other scarce supplies, and the allocation of limited foreign exchange, hundreds of decrees have been issued providing for detailed regulation of production, distribution, and transportation. Most business and industrial enterprise nominally operates under the profits system but is regimented under controls applied through a system of organization designed to merge the technical administration with the political operations of the Falange Party, as in the case of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Management has been shorn of almost all the powers and prerogatives of private ownership as understood in the United States, such as the setting of wages and prices, and the control of operations, including the right to cease operations. Labor likewise has lost the right to organize independently and bargain collectively. The authoritarian government of Spain has attained nothing like the success of Nazi Germany in making efficient use of available resources through imposition of controls. Although a radical revolution in government has taken place, little has been accomplished to correct the age-old ills of the country arising from concentration of wealth in the hands of a relatively small group while a low standard of living ? prevails for the great majority and acute poverty is common. Some traditional weaknesses have been magnified under the present system: corruption among officials and immense expenditures for the Army and police are a heavy drain on Spanish resources. Black market operations and staggering price rises measure the ineffectiveness of the price control and anti-hoarding laws. Because of the inefficiency of the rationing system, all Spaniards are driven to patronize the black market, not only for foods but other commodities such as building materials. It thrives by official consent, the main bene- fits going to individuals and classes of individuals in the Army and the bureaucracy whose loyalty is politically important to the regime. Because of its inability to con- trol prices, the regime also tolerates the universal practice by public employees includ- ing Army officers in all ranks, railway and bureaucratic job-holders, teachers and uni- versity professors of occupying two or more paid public positions at once and devoting much of their government-paid time to outside business, with a consequent toll of inefficiency upon government operations. The Spanish national income for 1946, the most recent year for which figures are available, has been estimated roughly at 80 billion pesetas or $4.8 blllion. United States national income in 1946 was $178.2 billion. Per capita incomes for 1946 were: Spafn, $177 and the US, $1,122. At the same period, the purchasing power in Spain of the peseta equivalent of one dollar was not more than twice the purchasing power of one dollar in the United States. The economy of the country is primarily based on agriculture. About 53 percent of the working population is engaged in agricultural pursuits, compared with 20 percent fn mining and manufacturing, other occupations accounting for the remaining 27 ? Spain's standard of living 1s about on a par with that of Italy, ranking considerably lower than that of other nations in Western Europe. C percent. There has been a slight relative increase in the number oP non-agricultural workers during the past 25 years. Spain possesses most of the mineral resources that are prerequisite for the develop- ment of a prosperous economy, but must import certain goods of vital importance. This includes part of the coal supply, 99 percent of the petroleum, and more than 90 percent of the cotton required by the national textile industry. The country is also heavily dependent on outside sources for machinery, automotive vehicles, transportation equip- ment, fertilizers and other chemicals. Agricultural production is insufficient for the national needs, and certain foodstuffs, currently in relatively large amounts, must be imported. Agricultural products and wines constitute the principal exports, with minerals, such as mercury, tungsten, pyrites, and potash, in second place. All fields of production in the country are suffering from the depreciation and obsolescence of most of the capital equipment and of the rail and highway transporta- tion systems, and from marked deficiencies in fuel, power, and raw materials. Spanish labor is potentially capable of productivity comparable to that of labor in most other European countries. The ranks of skilled labor were decimated in the Civil War and have not yet been refilled by the rising generation. The physical strength and morale of the existing labor force have been weakened bq low-level real income, unpopular regimentation, repressive government action, and some unemploy- ment during the period since the Civil War. An extensive government program of social beneflts,has not given workers enough real benefits to offset these liabilities. Before the Civil War of 1938-39 Spain was self-sufficient in the production of foodstuffs for a very low standard of living.? Since then "
