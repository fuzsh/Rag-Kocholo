During the last fort\n\nnight he had suffered from diabetes,\n\nand he had arranged to leave Paris- In\n\na day or two in order to receive\n\nspecial treatment in a nursing home at,\n\nFrankfort. >\n\nFeeling somewhat better, he had in\n\ntended to cmtertaln a number of\n\nfriends to tea -.this afternoon. Somp\n\nof the guests arrived only to learn\n\nof his death. .\n\nThis morning, his son Miguel, who\n\nla a Reserve Captain of Cavalry, and\n\nhis daughters, Carmen and. Pilar, en\n\ntered ids room to find tlie General\n\nsitting' up in- bed. He was opening a\n\nnumber ot letters.\n\nThey went to church; and on their\n\nreturn Miguel found his father sitting\n\nin an arnjehair without giving a sign\n\nof life.\n\nClose friends of 'the General who\n\nhad occasion to talk frequently with\n\nhim during his' stay In- Paris declared\n\nthat he. was the victim of bard work.\n\nHis- doctor attributed his Illness to his\n\nlabours during the period of his Dic\n\ntatorship,. He had toiled for 14 and\n\n16 hours a day. The reception he in\n\ntended holding to-day was to be a\n\nfarewell gathering before his depar\n\nture for. Germany. ,\n\nHis son Mjgucl had arrived only a\n\nfew days ago. He fought a duel re\n\ncently over the circumstances which\n\nled to his father's resignation, and\n\nhis face bears marks of the fight.\n\nThere are two other sons— Fernando.',\n\nwho is a lieutenant >of .. aviation in\n\nMorocco, and Jose, who is In Spain.\n\nSHOCK TO MADRID. \" -\n\nLargely owing to- the unexpected\n\nness o fthe death of .the ex-Dictator\n\nthe news spread He wildfire and was\n\nthe topic in every cafe and club in\n\nMadrid. ,\n\nThe Premier, General' Berengeur\n\nsaid the tidings dame as a great shock\n\nand expressed deep sorrow,- but made\n\nno reference to the personal merits of\n\nhis predecessor.\n\nSenrita Castellonos. once General\n\nPrimo de Rivera's fiancee, left Im\n\nmediately for Paris. The qnly son of\n\nthe late statesman received many calls\n\nfrom friends of Ills father,- especially\n\nofficials of the«Jate regime!\n\nThose unaffected by political . con\n\ntroversies acknowledge his great\n\nmerits as a patriot and a loyal friend\n\nof the King and his colleague. Even\n\nwhen the latter were incompetent he\n\nrefrained from dismissing them. His\n\nsudden collapse Is attributed, to over-«,\n\nw.heJhilng surprise at his cui't ' dis\n\nmissal by the King and the national\n\nrejoicing over hisdownfall.\n\nThe fact that his body 'Will be\n\nbrought to Madrid is embarrassing .\n\ntho authorities as .demonstrations may\n\nbe attempted. :\n\nRlVEItA THE -MAN.\n\nGeneral Don Miguel Primo de Rivera,.\n\nMarquis de Estellu, was one oC the'\n\nlatest, but probably far from the last,\n\nof a line of Spanish dictators „ who\n\nhave brought the 'methods of the past\n\nto bear on the problems of the present.\n\nBut \\vhereas most of his- predecessors\n\nwere self-mode politicians; risen from\n\nthe people, $he General -was an en-,\n\nthusiastlc soldier and an aristocrat of\n\nIndependent means.\n\nBorn in 1870, Miguel Primo de\n\nRivera, came from one of the solgno-\n\nrial houses of Jerez. His uncle, Fer\n\nnando Primo de Rivera Sobremontl,\n\nhad fought for tlie Spanish restoration\n\nand sedulously imbued the lad with\n\ntlie fighting ideals of feudal Spain.\n\nThe result was that once. lie- had en\n\ntered the army the young \"Mlguelito\"\n\nlost no time In earning distinction by\n\nhis gallantry, and Cor savlng.a battery\n\nfrom the Moors in Morocco at the age\n\nof 23 he gained a captaincy nnd the\n\nhighest honour available in Spain for\n\nheroism — the Cross of St; Ferdinand,\n\nwith laurels.\n\nWhen Undo Fernando went out as\n\nGovernor of the Philippines, ho took\n\n\"Mlguelito\" along with him, to face the\n\nrebel lender Aguinaldo. There Miguel\n\nobtained promotion to lieutenant-Col\n\nonel nt 27. Later on he was to defeat\n\nAbdel Krlm, and restore Spanish pres\n\ntige in Morocco.\n\nTHE JUNTO OF GENERALS.\n\nSuch was the man who took tho\n\nforemost place when, on a morning In\n\nthe autumn' of 1923, Spain awoke to the\n\nfact that a junto ot her generals was\n\ntaking the reins in hand. Tho others\n\nwere Sanjurpo, Saro, Daban, Caval-\n\ncantl, Don Federleo BerengUer, Fer\n\nnando Berenguer (his brother), and\n\nMartinez Anjdo, with Admiral Magaz,\n\nto represent tho navy. They were out\n\nto restore the prestige of tho army in\n\nAfrica, thus wiping out tho memory of\n\nMelilla and other defeats; to put an\n\nend to Spanish domestic terrorism and\n\nseparatism; to reform public morals;\n\nnnu commit Spain and Its destinies to\n\na group of strenuous' and high-\n\nminded patriots who should reorganise\n\nthe whole of the national life.\n\nTho group of confederate generals\n\nmet at. Madrid at tho end of August to\n\nconcert their movements for a coup\n\n'eiat on September 16, and. first of\n\nall, for tho deposition of Senor Alba,\n\ntho Minister for Foreign Affairs. But\n\nAlba very nearly caught the conspira\n\ntors In n batch more than once.\n\nIncidentally, General Primo do\n\nRivera was to bo removed from his\n\npost of Military Governor of Bar\n\ncelona. Lest tho old regime should\n\nforestall their plans, however, tho con'-\n\nspirntors ffsolved to advance . their\n\ncoup detnt two days earlier, and the\n\nfact that Its initial operations centred\n\nin Barcelona showed that tho Gover-.\n\nnor was nt the head of the arrange\n\nments.\n\nAs he said later to an Interviewer\n\nof \"Tho Daily Telegraph,\" ho bad\n\nwatched with growing indignation tho\n\nwidespread mis-government In civil\n\nrule, nnd tho laxity in military af\n\nfairs. \"Spain,\" he snld, was \"on 'the\n\nbrink of u horrible abyss,\" and as no\n\nbody seemed to be moving to save her,\n\nho himself \"undertook this surgical\n\noperation.\"\n\nENTER TI1E \"DIRECTORY.\"\n\nTho \"surgical operation\" worked like\n\nthe proverbial charm. On the morning\n\nof September 13, 1923, Spain woko up\n\nto find herself transformed. Martial\n\nlaw was proclaimed, communications\n\nwere seized, and the new Cabinet (only\n\nI (en days emerged from the process of\n\nreconstruction) was „ expyOssly dis\n\nmissed' by order of the General -Primo\n\nde Rivera, \"Marquis de Esieiln, not in\n\nhis capacity of a lociil- military gover\n\nnor, but acting by \"lnviLu'tion\" of the\n\niClng.\n\nHe promised to' repress profiteering\n\nand rent-racking, to reduce the high 1\n\ncost of living' -to reorganise, the police |\n\nand the administration, and to dismiss j\n\nall nepotic or superfluous military and\n\nState employeecj. As regards the1\n\nchronic separatist agi-.ation in Cm a- \\\n\nslonln, he was disposed to meet the\n\ntrouble half way by, grunting liomc\n\nrule; and ;is fof the danger of Com\n\nmunist mischief, he proposed to put all\n\npublic water supplies; &c., under mili\n\ntary guard. . |\n\nFor some time it remained a ques\n\ntion how for the .Marquis' de Esiella-\n\n(though the shorter-named \"Primo\" i\n\nbetter suits his direct and forceful\n\nnature) was backed I liroughout . the\n\nupheaval by the\"1 active approval- of his\n\nmonarch. Fivfi months later, as if to :\n\nhelp in clearing this point up, there |\n\nwus published through the medium of .\n\n.the Directory the text of a remarkable\n\n.speech byKlng Alfonso which had been\n\ndelivered In May, 1921 — that is tu say, ;\n\ntwo and u half years \"before \"the new j\n\nregime broke upbtf a startled world.\n\nHe was not an absolute monarch, |\n\nsaid Alfonso, «ave. to offer his. life for\n\nhis country; and ho was certainly\n\nwithoiit responsibility. .There was\n\nprofuse debate, but Purlhiment'dld not\n\ndo its duty, and unfulfilled, measures |\n\nproposed by. a' party in power were du!y «\n\nopposed by ic when unother party\n\ncaine In. The desire, his Majesty went\n\non, seemed be to hinder prosperity for j\n\nt political, purposes. He had been King 1\n\ni for nineteen yours, and had never over--.\n\nI stepped the Constitution;-, but he\n\nthought 'It wh$ time for the provinces'\n\nto start n moveqjent to support their j\n\nj King, to make the nation's repreSeiita-\n\ni tives In Parliament act as they should,\n\nj and to see the people's vote duly lion-\n\nI oured.\n\nREACTION AND DISILLUSION.\n\nHardly a year hud elapsed before\n\nsome of Primo's chief associates-, tor'\n\ntho Directory, Don Fedrrlco Bcren- i\n\n' guer and\" others, ' Were arrested! on,\n\ncharges of disaffection, c.

Later the cclc- ;\n\nbrated Captuin.-Gcnorul Weyler was\n\narrested for conspiracy, carrying a\n\nbagful of \"seditious\" literature. (\n\nFor u time the strictness .of the new I\n\nregimo was relaxed, and It was pro- |\n\nclaimed that the Dictator was disposed I\n\nto' revert to a Cabinet system more\n\ncivilian In its personnel and to an\n\nAdministration run on more constitu-."
