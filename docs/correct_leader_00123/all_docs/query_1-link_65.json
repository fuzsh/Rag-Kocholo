        "text": "During the second world war, commentators in Allied countries sometimes called Ramón Serrano Súñer, who has died aged 101, the Spanish Goebbels or Himmler - unfair, but indicative of his power in the Spain of General Franco. In the construction of the post-civil war Francoist state, his role transcended that of the Caudillo himself. As foreign minister, he dwarfed his predecessors and successors in the post. Effectively head of the fascist Falange from 1937 to 1942, he abandoned active politics in 1942, yet through occasional declarations and articles became a thorn in the side of the dictator.\n\nHe was born in Cartagena, in Murcia, the son of the distinguished civil engineer José Serrano Lloberes. In 1917 Serrano Súñer began to study law at Madrid's Universidad Central, where he became friends with José Antonio Primo de Rivera, son of the future dictator General Miguel, and founder of the Falange. Serrano Súñer graduated with the highest honours and then passed ferociously competitive examinations to join the elite state legal corps of Abogados del Estado (public prosecutors). Posted to Zaragoza in 1929, Serrano Súñer became friends with Franco, then director of the military academy there, and at his home he met and fell in love with Zita Polo, the beautiful younger sister of Franco's wife, Carmen. When he married Zita in February 1931, his best man was José Antonio.\n\nIn the elections of November 1933, Serrano Súñer successfully ran in Zaragoza as a parliamentary candidate for the Catholic authoritarian Confederación Española de Derechas Autónomas (Ceda). He became an increasingly prominent figure in the Ceda's youth movement, the Juventud de Acción Popular, bringing over much of its rank-and-file to the Falange on the eve of the civil war.\n\nIn the spring of 1936, he acted as a link between the conspirators on the mainland and Franco, who was Canary Islands military commander. Despite this, Serrano Súñer was not warned of the date of the uprising, and he and his family underwent terrifying experiences in republican Madrid. He witnessed the murder of friends in jail and himself only just evaded the sacas (removal of prisoners for illegal execution) which claimed the lives of his two brothers, José and Fernando, who had been refused sanctuary by the British and French embassies. These experiences made him an impassioned opponent of democracy.\n\nBy a daring subterfuge, he escaped from the Republican zone and, on February 20 1937, reached Franco's headquarters in Salamanca. Slightly built and handsome, Serrano Súñer cut a distinctive figure with his austerely aristocratic bearing. Traumatised, he sublimated his grief into a determination to create a Spain along the lines outlined by José Antonio Primo de Rivera, who, while awaiting execution in Alicante in 1936, had named him as one of his executors - the other was Raimundo Fernández Cuesta.\n\nSerrano Súñer regarded Franco's ramshackle political improvisations as \"un Estado campamental\" (a battlefield state). His first task was the transition to a permanent state apparatus. Serrano Suffer's brilliant university career and his work as a public prosecutor had proved him one of the outstanding legal minds of his generation. Daily access to Franco and association with José Antonio gave him the credentials for his task.\n\nHis chosen vehicle was the Falange, which, even before the war started, had been weakened by the arrest of many of its leaders. Decapitated by the execution of José Antonio, the million-strong party experienced a bitter power struggle and was ripe for takeover. The radical followers of José Antonio's designated successor, Manuel Hedilla, an unsophisticated fascist thug from Santander, were opposed by the legitimistas , relatives and friends of José Antonio who regarded Hedilla as too proletarian. This rivalry was exploited with some finesse in April 1937 by Serrano Súñer and Franco's brother Nicolas to unite all nationalist groups into Franco's single party Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista.\n\nThe purist followers of José Antonio, the camisas viejas (old shirts), were distressed to see their ideological role usurped by the church, their party turned into a machine for the distribution of patronage and their \"revolution\" indefinitely postponed. As chairman of the Falange's executive committee, the Junta Politica, and, from January 30 1938, interior minister, Serrano Súñer tried to find a middle way between the ideals of José Antonio Primo de Rivera and the realities of wartime Salamanca. The sincerity of his efforts, as he put it, \"to save as much as possible of José Antonio's legacy\" was reflected by the fact that he secured the collaboration of, and later a long friendship with, the idealistic Falangist poet Dionisio Ridruejo.\n\nAfter the civil war, his attempts to put into practice the spirit of José Antonio's prison writings brought him into conflict with conservative officers - a rivalry that Franco exploited to secure his own position as above both army and Falange. He was opposed by many camisas nuevas (new shirts) or \"Francofalangists\" who preferred adulation of the Caudillo as a way of enhancing their own careers.\n\nDespite being interior minister and the Falange's virtual head, Serrano Súñer devoted much energy to foreign affairs. From summer 1939 until his dismissal in September 1942, he was central to the formulation of Spain's international policy, although he did not formally become foreign minister until October 16 1940. Because of the drama and risks of those years, his international resonance far outweighed that of any other Spanish foreign minister between 1931 and 1945.\n\nAfter 1945, Franco's propagandists smeared Serrano Súñer as the exclusive architect of pro-German policy. That is nonsense. At the beginning of the second world war, flushed with success, fired by solidarity with his German and Italian allies, Franco was ready to take Spain into war. By autumn 1940, the unexpected survival of Britain inclined Franco to caution, although he was intensely tempted, after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, when Serrano Súñer warned him against burning his bridges.\n\nFranco did not passively let his brother-in-law make foreign policy. Juan Beigbeder, the Conde de Jordana and José Félix Lequerica, all foreign ministers during the second world war, made identical claims that the Caudillo formulated policy, leaving them to implement his instructions. Serrano Súñer's relationship with Franco gave him a greater prominence, and eventually, permitted him to contradict him. Moreover, unlike Franco, he had borne the brunt of tense negotiations with Hitler and Mussolini, and their respective foreign ministers, Joachim von Ribbentrop and Galeazzo Ciano.\n\nIn contrast to many of his contemporaries, Serrano Súñer's dignity and rectitude prevented him from later fabricating a past as a lifelong democrat. Like Franco, he believed fervently in the Axis cause, seeing the link with Germany and Italy as the way to end Spanish subservience to Britain and France. There can be no doubt about his attitude to Fascist Italy. During the 50 years after the death of Mussolini, he never hid his admiration for the Duce. It was also widely supposed that he was committed to Nazi Germany. Yet, his pride and his Catholicism prevented him being an uncritical friend of the Third Reich. The Germans came to regard him as an enemy.\n\nThe first of three tense confrontations with Hitler and von Ribbentrop came in September 1940 when, confident of German victory over Britain, Franco had sent him to Berlin to clinch the conditions for Spain's entry into the war. The harshness and affectation of von Ribbentrop provoked the intense dislike of Serrano Súñer. At the meeting on September 16, von Ribbentrop revealed the abyss which separated Franco and Hitler. The Germans wanted bases in the Canary Islands and in Spanish Morocco, civil war debt repayment and substantial mining concessions.\n\nSerrano Súñer had expected to be treated as a valued ally, not as the representative of a minor satellite. Touchy and fiercely patriotic, he regarded von Ribbentrop's demands as intolerable impertinence, and the lessons of his trip, when they sank in, significantly altered his attitude to the Third Reich. He wrote to warn Franco, but the Caudillo, besotted with Hitler, was convinced it was a misunderstanding created by bureaucratic underlings.\n\nUnder pressure from both von Ribbentrop and Hitler, Serrano Súñer stonewalled with aplomb. Subsequently, on further visits to Germany, in November 1940 and in November 1941, he stood firm behind a sincere rhetoric of Axis sympathies.\n\nThere were many reasons for Franco's wartime neutrality, including Spain's economic and military prostration after the civil war, and the proud obstinacy with which Serrano Súñer, despite his enthusiasm for a fascist world order, defended Spanish interests. He came, as was recognised by General Jodl, German army chief of staff, to be a greater obstacle to Spanish belligerence than Franco. The same independence of mind eventually provoked the resentment of a Caudillo increasingly accustomed to the adulation of his followers.\n\nMoreover, the quicksilver Serrano Súñer rarely concealed his impatience with the slow-moving dictator. After clashes between Falangists and Carlists at Begona, near Bilbao, in mid-August 1942, Franco cunningly resolved the situation by dropping Serrano Súñer at the beginning of September, thereby giving the army a sacrificial victim and strengthening his own grip on the Falange. Neither Axis nor Allies regarded Serrano Súñer's departure as signifying any change of direction in Franco's pro-German policy.\n\nIn the years following his removal from office, Serrano Súñer dedicated himself to his legal practice. His dignity, his occasional criticisms of Franco and his calls for political reform, earned him considerable public respect. In 1947, he published his first volume of memoirs, Entre Hendaya y Gibraltar (Between Hendaye and Gibraltar), which recounted his relations with the Axis but excluded Franco's meeting with Hitler on October 23 1940 at Hendaye. The story was not completed until 1977 and his Entre el silencio y la propaganda, la historia como fue (Between Silence And Propaganda, History As It Really Was) which severely dented Franco's reputation. He also published a substantial literary output of essays, including his books Semblanza de José Antonio, joven (Portrait Of The Young José Antonio Primo De Rivera, 1958), Ensayos al viento (Essays On The Wind, 1969), De anteayer y dehoy (From The Day Before Yesterday And From Today, 1981), and Politica de España 1936-1975 (Spanish Politics 1936-75, 1995).\n\nElegant in dress and speech, he was always ready to meet with historians. In lengthy conversations, he demonstrated remarkable narrative verve, deep patriotism and an acute irony. The intensity with which he recalled his past is unforgettable. Speaking of his university years with José Antonio Primo de Rivera, his eyes would light up as he became again a 20-year-old student. When he spoke of the encounters with Hitler and von Ribbentrop, his features would harden as he became the minister standing up for the right of Falangist Spain to be considered an ally and not a serf of Nazi Germany.\n\nSerrano Súñer was proud of having been a fascist and of his friendships with Mussolini and José Antonio Primo de Rivera. He saw Falangism as a way of furthering the cause in which his brothers had died. The tragedies of his personal life inclined him to fanaticism, yet there are many well-documented cases of his humanitarian interventions with Franco - some successful, some not - to save the lives of political prisoners. His legal training and practical ministerial responsibilities made him a pragmatist. With his death, there has disappeared a link to the second Spanish republic, to the Spanish civil war, to Franco, to Hitler, and to Mussolini.\n\nZita died a decade ago. Serrano Súñer is survived by his six children."
