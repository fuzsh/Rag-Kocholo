        "text": "What Influences the Purchase of Savings Bonds?\n\nPublic demand for savings bonds has varied over time. Changes in interest rates or inflation can make bonds an attractive investment relative to other alternatives. In addition, investors may be motivated by the idea of supporting a national cause like a war effort or government project.\n\nSavings Bonds History\n\nThe sale of U.S. Treasury marketable securities began with the nationâs founding, where private citizens purchased $27 million in government bonds to finance the Revolutionary War.2 These early loans to the government were introduced to raise funds from the American public to support war efforts as well as other national projects like the construction of the Panama Canal.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, the U.S. government sought to stabilize the economy by issuing a new type of Treasury security: savings bonds. In 1935, savings bonds were first introduced to promote thriftiness and allow individuals to purchase government-backed bonds at an affordable price. For many decades, the minimum purchase price for marketable securities was several thousand dollars, which meant that only very wealthy individuals and institutions could afford to invest in them. With the introduction of the first savings bonds, regular citizens were able to invest in Treasury securities, and they gained popularity as a âsafe havenâ during times of economic uncertainty.\n\nPoster advertising savings bonds as âsavings plans for all Americans.â\n\nIn 1963, President John F. Kennedy aimed to encourage the purchase of savings bonds by establishing the U.S. Industrial Payroll Savings Committee. This committee encouraged workers to automatically invest a portion of their paycheck in what was known as the Payroll Savings Plan, which reduced paper certificates, and moved to an electronic record-keeping system. This new program was accompanied by nationwide marketing and helped increase the profile of the savings bond program in subsequent decades.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy holds a U.S. savings bond.\n\nThe chart below shows savings bond sales over time for all savings bond types.\n\nSavings Bonds Sold by Type Over Time, FY 1935 â FYTD undefined\n\nA - DEEEFGHHHIJK\n\nSavings bonds were most popular in and when $ 0 M and $ 0 M bonds were sold, respectively.\n\nInterest Rates and Inflation\n\nThe economy can also influence the popularity of investing in savings bonds. In times of heightened economic uncertainty, individual investors may favor savings bonds due to their low risk, even if they produce a more modest return. Conversely, economic growth may create attractive investment opportunities outside of savings bonds, where individual investors may be able to earn higher interest rates.\n\nIn general, when interest rates are higher, demand for fixed-rate savings bonds like Series EE tends to increase. However, when people expect inflation to increase, savings bonds like Series I become attractive because they provide protection against inflation, preserving the value of the money invested. In the spring of 2021, inflation in the United States began to rise over three percent and would grow to over six percent by September 2022. In response, the American public invested heavily in Series I bonds, purchasing nearly $153 billion of Series I bonds between April 2021 and February 2023. The chart below shows inflation data and I bond purchases from the last 15 years.\n\nGenerally, higher inflation rates are correlated with an increase in demand for inflation-protected securities like I bonds.\n\nWhat Happens when Savings Bonds are Fully Matured?\n\nA savings bond can be redeemed anytime after at least one year; however, the longer a bond is held (up to 30 years), the more it earns. When a savings bond is redeemed after five years, the owner receives the original value plus all accrued interest. If a bond is redeemed before five years, the holder loses the last three months of interest.\n\nOccasionally, bond owners hold onto bonds after they have reached maturity and are no longer earning interest. These outstanding but unredeemed bonds are called Matured Unredeemed Debt (MUD). The government continues to be responsible for this debt, as it may be redeemed at any time. Therefore, the Treasury has increased efforts to encourage bondholders to redeem their matured savings bonds. As of January 1970 , there were NaN million matured unredeemed savings bonds held by investors.\n\nIf bonds are held past their maturity date, the bonds can lose value due to inflation. To understand how this value is lost, see the illustration below.\n\nHow Holding onto Matured Bonds can Cost You Money\n\nImagine you bought a series EE bond 30 years ago for $500. After 20 years, it doubled in value ($1,000) and continued to earn interest ($600) until reaching maturity after 30 years.\n\nIf you redeem your bond today, you can redeem it for $1,600 and spend that on goods or services or reinvest that money in a new savings bond.\n\nIf you hold onto that bond and donât redeem it for another 10 years, it will still be worth $1,600, but the same goods and services you would have purchased 10 years ago now cost $2,050, effectively losing you $450 in value.\n\nCould there be a savings bond in your name that you might not know about? Go on a Treasure Hunt and see what bonds might be waiting for you to cash in!\n\nWhat is the Treasury Doing to Reduce Matured Unredeemed Debt?\n\ntoggle contents"
