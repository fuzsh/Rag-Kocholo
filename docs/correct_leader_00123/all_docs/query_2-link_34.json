        "text": "How to Use\n\n1. Three\n\nAfter the lesson, have each student record three things he or she learned from the lesson.\n\n2. Two\n\nNext, have students record two things that they found interesting and that they’d like to learn more about.\n\n3. One\n\nThen, have students record one question they still have about the material.\n\n4. Review\n\nFinally, the most important step is to review the students’ responses. You can use this information to help develop future lessons and determine if some of the material needs to be taught again.\n\n*For Primary Grades PK-1, this strategy should be used in whole-group rather than as an independent task, with the teacher charting ideas. Of course, since many children will want to participate, there might be more than 3-2-1 ideas/questions in each section.\n\nWhen to Use\n\nUse Three-Two-One at any time during a lesson to encourage students to think about their learning:\n\nAs a Check for Understanding during any portion of the lesson\n\nDuring class discussions as a way for students to record their thoughts\n\nAs a closing activity so that students can review what was learned in the lesson\n\nAs an exit ticket at the end of the class period\n\nVariations\n\nCompare and Contrast 3-2-1\n\nAs a way to compare and contrast, have students record three similarities between two items, two differences, and one question they still have about them.\n\nReading 3-2-1\n\nWhen reading, have students record three of the most important ideas from the text, two supporting details for each of the ideas, and one question they have about each of the ideas.\n\nPyramid 3-2-1\n\nHave the students create a triangle and divide it into three sections horizontally. In the bottom section, the students record three things they learned for the day. In the middle section, the students record two questions they have. In the top section, the students describe how the information learned is applicable to their everyday lives.\n\nAcademic Vocabulary 3-2-1\n\nTo increase comprehension and use of academic language, ask students to explore a concept through 3-2-1. First, have them speak with a partner. Provide the structure for 3 minutes of conversation using targeted academic language. Then, ask students to write 2 sentences using the language. Finally, have students read 1 paragraph which contains the targeted vocabulary."
