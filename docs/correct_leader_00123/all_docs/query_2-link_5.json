        "text": "Diohe'ko, the Three Sisters, had been cultivated for at least five hundred years prior to contact by the Seneca, an Iroquoian tribe inhabiting western New York State. The Three Sisters, corn, beans and squash (pumpkins, gourds), were planted together in hills in fields, cultivated and harvested by work parties of women….The Three Sisters was an important cultural complex. The Sisters are protagonists of a number of Seneca tales, myths, ceremonies and legends. p. 76\n\nAmong the Senecas, in planting corn the seeds of the squash and bean were sown in every seventh hill because it was thought that the sprits of these three plants were inseparable. They were called Diohe'ko, these sustain us. In the Green Corn Thanksgiving the leader rises and says, 'Diettino'nio dioke'ko, we give thanks to our sustainers.'\n\nCertain woman banded themselves together in a society called the Tonwisas or Towisas Oa'no. The propitiated the spirits of the three sisters by certain ceremonies. In their ceremonial march, Wenuntonwisas, the leader holding an armful of corn and a cake of corn bread leads her band in a measured march about a kettle of corn soup about a kettle of corn soup. p. 27\n\nThe technique for planting the Three Sisters spread from Mesoamerica northward over many generations, eventually becoming widespread throughout North America. Indigenous farmers saved the best seeds for the following season, resulting in a wide variety of cultivars perfectly suited for the environments in which they were grown. Much of this diversity was sadly lost as indigenous nations were forced out of their ancestral lands by early European settlers and mainstream agricultural practices took hold.\n\nIn the area that is now considered northern New York, the Haudenosaunee made great use of companion planting and the Three Sisters were an important part of their diet. Known as the Iroquois by the French and the Six Nations by the British, the Haudenosaunee existed as a matrilineal democratic form of government in North America long before European incursion. The Haudenosaunee considered the Three Sisters to be divine gifts. Some versions of their legends involve the crops personified as three women who separate from each other only to find out that they are stronger together.\n\nThe Iroquois agricultural system was based on the hill-planting method. Iroquois women, who were responsible for farming, placed several kernels of corn in a hole. As the small seedlings began to grow, the farmers returned periodically to mound the soil around the young plants, ultimately creating a hill one foot high and two feet wide. The hills were arranged in rows about one step apart.\n\nIroquois women mixed their crops, using a system called \"interplanting.\" Two or three weeks after the corn was planted, the women returned to plant bean seeds in the same hills. The beans contributed nitrogen to the soil, and the cornstalks served as bean poles. Between the rows, the farmers cultivated a low-growing crop such as squash or pumpkins, the leaves of which shaded the ground, preserving moisture and inhibiting weed growth.\n\nBy the time Europeans reached the shores of the Americas, the Indigenous peoples of the northern continent had developed food systems that efficiently utilized their abundant landscape to provide a relatively nutritious diet ….Three sisters agriculture also developed as a central food system in both the North and the Southeast. The Iroquois and the Cherokee called corn, bean, and squash the three sisters' because they nurture each other like family when planted together. These agriculturalists placed corn in small hills planting beans around them and interspersing squash throughout of the field. Beans naturally absorb nitrogen from the air and convert it to nitrates, fertilizing the soil for the corn and squash. In return, they are supported by winding around the corn stalks. The squash leaves provide ground cover between the corn and beans, preventing weeds from taking over the field. These three plants thrive together better than when they are planted alone.\n\nIn 1619, an English ship landed on the shores of the Powhatan confederacy, or, as the English called it, Point Comfort, Virginia. The ship delivered stolen people onto stolen land. This was a first step in founding today’s U.S. food system. Until that time, the people of North America and West Africa had lived off the land for millennia, foraging, hunting, and cultivating food. But 400 years ago, the twin European colonial influences of invasion and enslavement entwined the lives and, to some extent, the foodways of Native Americans and West Africans in what is now the U.S.\n\nSome Indigenous Peoples of the Americas planted corn, beans and squash or pumpkins together in mounds, in an intercropping complex known to some as the Three Sisters. Corn provided support for beans, beans provided nitrogen through nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria that live on the roots, and squash and pumpkins provided ground cover to suppress weeds and inhibit evaporation from the soil. While the origins of the Three Sisters complex are unknown, veneration of the Three Sisters appears in the earliest accounts of European explorers and missionaries in North America. As described by Lewandowski, from its earliest appearance in written records, the Three Sisters complex was not simply an agricultural strategy or technology, but a cultural complex, complete with stories, ceremonies, technology, customs and etiquette.\n\nArchaeological evidence dates the adoption of the Three Sisters complex in North America to 1070 AD. The complex was adapted to local conditions over the 500 years before contact with Europeans, so much so that it was the dominant food plant association of every nation practising agriculture in the northeast USA as well as in several other parts of North America, including southern regions of Quebec and Ontario, Canada. The Indigenous Peoples practising Three Sisters agriculture in the northeastern USA and southeastern Canada included those from at least fifteen nations. p, 2\n\nThree sisters agriculture also developed as a central food system in both the North and the Southeast. The Iroquois and the Cherokee called corn, bean, and squash “the three sisters” because they nurture each other like family when planted together. These agriculturalists placed corn in small hills planting beans around them and interspersing squash throughout of the field. Beans naturally absorb nitrogen from the air and convert it to nitrates, fertilizing the soil for the corn and squash. In return, they are supported by winding around the corn stalks. The squash leaves provide ground cover between the corn and beans, preventing weeds from taking over the field. These three plants thrive together better than when they are planted alone.\n\nPolycropping maize, bean, and squash has a long history in the Western Hemisphere. Evidence for each of these crops extends back millennia in Central and South America (e.g., Dillehay et al. 2007; Kaplan and Lynch 1999; Piperno and Flannery 2001; Smith 1997) while there are much shorter histories in the North American Southwest, Plains, and East (e.g., Adair 2003; Asch and Hart 2004; Fish 2003; Schneider 2002). However, it does appear that whenever these three crops were available, they were in some manner grown and eaten together (Mt. Pleasant 2006). In fact soon after Europeans arrived in the Western Hemisphere, the three crops were transplanted to Europe and Africa, where they were also often grown and eaten together (e.g.,McCann 2004; Paris 2000; Paris et al. 2006; Rebourg et al. 2004; Zevon 1997). p. 87.\n\nFor centuries, many Native American tribes throughout North America have cultivated corn, beans, and squash. The term 'Three Sisters' was primarily used by the Iroquois who live in the Northeastern United States and Canada. These crops were considered to be special gifts from Great Spirit and were believed to be protected by the Three Sisters-spirits collectively called the De-o-ha-ko, meaning 'our sustainers' or 'those who support us' (Eames-Sheavly, 1993).\n\nThis ancient style of companion planting has played a key role in the survival of all people in North America. Grown together, these plants are able to thrive and provide high-yield, high-quality crops with a minimal environmental impact. Corn, beans, and squash have a unique symbiotic relationship in a Native American garden. Corn offers a structure for the beans to climb. The beans, in turn, help to replenish the soil with nutrients. And the large leaves of squash and pumpkin vines provide living mulch that conserves water and provides weed control.\n\nThe Three Sisters system refers to the planting of corn, pole beans, and squash or pumpkins together in hills. The practice of planting more than one type of crop together is called interplanting. Although this planting system is not common in the United States today, it is in fact a well-thought-out growing method that is used extensively in other countries such as Mexico. Interplanting is corning back into favor for some crops because farmers are finding that large plantings of one crop can have some major disadvantages…. lnterplanting has many advantages. Iroquois farmers adapted this ecological planting method to meet the needs of their crops and their people. Interplanted crops are not as attractive to pests, while large plantings of one crop tend to have more pest problems. The hills provide support around the base of the plants, so they are not as prone to damage from wind. Also, interplanting helps create a uniform stand of corn. The corn forms a support for the beans, and the squash covers the soil. helping to control weeds. p. 3\n\nThe milpa system is the classic example of an efficient multi/mixed-cropping system, which tends to be more productive and efficient in use of light, nutrients and water than monocrop systems, given its internal dynamics of complementarity, competition and facilitation. For example, the mechanisms of interspecific root interactions where maize root exudates promote nodulation of the faba bean, making maize-faba intercrops more efficient than their monocrops have been described.\n\n…maize/soybean intercropping is a promising practice to meet the challenge of sustainable development and food security. It is important not only for smallholder agriculture in developing countries, e.g. in Africa, to meet demands for calories and protein (Snapp et al., 2010), but also for organic farming and land sparing in developing countries (Fischer et al., 2008; Phalan et al., 2011). Maize/soybean intercropping can result in major increases in the efficiency of land and N fertilizer use, but this potential is largely untapped in contemporary farming in developed countries…. A multidisciplinary multi-actor approach will be needed, with involvement of stakeholders, to bring these potential advantages of intercropping of maize and soybean to practice.\n\nThis publication is a summary of the records of food plants used by the Indians of the United States and Canada which have appeared in ethnobotanical publications during a period of nearly 80 years. This compilation, for which all accessible literature has been searched, was drawn up as a preliminary to work by the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils on the chemical constituents and food value of native North American plants. In a compilation of this sort, in which it is impossible to authenticate most of the botanical identifications because of the unavailability of the specimens on which they were based, occasional errors are unavoidable. All the botanical names given have been reviewed in the light of our present knowledge of plant distribution, however, and it is believed that obvious errors of identification have been eliminated. The list finds its justification as a convenient summary of the extensive literature and is to be used subject to confirmation and correction. In every instance brief references are made to the original authorities for the information cited.\n\nThe soy bean may be satisfactorily grown in combination with other farm crops. Although the chief advantage, perhaps, is a better balanced ration, the results of experiments indicate a larger yield of forage, as well as a greater variety….Soy beans are more generally grown with corn than with any other crop. Various methods of growing the two crops are practiced in different areas of the country. The beans may be planted in the same hills with the corn, in alternate hills with corn in the same row, in alternate rows of each, or there may be two rows of each.\" p. 18\n\nIntercropping with legumes—that is, growing some leguminous crop between the rows of intertilled crops, such as corn or cotton—is the simplest system of growing crops for soil improvement. This practice is an inexpensive and easy means of increasing crop yields, yet, while common in many sections, is not followed to the extent that it should be. The continuous growing of any one intertilled crop on the same land for a succession of years is not good farm practice; but where this is the custom, as is the case in many sections, the practice of intercropping with legumes will frequently keep a sufficient supply of humus in the land to maintain crop yields.\n\nCorn lends itself better to the practice of intercropping than any other crop of this region, and it is with the corn crop that the greatest possibilities are offered for soil improvement by this system. Crops used in this region for intercropping are cowpeas, soy beans, peanuts, velvet beans, and beggar weed.\" p. 19.\n\nCrop systems for Arkansas that make for increased food productions and increased efficiency in man labor and horse labor are described in the following pages. By the introduction of cowpeas, soy beans, and other legumes, and by second cropping, provision is made for a considerable increase in the number of crop acres that can be farmed by the average family. Thus, two men with a team, who under a cotton and corn system can farm but 33 acres of land, can handle 50 acres and raise 62 acres of crops under a system providing for a 4-year rotation, including (1) cotton with a winter cover crop, (2) cowpeas, (3) oats or wheat followed by cowpeas, and (4) corn."
