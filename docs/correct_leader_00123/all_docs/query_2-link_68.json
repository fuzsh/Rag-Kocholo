        "text": "Limit on Contributions\n\nThe amount you or any other person can contribute to your HSA depends on the type of HDHP coverage you have, your age, the date you become an eligible individual, and the date you cease to be an eligible individual. For 2023, if you have self-only HDHP coverage, you can contribute up to $3,850. If you have family HDHP coverage, you can contribute up to $7,750.\n\n. For 2024, if you have self-only HDHP coverage, you can contribute up to $4,150. If you have family HDHP coverage, you can contribute up to $8,300..\n\nIf you are, or were considered (under the last-month rule, discussed later), an eligible individual for the entire year and didn’t change your type of coverage, you can contribute the full amount based on your type of coverage. However, if you weren’t an eligible individual for the entire year or changed your coverage during the year, your contribution limit is the greater of:\n\nThe limitation shown on the Line 3 Limitation Chart and Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 8889, Health Savings Accounts (HSAs); or\n\nThe maximum annual HSA contribution based on your HDHP coverage (self-only or family) on the first day of the last month of your tax year.\n\n. If you had family HDHP coverage on the first day of the last month of your tax year, your contribution limit for 2023 is $7,750 even if you changed coverage during the year..\n\nLast-month rule.\n\nUnder the last-month rule, if you are an eligible individual on the first day of the last month of your tax year (December 1 for most taxpayers), you are considered an eligible individual for the entire year. You are treated as having the same HDHP coverage for the entire year as you had on the first day of the last month if you didn’t otherwise have coverage.\n\nTesting period.\n\nIf contributions were made to your HSA based on you being an eligible individual for the entire year under the last-month rule, you must remain an eligible individual during the testing period. For the last-month rule, the testing period begins with the last month of your tax year and ends on the last day of the 12th month following that month (for example, December 1, 2023, through December 31, 2024).\n\nIf you fail to remain an eligible individual during the testing period, for reasons other than death or becoming disabled, you will have to include in income the total contributions made to your HSA that wouldn’t have been made except for the last-month rule. You include this amount in your income in the year in which you fail to be an eligible individual. This amount is also subject to a 10% additional tax. The income and additional tax are calculated on Form 8889, Part III.\n\nExample 1.\n\nYou, age 53, become an eligible individual on December 1, 2023. You have family HDHP coverage on that date. Under the last-month rule, you contribute $7,750 to your HSA.\n\nYou fail to be an eligible individual in June 2024. Because you didn’t remain an eligible individual during the testing period (December 1, 2023, through December 31, 2024), you must include in your 2024 income the contributions made in 2023 that wouldn’t have been made except for the last-month rule. You use the worksheet in the Form 8889 instructions to determine this amount.\n\nJanuary -0- February -0- March -0- April -0- May -0- June -0- July -0- August -0- September -0- October -0- November -0- December $7,750.00 Total for all months $7,750.00 Limitation. Divide the total by 12 $645.83\n\nYou would include $7,104.17 ($7,750.00 − $645.83) in your gross income on your 2024 tax return. Also, a 10% additional tax applies to this amount.\n\nExample 2.\n\nYou, age 39, have self-only HDHP coverage on January 1, 2023. You change to family HDHP coverage on November 1, 2023. Because you have family HDHP coverage on December 1, 2023, you contribute $7,750 for 2023.\n\nYou fail to be an eligible individual in March 2024. Because you didn’t remain an eligible individual during the testing period (December 1, 2023, through December 31, 2024), you must include in income the contribution made that wouldn’t have been made except for the last-month rule. You use the worksheet in the Form 8889 instructions to determine this amount.\n\nJanuary $3,850.00 February $3,850.00 March $3,850.00 April $3,850.00 May $3,850.00 June $3,850.00 July $3,850.00 August $3,850.00 September $3,850.00 October $3,850.00 November $7,750.00 December $7,750.00 Total for all months $54,000.00 Limitation. Divide the total by 12 $4,500.00\n\nYou would include $3,250.00 ($7,750.00 − $4,500.00) in your gross income on your 2024 tax return. Also, a 10% additional tax applies to this amount.\n\nAdditional contribution.\n\nIf you are an eligible individual who is age 55 or older at the end of your tax year, your contribution limit is increased by $1,000. For example, if you have self-only coverage, you can contribute up to $4,850 (the contribution limit for self-only coverage ($3,850) plus the additional contribution of $1,000). However, see Enrolled in Medicare, later.\n\n. If you have more than one HSA in 2023, your total contributions to all the HSAs can’t be more than the limits discussed earlier. .\n\nReduction of contribution limit.\n\nYou must reduce the amount that can be contributed (including any additional contribution) to your HSA by the amount of any contribution made to your Archer MSA (including employer contributions) for the year. A special rule applies to married people, discussed next, if each spouse has family coverage under an HDHP.\n\nRules for married people.\n\nIf either spouse has family HDHP coverage, both spouses are treated as having family HDHP coverage. If each spouse has family coverage under a separate plan, the contribution limit for 2023 is $7,750. You must reduce the limit on contributions, before taking into account any additional contributions, by the amount contributed to both spouses’ Archer MSAs. After that reduction, the contribution limit is split equally between the spouses unless you agree on a different division.\n\n. The rules for married people apply only if both spouses are eligible individuals..\n\nIf both spouses are 55 or older and not enrolled in Medicare, each spouse’s contribution limit is increased by the additional contribution. If both spouses meet the age requirement, the total contributions under family coverage can’t be more than $9,750. Each spouse must make the additional contribution to its own HSA.\n\nExample.\n\nFor 2023, you and your spouse are both eligible individuals. You each have family coverage under separate HDHPs. You are 58 years old and your spouse is 53. You and your spouse can split the family contribution limit ($7,750) equally or you can agree on a different division. If you split it equally, you can contribute $4,875 to an HSA (one-half the maximum contribution for family coverage ($3,875) + $1,000 additional contribution) and your spouse can contribute $3,875 to an HSA.\n\nEmployer contributions.\n\nYou must reduce the amount you, or any other person, can contribute to your HSA by the amount of any contributions made by your employer that are excludable from your income. This includes amounts contributed to your account by your employer through a cafeteria plan.\n\nEnrolled in Medicare.\n\nBeginning with the first month you are enrolled in Medicare, your contribution limit is zero. This rule applies to periods of retroactive Medicare coverage. So, if you delayed applying for Medicare and later your enrollment is backdated, any contributions to your HSA made during the period of retroactive coverage are considered excess. See Excess contributions, later.\n\nExample.\n\nYou turned age 65 in July 2023 and enrolled in Medicare. You had an HDHP with self-only coverage and are eligible for an additional contribution of $1,000. Your contribution limit is $2,425 ($4,850 × 6 ÷ 12).\n\nQualified HSA funding distribution.\n\nA qualified HSA funding distribution may be made from your traditional IRA or Roth IRA to your HSA. This distribution can’t be made from an ongoing SEP IRA or SIMPLE IRA. For this purpose, a SEP IRA or SIMPLE IRA is ongoing if an employer contribution is made for the plan year ending with or within the tax year in which the distribution would be made.\n\nThe maximum qualified HSA funding distribution depends on the HDHP coverage (self-only or family) you have on the first day of the month in which the contribution is made and your age as of the end of the tax year. The distribution must be made directly by the trustee of the IRA to the trustee of the HSA. The distribution isn’t included in your income, isn’t deductible, and reduces the amount that can be contributed to your HSA. The qualified HSA funding distribution is shown on Form 8889 for the year in which the distribution is made.\n\nYou can generally make only one qualified HSA funding distribution during your lifetime. However, if you make a distribution during a month when you have self-only HDHP coverage, you can make another qualified HSA funding distribution in a later month in that tax year if you change to family HDHP coverage. The total qualified HSA funding distribution can’t be more than the contribution limit for family HDHP coverage plus any additional contribution to which you are entitled.\n\nExample.\n\nIn 2023, you are an eligible individual, age 57, with self-only HDHP coverage. You can make a qualified HSA funding distribution of $4,850 ($3,850 plus $1,000 additional contribution).\n\nFunding distribution—testing period.\n\nYou must remain an eligible individual during the testing period. For a qualified HSA funding distribution, the testing period begins with the month in which the qualified HSA funding distribution is contributed and ends on the last day of the 12th month following that month. For example, if a qualified HSA funding distribution is contributed to your HSA on August 10, 2023, your testing period begins in August 2023, and ends on August 31, 2024.\n\nIf you fail to remain an eligible individual during the testing period, for reasons other than death or becoming disabled, you will have to include in income the qualified HSA funding distribution. You include this amount in income in the year in which you fail to be an eligible individual. This amount is also subject to a 10% additional tax. The income and the additional tax are calculated on Form 8889, Part III.\n\nEach qualified HSA funding distribution allowed has its own testing period. For example, you are an eligible individual, age 45, with self-only HDHP coverage. On June 18, 2023, you make a qualified HSA funding distribution. On July 27, 2023, you enroll in family HDHP coverage and on August 17, 2023, you make a qualified HSA funding distribution. Your testing period for the first distribution begins in June 2023 and ends on June 30, 2024. Your testing period for the second distribution begins in August 2023 and ends on August 31, 2024.\n\nThe testing period rule that applies under the last-month rule (discussed earlier) doesn’t apply to amounts contributed to an HSA through a qualified HSA funding distribution. If you remain an eligible individual during the entire funding distribution testing period, then no amount of that distribution is included in income and won’t be subject to the additional tax for failing to meet the last-month rule testing period.\n\nReporting Contributions on Your Return\n\nContributions made by your employer aren’t included in your income. Contributions to an employee’s account by an employer using the amount of an employee’s salary reduction through a cafeteria plan are treated as employer contributions. Generally, you can claim contributions you made and contributions made by any other person, other than your employer, on your behalf, as a deduction.\n\nContributions by a partnership to a bona fide partner’s HSA aren’t contributions by an employer. The contributions are treated as a distribution of money and aren’t included in the partner’s gross income. Contributions by a partnership to a partner’s HSA for services rendered are treated as guaranteed payments that are deductible by the partnership and includible in the partner’s gross income. In both situations, the partner can deduct the contribution made to the partner’s HSA.\n\nContributions by an S corporation to a 2% shareholder-employee’s HSA for services rendered are treated as guaranteed payments and are deductible by the S corporation and includible in the shareholder-employee’s gross income. The shareholder-employee can deduct the contribution made to the shareholder-employee’s HSA.\n\nForm 8889.\n\nReport all contributions to your HSA on Form 8889 and file it with your Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. You should include all contributions made for 2023, including those made from January 1, 2024, through April 15, 2024, that are designated for 2023. Contributions made by your employer and qualified HSA funding distributions are also shown on the form.\n\nYou should receive Form 5498-SA, HSA, Archer MSA, or Medicare Advantage MSA Information, from the trustee showing the amount contributed to your HSA during the year. Your employer’s contributions will also be shown on Form W-2, box 12, code W. Follow the Instructions for Form 8889. Report your HSA deduction on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.\n\nExcess contributions.\n\nYou will have excess contributions if the contributions to your HSA for the year are greater than the limits discussed earlier. Excess contributions aren’t deductible. Excess contributions made by your employer are included in your gross income. If the excess contribution isn’t included in box 1 of Form W-2, you must report the excess as “Other income” on your tax return.\n\nGenerally, you must pay a 6% excise tax on excess contributions. See Form 5329, Additional Taxes on Qualified Plans (Including IRAs) and Other Tax-Favored Accounts, to figure the excise tax. The excise tax applies to each tax year the excess contribution remains in the account.\n\nYou may withdraw some or all of the excess contributions and avoid paying the excise tax on the amount withdrawn if you meet the following conditions.\n\nYou withdraw the excess contributions by the due date, including extensions, of your tax return for the year the contributions were made.\n\nYou withdraw any income earned on the withdrawn contributions and include the earnings in “Other income” on your tax return for the year you withdraw the contributions and earnings.\n\n. If you fail to remain an eligible individual during any of the testing periods, discussed earlier, the amount you have to include in income isn’t an excess contribution. If you withdraw any of those amounts, the amount is treated the same as any other distribution from an HSA, discussed later..\n\nDeducting an excess contribution in a later year.\n\nYou may be able to deduct excess contributions for previous years that are still in your HSA. The excess contribution you can deduct for the current year is the lesser of the following two amounts.\n\nYour maximum HSA contribution limit for the year minus any amounts contributed to your HSA for the year.\n\nThe total excess contributions in your HSA at the beginning of the year.\n\nAmounts contributed for the year include contributions by you, your employer, and any other person. They also include any qualified HSA funding distribution made to your HSA. Any excess contribution remaining at the end of a tax year is subject to the excise tax. See Form 5329."
