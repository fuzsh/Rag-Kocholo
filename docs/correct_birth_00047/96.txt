During a recent visit to Tennessee, I stopped by Sevier County to check out its courthouse. Sevierville, Tennessee, is the birthplace of Dolly Parton, and the community celebrates her connection to the town by hosting a life-size bronze statue on the county courthouse grounds. According to one resource, Ms. Parton has commented, “One of the best things that ever happened to me in my whole career is the statue of me in the courthouse yard in Sevierville.”

In addition to its most famous modern resident, Sevier County has an interesting history. The town and county are named after John Sevier, a noted frontiersman, and Tennessee’s first governor. Sevier also governed over the failed state of Franklin in the 1780s. Before the arrival of European settlers, the Cherokee people had become well-established in this area over centuries.
