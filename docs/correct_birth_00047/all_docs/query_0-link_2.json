        "text": "Locust Ridge, Tennessee\n\nIn my Tennessee mountain home\n\nLife is as peaceful as a baby's sigh\n\nIn my Tennessee mountain home\n\nCrickets sing in the fields near by\n\nfrom \"My Tennessee Mountain Home\" by Dolly Parton\n\nParton's childhood home was in Locust Ridge, nestled in the Great Smoky Mountains of East Tennessee. A photograph of the house was featured on her album My Tennessee Mountain Home in 1973, and the song of the same title celebrated her memories of it. The location was isolated and rural, and as Parton noted in her autobiography, \"I grew up poor - very poor.\"\n\nFinding Locust Ridge on the Original Map\n\nThe complete map of Great Smoky Mountains National Park and vicinity is substantially larger than the section shown above. If you are interested in locating Locust Ridge for yourself, the section outlined in red on the map to the left is the part detailed above. On the map, Locust Ridge is northeast of Gatlinburg and southeast of Sevierville, the two closest cities, and north of the northernmost boundaries of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, near the Webb Mountains. This map was created in 1953 and shows what the area was like when Parton was a child.\n\nAdditional Maps of Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n\nThrough the online collections of Geography and Map Reading Room of the Library of Congress, it is possible to view additional maps of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee.
