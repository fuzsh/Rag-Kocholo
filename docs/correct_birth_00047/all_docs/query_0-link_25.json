But that's not the only place you can see Dolly's twee childhood house because a replica of it has been made for a very good reason.\n\nWATCH: Dolly Parton dresses up for her husband's birthday - and wow\n\nWhen designing her theme park, Dollywood, the star decided she wanted to reconstruct her family home for people to view. She has even included trinkets taken from her home and the attention to detail is seriously impressive.\n\nMORE: Dolly Parton reveals exciting new role in Netflix series - and fans will be thrilled\n\nMORE: Dolly Parton's Nashville home with husband Carl is not what you'd expect\n\nThe country star has even joked that she's spent millions making the place look like $50!\n\nDolly has made a replica of her childhood cabin\n\nThis humble abode had a profound effect on Dolly, and she even sang a song about her childhood home, it is called My Tennessee Mountain Home.\n\nSince 1999, Dolly has lived in the same home in Brentwood, Nashville, and she purchased it for $400,000 (Â£283,100). She shares it with her husband, Carl Dean, and according to the Kiwi Report, it features its own tennis court, swimming pool, chapel and a farm.\n\nDollywood has cost millions to build\n\nIt is a world away from her childhood home, but the star is keen to keep the feel of the place traditional with lots of authentic wood and rustic furnishings.\n\nThe star now lives in Nashville\n\nDolly has her very own music room, complete with a black piano. It's decorated with cream walls and patterned green carpet, as well as ruched floral blinds.\n\nShe also has enough room for all her amazing awards and one day she showed off a room filled with accolades, complete with a large painting honouring her achievement of selling 100 million records worldwide."
