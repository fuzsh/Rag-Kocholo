        "text": "Now you can create your own ‘Smoky Mountain Memories’ at HeartSong Lodge & Resort in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee\n\nTennessee’s Great Smoky Mountains have always held a special place in Dolly Parton’s heart.\n\nBorn and raised in Locust Ridge, just a hop, skip, and a mountain jump away from Dollywood, the iconic singer-songwriter just opened a new hotel called HeartSong Lodge & Resort which officially opened to the public on November 3rd. Set in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee directly next to Dollywood’s original resort, Dollywood’s DreamMore Resort and Spa, the new 302-room hotel was inspired by Parton’s love of all things Smokies and the all-consuming nature that abounds in America’s most visited National Park.\n\n“Dollywood’s HeartSong Lodge & Resort takes me back to when I was a little girl exploring my beautiful Smoky Mountains,” Parton said in statement. “I have so many fond memories of the days when us kids spent hours playing in the creek and chasing fireflies after supper. I hope families who come to my HeartSong Lodge discover what makes these mountains so special to me, while creating their own precious memories.”\n\nNature is very much the through line of the new resort, and that theme is carried out in each and every one of the hotel’s 302 rooms and suites. Offering a variety of room types that can accomodate families or groups, kids can look forward to bunk beds with private televisions designed just for them.\n\nEach guest room features a Smoky Mountain mural showcasing animals from black bears, butterflies, and fireflies, and is equipped with a mini-fridge and customizable sound machine that generates the soothing sounds of nature. For something truly special, the HeartSong Suite is an apartment-style accommodation that boasts views of the lodge’s pool area and the surrounding Smoky Mountains.\n\nThe hotel offers an array of on-site amenities available to guests and non-guests alike. From indoor and outdoor pools, and complimentary trolley service to Dollywood, the hotel is an ideal jumping off point to explore the very best the area has to offer. Above, The Cove is the resorts outdoor pool area and features cozy fire pits and a zero-depth entry pool with a cascading waterfall, splash pad, hot tub, and seasonal pool-side dining.\n\nWith design touches and decor inspired by Dolly Parton herself, the lobby’s stone fireplace and floor to ceiling windows create an inviting atmosphere to sit and visit for a while.\n\nAt HeartSong’s Acoustic Lobby— a private dining room that’s been designed with detailed touches of the entertainment icon — includes a glittering chandelier made from acoustic guitars and is a great place to post up and enjoy a signature Dollywood cocktails.\n\nAs far as dining goes, the resort’s full-service signature restaurant Ember & Elm offers à la carte breakfast and dinner menus that specialize in Southern classics from fried green tomatoes and deviled eggs three ways to she crab bisque and ham and peach burrata.\n\nNext to Ember & Elm, the resort’s fast casual all-day dining option High Note and grab-and-go concept Songbird Market offer a selection of snacks as well as the chance to sink you teeth into Dollywood’s world-famous cinnamon bread.\n\nThe starting rate for HeartSong Lodge & Resort is $319 plus tax and fees."
