        "text": "Profession: Country Singer\n\nBiography: Dolly Parton, who was born one of 12 children to a poor sharecropper in Tennessee's Great Smoky Mountains, went on to build a career as one of the most beloved singer-songwriters in country music.\n\nParton began her music career as a songwriter in Nashville before being picked to sing in Porter Wagoner's variety show. A series of popular duets by the two followed before Parton broke out fully on her own in 1974. Her famous single \"I Will Always Love You\", later sung by Whitney Houston, is about this period and went to number one on the Country Chart.\n\nParton's music has spanned a wide range from bluegrass to gospel to pop crossover. Some of her most successful singles include \"Joelene\" (1973), the theme song to the 1980 film \"9 to 5\" (in which she starred with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin), and the duet \"Islands in the Stream\" with fellow country star Kenny Rogers.\n\nParton is the recipient of numerous awards, including eleven Grammy awards and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011. She was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in 1969 and Country Music Hall of Fame in 1999. In 2022, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nBorn: January 19, 1946\n\nBirthplace: Sevierville, Tennessee, USA\n\nAge: 78 years old"
