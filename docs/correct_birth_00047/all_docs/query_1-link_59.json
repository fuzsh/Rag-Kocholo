Often referred to as the “Gateway to the Smokies,” it is the place to stay for all your Great Smoky Mountain adventures. There are many things you may not know about this area, like where it got its name and what its vibe is all about. Here is the inside scoop and guide with the top seven facts about Sevierville that we bet you didn’t know.\n\n1.

John Sevier first served as the State of Franklin’s governor, and then later became the governor of North Carolina. He then was the governor of Tennessee twice over, totaling about 11 years.
