Anchored by the impressive 1890’s courthouse with its statue of the country music superstar on the front lawn, a number of mom and pop businesses including casual and fine dining restaurants have opened inside historic century-old buildings. Colorful murals painted on the outside of buildings compliment a streetscape makeover designed to look like the early 1900s. On this special episode, I return to my native East Tennessee to explore the \"new again\" gem of the Smoky Mountains - Sevierville, Tennessee."
