        "text": "Parton is the fourth of 12 children born to Robert and Avie Lee Parton of Sevierville, Tennessee. Her family was so poor that grain was all her father had to give the doctor who delivered her.\n\nOgle has been by Parton's side through thick and thin. \"We still just have a great friendship and relationship and I love her as much as I love anybody in the whole world,\" Parton told ABC News in 2012.\n\nParton first laid eyes on the Man in Black as a young teen singing at Nashville's Grand Ole' Opry. \"I was sitting in the audience and that's when I first knew about sex appeal,\" Parton told Nightline. \"He had this tick when he moved his shoulder… and it was still sexy. It still got to me.\"\n\nEver since leaving Sevierville at 18, Parton has been committed to helping the people in her hometown—and she's made good on that promise, in part by opening the lucrative amusement park.\n\nParton got the inspiration for her big, blonde hair and pouty red lips from a local lady of the night. \"I had never seen anybody, you know, with the yellow hair all piled up and the red lipstick and the rouge and the high heeled shoes, and I thought, 'This is what I want to look like,'\" she said in a 2012 interview.\n\nParton's brother Randy and sister Cassie, along with her nieces, star in the regular Dollywood show \"My People.\" Sisters Stella Parton and Freida Parton (shown above) as well as Rachel Dennison have also had singing careers.\n\nParton \"over-exaggerated\" her look for the competition, making her beauty mark, eyes and hair bigger, but was no match for the \"beautiful drag queens [who] had worked for weeks and months getting their clothes.\" She told ABC News she got the least applause. \"They just thought I was some little short gay guy,\" she recalled.\n\nIt's long been rumored that Parton wears long sleeves to cover her body art. She nearly confirmed as much in 2014: \"I do have a few little tattoos, but they were mostly done to cover scars because I'm so fair,\" she told Today's Savannah Guthrie. Parton added that the tats are mostly for her husband of 50 years, Carl Dean.\n\nParton founded the charity Imagination Library, which provides free books to preschoolers, in 1995. She has said that the organization is a way to honor her late father, who couldn't read. \"Not long before he passed, he told me he was more proud of me for the Imagination Library than anything else I had ever done,\" Parton told Paper.\n\nParton spent eight years on The Porter Waggoner Show before striking out on her own, prompting Waggoner to sue for breech of contract. The rift famously inspired Parton's hit song \"I Will Always Love You\" and the two remained estranged for many years. They reconciled in 2007, shortly before Waggoner died of lung cancer. Parton was with him the day he passed: \"I held his hand, and we prayed,\" Parton told Knoxville'sNews Sentinel. \"Porter's soul was already with God. All that was left was a shell.\"\n\nParton told NPR a redheaded bank teller with a \"terrible crush\" on her husband inspired the song. \"He just loved going to the bank because she paid him so much attention,\" Parton said. \"It was kinda like a running joke between us...I was saying, 'Hell, you're spending a lot of time at the bank. I don't believe we've got that kind of money.'\"\n\nParton understands why Cyrus took a drastic turn from her Disney days—the country icon wrote in a 2014 editorial for TIME: \"She was very proud of the work she did as Hannah Montana, but people were gonna leave her there forever...I will respect her choices. I did it my way, so why can't she do it her way?\""
