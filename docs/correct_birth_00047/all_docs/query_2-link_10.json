I hope being here does the same for you! Dolly.\"\n\nParton grew up in the two-room log cabin with her parents and 11 siblings.\n\nThe log cabin had no electricity or running water, but Parton remembered her years there fondly in her 1973 song \"My Tennessee Mountain Home.\"\n\n\"In my Tennessee mountain home / Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh / In my Tennessee mountain home / The crickets sing in the fields nearby,\" she sings.\n\nParton's brother Bobby built the Dollywood replica, and her mother, Avie Lee, designed and furnished the interior.\n\nA time capsule at the Dollywood DreamMore Resort contains a piece of wood from the front porch of the original home, which functioned as Parton's first stage.\n\nThe dining area featured a small table and a wood-burning stove.\n\nThe walls of the log cabin were covered with newspaper for insulation.\n\nReligious art adorned the walls.\n\nParton has often spoken about how her Christian faith has shaped her life and music, telling People magazine in 2019, \"I've always felt like my music was more my ministry than a job.\"\n\nDollywood pays tribute to her Christian upbringing with attractions like gospel-music performances and a chapel that holds worship services every Sunday.\n\nIn the kitchen and pantry, many of the items came from the original Parton family home.\n\nThe kitchen featured dishes, cast-iron pans, and a butter churner.\n\nThe log cabin only had one bedroom.\n\nPhotos of Parton's parents, Avie Lee Owens and Robert Lee Parton, hung above the bed.\n\nParton has come a long way since her humble beginnings, but she has stayed true to her Tennessee mountain home roots.\n\nDollywood is located just under six miles from Sevierville, Tennessee, where Parton grew up."
