        "text": "DOLLY Parton is one of the most successful singer-songwriters of all time, having sold over 100 million records across the world and has a legion of loyal fans.\n\nThe international star is beloved by fans around the world who often head to her famous Dollywood theme park.\n\nHow old is Dolly Parton?\n\nDolly Parton, 76, was born in Tennessee, US on January 19, 1946.\n\nShe's the most honoured female country performer of all time, achieving a whopping 25 RIAA certified Gold, Platinum, and Multi-Platinum awards.\n\nDolly has had 25 songs reach No. 1 on the Billboard country music charts - a record for a female artist.\n\nShe has nine Grammy Awards, two Academy Award nominations, 10 Country Music Association Awards, seven Academy of Country Music Awards, three American Music Awards.\n\nWhat is Dolly Parton's net worth?\n\nDolly lived a very different life to the one she does now while growing up as the fourth of 12 children in a humble cabin in rural Tennessee, with parents Robert and Avie Lee Parton.\n\nThe family was very poor at the time, so much so that Dolly shared a bed with several of her siblings.\n\nBut since her rise to fame in the late 70s, she has accumulated a net worth of $650million as of 2021, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nWhat are Dolly Parton's biggest songs?\n\nDolly has composed over 3,000 songs - most notably I Will Always Love You, which was a hit for her, as well as Whitney Houston.\n\nHer biggest - and probably best known - songs include:\n\nJolene\n\nCoat of Many Colors\n\n9 to 5\n\nWhy'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That\n\nYellow Roses\n\nWho is Dolly Parton's husband and does she have children?\n\nDolly married Carl Thomas Dean on May 30, 1966, and they're still together.\n\nThe couple keeps their relationship out of the limelight, and Carl rarely accompanies Dolly to any events.\n\nDolly and Dean don't have any children, but Dolly's the godmother of Miley Cyrus.\n\nThe singer has previously spoken about why she's never had children.\n\nShe said: \"God has a plan for everything. I think it probably was his plan for me not to have kids so everybody's kids could be mine. And they are now.\"\n\nDolly has said she used to regret not having children, but now doesn't feel that way.\n\nShe told Billboard: \"Now that Carl and I are older, we often say, 'Aren't you glad we didn't have kids? Now we don't have kids to worry about.'\""
