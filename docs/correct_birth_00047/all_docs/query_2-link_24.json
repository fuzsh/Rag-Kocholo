        "text": "My family and I just got back from Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, where we spent a day at Dollywood.\n\nAs a big Dolly Parton fan, one of my favorite things in the park was the replica of her family’s childhood home, which was constructed by her mother and brother.\n\nI snapped some photos to show you, so take a look!\n\nReplica of Dolly Parton’s Childhood Cabin at Dollywood\n\nI was amazed to see how Dolly and her 10 brothers and sisters lived in this tiny one-room cabin in the Smoky Mountains. She has always described her family as “dirt poor,” and that’s no exaggeration. It’s all the more remarkable when you think about how far she’s come since then!\n\n“I can still close my eyes and go home – I can always draw from that.”\n\n–Dolly Parton\n\nI was fascinated by details like the tin of tobacco and Johnson’s Baby Powder on the shelves:\n\nThere were 11 children, but this was the only bed:\n\nThe walls were wallpapered with pages from old newspapers and magazines:\n\nThe Pantry Shelves:\n\nThe kitchen table had seating for 6:\n\nThe Kitchen Stove:\n\nOne of my favorite Dolly quotes:\n\n“I’m not going to limit myself just because people won’t accept the fact that I can do something else.”\n\nThe Porch:\n\n5 Things You May Not Know About Dolly Parton:\n\nShe’s Miley Cyrus’s godmother and played “Aunt Dolly” on “Hannah Montana.”\n\nHer investment in Pigeon Forge, with enterprises like Dollywood and Dixie Stampede has revitalized the area and employs thousands.\n\nShe’s known as the Iron Butterfly. Butterflies they represent beauty and freedom to her.\n\n26 of her songs have hit #1 on the Billboard country charts, a record for a female artist.\n\nImagination Library is her literacy program that mails a book a month to children from the time they’re born until they turn 5. We talked to one Dollywood employee who told us every time her daughter gets a book in the mail, she says, “Aunt Dolly loves me!”\n\nVisit Dollywood to see it for yourself!\n\nFellow Dolly Parton fans can learn more about her projects on her website.\n\nGo to my Celebrity Houses page to see more I’ve featured.\n\nPrevious Post\n\nThe Spite House in Alexandria, Virginia\n\nNext Post\n\nMichael J. Fox and Tracy Pollan at Home in the Hamptons"
