        "text": "Dolly Parton has 11 brothers and sisters, many of whom are also in show business.\n\nHere's where you can find each of them as of 2023.\n\nAfter unrivaled success over decades of working in music and film, there's no doubt about it: Dolly Parton and her siblings are seriously talented. So, what's the story with these 11 brothers and sisters, anyway? And where are the Parton siblings now?\n\nThe big family, born to Robert and Avie Lee Parton, grew up near the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee's Sevier County, right up the road from Parton's Dollywood amusement park. In order of birth, the six boys and six girls were named Willadeene, David Wilburn, Coy Denver, Dolly Rebecca, Robert \"Bobby\" Lee, Stella Mae, Cassie Nan, Randel Huston “Randy,” Larry Gerald, Estel Floyd, and twins Freida Estelle and Rachel Ann.\n\nThe clan had next to nothing back then, but what they did have was a passion for music, instilled in them by their mother, who always encouraged them to sing at home and at church. \"I grew up in a very musical family, all my mother's people were very musical, so I was always around people playing instruments and singing, and my mom singing the old songs,\" Dolly told People in 2020. Dolly's sister Rachel echoed this telling People \"singing was like breathing at home\" in a 1982 interview.\n\nThe Parton siblings as children.\n\nSadly, three of Dolly's brothers have passed away. Larry Parton died just four days after his birth in 1955, according to a 2015 Fox News segment. Floyd Parton, Dolly's brother and longtime songwriting partner, passed away in 2018 at the age 0f 61. Over the years, Floyd had both penned and performed a number of songs for Dolly and several of the films she starred in, including \"Rockin' Years\" from the album Eagle When She Flies, \"Nickels and Dimes\" from Heartbreaker, and \"Waltz Me to Heaven\" from Rhinestone. Most recently, Dolly's brother Randy Parton died in January 2021 at the age of 67 after a battle with cancer. Randy pursued music as well. In addition to performing with his band, Moonlight Bandits, Randy also sang on the soundtrack of the 1984 movie, Rhinestone, and performed with his sister, Rachel, in Dollywood's a capella group, Honey Creek.\n\nThe rest of the Parton kids, however, are still around—and many of them still perform with Dolly. Here's what they're all doing now.\n\nStella Parton, Frieda Parton and Dolly Parton recording Frieda’s studio album in January of 1981 in Hollywood.\n\nStella Parton\n\nJust like Dolly, 77, several of the Parton sisters delved into singing and acting. Stella Parton, 74, was one of them. She followed in her older sister's footsteps, making her country singing debut in 1967. In fact, you may remember her chart-topping 1975 song \"I Want to Hold You in My Dreams Tonight.\" More recently, Stella appeared in Dolly's 2015 television movie Coat of Many Colors.\n\nCassie Parton & Freida Parton\n\nCassie Parton, 72, and Freida Parton, 66, are also talented singers. Cassie performed in the Dollywood show, \"My People,\" in 2013 with her brother Randy, according to Knoxville News. Freida no longer frequents the stage after performing in a punk band in the 1980s and singing back-up on some of Dolly's albums; she now works as an ordained minister and even opened her own wedding chapel in Sevierville, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel.\n\nRachel Parton Dennison\n\nParton fans will also remember Dolly's famous younger sister, Rachel Parton Dennison, 64, who starred in the ABC sitcom 9 to 5 from 1982 to 1988, and also sang in Honey Creek. In 2014, she performed with Dolly and Stella at the Red Tent Women's Conference in Tennessee, and reminded us all why the Partons are such country music legends.\n\nWilladeene Parton\n\nAlthough she didn't pursue the entertainment industry like many of her siblings, the oldest Parton child, Willadeene Parton, 83, contributed to the family's empire through books. She wrote a Parton family memoir, , in 1996, followed by her 1997 cookbook, .\n\nDavid Parton, Coy Parton, and Robert Lee Parton Jr.\n\nAs for Dolly's other siblings, David Parton, 81, Coy Parton, 80, and Robert Lee Parton Jr., 76, they never pursued show business, and tend to keep their lives private."
