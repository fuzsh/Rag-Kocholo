Tennessee Department of Tourist Development Commissioner Mark Ezell called Dolly a \"key figure\" of Tennessee and music.\n\n\"When you think of Tennessee and music, there are key figures and places that often to come mind, and Dolly is one of them,\" Ezell said. \"I couldnâ€™t think of a better way to honor her great musical legacy and all that she has done not only for music across the state but tourism as well. Dollywood is a key attraction for visitors to come and experience from across the world, and it is a great privilege to recognize the work and success of a true Tennessee icon.\"\n\nAfter the unveiling, the singer thanked the commissioner and said she was proud to be from the Volunteer State.\n\n\"I am proud to be from Sevier County and Sevierville and this Music Pathways sign honors me, my family and my history there,\" Parton said."
