        "text": "Always working 9 to 5, Dolly Parton never seems to slow down.\n\nThe country legend is basically omnipresent, continuing to produce and record music 66 years after she began her career. Parton has become more than a singer through her philanthropic endeavors, hence the reason many consider her a national treasure.\n\nFrom becoming Miley Cyrus's godmother to donating $12.5 million to victims of Tennessee wildfires, Parton has really done it all.\n\nNow seven decades into her career, she's still going full steam ahead by releasing another album and performing at her first NFL game.\n\nMORE: Everything to know about NFL Thanksgiving game halftime shows in 2023\n\nSeeming to have lived a million lives, how old is Parton? Here's everything you need to know about her and her career.\n\nHow old is Dolly Parton?\n\nParton is 77 years old. Born Jan. 19, 1946, she grew up in Sevierville, Tennessee, with 11 siblings. She is the fourth-oldest of her brothers and sisters, all who were musically talented despite not pursuing a career in the industry with her.\n\nShe's been a musician for most of her life, releasing her first full-length album at age 21, and has released the most studio albums by a female country singer. Her 66th album titled \"Rockstar\", her first rock record, was released Nov. 17.\n\nDolly Parton career timeline\n\nParton's singing career began young. At age 11, she professionally recorded her first single, \"Puppy Love,\" and two years later she performed her first show at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. With her uncle, Bill Owens, as her manager, the duo set off to secure Parton's first record deal. The next few years were up and down, though, as her music failed to chart immediately and she was dropped from her first label.\n\nShe eventually signed with Monument Records and found success. She first appeared on the Billboard country charts in 1967 with her songs \"Dumb Blonde\" and \"Something Fishy.\" Six months later, her first album, \"Hello, I'm Dolly\" is released.\n\nIn 1971, \"Joshua\" became her first single to be a No. 1 hit. Three years later, her songs \"Jolene\" and \"I Will Always Love You\" topped the country charts, too. Soon after, she won the CMA's Female Vocalist of the Year, her first solo award.\n\nHer first self-produced album, \"New Harvest...First Gathering\", went platinum a year after its release, solidifying Parton's place in music history. She was the first female country artist to sell one million copies of an album. When it was first released, the record's single \"Here You Come Again\" topped the country chart for five straight weeks. It secured Parton her first Grammy for Best Country Vocal Performance by a Female.\n\nHer first movie, \"9 to 5\", was released in 1980, and she earned several Golden Globe nominations for it. Following the movie, the title song hit No. 1 on country and pop music charts. It earned her two more Grammys and eventually her first Academy of Country Music award.\n\nIn 1992, Whitney Houston covered Parton's song \"I Will Always Love You\" for her film \"The Bodyguard\". It spent 14 weeks at No. 1, a record at the time.\n\nTwo years later, Parton released her New York Times Bestselling autobiography, \"Dolly: My Life and Other Unfinished Business\". Not long after, she launched the Imagination Library, a book donation service.\n\nBefore the millennium ended, she dropped her first of three bluegrass albums, each of which received Grammy nominations.\n\nIn 2015, Parton's biopic, \"Dolly Parton's Coat of Many Colors\" debuted. It garnered 15.6 million viewers, resulting in a sequel the next year called \"Dolly Parton's Christmas of Many Colors: Circle of Love\".\n\nShe released her 66th studio album, called \"Rockstar\", on Nov. 17, 2023. It's the first rock album of hers and breaks her own record for most studio albums released by a female country singer.\n\nDolly Parton awards and accomplishments\n\nThrough Parton's career, which spans seven decades, she has 25 No. 1 songs, securing her legacy as not just a country singer but a music legend. She's won 10 Grammys and received 54 nominations, the second-most by a female artist\n\nShe's been inducted into the Country Music, Gospel Music, Nashville Songwriters and Rock & Roll halls of fame, the latter of which she originally turned down. She felt she didn't have of a enough right to be inducted, as she wasn't a rock musician, but she eventually accepted the honor. It inspired her to record her latest record.\n\nShe was awarded the Library of Congress Living Legends medal in 2004, joining the likes of Johnny Cash, who introduced her before her first Grand Ole Opry performance. The medal recognizes \"individuals who have made significant contributions to America's cultural, scientific and social heritage.\" She additionally earned the lifetime achievement award from the Recording Academy 54 years after her music career began.\n\nGuinness World Records\n\nParton holds 10 Guinness World Records, setting her first two in 2018 for Most Decades with a Top 20 hit on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart and Most No. 1 hits on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart by a female artist.\n\nTitle Record Most Top 10 entries on US Top Country Albums chart (female) 48 Most studio albums released by a female country singer 65* Longest span of No. 1 hits on the US Top Country Albums chart (female) 43 years, 156 days Most Grammy nominations for a female country artist 51 First country singer to be nominated for the EGOT - Longest span of No. 1 hits on the US Hot Country Songs chart 35 years, 26 days Most hits on the US Hot Country Songs chart (female) 109 Most decades on the US Hot Country Songs chart (female) 7 Most No. 1 hits on the US Hot Country Songs chart (female) 25 Most decades with a Top 20 hit on the US Hot Country Songs chart 6\n\n*Record set prior to the release of \"Rockstar\", her 66th studio album\n\nDolly Parton's Imagination Library\n\nOne of Parton's biggest successes has come away from music altogether, with her Imagination Library.\n\nInspired by her father's illiteracy, she started it in 1995 to help children learn to read and write and enjoy doing so. The Imagination Library was originally created to help children in her eastern Tennessee community learn, but it quickly grew. It has since become an international resource with branches in Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia.\n\n\"My daddy just loved it when all the little kids would call me ‘The Book Lady.’ That meant more to him than the fact that I had become a star and worked my butt off,\" Parton said.\n\nSince its beginning, the service has registered nearly 2.8 million children, and the number continues to rise every day. It has additionally donated more than 221 million books."
