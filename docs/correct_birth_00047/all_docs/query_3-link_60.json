        "text": "Dolly Parton songs: What are her biggest hits?\n\nDolly Parton - Jolene 19880110\n\nDolly has composed over 3,000 songs, including 'I Will Always Love You', which became a huge hit for Whitney Houston in 1992.\n\nDolly Parton's 10 greatest songs ever, ranked\n\nWatch Olivia Newton-John's stunning posthumous 'Jolene' duet with Dolly Parton\n\nHer other big hits include 'Jolene', 'Coat of Many Colours', 'Islands in the Stream' (with Kenny Rogers), and '9 to 5'.\n\nDolly Parton age: How old is she?\n\nDolly was born on January 19, 1946.\n\nShe celebrated her 76th birthday in 2022.\n\nDolly Parton husband: Is she married?\n\nDolly Parton On Husband Carl Dean: The Rumors Aren’t True!\n\nIn 1966, Dolly married Carl Dean. He is a retired asphalt road-paving businessman, who prefers to stay out of the limelight.\n\nWhile Dolly does not use Dean's surname professionally, she has said that her passport says 'Dolly Parton Dean'. She has also said that he has seen her perform only once.\n\nThe history of Dolly Parton and Carl Dean’s 54-year marriage, and their secret to long-lasting love\n\nIn 2011, the couple celebrated their 45th anniversary. Dolly said: \"We're really proud of our marriage. It's the first for both of us. And the last.\"\n\nIn 2016, she announced that she and her husband would renew their vows to mark their 50th wedding anniversary later in the month.\n\nDolly Parton children: Does she have any kids?\n\nDolly Parton and Miley Cyrus perform 'Jolene' at the Grammys\n\nDolly and Dean helped raise several of Dolly's younger siblings in Nashville, with her nieces and nephews referring to her as 'Aunt Granny', which became the name to one of the singer's Dollywood restaurants.\n\nHow Dolly Parton has massively contributed to creating the COVID-19 vaccine\n\nThe couple have no children of their own, but Dolly is the godmother of singer Miley Cyrus.\n\nWho were Dolly Parton's parents and family?\n\nDolly is the fourth of 12 children born to Avie Lee Caroline (née Owens, 1923 – 2003) and Robert Lee Parton Sr (1921 – 2000).\n\nHer father was a subsistence farmer and construction worker, and her mother was a homemaker for their large family. Her 11 pregnancies between 1939 and 1959 made her a mother of 12 by the age of 35.\n\nDolly Parton talks Elvis, 9 to 5, MeToo and what she'd tell Jolene today\n\nDolly's middle name comes from her maternal great-great grandmother, Rebecca. She has described her family as being \"dirt poor\".\n\nWhat was Dolly Parton's relationship with Porter Wagoner?\n\nPorter Wagoner & Dolly Parton - Just Someone I Used To Know\n\nIn 1967, country star Porter Wagoner invited Dolly to join his company, offering her a regular spot on his weekly TV series The Porter Wagoner Show, and in his live road show.\n\nWagoner convinced his label, RCA Victor, to sign her. They recorded several albums and singles together, and became one of the country's most popular and successful double acts.\n\nDolly had always wanted a solo career, and decided to leave Wagoner's company. Their last duet concert took place in April 1974, and she left his TV show in mid-1974. Their last album together was 1975's Say Forever You'll Be Mine.\n\nWagoner died in 2007 at the age of 80. Dolly was at his bedside alongside his family. 'I Will Always Love You' was written about her professional break up from Wagoner.\n\nWhat and where is Dollywood?\n\nDollywood is a theme park located in the Knoxville-Smoky Mountains metroplex in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. It is the biggest ticketed tourist attraction in the state.\n\nOriginally called Rebel Railroad in 1961, and later Goldrush Junction and Silver Dollar City, it was renamed Dollywood after the singer bought an interest in 1986.\n\nIn 2010, Dolly said she became involved with the project because she \"always thought that if I made it big or got successful at what I had started out to do, that I wanted to come back to my part of the country and do something great, something that would bring a lot of jobs into this area.\"\n\nThe park has several thrill rides, traditional crafts and music of the Smoky Mountains area, as well as concerts and musical events each year, including appearances by Dolly and her family, and other national and local musical acts."
