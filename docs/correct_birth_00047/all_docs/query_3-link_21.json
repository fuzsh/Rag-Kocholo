        "text": "(born 1946). American country music singer, guitarist, and actress Dolly Parton was noted for bridging the gap between country and pop music styles. She was also known for Dollywood, a theme park centered on Appalachian traditions located in eastern Tennessee that she opened in 1986.\n\nDolly Rebecca Parton was born on January 19, 1946, in Locust Ridge, Tennessee, into a poor farming family. She displayed a passion for music at an early age, and as a child she was a featured singer and guitarist on local radio and television shows in Knoxville, Tennessee. In 1964, immediately following her high school graduation, she set out for Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music.\n\nIn Nashville Parton became the protégée of country music singer and Grand Ole Opry star Porter Wagoner. She appeared regularly on Wagoner’s syndicated television show, gaining national recognition. Parton soon came to the attention of the music industry moguls at RCA Records and subsequently recorded more than a dozen hit songs—together with Wagoner—on the RCA label. She rapidly emerged as one of country music’s most popular singers.\n\nIn 1974 Parton launched a solo career, in which she enjoyed immediate success: in both 1975 and ’76 she was chosen female singer of the year by the Country Music Association (CMA). About the same time, Parton began to cross over to the pop music market, and in 1978 she won a Grammy Award for her song “Here You Come Again” and was named entertainer of the year by the CMA. As her career developed, Parton received more Grammys, both for her songs (including “9 to 5” [1980] and “Shine” [2001]) and for her albums (including Trio [1987; with Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris] and The Grass Is Blue [1999]).\n\nIn the 1980s Parton appeared in several successful films, most notably Nine to Five (1980; also known as 9 to 5) and The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982). For the latter film, she revived one of her most popular songs, “I Will Always Love You” (1974). (Whitney Houston later recorded the song for the film The Bodyguard [1992], and it went on to sell millions of copies.) In 1989 Parton played a main role in the movie Steel Magnolias. In the 1990s and 2000s she guest-starred in many television series and appeared in several made-for-television movies. In 2009 Parton wrote the music and lyrics for a Broadway musical adaptation of the film 9 to 5. Three years later she starred in the film Joyful Noise with Queen Latifah.\n\nIn addition to her musical and film work, Parton published several children’s books, as well as an autobiography, Dolly: My Life and Other Unfinished Business (1994), and a book of personal philosophy, Dream More: Celebrate the Dreamer in You (2012). She also created the Dollywood Foundation, an organization with the aim of providing inspiration and educational resources to children.\n\nThroughout her career, Parton was the recipient of numerous awards and honors. In 1999 she was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. She was named a Living Legend by the Library of Congress in 2004 for her enrichment of the American cultural heritage. The next year Parton received the U.S. government’s National Medal of Arts, and in 2006 she was recognized at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., for her lifetime artistic achievement. In 2011 she was honored with a special Grammy for lifetime achievement."
