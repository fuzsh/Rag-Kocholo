        "text": "Have you ever heard of Pittman Center, Tennessee? The funny thing is, I have driven by it many times and didn’t even realize it. This tiny town is certainly beautiful but it is among the smallest towns in our state. This town may be very little but this is also the hometown of one of the biggest names in country music, Dolly Parton. Since Dolly has never forgotten her roots she has put this town on the map and gave rise to the popularity of the surrounding area in Seiver County.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPittman Center, Tennessee, may not be a name that you have ever heard before but I am willing to bet you have heard the name Dolly Parton before. This small town hosted one of the most famous country stars and now because of Dolly’s contribution the whole Smoky Mountain area is transformed into a powerhouse for family vacations and activities.\n\nAs beautiful as good rags-to-riches story can be, Dolly Partons theme park is often rated as one of the prettiest parks in the world and we couldn’t agree more! There are several events throughout the year and we think A Smoky Mountain Christmas is a can’t-miss event.\n\nWant more Tennessee in your inbox?\n\nGet the latest on things to see, do, and eat around Tennessee!\n\nspinner\n\nThank you!
