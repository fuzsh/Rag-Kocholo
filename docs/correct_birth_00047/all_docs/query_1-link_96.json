        "text": "PIGEON FORGE, Tenn. (WVLT) - For 39 years, Dolly Parton has been in business with the Herschend family, operating The Herschends-owned Silver Dollar City, Tennessee, which is the current home of Dollywood.\n\nIt’s a partnership, they said, that is built on trust and love.\n\nIn 1950, Jack and Pete Herschend’s parents started operating a cave in Branson, Missouri.\n\nA decade later, that business expanded with the mythical Ozark town called Silver Dollar City.\n\n“We thought we were in the cave business, but Jack and I soon discovered that we were no longer in the cave business. We were in the entertainment business. And we grew from there. We learned many, many lessons about entertaining,” said Peter Herschend, owner.\n\nAs the company expanded, they added a second Silver Dollar City in Pigeon Forge.\n\nThat’s when they got to know Dolly Parton. Dolly would take her nieces and nephews to the park, and over time, a business partnership was born.\n\n“Partnership with Dolly Parton is kind of like a partnership made in heaven. We knew when we got involved with Dolly that she would represent us; she’d be the spokesperson and do a better job than anybody else that I can think of,” said Jack Herschend, owner.\n\nThey said the lessons they learned from Dolly led to their success in the entertainment industry. Over time, besides Silver Dollar City and Dollywood, the company has expanded to include 16 other properties.\n\nThe Herschends said the root of their business is love. They learned from Dolly from each other and the communities in which they do business.\n\n“Dolly Parton has added so much to that very point of heart for the community. She’s the one who said 40% of kids in my high school don’t graduate. We need to do something,” said Jack.\n\nDolly said the business is a success because of the hard work the Herschends put into each property, including Dollywood.\n\n“That means a lot that I’m involved with so many great people. The Herschend family and I were blessed when God saw fit for us all together all those many years ago back in ‘86 when we opened Dollywood. And you just never know how it’s going to turn out, but everything is so great,” said Dolly.\n\nOverall, Dolly and the Herschends say trust has led to their success and trust in each other.\n\nWhen asked about what is at the heart of what they do when building or expanding a property, Peter said, “Frankly, anybody can build a park just takes money. You can’t just make a park happen. It takes people with love in their heart and a real care for the guests.”"
