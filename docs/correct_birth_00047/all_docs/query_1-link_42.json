        "text": "Dolly Parton has always shown hometown pride for Pigeon Forge, Tennessee—the home of Dollywood theme park, located not far from Parton's childhood home in Locust Ridge, Sevierville. Now, Parton's helping spread the word about a family friendly challenge that explores the area's attractions.\n\nA new YouTube series, the \"Pigeon Forge Family Challenge\" will feature five families from around America as they get to know the Pigeon Forge area through a series of challenges at the city's most notable sights.\n\nThe East Tennessee city is approximately 35 miles from Knoxville, a neighbor to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and known for its action-packed vacation attractions. At the end of the season, the challenge's winning family will receive $5,000 and a trip back to Pigeon Forge.\n\nIn a YouTube video announcing the challenge, Dolly said, \"Well hi, my Pigeon Forge fans! Have you heard about the Pigeon Forge family challenge?\n\n\"Well, we found five fabulous families and put them to the test with a series of fun competitions around town,\" Parton explains.\n\nThe series, filmed in August 2023, kicks off on Jan. 29 with Knoxville journalist Beth Haynes as the host. Viewers can find the series on Pigeon Forge’s YouTube channel.\n\nThe episodes air on Feb. 6, 13, 20, 27 and March 5 and will take place at The Island in Pigeon Forge, Mountain Mile, the historic Old Mill, the Lumberjack Feud Adventure Park and Country Tonite Theater. Of course, the contestants also visited Parton’s Dollywood theme park, too.\n\n“All five families are winners in my book because they truly squeezed every ounce of fun and great times out of the Pigeon Forge Family Challenge,” Parton said in a statement.\n\n“Everybody enjoyed the family fun and great attractions that we offer in Pigeon Forge, and they made lifelong friendships and sweet memories that they’ll have forever.”\n\nAt the end of the series, on the seventh and final episode, Parton will appear to announce the winners for viewers.\n\n“Dolly’s involvement took the challenge to the next level for the families and us!” said Pigeon Forge Executive Director of Tourism Leon Downey.\n\n“The Pigeon Forge Family Challenge proved itself to be an ideal setting to showcase the variety of attractions Pigeon Forge has to offer while also shining a spotlight on how much fun families have while visiting our destination,\" Downey said.\n\nFans can learn more at mypigeonforge.com/family-challenge."
