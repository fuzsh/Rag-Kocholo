        "text": "Dolly Rebecca Parton (born January 19, 1946) is an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, actress, author and philanthropist, best known for her work in country music.Beginning her career as a child performer, Parton issued a few modestly successful singles from 1959 through the mid-1960s, showcasing her distinctive soprano voice. She rose to greater prominence in 1967 as a featured performer on singer Porter Wagoner's weekly television program; their first duet single, a cover of Tom Paxton's \"The Last Thing on My Mind\", was a top-ten hit on the country singles charts, and led to several successful albums before they ended their partnership in 1974."
