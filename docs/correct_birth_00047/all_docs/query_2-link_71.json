        "text": "Published Nov 8, 2023\n\nDolly Parton’s rise to fame is a true-life rags to riches story. It reaches from the patchwork “coat of many colors” her mother made for her, to her status as a sequined national treasure. Now the singer shares a lifetime of memories in a new Dollywood attraction, The Dolly Parton Experience, opening in May, 2024.\n\nVisitors will learn about the country legend’s childhood, family, show biz breaks and of course her famed stage costumes.\n\nThe Dolly Parton Experience replaces Dollywood’s Chasing Rainbows museum. For the past 20 years, the museum told Dolly’s incredible story to thousands of guests. The new Experience will be three times larger than Chasing Rainbows.\n\nDolly’s life and half-century career won’t fit into just one museum any more. The Dolly Parton Experience begins when you stroll into a courtyard surrounded by multiple buildings festooned with huge, colorful butterfly sculptures. Butterflies are Dolly’ personal symbol, chosen by her for their gentleness and freedom.\n\nWhat to Expect When You Visit\n\nDolly’s unmistakable voice narrates your trip through her hardscrabble past and into her superstar present. Using state-of-the-art technology, the Experience surrounds you with changing projections and effects.\n\nDiscover the love and hard work of her earliest years in the Partons’ two-room Smoky Mountains farmhouse. Witness her rise as a songwriter and performer, growing from local radio to the Grand Ole Opry. Watch her conquer movies and television. Get an up-close look at family mementos and career souvenirs.\n\nYou’ll Want to Come Back\n\nThe Dolly Parton Experience will add new features frequently. You’ll want to visit more than once to see what’s new! Opening exhibits will include:\n\nTennessee Mountain Home. Hear stories about Dolly’s childhood and the Parton clan’s music-filled world.\n\nDreamsong Theater. See how Dolly’s family and faith nurture her and keep her close to her Smoky Mountain roots.\n\nBehind the Seams. Dolly shows off her collection of custom clothes and stage costumes from throughout her career. Expect gleaming rhinestones, glittering sequins and more butterflies!\n\nYour admission to Dollywood includes admission to the Dolly Parton Experience. Just come on in. Dolly’s Southern hospitality is waiting for you."
