        "text": "Make a Lasting Impact\n\nLipscomb Impact 360, our strategic vision for the future, is an all-encompassing plan, designed to elevate every area of the university and create a more robust student experience that prepares you for a life of purpose wherever you go.\n\nLipscomb Impact 360\n\nThere are few people who could better represent the epitome of a Lipscomb research scientist than the Canada Research Chair for Theoretical Chemistry at McMaster University, Paul Ayers (BS ’96).\n\nAyers heard his calling at Lipscomb. He built his intellectual and professional skills and his research resume at Lipscomb. He discovered his way to make a difference in the world at Lipscomb.\n\n“Even as just a nursing student and not really having started my career yet, hearing families thank me, tell me I changed their lives and tell me that they thought I am going to be an amazing nurse, I fell in love with the profession even more,” she continues. “I absolutely cannot wait to be a nurse.”\n\nBeing an NCAA Div. 1 student athlete is demanding with an intense schedule of practices, conditioning, travel, games and other commitments to represent the program and university. She did not let the fear of balancing a rigorous academic program with the demands of being an athlete stop her from pursuing these dreams.\n\nWhen David Green came to Lipscomb he had a clear vision: to cultivate his talents as an aspiring singer-songwriter and pursue his dreams of becoming a full-time worship leader and recording artist. His passion for music and the Gospel message led him to Lipscomb, where he found the perfect platform to merge his artistic aspirations with his faith.\n\nAs a pair of nationally known writers and thought leaders, the Frenches have no problem intertwining their personal experiences and insights drawn from their daily lives into their influential work in litigation, politics and journalism. Nancy French began her writing career literally by writing about her daily life as a Southern-bred, politically conservative wife and mother living in a politically liberal area of the country. When David French had the realization he needed to walk the talk in regards to his views on the Iraq War, the couple co-wrote a book about how his service in the judge-advocate general officer (JAG) corps affected both their lives, their family and their approach to life.\n\nThe daughter of immigrants from Guatemala, Karen De Leon (’23) learned to speak English by watching Sesame Street. As she grew up in Nashville, she often relied on her school teachers to learn how to be successful. While studying at Lipscomb, she leaned on her mentor in the Pionero Program, a scholarship and outreach initiative.\n\nBrynn Abner, a senior film major from Johnson City, Tennessee, was tapped to be the director and post-production supervisor for a documentary to show at the “Dolly Parton and the Makers: My Life in Rhinestones” exhibit currently on display on Lipscomb University’s campus. Leading a nine-student crew, Abner truly saw the magic “behind the seams,” interviewing nine members of Parton’s core team of creatives at locations including Parton’s shop at her Brentwood home and her Nashville offices\n\nDue to allergies, Anna Belle Skidmore a senior education major, is required to eat a gluten- free diet while also being a long-distance runner. “I was needing something to eat that was gluten-free, would work with my active running lifestyle, but would also taste good,” said Anna Belle. “So we started experimenting with different ways to flavor granola. Every time we took our favorite flavors and turned them into new granola recipes, we said, ‘We Granola’d it!’ So that became our tagline!”\n\nGrowing up in an orphanage in Ouanaminthe, Haiti, Donken Andre, junior, thought his calling in life was to be a pastor. However, after arriving at Lipscomb and experiencing its unique blend of spiritual, leadership and missional programming, he realized that goal was just too small for God’s work. Now he is working toward launching a foundation to advocate for the people in Haiti through business education as well as ministry. Today he wants to help the young men and women in Haiti break out of the poverty cycle through leadership both inside—and outside—the church.\n\nAustin Smith (’06), Hermitage, Tennessee, opened the original Party Fowl full-service restaurant on 8th Avenue in downtown Nashville with co-owner Nick Jacobson in 2014. Its success launched them into the forefront of the Nashville Hot Chicken craze and led to the opening of five additional locations in Donelson, Cool Springs, Murfreesboro, Chattanooga, and most recently, Destin, Florida.\n\nAaron Hardy, junior civil engineering major from Parkersburg, West Virginia, learned a lot about building a firm foundation for structures in his civil engineering materials class, but after a class contest to design a new formula for concrete to make it as strong as possible, he developed a curiosity about what science “grounded” the building codes and best practices for civil engineers."
