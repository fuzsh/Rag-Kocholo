Inspired by her childhood in Locust Ridge, Tennessee, a love for music and storytelling, and a desire to create a place for families to grow and play, DreamMore Resort brings Dolly’s vision for a premier family destination to life.\n\nTucked away in the Smokies next to Dollywood’s DreamMore Resort and Spa, Dollywood’s HeartSong Lodge & Resort blurs the lines between indoors and outdoors, seamlessly blending Smoky Mountain adventure and the world-class Dollywood experience. Inspired by Dolly’s love for the Great Smoky Mountains, HeartSong Lodge invites families to explore nature, create memories and discover the heartsong within themselves.\n\nNearly 15 years after opening Dollywood, Dolly and team opened Dollywood’s Splash Country. Next door to Dollywood, Dollywood’s Splash Country is an award winning water park featuring a variety of water attractions.\n\nDolly Parton’s Stampede is an extraordinary dinner show with thirty-two magnificent horses and a cast of top-notch riders. They will thrill you with daring feats of trick riding and competition, in a friendly and fun rivalry.
