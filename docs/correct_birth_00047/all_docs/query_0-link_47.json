        "text": "Dolly Parton joins Ken Burns and Marty Stuart in launching nationwide campaign to honor every American city\n\nMusic legend Dolly Parton helped kick off the “Honor Your Hometown” campaign with a tribute to her hometown of Sevierville, Tennessee. Led by Emmy Award-winning filmmaker Ken Burns and Country Music Hall of Fame inductee Marty Stuart, the “Honor Your Hometown” campaign is a non-partisan, all-volunteer campaign to honor hometowns across America. Headlining a roster of over 150 American leaders, including iconic entertainers and community officials, Dolly was one of the first two people approached to take part in the campaign, along with the late Colin Powell.\n\nIn Dolly’s tribute to her hometown of Sevierville, Tennessee, she shares her appreciation and affection for the people and culture of the Great Smoky Mountains before singing a chorus of her beloved song, “My Tennessee Mountain Home.”\n\nJoin the Cause and #HonorYourHometown"
