        "text": "During a recent visit to Tennessee, I stopped by Sevier County to check out its courthouse. Sevierville, Tennessee, is the birthplace of Dolly Parton, and the community celebrates her connection to the town by hosting a life-size bronze statue on the county courthouse grounds. According to one resource, Ms. Parton has commented, “One of the best things that ever happened to me in my whole career is the statue of me in the courthouse yard in Sevierville.”\n\nIn addition to its most famous modern resident, Sevier County has an interesting history. The town and county are named after John Sevier, a noted frontiersman, and Tennessee’s first governor. Sevier also governed over the failed state of Franklin in the 1780s. Before the arrival of European settlers, the Cherokee people had become well-established in this area over centuries.\n\nFor more information about the topics covered in this post, we recommend reviewing these Library of Congress resources:\n\nDolly Parton Biography\n\nDolly Parton and the Roots of Country Music\n\nDolly Parton Dedicates Her Imagination Library’s 100 Millionth Book to the Library of Congress\n\nNative American Constitutions and Legal Materials: Cherokee Nation\n\nLife of General John Sevier"
