        "text": "One of the town's most historic buildings is the Sevier County Courthouse, which was built in 1896 and remodeled in 1970. It's listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the courthouse's clock has been famously chiming every half hour since it was built.\n\nThe songstress's famous Dollywood theme park isn't in her hometown. Neither is her Dixie Stampede Dinner Attraction or brand-new Lumberjack Adventure, for that matter. Those can all be found 15 minutes down the road in Sevierville's sister city, Pigeon Forge. Another fun fact: It's been said that Dolly has never ridden any of her park's rides because of her motion sickness.\n\nIf you're looking to upgrade your kitchen knife collection, you've come to the right place. Smoky Mountain Knife Works claims to be \"the world's largest knife showplace.\" While the store also sell things like clothes and kitchenware, it's a go-to spot for basically anything that cuts.\n\nTennessee has more caves than any other state in the country, and one of its \"most spectacular caverns\" is right in Sevierville: the Forbidden Caverns. Despite its name, it's been a popular tourist attraction since the 1960s. Take note: It's best to visit on a hot day since the caves are kept at a cool 58 degrees every day.\n\nLocated a short drive away from Sevierville are the Great Smoky Mountains. It's the most-visited national park in the country, drawing ten million visitors a year. (That's twice more than the Grand Canyon!)\n\nThe North Carolina-Tennessee state line can be found inside the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Stand on it, and you can technically be in two places (or states, at least) at the same time.\n\nIn 1995, Dolly launched the Imagination Library in her native Sevier County. From the time any child is born up to the age of 5, he or she will be mailed a free, age-appropriate book every single month. Over 25 million books have been delivered to those registered in the program. In 2000, Dolly announced that the program would be available to any community that wanted to partner up and support it locally."
