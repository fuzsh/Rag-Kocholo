        "text": "Known as “your hometown in the Smokies,” Sevierville, TN is a can’t-miss vacation spot! Boasting a unique small-town feel, our charming city is famous for its natural beauty and family-friendly atmosphere. To help you make the most of your getaway, The Lodge at Five Oaks has put together a handy Sevierville tourism guide to four popular landmarks in town.\n\n1. Sevier County Courthouse\n\nThe Sevier County Courthouse was the first courthouse in Tennessee to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This gorgeous building is well-known for its iconic clock tower, which stands 75 feet above the courthouse and 130 feet above the ground. The original clock tower, which was constructed in 1895, was recently replaced with an exact replica that is more structurally sound. 2018 marks the first time since the 1990s that the historic bell inside the clock tower will ring every day. Visitors will find the Sevier County Courthouse at 125 Court Avenue in downtown Sevierville.\n\n2. Dolly Parton Statue\n\nWhen you stop by the Sevier County Courthouse, you can also see a statue of the Patron Saint of Sevierville Tourism: Ms. Dolly Parton! As you may know, Dolly was born and raised in Sevier County and launched her career by performing on local radio and TV shows in East Tennessee. To thank Dolly for everything she has done for her hometown, the city of Sevierville commissioned a bronze statue of the singer that was unveiled on May 3, 1987. Today, vacationers love to snap selfies with the Queen of Country Music in front of the courthouse.\n\n3. Harrisburg Covered Bridge\n\nLocated near the intersection of Harrisburg Road and Old Covered Bridge Road, the Harrisburg Covered Bridge is another popular landmark in Sevierville. Constructed in 1875, this historic wooden bridge crosses over the East Fork of the Little Pigeon River. The Harrisburg Covered Bridge is a wonderful place to take family photos and enjoy the quaint and relaxing atmosphere.\n\n4. The Apple Barn\n\nThe Apple Barn Cider Mill & General Store is a fantastic destination for snacking and shopping in the Smokies. Situated beside an apple orchard, the Apple Barn serves a variety of freshly prepared apple treats at its Cider Bar, including apple cider, fried apple pies, apple cinnamon donuts, apple dumplings, and apple butter muffins. Visitors to the Apple Barn will also find an excellent selection of specialty food products and souvenirs in the General Store, such as homemade apple butter, apple pancake mix, apple salsa, and the Apple Barn Cookbook."
