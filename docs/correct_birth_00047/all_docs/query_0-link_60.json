        "text": "Here are Miss Parton's favourite things to do in the Smoky Mountains.\n\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park —The Great Smoky Mountains are the most special place to me in the whole world. I often say that no matter where I go in the world, I take my mountains with me—no!—not those mountains! My Smoky Mountains! They are a part of my DNA and influence everyword I write and every thought I have.\n\nCades Cove —There is not a more beautiful or unique place in the whole world, and I have been all over it. Every time I gothere I think of the people who settled this area and how hard they had to work to live. My upbringing was not much different than the lives they led in the Cove. Yet no matter how tough it may have been, the blessing of living in one of the most beautiful places in the world always reassures you that everything will be just fine.\n\nThe Tennessee Mountain Home —This is the house where I grew up. It’s a humble place but we had everything we needed, including running water, as long as you were willing to run and get it. I use it now as my own little retreat, a placeto relax, to think and to write.\n\nSevierville Courthouse Square —My hometown is Sevierville—at least that’s where I went to school. Several years ago a talented artist named Jim Gray created a statue ofme that sits in the courthouse grounds. My daddy was so proud of that statue. He used to kid me that no matter how important I felt about the statue,it still was just an outhouse for pigeons. I also know he used to go down there at night sometimes with a brush andsome water to clean it. The statue meant a lot to him so it means a lot to me.\n\nSevier County High School —I am very proud of my alma mater. I played in the band and will always be a Smoky Bear! (Just look for the big bear on top of the buildingwhen you drive by.) I often joke that I spent all of my days in high school dreaming about not being there. But the truth is I loved my time at highschool and this year I hope to go to my high school reunion.\n\nDollywood— Dollywood is the place I created for families and kids. It celebrates the heritage of my people, and provides a place to share that with our guests. I have many a friend to Dollywood and no matter who they are or where they come from, they always say the same thing, “I had no idea that Dollywood would be so big and pretty.” Funny thing is that’s what theysaid when they first met me!\n\nDixie Stampede —I say that Dixie Stampede is the most fun place to eat in the Smokies,and I mean it. If you want a place totake your family for exciting and wholesome entertainment with a great meal, Dixie is a great value.\n\nDollywood’s Splash Country —It gets warm sometimes in the Smokies and you need a place to cool off. I know I am biased but Splash Country is the greatest water park in the world—and you don’t have to worry about getting bit by a turtle."
