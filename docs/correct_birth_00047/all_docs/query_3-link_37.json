        "text": "DOLLY Parton is a global superstar, thanks to her long career as a country music icon.\n\nThe talented singer first burst onto the scene in the 70s, and since then has taken over the world.\n\nHow old is Dolly Parton?\n\nDolly Parton was born in Tennessee on January 19, 1946.\n\nShe's the most honoured female country performer of all time, achieving a whopping 25 RIAA certified Gold, Platinum, and Multi-Platinum awards.\n\nDolly has had 25 songs reach No1 on the Billboard country music charts - a record for a female artist.\n\nShe has a whopping eleven Grammy Awards.\n\nWhat is Dolly Parton's net worth?\n\nDolly lived a very different life to the one she does now while growing up as the fourth of 12 children in a humble cabin in rural Tennessee, with parents Robert and Avie Lee Parton.\n\nThe family were very poor at the time, so much so that Dolly shared a bed with several of her siblings.\n\nBut since her rise to fame in the late 70s, she has accumulated a net worth of £519M (as of September 2023) - not bad at all.\n\nWhat are Dolly Parton's biggest songs?\n\nDolly has composed over 3,000 songs - most notably I Will Always Love You, which was a hit for herself, as well as Whitney Houston.\n\nIn the UK she has achieved two top ten singles - Jolene, which peaked at No7 in 1976, and Islands In The Stream, a duet with Kenny Rogers.\n\nAlthough she didn't have huge chart success in the UK, Dolly had numerous hits around the world and chart-toppers on the US country music chart. These included:\n\nJoshua\n\nCoat of Many Colors\n\nHere You Come Again\n\nIt's All Wrong, But It's All Right\n\nHeartbreaker\n\nI Really Got the Feeling\n\nYou're The Only One\n\nStarting Over Again\n\nOld Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You\n\n9 to 5\n\nBut You Know I Love You\n\nI Will Always Love You\n\nTennessee Homesick Blues\n\nIslands in the Stream\n\nReal Love\n\nThink About Love\n\nTo Know Him Is to Love Him\n\nTelling Me Lies\n\nWhy'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That\n\nYellow Roses\n\nRockin' Years\n\nThere Was Jesus\n\nWho is Dolly Parton's husband and does she have children?\n\nDolly married Carl Thomas Dean on May 30, 1966 - and they're still together.\n\nThe couple keep their relationship out of the limelight, and Carl rarely accompanies Dolly to any events.\n\nDolly and Carl don't have any children, but Dolly's the godmother of Miley Cyrus.\n\nThe singer has previously spoken about why she's never had children..\n\nShe said: \"God has a plan for everything. I think it probably was his plan for me not to have kids so everybody's kids could be mine. And they are now.\"\n\nParton has said she used to regret not having children, but now doesn't feel that way.\n\nShe told Billboard: \"Now that Carl and I are older, we often say, 'Aren't you glad we didn't have kids? Now we don't have kids to worry about'\""
