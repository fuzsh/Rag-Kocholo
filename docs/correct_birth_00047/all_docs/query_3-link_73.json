She has 41 top 10 country albums and 110 charted singles over the past 40 years. In 1999, she was well-deservedly inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

She is also one of the few to have received at least one nomination from the Academy Awards, Grammy Awards, Tony Awards, and Emmy Awards. As an actress, she starred in films such as 9 to 5, The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, Rhinestone, and Steel Magnolias. She has also founded a number of charitable and philanthropic organizations.
