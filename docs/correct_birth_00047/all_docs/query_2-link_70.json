        "text": "Dolly Parton is the queen of country music. She has written smash hits like \"I Will Always Love You,\" \"Jolene,\" \"Coat of Many Colors,\" and, yet another autobiographical masterpiece: \"My Tennessee Mountain Home.\"\n\nParton grew up in Locust Ridge, Tennessee, as one of 12 children. When writing her 1973 concept album My Tennessee Mountain Home, she drew on her experiences of growing up poor in rural Appalachia. \"My Tennessee Mountain Home\" serves as the centerpiece of the record and highlights memories of Parton's, such as holding hands on a porch swing, watching fireflies, and walking home from church with those you love. In fact, the cover of My Tennessee Mountain Home album is the house that Parton and her family lived in throughout her childhood.\n\nThe album is home to other great tracks that tell the story of Parton's life. She wrote \"Dr. Robert F. Thomas\" in honor of the mountain doctor who delivered her in her her Tennessee cabin. (He received a sack of cornmeal as payment.) \"Down on Music Row,\" tells the story of her first days in Nashville as she tried to get a record deal. In the song, she offers thanks to legendary guitarist Chet Atkins and producer Bob Ferguson who helped her.\n\nRead More: Rooted in Country: Ginger Minj on Dolly Parton's 'Coat of Many Colors'\n\nThe album also features \"In The Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)\" from the 1969 album of the same name.\n\nParton released \"My Tennessee Mountain Home\" as a single in 1972, and it reached No. 15 on the US Hot Country Singles chart. The song now serves as a theme song for her theme park Dollywood. You'll hear Dolly sing the song as you walk up the steps to visit the replica of her real life Tennesee Mountain Home inside Dollywood.\n\nIf you're interested in the autobiographical record of Parton's, here's the tracklist:\n\n\"The Letter\"\n\n\"I Remember\"\n\n\"Old Black Kettle\"\n\n\"Daddy's Working Boots\"\n\n?\"Dr. Robert F. Thomas\"\n\n?\"In The Good Old Days (When Times were Bad)\"\n\n\"My Tennessee Mountain Home\"\n\n?\"Wrong Direction Home\"\n\n\"Back Home\"\n\n'The Better Part of Life\"\n\n\"Down on Music Row\"\n\n\"Sacred Memories\"\n\n'Tennessee Mountain Home' Lyrics:\n\nSittin' on the front porch on a summer afternoon\n\nIn a straightback chair on two legs, leans against the wall\n\nWatch the kids a' playin' with June bugs on a string\n\nAnd chase the glowin' fireflies when evenin' shadows fall\n\nIn my Tennessee mountain home\n\nLife is as peaceful as a baby's sigh\n\nIn my Tennessee mountain home\n\nCrickets sing in the fields near by\n\nHoneysuckle vine clings to the fence along the lane\n\nTheir fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet\n\nAnd on a distant hilltop, an eagle spreads it's wings\n\nAn' a songbird on a fence post sings a melody\n\nIn my Tennessee mountain home\n\nLife is as peaceful as a baby's sigh\n\nIn my Tennessee mountain home\n\nCrickets sing in the fields near by\n\nWalkin' home from church on a Sunday with the one ya' love\n\nJust laughin', talkin', making future plans\n\nAnd when the folks ain't lookin', you might steal a kiss or two\n\nSittin' in the porch swing, holdin' hands"
