Many kids know her as the lady who sends free books. But did you know people around the world know Dolly as the Queen of Country Music? Let’s take a look at this amazing Tennessean.\n\nParton family photo, taken from Dolly Parton's official website dollyparton.com.\n\nReplica of Parton family cabin located at Dollywood. Courtesy of Visit My Smokies.\n\nDolly Rebecca Parton was born on January 19, 1946. She was born in a log cabin near the Little Pigeon River in East Tennessee. Dolly was the fourth of twelve children! Her whole family lived in a one room log cabin and were very poor. In fact, when she was born, they had no money to pay the doctor. Her dad gave the doctor a sack of cornmeal as payment. In the Appalachian Mountains, it was normal for people who didn’t have a lot of money to use goods as payment. Her mother would pass the time by telling and singing mountain folk tales to her children. Dolly credited her mother with her love of music from an early age. Her dad worked hard to support her big family. Dolly said that even though he couldn’t read, he was the smartest person she knew. She credited him with her hard work ethic and business smarts.\n\nOne of the many guitars owned by Dolly Parton, Tennessee State Museum Collection.\n\nGrowing up, Dolly loved to sing and play musical instruments. Her uncle gave Dolly her first guitar at the age of eight. She also sang in her grandfather’s church choir. When she was ten, she sang on a radio program in Knoxville, TN. When she was thirteen, she made her way to Nashville where she sang at the Grand Ole Opry. The Grand Ole Opry was a very popular radio program. It is still going strong today! That performance would change her life. She just knew that she had to be a singer. When she graduated high school, Dolly moved to Nashville to become a star. Unfortunately, people didn’t just become stars overnight. It took a lot of hard work and lots of failures before Dolly became famous. One of her first jobs was as the duet partner of Porter Wagner on his TV show. After that, she became a household name! She even got her own show called Dolly in 1976. Dolly was known for wearing bedazzled and colorful outfits!\n\nDolly wearing the pantsuit on her show Dolly. She is singing with her guest Kenny Rogers.

Many of her songs focus on growing up in the Great Smoky Mountains and her family. “My Tennessee Mountain Home” and “Coat of Many Colors” are two of her most popular songs. Dolly also never forgot about the people of her home state.\n\nDolly Parton's Coat of Many Colors Album, Tennessee State Museum Collection.\n\nHere in Tennessee we know Dolly not just as the Queen of Country Music, but also as one of the most generous people too. One of the first things Dolly did to help the people of her hometown of Sevierville was to open Dollywood in 1986. Dollywood is a theme park that hires many local people to work there. Dollywood and her other business helped to bring in many tourists throughout the year. This increased the local economy. In 1995, she noticed that in her home county of Sevier the reading levels of the students were not high. She had an idea, one inspired by her father. Her father was never able to go to school and he never learned to read. She couldn’t help her dad as a child, but she could help the children of Sevier County. If she gave every child a book to read, they could have the chance to learn to read.\n\nImagination Library Book Collage taken from the Official Imagination Library Page.\n\nDolly Parton’s Imagination Library started in her hometown that same year. Every child would receive a book on the day they were born and then every month until their fifth birthday. Her program was a huge success! In 2004, the governor of Tennessee, Phil Bredesen, made it a statewide program. It became so popular that states around the country picked up the program. By 2019, children in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and The Republic of Ireland enjoyed receiving books from Dolly! In 2018, Dolly Parton was invited to read her story Coat of Many Colors to children at the Library of Congress. It was to celebrate the 100 millionth book given to a child. That book now sits on a shelf in the Library of Congress. In 2020, the Imagination Library was able to celebrate giving out their 150 millionth book.\n\nDolly has worked hard all her life. Because of this, she can give back to her Tennessee community, places, and people all around the world. If you ask a Tennessean, many will say they want to be a bit like Dolly Parton, the Queen of Tennessee.\n\nPrint of Dolly Parton, Taken from the collection of the Tennessee State Museum Collection.\n\nCountry Music - a genre of music that comes from the folk style of the Southern United States.\n\nAppalachian Mountains - the mountain range that runs from New Brunswick all the way down to Northern Alabama.\n\nFolk Tales - stories that are passed down through the generations orally, told out loud, among people.
