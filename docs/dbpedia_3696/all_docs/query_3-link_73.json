        "text": "Jerry Moss Plaza (Plaza) is a beautiful 35,000 square foot outdoor urban oasis and destination for free and low-cost programs such as The Music Center’s highly popular Dance DTLA, along with festivals, concerts, special events and other art-making experiences. The “Plaza for All” welcomes all and brings to life the strength and diversity of Los Angeles County and with a range of dining options, refreshing gardens, an iconic fountain and views of Grand Park and City Hall.\n\nThe Music Center’s three original theatres are united by the Plaza. The Plaza’s location was planned so it would form a unit with what is now Grand Park to the east and the Department of Water and Power building to the west, creating the largest open, landscaped area of any downtown in the United States. The original Music Center was united by a central sunken plaza designed by landscape architecture firm Cornell, Bridgers and Troller in association with Welton Becket & Associates. Its refined architectural design was reflected in the original landscaping, combining water, trees, ground cover and patterned pavement to create the atmosphere of a formal courtyard.\n\nIn January 2018, The Music Center closed the plaza for a major renovation helmed by the award-winning Los Angeles-based multidisciplinary architecture and design firm Rios Clementi Hale Studios, now known as Rios. The architects not only updated the plaza’s infrastructure but also created a more welcoming space along with five new buildings: Lisa Specht Welcome Center, Abernethy’s (a full-service restaurant), The Mullin Wine Bar, and permanent public restrooms. The plaza had a major public grand opening in August 2019 and, in 2020, was renamed Jerry Moss Plaza following a $25 million benefaction by Tina and Jerry Moss to support free and low-cost programming. The reimagined plaza creates a fifth venue for The Music Center campus.\n\nIn its architecture and civic design approach, Rios raised the plaza to one single accessible level with 48,000 square feet of flexible, usable outdoor space, reconfigured the Grand Avenue staircase and added two new escalators on either side of what is now the Terri and Jerry Kohl Stairs on Grand Avenue as a new “front door” for The Music Center. The plaza redesign allows for more open space for public events and performances, enhances the connection to the community and visually connects The Music Center to Grand Park, leveraging the synergies between two major county assets.\n\nNew drought tolerant landscaping enriches the hardscape surface of the Plaza, including 20 new “Geijera parviflora” (Australian Willow) trees, which have low water requirements and were chosen for their shade and graceful foliage character. Two new gardens allow wining and dining al fresco: The plaza’s Blue Ribbon Garden is adjacent to The Mullin Wine Bar and the Fredric Roberts Garden is next to Go Get Em Tiger. The gardens feature Melaleuca quinquenervia (Paperbark) trees plus California and other evergreen plantings in a vibrant lime green color palette. Each of the gardens has historical globe lighting fixtures that sat on the original plaza and were restored and relocated to illuminate the garden spaces.\n\nThe public and artists alike appreciate the two new 12’ x 20’ plaza LED screens, which are equipped with sensors and cameras. The screens provide the opportunity to create “art” on the plaza through multiple interactive experiences that incorporate people and movement throughout the space. Imagined by the artists of Music Center partners yU+co, the LED screens feature live feeds, machine learning and various filters that allow plaza visitors to generate their own living video art in realistic or abstract ways as their movement and actions on the plaza are reflected on the LED screens. The Lisa Specht Welcome Center also features a 6’ x 20’ interactive touch screen that provides information and personalized guidance for visitors about the entire Music Center complex; The Music Center’s resident companies and TMC Arts, The Music Center’s programming engine; events, food and beverage options; and members of The Music Center community.\n\nAs part of the renovation, The Music Center moved the Jacques Lipchitz-designed “Peace on Earth” sculpture due west from its previous location in the center of the plaza’s fountain. The sculpture is now a focal point on the Hope Street side of The Music Center complex in the Rose Hills Foundation Courtyard. Additionally, the “Dance Door” designed by Robert Graham, was re-positioned in the Fredric Roberts Garden on the east side of the plaza.\n\nTMC Arts programs Jerry Moss Plaza as both a civic and cultural space. In addition to arts programming, TMC Arts showcases artistic experiences on the plaza’s LED screens and also offers guests the opportunity to come together and share, actively or passively, in dialogue about civic issues and matters critical to each other, to the many communities in Los Angeles and to society overall. That can include showing the latest political debates—representing all sides of the political spectrum—town hall meetings, panels, talks and the like."
