Making your selections from the the Staples Centers suite menu a week prior to the game will ensure your suite is fully stocked upon your arrival. Lakers suites offer a wide range food and alcoholic options.\n\n×\n\nCatering Details\n\nIn-suite catering is usually not included with your suite purchase, unless it is clearly stated otherwise. Catering is optional - you can choose not to have your suite catered, or you can spend lavishly, or you can land anywhere in between. On average, our Staples Center customers spend $1,500 on catering.\n\nAll private boxes at the Staples Center offer professional suite catering by Levy Restaurants. Catering orders for your suite must be placed at least five business days before the event. You can also place food and drink orders on the day of the game through the attendant in your suite. Levy Restaurants has put together a menu that includes different packages and price points. The menu details the minimum number of people required to place an order on a per item or package basis. All ingredients are listed on the menu as well, making it easy to plan around food allergies or sensitivities in your party.\n\nParking and Transportation\n\nIf your Lakers suite includes parking, it's most likely for Lot 1 Garage or Lot C. The VIP lot is connected to Lot 1, closest to the Staples Center. Guests arriving by public transportation have many options to choose from including the Metro bus and DASH bus. Ride sharing is also easily accessible.\n\nBudget\n\nWhen budgeting for a Lakers suite rental, you must consider all costs along the way. A Lakers suite could range from $3,500-$12,000. In-suite catering is additional and you won't be charged for it until game day. On average, suite catering is going to be about $1,000-$2,000 depending on group size.\n\nClub Access\n\nPerks to a Lakers suite include access to various clubs within the Staples Center. These premium clubs are located on each suite level and have different food options, full bars, lounge areas, and flat screen TVs. A great place to hang out prior to the Lakers game starting or during half-time.\n\n×\n\nArena Club Details\n\nAll luxury suite tickets will include access to the exclusive San Manuel Club. The San Manuel Club is a high end bar and restaurant just for private suite ticket holders. Located on Delta Suite Level A, The San Manuel Club has many food options, a full bar, and 15 flat screen TVs. The San Manuel Club offers reservations. In addition, most suite ticket holders can access the exclusive Hyde Lounge at Staples Center, located on the C Level of Suites. This club has the feel of an LA Night Club with a view of world class sporting events and concerts. A select few suites also provide 4 tickets to the Lexus Club, where guests can make a dinner reservation for white table cloth dining in advance of your event.\n\nDress Code\n\nThe Lakers do not enforce a specific dress code on the suite levels. If it’s a corporate event, guests will likely be dressed in business casual attire or more formal coming directly from work. However, it’s not uncommon for guests to wear their favorite team gear with jeans and sneakers.\n\nVenue Bag Policy\n\nAny bags larger than 14” x 14” x 6” will not be allowed into the stadium, so please plan accordingly before you depart for Crypto.com Arena.

It all starts with Lebron James and Anthony Davis. James, at 38 years of age, is still dominating. The all-time great averaged nearly 29 points and over eight rebounds last year. Davis is an elite inside presence, averaging 12.5 rebounds and two blocks last campaign. They create one of the best one-two punches in the league. Besides the two, Los Angeles has immense depth at its disposal. Austin Reaves, D’Angelo Russell, Jarred Vanderbilt, and Rui Hachimura would all start on many teams. And the addition of guard Gabe Vincent, who starred for Miami last season, makes the Lakers daunting. Los Angeles has the star power and depth to win it all.\n\nCrypto.com Arena, the home of the Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers, has state-of-the-art amenities.

Los Angeles has the star power and depth to win it all.\n\nCrypto.com Arena, the home of the Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers, has state-of-the-art amenities. The Lexus Club is a members only intimate private restaurant, club, and terrace. The Delta SKY360 Club is the most exclusive dining experience at Crypto.com Arena, including courtside seating access, private entrance, inclusive food, and complimentary beverage offerings. The Hyde Lounge, a perfect environment to entertain clients, family, and friends, has VIP entry, suite level seating, TVs, and in-seat catering and bar options. And Los Angeles has incredible Suite opportunities. Ranging from 10-24 guests (with a chance to increase tickets), Suites include parking passes, catering, VIP access, and elite hosting areas. Bars, concessions, and restaurants are all accessible as well.\n\nPast Spotlights\n\nYou have to give the Lakers credit: even after winning a title two years prior, things weren’t working out with the current arrangement, so changes were made. Head coach Frank Vogel is out, replaced by longtime assistant Darvin Ham. Russell Westbrook exercised his player option, but Ham tried him out as the lead of the second unit in the preseason, which could yield interesting results. Of course, there’s LeBron James and Anthony Davis, and their health will be key. Patrick Beverley and Dennis Schroder are also new additions.\n\nFeel like the celebrities who attend Lakers games by catching the game in a suite at Crypto.com Arena. Luxury suites of all sizes are available, ranging from 12-132 people, and ring the entire 300 level of the venue. You’ll get the VIP treatment right from the start with a private entrance to the arena along with in-suite catering for any budget.\n\nThe return of the king always gives the “Lake Show” a legitimate chance at another NBA Championship. Four-time league MVP LeBron James will be joined by another recipient of that prestigious trophy: Russell Westbrook. The offense still runs through big man Anthony Davis as long as he’s on the court and upright. Davis played only half of the regular season while nursing a calf/Achilles injury. In terms of veteran presence, the Lakers boast a veritable who’s who on the bench. Rajon Rondo, Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan, and Carmelo Anthony may be beyond their All-Star glory days, but their experience remains immeasurable. Taking in the action at one of the world’s most prestigious arenas only get better with a Staples Center Premium Membership. Be it the Lexus Club or the San Manuel Club, fans can get a taste of real luxury in addition to Lakers basketball. For a true one-of-a-kind experience there’s the Hyde Society Membership. Parties from 2-to-250 can relax in the luxurious Hyde Lounge with dedicated account manager and concierge service, in addition to receiving invitations to exclusive events throughout the year.\n\nTOP\n\n×\n\nCrypto.com Arena / Los Angeles Lakers Suite Map and Seating Chart\n\nThe seating chart below shows where the Los Angeles Lakers suites at Crypto.com Arena are located.\n\n×\n\nStay in Touch\n\nBook a Suite\n\nThank you\n\nThank you for submitting your request.

If this is the case, certain clients are willing to pay a premium to be in a lower level suite that is closest to the action on the field. We will give you details on suite location as we provide you with availability for the game you desire.\n\nDoes it pay to wait to book a suite until closer to the event?\n\nWith regular tickets, prices will often drop in the days leading up to a game. While every once in a while the same occurs with suites, in general, pricing does not drop before the game. In fact, because of the very limited availability of luxury suites, it is advised to book a suite well in advance, as suites are often not available at the last minute. In addition, in coordinating events for larger groups (suites can hold up to 20 guests or more), it is often necessary to give guests a longer lead time to confirm their availability to attend.\n\nAre there additional expenses I should consider?\n\nIf you are hosting guests in your suite, consider allocating enough budget to order catering for your suite. Catering is typically not included in the price of the suite. Suite Experience Group clients typically spend between $1,000-$2,000 for catering, with some clients spending even more if they order significant amounts of alcohol.\n\nAre there discounts if I buy multiple games at once?\n\nSome clients purchase multiple suites in multiple venues at one time. Suite Experience Group can provide special package pricing for clients who buy three or more suites at one time.\n\nHow can I maximize my budget?\n\nIf you are working within a budget and trying to maximize your spend, we would welcome an opportunity to further discuss your goals for the event and the different options available to you. Please call us at 800-592-7043 or fill out this form to get started. We look forward to the opportunity to help you explore your options in renting a luxury suite."
