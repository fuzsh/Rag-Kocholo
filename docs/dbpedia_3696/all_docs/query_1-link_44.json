        "text": "There hasn’t been any change at the University of Northern Colorado in the past six months.\n\nThat’s not good news as the school’s athletic department attempts to put more cheeks in the seats at home events – primarily football, men’s and women’s basketball, volleyball and wrestling.\n\nUNC fans are mingling at Bank of Colorado Arena among more than 1,000 empty seats on a given night.\n\nThe parking lot at the Butler-Hancock Athletic Center seldom needs the third tier, which sits closer to Nottingham Field.\n\nThere are virtually no lines to speak of outside the ticket office on game nights.\n\nTechnically, the products inside the doors doesn’t match the mass of empty blue seats.\n\nIn fact, UNC senior associate athletic director David Sabolcik indicated he’s not overly concerned about attendance figures, and won’t be until the end of the school year.\n\nSabolcik also explaned there are a lot of factors to look at, including the role of social media, weather conditions and games being scheduled during the Christmas holidays.\n\n“Attendance is down for everybody in the country,” Sabolcik stated. “It’s a battle for everybody.”\n\nThe NCAA reports that men’s basketball attendance is down six percent from a year ago at this time.\n\nThe UNC men’s basketball team has taken great strides to emerge from the shadow of an NCAA violation that is partially behind it.\n\nMen’s basketball coach Jeff Linder, whose team drew more than 1,000 a week ago in an overtime victory over North Dakota, publicly talked about attendance at home games, or a lack thereof, on his weekly radio show in December.\n\n“Maybe what’s happened in the past (an NCAA violation) effects the support a little bit, but with the product on the floor, I can’t see why the community can’t rally around this team,” Linder said on his weekly radio show. “Especially after what our student athletes had to go through the last 18 months.”\n\nLinder has challenged UNC’s students and the community for more support – for all of UNC’s athletic programs.\n\n“When I was at Weber State, the crowds at first, weren’t that great,” Linder said.\n\nWeber State University leads the Big Sky Conference in attendance for men’s basketball games, averaging 6,869 last season at the Dee Events Center, which seats 11,592.\n\n“You have to build it,” Linder said on his radio show during the Christmas holiday. “When the students come back (from Christmas break), it will help, but there’s no reason why that gym shouldn’t be full. That will (help) take us to another level. The kids represent the university and the community in the right way.”\n\nLinder continued his rant by explaining that a homecourt advantage atmosphere can also boost recruiting.\n\n“You have to be able to separate yourself when recruits come to the gym and see an atmosphere that’s different than other places,” he said.\n\nThe women’s basketball team is having one of its better seasons in recent years, yet it’s a long way from being a tough ticket.\n\nThe Bears drew less than 800 fans for a game Thursday night but played in front of 893 on Saturday in a victory over Eastern Washington University.\n\nTheir overall average is down, despite being atop or near the top of the BSC standings all season long and being ranked in the top 20 in the NCAA Mid-Major poll for more than two months.\n\nLast season, the women’s basketball team played in front of a packed house, compliments of District 6 Middle School Student day. All Greeley Middle School students were admitted free of charge.\n\n“What a crowd,” UNC coach Kamie Ethridge said. “Now if we can only figure out how to get some of them back to more of our games.”\n\nThere is a another Middle School Day scheduled for noon on Feb. 8.\n\nUNC’s football team labored through a 3-7 season, and outside of the homecoming game that annually draws a decent size crowd and the season opener, Nottingham Field remains quaint and cozy instead of loud, rowdy and tough on opponents.\n\nIt’s important to realize that UNC has a decades-long reputation of being a “suitcase college” where students flock to the Denver area and beyond on weekends.\n\nThe school also competes against an allegiance of faithful followers to the University of Colorado and neighboring Colorado State University in Fort Collins, both less than an hour’s drive from Greeley.\n\nThose reasons for average-sized crowds have long been excuses and often fall on deaf ears.\n\nMaybe the best example of UNC’s uphill battle was exhibited on Friday night when only 405 fans showed up for the Bears’ Big 12 Conference wrestling matchup with Fresno State University.\n\nUNC athletic director Darren Dunn said upon his arrival four years ago “we want to make coming to UNC events the thing to do if you’re from this community, or even if you’re not.”\n\nDunn has repeatedly used the term “family friendly,” to describe UNC’s atmosphere in an attempt to draw bigger crowds.\n\n“We have a much improved football product,” Dunn offered before the Bears’ latest season. “We have a men’s basketball product that’s going to get a lot better, really fast. We have great products to sell.”\n\nWhether or not UNC has sold its products any better in the last six months is up for debate.\n\nTHE SAME ‘OL, SAME ‘OL\n\nStagnant may be the best way to describe UNC’s attendance issue.\n\nA solid season-ticket base continues to carry most of the load, but walk-up sales lag for a school whose enrollment fluctuates around 12,000 students in a city with more than 100,000 population falls behind most projections.\n\nThere is no easy answer.\n\nUNC’s challenge may be like evolution – it evolves from what came before it with an eye on its potential – but it’s not surmountable.\n\nBank of Colorado Arena, then Butler-Hancock Sports Pavilion, was beyond capacity in 2011 when the men’s basketball team played host to and won the Big Sky Conference postseason tournament in front of a standing-room only crowd of nearly 3,000.\n\nBank of Colorado Arena’s capacity is listed at 2,992.\n\nThe only other time the venue has even been close to being sold out was when the wrestling team played host to Big 10 Minnesota in its first match against a major Division I opponent after making the change from NCAA Division II to Division I.\n\nStanding room only has only applied once in the last decade – for the BSC postseason basketball tournament – and studies have been conducted to try and figure out where fans are spending their entertainment dollar.\n\nThe figures didn’t reveal any specific area that UNC followers spend their entertainment dollar.\n\nUNC has done its part to make tickets affordable with a handful of pricing packages.\n\nDunn is big on promoting UNC’s affordability, especially for football.\n\nPremium-seating tickets, in the High Plains Room, that include meals and parking are in the neighborhood of $700 for a season ticket.\n\nFamily plans cost $50 to $100 for a season ticket.\n\nSeating on Nottingham Field’s south terrace, which includes food, are $400 per season.\n\nBenchback reserved season tickets are $150. General admission season tickets are $65, while a family four-pack season ticket is $160.\n\nSabolcik initiated the “Send A Bear” program, designed to reach out to at-risk youth.\n\nThe program allows companies to buy tickets at a reduced rate. UNC officials will locate at-risk youth than can use the tickets.\n\n“That’s been going good,” Sabolcik said. “It’s in its first year and we’ve received good feedback from the community. We were down a sales position role this year, but once we fill that I thik there will be an uphill rise.”\n\nPROMOTION\n\nThe school promotes, but mainly on campus.\n\nA recent stroll amongst retail merchants in downtown Greeley found there is little to no promotion for UNC athletics.\n\nThe presence of a schedule/poster in store windows is few and far between.\n\nCloser to campus, there’s only a smiget of UNC presence, a schedule/poster at The Dugout in the Hillside Mall and one at Qdoba’s, which has displayed a horde of schedules and posters in the past.\n\nAt Stuft – A Burger Bar, where Linder’s weekly radio show takes place, there was a lot more evidence of UNC support.\n\nThere were no schedule cards at any merchant close to campus.\n\nIn July, Dunn mentioned that his staff has done a “good job” marketing its product.\n\n“We, including me, still have a lot of work to do in order to be an outbound company rather than an inbound company,” Dunn said.\n\nUNC lost the location battle long ago, partly because its proximity to Denver and not being the only ticket in town.\n\nOn a national basis, the Bears rank about halfway down the ladder for average attendance for their four most visible sports – football, women’s and men’s basketball and volleyball.\n\nThat’s actually good news considering that the student section at Nottingham Field traditionally clears out at halftime of football games.\n\nIn neighboring communities – Kersey, Eaton, Windsor, Ault, Johnstown and Gilcrest – any sort of UNC promotion is nowhere to be found.\n\nAdditional attendance has come with big-name opponents – then No 3-ranked Oklahoma State for wrestling and Louisiana State University for women’s basketball – but both events fell way short of selling out.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nThe attendance numbers for UNC’s home games are slightly down all the way across the board.\n\nThe football team averaged 4,895 for the 2016 season when they were in contention for a postseason berth. This season, the average dipped to 4,383.\n\nLast season, the average attendance for men’s basketball games was 1,205. So far this season, it’s 1,194.\n\nAverage attendance at women’s basketball games this season has been 720, way down from an average of 1,078 last season.\n\nUNC’s volleyball team averaged 806 fans for 14 home matches this season, well below an average of 919 in 2016.\n\nAttendance figures for home wrestling matches is also down from this past season when the Bears averaged 704 fans. They’re averaging just 582 fans for four home matches this season. “Attendance at the last two matches have been disappointing,” Sabolcik said. “We haven’t compared last year to this year yet, but I know that fans play a lot of attention to other things going on in town. We definitely noticed smaller crowds for the last two matches, and maybe that was because they were on Friday nights when there’s other (high school) events going on that people pay a lot of attention to.”\n\nWHAT ROLE DOES MEDIA PLAY?\n\nMedia exposure for UNC is comparable to most Division I Mid-Major schools, minus those who are literally the only ticket in town – North Dakota State and the University of Montana as the best examples.\n\nAll of UNC’s football games and the men’s basketball games are on radio along with a respectable amount of games on television.\n\nTherein may be part of the problem.\n\n“It’s so easy to watch games on TV or on your phone,” Linder said. “It’s hard to get people in the gym. It’s too easy to sit at home. We have to scratch and claw and keep winning … that’s what will get people in the gym.”\n\nThe school’s athletic marketing/promotions and sports information departments, do a commendable job of promoting via social media, including Twitter and Bears Vision, which produces postgame interviews with players and coaches along with highlights.\n\n“I’m not sure what role the media plays,” Sabolcik said. “The Big Sky Conference added a big tool this year with Pluto TV, so it’s easier to watch games from home now. I’d like to think of (Pluto TV) as a positive, but you can stay at home in your pajamas, and snacks are a little cheaper at home, too.”\n\nStill, Sabolcik maintained that’s he’s yet to be overly concerned.\n\n“Revenues are up for every sport,” Sabolcik said. “We had more complimentary tickets issued last year. We cut that back about 20 percent for football this year. Now, unless our attendance is down more than 20 percent, we’re doing fine. We also had two bad weather games.”\n\nLinder, who was an assistant coach at Division II Emporia State University (Emporia, Kan.) compared the situation at Emporia State (enrollment of 6,114) to what UNC faces.\n\n“We started it, and then there were 4,500 to 5,000 people in the William L. White Auditorium every night,” Linder said. “Emporia is smaller than Greeley.” Emporia’s population is less then 50,000. The William L. What Auditorium, a multi-purpose facility, seats 5,000.\n\nBank of Colorado Arena’s capacity is listed at 2,992.\n\n“We need community support to take all of our programs to the next level,” Linder said. “We put a good product on the floor, the price is right and you have a chance to see some really good basketball.”\n\nLinder’s squad was coming off a victory at the University of Wyoming, UNC’s first at UW’s Auditorium-Arena in 80 years and a close loss to the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.\n\n“We were starting our conference play at 9-4 (overall) and played (Idaho) on a Friday night and there was no mention of the game,” Linder said. “People can say what they want, but the university is a big part of this community. All I can control is the product.”\n\nHe also mentioned Gonzaga, a Jesuit (Mid-Major) school in Spokane, Wash., that is consistently ranked in the Top 20.\n\nGonzaga plays its games in the 6,000-seat McCarthy Athletic Center, built in 2004 after the Bulldogs regularly sold out 2,500-seat Kennel at the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre.\n\nGood luck finding a ticket for Gonzaga games at McCartney Athletic Center.\n\n“It makes a difference when there’s more people in the stands,” Linder said. “We have to build a fan base. It would be one thing if there wasn’t a quality product on the floor. We have great kids, and they deserve great support.”"
