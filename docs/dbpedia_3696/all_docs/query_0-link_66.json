Click the picture for a larger image.\n\n1983\n\nA study group is appointed to determine how to coordinate implementation of a new technology called surface mounting. The study group estimates that surface mount technology will impact more than 50 IPC technical committees.\n\nIPC again sues the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over the requirements for Total Toxic Organics (TTO). The result of the suit is a revision in the requirements for TTO.\n\nA new Advanced Packaging Technology Committee is established under the chairmanship of Foster Gray, Texas Instruments.\n\nIPC-A-610, Acceptability of Electronic Assemblies, is released. Since 1983, IPC has published more than 200,000 printed copies of this document with hundreds of thousands of electronic file users. The IPC-A-610 is the most published and most referenced standard in IPC's history. Today, in addition to English, the document is also available in Chinese, Danish, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Polish, Spanish, Swedish, Russian, Hungarian, Czech, Romanian and Vietnamese. Future plans call for the document to be published in Japanese and Turkish and possibly in other languages.\n\nPresenting at the 1983 Fall Meeting were (left to right) H. Sakata, Matsushita; I. Hishioka, Sharp; K. Tsukanishi, Hitachi Chemical; Y. Yoshikawa, Daisho Electronics; and Dr. Hayao Nakahara.\n\n1984\n\nIPC is the first organization to recognize the importance of a group of companies called contract electronics manufacturers. IPC completes the first major study of the market for the industry, reporting sales of $1.4 billion (non-value add) for U.S. contract manufacturers.\n\nPrinted Circuit World Convention III (PCWC III) is held in Washington, D.C.\n\nAn electronic information retrieval program is developed for members.\n\nIPC applies for and receives ANSI accreditation as a standards developing organization.\n\nIPC members vote unanimously to revise the bylaws to include contract assembly companies as Regular Members.\n\nKey representatives at PCWC III were (seated) Reuben Josephs, Nevin Electric; Rolly Mettler, Circuit-Wise; Theo Passlick, Fuba-Hans Kolbe; and Hitoshi Aizawa, Hitachi Chemical.

This year, in cooperation with the Wharton School of Finance, IPC conducts East Coast and West Coast Financial Management Seminars.\n\nA promotional brochure describing the importance of is published and circulated to member companies, as well as to colleges and universities.\n\nWith more than 20,000 individuals on the IPC mailing list, it is impossible to send all mailings to everyone at each member company. Consequently, a new category of Participating Member is created. (Membership fee is $200.) Participating members receive the same mailings sent to Official Representatives.\n\nElectronic Industries Association (EIA), with IPC, initiates the Surface Mount and Reflow Technology Conference and Exhibition (SMART).\n\nSeated: Bob Wright, Midi; Sam Sapienza, Wharton School of Finance; John Misilli, Photocircuits; and Rolly Mettler, Circuit-Wise, were the organizers of the Financial Management Seminars.\n\n1986\n\nOnly 15% of PWB panels contain one or more surface mount applications. However, the outlook is for surface mount technology (SMT) to eventually dominate the electronics industry, and there is a tremendous need to share information on this technology.\n\nBecause of this need, the Surface Mount Council (SMC), a joint effort between IPC and EIA, is formed. The intent of the council is to gather the most knowledgeable experts from EIA and IPC to identify and create programs to overcome the technological barriers to SMT.\n\nThe IPC Long-Range Planning Committee targets six areas for programming:\n\nInternational Standards\n\nNeed to Improve Communications\n\nU.S. Regional Meetings/Chapters\n\nInternational Meetings and Seminars\n\nExpanding Packaging Activities\n\nFormat for Semiannual Meetings\n\nFor the first time, IPC holds meetings in Europe and Asia to review a proposal for a new standard for surface mount land patterns (IPC-SM-782).\n\nRecognizing that almost 80 percent of all independent PWB manufacturers have sales of less than $5 million, IPC sponsors management meetings on the East and West Coasts aimed directly at the interests and problems of small PWB manufacturers.\n\nUnder the leadership of Maynard Eaves, Hewlett Packard, IPC publishes a Quality Evaluation Handbook for PWBs and a comprehensive series of slides.\n\nIPC headquarters move to 7380 N. Lincoln Avenue, Lincolnwood, Illinois.\n\n1987-1996 Highlights\n\n1987\n\nPrinted Circuit World Convention IV (PCWC IV) is held in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nA survey of membership interest in Europe is followed up with an IPC meeting in Zurich to discuss how IPC can best serve European members.\n\nWorking with the International Society of Hybrid Microelectronics (now called IMAPS), IPC initiates the Hybrid Marketing Research Council to develop market statistics and technology trends.\n\nIPC determines that there should be an expanded structure for technical activities to provide a separate section for interconnections and packaging.\n\nParticipants in the \"best of\" series on laminates were (seated) Sid Kimber, Digital Equipment; Steve Gurley, Rogers; Tony Hilvers, IPC; and Joe Berkowitz, Mica; (standing) Dieter Bergman, IPC; Dwayne Poteet, Texas Instruments; Jack Bramel and Dave McGowan, Polyclad; and John Lampe, Martin-Marietta.

The IPC organizes legal counsel from all 20 companies to act in concert to defend these suits. Because of this strong cooperative effort, both suits are dropped.\n\nThe DoD 2000 series of soldering standards is a significant step in aligning the multiple standards developed by various government agencies. IPC sponsors workshops throughout the country with representatives from government and industry to reach agreement on the DoD soldering specifications.\n\nSeated: Fred Murphy, Unisys; Susan Mansilla, Robison Labs; Leo Lambert, Digital Equipment; Roger Jones, ATandT; Les Hymes, General Electric; and Ray Prasad, Intel.

IPC volunteers to conduct these studies and develop a benchmark testing program to evaluate alternatives to CFCs for assembly defluxing.\n\nIPC cooperates with DoD on future standards on statistical process controls (SPC) rather than on end product performance.\n\nIn cooperation with the EIA and the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM), IPC publishes a joint document, Standardization and Implementation Requirements for Fine Pitch Technology.\n\nA second joint U.S./European meeting is held in cooperation with the EIPC and the Printed Circuit Interconnection Federation (PCIF), in Denmark.\n\nShearson Lehman publishes a scathing research report on the U.S. PWB industry, which sets in motion a series of management programs designed to blunt the report.\n\nMembers of the newly formed Energy Committee. George Messner, PCK Technology, and Jim Rogers, Digital Equipment, were the original co-chairmen Click the picture for a larger image.\n\n1990\n\nThomas Dammrich, senior vice president for the Illinois Bankers Association, succeeds Ray Pritchard as IPC Executive Director.\n\nPrinted Circuit World Convention V (PCWC V) is held in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nWork begins on the creation of the World Federation of PWB manufacturers. A meeting is held in September in the U.K., attended by representatives from IPC, the JPCA, and the following European organizations: EIPC, PCIF, and Verband der Deutschen Leiterplattenindustrie BV (VdL).\n\n\"Audit for Excellence\" is launched by IPC for PWB manufacturers. This new program includes a series of audited criteria by which individual companies can measure how they compare to other companies in the industry. Later in the year, this program, which outlines 14 separate categories for leadership, is renamed \"Excellence through Leadership.\"\n\nIPC cooperates with the MIT School of Management to study interfirm relationships between PWB manufacturers, their customers, and PWB suppliers.\n\nn the center, Thom Dammrich; on the left, Ray Pritchard; and on the right, Larry Velie, president of the IPC.\n\n1991\n\nIPC begins in earnest to develop a presence in Washington, D.C., to represent member interests in legislation and regulatory activities.\n\nIPC participates with National Association of Metal Finishers (NAMF) in the first Capitol Hill Day. Members meet with U.S. Senators and Congressmen during this day and begin the long journey of familiarizing these representatives with the industry.\n\nIn recognition of IPC's need to play a stronger role not only in matters of legislation but also in environmental issues, R. Wayne Sayer is retained as the official Washington-based Government Relations Consultant. It is further decided that IPC will hold its own Capitol Hill Days in the future.\n\nA $10,000 contribution is authorized to the California Circuits Association (CCA) for their efforts in fighting unreasonable environmental legislation in California.\n\nThe IPC Board of Directors receives approval from the members for a new Mission Statement:\n\nThe IPC is a United States-based trade association dedicated to furthering the competitive excellence and financial success of its members worldwide who are participants in the electronic interconnect industry.\n\nIn pursuit of these objectives, the IPC will devote resources to management improvement and technology enhancement programs, the creation of relevant standards, protection of the environment, and pertinent government relations.\n\nThe IPC encourages the active participation of all its Regular, Allied, and Associate Members in these activities and commits to full cooperation with all related national and international organizations.\n\nThe EMS Management Council determines that a more appropriate identity for contract assembly companies needs to be created. They correctly believe that the industry will expand its services from consignment to turnkey, and then to system build. They create and popularize a new name: the Electronics Manufacturing Services Industry (EMSI). Wall Street welcomes this name change, which helps reposition the industry to the investment community.\n\nNinety-one separate ideas are reviewed for expanding IPC programs. These ideas are organized into nine distinct categories:\n\nInternational Programs\n\nMembership Definition\n\nManagement Programs\n\nThe Need for Excellence\n\nEnvironmental Issues\n\nUnderstanding Members Needs and Cooperation with Related Groups\n\nStatistical Process Control (SPC) Programs\n\nTechnology Requirements\n\nMeeting Structure\n\nIPC is invited to join the Electronics Roundtable, composed of key representatives of the major electronics industry associations that provide a focus and direction for public policy activities of the U.S. high technology community.\n\nIPC is named administrator for OZONET by ICOLP (International Cooperative for Ozone Layer Protection) because of its ability to provide electronic information retrieval. This is a joint project to provide a worldwide resource on eliminating the use of CFCs.\n\nAlong with EIA, Surface Mount Technology Association (SMTA), and Miller Freeman, IPC cosponsors the first Surface Mount International (SMI) conference and exhibition in San Jose, California. This initial conference and exhibit is a success with 432 booths and more than 4,000 attendees.

Today, the IPC Designers Council, with more than 1,000 members and 33 chapters, is an international network of designers. Its mission is to promote printed board and printed board assembly design as a profession and to encourage, facilitate and promote the exchange of information and integration of new design concepts through communications, seminars, workshops and professional certification through a network of local chapters.\n\nTo help members address the growing influence of ISO 9000, IPC publishes the General Requirement for Implementation of ISO 9000 Quality Systems.\n\nThe third European Joint Technical Conference is held in Brussels, Belgium.\n\nThe results of the first comprehensive IPC Benchmarking Study are published, providing participants an opportunity to measure their capabilities against the best companies in a wide variety of technical and management categories.\n\nThe 194-page JPCA report, The Printed Circuit Industry in Japan, is translated and published.\n\nA biannual wage and salary study is introduced for EMS members.\n\nIPC \"Book-to-Bill\" ratios for U.S. PWB manufacturers are released. The book-to-bill ratio can be used as one of the predictors for the industry and is still watched closely by financial analysts today.\n\nWanting increased influence and programming within IPC, the PWB Suppliers hold an organizational meeting in San Jose. Dan Feinberg, Morton Electronic Materials, is selected as the first chairman of the IPC PWB Suppliers Management Council. During the meeting, the council identifies their initial priorities:\n\nGetting the most for their trade show buck\n\nOEM-Technology Interchange\n\nRecycling\n\nIPC Past President Larry Velie (seated center), Velie Circuits, and IPC Executive Director Thom Dammrich (top left) with 13 IPC President's Awards recipients (standing, left to right): Douglas Sober, Essex Technologies Group; Vern Solberg, SCI; Russel Griffith, Dynaco Corporation; John Kelly, Motorola; Jorgen Svensson, Ericsson Telecom; Robert Keltz, Westinghouse/Fortin; Masamitsu Aoki, Toshiba Chemical Corporation; and (seated, left to right): O.

A trade show subcommittee of the Council creates a revolutionary philosophy for the event: It should be fair, focused and cost effective by and for the industry. These tenets still guide the exhibition today.\n\nTo serve the electronics assembly industry's need for market research and technology trends, IPC launches the Assembly Marketing Research Council (AMRC). The Council will be patterned after the highly successful TMRC. The first meeting is held jointly with TMRC in New Orleans in December.\n\nRecognizing the importance of providing the industry with the requirements for future technology, IPC holds a workshop in Chicago to begin work on development of the Technology Roadmap. The IPC Technology Roadmap is still published today and is now available free of charge to members.\n\nParticipants in the initial conference to develop the Technology Roadmap.

More than 1,700 people attend the Expo, which features 275 booths representing 158 companies.\n\nThis is not simply an exhibition, however. The event reflects a major effort to provide technology exchange within the industry. IPC Printed Circuits Expo features more than 60 technical papers, 17 workshops, and nearly 100 committee meetings to develop standards for the industry.\n\nIPC establishes the Interconnect Technology Research Institute (ITRI), to be headed by D. Marshall Andrews. This was a key recommendation of the IPC Technology Roadmap released in 1993. To keep pace with international technology, it is clear that the US PWB manufacturing industry needs a practical forum to undertake cooperative technical research.\n\nThe first IPC certification and training program based on IPC-A-610B, Acceptability of Electronic Assemblies, is implemented. Today, IPC-A-610 training is conducted in many languages around the world and has a user base of more than 10,000 instructor certifications. These instructors, in turn, have trained nearly 125,000 engineers, operators, inspectors, buyers and members of management teams. In addition, this certification program has spawned a number of other IPC certification efforts.\n\nThe IPC Designers Council plans for a new certification program for designers as a means to improve the education and stature of designers in the electronics industry.\n\nIPC video expands into interactive multimedia production on CD-ROM, allowing students to learn at their own pace.\n\nIPC staff becomes accessible by e-mail.\n\nRetiring IPC President Sam Altschuler, Altron (far left), presented the 1994 President's Award to the industry experts shown in the photo above.

The title of the chief elected officer is changed from president to chairman of the Board of Directors. The title of the executive director is changed to president.\n\nITRI releases its first technical report:Improvements/Alternatives to Mechanical Drilling of PWB Vias.\n\nMembership in IPC hits an all-time high. Two thousand companies/divisions of companies, located in more than 50 countries, are now members of IPC.\n\nMore than 100 IPC members participate in the development of a Long-Range Strategic Plan approved by the Board in March. The Long-Range Plan defines five specific strategies to carry IPC into the new millennium:\n\nIndustry Leadership\n\nWork Force Development and Training\n\nIndustry Standards/Technical Assistance\n\nCommunications, Networking and Participation\n\nGlobal Involvement to Benefit Members\n\nIPC is awarded a grant from the State of Illinois, along with Northwestern University, to create an Illinois Electronics Manufacturing Extension Center to aid Illinois manufacturers.\n\nIn recognition of the excellence of IPC standards, the Department of Defense and ANSI adopt IPC-J-STD-001, J-STD-004, J-STD-005 and J-STD-006.\n\nWith the increasing interest in the growth and development of China, IPC sponsors a tour of PWB plants in Beijing and Shanghai. In addition, participants in the tour attend the China Printed Circuit Association International Printed Circuit Technological Equipment Exhibition in Shanghai.\n\nWith the increasing interest in PWB developments in China, IPC sponsored a tour of PWB plants in Beijing and Shanghai.
