The Hornets drafted Alabama star Brandon Miller with the second pick in this year’s draft. Miller averaged almost 19 points and over eight rebounds in his freshman year of college. He joins an already young and electric group of playmakers. Guard Lamelo Ball has, when healthy, been one of the premier players in the league. Ball put up 23.3 points, 8.4 assists, and over 6 assists in 36 games in 2022-23. Center Mark Williams is entering his second season and was a breakout player last year. And forward P.J. Washington just had a career-high 15.7 points per game. Charlotte’s youth, and budding potential, makes an interesting roster with its best years ahead.\n\nSpectrum Center has plenty to offer for luxury seating. Courtside seats allow for exclusive access, complimentary dining, exclusive parking, and more. Club Seats in Charlotte provide access to multiple VIP locations. They have great views, access to the FrontCourt Restaurant, complimentary parking, pre-sale opportunities, a personal account manager, and other amenities. Charlotte also has Boxes and Suites for use. Royal Boxes deliver first-class hospitality in a semi-private and “open-air” environment. Access to Club lounges, great sightlines, convenient parking, private entrance, and premium content are a part of the package. Suites at Spectrum Center give elite opportunities to spectators. Private Access, upscale dining, premium parking, shopping discounts, and exclusive events are all available.\n\nPast Spotlights\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets are pushing to get to the next level, and after reaching the Play-In round of the postseason the last two years, they are calling upon a familiar face to get solidly into the playoffs. After he helped Orlando reach the playoffs in 2019 and ’20, Steve Clifford left the Magic after a disagreement with the front office’s philosophy, and now he’s back in Charlotte. Center Mark Williams, drafted out of nearby Duke, and re-signing Cody Martin for his defense will provide Clifford with two players who fit his coaching style, and they will complement LaMelo Ball and Terry Rozier. A healthy Gordon Hayward will also provide a veteran presence that has helped the club the past two years.\n\nYour choice of Royal Boxes or traditional suites awaits at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte. A Royal Box is a semi-private experience but still a first-class avenue to see the game. Nearby parking and a VIP entrance are included along with access to the club lounges. In the fully private suites, you get the same parking and private entrance perks, and then once inside, you can choose from an upscale dining menu and have access to your in-suite attendant.\n\nThe buzz surrounding this nest of budding stars grows louder entering the new season. The Hornets hit big time in the draft as Lamelo Ball was the runaway winner of the Rookie of the Year Award following a stellar first season. The ballhandling wizard looks to improve on his impressive numbers of more than 15 points, six assists, five rebounds, and nearly two steals a game. As Ball gets better so does his favorite alley-oop target, Miles Bridges, who could be one of the league’s breakout stars as he enters his fourth season. Gordon Heyward and Terry Rozier provide strong support cast help, and the addition of center Mason Plumlee, who played his college ball in the state of North Carolina, could bolster the defense in the paint. When it comes to spectating at the Spectrum Center, it starts with a one-of-a-kind, first-class hospitality experience that are the Royal Box seats. A semi-private spot with an open-air design unlike what you’ll find at major arenas. For a more traditional premium adventure, the Spectrum Center’s luxury suites offer upscale dining, parking, and discounts at the Fan Shop. True basketball fans will love the up-close look from their Courtside Seats, which includes exclusive access to the Grant Thornton Crown Club for complimentary food, beer, and wine.\n\nLooking for a different team or stadium?\n\nWe rent out suites all over the country\n\nTOP\n\n×\n\nSpectrum Center / Charlotte Hornets Suite Map and Seating Chart\n\nThe seating chart below shows where the Charlotte Hornets suites at Spectrum Center are located.\n\n×\n\nStay in Touch\n\nBook a Suite\n\nThank you\n\nThank you for submitting your request.

If this is the case, certain clients are willing to pay a premium to be in a lower level suite that is closest to the action on the field. We will give you details on suite location as we provide you with availability for the game you desire.\n\nDoes it pay to wait to book a suite until closer to the event?\n\nWith regular tickets, prices will often drop in the days leading up to a game. While every once in a while the same occurs with suites, in general, pricing does not drop before the game. In fact, because of the very limited availability of luxury suites, it is advised to book a suite well in advance, as suites are often not available at the last minute. In addition, in coordinating events for larger groups (suites can hold up to 20 guests or more), it is often necessary to give guests a longer lead time to confirm their availability to attend.\n\nAre there additional expenses I should consider?\n\nIf you are hosting guests in your suite, consider allocating enough budget to order catering for your suite. Catering is typically not included in the price of the suite. Suite Experience Group clients typically spend between $1,000-$2,000 for catering, with some clients spending even more if they order significant amounts of alcohol.\n\nAre there discounts if I buy multiple games at once?\n\nSome clients purchase multiple suites in multiple venues at one time. Suite Experience Group can provide special package pricing for clients who buy three or more suites at one time.\n\nHow can I maximize my budget?\n\nIf you are working within a budget and trying to maximize your spend, we would welcome an opportunity to further discuss your goals for the event and the different options available to you. Please call us at 800-592-7043 or fill out this form to get started. We look forward to the opportunity to help you explore your options in renting a luxury suite."
