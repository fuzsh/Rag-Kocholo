        "text": "Founded in 1993 as a mission church with a Sunday service of 75 people, this contemporary, innovative congregation now welcomes over 4,000 people each weekend. In 2002, the church purchased a new 120-acre site and commissioned LS3P to design a master plan and a new worship center.\n\nThe 110,000 SF worship center features an auditorium with riser seating and a capacity for 2,500 people. A 2-story education area accommodates 1,200 children, with a series of smaller auditoriums and breakout spaces. Through the use of a movable wall system, one of the auditoriums also serves as the churchâ€™s chapel. The spaces are connected by a 2-story concourse including information kiosks, a cafe, and a bookstore.\n\nSF: 110,000"
