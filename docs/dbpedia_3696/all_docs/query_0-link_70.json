        "text": "A college football stadium named after Pitbull? Picture that with a Kodak.\n\nOr better yet, go to Pitbull Stadium on 8th Street in Miami, and take a picture of it with a Kodak.\n\nFlorida International University made a groundbreaking announcement Tuesday morning, announcing an official partnership with famed international rapper Armando Christian Pérez, better known by his stage name Pitbull. The most notable part of the announcement involved the change of the 29-year old venue’s name from FIU Stadium to Pitbull Stadium, making it the first FBS stadium named after a musician.\n\n“We have five core values in our athletic department,” FIU athletic director Scott Carr said. “One of them is think big, and I think we thought big on this, so we accomplished one of our core values.”\n\nPitbull was present at the Tuesday press conference held at Tamiami Hall on the FIU campus, alongside FIU administration, athletics staff, and players. The Miami native referenced his FIU ties, expanding on his close relationship with many university alumni, as well as his love for the Miami-Dade County 305 area.\n\n“For me what it boils down to, is Miami is always known for being underdogs,” Pitbull said. “No matter what we do and what level we take it to. Being underdogs is what I always felt about FIU, fighting, clawing their way just to be seen, to be recognized whether it be through business, education, or sports... When it came about, it came just like a Miami-Dade County 305 idea came about. Nobody would believe in it.”\n\nPitbull’s partnership at FIU extends beyond a sign on the stadium. There is now Pitbull x FIU merchandise, and the rapper has assisted the university in fundraising. Carr also stated Pitbull will play a key role in FIU’s Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) collective.\n\n“You can call it a partnership, you can call it a relationship, you can call it a friendship — use whatever you want, just don’t call it a sponsorship. Don’t call it stadium naming rights. Partnership is what it is,” Carr said. “What you saw the very first time we met when we really started talking about this was where Armando’s heart was. I shared an idea with him... but he smiled and said, ‘That’s pretty good, but we’re gonna go bigger.’ It’s been amazing how many ideas and how often FIU is on Armando’s mind... We all know what he does as a musician, but I’m more impressed what he can do as an entrepreneur.”\n\nFIU and Pitbull signed a 5-year, $6 million agreement which includes several stipulations. One involves Pitbull receiving the title of “Official Entrepreneur of FIU Athletics.” Also, Mr. Worldwide is granted use of the stadium for up to 10 days annually, Pitbull’s vodka brand Voli 305 will be distributed in the venue, and two suites will be reserved for the man whose name is embroidered on the stadium.\n\n“This is groundbreaking,” Pitbull said. “We’re making history. This is history in the making. You’re gonna see that every university is going to want to do the same thing. But the difference is we don’t do this for propaganda. We do this from the heart. We do it because it’s meaningful. We do it because I’m from the crib. I’m 305. I’m from the bottom. This is my backyard.”\n\nThe 20,000-seat Pitbull Stadium will now serve as the host to all of FIU’s home football games, but it might also serve as a concert venue for Mr. Worldwide in the future.\n\n“Picture this, Pitbull in concert at Pitbull Stadium,” Carr said. “We’re gonna be there to see history there when that happens.”\n\nOn the song “International Love,” Pitbull once said, “I don’t play football, but I’ve touched down everywhere.” Now, he’s showing Florida International love and making way for others to score touchdowns at Pitbull Stadium, which opens its doors Sept. 7 for the home opener vs. Central Michigan.\n\n“Hard work is what pays off,” Pitbull said. “I went from Mr. 305 — (rapper) Trick Daddy was the one who named me Mr. 305. He welcomed me to the crib. He welcomed me to Miami. But then traveling the world that’s when I became Mr. Worldwide. And now from Mr. Worldwide to creating a partnership with Florida International University. Not just any university, but Florida INTERNATIONAL. That just goes to show you what’s meant to be will be.”\n\nDalé."
