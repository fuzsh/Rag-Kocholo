        "text": "7th Street\n\nShaun Cassidy, Ginkgo\n\n2007\n\nEchoing the station platform trees, ginkgo leaves interrupt the fencing between the train tracks, appear on the windscreens and in mosaic on the canopy columns. The veins of the fence leaves are neighborhood street maps; the dot indicates the station location. Nine other stations feature different leaves in the art fencing. Cassidy also designed the light rail vehicle ceiling graphics and seating fabric, further referencing Charlotte’s tree canopy.\n\nWindscreens, Mosaic Columns, Platform Pavers\n\nLeticia Huerta\n\n2007\n\nHuerta designed platform paving patterns, mosaic tile column cladding, and etched windscreens for 11 stations from Carson Boulevard to I-485. Each station features a unique theme derived from local history, architecture, landscape, industry, and demography. Her Gold Nuggets for Carson Boulevard were inspired by 18th century gold mining. The Bland Street rose motif comes from Dilworth architecture. Arrowood features Indian feathers and snakes inspired by Catawba pottery. East/West, Tyvola, and Archdale stations recognize Charlotte’s textile history.\n\nBenches\n\nHoss Haley, River Rock Bench\n\n2007\n\nSmooth river stones inspired Haley’s sculptural benches. The hand-polished steel and concrete art introduces an organic form juxtaposed with the standard seating at 5 stations.\n\nSignal House & Traction Power Substation\n\nLeigh Brinkley\n\n2012/2017\n\nDesigned by artist Leigh Brinkley, the bright green pattern on the signal house and sculptural letters above the roof line are meant to enliven the exterior and Southend. The substation appearance is mitigated through a trompe l’œil effect mimicking the exterior of the Atherton Mill.\n\nHardscapes & Landscapes\n\nAlice Adams\n\n2007\n\nAdams was one of two lead artists involved early in the design phase of the LYNX Blue Line. She impacted the corridor’s landscape and hardscape thematically based on her response to Charlotte’s indigenous trees and plant life. Her contributions throughout the line include 47 cheekwall reliefs, a unique sidewalk paving stamp, two sculptural benches, concrete scoring patterns, and a few specialty landscapes.\n\nWalls & Bridges\n\nMarek Ranis\n\n2007\n\nLead artist Marek Ranis chose standard form liners and color to add interest, texture and depth to the corridor bridges and walls. A Carolina earth color and sky gray drawn from nature enhance most of the walls and bridges, but the artist deviates at one of six stations by using a tree bark texture and brown color beside a pale green and leafy texture to enhance the retaining wall.\n\nDrinking Fountains\n\nNancy Blum, Dogwood\n\n2007\n\nBlum designed two art basins to replace 24 standard drinking fountains basins along the south corridor. Each 18” diameter cast bronze basin features the dogwood blossom, North Carolina’s state flower. The spiral design mimics the Fibonacci pattern seen in nature.\n\nUNC Charlotte Main\n\nMikyoung Kim, The Nexus Project\n\n2018\n\nKim’s art is in the spirit of university learning and flux. Her 100’ of undulating, perforated stainless steel sculptural seating is surrounded by motion activated colored lighting, altering the landscaped plaza where people await the trains. Her art glass and metal columns on the platform expand her time concept within the station environment.\n\nJW Clay Blvd.\n\nJackie Chang, (T)HERE\n\n2018\n\nChang’s art was influenced by the station and boulevard’s namesake, James W. Clay, a geographer, traveler, and urban planner. Blending text and images in her art, she incorporates the words “HERE” and “THERE”. For the artist, HERE signifies one’s current location and THERE indicates the horizon. Chang creates this distinction by inlaying the word HERE into the platform and depicting in the glass windscreen THERE - which contains “HERE” - above the horizon lines of three recognizable North Carolina landscapes: the Piedmont, the Blue Ridge Mountains, and the Atlantic coastline.\n\nMcCullough\n\nShaun Cassidy, Ebb and Flow\n\n2018\n\nCassidy expands upon his leaf motif found in the southern corridor art with natural elements. Etched windscreens, canopy columns, two Leaf Shadow Benches and flowing stainless steel art fencing were designed by the artist. Cassidy also designed bus shelter windscreen glass.\n\nUniversity City Blvd.\n\nJackie Chang, (W)HERE\n\n2018\n\nChang blends text and foliage imagery in her station art by\n\nincorporating the words “HERE” and “WHERE”. HERE, embed in the clay-colored concrete underfoot, signifies one’s current location; and WHERE, found at eye-level in the art glass windscreens, is an abstract term, belonging both to the past and to the future. Chang said in an interview, “Charlotte is looking to the future, but it is also taking the past with it.”\n\nTom Hunter\n\nTom Stanley, A Place Called Home\n\n2018\n\nStanley’s art is a result of his interaction with Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School and Hidden Valley Elementary students and their concepts of ‘‘home.’’ The artist utilized the students’ drawings and words in his windscreen glass and canopy columns along with his own aesthetic interpretations. His art fencing and two art benches reference pyramidal house tops. More info can be found in the video here.\n\nOld Concord Road\n\nChandra Cox, Nature’s Sanctuary\n\n2018\n\nThe woodland bird habitat neighboring the station at Eastway Park influenced Cox’s station art, including a 250’ Birds & Cattail Fence set in a berm of ornamental grasses and flowers. Native critters become large in the etched windscreen glass and tiny in the canopy columns.\n\nSugar Creek\n\nChandra Cox, Locomotion\n\n2018\n\nInfluenced by freight train activity parallel to the light rail station, Cox references heavy rail through her kinetic finials atop the canopies and locomotive imagery in her windscreen glass. In the canopy metal column cladding she uses the historic spellings of Sugar Creek. Her 18’ high Orb Lantern sculpture is inspired by a train switch and sited between the station platform and parking garage.\n\n36th Street\n\nRuth Ava Lyons & Paul Sires, Welcome to Nodaland\n\n2018\n\nRed is the artists chosen signature color for the station’s metal work, including the canopy steel, light poles, and fencing to signify the eclectic NoDA neighborhood, which they were instrumental in contributing to. Their art recognizes the area’s growth with industrial and organic imagery in the canopy windscreen glass, metal column cladding, and smalti glass mosaics set in the wall approaching the platform. Sires’ carved granite bench is sited at street level.\n\n25th Street\n\nSharon Dowell, A City of Optimists\n\n2018\n\nDowell’s painting style is utilized in the canopy windscreen glass art and column cladding art. Ten mosaics and color added to standard benches and railing captures her color palette. Her art includes silhouettes of Charlotte residents, and she strives to incorporate the ‘‘City’s energy.’’ Beyond the station, underpasses at 11th St and I-277 along with a Signal House include Dowell’s color rich murals.\n\nParkwood\n\nMaria Artemis, Tectonic Suite\n\n2018\n\nArtemis’ art explores the geological events that shaped Charlotte. Her windscreen glass and canopy columns include maps of the Carolinas, and the platform is stamped with fossil shaped arcs and colored glass aggregate. The artist chose 30 boulders for the adjacent landscape illustrating the slate and granite belts adjacent to Charlotte and responsible for the region’s gold formation. She also replaced 4 standard benches with hand carved granite seating.\n\n9th Street\n\nAnna Valentina Murch & Douglas Hollis, UMBRA\n\n2018\n\nCharlotte’s historic textile industry and the environmental benefits of alternative transportation options drove the signature station design by artists Anna Valentina Murch (1949 - 2014) and Douglas Hollis. The use of a tensioned membrane for the ten shelters was forward thinking and a demonstration of technological advancements in the industry. Each component chosen by the artists is in response to environmental conditions, qualities of light, and movement – both of trains and people. The fanning canopies, curved benches and blue glass windscreens, platform of blue glass aggregate all flow together to create a collectively airy, uplifting experience for riders.\n\nCharlotte Transportation Center/Arena\n\nAndrew Leicester, Bobbins\n\n2007\n\nSix brick-clad bridge columns mimic the Arena bobbins and continue the artist’s focus on Carolina’s textile industry past. By switching colors, the Zig Zag Reversed Twill Weavepaving pattern connects the outdoor platform and interior Transportation Center.\n\n3rd Street\n\nJody Pinto, Light Station\n\n2007\n\nWith her team of an architect, engineer, lighting designer and fiberglass fabricator, Pinto transforms the station with color and light. The green and berry canopies illuminate the platform with sunlit hues by day and fluorescent lighting at night. A three-color zig-zag paving pattern enlivens the platform, taking on a stage-like quality.\n\nBland Street\n\nYuriko Yamaguchi, Dream Keepers\n\n2007\n\nYamaguchi’s four small bronze sculptures compose a narrative work of art using forms symbolizing the growth and mystery of our lives. Her reinterpretations of seemingly familiar objects create visual riddles, prompting viewers’ curiosity and imagination. Detailed surface textures invite closer inspection and touch.\n\nEast/West Boulevard\n\nThomas Thoune, Camden Wall\n\n2007\n\nPlates, vases, glass, and broken ceramics collected from the community by the artist are recycled into mosaic art. Using machine cog shapes for 33 separates vignettes, the 360’ wall captures life in the South End. The cogs weave Charlotte’s history and lore with present day images and neighborhood scenes. While Thoune was in residence at McColl Center for Visual Art, a community collection of materials for the artwork was initiated. The community responded enthusiastically, bringing their items and their stories about each donation. These personal items and mementos are now memorialized in the art wall.\n\nScaleybark\n\nThomas Sayre, Furrow\n\n2007\n\nAward-winning Furrow, six large concrete and steel sculptures cast from Carolina earth, pays tribute to Scaleybark’s agricultural past. The 18’ sculptures were inspired by harrow disks, the agricultural tool used behind a plow to cultivate farmland. The title refers to the cultivation trench, or “V,” left in farmland behind a plow. Each disk weighs 11-tons, yet appears fragile, belying its significant weight and density. The discs were cast and cured onsite over the course of 3 months using the artist’s signature “earthcasting” process and truckloads of dirt excavated from the light rail project.\n\nTyvola Station\n\nDennis Oppenheim, Reconstructed Dwelling\n\n2007\n\nInternationally renowned American artist Dennis Oppenheim (1938-2011) challenges passengers to contemplate the unconventional with Reconstructed Dwelling, his monumental sculpture for the plaza underneath the Tyvola platform. The art is composed of recognizable house elements and common building materials constructed in an uncommon way. The sculpture is positioned over a painted floor plan of a typical neighborhood home that becomes a stage for chance encounters.\n\nArchdale\n\nRichard C. Elliott, Tower of Light\n\n2007\n\nRecognized for his large-scale installations created by layering thousands of plastic industrial reflectors, Richard Elliott (1945-2008) transforms the Archdale elevator into a prismatic display of color, light, and motion. Inside, natural light passing through the multicolored patterns simulates the visual effect of stained-glass."
