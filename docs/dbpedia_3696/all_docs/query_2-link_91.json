        "text": "Adelaide’s Coopers Stadium has become the third venue of its kind to adopt facial recognition technology, as part of ongoing improvements to the venue.\n\nThe stadium is home to Adelaide United, who said that on the back of last year’s successful FIFA Women’s World Cup games at the venue – which saw $53 million invested in upgrading the stadium and more than 65,000 supporters through the gates during the five sold-out games – Coopers Stadium has now introduced facial recognition technology.\n\nAdelaide United Football Club is a professional soccer club based in Adelaide, South Australia, Australia. The club participates in the A-League Men under license from the Australian Professional Leagues.\n\nThe 16,500-capacity Coopers Stadium is a multipurpose stadium in Hindmarsh, an inner Western suburb of Adelaide, South Australia.\n\nThe new technology has brought Coopers Stadium in line with Melbourne’s AAMI Park and Sydney’s Allianz Stadium, both of which introduced facial recognition last year.\n\nThe 45,000-capacity Sydney Football Stadium, known commercially as the Allianz Stadium, is a stadium in Moore Park, Sydney, Australia.\n\nThe 30,050-capacity Melbourne Rectangular Stadium, known as AAMI Park for sponsorship reasons, is an outdoor sports stadium on the site of Edwin Flack Field in the Sports and Entertainment Precinct in the Melbourne City Centre (Australia).\n\nAdelaide United said the new technology will enhance the stadium’s security and ability to identify any persons of interest. It was first employed for the A-League Pride Cup match between Adelaide United and Melbourne Victory in March.\n\nAdelaide Venue Management (AVM), which manages and operates Coopers Stadium, has also updated venue conditions of entry and signage at the stadium.\n\nAVM Chief Executive Officer Martin Radcliffe says the changes bring Coopers Stadium in line with other interstate venues, helping create a safe and enjoyable experience for attendees, players and staff.\n\nHe said, “At Coopers Stadium, we are all about celebrating football and embracing the vibrant experience that fans love.\n\n“We constantly review and update our match day operations and delivery – we want all fans, no matter who they support, to have a positive, fun and safe day out.”\n\nAdelaide United Chief Executive Officer Nathan Kosmina added, “We welcome and are delighted that Coopers Stadium is implementing enhanced security measures this season.\n\n“We frequently engage with our members and fans regarding stadium security to understand how we can best continue to provide a safe and family-friendly environment for everyone attending our A-League matches.”\n\n“This increased security investment, coupled with the State Government’s $53 million upgrades ahead of last year’s hugely successful FIFA Women’s World Cup, underscores AVM and Adelaide United’s commitment to ensuring the safety of fans as a priority, while fostering an electrifying atmosphere at what is the best football stadium in Australia.”\n\nContinue to follow Coliseum for latest updates on venues business news.
