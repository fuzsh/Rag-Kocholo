        "text": "It seems the warnings worked: there were no backcountry rescues on eclipse day, said Sue Plant of Vermont Emergency Management.\n\nThat's not to say rescue teams weren't prepared, though.\n\n\"Our mountain rescue team kind of mobilized themselves into a couple of different corners of town in preparation for some kind of emergency and maybe then having trouble in traffic getting to it, but they did not end up having to respond to any emergencies,\" said Stowe EMS Chief Scott Brinkman.\n\nvermontpublic-poux-engagement-web-mixdown.mp3\n\nA few minutes after the eclipse ended and the light returned to the sky in St. Albans, Lojany Souza and Austin Stewart are crying and hugging in Taylor Park. And it’s not just because they were moved by the eclipse.\n\nSabine Poux: Did you guys just get engaged?\n\nLojany Souza: Yes!\n\nThe couple is from Winchendon, Massachusetts. Souza said they’re feeling ecstatic.\n\nLojany Souza: We just experienced the eclipse and then he proposed to me. We’ve been dating for seven years.\n\nAustin Stewart: Since middle school.\n\nLojany Souza: Since middle school. And he’s the love of my life. I love him with all my heart. I would die for him. I would cut off every limb for him. I would take my heart out for him and give it to him because he’s just my everything. I can’t believe he did — you did this.\n\nAustin Stewart: I love you.\n\nLojany Souza: I love you too.\n\nSouza had no idea the proposal was coming. Stewart says he proposed right as totality ended.\n\nAustin Stewart: Well, I bought the ring probably seven months ago, at this point. I didn’t know when to do it. ... But then their sibling asked to come see the eclipse and I just thought it was the perfect moment.\n\nLojany Souza: Everything aligned. Like literally everything aligned, today.\n\nFor the record, both said the eclipse itself was incredible.\n\nVisitors came to St. Albans in full force for the total solar eclipse Monday.\n\nKarin Berno, director of the Franklin County Regional Chamber of Commerce, said she had initially wondered if estimates about number of people were overblown. But with favorable weather conditions forecast in the days before the eclipse, Vermont and other parts of New England became hot destinations for eclipse chasers. And, St. Albans is located right along the center of the path of totality.\n\n\"There have been many, many, many meetings over the year in preparation for this. ... And we all, all the shops have tried to work together to make sure we have great souvenirs and a great presence, and just things for our visitors to do. We just want to make a good impression on outsiders,\" Berno said.\n\nThe chamber set up a table in St. Albans, and Berno said they talked to people from Venezuela, London and all over New England Monday.\n\nJessica Gaudette, owner of the store As the Crow Flies, said the city was about as busy as it is during the Vermont Maple Festival, and that a lot of guests were looking for local souvenirs.\n\nAmong the visitors hoping to get a look at the eclipse from St. Albans were Bill and Liz Jaeger from Bergenfield, New Jersey.\n\nIt was their first time in St. Albans, and they said they're impressed.\n\n“The people here in St. Albans are awesome. They’re really, really friendly,” Bill said.\n\nThe Jaegers said they would be watching the eclipse from Cohen Park.\n\nGreg and Kaye Bakos of Concord, New Hampshire, were also out and about in St. Albans.\n\nGreg, who is part of the New Hampshire Astronomical Society, said he hoped to capture photos of the eclipse. He said he automated his camera to take photos every few seconds. That way, he can enjoy the eclipse with his own eyes while taking photos.\n\nIn the 15 minutes leading up to totality, everyone in Burlington Battery’s Park was glued to the sky watching through eclipse glasses as the moon inched its way over the sun.\n\n“It’s significantly colder,” said Sean Wadden, of Worcester, Massachusetts. “Early I could feel the beating of the sun on me and now it’s chilly.”\n\nThe band in the park stopped playing and everyone went quiet.\n\nAs the sun’s final rays were snuffed out by the moon, a cheer went through the crowd.\n\nKaren Lundry and Bob Maclay came from New Jersey to watch the eclipse. As the sky went dark, Laundry exhaled in wonder.\n\n“I’m really happy to be here,” she said. “I’m in awe of nature, and the various things that happen in nature. ... it’s incredible.”\n\nMaclay nodded in agreement. “I’m impressed,” he said. “I was not that eager to do this, but she kept me going and now that I’m here, I think it’s great.”\n\nWhen totality hit at Ethan Allen Park, the sky over the lake and Adirondacks grew purple. The crowd hooted and cheered.\n\nAndy and Julia Palmer traveled from Seattle, Washington with their two kids for the eclipse. They took a redeye to make it here.\n\n\"It did not disappoint.... Worth the trip, really special,\" Julia Palmer said.\n\nClaire Tindula and Alex Marhefka came from Baltimore with their dog Blue.\n\n\"That was incredible! The silvery quality of the light,\" Tindula said. \"As expected, our dog was almost entirely unaffected, expect he used the opportunity of everyone being distracted to eat a cookie.\"\n\nThe Joshi family — Monica, Prashant and their son, Ved — traveled to St. Albans from Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nPrashant was going to go to Dallas to see the eclipse, but when they heard about the weather forecast there a few weeks ago, they booked a hotel in St. Albans. They came early this morning and set up chairs by the fountain in Taylor Park.\n\nPrashant is an amateur astronomer. And, he's pretty sure that an eclipse he saw when he was in eighth grade is the reason he can't see very well out of his right eye.\n\nToday, he's planning to view the eclipse through a Seestar telescope, which transmits an image of the sun to his iPad.\n\nA couple days ago, Loi Almeron and Joao Carreira decided they were going to go for it, and make the drive from Long Island to Vermont for the total solar eclipse.\n\n\"This is the first time that I felt FOMO about something. And I was looking at the forecast,\" Almeron said. \"On Long Island, it was like 89% coverage. And if I crossed to Connecticut, it was 91. And I was like, not enough, you know, like, people are saying you have to be there.\"\n\nThey drove up all Sunday afternoon, and arrived at Mills Riverside Park in Jericho, Vermont, around midnight. After sleeping in their car, they set up Carreira's camera today.\n\n\"Right now I'm trying to align it so that I keep following the sun properly,\" Carreira said.\n\nRight at 4 p.m., they plan to hit the road back home — along with everyone else.\n\nAs of 11 a.m., municipal garages and many parking lots in Burlington were full, city officials told reporters during a press briefing.\n\nAbout 200 spots were still available at 345 Pine Street, a lot that hosts the Burlington Farmers Market in the summer, and about 950 cars could still fit on Route 127, which the city shut down today to use as a parking lot.\n\n“I think everyone is a bit, a bit taken aback, but also really working hard to make this a great experience,” said Zach Williamson, festival and event director at Burlington City Arts.\n\nWilliamson and other public safety officials are urging eclipse viewers to stay beyond the end of totality to ease traffic congestion this evening.\n\nMayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak, who’s been on the job one week, told reporters that the city is buzzing.\n\n“So far I've experienced a lot of happiness and excitement,” Mulvaney-Stanak said. “There's just a great joy and vibrancy on Church Street this morning, and I've never seen that many people in a coffee line before — I was at Muddy Waters and oh my God, I had to leave because it was like 20 people deep.”\n\nMike Dunn, owner of T. Ruggs Tavern in Burlington’s Old North End was preparing for a busy day Monday morning.\n\nHe’s expecting people will come to watch the eclipse from the back patio.\n\n“It feels like a Phish festival,” he said.\n\nDunn said he welcomes the business. “I hope everyone has a good time, everyone stays safe,” he said.\n\nThey’ve already noticed more traffic at the bar this weekend than normal and were in the midst of setting up a hot dog stand out front at about 11 a.m.\n\nHe and his staff are hoping to get a peek of the eclipse themselves.\n\n\"I figure everyone will be outside watching it, so we're just gonna look up and see,\" Dunn said.\n\nMost Vermont ski areas pray for snow, but today, they were hoping for clear skies and Jay Peak President and General Manager Steve Wright said so far, so good.\n\n\"We prayed for snow earlier. And we got about 40 inches of snow leading into the weekend. And then we switched the prayers over to sunshine. And we we got that, too,\" Wright said late Monday morning.\n\nHe says they've haven't noted any traffic hassles yet and as of 11 a.m. still had some room in their parking lots. They're expecting between 5,000 and 7,000 people today.\n\nJay Peak on eclipse day\n\nAt Stowe Mountain Resort, General Manager Shannon Buhler said they couldn't have asked for a better day.\n\n\"It is completely blue skies. No clouds in the sky right now. And warm. It is beautiful outside. It's a huge relief,\" Buhler said.\n\nBuhler said people started arriving at 6 a.m. and that traffic was flowing \"incredibly well\" late Monday morning.\n\nBolton Valley ski Area President Lindsay DesLauriers says they weren't sure what to expect.\n\n\"To be honest, I know we were kind of scared of today,\" DesLauriers said. \"We over, over planned. We have so many people out managing parking. We were really nervous that there was going to be a level of demand that would be unmanageable for us.\"\n\nShe said they capped ticket sales and didn’t over-promote, which she thinks was prudent.\n\nMid-day Monday, she said they had about 2,500 people at the resort, which is less than their busiest day headcount of 3,500.\n\nDesLauriers said it was a good number — not too many visitors at a time when the resort is low on staff.\n\n\"It's a festival atmosphere, but it's manageable for us. And that was really what we were hoping for,\" she said.\n\nThe weather appears to be holding steady for eclipse viewers here in Vermont.\n\nConor Lahiff of the National Weather Service in Burlington said they are closely watching a band of low, thick clouds that are moving across New York toward Vermont — and could block out the eclipse.\n\nLahiff said it looks like they'll hit the Adirondacks region around 3 p.m., but Vermont should be spared.\n\n\"It's a pretty close call for Vermont as far as those those lower clouds obscuring things,\" Lahiff said in an interview late Monday morning, \"but we're optimistic that those are going to stay west of us long enough that we're going to get a good view.\"\n\nFolks in the Champlain Valley should expect to see high clouds this afternoon — but those won't impede eclipse views.\n\nThe Northeast Kingdom will have the best conditions in the state.\n\nFind full details here.\n\nAlburgh is a place where people come for a slower slice of life. It’s a town of about 2,000 residents at the top of the Champlain Islands, close to the New York and Canada borders.\n\nBut as it happens, Alburgh is right in the path of totality for the eclipse — which makes it a prime destination for the potentially massive crowds that will be traveling from all over the region, and the country, to get a three-and-a-half minute glimpse at the moon completely covering the sun. It’s a golden opportunity for business, at least for those brave enough to seize it.\n\nIn October, a group of residents began planning a three-day festival, which started Saturday morning and wraps up Monday evening, after the eclipse and a fireworks show.\n\nJohn Clarke owns property on the main street in town, right next to the American Legion. In the summer, he turns it into three campsites that he puts up on Airbnb. He said they’re rarely all booked at once.\n\nBut they booked out early for the eclipse weekend. He added another handful of spots that are fully booked, too. He’s hosting guests as far away as Oregon and California.\n\nHe said the town could use an economic boost.\n\n“It is a once in a lifetime thing,” he said. “Sometimes you just need a push to get you rolling. And once you get rolling, who knows? Maybe other things happen. The town starts to evolve a little bit, people start to come here and check it out and that sort of thing.\"\n\nRead the full story of Alburgh's preparations here.\n\nOn Sunday, Burlington's Church Street and the waterfront were bustling as visitors began streaming into the Queen City.\n\nNew Jersey resident Ken Koch came to Burlington to view what will be his second total solar eclipse. He watched the 2017 eclipse in South Carolina and was hooked.\n\n“I never expected that to be such a profound experience … And once you do it's addicting,” Koch said. “When it goes totally dark, there's just something emotional. There's just this dark hole surrounded by the corona — which is brilliant.”\n\nThe crowds for the eclipse are expected to be significantly higher than Burlington’s July 3 celebrations, which draw about 23,000, said Zach Williamson, festival and event director at Burlington City Arts.\n\nAnd with forecasters calling for good weather, there could be an even bigger influx of visitors as people make last minute decisions to come to view the eclipse, Williamson said.\n\n“I want to make sure everyone who wants to see totality has an opportunity … But be ready for congestion and possibly some trouble getting here at that point,” Williamson said on Sunday.\n\nIf crowds exceed 50,000 in the Queen City, police officials say they’re not confident that they’ll be able to maintain traffic flow in the city. If the crowds exceed 75,000 there will likely be total gridlock and Interstate 89, Route 7, and Route 2 could be shut down, police said.\n\nLandlines are a hot commodity as Vermonters anticipate greater-than-usual cell service issues tied to eclipse crowds.\n\nEric Forand, director of Vermont Emergency Management, told Vermont Edition he's confident that the state's cell towers can handle the increased traffic. In particular, emergency 911 calls will receive top priority.\n\nStill, there are parts of Vermont where cell service is virtually nonexistent, even on a good day, and visitors might not know where those gaps are.\n\nPlainfield's emergency management team alerted residents to a landline phone at town hall, which they said lost and distressed visitors could use.\n\nAbout 55% of Vermonters have a landline phone at home, according to a survey published in the state's most recent telecommunications plan.\n\nThe latest forecasts Saturday from the Eye on the Sky weather team and the National Weather Service still show favorable conditions for eclipse viewing on Monday afternoon.\n\nFrom Saturday's Eye on the Sky weather forecast: \"Partial sun should develop Sunday, clear skies Sunday night, and - keep your fingers crossed - mostly sunny skies on Monday for the much-anticipated solar eclipse. A gradual warming trend should see temperatures range through the 50s to near 60 on Monday afternoon, though they could drop as much as 5 to 10 degrees during the eclipse.\"\n\nThe latest update from the National Weather Service on Saturday afternoon continues to show northern New England as having the \"best chances for clear viewing.\" The forecast is still subject to change, though. The NWS map reads, \"Totality or bust, check the forecast and adjust!\"\n\nTraffic concerns have led Vermont to shut down some courthouses for the day.\n\nCourthouses in Chittenden, Franklin, Grand Isle, Lamoille, Orleans, Caledonia, Essex and Washington counties are physically closed Monday, according to the Vermont Judiciary. (Anyone who needs to apply for a relief from abuse order may do so by calling 1-800-540-9990.)\n\nAll courthouses statewide will be closed from 3:15-3:45 p.m.\n\nThere's no school Monday in Chittenden, Grand Isle and Franklin counties, as well as at many other schools in the path of totality.\n\nTown offices in some communities are closed for the day or closing early, and some banks and doctor's offices are closing or have limited hours. Scheduled trash and recycling pickup may be moved to another day.\n\nViewing the eclipse in Burlington? Both of the City Market grocery store locations will be closed Monday.\n\nApril isn't typically the sunniest month in Vermont. But it looks like folks hoping for a clear view of the total solar eclipse on Monday will get their wish.\n\n\"We're looking at about as good of a day as you can expect for early April,\" said Matthew Clay with the National Weather Service in Burlington on Thursday. \"Looking at mostly sunny and dry conditions across the region, especially in the path of totality, so looking like it's going to be a really nice day with high temperatures in the 50s with light, northwest winds.\"\n\nClay said there will be a few stray cumulus clouds as well, but nothing that would impede a clear view of the eclipse Monday, which will occur around 3:30 p.m.\n\nVermont's favorable prospects make it an outlier in the national forecast. Along the path of totality, which stretches from Texas to Maine, the \"best chances for clear viewing\" are in northern New England and parts of Missouri and Indiana, the NOAA National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center said in a Facebook post Friday.\n\nEven though it may be sunny in Vermont, it's not a good day for a hike. Many of the trails are closed for mud season anyway, and the recent snowstorm means winter conditions persist around mountain summits. Emergency responders are worried that eclipse traffic will make it harder than usual to rescue anyone who needs help."
