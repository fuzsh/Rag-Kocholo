        "text": "Best Seats For a Concert at Kaseya Center\n\nThe most common seating layout at Kaseya Center for concerts is an end-stage setup with the stage located near sections Section 101, Section 102 and Section 103. For many concerts there are also slight variations to the layout, which may include General Admission seats, fan pits and B-stages.\n\nOn the Floor: Sections Floor 1, Floor 2, Floor 3 and Floor 4 are Floor Seats, which offer some of the closest views of the performers. For many concerts, floor sections are added or removed. These performer-specific adjustments may alter the floor layout and the views from each floor section.\n\nTo the Side of the Stage: For close views of the stage with a little bit of elevation, consider seats to the side of the stage in Section 105, Section 106 and Section 119. The view is not head-on like on the floor, but many of the seats are closer to the stage, provide better elevation and are actual stadium seats.\n\nHead-on to the Stage: Seats directly across from the stage, like those in Section 112, Section 113, Section 315 and Section 316 provide the most comfortable looks of the performance.\n\nEven upper level sections offer unobstructed sitelines. Just keep in mind that you won't be able to see as much detail from these seats as you would if you sat closer to the stage.\n\nConsider the Following When Buying Concert Tickets\n\nSeats behind the stage are occassionally sold: Unless your main objective is to just get in the building, you'll want to completely avoid anything behind the stage - like those in/near or above sections Section 101, Section 102, Section 103 and Section 104. It's unlikely the performer will turn around to salute you - and you're more likely to be completely blocked out from seeing the show.\n\nIf you're on the shorter side (or bringing kids), consider floor seats only in the first few rows: The most common complaint amongst floor ticketholders is that they can't see the stage because of taller people in front of them. As an alternative, consider side sections near the stage that will still have you close and high enough to see.\n\nLower level side sections are not created equal: While the side sections closest to the stage are top-notch, side sections farther from the stage may leave you with a cramp in your neck. Sections 108 and 117 are not well-angled towards the stage - leaving you to turn your head for an ideal view. Instead, consider head-on sections in the lower level or even close side seats in the upper level like 308 and 325."
