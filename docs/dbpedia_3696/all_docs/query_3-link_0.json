Martin Centre has been the home of men's and women's basketball, volleyball, and the locker rooms for all sports. In addition to the main court, Martin Centre includes athletic administration offices, athletic equipment room, Physical Education classrooms and the Rudolf Fitness Center.\n\nVolleyball took over on the main court in 2004, seating 2,500 for home matches. The Martin Court received new Daktronics scoreboard and videoboard in the fall of 2017, elevating the fan and student-athlete experience during Gonzaga Volleyball matches. The videoboard, which is 12-feet by 9-feet, replaced an existing screen with expanded capabilities for delivering high-quality content.\n\nIn the fall of 2017, the Volleyball locker room was remodeled thanks to the generosity of volleyball alumni. The expansion of the volleyball locker room includes a team lounge with entertainment system, a kitchen, and a study/meeting room. The space allows volleyball student-athletes to practice, study and relax all within the Martin Centre.\n\nJosh Burrows Performance Athletic Center\n\nThe Josh Burrows Performance Athletic Center supports every Gonzaga Student-Athlete’s strength and conditioning needs. Student-athletes work with the GU strength coaches for all weight training in this private athletic training room. The attached court allows for agility and conditioning work for each team.\n\nDiedrick-Delong Athletic Training Room\n\nThe Diedrick-Delong Athletic Training room opened in September of 2008 named after two of Gonzaga’s most influential trainers. The athletic training room is nearly 5,000 square feet and includes two whirlpools, and a host of therapeutic equipment. The first whirlpool is the Polar Plunge, which is a 9.5-by-7.5 cold water pool. The second pool is a 14-foot-long hydrotherapy pool with a built-in treadmill on the bottom. This pool has variable depths and is hooked up to a computer so trainers can chart the progress of injured student-athletes.\n\nMartin Centre Donors\n\nJosh Burrows, who is affectionately known as \"JB\" by student-athletes, had a dream that started with the men's basketball team, but now branches out across all of Gonzaga's sports. More than a decade ago, Burrows (a Spokane native and 1979 Gonzaga business graduate) saw a need at GU. The men's basketball team had just returned from a stellar run to the Elite Eight and Burrows knew that if they ever wanted to make it back onto that pedestal of greatness they would have to continue to build, not by working on their strengths, but by pinpointing their weaknesses and facing those head on.\n\nBesides being a staple in the progress of the strength and conditioning program, Burrows served as the inspiration and namesake when it came time to build a facility where these beneficial practices could take place. Construction began on the Josh Burrows Performance Athletic Center in 2006.\n\nIn 1986, Charlotte Y. Martin donated $4.5 million to finance remodeling of the arena. Originally, the arena had a sewing room built where the P.E. classroom and office now sits.\n\nAccessible Seats and ADA Parking\n\n- ADA Parking is available in the parking lot on the South side of the Charlotte Y.
