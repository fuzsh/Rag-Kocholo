Home to UNCW’s 19 teams, the 4,000-square-foot facility features many tools and modalities to enhance each student-athlete’s performance in their respective sport. The space includes 10 racks which include jammer arms, triphasic bars, and multiple forms of accommodating resistance. It also houses custom dumbbells and bumper plates branded with “Seahawk Strength,” four GHD/Hyper combos, a belt squat, a bilateral/unilateral leg press, functional trainer cable machines, lat pull/low row combos, two Peloton bikes, two AssaultRunner Pro treadmills, and various other pieces of equipment to enhance the student-athlete’s training experience.\n\nIn addition, the Seahawk Sports Performance staff utilizes TeamBuildr – an online “strength and conditioning” software displayed at each station via an iPad, creating paperless programming and data tracking for each individual student-athlete.
