        "text": "Time to Celebrate!\n\nGraduation Day is the time to celebrate everyone's hard work and support. Our teachers, principals, and the community want to help all of our students achieve this milestone.\n\nMost spring graduation ceremonies will occur in June, at the Raleigh Convention Center in downtown Raleigh or at Martin Marietta Center for the Performing Arts (formerly Duke Energy) in Meymandi Hall. Some small high schools will hold ceremonies at various locations in late May and early June.\n\nWe will observe any health guidelines in place at the time of graduation.\n\nCheck the Graduation Schedule to find out when and where your friend or loved one will be turning their tassel, as well as to access the livestream links for each ceremony.\n\nConcurrent Downtown Events/Traffic Alerts\n\nWe will alert you to any additional downtown events and other traffic-related concerns that might affect planning your trip to the venue.\n\nYou may find it beneficial to check the Red Hat Amphitheater event schedule in advance to see if one of their events coincides with your graduation time, as they may cause extra traffic congestion.\n\nPlease allow AMPLE time to anticipate traffic congestion, parking issues, walking to the venue, and finding your seat. We ask that you be seated 15 minutes prior to the scheduled ceremony.\n\nGeneral Tips and Information for Families\n\nPlan ahead. Students must be in place at least one hour before the ceremony starts. Allow significant time for traffic and parking.\n\nCarpool. Share a ride from home or school and save on gas and parking.\n\nIf your ceremony is at the Convention Center or the Martin Marietta Center for the Performing Arts, consult the City of Raleigh parking map .\n\nPractice patience and watch for pedestrians. Thousands of students and patrons of other events will be on sidewalks and crosswalks. Pedestrians should observe crossing signals to stay safe.\n\nCurbside Assistance at the Convention Center"
