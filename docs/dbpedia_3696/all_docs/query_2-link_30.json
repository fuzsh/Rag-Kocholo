It is home to the Gonzaga University Bulldogs basketball program, and is often called \"The New Kennel\". This nickname was inherited from the school's former basketball arena, Charlotte Y. Martin Centre, popularly known as \"The Kennel,\" which had been home to the Bulldogs for 39 years. As the MAC has become the established basketball arena on campus its nickname as \"The New Kennel\" is gradually becoming \"The Kennel\" with the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre being known as the \"Martin Centre.\" For several years it was the largest basketball arena in the West Coast Conference."
