        "text": "Cocktails\n\nBlackberry Buttons\n\nThis original cocktail has fresh blackberries and lemon that play perfectly with tequila and a hint of chocolate/vanilla. All of these elements are united with a splash of amaro and the stunning effects of a Szechuan 'buzz' button.\n\n$16\n\nBoulevardier\n\nRittenhouse Rye, Campari, Carpano Antica, House Spiced Cherry.\n\n$14\n\nCucumber Basil Collins\n\nFresh cucumber and basil add a delicate herbal appeal to an already bright drink, with the perfect Gin joining Chartreuse and Amaro to set the bar.\n\n$15\n\nFireside Chat\n\nRittenhouse Rye and Becherovka (a house-favorite spiced Czech Amaro) are at the forefront of this spirit-based cocktail, with a touch of darker Amari and Mole Bitters adding depth to the finish. Brought to you while being infused with smoke from Sugar Maple chips, it's symmetry and complexity will have you longing for a firepit and great conversation.\n\n$15\n\nFig Manhattan\n\nThis Manhattan variation uses our house-infused fig Bourbon and Amaro to give the classic more depth of character, without adding additional sweetness.\n\n$15\n\nFrench 75\n\nUncle Val's Botanical Gin shaken with fresh lemon and a touch of sugar make for a brilliant drink on it's own. Top it off with a beautiful dry Champagne and you have the perfect way end a great day. Or, start an even better one.\n\n$14\n\nHemmingway\n\nUnlike his books, this Daiquiri is bright, clean and complex. Clarified juices and herbal notes make this a fantastic modern rendition.\n\n$13\n\nIllegal Contraband\n\nThis bright cocktail employs the subtle smokiness of Ilegal Mezcal and smoothness of Havana Club Rum to round out fresh ginger and lime. A Fernet Branca float adds the balance and complexity we should look for in every cocktail.\n\n$14\n\nLake Love\n\nFreshly pressed red grapes, lemon and basil center this crisp, clean and contoured fusion of McQueen Brazilian Gin, Italian Limoncello and French St. Germaine liqueur. It may well be the perfect patio sipper but performs equally well as a celebratory toast, entre pairing or evening nightcap.\n\n$15\n\nLink & Pin Bloody Mary\n\nHoney and a special house blend of spices make this one of the best Bloody Marys in town and just the kick you need on a weekend morning.\n\n$10\n\nLink & Pin Cosmo\n\nThe Cosmopolitan will always hold a special spot in our cocktail culture, but we have come a long way. Grab one of ours and see just how far.\n\n$14\n\nLink & Pin Margarita\n\nSlight citrus sour gives way to sweet, salty and floral in this adaptation of one of the all time favorites.\n\n$13\n\nManhattan\n\nThe classic bourbon cocktail crafted with Maker's 46.\n\n$15\n\nMezcal Negroni\n\nOur Mezcal/Tequila blend adds a truly unique structure to this classic stirred cocktail. But, it is the finish of dark round bitterness in the Punt E Mes that defines its worth.\n\n$15\n\nMimosa\n\nThe classic Mimosa made with Natalie's Orange Juice. The simple yet delightful brunch cocktail.\n\n$8\n\nMoscow Mule\n\nDeep Eddy Vodka, Fresh Ginger, Q Ginger Beer, Fresh Lemon, Fresh Lime.\n\n$12\n\nNegroni\n\nChemist Barrel Rested Gin features a stronger orange note followed by barrel finished flavors of vanilla and oak that adds unique depth and balance to the classic negroni.\n\n$14\n\nOld Fashioned\n\nRussell's Reserve Rye, Angostura, Demerara, Fresh Orange.\n\n$14\n\nPBJOF\n\n\"Peanut Butter & Jelly Old Fashioned\" This Old Fashioned starts off with beautifully round flavors of peanut, Bourbon and spice. As the blackberry ice melts, it turns to an adult rendition of everyones favorite childhood snack.\n\n$13\n\nPear and Cilantro Margarita\n\nCaramelized pear juice works perfectly with Reposado Tequila and Grand Marnier. While the herbal cilantro tones are a great balance to the sea salt and orange zest foam.\n\n$13\n\nThe Right Note\n\nThe Last Word has long been an in-house favorite. This portrayal employs fresh lemon, Uncle Vals Gin and Yellow Chartreuse to soften the sharper elements while maintaining the brilliant complexity of the original. Aperol and St. Germaine provide the delicate botanicals to both compliment and heighten this exceptionally well-rounded and welcoming libation.\n\n$17\n\nRed Sangria\n\nOur house-infused fig Bourbon and vanilla bean syrup give a supple depth to this Sangria, brightened up flawlessly with fresh ginger and juices.\n\n$13\n\nSazerac\n\nClassic Rye & Cognac Cocktail served in an absinthe rinsed glass.\n\n$14\n\nSee You Next Fall\n\nWhat started as a Penicillin spin-off became so much greater. With flavors of Rum, maple and ginger highlighted with smoky aromatic tones.\n\n$12\n\nSouthend\n\nRye Whiskey and Amaro stirred with bitters. Rarely has there been a better coupling.\n\n$15\n\nSpanish G&T (Gin & Tonic)\n\nThere are some times where simplicity is the best option. We have found the perfect Classic Tonic and paired it with a superbly soft and well-rounded South American Gin. Fresh cucumber, star anise, lime, orange and rosemary are introduced to accent and compliment the botanicals in both while keeping this cocktail beautifully light and clean.\n\n$15\n\nSpiced Cherry Mule\n\nCarolinas own Social House Vodka is the clean base for this signature mule utilizing our house-spiced cherries and fresh ginger. All while the ever complex Green Chartreuse is used to enhance elements of cardamom, cinnamon, allspice and lime.\n\n$15\n\nEspresso Martini\n\nSocial House Vodka, Cruzan Single Barrel, Amaro Averna, Amaro Nonino, Frangelico, Kahlua, Vanilla Bean, Chocolate Bitters, Nitro Cold Brew Coffee\n\n$14\n\nThree-Way White Sangria\n\nThree different wines (Rose, Blanc Vermouth & Prosecco) add an intricacy that can only be balanced by three liquors (Cognac, Calvados & Benedictine) and three fresh juices (lemon, lime & orange).\n\n$13\n\nVesper\n\nUncle Val's Gin, Social House Vodka, Cocchi Americano, Boston Bittahs, Fresh Lemon.\n\n$15\n\nVieux Carre\n\nBulleit Bourbon, Remy Martin VSOP, Benedictine, Carpano Antica, Peychaud's, Angostura, Fresh Lemon.\n\n$15\n\nWhiskey Sour*\n\nFresh lemon, sugar and a generous pour of Elijah Craig Small Batch Bourbon are the main components to one of the best drinks ever perfected. We finish ours with a dash of Angostura Bitters, freshly cut orange twist and a house-spiced cherry. *This item is served using raw eggs.
