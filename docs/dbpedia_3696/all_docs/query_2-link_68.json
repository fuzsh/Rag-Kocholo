        "text": "Charlotte Vandiver, 69, of Hiram, GA passed away on Friday, April 2, 2021. She was born on August 11, 1951 in Douglasville, GA.\n\nMrs. Vandiver was a secretary at Lockheed for more than 30 years. In her retirement, she enjoyed reading, doing puzzles, and playing card games. She especially loved spending time with her grandson, and she loved the mountains.\n\nShe is survived by her husband of 50 years, George Vandiver; one daughter, Stephanie (David) Hannah of Douglasville; one grandson, Jake Hannah; her parents, R.M. \"Possum\" and Grace Austin of Paulding; brothers, Randy (Pat) Austin, Wayne (Leslie) Austin, and Ray (Angela) Austin; sisters, Cheryl (Billy) Hembree and Janice Southerland; brothers- and sisters-in-law, Joseph (Lynn) Vandiver, Jeff (Kim) Vandiver, Henry (Pat) Vandiver; many cousins, nieces, nephews, extended family and friends.\n\nFuneral services will be held on Tuesday, April 6 at 2:00 p.m. at Clark Funeral Home Chapel with Rev. James Hannah and Rev. Glenn Petero officiating. Interment will follow in Dallas Memory Gardens. The family will receive friends at the funeral home on Monday, April 5, 2021, from 5:00 p.m. until 8:00 p.m.\n\nThe service will be streamed live on the Clark Funeral Home Facebook page at the time of the service. Please be aware there is sometimes a few minutes technical delay before it posts, but it will remain on the Facebook page for an indefinite period of time.\n\nThe family would like to extend their love and appreciation to everyone who may be unable to attend the service in person due to Covid-19 concerns or State restrictions (no more than 50 people inside at one time). If attending the visitation or service, the staff of Clark Funeral Home highly recommends that face masks be worn and that social distancing be practiced to help prevent the spreading of any possible illnesses and to help keep visitors, friends and family members of Mrs. Vandiver safe.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the American Cancer Association by calling 800.227.2345 or by visiting https://donate3.cancer.org.\n\nClark Funeral Home in Hiram, GA, is honored to care for the family during this difficult time.\n\nCondolences may be left for the family on our website, www.samclarkfuneralhome.com."
