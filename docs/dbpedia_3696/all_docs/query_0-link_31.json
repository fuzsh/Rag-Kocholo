        "text": "American: Bourbon - KY\n\nBourbon whiskey lays claim to being our native spirit. Few whiskies in the world are as well known or as sought after as bourbon. By law, to be called bourbon, the spirit must start with a mashbill of at least 51% corn, age in new charred-oak barrels, and enter the bottle at no less than 80 proof.\n\nAmerican: Rye\n\nWe tend to think of bourbon as the all-american whiskey — but, in fact, bourbon didn’t earn the moniker “bourbon whiskey” until 1840. Before prohibition, rye was far more popular than bourbon. similar to barley, a grain that scottish and irish immigrants knew well, rye was easily grown and made into whiskey; today, rye is the fastest-growing form of American whiskey. defined as being a minimum of two years old and containing a mashbill of 51% or more rye, this whiskey is the spicy, rich, and occasionally fruity member of the American whiskey family tree.\n\nAmerican: Single Malt\n\nOverseas, the term “single malt” is strictly defined: single malts must be made from 100% malted barley that is, malted, milled, fermented, distilled, aged, and bottled on the same property. here in the U.S., it isn’t quite so. In a market saturated with bourbon—and bourbon legal restrictions—some American spirit makers declared themselves independent of European rules. They rely on whiskey’s oldest recipe: barley, water, and yeast. That’s it. Look for the flavor spectrum of these whiskies to continue to grow. All whiskies listed here have bold, long-lasting flavors; each influenced by the climate and terroir of the various parts of the country from which they originate.\n\nAmerican: Corn Whiskey\n\nWhiskey younger than two years old, with a grain composition of at least 81% corn, is legally “corn whiskey.” Once European settlers learned to grow corn from the Native Americans, they began using it to make whiskey and it became the first American contribution to whiskey production. They soon learned that corn made more whiskey per bushel, the whiskey was sweeter, aged faster, and (if we’re being honest) tasted better than whiskey made with barley or rye. Look for candied sweetness and soft mellow flavors that explode on your palate, then vanish as quickly as they came. Corn dominant whiskies will have a more fleeting flavor presence than those of rye- and barley-dominated whiskies.\n\nAmerican: White Whiskey\n\nBaby whiskey. White dog. Moonshine. Young whiskey. White whiskey. Whatever you call it, it’s important to know that all whiskey starts off as a clear distillate. these unaged whiskies - of various grain composition - provide a unique look into the flavors of whiskey many of us forget are hiding deep within the more aged, darker spirits. Pure, crisp, and bright, many of these whiskies boast flavors of tequila, gin, mezcal, and even some rums. The ‘shine’ listed here also appear elsewhere in this menu for technical reasons but we feature them here to highlight the wide variety being produced today.\n\nAmerican: Carolina Whiskey\n\nWhen asked to describe things that are native to the Carolinas, many of us overlook whiskey. We forget that Kentucky and Tennessee were counties of Virginia and North Carolina when they first started producing whiskey. Now a new wave of Carolina distilleries are creating world-class whiskies that draw on our history and apply modern twists to a native spirit. These whiskeys are listed in this menu under their correct whiskey taxon, but we’ve gathered them here to highlight the new flavors of North and South Carolina spirits.\n\nSome say immigrant Scots brought whisky to Canada, while others say that Empire loyalists brought their methods after the U.S. revolution. Regardless of how whisky made it to Canada, these whiskies are light and easy to imbibe. Canadian whiskies are often blended rye, but stylistically are much different from the traditional straight rye of the United States.\n\nFrom its multiple appearances atop the world of whiskey revenue, to several moments of near extinction, Irish whiskey has stood the test of time. Early whiskey distillers in Ireland developed many of the innovations and common practices adopted by all modern distilleries, dispite multiple prohibition-like eras enforced by the British empire. Although Ireland’s whiskey is often eclipsed by its more brawling Scotch and American cousins it shares in the claim of inventing whiskey with the Scots and has contributed just as substantially to the perfection of the craft. As expected, Irish whiskey is among the fastest-growing segments of whiskey in the world and is embraced by whiskey-novices and connoisseurs alike.\n\nJapan's first commercial whisky distillery, Yamazaki, began production in 1924. Since then, Japan has earned its place among the great whiskey producing cultures of the world. Broadly speaking, Japanese whisky is most similar to Scotch with a focus on single-malt and blended-malt styles but Japanese whiskey sets itself apart with creative and artistic interpretations within these categories, all while maintaining a diligent respect for tradition.\n\n-Subject to Limited Availability-\n\nScotland is a fairly small country, and yet the diversity in her whiskies is astonishing; there is a Scotch whisky for every possible occasion and palate, with food or without. Each of the hundreds of working distilleries in Scotland produce a distinctive spirit, and often more than one of the five types of scotch. Single Malt, Single Grain, Blended malt, Blended grain, and Blended scotch, are the five types of scotch whisky. 90% of all scotch consumed is in the Blended category (Johnny Walker, Chivas Regal, Smokey Grouse etc), but the most famous and sought after category is the Single Malt, which consists of whiskey, distilled in one season, from malted barley, grown on the same grounds where it's water is sourced, where it is then fermented, distilled, aged and bottled. The single malt taxon is split up into the well known regions which give scotch it's terrior: Highland, Speyside, Island, Islay, Lowland and Campletown.\n\nElsewhere\n\nfermented grain, distilled into a spirit and aged in wood casks, is not unique to the us and uk. whiskey and whisky are, in fact, made on every continent except antarctica, and many locations have whisky traditions that go back prior to bourbon and scotch trends. american and european colonialism spread the taste for the perfected recipes and the economics that made them desirable. some countries leaned into importing the american and european products while others leaned into perfecting their own recipes. nevertheless, most of asia, africa and europe have their own spirits. some follow in bourbon or scotch traditions, and some, altogether unique. one thing's for certain- whiskey, however you spell it, is no longer the province of a single country or limited to the histories of a few. it is merely an aged spirit made from distilled grain. sometimes aged in wood. somewhere on this planet we all call home."
