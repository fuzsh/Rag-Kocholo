Your nominations are therefore vital and help us share the heritage and legacy of our city.\n\nOur Trustees have agreed to the following blue plaques, and unveilings. Additional permissions are being sought for further blue plaque nominations.\n\nWaddingtons\n\nThe Duchess Public House\n\nNorthern Star the newspaper\n\nPlease keep checking back for news on future Blue Plaques.\n\nLeeds Civic Trust is privileged to be the city’s blue plaques coordinators – if you would like to find out more about how you can get involved, share any feedback on previous blue plaque recipients, or on ways the current scheme could be improved, please feel free to contact us.\n\nThe 2020 global response to racial injustice, the 2020 murder of George Floyd in the U.S. and subsequent international Black Lives Matter protests demonstrated the significance and symbolism of public statues, monuments, and plaques.\n\nIn response, our Trustees commissioned an independent review chaired by Public Relations and Cultural Heritage Consultant, Susan Pitter in 2020.\n\nSusan Pitter's report can be found here.\n\nIn August 2021 our Trustees accepted all the report’s recommendations - their statement can be found here.\n\nWe are fully supportive of and have accepted Susan Pitter’s recommendations and are implementing these."
