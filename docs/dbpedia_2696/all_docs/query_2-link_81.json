        "text": "A walking tour that takes you to 20 of the finest historic buildings in Warminster\n\nThe town centre retains nearly all its 18th and 19th century buildings in a streetscape that has not changed substantially since the 1880s, despite considerable growth over the intervening period of time.\n\nThe Blue Plaque trail may be completed in either direction, in full or in part. The full walk takes approximately two hours to complete at a gentle pace over firm and reasonably level ground.\n\nThe numbers on the map highlight the location of plaques, and brief details of the buildings are included here. Not all buildings are open to the public.\n\nAlthough the trail seeks to highlight some of the more important buildings and features, you can also enjoy the diverse architecture and many features that will be seen along the way."
