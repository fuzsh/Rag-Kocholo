        "text": "He was the fierce Irish nationalist, flamboyant orator and champion of civil rights who William Gladstone once called “the greatest popular leader the world has ever seen.”\n\nNow Daniel O’Connell, often referred to simply as The Liberator, has been awarded with an English Heritage blue plaque at the Mayfair home where he once lived.\n\nO’Connell, who was born in County Kerry in 1775, successfully campaigned for Catholic and civil rights throughout his colourful life – first as a lawyer then as an MP – including the right of Catholics to sit in the British parliament, achieved in 1829. His opposition to slavery was crucial to its abolition in 1833 and he was known as such a great orator in the House of Commons that Charles Dickens, who was then a parliamentary reporter, said that when O’Connell spoke he would have to put down his pencil because he would be on the verge of tears.\n\nThe English Heritage plaque has been placed on a terraced house on Mayfair’s Albemarle Street, where O’Connell lived for a brief but highly significant six months between February and August 1833. It was during this period that the act to abolish slavery, in which O’Connell played a prominent part, was given royal assent in August 1833.\n\nIn honour of his legacy both as a great Catholic emancipator and slavery abolitionist, the plaque’s inscription includes O’Connell’s popular soubriquet: The Liberator.\n\nThe blue plaque was first proposed five years ago by his great-great-grandson Rickard O’Connell, who said he wanted to mark the legacy of his ancestor and “highlight how forward thinking he was at that time, looking to achieve universal rights.”\n\nHistorian and biographer of Daniel O’Connell, Dr Patrick M Geoghegan said it was only right that O’Connell was honoured in London, the place where both as a radical campaigner and then as an elected MP in 1830, he never stopped fighting for the rights of the oppressed.\n\n“Daniel O’Connell was an incredible liberator and that’s why I’m so delighted that this plaque makes reference to him as a champion of civil rights” he said. “ When he came to London to live on this street he fought for the rights of the oppressed in this country and around the world, fighting for the rights of the slaves in the United States, fighting for the rights for women, fighting so women would be given equal rights. He came here to London effectively as a refugee fleeing the French revolution, and it was here he went to the House of Commons and watched Charles James Fox and William Pitt and he modelled himself on them. It was the training he received in London that made him the great orator history remembers him as.”\n\nHe added: “He was a champion of freedom because he felt like he had grown up as an oppressed slave and knew what it was like to be made to feel inferior. Therefore he was going to be the champion of liberty, wherever he went and whatever the cost. He was a great figure in this capital city.”\n\nProfessor Martin Daunton, deputy chair of the English heritage blue plaques panel, said: I have been a longer admirer of Daniel O’Connell as a champion of civil liberties, for Catholics, for the Irish, for Jews and for women. Everybody here owes something to Daniel O’Connell’s fight to make society more inclusive. If you are looking for a modern analogy for O’Connell we would be thinking of people like Martin Luther King, like Mahatma Ghandi or Nelson Mandela.”\n\nO’Connell is not the first Irish person to be commemorated by the English Heritage blue plaque scheme, which is believed to be the oldest of its kind in the world. Other Irish recipients include Ernest Shackleton, Bram Stoker, Oscar Wilde and WB Yeats."
