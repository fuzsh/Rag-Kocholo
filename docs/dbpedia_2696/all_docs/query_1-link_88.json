        "text": "Escaped African American slaves and freedom fighters Ellen and William Craft are the latest individuals to be honoured with a blue plaque in Hammersmith.\n\nThe plaque, unveiled on 30 September, marks 26 Cambridge Grove, a mid-Victorian house in Hammersmith where they settled and raised a family in the mid-19th century after fleeing slavery in the US.\n\nHistorian Dr Hannah-Rose Murray proposed the plaque to the Crafts.\n\nShe said: “Ellen and William Craft were courageous and heroic freedom fighters.\n\n“Their daring escape from U.S. chattel slavery involved Ellen crossing racial, gender and class lines to perform as a white southern man.\n\n“Their story inspired audiences on both sides of the Atlantic and when the Crafts reached Britain, they were relentless in their campaigns against slavery, racism, white supremacy, and the Confederate cause.\n\n“I’m so excited that English Heritage has built on previous work by historians, archivists and local activists to honour their presence in Hammersmith and the UK in general.”\n\nFounded in 1866, London’s blue plaque scheme, which has been run by English Heritage since 1986, celebrates historical figures on the site of the buildings in which they lived and worked.\n\nFrom poets and scientists to politicians and activists, there are 319 blue plaques across south west London, but only eight dedicated to black icons.\n\nDespite the blue plaque scheme’s long history, all but one of the eight plaques in south west London commemorating black figures have been erected since 2005.\n\nThe only plaque to honour a notable black figure before then was of composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, placed in Croydon in 1975.\n\nIn 2021, three plaques have so far been unveiled to minority ethnic figures across London.\n\nAnna Eavis, curatorial director for English Heritage, said: “We are committed to celebrating the contributions of groups that have traditionally been underrepresented in history.\n\n“Whilst, in percentage terms, the positive steps we’re taking to address this issue are not yet visible, we are proud that, for the past two years, a quarter of the blue plaques erected have commemorated figures from a minority ethnic background.”\n\nBlack History Month is celebrated every year in October to recognise the contribution and achievements of those with African or Caribbean heritage.\n\nSouth west London’s blue plaques offer a way to remember the impact of black individuals all year round.\n\nSouth west London’s black pioneers\n\nCroydon\n\nSamuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875-1912) A successful composer who was the first black recipient of a blue plaque. 30 Dagnall Park, South Norwood, London, SE25 5PH.\n\nHammersmith and Fulham\n\nEllen and William Craft (c.1824-c.1900) African American freedom fighters who escaped slavery in the US and settled in the UK where they campaigned for the abolition of slavery. 26 Cambridge Grove, London, W6 0LA.\n\nMarcus Garvey (1887-1940) Pan-African nationalist leader and activist. 53 Talgarth Road, Barons Court, London, W14 9DD.\n\nKensington and Chelsea\n\nBob Marley (1945-1981) One of the most influential music figures of the 20th century, credited with being at the forefront of the reggae musical style. 42 Oakley Street, Chelsea, SW3 5HA.\n\nCetshwayo (c.1832-1884) King of the Zulus during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879.
