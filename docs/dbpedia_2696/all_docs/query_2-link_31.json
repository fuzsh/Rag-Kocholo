        "text": "Charlie Lightfoot was a Black pioneer who broke into integrated professional hockey in 1906. He is quite possibly the first one to do so.\n\nHis family moved to Stratford in 1888, and lived at 94 Cobourg St.\n\nIn 1906, Lightfoot broke into integrated professional hockey. He played in the Manitoba Professional Hockey League with the Portage la Prairie Cities team. After playing in the East coast and around Ontario, he returned to Stratford and worked in the GTR shops where he also coached a hockey team. His family was well respected in Stratford.\n\nOne of his hockey sticks was donated by the Stratford Perth Museum to the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nOpen external page https://youtube.com/embed/l7yqpVZcQG0?wmode=transparent\n\nIn 1863 a young man of 16, after training for a time as a telegrapher in Port Huron Michigan, made his way into Canada to try to make a living as a telegraph operator.\n\nThe first place he came to was what was then known by the railway people as “Stratford Junction,” to work for the Grand Trunk Railway.\n\nThat young man was Thomas Alva Edison.\n\nWhile here, it is believed that he lived at 46 Ontario St., in the upper rooms.\n\nDr. Robert Bruce Salter was born in Stratford, Ontario on December 15, 1924 to a family originally from Nova Scotia. They lived at 56 Front Street from 1920 to 1930, then moved to 245 Water St.\n\nRobert and his two brothers attended Romeo School.\n\nDr. Salter graduated in medicine from the University of Toronto in 1947 and joined the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto in 1955, where he stayed for 55 years.\n\nDr. Salter developed a surgical technique that treats congenital dislocation of the hip, and that technique has been performed on millions of children worldwide.\n\nHe was a recipient of the Order of Canada and the Order of Ontario and inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Honourable Dr. James Palmer Rankin was a local man who made immeasurable contributions to Perth County. He reportedly had a big personality, and Dr. Rankin contributed to his community on the school board, and as a doctor.\n\nDuring the First World War, he was a lieutenant-colonel with the Canadian Army Medical Corps , serving in the Perth Regiment. He also represented Perth County as a Member of Parliament and Senator for the Dominion of Canada.\n\nThe Blue Plaque is at 190 Church St. where Dr. Rankin lived from 1920 until his passing in 1934.\n\nRichard Manuel was born in Stratford in 1943, and grew up at 138 Well St.\n\nRichard started playing piano at age 9, and at the age of 15 he helped form the local band, The Revols, with Ken Kalmusky (later of Great Speckled Bird) on bass, John Till (later with Janis Joplin's Full Tilt Boogie Band) on guitar, and Richard Manuel on piano and lead vocals. The line up later expanded to include Doug Rhodes and Garth Picot.\n\nThey opened for Ronnie Hawkins in 1960, and Richard was recruited to be the piano player in the Hawks. In 1964 the Hawks were recruited to be Bob Dylan’s backing band. They officially became The Band in 1967. The Band was highly influential in the 1960’s and 70’s for its resonant fusion of rock, rhythm and blues and county music.\n\nManuel was a beloved and respected songwriter and vocalist who influenced and collaborated with many prominent artists. He died in 1986 and is buried in Avondale Cemetery."
