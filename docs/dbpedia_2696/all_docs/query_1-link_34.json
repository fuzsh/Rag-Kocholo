        "text": "Helena Normanton lived at the house (now part of The Goodenough on Mecklenburgh Square hotel), between 1919-31.\n\nMecklenburgh Square has a long history of attracting distinguished academics, writers and thinkers and many other pioneering women such as Virginia Woolf, Eileen Power and Jane Ellen Harrison, lived and worked in houses in and around the Square. Goodenough College is surrounded by homes with English Heritage London blue plaques giving the College’s Members (and guests staying at the hotel) extra inspiration and a special appreciation of the area’s history.\n\nHelena Normanton is seen as instrumental in paving the way for women in law. After many early challenges and setbacks she became the first female law student at one of the London Inns of Court and one of the first to be called to the Bar. As a practising barrister, she was the first female counsel to lead in a case at the High Court, the first woman to accept a dock brief and run a trial at the Old Bailey, the first woman in the English courts to lead murder trials, and one of the first two women to take silk as a King’s Counsel (the recognition given to the most senior barristers).\n\nA lifelong advocate of equality feminism, Normanton was actively involved in numerous campaign groups, including the Women’s Freedom League, Six Point Group, the Married Persons Income Tax Group, the Married Women’s Association, the Council for Married Women and the British Federation of Business and Professional Women. She was also active in the long-standing campaign for reform of divorce laws, aiming to make divorce more equal, less difficult to achieve and less expensive."
