Befitting of the strong maritime roots that Hull has, the distinctive designs have a nautical appearance with their gold ropework rim and inner circle.

From trying to spot England’s smallest window through to the unmissable, imposing architecture of Hull Minster, you will take in all of Hull’s most famous sights finishing back at Trinity House in the heart of the Old Town.\r\n\r\nWhether you decide to spend time discovering more about the stops that interest you, take in a watering hole or two, or just find all the plaques as quickly as possible, there is no right or wrong way to complete the trail.",
