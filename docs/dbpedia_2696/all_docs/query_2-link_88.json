        "text": "In 2019, the Arts, Culture and Heritage Committee created the North Glengarry Blue Plaque Program. There are two types of plaques:\n\nIndividuals\n\nA blue plaque may commemorate an individual (such as Dorothy Dumbrille), or a group of people associated with one building. Please note that a maximum of three names may be placed on a plaque.\n\nWider Historical Association\n\nExceptionally, a plaque may commemorate the wider historical association of a building such as the Munro & McIntosh Carriage Co. building if it were still standing.\n\nIf you have any questions before you proceed please contact the Economic Development Officer by email or by telephone at 613-525-1313.\n\nOpen a new window to view the Blue Plaque Program application form"
