        "text": "The Lord Mayor of London yesterday unveiled a blue plaque at Furniture Makers’ Hall in the City of London to mark the site of the first ever headquarters of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI).\n\nThe charity, which is marking its 200th anniversary this year, was based at what is now Furniture Makers’ Hall, 12 Austin Friars, EC2, from 1824 until 1826. The building has been bestowed with a blue plaque granted by the City of London Corporation to mark its historical significance.\n\nThe plaque was unveiled by the Lord Mayor of London, Alderman Professor Michael Mainelli, at midday on 20 May – almost 200 years to the day since the site was established as the RNLI’s first headquarters.\n\nHayley Whiting, the RNLI’s Heritage Archive and Research Manager, said: “The RNLI was founded by Sir William Hillary in the City of London Tavern in Bishopsgate on 4 March 1824. Early meetings were held in various addresses in the City of London until 22 May 1824 when the charity established its first offices at 12 Austin Friars, which remained the home of the organisation until 1826. RNLI archive records document this and it is listed as the office address in the very first annual report published in 1825, and also in the first Committee of Management minute book.\n\n“Having a blue plaque installed at 12 Austin Friars is hugely significant for the RNLI and it is particularly fitting that it should happen this year, the RNLI’s 200th anniversary year.”\n\nAlthough the RNLI is well-known for its lifesaving work around the coasts of the UK and Ireland, it has strong connections with London. The charity was founded and based in the City of London until 1851. In 1894, the RNLI City of London Committee was founded at a meeting chaired by the Lord Mayor at Mansion House. Amongst other things during its 130-year history, the Committee has funded three RNLI all-weather lifeboats based at Selsey, Dover and Sennen Cove.\n\nIn 2002 the RNLI set up the first lifeboat service on the River Thames, following the inquiry into the Marchioness disaster. There are four RNLI lifeboat stations along the tidal reaches of the Thames – at Teddington, Chiswick, Tower (by Waterloo Bridge) and Gravesend. These stations are consistently among the busiest of the RNLI’s 238 lifeboat stations, with Tower being the busiest and Chiswick the second-busiest.\n\nFrank Moxon, Chair of the RNLI City of London Committee, raised funds to pay for the plaque’s application, design, manufacture and installation by walking 100 miles in four days.\n\nHe said: “The RNLI has a long history in the City of London, having been founded there in 1824 and based there for many years. We are lucky to have an active and supportive fundraising community in the City, which is served by the RNLI’s Tower Lifeboat Station, the RNLI’s busiest station and one of four within Greater London that provide vital 24/7 lifesaving cover on the River Thames.\n\n“The blue plaque recognises the significance of Furniture Makers’ Hall, 12 Austin Friars as the site of the RNLI’s first headquarters 200 years ago and will act as a beacon to raise and maintain awareness of the RNLI’s long history of saving lives at sea and on the River Thames. Its unveiling provides an important reminder of the RNLI’s City of London origins and continuing close connection with the City, and will promote awareness of its vital lifesaving work.”\n\nBrian Ahern, Master of The Furniture Makers’ Company, said: “Furniture Makers’ Hall, situated at 12 Austin Friars, has been the heart and home of The Furniture Makers’ Company since 2005, but the site has a long history predating the 171 years of the building’s existence. Today we celebrate the Royal National Lifeboat Institution’s history in the location and are delighted that a blue plaque, commemorating the site’s historical significance, will adorn the hall, associating it forever with the wonderful work of RNLI.”\n\nThe plaque’s unveiling was followed by a lunch for guests. Proceeds from the event will help to fund the vital lifesaving work of Tower Lifeboat Station. Guests in attendance included: The Rt Hon The Lord Mayor of London; The City Marshal; The Water Bailiff and Under Water Bailiff of the City of London; Lord Wei of Shoreditch; the Chair and Chief Executive of the RNLI; senior representatives from other maritime and search and rescue organisations, and long-term donors and supporters of the RNLI within the City of London."
