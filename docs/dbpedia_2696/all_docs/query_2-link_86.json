        "text": "The NSW Government is inviting everyone from individuals and families to schools and community organisations to submit a nomination. Whether it’s an unsung hero, group or landmark event, now is the time to put them forward for recognition in this popular Heritage NSW program. More than a dozen recipients will be chosen from these submissions.\n\nThe NSW Government is committed to protecting, preserving and modernising NSW heritage. This round of Blue Plaques will celebrate the diversity of our community, with nominations falling into themes including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, environment and sustainability, sport, social justice and advocacy, war-time stories, the elderly, disability, LGBTQIA+ and more.\n\nNominating for a Blue Plaque is easy and can be done online. To be eligible, they must:\n\nrelate to a person, people or event that has made a lasting impact on a community in New South Wales or New South Wales as a whole\n\nbe appropriate, sensitive and engaging to a wide audience\n\nrelate to a person or people who passed away more than 20 years ago, or an event which occurred more than 20 years ago and\n\nhave a location in New South Wales for the Blue Plaque that is publicly accessible and has a direct connection to the person, people, or event.\n\nHeritage NSW and independent historians will evaluate nominations based on the eligibility criteria.\n\nFor the first time, the NSW Government is announcing a People’s Choice Blue Plaque. Heritage NSW has shortlisted favourite nominations from past rounds and launched a public vote to decide the inaugural People’s Choice Blue Plaque.\n\nThe nominations people can vote for are:\n\n• Abdul Wade (Abdul Wahid Khan), an Afghan immigrant who pioneered camel transportation in Australia’s outback\n\n• Coralia Stavropoulos (Sister Kaliniki), Australia’s first ordained Greek Orthodox nun who dedicated her life to supporting Greek immigrants in Australia\n\n• Malcolm Cole, dancer, teacher, and LGBTQIA+ activist who championed social change and Indigenous rights\n\n• Marie Beuzville Byles, the first practising female solicitor in New South Wales who paved the way for women in law\n\n• Mother John Baptist De Lacy, a pioneering Irish nun who laid the foundation for healthcare and health education in colonial Sydney\n\n• The Resch brothers, German migrants who brewed their way from outback NSW to creating beverage empires\n\n• Ruby Payne-Scott, a trailblazer in radio astronomy and advocate for women in science\n\n• The creation of Weet-Bix, the Australian breakfast staple.\n\nTo date, close to 50 Blue Plaques have been announced in cities and towns right across New South Wales, to honour noteworthy individuals and moments that have contributed to our rich cultural heritage. They include activists, authors, artists, architects, pioneers, philanthropists, groups including Bondi Surf Bathers Life Saving Club and events such as the Soldiers’ Riots.\n\nTo nominate or cast a vote, visit the NSW Government's Have your say webpage.\n\nNominations close Sunday 30 June 2024."
