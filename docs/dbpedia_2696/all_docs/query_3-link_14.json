        "text": "Sir Richard Owen, the 19th century anatomist and palaeontologist who first used the term dinosaur, has been honoured by the Society of Biology by having a blue heritage plaque installed at his former school, Lancaster Royal Grammar. The plaque was unveiled yesterday at a small ceremony. Blue plaques serve to act as a historical marker, indicating that a notable person was associated with a place or that an important, historical event occurred at that location. This blue plaque commemorates that fact that Sir Richard (knighted in 1884), attended the school from 1809-1819.\n\nThe Blue Plaque Erected at Lancaster Royal Grammar School\n\nPicture credit: LRGS\n\nSir Richard Owen\n\nUndoubtedly, Sir Richard Owen was a very talented scientist and an extremely clever man. Although he did not impress all his tutors whilst at Lancaster Grammar School. One school master described him as “impudent” and doubted whether the son of a merchant would ever amount to very much. Although Sir Richard gained a great deal of acclaim during his lifetime and certainty did make a huge contribution to science, by all accounts he had a very egregious character.\n\nThere are a number of accounts of him plagiarising the work of his contemporaries and he was very critical of the work of some of his peers. For example, the then, plain Richard Owen disputed much of the evidence put forward to support the theory of natural selection as suggested by Charles Darwin in the “Origin of Species”, which was first published in 1859. Richard Owen seemed to resent the success of others and he has earned a reputation (perhaps deserved), for being quick to condemn the work of others whilst desiring to talk up his own contribution.\n\nTo read another article about Sir Richard Owen: Remembering Sir Richard Owen.\n\nA Glittering Career\n\nIn a glittering career, which saw him rise to the top of the Victorian scientific community, Sir Richard Owen was awarded many accolades. He supervised the first “life-sized” prehistoric animal replicas as part of the Great Exhibition in 1851, he acquired one of the very first Archaeopteryx fossil specimens and studied it in great detail. He described a vast array of extinct and extant animals and wrote a prestigious amount of academic literature. Perhaps his most notable achievement was campaigning for and helping to set up the museum now known as the Natural History Museum. Owen’s “cathedral to nature” opened in 1881.\n\nSir Richard Owen may be credited with coining the term “dinosaur”, but he was not the first person to note that the strange fossils of ancient animals being found in southern England and elsewhere represented a distinct group of animals. The German palaeontologist, Hermann von Meyer stated that these ancient reptiles now known as dinosaurs should be considered a separate Order as early as 1832, around ten years before Sir Richard Owen coined the term “Dinosauria”.\n\nThe Society of Biology\n\nIn total ten blue plaques are been erected by the Society of Biology to commemorate the contributions to science made by “heroes of biology”. Other recipients include: Patrick Steptoe, Jean Purdy and Robert Edwards who jointly developed IVF, leading to the world’s first test-tube baby, Louise Brown who was born in 1978, (plaque located at Dr Kershaw’s Hospice, Oldham) and Sir Anthony Carlisle, an anatomist who helped develop the concept of producing medical statistics.\n\nThere is even a plaque being erected to “Dolly the Sheep”, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell rather than an embryonic one. This plaque can be seen at the Roslin Institute (part of the University of Edinburgh), where Dolly lived all her life (1996-2003). We are not sure quite how Sir Richard Owen would feel about having a plaque erected to honour him at the same time as a sheep gets one, but we suspect that he would be desperately keen to learn more about the science of genetics, which was virtually unknown when he was alive."
