        "text": "Name of person: Sir Charles Scott Sherrington\n\nLocation of plaque:\n\nDepartment of Physiology Anatomy & Genetics, University of Oxford, UK\n\nUniversity of Liverpool Sherrington Building, University of Liverpool, Ashton Street, Liverpool, UK\n\nDates unveiled: 23 June 2021 (Oxford), 29 September 2021 (Liverpool)\n\nDepartment of Physiology Anatomy & Genetics, University of Oxford, UK\n\nUniversity of Liverpool Sherrington Building, University of Liverpool, Ashton Street, Liverpool, UK\n\nInformation about Sherrington:\n\nThe details of Sir Charles Scott Sherrington’s early childhood are unclear, as certain records indicate that his father and mother were James Norton Sherrington and Anne Thurtell, but others suggest Caleb Rose and Anne Sherrington. Censuses from the time indicate the latter pair were his parents, and that he was born in 1857 in Ipswich.\n\nIn Ipswich school in the 1860s, Sherrington was taught by the famous poet Thomas Ashe. From Ashe, his love of the classics grew. His father was a scholar of the classics and an archaeologist, which furthered Sherrington’s academic inclination.\n\nSir Charles Scott Sherrington, Photograph\n\nIn 1876, he started studying medicine at St Thomas’ Hospital in 1876 and three years later entered Cambridge initially as a non-collegiate student. A year into his studies at Cambridge, he entered Gonville and Caius College. Among his professors at Cambridge was the famous Sir Michael Foster, the so-called “father of British physiology”.\n\nJust a few years later in 1884, he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and a year after that he earned both a First Class in the Natural Sciences Tripos (the framework for teaching life science at Cambridge) with the mark of distinction, and also degree of Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery from Cambridge.\n\nArchive footage: Sir CS Sherrington\n\nAlso in 1884, Sherrington published his first paper, with John Newport Langley, while at Cambridge. The basis of a paper was a controversy between Friedrich Goltz and David Ferrier. Ferrier argued that the cortex (the outer layer of the brain) had various functions localised throughout it whereas Goltz disagreed.\n\nSherrington next travelled to Spain and Italy to study a cholera outbreak, then to Berlin for a few years, and finally back to the UK, first to be as superintendent of the Brown Institute for Advanced Physiological and Pathological Research of the University of London from 1891, and then to Liverpool in 1895 to serve as Holt Professor of Physiology at Liverpool.\n\nIn 1891 Sherrington also married Ethel Mary Wright and six years later they had their one child together, Charles ER Sherrington.\n\nOne of his most famous books, “The Integrative Action of the Nervous System”, was published in 1906, and summarised almost two decades of research. It clarified that the nervous system cannot be viewed as a single interlinking network and gave an alternative explanation of synaptic communication between neurons. This book arguably changes the course of neurophysiology.\n\nHis next academic post was at University of Oxford, starting in 1913, as the Waynflete Professor of Physiology.\n\nSherrington received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1932 with Edgar Adrian for their work on the functions of neurons. Prior to their research, it was thought that reflexes occurred as isolated activity within a reflex arc; they showed that instead, reflexes require integrated activation and showed reciprocal innervation of muscles, a principle now called Sherrington’s Law.\n\nIn 1936, he retired from Oxford and moved back to his place of birth, Ipswich. At the age of 94, he died suddenly of heart failure.\n\nName of person: AV Hill\n\nLocation of plaque: Coupland Building 3, The University of Manchester, Coupland Street, Manchester, M15 6FH\n\nDate unveiled: 16 September 2021\n\nAdditional reading:\n\nBlue Plaque at AV Hill’s former home\n\nHill’s photograph album page 17\n\nPlaque unveiling at The University of Manchester\n\nInformation about A.V. Hill\n\nArchibald Vivian Hill, known as A.V. Hill, was born in 1886 and in 1922, at the age of just 36, was awarded the Nobel Prize ‘for Physiology or Medicine’ with Otto Meyerhoff. Hill’s Nobel citation was for ‘his discovery relating to the production of heat in muscle’. It was awarded for his studies on the relationship between muscle heat and contraction and work. He developed precise methods to measure the heat generation and showed that the initial contraction did not require oxidative metabolism. He demonstrated that oxygen is required during recovery from contraction. This oxygen debt is noticed on recovery after sprinting, for example. Hill’s work on heat production in muscle and his subsequent work relating to electrically excitable cells and to muscle function are foundations of the discipline of biophysics.\n\nHill made massive scientific contributions. Additional work included the eponymous Hill Equation, which is still used to report on interactions and cooperativity of binding. This work was published in 1910 as a communication to The Society. He also analysed the time-course of muscle contraction produced by nicotine and concluded that this reflected ‘a gradual combination of the drug with some constituent of the muscle’. This must be one of the earliest mentions of what we now call a receptor for a drug.\n\nAlongside his scientific research, Hill had an active role in both World Wars, acting as a government scientific adviser before and during the Second World War. He was also a life-long humanitarian. His Nobel Prize was awarded soon after the end of the First World War and he advocated extending the invitation to The Society’s international congress to all scientists including those not from the Allied Powers.Hill also worked with Ernest Rutherford (who was in Manchester from 1907 to 1919) and William Beveridge to establish the Academic Assistance Council, which helped scientist victims of Nazi persecution. This was at a time when the events in Germany were not known to the majority of people in the UK. This organisation helped a thousand scientists escape, including 18 who went on to win Nobel Prizes, and many members of The Physiological Society.\n\nA.V. Hill, Photograph\n\nA.V. Hill joined The Society in 1912 and filled many major roles (Secretary 1927-33, Foreign Secretary 1934-45, served many years on the Editorial Board of The Journal of Physiology). In 2016, AV Hill’s Novel certificate was gifted to The Physiological Society by the family. This gift recognised the active role Hill played in The Society throughout his scientific career.\n\nName of person: Professor Mary Pickford\n\nLocation of plaque: Old Medical School Quad, Doorway 3, University of Edinburgh\n\nDate unveiled: 22 October 2021\n\nInformation about Professor Mary Pickford\n\nProfessor Pickford started her career when there were few women doctors and considerable prejudice against women scientists; she went on to make her mark on medicine and physiological science.\n\nBorn in India, Pickford graduated in science from Bedford College, London, in 1924. While conducting pharmacological research part-time at UCL, with AJ Clarke and EB Verney, she trained in medicine and qualified in 1933.\n\nMary Pickford, Photograph\n\nAfter junior clinical jobs, she took a post as physiology lecturer at Edinburgh University, where she studied oxytocin and anti-diuretic hormone in dogs. She gained a DSc in 1951 (Edinburgh) and later was given an Honorary DSc by the Heriot-Watt University.\n\nIn 1954 she became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, in 1977 of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and in 1966 of the Royal Society of London. In 1966, she was the first woman to hold a chair in the Edinburgh Medical Faculty. She published extensively and in 1972 was appointed Special Professor of Endocrinology at Nottingham University.\n\nName of person: Sir Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer\n\nLocation of plaque: Old Medical School Quad at the University of Edinburgh, UK (where Sharpey-Schafer was appointed Chair of Physiology from 1899 until his retirement.)\n\nDate unveiled: 10 May 2022\n\nInformation about Sir Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer:\n\nSir Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer (1850 –1935) was an English physiologist and Fellow of the Royal Society. Born Edward Schäfer, he studied under the physiologist William Sharpey and became the first Sharpey Scholar in 1873 at University College London (UCL). In 1874 he was appointed Assistant Professor of Practical Physiology at UCL where he went on to become Jodrell Professor. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1878 at the age of just 28. Schäfer was appointed Chair of Physiology at the University of Edinburgh in 1899 where he would stay until his retirement. He was one of the nineteen founder members of the Physiological Society in 1876 and he also founded and edited [the Quarterly Journal of] Experimental Physiology from 1908 until 1933. Schäfer was knighted in 1913. He is renowned for his invention of the prone-pressure method or Schäfer method of artificial respiration. He was very active as a facilitator, mentor, coordinator, teacher and organiser through much of his career. He had started as a histologist and always emphasised the importance of structural knowledge. He was the co-discoverer (in 1894, with George Oliver) of adrenaline (as in the adrenal-derived, circulating hormone) and he coined the term ‘endocrine’ as the generic term for such secretions.\n\nAfter the death of his eldest son, John Sharpey Schafer, and in memory of his late professor William Sharpey, he changed his surname to Sharpey-Schafer in 1918.\n\nImage in the public domain.

Yeo was the Secretary of The Society until 1889 and campaigned for the value of in vivo research in response to Victorian anti-vivisection campaigns.\n\nYeo graduated in Natural Sciences in 1866 from Trinity College Dublin, Ireland.\n\nHe spent a few years studying in Europe and went onto complete his medical degree at University of Dublin, Ireland, and the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland. It was then that Yeo returned to Trinity College, Dublin acting as Demonstrator of Anatomy.\n\nIn 1868 he gained the gold medal of the Dublin Pathological Society for an essay on renal disease. He went onto teach physiology in the Carmichael School of Medicine in Dublin, Ireland, from 1872-1874. In 1875, he was appointed Professor of Physiology at King’s College London, UK and a couple of years later became Assistant Surgeon at King’s College Hospital.\n\nWhile at King’s College London, Yeo worked with Sir David Ferrier, a Professor of Neuropathology, and together they helped advance brain surgery by studying cerebral localisation in monkeys. The experiments were performed using the antiseptic measures developed by Joseph Lister.\n\nPhotograph: Carte-de-visite of Gerald Francis Yeo by Barraud & Jerrard.

Florence Buchanan is now widely renowned for her discoveries on the transmission of reflex impulses in mammals, birds and reptiles, and the neural control of the heartbeat during exercise\n\nDr Buchanan was the first woman to attend a meeting of The Physiological Society in 1896. Buchanan worked as a research assistant with John Burdon-Sanderson on the electrical responses of muscle at the University of Oxford.\n\nWhen Burdon-Sanderson left University of Oxford in 1904, Dr Buchanan moved to the University Museum of Natural History, where she set up her own lab funded by grants from The Royal Society. She was especially interested in the frequency of the heart rate, and how it varied in different species, in hibernating animals and during exercise. Among her many contributions, she provided data for August Krogh, who wrote “Miss Buchanan has shown us the very great kindness to take some electrocardiograms on subjects starting work on a stationary tricycle”. One of her subjects was the famous Oxford respiratory physiologist CG Douglas, who apparently was ‘not at all heated’ by the exercise. Unfortunately, despite providing data, Dr Buchanan does not appear as an author on the paper, something that would certainly happen now.\n\nImage shows the entry for Florence Buchanan in The Society’s Candidates’ Book\n\nIn 1912, after she had been going to meetings of The Society for 16 years, John Scott Haldane proposed her for membership, making her the first woman proposed to become a member of The Physiological Society. She received 50 signatures of support from renowned scientists. Despite some significant opposition, a membership ballot resulted in overwhelming support for women and in July 1915 the first 6 women were admitted, Dr Buchanan being one of them. By then, she had given at least 10 communications to The Society, published 2 papers in The Journal of Physiology and 3 in what is now called Experimental Physiology.\n\nName of person: Sir Michael Foster\n\nLocation of plaque: Physiology Building at the University of Cambridge where he was Praelector and Chair of Physiology.\n\nDate unveiled: 6 July 2022\n\nThe plaque was unveiled by Professor Ole Paulsen, Chair of Physiology in the Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience at the University of Cambridge, UK\n\nPictured L-R: Professor Roger Thomas, Professor David Paterson, Professor Bill Colledge, Dr Sue Jones and Professor Dino Giussani.\n\nMore information on Sir Michael Foster:\n\nFoster was one of 19 physiologists who gathered at the house of John Burdon on March 1876 to form The Physiological Society for ‘promoting the advancement of physiology and facilitating the intercourse between physiologists’. In 1878, he founded The Journal of Physiology, which has published ground-breaking discoveries and the research of noble prize winners.\n\nAfter a few years of practising medicine as a doctor, Foster switched to a career as a scientist and educator. The transition was initiated by his former teacher, Professor William Sharpey, who invited Foster to give a practical course in physiology at University College London. Foster went onto lead the physiology course at Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, recommended for the position by Professor Thomas Henry Huxley. To have a course dedicated to physiology was itself innovative at the time, as physiology had been deemed as a supplement for the study of human anatomy.\n\nImages in the public domain.\n\nIn his role as Praelector and as Chair of Physiology at University of Cambridge, Foster began a new era where physiology was learnt through experimentation. His course at the university involved a laboratory programme that complimented his lectures. By 1914, the Biological School of Cambridge was established and became one of the best centres of physiological research in the world.\n\nFoster excelled at teaching, inspiring his students to devote their lives to physiology. His pupils included the following famous physiologists, Walter Holbrook Gaskell, John Newport Langley, Albert George Dew-Smith and Sir Charles Scott Sherrington who went on to win the Nobel Prize in 1932. Foster wrote the ‘Textbook of Physiology’, which was published in 1877. It was recognised for its superior quality compared to other texts and became a standard work.\n\nName of person: Professor Thomas Graham Brown\n\nLocation of plaque: Cardiff University’s School of Biosciences where he was chair in Physiology until 1947.\n\nDate unveiled: 29 September 2022\n\nThe plaque was unveiled by Professor Ole Peterson of Cardiff University.\n\nWhile at the University of Wales in Cardiff, Graham Brown was also head of the then new Cardiff Institute of Physiology (CIP). He oversaw considerable growth in the reputation of what would become the University of Wales College of Medicine, now known as Cardiff University School of Medicine.\n\nProfessor David Paterson, President of the Physiological Society, said,\n\nWe are honoured to be in Cardiff to unveil this plaque to remember Professor Thomas Graham Brown. This is the fourteenth unveiling in The Physiological Society’s Blue Plaque scheme which is intended to raise the visibility of physiology and give the wider public an insight into the positive role that ‘the science of life’ plays in their everyday lives. We hope that these plaques will spark curiosity and help inspire new generations to get involved in the physiological sciences.\n\nMore information on Professor Thomas Graham Brown:\n\nProfessor Thomas Graham Brown (1882 – 1965) was a physiologist renowned for his neurological research, and a British Alpine climber. In 1920 he was appointed chair in Physiology at the University of Wales in Cardiff, a position he held until 1947. The Physiological Society was honoured this week to unveil a blue plaque to celebrate his life and work. He is best known for his studies on the neural control of rhythmic movement described in a series of papers published in the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Physiology under the general title of ‘Studies in the physiology of the nervous system.’\n\nProfessor Graham Brown was most famous for finding three new routes up the east face of Mont Blanc. Images in the public domain.\n\nProfessor Graham Brown was the first to propose a half-centre model of motor neurons in which two groups of spinal neurons can produce basic rhythmic movement. His model was ignored at the time of publishing because it opposed Sir Charles Scott Sherrington’s popular theory of movement. It was only acknowledged fifty years later in the 1960s when Professor Graham Brown’s model set the groundwork for the field of motor control and was supported by Professor Anders Lundberg and Professor Elzbieta Jankowska’s research. The theory reflects today’s widely accepted concept of central pattern generators in motor neurons.\n\nName of person: Sir John Scott Burdon Sanderson\n\nLocation of plaque:\n\nDepartment of Physiology Anatomy & Genetics, University of Oxford, UK\n\nDate unveiled: 17 October 2022\n\nProfessor Denis Noble, University of Oxford UK unveiled plaque, which is positioned at the Burdon Sanderson Cardiac Science Centre at The University of Oxford, UK. Work at the centre is dedicated to the science of normal and abnormal cardiac function.\n\nSir John Scott Burdon Sanderson was born on 21 December 1828 near Newcastle-upon-Tyne to a well-known Northumbrian family. He completed his medical education at The University of Edinburgh UK and in Paris, before becoming the Medical Officer of Health for Paddington, London, UK in 1856 and later physician to the Middlesex Hospital and the Brompton Consumption hospitals.\n\nIn 1871 Sanderson reported that Penicillium inhibited the growth of bacteria, an observation that placed him amongst the forerunners of Alexander Fleming.\n\nIn 1882 he was appointed as the first Waynflete Professor of Physiology at The University of Oxford. Sanderson’s appointment was initially controversial, partly because the university spent a large amount of money on his resources and partly because his position entailed experimentation on animals. However, in the same year he was awarded a Royal Medal by the Royal Society in recognition of his research into the electrical phenomena exhibited by plants, the relations of minute organisms to disease, and of his services to pathology and physiology. A year later, under Sanderson’s direction, the Department of Physiology was established at The University of Oxford.\n\nIn 1895, Sanderson was appointed Regius Professor of Medicine at The University of Oxford and in 1899 he was appointed a Baronet of Banbury Road in the Parish of Saint Giles, Oxford. A year after resigning his university post, Sanderson died in Oxford on 23 November 1905.\n\nName of person: Ernest Starling\n\nLocation of plaque:King’s College London, Guy’s Campus\n\nDate unveiled: 22 June 2023\n\nOn Thursday 22 June 2023, in honour of the influential physiologist Ernest Starling, The Physiological Society dedicated a commemorative blue plaque at King’s College London, Guy’s Campus. The plaque was unveiled to an audience of researchers, students, and followers of Starling’s work.\n\nErnest Starling (1866–1927) was a British physiologist and medical doctor known for his pioneering research in heart function and fluid balance. He trained in medicine and taught at Guy’s Hospital. His groundbreaking work led to the formulation of the “Starling’s Law of the Heart,” which showed the relationship between heart muscle stretch and cardiac output. Starling’s other contributions include the concept of hormones, pioneering the understanding of how a substance produced in one part of the body can make a specific response elsewhere in the body. His work profoundly impacted medicine and continues to inform modern physiology.\n\nThe event included talks from academics from King’s College London. In his talk titled “Ernest Starling at the Heart of Medical Education,” Professor Mike Shattock explored the influence of Starling’s work on contemporary medical teachings. Dr Fulye Argunhan talked about the contribution of Starling’s work to our understanding of heart disease. Finally, Alice Arcidiacono, a PhD candidate, examined the molecular foundation of the “Frank-Starling Law of the Heart.”\n\nBy commemorating Ernest Starling at King’s College London, The Physiological Society reiterates its dedication to acknowledging key figures in the discipline, acting as a reminder of our scientific roots and that physiology continues to change the world.\n\nFollowing the plaque unveiling, Professor David Attwell, President of the Physiological Society, said:\n\n“We are honoured to be at Kings College London to unveil this plaque to remember Ernest Starling. He was the first physiologist to discover the action of hormones, and his work on how the heart works was groundbreaking.\n\n“The Physiological Society’s Blue Plaque scheme raises the visibility of physiology. It gives the wider public an insight into the positive role that ‘the science of life’ plays in their everyday lives.\n\n“We hope these plaques will spark curiosity and help inspire new generations to get involved in the physiological sciences.”\n\nProfessor Rachel Tribe, Vice Dean (Research & Impact) and Professor of Maternal and Perinatal Sciences at Kings College London unveiled the plaque and said:\n\n“Ernest Starling is part of the pioneering and physiological heritage of King’s College and Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals, and it is fitting that The Physiological Society is honouring him in this way.”\n\nName of person: Francis Arthur Bainbridge\n\nLocation of plaque: Newcastle University,UK\n\nDate unveiled: 28 September 2023\n\nThe Physiological Society today dedicated a commemorative blue plaque in honour of the outstanding cardiac and exercise physiologist Francis Arthur Bainbridge. The plaque is displayed at the Medical School at Newcastle University.\n\nFrancis Arthur Bainbridge (1874 – 1921) is best known for the work he conducted whilst in Newcastle showing how heart rate is controlled. In 1915, he reported that an increased volume of blood returning to the heart caused chamber distension and a resultant increase in heart rate. This phenomenon has become known as the “Bainbridge reflex”.\n\nAs well as his pioneering work in exercise physiology, Bainbridge uncovered the mechanism of lymph formation (a fluid that flows through the body’s immune system) and made important contributions to the functional mechanisms of the gall bladder. He also provided new insight into the different strains of salmonella bacteria that can cause typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever.\n\nFollowing the plaque unveiling, Professor David Attwell, President of the Physiological Society, said:\n\n“We are honoured to be at Newcastle University to unveil this plaque to remember Francis Arthur Bainbridge, and his remarkable contribution to exercise physiology, as well as his interest in understanding the secrets of our body’s organs and systems.\n\n“The Physiological Society’s Blue Plaque scheme raises the visibility of physiology. It gives the wider public an insight into the positive role that ‘the science of life’ plays in their everyday lives.\n\n“We hope these plaques will spark curiosity and help inspire new generations to get involved in the physiological sciences.”\n\nProfessor David Burn, Newcastle University, unveiled the plaque and said:\n\n“It is an honour to unveil this plaque dedicated to Francis Arthur Bainbridge, who made important contributions to cardiac physiology and beyond whilst at Newcastle. He is most famously known for the ‘Bainbridge reflex’, which remains a fundamental principle in cardiac physiology today.”\n\nBy celebrating Francis Arthur Bainbridge, The Physiological Society reiterates its dedication to acknowledging key figures in the discipline, acting as a reminder of our scientific roots and that physiology continues to change the world."
