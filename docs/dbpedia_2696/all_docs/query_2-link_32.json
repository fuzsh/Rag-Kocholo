        "text": "With the support of family, friends, teachers and peers, AP challenged cultural expectations and overcame the lack of opportunities in chemistry available in Sri Lanka in the early 1970s, and first moved to Belfast in 1976 to pursue a PhD in photochemistry at Queen’s University Belfast. AP’s work on molecular sensors (both in Belfast and Colombo) was inspired by his grandmother’s struggle with high blood pressure.\n\nThrough his international collaborations was born a commercial, portable and practical sodium sensor that is used in the field and healthcare settings to this day, that has saved countless lives and improved healthcare around the world.\n\nPlaque awarded: 2024 - read about the unveiling\n\nLocation: Queen’s University Belfast, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, David Keir Building, Stranmillis Road, Belfast, BT9 5AG, UK\n\nDorothy suffered from chronic rheumatoid arthritis from her late twenties which made manipulating scientific equipment difficult. Despite these significant health difficulties, Dorothy balanced her health, family life and research. She advanced the X-ray crystallography technique - the key to studying and understanding the structures of biochemical compounds – and was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1964 for her work determining the structure of vitamin B12 and penicillin.\n\nPlaque awarded: 2001\n\nLocation: Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford\n\nTheir early research took place in converted houses due to wartime city centre damage.\n\nIn 1965, the team had a breakthrough drug trial. It compared the compound now known as ibuprofen against aspirin for easing pain.\n\nFour years later Boots launched \"Brufen\" as a prescription painkiller. By 1983 it was available over the counter becoming the first new non-prescription painkiller introduced since paracetamol in the mid-1950s and only the third since aspirin in 1915. Today a pack of ibuprofen is sold by Boots every two seconds. In the UK alone, annual sales reach over £150 million.\n\nPlaque awarded: 2013\n\nLocation 1: BioCity Nottingham, Pennyfoot Street, Nottingham\n\nLocation 2: Building D6, Boots Beeston Factory Site, Dunkirk Industrial Estate, 1 Thane Road, Nottingham\n\nInstead, many scientists uncovered more and more about it from 1869-1953, culminating in the discovery of the famous double helix.\n\nThis Royal Society of Chemistry plaque on The Strand in London celebrates the group of scientists whose X-ray diffraction images of crystallized DNA were key to solving the mystery of its chemical structure which has subsequently brought far-reaching technological advancements and understanding across health, agriculture and animal and forensic science.\n\nPlaque awarded: 2003\n\nLocation: Strand Campus, King's College London\n\nElsie grew up in London and was a trailblazer for women in chemistry. She was one of the first female graduates of Imperial College where she gained her PhD researching sugar content in apples. This led to her influential and impactful career in dietary science…\n\nElsie's research interests developed into animal and human biochemistry. She headed up wartime research that saw vitamins added to food and shaped the second world war rations programme. She also improved infant formula milk in the 1980s. Widdowson’s nutrition experiments in orphanages are famous for demonstrating how a child’s emotional state can affect growth. Women researchers at Imperial College today can apply for an Elsie Widdowson award to help balance research with family life.\n\nPlaque awarded: 2009\n\nLocation: MRC Elsie Widdowson Laboratory (formerly MRC Human Nutrition Research)\n\nScientists confirmed the link between toxic smog and car fumes in the 1970s and new laws around car emissions followed. Johnson Matthey PLC had already begun developing the world’s first commercial autocatalysts. Since then it has developed catalysts and filters for petrol and diesel vehicles that have stopped billions of tonnes of car pollutants entering the air from car exhausts.\n\nPlaque awarded: 2014\n\nLocation: Johnson Matthey PLC, Orchard Road, Royston, Hertfordshire"
