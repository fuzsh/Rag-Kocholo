You will be able to access your list from any article in Discover.\n\nYou don't have any saved articles.\n\nDorothea Minola Alice Bate, born in 1878, was a historically significant palaeontologist, ornithologist and zoologist. She spent 50 years working for the Natural History Museum and is credited as a trailblazer in the field of archaeozoology.\n\nBate was the first female scientist to be employed by the Natural History Museum, after she travelled to London and demanded a job in the Bird room - a significant achievement in a time when science was a profession dominated by men.\n\nThe scientist's Welsh origins have now been commemorated with a blue plaque to mark her birthplace - Napier House, on Spilman Street in Carmarthen, southwest Wales.\n\nBlue plaques are widely recognised markers linking a significant individual or event to a location.\n\nBate's plaque reads, in both English and Welsh:\n\n'Dorothea Bate\n\n1878-1951\n\nPalaeontologist and the first woman employed at the Natural History Museum, London, was born here.'\n\nCommemorating a pioneer\n\nCarmarthen Civic Society, who planned the dedication, invited Dr Victoria Herridge and Karolyn Shindler to the unveiling.\n\nDr Herridge is a palaeobiologist who worked with Bate's collections at the Museum in her study of dwarf elephants and mammoths. Shindler is an associate at the Museum's Library and has penned a biography on the life and work of the celebrated scientist.Â\n\nOn the importance of the plaque, Dr Herridge says, 'It is recognition. It shows that someone has done something of value - even if you don't know who they are.\n\n'It's going to represent the achievements of pioneering female scientist Dorothea Bate. Her work is still relevant to evolutionary biology today.\n\n'It could be an inspiration to young girls that might walk past and see it.'\n\nBate spent part of her career exploring Mediterranean islands, uncovering interesting specimens in the process.\n\n'She discovered two species of dwarf elephant and a bizarre, goat-like animal called Myotragus,' says Dr Herridge.\n\nHer island discoveries showed evidence of gigantism and dwarfism. Gigantism is linked to a lack of natural predators, and dwarfism is the result of large animals shrinking in response to limited resources.\n\nBate is also noted for her work in the caves of Israel's Mount Carmel, where she worked with another well-known female scientist of the time, archaeologist Dorothy Garrod.\n\nBate faced a change of pace during the Second World War. Much of the Museum's collections were moved to Tring in Hertfordshire to avoid damage and loss from air raids in London. Bate went with the collections, and in 1948 she was employed as Officer in Charge at the Tring Museum.Â"
