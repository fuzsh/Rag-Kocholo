        "text": "What is a Blue Plaque\n\nA blue plaque is a permanent sign installed in a public place to commemorate a person, building or event and a link to that site, becoming a historical marker and a recognition of significance. An 'official' scheme is run by English Heritage; regional schemes are administered by organisations throughout the UK.\n\nSt Helens Borough Council will be launching a Blue Plaque scheme in 2024, and nominations are invited by the public. There are various other existing plaques in the borough, a list can be seen below. To nominate a person, building or event, please complete the nomination form.\n\nEligibility Criteria\n\nBlue plaques can be established to mark a person, a building or event with historic cultural significance.\n\nIndividuals should have made notable achievement internationally, nationally or locally and have a strong connection to the local area - ideally having been born in the borough.\n\nPlaques can only be considered for people who are deceased for more than twenty years.\n\nFictitious characters will not be commemorated.\n\nCommemoration of buildings requires a historic cultural significance worthy of public notice, whether from a historical event or an important cultural significance that's not obvious from its present appearance.\n\nFunding will be limited to the number of plaques that can be established; however additional plaques may be delivered if funding has been raised by the applicant.\n\nApplications will be reviewed annually and decisions are final, although previous submissions can be re-nominated if unsuccessful. St Helens Borough Council retain the right to remove a blue plaque if necessary. This Blue Plaque scheme is part-funded by the UK government through the UK Shared Prosperity Fund.\n\nWho has a St Helens Borough Blue Plaque?\n\n2024 - Hannah Rosbotham (1858-1935)\n\nHannah Rosbotham became first woman to receive a medal for bravery when she was awarded the Albert Medal by Queen Victoria. Her act of bravery took place on Friday 14 October 1881 when she rescued many pupils from a collapsed belfry at Sutton National School. Her plaque was unveiled in July 2024 and located on Sutton Family Hub, built on site of the former school."
