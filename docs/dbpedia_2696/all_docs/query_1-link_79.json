        "text": "“The thing to remember about blue plaques,” said John Precedo, “is that they’re not all blue, they’re not all round, and they’re not all English Heritage.” He should know. Three years ago the 46-year-old media analyst, who tweets as @BluePlaquesGuy, got hooked on the plaques affixed to hundreds of our buildings (most, but not all of them, in London) acknowledging a link to the past, usually to someone of note who lived or worked there.\n\nNext weekend, English Heritage is running a series of London guided walks to celebrate 150 years since the first panel of selectors met to decide who should get a plaque. Back in 1866 it was the only scheme of its kind in the world, as far as we know, inspired by a speech made by the Liberal MP William Ewart. The first subject was Lord Byron, a rather surprising choice in prim Victorian London, though sadly both plaque and building are now gone.\n\nEven all these years on these beguiling dots of history add hugely to the experience of exploring the capital, for visitors and Londoners alike. Now this year’s tranche of new plaque names, including Freddie Mercury in Feltham, Margot Fonteyn in Covent Garden, and Tommy Cooper in Chiswick, takes the total number of plaques in London to more than 900.\n\nWhile for Precedo, the pleasure is more in the research than in finding the plaques, for me, it’s in rounding a corner to find a building you might have walked straight past suddenly freighted with interest by the presence of a blue roundel. I always cross to see who it is. Suddenly that blank-faced house loses its fourth wall as the imagination fires, taking you inside, in your mind’s eye, to imagine Anna Maria Garthwaite weaving Spitalfields silk, or Miss Fonteyn practising demi-plies in her flat.\n\nYou can also use the plaques to plot a route across the capital. Take the Bedford Estate in London WC2: starting with Virginia Woolf and George Bernard Shaw in artsy Fitzroy Square, you can potter on through Bloomsbury’s streets, via the former homes of scientist Charles Darwin, the natural philosopher Henry Cavendish and Daphne du Maurier’s father George, to find, just south of Russell Square, the plaque for Hans Sloane, the physician and founder of the British Museum.\n\nSome areas have dense clusters of plaques, such as Cheyne Walk beside the Thames in Chelsea which was popular with writers and artists – the novelists George Eliot and Mrs Gaskell among them, as well as the suffragist Sylvia Pankhurst. And look out for the many establishment figures adorning Queen Anne’s Gate in Westminster.\n\nThe scheme isn’t without its flaws. The latest panel of selectors stands accused of being too white and male, and women and different races are still under-represented on plaques, although that is slowly improving.\n\nJust remember, as you start hunting, that the shapes and colours of plaques can be confusing, as John Precedo pointed out. I’m doing one of the anniversary walks, which includes plaques to an 18th-century caricaturist, an American inventor and two legendary diarists, features a brown plaque, a bronze plaque, a stone plaque and two rectangles, some of them listing several names.\n\nThis is because the scheme, now run by English Heritage, has had several custodians, including the Royal Society of Arts (formerly the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce). Initially they were a delicate blue and white with a white surround, later a rich brown, and a few of them are multicoloured.\n\nLater, there were London County Council plaques decorated with laurel leaves, and later still plaques with Greater London Council around the rim. English Heritage took control in 1986, established the blue roundel with a white rim and a portcullis symbol, and has run it ever since.\n\nThey all add to the gaiety of city life, though English Heritage does employ strict criteria: the person must have been dead for 20 years and, perhaps most importantly, they must have lived or worked in that specific building. “It means there’s a real connection,” says Precedo simply. “The people were really there, or the event actually happened in that building. That really matters to me.”\n\nMapped: London's quirkiest blue plaques\n\nBlue plaque essentials\n\nFor more information on Blue Plaques see www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/.\n\nFour anniversary walks take place on May 7 and 8 in Hampstead, Piccadilly, Belgravia and Covent Garden. English Heritage members £15, non-members £20. Advance booking (on the above link) is essential.\n\nThe current edition of Lived in London; Blue Plaques and the stories behind them, edited by Emily Cole, with a foreword by Stephen Fry, costs £50 from the EH online shop. A new edition comes out in September.\n\nAlso see the useful website openplaques.org and the @BluePlaquesGuy twitter feed.\n\nThere’s a lovely little film on the making of the ceramic plaques by the Ashworth family in Cornwall, using a unique clay recipe and their own techniques on london-plaques.com.\n\nTo coincide with the anniversary, there will soon be a Blue Plaque app available to download from the App Store.\n\nThames Path anniversary\n\nIt’s not just the blue plaques that have a 2016 anniversary closely associated with London, writes Sophie Campbell. In July it will be 20 years since the opening of the Thames Path, a triumph of grass roots activism running 184 miles from a Cotswolds spring to the Thames Barrier near Woolwich. Just over 40 miles of it runs through Greater London, surprising everyone in 2013 by appearing in Lonely Planet’s World Top 10 City Hikes. I know this section well because of the summer walks I lead for Telegraph readers and I’m walking the upper stretches bit by bit. Here are some of my highlights.\n\nThames Head\n\nI’ve never forgotten seeing what is generally agreed to be the source of the Thames, marked by an inscribed stone, just near Kemble in Gloucestershire. It looks as though someone has left a tap running, and it seems inconceivable it could reach the size that it does 184 miles downstream.\n\nMarlow to Henley-on-Thames\n\nThis section seems to me the essence of Thames landscape, with its green-fringed banks, weirs, locks, mills and riverside mansions. I love seeing the dragon finials on boathouses and rowing eights belting around the bends. Once you reach the island temple just before Henley, you know you’re at the start of the famous regatta course.\n\nThames Barrier to Erith\n\nMany people dismiss this stretch as ugly, but I love it, partly because of the Crossness Pumping Station. It’s one of the best examples of Victorian industrial engineering (and interior decoration) you’ll see. More information and opening times on crossness.org.uk.\n\nTelegraph Tours: London with Sophie Campbell\n\nJoin our heritage expert on this popular guided walk through the riverside history of London, starting in the south-west suburbs of London and going all the way to the Thames Barrier. On your first day you will meet at Hampton Court then start your journey to the other end of London, with overnight stays in Richmond, Wandsworth and Rotherhithe en route. You will make several stops including Strawberry Hill House, Kew Palace and Gardens, William Morris’s House, Chelsea Old Church, Tate Britain, the Painted Hall at the Old Naval College in Greenwich and the Thames Barrier. One previous walker commented of Sophie: “Your knowledge and enthusiasm made this an outstanding experience and introduced us to many different aspects of London that we didn’t even know existed.”\n\nHighlights\n\nStrawberry Hill House, described as a Gothic “plaything”. It was built in the 1740s by Horace Walpole, who was the son of Robert Walpole, our first prime minister\n\nKew Palace, where George III spent summers with his wife and 15 children\n\nKelmscott House, the residence of social philosopher William Morris for 18 years.\n\nThe magnificent decorative Painted Hall at the Old Naval College in Greenwich\n\nBrunel Museum, which traces the remarkable engineering behind Marc and Isambard Brunel’s Thames Tunnel.\n\nWhat’s included\n\nThree nights’ accommodation at the four-star Richmond Hill Hotel, four-star Alma Hotel and the four-star Hilton London Docklands Riverside\n\nWelcome drink and dinner\n\nFour days of guided walks with Sophie Campbell\n\nTransport of luggage between overnight stops\n\nTour manager\n\nDetails\n\nPrice: £899pp including evening meals with wine\n\nDepartures (all 2016): June 26, July 17, Sept 11\n\nPartner: Travel Editions"
