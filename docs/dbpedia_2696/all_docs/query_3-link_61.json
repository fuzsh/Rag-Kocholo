        "text": "On March 14th, a special unveiling event was held for a new plaque from the Birmingham Civic Society, dedicated to award-winning and pioneering photographer Emma Barton. The unveiling was held at South & City College Birmingham’s Digbeth campus. This was the site of her Digbeth photography studio, which is where the plaque will remain to remember her legacy.\n\nEmma Barton (1872-1938) came from a working class Birmingham background. She created extraordinary portrait photographs and was one of only a few women photographers recognised and respected for her work at the time, winning many awards in her lifetime and even exhibiting internationally.\n\nThe unveiling included a look at her eye-opening photography catalogue, and presentations on the history of her life and her studio. This is one of over 50 blue plaques that the Birmingham Civic Society have awarded to celebrate the legacy of extraordinary Birmingham locals.\n\nBorn Emma Rayson, she married a solicitor, George Barton, and had five children. Her family would often be the subjects of her portraits. By the 1880s photography was becoming more accessible, and Emma Barton created exceptional work in her home and garden. Her first step into fame came from her photographs of Dan Leno, a leading entertainer in the late Victorian period.\n\nFrom the turn of the 20th century, Emma Barton began exhibiting at the Royal Photography Society. Her striking photograph of a mother and child, The Awakening, 1903, saw her awarded the Royal Photography Society Medal. She had her first solo show the next year.\n\nAs her popularity grew, Emma Barton’s photos were exhibited across England, but also in Paris, Berlin, and even across the Atlantic in America. She was published in periodicals at home and abroad, such as The Sketch, The Graphic and Illustrated London News. At the height of her career she was a candidate for the most published female photographer of the time.\n\nShe continued to be awarded for her work and to develop her style throughout her life, even after she stopped exhibiting in 1918, only fully retiring to the Isle of Wight in 1932. Her work continues to have an impact on the photography world today, with two of her portraits on display in The National Portrait Gallery of London, as well as at the Royal Photography Society and the Victoria and Albert museums.\n\nEmma Barton’s story is a true inspiration, both in coming from such a humble background and in overcoming the humongous societal challenges for ambitious and extraordinarily talented women in Victorian England. South & City College Birmingham will host this blue plaque proudly – photography students from the college even came to the event to learn of such an important role-model here in Birmingham."
