        "text": "If you’ve ever wanted to nominate a notable person or organisation for a Blue Plaque, then now’s your chance, as Historic England is seeking ideas from the public.\n\nTo be eligible, the person being nominated needs to have died at least 20 years ago and have at least one building associated with them that survives from the time of their occupancy and where a plaque would be clearly visible from a public highway.\n\nThey are also required to have made a significant contribution to human welfare or happiness and/or have made an exceptional impact in their field, community, or society at large.\n\nBlue plaques celebrate the relationship between people and places, such as where they were born, worked, lived, or died. Because of this, plaques need to be on surviving buildings with evidence of a meaningful connection with the person commemorated.\n\nNominations can be made here until 19th July 2024.\n\nResearch Grants\n\nIn order to encourage a wide range of blue plaque nominations from the public, Historic England is also inviting community groups to apply for its new Community Research Grants. These grants are available for organisations working with historians or researchers who want to discover more about historical figures who may be eligible for a national blue plaque.\n\nHistoric England hopes that through funding this work there will be an increase in the diversity of people nominated for blue plaques and that this new research will uncover untold stories in different communities and places.\n\nFunding will be up to £7,000 per project.\n\nSUPPORT THIS WEBSITE\n\nThis website has been running now for over a decade, and while advertising revenue contributes to funding the website, it doesn't cover the costs. That is why I have set up a facility with DonorBox where you can contribute to the costs of the website and time invested in writing and research for the news articles.\n\nIt's very similar to the way The Guardian and many smaller websites are now seeking to generate an income in the face of rising costs and declining advertising.\n\nWhether it's a one-off donation or a regular giver, every additional support goes a long way to covering the running costs of this website, and keeping you regularly topped up doses of Londony news and facts.\n\nIf you like what you read on here, then please support the website here.\n\nThank you"
