        "text": "Leeds Civic Trust were delighted to unveil our 193rd blue plaque to celebrate Duncan Dallas (1940-2014) and Elizabeth Brice (1957-2011).\n\nThe blue plaque celebrates their remarkable achievements. Duncan was the founder of the worldwide Café Scientifique movement. Elizabeth was a leading campaigner for the\n\nmedical use of cannabis. They were both television producers, they married in 1984, and their joint plaque will be at the house in Chapel Allerton where they lived. This is the first blue plaque unveiled by Leeds Civic Trust for two people from the same household who merit the award of a blue plaque in their own right.\n\nThe plaque was unveiled on Wednesday 17 April by Charles Dallas, the son of Duncan and Elizabeth. Speeches were given by Dominic Rayner and Barbara Govan.\n\nThis plaque has been sponsored by kind donations through a crowdfunding campaign.\n\nIf you would like to visit the blue plaque it is located on at 8 Regent Street Chapel Allerton."
