        "text": "In various corners of the United Kingdom and beyond, you’ll find Blue Plaques, steadfast fixtures in public spaces. They stand as enduring tributes, linking a locale to a notable individual, momentous event, or significant site, acting as touchstones to history. Remarkably, this tradition boasts the distinction of being the world’s oldest of its kind.\n\nThe inaugural plaque, dating back to 1867, honored Lord Byron at his birthplace, 24 Holles Street, Cavendish Square, setting the precedent for countless more to follow.\n\nToday, the town of Wetherby proudly showcases 21 Blue Plaques adorning its buildings and landmarks, each a testament to the town’s rich tapestry of history. Their presence is owed to the generosity of the Civic Society, the Historical Trust, and numerous building owners who have contributed to their installation.\n\nThe location of Wetherby’s Blue Plaques:\n\nClicking on any of the plaques below will give you greater detail and background."
