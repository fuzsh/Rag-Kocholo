        "text": "In February 2022, the Rana Museum and the Rana History Association took the initiative to select and mark cultural and historical buildings in Rana with blue plaques. In November 2022, blue plaques were put up on 15 buildings. In 2024, 10 new buildings will receive a blue sign.\n\nThe aim of the blue sign is to create a sense of belonging and pride for both ex-pats and newcomers, to build identity, tell stories and give the city a distinctive character. It will also give a strong signal effect about the importance of taking care of buildings that have been important in Rana’s history.\n\nBuildings that got the blue plaque in 2022\n\nMo church\n\nBuilt in the autumn of 1723 as a simple cruciform church of timber, paneled and tarred, with choir and sacristy, and with a roof of red flagstone. The first service was on Holy Three Kings Day on 6 January 1724. The mission fund provided a grant of 300 riksdaler for the building. Mo church was later demolished and replaced by a new and larger church around 1801. This was a cruciform church with a ground plan following a medieval pattern.\n\nThe church was bought by Mo congregation in 1827. From 1843 to 2004, the church was the mother church in Mo parish. The altarpiece was made by Jens Pedersøn Fagermoen (1718–1800) from Dalsgrenda after a model from Hemnes church and given as a gift. The style combines Renaissance with Baroque and folk art.\n\nIn 1860, the church was extended to the west and got a new pulpit and altarpiece. The church has undergone restorations in 1801, 1832, 1860, 1956 and 2007. In 1832 the onion dome was built, and in 1860 the stone fence around the church was built. A church bell was purchased in 1761. In 1850 it was recast, and in 1879 a new one was purchased. Around 1893 the church bought its first organ, it was in use from 1895 to 1924 when it was replaced by a new one. During the restoration in 1956, the baptismal sacristy was converted into a small chapel with its own altar, and the altarpiece from 1766 was placed there.\n\nThe church appears today as a beautiful empire church. It is protected as a cultural monument and listed by the Norwegian Church on the advice of the National Antiquarian. It is defined as worthy of protection and is considered to have national value.\n\nMo parsonage\n\nOn Mo there were two large farms: Nermo and Øvermo. Øvermo was below the church approximately where the parsonage is today. Øvermo was sold in 1849 by owner Jacob Coldevin to the diocesan board in Tromsø, because the farm was to become a priest’s farm. This must be seen in the light of the fact that the vicarage was previously located on Stenneset, and a boat ride back and forth was required every time the priest went to the church. The houses on Øvermo were then demolished. (But the castle parlor from 1860 was taken care of. It has ended up in the museum collection at Stenneset.) A new farmhouse was built in 1867, and it is this house that became the priest’s residence. At that time, Øvermo was divided into two farms, Øvermo and Sørmo, which were located a little further west. Sørmo was also to be part of the rectory. But the priest had to wait for many years to be allowed to use Sørmo, because the widow Maren Andersdatter had the right to live there for the rest of her life. And Maren never dies, parish priest Nannestad used to say.\n\nThe vicarage is to be typical of the civil servant family’s building practice in the 1860s. Christian Ludvig Nannestad was the first parish priest who lived here in the years 1867–1883. The last priest who lived here was Sverre Widsteen in the years 1922–1953. It was the priest who in these years looked after the state’s interests as landowner of the former Øvermo farm, and who signed lease contracts for people who wanted to build on the state’s land.\n\nAfter 1955, the house was used for a time to alleviate the housing shortage, but in 1969 the parish council was given permission to dispose of it. Today, the parish council has moved to more modern premises in the city centre. The vicarage is nevertheless still used by the congregation for various activities. Around 1970, the building cost a good NOK. 200,000, and further restoration was carried out in 1988. The house appears to be well maintained and in good condition. A number of details such as mouldings, window types etc. from the construction period has been preserved. But the beautiful garden from the old days is not sought to be maintained as a garden. The building itself is now owned by Rana municipality, but the land on which it stands is owned by Opplysningsvesenets Fond. Regulated for conservation and located in a conservation area.\n\nThe tower building\n\nBuilt as a business/storage shop for L.A. Meyer in 1893. Typical Swiss house in clapboard timber and half-timbering on two high floors with a high attic and slate roof. Richly carved moldings around windows and doors, marked floor separation, ridge crest and tower with decoration and spire. Was run as a business until 1954.\n\nMeyer ran one of the city’s first discount stores here in 1983–84. The building’s first floor was used as craft workshops and a second-hand shop 1984–88.\n\nThe building was bought by the Freemasons’ lodge in the late 1980s, they now use the entire building. From 1990 to 2008, Rana Museum had premises for its natural history department on the 1st floor. Length: 34 metres, width: 11 metres. Regulated for conservation and located in a conservation area.\n\nThe bakery building\n\nBuilt 1909 as L.A. Meyer’s bakery with bread stall, baker’s shop, wild meat storage, butter stall, meat shop and foundry store. The second floor housed a furniture outlet, while the third floor was used as a painting workshop and furniture warehouse. The building was also called Nystua or Smørbua.\n\nAfter 1945, renovations were carried out with changes to the facade. The building later housed, among other things, sports shop and plumbing shop. The building was bought by Rana municipality in 1991. From 2008 it has been a “living, learning and working place” for mental health, some rooms are rented out to painting studios.\n\nLength: 24 metres, width: 15 metres, with two high floors and an attic. Swiss decor. The roof was renovated after the year 2000, today’s corrugated tin roof is identical to what the house had in 1909. Regulated for conservation and located in a conservation area.\n\nHeim\n\nHeim (which means “home” is the old building at Meyergården) was built in the second half of the 1880s and was completed in 1890. The executive architect was Ole Falk Ebbell, Trondheim for Lars Aagaard Meyer and his wife Hanne Smith Meyer. The house is built in Swiss style, with elements of Art Nouveau, on a foundation wall of hewn gray stone from Meyer’s own land. The building was built by builder John Lilleby from Namsos. The building has a slate roof and richly carved detailing. According to the contract, the timber work was finished in 1886. In 1890, Lars Aa. and Hanne Meyer move in with her family.\n\nIn 1890, the storehouse was also erected, and upon moving in, a park with walkways and a kitchen garden had already been laid out. The park was Hanne Meyer’s work, and it was later expanded. The house eventually got the name “Heim”.\n\nAfter Lars Aa. Meyer’s death, “Heim” also became the home of his son Hans A. Meyer and his wife Thora Meyer. After Hans A. Meyer’s death in 1926, Mrs. Thora Meyer established the place as a tourist hotel. The hotel operation was later continued by their daughter Valborg under the name Meyergården. The building is included in Rana municipality’s protection plan from 2002, and protection is proposed to be continued.\n\nTrønsdalsgården\n\nIn 1905, the painter Johan Trønsdal and his wife Levie obtained an agreement on land with Hans and Carsten Meyer, and were able to build their residential house with four apartments and two attic rooms. In the early days, his family, his brother (also a painter) John, editor in Dunderlandsdølen Redvald Knudtson and goldsmith Johannesen lived in the house. Johan Trønsdal had his painting business in the building, and the jeweler also operated here. For a period there was also a hairdresser’s salon in the house. In 1922, a paint shop opened in the building – a small shop of 20 square metres.\n\nBefore 1940, the family took over the entire house, and Johan’s son Harry took over the operation in 1949. The third building stage, a concrete extension, came into being in 1956. In 1994, architect Nils Toft was engaged, he oversaw a remodel inside and out to safeguard it old style. Lars Trønsdal took over the operation from 1980, and ran it until 2009. At that time, the shop and warehouse were a total of 600 square meters.\n\nFrom 2011, there has been restaurant operation on the building’s first floor, while the second floor has been used for offices and an apartment. Regulated for conservation and located in a conservation area.\n\nMurbräckgården\n\nBuilt in 1905 as a residence for steamship dispatcher Paul Murbræck, married to L.A. Meyer’s daughter Hildur. She received land and a house as a wedding present from her father. Their son Erling started a dental practice in the building in 1937 and operated there until approx. 1972. Fenced garden and outbuildings close to the town’s former square. The building takes place in a comprehensive cultural heritage environment, is regulated for conservation and is located in a conservation area.\n\nThe municipality house\n\nAfter the old permanent school at Mo was destroyed in a big fire in 1884, a new school was built in the same place. The new school was built according to state standard drawings with norms for class size – including 30 square meters with a three-metre ceiling height for a classroom.\n\nThe new school was completed in 1886 – a one-storey timber building with a dark ceiling, 16 m long, 7.5 m wide and 3.5 m high to the rafters. There were originally four rooms: school room, council room, an aisle and a teacher’s room. For 20 years, the building served as a school and municipal building for Mo and Nord-Rana municipalities.\n\nWith the construction period and the great population growth after the turn of the century, the school became too small, and a new and modern school was built at Moheia, which was completed in 1906. From now on, the building was only used as municipal premises. In the interwar period, both Mo and Nord-Rana municipalities had most of their offices in the building in Strandgata. From 1977 to 1990, the Rana museum, natural history department, had its premises here. Later, the building was taken over by Ranen Husflidslag, which still has its association premises here. Regulated for conservation and located in a conservation area.\n\nSkulestad hotel\n\nThe building was built here by Gina and Anders Skulestad in 1902. The log house was probably built in Rombaksbotn, later dismantled and transported to Mo. In any case, we know that the Skulestad couple ran a hotel there in connection with the construction of the Ofotbanen, and a model of Rombaksbotn at Narvik station shows a similar building. Gina Skulestad ran a hotel here until 1930. The hotel had three rooms and a kitchen on the main floor, and six rooms on the first floor.\n\nThe author Tor Jacobsen interviewed Olaug Bustnes (b. 1907) from Toraneset, and writes about the Skulestad hotel: … she got work at the hotel together with her friend Solveig Aas. Solveig took care of the rooms, while Olaug worked in the cafe. Olaug remembers long working days, from 7 in the morning until the evening meal was finished. The hotel had 5–6 guest rooms and permanent dormitory residents, among them Augusta Torp. Several employees at Meyer had permanent pensions at Skulestad, but business travelers made up the largest customer base. Among them, Olaug “Silver Fox” was remembered, who of course traveled in leather goods. He was a thrifty gentleman who never gave the girls at Skulestad more than 25 øre in tips – shared. Another regular guest was state police officer Sevald Ludvik Høiberg. He had to have extra service when he got up in the middle of the night to go in search of moonshine, and therefore he was also generous with tips, the moonshine hunter usually gave the girls a krone to share. The hotel had no running water and lacked toilets. The girls helped each other empty piss buckets with vomit on top! It also happened that guests brought uninvited guests with them, and then they had to go to the pharmacy to buy anti-lice medication…\n\nHans and Olava Svendsen bought the hotel in 1930 (for NOK 7,000) and ran it until 1939. It was then sold on to florist Ragnhild Jansen and used as a residence. Regulated for conservation and located in a conservation area.\n\nFolkets hus (the people’s house)\n\nMo labor union was founded in 1902, and the members immediately saw the need for a meeting house for the labor movement in Rana. The association acquired land, and Folkets hus was completed in 1904 with a loan from the Workers’ Union. In the first decade, the finances were difficult, as the number of members in the association decreased due to recession. The house was eventually rented out for many purposes, e.g. for the Norwegian theatre tour in 1916. In 1919 Folkets hus was handed over to the Mo Arbeiderparti, and with new loans it was decided to rebuild. The boarded-up building was taken down and a new first floor was built before the building was erected on the basement wall. The building was then extended to the south.\n\nIn 1928, the bank went bankrupt, and the house was taken as mortgage. It was not until 1931 that it was sold at auction, with the Samorganisation as the only bidder (NOK 10,000). During this time and until 1934, the Sanitetsforen-ingen (led by Thora Meyer) had cinema operations in the building, after this and until 1940 the association itself was responsible for cinema operations. Folkets Hus Forening was founded in 1936 and took over the building. It was rented out to organizations inside and outside the labor movement, i.a. to the NM skiing in 1938 when 500 people were present during the closing ceremony. In 1940, the house was rented to Mo AIL, but was occupied by the Germans. The wear and tear was considerable during the war years, and the building was restored afterwards. A new restoration was carried out at the end of the 1970s.\n\nIn 1968, Bleak House was established as a youth club in Folkets Hus. A group of young enthusiasts got a lease with the owners and renovated the premises into a disco and concert hall. The house was primarily run as a disco club and was open six days a week. The name was inspired by musician Terje Rypdal’s LP of the same name. Bleak House was in operation until 1982.\n\nThere were trade union premises in Folkets hus from the start until 2007. After the road was rerouted, Folkets hus was squeezed in and in terms of traffic in an unfortunate placement between the road and the railway. The building is proposed to be protected in the new Cultural Heritage Plan which is currently being worked on.\n\nGranheim\n\nLog house, the only property on Mo that is still intact with a so-called town barn and an outhouse (bakery house). The home was moved here from one of the two homesteads on Tverråneset which had to be demolished to make way for the Dunderlandsbanen in 1902. The house was then bought and moved by skipper Aksel Hansen, who was the eldest son of Torstein Hansen, married to midwife Bergithe Hansen. Shortly afterwards he married teacher Nikoline Tanke Hansen.\n\nAfter the move, the property was named Granheim because it was quite alone in the forest (gran meaning spruce tree). The road was called Nordmoveien, during the war the Germans changed the address to Fjordgata 27. After the war, a new town plan was adopted, and Mo got official street addresses, the house then became Lars Meyers gt. 27, later the address was changed to 33.\n\nThe property has three buildings: farmhouse, outbuildings and barn. The farmhouse was brought up by skipper Aksel Hansen, it was built on a gray stone wall, and a food cellar was excavated under the kitchen. Sometime between 1905 and 1910, the house was extended in half-timbered construction to the west. On the roof there was stone cast in Mobekken by mason Ansus from Toraneset, this was later replaced. The facade cladding was changed a few years after the year 2000. There have been two apartments in the house, inhabited by well-known personalities in Mo i Rana, i.a. Dr. Lind, Sverre Meyer, Marie at Telegrafen and pastor Bråthen. The entrance to the second floor is on one of the house’s corners. The outhouse was built at the same time as the farmhouse, and the barn shortly after, hardly later than 1910. In the town barn there were pigs and chickens. Until 2022, the houses were inhabited by Nikoline and Aksel’s grandson, Terje Hansen. The property is (2023) put up for sale. The building is included in Rana municipality’s protection plan from 2002, and protection is proposed to be continued.\n\nThe museum\n\nThe museum was built in 1961 as a museum according to drawings by architect Nils Toft, who was then building manager in Nord-Rana municipality. The building was made of concrete with cast columns, girders and floor dividers, and with facades in sprayed concrete and brick. In terms of style, the building has clear functionalist features with a skeleton of reinforced concrete, horizontal window bands, a flat roof and free, internal floor plans. In 1972, the building was extended with an extension to the north, identical to the first construction stage. In 1989, the building was extended with offices, toilets and a new entrance. This with glass facades – in contrast to the first two building stages. Museumsgården served as a museum building for Rana from 1963 to 2019, when the museum moved into new premises at Moholmen.\n\nMuseumsgården is centrally located in the center of Mo i Rana, in close proximity to the city’s pedestrian street structure, but set back towards Meyerparken. Operated today as a cultural meeting point with a dance studio, stage, bar, cafe and cultural events. The building represents 1950s and 1960s modernism, and both interior and exterior are well looked after. The building is proposed to be protected in the new Cultural Heritage Plan which is currently being worked on.\n\nRana Town Hall\n\nThe town hall complex was built following an open architectural competition in 1964. The buildings consist of a town hall, community center and cinema grouped around a central town hall square. The facility was designed by Telje-Torp-Aasen Arkitektkontor AS (later LMR arkitektur AS). The town hall was built in 1967–1969 as three square office blocks of two, three and five floors, grouped around an internal skylight hall. All facades and internal constructions were made of cast-in-place, untreated concrete with various types of formwork and internal partitions made of Leca sound blocks. Doors and windows were made of varnished wood. The floor in the town hall hall is made of red brick tiles, otherwise parquet is used. Construction cost was NOK 8.4 million. In 1983–84 and 1986–87, the town hall got new windows and an external facade made of ceramic tiles.\n\nCommunity center and cinema/theatre: The municipality’s finances required that the community center and cinema/theatre be divided into two building stages. The two parts of the building form a wall along the main axis of the town hall complex with a common entrance and vestibules and stairs along this axis, and with halls and meeting rooms lying behind. The community center is also made of cast-in-place, untreated concrete with internal cladding of Leca. The facade of the cinema building is covered with bright ceramic tiles. Here, too, the window bars are painted red. Construction cost was NOK 15.5 million. The facility is grouped around a central town hall square. It is proposed to be protected in the new Cultural Heritage Plan, which is currently being worked on.\n\nThe Vika band\n\nThe Vika band is a 2,800 meter long conveyor belt between Koksverkskaia in Guldsmedvika and the Raw Material Warehouse in the industrial park. It is Norway’s longest building. The Vikaband was built and put into operation in 1964, in connection with the start-up of Norsk Koksverk AS, Rana Gruber and expansion with two furnaces at Råjernverket. For 25 years, iron slag, coal and coke were transported to Råjernverket’s raw material warehouse. The conveyor belt is built into a “house” of steel, wood and corrugated iron and runs 5-10 meters above the ground, clearly visible from several main roads in Rana. The band itself is made of rubber and rests on 12,000 rollers, it consists of six parts, and between the parts there are stations with motors that drive the band. In the stations, the belts overlap each other, so that the raw materials fall from one to the other.\n\nThe Vika band was owned by Norsk Jernverk AS until 1989, and then by Mo Industripark AS. Today, Mo Industritransport AS is responsible for the operation, which is now automated and computer controlled. The belt has a capacity of 500 tonnes per hour, depending on the material being transported. Today, it is used for several different types of raw materials for businesses in the industrial park: ore, coal, slag, quartz and coke. The building is included in Rana municipality’s protection plan from 2002, and protection is proposed to be continued.\n\nGulbygget (The yellow building)\n\nAdministration building for AS Norsk Jernverk, which was partially put into use just before the company’s start of operations in April 1955. The yellow building was centrally located with connections to Jernverket’s main gate at Skansen. The building has been extended several times, both to the east and south, where the current facade with a southern wing on four floors facing the city was completed in 1970. A new canteen was placed on the top floor, with a good view of both the city and the works area. The building got a new wing to the south-east in 1994.\n\nAfter the reorganization of Norsk Jernverk AS, Gulbygget was used by several other businesses, both private and public, including NRK Licensing Department, the Labor Market Agency and Billettservice. The building has been modernized and rebuilt several times in recent years."
