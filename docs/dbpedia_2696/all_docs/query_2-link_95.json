        "text": "Commemorating Our Forest Heroes\n\nThe Forest of Dean has seen many people play a huge part in our history, and Foresters’ Forest is recognising some of these local figures with a plaque.\n\nOur Blue & Green Plaque scheme recognises notable historic Foresters who died over 20 years ago, that lived or worked in the Forest and who made an important contribution to the Forest’s natural, built or cultural heritage.\n\nA Blue Plaque is a permanent sign installed in a public place to commemorate a link between that location and a nationally famous person or event.\n\nA Green Plaque is very similar but it commemorates a link between that location and a person famous within the Forest (but not nationally well known).\n\nWe previously received public nominations for the individuals who should be proudly remembered within the Forest in this way, creating a shortlist of 18 nominees. An online public vote then ran throughout July 2020, to identify the 10 historic figures to commemorate with a plaque, displayed within the Forest of Dean.\n\nAll ten plaques are now displayed at their various locations across the Forest. The locations of the plaques are detailed in our website map and in the bios below. To help you find the plaques you can also download this PDF Map, listing the location of each plaque.\n\nOur 10 Plaque Recipients\n\nThe historic Forest heroes being commemorated with a Blue Plaque:\n\nDennis Potter - Dramatist for some of the most popular plays in TV history\n\nDame Muriel Powell - A British nurse ahead of her time\n\nFW Harvey - Innovative poet and broadcaster\n\nDavid & Robert Mushet - The men of iron and steel\n\nJames & William Horlick - Inventors of baby food and malted drink\n\nThose being awarded Green Plaques:\n\nWarren James - Freeminer and champion of Forest customs\n\nDavid Richard Organ - Miner who fought for rights\n\nDr ML Bangara - Well-loved community doctor\n\nSir Francis Brain - Pioneer of electricity in coal mining\n\nTimothy Mountjoy - Pioneer of trade union for miners"
