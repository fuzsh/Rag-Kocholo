        "text": "The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has announced a national blue plaques scheme to celebrate people throughout history who made an important and positive contribution to human welfare or happiness across England.\n\nThe scheme, which will be developed and led by Historic England, will recognise that every place has a unique story to tell, and help to showcase the importance of heritage everywhere.\n\nRecent polling has revealed that 84% of people in England think it is important that people pass on stories of local history1, and place-marking initiatives such as the blue plaques scheme can increase levels of civic pride and positive connections to place2, and encourage a sense of belonging.2,3\n\nThe national blue plaques project recognises the value and success of the London scheme, which will continue to be led by English Heritage, as well as the numerous local schemes across the country. Historic England will work together with English Heritage, local partners, and current plaque schemes as the national programme is developed and rolled out.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
