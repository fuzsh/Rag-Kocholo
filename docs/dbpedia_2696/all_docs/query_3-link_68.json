        "text": "Yesterday, one of our founders, Irene Barclay was celebrated with a Blue Plaque from English Heritage. Irene Barclay became the first qualified woman Chartered Surveyor in 1922.\n\nIrene always demonstrated a people-first approach \"‘There will always be problems because we are dealing with people, not things, and the art of housing management is in tackling problems, and solving some of them’’ Irene Barclay, People Need Roots, published 1976.\n\nIrene's grandson, Benedict Barclay unveils the plaque on a rainy Wednesday."
