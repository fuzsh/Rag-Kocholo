Blue plaques are also placed by Chesterfield Borough Council and Derbyshire County Council (but are not part of the civic society’s scheme).\n\nThis map shows the location of all those in our area. Click on any of the points on the map for more information.\n\nSince this map was created the following blue plaques have been added:\n\nSt Helena girls’ high school, Sheffield Road – click here for more information.\n\nThe Winding Wheel, Holywell Street – click here for further information.\n\nRose Hill United Reformed Church – click here for further information.\n\nChesterfield Football Club – click here for further information.\n\nPortland Hotel and Market Place railway station – click here for further information.\n\nPage last updated 9 August 2024."
