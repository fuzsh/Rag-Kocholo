        "text": "LONDON: A home in west London where Diana lived before she became Princess of Wales was honoured with a Blue Plaque on Wednesday in memory of her life there.\n\n\"Diana moved into Coleherne Court in July 1979 and was living here when she first began her courtship with the Prince of Wales. It is fitting that our blue plaque remembers her at this place where her life in the public eye first began,\" said Anna Eavis, Curatorial Director at English Heritage.\n\n\"Diana was one of the world's most famous women and she used her fame and influence to raise awareness of issues such as homelessness and landmines. She played a critically important role in helping to de-stigmatise illnesses such as HIV, leprosy and depression,\" she said.\n\n\"Those were happy days for all of us and the flat was always full of laughter. Diana went off to become so much to so many. It's wonderful that her legacy will be remembered in this way,\" said Clarke.\n\nDiana herself described her time at Coleherne Court as one of the happiest of her life and it was from this flat that she took her first steps onto the world stage.\n\nShe remained at Coleherne Court until the night before her engagement to Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, was announced on 23 February 1981, following which she stayed briefly at Clarence House before moving to a suite in Buckingham Palace.\n\nAccording to Andrew Morton's biography, Diana would later describe her 18 months at the flat as the happiest time of her life: \"It was nice being in a flat with the girls. I loved that -- it was great. I laughed my head off there. I kept myself to myself. I wasn't interested in having a full diary. I loved being on my own, as I do now -- a great treat.\"\n\nHe proposed to her on 6 February 1981 to the great excitement of her flatmates, Virginia Pitman, Carolyn Pride and Anne Bolton, with Diana remembering: \"Everybody screamed and howled and we went for a drive around London with our secret.\"\n\nFor a time, this made the block of flats among the most famous addresses in Britain, with photographers lying in wait to photograph her on her way in or out of the building, or through her bedroom window via a vantage point in Brompton Library opposite.\n\nThe Blue Plaque at the address follows a drive to recognise more women under the scheme, with the former London home of Britain's Indian-origin World War II spy Noor Inayat Khan among those recognised last year.\n\n\"We understand why many thought the work of Diana, Princess of Wales should be recognised -- her landmine campaign and HIV/AIDS awareness work was truly global and made an enormous difference to many lives. Diana had, and still has, a very special place in the hearts of Londoners and we are thrilled to see her blue plaque formally placed as a monument to her work for others,\" he said."
