        "text": "On Tuesday 21st June 2016 the Lord Lieutenant of Dorset Angus Campbell Esq unveiled a blue plaque on The George Inn, Custom House Quay, Weymouth, Dorset to mark 350 years of the bequest of Sir Samuel Mico to the people of Weymouth & Portland.\n\nSir Samuel Mico was a London merchant, master of the mercers company and traded from Weymouth. In 1640 he was listed as one of the wealthiest people in London. It is even believed that Mico received his Knighthood for helping the king of the time Charles II, pay of his significant debts.\n\nWhen in Weymouth, Mico lived at his property on the quay known as The George Tavern, or Inn.\n\nWhen he died in 1666, he left The George Inn the income from which together with investment income from a sum of money he also left, to pay pensions to decayed seamen and to fit out three apprentices. Some 350 years later the trust still supports local young people, with scholarships, apprenticeships, expeditions, sports development, university study and all sorts of other things.\n\nLocal dignitaries gathered to hear speeches by The Lord Lieutenant, trust chairman Gary Hepburn and the Mayor of Weymouth & Portland.\n\nGary Hepburn Chairman of Weymouth Town Charities that administers the Sir Samuel Mico Charity, said “ We are absolutely thrilled to be installing the blue plaque on The George today, marking the the bequest of Sir Samuel Mico and showing local people and tourists alike, where he lived. I am sure Mico himself would never have imaged that he would still be helping any people 350 years later, let alone the significantly increased numbers the trust is able to help today. It is very fitting to honour Mico in this way as he has helped many thousands of local young people with their education and development.”"
