        "text": "Topline\n\nDiana, Princess of Wales, is set to be honored with a commemorative blue plaque this year—a scheme that marks where notable individuals lived or worked in the capital—historic preservation charity English Heritage announced, which will be placed on an undisclosed building associated with her life before her marriage to Prince Charles.\n\nKey Facts\n\nCrucial Quote\n\nThe first of English Heritage’s blue plaques went up over 150 years ago in honor of the poet Lord Byron. The recognizable blue dots are intended to celebrate “the relationship between people and place” and are now only awarded to recipients who have died at least 20 years ago where a building closely tied to them remains. The scheme relies on nominations from the public and there is a substantial gender imbalance among honorees. Eavis has said this is due to the “historic blindness” towards the roles women play in society and only 14% of the more than 950 plaques in the capital recognize women. The six additions are a part of the group’s “plaques for women” campaign, launched five years ago. Eavis said: “We still have a long way to go to address the gender imbalance that has ensued since the first blue plaque went up over 150 years ago but with the help of many excellent nominations from the British public, we are headed in the right direction.”\n\nKey Background\n\nThe plaque will mark what would have been Princess Diana’s 60th birthday. Diana’s sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, are reportedly set to unveil a statue honoring their mother in Kensington Palace this summer. The Royal household has drifted apart in recent years, with divides deepening following the departure of Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. Harry and Meghan said they will not be returning as working members of the Royal Family in February and made shocking allegations of mistreatment and racism in a bombshell interview with Oprah.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nBlue plaque planned to commemorate Diana, Princess of Wales (BBC)\n\nHarry And Meghan Will Not Return As Working Members Of Britain’s Royal Family (Forbes)"
