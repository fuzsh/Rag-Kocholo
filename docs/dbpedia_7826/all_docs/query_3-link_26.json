24 March 2000), born Lawrence John Gabriel Bridges, was a South African singer. He became known as Bles Bridges, as his Irish grandfather called him \"Bles\" (meaning \"bald\" in Afrikaans), due to his very thin hair from an early age. He released his first solo album in 1982, Onbekende Weermagman (Unknown Soldier). His professional career began in 1984, with the release of his second album, Bles, which went gold in under a month (25,000 copies) and included Maggie, one of his better-known songs. The album had sold twice that by the time his third album was released. At the time of his death, Bles had sold more than 2.6 million albums (records and CDs). Up to 2016, he sold over 3 million records, making him the biggest selling male singer in the Afrikaans Music industry. Soon Bles Bridges began alternating between Afrikaans and English language albums, to great acclaim. He also began working with Eurovision South Africa. In 2000, he began recording an album with his friends in the music industry. The first song - a duet with Patricia Lewis (and his last song as it turned out, as he died within a week of finishing it) - was \"The First Kiss Goodnight\" by Dennis East; it was recorded on 21 March 2000. His biggest hit was \"Ruiter van die Windjie\" (Rider of the Wind), which was released in 1986. In the 1980s, he held a concert in support of the Volkshulpskema (People's Help Scheme) of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, a far right paramilitary organisation, which raised R10,000. He had cancer during the 1980s and gave generously to charity for cancer research after his recovery. His wife Leonie was his sound engineer and the composer and/or songwriter of most of his songs, including most of his biggest hits, including \"Maggie\" and \"I am the Eagle, you're the Wind\", among others. It was his custom to hand out roses to some of the female audience members in the front row at his concerts.. This was also the basis for a Leon Schuster skit, in the hit movie, Oh Schucks..... It's Schuster! (1989). In the skit, Shuster, dressed as an Afrikaner lady, became irate when Bridges refused to give her a rose. Chaos ensued. His career highlight was when he performed to a soldout 8,000-seater Superbowl at Sun City, five times on one weekend, becoming the first and only artist to do so, as feature artist on 14 and 15 November 1987. He actually managed to draw a bigger crowd than Frank Sinatra did when he opened the Super Bowl in 1982. Bles died in a motorcar accident on 24 March 2000, leaving behind his wife, Leonie, and children Sunette and Victor. More than 20,000 mourners turned up for his funeral.
