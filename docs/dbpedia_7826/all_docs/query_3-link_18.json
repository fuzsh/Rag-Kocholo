        "text": "Bankable Art\n\nI had forgotten that Brett Murray used to have a sense of humour. Perhaps he never lost it; maybe we did. Standing in front of Murray’s 2002 work I must Learn to speak Xhosa brings to mind his sharp brand of satire, the laughter his approach once provoked. It’s a painted metal sculpture depicting an old (white) man kneeling in front of a bed, praying. The title of the work appears in a speech bubble below.\n\nThe work marks a time when Murray was still mocking the old guard and, in the context of the Art of Banking: Celebrating through Collections, it is used to visually map the mood of the 1990s, a time when white people presumably became acutely aware of the errors of their position, or at least felt their vulnerability in the face of an about-turn in the political and social status quo. Norman Catherine’s Endangered Species, a 2001 work consisting of a wooden cabinet populated by hybrid figures and objects, such as a bottle of “stay alive pills”, is also co-opted in service of articulating this sentiment.\n\nIt’s a curious process; using works from one time frame to illustrate another period. But largely this is how this exhibition has been constructed by Barbara Freemantle of the Standard Bank Gallery. The show isn’t simply an exercise in showing off works from this institution’s substantial art collection but, in celebration of its 150th anniversary, the works have been used to gloss over the country’s history from the 1860s. Given this fairly unexciting objective, I expected a dry, if not dull exhibition. This jumbling of time frames has certainly allowed Freemantle to animate this history in a different way; the contemporary works that illustrate this period simultaneously undermine or question some of the events that have been selected to define it. This engenders a sort of parallel story or powerful subtext.\n\nBut this modus operandi presents problems, too. For example, it allows a kind of hindsight that was not available at the time of these events. Murray and Catherine’s works were made almost a decade after the time frame that they are meant to capture, so can they really relate to prevailing sentiments in the 1990s? This kind of fast-forwarding to future conditions or mindsets makes the artworks operate as a screen that projects a more politically correct reality, though many are juxtaposed with works from the actual era they are meant to depict. Murray and Catherine’s works are shown near Penny Siopis’s diptych Always Something New out of Africa, made in 1990. Contrasting with their works, the latter suggests it may have been a time when white artists identified with the political struggle. In the late 1990s, when the so-called Grey Areas debate dominated local discourse on art, Siopis was criticised for her level of identification with black subjects and/or representation thereof.\n\nAlways Something New out of Africa presents a naked black woman holding a sheet to her body; she appears like an artists’ model. Behind her are densely packed drawings of violent battles – presumably the country’s history. The white sheet, which can also function as an artists’ canvas, opens space between the present and the past and mediates it in different ways. The painting also deals with violence to the female body and other gendered debates, but, in the context of this exhibition, it articulates art’s relationship to history. Unwittingly it also brings to mind how art can be used as a tool of misdirection – this can have both positive and negative ramifications.\n\nThe chronological narrative of this exhibition does pivot on the art, rather than history. An Irma Stern still life, Gardenias (1940), for example, doesn’t link up with any important event, other than itself and the fact that it is part of the Standard Bank collection. It’s not an insignificant collection; it consists of works by the who’s who of bankable artists from Gerard Sekoto to Sam Nhlengethwa, William Kentridge, David Goldblatt, Wim Botha and Marcus Neustetter. The list goes on and on. We have seen the French masters (in the last exhibition), now it’s time to roll out local 'masters'.\n\nArtworks are historical documents of a different kind; they are not factual and are more vulnerable to new readings because of their ambiguity. Natasha Christopher’s Limn (2007) is used to depict the establishment of Joburg. It is the composition of a confluence of natural and unnatural elements at the centre of the photograph that facilitates this reading, though it is such an arbitrary moment and setting. In a way this work is about attaching significance to the ordinary, though it is a formal celebration of things that lack monumentality.\n\nThe juxtaposition between painting and photography vis-à-vis their varying approaches to depicting the landscape dominate this show. It serves to contrast how historical idealistic notions of the land contrast with the dystopian view embraced now by the likes of Guy Tillim and Goldblatt. With its luscious pink and green brush strokes, Edward Wolfe’s Struben’s Farm (1956) is in stark contrast to the dry barren landscape in Tillim’s Stanley’s Stoep (2003).\n\nTownship scenes are another recurring motif. David Mogano’s Alexandra Fire (1998), Durant Sihlali’s Kliptown Floods (1977) and Sam Nhlengethwa’s remarkable work, Baragwanath Bridge (2006) all present views of these settings from street level and are offered as defining signatures of the 1940s and the 1950s. Sihlali’s acrylic work is more satisfying than his watercolours; it’s a treat to be able to compare it to his 1991 rendition of Freedom Square, Kliptown, and view the shifting politics underlying the difference in how they have been rendered. The 1970s work was all about recording the weight of the dire living conditions.\n\nNhlengethwa’s photographic composite of the Sowetan landmark is a constructed truth, displaying the iconic aspects of the place in such a way that it seems whole, capturing the larger-than- life details of the place, yet, at the same time, speaking of fragmentation. This work is used to evoke the 1940s, though Nhlengethwa fast-forwards us to the recent present. In this way, Soweto’s history is overwritten, evoking a sense of denial and triumph – history has been transcended.\n\nThis overlayering of time produces interesting ironies, as with Diane Victor’s Monument II, which shows a destroyed monument, in the time frame when the Voortrekker monument was built. It’s as if the regime it memorialises, was instilled with the seed of its decay from the outset.\n\nThe pointed recontextualisations of artworks in this exhibition can be quite simplistic, glib and incongruent, like two works by the Essop brothers that are meant to tie in with the Arab Spring.\n\nJohannes Phokela’s The Bean Feast (undated) is detached from its post-colonial thrust, coming to signify the rise of conspicuous consumerism thought to have been the driver behind the recent economic crisis in Europe and the US. This new twist works; this traditional painted tableaux depicting a group of people caught up in an orgy of food and drink shows how Western greed has caused its own implosion, but would Phokela be thrilled with this new reading?\n\nUltimately, this exhibition inserts some great artworks back into our consciousness, and into new sets of discussions that the artists could not have predicted. - published in The Sunday Independent, October 28, 2012.

The tower was conceived around 1919 by the Russian artist and architect, and it is easy to see why Hobbs is fixated with its design. It was a grand scheme in every way; not only did Tatlin set out to create a building that would rival the Eiffel Tower, but it was conceived as an information and propaganda hub for the communist state – it was architecture about and in the service of an ideology. Tatlin had even planned for a projector to be located in its upper reaches so that messages could be cast on passing clouds.\n\nThe scheme itself turned out to be pie in the sky. Small models of the building were completed, but it was never built. Interestingly, it is this fact that titillates Hobbs, beyond its symbolism as a utopian project for social change. It feeds his fascination for architecture that has never been realised – can never be realised. It’s an unusual preoccupation, if not one that seems in contradiction with the objective of this discipline. There is a kind of poeticism to unrealised potential that has captured his interest, one no doubt fuelled by his own unrealised imaginings, or the limits of reality, particularly for an artist interested in urban space.\n\nTatlin’s unrealised building has become as iconic, certainly in artistic and architectural circles, as the Eiffel, to which it bears a strange resemblance; it’s like a twisted, contorted version of it. Many have argued that Anish Kapoor’s Orbit sculpture for the Olympic Park in London bears some resemblance to Tatlin’s tower.\n\nOver the years Hobbs has been replicating this constructivist design in models and paintings – as in The End of Cities, shown at the Blank Gallery in 2009 – but his latest rendition of Tatlin’s model, now on show at an exhibition dubbed Dazzle Plans, presents another step in his long-standing relationship with this famously unconceived building.\n\nHobbs suggests that it is his cleanest, sharpest model yet. This is facilitated by the 3D-style printing that Brendan Copestake offers at Parts and Labour, the design studio-cum-project gallery space where Dazzle Plans is being staged. It’s a small exhibition, presenting a mixture of models using the 3D printing technology, previous works that bear relationship to them, and Hobbs’s own tentative sketches and collages.\n\nSome of these ideas will manifest in a solo exhibition planned for Stellenbosch University early next year, but others, like Tatlin’s tower, will for ever remain unrealised. It’s not simply a way of avoiding failure or disappointment, but of preserving an inchoate idea at its height of potential.\n\nHobbs’s new model of the Tatlin tower may be the slickest he has made, but this is not what is interesting about it. It’s the scale. It is tiny – perhaps 15cm in height. In this way, Hobbs moves it even further from being or appearing as an actual building, or even an architect’s model. It’s like a plaything, maybe even a tourist souvenir like those tiny Eiffel Towers hanging from key chains that are for sale along the Champs élysées. In other words, it could be read as a response to the ubiquity, fixation with this iconic structure that never got a chance to become a landmark building.\n\nIn a way it didn’t need to become a landmark. It functions as one nonetheless, albeit that it is|detached from a physical setting. It’s a kind of imaginary nomadic building that keeps popping up in unexpected places, as at Parts and Labour, at Arts on Main. Hobbs’s obsession with reproducing the model, a model of a model, speaks of a drive to reach an unattainable ideal but also one to unravel its latent potential. What would the perfect model of Tatlin’s tower be, given it has not existed, but also what could it become?\n\nThe second striking aspect of this model is the large stylised cloud suspended above it. It is obviously in reference to the plan to project and disseminate messages to the masses from inside the tower. Hobbs has also covered the cloud in a “razzle dazzle” pattern, a monochromatic pattern conceived for warships as a mode of camouflage; its obscured hard edges thus thwarting efforts to direct an attack. Here the razzle dazzle pattern allows him to work at erasing the boundaries of the hard material from which the cloud is made. It’s a tool of invisibility. In a way Hobbs has reversed the relationship/contrast between the tower and the cloud; the cloud is indirectly treated as if it has form, while the diminutive tower is less tangible but, ultimately, his intention is to reveal the cloud as another unrealised part of the tower, as an architectural extension that purely embodies ephemerality.\n\nBronwyn Lace is similarly fixated with the ephemeral. Her concern is perhaps the grandest of all; to grasp the mysteries of life/death. Religion and science are usually relied upon to explain seemingly inexplicable natural forces, but Lace doesn’t seem interested in teasing out the politics of these opposing epistemologies, though she does indirectly make reference to them.\n\nHer aim is to give visual expression to phenomena we cannot perceive with the naked eye. A series of blind embossings of dead insects evokes historical collections of butterflies pinned behind glass casings that served to catalogue nature, though ironically in doing so the insect had to die. But in these blank traces of small bodies left on the paper we can perceive not only the absence of life – the absence of a body – but also the trace it leaves. This engenders the notion that somehow Lace has, through this invisible imprint, captured the essence of life - this unseen quantity.\n\nGod’s Finger, a circular column of fish-gut lines suspended from a window to the floor, similarly gives expression to an invisible force. It is not so much the particles in the light that are evoked through the coloured glass pieces suspended along the lines – as the title implies, it is the life force itself, the act of creation, an unseen presence, deity perhaps, that is made visible.\n\nIt helps that Lace’s medium, the translucent wire, is invisible. Of course, the colourful glass shards also summon an atomized stained glass window common to church design, where God’s presence is perceived through coloured light reflecting into the building.\n\nThere is something quite grand and awe-inspiring about this installation. This works for the work, and against it; it reinscribes the mystery. Lace is simply (re) visualising the enigmatic without disturbing its enigma. As a result, the installation feels superficial, a mere aestheticisation of the unknown. It can’t offer us any concrete evidence, knowledge, because their isn’t anything substantial that is available. - published November 18, 2012, The Sunday Independent.\n\nDazzle Plans is showing at Parts and Labour, Arts on Main, until December 9. Lace’s exhibition, A Tendency Towards Complexity, is showing at CIRCA on Jellicoe until December 3\n\n↧\n\nRebel without a Cause: Christian Nerf\n\nWhen you send Christian Nerf an e-mail these days you get an immediate response, informing you that he is “itinerant”. In other words; don’t expect a speedy response. Nerf makes a good nomad. To all intents and purposes he has been living “off the grid”, as the expression goes, for some time. That catchphrase is often used to describe militant eco-conscious folk who refuse to buy into any established systems they perceive as damaging, to live independently off conventional systems, but it seems appropriate for Nerf’s lifestyle and approach. Periodically, he is content to live without a home. Doesn’t sell his time to anyone. Well, almost – his cigarette addiction might be one of the few reasons he exchanges money. And he is a reluctant artist.\n\n“I am pleased there is a category called art that allows for people like me to exist and function,” he observes coolly.\n\nHis “off the grid” – or could it be “between grids”? – approach makes him a bit of an anarchist and, also, ironically, an artist: the good ones are always fighting against the narrow confines of what the label designates. Almost in honour of this contradiction, he is wearing an apron covered in paint when I find him inside Room, a slip of a gallery at 70 Juta in Braamfontein run by Maria Fidel Regueros.\n\nThe apron isn’t his. I gather he hasn’t painted in some time. When he dropped out of Wits Technikon art school in the late Eighties – surely the beginning of his “off the grid” stance – to pursue painting, it took him two months to discover that, despite his proficiency, he had nothing to paint.\n\n“I needed life experience.”\n\nA career in advertising taught him about the life he didn’t want to lead. Art school taught him that what he deemed art might not be what everyone else did. This realisation might have initially turned him away from art, propelling him into the world of advertising, but it has similarly brought him back into the fold – he likes to rub up against expectations.\n\nThe paint-splattered artist’s apron is part of a scheme to appear as a conventional artist in the makeshift studio he has established inside Room. The gallery has become the studio, collapsing process and product and avoiding this sense he has that art is “emasculated” when it moves from the studio to the gallery. In a way his Room installation, called Et Al, Et Cetera, is also a performance piece, a bit of theatre, reality theatre.\n\nNerf is playing an artist who resists being an artist, though this is his genuine stance. The artist uniform might be contrived but the studio he has constructed is real; all the bits and pieces – the maquettes of some of his grand schemes for public sculptures – I have seen in his Cape Town studio are here. This is the thing about his practice; as contrived – and slightly absurd – as some of his acts appear, they are all derived from a genuine place.\n\nTake his recent work, dubbed Nog ’n Piep, in which he “collaborated” with three of his deceased friends – Sebastian Charilaou, Crispian Plunkett and Ricardo de Carvalho – during a residency at the Sober & Lonely Institute for Contemporary Art in Joburg. The premise for the work was farcical, but it was grounded in a very real interest.\n\n“We all have to start dealing with death. I don’t subscribe to the belief that there is life after death, so it was an opportunity for myself to explore their [my dead friends] continued existence, and how it is caused by our memories. I was trying to find out what were the key things that made them make me what I am.\n\n“It wasn’t easy even to gather the thoughts around doing this, it is something I have been avoiding. I want to re-understand what it is like to work with others. It was interesting to open myself up to that and be in their presence for a whole week.”\n\nThere was an elegiac undertone to some of the acts, which were a repetition of ones he had performed with other people before – such as drawing with Jared Ginsburg – but was now forced to perform solo. In this way he reflected on what it was like to carry on “collaborating” with someone who was no longer present, as well as the nature of collaboration – does it demand a physical presence?\n\nWhile the prospect of setting out to work with people who were dead seemed preposterous, flippant and humorous, it carried a certain gravitas. Nerf sums this up as “doing stupid things with a straight face”. What also particularly appealed to him about this project was the futility of it. “I like to pursue things that are pointless.”\n\nThis ties in with his “off-the-grid” ethos, though he would never declare it as such; he doesn’t follow a single guiding philosophy. Superficially, at least, his performance work evinces an interest in disrupting the spectator’s programmed responses. This aspect is most likely an inverted application of the skills he developed in advertising; a form of manipulation directed at deprogramming the audience, destabilising expectations and waking them up from a kind of stupor – he is frustrated by the sheep mentality that pervades society. In fact, he takes delight in pushing his audience to the point where they walk out of his performances, challenging the limits of civility.\n\nNerf’s Believe you Me (also titled If Only Art Was A Four Letter Word) will premiere at Gipca’s (Gordon Institute of Performing Arts) inaugural Live Art Festival, which seems the ideal setting for his work, his resistance to fitting neatly into any box. Conceived by Jay Pather, the festival is pioneering a platform for performance that resists classification; theatre that is not quite theatre, art that shares links with dance.\n\nNerf’s piece is geared to shift audience expectations. “I want to talk about issues of truth, disinformation and information and how prejudice leads us to believe what we are going to get. I really want to set up scenarios to trust the audience and then shake-up a few things that they thought about art.\n\n“And if some of them have seen what I have being doing all these years and have faith in me, I want to break that down. And for people that think I am an absurdist just because I don’t use the logic of the day, I will use systems that exist. Once there has been some confusion and laughter things will start happening,” he says with a grin.\n\nNerf has premeditated the performance to a certain degree, but likes to leave it largely unplanned.\n\n“I don’t want to take a pre-organised experiment and coldly deliver it to other people, what are you getting out of it? I want to be part of the people that learn something.”\n\nFor this reason Nerf is hoping that what he hasn’t planned,\n\ndoesn’t go according to plan.\n\n“I like the idea of having to watch the footage afterwards to see what the fuck was going on.”\n\nGipca’s Live Art Festival runs from November 30 to December 4 in Cape Town. Nerf’s Believe You Me will be staged in the Cape Town City Hall on December 2. Athi Patra Ruga, Boris Nitikin, Michael McGarry, Richard Antrobus, Nelisiwe Xaba and Murray Kruger are some of the artists performing during this extensive festival.

East Rand Proprietary Mines South East Vertical (SEV) shaft in Boksburg has been closed since 2005, but there are a few guards stationed at the entrance who aren’t keen to let us in. It’s not the buried wealth underground that needs protecting, or even the dilapidated structures above ground, it is simply a knee-jerk reaction; this compulsion to conceal its business from the prying eyes of strangers. After 15 minutes of patient negotiations, Petersen returns to the car and parks it under a large tree overhanging the driveway. We must wait for a more senior security manager to allow us entry into the mine’s premises. A group of men are tending to the manicured gardens leading up to the entrance.\n\nThere seems little reason now to maintain appearances; the only visitors are unwanted. They are mostly scavengers that enter under the dark cloak of night to steal cables. And then, there is Petersen, a former photojournalist who has made a habit of roaming around these abandoned institutions with a camera attached to his eye. This is his third or fourth visit to SEV, but he sees new things here all the time; because the imposing shaft building and all the dilapidated machinery and empty buildings are caught in an aggressive state of entropy, their exteriors are constantly changing. Nothing remains stagnant, not even a decommisioned mine.\n\nThere are all sorts of logical explanations for Petersen’s fixation with these edifices – it is the buildings, the discarded machinery that capture his interest. It might have something to do with growing up on the East Rand, Springs, in-between two mines. The imposing architecture of the shafthead frame is imprinted on his consciousness as in much the same way as the blue of a highveld sky. So, perhaps it was always written in the stars that he would one day want to survey the activities connected to this enduring motif, untangling the mystery that they weaved into his childhood dreams.\n\nThere are few Joburg-based photographers or artists who have not sought to represent the mines at some time in their career. Everyone from William Kentridge to Sam Nhlengethwa, to Natasha Christopher have grappled with this phenomenon. Currently, an exhibition of the images from David Goldblatt’s seminal photographic essay On the Mines, are being exhibited alongside Alfredo Jaar’s lightbox images of an opencast mine in north-eastern Brazil at the Goodman Gallery in Joburg.\n\nThis exhibition had been planned for some time, to coincide with the publication of a new edition of the acclaimed 1973 book by Goldblatt, but it fortuitously tied in with the renewed interest in the politics attached to the mining industry that the Marikana massacre generated. Of course, as the industry accounts for the rise of Joburg, the city’s identity is tied to it, but it has also provided the stage for prevailing power relations to be enacted.\n\nThe tragic events at Marikana brought this sharply into relief, evoking the twisted relations between the miners, unions, Lonmin, the police and the state itself. So, in a way the conditions around mining and the nature of the relationships it produces, has become a touchstone for the state of our nation. For Kentridge, particularly in his charcoal animations, the deep penetration the shafthead frame facilitates operates as a metaphor, for not only the imperial gaze but greedy exploitation. There is a sense that once this grand machine is set in motion and the pattern of exploitation is set, it cannot be stopped.\n\n“Through these gates walk the safest men and women in the industry,” reads a sign at the entrance of SEV.\n\nThe mining industry isn’t unaware of how it is perceived. The manicured gardens and the suggestion box near the entrance are some of the small gestures towards deflecting negative perceptions. When we are finally given the go-ahead to enter the SEV premises, Petersen makes a beeline for the shafthead frame.\n\nThree security guards trail us and watch us from a distance, perplexed as a speechless Petersen approaches his muse. It’s easy to see why this complex erection with an intricate interlacing of steel constructions interests him. In a way it looks like the spine or skeleton of a building that has yet to be completed. There are no superfluous decorative elements to it; everything is functional.\n\nIt brings to mind one of Goldblatt’s photographs of a makeshift wooden chair for the use of a barber, who presumably visited from time to time to provide haircuts for the miners. The photograph was taken in 1965 outside a compound on the Luipaardsvlei Estates, Krugersdorp. It’s not a sturdy structure; a lopsided bench is pressed up against a flat pole. It’s the crudeness of it that resonates with the architecture of the shafthead frame, and, much of the other structures at the mine. It is as if all civility, all niceties and small comforts, have been stripped away.\n\nSo perhaps it is no wonder that this industry above all others is associated with exploitation; there is a sense here that the architecture, the design, has facilitated a form of dehumanisation. Or perhaps we read this industrial architecture through the lens of the history and politics attached to this industry?\n\nWandering around an abandoned mine forces an intimate relationship with the architecture. This might have been what appealed to Goldblatt in the mid-1960s when he began shooting – also choosing vacant spaces. The diverse edifices attached to mines speak in ways that subjects can’t; you also aren’t forced into the uncomfortable position of summoning a fleeting form of empathy.\n\nIt isn’t just the crude structures, summoning the dehumanising culture that mining has perpetuated, that are important, but even the ornate ones that exude the imbalance of power, such as Goldblatt’s 1965 image of a pretty Victorian house belonging to a general manager in New Kleinfontein, Benoni.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the 1965 image of the remains of a miner’s bunk at New State Mines, near Springs. One of the exterior walls of the structure has fallen down, allowing light into what must have been a dark hovel but for the colourful pin ups that decorate a wall. The miners’ hostels and other staff quarters are no longer standing at SEV. They were demolished some time ago and the land was sold, erasing the stories, the history tied to them.\n\nSEV was established in the late 1800s, now it is embedded in a suburb of Boksburg: you approach the mine via quiet suburban streets that once belied the hard graft being carried out at subterranean levels.\n\n“Some mines are slowly taken apart, when I return to them they have changed, there is less and less to see,” observes Petersen as we walk through the detritus of buildings, cracked glass and broken bricks that litter the ground. We are crushing what’s left under our feet.\n\nIt’s not just the gradual degradation that keeps the 50-something photographer making repeat trips to the mines but the actuality that what’s left of them will be destroyed completely. Part of his mission is to document these places before they disappear. In the five-odd years that he has been pursuing this offbeat passion, he has observed how this industry has shrunk.\n\n“When I started there were mines that had 16 working shafts, now they only have eight left. The business is slowing down, it feels like a dying culture.”\n\nFor this reason he also photographs shafts that are still in operation – his aim is to record every mine in South Africa. He photographed the Aurora mine just weeks after its workers were told to leave; in one photograph, dubbed Unfashionable, miners’ clothing is suspended in baskets from the ceiling in the change house. It’s as if their absence is temporary and their return imminent.\n\nPhotographing disused shafts appeals to him the most; it’s the aesthetics of degeneration that seem to appeal to him. We enter a building without a roof, the paint on the walls has almost completely been eroded by the elements. There are still shards of glass held into the window frames. Petersen stops to shoot the shafthead frame through a shattered window. Immersed in this setting it’s hard to believe that this place once generated wealth and power. This is perhaps what keeps Petersen returning; the sense of disbelief and, paradoxically, relief that this notion engenders – this place has been divested of its influence.\n\nIt is in the tranquil engine or winding room that the arrest of power is most palatable. This is where large circular electric winding drums are located. The hoisting or winding ropes that allow the cage or kibble to descend or rise into or out of the shaft are coiled around these drums, so, in a way this is the heart of the action. Some time ago, that is. The concrete floor is almost completely covered in a fine layer of bird faeces and feathers. It is ironic that this bastion of industrial power has fallen into the clutches of pigeons.\n\n“I see this everywhere I go. The pigeons get into all these buildings at some stage,” observes Petersen, before he moves off quickly – the winding room is his favourite area of the mine. He disappears into a small office located above a large drum. A door creaks closed, I see a flash go off. Chipped wooden boards bearing safety instructions and shift times and duties are still pinned to the walls. Traces of human activity are everywhere.\n\nJaar is fixated with (the cost of) human struggle in his study of the Serra Pelada, an opencast mine in a remote part of north-eastern Brazil. There are no machines enabling this mining, just the human body toiling in the earth, fighting against nature in the raw pursuit of survival. The miners don’t wear any protective gear and are covered in a film of mud that lends a shimmer to their skin, making them appear uniform and animal-like.\n\nThey bring to mind the Orcs, a race of sentient slaves toiling in the dark depths of Middle Earth, as depicted in Peter Jackson’s filmic rendition of JRR Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings. Jaar doesn’t isolate individuals, the miners are anonymous, appearing en masse.\n\nSo, in a way he doesn’t aim to give them expression through his photography; redeem their status as individuals. He is interested in them as part of a phenomenon and because of this the display of the photographs – in the lightbox – is important as were the sites of display in New York’s subway where the images were initially installed when they were shown in the late eighties.\n\nJaar was looking to draw attention to the exploitation of Third World workers for the benefit of First World citizens as facilitated by a neo-liberal capitalist economy. The scenes he presents seem so extreme they appear contrived; like the dystopian fantasy world of Tolkien’s imagination.\n\nLike Goldblatt, Jaar intended to expose human suffering by offering evidence of the reality of the conditions.\n\nGoldblatt took a less sensationalist route; though he, too, documents the actual labour with a series of images shot underground. They are blurred and grainy as if the heat and condensation in the air has permeated, warped the film. However, it is a photograph of thousands of shovels retrieved from underground in a salvage yard in Randfontein estates in 1965 that subtly and powerfully evokes human struggle.\n\nMiners trapped underground brought Petersen to various mine shafts during the time he worked as a journalist – first for The Citizen, then Beeld. He was confined to makeshift press rooms during those occasions and saw little of the premises. It was only after a long break from photojournalism that his interest had a chance to develop and blossom, and he began to hunt down decommisioned mines using Google Earth.\n\nPetersen is hoping to transition into the art world with his photographs, though there is something quite mechanical and journalistic about them. The subject matter might make them sufficiently attractive to gallerists and buyers. These images are his gold; like a miner, he, too, has been retrieving them from the murky depths of forgotten places.\n\nHe has been sitting on them for some time, only choosing to show them for the first time at the Joburg Fringe during the Joburg Art Fair. The Marikana massacre has added relevancy to his work, while in turn, in documenting the gradual shrinking of the industry, he indirectly evinces the reasons that the fight to maintain it might become dirtier.\n\nThousands of miners lost their jobs when SEV closed. Presently, it employs only a handful of security guards, who shadow us back to the car.- published in The Sunday Independent, December 04, 2012\n\nl On The Mines and Gold in the Morning are showing at the Goodman Gallery until December 14.

A large crowd gathered in front of the building before the blinds were raised, revealing not one, but two performers. Which one was Ruga?\n\nRuga and Jade Paton’s upper bodies are hidden behind a plethora of balloons holding luminous liquid. Legs concealed in fishnet stockings and ending in pairs of matching red satin high-heels support these bulbous entities, which don’t look too dissimilar from a bunch of grapes. A neon light at the base of the window brings all the neon shades in their costumes, and in the images pinned to the walls in the room, into sharp relief.\n\nIt is like a scene from Amsterdam’s red light district, but for the fact that not a single inch of their bodies is on display and they are not stereotypical female personas, but The Future White Women of Azania – an unknown population still in the making. They appear like mannequins, too, though they totter from side to side, like inebriated whores, struggling to remain inert as their heels slide on the neon liquid released from the balloons as they pop.It is a gradual “striptease”, each burst balloon promising to bring us closer to the identities concealed behind the wall of bright plastic.\n\n“This is boring,” declares the opinionated little girl. The balloons aren’t popping fast enough to hold her fickle attention. We’ve learnt to be patient. Performance art isn’t only a test of physical endurance for the performers but for the audience too. We expect to be bored at times. We need to feel trapped in the present in order to grasp its presentness, the weight of it. After all, some define performance art as “life itself, it doesn’t represent or portray”, or so reads a blurb touted by the organisers of the inaugural Venice International Performance Art Week that takes place in December.\n\nPerformance art is also finding new platforms in South Africa – mostly due to the efforts of one individual, Jay Pather, who has used his clout to help establish a division for this discipline at the National Arts Festival, a Standard Bank Award for a young artist achieving in this area – Anthea Moys was its inaugural recipient – and is responsible for initiating the Live Art festival in Cape Town.\n\nUnlike many performance art projects in Joburg, this one isn’t about the city itself, or engaging with spaces in it, though performances are staged in a variety of locations, from a university campus to a hippie farm near Tamboerskloof. The Live Art Festival is about exploring, presenting the diversity of performance-based art.\n\n“Live Art” is a term that Pather and his colleagues from UCT’s Gordon Institute of Performing Arts (Gipca) have borrowed from the University of Bristol, where they apparently have a live art development unit, which makes it sound like some kind of scientific experiment. Their definition of “live art” could easily apply to performance art: according to them it is “art work that broadly embraces ephemeral, time-based, visual and performing arts events that include a human presence and broaden, challenge or question traditional views of the arts”.\n\nSo why not just call it a performance art festival? Live Art implies an openness to other fields of performance hailing from the worlds of theatre, dance and perhaps even sport, that performance art perhaps doesn’t, or so the thinking must be. The term is also meant to designate a strategy rather than a form, it states in the publicity material, though it is hard to identify among the diverse works at this festival any common strategy informing them other than the delivery of live action.\n\nUmbrella terms attract a different set of problems; a festival curated under such a wide-ranging banner risks incoherency and this fashionable effort to resist staking or claiming any territory stifles a perceivable discourse, or body to map. However, given the infancy of a flourishing performance art scene here and its fragmentation - some artists are aligned to the theatre world, others dance - perhaps there is no cohesive body yet to claim. The broad framing presents a snapshot of the breadth of performance work being generated.The subtitle of this festival – “make up your own mind” – also has a fashionable ring to it; it’s all about the audience’s experience these days. In reality artists are constantly training us to receive their brand of work, generating our expectations then perhaps working at dismantling them.\n\nThe residents of the building above Ruga’s studio largely have yet to be inducted into the world of performance art, though one of the country’s rising stars in this field has been toiling on the ground floor. In fact, daily, you could say he is on display, though he doesn’t normally work in a pair of fishnets. On the night of the performance, there is friction outside; a man drags his child away from the window and someone drops a water bomb over a balcony, soaking some in the crowd. Some wonder if the act of sabotage isn’t orchestrated by Ruga; it mirrors his own actions – and performance art offers these surprises, doesn’t it? Eventually, even Ruga loses patience with his own act, and he starts bursting the balloons at a fast rate, bringing the performance to its anti-climax: there is no reveal, there is no hidden identity behind the balloon façade.\n\nThe balloon screen is an extreme embodiment of an artificial mask; full of air, it has no substance, it’s pretty and transparent, though plastic and temporary. Ruga dismantles the mask violently, each pop announcing its inevitable demise. There isn’t anyone behind the mask; even Ruga the performer checks out when the balloons have all been popped. The strip is what counts, not the identity it threatens to reveal.\n\nHlengiwe Lushaba Madlala also begins her performance, Highway to Heaven/Paradise Road, concealed behind a thick façade; a wall of tyres, from which she emerges, howling with pain. Sdu Majola soothes her cries, placates her agonised yells with comforting words as he rolls a tyre around the makeshift stage in Hiddingh Hall. She isn’t hiding behind this rubber façade, but instead is trapped within it. Towards the end she frees herself from the circular bind, but not completely; Majola, too, concludes with a tyre around his neck.\n\nA number of performers luxuriate in the liberty of not being confined by dress or some other restrictive construction limiting the body, identity, by performing in the buff. We find Tebogo Munyai doing a headstand with a lit candle in his rear when we enter the theatre to watch Qina ke Qawe. His penis is concealed in white bandages that are in stark contrast to the black paint that covers his body, which appears perfect in every way. He satiates our hungry gaze, revealing every part of himself. Text projected on a screen behind him alludes to coming to terms with corporeal realities, being in touch with how the body responds to encounters as he crumps his lithe frame.\n\nNudity, revelling in it, is the topic of Mozambican dancing duo, Benjamin Manhica and Mtanyane Abilio’s piece A Nudez. But as with Thabiso Pule and Hector Thami Manekehla’s Penis Politics, they move between being dressed and disrobing.The latter piece is more successful; it’s amusing and cheeky, parodying, deflating male bravado. It concludes with the duo swaying their penises back and forth, in not only a proud display of their manhood but in a satirical send-up of it. The audience laughs.\n\nIn contrast, Themba Mbuli’s Dark Cell, performed during a gale-force wind in a courtyard at the Michaelis campus, evokes indignities performed on the black male body during the apartheid era, associating nudity with a loss of dignity and control, summoning the counter-argument during The Spear of the Nation imbroglio. By recalling these historical acts through his naked body, however, he reclaims power.\n\nWe come to expect nudity; ultimately this is a festival about the body. After British-born Jamie Lewis Hadley’s rationalised act of ordering white tiles on the floor into a neat square before cutting himself with a blade and systematically breaking each tile with his bloodied hand, it perhaps wasn’t surprising that someone asked why he hadn’t performed the act nude. Of course, this performance was engineered to minimise vulnerability and maintain distance by establishing systems (however warped) to channel emotion. Fittingly, he is dressed in an outfit befitting a racing car driver, though his is a quiet act of calculated risk.\n\nBoris Nikitin, the Swiss-born theatre director-cum-curator (hybrid careerists are ideal for this festival), initially steers us towards a comfortable place in the Imitation of Life. The Little Theatre at UCT is a conventional one but it appears as if the process of theatre has been laid bare; the stage looks more like the backstage; ladders, boxes and chairs are stacked and Malte Scholtz and Beatrice Fleischlin, the two performers, are trying to convince us they are not performing at all. They share some of their acting techniques – how to cry on demand – but in sharing intimate details of their lives (such as when they first masturbated) we believe we know their actual identities. It’s a lecture mode of delivery but amusing; the laughter aids us in dropping our guard before Nikitin gradually navigates us into a different sort of performance. It is Scholtz who appears to be most surprised by the transition, when he realises that, in the retelling and acting out of a drunken tale, he has slipped into another reality.\n\nThe lights in the theatre start flickering as the house lights go down, signalling our entry into a more conventional and contrived/artificial performance. Fleischlin and Scholtz are in different outfits and wear different expressions; we can perceive how their identities (fictional or real) have been emptied in service of these vacant vessels that sway to the music and perform stylised gestures. There is something menacing about them; they’re like zombies, capable of anything – and nothing.\n\nTraces of the actors’ identities slip through; when Fleischlin cries we know how she has summoned those tears. After a series of false endings, one of which sees these “zombies” collapse face forward on to the ground as if they are puppets, we leave Nikitin’s performance with a sense that we have journeyed back and forth through the complex corridors of performance, where acting, non-acting, fiction and non-fiction run parallel to each other and intersect.\n\nBy the time we are sitting in a confined room on the same campus to watch Nikitin’s second work, Woyzeck, we are more prepared for his tricks – his modus operandi. Or so we think. We are tricked into another false ending, which sees Nikitin in discussion with the audience, before our questions and comments are repeated back to us through Scholtz. Our feedback has become the text for the performance.\n\nNikitin makes clever work that not only prompts some interesting questions around the “live” theme, attaching it to more existential ideas rather than just the semantics around performance terms or non-terms, but also sets a bar for performance. His work is more complex and rounded than any of the others at the festival. It may have something to do with his training in theatre and his relationship to text. Nevertheless, it sets up expectations that few of the other works are able to match.\n\nLargely, the festival comprises fragments of work, beginnings of performances or ideas that have yet to evolve, may never become complete, resolved works. Some works are crude in delivery and form; Chuma Sopotela rolls on the ground on the Grand Parade opposite the Cape Town City Hall yelling “labour, economy”.\n\nCumulatively, these performance fragments coalesce into an interesting body and presumably that was the idea behind the tight programme that sees us move excitedly from room to room, site to site, to see the next instalment.\n\nThere is no time to process or even discuss performances; they blur into each other eventually and it’s hard to retain all the details. This, ultimately, is the spirit of the “live” act; its full force can be felt only in the present. - published in The Sunday Independent, December 9, 2012.\n\nPic above: Athi-Patra Ruga's Future White Women of Azania and below: Malte scholtz in Boris Nikitin's Woyzeck.

It’s one of many Kemang Wa Lehuleres that fill the first room of the Stevenson gallery. It’s like a neat cross-section of a disaster site - a clinical excavation. The title, I can’t laugh any more, when I can’t laugh I can’t… (2012) speaks of this incongruent mix of trauma and kitsch, this oscillation between digging into a past horror, while acknowledging the act of digging is clichéd.\n\nThe gallery is surprisingly empty, given it’s the opening night, but then there are four other openings or events in the Woodstock area – so the art-going-loving-buying-crowd is spread thinly between Blank, the new experimental space dubbed “Evil Son”, the Goodman and Whatiftheworld.\n\nMy companion, Malibongwe Tyilo, aka Skattie, the infamous fashion blogger of Skattie What are You Wearing, has slim pickings; fashionable or stylish gallerinas are his niche market and there are only a few old ladies knocking about the gallery. He snaps one of them, wearing a pair of silver trainers, and me in one of my statement necklaces. It’s one of five that I have brought to Cape Town as part of my Art Week Cape Town survival kit, which also includes a box of Panados (to counter headaches brought on by cheap wine at openings), the handy Artweek map, and a smartphone for tweeting and photographing so I can keep track of the work I like.\n\nThere is a lot to see and process, with two or three openings a night over the space of a week. While the Joburg art scene has wound down by mid-November – there is not an opening until next year – it’s high art season in Cape Town. December and January are the most lucrative months for galleries, what with the city brimming with affluent tourists and visitors.\n\nFew are, however, risking it with a solo show; except for the Goodman, which was due to open with a new William Kentridge exhibition wryly titled No, it is. But then it’s Kentridge, one of the most bankable local artists. Largely, it’s only public institutions that are showing solo exhibitions; the AVA is showing La Sape, a collection of painted portraits by Zambian artist Zemba Luzamba and, at the Iziko SA National Art Gallery, Mikhael Subotzky’s Retinal Shift and Jared Thorne’s exhibition, Black Folk, are being exhibited.\n\nInterestingly, Luzamba and Thorne, both foreigners, are tackling representations of black identity, though from different angles. Luzamba is interested in how black male identity hinges on the business suit, though this is juxtaposed with a painting depicting the various uniforms or historical costumes that bell hops or porters might wear. He demonstrates how clothing activates a sense of authority or an illusion of it – the porter might wear a smart costume but in this context it is not a symbol of power but servitude.\n\nThorne’s exhibition is slightly more complex; his subjects wear outfits from the fashionable to the conventional; they are young, affluent, and probably well-educated black South Africans. It’s supposed to be an ironic study of positive role models of blackness. In other words, it is engineered to counter another (absent) body. There is something of a glossy magazine feel to some of the images; they could be adverts but for the fact that they are not styled or stylised. His subjects are stiff; they know they are being observed and are perhaps each negotiating the terms or reasons for the context. What do they symbolise? They are materially, socially and politically “free” – can these facts facilitate transcendence of blackness?\n\nMost of the commercial galleries are spreading their bets with group shows to cater for every taste. Want a sculpture? You should probably snap up a Kyle Morland or a Rodan Kane Hart, two young Cape Town artists who are looking at becoming permanent fixtures on the scene down here.The two seem to be pursuing this new brand of formalism that seems to have taken hold. This kind of work doesn’t require any exhausting decoding; their dry titles aptly describe what the works are; Morland’s got an Inverted Saddle Cut, and Hart Two Brass Plates in Tension showing at Blank Projects gallery in a show aptly titled When Form becomes Attitude. It’s a witty show.\n\nIt’s Jared Ginsberg’s Ladder and White Line (yes, that’s what it is) that tickles. The white line in question is a piece of rope that is constantly moving; a motor whips it around every so often, constantly shifting its form. I like the idea of a line as a sculpture, and one that's not static but is repeated and possesses possibilities, though it is fixed too. The installation has an Art Povera feel about it that also appeals.\n\nNico Krijno also creates his compositions from a variety of found things; vegetables, printed fabrics, a tree, a couple of pillars. Pattern Content #1 is a photograph of garish printed materials placed together; it exudes a strong Eighties aesthetic in line with the long-standing Eighties revival that has been shaping the nature of our wardrobes. The work thus feels fashionable, there is a vacancy to it. This sense of vacuity, and tackiness even, pervades the show and maybe it’s unavoidable: we’re so used to loaded conceptual statements. The work here has a sort of DIY-popness to it that is satisfying in terms of rallying against the fastidiousness that a focus on form has historically entailed. Perhaps this is punk-formalism? To the gallery’s credit, this group show is underpinned by a cohesive visual and discursive signature. So many of these summer-time group shows-cum-commercial drives are not well curated, if at all. They are simply a miscellany of work by artists who happen to mostly be from Cape Town and are affiliated to these galleries.\n\nVague, broad-sweeping titles afford this phenomenon. Pretty much any work by any artist could be exhibited under the banner that Brundyn + Gonsalves were flogging as Material/Representation. This postmodern turn involving the rejection of single narratives seems to have been rather glibly exploited by gallerists. It’s hard to read art in these contexts; in the absence of a theme that thoughtfully engages or draws out a particular aspect in it and other works by an artist that ground it within a trajectory or body, they tend to function as floating islands.\n\nFor some reason – it’s so often inexplicable, irrational even – it’s Matthew Hindley’s The Meat and the Bone series that lingers in my imagination for days after viewing Material/Representation. Perhaps it’s because I can’t place it. The series consists of small paintings of a group of naked young people that appear to be held captive. In one, two blindfolded women wait in an empty dark room. There is a retro feel to the rendering that recalls illustrations from Hardy Boys covers. They are inquisitive young people who’ve been burned by their curiosity. Their naivety and innocence has brought them to this (abstract) place that sits outside of the world. They have yet to grasp the gravity of the situation. Or maybe they are not trapped at all, but enacting a twisted ritual of their creation, something that mirrors, runs parallel to what occurs in the real world.\n\nA similar work of his is also showing at Smac’s Paint I: Contemporary South African Painting 2002-2012. The same names pop up everywhere; Sanell Aggenbach is showing works at two other shows including this one. Are there too few (Cape Town) artists to go around, or are only a handful bankable? This sprawling exhibition is divided between two large galleries and it boasts some of the best contemporary painters – Mary Wafer, and the now über popular Georgina Gratrix – but it doesn’t feel like a comprehensive survey. It feels disjointed and doesn’t illuminate the shifts that have been ocurring in painting.\n\nIt’s a delight to see Johannes Phokela’s South Pacific Seascape for the simple fact I saw him working on it a few years ago before his large solo at the Standard Bank in 2009. It was supposed to go on show for that exhibition and wasn’t completed in time. The painting’s cheeky subversion of colonial rhetoric bears no relationship to the paintings around it. This is a glorified showroom, like a furniture factory where a room’s elements have been crudely disassembled.\n\nThis lack of cohesiveness, this sense of fragmentation, might not simply be explained by a lack of curatorial talent in this city or an overriding commercial imperative, but could have something to do with the fact that artists in this city – country – are pursuing a multitude of themes via a diverse set of (visual) languages that cannot be united. This retreat from the political that this punk formalism spells – this anti-idea art that creates a space for artists to bypass the political – implies a desire to move beyond old tropes. This echoes in Wa Lehulere's installation. South African art is no longer defined by easily identifiable pursuits. This is a good thing.\n\nThis idea is brought home by the group show Positive Tension, at the Whatiftheworld Gallery which, above all, seems to be centred on showing new work by emerging contemporary artists - despite the sexy title, which points to this nuanced friction between the political and apolitical, the conceptual and post-conceptual punk formalism. I am reaching for labels because I want to name what is informing these works but realise in doing so that they evade these limited tags.\n\nThere are political undertones in some of the works by Athi-Patra Ruga, Julia Rosa Clark and Rowan Smith, but there’s some formalism too in the shape of another Hart sculpture dubbed The Illusionistic Bend and a few John Murray abstract paintings. But even Hart and Murray are driving different ends of the stick.\n\nHart’s work is laden with architectural references that summon a dissection or distillation of urban forms. These discrete elements aren't teased out through the display; the exhibition feels clumsily arranged.\n\nPerhaps gallerists are expecting art critics to write the narratives underpinning South African art and make sense of it.\n\nSerious curating is supposed to be the domain of public art institutions, so perhaps it is too much to expect nuanced displays in commercial galleries. However, in this country, where the former have such limited resources, the latter have come to see themselves as hybrid players; fulfilling a service to the public and the arts community while turning a profit. Maybe only the larger players can afford such altruism, such as the Stevenson gallery, where the strongest group exhibition is on show. It’s rather grandly titled Fiction as Fiction (or a ninth Johannesburg Biennale) and is curated by Joost Bosland. It has an international feel not only because it boasts work by artists from other countries – such as the now fashionable destination for art, China – and local artists that show and/or live in other countries (Robin Rhode and Nicholas Hlobo), but the theme is unpacked through a diverse range of voices that complicate it, rather than explicate it. It’s the only group show that demands a second viewing – and embraces the possibility of film in the context of art. But its scope is also limited by its commercial imperative; only work by locals represented by the gallery is shown here.\n\nBy the time the Stevenson fills with the kind of gallerinas Tyilo hunts, he has moved to another venue. We are both looking for the same thing; someone who plays with the rules, sets themselves apart. The only difference is that fashionable art has a hollow ring to it. - published in The Sunday Independent, December 16, 2012.\n\nRead my in-depth review of Fiction as Fiction at Stevenson in the January 6 edition of The Sunday Independent.

This is the question I was interested in pursuing when I arrived at the Bus Factory in Joburg to view the Transition exhibition. It is the culmination of a project that saw six South African photographers teamed with six of their French contemporaries, as part of the French/SA Seasons 2012/2013, falling under the banner of the broader Social Landscape Project, which also included a display of snapshots by the public that were similarly centred on representations of \"the land\", probably one of the most loaded topics.\n\nIt's a kind of no-brainer theme but, because of this, it is tricky to say something new, to navigate it somewhere unexpected. Not that inventiveness or edginess is a hallmark of the French/SA Seasons projects; this cultural accord has more to do with exchange; in this context perhaps a visual conversation between local and French photographers, who appear to have been paired off, or chose to work independently, and were dispatched to different parts of the country that the curators, John Fleetwood, head of the Market Photo Workshop, and Francois Hébel, director of Les Rencontres d'Arles, had identified as sites linked to fraught historical legacies.\n\nThe title Transition attaches a caveat to these essays, alluding to the fact that these places are caught up in change or have been the catalyst for transformations of some kind. In this way the rural places or small towns, which are privileged in these works, are not static, or irrelevant in terms of illuminating larger national issues.\n\nIn this past year, no site has been more clearly linked to an impending need for transformation than the area of Marikana. The trouble at the platinum mine in this location forms the backdrop for Thabiso Sekgada and Philippe Chancel's photographs. Protesting miners appear in a few shots, but they cast their gaze wider, teasing out quite different themes, or perhaps the curators establish them. What is most striking about Sekgada's is the juxtaposition between the rural, untamed landscape, and makeshift structures in it with the sleek, imposing industrial architecture of the factories, mines. It highlights the discrepancy in power and material conditions between multinationals and their Third World employees and the clash such differences might engender. It is an image of a makeshift toilet made from corrugated iron in a grassy barren land adjacent to a large factory in the background that brings this glaring visual discrepancy starkly into focus.\n\nThe cavernous interior of the Bus Factory seems an unlikely venue for a photographic exhibition, but for the passing traffic of theatre and art people toiling in the building. A few images are framed, the rest are copies glued to long white partitions, imparting an informal quality to the show, albeit that some of the biggest names in South African photography - Santu Mofokeng, who has been selected for the German contribution to the 55th Venice Biennale, Jo Ractliffe, Zanele Muholi, who showed at Documenta (13) this year and Pieter Hugo - are represented here. The casual or informal display was intended to challenge the way in which photographic images have been co-opted and presented in gallery settings and thus positioned as \"master-pieces\", explained Fleetwood. The absence of titles and dates appearing with the images - they are contained in a separate catalogue - is also part of this drive to somehow detach these well-known photographers' work from the all-encompassing vocabulary of art and presumably to make the exhibition accessible. What does removing the \"art\" association mean for our reading of these images? Are we supposed to read them as popular culture ephemera?\n\nWithout being aware of this non-art imperative, I simply concluded that the display was simply chosen because it was inexpensive. It does have a makeshift look about it; and the wallpaper images evoke posters. Perhaps this attempt to disassociate photography from art and the invasive measures that are enacted on objects that enter this realm comes too late and is impossible to achieve when you are dealing with such big names that shoot for the art crowd. Not that they all deliver; Mofokeng's contribution, which documents the culture of protest around fracking, lacks his usual magical touch. The images simply fail to live up to his motivation for the topic in the catalogue.\n\nA photographer of his ilk perhaps doesn't flourish within the confines of such a straightforward \"assignment\".\n\nMuholi's contributions are decidedly uncharacteristic of her work too; there are no close-cropped portraits of young gay women asserting their presence, except perhaps the one encased in a coffin, a homosexual victim, who is juxtaposed with a series of colourful and ordinary wide shots of seemingly carefree young women going through the motions of the Zulu king's reed dancing ceremony. It's not just that the image of cadaver works at unsettling this series but one of a transgender male - Le Sishi - dressed in the same traditional garb as the young women participating in this annual ritual. Le Sishi obviously would not be able to participate in it - the young women's femaleness in this ceremony is solely linked to their anatomy.\n\nWhat is most striking about Muholi's images is the way she tends to portray supposedly (you can't assume all the women are heterosexual) heterosexual women at the ceremony en masse, while in her treatment of a homosexual or transgender people she highlights their individuality. This may draw attention to their alienation, but she risks homogenising heterosexual women, who also fight prejudice, and also struggle under the narrow strictures of gender. It's good to see Muholi stretching herself. This collection has more dimensions to it than any of her previous work, though her images of the reed dancing ritual could be more nuanced. It is also satisfying that the work doesn't hinge on or portray the land. Instead the theme operates as a cipher for a contested space; which in this collection is the body - it is physically policed and punished.\n\nRactliffe's subject matter - the 31/201 Battalion of San veterans who fought in the war in Angola - doesn't come as a surprise. To some degree the collection also possesses the same visual persona that defined her remarkable series shot \"on the border\" in the exhibition Terras do Fim do Mundo. Ractliffe trades in banalities, ordinary overlooked sights and sites that belie hidden histories. This fact forces you to really look at the images, as if the act of looking will somehow reveal the invisible clues. The absence of captions or titles nearby enhances this.\n\nHugo's photographs feel typical of his approach too; in contrast to Ractliffe he captures the sensational - an old woman with a damaged eye, a house chopped in half and a cluster of trees in a semi-rural setting covered in clothing. As a result, his images capture your attention immediately, though they don't sustain your interest. But there are some here that do; such as a twosome on an empty plot of land next to a main road. They are seated in front of two small boxes on which they sell some wares. There doesn't appear to be any passing trade and, resigned to this, they fall asleep.\n\nThere is some benefit in seeing the perspectives that French photographers Harry Gruyaert and Patrick Tourneboeuf bring to the project, though the two are caught up in portraying predictable white/black wealthy/impoverished dichotomies. Gruyaert juxtaposes whites enjoying leisure time with unemployed black people, while Tourneboeuf's architectural study contrasts some ageing or neocolonial interiors with contemporary exteriors in downtown Kimberley, evincing these disjointed realities and the discrepancy between public and private worlds. But not all of the French photographers can resist taking broody romantic shots of the African landscape. - published in The Sunday Independent, December 23, 2012\n\nTransition closes on March 15, 2013\n\ncaptions: top: Near Plettenberg Bay.

It’s on a small screen, you have to put on headphones and it is exhibited in the same room as two of the most powerful works on show at Fiction as Fiction (or, A Ninth Johannesburg Biennale), an intriguing installation by Ângela Ferreira that brings Jimmy Hendrix and one of the infamous Cullinans of the mining dynasty together and a ginormous black rubber sculpture by Nicholas Hlobo.\n\nFilm artworks are hard to consume in galleries. There are too many distractions – and they demand your time, attention and commitment in ways that other art doesn’t. Yet once I start watching Barrada’s film, I can’t pull myself away. It’s the cyclical narrative structure that has made a prisoner of me.\n\nThe work consists of a number of short stories, if you will, that mostly conclude with a nasty twist, sometimes a violent action that deflates the droll domestic tale. Because the stories are narrated by the same monotonous female voice, we assume they detail the events of one individual’s life, though they shift between times, places and perhaps even subjects.\n\nBarrada won’t allow you to join the dots and build a linear narrative. These stories are loose fragments, and like a damaged or incomplete memorial sculpture that only offers a very partial view of history, what remains has been subject to embellishment – it makes sense to build on what’s left instead of trying to retrieve what has been lost. These fragments are thus built into anecdotes, and are the “hand-me-downs” in question.\n\nThey are presented as, may even be, real-life experiences that have been fictionalised through the act of narration via a number of narrators over time. This is not all these fragments have in common; they express a bleak existence where a kind of unnatural reversal has occurred.\n\nIt’s about living through a time of crisis, where the normal and everyday is warped. This is what makes them stories worth telling. In a way these structured anecdotes are the mechanism that has permitted the subjects to survive the hardships they describe. A montage of found footage is synced with the text, mirroring some of the events. It’s a clumsy collage that further reduces the truth, though it adds new layers and constantly displaces the tales.\n\nThe function and different modes of narration that define fiction are the overriding theme of this exhibition, curated by Joost Bosland, which is the third and final installation of a series of curated group shows dubbed the Trade Routes Project.They all deal with the 1997 Johannesburg Biennale, which proved to be the second and last. This fact has long been lamented by the local art world and has for obvious reasons become the subject of art historical narratives, as academics, students and writers have sought to unravel its significance and the reasons and the impact of its demise. In this way, it has, like all pivotal art moments, become the stuff of legends.\n\nIts absence has become part of a broader discourse around a crippled and dysfunctional cultural landscape that has become more vulnerable to commercial forces – Ross Douglas, of Artlogic, the organisation that instigated and manages the Joburg Art Fair, has long-held the view that this primarily commercially-driven event has replaced the biennale. The fact that an exhibition dealing with this event is taking place at a commercial venue substantiates the shift that has occurred.\n\nThe politics surrounding biennales are not the focus of Bosland’s exhibition. This show isn’t about reflecting on the past but meditating on an imagined future; an attempt to envision what shape the cultural landscape might have become had the biennale continued, though this inevitably leads to a meta-fiction concern.\n\nThis is inevitable given the exhibition isn’t a miniaturised version, or a re-enactment, of a biennale – that is impossible. Biennales are associated with sprawling displays, often boasting large-scale works that cannot be contained in conventional museums or commercial galleries, though some of the work is of the biennale genre – if you were willing to declare such a thing existed.\n\nNicholas Hlobo’s Tyaphaka has been on the biennale circuit, showing at the Sydney Biennale last year, but this is not the only reason it has been included in this show; it adds a twist to the theme, which is perhaps too easily expressed via filmic products. This explains the dominance of film at this show. Film lends itself to visual (and textual) narrativising because of its sequential nature. And as Barrada’s film confirms, storytelling is a necessary ingredient to keep the viewer engaged, to keep them invested in what occurs next, though you could argue that Robin Rhode’s Yard (2011), a video of an empty shoe shifting position on a road, upturns this idea.\n\nHlobo’s Tyaphaka is a sequential piece. A single sculpture of two parts, with each displayed in separate rooms though the work is conjoined. You encounter the “eyes” first, which are elevated by a plinth.\n\nThese makeshift eyes aren’t embedded in a head, they are just balls, embodying the act of seeing, though ironically, they are detached and thus unable to see the large rambling black rubber body they are attached to via a long sort of umbilical cord that runs through to another room.\n\nTyaphaka is a Xhosa word referring to two states: one actual, having something caught in your eye, and the other metaphoric, referring to a blindness, an inability to see things for what they are.\n\nCertainly, the first part of sculpture doesn’t prepare you for the large, amorphous body that it is attached to, so there is a very physical sense of being separated from what really exists.\n\nJust as in a work of fiction, the end, the conclusion is delayed, forcing you to reflect on your inability to see it coming from the outset, though you derive your enjoyment from this. In this way the act of fiction relies on, exploits and in fact creates, a form of blindness.\n\nThe bloated black mass that awaits in the other room doesn’t quite function as a “conclusion”; if anything it does the reverse – it generates uncertainty, serving as a cipher for any number of objects, beings or parts of the body. I love the sense of excess; this large mass practically fills the room. There is something menacing about it; like thick larva slowly pouring into a space and petrifying everything in it.\n\nThe most striking aspect of Hlobo’s sculptural works is the fact that it is tricky to grasp whether it represents the interior or the exterior of the body; he aims to conflate the two.\n\nThis rubber mass appears like distended intestines. However, on the opening night, Hlobo wryly remarked that it could be “a giant poo”, thus implying that it was something the body excreted. Could this mass serve as a metaphor for the truths we carry within ourselves but keep concealed?\n\nThis reading does offer both socio-political and psychological interpretations that could be quite appealing, though Hlobo seems bent on keeping the work in the gutter. But ultimately, what he desires, what all artists desire, is that we impose fictions on to their works. Fictions susceptible to further ficitonalising. - published in The Sunday Independent, January 6, 2013\n\nFiction as Fiction (or, A Ninth Johannesburg Biennale) shows at the Stevenson Gallery in Cape Town until January 12.\n\nTop: Ângela Ferreira’s Study for Hendrix/Cullinan Shaft and Underground Cinema (After R Smithson)\n\nBelow: Nicholas Hlobo's Tyaphaka is one of the extraordinary two-part works on show at the Stevenson as part of the Fiction as Fiction exhibition.\n\n↧\n\n2012 in Review\n\nAt the end of the year I am inevitably asked to list the art highlights. Anyone who has shared a bottle of wine with me will know I am not averse to reminiscing, but I am uneasy with making pronouncements, though this is what I do for a profession. So, for the SA Art Times I sidestepped this activity altogether, preferring to look at the \"lowest common denominators\" - the works, events, art world players that had mass appeal, were supposed to have mass appeal or didn't measure up to preconceived notions. For the Daily Maverick I submitted this list and below is my latest review of 2012 in The Sunday Independent, which reflects some of my more idiosyncratic interests. Sometimes, works hold some appeal for the simple fact that they coincide with what I am researching or where my head is at, at the time. Sometimes the work just turns something on in my head.\n\nInstallation shot of Wa Lehulere's works at Fiction as Fiction\n\nBest Group/Curated Shows 2012:\n\nTrade Routes Project: Stevenson Galleries, Cape Town and Joburg.\n\nThis series of exhibitions reflected on the last Johannesburg biennale, held in 1997. The first, Trade Routes Over Time, presented works from some of the artists that participated in the biennale. The second, If a Tree… curated by Clare Butcher, contained a few remarkable works – James Beckett’s Berea in Soap and Kemang Wa Lehulere’s 30 Minutes of Amnesia – and expressed this dislocation between time and place. Finally in Fiction as Fiction (or, A ninth Johannesburg Biennale) Joost Bosland meditated on the mechanics of imagining that arises from the desire to reclaim the past and speculate on a future the event may have enjoyed.\n\nA Fragile Archive by Nontobeko Ntombela: Johannesburg Art Gallery\n\nYes, the (historical) archive, investigating it and allowing its gaps and flaws to be made visible, is terribly fashionable, and maybe Ntombela took an easy route by not making any definitive pronouncements about the work of Gladys “Nomfanekiso” Mgudlandlu and her first exhibition. However, it was an interesting premise, this attempt to restage a moment in art history. Ultimately, Ntombela revealed the contradictions and mechanics of white patronage during the apartheid era.\n\nAn Installation view of Trinity Session's retrospective at Moad\n\nOn Air Review: Trinity Session Retrospective at Moad, Joburg.\n\nThis new Maboneng venue suited this collective’s preoccupation with the liminal period of transition between entropy and gentrification, but it is the way in which Stephen Hobbs and Marcus Neustetter have turned the documentation of their psychogeographic-architectural performance films into independent products that evinced such a fascinating dialogue around the relationship between film, performance, entropy and architecture.\n\nBest Solo Exhibitions 2012:\n\nWim Botha's A Thousand Things\n\nWim Botha’s A Thousand Things: Stevenson Joburg\n\nThis was one of the most outstanding solo shows of the year. It mostly consisted of sculptures, but it was an experiential show; an installation of sculptures that fixed you in an indefinable temporal state. The work was about art, history, politics, iconography and how they intersect, but what was remarkable was what was omitted; the architectural and formal qualities that were suggested but were not fully present.\n\nMikhael Subotzky’s Retinal Shift: Settler’s Monument, Grahamstown (the display at the Iziko Gallery was not as successful or meaningful – this is a site-specific show in some ways) This exhibition came as a surprise. I had not been a fan of his work; his execution and subject-matter always seemed so predictable. It is significant that his most interesting, or should we say, conceptually sophisticated exhibition was for a non-commercial project. He turned the lens on himself, embracing a form of self-reflexivity that propelled a realisation that manipulating existing imagery can be more interesting than generating them. In the film work, Moses and Griffiths, not only does he move into a new medium of image production but assumes to play with the documentary form.\n\nDeborah Poynton’s Land of the Cockaigne: Stevenson Johannesburg.\n\nPoynbton's Land of the Cockaigne 2\n\nWhen I reviewed this show it formed part of a short dialogue around this new formalism I have been observing, particularly in painting, though Blank Project’s recent Form with Attitude clearly shows it is evolving in other mediums too.\n\nSuperficially, Poynton’s work appears to sit outside this trend, but the sense of “emptiness” that belies her highly detailed neo-baroque style brings to mind the level of vacuity that other painters – Georgina Gratrix, Carla Busutill, and Jan Henri Booyens – aspire to, except she conceals it beneath the veneer of realism. This is what makes her work so interesting. It doesn’t overstate its emptiness, or rather, ironically, it is expressed via abundance. In other words you don’t have to reduce forms to revel in their physical values.\n\nBest Performance Art Works 2012:\n\nJay Pather’s Qaphela Caesar!: Johannesburg Stock Exchange, Dance Umbrella.\n\nThis wasn’t a critics’ favourite, with many finding it too dense, too long. However, these are the very characteristics I enjoyed in this abstraction of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. It is the density and excess of Pather’s work that ensures its ephemerality and his desire to hold/relay the weight of reality. However, it was the installation work in the vacated offices of the former JSE before the spectacle that left a lasting impression.

It’s such a convoluted reality that individuals and institutions are unable to form a sustained interaction with elements, or actors in the city, or such has been the prevailing thinking, says Simone. The more “thick” a field is, he proposes, the more definitions and classifications it attracts, causing the city to “turn into an object like a language”.\n\nIt’s all about creating legible representations of space. Viewing them as purely functional, serving the needs of particular identities, lifestyles and properties has been one approach to grasping these thick social fields.\n\nYet, Simone proposes engaging with the city outside of these languages, definitions and approaches; it’s in the gaps between elements. In particular, he is interested in how people determine and change the nature of the spaces, constantly improvising in order to survive. This is the approach he embraces when he tries to come to terms with the underlying patterns of Joburg’s inner-city.\n\n“Coming to terms” with Joburg’s inner-city has become somewhat of a fetish activity. Sociologists, architects, photographers, writers and artists are fixated with untangling some of the threads that define the thickening social fields of downtown Joburg. It is the very “thickness” itself that seems to prove the attraction.\n\nPeculiarly enough, the gallery setting has become one of the main places where these (visual) explorations of South Africa’s urban life are being displayed. These spaces are almost antithetical to this concern: they appear like non-spaces. With their white walls and clinical interiors, they exist outside of the urban framework, are detached from its dynamics.\n\n“The history of gallery spaces is completely suppressed,” observes Rodan Kane Hart, when I visit him at the Nirox gallery at Arts on Main before he is due to open Structures, his first solo exhibition. Hart isn’t referring to Nirox but galleries in general.\n\nA set of double doors opening out onto the street roots this gallery in the urban landscape, though there is a clear separation between this pristine, vacant space and the seemingly chaotic, cluttered world outside.\n\nIdeally, and perhaps eventually, Hart’s bold black steel sculptures will be displayed in public\n\nspaces. Conceptually, this is his end-goal, though the allure of commercial success might shift the young twenty-something artist on another course.\n\nHis sculptures are largely simplistic forms; black painted steel rods configured into squares, triangles and more complex structures such as Exploded Kaleidoscope, an enlarged yet truncated section of a kaleidoscope on wheels. They are conceived as frames through which to view the city, though their design is derived from architectural motifs Hart identified, through photographs, drawings and observations of both Joburg – where he grew up – and Cape Town, where he now resides. They are mostly – except for Exploded Kaleidoscope – reduced forms that wouldn’t conceivably interfere too much with an urban vista, though in making space a visible unit open to distortion they might conceivably draw the viewer’s attention to the dynamics of space – the “thickness” of relations attached to it.\n\nInside a gallery they don’t function as a lens through which to view the world but function as independent forms – there is nothing else to see in the gallery. Subsequently, the sculptures’ relationship to architecture is emphasised and they function as a shorthand of the essential character of South Africa’s major urban metropolises. It’s an unseen quality. As the title of the show suggests, the sleek black lines that define his sculptures are the structures, existing beneath the structures. They are the framework, though Hart has in mind that they are optical frames too. From this point of view, architecture isn’t just the bricks and mortar of the city, the substance, but becomes the lens through which urban life, cities, are experienced.\n\nHart's Shape-Shapes\n\nHis fixation with optics is most obviously visualised in Exploded Kaleidoscope. The elaborate details – the interior of the circular structure is lined with raised mirror panels – serve as a distraction, turning the gaze inward. Without a subject, it’s function as an optical device is nullified. This idea echoes in other works such as Structured Twist, conjoined triangles and Shape-Shapes, made of contorted square shapes. The lines of both the structures don’t terminate, they are caught in a never-ending loop so that the work folds into itself. In this way, the design doesn't guide the viewer’s gaze outside of the work.\n\nNot that one is left wanting; these structures are indeed very seductive forms. Hart may have unearthed the underlying patterns of our urban landscape, but he has maintained tight control of the process, has aestheticised it. It’s this level of control that perhaps explains the very rational, harmonious and picturesque quality of Hart’s works; they are beautiful and arranged. In other words they are quite self-consciously structured.\n\nThe palimpsest of the “thickened social fields” of the city has been neutralised, superficially suspended, as is the case with the gallery itself. The sculptures are like designer items. They appear visually and ideologically resolved. So there seems to be a disjuncture between the final products and their origin. They are pure surface objects, being advanced as having links to an underlying reality. In this way Hart assumes to have his cake and eat it.\n\nHowever, his work adds a refreshing twist to representations of urban space. For starters, he isn’t interested in specifics. Hart intends to free the viewer up from being locked into actual spaces. In line with this desire to be liberated from ingrained narratives, he plays with the architectural phrases he has isolated.\n\nHis sculptures generate optical illusions – the solid steel rods appear to bend and move, depending from which vantage point you observe them – suggesting flexibility and pliability. Hart is playing with architectural forms. In the Emerging Illusionistic Bend, a slatted architectural phrase grows in scale as if it is being stretched like an elastic.\n\nSo, while he identifies a fundamental underlying urban form or pattern that seems unchangeable, he aims to warp, distort and play with it, exposing its malleability. Hart may privilege looking, by setting up the structures to facilitate it, but he directs our attention to the distorted frames through which urbanity is viewed. It’s not about what you see but how you look.\n\nFaith 47's Heritage\n\nAs a graffiti artist interested in leaving fleeting work on city walls, the white cube is also not the ideal setting for Cape Town-based Faith 47’s work. She’s an embedded-artist; her work may reflect on the urban context but it doesn’t exist outside the “thickening field”. When this kind of work is shown in the white cube it is assigned different values and loses its relevance – and soul. Certainly, this is what occurred to many of the works on display at the now-defunct Afronova gallery in Braamfontein during the City of Gold, Urban Arts Festival last year. The graffiti artists who participated were delighted they were considered artists, but many acknowledged that their work was anaesthetised in the white cube.\n\nIn Fragments of a Burnt History at David Krut, Faith 47 attempts to circumvent this by colonising an entire wall of the small Parkwood gallery with one giant installation consisting of found, disused objects that range from signboards, chairs, a broken tea pot, candles, boxes filled with illustrations and corrugated iron. It’s an attempt to transplant “the street” into the gallery. This diverse collection could be read as an attempt to recreate the “thickening fields” that denote urbanisation though, of course, this is an impossibility because the field isn’t simply mapped through visual signs that can be moved elsewhere.\n\nA conversion occurs to objects when they enter the gallery context that makes it impossible to reconstruct the street context here. In anticipation of this, Faith 47 frames objects that wouldn’t ordinarily be viewed as art objects; words scratched into wood, a torn advert. She has created some of these works, others look untouched by the artist. Her handiwork is so subtle, so fitting in a way, that you are never sure what kind, if any, intervention has been made to objects. She is a curator as much as she is an artist. Yet her representation of an urban reality is united by a binding aesthetic; these are degraded objects that hail from another era, derived from this “burnt history” referred to in the title of the show. Vorster’s image appears on an old stamp in the work They say Blood is heavier than Water, that is true?\n\nHeritage presents layers of torn posters. The words “murder”, “rape” and “kill” are visible, though they have been damaged. Presumably, the frequency with which they have appeared has ensured their continued visibility. This is a damaged world where new pains have been written over the old ones. This is driven home in Awaiting, dated files with the names of cities, where presumably requests, applications of some kind, were stored. Along the bottom are recent hand drawings of men and women seated that Faith 47 has added. These “waiting” subjects are a recurring motif that feature in large painted works on brown paper.\n\nThe subjects are anonymous, they are the ubiquitous feature of the urban landscape; waiting on corners in parks – the unemployed, the destitute, the desperate. These are more conventional artworks but, completed on brown paper, Faith 47 she retains the ephemeral nature of her work.\n\nShe is interested in other kinds of throwaway objects, useless unattractive things in circulation. They are her canvases. Some framed objects have no value, it’s as if the frame itself no longer has any meaning. She scratches base comments about migration onto a worthless framed painting of a ship. As with Hart’s exhibition the nature of the frame is an underlying concern.\n\nThis approach, using existing canvases and leaving a mark on them, mirrors the mode of graffiti art making. Existing markings left on the objects are vital to her production. A lion motif is spray-painted onto a blackboard that once kept track of production in a factory. It’s an ironic twist; inserting this symbol of power into a context where individuals were subject to control. Driving this appropriation of dated items and inserting new comments or symbols is Faith 47’s way of overwriting the past, while ensuring it remains visible.\n\nTime has elapsed; these objects are undeniably relics, however, they continue to carry some power, haunt her “waiting” subjects, who are paralysed by history. They are nothing like the ideal subjects of Simone’s study, who adapt urban spaces. They occupy public space as a way of asserting their presence though they cannot claim ownership of it.\n\nA pedestrian corridor is given form at Interface 2012 at\n\nGoethe -on-Main\n\nDoung Anwar Jahangeer, founder of Dala, a creative collective that uses art and architecture to bring about social change in eThekwini, is interested in the people on the street determining urban design that suits them rather than adapting to it, as per Simone’s model. This is the underlying motive behind Interface 2012, a series of works instigated by five artists along a well-trodden pedestrian route through Cato Manor (Umkhumbane) to Durban’s Warrick Triangle. It’s an experiential project which, like Simone’s approach, is engineered to identify “gaps where time in our spatial composition is suspended”. By this they refer to walking, the habitual pedestrian routes that a community has established over time and the narratives associated with landmarks along it. These patterns will eventually feed into the urban design along this route. Like Faith 47, Jahangeer must also grapple with translating street activity and performances into the Goethe on Main gallery at Arts on Main.\n\nThe display in the gallery isn’t straight documentation; screens along one wall flash close-ups of pavements, and other paths along this route. It’s a jumble of sensory images; grass, rocks, concrete, all summoning the diverse range of elements that define this “thickened field”. Paths through the city are overlooked.\n\nIt is impossible to get any concrete sense of the performances in this project; the screens parade loose fragments. A cardboard installation that resembles a long-tailed dragon hangs in the middle of the gallery, illustrating the paths along the pedestrian corridor. In this way, the intangible act of walking is given form, can be traced, though it only plots one fragile line through an urban jungle. - published in The Sunday Independent, January 27, 2013.\n\nInterface 2012 will show at Goethe on Main in Joburg until February 10. Fragments of a Burnt\n\nHistory will show at David Krut, Joburg until February 9.\n\n↧\n\nBlack & Light: Broomberg & Chanarin\n\nID 5, 2013\n\nIt is unexpected and, perhaps, even disconcerting, to be confronted with a large collection of polaroids at Adam Broomberg and Oliver Chanarin’s new exhibition, To Photograph the Details of a Dark Horse, at the Goodman Gallery. This dated photographic product is so diminutive that you have to stand centimetres away from the images to view them. Not that this offers much satisfaction either; the images are split in two, blurred and dark, and the views of the natural vegetation that Broomberg and Chanarin have snapped are so partial that their subject matter – the Karoo landscape – is always beyond your grasp. It’s the worst kind of tease; knowing that something exists in front of you but you’re unable to access it.\n\nThis seems to fly in the face of the prevailing fashion of art photographs. They have been steadily growing in scale to conform to this idea that a photograph is more likely to be read as an art object if it large.\n\nAs the American art theorist Michael Fried has observed, this burgeoning scale has allowed the photographic image to be constructed – and read – like a painting; it’s absorptive, immersive and can accommodate details that prolong the act of looking.\n\nYet there is something painterly about this series; it is a visceral and abstract act of documentation driven by capturing the sensual details of the setting; the warm light, the textures of the plants. In some instances you are fleetingly rooted in the middle of a field of flowers.\n\nThis picturesque and pleasing veneer conceals, and is motivated by, an unusual political statement; an effort to reverse, invert the use of the ID-2 Polaroid camera and vintage film from the apartheid era.\n\nThe technology of this camera and film was developed to enable black people to be photographed – early colour film was only engineered to ably capture white skin. This actuality is illustrated via a display of test images of “Shirley”, a female model deemed to possess the ideal shade of whiteness upon which to identify the perfect amount of light needed to illuminate the body/subject.\n\nThe exhibition is peppered with a number of historical artefacts pertaining to the history that informs their project, establishing the gallery as a pseudo-museum space, while blurring the boundary between art object and historical document – it’s easy to mistake one for the other in this context.\n\nStrip Test 4, 2012\n\nThe display of test shots of Shirley establishes the inherent bias built into photography; the way in which the technology ensured that black subjects were rendered invisible. The twosome present their own “strip tests” with black subjects. A black woman with white paint on her face and wearing a white towel is further “whitened” on a strip test; so, even though she appears to be trying to appear white, she is further “erased”.\n\nMaking the gradation of light visible in these images, the duo draw our attention to the constructedness of image-production, the unseen technological laws of light that predetermine not only how a subject is read but how this impacts on how they might view themselves.\n\nInterestingly, when a better technology was developed to capture black subjects, the apartheid state was keen to harness it for the production of passbooks. In this way, the invisibility of black subjects was overturned only in an effort to catalogue and control them. Put plainly; this positive development was used by the South African government towards a sinister end. In typical fashion this transpired via a cloak-and-dagger scheme, in which the American manufacturers of Polaroid where revealed to be both co-conspirators and, eventually, strong detractors against the apartheid state.\n\nBroomberg and Chanarin’s interest and emphasis on the inbuilt bias of dated photographic instruments directs our attention to the complicity that is forced upon its users, r"
