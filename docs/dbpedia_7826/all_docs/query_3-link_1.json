        "text": "Issue No. 127, March 2008\n\nThe addition of a new event into the SA art calendar has everyone in a bit of a flurry. This month, as if you didn't know, the Joburg Art Fair kicks off at the Sandton Convention Centre, hosting 22 galleries and numerous side projects. We wish all concerned, and especially the good people at Artlogic, the event co-ordinating company, a successful maiden voyage. In two OPINION pieces, ArtThrob considers the importance of such an event, and the shift in dynamics from the curated shows we are more used to on home turf.\n\nIssue No. 126, February 2008\n\nSpeaking to Clive van den Berg at Spier in December last year, he said an interesting thing about Andrew Putterï¿½s award-winning Secretly I Will Love You More. Van Den Berg asserted the workï¿½s importance because, he said, it shifted the emotional register of much SA contemporary art, especially work that dealt with race-based issues, into one of tenderness rather than the more frequently-plumbed depths of prejudice, guilt and recrimination. This month, our ARTBIO focuses on Putterï¿½s career to date, rightfully inserting him into our mini-pantheon.\n\nIssue No. 125, January 2008\n\nSue Williamson said in her December ArtThrob editorial that 2007 was ï¿½not a bad yearï¿½ for SA art. As the backbone of this ï¿½ArtThrob liteï¿½ update, our various contributors get a chance to opine about the good, the better and the challenging from 2007 in their various regions and/or valences. Whatï¿½s refreshing to see is that this isnï¿½t simply a list of usual suspects and safe choices. Rather, it is evident that the ArtThrob team is increasingly functioning as a network of journalists with its collective finger on the pulse of important SA art. The absence of consensus about what constitutes quality is very healthy.\n\nIssue No. 124, December 2007\n\nLooking back, 2007 was not a bad year. For art in South Africa, that is. Cape'07 did finally happen, in March - in a lite but imaginative version of what was originally planned. And this month, Spier Contemporary opens in a highly innovative art structure for this first edition - three stories of containers form the walls of the space, with a tensile ceiling stretched overhead. A team under the direction of Clive van den Berg has been working frantically on the show, and one hundred artists from across the country will be showing their stuff. One of the criteria: every artist had to show new work. in another first, Cape Town's most famous international artist, Marlene Dumas, came home from the Netherlands for 'Intimate Relations' a breathtaking solo show at Iziko SANG, and Africa Remix, the Simon Njami curated mega exhibition, drew the largest crowds ever to the opening at the Johannesburg Art Gallery in June.\n\nIssue No. 123, November 2007\n\nPlaying rugby and studying fine art were considered mutually exclusive activities said Andries Botha to me, in an interview I conducted in 1995, describing such an unholy alliance in his own student years in Pietermaritzburg. I wouldn't venture to say that anything has changed in that respect, but it certainly is excusable to mention South Africa's Rugby World Cup victory in this sort of forum these days. Especially in light of the galvanising effect it has had on our sometimes fractured populace.\n\nIn his opening address (see REVIEWS and NEWS) at Durban's Bank Gallery's inaugural exhibition, and Botha's first in the country in 15 years, artist Greg Streak saw fit to compare the country's sports stars with its artists. Both, he claims, share an intense devotion to their work, engage in long periods of training, and many of them leave to pursue careers in other countries. While the latter might be less true of artists these days (although Durban's talents do tend to migrate to the bigger centres), there was a time when the cultural climate was so inhibiting to artists that many left the country for greener pastures. One such artist is Marlene Dumas, who left in 1976, and who, despite maintaining her ties with the country, is presenting her first solo exhibition here more than 30 years later at the South African National Gallery (See LISTINGS). 'Intimate Relations', curated by Dumas herself and Emma Bedford, will cover a broad selection of her work, ranging from early conceptual pieces to very recent paintings and drawings dealing with contemporary global issues.\n\nIssue No. 122, October 2007\n\nWhile down here in Cape Town, between small tastes of spring, winter makes a few last stands, exhibitions all over the country seem to be displaying a similar kind of dichotomy - the older established voices assert themselves in the clamour of younger upstarts. Willem Boshoff's mid-career retrospective has opened at the Standard Bank Gallery in Johannesburg (see REVIEWS) and a one-person show opens soon at the Michael Stevenson Gallery in Cape Town. That gallery is currently hosting Penny Siopis, whose work has certainly been in my consciousness for at least 20 years. Of a similar vintage is Jeremy Wafer whose show of recent work at Goodman Gallery Cape Town is reviewed (see REVIEWS). The older and younger mix when Kevin Brand teams up with Sanell Aggenbach for a show at the AVA entitled 'Arcadia'. We also review 'Posters Designed Under Apartheid' at Warren Siebrits Modern and Contemporary Art (see REVIEWS), which takes us back to a poignant moment in our cultural history. All of the older generation mentioned above have their practice firmly rooted in their reaction against that abhorrent ideology which permeated any cultural production for several decades. Since 1994, artistic concerns have diversified, and we see the results of that in the number of shows by younger artists. Lisa Brice, whose solo show opens at Goodman Gallery Cape this month, seems to straddle the divide, having moved from the socio-political concerns of her earlier work into the emotional territory of her current paintings. Spearheading the younger generation of artists whose sensibilities are informed by a post-1994 context are the likes of curators Carrie Timlin and Lily Luz whose multi-part, fabulously named 'The idiotic and inchoate descent into nihilism' opens its final chapter at the Michaelis Gallery. Zander Blom, Jan-Henri Booyens and Michael MacGarry of Avant Car Guard (see STUDENT REVIEWS) appear to be shaping up as the enfants terribles of their generation, taking pops at Pierneef and Kendell Geers alike. Blom opens 'The Drain of Progress' in Johannesburg, which is accompanied by a catalogue raisonné, as he calls it. We will be posting an interview with him early next week.\n\nIssue No. 121, September 2007\n\nAs ArtThrob enters its second decade online, it's interesting to look back, and draw a few comparisons between then and now. The second Johanneburg Biennale, curated by Okwui Enwezor opened 10 years ago this month, winning international plaudits and introducing local artists to a larger art world. Sadly, the premature closing of the Biennale was also its death knell. Subsequent attempts to launch an international event on a similar scale have all floundered. 'Africa Remix', now up at the Johannesburg Art Gallery, has come closest to generating something of the same excitement.\n\nIssue No. 120, August 2007\n\nWhile William Kentridge's much anticipated prouction The Magic Flute opens in Cape Town this month, Kathryn Smith has her first solo outing since her Standard Bank Young Artist Award show, new KZNSA Director Brenton Maart takes the bull by the horns in 'Right Before Your Eyes' and others like Mikhael Subotzky and Berni Searle are showing at a number of international venues simultaneously. Reviews include: Nandipha Mntambo, Nontsikelelo 'Lolo' Veleko, 'Africa Remix' and 'Right before your eyes'. Artbio: Pierre Fouché.\n\nIssue No. 119, July 2007\n\nIt was Africa's biggest moment in Venice. Ever. For the first time, there was an African pavilion, located in the Arsenale, After a call for proposals for this pavilion, the nod had gone to Fernando Alvim and Simon Njami to curate a show drawn largely from the Sindika Dokolo Contemporary African Collection of Art. That show was called 'Checklist Luanda Pop'. There was a strong representation of African artists on director Robert Storr's keynote exhibition, 'Think with the sense, feel with the mind: art in the present tense.' Ghanain artist El Anatsui's extraordinary metal fabric hangings draped not only the front of the Palazzo Fortuny but spaces within the Arsenale. And Malian photographer Malick Sidibe won the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement.\n\nIssue No. 118, June 2007\n\nFor the international artworld, June presents a feast of contemporary art which happens only when the Venice Biennale (every two years) coincides with documenta (every five). Add to that Art Basel in Switzerland and the Munster Sculpture Project, and the mix is potent indeed.\n\nIssue No. 117, May 2007\n\nIn mid April, CAPE sent out a questionnaire to 'X-Cape' participants, those on the fringe, asking for feedback on a range of questions relating to their experience as exhibitors on the 'Cape '07' programme of art events. There is to be an assessment session on May 14, looking back at how things actually happened in the end, and looking to the future. (And there were many wonderful moments. Like the viewings of artists' video work on the bank of TV sets for sale in the busy mall under Cape Town station, for example.) 'Any further comments?' reads the last line of the questionnaire.\n\nHere is one from ArtThrob. Is there going to be any form of catalogue, any tangible visual and written record on paper of the events that took place? Something for posterity, to send to all those who took the time and trouble to participate and want a record of it; for all those wanted to come but didn't, and for Cape to have in hand to show for next time around? Without it, it will be hard to convince sponsors, artists, and the overseas press that anything of real value took place. In today's art world, a catalogue is totally essential, the proof that the organisers take their responsibilities seriously.\n\nIssue No. 116, April 2007\n\nPerformers styled after Jane Alexander's classic Butcher Boys crept across the roof of the Lookout Centre in Khayelitsha, on the sandy outskirts of Cape Town, site of the opening ceremonies of CAPE '07, looking down as Minister of Culture Pallo Jordan addressed the large crowd of local and international visitors come to celebrate the event. Inside, the newly repainted interior showcased the work of such artists as Godfried Donkor (Ghana//UK), Mumbakwedza Mutasa (Zimbabwe) and Nicholas Hlobo (SA). Events spread across six more major venues boasted crisp presentation and artists on hand to discuss their work with visitors. Parties and other art events made for a hectic five day start up. The international critics and curators who eventually did make it here despite the confusing on-again off-again runup to the event (or at least the ones I spoke to) said that despite their initial reservations in coming, they had been impressed and invigorated by the programme, and looked forward to future events. The action continues this month.\n\nIssue No. 115, March 2007\n\nLess than we had hoped for but a lot better than nothing. That pretty much sums up the position on the evolution of TransCape into Cape '07, opening on March 24. With promised funding still not in hand, director Gavin Jantjes has resigned, sending out a letter to artists expressing regrets about the turn of events, but encouraging them to participate in the new reduced format. The foreign visitors who are expected will still find plenty to see - read Sue Williamson's lengthy interview with the new Cape Africa team of Gabi Ngcobo and Jonathan Garnham.\n\nThere will still be seven major venues, and more than one hundred events on XCape, the fringe. There'll be Marlene Dumas prints in a Khayelitsha B&B. Plus the stunning new Goodman Cape opens on March 22, and all the other galleries will have their best artists forward. So please come visit. An update of venues and artists will appear mid month, on March 18.\n\nA little further north, the KKNK - the Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees opens in Oudsthoorn, and much further the announcement regarding the African participation at the 52nd Venice Biennale has finally been made.\n\nIssue No. 114, February 2007\n\nIn exactly the same way we did last year, we all gasp that the first month of the new year has already passed. Maybe, though, with the rush of the festive season over and now that we are settling into the groove for another year's hard work, it is an opportunity for reflection on the year past and anticipation for the year (or 11 months thereof) to come. To this end, all of our regional editors have contributed to a review of 2006 [See REVIEWS], listing their three best shows, a best newcomer, South Africans making the most interesting work and the most important local art event during the period. Given their regional biases there is a lot of variation in the results, but a number of names and events come up repeatedly - Peter van Heerden, Nicholas Hlobo, Mikhael Subotsky, the KZNSA's Young Artists' Project, and inevitably, 'TransCape' which was actually postponed until this year. It is set to begin next month, so we run an article [See OPINION], previously published in Domus, n. 898, December 2006, by Italian art critic and researcher Iolanda Pensa. Her reflection on the process leading up to next month's event, benefiting from her outsider's view, expresses equal measures of caution and optimism. I think that's pretty much how we feel here too, although I might add a dash of excitement. The latest issue of New Yorker carries an image by Lolo Veleko on their art listings page. To order your own Lolo Veleko prints, exclusively offered by Editions for ArtThrob, check the EDITIONS section this month, and read all about this rapidly rising young photographer in ARTBIO, written by Tracy Murinik.\n\nIssue No. 113, January 2007\n\n'ArtThrob is brilliant!', said Documenta 12 director Roger Buergel in a brief conversation with me following a panel discussion in New York this week. 'We used it for all our research'. In his presentation at a New Museum discussion on globalism versus provincialism enitled 'Location Location, Location', Buergel had emphasised the importance the Documenta organisers are placing on the role of the world media in disseminating - and inititiating - art discourse. In February, Documenta will hold a small forum of media people in Johannesburg around the enigmatic question 'What is to be done?'\n\nIssue No. 112, December 2006\n\nIn the middle of December, the announcement will be made from Venice as to which proposal has been accepted for space created for an African Pavilion in the Arsenale for next year's 52nd Venice Biennale. This year's director, Robert Storr opened up the doors to all comers with an unprecedented announcement on the Biennale website that the space, security and electricity would be free to the successful curator, and the original deadline of October 31 was extended to November 24.\n\nSpeculation has been that maybe thirty proposals will reach the table. Artists Ed Young and Christian Nerf travelled to New York to put their case to Storr personally (see DIARY) and the general intrigue and backbiting - and that's just so far - could have been the subject of a new reality TV show.\n\nIssue No. 111, November 2006\n\nPassing through Cape Town this month on a trip timed to tie in with the last days of Trans Cape (ouch) and organise a future show in Barcelona, Spanish curator Pep Subiros commented that for him, South Africa was the most alive artistic community in the world ... one in which young artists go beyond their subjective interests to embrace the collective and address historical and social conditions. Looking at the list of exhibitions on offer this month and at the focus of some of those shows, one might agree with Pep ... scanning down the list, one sees HIV/Aids, farm life and labour conditions under scrutiny, an exhibition produced by offenders in correctional centres in KZN, politically inclined artist Manfred Zylla is showing at Momo, Clive van den Berg's Goodman Gallery show 'Skin and Ghosts' which considers the porosity of skin in an age of AIDS is reviewed ... and so it goes.\n\nIssue No. 110, October 2006\n\nThe Cape Africa Platform may have flunked out on opening TRANS CAPE in September as scheduled, but Capetonians celebrated the postponed not-a-biennale anyway - twice. Andrew Lamprecht put together the 'real' Cape Biennale salon-style at blank projects while CAPE itself linked up various spaces in an Art Circuit night around the city centre. There was even a foreign journalist, Italian Iolanda Pensa, who flew in to dissect the non event for Domus.\n\nIssue No. 109, September 2006\n\nMany will be heaving a sigh of relief that the initial shock of the postponement of TRANS CAPE is beginning to wear off, and the hope is that the organisers will use the time they have bought by making the event truly live up to its initial promise - with taxi routes, maps and great art. Overseas reactions to the news varied.\n\nIssue No. 108, August 2006\n\nShock waves are going through the South African art world with the news that TRANS CAPE, the mega art event scheduled to open in 24 venues in and around Cape Town on September 23 has been postponed for six months.\n\nIssue No. 107, July 2006\n\nWhere are the young white women?, asks Linda Stupart in her review of 'Second to None' at the SANG this month, noting that while the older generations are represented, the rising artists on the show seem to be almost exclusively black. Do curators ever get the balance of age/gender/race right? Should they have to?\n\nIssue No. 106, June 2006\n\nIs there any other country where the subject of Biennales so divides the art world? The pros believe the international focus is essential to raising the profile of the whole art scene, the cons that with limited resources we should be concentrating on the local. A chief spokesperson for the cons is Mario Pissarra, who took three years to take issue (on his website) with an ArtThrob review of the 2003 Venice Biennale, and a piece written at the same time by SANG director Marilyn Martin. In the opposite corner and speaking up for the pros is Malcolm Payne, who argues for the inestimable value of Biennales in this month's OPINION.\n\nIssue No. 105, May 2006\n\nThe news that Picasso's 'Dora Maar with Cat' has just sold for an astounding US$95 million at New York's Sotheby's will no doubt create an even greater incentive for Capetonians to take in the 'Picasso in Africa' show at the National Gallery. Already there are reports of viewers queuing in the rain to get inside - which must be a first for the SANG.\n\nIssue No. 104, April 2006\n\nUnbelievably, nine years after the early demise of the now legendary 2nd Johannesburg Biennale in 1997, wistful rumours of its imminent resuscitation still circulate on the international circuit, and were repeated to me again at the Havana Bienal in Cuba last week. Perhaps they will be laid to rest when the first Trans Cape takes place later this year, planned to occur every two years...\n\nIssue No. 103, March 2006\n\nAt last the visual artists of South Africa have a credible organisation - VANSA, the Visual Arts Network of South Africa - to represent them at government level. The first national VANSA conference, held in Cape Town, in February brought artists and cultural workers from all over the country and a strong spirit of optimism pervaded the proceedings.\n\nIssue No. 102, February 2006\n\nEvery year, the editors of ArtThrob attempt to come up with a 'Best of' list as a look back at the artists and art events of the previous year. This is always a highly subjective exercise, but to see who thought what about who, go to 'News'.\n\nIssue No. 101, January 2006\n\nIn the holiday spirit we have produced a small update, allowing our contributors to take a year-end break. Some regulars, and other less regular contributors, however, have been hard at work. Johannesburg-based artist José Ferreira has allowed us to publish his extensive notes on eKapa SESSIONS, which find him in a reflective mode. Ruth Sacks also gives us her impressions of the three days which are sure to remain a talking point for some time to come. In addition to this she has written a report on the Vernissage of the Trienal de Luanda which she was invited to attend last month, and for which she has been appointed Cape Town co-ordinator.\n\nIssue No. 100, December 2005\n\nWho would ever have thought that Kendell Geers would be the voice of reason? Well, that's how it turned out on the last day of SESSIONS eKapa. While other panelists fumbled - Tracey Rose um-ed and ah-ed with little more articulacy than Cheech and Chong, and Thembi Goniwe set aside his prepared paper to criticise 'certain gurus' - Lesego Rampolokeng played the perfect shapeshifting foil to Geer's measured and considered presentation.\n\nIssue No. 99, November 2005\n\nSPECIAL FEATURE: ART AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Over the last decade, contemporary South African art has attracted unprecedented interest with local and international exhibitions increasing and sale prices soaring. Many artists, and their support systems, are seen to be riding the crest of this wave. But how widespread is this success? This issue, focused on art and social development, examines the visual arts sector and poses some tough questions.\n\nIssue No. 98, October 2005\n\nShockwaves ran through the South African art world this month at the horrifying news that mining magnate Brett Kebble was shot dead in his car in Johannesburg on the night of September 28. Kebble, often described as a 'larger than life' figure, was one of the most generous and supportive art patrons in the country, raising the level of his Brett Kebble Arts Awards exhibition to international standards in two years.\n\nIssue No. 97, September 2005\n\nBiennales in Africa seem like bush fires: they are ignited, they flare up and light the scene briefly, sometimes memorably and unforgettably, and then they die. Or if they survive, it is only as a dull glow which lights little beyond the immediate surroundings. Enter the first Luanda Trienal, of which the major events will take place over three months in the first half of next year. In a special preview, the editor reports on some of the ambitious plans for this new art event.\n\nIssue No. 96, August 2005\n\nWilliam Kentridge, whose last retrospective at the South African National Gallery in Cape Town was one of the biggest crowd pullers in the SANG's history, is again the subject of a differently curated - this time by Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev - retrospective at the Johannesburg Art Gallery, see Robyn's Sassen's review. Much as the country's most famous artist deserves these accolades, ArtThrob's question is this: why do the large art institutions not take more initiative in bringing the art careers of other late and mid-career artists to the attention of the public in locally curated retrospectives? The drawings, the different bodies of work in varying media building links and connections across the years all take on a new richness and complexity when seen as a whole. Artists like Penny Siopis, Clive van den Berg, Sandile Zulu, Moshekwa Langa and Brett Murray come to mind. What a treat it would be to see a substantial exhibition from each, spanning the last 10 or 20 years.\n\nIssue No. 95, July 2005\n\nDidn't get to Venice this year? In her illuminating review, Laurie Ann Farrell of the Museum for African Art in New York rates the 51st Biennale an 'experience par excellence'. Only 10 years younger than the Venice Biennale, the NSA Gallery in Durban celebrates its centenary this month - which must surely make it the oldest non-museum gallery in the country. Congratulations to the NSA on surviving this long - and going from strength to strength - are definitely in order.\n\nIssue No. 94, June 2005\n\n'I couldn't help thinking that if anyone wanted to wipe out all the major personas of the Johannesburg art world, present and slightly past, all you'd have to do is unleash some terrorist-type action on the JAG on the evening of Sunday May 1, 2005.' So writes Kathryn Smith in her reflective report on the impact of the performance of international art star Marina Abromovic at the Johannesburg Art Gallery. It wasn't only Abromovic and fellow artist Paolo Canevari who earned press coverage - organiser and opening speaker Kendell Geers earned the scorn and indignation of the local press by daring to suggest that local artists were getting 'worse and worse', 'festering under a rock' and 'culturally isolated'.\n\nIssue No. 93, May 2005\n\nIt is hard to know who or what is the greatest victim of the unedifying Nelson Mandela art print scam: the charities the sale of the prints was supposed to benefit, the reputation of South Africa's great leader, or the credibility of South African art. In OPINION this month, Sue Williamson dolefully looks at the issues.\n\nOn the brighter side, no less than six South African-born artists will be showing on the two main exhibitions in the Italian Pavilion and the Arsenale on the 51st Venice Biennale, more than any other country except the United States (9), Spain (8) and Germany(7). One of them is Berni Searle, whose new show opens this month at Michael Stevenson in Cape Town. Searle has been selected to exhibit on the exhibition 'Always a little further', which will be in the Arsenale and is curated by Biennale co-director Rosa Martinez. The five other artists, who will show in the Italian Pavilion, are Robin Rhode, Zwelethu Mthethwa, William Kentridge, Marlene Dumas and Candice Breitz.\n\nIssue No. 92, April 2005\n\nWhat is the art world to make of the sorry Nelson Mandela artists' prints affair? The wheeling and dealing now receiving extensive coverage in the press is unsavoury to say the least, and the credibility of artists and the validity of editioned prints is being called into serious question. An opinion piece will appear in News next month.\n\nIssue No. 91, March 2005\n\nJoost Bosland, writing from New York, perceives a possible new highlighting and understanding of African art outside of the continent. As I write this, Iziko South African National Gallery's head of contemporary art, Emma Bedford is in that city as part of a hand-selected group of international curators invited to provide fresh ideas to the curators of MoMA. March sees shows that tend towards representing the great names in South African art. Look through the listings and the reviews and names such as Norman Catherine, the late Gerard Sekoto, the late Dumile Feni, Jurgan Schadeberg, Malcolm Payne, Sue Williamson and William Kentridge seem to dominate. Can it be that another corner has been turned here at home?\n\nIssue No. 90, February 2005\n\nAll is quiet, feels the editor this month - why so little discussion and debate in our art world? What do we say about art or, perhaps more tellingly, what does the nature of the art we focus on in this publication have to do with the fact that very little ever seems to be said? Even at openings and walkabouts, I have found that hardly anyone is interested in the art anymore. Of the gossip about the artists, curators, hangers-on, etc, much fills the cluttered whites cubes and other volumes dotted around our country. Of art there is silence.\n\nIssue No. 89, January 2005\n\nMoshekwa Langa, Paul Emmanuel and Jacki McInnes exhibit in Joï¿½burg while Mark Hipperï¿½s work is on view in Cape Town. Aryan Kaganof digitally streams and Pippa Skotnes is to be seen in Oslo. Joost Bosland begins his critical examination of how Africa is represented overseas. Photographer Guy Tillim is the Artbio and some ArtThrob editors and others give an overview of 2004.\n\nIssue No. 88, December 2004\n\nBell-Roberts move to new premises and host a show to accompany the launch of their book '10 Years 100 Artists'. Katherine Bull shows in Cape Town and Carol-Anne Gainer in Johannesburg. Kentridge takes on the Met in New York. Iziko SANG's 'Decade of Democracy' comes under critical review and Wim Botha is awarded the Standard Bank Young Artist award for 2005.
