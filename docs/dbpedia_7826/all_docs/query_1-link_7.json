        "text": "About the Poster\n\nThe 2024 Wavescape Festival poster, crafted by the talented Yeye Weller, is a vibrant celebration of the ocean's spirit and the joy of surfing. The poster features an exuberant character riding the waves, surrounded by a lively ensemble of jellyfish, seals, and playful patterns that evoke the festival's lively atmosphere. Yeye Weller's unique artistic style brings a sense of fun and whimsy to the surfing scene, capturing the essence of the festival's energetic and carefree vibe. The dynamic composition, coupled with the incorporation of marine life and captivating patterns, promises to draw in audiences and convey the excitement and creativity that await them at this year's Wavescape Festival.\n\nAnd yet, I remain\n\nSouth Africa, 2022, 8min Director: Rick Wall & Dougal Paterson Charismatic Caleb Swanepoel lost his leg to a great white shark in 2015, while surfing in Buffels Bay in the Southern Cape. Rehab was a stepping stone to come back harder and faster, and he returned to the ocean a few weeks later. His life became a headlong rush to succeed and achieve, fuelled by a burning, innate passion. This short film follows his journey while he finally begins to ease up on this all-consuming quest. He begins to slow down to process his trauma, while learning to free dive, an immersive place in the brine where you start to see things differently â the place that helps him come to terms with a body that has been irreversibly changed forever.\n\nBIRTH OF THE ENDLESS SUMMER (Official SA Premiere)\n\nUS, South Africa, 2021, 96min Director: Richard Yelland This is the backstory of the most watched documentary of all (in any genre) The Endless Summer, released in 1965. Emmy Award-winning director Richard Yelland tracks grizzled Californian surf pioneer Dick Metz as he vagabonds the globe from 1958 to 1961, and returns to South Africa decades later. Importantly to us, it chronicles in detail what actually happened â warts and all â when Robert August and Mike Hynson came upon our shores with Bruce Brown to shoot the original. It tells the story of how Dick met John Whitmore, by âhappenstanceâ as the Oom later recalls, which changed the history of surfing forever. A nostalgic Dick, 92, meets up with local surfers and visits old haunts where he shared good times with the Oom and his family.\n\nTHE BLACK MERMAID\n\nSouth Africa, 2022, 9min ThroughÂ­out hisÂ­toÂ­ry, Black comÂ­muÂ­niÂ­ties have had a treachÂ­erÂ­ous relaÂ­tionÂ­ship with water, depictÂ­ed as a powÂ­erÂ­ful yet destrucÂ­tive entiÂ­ty in African folkÂ­lore. This is a stoÂ­ry nevÂ­er told before, but necÂ­esÂ­sary now more than ever: a modÂ­ern day tale of the Black MerÂ­maid, Zandile Ndhlovu, a South African free divÂ­er who takes us to disÂ­covÂ­er the magÂ­ic of the SarÂ­dine Run.\n\nSONIC SOUVENIRS EPISODE 1\n\nSouth Africa, 2019, 20min Director: Blake Myers Sonic Souvenirs is a series of portraits that takes us on an exploration of art, music and surfing with Mikey February as he travels around his homeland, connecting with artists and surfers. Our first episode trails Mikey close to home journeying up and down the East and West coast of South Africa. His soulful surfing style interfaces with the languid pace of the musicians he meets along the way, including the inimitable guitarist Madala Kunene from Durban. The result is a spiritual â almost mystical â visual connection with his natural environment, his surfing an expression of his art.\n\nNATURAL HIGH (SA Premiere)\n\nUS, 2023, 37min Director: Jack Coleman The title of this great little film is self explanatory. Surfing is, of course, the ultimate Natural High. And, as alternative surf writer and finless savant Jamie Brisick says, when you watch a Jack Coleman movie, you plunge into a joyous world filled with peeling waves and sideways drifts and luminous characters and always great music. Kiff surf flick with extra salt and a bigger dose of soul.\n\nTHE PHYSICS OF NOSE RIDING (SA Premiere)\n\nNew Zealand, 2023, 6min Director: Lauren Hill There is science behind surfingâs fluid dance. The nose ride is one of surfingâs peak moments not too far from the tube ride; part fluid dynamics, and part magic. But how does nose riding actually work? What makes this bizarre suspension between sea and sky physically possible? The Physics of Noseriding explores the question through the eyes of Namaala, a young surfer whose people were flying on the water long before the world even knew what surfing was. Her curiosity invites us to examine the sensation of levitation that unfolds as wave, surfboard and surfer come together, a place where human and ocean intersect for the motion of surfingâs fluid dance.\n\nFACING MONSTERS (SA Premiere)\n\nAustralia, 2023, 93min Director: Bentley Dean This documentary feature depicts the sheer brutal insanity of West Australian slab surfing that makes your skin crawl with fiery sea lice scuttling in abject terror from giant waves. We sink below the surface into the roiling depths of hellman surfer Kerby Brownâs psyche. Much more than a simple surfing story, this is a searing glimpse into that twilight zone between life and death. This dark, swirling place is the epiphany that near-death can bring to a man fixated on a single minded mission that can only end in the impact zone of foaming bedrock at a ferocious slab no one on the planet has surfed before, and perhaps will never surf again.\n\nAMBLE (SA Premiere)\n\nUK, 2023, 4min Director: Seth Hughes This is a poetic visual ode to âwalking the noseâ. For the uninitiated, that means pulling off fluid dance moves as you cross-step back and forth along the top of your longboard while âloggingâ small waves. The result is a gorgeous art form that codifies grace and style. But knowing when to move forwards or back entails great skill. Apart from balance and poise, you need a carefully honed instinct for what part of your board is connecting with the wave. In that moment, you also need to read the energy of the wave, and how and where it is about to break. Either way, this sumptuous little film is a wonderful expression of this genre of water dancing.\n\nHUMANITY STOKED (SA Premiere)\n\nUS, 2023, 94min Director: Michael Cohen Itâs surprising we havenât seen a film like this before. Humanity Stoked is an experiment into how humanity can move forward, as espoused by the worldâs most iconic skateboarders, activists, scientists, artists, musicians, and educators all unified by unique experiences and perspectives shaped by their love of skateboarding. The film depicts how we can peacefully, openly, and intelligently advance humanity into the future. Conversations range from human rights and LGBTQ rights to racial equality. The protagonists speak of how we teach children about fear, environmental protection, giving back, and the value of science, art and music in education and to society. There are frank discussions around drug addiction and recovery, and mental health. An inspiring look at how humans can be empathetic to the world around them.\n\nCORNERS OF THE EARTH\n\nAfter two years planning a surf trip to remote east Russia, an hour their flight to Moscow, Russia invades Ukraine. This film has it all - Mi-8 helicopters, skidoos, and frozen campsites and bank accounts. The trip to Kamchatka (29 active volcanoes) was more than anyone could imagine. When the world saw the worst of human nature, these ous flew behind the iron curtain and found the best of it.\n\nSteve Pike aka Spike\n\nA BA Journalism (Hons) graduate of Rhodes University, Steve Pike, aka Spike, founded marine forecasting and ocean content website Wavescape.co.za in 1999, and co-founded the Wavescape Surf & Ocean Festival in 2004, one of the worldâs oldest surf film festivals, and now an important advocate for marine conservation and sustainable coastal management.

Using her surroundings as a point of departure, Heath draws on inspiration both natural and relational. Heathâs desire is to recreate, analyse and deconstruct sensation. When working with such thick paint, the challenge of finding the right balance between confident brush and palette knife strokes and moments of vulnerability becomes integral to Heathâs process, with the continuous rearrangements of colours and forms lifting and enhancing each other, layer upon layer. The work reflects an obsessive urge to find the right combination of colour, line and shape. As Heath explains: âI find the elements of surprise and unexpected accidental moments exciting, and when the accidental meets the intentional it often leads to the identity of the work coming unto its own.â\n\nLee-Ann Heath has a love for impasto oil paint, nature and connection.

While fear initially drew him to octopuses, he soon mastered handling them, turning it into playtime. Today, his fascination endures, and Jero still disappears for hours, reliving his childhood underwater. Despite facing criticism for eating octopus, Jero takes immense pleasure in the skillful hunt, honed over years, and adheres to a sustainable approach, only taking what he needs and returning unused portions to the ocean. During a dive, a divine inspiration led him to consider alternative uses for octopus ink beyond culinary applications. Collaborating with Prof Inggs from Michaelis School of Fine Arts, Jero introduced the concept of creating prints using octopus ink. Invited to explore this idea at Michaelis, they experimented with screen prints but fell in love with Gyotaku, an ancient Japanese fisherman's technique of making ink prints on rice paper. Today, Jero crafts Gyotaku artworks from the fish he catches, utilizing ink from octopuses, chokkas, or cuttlefish. His work pays homage to the octopus, symbolizing satisfaction derived from the hunt, culinary exploration, and creative expression.\n\nJero Revett, a young enthusiast, found joy in exploring rock pools around False Bay, diving all day to interact with various marine life.

Invited to explore this idea at Michaelis, they experimented with screen prints but fell in love with Gyotaku, an ancient Japanese fisherman's technique of making ink prints on rice paper. Today, Jero crafts Gyotaku artworks from the fish he catches, utilizing ink from octopuses, chokkas, or cuttlefish. His work pays homage to the octopus, symbolizing satisfaction derived from the hunt, culinary exploration, and creative expression.\n\nAmy-Lee Tak is a self-taught artist with five years' experience as a professional painter.

His work takes form in many media. Trained as a realistic oil painter, Lund also works in collage, murals, grafitti and surfboard art. His process starts in collage. Lund feels like this is the only way to correctly communicate the powerful combinations of cultural, social and environmental narratives that he wants his work to hold. Collage allows for rapid resolve of visuals, to create complex stories and to find humour in the strange juxtaposition of imagery. From collage, he translates the work onto canvases and walls, using a realistic style; be it in spray paint on wall, acrylic on surfboard or oil on canvas. Many of the visuals relate directly to his homeland, South Africa and are deeply personal, inspired by an awe of ethereal natural beauty, a will to celebrate diversity and a mind full of social critique.\n\nMarti Lund is an artist based in Cape Town, South Africa.

Her paintings and prints draw inspiration from the local landscape, its flora and colours. Images of proteas, fynbos and the familiar silhouette of Table Mountain recur in both her illustrative work and her more impressionistic canvas pieces. In subject, she returns often to her great grandmotherâs flower farm in Constantia from which the family was forcibly removed in the1960s under the Group Areas Act. Reflecting on her historical ties to the land, Amy explores themes of longing and belonging; her work a tender and intimate engagement with home. The places she paints are both real and imagined, a place to come back to â the body of a mother, a mountain, a field of flowers.\n\nAmy Ayanda Lester is an artist and musician based in Cape Town, South Africa.

After a few successful gallery exhibitions the travel bug bit and for ten years she only did graffiti writing, outdoor murals and public art festivals, mainly in Europe and in the US. Sheâs a member of the notable graffiti crew 40HK and one of the first white women to paint graffiti in post-apartheid South Africa. Black South Africans were the first to embrace Hip Hop culture through political/conscious rap and dance before ânon-politicalâ graffiti popularised in the late 1990âs. When she started painting in 2003 she chose the name Misty to highlight her female identity but she soon adopted the name MOTELSEVEN. Oftentimes feeling like a social âmisfitâ, graffiti subculture became the world in which she explored herself with indulgence and without explanation. The utilization of a gender-neutral tag like MOTELSEVEN allows graffiti writers and street artists to communicate a message and exercise their artistry without the stigma associated with their gender in everyday life. (From Routledge Handbook of Graffiti and Street Art by Jeffrey Ian Ross published in 2016).\n\nMOTELSEVEN (b. 1987) is a Cape Town born artist who started painting graffiti at 16 and had her first solo exhibition at the age of 21.

One. chose a different path for himself. Shapes and structures are deeply embedded in One.âs DNA, he see life as a complex layered structure we have to navigate through and make sense of, at least we can try. Employing the very same spray paint and markers synonymous with graffiti and tagging, One. seamlessly integrates urban culture and street life as strata within his paintings. Patterns converge, colors interplay, resulting in what he regards as Architectural Abstract.\n\nWhile qualified as an architect, One. never ventured into the practice of architecture.

Justin's works are held in various private and corporate collections around the world and His works have been exhibited in South Africa, Australia and Germany. Justin Southey's practice explores notions of landscapes and fantastical worlds that serve as metaphors for more unquantifiable emotional and spiritual spaces. Acting like ephemeral mirages, the artist's ambition is to explore and capture the intertwining and transcendent quality of the unseen. Capturing momentary feelings in a visual form, these investigations are both deeply personal and also often made in response to his immediate environment. With playful bold swathes of colour, texture and exuberant mark making, there is a push and pull the viewer experiences, directing the eye and stimulating the senses.\n\nBorn in rural South Africa in 1985 He majored in photography graduating Cum Laude from Stellenbosch Academy of Graphic Design and Photography (2007), with a BA in Applied Design.
