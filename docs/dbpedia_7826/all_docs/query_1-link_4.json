        "text": "'Beating the Odds' carnival to benefit CAP\n\n'Beating the Odds' - described as a \"celebration of chance, luck and choice\" - is a multimedia carnival bringing together Cape Town's top DJs, artists and performers with music, contests, interactive art, fire dancing, giant puppets, fortune telling, body painting, carnival sideshows, weddings, spray art and other random bits of creative goodness.\n\nSound and art will be provided by Vernon Adams from GHFM, Azuhl from Brasse Vannie Kaap, Warren Lissack, James Webb, Paco Rodriguez and other special guests. Spin the wheel, pick a card or throw a dart to win prizes including microlight flights, scuba diving trips, kayak trips, paintball vouchers, indoor grand prix racing, drum lessons, horseback riding, theatre tickets, massages, yoga and belly dancing classes and dinner at some of Cape Town's top restaurants - Five Flies, Don Pedro, Savoy Cabbage, Africa Café, Café Ganesh and Café Paradiso.\n\nAll proceeds will go to benefit the ongoing work of the Community Arts Project which has been providing equal opportunity education in the visual and performing arts since 1977. CAP empowers over 100 young artists each year to beat the odds and pursue their ambitions as painters, actors, thinkers and activists.\n\nSaturday November 3 from 8pm\n\nThe Valve, Die Groote Kerk Gebou, Parliament Street\n\nTickets R40 at the door\n\nCAP fundraising cocktail party\n\nThe Community Arts Project (CAP) has been a vital part of the arts and culture landscape of Cape Town since 1977, teaching visual and performing arts to talented young adults from all backgrounds. CAP is presently experiencing funding difficulties. Foreign funds that support the main work of the organisation have been radically reduced, with the expectation that South African funders will take up the task. This expectation is not being met fast enough to support CAP's ongoing work, and the organisation faces the very real possibility of closure. CAP shouldn't become another great programme to die from lack of funding. Several events have been planned to raise funds and support the ongoing work of this important organisation. All proceeds go to running the programmes at CAP.\n\nFinance Minister Trevor Manuel, ballet dancer Phyllis Spira, cartoonist Jonathan Shapiro, art journalist Gary van Dyk, dancer/choreographer Christopher Kindo, artist Willie Bester and other arts celebrities will be guests at a cocktail party at the Town House on Greenmarket Square. In addition, CAP is raffling off a classic VW Beetle, tickets for which cost R20 each, or R50 for 3. These are available at CAP and any event they host, including this cocktail party. The draw will be held on November 23.\n\nTickets are R200 per person or R1 000 for 6, and are available at CAP.\n\nThursday November 1 at the Town House, Greenmarket Square\n\nCAP, 106 Chapel Street, Woodstock Tel: (021) 465 3689 Email: cap@iafrica.com Website: www.museums.org.za/cap\n\nSanell Aggenbach at Bell-Roberts Art Gallery\n\nEntitled 'From a Netherworld', Sanell Aggenbach's figurative paintings invite the audience to engage in a \"voyeuristic journey\". The \"netherworld\" to which she refers is the compromised position of the artist as she opens herself up for scrutiny by the viewer. Aggenbach also explores notions of private and public, painting semi-nude figures whose black underwear, she says, controls \"the disclosed information\". The naturalistic figures are offset by simple two-dimensional designs in the works which create a tension between real and illusionistic space.\n\nOpening Wednesday October 24 at 6.30pm\n\nClosing: November 23\n\nBell-Roberts Art Gallery, 199 Loop Street, Cape Town\n\nTel: (021) 422 1100\n\nFax: (021) 423 3135\n\nEmail: suzette@bell-roberts.com\n\nWebsite: www.bell-roberts.com\n\nHours: Mon - Fri 8.30am - 5pm, Sat 10am - 1pm\n\nBLAC workshop on Latinism at District Six Museum\n\nBLAC (Black Artists' Collective) presents a last set of events for the year, bringing together arts, culture, media and heritage professionals who share an interest in developing discourse about culture in this region. On Tuesday October 23 an informal workshop will take place around the concept of Latinism and the influence (historically and in the future) of Latin America and the Caribbean on Southern African arts and culture. This follows a successful August 2001 workshop by the District Six Museum. A video of the Rio Carnival will be shown and Valmont Layne, Vince Kolby and Zayd Minty, among others, will talk about Brazil, Cuba and the Caribbean. The event will look at identifying resources in the city to continue an exploration into Latinism. This session is also run in conjunction with the Cape Town festival which plans to have a strong Latin, African and Asian connection in the future.\n\nBLAC is a discourse-building project which has existed since late 1998 and has run a number of seminar/lecture series, a website project BLACONLINE (www.blac.co.za), and a public art project ('Returning the Gaze'). In mid-2002 BLAC will be going through a transformation, resulting in changes to its name as well as a refocus on its mandate of running lectures/seminars and publishing new writings and ideas about arts, culture and heritage.\n\nTuesday October 23, 5.30 - 7.30pm\n\nDistrict Six Museum, Buitenkant Street, Cape Town\n\nTel: 083 530 1912 (Zayd Minty)\n\nEmail: one@intekom.co.za\n\nWebsite: www.blac.co.za\n\nRoelof Louw - 'Made for USA' at Bell-Roberts Art Gallery\n\n'Made for USA' is the title of Roelof Louw's second one-person exhibition in Cape Town in the last few years. Louw claims that some time ago he was drawn to desecrate an American flag. As much an individual response to \"American cultural imperialism\", Louw says this gesture referred to \"deep feelings of general oppression within myself\" and probably resulted from the \"transference of a personal rage against untoward authority\". The image of an American flag assumes even greater significance in light of the recent terror attacks and subsequent American response in Afghanistan.\n\nLouw studied at St Martin's School of Art, London, where he later taught and was appointed Director of Studies for Sculpture. During this period he represented England at the Tokyo Biennial and was included on the British 'Avante Garde' exhibition at the New York Cultural Centre. He has contributed articles and essays to Artforum, Studio International and other publications, and served as a visiting lecturer at various art colleges and universities. Louw often returned to Cape Town, his birthplace, for brief periods over the years. In the late Eighties he decided to stay and set up a studio here. He has since exhibited at the Hänel Gallery, Cape Town; Art Cologne 1999 and the Whitechapel Gallery, London. Louw has work in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Tate Gallery, London.\n\nOpening: Friday October 19 at 5.30pm\n\nClosing: October 23\n\nBell-Roberts Art Gallery, 199 Loop Street, Cape Town\n\nTel: (021) 422 1100\n\nFax: (021) 423 3135\n\nEmail: suzette@bell-roberts.com\n\nWebsite: www.bell-roberts.com\n\nHours: Mon - Fri 8.30am - 5pm, Sat 10am - 1pm\n\nTheo Vorster and Johan Coetzee at Sanlam Art Gallery\n\nTheo Vorster and Johan Coetzee are both established printmakers. Both are known for the fact that their subject matter is directly derived from their respective environments. Each, however, brings a very different perspective to bear. Vorster's landscapes are populated by weird and fun-filled characters who engage with the landscape in a happy-go-lucky way, creating a carnivalesque universe. Coetzee's work, in contrast, is more naturalist, illustrative and engages with the stillness of the West Coast and Karoo countryside.\n\nThe artists will give printmaking demonstrations in the gallery during the course of the exhibition. These take place from noon to 2pm on October 17, 23, 31 and November 8.\n\nOpening: Tuesday October 16 at 6.30pm\n\nClosing: November 9\n\nSanlam Art Gallery, 2 Strand Road, Bellville\n\nTel: (021) 947 3165\n\nFax: (021) 947 3838\n\nHours: Mon - Fri 9am - 4.45pm\n\nLize Hugo, Sally Arnold and Committee's Choice at the AVA\n\nCape Town painter Lize Hugo shows a new body of work entitled 'Contact Zone' in the main gallery. The work takes its cue from a point at the westerly edge of Sea Point where a distinctive stone formation reaches into the Atlantic Ocean. An explanatory plaque reads: \"The rocks between this plaque and the sea reveal an impressive contact zone of dark slate with pale intrusive granite.\" Hugo's uniformly small oil paintings of scenes along the beachfront, from that landmark towards Mouille Point, document the vibrancy of the many different people and cultures that frequent this strip. Hugo draws a parallel between the geological and cultural diversity of the area, paying heed to the \"dark slate\" and \"pale, intrusive granite\".\n\nHugo was born in Potchefstroom and has studied in Pretoria and Cape Town. She has been exhibiting since 1979 and held her first one-person show in 1981. She has curated several exhibitions, notably 'Oos Wes Tuis Bes' at the Klein Karoo Kunstefees in 1999.\n\nIn the long gallery Sally Arnold exhibits a collection of 2D works entitled 'The Cardinals'. The title refers to the stellar system by which navigation is made possible. Her personal interpretation of this set of co-ordinates is based on symbols found in earliest archaeological records of Old Europe, which she believes to be common, if yet \"unknown\" to the African continent. European artifacts from this time bear traces of the earliest form of writing and are often said to reveal an ancient matriarchal culture which has shown no traces of violent conflict or war. Arnold's paintings are made with iridescent paint and other light-reflecting materials.\n\nArnold was born in the Eastern Cape in 1954, and now lives and works between there and Luxembourg, having studied in Cape Town and Germany. She has exhibited in Europe and South Africa and her work is to be found in private collections in Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden and South Africa.\n\n'Committee's Choice' on the Artsstrip is an annual selection of single works by current members of the AVA committee. This year artists include William Kentridge, Jacques Dhônt, Fritha Langerman, Holly Birkby, Justine Mahoney and Michael Pettit.\n\nOpening: Monday October 15 at 6pm\n\nClosing: November 3\n\nAssociation for Visual Arts, 35 Church Street, Cape Town\n\nTel: (021) 424 7436\n\nFax: (021) 423 2637\n\nEmail: avaart@iafrica.com\n\nWebsite: www.ava.co.za\n\nHours: Tue - Fri 10am - 5pm, Sat 10am - 1pm\n\nMoo Do Interactive at the Hänel\n\nHosted by Stefan Blom and Seamus Wilson, the Hänel's annual interactive spring event will see participants decorating a large fibreglass cow, destined to be part of the C3 Cape Cow Carnival. The carnival has its origins in Switzerland, where artists and others were invited to decorate fibreglass cows sponsored by companies. The results attracted throngs of tourists to Zurich. Chicago, New York and Kansas City followed suit, each chalking up successful events of their own. Cape Town is attempting to produce a herd of 200, which will be exhibited around the city in the summer. The Hänel has procured sponsorship from Claire Bourquin Recruitment Consultants and Corporate Gift with a Conscience. Uniquely, the Hänel's design is not yet known to their sponsors. This event will be broadcast on the gallery's website, www.hanelgallery.com.\n\nThe C3 Cape Cow Carnival runs from December 2001 to February 2002.\n\nSunday October 14 at 6pm\n\nHänel Gallery, 84 Shortmarket Street, Cape Town\n\nTel: (021) 423 1406\n\nFax: (021) 423 5277\n\nEmail: ehaenel@compuserve.com\n\nWebsite: www.hanelgallery.com\n\nHours: Tues - Fri 11am - 5pm, Sat 10am - 2pm\n\nMichaelis lunchtime lecture on African-American art\n\nDavid Driskell, one of the world's leading authorities on African-American art, will give a lecture titled 'African-American art: Past, present and future'. Driskell has taught art at Talladega College, Howard and Fisk Universities, all historically black educational institutions, and at the University of Maryland. He has held the position of Visiting Professor of Art at Bowdoin College, University of Michigan, Queens College, and Obafemi Awolowo in Ile-Ife Nigeria.\n\nDriskell has authored five exhibition books and 40 catalogues on African-American art exhibitions he has curated. These include Two Centuries of Black American Art: 1750-1950; Hidden Heritage: Afro-American Art 1800-1950; and African American Visual Aesthetics: A Postmodernist View. His most recent book covers the Bill and Camille Cosby Collection of African American Art and is titled The Other Side of Color.\n\nDriskell is also a prolific painter, and designed 65 stained-glass windows for the Deforest Chapel at Talladega College, Alabama, where he took his up first teaching assignment. In 2000 Driskell was awarded the National Endowment for the Humanities Medal.\n\nWednesday October 3, 1.15-2.15pm\n\nMichaelis Lecture Theatre, Michaelis Building, 31-37 Orange Street, Cape Town\n\nTel: (021) 480 7111\n\nEmail: cperez@hiddingh.uct.ac.za\n\nNkoali Eausibius at DC Art\n\nEntitled 'Reflections of Truth', Nkoali Eausibius' exhibition of charcoal drawings focuses largely on township life and his experience as a gold miner. He spent several years working underground at various Free State mines, and it was the witnessing of his team leader's death in a rockfall which inspired him to take up his charcoal. He studied at Technikon Free State where he obtained his B Tech in Fine Art earlier this year. He has taught extensively and completed a number of commissioned murals, and a collection of his work is to be found in the offices of the National Union of Mineworkers in Johannesburg. Eausibius has shown at several venues in Gauteng and the Free State, notably at the Oliewenhuis Art Museum in Bloemfontein.\n\nOpening: Monday October 1 at 6pm\n\nClosing: October 26\n\nDC Art, Riebeeck Square, corner Bree and Church streets, Cape Town\n\nTel: (021) 423 6939\n\nFax: (021) 422 1768\n\nHours: Mon - Fri 10am - 5pm, Sat 10am - 1pm\n\nLyndi Sales at João Ferreira Fine Art\n\nPrintmaker Lyndi Sales exhibits 'Ancestral Journeys', the body of work she made for her Masters degree at Michaelis and which was shown at the Goodman Gallery earlier this year. Sales constructs an individual identity through complex formal and conceptual devices, bringing together both oral history and documents from her family archives. The work makes repeated reference to the 16th century, or the \"age of curiosity\" as she calls it, the period during which the museum originated. The work takes the form of printed paper ephemera housed in cabinets reminiscent of 16th century curiosity cabinets. These objects make further reference to 19th century paper theatres. Central to each of these tableaux is the journey of the ship, and themes of travel, exploration and collecting. The result of this multi-layering is a collection of rich and complex works which place Sales' ancestors' incomplete narratives into the broader context of the \"journey\" as a popular theme in literature and poetry.\n\nSales was born in 1973. She has won several awards and prizes for her work and has taken part in various national and international exhibitions. Her work is included in a number of South African corporate collections as well as public collections in the US.\n\nOpening: Wednesday October 3 at 6pm\n\nClosing: November 3\n\nJoão Ferreira Fine Art, 80 Hout Street, Cape Town\n\nTel: (021) 423-5403 or 082 490-2977\n\nFax: (021) 423-2136\n\nEmail: joao@iafrica.com\n\nWebsite: www.artjoao.co.za\n\nHours: Tue - Fri 10am - 6pm, Sat 10am - 2pm\n\nDiek Grobler at the Chelsea Gallery\n\n'Man under Construction' is the title given to this exhibition by Pretoria artist Diek Grobler, which showcases the influence on his work of a four-month stay at the Cit&eacute Internationale des Arts in Paris. The title refers both to Grobler's development as an artist, and his view of the human condition. Touching on various themes, including religion/spirituality, sexual politics and social issues, the works in oil, gouache and collage reflect Grobler's involvement in performance art and avant-garde theatre (Grobler has his own performance company, Fopspeen Live Art). He will also be showing two animated films, Idea and Le Voyage, or Herr Dürer's dog is barking up the wrong tree again.\n\nGrobler obtained his Masters in Fine Arts from the University of the Witwatersrand in 1996. He has exhibited professionally since 1988 and his work is included in several major public and corporate collections. Grobler has exhibited extensively on solo and curated shows and national competitions. He has also illustrated a number of children's books.\n\nOpening: Tuesday October 2 at 6pm\n\nClosing: October 20\n\nChelsea Art Gallery, 51 Waterloo Rd, Chelsea-Wynberg\n\nTel: (021) 761 6805\n\nFax: (021) 761 6805\n\nEmail: chelsea-gallery@mweb.co.za\n\nWebsite: http://home.mweb.co.za/ch/chelsart/gallery\n\nHours: Tues - Fri 9.30 am - 5.30pm, Sat 9.30am - 1pm\n\n'Narratives' - Omar Badsha at the SA National Gallery\n\n'Narratives: Rituals and Graven Images - A photographic commentary by Omar Badsha' comes to the South African National Gallery just as 'Imperial Ghetto', Badsha's photographic diary of people and places in the Grey Street area of Durban, draws to a close at the Durban Art Gallery.\n\nBadsha played an active role in the South African liberation struggle as a cultural and political activist and trade union leader. In 1979 his first book of photographs, Letter to Farzanah, published to commemorate the International Year of the Child, was banned. In 1982 he was instrumental in establishing Afrapix, the now legendary independent photographers' agency and collective. In 1984 his book on life in the massive informal settlements of Inanda outside Durban was published. Also during the 1980s Badsha headed the photographic unit of the Second Carnegie Inquiry into Poverty and Development in Southern Africa, and edited the seminal book on life in South Africa in the 1980s, South Africa: The Cordoned Heart.\n\nSince 1965 he has exhibited widely at home and internationally. Badsha lives in Pretoria and is the director of South African History Online, an internet education project on South African history.\n\nThe opening of the exhibition coincides with the launch of six titles in the SISA book series edited by Abebe Zegeye.\n\nOpening: September 20 at 6 for 6.30pm with speaker Jakes Gerwel\n\nClosing: November 18\n\nSouth African National Gallery, Government Avenue, Company Gardens, Cape Town\n\nTel: (021) 465 1628\n\nFax: (021) 461 0045\n\nWebsite: www.museums.org.za/sang\n\nHours: Tues - Sun 10am - 5pm\n\n'Surviving the Lens' at the SA National Gallery\n\n'Surviving the Lens: Photographic Studies of South and East African People, 1870-1920' comprises a selection of 50 photographs from the Michael Graham-Stewart and Michael Stevenson Collection. The exhibition is intended to offer an opportunity to re-evaluate colonial photography of this time and region, when indigenous people were subjected to the exploitative lens of the European traveller, tourist, scientist and commercial photographer. The selection spans work by both amateurs and professionals, with images taken in studios as well as in the field. As the press release states, these images can be seen as art, ethnography, anthropology, amateur snapshots or visual souvenirs, and sometimes even pornography. The opening coincides with the launch of a book with the same title.\n\nOpening: September 24 at 12.30 for 1pm\n\nClosing: November 15\n\nSouth African National Gallery, Government Avenue, Company Gardens, Cape Town\n\nTel: (021) 465 1628\n\nFax: (021) 461 0045\n\nWebsite: www.museums.org.za/sang\n\nHours: Tues - Sun 10am - 5pm\n\n'Birds of a Feather' at the SA National Gallery\n\n'Birds of a Feather' draws on the diverse collections of Iziko Museums of Cape Town to explore the world of birds - how they have fascinated artists, scientists, writers, ornithologists and musicians, and inspired works of art in which they feature as realistic images, objects of beauty and mystery, and symbols of another world. The exhibits range from stuffed birds to sculpted forms in different media, African masks to Meissen porcelain, decorative objets to paintings and drawings, and even live owls in the atrium. Cross-references are also made to other museums such as the Slave Lodge and the South African Museum. Jill Joubert, of the Frank Joubert Art and Design Centre, will lead an education and creative project for learners. Artworks produced will be exhibited in the Annexe Gallery, to be opened on December 8 at 11.30am by Minister of Education Kader Asmal.\n\nOpening: September 24 at 12.30 for 1pm\n\nThe exhibition will remain on view until early next year\n\nSouth African National Gallery, Government Avenue, Company Gardens, Cape Town\n\nTel: (021) 465 1628\n\nFax: (021) 461 0045\n\nWebsite: www.museums.org.za/sang\n\nHours: Tues - Sun 10am - 5pm\n\nPaul du Toit at Bell-Roberts Art Gallery\n\nRecent DaimlerChrysler Prize nominee Paul du Toit presents a show of new paintings and metal sculptures. Du Toit's work has been on something of a European journey over the last two years, with showings in England, Scotland and The Netherlands. He will exhibit in Zeist, Holland, again later this year and at the 2001 Florence Biennale, for which he has been selected by the director, Professor John T Spike. This is the first of his shows to include an extensive body of sculptures, which he feels are more integrated with his paintings than ever before.\n\nOpening: Monday September 17 at 6.30pm\n\nClosing: October 18\n\nBell-Roberts Art Gallery, 199 Loop Street, Cape Town\n\nTel: (021) 422 1100\n\nFax: (021) 423 3135\n\nEmail: suzette@bell-roberts.com\n\nWebsite: www.bell-roberts.com\n\nHours: Mon - Fri 8.30am - 5pm, Sat 10am - 1pm\n\nJuliet Armstrong and Terence King at the US Art Gallery\n\nJuliet Armstrong and Terence King are both members of staff of the University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg. King previously taught at Wits University and is well known for his paintings which allude both to the landscape and the abstract. Armstrong's work in porcelain, as well as her research into Zulu pottery, have earned her quite a reputation. Both of them last showed work in the Western Cape at the exhibition by students and staff of the University of Natal at Michaelis last year.\n\nOpening: Tuesday October 16 at 6pm\n\nClosing: October 26\n\nUS Art Gallery, corner of Dorp and Bird streets, Stellenbosch\n\nTel: (021) 808 3524\n\nEmail: usmuseum@maties.sun.ac.za\n\nHours: Mon - Fri 9am - 5pm, Sat 9am - 1pm"
