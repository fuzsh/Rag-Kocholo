        "text": "2. 2\n\n3. 1 In an environment where art competitions come and go, I am proud to be the patron of Absa L ’Atelier’s 23rd competition. It’s not only the oldest art award in the Southern hemisphere, it is also the richest in Africa. And it remains the most prestigious award on any South African artist’s CV. Aimed at nurturing young talent, Absa L ’Atelier has been instrumental in launching many careers in the visual arts. A number of the ﬁnalists have developed into success stories. Last year, the Alliance Française, the French Institute and the French Embassy renewed its sponsorship of the Gerard Sekoto Award for the most promising artist with an income of less than R60 000 per annum. We thank them for their continued support for L ’Atelier and their investment in our young artists. Further testimony to the success of our competition is the steady rise in the quality of works entered. This year the standard was exceptionally high, and the judges had their work cut out to select the ﬁnalists, the merit award winners and the two top awards. We at Absa also pay close attention to the concerns our young people communicate through their art. It is quite moving how articulate they are in the visual form they give to the challenges they face.Violence and crime is still highly prevalent in their work. Lately issues of identity started surfacing, and this year a deep inner search was reﬂected in this regard. I would like to congratulate all of the winners. Make the most of this opportunity to further your careers. And to all the others:apply the valuable experience you have gained, and keep up the good work.We hope to meet you again next year!

Published by Absa, member of the Barclays Group. 2008 Absa L ’Atelier Awards Catalogue ISBN 978-0-620-41294-0 National selection panel The Absa L ’Atelier Art Competition is presented annually by Absa in conjunction with SANAVA (South African National Association for the Visual Arts). It is a competition for young artists in the age group 21 to 35 years.Works of art were selected in Bellville, Bloemfontein, Durban, Johannesburg, East London, Port Elizabeth, Polokwane, Pretoria and Thohoyandou by a local panel of selectors guided by Celia de Villiers on behalf of the National President of SANAVA.The selected works of art have been sent to Johannesburg for ﬁnal adjudication. The Absa L ’Atelier Award\n\n5. 3 Introduction Art gives us the opportunity to reappraise the ambiguities,which surround us and give new meaning to them. In the Absa L ’Atelier Awards,this happens through a democrat- ic process of adjudication,which involves analytical viewing,interpretation,appraisal and the selection of artworks. Final decisions are based on socially determined factors such as the juror’s ethnicity,gender,knowledge of formal art principles and a familiar- ity with contemporary international art trends. Owing to these differences,there are often disagreements,although this year’s winner was a unanimous choice. Once the selection has been made,the opinions of jurors are transferred to the viewers,resulting in the notion that the selected artworks are objects of value. This valuation is not only reliant on the juror’s understanding of the orthodoxies of a particular moment in the history of a society,but also an understanding of the viewer and the artist. The young artists who enter competitions like the Absa L’Atelier Awards do not merely produce artworks. They manipulate contemporary cultural signs.They reﬂect the chal- lenge of deﬁning and measuring the effectiveness of a sense of self within dominant socio-cultural myths and media. For many artists,conveying meaning through the presentation,measuring and shaping of attitudes and beliefs results in a confronta- tion of their personal fears.In 2008 this process of osmosis has revealed the current thematic concerns of prohibition and transgression. With the unstable regulation of social order in South Africa at present,it seems deeply human for the average citizen to have an idealised,unrealistic and mythi- cal desire to be in a situation of predictable unity and stability. The current surge of transgression against this impulse is reﬂected in numerous artworks. Two primary taboos,death and sexuality, emerged repeatedly in all the adjudicated regions. Another theme this year was the acceleration of violence and its inﬂuence on young people. These trends might be explained by the 20th century French writer Georges Bataille,who has drawn attention to the inevitable connection between the horror of death and eroticism,since both deal with mortality.The fear of death and pain is the opposite of pleasure,whereas eroticism holds the promise of the abolition of limits and eventual immortality. The exponential presence of crime and the AIDS pandem- ic ensures that these thoughts pervade the consciousness of most contemporary South Africans. The narratives of the artists included in this show,many of which are poetic in nature,evidence an emotional eroticism, which has today perhaps become more dependable than physical eroticism. To condense the selection of the 23rd Absa L ’Atelier Awards,one need only examine the judges’criteria. It is hoped that the works on show will be found to be authentic, sincere and socially relevant,possessing integrity and a unique South African ﬂavour. Celia de Villiers Coordinator\n\n6. 4 It is a singular privilege and with great satisfaction that I, on behalf of the South African National Association for the Visual Arts (SANAVA), may extend a word of warm appreciation to Absa, and its relevant personnel, for having organised this very successful 23rd Absa L ’Atelier Competition, hosted in collaboration with SANAVA. The sustained efforts by Absa in promoting the development of the visual arts, and in particular the artistic potential of all young South African artists, whose talents should be stimulated or roused from its slumber, are indeed highly valued. I pay tribute to all participants in this esteemed, long running national competition, and congratulate those whose outstanding merit will be recognised.To those who have not been fortunate enough, this time, to be selected for the top team, I wish to say‘bon courage’for next time. And to the judges, country-wide,‘many, many thanks’for the time that you have sacriﬁced during the adjudication process.Your contribution is much appreciated. Anton Loubser National President, SANAVA Absa L ’Atelier Competition : 2008\n\n7. 5 Gerard Sekoto Award Gerard Sekoto (1913 – 1993) Sekoto was born at Botshabelo near Middelburg in the former Transvaal on 9 December 1913. His early paintings depicted scenes from Sophiatown, District Six and Eastwood near Pretoria. He left South Africa in 1947 for Europe and settled in Paris in volun- tary exile where he lived until his death in 1993. As an African Parisian he always yearned for his South African roots and identity, which he depicted with much nostalgia in many of his works. In Paris and with the support of the French loving public, doors even- tually opened for Sekoto to explore his own creativity.With this award we honour Gerard Sekoto.The French Embassy, the French Institute and the Alliance Française, felt it appropriate to create such an award to support the most promising artist with an income of less than R60 000 per annum.This award will hopefully open yet another door for a young South African artist in the city of love and art,namely Paris.\n\n8.

Description of artwork: The Rabbit-women were made without a predetermined theme or concept and came from the artist’s subconscious dream state.The human-animal hybrid seems to embody the mixed symbolism and incongruities that occur in dream states. The overtly feminine rabbits have a strong resonance of fragility and vulner- ability.This is evident in the heavily preg- nant stomachs and the precariousness of the rabbits’relationship to the ground. Pregnancy could be a dual metaphor for the anticipation of subconscious thoughts that seem to grow and emerge in one’s dreams and of the cavities in which one hides and hibernates.

The overtly masculine birds seem to speak of vulnerability that, although they appear proud and powerful, they actually are quite impotent in their inability to ﬂy – as their arms merge into amorphous,ﬂightless wings.\n\n18. 16 Arthur, Kate East London Untitled (Father) Oil on canvas 200cm x 149cm\n\n19. 17 Profile: Arthur was born in 1985. She studied BA(FA) at Rhodes University,Grahamstown and is currently reading for an MA(FA) at Rhodes University,Grahamstown. Description of artworks: The two larger-than-life portraits of the artist’s parents were painted in an exercise of dedication to examine and explore the geography of two faces she knows so well. Yet at the same time she has difﬁculty penetrating the psyche of the individuals (hence the closed eyes), because it is only now, as she is becom- ing an adult, that she realises that her mother and father are not just parents but unique individuals. Painting their faces in this manner was part of a pro- cess to understand them, herself and their relationship.

Bissett, Diederik Johannes Müller Pretoria Oranje, blanje, blou Graphic print 93cm x 150cm Description of artwork: The graphic print resembles a ﬂag due to its format, which derived from a still frame animation.The animation consisted of three separate panels, which functioned independently as well as inter-dependently.The print does not contain all the images but only sections thereof. Although the title points to po- litical undertones, it can be experienced as a fun piece.\n\n21. 19 Profile: Botha was born in 1985 and studied BA(FA) at the University of the Free State, Bloemfontein. She is currently reading for an MA(FA) at the University of the Free State, Bloemfontein. Description of artwork: The painting portrays two enlarged feet with ballet shoes. Conceptually the art- work comprises of the dialectic relation- ship between anti-theatricality in a space of theatrical performance.

She also obtained the BTech degree in Stained Glass cum laude at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, Port Elizabeth. Description of artwork: This body of work is based on an explora- tion into the theme of woman and vanity. As a medium, glass has an essential link to this association.Women, when looking in a mirror, can be said to gaze at themselves in a way that can be described as“looking to be looked at”, which allows them to con- struct a sense of self and femininity from a voyeuristic perspective.The four stained glass windows are symbolic of the daily battle between reﬂection and reality.These windows are mounted in baroque style mirror frames, suggestive of classical ideals and ornament.These frames have areas of translucency that suggest skin and the relationship between interior and exterior, body and beauty. The signiﬁcance of the work is to illustrate that women are routinely encouraged from an early age to take care of and main- tain the beautiful exterior that is vital to society’s concept of femininity.Women are encouraged to accept this attitude towards their gender and are further expected to behave and dress in a way that caters for this system.

Description of artwork: The work comprises an installation of six oil paintings with each painting depict- ing sparklers in the night.The paintings are executed on board and framed on the back in order not to overwhelm or distract anything from the ﬂeeting quality of the small works.The source material for the paintings were found on the Internet and translated into oil paint, a more formal manner of representation.

He also obtained an MA(VA) at the University of Pretoria. Description of artwork: These artworks consist of two close-up digital prints of decaying leather,printed back onto leather.The images were taken in Paul Kruger’s ofﬁce in Pretoria of his chair, now eerily silent and strangely empty.The ambiguity of passage ways and transitional spaces are used to construct an aesthetic of anticipation.The immaterial,allusive details of the images offer only a frame- work of association,signifying states of change,loss and absence.

She studied BA(FA) as well as MA(FA) at the University of the Free State, Bloemfontein. Description of artwork: De Beer focused her research on the raptures that occur in the continuity of family memories. Distorsie (Distortion) addresses aspects of memory preser- vation that deals with estrangement, anonymity, absence and mortality.The interplay between exposure and conceal- ment is used to examine the discontinu- ities in history and memory in the private and public spheres.‘Distorsie’invokes family history simultaneously as speciﬁc and universal and explores different variations of the past.

Description of artwork: The handkerchief and the roll of gauze both refer to the vulnerability of the body. Gauze is used in the attempt to protect a wound while the handkerchief is used to hide and clean up the bodily ﬂuids that may otherwise expose that which is unsanitary.Without these protective implements we would be in closer proximity to the animal.

He studied for the National Diploma in Fine Arts at the Technikon of the Witwatersrand as well as for the BTech (FA) degree at the Technikon of the Witwatersrand. He also completed a Master’s degree in Fine Arts at the University of the Witwatersrand. He has participated in several exhibitions, including the Absa Atelier Exhibition in 2000 as well as the Absa L ’Atelier Exhibitions in 2004 and 2006. Description of artwork: The boat is constructed from approximately 65 460 matchsticks on which the words‘I love her’were written on all four sides. This work focuses on two main ideas, the metaphor of the boat as the love between two people, sailing a river of life and the obsessive nature with which writing and construction has been carried out. The metaphor of the‘love boat’ traversing an ocean can be found in various examples in contemporary love songs.Through this work this metaphor is made physical.Where the fragile matchsticks construction mirrors the fragility of the love between two people and the match’s potential of ﬁre becomes passion.The river carrying the boat becomes life, through which the relationship has to navigate calm water as well as raging torrents while keeping together those it carries. Here the water as a base element stands in direct opposition to the element of ﬁre,as once was said ‘there is love and its enemy is life’.\n\n31. 29 Profile: Essop was born in 1985 and studied BA(FA) at the Michaelis School of Fine Art, University of Cape Town. Description of artwork: Kavali is the traditional name for this genre of music, predominantly Indian. The image presents the artist’s tradition and heritage that has been passed down by generations.Taken in Bo-Kaap (The noon gun), the environment creates the atmosphere for a spiritual calling.The music is played to strengthen one’s faith. Essop, Hasan Bellville Kavali Photographic print 88cm x 129cm\n\n32. 30 Profile: Essop was born in 1985 and studied BA(FA) at the Michaelis School of Fine Art, University of Cape Town. Description of artwork: The title of the work describes the group to which the uniform belongs.The image comments on the‘Coon’culture that exists strictly in Cape Town. It originated from the slaves who arrived in Cape Town with the Dutch occuption, of whom many were Muslim or converted to Islam. Not being allowed to practise their religion, they found ways to pray through song, and when questioned about it their response was that they were having a party. It has thus evolved over time and is still practised today, changed to suit the vibrant atmosphere of Cape Town.

She has participated in several exhibitions, including the Absa L ’Atelier Exhibition in 2007. Description of artwork: The work attempts to dissolve prevalent tendencies in contemporary art discourse, which force artworks to conform to academi- cally rigid readings. By refusing to supply the viewer with any absolute meaning, the work supports a more organic, ﬂuid approach in art discourse. It highlights the intangible aspects of art and compels the viewer to confront the work on a subconscious level rather than taking a theoretically loaded approach. Consequently the work invites the viewer to develop a totally subjective and personal interpretation, insisting that there is no ab- solute meaning to art as there is no absolute meaning to the world itself. Ferguson, Sophia Margaretha (Retha) Pretoria Dissolved course Photographic print 84cm x 116,5cm\n\n35. 33 Profile: Fourie was born in 1984 and studied for the National Diploma in Fine Arts at the Tshwane University of Technology, Pretoria. He is currently studying for the BTech(FA) degree at the Tshwane University of Technology, Pretoria. Description of artwork: The video captured a request sent from a cellphone to the I-ﬁnd Information Directory service. The request is to ﬁnd God. The primary concept behind the work is that in the daily information age in which we live, it is possible that one can experience divinity via something that is so second-hand and has been the by-product of mercantile-orientated business.We would rather surround ourselves with our own creations than what has existed for millennia.

Description of artwork: If is a portrait of the artist and his brother standing side by side. It was taken with a camera built by the artist himself. The camera has hundreds of lenses, which work together as a unit. Although each is unique in the way in which it lets the light into the camera, they share a common thread. This thread is a moment or a view that they witness together. In this case it is the event of the artist and his brother standing together. Next to the artist’s ghostlike image he appears as a faint trace, almost impossible to discern. If things had been different they may never have had the chance to share this moment as the artist only learnt that he had a brother when he was 25 years old. The myriad different images of them standing together is a suggestion of all the ‘ifs’ that surround their relationship. For each it is the ﬁrst step on a path to a tangled mess of speculation. Fuller, St John James Zair Johannesburg If Pinhole photography 155cm x 106cm\n\n37. 35 Description of artwork: Been there is a photograph of the Natural History Museum in Pretoria. It has been taken with a camera built by the artist himself. The camera has hundreds of lenses, which work together as a unit. Although each is unique in the way in which it lets the light into the camera, they share a common thread. This thread is a moment or a view that they witness together. In this case it is the museum and the skeleton that hangs outside the museum. The photograph can be seen as a busload of tourists who are disembarking. Each has a moment to look around, to take in the view. For some the ability to see and recollect clearly at a later stage is strong. The memory is deﬁnite but for others this is not the case.

She studied for the National Diploma in Fine Arts at the Technikon Free State, Bloemfontein. She also studied for the BTech (FA) degree at the Technikon Free State, Bloemfontein. She has participated in several exhibi- tions, including the Volkskas Bank Atelier exhibitions in 1996, 1997 and 1998. She also participated in the Absa Atelier Exhibition in 1999 and the Absa L ’Atelier Exhibition in 2002. Description of artwork: This work incorporates discarded and banal found objects, loaded with intima- tions of decay and degeneration. Redun- dant items, each at a different stage of decay, become the protagonist of death. Mites, dust and dirt also play an integral role in the process of death. In these works the hypothesis of the formerly valuable items comes into play, another metaphor for the status of death.

He obtained a certiﬁcate in Professional Photography at the New York Institute of Photography. He also studied BA(C&A) at Unisa, which he obtained with distinction. Description of artwork: Generate-mutate-translate expands the concept of algorithmic interaction to a macro scale: life-systems on earth are also subject to dynamically programmed algorithmic sets, which interact with each other: an example is genetic code, which in essence is a type of algorithmic procedure combining strands of DNA to produce a particular sequence of code (that generates a particular organism). Through the inﬂuence of the environ- ment and natural/artiﬁcial selection the best ‘algorithm’survives, enabling the organism to adapt and recreate. Generate-mutate-translate is a fantasy based upon this concept: algorithmically generated forms are mutated, hybridised and presented as an interactive species chart.

Pattern recognition as a concept is considered as one of the primary ingredients of machine intelligence (Theodoridis 2003:1).The work pattern recognition‘plays’with the notion of compulsive pattern recognition – a situation where the recognition algorithm does not necessarily have functional value, but instead exhibits characteristics akin to a phobia – as in the ﬁlm‘A beautiful mind’ (2001),where the main character exhibits negative side effects as a result of his extraordinary ability to recognise patterns. Pattern recognition ponders whether artiﬁcial intelligence could exhibit the same compulsive behaviour.

Description of artwork: Jansen van Vuuren’s work deals with contemporary portraiture, focusing on the angst, fears, apathy, joy, general concerns, pre-occupations and intimate thoughts of his subjects towards con- temporary living in South Africa. These concerns are interrogated through ﬁlmed interviews from which stills are isolated and edited to be used as source material for the paintings.

Description of artwork: Keith reworks the multifold, simulta- neous and confusing inner and outer realities experienced by young women of today.The impact and relevance of her paintings extend beyond the conﬁnes of any particular group. For it is the rapidly changing and ﬂuid character of identi- ties she is exploring. Selfhood appears to draw upon interplay and fusion of various inﬂuences, often rooted in agony – stemming not only from the artist’s personal experience, but perceived in the lives of others.

He focussed more on the Nigerians because they are often notorious and they stand out in a crowd because of their height and the clothes they wear. Many of them sell drugs in Johannesburg and therefore he tries to convey the way in which many South African people perceive the Nigerian people as criminals, and they are threatened by them.

The sculpture is stacked on bricks, in order to keep the short creature at bay. The‘Tokkelossie’is notorious for raping people in their beds while they are sleep- ing at night.The phenomenon strongly relates to small children being molested in their homes by family members.

Kruger, Marieke Bellville Hannah I Mixed media 34cm x 101cm Description of artwork: The artwork, which consists of a series of ﬁve prints, pays tribute to the artist’s grandmother who died in 1977. Kruger was only four years old at the time of her death, but she can still remember the personal encounters she had with her as a child. Much controversy surrounded her death at the time, seeing that she committed suicide.This artwork deals with issues surrounding physical, spiritual and emotional loss, her own identity as well as memories of her grandmother. She also explores issues concerned with the separation that comes with the death of a loved one.\n\n52. 50 Laue, Alhyrian Albert Bishop Port Elizabeth An evening of social tightrope walking Mixed media 180cm x 73cm x 60,5cm Profile: Laue was born in 1985 and studied for the National Diploma in Fine Arts at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, Port Elizabeth.

The cupboard which forms the sculp- ture’s body can be read as a vessel of alchemical process where opposites interweave in search of fusion.\n\n54. 52 Profile: Le Roux was born in 1973 and studied for the National Diploma in Fine Arts at the Technikon Pretoria.

Description of artwork: The subject matter concerns urban symbols.The medium is silk ribbons, which is associated with the awareness on social issues affecting primarily the vulnerable sectors of society namely women and children.These symbols are used as visual messages of protest against the turbulence and crisis, which has affected South Africa’s social structure and remains one of the greatest challenges of our times. The subject matter is a Protea, which is South Africa’s national flower. This symbol is used as a national road sign in South Africa to identify a conservation area. Conserving indigenous vegetation has become a priority in our country and she linked this element with the silk ribbon worn to generate awareness of three epidemics. The red ribbon creates awareness of HIV/Aids, whilst the white ribbon symbolises unity against abuse of women and children. The pink ribbon creates awareness of breast cancer amongst women.

Unlike plants, which blossom, bear fruit and die, human life is linear.We are different people at different times, as we grow and adapt we invent personal myths to make sense of the constant radical changes in the fast-paced world around us. Perhaps we are not evolved enough to live at this speed. In this video, images of the artist between the ages of ﬁfteen and twenty-eight built into sequences, which interrupt themselves, run backwards at times and blend into each other along the symmetrical growth cleft, which unites all mutations of sentient life.

Description of artwork: Marx worked with frozen bodies of water as surface for inscription. As a landscape intervention, the work involved the moving of stones in a wheelbarrow over a substantial distance, from the river Rhône to a leak in the heart of Bois de Finges in Sierre, Switzerland and the subsequent placing, writing with stone onto the precariously frozen surface of the water.The artwork employs palimpsest and erasure as device: in writing with stones on ice, I created a Freudian‘mystic writing pad’or‘perceptual apparatus’. The impact of the work is accentuated by one’s ability to envision the text being swallowed by the water as the ice melts.

As a term, pedestrian poetry is indicative of the manner in which pedestrians walk the city as a text, with‘walking’pointing to the narrative unfolding the text. In this sense, the speciﬁc locations chosen for the project are crucial; as one of the busi- est inner-city throughfares.Twist Street represents a dynamic combination of dif- ferent modes of movement, an exchange of different nationalities and a general space of cultural negotiation.

He has participated in several exhibitions, including the Absa L ’Atelier Exhibitions in 2006 and 2007, where he received a Merit Award. Description of artwork: A wetter nurse seeks to criticize the very thought processes that direct us toward, and no further than, these narrow conceptions.The work seeks to extend the critical faculties through a deliberate confrontation of the accepted and familiar with itself and by offering a certain amount of elucidation and then retracting and/or contradicting that rationalisation with another, equally valid, proposition.This condenses meaning in seemingly simple objects and relations, so as to implicate vast cultural and symbolic understanding, a process whereby the revealed obscures meaning, and the concealed presents opportunity for revelation.The soap is at once a reductive material, cleansing, purifying, and an effective remover of‘excessive’ fat, and conversely, it ﬁlls the desk, congesting it with a material fatty in itself, one which until recently consisted primarily of animal fats, a material regarded with some repulsion.

Description of artwork: Intent exists in a realm of opposites: male versus female, hard versus soft, integra- tion, border and line versus lack thereof, bright versus pale, sharp versus blunt, pattern and decoration versus dissolution and disorder.The intent of the artist is to make comment on postcolonial issues surrounding especially land and the infrastructure of land, but perhaps too, on many more subtle aspects of the postco- lonial condition.The tools can be seen to represent the actual‘tools’used as part of the demarcation process of colonial- ism, the dividing of land into bordered areas.These tools have been added to or softened in an act of defacement, but also to beautify and decorate, especially with pattern, to take their power as‘tools’ away and give a less harmful appearance.

She has participated in several exhibitions, including the Absa L ’Atelier in 2005. Description of artwork: Meyerov’s work explores the notion and transformation, through a cumulative labour intensive process, whereby the material itself physically undergoes a metamorphosis from a utilitarian object into an ambiguous substance suggestive of an organic, live structure. Colony comprises of thousands of used teabags, collected over a period of a year from various sources.These have been emptied, stained and restructured into ambiguous, hybrid like forms suggestive of tiny living organisms, which seem to hover indeterminately in a transitional, borderline state – either in process of birth and renewal or alternatively on the verge of death and subsequent decay.

Moys sees the Gautrain construction sites as sites of potential and of the future. They are always becoming, neither here nor there but in a state of transition. The somewhat futile act of digging whilst there are huge powerful graders surrounding her, demonstrates a feeling of helplessness or uselessness, which she thinks many South Africans are feeling currently.

A series of television stills from shows broadcast on Freedom Day, Norman alludes to a heritage – as well as a present – wrought by violence, violence often covered over in media spectacle and the contemporary celebration of nationhood (an idea echoed in Washkansky’s nationalistic symbolism).\n\n77. 75 Description of artwork: Norman’s most overt piece, Teach your children, is a sound installation of toy guns afﬁxed to a Perspex target, in which the viewer, triggering the sensor system, becomes the unwitting victim of violence – ﬁgured as child’s play through the sounds of children’s imitative shooting (‘Bang’;‘Boom’), which culminates in the sound of an actual gunshot and the ejection of an empty shell, followed by an eerie silence.

This collection of short stories is involved with the reworking and subverting popular, universal fairytales. Carter’s attempt at rediscovering the latent meaning and intention of these original tales, written by Charles Perrault and, subsequently, the Brothers Grimm, was inﬂuential in the production of Pokroy’s work. This series of three photographs depict the stories of Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Red Riding Hood.

After an advertisement which was placed in “Die Burger” on 16 February 2008, in which he questioned Afrikaner male identity, he received many calls. These calls were recorded and the artist’s function became that of voyeur where in privacy and anonymity, the viewer can listen in to these telephonic conversations.

Description of artwork: Consisting of 159 intricately cut SAA boarding passes, Shatter is an abstract pattern, which is derived from an image of cracks racing across a sheet of tempered glass. It shows the instant at the moment in which it is struck by a blunt metal plunger. This piece makes reference to the Helderberg plane crash of 1987 in which 159 people died, amongst which was her father. This was a controversial and unresolved incident brought up at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission where the blame was laid on the actions of the previous apartheid government. Shatter is also a contemplation on the parallels within macrocosms. Resembling an eye as well as a mandala, it represents the cosmos, the big bang, a vortex or a tunnel of light associated with a near death experience.

Description of artwork: In this work Schnugh tried to capture a moment in time in its purity, hence the simplicity of the work. By cropping the images in the way he has, it only gives the viewer a small clue as to what is happening in the work, hence creating a slight tension of intrigue and curiosity. It is this balance of simplicity and seemingly endless possibilities that he tries to achieve in his work.

Description of artwork: This work portrays the expectations we have regarding relationships and mar- riage. Relationships seem idyllic with a sugar coating while the reality is not always so sweet and idyllic.The round plastic balls represent the soap-bubble, which can easily burst.The work is fragile and represents the delicacy and sensitiv- ity of relationships.The cushions, which are covered with icing, represent the cushions you kneel on during the mar- riage ceremony and enhances the idea of the sugar-coated concept.

Description of artwork: The slow morphing of the image in the video Face it, depicts the long and tedi- ous process of the re-centring of the self. The image is being distorted at such a slow pace that it appears to be static with only slightly variating nuances. At any point during the video the image seems to be stagnant and that the distortion is complete. The same could be said about identities. At any point we feel that our identity is complete; we are in the moment who we are. Yet the distortion is continual. At no point is the image complete although it may appear so. Our identities are ever-changing.We are never the same person we were a moment ago. The image appears to be unmoving, yet after time elapsed, it is unrecognisable. The to and fro morphing of the self relays the instability of the ever-changing identity of the self. Do you still recognise yourself?\n\n93. 91 Profile: Steyn was born in 1980 and studied for a Diploma in Fashion Design at the Haute Couture School in Cape Town.

He also studied MA(FA) at the University of Stellenbosch. He has participated in several exhibitions, including the Absa L ’Atelier Exhibition in 2002. Description of artwork: Strydom’s interest lies in the complexity theory and ideas of inside vs. outside. Decay, decomposition, growth, rhythm and life turning on itself, formed the starting points for the marks he used. The work is also very much about mark- making, the process of drawing itself as well as the place of labour in making an art object.

Description of artwork: Van der Merwe’s work deals with the idea that if you dream big and you work towards your goal, it is possible to make your dreams come true. Her grandfather’s inﬂuence helped her to realise this. Her grandfather, who was a farmer, had a dream to breed horses and made it a reality through perseverance and hard work. The horse images she used in her paintings are direct links to this dream and message of hope and persistence.

Van Eeden,Wesley Description of artworks: The concept behind the artwork is to promote a positive attitude amidst the many apparent negative things happening in South Africa.With the experiences Van Eeden encountered with crime as well as with friends, family and work associates and many good things he has experienced living here, especially with his teaching of Graphic Design in KwaMashu in KwaZulu-Natal, he felt that he needed to convey a message of hope.

Van Staden, Pieter Schalk Pretoria Inspection Oil on board 40cm x 60cm Description of artwork: The marble tiles in the background depict the notion of healing and pain by bridg- ing a ﬁne line of restraint between the patient and the doctors. Here a critique of authority is noted in relation to that of institutions.Thus the confusion of heal- ing and pain is noted.\n\n103. 101 Profile: Van Tonder was born in 1985 and studied BA(FA) at the University of the Free State, Bloemfontein. Description of artwork: The work refers to Andy Warhol’s way of silkscreening the icon, Marilyn Monroe. According to the artist Monroe represents the origin of‘lost identity’. By representing the object and icon Hello Kitty in the same way, Kitty actually becomes more alive and develops an identity. In this day and age the division between human and object has disappeared. It is as if we glorify ‘lost identity’.

He also studied for the BTech(FA) degree at the Tshwane University of Technolgy, Pretoria. Description of artwork: With an intention of throwing some interesting shapes on the wheel, Vivier returned to nine digitally manipulated photographs taken of the 1963 ﬁlm entitled ‘The pink panther’. It was taken off a television screen. Out of each, the artist selected a small part. Since the act of throwing results in shapes that are symmetrical, Vivier mirrored these selected parts in order to make them ‘throwable’. He found the result to be surprising and very exciting, when he imagined these two-dimensional shapes in three-dimensional form.

She has participated in several exhibitions, including the Absa L ’Atelier Exhibition in 2007. Description of artwork: The sculpture Bird is a compilation of found objects, thus Duchampian Ready- mades.These found objects are present in its own identity and now taken from its essence in this context, to be born again as an individual object with its own identity and new context. These objects become something from without itself, something that is far from its origin and context given identity. These found objects gain life from their new purpose in being constructed and a compiled object, now in its new context as an artwork and for that its function and identity are reformed.\n\n110. 108 Wildenboer, Barbara Bellville Set adrift Mixed media 200cm x 200cm x 200cm Profile: Wildenboer was born in 1973 and stud- ied BA(Ed) at the University of Pretoria.

She has par- ticipated in several exhibitions, including the Absa L ’Atelier Exhibitions in 2003 and 2005. Description of artwork: The title of the work Set adrift is meant to be contradictory, referring both to an attempt to set or ﬁx things as well as to the inevitability of the disappearance of the very things that one attempts to secure. In this work the photographic process is applied in an attempt to capture that which is ﬂeeting and forever changing.The work consists of seven circular photographic images of clouds, each with a star constellation pinned onto the surface of the image as well as a mass of beach stones onto which images of dead ﬁsh collected from the beach were printed.The constellations used are those named after birds, such as Aquila: the eagle, Corvus: the crow, Cygnus: the swan and Grus: the crane.Wildenboer used images of clouds as she found them to be an effective means of expressing the sublime nature of inner experiences.\n\n111. 109 Profile: Ziqubu was born in 1974 and obtained a Public Relations Diploma.
