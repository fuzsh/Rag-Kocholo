        "text": "South African artist (born 1975)\n\nSanell Aggenbach (born 1975) is a South African artist living and working in Woodstock, Cape Town.[1] Using painting, printmaking, and sculpture, her work addresses the relationship between history and private narratives, with a sense of ambiguity.[2] Her work also explores the processes of nostalgia and historical myth-making,[3] often incorporating the playful, disarming, and absurd to draw the viewer into discussions of darker subjects. She has a unique style of combining traditional painting techniques with sculptural elements, as well as typically feminine crafts such as sewing and tapestry.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nAggenbach graduated from the University of Stellenbosch in 1997 with a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts.[4] Although now a full-time artist, Aggenbach was a lecturer from June 2000– March 2004 at the Cape College in Graphic Processes, Two-Dimensional Design and Drawing.[3] Her work is represented in the Spier Collection, Anglo Gold South Africa, Sasol Art Museum, the Sasol Collection, and the Hollard Collection.[1]\n\nSolo exhibitions\n\n[edit]\n\n2013: 'Familia Obscura', Brundyn +, Cape Town\n\n2011: 'Some Dance to Remember Some Dance to Forget', Blank Projects, Cape Town\n\n2009: 'Graceland', Gallery AOP, Johannesburg\n\n2008: ' Sub Rosa', João Ferreira Gallery, Cape Town\n\n2007: 'Perfectly Still', Absa Gallery, Johannesburg\n\n2006: 'Blues and Greys', Art on Paper Gallery, Johannesburg\n\n2005: 'Fool's Gold', Bell-Roberts Contemporary, Cape Town\n\n2005: 'Hoogwater/High Tide', KKNK, Oudtshoorn\n\n2003: 'Blank', AVA Gallery, Cape Town\n\n2001: 'From a Netherworld', Bell-Roberts Gallery, Cape Town\n\n2000: 'Northern Ladies', Art Konsult, New Delhi, India\n\n1998: 'An Imitator', AVA Metropolitan Gallery, Cape Town\n\nGroup exhibitions\n\n[edit]\n\n2011: 'Alptraum', Deutscher Kuenstlerbund, Berlin, Germany\n\n2010: 'Twenty', contemporary public sculpture, Nirox, Johannesburg\n\n2008: 'Print '08: Myth, Memory and Archive', Bell-Roberts Gallery, Cape Town\n\n2007: 'Arcadia', AVA Gallery, Cape Town\n\n2007: 'Turbulence', Hangar-7, Salzburg, Austria\n\n2007: Spier Contemporary, Stellenbosch\n\n2006: '20 Artists 06'.
