        "text": "Now who wouldn’t want to take a banana and find two handsome flamingos in their fruit bowl. I discovered Gemma Orkin’s work via Beatnik Bazaar and contacted Gemma to tell us more about her delightful ceramic menagerie.\n\nI have been a ceramic artists for 15 years. I also teach ceramics. All my work is hand made and hand painted. I enjoy the process of making a simple, traditional shape on which to paint. All the designs I paint are inspired by the things I love and the things that make me happy. I like to use warm, creamy and bright colours.\n\nI have 2 beautiful children, a wonderful husband and I live in Tamboerskloof. I sell locally and internationally. My ceramics can be ordered direct from me or I sell mainly through Melissas Food Store or Africa Nova.\n\nMeet more of Gemma’s animals here www.gemmaorkin.co.za\n\nThanks Gemma!\n\nWhat happens to the photos that aren’t chosen to be featured in a fashion spread? Well they are left to “gather pixel dust” (as Lauren Fowler would say) in a desktop folder somewhere. We’ve decided to get out our virtual feather duster and dust off these beautiful pics that weren’t selected for Alix-Rose Cowie’s beautiful fashion shoot In the hall with the candle stick.\n\nWhile I’m dusting, Alix-Rose tells us a bit more about herself, her photography, her inspirations and aspirations.\n\nHi, I’m Alix-Rose, nothing to do with Guns ‘n Roses. Promise. My creative career started after I graduated with a degree in Art Direction in 2008. In 2009 I worked for an ad agency and left in early 2010 to do something that suited me better.\n\nI did a few short courses at the Cape Town School of Photography to find out what an aperture was and how to adjust it. I learned the rest and am still learning through doing as many self-motivated shoots as I can. Most of these with Kate Desmarais (katedesmarais.tumblr.com) as stylist. I knew I was on the right track when I made the top ten for the ELLE New Talent Photographer Search last year. I now balance being the editor of Between 10and5 (www.10and5.com) with taking photos and working on eventually being worthy of the title ‘Photographer’.\n\nI shoot digital, do minimal retouching and use only natural light. My ideal fashion photography is found in the pages of Lula and Frankie magazines. I love the work of Valerie Phillips, Nirrimi Hakanson, Anna Wolf and locally, Amy Scheepers. I don’t think there are enough female fashion photographers in the world.\n\nThese are some unseen pics from a shoot I did for Kate Chauncey’s vintage clothing label, The Rah-Rah Room. Stylist – Kate Desmarais, Model – Lala Quail.\n\nMy website is very slowly coming together so in the meantime please visit my blog – alixisforhire.blogspot.com\n\nThanks Alix!\n\nBird on Branch.

Buy it here.\n\nWe’ve featured some of Marisa Girardi’s couchies, brooches and artwork before (two of them are still featured on our header image – the heart and the skull), but we’ve never chatted to this wonderfully talented artist and artisan from Simons Town. As you’ll see on her beautiful website there’s little that she can’t do. I was torn between featuring her jewellery, her art, her couchies, her brooches, her embroidery hoops or her linen rabbits. I eventually settled on her and Zane Harpur’s brand new sustainable line of bamboo hangings and mirrors called Bam!Boom!\n\nOver to Marisa:\n\nHandmade has been a way of life for me since I was little and I like to think that after the Fantastic Age of Plastic has passed, it might become as essential a part of life as it once was, pre-industrialisation, when everyone was a maker of things. Craftsmanship has had little value in the past century and I am super-glad that over the last few years this has slowly started changing – what an exciting time to be creating! But we still have a long way to go.\n\nI have had no formal training and though there are many disciplines I would still love to investigate, I get great satisfaction from figuring things out for myself and coming up with my own methods of creation. I am always working on new ideas and find it impossible to stick to one thing.\n\nI am inspired by randomness – in nature, history, conversation and arrangement. I like things that are a little off-centre, imperfect, slightly strange, faintly crooked, have tiny irregularities, are weathered, worn and used. (A bit of symmetry here and there isn’t too bad, but it must be kept in check). I also consider daydreaming, exploring, observing, experimenting and loafing to be essential components of my creative life.\n\nMy most recent project, in collaboration with my partner Zane, is bam!boom! I do most of the designs, which are then printed onto bamboo board and cut to shape, ready to hang on the wall. I really like designing with the bamboo surface as a negative space. It is a wonderful material with a beautiful grain and is so smooth and solid and great to experiment with. We have lots of exciting ideas for future designs!\n\nYou can order any of her products from her online shops: Marisa Girardi’ Presents and Bam!Boom!\n\nOr join the brand new Bam!Boom! Facebook page here.\n\nThanks Marisa!\n\nMengsel Pillows R340 each\n\nWe’ve been huge fans of the Vamp blog for a long time and we’ve finally got round to chatting to Paula van Niekerk owner of the beautiful Vamp furniture store in Cape Town. They’re in a new space and they now stock lots of local brands such as Skinny Laminx, Lauren Fowler, Isabeaupeep, SMAC Harry, Nicky Page, Moonbasket, Renee Rossouw etc.\n\nSo there’s a revamped Vamp. What has changed and what inspired the change?\n\nWe had to move from our previous location as the building was sold. It had been coming for quite some time, so after the initial angst, we got really excited at the prospect of moving to a fresh new space. We still focus on our revamped mid – century furniture which is the biggest part of our business and have also have started adding new designers and ranges into the mix that we feel complement our furniture and our vision for Vamp. Other than that, we are in a bigger space which enables us to showcase our wares much better.\n\nTell us a bit more about your background.\n\nVamp is owned by myself and my partner Michael Dodds. My background is in restaurants, and more recently I owned an events management and décor company. Michael is a baker and pastry chef by trade, but has been in the woodwork manufacturing industry for the past 15 years.\n\nTwo years ago, on a weekend away up the West Coast, we found a shop that sold a bit of everything, from clothing and furniture to petrol! What really caught our eye was an incredible selection of vintage furniture that had previously belonged to some or other government department. We spontaneously bought the lot and sent it back to Cape Town on a rather large truck. We had often spoken about opening a furniture/homeware shop together over the years and with the perfect excuse to actually get off our butts and do it, we opened Vamp a few months later.\n\nYou work with a lot of up-and-coming designers do you have any advice for young designers/product designers/artisans who are trying to establish their own brands and who would one day love to sell their wares at Vamp.\n\nThere is so much incredible talent around that it can be really tough getting your name out there. Be passionate about what you do, people are drawn to that. Create your own formula, stay focused on your ideas, but don’t be scared to ask for advice and guidance along the way. Work hard, be positive and don’t give up!\n\nThe shop is situated on 368 Albert Road (Opposite the Old Biscuit Mill) in Woodstock, Cape Town. Their opening hours are as follows: 09h30 – 16h30 Mondays to Fridays. 08h30 – 15h00 Saturdays.\n\nJoin their Facebook page or follow their blog to stay updated on what’s new at Vamp. http://vampfurniture.blogspot.com/\n\nThanks Paula!\n\nI discovered the beautiful French Seam Project via Art South Africa and I just fell in love with everything the project stands for:\n\nTHE FRENCH SEAM PROJECT encourages a slowed-down approach to clothing. Behind every garment is a thought process and there is a reason for every detail – the choice of fabric, the use of a zip or a button.\n\nQuality of fabric & craftsmanship, attention to detail and integrity of design are the roots of THE FRENCH SEAM PROJECT, the aim being to return to the elegance, sophistication and thoughtfulness that our grandmothers took as a given, but that is so often lacking in our own time.\n\nI immediately contacted the owner Jacqueline Nurse who told Handsome Things more about the shop, its philosophy, the designers and the art of the French Seam.\n\nThe project’s name.\n\nA French seam is one in which the raw edges of the fabric are completely enclosed by sewing them together first on the right side and then on the wrong. Before the advent of the overlocker this was an effective way to finish raw edges, but is quite labour intensive. It requires the seamstress to fold over and press the first seam in order to sew the second. An overlocker, however, finished the edges in one go after the straight seam has been sewn. Hence, it’s become the much more popular way to go about things these days.\n\nThe reason why I chose to use this as a name for the project is that, as an analogy, it fits quite nicely into what I’m trying to do – which is to encourage a slowed-down and more thoughtful approach to clothing in general. And to focus attention on the role of each item of clothing in shaping a person’s identity, however eclectic.\n\nThe lady behind the project.\n\nI come from an arts background, so it’s in that arena that the roots of the project (and my thinking) can be found. Having studied English and Art History at Rhodes University, I threw myself headlong into a curatorial and arts writing career. Through this process I’ve developed a keen interest in the ways that we construct our identities like narratives, and the importance of the clothes that we wear as little paragraphs or chapters, if you will, in our stories. In my mind it is not so big a jump from what I have been doing in the arts to what I’m starting to do on the outskirts of the fashion arena.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWe featured talented fine artist Bronwen Vaughn-Evans a few posts back and this time we’re looking at her and Sam Schwarer’s whimsical brand Hey Cherry. They’re based in Durbs and you can catch them at the wonderful I heart Market.\n\nSam and I formed HEYCHERRY as a fun outlet for ideas that we have outside of our day jobs. We are close friends and moms of children who are best friends, so we see each other often and always land up chatting about new ideas we wish we had time to execute.\n\nI am a bit of a techo recluse (luddite) while Sam is great at media management, so she does most of our publicity (although I do blog posts from time to time).\n\nIf people want to purchase our products (they are posted under the products heading on our blog + prices) they should just email us on sam@heycherry.co.za and/or bron@heycherry.co.za. depending on who makes what. Potential clients can do a simple EFT and the product they want will be posted to them.\n\nI am a fine artist (see www.vaughan-evans.co.za) by trade. I lecture part-time in the Fine Art Department of the Durban University of Technology, exhibit my work nationally (and a little internationally) and I make knick-knacks for our stall at the I HEART MARKET.\n\nI love contemporary South African art, vintage children’s toys and books and all things contemporary craft. I am inspired by the wonderful creative people around me. People like Paul Edmunds (and his wife Heather Moore), Greg Streak, Andries Botha and Dee Donaldson are friends who inspire me to take my craft seriously, to do things beautifully whatever field I am working in. The wonderful makers at the I HEART MARKET (cupcake couture, savage jewellery, token ceramics, whimsy, and ikyaha to name a few) are also a great source of inspiration.\n\nHave a look at their blog Hey Cherry.\n\nThanks Sam & Bronwen!\n\nIt’s Smith Jewellery’s first birthday today (hiep hiep) and you can walk away with one of Anna’s beautiful handmade sterling silver animal pins. All you have to do is like the Smith Jewellery Facebook page and write on her wall which handsome animal you’d like to adopt. We’ll announce the winner next Monday.\n\nMeet Anna Raimondo the designer behind Smith jewellery.\n\nI was born and bred in CT and from an early age I was exposed to beautiful music, clothes and crafts by my mother and grandmothers. I fell into jewellery design by accident at Stellenbosch University (was originally going to do a journalism degree) and found that not only did I enjoy it, but was kind of good at it too. While in my final year at Stellies I applied (and got accepted) for a scholarship at the Richemont Group’s school of design in Milan. The course was a one year ‘Master in Design’ and focused on accessory design for luxury market. After finishing my studies at the Creative Academy, I then completed an intense three-month internship as a designer for the world-renowned fashion brand Chloe, working in their leather department in Milan.\n\nAfter that I spent the next two years working and traveling in and around the UK and Australia. I tried many things from working for a small jewellery company to telesales to marketing, but the need to return home and start my own thing grew.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nUntitled by Jordan Metcalf\n\nSoft ground, aquatint and burnishing on Zerkall Bütten 250gsm\n\nPublisher: Warren Editions Price: R 800.00 (excl.

The beautiful print studio in Cape Town prints and publishes original fine arts prints by both emerging and established South African visual artists. Although they are not primarily printmakers, these artists are interested in the revival of printmaking as a contemporary medium. The prints are also for sale from the studio.\n\nAt Warren Editions, artists are introduced to the time-honoured intaglio and monotype techniques, offering artists the freedom to realise and originate ideas in multiple form.\n\nAs a Printmaker you collaborate with artists, tell us a bit more about this process.\n\nAt Warren Editions, visual artists are encouraged to explore the multiple possibilities of print so as to develop an individual and sustained pathway in image-making – whether printmaking is the core practice or the support for other processes. Due to the fact that prints are generally comprised of different layers, the artist is faced with the challenge of de-constructing an re-constructing their images. This partnering of play and organization often leads the artist to new directions in his/her general art practice.\n\nCollaboration is central to the developing of the images: the print collaboration is a constant intercession between artist and printmaker. The printer’s role is to introduce the technical possibilities of the medium to the artist and to ensure a consistency in quality. At Warren Editions, the print collaboration is initiated by the artist’s vision. Zhané Warren recommends the best options and is responsible for the technical aspects of the plate production. Along with an assistant, Warren prints the edition after a Bon à Tirer Proof (go-ahead print) has been agreed upon between artist and printer.\n\nContinue reading →"
