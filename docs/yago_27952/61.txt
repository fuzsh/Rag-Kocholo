Mrs. Doubtfire, then and now

In 1993, Robin Williams took an age-old comedy trope — a person disguising themselves as another gender — and spun it into gold in Mrs. Doubtfire. Based on the book Alias Madame Doubtfire, and directed by Chris Columbus, the film leaned into Williams' renowned skills as an improviser and comedian to tell the tale of Daniel Hillard, a man who disguises himself as a Scottish housekeeper in order to stay close to his kids after his divorce. The film featured some of the best and brightest talents of the early-'90s, while also providing a showcase for its three adorable child actors. Where are they now?

Robin Williams (Daniel Hillard/Mrs. Doubtfire)

Williams was already a household name by 1993, breaking out on Mork & Mindy in the early-1980s and having appeared in films like Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), Dead Poets Society (1989), and Hook (1991), and voicing Genie in Aladdin (1992). Known for his improvisational style, Williams was given free rein as Mrs. Doubtfire, inventing the character's voice and look from the ground up and frequently riffing off-script in his scenes.

After delighting audiences in the movie, he continued to dominate film screens in the 1990s in the likes of Jumanji (1995), The Birdcage (1996), Flubber (1997), and Patch Adams (1998). In 1998, he won an Oscar for his portrayal of Sean, Will Hunting's (Matt Damon) therapist, in Good Will Hunting. Continuing into the 2000s, he worked steadily in serious films (2001's A.I. Artificial Intelligence, 2002's One Hour Photo) and children's movies (2006's Happy Feet and RV), as well as playing a recurring role as Teddy Roosevelt in the Night at the Museum films.

In 2013, he returned to his TV roots on the short-lived CBS sitcom The Crazy Ones. Williams tragically took his own life in 2014 at the age of 63.

Sally Field (Miranda Hillard)

Like her costar Williams, Sally Field got her start on television with shows like Gidget and The Flying Nun. In the late-1970s, she transitioned to movie stardom with a leading role in Smokey and the Bandit (1977), moving on to more prestige fare and winning Oscars for both Norma Rae (1979) and Places in the Heart (1984). Field was well into her career by the time she portrayed Miranda Hillard, Daniel's ex-wife who yearns for an emotionally and financially supportive partner.

She has continued a diverse career in film (1994's Forrest Gump, 2012's Lincoln and The Amazing Spider-Man) since. She's also returned to her television roots with a six-year stint on ER and a prime role as matriarch Nora Walker on Brothers & Sisters, as well as supporting roles on Dispatches From Elsewhere and Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty.

Field has appeared in quirky comedies like Hello, My Name is Doris (2015) and Little Evil (2017), and stars alongside Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and Rita Moreno in the Tom Brady-produced film 80 for Brady (2023).

Pierce Brosnan (Stu)

When Pierce Brosnan played Stu — Miranda's smarmy, wealthy new boyfriend — in Mrs. Doubtfire, he was best known to audiences for portraying the title role on television's Remington Steele.

Two years later, he'd become an international superstar as James Bond in 1995's GoldenEye. He portrayed the British spy a total of four times, ending with 2002's Die Another Day. Since then, Brosnan has appeared in rom-coms (2004's Laws of Attraction), musicals (2008's Mamma Mia! and 2018's Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again), thrillers (2010's The Ghost Writer), and action films (2017's The Foreigner and 2022's Black Adam).

He appeared on AMC's Western drama The Son from 2017 to 2019, and went royal for his portrayals as King Rowan in Amazon's Cinderella (2021) and Louis XIV in Sean McNamara's The King's Daughter (2022).

Harvey Fierstein (Frank)

Prior to Mrs. Doubtfire, Harvey Fierstein was chiefly known in theater circles. He previously starred in 1988's Torch Song Trilogy, which was based on a play he wrote — Fierstein won two Tony awards for writing and appearing in the Broadway production. He had also won a Tony for writing the book for the musical La Cage aux Folles. Though he'd had guest-starring roles on television, the role of Frank — Daniel's gay brother who helps design the makeover he needs to become Mrs. Doubtfire — was a breakout film part for the actor.

Since Mrs. Doubtfire, Fierstein has gone on to appear in films like Bullets Over Broadway (1994), Independence Day (1996), Duplex (2003), and Bros (2022). His distinctive gravelly voice has also been heard in everything from Mulan (1998) to How I Met Your Mother to Big Mouth.

Fierstein has continued to work primarily in the theater, originating the role of Edna Turnblad in Broadway's Hairspray, appearing in a revival of his own La Cage, and writing books for musicals like Kinky Boots, Newsies, and several live TV musical productions.

She also appeared opposite Martin Short in A Simple Wish (1997) and had a recurring role on Melrose Place.

Wilson took a 12-year hiatus from acting beginning in 2000 and has since returned to the screen, primarily on TV series like Broad City, BoJack Horseman, and Big Hero 6: The Series. Today, she primarily works as a culture writer, penning articles, plays, and a memoir.
