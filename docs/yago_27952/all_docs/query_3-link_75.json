        "text": "Sally Field lovingly remembered Robin Williams on the 10th anniversary of his passing as a “very sensitive and intuitive” soul.\n\nThe “Steel Magnolias” star shared that Williams organized for her to leave the “Mrs. Doubtfire” set moments after her father had passed.\n\nField, 77, told Vanity Fair that she was on the set of the 1993 comedy when she received word that her father had died.\n\n“I was of course beside myself,” Field remembered. “I came on the set trying with all my might to act. I wasn’t crying. Robin came over, pulled me out of the set, and asked, ‘Are you okay?'”\n\nThe “Norma Rae” star told Williams that her father had died.\n\n“‘Oh my God, we need to get you out of here right now,'” she recalled him saying, noting that he made it happen — no small feat on a big-budget film.\n\n“They shot around me the rest of the day,” she revealed. “I could go back to my house, call my brother, and make arrangements. It’s a side of Robin that people rarely knew: He was very sensitive and intuitive.”\n\nField added that she loved filming with the “Aladdin” star.\n\n“You couldn’t really see what Mrs. Doubtfire was on the page,” she explained. “It became its own life form primarily because of him.”\n\nShe also confessed to not feeling like Williams has died.\n\n“I keep thinking of him as ‘is.’ He can’t have left; he can’t. He’s still here. I feel him,” she said.\n\nField wasn’t the only person working on “Mrs. Doubtfire” to lovingly remember Williams.\n\nThe movie’s director, Chris Columbus, said that the late star knew all of the crew members by the end of the first week of filming.\n\n“He had learned everybody’s name, from the caterers to the production assistants,” he shared. “And if anyone had a quirk, he would remember and make a joke. It made everyone feel like he was their friend and put everyone in a fantastic mood.”\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor was found dead from suicide in his California home on August 11, 2014.\n\nThe final autopsy report concluded that Williams’s death was a suicide resulting from “asphyxia due to hanging” and that he had been suffering from “diffuse Lewy body dementia.”\n\nLast month, his eldest son, Zak, remembered his father on what would have been his 73rd birthday.\n\n“I remember you for all the hope and joy you brought to the world,” Zak wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of his dad. “There’s not a week that goes by without someone sharing with me how you helped them through a dark time or a rough patch. I’m so grateful and proud to be your son. Love you forever.”"
