I was in the camper outside of the courtroom where we were shooting the divorce scene. My father had a stroke a couple of years before, and was in a nursing facility. I got a phone call from the doctor saying my father had passed — a massive stroke. He asked if I wanted them to put him on the resuscitator. I said, ‘No, he did not want that. Just let him go. And please lean down and say, ‘Sally says goodbye.’\n\n\"I was of course beside myself. I came on the set trying with all my might to act. I wasn’t crying. Robin came over, pulled me out of the set, and asked, ‘Are you OK?’\n\n\"[I told him and] he said 'Oh my God, we need to get you out here right now...' And he made it happen — they shot around me the rest of the day. I could go back to my house, call my brother and make arrangements. It’s a side of Robin that people rarely knew: He was very sensitive and intuitive.\"\n\nThe Academy Award-winning star previously admitted that she \"hates\" that her co-star is no longer here and wanted him to be able to \"grow old\" like her.\n\nShe told People: \"What you think about immediately is Robin. There isn’t a moment of it that’s not filled with my love and joy at being in his presence. I mean, Robin was Robin. He was everything he seemed to be: a generous, loving, sweet, genuinely talented man. We all miss him. He should be growing old like me, for God’s sake. I hate it that he isn’t here.\"\n\n\""
