        "text": "Adrian Cronauer of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania served in real life as United States Air Force Sergeant and disc jockey on American Forces Network during the Vietnam War. Cronauer became the inspiration for the Mitch Markowitz written United States war comedy directed by Barry Levinson titled Good Morning, Vietnam (1987).\n\nServing in what was Saigon at the time, the movie Good Morning, Vietnam introduced Private Edward Garlick picking up Adrian Cronauer at the airport to the radio station where Cronauer would become a disc jockey. Forest Whitaker and Robin Williams portray Garlick and Cronauer, respectively. We find quickly that Cronauer‘s style of offering irreverent humor and playing rock and roll music is neither appreciated nor received well by his superior officers, namely Lieutenant Steven Hauk and Sergeant Major Phillip Dickerson. Bruno Kirby and J.T. Walsh portray Hauk and Dickerson, respectively.\n\nAs this storyline begins, Cronauer follows a local girl, Trinh, to a class where he aims to teach the local Vietnamese population English. Trinh’s brother, Tuan, intervenes in the shenanigans from the class that Cronauer insinuates himself into, in as much as Tuan wants Cronauer to discontinue having an interest in his, Tuan’s, sister. The friendship that follows for Tuan and Cronauer leads them to Jimmy Wah’s GI bar, and racial tensions ensue. Chintara Sukapatana, Tom. T. Tran, and Cu Ba Nguyen portray Trinh, Tuan and Jimmy Wah, respectively.\n\nThe incident at Jimmy Wah’s GI bar boils up into further tensions for Cronauer with Dickerson and Hauk, with the result being a humorous and dramatic set of escalating discipline. Humor and drama would follow, with emotional connections, personality conflicts and a deep sense of conscience that provoked dramatic interplay. Avoiding the details for the sake of those yet to watch the movie, my testimony confirms that the interplay alone is compelling with the humor alongside also working.\n\nThe central personality throughout the movie is, as you might expect, Adrian Cronauer. The man’s humanity is without question strong. The interactions including General Taylor, as portrayed by Noble Willingham, help offer some sense of perspective and adulthood throughout the larger story. The role serves a crucial role in bringing the movie to its resolution.\n\nThe humanity and insanity of being at war, with a friendly dose of what humor can be when looking at conflict from a perspective of everyday life, makes the movie effective for a wide audience. The story still holds up for me to this day, which helps me give Good Morning, Vietnam as directed by Barry Levinson 4.25-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Saturday, May 28, 2022\n\nThe 1987 book Madame Doubtfire by English author Anne Fine, known as Alias Madame Doubtfire in the United States, was written for teenage and young adult audiences. Chris Columbus directed the movie Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) six years later, which set the story as written for screen by Randi Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon in San Francisco, California. My lovely wife, Lynn of Matt Lynn Digital, enjoys this movie very much.\n\nThe movie Mrs. Doubtfire opens with an opening sequence wherein we are introduced to voice actor Daniel Hilliard, as portrayed by Robin Williams, voicing a cartoon that includes imagery for children that he finds inappropriate. In objection, Hilliard walks off set and quits the job and heads home to spend time with his kids, named Lydia, Chris and Natalie. Despite the explicit wishes of his Daniel’s wife not to celebrate Chris’ birthday extravagantly due to unsatisfactory grades in school, Daniel initiates a celebration well beyond the wishes of the children’s mother. Sally Field portrayed Miranda Hilliard, Daniel’s wife and mother to the couple’s three kids.\n\nMiranda Hilliard is called home from work to address the noise complaint that originates with the party. Shortly after breaking up the party and sending the neighborhood guests on their way, Daniel and the kids learn that these incidents were the final straw for Miranda’s patience. A divorce would follow wherein Daniel would leave the family home and be granted limited visitation with the children. The character Mrs. Doubtfire is born of this development, with the assistance of Daniel’s brother Frank. Lisa Jakub portrayed the eldest child, Lydia Hilliard. Matthew Lawrence portrayed the middle child, Chris Hilliard. Mara Wilson portrayed the youngest child, Natalie Hilliard.\n\nThe separation from his kids being more than Daniel Hilliard could bear, he set in motion to reduce the competition for housekeepers for the professional and newly single parent, Miranda Hilliard. Daniel’s brother Frank, as portrayed by Harvey Fierstein, works with Frank’s domestic partner Jack to build the prosthetics and costume for what would become the housekeeper for his kids, Mrs. Doubtfire. The backstory for how Daniel pulls off landing his new engagement with his family offers humor all its own. Domestic partner Jack was portrayed by Scott Capurro.\n\nA completely engaging and remarkable set of relationships between Daniel Hilliard and his family, Miranda and the kids included, emerges with the former husband now serving as the family’s older, British nanny. Miranda engages in a blossoming romantic relationship with a former love interest name Stu, whom she became reacquainted with through her professional life. The ulterior motives that the audience becomes privy too, knowing the true identity of family’s nanny, offers much humor. Pierce Brosnan portrayed Miranda’s love interest, Stu.\n\nOccurring at the same time as the blossoming relationships the came to pass following the divorce, Daniel is required as a part of his permanent custody wishes to submit to court-mandated inspections of fitness for his living quarters as well as permanent work. Mrs. Sellner, as portrayed by Anne Haney, is the person appointed to conduct the home inspections while also helping Daniel land work. Mr. Lundy, as portrayed by Robert Prosky, plays a role in the short-term and long-term solutions to Daniel landing work in support of the custody arrangements that underline the story’s longer-term direction.\n\nThe comedy and the drama offered in Mrs. Doubtfire make the movie experience worth the 125-minute running time. The movie hits on many of the teenage and young adult themes relevant to the audience of the source material of the books while striking a good balance that works for an adult audience open to the same. I grant Mrs. Doubtfire as directed by Chris Columbus 3.75-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Saturday, March 26, 2022\n\nRobin Williams as a villain? Al Pacino as a conflicted policeman? Hilary Swank somewhere outside the loop yet every bit the advocate for justice? Welcome to the Christopher Nolan movie Insomnia (2002), a remake of the Norwegian movie Insomnia (1997).\n\nAl Pacino starred as Detective Will Dormer of the Los Angeles Police Department of Los Angeles, California. Detective Hap Eckhart, set to testify against Dormer in an internal affairs concern in Los Angeles, flies with Dormer to the fictional town of Nightmute, Alaska to assist in a murder investigation at the request of Nightmute Police Chief Charlie Nyback, a former colleague of Dormer’s. Paul Dooley portrayed Nyback as Martin Donovan portrayed Eckhart.\n\nNightmute, Alaska Detective Ellie Burr, as portrayed by Hilary Swank, picks up the LAPD detectives at the airport. While tension exists between Eckhart and Dormer, Burr greets the pair with a stated admiration for the investigative work that prompted lent support for Nyback in getting Dormer the opportunity to investigate the murder that brought him the LAPD detectives to Alaska in the first place.\n\nIt was during the long daylight hours of an Alaska summertime that the course of the murder investigation took the detectives into near wilderness habitat in pursuit of the team’s murder suspect, Walter Finch. Robin Williams portrayed Finch, whose gun is left at the scene of a police-involved shooting that leaves one of the pursuing detective’s dead. Knowing how the notion of a shooting death looks, Dormer makes up a story that magnifies what Dormer knows is already a difficult situation back home.\n\nSuffering from the near constant daylight of an Alaska summertime, the difficulties back home, the original murder investigation, the police involved shooting and an offer by murder suspect Walter Finch to turn the plot of this psychological thriller into film noir, Detective Dormer confides some of his inner feelings to innkeeper Rachel Clement, as portrayed by Maura Tierney.\n\nThe stage is set well in amplifying the tension within the film functioning from the Hillary Seitz, Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjærg screenplays. Fundamentally, the centerpiece for this movie to me is the story and cinematic feel more than the performances of the actors, which isn’t meant to diminish the acting performances. The real casting surprise, which works for me as a portrayal against typecast, rests with the role of Walter Finch. Make no mistake in knowing that the film works. I offer Insomnia as directed by Christopher Nolan 3.75-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, November 10, 2021\n\nThe movie Jumanji (1995), and the franchise that followed, began as the 1981 picture book Jumanji by Chris Van Allsburg. We choose to look at the fantasy adventure movie from 1995, starring well known actors and a charming mix of twists and turns that many a family audience can enjoy.\n\nThe story of Jumanji begins perhaps 10 or 15 years before the current day in 1995, with the game at the center of the movie beginning play with young Alan Parrish and young Sarah Whittle playing the board game Jumanji. Adam Hann-Byrd and Laura Bell Bundy portray Alan and Sarah as kids, with appearances by David Alan Grier as Carl Bentley and Jonathan Hyde as Samuel Parrish in the youth of Alan and Sarah.\n\nThe notion of Jumanji as a board game permits that story begun in the past to span many years into the modern day of 1995, wherein we are introduced to Judy Shepherd, Peter Shepherd and aunt Nora Shepherd as they begin moving into the Parrish house once occupied by Alan and his parents, Samuel and Carol Parrish. Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Bebe Neuwirth portray Judy, Peter and Nora, respectively. Patricia Clarkson portrays Carol Parrish. It is the move into the home by the Shepherds, along with the initial uncertainty of a move into any neighborhood, that gets Judy and Peter playing the board game in the present day.\n\nThe playing of the game introduces the fantasy of what Jumanji has to offer the audience and the characters of the movie. It takes the playing to introduce Bonnie Hunt as Sarah Whittle and Robin Williams as Alan Parrish, both as adults who have experienced much since the initial introduction of characters from the past. We get to be reintroduced to Carl Bentley in a new career as police officer, while Jonathan Hyde is reintroduced as Van Pelt.\n\nThe shenanigans that ensue humorously entertain while offering engaging revelations about the interpersonal struggles experienced by the several characters. The struggles are shared in relatable ways that make for enjoyable entertainment that I recommend for many. A similar vein is used in the later franchise of movies that came along with a different cast, with an updated spin that makes the appeal here for a more recent audience.\n\nThe movie Jumanji as directed by Joe Johnston tells a story of adventure and fantasy. The mixture of family friendly humor and relatable experience makes the film work for most audiences. That I enjoyed the experience through multiple full and partial viewings, leads me to give Jumanji 4.0-stars on a scale of one-to-five.\n\nMatt – Saturday, May 29, 2021"
