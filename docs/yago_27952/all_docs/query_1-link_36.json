        "text": "Mrs. Doubtfire is a film I love. Every time it comes on, I keep the channel on. It’s heartwarming, funny, and comforting to me. Nonetheless, being a film critic-in-training and a neurotic cinema addict, I have to run it through the unavoidable gauntlet. I read the film through a gender lens and realized that it has a subtle undercurrent of father’s rights and anti-feminist backlash running through it. Not that I love the movie any less.\n\n“Fun-loving” husband Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is much too irresponsible with his fun-lovingness. Near the start of the film, after getting fired from his job as a cartoon voice, he brings a bunch of zoo animals to the birthday party of his 12-year-old son, Chris, after the kid asks excitedly about a stripper (to which Dad reacts positively). When wife Miranda (Sally Field) comes home, she’s the one who has to clean up. There’s an animal eating the cake and a horse about to pee on the carpet.\n\n“Don’t you dare make me out to be the monster here! You have all the fun, and I get whatever’s left over!” she yells at him.\n\n“You chose the career,” he says.\n\n“I have no choices here!”\n\nShe is forced to take on a career because Daniel is an overgrown child, and his unwillingness to govern the children forces her to be the strict parent. She asks for a divorce. He makes a joke. She tells him not to. He says, “okay,” like a child. “But we’re a family,” he pleads.\n\nLesson #1: Mom is the bad guy for establishing rules, and wives should let their husbands do whatever they want, even if the wife has to clean up the resulting mess.\n\nMeanwhile, Daniel goes for support to his brother and his male partner, who both work in a makeup shop. Talking on the phone with their mother, his brother calls his partner a bitch. The film has the nagging mother assume he’s talking about her.\n\nCut to divorce court. The bald-headed male judge is an elderly figure, which can read as “mature” and therefore “respectful of women” or possibly “asexual.” His geriatrically-induced asexuality may render him not hip enough to objectify women anymore. He lets Daniel know that although divorce proceedings used to favor the mother in the past, courts are remembering to recognize the importance of the father. His tone is ‘no-nonsense’ and the function of this statement in the film appears to be to say that it isn’t enough for the judge to merely respect the rights of fathers- he has to side by default with the father.\n\nThe camera pans left, showing Daniel and his lawyer, a dumpy middle aged man with dull brown eyes and a balding head. We then see the Mrs. with a sharp, flashy, attractive blonde she-lawyer, dressed in trendy clothes. The judge gives Miranda sole custody because Daniel is unemployed. The “she-lawyer” smiles and says “congratulations” to Miranda. Dad can only see his kids once a week. Daniel pleads with the judge, saying he hasn’t been away from his children one day since they were born. (The youngest is 5; the others are 12 and 14- apparently they’ve never had an out-of-town sleepover and neither has the father?) The judge is kind, but firm. He gives Daniel Hillard three months to find a house and a job, and then promises joint custody. Daniel, depressed, won’t even shake hands with his lawyer on the way out.\n\nAlthough I don’t think denying Daniel joint custody was a good solution, the gender current at play in this scene is undeniable.\n\nLesson #2- Women, and men who are too old to have childish biases in favor of men, are antagonists.\n\nCut to the sidewalk. Daniel says goodbye to the kids and tells 12-year-old Chris he’s the man of the house now, even though older Lydia would make a better heir. Dad makes a rude joke about Granny smelling funny, even though the woman is very attractive for an elderly person.\n\nCut to the inside of a room in which Daniel is being interviewed by the worst kind of creature patriarchy can come up with: an older woman who’s educated, professional, and, worst of all, doesn’t find him funny. She is Mrs. Selner, the court liaison who has to check up on him and see if he’s following the judge’s requests. He imitates 8 or 9 different character voices for her.\n\n“Mr. Hillard, do you find yourself humorous?” she asks.\n\n“I used to…” he says.\n\nHis sense of humor isn’t enough to save him from adult life. He gets a boring job boxing and shipping packages. Heaven forbid a man have to do boring work.\n\nLesson #3: Women- especially older women- are boring and boys/men are fun!\n\nMiranda works in her office, and handsome Stuart Dunmire (Pierce Brosnan) walks in. It’s obvious they’ve already had a thing for each other. He is attractive, courteous, and sexy, but not interested in sex for its own sake. He is genuinely interested in her work and personality, and is cultured, though he’d love to have coffee and catch up. She’d love to as well, but is going through a horrible divorce. Stu is so sorry. He’d always hoped she’d find happiness. Miranda is happy he remembered her and cared so much. They go over designs together and plan to talk again soon. He is quickly coded as a threat to Daniel.\n\nLesson #4: Mature, cultured men are annoying rivals to the real hero.\n\nDaniel and the kids are at his new apartment. “How do you like it?” he asks them.\n\n“Nice,” says 5-year-old Natalie,\n\n“Okay,” says Chris,\n\n“Detestable”, says Lydia. Daniel looks at her sadly. (Mini-lesson: boys are honest and neutral, older girls and women are negative and judgmental- they don’t lie in order to inflate male egos- and little girls who have been unspoiled, perhaps by feminism, are sweet and positive).\n\n“Can’t you just tell Mom you’re sorry?” little Nattie asks.\n\n“Wish I could. Grown up problems, they’re a little more complicated,” and you just know the film wants to continue: “because of that dreadful feminism!”\n\nDaniel goes on to morbidly joke that he hopes Mom didn’t die from amoebic dysentery. “Why would you want Mommy to die?” Nattie asks.\n\n“Oh honey, I don’t want Mommy to die,” he says, honestly.\n\n“Then why did you say that?”\n\nIn the movie this passage is kind of funny (especially since diarrhea is mentioned). But consider the real life parallels of this event, the cases in which the father verbally abuses or attacks the mother when she’s away, in front of the kids. How many real life ex-husbands truly would give their ex-wives dysentery if they could?\n\n“Look, Dad, you’re not trying very hard,” Lydia, the voice of maternal responsibility, cracks down.\n\n“You’re right. I’m sorry. I’ll try harder.” he promises his daughter. It’s her job to socialize him.\n\nSuddenly, a bright, red expensive car pulls up. The kids pop up, even though she’s an hour early, and Dad shouts at them to sit down.\n\n“You’re on my time now! You’re my goddamn kids too!”\n\nMiranda doesn’t have time to let them stay. She had to do various errands and now has to leave a personal ad at the newspaper. This means the kids must leave their quality time with Daniel and come with her, for expediency’s sake. Dad jokingly suggests she put a dating ad in the paper, and asks if she’s going to advertise for B+D. No, it’s a housekeeper, she says.\n\n“May I see the ad? I have a right as their father.” (Father’s rights!) Although he was loathe to take responsibility in the past, he sees the children as “his” and believes he deserves at least equal influence over their nanny. He wants control over the kids, but not the work that comes with it.\n\n“Why not let me take the kids after school?” he asks.\n\n“We’re his goddamn kids too!” says Nattie.\n\nWhen Miranda is not looking, Daniel changes the phone number she leaves in her personal ad.\n\nMiranda is faulted in this scene for choosing to do expedient and functional tasks, like the bank, the newspaper, and school. She is coded as bitchy for having to do non-frivolous things. The father’s character is praised as fun loving and free spirited and relatable for doing frivolous things, such as slacking off on his previous job, and telling jokes at inappropriate times. Ironically, but not surprisingly, women are the ones who our society accuses of being addicted to frivolous things, like hair and makeup. Why is it okay when a man is frivolous? Why does the film permit and encourage the audience to find fault with Miranda for performing responsible adult tasks when those tasks allow people like Daniel, who fail to perform them, to slack off in the comfort and luxury they demand?\n\nLesson #5: Don’t let your girls grow into women. They’ll be objective and therefore become critical of men’s behavior. It’s also okay to use sexual insults in front of your kids…as long as it’s against your wife.\n\nDaniel calls Miranda, disguising his voice and pretending to be a various assortment of weird nannies. Miranda is grateful when “Mrs. Doubtfire,” an elderly British/Scottish woman, finally calls.\n\nDaniel goes to his gay brother, Frank, and his partner, Jack, and they use their makeup and a clay mask to turn him into an elderly woman. (Well, of course they’re into makeup. Get men are effeminate and women like makeup. Get it?) He tries on different styles and wigs, mimicking the feminine characteristics of each one, including a vampy Hispanic, an old Russian Jewess, and a singing Barbara Streisand. The two men, girlish as they are, are still men, and they’re on his side. They even crack a joke about their mom’s looks before Daniel leaves.\n\nThe kids sit in the living room, watching a horror movie, which, of course, Chris loves. “Mrs. Doubtfire” knocks on the door and “meets” the kids. Little Nattie and Chris like her, and so does Lydia, who seems to sense something about Mrs. Doubtfire. Feminine intuition, if you will.\n\nMiranda is delighted to find a mature and strict nanny. Daniel uses his position as Mrs. Doubtfire to gain Miranda’s trust and influence her opinions. “She” warns Miranda not to bash the father in front of the children. The film lampoons feminine intuition and trust between women by playing as humorous Mrs. D’s seeming ability to “guess” what’s going on in Mom’s life and what she’s feeling. Daniel has both the ability and willingness to read Miranda when he wants to manipulate her, but never did so previously when reading Miranda would have been conducive to respecting her feelings and wishes.\n\nAfter Mrs. Doubtfire goes along “her” way, “she” is flirted with by the elderly bus driver. Though the driver is relatively polite, the attention isn’t wanted. Afterwards, Daniel walks off the bus with his high heels and threatens to kill the “misogynist bastard” who invented them. As Some Like It Hot said, “Now you know how the other half lives!” Of course, the only legitimate complaint is that he has to wear them. The film is perfectly okay with saddling that burden on “the other half.” And, of course, it insists that men have no clue what it feels like to be on the receiving half until they experience it- quite the excuse!\n\nHe gets to the house and notices the elderly court liaison, Mrs. Selner, with a fright. He pretends to be Daniel’s sister, and says he’ll go get him for her. He rushes upstairs and changes into his own clothes and face. He comes down and talks to her about how great he’s been doing. He says his sister makes a great cup of tea, and Mrs. Selner asks for one, so he goes to put his costume back on, but his mask falls out the window and a truck runs over it.\n\nHe rushes into the kitchen when Mrs. Selner not looking and dips his face into the white frosting on top of a cake. He tells her it’s good for the face, as it drips into their teacups. When he leaves the room, she dips her finger into it and puts it on her face. Those women! Even when they’re professionals they still can’t keep their minds off makeup!\n\nLesson #6: It’s okay to lie to women, especially if they are career women, in order to help yourself. Besides, underneath, all they care about is makeup anyway.\n\nMrs. Doubtfire tries to get used to life as a woman in the next montage. Then she walks in on the children as they watch TV and tells them it’s homework time instead.\n\n“But we always watch Dick Van Dyke,” says Lydia. (Why they’re watching Dick Van Dyke if it’s 1993 is beyond me. Did the movie want the kids to be associated with the innocence of the “good old days?”)\n\n“If you don’t do your homework, you’ll be punished.” Mrs. Doubtfire throws the remote in the fish tank. (If he can be mature and responsible as Mrs. Doubtfire, why can’t he be mature and responsible as Dad?)\n\n“She’s lying. She’d never punish us,” Lydia’s expression shows she thinks “Mrs. D.” is hiding something…\n\nMrs. Doubtfire sits on the couch sipping a drink in a lazy position while the children scrub the house (using his female costume and female-specific authority to exercise male privilege?)\n\nCut to the next scene, and he uses another costume- the “dumb male” costume- to exercise the male privilege of not having to cook: he’s trying desperately to cook, boiling the pots over, burning himself, while the audience “knows” men are too stupid to cook and should be let out of the responsibility! He burns his rubber breasts at the stove and goofily tries to put the flames out, implying female body parts are cumbersome, a burden, and laughable to boot. “My first day as a woman, and I’m getting hot flashes!” He solves his inability to cook by utilizing capitalism- paying someone else to do it. He orders a gourmet takeout meal and sets the table.\n\nOn the way home, he is sized up by the same elderly bus driver, who gets a sight of his hairy leg. Embarrassed, “Mrs. Doubtfire” demurely covers up “her” leg with “her” kilt.\n\n“I like that Mediterranean look in women. Natural. The way God made you.” Many of us have noticed this behavior from certain types of real life men. No matter how un-”feminine” you are, you’re still fuckable; you can never be “safe” from “the gaze.” (There is, of course, the added irony that women who are raped or sexually harassed are said to have asked for it by being sexually attractive, when, as we can see here, no such thing is true and some men will fuck or at least eye-fuck anything they see. It’s not because you’re wearing a skirt, it’s because you’re wearing a vagina). “Mrs. D.” doesn’t like the attention she’s getting, and the film appears to want to show that he’s more uncomfortable with it than a woman would be, because women are used to it or perhaps even “made” for it.\n\nMrs. Doubtfire plays soccer with the kids in her dress, humorously highlighting how hard it is for women to function in their clothes, yet somehow steering clear of criticizing gender roles outright. She vacuums the floor, learns to cook, and finally gets a glimpse of Stu Dunmire from the window, giving him the finger when he’s not looking.\n\nLesson #7: Being a woman is much harder for men than it is for women, so we should just let women keep doing it.\n\nFinally, Mrs. Doubtfire and Stu meet. Stuart Dunmire- “lover boy”- visits the Hillard family, and while he’s playing inside with the children, Daniel, as Mrs. Doubtfire, arrives and yanks the metal Mercedes symbol off his car.\n\n“Ah, this must be the famous Mrs. Doubtfire! Miranda’s been raving about you.”\n\n“Odd. She’s never mentioned you.”\n\n“I have a home in London. I was born there. What part of England are you from? Your accent’s a little, kind of, muddled.”\n\n“Really? Well, so is your tan!”\n\nShe hands him the Mercedes emblem. He recognizes it from his car.\n\n“You own that big expensive car out there? Oh, dear! They say a man who has to buy a big car like that is compensating for smaller genitals. But not in your case, cause I see you’re a strapping lad, aren’t ya?” (funny how patriarchy always accuses women of being jealous, and not being able to control their emotions)\n\nMrs. Doubtfire asks about Stu, and Miranda says he’s becoming more than a friend.\n\n“Isn’t he fabulous?” says Miranda.\n\nDaniel utilizes the safe trust and bond between women to interject his own selfish agenda: “Well, I personally prefer short, furry, and funny.”\n\nHe just wants to go out for a drink, says Miranda, but Mrs. Doubtfire warns her that men always have other intentions and Stu has lust in his eyes. The shot cuts to Stu on the couch, bouncing Natalie on his lap. “All men want sex” is our society’s lie towards women, which conditions women to give up on searching for a healthier more responsible man. It also conditions us to accept the falsity that “men can’t help” but value sex over love, so we can’t blame them).\n\nLet it cool down before you bring someone else into the bed, she says. Apparently, women should accept that all men are potential sleazes, and let the few good ones slide because some of them are bad. You don’t deserve a dream man.\n\nHow long was it after Mr. Doubtfire died that Mrs. regained her interest in romance or sex?\n\n“Never,” says Mrs. D. “Once the father of your children is out of the picture, the only solution is lifelong celibacy.”\n\n“Celibacy?” Miranda asks in horror. (It’s Pierce Brosnan- we feel your pain, Miranda).\n\n“And if you violate that, heaven forgive ya!” (Bringing religion into a discussion about women’s sexual behavior, surprise!)\n\nLesson #8: Women have no right to attract to more than one man, or to be happy after they “commit” divorce; it’s okay to commit property damage against rival boyfriends.\n\nMrs. Doubtfire walks out of the kids’ room and into the bathroom, forgetting to shut the door. Chris walks in, sees him exposed, and runs away in horror.\n\n“Call the cops!! He’s a he- she’s a sh- he’s a he she! She’s a he!” he freaks out, as if dressing in the “wrong” gender clothes warrants some kind of legal attention.\n\n“I’m not…who you think I am,” Mrs. D. says.\n\n“No shit!” says Chris.\n\n“Watch your mouth, young man!” Daniel Hillard’s voice says.\n\n“Dad?”\n\n“Oh my god…” The children are shocked. Little Natalie is not present. Best keep the little ones away from these evil gender questions, right dearies?\n\n“You don’t really like wearing that stuff, do you Dad?”\n\n“Well. some of it’s comfortable- No!! It’s a pain in the padded ass!” (Apparently “ass” is OK but “shit” is not).\n\n“It’s really you in there!” says uber-girly Lydia, and she hugs him. Chris doesn’t want to hug him.\n\n“It’s cool,” Dad says, “It’s a guy thing.” Does this mean disliking hugging is a guy thing, or not wanting to hug weird people, or that seeing someone go to the bathroom and not wanting to hug them right after out of disgust? The movie is not clear on this.\n\nCut to the studio where Daniel works. An older middle aged man who looks like a scientist is hosting a kids’ educational program with model dinosaurs as the television crew filming him falls asleep.\n\n“Which one’s the dinosaur?” Daniel asks the white haired guy next to him.\n\n“The one in the middle.”\n\n“You’re wrong. They’re all extinct.” The white haired guy looks at him for a couple seconds and lets out a hearty chuckle, like this is top notch comedy.\n\n“This guy used to put ME to sleep when I was a kid. He makes Mr. Rogers look like Mick Jagger. What kind of idiot kept this guy on the air?”\n\n“Me.” says the white haired guy, Mr. Jonathan Lundy, who turns out to be the general manager of this building’s enterprise, the cartoon studio Daniel, a voice actor, was fired from at the start of the film. Daniel is genuinely embarrassed and apologizes for accidentally criticizing him, a courtesy he’d be loathe to afford his own wife. (Of course, it was okay to criticize the older, effeminate male scientist).\n\nThe boss of Daniel’s boxing and shipping section comes over and tells Daniel to get to work.\n\n“Did you ever wish you could freeze frame a second of your day and say, ‘This is not my life?’” Daniel asks Lundy. Yes, Daniel. That’s what most women feel every day.\n\nFrankie Valli’s “Walk Like A Man” plays as Mrs. Doubtfire walks down the street to Miranda’s. “She” tells Miranda about how pitiful her own husband, Winston, was, and how horrible he was in bed. Despite his faults, she states that a flawed husband is better than none at all. A faulty man is better than none at all.\n\nWhat was so bad about this man you lived with for fourteen whole years, she asks, blaming the wife for staying with the husband. (Perhaps Miranda was just trying to follow patriarchal society’s edict that divorce is bad!) Miranda tells Mrs. Doubtfire about how kind and funny Daniel was, and how she started to get fed up with his constant joking. Apparently, based on the look on “Mrs Doubtfire’s” face, this is the first Daniel’s ever considered it. A nice excuse. “I never thought about it.”\n\nTrue to real life, the wife starts blaming herself for the marriage falling apart, by being too uptight and serious all the time, even though we have no proof that her anger isn’t justified, and ample evidence from the start of the film that it probably was. She admits that the reason she divorced him was because she didn’t want her kids growing up with a mother who was angry all the time. She chose the divorce so others could be happy, which, apparently, is the only acceptable reason for a woman to divorce, as evidenced by the heartwarming music that starts playing.\n\nLesson #8: The way to fix things is to re-establish gender roles and assume men don’t know how bad women have it.\n\nMrs. Doubtfire and the family go swimming at a posh outdoor pool resort and see Stu at the top of the diving board. “She” mocks his good looks in front of the children (“That’s called liposuction!”) A few minutes later, “she” ogles a blonde chick at the outdoor bar. (Isn’t he trying to get back with his wife?) It’s okay for a man to want an attractive woman as a girlfriend, but it isn’t okay for a woman to expect Pierce Brosnan for a boyfriend. Also, a man who cares about his looks and makes himself “pretty” is inconveniencing himself, lowering himself to the status of a woman.\n\nMrs. Doubtfire sits at the bar, watching the pool, belching with a beer in “her” hand as Stu takes Dad’s property, his wife and children. The curvy blonde comes over, and “she” offers her a drink, then gets turned down. Stu comes over, and talks to the bartender, who asks Stu why he suddenly is interested in a woman with so much “baggage” (loving children). Stu says he’s changed in his attitude towards dating a woman with children, and adores the kids, especially little Natalie. His earlier wish not to date a woman with children seems to stem more from his busy lifestyle than any sexism or prejudice against single moms. He seems a good guy, but becomes the ultimate villain half a minute later when he calls Daniel a “loser.” “Mrs. Doubtfire” throws a lime onto the back of his head, and says it was merely a “run-by fruiting” by a stranger.\n\nLesson #9: It’s okay to physically assault a man if he “steals” your wife and kids.\n\nMagical music plays as Daniel creeps up to the dinosaur models when he’s supposed to be working. (Of course, it has to be dinosaurs. He’s a boy). This is his chance to escape boring necessary work and get in touch with his true creative self- an opportunity never offered to women. He picks the models up and starts his monologue, imitating Elvis, James Brown, and a rapper. Although it’s pretty funny (especially since Robin Williams did it as improv) it is decidedly second tier to Miranda’s designer work. He’s interrupted by Lundy clapping.\n\n“That’s some funny stuff,” Lundy says. He likes it so much he invites Daniel for an interview for a possible television job, asking him to meet at Bridges restaurant.\n\nMen are told by modern “male culture” to be small minded and to overexaggerate things, and to make huge deals of small things. The “typical” American male sees a B-rate Michael Bay action movie and says it’s epic and amazing. He hears something somewhat witty: “Oh my god, he’s as funny as Dave Chappelle!” Girl next door? She’s hot! Of course, their own accomplishments are marveled at too much, like in the case of Daniel’s sorta funny dinosaur imitations. His wife’s designing templates are easily more magnificent, yet is she ever applauded the way he is?\n\nLesson #10: Men deserve to be lauded for small accomplishments, especially those which are frivolous, because their natural habitat is one of safety from responsibility and real work.\n\n“I’m really proud of you,” 14-year-old Lydia says to 40+ year-old dad Daniel, taking on the female role of mother. He’s proud of himself for having learned to cook and sew, and asks Miranda to give him another chance, but she thinks Mrs. Doubtfire is the best thing that’s happened to them and doesn’t want to get rid of her.\n\nMrs. Doubtfire gives Miranda advice on what dress to pick for her birthday dinner with Stu, and dismisses a bright red dress and a short black one, though the kids like it. They are too sexy, says Mrs. Doubtfire, and she goes into the closet and picks a black frock Miranda wore to her aunt’s funeral 15 years ago. Women aren’t allowed to be sexually active after their first owner is out of the picture.\n\n“I won’t be held responsible for your virtue,” Mrs. Doubtfire says. “Who will protect you?”\n\nBut it’s okay, Miranda says, you’re invited too! The dinner is at Bridges…at the same day and time as Daniel’s meeting with Jonathan Lundy! S/he has to make a decision. Or does s/he?\n\nMiranda, Mrs. D., and the kids arrive at the restaurant. “S/he” has decided to secretly spend half the dinner as Doubtfire and half as Daniel, changing costume in the restroom.\n\nStu gets Miranda a diamond bracelet for her birthday present. Natalie has to go to the bathroom, and Mrs. Doubtfire tells the kids to pick out a dessert at the tray, so he can talk to Stu alone:\n\n“Bit of a going-down payment, no?” she asks Stu about the jewelry. Trying to get in her pants, is he?\n\n“A bit of the horizontal mambo? Humpty Dumpty? Little Jack Horny?” Giggity goo.\n\nHe tries the old “call the woman a slut” tactic to try and scare Stu away: “She has a power tool in the bedroom. It’s amazing she hasn’t chipped her teeth.”\n\nDaniel suddenly realizes he has to meet Mr. Lundy, before Lundy gets fed up and leaves. Mrs. Doubtfire runs off the the bathroom, blaming the wine and her “tiny bladder.” Women are all tiny and perpetually broken. He changes up in the women’s room, comes out as Daniel, and has dinner a bit with Lundy, downing some more alcohol. He sees Stu and the fam looking for Mrs. D. and changes back. Stu tells the waiters he’s allergic to pepper, then assists Mrs. D. when her teeth fall out into her wine glass. She repays him by shaking them off at his face. Daniel says he must reattach his teeth and uses the opportunity to change back into his male clothes.\n\nHe has more alcohol with Lundy, because a man always says yes to booze, it would seem. He had forgotten to take off his lipstick so he brags that he’s just kissed it off a waitress. Lundy congratulates him, and asks if she has a lady friend for him. “Hey, it’s the 90s!” Daniel says. Because lesbians are HAWT!\n\nDaniel dresses back up as Doubtfire and sneaks into the kitchen, where he puts a load of hot cayenne pepper on Stu’s shrimp dish. He accidentally goes back to Lundy’s table before changing again, and decides to tell Lundy that Mrs. Doubtfire is the main character of his new show. Across the room, Stu starts choking because he has had an allergic reaction to the pepper.\n\n“Oh, god, I killed the bastard,” says Daniel, and then rushes to help save him via a somewhat overly violent Heimlich maneuver. Stu falls on top of him and spits the shrimp out, while “Mrs. Doubtfire’s” mask is ripped halfway off. Miranda screams.\n\n“Happy birthday,” Daniel smiles at her sheepishly.\n\nShe screams more and says she has to leave. It’s not at all an unrealistic reaction. “Come on!” she says to the kids.\n\n“We’re sorry Dad,” they say. Good kids are on Daddy’s side and they take the blame for his feelings.\n\n“Sorry bout the pepper,” Daniel tells Stu.\n\n“That’s okay,” says Stu, always the gentleman, but making no eye contact.\n\nLesson #12: If you lie to others, physically assault others, and create psychological harm, that’s okay, as long as you’re a man and the butt end of your actions is a bitchy woman or rival male.\n\nLesson #13: The more harm you cause, the more you love your wife, and this self-centered emotional neediness determines who more deserves to be in a relationship.\n\nCut to the courtroom. Daniel, the true American male individualist, acts as his own attorney. Stu, having heard Daniel’s confession about the pepper, could have pressed serious charges, but obviously hasn’t, because the judge only cites Daniel’s odd behavior and unorthodox lifestyle as reason to keep his children away from him. Miranda looks as if she’s made a mistake; she looks sad, guilty. Guilty for opposing her husband and his happiness. He’s fighting for the right to see his kids at all; he’s allowed supervised visitation rights every week. Daniel’s violent behavior is not worth acknowledging.\n\nThe kids and Miranda are having a hard time finding a nanny. They seem depressed and dejected, not only because they are lacking Mrs. Doubtfire, but also because they are lacking Dad. Suddenly, “she” appears on TV! She has her own show, and the family goes to see Daniel and Mr. Lundy on the set. Miranda and Daniel talk, a la Santa Clause, about their past troubles, and Miranda comes out with the truth: she’s not upset because of the infractions against herself, but for the sake of the children. Things were a lot better when Mrs. Doubtfire was here, Miranda says. The film portrays not only male influence, but womanly influence, whether Mrs. Doubtfire’s or Miranda’s, as the key to children’s happiness. The binding of a woman to the home is necessary for this, unless a responsible man- like Stu, who is not mentioned again- is present. Also like in Santa Clause, the mother ignores the court order for the sake of the family, and allows Daniel more access to his kids. Damn the law if it gets in the way of a man’s wishes.\n\nWe don’t see or hear from Stu since he chokes. Is he out of the picture? Has he been “emasculated” by choking and doesn’t want to come back (or does the film not want him back since he’s no longer “masculine”?) He doesn’t seem the sort to leave because of image problems and not the sort to moan about his maleness. Did he leave because of Daniel? He also doesn’t seem the sort to abandon Miranda for that reason. A somewhat darker reading is that he isn’t seen anymore because he isn’t necessary anymore, that it doesn’t matter either way whether he’s in her life or not. As a source happiness for Miranda, he doesn’t fit into the story anymore, because the story is about how women should be good mothers, not be happy.\n\nAt the end of the film, Mrs. Doubtfire reads a letter from a fan on her TV show. It asks about divorce. She tells the children that sometimes mommies and daddies don’t love each other anymore and can’t live together, but they’ll always love you. This is a lovely sentiment, and a mature way to approach divorce. However, another reading is that, no matter what, Miranda will never be able to get rid of certain unwanted influences from Daniel.\n\n***\n\nMrs. Doubtfire is a story about the “liberation” of a childlike man who wants to do fulfilling work at the expense of his wife and her happiness, and how lamentable it is when he has to lose out because of his decisions. It’s has a men’s rights activist bent in that it makes the case that no matter how strange or hurtful a father’s actions, he should always be allowed unlimited influence over the mother and children.\n\nIn the movie, Daniel is not insane, and rarely truly dangerous. He’s even likable. However, the point of this review is not merely about Daniel or the movie, but about the real life events the movie’s events and themes parallel. In real life, who’s to say the equivalent of Daniel wouldn’t have actually poisoned the equivalent of Stu, or threw a rock at his head instead of a lime? A drive by shooting instead of a run by fruiting? How do we know he wouldn’t have tried to kidnap his children, or threaten his wife? What kind of job could he possibly hold down? The film unwittingly spreads false readings of real-life proceedings that mirror its events because it copies common relationship and gender narratives and sanitizes them for the screen. Basically, it’s saying, “Those divorce proceedings you keep hearing about? Here’s what’s going on at the heart of them!” and then portrays the woman and feminism as the bad guy.\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\n*Daniel Hillard is an likeable, upbeat, unemployed man who “does voices,” but is prone to making rude jokes about others, insulting his wife, and slacking off on doing actual productive wholesome work. He’s a mucho-individualist in that sense. Although his quirks stem from his childlike innocence, they can become twisted. He commits property damage and physically assaults another character at least twice, once life-threateningly. His name is youthful and his reasoning simple but earnest.\n\n*Miranda Hillard is a sophisticated career woman who isn’t portrayed as evil, but as needing to lighten up. Her name is seductive and witchy. She always has her hair straight and often has a suit on. She’s “quick” to anger (thought most people would be in her situation) though she can be fun, attractive, and somewhat appreciative of the “fun” side of Daniel, just not when it is overdone. We get the feeling she is a good women who’s trapped- trapped between her wish to be free from responsibility and her wish to govern her house and children correctly.\n\n*Lydia doesn’t wear makeup, and the film made her features look subdued and brown. She is a girly girl, but not the scary type (the loud, emotive, self-assured type). She’s “safe,” both in her style and her personality, safe for typical American men. She may be somewhat boring, but she won’t challenge or outshine them. She will also mother them.\n\n*Chris is the typical preteen boy, with brown hair of a very generic length and style. He likes horror movies, tough talk, and proving he’s a “guy.” He’s your average, good, likeable kid, and doesn’t think too much about things.\n\n*Natalie’s name is very important: it means birth. Birth is a good thing. It keeps women in the home and family where they supposedly belong. Nattie’s innocence and charm are a reminder to the father of what females are like before they discover feminism (meaning: before they discover how horribly they’ll be treated by men and start understandably complaining). Nattie is kept away from the revelation of Mrs. D.’s real identity because sexuality is too dark and dirty for younger children. (In the book- yes, there’s a book, dearies!- she is the first to find out).\n\n*Stuart Dunmire is everything a woman can dream of. He’s handsome, dashing, protective but not overbearing, not interested in sex for sex’s sake but still sexual, and has good manners. He loves the kids, is interested in Miranda’s personality and life, but allows her space to be liberated. He is the too-perfect threatening new boyfriend, who has everything a girl can ever want…but isn’t right for her, since he makes her happy enough to fully reject the male who “owned” her first.\n\n***\n\nOver all, the movie is a fun film and gets quite a few laughs out of me every time I watch it. But if it is taken as gospel and not merely as entertaining fictional comedy, then we must be careful, because a subtle but sure underlying theme is that men should be able to do whatever they want and women will always clean up after them emotionally and physically. Hopefully, though, the other, stronger theme, that family and connection are the most important thing of all, will win out over that.\n\n❤"
