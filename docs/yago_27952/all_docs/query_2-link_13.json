        "text": "Daniel Hillard/Mrs. Doubtfire [[1]]\n\nFirst Appearance:\n\nMrs. Doubtfire\n\nPortrayed By:\n\nRobin Williams\n\nFamily:\n\nMiranda Hillard (ex-wife)\n\nChristopher Hillard (son)\n\nLydia Hillard (older daughter)\n\nNatalie Hillard (younger daughter)\n\nFrank Hillard (brother)\n\nEvelyn Hillard (mother)\n\nJack (brother-in-law)\n\nMiranda's Mother (ex-mother-in-law)\n\nMiranda's Aunt (ex-aunt-in-law)\n\nStatus:\n\nAlive\n\nDaniel Hillard is a talented, unemployed actor and a devoted father who's loved by his three children Chris, Lydia and Natalie. However, his marriage to his serious-minded wife, Miranda is increasingly strained as she has grown to dislike her husband's immature and spontaneous behavior. She even went as far as to ground their son, Chris by not allowing him to have a birthday party until his grades improved, but she did buy him a birthday cake and a few presents.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nDaniel Hillard was born on July 21, 1951 to his mother, Evelyn Hillard and his unnamed father. He has a younger brother, Frank Hillard. Daniel's father was an Englishman who flew in America during the Korean War where he met his mother.\n\nWhile he attended college, Daniel was captain of his football team and played for the 49ers. His team won three State Championships. It was there where he\n\nmet Mirandar while she wastill dating ler ththen boyfriend at the timeg Stu Dunmeyer. Miranda become pregnant and dumped Stu and soon married Daniel. She soon gave birth to her daughter, Lydia in 1980\n\nHe later had two more kids, Chris born in 1981 and Natalie in 1989. However, his marriage to his serious-minded wife, Miranda soon become strained as she has grown to dislike her husband's immature and spontaneous behavior.\n\nFilm[]\n\nAfter quitting another job in 1993, Daniel went against Miranda's wishes by hiring a mobile petting zoo and throwing a \"blowout\" birthday party for Chris. At work, after receiving an emergency phone call from one of the neighbors, Miranda returns home, and is shocked at the chaos and decides this is the last straw, and she tells Daniel she wants a divorce. Since Daniel has no steady source of income or home, Miranda gets primary custody of their children.\n\nDaniel has visitation rights limited to Saturday evenings, devastating him as he adores his children. A court judge acknowledges this and agrees to consider a joint custody arrangement if Daniel can hold down a job and create a suitable home within three months. When Daniel learns that Miranda intends to hire a housekeeper and is unwilling to let Daniel take care of the kids, he's surprised and sees this as an opportunity to see his children. He uses his acting talents and enlists the help of his brot her Frank, a makeup artist, and his partner Jack to transform him into Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire, a 60-year-old British nanny so he himself can apply for the position. Miranda is delighted with \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" and hires her on the spot. The two quickly begin to form a friendship, despite the children struggling to adjust to their new caretaker. Daniel, as Mrs. Doubtfire, is now able to see his kids every day, and uses this opportunity to be the firm father figure who he wasn't before.\n\nEventually, the children begin to respond favorably to Mrs. Doubtfire's methods and Miranda is able to heal her rocky relationship with them and with Daniel as well, who begins to improve himself through his alter ego. However, it has also created another barrier, as Miranda hasn't fully trusted Daniel to care for the children yet.\n\nEventually, Daniel's two older children, Lydia and Chris discover his secret while he's going to the bathroom. Daniel then tells them that while he doesn't like disguising himself, he insists that he's doing it because he was denied joint custody of them. He asks Lydia and Chris not to tell Miranda about it, because if she finds out, she will sue for full custody. Daniel also tells them that they must keep this a secret from Natalie as well, because she's too young to understand, and will likely tell their mother.\n\nWhile taking a job at the studio doing settings, he notices a table full of dinosaur toys and pretends to be a quirky host. This attracts the attention of his boss, Jonathan Lundy, who is impressed by his creativity and imagination. He invites Daniel to dinner at a restaurant to discuss a possible show starring him, which also happens to be the same restaurant on the night on Miranda's birthday party, which she's attending with the children and her new boyfriend, Stu Dunmeyer, who Daniel clearly despises because he believes that he's trying to replace him as their father, and his alter ego Mrs. Doubtfire has also been invited. Unable to change either appointment, Daniel decides to try to rotate in and out of the Mrs. Doubtfire outfit to attend both events. His behavior becomes more erratic due to alcohol that he drank, and he unwittingly sabotages Stu's dinner by putting in spices, which he is allergic to. Upon returning to Lundy's table in his Mrs. Doubtfire persona, Daniel explains that this is just part of his idea for a children's show. When Stu begins choking and Miranda calls for help, Daniel in his Mrs. Doubtfire disguise comes to his aid.\n\nUnfortunately, while helping Stu, Daniel's disguise is exposed, and a shocked and angry Miranda leaves the restaurant with the children. During the next day in court, and despite Daniel's pleas that he has a stable job and an income, the judge rules in favor of Miranda having sole custody of their children. He informs Daniel that because of his behavior in posing as a 60-year-old housekeeper, he is not allowed to visit his children without supervision and that he must seek counseling for a year. Daniel is depressed and Miranda feels guilty for what she's done - especially when she sees how upset the children are.\n\nHis new Children's TV show, \"Euphegenia's House\" becomes a hit as it starts airing across the country. Miranda is surprised, and she decides to visit Daniel at the studio while he's taking a break. She apologizes to him for what she put him through and that their family is happier when he's with them. She asks the judge to grant him joint custody of their children, allowing him to spend time with their children every day after school. Now able to spend time with his children properly as himself, Daniel takes them out for a day of fun, while Miranda watches an episode of his new TV show, in which he's in his Mrs. Doubtfire disguise, and he reads a letter from a young girl whose parents have separated. He explains that no matter what arrangements families have, love will prevail.\n\nCasting[]\n\nRobin Williams wasn't the first choice for the role of Daniel Hillard/Mrs. Doubtfire.\n\nTim Allen and Warren Beatty were both originally considered for the part - both of them turned it down.\n\nOther actors were also briefly considered - including Tom Hanks, Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, Mel Gibson, Harrison Ford, Bryan Cranston, Rowan Atkinson, Rick Moranis, Jeff Daniels, John Ritter and Jim Carrey."
