        "text": "“Sounds like an amazing woman. Too good to be true,” Daniel quips about Mrs Doubtfire, yet she was true, at least for the millions of people around the world who found themselves doubled over with laughter at the antics of cross-dressing father Daniel.\n\nMrs Doubtfire was one of Robin Williams’ most memorable characters, but what were some of his best quotes in not only that role but some of the others that inspired a generation of moviegoers?\n\nMrs Doubtfire\n\n[Mrs Sellner: “Mr Hillard, do you consider yourself humorous?”] Daniel: “I used to. There was a time when I found myself funny, but today you have proven me wrong. Thank you.”\n\n“My first day as a woman and I'm getting hot flashes”.\n\nAs Doubtfire: “Alright, listen to me. I’m not who you think I am” [Chris: Yeah, no sh**] Reverting to Daniel: “Watch your mouth, young man”.\n\nDead Poets Society\n\n“They're not that different from you, are they? Same haircuts. Full of hormones, just like you. Invincible, just like you feel. The world is their oyster. They believe they're destined for great things, just like many of you, their eyes are full of hope, just like you. Did they wait until it was too late to make from their lives even one iota of what they were capable? Because, you see gentlemen, these boys are now fertilizing daffodils. But if you listen real close, you can hear them whisper their legacy to you. Go on, lean in. Listen, you hear it? - Carpe - hear it? - Carpe, carpe diem, seize the day boys, make your lives extraordinary.”\n\n“Boys, you must strive to find your own voice. Because the longer you wait to begin, the less likely you are to find it at all. Thoreau said, \"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation.\" Don't be resigned to that. Break out!”\n\n“There's a time for daring and there's a time for caution, and a wise man understands which is called for.”\n\nAladdin\n\n(As Genie exiting the lamp) “Oi! 10,000 years will give you such a crick in the neck.”\n\n“Excuse me. Are you looking at me? Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up? Did you bring me here? And all of a sudden you’re walking out on me. I don’t think so. Not right now. You're getting your wishes so SIT DOWN!”\n\n“I’m free. I’m free. Quick, quick, wish for something outrageous, say ‘I, I, want the Nile’, wish for the Nile, try that.” [Aladdin: Err I wish for the Nile] “No way! (pointing) Hahahaha. Oh does that feel good!”\n\nHook\n\n“You’re a complex Freudian hallucination having something to do with my mother and I don’t know why you have wings, but you have very lovely legs and you’re a very nice tiny person and what am I saying. I don’t know who my mother was. I’m an orphan and I’ve never taken drugs because I missed the sixties - I was an accountant.\n\n[Granny Wendy: “So, your adventures are over.”] Peter: “Oh no, to live. To live would be an awfully big adventure.”\n\nGood Morning Vietnam\n\n“Goooooood morning, Vietnam! It’s 0600 hours. What does the ‘O’ stand for? O my God, it’s early!”\n\nJumanji\n\n“26-years-ago we started playing a little game and now, we’re all gonna sit down and we’re gonna finish it. And guess what? Your turn.”\n\nGood Will Hunting\n\n“You don’t know about real loss beacuse it only occurs when you’ve loved something more than you love yourself. I doubt you’ve ever dared to love anybody that much.”\n\n“You’re not perfect, sport, and let me save you the suspense: this girl you’ve met, she’s not perfect either. But the question is whether or not you’re perfect for each other.”\n\nThe Fisher King\n\n“There’s three things in this world that you need: Respect for all kinds of life, a nice bowel movement on a regular basis, and a navy blazer.”\n\nJack\n\n“Please, don't worry so much. Because in the end, none of us have very long on this Earth. Life is fleeting. And if you're ever distressed, cast your eyes to the summer sky when the stars are strung across the velvety night. And when a shooting star streaks through the blackness, turning night into day, make a wish and think of me. Make your life spectacular.”\n\nMork & Mindy\n\n\"He stole your necklace, he stole your ribs, he’s obviously not kosher\"\n\n\"Look, if I wanted a pen and coffee I'd have mugged a waitress.\""
