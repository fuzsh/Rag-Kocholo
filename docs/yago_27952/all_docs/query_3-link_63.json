        "text": "\"He was very sensitive and intuitive,\" Field told 'Vanity Fair' in an interview surrounding the 10-year anniversary of Williams' death\n\nSally Field recalled a moment of kindness that she experienced with her Mrs. Doubtfire costar Robin Williams during a recent interview with Vanity Fair\n\nThe star explained that Williams \"was very sensitive and intuitive,\" about the death of her father\n\n\"He made it happen — they shot around me the rest of the day,\" Field said. \"I could go back to my house, call my brother and make arrangements.\"\n\nSally Field is remembering a touching gesture from her Mrs. Doubtfire costar Robin Williams.\n\nThe actress was one of several costars of Williams who spoke with Vanity Fair for a story ahead of the 10th anniversary of his death and revealed that the late actor once prioritized her mental health while they were in the middle of shooting the 1993 family dramedy.\n\n\"I was in the camper outside of the courtroom where we were shooting the divorce scene,\" recalled Field, 77. \"My father had a stroke a couple of years before, and was in a nursing facility. I got a phone call from the doctor saying my father had passed, a massive stroke. He asked if I wanted them to put him on the resuscitator. I said 'No, he did not want that. Just let him go. And please lean down and say, \"Sally says goodbye.\" ' \"\n\nAnd while she was \"of course beside myself,\" the two-time Oscar winner \"came on the set trying with all my might to act\" and \"wasn’t crying.\" But Williams could clearly tell something was amiss as he \"came over, pulled me out of the set and asked, 'Are you okay?' \"\n\nOnce she told him her father had just died, Williams said, “ 'Oh my God, we need to get you out [of] here right now.' ”\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories.\n\nRelated: 'Mrs. Doubtfire' Child Star Lisa Jakub Recalls How Robin Williams Helped Her Through Depression\n\n\"And he made it happen — they shot around me the rest of the day,\" Field recalled. \"I could go back to my house, call my brother and make arrangements.\"\n\n\"It’s a side of Robin that people rarely knew: He was very sensitive and intuitive,\" she added.\n\nCostarring Pierce Brosnan and Harvey Fierstein, Mrs. Doubtfire follows voice actor Daniel Hillard (Williams), a devoted father of three to Lydia (Lisa Jakub), Chris (Matthew Lawrence) and Natalie (Mara Wilson) who is struggling to find work and whose personality is at odds with that of his wife, Miranda (Field).\n\nWhen Miranda asks for a divorce, Daniel goes to great lengths to spend time with their children, eventually donning an elaborate getup to become \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" a nanny and housekeeper whom Miranda hires to watch over the kids — before things go haywire.\n\nThe cast of the film, which inspired a 2021 Broadway musical of the same time, has reunited in the past, sharing fond memories of working together and with Williams, who died in 2014 at age 63.\n\nRelated: Mrs. Doubtfire Child Stars Reunite Over 30 Years After Movie's Release: 'Still Feels Like Family'\n\nWhile he had his fair share of dramatic roles, Williams was known for his comedic chops, both on screen and of the stand-up variety. And in real life, he contained multitudes.\n\n\"People are always surprised when I tell them that Robin could be very quiet,\" Wilson, now 37, told Vanity Fair. \"When I was 9, we did a table read of What Dreams May Come, shortly after my mother had died.\"\n\n\"He came up to me and very gently asked how I was, and how my family was, but didn’t bring up anything that could have been painful. He was just very sweet,\" she added.\n\nAnd despite it being nearly a decade since Williams' own death, Field told the outlet, \"I keep thinking of him as 'is,' \" as opposed to \" 'was.' \"\n\n\"He can’t have left; he can’t. He’s still here. I feel him,\" she added.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
