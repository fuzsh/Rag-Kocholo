        "text": "Mrs. Doubtfire's kids are all grown up.\n\nOn Wednesday, Lisa Jakub and Mara Wilson shared photos from a reunion with Matthew Lawrence 30 years after they starred as siblings in \"Mrs. Doubtfire.\"\n\n\"We had a little reunion. ðŸ¥° 30 years later and my Mrs. Doubtfire family still feels like family,\" Jakub captioned a photo of the trio on Threads.\n\nIn another post via Instagram, Jakub revealed that she and Wilson went on the \"Brotherly Love\" podcast with real-life siblings Matthew, Andrew and Joey Lawrence.\n\n\"The sisters had so much fun hanging out with the brothers. @marawilson and @matthewlawrence still feel like my siblings- even 30 years after filming 'Mrs Doubtfire.' And @andrewlawrence and @joeylawrence are just part of the extended family,\" she captioned a photo with all five of them. \"I had a great time doing the @officialbrotherlylovepod and canâ€™t wait to share it with you.\"\n\nWilson shared the same photos, and captioned, \"So funny that the same week I went to San Francisco, I got to reunite with my Doubtfire siblings! Itâ€™s always a joy to see @lisa.jakub and @matthewlawrence, and always so much fun to be on @officialbrotherlylovepod.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Doubtfire\" filmed in San Francisco and starred the late Robin Williams as the titular character who goes under disguise as a nanny amid his messy divorce from ex-wife Miranda Hillard (Sally Field) in order to see his kids: Jakub as Lydia Hillard, Matthew Lawrence as Chris Hillard and Mara Wilson as Natalie Hillard.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor and comedian died by suicide on Aug. 11, 2014, at age 63. At the time, Williams' rep Mara Buxbaum told USA TODAY he had been \"battling severe depression of late.\"\n\nMatthew Lawrence talks #MeToo movement, says director 'asked me to take my clothes off'\n\nThe onscreen siblings reunited with Pierce Brosnan, who played Miranda's boyfriend, Stu, in 2018 to mark the film's 25th anniversary.\n\nThe stars also reminisced about Williams and said it was hard keeping their composure around his ad-libbing humor. \"We did a lot of takes,\" Wilson said. \"It'd be like take 25 and Robin would be different every time.\"\n\n\"Every take was something new and different and obviously amazing,\" Lawrence chimed in.\n\nBut Jakub noted that Williams made a bigger impact on her with his honesty about mental health and addiction.\n\n\"One of the most powerful things for me about working with him is that he was very open and honest with me talking about his issues with addiction, depression,\" she said. \"That was so powerful to me at 14. I have struggled with anxiety my whole life.\"\n\nContributing: Sara Moniuszko"
