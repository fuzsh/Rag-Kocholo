I wouldn't want to do it without him, personally.\"\n\nWhen asked whether a sequel could be made to, in some way, honour Williams, Lawrence said: \"I don't know, maybe. That's up to Chris Columbus and the creators and stuff.\"\n\nMore like this\n\nHowever, when the prospect of a documentary about the making of the film was raised, Lawrence responded: \"I never thought about that but documentaries are pretty cool. So, I don't know, maybe we could do that.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nRyan Gosling reveals how The Fall Guy incorporated real life into scenes\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes director: 'Andy Serkis is the godfather of apes'\n\nRebel Wilson, who is starring in the new film The Almond and the Seahorse, recently told RadioTimes.com that her move into drama for that film was inspired by Williams.\n\nShe explained that she was working on Night of the Museum 3 with Williams a month or two before his death, and that he asked to speak with her.\n\nWilson explained: \"He goes, 'You should be doing drama. I can see it in you.' And then, after his death, Zelda [Williams's daughter] said, 'I just wanted you to know my dad said such great things [about you].'\n\n\"After that, I was thinking, 'It would be good to do something,' but because the comedy stuff was going so well, I didn’t really get any opportunities.\""
