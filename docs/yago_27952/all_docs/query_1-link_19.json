        "text": "Thank you for inspiring us and making us laugh through the years.\n\nMrs. Doubtfire will always be in my top favorites ♥.\n\nThis photo was taken just over the weekend while visiting Madame Tussaud’s Wax Museum in Hollywood.\n\nI wish I had the chance to meet him in person as I’ve been a fan for many years and was always amazed at how talented he was.\n\nThe movie Mrs. Doubtfire is very special to me as my father who I did not grew up with and did not meet until I was 13 years old sent me a VHS tape of the movie as a gift. I can’t count on my fingers how many times I’ve watched the movie and it never fails to make me laugh to this day. I was so excited when I heard about a possible sequel a few months ago and that Sally Field is interested to reprise her role as Miranda Hillard but with Robin Williams’s untimely passing, I don’t think that’s even possible now as I don’t think anyone can portray the character of Mrs. Doubtfire any better than he did. That role fit him like a glove!\n\nIt’s a big loss for the entertainment industry but more so for his family.\n\nI pray that they will all find peace and solace during this difficult time in the wonderful memories they had with their loved one. ♥"
