        "text": "On November 22, 1993, the beloved late actor Robin Williams gave life to a funny housekeeper who could “hip-hop, be-bop, dance till ya drop, and yo yo, make a wicked cup of cocoa” when he produced and starred in the quintessential family film Mrs. Doubtfire. Williams delivered a hilarious yet touching portrayal of a man desperate to see his three children (played by Mara Wilson, Lisa Jakub and Matthew Lawerence) after his unfortunate split from his wife (Sally Field). To try and get more time with his kids, Williams’ character dresses as a plump, elderly woman and poses as a Scottish nanny, and the humor, sincerity and heart in every scene made made it one of the most defining roles of his career. In honor of the movie’s 30th anniversary, we decided to round up each Mrs. Doubtfire cast member to see what they have been up to since this iconic movie aired.\n\nAnd we were in for some surprises! For example, did you know that three of the stars from this movie have become published authors? Or that this actor wrote a Tony-winning Broadway play? Neither did we! And this list has all of that and more…\n\nMrs. Doubtfire cast then and now"
