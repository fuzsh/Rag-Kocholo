        "text": "Mara Wilson, Lisa Jakub and Matthew Lawrence haven’t acted on screen together in 31 years, but their work in the 1993 comedy classic “Mrs. Doubtfire” will always make them an iconic movie trio for a generation of moviegoers. The three actors starred as the children of Robin Williams and Sally Field’s characters in the film, which became a blockbuster three decades ago as the second highest-grossing movie of 1993 with $441 million worldwide.\n\n“So funny that the same week I went to San Francisco, I got to reunite with my ‘Doubtfire’ siblings!” Wilson posted on social media along with a photo of the co-stars reuniting. “It’s always a joy to see Lisa Jakub and Matthew Lawrence.”\n\nMore from Variety\n\n'Lisa Frankenstein' Director Zelda Williams on Making Her First Feature and What Happened When a Prosthetic Penis Went Missing\n\nRobin Williams Read a 'Really Strong' Script for 'Mrs. Doubtfire 2' Before His Death and Had Only One Question: 'Do I Have to Be in the Suit as Much This Time?'\n\nRobin Williams Improvised So Much on 'Mrs. Doubtfire' That 2 Million Feet of Film Was Shot; Director Still Has 972 Boxes Full of Outtakes and More\n\nJakub added that “the sisters had so much fun hanging out with the brothers,” and that Wilson and Lawrence “still feel like my siblings, even 30 years after filming ‘Mrs Doubtfire.'”\n\n“Mrs. Doubtfire” director Chris Columbus revealed to Business Insider last year that talks for a sequel to the movie only started in 2014, shortly before Robin Williams’ death. Without the actor, there was not a shot that Columbus would ever make a follow-up.\n\n“It’s an interesting thing. Back then, there was an attitude that sequels were looked down upon by the artists. So Robin was against doing a sequel immediately after,” Columbus said. “He and I didn’t talk about a sequel until the year he passed away.”\n\n“We had a script that was written and it was the last time I saw Robin,” he continued. “I went to his house and we sat down and talked about it and the script was really strong. Robin’s only comment was, ‘Boss, do I have to be in the suit as much this time?’ It was physically demanding. For Robin, I think it was like running a marathon every day he was in the Doubtfire costume. He was older, obviously. So we talked about it and I think he was hoping in the rewrite we would cut back on the Doubtfire character. But then Robin passed away so there will never be a sequel to ‘Mrs. Doubtfire.’”\n\nWilliams starred in “Mrs. Doubtfire” as a recently divorced actor who disguises himself as an elderly female housekeeper so that he can continue to see his children.\n\nColumbus also revealed in his Business Insider interview that Williams improvised so much on set that he recorded two million feet of film during production. The filmmaker still has boxes full of footage that he is hoping to turn into a documentary one day.\n\n“There are roughly 972 boxes of footage from ‘Doubtfire’ — footage we used in the movie, outtakes, behind-the-scenes footage — in a warehouse somewhere and we would like to hire an editor to go in and look at all of that footage,” Columbus said. “We want to show Robin’s process. There is something special and magical about how he went about his work and I think it would be fun to delve into it. I mean, there’s 2 million feet of film in that warehouse so there could be something we can do with all of that.”\n\nCheck out Wilson and her co-stars’ reunion in the post below.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nWhat's Coming to Netflix in May 2024\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in May 2024"
