        "text": "Though out this movie you see problem solving though the narrative. In the film Mrs. Doubtfire you first see a cartoon with a bird about to smoke a cigarette and Daniel Hillard played by Robin Williams does not want to be a part of this. He is doing the voice of the animated bird and does not think it is right for a children’s character to be smoking. This sets the movie up as him being a loving and caring father because he does not want his or any other children to see a character smoking on TV. After quitting that job. It cuts to him picking up his kids from school. This shows how Daniel puts his children first even quitting his job. Even though this is not the ideal way to save that problem.\n\nThe family adapted well when Miranda hired Mrs. Doubtfire as a nanny who did everything as Miranda desired. Mrs. Doubtfire was Daniel in disguise and was willing to adapt to Miranda’s way of life just to be closer to his children. Although kids missed their father but got along well with Mrs. Doubtfire who helped them with increased sense of responsibilities, such as keeping the house clean, do chores, and better their grades in school. Miranda was now able to focus more on her work and also spend more time with Stu while not having to worry about her kids.\n\nImagine being a thirteen year old girl walking home from school with your best friend. Out of nowhere a bully punches your friend in the eye. Since that day he hasn’t spoken to you. You feel a little part of your heart die. After many conflicts within her relationships she still maintains healthy relationships. Miranda and Sal had a great relationship until a bully changed that. Since they aren’t in best turms Miranda developed better relationships with Julia and Miranda’s mom. Each character and Miranda go through many changes with their relationships.\n\nCounting by 7s’ main character is Willow Chance, a little girl who has lost two sets of parents in her short life – she never knew her blood parents and her adoptive ones die in a terrible accident. She is all alone in the world apart from Dell, a school counsellor whose therapy methods are completely unprofessional; and from a couple of new friends she has met recently.

At the beginning of the story, the people living in Maycomb County, can be considered \"mockingbirds\" because they are innocent. Their father, Atticus, leads as a strong example while defending Tom Robinson, a black man convicted for rape. The residents of Maycomb (besides the Finches) fail to see situations through other people's eyes. For example, when the trial takes place, most people do not have empathy toward Tom Robinson, resulting in some of those \"mockingbirds\" becoming killed. Trying to see situations through other people's eyes can keep someone from hurting somebody who is innocent.\n\nThe film Mrs. Doubtfire is about a family who is in some turmoil. The mother (Miranda) of the family has requested a divorce from the husband (Daniel) and has denied him custody of their three children (Lydia, Chris, and Natalie). In response, the husband chooses to dress up as an elderly woman and is hired as the housekeeper and children’s nanny (Mrs. Doubtfire). The film portrays divorce using a comedic element. After the Mrs. Doubtfire is revealed to be the husband in disguise the mother petitions the court and is granted full custody. However, the children do not adjust to this change well. The children’s difficulty adjusting to the change prompts Miranda to seek out Daniel to change the custody arrangement.

Mrs. Doubtfire reassures the little girl, that no matter what the family arrangements are, love will\n\nClassic stories have a protagonist who involuntarily steps into struggles, obstacles, and times of self-reflection. The reader envisions the character throughout the plot fighting barriers and instinctively discovers how the character progresses from the beginning, many times having to face personal conflict, to see positive change in the end. In Harper Lee’s, To Kill A Mockingbird, the main focus and perspective are from Scout who comes face to face with challenges along her journey. She must learn to become the person who she wants to be without the negative impacts of the environment and traditional values she succumbs to. Through the significance of the Cunningham’s, Reverend Sykes, and Miss Maudie, the juxtaposition Scout embraces among these characters help her grow to understand the importance of seeing the\n\nMrs. Doubtfire is a film that focuses on a marriage going through a divorce. As a result of the divorce Daniel, the father, is only allowed to see his children once a week. In an attempt to spend more time with his children, Daniel disguises as the perfect old English nanny that his wife, Miranda, is looking to hire. As the new nanny, Daniel becomes the perfect father and spouse. In this film not only do you see the many different types of relationships, you also see concepts of interpersonal communication entwined. The first two concepts of interpersonal communication running through the film are those of relationship deterioration and repair. The third concept that is weaved throughout the entire film is that of using humor to reduce\n\nThe movie Mrs. Doubtfire takes place in an upper-middle-class neighborhood with a typical all-American family being shaken up after a divorce. As a carefree father, who is deprived of his custodial rights to his children, we have Daniel Hilliard as recently unemployed, aspiring talented actor with a few tricks up his sleeve in order to preserve quality time with his children. On the other side of the family court, we have Miranda Hilliard, as a demanding executive interior designer, and the sole bread-winner that is tired of her ex-husband irresponsible ways and prosecutes him for it. The couple had three children, the eldest Lydia Hillard as the feisty and responsible teenager, Chris\n\nIn Harper Lee’s “To Kill A Mockingbird,” Mayella Ewell, a young woman as well as the daughter of Bob Ewell, lives a life of insolence and isolation in the town of Maycomb. As a Ewell, which they are familiarized as being vulgar, uneducated, and indigent, Mayella is disrespected by the people of Maycomb as well as by her father. During the court case, Atticus shows courtesy towards Mayella by addressing her as a miss and a ma’am, which is not surprising for his values of equality. Mistaking his manners with sarcasm, she replies with, “Won’t answer a word you say as long as you keep mockin’ me” (pg.181). Harper Lee is demonstrating the amount of disregard Mayella faces in her life, so much that courtesy can’t be identified as just that. Mayella finds that Atticus is ridiculing her for what she doesn’t have, respect from others. With a reputation such as Mayella’s, people treat her like an outcast. Her lonely life can be a reason to explain why she always asked for Tom Robinson’s company, she wanted to experience friendship and perhaps love for the first time. Her loneliness was so clear to see, even Scout, who still has their childhood-innocent mind, can see through it. Scout compares Mr.Dolphus Raymond’s “mixed children” to Mayella because they both don’t know where to stand in their social class, “white people wouldn’t have anything to do with her because she lived among pigs; Negroes wouldn’t have anything to do with her\n\nCan you recollect a person that you hate all the time? Is this person rude, not sociable, emotionally abusive, or just plain racist? In To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee, the novel digs deep into the roots of Social Classes. One of these classes, in particular, is “White Trash.” “White Trash” is a class that has the poor white people that don’t contribute much to society and sometimes even make the society worse. There is one character that everyone loathes in Maycomb, and he is Mr. Ewell. Harper Lee portrays Mr. Ewell and his kids as uneducated, racist, murderous pigs because of three reasons. This family disrespects other members of the community in cruel ways, abuses their power by accusing a black man of rape, and tries to kill two\n\nImagine you are a lawyer tasked with an impossible case, and everybody in your community is against you, but still there is a shred of hope you cling to. What might that be you ask? That to which you cling are your morals. In To Kill a Mockingbird Atticus Finch had been given the Tom Robinson case, where a black man was convicted of raping a white woman. As a single father of two children, he continues to reinforce his values throughout the trial and during his daunting task of raising his children. In To Kill A Mockingbird what Harper Lee suggests about the nature of morals is that you should try to stand up for what you believe in even if people oppose or reject your ideals. Even when faced with an insurmountable opposition you should stand up for your morals because in the end if your don't follow your beliefs you are just contributing to the problem. We should try to create a voice for what we believe in and impress that upon the next generation so they can continue to exercise their beliefs to make the world a better place."
