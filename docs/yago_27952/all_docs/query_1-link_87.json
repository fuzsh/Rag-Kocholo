        "text": "IT is 7 P.M., and Robin Williams has just returned home from taping \"The Arsenio Hall Show.\" His two younger children are scampering and laughing in the hallway, and Mr. Williams, wearing a black shirt and baggy pleated pants, steps into the living room and sits wearily on a footstool.\n\nHis wife, Marsha, brings him a Coke. He tries to stifle a yawn. He has jet lag from a London flight earlier in the day, and he has barely had time to unpack.\n\n\"The land is so nice,\" he says. \"Pool's in the back. Tennis court's in front. There's even a tree house. Which is for rent. A sublet.\" He smiles.\n\nThe living room in the elegant and sedate two-story rented home in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles is open and spare. There are several pieces of Mexican art and modern art, a ficus plant and a low varnished rattan table. Zelda, Mr. Williams's 3-year-old daughter, wanders in and he embraces her.\n\nMr. Williams, perhaps the most inventive comedian of his generation, is in the midst of a blizzard of promotion for his new film, \"Toys,\" a fantasy directed by Barry Levinson, which opened on Dec. 18. (He has worked with Mr. Levinson before; the director's 1987 film, \"Good Morning, Vietnam,\" was a breakthrough in Mr. Williams's movie career.)\n\n\" 'Toys' is a very whimsical, strange feast, almost a nonmusical musical,\" says Mr. Williams, who plays a childlike heir to a toy factory. \"I hope people enjoy the ride.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
