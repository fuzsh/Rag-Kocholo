        "text": "We know Robin Williams for being one of the greatest actors around. While Williams had a lot of unforgettable roles in movies, he made a lasting impression on those with the privilege of knowing him in many positive ways. On the set of one of 20th Century Fox’s best movies Mrs. Doubtfire, Sally Field shares the sweet way her talented co-star supported her after her father passed away.\n\nOn the 10th anniversary of Robin Williams’ passing, many friends and colleagues spoke to Vanity Fair about how the Oscar-winning actor would go out of his way to make anyone laugh. However, Williams was also there for those who needed comfort like Sally Field whose life was hit with tragedy on the set of one of Field's best films Mrs. Doubtfire.\n\nIt’s a heartbreaking story to find out about your father’s passing while you’re shooting a movie. I can’t even imagine what that must feel like. The comedy-drama film already had her character going through a marriage break-up we’re still not over and other depressing scenes from the movie that were ultimately deleted, dealing with a real-life tragedy on top of filming hard scenes must have been a lot to handle.\n\nWhile Robin Williams and Sally Field were co-stars on Mrs. Doubtfire, they still had a powerful bond even when the cameras were off. As the Hook actor was able to see the clear pain of Field before knowing what it was, he found a sweet way to provide support for her when she needed it:\n\nIt does my own heart good to hear stories of compassion about a man known to incite laughter in his audience. That care and goodness was present in Robin Williams through a lot of people he got to know. He helped Sharon Osbourne, ready to give up chemo, get through her treatment by coming to her house and making her laugh which motivated her to return to treatment. Williams also helped Steven Spielberg continue with the Holocaust film Schindler’s List by doing a standup routine for him over the phone. The Good Will Hunting actor truly had a gift for brightening the day for those going through dark times."
