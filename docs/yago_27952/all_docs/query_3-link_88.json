        "text": "In a heartfelt revelation, actress Sally Field shared a moving story about the late Robin Williams during the filming of the beloved movie Mrs. Doubtfire.\n\nThe story, which she recently recounted to Vanity Fair on the 10th anniversary of Williams' passing, highlights a lesser-known side of the legendary actorâ€”his deep sensitivity and intuition.\n\nBy Rhododendrites | By Kingkongphoto & celebrity-photos.com\n\nField described a day on set when she received devastating news: her father had passed away after suffering a stroke.\n\nDespite her grief, Field tried to continue working, but Williams immediately sensed something was wrong. He gently pulled her aside, asked if she was okay, and upon learning of her loss, insisted that she be allowed to leave the set.\n\nSally recounted the story to Vanity Fair as follows:\n\n\"Robin came over, pulled me out of the set, and asked, 'Are you okay?'\"\n\nSally: \"Yes, why?\"\n\nRobin: \"I don't know, just thought [I'd ask] that.\"\n\nSally: \"No, I'm not, Robin. My father just passed.\"\n\nRobin: \"Oh my God, we need to get you out here right now.\"\n\nThanks to Williams' insistence, Field was able to return home, contact her brother, and make arrangements for her father. Reflecting on that moment, she noted, \"It's a side of Robin that people rarely knew: He was very sensitive and intuitive.\"\n\nRobin passed away on August 11, 2014.\n\nSally Field image CC BY-SA 4.0.
