        "text": "Mrs. Doubtfire introduced us to the magic that was Robin Williams...in a dress, wig, and those tanned tights only grannies would wear.\n\nWith classic one-liners, Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire was a hip granny who could hip-hop, be-bop dance till you drop and yo-yo made a wicked cup of cocoa. Underneath it all, it also showed us the extent a father would go to see his kids after he and his wife divorced.\n\n30 years on (yes, can you believe it), we can still quote the lines but when it comes to the actors in the movie where are they now?\n\nRobin Williams as Mrs. Doubtfire\n\nHow can we not begin with the man who made the movie what it was, the one and only Robin Williams. The star's success continued for several years after appearing in classics such as Jumanji, Patch Adams, and The Night at the Museum. In 1997 he picked up an Oscar for his role Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting.\n\nIn 2014, the director of Mrs. Doubtfire Chris Columbus had gone to Robin with a script for a sequel. Chatting to Business Insider Chris told him the only question asked by the actor was 'Boss, do I have to be in the suit as much this time?' Chris went on to explain how it 'was physically demanding. For Robin, I think it was like running a marathon every day he was in the Doubtfire costume.'\n\nOver the years though while he made everyone laugh, the star suffered massively with his mental health and just before his death was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia.\n\nOn August 11, 2014, Robin died by suicide at age 63. Since his death two of his children Zak and Zelda have worked hard to try and remove the stigma around mental health in honour of their father.\n\nSally Field as Miranda Hillard\n\nWe could just never understand why Miranda couldn't work it out with Dan.\n\nSally, who played the career-driven Miranda, was already a household name by the time Mrs. Doubtfire was released, and over the years that followed she went on to have more success.\n\nShe starred in the infamous Forrest Gump movie alongside Tom Hanks, and Legally Blonde 2 as well as TV roles on ER, Brothers & Sisters, Maniac and Dispatches from Elsewhere, and in recent times Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty and 80 For Brady.\n\nReleasing a memoir in 2018, fans got to see another side of the actress one where she spoke about abuse from her step-father and her ex-partner Burt Reynolds.\n\nShe has three children, Peter and Eli with ex-husband Steven Craig and Sam with second husband Alan Greisman. Her son Sam came out as gay at 20 and since then Sally has been a strong activist fighting for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nLisa Jakub as Lydia\n\nTaking on the role of the eldest sibling, Lisa was just 15 years old when she took on the role in 1993. She went on to star in other successful movies such as Independence Day. The Beautician and the Beast and George Lucas in Love\n\nHowever, in 2000 she took part in the last piece of work in front of the camera titled Double Frame.\n\nMarrying Jeremy Jones in 2005, these days she is known as an advocate of mental health as well as a yoga instructor.\n\nWith much talk about a possible documentary on Mrs Doubtfire, looking at outtakes from the movie. Lisa recently posted on her social media that she would definitely be on board.\n\nMatthew Laurence as Christopher\n\nMatthew Laurence was not one to shy away from the limelight after the success of Mrs. Doubtfire and would go on to star in several different roles.\n\nAlthough you will probably most remember him teaming up with his brother Joey and Andrew Laurence on the show Brotherly Love. They have since regrouped for the podcast Brotherly Love.\n\nHe played heart throb Jack Hunter on Boy Meets World. He then returned in 2015 for Disney Channel's Girls Meets World.\n\nHe starred in the film The Hot Chick in 2002 but since then has made small cameos in TV series and featured in holiday movies such as Mistletoe Mixup in 2021 and Christmas on Repeat in 2022.\n\nThe star has since made his way back into the papers as it is believed he has struck up a romance with Chilli from 90s band TLC.\n\nMara Wilson as Natalie Hillard\n\nShe was the epitome of cuteness in Mrs. Doubtfire playing the youngest sibling Natalie Hillard but today many would have to look twice at the star who is all grown up.\n\nMara, like her co-stars stayed in the movie industry for a while going on to star in Matilda alongside Danny Devito but soon after the star took a break and only returned to acting in 2012 making her mark on Broadway. She starred in productions such as Broadcity, Bojack Horseman, and the series Big Hero 6.\n\nIn recent years Mara has turned her hand to writing and published a memoir called Where Am I Now?: True Stories of Girlhood and Accidental Fame. She also gained recognition for two pieces she wrote, one for the Elle and the other for The New York Times that looked at the sexualisation of child stars in Hollywood.\n\nTo celebrate 30 years of the movie, Mara joined Matthew Laurence and his brothers on their podcast to chat all things Mrs. Doubtfire.\n\nPierce Brosnan as Stu Dunmeyer\n\nOnce again Irish people were so proud to see one of our own crop up as Pierce Brosnan played the gorgeous Stu, who had the hots for Miranda.\n\nAs most of you know Pierce went on to have a highly successful career in Hollywood becoming James Bond, as well as taking on the challenge of hitting those high notes in Mamma Mia. (Let's say no more about that Pierce.) To this day he is still making movies with his most recent being Cinderella, Black Adam and The Out-Laws in 2023.\n\nFamily life over the years certainly had its ups and downs for the Irish man. Two years before starring in Mrs Doubtfire he lost his first wife, Cassandra Harris to ovarian cancer.\n\nTen years later he went on to marry journalist Keely Shaye Smith and has five children between both marriages.\n\nIn 2013, tragedy struck once more when he lost his daughter Charlotte to ovarian cancer.\n\nPierce has not retired from Hollywood just yet but has invested more of his time in one of his most loved hobbies, painting in which he sells and donates the money to charity.\n\nHarvey Fierstein as Uncle Frank\n\nThe master behind the artwork and formation of Mrs. Doubtfire was all thanks to Uncle Frank.\n\nHarvey over the years has had his fingers in many pies featuring in Independence Day, Duplex, and voiced characters such as Yao in Disney's Mulan and several characters in Family Guy and Big Mouth.\n\nHe released a memoir in 2022 called I Was Better Last Night: A Memoir which became an instant success and a New York Times best seller.\n\nSo, why not take some time out of your busy schedule and sit down and remember how Robin made us laugh and why Mrs. Doubtfire is one of the greatest movies of all time."
