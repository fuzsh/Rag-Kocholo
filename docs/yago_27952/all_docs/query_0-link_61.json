        "text": "Lisa Jakub, who acted as Robin Williams' daughter in 1993's Mrs. Doubtfire, connected her work for veterans with her best-known costar as she revealed that he always ensured veterans could be involved in his films' crews. In a recent interview with Fox News Digital where she discussed her charity work for veterans, she said, \"So many people have told me that Robin did a lot of work with the veteran population as well, and that he always had production crews hire local veterans to be background actors or things like that on set, which is not something I ever knew about when I worked with him. But I also love that little connection as well.\"\n\nWilliams first opened up to Jakub regarding mental health concerns when they collaborated on the 1993 comedy drama. “[He was] probably one of the first people who ever really spoke to me super honestly about mental health,” the actor stated. “And he would talk to me about his struggles and the things that he went through. And it was the first time that I felt like, ‘Oh, I’m not a freak. I don’t have to hide this about myself. This is just something that some of us have to deal with.’”"
