(Photo by 20th Century-Fox/Getty Images)\n\nThe cast of Mrs. Doubtfire is bringing on a wave of nostalgia for its fans.\n\nThe iconic 1993-released movie featured Robin Williams (Daniel Hillard and the titular character, Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire)‚Äîwho tragically passed away in 2014‚Äîalong with Sally Field (Miranda Hillard), Pierce Brosnan (Stuart \"Stu\" Dunmeyer), and more.\n\nThe former child stars who portrayed Williams' children in the beloved comedy recently reunited to celebrate the film's 31st anniversary, taking to Instagram to share the photo.\n\nRelated: 12 Best Robin Williams Movies of All Time\n\nMatilda star Mara Wilson, who played the youngest of the kids, Natalie Hillard, shared the snapshot via Instagram on Wednesday, May 1, where she posed alongside her film siblings, Lisa Jakub (Lydia Hillard) and Matthew Lawrence (Chris Hillard).\n\n\"So funny that the same week I went to San Francisco, I got to reunite with my Doubtfire siblings! It‚Äôs always a joy to see @lisa.jakub and @matthewlawrence,\" Wilson wrote in the caption of the post, also revealing that she was a guest on The Brotherly Love Podcast, which is hosted by Lawrence and his actor brothers Joey and Andy.\n\nThe comment section of the upload was filled with fans who were delighted to see the trio together again after so many years.\n\n\"Feels like yesterday I was a kid watching yous on a Saturday movie night üåôüòä ‚ù§Ô∏è,\" one recollected, while another echoed that sentiment: \"Brings back memories! Robin Williams was there with Ya‚Äôll in spirit! He said HELLO!\"\n\n\"The Hillard children reunited! Way to go!\" a third proclaimed.\n\nSomeone else chimed in with, \"Love that you have all kept in touch. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§\"\n\n\"The Nostalgia. ‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è Love this,\" an additional Instagrammer penned, and we can't help but agree."
