        "text": "Mrs. Doubtfire is a movie from the early 1990s featuring Robin Williams as Daniel Hillard and Mrs. Doubtfire.\n\nLike What about Bob?, the scene that I have selected isn’t technically CPR, it is the Heimlich Maneuver. This one is a big moment of revelation in the film, as it is the culmination of a very crazy dinner where the character of Daniel Hillard must dine with two different parties as two different personas. The Heimlich Maneuver comes into play as the character played by Pierce Brosnan has an allergic reaction to the meal he is eating and Mrs. Doubtfire springs into action.\n\nSummary of Mrs. Doubtfire\n\nDaniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is no ordinary father, so when he learns his ex-wife (Sally Field) needs a housekeeper, he applies for the job. With the perfect wig, a little makeup and a dress for all occasions, he becomes Mrs. Doubtfire, a devoted British nanny who is hired on the spot. Free to be the “woman” he never knew he could be, the disguised Daniel creates a whole new life with his entire family.\n\nThanks to Julie Harden for the suggestion! CPR in Entertainment is a series based on rescue scenes found in both TV shows and movies. If you have a suggestion for a future entry, please comment below!"
