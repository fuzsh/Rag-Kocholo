        "text": "Men and Women: A fine line\n\nMrs. Doubtfire, a 1993 academy award winning comedic family drama, depicts the realities of divorce and custody battles. The battle for the children ends in sole custody to the mother leaving the father out of the picture except for weekly Saturday supervised visitation, which is unfortunately what many families are go through today. Robin Williams’ character, Mrs. Doubtfire, realizes he didn’t know how to be a good father until he became a mother; consequently he didn’t appreciate his wife until he was put in her shoes.\n\nDaniel Hillard is a struggling father who loses his job in which he does voices for cartoon characters. When he throws a birthday party for his son everything he was comfortable with begins to take a turn for the worst. Miranda, Daniel’s wife, is fed up with his immature nature and declares she wants a divorce. During the hearing, he is told that he can only see the children on Saturday’s with supervised visitation; this is not enough time for him. How far would an ordinary father go to spend more time with his children? We are about to find out.\n\nHe is very proactive in his responsibility and once he finds out that Miranda is searching for a housekeeper, Daniel turns to his gay brother, Frank, a make-up expert, who helps disguise him as Mrs. Doubtfire; a nanny from heaven, so firm, so helpful, so reassuring, that if Daniel had been at all like this, he’d still be married.\n\nDaniel is a family centered person. He gets his sense of security from the family tradition and culture of the family reputation. This has influenced him to act as Mrs. Doubtfire in order to fulfill his fundamental values. What is exciting about being Mrs. Doubtfire is that he learns to be a good dad. Typically men don’t have the “housewife” role in the family, but that is the interesting twist in this movie. He is a man being portrayed as a woman; he is being portrayed as a nurturing mother. But do you think that from playing this role it could really make him a better dad? It may seem artificial and exaggerated but Mrs. Doubtfire did in fact teach Daniel just that. He learned how to manage his time between work and play. Because of his job he thought it was okay to joke around all day, but acting as Mrs. Doubtfire taught him there is a time and place for everything, and sometimes life isn’t all fun and games. Daniel learned he could be a mentor for his children without worrying about if they were his friends. They didn’t necessarily have to like him for him to know they loved him; he was forced to be the “bad guy” for once in his life which was what Miranda had been portrayed as their whole marriage.\n\nCooking, cleaning, taking care of the kids; these are typically thought to be chores of the mother. In Mrs. Doubtfire, Daniel Hillard is disguised as a woman, shown in the picture to the right, in order to play this role. He puts on a body suit to play Mrs. Doubtfire and immediately starts acting like a woman. Ask yourself, would different clothes, a touch of makeup, and an accent really change your attitude and instincts? Men and women have different instincts and attitudes, so it seems the role has been over exaggerated. As you can see from the picture, she is putting out a fire on her chest. From this scene we can scrutinize his efficiency as a woman; it looks like he’s having a difficult time adjusting to his new identity. This is not to say that all men cannot cook, but that it is typically seen as more of a woman’s job than a man’s.\n\nIn a recent article written by Monica Miller and Alicia Summers, the perceptions of gender roles are discussed in video games. The article focused on how video games portray men and women and the gender differences between the two. Miller states, “Males were more likely to be heroes and main characters, use more weapons, have more abilities, and were more muscular and powerful. Females were more often supplemental characters, more attractive, sexy, and innocent, and also wore more revealing clothing.” From this we can conclude that gender roles not only play a big part in this movie but in every type of media. By understanding the unspoken messages, we can be aware of the effects to the viewers (Summers and Miller).\n\nBecoming Mrs. Doubtfire allowed Daniel Hillard to appreciate his wife for what she did for the family; it made him realize what she went through every day. While walking in her shoes he wasn’t able to save his family but it showed him how to be a better father.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nSummers, Alicia, and Monica Miller. “Gender Differences in Video Game Characters’ Roles,\n\nAppearances, and Attire as Portrayed in Video Game Magazines.” Acedemic Search Premier.
