        "text": "Deborah Tannen’s essay “But What Do You Mean?” focuses on what she claims are differences between men and women when it comes to social interaction. The essay is sectioned into seven categories, in which she talks about how men and women tend to think and react when it comes to apologizing, criticizing, thanking, fighting, praising, complaining, and joking with others. In general, she seems to promote the idea that women tend to be more polite and refined, considering the feelings of others when conversing and taking everything as a formality. In contrast, men are apparently more blunt, taking a more direct approach with matters and being more unconcerned with how they may affect others. Women tend to automatically apologize and thank others\n\nFrom the beginning to the end, Capote continuously brings back a message of religion, whether it is Perry’s struggle to find meaning, “he was sorry, but it was not for him--heaven, hell, saints, divine mercy--...he was deceived and their friendship false, a counterfeit like the portrait” (Capote 57), or the town of Holcomb’s inadvertent image of a christian community, “But that’s impossible. Can you imagine Mr. Clutter missing church? Just to sleep?” (Capote 74). Alongside religion, masculinity and femininity play important roles in developing the story’s characters and events. On multiple occasions Perry makes comments on other people’s sexuality, Mr. Clutter being “fearless” and self assured, many townsmen going hunting, and Barbara’s vision of her Dad being a “real man”. To counteract these manly assertions, Capote includes various feminine themes: Bonnie stopping her education to marry Herb, Mrs. Kidwell struggling to support her and Sue, and Nancy’s “girlish” room. These recurring images enhance the reader’s perception of each character, allowing them to feel as though they are a part of the story. However, due to the movie’s time limit, introductory scenes were rushed and did not present these crucial themes as Capote\n\nInterpersonal communication is everywhere in society, both the past, present, and the future. “Marty,” a love story, and a movie made in the fifties, shows many examples of interpersonal communication. In this movie, the main character, Marty, who is a decent, socially awkward man who is pressured by his peers and family to find love and get married. He then gets fed up and goes to a club in town and meets a woman named Claire, who is in similar circumstances to him. Marty and Claire then interact and spend time together and Marty experiences companionship for the first time. As time goes on, Marty’s bachelor friends and his mother are expressing their disapproval of Claire. Marty then gets angry with everyone, and tells them all I\n\nThroughout the first half of Communication 101: Introduction to Human Communication we have been introduced to and discussed a lot of new concepts, ideas, and terms. All of this new material has been pertinent to how humans interact with one another, while also informing us of the why and how behind these interactions as well. The amount of new information we have learned would be impossible to cover and apply to one piece of pop culture, but a lot of what we have learned is relatable to the movie 50 First Dates. This 2004 movie featuring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore features numerous examples of normative relationships and key concepts that we have learned about in class. In this paper I will not only introduce communication terms\n\nIn this film, She’s the Man Olivia Hastings revolves around gender portrayal and her objection to join a men’s soccer team. She’s the Man demonstrates gender representation of femininity and masculinity through a number of characters. Olivia gets rejected and unable to join the men’s soccer team which shows how empowering it can be to be a female. Oliva’s brother Sebastian Hastings goes to London as his band got a spot to perform at a music festival for 2 weeks, so Olivia disguises to be Sebastian to be able to join the male soccer team. Both power and gender are big roles in the film as Viola continuously switches from being female to male and shows how much power both genders get.\n\nThe film “When Harry Met Sally” is rife with examples of interpersonal communication victories and utter failures. The main characters- Harry Burns played by Billy Crystal and Sally Albright played by Meg Ryan- are captive to each other’s company during a car ride from Chicago to New York and quickly find they maintain very opposite viewpoints on much of life, especially relationships between men and women. The premise for the argument and the remainder of the film is the disagreement as to whether or not women and men can be friends without sex getting in the way. Harry maintains it is not possible, and Sally takes the opposite position. Throughout the film Harry and Sally display a number of different communication traits. Their\n\nOne of the main structures within society that is unavoidably affected by gender roles is the family element. A gender role is a set of social standards dictating what types of behaviors are generally considered acceptable. These are usually centered around opposing conceptions of femininity and masculinity. In the film Mrs. Doubtfire, we see multiple unconventional male and female roles and how they play a part in the way that this family defies the stereotypical gender roles. Mrs. Doubtfire is about a man that disguises himself as an elderly, British nanny in efforts to spend more time with his children, after his divorce from their mother limits his visitation rights.\n\nThe film Mrs. Doubtfire is about a family who is in some turmoil. The mother (Miranda) of the family has requested a divorce from the husband (Daniel) and has denied him custody of their three children (Lydia, Chris, and Natalie). In response, the husband chooses to dress up as an elderly woman and is hired as the housekeeper and children’s nanny (Mrs. Doubtfire). The film portrays divorce using a comedic element. After the Mrs. Doubtfire is revealed to be the husband in disguise the mother petitions the court and is granted full custody. However, the children do not adjust to this change well. The children’s difficulty adjusting to the change prompts Miranda to seek out Daniel to change the custody arrangement. At the end of the movie, it is revealed to the children that the father will continue in his caregiving role without a disguise.\n\nTruman Capote’s novella, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, is an American classic that has spawned several multimedia adaptations, such as a film and multiple plays. It is a multi layered piece of work that contains several themes that can be found in various separate texts. These include, but are not limited to, the Triarchic Theory of Intelligence in the book Outliers, Gender Types and Roles in the play A Streetcar Named Desire, and Isolation and “Catching” in the novel Catcher in the Rye.\n\nMr. Ramsay symbolizes the conventional male gender role through his behavior as a dominating husband and father. As Mr. Ramsey listens to his wife and Lily converse with Mr. Tansely he thinks, As Mr. Ramsey is a staunch Christian, this quote can be a reference to a biblical allusion to the story of Adam and Eve. Eve was blamed by God for tempting Adam to eat the apple, and so the unfortunate consequences brought on by eating the apple was construed as Eve’s fault. From a literal perspective, Mr. Ramsey may view women as bad luck. Mr. Ramsey may be referring to how women’s beauty lures men astray from their right minds. We can also see this from the relationship Mr. Ramsey has with his son James. James is almost always enraged with his\n\nIt is impossible to get through life without communicating. Better interpersonal communication skills help us success in different aspects of our life. He’s just not that into you is the movie that I will analyze. In this movie, there are nine main characters and they live intertwine with one another either by being a friend, a couple, friend of a friend. In this paper, I will explore how Gigi is using interpersonal communication on the evolution of personal relationship; and how she applies better communication skills in her relationship with others. Terms that I will apply and analyze in the films are: Perception, stereotype, mind reading, prototype, verbal communication, and the ambiguous of language, the abstract of language,\n\nAfter watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows- Part Two, I was able to see how gender roles both differ and remain the same in this movie. Although some gender stereotypes apply to the film, I think many characters defy the stigmas typically assigned to males and females. Strong female roles, such as Hermione Granger, Molly Weasley, Professor McGonagall, and Luna Lovegood, help portray sturdy independent women who take charge. Reflecting on this movie, even as a dedicated Harry Potter fan, I have always admired how female actors in the series have had “the brains” in tricky situations. After watching the movie, I saw themes of power feminism, stereotyping, and negative connotations of males who express emotion.\n\nWhy do people want to change the way we live our life? I don’t fit in, so what? In the book “To Kill a Mockingbird”, Lee uses characterization and tone in order to convey the idea that in society every gender has to follow their code of conduct, consequently it restricts people from being themselves in order to fit in.\n\nThe movie Mrs. Doubtfire takes place in an upper-middle-class neighborhood with a typical all-American family being shaken up after a divorce. As a carefree father, who is deprived of his custodial rights to his children, we have Daniel Hilliard as recently unemployed, aspiring talented actor with a few tricks up his sleeve in order to preserve quality time with his children. On the other side of the family court, we have Miranda Hilliard, as a demanding executive interior designer, and the sole bread-winner that is tired of her ex-husband irresponsible ways and prosecutes him for it. The couple had three children, the eldest Lydia Hillard as the feisty and responsible teenager, Chris\n\nIn response to what we have discussed thus far in Interpersonal Communication, I would like to further explore the idea of gender in the interpersonal communication arena. As was said in class, ”gender influences cultural perspectives.” Gender also influences how we view ourselves in society. On the flip side, I’ve seen how society can mold the way we label ourselves in terms of gender."
