        "text": "Those of us who didn't know Robin Williams personally, felt as though we did. I did, as a child growing up in the ‘90s. That was the decade the actor dominated our screens, in all his face-crinkling, child-like wonder, in his explosive, angry sincerity. Williams taught us – as kids - that the world didn’t come packaged in a neat little box, that even adults were fallible, and that it wasn’t so bad to feel helpless. He taught us these things because he was honest with us.\n\nIn the family mega-hits that defined Williams’ career during that decade, he had a rawness and honesty that was new to those of used to other comedy actors schlepping through big budget 'family friendly' roles with gritted teeth. One never felt that there was a smug, million-dollar pay check in Williams’ eyes, even as he ran around in a green leotard, or an old ladies’ wig, or a ten-year-old’s t-shirt.\n\nThis was never more evident than in his role in 1993’s Chris Columbus comedy Mrs. Doubtfire, which saw Williams cast as a down-and-out voice actor on the brink of losing custody of his kids in a bitter divorce. His hopelessly misguided and hilarious solution? To dress up in drag and pretend to be a British nanny to his own children.\n\nWhile an actor possessing even an inch of self-satisfaction in this role might have left us feeling cold, we instead get a brutally earnest performance from Williams, whose bright blue eyes flash with a mix of real pain and adoration and desperation behind layers of latex and makeup and pharmacy-bought spectacles. There was no layer between us and him, either. We felt everything he did. The lessons he learned were passed on to us.\n\nIn 1993’s Hook, Williams played a self-absorbed businessman who has forgotten what it is to feel joy. His transformation throughout the movie is played with unabashed wholeheartedness, from the desperate epiphany that he’s been a poor father to embracing the silly joy of both a metaphorical and literal “Neverland.” As a child, I remember thinking how well Williams tapped into what it was like to be a child, how well he seemed to get what it felt like, his face breaking into a wild grin as it clicked into place.\n\nIt was this all-or-nothing approach that meant Williams was such a great fit for these down-and-out characters, those defined by their lack of dignity, or helplessness, or ridiculousness, those who could be considered ‘losers.’ Even his performance as the Genie in Aladdin - which we remember as freewheeling and breathless - upon reflection contains real nuance.\n\nThe Genie is trapped, of course, in a cycle of doing bad things for greedy people, and we hear that in Williams’ voice, and we hear that voice crack at the realization that he is finally free. In Jack, he gave everything he could to a 10-year-old boy who was prematurely aging in the body of a 40-year-old man. In The Birdcage - which we saw once we were a little bit older - we see a real emotional struggle as his character Armand tries to maintain the otherwise hilarious charade of being straight despite his homosexuality.\n\nThey were all performances that could so easily have been one-note, performances where we just laughed at the silly man on screen and left the cinema with the film quickly slipping out of our small heads. But Williams just wasn’t that kind of actor. He loved his characters, and so we loved him.\n\nThroughout his career, Robin Williams gave so much to the people who met him along the way. Just take a look at the outpouring of grief and memories from his peers on social media today. But he gave so much of himself to those who didn’t know him, too. Those of us who watched him from their small cinema seats in rural towns, or on old VHS tapes from the living rooms we camped out in on bean bags, or in dark schoolrooms with the teacher skulking outside with a cigarette.\n\nAnd perhaps, ultimately, life took too much of out of Williams. This is the pain we must bear today. But we will carry his legacy - the body of work that he gave his all- - with us for the rest of our lives. Lucy O'Brien is Entertainment Editor at IGN AU.
