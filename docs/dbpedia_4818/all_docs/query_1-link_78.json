She currently holds a dual position as Senior Behavioural Scientist with the Corona Behavioural Unit of the National institute for Public Health and the Environment of the Netherlands.\n\nJet focuses on making behavioural science more inclusive, generalisable and replicable. She does this by advancing aspects of heterogeneous practice. This may include answering questions like: Who are todayâs behavioural scientists? Do they have the theoretical and methodological understanding as intended? And what is needed to bridge possible gaps? How can behavioural science be embedded structurally in the policy making process? Which trade-off of methods is reliable yet efficient in real-world decision contexts? And how can scientific integrity be preserved in a fast-paced decision process? How can the reproducibility of behavioural findings be advanced? Most of this research is conducted in the context of preventative healthcare: reducing lifestyle disease, the spread infectious disease, air pollution or antimicrobial resistance. One key solution that Jet focuses on results from temporal fluctuations in decision making and behaviour. Her research shows that the weekly cycle influences our risk-taking behaviour, with serious consequences for health care, crime, economic and political settings. In her research, Jet maps these consequences and looks to see how we can use this knowledge to make changes to the decision context.\n\nPreviously, Jet also researched faces. Her PhD focused on understanding embodied cognition, first impressions and attribution errors using hyper-realistic face masks, and the dangers of hyper-realistic masks in international security.\n\nIlka Gleibs is an academic based in London.

Her research aims to improve access to care and support for young people with mental illness and to reduce the stigma associated with these conditions to positively impact their long-term mental health and socio-economic outcomes.\n\nHer current research address this issue in a variety of ways. She uses longitudinal data to estimate the social and economic consequences of mental health problems over the life course. These findings can help identify key time points for intervention and investment. She uses this evidence to inform how public policy can be better shaped to address the many personal, social and economic challenges posed by mental illnesses, across the life-course and throughout a range of contexts and high-, medium- and low-income settings. Sara also develops and evaluates interventions to improve access to care and support. She is interested in leading new and diverse ways to deliver and implement tailored evidence-based interventions which improve the mental health of low-income youth and to disrupt the dynamic between mental health and poverty which generates and reproduces inequalities over the lifespan.\n\nThe issue of translating research findings so that the evidence produced is useful to governments, practitioners, people with mental health conditions and their families is of great importance. Sara works together closely with relevant stakeholders throughout her research to promote knowledge exchange and to consider potential facilitators and barriers to implementation. The findings from her work have made impacts from the individual and local to the global level. At the global level, she has advised on national and state mental health plans and her work has been cited in key government reports in Brazil, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Mexico and the UK and by international organizations such as the World Health Organization.
