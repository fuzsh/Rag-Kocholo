        "text": "THE PROTESTS AT THE LEXINGTON CENTER, WHICH includes New York's oldest Deaf school, are an important stage in the Deaf struggle for civil rights, and on April 25, the first day of student demonstrations, I ask an African-American from the 11th grade whether she has also demonstrated for race rights. \"I'm too busy being Deaf right now,\" she signs. \"My two older brothers aren't Deaf, so they're taking care of being black. Maybe if I have time I'll get to that later.\"\n\nA Deaf woman standing nearby throws in a question for my benefit: \"If you could change being Deaf or being black, which would you do?\" The student looks confused, and is suddenly shy. Her signing gets smaller, as though she doesn't want everyone to see it. \"Both are hard,\" she signs back.\n\nAnother student intercedes. \"I am black and Deaf and proud and I don't want to be white or hearing or different in any way from who I am.\" Her signs are pretty big and clear. The first student repeats the sign \"proud\" -- her thumb, pointing in, rises up her chest -- and then suddenly they are overcome with giggles and go back to join the picket line.\n\nThis principle is still new to me, but it has been brewing in the Deaf community for some time: while some deaf people feel cut off from the hearing world, or disabled, for others, being Deaf is a culture and a source of pride. (\"Deaf\" denotes culture, as distinct from \"deaf,\" which is used to describe a pathology.) A steadily increasing number of deaf people have said that they would not choose to be hearing. To them, the word \"cure\" -- indeed the whole notion of deafness as pathology -- is anathema.\n\nMy guide here is Jackie Roth, one of the protest's organizers -- a Lexington alumna, an actress and an advocate with a practice in cross-cultural sensitivity training for hearing people. Charismatic, self-assured and sharp, she has excellent oral skills and lip-reads well. She speaks and signs simultaneously, which has made her a natural for communicating with the hearing world, and, therefore, an object of suspicion among the Deaf (a position made more difficult by the fact that she has, like many influential Deaf leaders, a hearing spouse). She is unyieldingly ambitious.\n\n\"I'm Deaf of Deaf,\" she says. \"I've always said that I'd get to the top and open as many doors as I could for the whole Deaf community. Every deaf child should know he can do anything except hear.\" Since 90 percent of deaf children are born to hearing parents, Deaf of Deaf carries a certain exclusivity and prestige: Deaf of Deaf have usually grown up understanding from an early age the issues that other deaf people may not take on until much later in life. \"My father was a dreamer. If he hadn't been deaf, he would have done big things. His family was so ashamed of his being deaf. My mom was a pragmatist, but my father used to say I could do anything. If I said I wanted to be a singer, he never said, 'Deaf girls can't.' He just told me to sing.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
