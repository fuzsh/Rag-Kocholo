Price discovery at IPO and post-IPO performance will influence investors experience in the short- and mid-term; Interesting to see that each regional IPO market comes with its own nuances. For IPO bound private companies good preparation is key serving the art of valuation from analysts: selecting best fit peers, developing a solid post-money business plan and a reliable forecasting guidance. In the long haul, meeting expectations and fulfilling on promises set in the placement phase will build investor confidence, leading to low cost of capital.

It is natural that after a significant period of challenging market conditions, it provides strategic acquisition opportunities for organizations looking to grow within a subdued market. Are we about to see the M&A and Private Equity markets spring to life outside the consulting space and drive activity for the consulting sector itself? #mergersandacquisitions #consulting #growth\n\nJohn Tetnowski, a VP on our M&A team, on the highlights of his work—helping companies define who they are going to be while keeping a global focus… After starting his career in international development, advising development organizations on creating programs that could support emerging economies, AlixPartners Vice President John Tetnowski transitioned into M&A consulting to be in the room where the most meaningful decisions for a company’s future were being made. Where the impact of his work was more tangible. Given the increasingly cross-border nature of M&A, John has continued to work with a global focus—earning his MBA from INSEAD and working on deals across four continents. Geopolitical challenges and changes to the global supply chain have impacted how global companies operate and find value. And the stakes are high. Most M&A deals would sit on the top of any company’s agenda in a given year, providing John with those opportunities to leverage his international experiences to help clients optimize their global operations, through acquisition or divestiture. “M&A is where companies are making decisions that shape the future of who they are going be, and I wanted be able to help shape that vision,” John said. “The speed that AlixPartners can deliver insights and results that go beyond what’s in the numbers and really understand the drivers of the business is what differentiates our firm. The opportunity to learn from and work alongside our team of dedicated M&A operators has been a highlight of my time at AlixPartners.” #lifeatalixpartners #mergersandacquisitions #consultingjobs\n\nHOW FAR KPMG HAS COME! The evolution of KPMG is truly a blueprint for emerging Businesses! Think of the \"Big Four\" Accounting Firms & KPMG appears on the list. It traces its roots back to 1897 when the accounting firm Klynveld Kraayenhof & Co. was founded in Amsterdam. Over the decades, through strategic mergers and visionary leadership, it evolved into the global powerhouse it is today with several wings across the globe changing lives in the field of consulting. In 1917, Piet Klynveld's firm merged with Kraayenhof's, setting the foundation for future expansions. Fast forward to 1979, when Klynveld Main Goerdeler (KMG) was formed through a merger of firms from the Netherlands, Germany, the UK, and the US. The final piece of the puzzle came in 1987 when KMG merged with Peat Marwick International, giving birth to KPMG. KPMG's journey offers key lessons for emerging businesses: Adaptability is Key: KPMG’s ability to adapt through mergers and acquisitions highlights the importance of flexibility. Businesses must be open to change and ready to seize opportunities for growth. Global Vision: Expanding horizons beyond local markets can drive growth. KPMG’s international mergers underscore the value of thinking globally while acting locally. Innovation through Collaboration: Mergers brought diverse expertise to KPMG, fostering innovation. Collaborating with other businesses can unlock new potentials and drive progress. Resilience in the Face of Challenges: KPMG faced numerous challenges, including market shifts and economic downturns. Their resilience demonstrates the importance of staying focused and committed during tough times. Leadership and Vision: Visionary leaders like Piet Klynveld played a crucial role in shaping KPMG's future. Strong leadership is vital for navigating the complexities of growth and change. #BusinessGrowth #Leadership #GlobalVision #Innovation #Resilience #KPMGStory"
