        "text": "Binnorie, or, The Cruel Sister- (Northum) 1882 Stokoe\n\n[No informant is named. From the \"Northumbrian Minstrelsy\" edited by John Collingwood Bruce, John Stokoe, 1882. Their notes follow. Clearly from the same tradition of Child C, a recreation by Scott published in 1802.\n\nR. Matteson 2018]\n\nThe popularity of this ballad in England extends over more than a couple of centuries. Mr. Rimbault printed a version from a broadside, dated 1656. It also appeared in Wit Restored, 1658. Sir Walter Scott, Jameson, Buchan, and other Scottish collectors have also published it, with slight variations. Professor Child, of Boston, U.S.A., states that the same story is found in Icelandic, Norse, Faroish, and Estnish ballads, as well as in Swedish and Danish, and a nearly related one in many other ballads and tales– German, Polish, Lithuanian, &c. The tune is a true Northumbrian melody, never before published ; it differs from the Scottish tune, which is of modern date.\n\nThere were twa sisters sat in a bow'r,\n\nBinnorie, O Binnorie;\n\nThere cam a knight to be their wooer,\n\nBy the bonny mill-dams of Binnorie.\n\nHe courted the eldest wi' glove and ring,\n\nBinmorie, &c.\n\nBut he lo'ed the youngest aboon a thing.\n\nBy the bonny, doc.\n\nHe courted the eldest wi' broach and knife,\n\nBut he lo'ed the youngest aboon his life.\n\nThe eldest she was vexed sair,\n\nAnd sore envied her sister fair.\n\nThe eldest said to the youngest ane :\n\n“Will you go and see our father's ships come in.”\n\nShe's ta'en her by the lily hand,\n\nAnd led her down to the river strand.\n\nThe youngest stude upon a stane,\n\nThe eldest cam' and pushed her in.\n\nShe took her by the middle sma',\n\nAnd dashed her bonny back to the jaw.\n\n“O sister, sister, reach your hand,\n\nAnd ye shall be heir of half my land.”\n\n“O sister, I’ll not reach my hand,\n\nAnd I’ll be heir of all your land.\n\n“Shame fa’ the hand that I should take,\n\nIt's twined me, and my world's make.”\n\n“O sister, reach me but your glove,\n\nAnd sweet William shall be your love.”\n\n“Sink on, nor hope for hand or glove,\n\nAnd sweet William shall better be my love.\n\n“Your cherry cheeks and your yellow hair\n\nGarr'd me gang maiden ever mair.”\n\nSometimes she sunk, sometimes she swam,\n\nUntil she cam to the miller's dam.\n\nThe miller's daughter was baking bread,\n\nAnd gaed for water as she had need.\n\n“() father, father, draw your dam\n\nThere's either a mermaid or a milk-white swan.”\n\nThe miller hasted and drew his dam,\n\nAnd there he found a drown'd woman.\n\nYe couldna see her yellow hair\n\nFor gowd and pearls that were sae rare.\n\nYe couldna see her middle sma',\n\nHer gowden girdle was sae braw.\n\nYe couldna see her lily feet,\n\nHer gowden fringes were sae deep.\n\nA famous harper passing by,\n\nThe sweet pale face he chanced to spy;\n\nAnd when he looked that lady on,\n\nHe sighed and made a heavy moan.\n\n“Sair will they be, whate'er they be,\n\nThe hearts that live to weep for thee.”\n\nHe made a harp o' her breast bone,\n\nWhose sounds would melt a heart of stone;\n\nThe strings he framed of her yellow hair\n\nTheir notes made sad the listening ear.\n\nHe brought it to her father's ha',\n\nThere was the court assembled a'.\n\nHe laid the harp upon a stane,\n\nAnd straight it began to play alane—\n\n“O yonder sits my father, the king,\n\nAnd yonder sits my mother, the queen;\n\n“And yonder stands my brother Hugh,\n\nAnd by him my William, sweet and true.”\n\nBut the last tune that the harp played then\n\nWas—“Woe to my sister, false Helen!\""
