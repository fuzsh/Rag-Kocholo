        "text": "Dr Edgar Whitley is a Professor of Information Systems at The London School of Economics and Political ScienceÂ (LSE), the co-editor of Information Technology and People, and Senior Editor for the Journal of Information Technology and the AIS Transactions of Replication Research.\n\nEdgar's expertise lies in digital identity and privacy and data governance. He is a senior voice on the legal and ethical side of data governance and the regulation of data, having served as research co-chair for the European Conference on Information Systems in 1993, 2009 and 2021, and track co-chair for the International Conference on Information Systems in 2003 and 2011. He is currently co-chair of the Privacy and Consumer Advisory Group (PCAG) to the Government Digital Service and GOV.UK, a member of the Cabinet Office Digital Economy Act 2017 Debt and Fraud Information Sharing Review Board, the Cabinet Office Digital Economy Act 2017 Public Service Delivery Review Board, and the DCMS National Data Strategy Forum. He is also a member of the Scottish Government Digital Identity Scotland Expert Group and the Open Banking Expert Group.\n\nFurther, Edgar has advised governments in Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, India, Jamaica, Japan and Mexico about the political, technological and social challenges of effective identity policies. He has contributed to reports for the World Bank, Omidyar Network and Centre for Global Development.\n\nEdgar was the research coordinator of the influential LSE Identity Project on the UKâs proposals to introduce biometric identity cards; proposals that were scrapped following the 2010 General Election.\n\nHis book with Gus Hosein, Global Challenges for Identity Policies, was published by Palgrave in 2010 and has provided the academic grounding for subsequent research on digital identity systems around the world. Â\n\nChris Anderson is the Ralf Dahrendorf Professor of European Politics and Society.\n\nA student of political behaviour, Andersonâs research has centred on the micro-foundations of markets and democracy. Past research projects have investigated the popularity of governments, the dynamics of public opinion about European integration, and peopleâs satisfaction with democracy. In other streams of research, he has investigated the connection between welfare states and citizen behaviour and the political attitudes and behaviours of immigrants in Europe.\n\nAnderson is the recipient of several scientific prizes, including the American Political Science Associationâs Heinz Eulau Award for the best article published in the American Political Science Review and the Best Article Award from the Journal of Politics. He also has served as President of the American Political Science Associationâs Sections on European Politics & Society and Elections, Public Opinion, and Voting Behavior, and on the editorial boards of a number of leading academic journals.\n\nAnderson also has an interest in the political economy of sports. His book on football analytics, co-authored with David Sally, is titled The Numbers Game: Why Everything You Know About Football Is Wrong (Penguin) and combines social scientific insights with football data to understand player and team performance. He has extensive experience in the football industry and is a regular speaker at analytics and sports industry events, including the prestigious Sports Analytics Conference held annually in Boston by MITâs Sloan School of Management.\n\nPreviously, Anderson held permanent or visiting appointments at Rice University, Northwestern University, the State University of New York, Syracuse University, the University of Oxford, Cornell University, and the University of Warwick.

Her research aims to improve access to care and support for young people with mental illness and to reduce the stigma associated with these conditions to positively impact their long-term mental health and socio-economic outcomes.\n\nHer current research address this issue in a variety of ways. She uses longitudinal data to estimate the social and economic consequences of mental health problems over the life course. These findings can help identify key time points for intervention and investment. She uses this evidence to inform how public policy can be better shaped to address the many personal, social and economic challenges posed by mental illnesses, across the life-course and throughout a range of contexts and high-, medium- and low-income settings. Sara also develops and evaluates interventions to improve access to care and support. She is interested in leading new and diverse ways to deliver and implement tailored evidence-based interventions which improve the mental health of low-income youth and to disrupt the dynamic between mental health and poverty which generates and reproduces inequalities over the lifespan.\n\nThe issue of translating research findings so that the evidence produced is useful to governments, practitioners, people with mental health conditions and their families is of great importance. Sara works together closely with relevant stakeholders throughout her research to promote knowledge exchange and to consider potential facilitators and barriers to implementation. The findings from her work have made impacts from the individual and local to the global level.
