        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nEDITORIAL Publication In this, the sixty-third issue of this journal, I would like to exercise an editor's prerogative and discuss at greater than usual length two subjects that affect the journal and its regular appearance. The latter is a practical matter; publication of Sign LanguageStudies is unusual in some respects. The other matter is philosophical, what the journal and its editor stand for and why. As a few readers know, SLS began when I accepted the invitation of Professor Thomas A. Sebeok to edit an international journal on sign languages. Noted for his publications in the broad field of semiotics, Sebeok was and is the driving force behind a number of journals, and his office at Indiana University is the center for their dissemination. Even as the details of launching the new journal were being worked on, the Dutch publishing firm of Mouton agreed with him to publish journals emanating from his headquarters, then known as the Center for Studies in the Language Sciences. The first five issues of SLS, at that time a semiannual , were consequently edited by me in Silver Spring, Maryland, composed by electronic typesetting equipment in Bloomington, Indiana, printed and bound in Ann Arbor, Michigan, shipped to Mouton in The Hague, and from there sent to subscribers around the world. That long, looping string snapped when Mouton, in financial difficulties, sold its list of medical books to a German firm and ceased its publication of language journals. Although without a publisher, I was reluctant to let the journal I had begun to edit perish. An earlier venture, private publication of LanguageOrigins,had not turned out badly, and so I ventured to publish Sign LanguageStudies in the same way. It seemed to me, however, that the norm for the kind of journal I wanted this one to be was quarterly publication. The change in publisher allowed a change in frequency of publication. With the advice of a former teacher in my ears (\"If you're going to make a mistake, don't pussyfoot @1989, Linstok Press, Inc. See note inside front cover ISSN 0302-1475 181 WCS around, make a good one.\") I decided to bring it out four times a year. I am still awed by the temerity of that decision, especially at the completion of one issue when the backlog of worthy manuscripts seems too meagre. There is no need to chronicle here the struggle to restore circulation lost when Mouton suspended operations. I was annoyed at first when no answers came to my repeated requests to the publisher for a list of subscribers of record when they closed the journal down. Three years later when I visited a huge block of offices in The Hague, tenanted, it seemed, by only one or two lonely people, I received a thick packet of letters (from subscribers and agencies), my own among them. I realized then that in all likelihood for two or three years there had been no one in the place even to open correspondence. Despite an erroneous notice in a journal index, that the publication ofSLS had ceased, old subscribers found out somehow that the journal's obituary was premature, and new subscribers providentially turned up. Meanwhile my private proprietorship had absorbed so much of my leisure time and my wife's skills as a financial secretary and maid of all work that she wisely suggested a more formal arrangement. I discussed various alternatives with her and with colleagues: the journal might become the organ of an association of dues-paying members; a publishing firm specializing in journals might be interested in taking it over; an academic sponsor might be found; or Gallaudet College itself might become the publisher. Opting for none of the above, my wife and I incorporated Linstok Press at the end of March 1977 and began our first corporate fiscal year that April with her as our only paid part-time employee. We, President and Manager, husband and wife, joint stockholders of the close corporation Linstok Press, did negotiate in 1979 with one large-scale journal publisher. We found the terms offered us no great advantage and would severely limit our options. Subscribers at that time, had they..."
