        "text": "Newcastle United Matches from 1892 to the present day.\n\nOverview of every competitive game Newcastle have played since their inception in 1892 - and some from before that too. The list is fully searchable, sortable and filterable, containing all the 'at a glance' data you need, such as date, venue, goals scored, goals conceded, opposition, competition, and any other data too.\n\nEach entry links to the full and complete record for the game.\n\ntoon1892.com was created out of my passion for Newcastle United Football Club and it's history. I created the website purely for my own use on my home computer. However, I was persuaded to 'publish' it online and make it available to all. In doing so I wanted to avoid annoying and/or intrusive advertising wherever possible, yet still keep it free at the point of use and ultimately keeping it as a 'not for profit' exercise.\n\nUnfortunately, as you may well imagine, maintaining a site without funding, or any revenue stream at all, is very difficult. Thus, an idea of authoring books and making Newcastle United related products was embarked upon, this in an attempt to alliviate my expenditure. Whilst I appreciate not everyone wants, nor can afford, such items, it would be certainly helpful if you could find a way to make a purchase, perhaps as a gift for a loved one.\n\nShould this not be an option for you then please still enjoy the site. You can also help by sending me comments - either on the site in general, or on any specific players, managers, games that you can. You can also support me by sharing the site with all your friends and family.\n\nI look forward to receiving your support, in any way you can provide it."
