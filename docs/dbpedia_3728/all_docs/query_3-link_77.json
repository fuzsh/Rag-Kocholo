        "text": "A look back at the highly controversial documentary about the life and work of German film director Leni Riefenstahl, considered to this day to be the greatest female film director ever.\n\nAre all Germans required to feel guilt and shame about World War 2? Or is it human nature to resent and find fault with success? Enough time has gone by to take a fresh examination of this excellent but flawed documentary, and to introduce it to those who have never seen it.\n\nHaving spent the better part of my adult life working on issues such as the fall of the Soviet Union, the Cold War, and the reunification of East and West Germany, I have been asked many times to opine on Germany in general, and Germans in particular. To do so would make me as good or evil as any group I am asked about. How do you say all Germans are the same? Are all Jews the same? And depending on your point of view or your agenda this sameness is either good or evil. Are their degrees of good and evil where they exceed acceptability? Or inversely when the goodness of a group exceeds what is the norm, can't that be suspicious? It's more complicated than that, and there were Germans born into a time of great upheaval alongside Nazis who perpetrated great crimes alongside that smallest group at the top; perhaps the most ignorant and thoughtless, but who see themselves as visionaries nonetheless who perpetrated crimes so atrocious, that their leadership rises to the highest level of evil imaginable. I believe this is the same for all groups, try to get a group of people to agree on anything and you will see that the absence of that third and highest group, those with horrific agendas we cannot understand in a civilized society, allows us to thoughtfully debate our actions and their consequences. This small but most evil dynamic in any group, once it infiltrates, can result in evil that is irredeemable. So Adolph Hitler is something more than a \"Shanda\" and Bernie Madoff is something less than a maniacal mass murderer guided by principles so esoteric we cannot begin to understand.\n\nMadoff is a witness to the time he was born into, but making the best of it with his wits and intellect didn't seem to be enough. Money so often ruins good people, and that which can be bought became more important than finding and exercising creative passion. Madoff used his genius to take the easy way to achieve his goals. Many of us are guilty of this to some degree, but he represented the hopes and aspirations of a group of people, his investors, as did Hitler, and failed just as Hitler did. I would never have put Hitler and Madoff in the same sentence unless it was a real intellectual exercise I had with a Rabbi who was teaching classes on the History of American Judaism which I attended. The question is, \"what made Madoff, as talented as he was, do wrong but not feel that he had to punish the World, kill people en masse, and take everyone down with him? Why did Hitler, who without a doubt was talented and as persuasive as anyone could be, take the irredeemable way out? I am sorry Bernie Madoff ruined his life and the life of his family, but he had that little part of him that was founded on belief that caused him to say \"enough\" and maintain some dignity. Is it possible Hitler had no belief system grounded in religion or Western tradition, and when he failed it was in the most horrible way imaginable.\n\nIn both cases there were innocent victims, guilty by association, who were also scammed and had no part in a crime except to try to find creative intellectual expression in their work but just happened to be born at the wrong time in the wrong place? When do we, the interested parties who seem to love reading about these atrocities stop judging and understand that it was not our day to be a victim. In the end what I learned from Madoff is that the system is rigged, everywhere, and money is artificial and represents nothing except a way to keep score. What did I learn from Hitler? That possibly a childhood with nothing, lacking love and some belief system, possibly associated with extreme mental illnesses we choose not to take into consideration when we judge, can produce evil incarnate. So there is no comparison between Madoff and Hitler. Nor should there be judgement of those who witnessed their crimes and were fooled the same as every one of the innocent victims in these stories. If you work on Wall Street, you are not inherently bad. If you were born a German and lived through the war you were in an unfortunate time and place.\n\nAs much as I like this documentary, and as much as I believe Leni Riefenstahl to be a gifted woman and a genius, it's the premise of the documentary I do not like or buy into. It puts Germans on the defensive right from the title. It is the best and only record of her accomplishments. I truly believe she was the greatest female film director ever, and I will add a link to the internet archive where you can watch it for free. https://archive.org/details/TheWonderfulHorribleLifeOfLeniRiefenstahl\n\nRiefenstahl is a witness to the time she was born into, and she made the best of it as most of us try to do. I believe Riefenstahl is a genius of staggering proportions who took no short cuts in her need to create. She didn't seem to think much about wealth. In the early 1990's I was invited to sit and have lunch with her in a non-official capacity at her home in Pocking, Germany. Pocking is where she passed away on September 8, 2003 at the age of 101.\n\nI have transcribed the ending of the documentary below, when the film maker is interviewing her, to show how anyone can be manipulated or made to feel defensive if you set that tone. For brevity I have used IN for interviewer and LR for Leni Riefenstahl.\n\nIN: I feel this country is still waiting for you to say publicly, \"I made a mistake, I'm sorry\".\n\nLR: Being sorry isn't nearly enough but I can't tear myself apart, destroy myself. It's so terrible. I've suffered anyway for over a half century, and it will never end until I die. It's such an incredible burden, that to say sorry...It's inadequate, it expresses too little.\n\nIN: Doesn't it hurt to read again and again that you're irredeemable?\n\nLR: Of course it hurts, it makes me very, very sad; But because it never stops and people keep on saying it...I have to live with it. It casts such a shadow over my life...that death will be a blessed release.\n\nIN: I feel people are expecting an admission of guilt from you.\n\nLR: Well, what do you mean by that? What am I guilty of? I can, and do, regret making the film of the 1934 Party Congress...\"Triumph of the Will\". I regret...no, I can't regret that I was alive in that period. But no words of anti-semitism ever passed my lips, nor did I write any. I was never anti-semitic and I never joined the Nazi Party. So what am I guilty of? Tell me that. I didn't drop any Atom bombs. I didn't denounce anyone. So where does my guilt lie? (end of film, roll credits)"
