        "text": "Leni Riefenstahl, the German filmmaker whose daringly innovative documentaries about a Nazi rally in Nuremberg in 1934 and the Berlin Olympics of 1936 earned her both acclaim as a cinematic genius and contempt as a propagandist for Hitler, died Monday night at her home in PoÌˆcking, south of Munich. She was 101.\n\nAfter the defeat of Germany in 1945, she was pronounced a Nazi sympathizer by the Allies and never again found work as a movie director. But her revolutionary film techniques deeply influenced later generations of documentary makers and television commercial makers, keeping alive the debate over whether her talent could be separated from her prewar political views.\n\nFor many students of her life and legacy, Ms. Riefenstahl was both propagandist and genius. A popular dancer and actress before becoming a movie director in 1932, she enthusiastically put her talent at the service of the Nazis.\n\nYet, without her exceptional artistic vision, her two most famous documentaries, \"Triumph of the Will\" and the two-part \"Olympia,\" would neither have caused a sensation at the time nor be considered classics today.\n\nMs. Riefenstahl never denied her early conviction that Hitler could \"save\" Germany. She also said that her idealized image of him fell apart \"far too late,\" near the end of World War II. But, amid widespread skepticism, she insisted that she was never a Nazi and that \"Triumph of the Will\" and \"Olympia\" were apolitical, inspired only by her desire to create works of art.\n\nStill, while her documentaries continue to be studied in some film schools, Ms. Riefenstahl remained trapped in the shadow of her association with Hitler. Her repeated attempts to find financing for a new film always ended in failure, while public screenings of her movies and exhibitions of her photographs invariably prompted protests. As recently as last year, she was briefly investigated in Germany for purported race-hatred crimes.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
