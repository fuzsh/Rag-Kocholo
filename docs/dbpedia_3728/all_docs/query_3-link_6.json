        "text": "Ray Muller's \"Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl\" is a big, long (over three hours), sometimes clunky but consistently fascinating documentary portrait of the woman most easily identified as Hitler's favorite film maker, with good reason. Ms. Riefenstahl's two outstanding films, \"Triumph of the Will\" (1935) and \"Olympia\" (1938), for all of their esthetic glories, served the propaganda machine of National Socialism in ways that probably neither Hitler nor Ms. Riefenstahl could have foreseen.\n\nThe films gave Hitler a credibility at home and around the world that nothing else produced by a German artist in the 1930's ever achieved. It was Ms. Riefenstahl's fate not only to survive the war, but also to live on and on and on.\n\nToday, at 91, she is still answering the same questions about her relationship to Hitler and to the Nazi Party (she was never a member), and about her sense of responsibility for the crimes committed by the man in whom she continued to believe right through the end of the war. Her eyes were not opened, she says, until she learned of the death camps.\n\nFor nearly 50 years, she has been setting her record straight, often splitting hairs, a task sometimes made easier when she has been able to prove the accusations against her to be wrong, which serves to make those not so clearly off the mark seem fuzzier than they are. Thus for most of her adult life she has been on the defensive, not easy for a strong woman whose early years were so full of success and acclaim. The defensive position is exhausting, but Ms. Riefenstahl still hasn't knuckled under to accumulated fatigue. This film is the astonishing record of how she has survived."
