        "text": "Last month German film-maker Leni Riefenstahl turned 100. As the last surviving high-profile figure who had been intimately associated with the Third Reich, Riefenstahl remains an eternally compromised figure, as much despised for her unapologetic attitude to her own dubious past as admired for her pioneering brilliance with a movie camera. These days her best-known work - the staged documentary Triumph of the Will (1934) and the two-part Olympia, made at the 1936 Olympics - automatically brings with it debates about aesthetics and morality (\"Can art be detached from its context?\"). Her new film - her first since borrowing 100 Gypsies from an Austrian holding camp in 1941 to act as extras in her Gypsy melodrama Tiefland (Lowlands) - unsurprisingly steers well clear of any controversial material: Underwater Impressions is a 45-minute documentary examining life on the seabed, with a score by Giorgio Moroder. It premiered on German TV on August 15.\n\nArguments over Riefenstahl are still intense. Her defenders call accusations of her Nazi associations innuendo, and point to the fact that she never joined the Nazi Party and was constantly at odds with the Third Reich's minister of propaganda, Joseph Goebbels. Her attackers, on the other hand, enumerate a list of failings: her near-idolatrous relationship with Adolf Hitler, which predated his rise to power in 1933, her virtual control over the staging of the huge 1934 rally in Nuremberg, which became Triumph of the Will, and Tiefland (filmed in 1941 but not released until 1954), over which Riefenstahl is still locked in litigation with a pro-Gypsy group.\n\nIn the mid-1980s she was successful in forcing a German film-maker, Nina Gladitz, to remove an allegation in a 1982 documentary, Time of Darkness and Silence, that she knew her extras would face death in concentration camps after filming finished. A recent counter-action has forced her to stop saying she didn't know.\n\nRiefenstahl's rehabilitation began in earnest in the early 1990s with Ray Muller's documentary The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, which made the world aware of her postwar activities: she left Europe and travelled in Africa, living with the Nuba people and taking photographs of them, and then turned to scuba-diving in her 70s.\n\nLike her inclusion of Jesse Owens's feats in Olympia, Riefenstahl's Nuba fixation is often taken as evidence of her disaffection with Nazi politics. But it's also clear that this kind of ethnography and nature worship is thoroughly of a piece with her earlier work. She made her way as an actress and dancer in nature-worship mountain movies; and her directorial debut, The Blue Light, is clearly a fable about Germany's desire for national renewal through the invocation of mystical Teutonic spiritualism.\n\nThese ideas were part of the common aesthetic currency of the era - an era that could venerate equally Sir James Frazer's synthesis of multi-ethnic mythology, The Golden Bough, and the body-fetish ballet of Isadora Duncan, both of which, you feel, were strong influences on Riefenstahl's early oeuvre.\n\nRiefenstahl published her biography in the same year, 1993, as Muller's film. More recently, books of her photography have been published, as well as Taschen's career summary, Five Lives; but a mooted biopic starring Jodie Foster has just stalled, reportedly over Foster's reluctance to follow Riefenstahl's version of events.\n\nIn the end, Riefenstahl's protestations of ignorance about Nazi aims and ideology wear thin: anti-Semitism was the central plank of Nazi policy right from the party's inception. Her first effort for Hitler, Der Sieg des Glaubens (The Victory of Faith), a film of the 1933 party conference, was a dry run for the enormous-scale Triumph of the Will. No-one could claim that she went into Triumph, and the rest of her Nazi films, with her eyes closed.\n\nLeni Riefenstahl on meeting Hitler: \"I first saw Adolf Hitler in May 1932, at the Berliner Sportpalast. By the way, this was the first political meeting I had ever attended. I was amazed to see what a tremendous power he held over his listeners. Just like a hypnotist, Hitler was able to cast a spell over the audience and make them do exactly what he wanted. It was very scary, and the sparks flew to me too. Yet it was not alone his electrifying presence but a very rare, trance-like speaker-audience relationship. Just like everybody else, my emotions were touched in a very strange way - so strange that I didn't give a thought about what he was really talking about. I asked myself: Who is this person? What is he like? I was curious to know more about him and quite naturally wanted to meet him.\n\n\"With great naivety, I sent him a letter, addressed to the Braune Haus [Hitler's HQ] in Munich, asking for an interview. I wanted to make a picture of what is power, what is theatre and what is reality. I never thought I would be honoured by an answer, but to my surprise it came back very fast. My letter arrived a few days after Hitler remarked to his adjutant that my dance by the sea in Der Heilige Berg (The Holy Mountain) was one of 'the most beautiful performances I have ever seen'. I can only guess that my last film, Das Blaue Licht (The Blue Light), must have impressed him. To my great surprise, he suggested that I should make a film for him. I was shocked and answered, 'No, mein Fuhrer, I cannot do it, I can only do what comes from inside me, what I really desire. I don't do commission films'. He was disappointed and said that when I was a little older and more mature, I would understand better what he had in mind.\"\n\nOn the making of Olympia: \"Hitler was completely disinterested in both the games and my film, and came only when he understood that he had to. Goebbels, however, was always meddling. At one point, he wanted to cut Jesse Owens and [fellow black American athlete] Archie Williams completely out of the film.\"\n\nHer relations with Hollywood and mainstream cinema: \"During my trip to America in 1938, only Walt Disney would have anything to do with me in Hollywood. Only he and the director King Vidor received me. Disney took the entire day and showed me around his studios. He explained his animation technique to me and screened his latest projects. When we parted, we both expressed the wish to work together one day.\n\n\"In 1982, I was in close contact with Rainer Werner Fassbinder, who was filming Querelle. We wanted to work together, but unfortunately, he died while I was diving and filming in Papua New Guinea.\n\nOn the Nuba: \"For me, the Nuba are the symbol of man's living in harmony with nature. Today, they are still fighting for their survival. I have often tried to help, sinking water wells and obtaining medical supplies. In 1963, when Martin Luther King delivered his 'I have a dream' speech, I was living among the Nuba in the small mountain village of Tadoro. His speech was a milestone in the fight for the equality of all peoples. But sadly, King's words never reached Africa. Yet there may be a ray of hope - a ceasefire is in place in the Nuba mountains. And recently, both sides in the Sudanese conflict agreed to hold a referendum.\"\n\nOn her new film: \"Impressionen unter Wasser certainly isn't a 'comeback'. I was always active and continue to be so. My film shows the beauty of the underwater world. I hope it will touch the viewer's conscience as it illustrates just what the world will lose when nothing is done to stop the destruction of our oceans. I once said that I am fascinated by the beautiful and the living. I seek harmony and, under water, I have found it.\"\n\nThe Guardian"
