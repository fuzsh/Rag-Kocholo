        "text": "rockermike\n\nMountain climber\n\nTopic Author's Original Post - Dec 3, 2008 - 02:11am PT\n\nJust watched a movie about Leni; \"The Wonderful, Horrible life of Leni Riefenstahl\" (1993). Interesting stuff and (dare I use the word) amazing women.\n\nOf course much controversy surrounds her Triumph of the Will film (widely recognized as one of the best films of the 20th century - if not for the subject matter) and whether she was really a Nazi sympathizer - (she says she was just a technician doing her job)??\n\nBut I didn't know she was quite the climber way before the Nazi thing even started. Filmed, edited and stared in her own films including The Blue Light where she was an anti social counter cultural waif in a village in the alps, running off in the moon light to climb big steep mountains looking for magical crystals (sounds like some climber girls of today - ha). Anyway, she did her own climbing (as in picture above) free solo and barefoot.\n\nAnyway, if you are into film check it out (if you can find it). I picked it up for a buck at the local video store which is selling off all the VHS stuff. Alan Rubin\n\nclimber\n\nAmherst,MA.\n\nDec 3, 2008 - 09:26am PT\n\nThere is a fair amount about her in Andrel Heckmair's (FA of the Eigerwand)autobiography (forgot the name--sorry),they climbed together at least one summer and he was very impressed. If I recall they had an epic in a storm on the Campanile Basso in the Brenta Dolomites. As for her Nazi sympathies, as the Heckmair book makes clear, she was definitely more than a mere technician and was in fact a part of Hitler's social circle, at least in the pre-war years. Alan Rubin\n\nclimber\n\nAmherst,MA.\n\nDec 3, 2008 - 10:46am PT\n\nIt was in My Life as A Mountaineer that Heckmair describes his climbs with Riefenstahl and subsequent trip with her to meet Hitler. My German is pretty limited so I haven't read (nor do I own) the last 3 problem book, so I don't know if there are references to her in that book as well. I'm at work (shame, shame!!!!)so don't have access to my library, and, anyway, I'm not tech-competent enough to scan the appropriate chapter into this thread, but maybe one of you folks can do that service...... paul roehl\n\nBoulder climber\n\ncalifornia\n\nDec 3, 2008 - 02:37pm PT\n\nThe fascinating thing about Leni Riefenstahl is that her work really defines the impossible collaboration of art and politics. Art in the service of political ideas will always be subordinated to the political; political issues will end up defining the aesthetic quality of the work, and some political art, as in the case of LR, will be seen by most as simply disgusting or at least frightening. James Joyce said it best when he declared any didactic (political) work as an example of improper art: art that doesnÂ’t have the aesthetic experience as its primary concern. Interesting that so much contemporary art is so politically charged, though now that charge comes from the left, and is, I think, destined for the same fate. rockermike\n\nMountain climber\n\nTopic Author's Reply - Dec 4, 2008 - 01:46am PT\n\nShe later, in her 60s, lived in east Africa for a year and came home with her Nuba photographs.\n\nAt least we can say she did have a good eye and an adventurous spirit.\n\nI don't mean to be her apologist but its worth remembering that the majority of the German population (except for the intellectual elites, the aristocratic blue bloods and the communists) were into what can be called early Nazism, with its ideals of self sacrifice for the collective and a higher good. As Heir Hitler said, you can't deny people meaning in their lives. And given the reality of Germany in the 1920's the attraction is understandable. I think there is something there even we modern westerners can learn vis-a-vis our \"each for themselves and one against all\" ideology.\n\nOf course what happened later is another story but I personally am not convinced that the first ideal necessarily leads to the second reality. Others will debate this.\n\nLeni's \"the body beautiful\" themes have been criticized by many as an essentially \"fascist aesthetic\" and I can partly see their point. Not a lot of sympathy for the weak or dumb or ugly in Nazi society, but these same critics might also consider climbing as a fascist pastime - the search for the sublime, the glorification of courage, self control, and physical perfection is a little anti-liberal, western, American (call it what you will) in itself. The classical American is watching football on the tube with a beer in one hand and a bag of chips between his legs. There is a curious tension between these two ideals to my mind."
