We will begin with a showing of Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950) which raises the problem of the relative, subjective, partial, and multi-faceted nature of truth and memory. The other films and readings have been chosen in order to illustrate a number of themes and problems in the often difficult relationship between film and history. I have selected a number of my favourite feature films and documentaries to show you - in other weeks, we will vote on what we will show (suggestions on what to see are welcome).\n\nThe seminar topics are:\n\n\"Reel History\" - An Introduction to the Study of Film and History\n\nThe Relative and Partial Nature of Truth and Memory - the \"Rashomon Effect\"\n\n\"Restaging the Past\" on Film: Peter Watkins and \"Documentary Reconstruction\"\n\nPropaganda Films as \"Mirrors of Contemporary Society\" - Leni Riefenstahl and Nazi Propaganda Films\n\nThe Historian as Advisor to Filmmakers - Natalie Zemon Davis\n\n\"Hollywood History\" - John Ford and the Myth of the West\n\nThe Filmmaker as Participant and Historian - Pierre Schoendoerffer and the French Indochinese War\n\nDepicting the Undepictable: The Holocaust on Film\n\nDocumentaries and History\n\nThe structure of the subject is:\n\na weekly seminar - Fridays 12.30-2.00 pm Napier 304\n\na weekly film - Fridays in Napier LG29 starting at 2.10 PM (and finishing whenever)\n\n2 oral seminar presentations - one on a documentary and one on a feature film\n\na short paper on the historiography and theory of film and history - 2,000 words worth 1/3\n\na research essay on a film or a director - 4,000 words worth 2/3\n\nAssessment\n\nThe Historiography/Theory Paper\n\nA package of photocopied articles and chapters from books on the historiography and theory of film and history will be distributed to members of the seminar at the start of the semester. In the light of these (and other readings listed in the Seminar Reading Guide) discuss Robert Rosenstone's remark (or what I have termed \"Rosenstone's Law\") that the process of transferring words on the page of a history book (or ideas about the past in the mind of the filmmaker) into flickering images on a screen changes \"history\" into something else, with reference to one or more films and/or filmmakers we will examine during the semester:\n\nNo matter how serious or honest the filmmakers, and no matter how deeply committed they are to rendering the subject faithfully, the history that finally appears on the screen can never fully satisfy the historian as historian (although it may satisfy the historian as filmgoer). Inevitably, something happens on the way from the page to the screen that changes the meaning of the past as it is understood by those of us who work in words.\" (Robert A. Rosenstone, \"History in Images/History in Words: Reflections on the Possibility of Really Putting History into Film,\" American Historical Review, December 1988, vol. 93, no. 5, pp. 1173-85. Quote on p. 1173.)\n\nThe Historiography/Theory Paper should be no more than 2,000 words in length and is due at the Seminar in Week 6 when it will be presented and discussed.\n\nThe Research Essay on Film and History\n\nThe Research Essay can be on any film or director of your choice (after consultation with me and preferrably on one or more of the films shown in the subject). The Research Essay should be between 4,000-5,000 words in length and is due at the Seminar in Week 12 when it will be presented and discussed.\n\nThere are two approaches you can take in formulating your topic. The first is to treat the film as a work of narrative or interpretative history (i.e. as a secondary source of history). The task is then to evaluate the film as a work of history:\n\nhow historically accurate is it (in comparison with what you know from other, printed sources)?\n\nwhat kind of history is depicted in the film?\n\nwhat written or other form of history was used as a source by the director (or screenwriter) in making the film?\n\nThe second approach you can take is to use the film as a \"primary source\", as a document which reveals something about the time and place in which it was created. Some issues to consider include:\n\nwhen, why, and by whom was the film made?\n\nwhat does the film tell us about the time and place in which it was made?\n\nhow did audiences react to the film when it was shown?\n\nif it is a propaganda film, what makes it propoganda and how successful was it as a propaganda film?\n\nSome of the Films we have shown in the past\n\nWesterns:\n\nSam Peckinpah, The Wild Bunch (1969) (Director's cut) 2hrs 25 (WS/DVD) on demythologising the Western\n\nJohn Ford, Fort Apache (1948) 2hrs 7 - See the handouts on the other 2 films in Ford's \"cavalry trilogy\" - \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" (1949) and \"Rio Grande\" (1950)\n\nHistory and \"Documentary Reconstruction\":\n\nPeter Watkins, Culloden (1969) 1hr 12 and extract from Paul Murton, Rebellion: Culloden (1996) 50mins\n\nDocumentaries:\n\nKen Burns, \"The Civil War\" 1863.

Inevitably, something happens on the way from the page to the screen that changes the meaning of the past as it is understood by those of us who work in words. (Robert A. Rosenstone, \"History in Images/History in Words: Reflections on the Possibility of Really Putting History into Film,\" American Historical Review, December 1988, vol. 93, no. 5, pp. 1173-85. Quote on p. 1173.)\n\nDiscuss Rosenstone's claim that the process of transferring words on the page of a history book (or memoir or historical novel) to flickering images on a screen changes \"history\" into \"something else\". Keep in mind the following questions:\n\nWhat is the process by which a memoir, novel, historical account, etc. gets made into a film?\n\nWhat demands must a filmmaker satisfy in making a film and how is this done (consider the roles of the studio, financial backer, the viewing public, screenplay writer, critics, actors, producers, director's personal vision)?\n\nWhat steps can a filmmaker take to ensure the \"historical accuracy\" of a film?\n\nDiscuss the role of a professional academic historian as \"historical advisor\" to a filmmaker (e.g. Rosenstone on \"Reds\", Zeman Davis with \"The Return of Martin Guerre\", Bill Gammage with \"Gallipoli\")\n\nWhat is the difference between history as words on a page and history as flickering image on a screen?\n\nROBERT ON FILM AND HISTORY\n\nRobert A.

It was 106 feet wide and 26 feet deep, and was topped with a ridge-pole; its stone wall rose 75 feet high. This gate was constructed in 789 when the then capital of Japan was transferred to Kyoto. With the decline of West Kyoto, the gate fell into bad repair, cracking and crumbling in many places, and became a hide-out for thieves and robbers and a place for abandoning unclaimed corpses.

Documentaries and History\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTo put the historical feature films we will be watching into some kind of perspective I thought we should view some \"historical documentaries\". Depending upon the interests of the seminar participants, the following are available:\n\nThe World at War (1973) - commemorating the 30th anniversay of WW2.\n\nFrontier (1997)\n\nKen Burns, The Civil War (1990)\n\nClaude Lanzmann, Shoah (1985)\n\nWalter Cronkite, The Vietnam War ()\n\nLawrence Pitkethly, American Cinema (1994).\n\nSELECTED READING\n\nOn Claude Lanzmann see the Reading on The Holocaust.\n\nThe companion book to The World at War (1973) TV series by Foster (?).\n\nHenry Reynolds, Frontier ().\n\nCD-ROM version of Frontier for schools.\n\nKen Burns's The Civil War: Historians Respond, ed.

Ward (with Ric and Ken Burns), The Civil War: An Illustrated History (New York: , 1990).\n\nCompanion book to TV series: John Belton, American Cinema/American Culture (New York: McGraw Hill, 1994).\n\nON DOCUMENTARIES AS HISTORY\n\nPaula Rabinowitz, \"Wreckage upon Wreckage: Hisotry, Documentary and the Ruins of Memory,\" History and Theory, 1992, 32 (2), pp. 119-37.\n\nBarabar Abrash and Daniel T. Walkowitz, \"Sub/versions of History: A Meditation on Film and Historical Narrative,\" History Workshop Journal, 1994, 38, pp. 203-14.\n\nThe Exam - A Selection of Past Exam Questions\n\n[Note: I asked the students to come up with their own exam questions which we discussed in the final seminar. Many of those questions made up the final exam.]\n\nDuration: Three (3) hours (plus 10 minutes reading time)\n\nGENERAL INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou have three (3) hours in which to answer three (3) questions:\n\nthe compulsory question from Section I\n\none (1) question from Section II on \"The Relationship Between Film and History\"\n\none (1) question from Section III on \"Specific Films, Directors, and Genres\"\n\nFor the compluslory question and the questions in Section II your answers should refer to at least two or three (2-3) films. You may attempt any question with the proviso that there be no substantial doubling up or duplication of your answers.\n\nI. THE COMPULSORY QUESTION\n\n(Everybody must answer this question)\n\nEvaluate the following claim made by the film critic and historian Dyson, in the light of at least two or three (2-3) films you have studied in this subject:\n\nAlthough art may occassionally dispense with \"fact\" (since, at its best, art reveals cultural biases that shape radically opposed interpretations of events), it has an obligation to tell, if not the truth, then its truth.\n\nOR\n\nMarshall Flaum in the \"Foreword\" to Nuclear War Films, ed. Jack G. Shaheen (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1979) states:\n\nFilms are mirrors of our lives and times. During the course of the century our changing society, our evolving attitudes and concerns - our history, in fact - have been reflected in our films. Perhaps less explicitly in features than in documentaries, but no less emphatically. Even the distortions and lies we often find in that celluloid mirror reveal some inescapable truths not only about those who created the falsity, but about those who demanded it and avidly paid for it at the box office. As such, the motion picture is fit study for the historian and the sociologist as much as it is for the film student.\n\nWhat do you think \"that celluloid mirror\" has to teach historians?\n\nOR,\n\nHow valid is Robert Rosenstone's remark that the process of transferring words on the page of a history book (or ideas about the past in the mind of the filmmaker) into flickering images on a screen changes \"history\" into something else,? Discuss with reference to one or more films and/or filmmakers we have examined during the semester:\n\nNo matter how serious or honest the filmmakers, and no matter how deeply committed they are to rendering the subject faithfully, the history that finally appears on the screen can never fully satisfy the historian as historian (although it may satisfy the historian as filmgoer). Inevitably, something happens on the way from the page to the screen that changes the meaning of the past as it is understood by those of us who work in words.\" (Robert A. Rosenstone, \"History in Images/History in Words: Reflections on the Possibility of Really Putting History into Film,\" American Historical Review, December 1988, vol. 93, no. 5, pp. 1173-85. Quote on p. 1173.)\n\nII. QUESTIONS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FILM AND HISTORY\n\n(Answer only ONE (1) question from this section)\n\n1. Marshall Flaum in the \"Foreword\" to Nuclear War Films, ed. Jack G. Shaheen (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1979) states:\n\nFilms are mirrors of our lives and times. During the course of the century our changing society, our evolving attitudes and concerns - our history, in fact - have been reflected in our films. Perhaps less explicitly in features than in documentaries, but no less emphatically. Even the distortions and lies we often find in that celluloid mirror reveal some inescapable truths not only about those who created the falsity, but about those who demanded it and avidly paid for it at the box office. As such, the motion picture is fit study for the historian and the sociologist as much as it is for the film student.\n\nWhat do you think \"that celluloid mirror\" has to teach historians?\n\n2. In the late 20th century, has film on the \"big screen\" replaced written history and oral tradition as the means of satisfying what Rosenstone has described as \"the need for that larger history, that web of connections to the past that holds a culture together, that tells us not only where we have been but also suggests where we are going.\" Discuss with reference to 2-3 films you have studied in this subject.\n\n3. Select 2-3 feature films or documentaries you have studied in the subject and compare and contrast the kinds of history \"told\" by traditional written texts and by visual media. In your answer you might reflect upon what type of history (if any) is better suited to each medium, and what, in your view, are the strengths and weaknesses of each way of telling historical stories?\n\n4. Discuss, with reference to at least two films, James Snead's claim that:\n\none may formulate the history of black film stereotypes as the history of the denial of history in an artificially constructed mythology about an unchanging black \"character\" or \"nature\".\n\n5. John Sayles observes that:\n\nI feel that history, especially the stories we like to believe or know about ourselves, is part of the ammunition we take with us into the everyday battle of how we define ourselves and how we act toward other people. (\"A Conversation between Eric Foner and John Sayles,\" Past Imperfect: History according to the Movies, ed. Mark C. Carnes (1995), p. 11).\n\nTo what extent is film ammunition in the battle for self-definition for individuals, classes, races, and nations?\n\n6. Discuss the claim that \"Too often historical films deal with national myth rather than with national history per se\".\n\n7. What part has war played in the history of cinema? What connection is there (if any) between sighting along the barrel of a gun and focussing a camera? (Virilio)\n\n8. Discuss the differences between historical \"accuracy\" and what Natalie Zemon Davis calls historical \"authenticity\" in film.\n\n9. Using Natalie Zemon Davis's guidelines drawn up for the American Historical Association on the duties and responsibilities of historians who act as historical advisors to filmmakers, what advice would you give a filmmaker who was planning to make an historical feature fillm? What pitfalls do you think need to be avoided? In what areas do special efforts need to be made in order to ensure historical accuracy or authenticity?\n\n10. In George MacDonald Fraser's The Hollywood History of the World (1996) he claims that\n\n(there is) a popular belief that where history is concerned, Hollywood always gets it wrong - and sometimes it does. What is overlooked is the astonishing amount of history it has got right and the immense, unacknowledged debt that we owe to the commercial cinema as an illuminator of the story of mankind.\n\nEvaluate the accuracy of \"Hollywood history\" with respect to the films of Walt Disney Pictures, or Oliver Stone, or Stephen Spielberg.\n\n11. What in your opinion is the relationship between the depiction of gender stereotypes (male or female) in film in the post-war period and the historical changes which were taking place in the family, the workplace, and in society at large at the same time? In your answer you should refer to at least 2 films you have studied this semester.\n\n12. Compare and contrast the kinds of history \"told\" by traditional written texts (monographs, articles) and by visual media (historical feature films, documentaries). What type of history (if any) is better suited to each medium? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each way of telling historical stories.\n\n13. How do or should filmmakers deal with the problem of depicting violence in historical films? How do they or should they balance the need for \"historical accuracy\" against the need not to offend the sensibilities of the audience or the broader community?\n\n14. Discuss the tension which exists for historical filmmakers between the necessity to satisfy \"the bottom line\" and the desire they might have to represent history as accurately as possible.\n\n15. Discuss in detail an example of a feature film which gets its history (basically) right and an example of a feature film which gets its history (horribly) wrong. What, in your opinion, makes the difference between the two films?\n\n16. Select a representative film from one of the following genres and discuss how history is (mis-)represented in it:\n\nwestern\n\nwar film\n\ncostume or historical drama\n\nspy film/thriller\n\nromance\n\nsci-fi\n\nchildren's animated feature\n\n17. Discuss the contribution one or more historians have made as advisors to filmmakers. Does their participation provide the film with any historical validy and, if so, how?\n\n18. What are the physical and moral limitations of historical features films? What apsects of history cannot be shown on the screen? What are the implications of these limitations on the usefulness of film as a way of depicting the past on the screen?\n\nIII. QUESTIONS ON SPECIFIC FILMS, DIRECTORS, AND GENRES\n\n(Answer only ONE (1) question from this section)\n\n1. What is the \"Rashomon Effect\" and what lesson or lessons can Kurosawa teach historians?\n\n2. With respect to at least one documentary you have seen in this subject discuss the ways documentary filmmakers attempt to \"restage the past\". What are the strengths and weaknesses of documentaries as a means of presenting history to an audience?\n\n3. Discuss the claim that \"Leni Riefenstahl's documentary Triumph of the Will (1935) is the best propaganda film ever made.\"\n\n4. What is \"the myth of the West\" and what roles did John Ford and/or John Wayne play in creating this myth?\n\n5. Discuss the claim that\n\nSchoendoerffer is a captive of his own past - a POW of his memory of his own military experience, if you will. Having lived through the Indochinese War he is destined to relive it again and again in his films.\n\n6. Assess the strengths and weaknesses of the film The Return of Martin Guerre vis-à-vis the book of the same name by Natalie Zemon Davis as works of history.\n\n7. Select a representative film from one of the following genres and discuss how history is (mis-)represented in it:\n\nwestern\n\nwar film\n\ncostume or historical drama\n\nspy film/thriller\n\nromance\n\nsci-fi\n\nblack cinema\n\n8. How does Sam Peckinpah attempt to demythologise the traditional Hollywood \"western\" in The Wild Bunch (1969)? In your view, how successful is he?\n\n9. With respect to Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (1951), what is the \"Rashomon Effect\" and what lesson or lessons can Kurosawa teach historians?\n\n10. Discuss the techniques Peter Watkins uses to \"restage the past\" in his film Culloden (1969). What are the strengths and weaknesses of this type of documentary filmmaking as a means of presenting history to an audience?\n\n11. Discuss the claim that \"Leni Riefenstahl's documentary Triumph of the Will (1935) is the best propaganda film ever made.\" (You might want to compare and contrast it with Olympia (1936) where this is appropriate).\n\n12. Assess the strengths and weaknesses of the film The Return of Martin Guerre (1982) vis-à-vis the book of the same name by Natalie Zemon Davis as works of history.\n\n13. Using John Ford's film Fort Apache (1948) as a starting point, what is \"the myth of the West\" and what roles did John Ford and/or John Wayne play in creating this myth?\n\n14. Discuss the claim that\n\nSchoendoerffer is a captive of his own past - a POW of his memory of his own military experience, if you will. Having lived through the Indochinese War he is destined to relive it again and again in his films.\n\nHow can a filmmaker who was also a participant in the events s/he depicts give an reliable account of what transpired?\n\n15. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of Andrzej Wajda's film Korczak (1990) in \"depicting the undepictable\" on film. (You might want to compare and contrast it with Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993)).\n\n16. Discuss Claude Lanzmann's documentary filmmaking technique in Shoah (1985). What are its strengths and weaknessess in analysing historical events? What kind of history has he created?\n\n17. Joan the military leader; Joan the naive and gullible young peasant girl; Joan the messenger of god - what image of Joan of Arc does Luc Besson give us in The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (1999) and is it historically accurate?\n\n18. Discuss how Margarethe von Trotta in her film Rosa Luxemberg (1986) grapples with the twin problems of making a \"bio-pic\" and a film about \"ideas\". How successfull is she in solving these problems?\n\n19. Is Leni Riefenstahl's Olympia (1936) a path-breaking and innovative sports documentary or just another Nazi propaganda film?\n\n20. To what extent is Walt Disney Pictures' Hercules (1997) a commendable effort in bringing ancient history to the attention of the film-going public or another \"historical travesty\" from this Hollywood studio? Discuss.\n\n21. Devise your own question on a specific film or director of your choice."
