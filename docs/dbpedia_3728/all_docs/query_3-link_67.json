        "text": "The last time I wrote about photographer and film director Leni Riefenstahl -- who died this week at the age of 101 -- I received a flurry of e-mails, the majority of which were cranky corrections of my misrepresentation of her film Reichsparteitag. I also received a hand-written letter from an elderly man, in beautiful cursive script, that began with the salvo: \"What's with all the Hitler bashing these days?\"\n\nThe letter proceeded to detail Hitler's great contributions to Germany, and, predictably, played down the Holocaust with the kind of specious reasoning that has allowed grievous imbeciles worldwide to continue to revise history toward the promulgation of still more vicious anti-Semitism, of more paranoid constructions about who, precisely, constitutes the root of any given idiot's kampf.\n\nI liked this letter, ultimately, because it best captured the essence of Riefenstahl, who was, essentially, history's most dangerous dumb blonde.\n\nIn an interview conducted fairly recently, Riefenstahl discussed her controversial Nazi documentaries, with knuckle-dragging defiance: \"I cannot apologize . . . for having made the film Triumph of the Will,\" she stated. \"It won the top prize.\"\n\nThis 1934 film, which documents Hitler's Nuremberg Rally, was highly praised in its time, by Hitler particularly, who commissioned Riefenstahl at her request. While the filmmaker always pleaded ignorance regarding Hitler's grotesque and fanatical prejudices, it was she who volunteered her services, after a 1932 rally. By 1932, Hitler's anti-Semitism was explicit, available, and, effectively, the basis of the National Socialist Party's program. Almost 10 years before Riefenstahl pledged her support to Hitler, he inquired, in his prison memoir: \"Was there any form of filth or profligacy, particularly in cultural life, without at least one Jew involved in it? If you cut even cautiously into such an abscess, you found, like a maggot in a rotting body, . . . a kike!\"\n\nRiefenstahl's protestations of obliviousness were always mendacious: She was photographed in such amiable postures with Hitler, many believed she was his lover; she used Gypsy concentration-camp inmates as extras in Tiefland; and she filmed Triumph of the Will, a masterpiece of propaganda that views the Third Reich and its abscess-Fuhrer with the same vacant, awed gaze she would bring to her examinations of majestic sea creatures and Nubian tribesmen.\n\nThroughout Riefenstahl's life, critics have debated the merit of her work in conjunction with its content, and are generally stymied. While it is possible, if not necessary, to separate the artist and his or her work, it is not possible to separate technique and text, and those who have tried to do so are as hoodwinked as the German public who devoured Triumph of the Will and Olympia as heraldic evidence of the righteousness of the Nazi cause.\n\nNo one ever evokes the architecture of Albert Speer as exemplary, and in spite of his once-eager membership in the Nazi Party, Speer himself would spend the rest of his postwar life in penitence, asserting that while he did not know what was going on around him, he should have.\n\nAs a human being, Riefenstahl was beneath contempt, and her film work needs to be recast, not as inviolable instances of art, but as documents that have historical value, and nothing more.\n\nLike the original punk artists who wore swastikas -- a fashion detail not one of them has ever accounted for -- Riefenstahl fans, like Speer, should also know better.\n\nThe kind of radical chic that plagued the 1970s, and introduced an ironical ennui to popular culture, still colours our ability to distinguish, for fear of lacking a liberal sensibility, right from wrong. When Ray MÃ¼ller's 1993 documentary, The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, debuted, Vanity Fair published a particularly vulgar shot of the ancient femme fatale lying in a field of daisies, and this fatuously daring shot only confirmed that photography and film are not merely representational, but loaded with information about the artist's intentions.\n\nThe imagination as deployed in art, as Dionne Brand once noted, is not sacrosanct. Art should never persuade us that it is a de facto Reichstag, impenetrable, impervious to our objections, our strongest concerns.\n\nIn The Godfather, one of the capos remarks to Michael Corleone, a Second World War veteran, that \"they should have stopped Hitler in Munich. They never should have let him get away with that.\" Riefenstahl got away with it for the better part of a century as we sat back and fought for the blamelessness of art: We should be direly ashamed."
