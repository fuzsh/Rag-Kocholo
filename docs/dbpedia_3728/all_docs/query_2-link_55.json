        "text": "1 The first documentary photographs and films of the mass murder of six million Jews that came to public attention were taken by soldiers and professional photographers of the Allied forces at the time of liberating the concentration and extermination camps. Images of corpses piled high, walking skeletons, dying survivors, captured guards and the sites of torture, death and cremation shocked the world-to the degree, that is, to which photographs still had the power to shock. In the US and British zones of occupation, Germans who lived close to camp sites were made to watch, and sometimes bury, corpses while others were shown films and photographs documenting the atrocities. Among the various reasons for the program \"to view the atrocities,\"1 it may be assumed, was the desire to replace the collective pictorial memory of the previous heroic twelve years with a new imagery, an imagery constructed with the help of photographic documentation. The aim was to diffuse the grandiose images of Nazi party rallies, the Autobahns and urban architecture, organized leisure and advanced war technology, which the National Socialist-system had so successfully deployed as its vision of the present and the future. Memories of grandeur were supposed to give way to images that represented the past as a criminal and barbaric time. In their efforts to document this program, American soldiers took photos of various Germans in front of such photos. More often than not these viewers, mostly women, older men and children, were shown with stern or emotionless faces often trying to avoid looking at the photos, their eyes cast down or turned away. There is a remarkable contrast between those Germans who turn their faces away, because they do not wish to confront these images, and others who have been characterized precisely by their pathologic compulsion to look at scenes of torture and murder.2 We know of men who took photos of the war of extermination in defiance of an official ban and often persisted in retaining them, even in circumstances that, after 1945, turned them into incriminating evidence against their owners. An extremely strong emotional attachment seems to have emanated from these images, tying their owners to them. For many years, these private photos were all but forgotten and the main focus was on 'official' visual documents from Allied sources and German offices and archives. Among these, a limited number of photographs have been continuously reproduced in illustrated history books on the Holocaust, in textbooks for schools and universities, exhibition catalogues, tour guides and similar publications. They continue to be shown either for educational purposes or as visual evidence in support of written texts, although they have by now become metonymical and lost their visual power. They no longer produce the urge to look away. It is intriguing to ask the question in what ways these photos contributed to the creation of memory."
