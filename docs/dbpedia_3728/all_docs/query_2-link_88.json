I doubt many of us, especially here on letterboxd, would agree to this avoidance of these infamous yet significant works of art. But, White, as per usual, cloaks his praise of politically suspect movies in the guise of \"universal themes\" and \"pure aestheticism\"‚Äîthe language of the critic unwilling or unable to deal with the fact that the work of art is a product of determinate forces, arising as the 'vision' of the artist.

We're just not accustomed to seeing shots of swastika flags with big, swelling, glorious music, and Hitler being presented as borderline cute as he gets excited over a race. It's so compellingly wrong and unsettling. Olympia is disturbing and fascinating. One of the most amazing pieces of history I've ever seen. It's much more palatable than Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, if only because its politics are quieter, reduced to smarmy narration about Black athletes and glory shots of Hitler, and because it's impossible for the outcomes to be entirely rewritten (Jesse Owens... amazing). The filmmaking on display is staggering. Everything is shot with incredible flair. The slow motion is thrilling. The way Riefenstahl builds tension‚Ä¶\n\nüèÖ\"A new world record!

She resultantly produced a great sports symphony, the innovations of which has influenced all subsequent sports coverage. It inevitably has associations to the Third Reich; trying ludicrously to provide the abhorrent ideologies with a stamp of approval, but it's practically unimaginable to genuinely refute it's both a tremendous aesthetic and technical achievement.\n\nIt's undoubtedly challenging to separate the‚Ä¶\n\nOlympia is the documentary directed by Leni Riefenstahl about the Olympic Games held in Berlin during the summer of 1936.\n\nThe first part, Fest der V√∂lker, begins by tracing the link between past and present with images of ancient Greece such as the Parthenon, the Erecteion and its porch of caryatids, ionic columns with fluted shafts, friezes and sculptures. The last of them, Myron' s Discobolus, gradually transforms into an athlete and from there we observe men and women displaying physical beauty and perfection according to classical ideals.

I also watched part 2 of this documentary, but I don't think I'll review it as it'd be sort of repetitive. Well, this documentary was fantastic, there were some shots that I was in awe of.
