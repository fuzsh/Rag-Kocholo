        "text": "What a remarkable connection to history she is. Great to have been able to get these interviews with her, even if this project was conceived by Leni herself.\n\nFiery and pretty sharp for 90. I really appreciated Leni’s very frank and matter-of-fact answers. What I like most is how they returned to many of the same locations from Leni’s past and how they snuck shots of Leni behind the scenes trying to direct the documentary herself."
