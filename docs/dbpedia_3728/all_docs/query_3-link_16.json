        "text": "(1902–2003). The legacy of German filmmaker, actress, photographer, and director Leni Riefenstahl was corrupted by her prominence as a filmmaker for Adolf Hitler. She was known chiefly for two documentaries she made during the Nazi regime that were later touted as some of the most successful propaganda pieces ever made. Triumph of the Will, which Hitler commissioned from Riefenstahl, was a documentary about the 1934 Nazi party congress in Nuremberg. The second, Olympia, was about the 1936 Summer Olympic Games in Munich. Later in life Riefenstahl was a photographer, working especially with small African tribes, and an underwater cinematographer, but she never outlived the questions and controversy surrounding her work for the Nazis.\n\nBerta Helene Amalie Riefenstahl was born on Aug. 22, 1902, in Berlin. She was the eldest daughter of Alfred and Berta Riefenstahl. Her father owned a plumbing engineering firm. She studied at the Kunstakademie, and later began serious studies in ballet and painting. Riefenstahl’s first career was as a dancer, and she performed in recitals in the early 1920s until a 1924 knee injury interrupted her dancing career. She worked as an actress in motion pictures for the next decade, specializing in popular German action and mountain films. The first of these was Peak of Destiny (1925), which was directed by Arnold Franck. In order to play the roles in these action films, Riefenstahl learned to ski and to climb mountains. The plots of some of these films were weak, but the images of human beings conquering nature were vivid. Later film critics argued that these films contained the seeds of proto-Nazism. Riefenstahl, who was a sensuous beauty, became a famous and adored actress in Germany.\n\nIn 1931 she formed Leni Riefenstahl-Produktion, and in 1932 she wrote, directed, produced, and starred in The Blue Light. The film, based on an old Italian folktale of a young girl fascinated by the light emanating from a cave, was very well received. Hitler was one of its admirers, and after he saw the film, he asked Riefenstahl to make a documentary about the party congress in Nuremberg. The Blue Light was the first film Riefenstahl had ever directed, and it was awarded the silver medal at the 1932 Venice Biennale.\n\nTriumph of the Will (1934) was a documentary about the rally in Nuremberg during the Nazis’ rise to power. The film was financed entirely by the Nazi party, and Riefenstahl had more than 100 people working on it. It was awarded the gold medal at the Venice Biennale in 1937. Riefenstahl directed and edited the film, filling it with stunning and highly effective propaganda, including liberal use of symbols such as the swastika and soaring eagles. In the film Hitler is pictured as a savior, and many of the shots scanning the crowd highlight the adoration in the eyes of the people watching him.\n\nOlympia, Riefenstahl’s record of the 1936 Olympics, took her two full years to complete, from training all her cameramen to her final edit. The film, which was released on Hitler’s birthday, won Riefenstahl another gold medal at the Venice Biennale. Decades later, some film experts considered Olympia one of the greatest films of all time. Riefenstahl changed the way documentaries of sporting events were approached. She had 33 people operating cameras, including those capturing reactions in the crowd, those recording preparations, and those filming the events themselves. She tied a camera to a balloon to film events from above, and she followed runners around the track with the camera. The Nazi ideal of the perfection of the Aryan human body is reflected in the film, but, despite the racial bias of the Nazi philosophy, Riefenstahl did give attention to African American athlete Jesse Owens’ triumphs as well.\n\nAfter the war Riefenstahl was blacklisted. She was held prisoner in Austria by the United States Army and was later imprisoned by French authorities. Allegations that she engaged in political activity to support the Nazi regime were declared false by tribunals in Baden in 1948 and in West Berlin in 1952.\n\nIn 1956 Riefenstahl made her first visit to Africa, and by the 1960s she was well into a new chapter in her life, photographing the Nuba people of The Sudan. Her photographs were published by magazines including Life, Der Stern, and L’europeo. She lived among small tribes and released books of photographs, including The Last of the Nuba (1974) and People of the Kau (1976). At age 71 she began doing underwater photography, publishing Coral Gardens in 1978. In her 90s Riefenstahl wrote her autobiography and participated in films made by biographers about her life. Riefenstahl’s other films included The Holy Mountain (1925), The Big Leap (1927), The White Hell of Pitz Palu (1929), Storms of Mont Blanc (1930), White Frenzy (1931), S.O.S. Iceberg (1933), and Tiefland (1945). Some of her other publications included Mein Afrika (1982), Memoiren (1987), Wonders Under the Water (1991), The Sieve of Time (1992), and her autobiography, Leni Riefenstahl: A Memoir (1994).\n\nIn 1993 director Ray Muller released a documentary entitled The Wonderful Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl. The film received much attention, and its subject, in her 90s, was as strong and as unrepentant as ever. Some hailed her as the greatest woman filmmaker of all time, while others condemned her for willingly using her artistic talents to support the criminal regime of a genocidal dictator. Her films were praised for their remarkable editing, for their fine cinematography, and for their full and well-chosen scores. In 1997 the Biography series on television’s A & E cable channel produced Leni Riefenstahl: The Führer’s Filmmaker. The movie highlighted the events of her life.\n\nAlthough she was cleared by tribunals after the war and was never a member of the Nazi party, Riefenstahl never quite lived down her connection with Hitler. She remained unapologetic, maintaining that her politics were separate from her art. During a trip to The Sudan in 2000 to visit the Nuba, she was injured in a helicopter crash. In 2003 Riefenstahl released her first film in 48 years. The work, a documentary entitled Impressionen Unter Wasser (Impressions Under Water), was a series of vignettes about underwater life in the Indian Ocean. She died at the age of 101 on Sept. 8, 2003, in Poecking, Germany."
