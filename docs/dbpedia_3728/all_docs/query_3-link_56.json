        "text": "BERLIN -- Leni Riefenstahl, the legendary filmmaker reviled and revered for movies she made about Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich, died Tuesday -- one of the last confidantes of the Nazi dictator. She was 101.\n\nRiefenstahl died Monday night at her home in the Bavarian lakeside village where she had lived for 20 years. No cause of death was announced.\n\nShe made four films for Hitler, the best known of which were \"Triumph of the Will,\" which recorded the Nazis' 1934 rally at Nuremberg, and \"Olympia,\" a meditation on muscle and movement at the 1936 Berlin Olympic games.\n\nBoth films accented her artistry, but more troubling to her critics, presented the Nazis to the world as peaceful and tolerant. Her portrayal of Olympic sports was sensual and stunning; her depiction of the Nuremberg rally shows Hitler in godlike poses and apple-cheeked children handing him flowers.\n\nGerman Culture Minister Christina Weiss said Riefenstahl's life tragically demonstrated the inseparable link between art and politics.\n\n\"Her career shows that ... art is never unpolitical, and that form and content cannot be separated from one another,\" Weiss said.\n\nBorn Helene Bertha Amalie Riefenstahl on Aug. 22, 1902, the daughter of a heating firm owner, she started out as a creative dancer. A knee injury made her shift to movies.\n\nIn 1932, she starred in the self-directed \"The Blue Light,\" which celebrated Germany's Alpine mystique -- and reputedly enthralled Hitler.\n\nThat same year, Riefenstahl, then 30, heard Hitler speak at a rally and wrote to him offering her talents.\n\nTaken into custody by military authorities after the Nazi surrender in 1945, Riefenstahl was eventually released without charges. But it was years later before she obtained a work permit, and the films she made under Hitler would become a permanent reminder that she had served a regime that produced concentration camps, gas chambers, the Gestapo, and genocide of European Jews.\n\nAs one of Germany's leading movie stars, Riefenstahl caught the fuhrer's eye with her performance in \"The Blue Light,\" which she co-directed, about a courageous village girl who scales a treacherous mountain. Hitler selected her to make the film of the 1934 Nazi congress.\n\nFor the filming of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Riefenstahl was officially working for the International Olympic Committee, but her efforts were surreptitiously financed and later exploited by the Nazi regime. She would produce an epic three-hour documentary entitled \"Olympia,\" that became a prototype for much of sports television decades later.\n\nThe media mostly ignored her after the war, but she did return to the public spotlight with the publication of her memoirs and the U.S. release of a documentary film about her, Ray Muller's \"The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl\" (1993).\n\nShe learned to scuba dive at age 71 to take photographs for her book \"Coral Gardens,\" which was hailed for its stunning beauty.\n\nShe continued diving well into her 90s. In 2002, she released in conjunction with her 100th birthday a 45-minute documentary, \"Underwater Impressions,\" about her 30 years of exploring the coast of Indonesia.\n\nHilmar Hofmann, director of the Goethe Institute, was quoted as saying, \"It exceeds even the talents of the veteran French underwater film-maker Jacques-Yves Cousteau.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press and The Washington Post was used in this report."
