        "text": "Pre-Spanish Period\n\n“This land is Ours God gave this land to us”\n\nBefore the Spaniards came to the Philippines, Filipinos lived in villages or barangays ruled by chiefs or datus. The datus comprised the nobility. Then came the maharlikas (freemen), followed by the aliping mamamahay (serfs) and aliping saguiguilid (slaves).\n\nHowever, despite the existence of different classes in the social structure, practically everyone had access to the fruits of the soil. Money was unknown, and rice served as the medium of exchange.\n\nSpanish Period\n\n“United we stand, divided we fall”\n\nWhen the Spaniards came to the Philippines, the concept of encomienda (Royal Land Grants) was introduced. This system grants that Encomienderos must defend his encomienda from external attack, maintain peace and order within, and support the missionaries. In turn, the encomiendero acquired the right to collect tribute from the indios (native).\n\nThe system, however, degenerated into abuse of power by the encomienderos The tribute soon became land rents to a few powerful landlords. And the natives who once cultivated the lands in freedom were transformed into mere share tenants.\n\nFirst Philippine Republic\n\n“The yoke has finally broken”\n\nWhen the First Philippine Republic was established in 1899, Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo declared in the Malolos Constitution his intention to confiscate large estates, especially the so-called Friar lands.\n\nHowever, as the Republic was short-lived, Aguinaldo’s plan was never implemented.\n\nAmerican Period\n\n“Long live America”\n\nSignificant legislation enacted during the American Period:\n\nPhilippine Bill of 1902 – Set the ceilings on the hectarage of private individuals and corporations may acquire: 16 has. for private individuals and 1,024 has. for corporations.\n\nLand Registration Act of 1902 (Act No. 496) – Provided for a comprehensive registration of land titles under the Torrens system.\n\nPublic Land Act of 1903 – introduced the homestead system in the Philippines.\n\nTenancy Act of 1933 (Act No. 4054 and 4113) – regulated relationships between landowners and tenants of rice (50-50 sharing) and sugar cane lands.\n\nThe Torrens system, which the Americans instituted for the registration of lands, did not solve the problem completely. Either they were not aware of the law or if they did, they could not pay the survey cost and other fees required in applying for a Torrens title.\n\nCommonwealth Period\n\n“Government for the Filipinos”\n\nPresident Manuel L. Quezon espoused the \"Social Justice\" program to arrest the increasing social unrest in Central Luzon.\n\nSignificant legislation enacted during Commonwealth Period:\n\n1935 Constitution – \"The promotion of social justice to ensure the well-being and economic security of all people should be the concern of the State\"\n\nCommonwealth Act No. 178 (An Amendment to Rice Tenancy Act No. 4045), Nov. 13, 1936 – Provided for certain controls in the landlord-tenant relationships\n\nNational Rice and Corn Corporation (NARIC), 1936 – Established the price of rice and corn thereby help the poor tenants as well as consumers.\n\nCommonwealth Act. No. 461, 1937 – Specified reasons for the dismissal of tenants and only with the approval of the Tenancy Division of the Department of Justice.\n\nRural Program Administration, created March 2, 1939 – Provided the purchase and lease of haciendas and their sale and lease to the tenants.\n\nCommonwealth Act No. 441 enacted on June 3, 1939 – Created the National Settlement Administration with a capital stock of P20,000,000.\n\nJapanese Occupation\n\n“The Era of Hukbalahap”\n\nThe Second World War II started in Europe in 1939 and in the Pacific in 1941.\n\nHukbalahap controlled whole areas of Central Luzon; landlords who supported the Japanese lost their lands to peasants while those who supported the Huks earned fixed rentals in favor of the tenants.\n\nUnfortunately, the end of war also signaled the end of gains acquired by the peasants.\n\nUpon the arrival of the Japanese in the Philippines in 1942, peasants and workers organizations grew strength. Many peasants took up arms and identified themselves with the anti-Japanese group, the HUKBALAHAP (Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon).\n\nPhilippine Republic\n\n“The New Republic”\n\nAfter the establishment of the Philippine Independence in 1946, the problems of land tenure remained. These became worst in certain areas. Thus the Congress of the Philippines revised the tenancy law.\n\nPresident Manuel A.
