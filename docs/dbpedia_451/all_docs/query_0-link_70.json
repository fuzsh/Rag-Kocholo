As we provide the right platform, through this Sports Olympics, we encourage our students to\n\nbe conscious of both their mental and physical well-being. In the same way that the camaraderie we seek\n\nto create among them during this event will also help in their emotional and psychological maturity while\n\nthe right attitude and sportsmanship will bring about the discipline and character that we envision for\n\nthem to have.\n\nThe recent pandemic hampered a lot of activities inside and outside of the classroom settings. The\n\nimprovement in the situation and easing of protocols have allowed us now to freely participate in various\n\nsports activities. I just hope that we keep in mind to be safe at all times and be conscious of the health\n\nadvisories to protect not just ourselves but also our fellow athletes, players, coaches, and officials as well.\n\nLet us all be thankful of this opportunity of being, literally, in one playing field to take part in our\n\nrespective sports events. Remember, this is not about winning, but being able to do your best while\n\nenjoying the experience/s and learning from the mistakes, no matter how small, and from every fall, no\n\nmatter how hard it may seem. Win or lose, we rise back again and we will stand as one.\n\nGood luck to all of us. Let us continue to uphold the ideals of camaraderie and sportsmanship to realize\n\nour vision of One Southern Tagalog Region.\n\nHERNANDO D. ROBLES, Ed.D.,CEO VI\n\nPresident, Cavite State University\n\nP:08\n\nMy kindest regards to the participating State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) for providing\n\nanother space for our students to realize their growing roles in national advancement. I stand with\n\nyou in this continuous effort to contribute in the field of sports.\n\nI hope this event leads to the strengthening of meaningful relations within and among the State\n\nUniversities and Colleges (SUCs) of this region. Let us be the embodiment of the theme, âOne\n\nSouthern Tagalog Regionâ â for our goals and visions lead to one place; that is, to bring PRIDE\n\nand offer EXCELLENCE.\n\nTo our athletes, you are the pride and the future of the Philippine Sports. Learn everything there is\n\nto learn; for this occasion will surely have a lot of lessons to offer. Take home not just medals; but\n\nalso, the good practices you will witness here. At this moment, you are already victors - but take\n\nthis opportunity to celebrate bigger victories. Show your power; but remain humble. Be humble;\n\nand yet be sure to showcase your best. Claim the best and work hard for it. Persevere â and the rest\n\nwill follow.\n\nTo a successful and meaningful participation!\n\nLEVY B.ARAGO, JR., Ph.D.\n\nPresident, Mindoro State University\n\nP:09\n\nThe progress that we have shown from the beginning of the pandemic up unto this day is a\n\nsignificant sign of excellence. We get to thrive where we are. Sports abilities entail huge amount of\n\ndiscipline, dedication and passion which are also required in other fields. The pandemic may have\n\nlimited us in some ways but it has also opened several doors of possibilities to continue striving for\n\nexcellence and passion, especially now that we are gradually paving our way back to how things\n\nused to be.\n\nThe STRASUC Olympics 2022 has served as a perfect avenue for student-athletes to thrive beyond\n\ntheir abilities as a student. The sportsmanship developed in the games will also help instill this\n\nvalue as they move forward in their lives. Furthermore, the fellowship among participating schools\n\nwill help build strong bonds among us as we share the same grounds; together we can build further\n\nconnections and fruitful relationships as a universities of our beloved region.\n\nI commend all coaches and every single person behind the Southern Tagalog Regional Association\n\nof State Universities and Colleges (STRASUC) 2022. To all student-athletes bearing the flag of\n\ntheir respective university, remember that you are already a champion in your own right.\n\nI congratulate all University Presidents, and every person behind this endeavor. A special thanks is\n\nalso extended to Cavite State University for graciously hosting this event for all the schools of our\n\nregion.\n\nMabuhay ang STRASUC!\n\nTIRSO A.

Despite still living with the\n\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we can celebrate unity and oneness through this event, sharing\n\nhappy memories and new learnings.\n\nWith our theme, âOne Southern Tagalog Region,â I hope this event brings us together in a peaceful\n\ncompetition, builds bridges, and unites us in all our diversity. Events like these give our prestigious\n\nstudents several chances to shine, supporting them to win. But let us not lose sight of the fact that\n\nsimply having the chance to share bright ideas and genuine self with a thousand brilliant people, to\n\nexperience the beauty of diversity, and to go home with new knowledge, inspiration, goals in\n\nmind, and building new and good relationships, is itself a win.\n\nI congratulate everyone who participated in this effort, especially the SUC Presidents and sports\n\nadministrators. They have honed excellent leadership, interpersonal harmony, and teamwork. The\n\nMarinduque State College joins forces with you in your efforts to make sure that the next\n\ngeneration has a sound body and mind.\n\nOnce again, a triumphant STRASUC Olympics 2022 to all! Mabuhay po tayong lahat!\n\nDIOSDADO P. ZULUETA, DPA\n\nPresident, Marinduque State College\n\nP:12\n\nThe Regional STRASUC Olympics 2022 is one of the most anticipated events of our region. Here,\n\nwe get to showcase the athletic prowess of our students proudly representing their respective\n\nuniversities. Just like any other competition, as we all aim to snatch the championship and we see\n\neach other as a competitor, more importantly, we should always bear in mind, as one Southern\n\nTagalog Region, we are united entity of the proud region we represent, bound together by the\n\nfriendship we have built strongly throughout the years.\n\nAfter two years of hiatus from physical activities, STRASUC Olympics 2022 shall again open its\n\ndoors to all of us, through our generation host Cavite State University â Indang Campus. May we\n\nall relive the joy of stretching out our muscles, cheering for our teams and showing vitality through\n\nthis event may this also lead to new relationships built upon the spirit of sportsmanship, new\n\nfriendships from other campuses and new learning opportunities for each and every one of us. I am\n\nexcited to see our athletes savor the victory of emerging as winners and the sparkle of the eyes of\n\nthose who get to be motivated to try even harder the next time.\n\nThrough this event, may we be able to foster a deeper relationship among us in the region. Take up\n\nimportant lessons and best practices we get to learn from one another and use it to further improve\n\nour passion. To the organizers of this event, I commend all of your for successfully bringing all of\n\nus together again. May this event bind us even stronger as we all move as one as members of\n\nSouthern Tagalog Region Association of State Universities and Colleges.\n\nMabuhay ang STRASUC Olympics 2022!\n\nMabuhay and mga atleta ng Timog Katagalugan!\n\nELBERTC. EDANIOL, Ed.D.\n\nPresident, Occidental Mindoro State College\n\nP:13\n\nMy warmest congratulations to the STRASUC for finally staging its first ever sports olympics after\n\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, despite the setback brought about by the pandemic, excellence\n\nin sports can be revived once again to help us all in our quest for excellence in all of our other\n\nendeavors. After all, sports can empower an inspire all of us to be the best we can be. The\n\ncamaraderie and friendships we develop through sports olympics, even the spirit of competition\n\nand sportsmanship can lift us up in unity and concern for each otherâs well being. That in this socalled new normal, there is nothing new in sports -excellence, competition, sportsmanship,\n\nachievment are still norm. But this time we have to emerge from the now dying embers of the\n\npandemic and continue to excel together in unity and concern for each other in the STRASUC. As\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar said, âOne man can be a crucial ingredient on a team, but one man cannot\n\nmake a team.â So let us al rise over the challenges of this new normal, together!. I praise and thank\n\nGod for allowing us to be here once again and see and feel the same ambiance of sports olympics\n\nwe are familiar with, albeit in new setting. Palawan State University is happy and proud to join this\n\nhistoric event. Let me once again extend my warmest felicitations to all who made this possible.\n\nLet the games begin!\n\nCongratulations and Mabuhay STRASUC!\n\nRAMON M. DOCTO, PhD.\n\nPresident, Palawan State University\n\nP:14\n\nPagbati, STRASUC!\n\nBeing a powerhouse of great players for decades, our region is always famed for excelling in\n\ndiverse sports in the nationals including soccer, futsal, softball, athletics, racket sports, among\n\nothers. Out of the blue, we are revving up once again to destine the best men who will profoundly\n\nbring honor to the whole region.\n\nWith this yearâs STRASUC Olympics tagline âOne Southern Tagalog Regionâ, the lands or seas\n\ndividing us are lost in sight for we are one in spirit this week to celebrate the games in the Home of\n\nthe Brave.\n\nAs we bring back the games, let us strive to uphold sportsmanship at all costs. Sports may develop\n\ncompetitiveness among teams but at the end of the day, the indispensable wisdom that one should\n\nfoster from each other is the ability to acknowledge wins and accept losses. To quote this from\n\nRobert Ingersoll, âThe greatest test of courage on earth is to bear defeat without losing heart.â\n\nThe Romblon State University keeps its fingers crossed for everyoneâs success. Our victory lies in\n\nbuilding a bridge towards a stronger, more resilient Southern Tagalog Region. May these games\n\nlead us to friendships, trust, and solidarity.\n\nMabuhay tayong lahat!\n\nMERIAN P.CATAJAY-MANI, Ed.D,CESE\n\nPresident, Romblon State University\n\nP:15\n\nAlan Armstrong once said, âChampions do not become champions when they win the event, but in the hours, weeks, months\n\nand years they spend preparing for it. The victorious performance itself is merely the demonstration of their championship\n\ncharacter.â\n\nIndeed, all of you here today are champions of your own character which is built over time as you offer your efforts and\n\nperseverance to practice and prepare for this very significant event - Southern Tagalog Region Association of State Universities\n\nand Collegesâ Sports Competition.\n\nSTRASUC has remained resilient through the years. Holding sports competitions now in the midst of the pandemic in the New\n\nNormal is an achievement for all us! As we slowly revert to the normalcy of personal interaction and face to face classes, we\n\nare now moving forward by rebuilding the confidence and ability of our athletes by holding STRASUC 2022.\n\nThis event is a platform for students to channel their diverse sportsmanship skills which would emphasize the importance of\n\nfinding unity in diversity. This yearâs STRASUC Sports Competition has reminded us of these two important insights:\n\nFirst, we need to Strengthen Sportsmanship â This reminds us to practice fairness, ethics, respect, and a sense of fellowship\n\nwith one's competitors and others. Having the skills to compete is good but having the right attitude in the competition is more\n\nimportant in any competition.\n\nSecond, we need to Develop Camaraderie â Let us celebrate camaraderie among different State Universities by not just\n\nshowing them what we are good at but also how we can support one another.\n\nAs we move forward to the future, may we never cease to highlight the significance of this STRASUC Sports Competition in\n\ndeveloping our skillful athletes and in honing their discipline and right attitude for the sports competition. This is also an\n\nimportant component of developing studentsâ bodily kinesthetic intelligence.\n\nGod bless to all the participants. Congratulations to the organizers of this yearâs Southern Tagalog Region Association of State\n\nUniversity Sports Competition.\n\nDORACIE B. ZOLETA- NANTES, PhD\n\nPresident, Southern Luzon State University\n\nP:16\n\nAn Academic Institution is tasked not only to mould the minds of the young generation to become\n\nvaluable members of the society. Schools are also entrusted to foster holistic development among\n\nits students.\n\nTo that end, participation in sports completions is indeed a worthy endeavour; one where our\n\nstudents will surely benefit from. Through competitive sports and competitions, we encourage our\n\nyoung wards to improve themselves and become better versions of who they are. We develop their\n\nsense of pride, their sense of camaraderie and their sense of sportsmanship. That is why it is truly\n\ndisheartening that because of the pandemic, we are forced to forgo with our usual sports\n\ncompetitions. Events which should have displayed the skills and talents of our students were sadly\n\ncancelled and postponed in the name of safety and health precautions. And now that we are\n\ngradually recovering from the effects of the pandemic, it is invigorating to know that we are also\n\ntrying to bring back the usual competition. It is indeed a worthy endeavour, one where our students\n\nwill surely benefit from.\n\nThis activity will surely assure our athletes that we are still committed to nurture their athletic\n\npotentials.\n\nI hope that all participants do their best and strive for excellence.\n\nI wish all our competitors a good luck and stay safe!\n\nNANCY T. PASCUAL, Ed.D., RGC.\n\nPresident, University of Rizal System\n\nP:17\n\nOn behalf of the University of the Philippines Los BaÃ±os (UPLB), I welcome all the participants\n\nto the Southern Tagalog Regional Association of State Universities and Colleges (STRASUC)\n\nSports Olympics 2022.\n\nWith the theme âOne Southern Tagalog Region,â this yearâs STRASUC Sports Olympics aims to\n\nbring together student athletes, coaches, and trainers from various participating state universities\n\nand colleges through a series of sports competitions that promote participation, sportsmanship, and\n\nunity among students, faculty, and staff of various SUCs.\n\nUPLB is proud to be part of an event that does not only celebrate our youthâs athletic talent, but\n\nmore importantly, recognizes the value of sports towards contributing to our studentsâ holistic\n\ndevelopment.\n\nI wish all participants good luck and may you have an inspiring and enjoyable experience.\n\nMabuhay kayong lahat!\n\nJOSE V.CAMACHO JR., PhD.\n\nChancellor, University of the Philippines\n\nP:18\n\nGreetings!\n\nMy warmest congratulations to those who have supported the STRASUCâs continued effort to\n\nhold this Olympics annually. The Western Philippines University is highly esteemed to be part of\n\nthis event.\n\nAs we hold this STRASUC Olympics 2022 with the theme âOne Southern Tagalog Regionâ, we\n\nconsider the significant contributions of sports to the development of the region and of our country\n\nat large. It emphasizes the importance of working together as one region especially in todayâs\n\nhighly digital world. The theme highlights that if we will stand together as one region, then we will\n\nbe more productive and will achieve the best performance.\n\nIn this Olympics, all SUCs in the region are unified in one common goal through the different\n\nactivities that will enhance the skills and talents of the athletes. In addition, friendship, harmony\n\nand sportsmanship among the athletes, coaches and officials are achieved.\n\nWith this, I am grateful to all the organizers for this yearâs STRASUC Olympics. Likewise, my\n\nsincerest appreciation to the Western Philippines University delegation and to all the participants\n\nto this event. I wish the participants all the best. May this activity be blessed with the spirit of\n\noneness.\n\nGood luck and God bless us all.\n\nJULIE HOPE TIMOTEAP. EVINA, PhD.\n\nPresident, Western Philippines University\n\nP:19\n\nPART I.
