        "text": "Comparative Study on the Philippine Revolution 1896 and World War II 1941: Case of Macario Sakay and Jose Calugas\n\nMa. Esperanza Angelica De Jesus Rochelle Irish Mendoza Lynniel Faye Bartolo Sheila May Soliman Jamil Elaira Joe A-\n\nMr. Joel Regala\n\nSeptember 8, 2020\n\nTITLE\n\nComparative Study on the Philippine Revolution 1896 and World War II 1941: Case of Macario Sakay and Jose Calugas\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFor more than centuries that have passed and documents that have been recovered by many historians about the real events of the Philippine history, the people who have taken part in the Philippine Revolution and World War II, remain overlooked, if not, unsung and unknown to the knowledge of most Filipinos in today9s generation. Countless Filipinos have stood against the forces of inhabitants displaying bravery, valor and nationalism.\n\nAccording to Prof. Bernardita Churchill (n.) on her article <History of the Philippine Revolution=, the Revolution against Spain had two phases: the first from the declaration of defiance against Spanish rule on August 23, 1896 till the conclusion of truce in December 1897; the second term from the return till the outbreak of the Filipino-American War in February 1899. The Philippine Revolution is one of the most important events in the history of the Philippines where it awakened and sparked the Filipinos to resist and initiate series of bloody revolts against the Spain9s longstanding colonial rule and the American9s falsehood allegiance. The Filipinos9 rage continued until the Japanese invasion that resulted to the declaration of Philippine World War II in 1941 which became one of the darkest periods of the Philippine history.\n\nReview of Related Literature\n\nMacario Sakay: Characteristics and Early Life\n\nMacario Sakay was born in 1870 in Tondo, Manila, he became a tailor and a stage actor at Teatro Ponvenir in Tondo with Andres Bonifacio. Due to his participation in Tagalog dramas in the theatres, he was exposed to the world of romanticism, tragedy and courage that made him aware of the problems and struggles of the colonized people and the Philippines condition during the reign of the Spanish (Severino, 2018).\n\nAccording to many historians and to the documents left of the Philippine Revolution 1896-1907, Sakay9s stigma was his robust long black hair that was untrimmed but tidily groomed down to the final joint of his spinal column. This was all due to his vow of never cutting his Malayan hair, and so his men, for the length of their hair signified the length of time they spent on the mountains. His order was a depiction of dissent and defiance against the colonial intruders of Philippine Revolution 4 Spain in 1896 and America in 1907.\n\nThe First Phase of Philippine Revolution\n\nHe joined and actively took part in the revolutionary society, the Kataastaasan, Kagalanggalangan Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan (KKK) in 1896 wherein he was one of the early members of. Alongside Bonifacio, he led forces against the Spanish, and continued their strategic fighting until Spain entered the Treaty of Paris with the United States of America, ceding the Philippines for $20 million (Jimenez, 2019).\n\nThe Second Phase of the Philippine Revolution\n\nSakay seized the leadership of the revolution after Aguinaldo surrendered to the Americans. He was captured and granted freedom in 1902. In that year, he spearheaded armed movements of resistance against the American Empire, and founded the <Republika ng Katagalugan=, with him as president ( Today in Philippine History, September 13, 1907, Macario Sakay was hanged , n.). He operated under an absolute defiance against the Americans where he became a great threat to. The Americans passed the Brigandage Act by the Philippine Commission, legally labeling those Filipinos still fighting for freedom as bandits and robbers, and Sakay as an outlaw. There were search-and-destroy missions, misinformation and propaganda by the U. S. Army in an attempt to suppress Sakay9s forces but he was never captured (Jimenez, 2019).\n\nOn September 13, 1907, Sakay and his men was branded as bandits, found guilty of their seditious acts like rape, arson, and other unlawful crimes which they all denied allegations of, under the Brigandage Act of 1902, and hanged due to the betrayal of one of his supposed benefactor, Dr. Dominador Gomez which had caused the fall and death of Sakay and his patriotic act of defense and revolution against the Spaniards (Farolan, 2014).\n\nAccording to Howie Severino9s documentary on I-Witness: 8Ang Huling Katipunero: Macario Sakay9 (2018) and Filipino historian, Michael Charleston Chua, his last words was <Adios, Filipinas=. Moreover, it has also been said that during his final moments before he was hanged, he said: <Death comes to all of us sooner or later, so I will face\n\nthe enemy9s ranks and they maintained a steady fire on the enemy positions, other soldiers were given time to dig in and defend the line. For these actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor which was presented to him by Gen. George Marshall (Farolan, 2014).\n\nPatriotism\n\nAccording to Andrea Baumeister (2016), patriotism is a feeling of attachment and commitment to a country, nation, or political community. Macario Sakay joining the Katipunan and taking control of the leadership of the revolution against the Americans instigated his act of patriotism. To steer clear from misinformation and propaganda against him, he issued a manifesto as affirmation of their loyalty to justice and to the country ( Long Live the Long-Haired Hero! , 2018). On the other hand, Jose Calugas outstanding valor in the Philippine Scouts marked a spirited pursuit during the war against the Japanese. Both actions deemed patriotic for tenaciously and bravely showing their true intent of fighting only for the Philippines.\n\nSovereignty\n\nPhilippines9 sovereignty was sold by the Spain to the United States, however, Macario Sakay valiantly stood for the sovereignty of the Philippines against the American Regime. The struggles he faced after the resistance against the Spain seemed nothing as he and his men continued to battle with the Americans even after being branded as bandits of their own country. His missions did not only show how patriotic he was but also signified his determination to fight for the Philippines right to self-government ( The Philippines, 1898– 1946 , n.).\n\nIndependence\n\nBoth Macario Sakay and Jose Calugas9 acts of heroism and patriotism were affected by their concern for the country9s independence. Sakay was one of the many Filipinos who fought for independence and experience the full <Filipino-control= in our own country, thus he sought for sovereignty as well. The two heroes fought from different revolts and wars against colonialism and imperialism. Their bold resistance to the oppressors and unending service to the country only sparked to continuously fight in granting independence in our country ( Stories from the Northwest: WWII – Jose Calugas , 2007).\n\nKatipunan and Republika ng Tagalog during Philippine Revolution\n\nMacario Sakay as part of the revolutionary movement, has a very prominent contribution to the Philippine history. He was given an opportunity to fight for Philippines, he led forces against and planned steps on how he can defeat the long-standing rule of Spain over the Philippines. Moreover, he established the Tagalog Republic when Emilio Aguinaldo was captured by and surrendered to the Americans in order to continue resistance forces fighting for the Philippines9 independence. Due to the forces he led, he was named as the last revolutionary hero resisting American9s occupation (Jimenez, 2019).\n\nMedal of Honor: Outstanding Valor during World War II\n\nJose Calugas Sr. is the only Filipino to earn the Medal of Honor (the United States military9s highest decoration for valor) during World War II for his for bravery during the Battle of Bataan (Beers, 1998).\n\nMETHODS\n\nHistorical approach will be used by the researchers, as it is the most appropriate for this study and it is used investigate events from the past. According to Allan Nevins (1938, pp-23), history can be described as \"an integrated narrative or description of past events or facts, written in a spirit of critical inquiry, for the whole truth. History varies from the natural sciences in procedure. Instead of the direct observations used in science, the historian normally may rely on others' observations. Therefore, the process involves investigating, recording, analyzing and interpreting the events of the past for the purpose of discovering generalizations that are helpful in understanding the past, understanding the present, and to a limited extent, in anticipating the future (Best,1977,p).\n\nFINDINGS\n\nMacario Sakay\n\nAccording to Severino (2018), Macario Sakay was born on the 1st of March 1870 in Tondo, Manila, had a working-class background, being a tailor and a stage actor, and had a big participation in Tagalog dramas that gave him knowledge and awareness about the struggles of the colonized people in the Philippines. He is also a hero and Filipino general who contributed a big part in the 1896 Philippine Revolution against the Spanish Colonialism and in the Philippine-American War (Macario Sakay Biography | HowOld).\n\nDuring the first phase of Philippine Revolution, Macario Sakay found an opportunity to join the Katipunan movement, where he and Bonifacio, as the one who founded the secret organization, established, worked and fought with their co-katipuneros (Jimenez, 2019). Coincidentally, during the second phase of the Philippine Revolution, he initiated armed movements of resistance against the Americans and founded the <Republika Ng Katagalugan= in 1902 proclaiming himself as president; a government, a constitution and a flag similar to that of Andres Bonifacio9s. The success against the colonial forces would not be possible without his brilliance in guerrilla warfare, revolutionary governance, and of course the love and support of the people. They were able to take control large numbers of weapons and ammunition from guarded garrisons, attack enemy quarters, defend strongholds, and evade capture. Generalissimo Macario Sakay, revolutionary leader, patriot, and among the last of the Filipino resistance fighters to surrender to the colonizing Americans, was hanged inside the Old Bilibid Prison in Manila. (Jimenez, 2019).\n\nA pleased and humble fighter, past afflictions and long division from his dear family relinquished his life to help other people. His longing to get decent training after he resigned from the military acquired him a BA Degree in Business Administration at age 55 as his most valued objective. He dedicated this advice for the youth of America, <Be a man and fight for America and protect America as much as you can whether at war or in peace.= Calugas returned to the Philippines to serve in the 24th Artillery Regiment, Philippine Scouts. Following the December 1941 Japanese attack of the Philippines, the regiment was requested to the Bataan peninsula. He died in 1998 and was buried in the Mountain View Cemetery, Tacoma (A Daring Heroic Feat: On Sgt. Jose Calugas, n.).\n\nJose Calugas Sr. 9 s brave act during the Bataan Death March 1942 brought a big impact in fighting for the independence of the Philippines. He'd been coordinating meal arrangements for his group when he saw that a close weapon position been hushed by the Japanese gunnery discharges. He got the ball rolling, willfully running the greater part a mile toward that weapon position that his actions led to the nickname \"One Man Army.\" For his actions, his superiors recommended Calugas for the U. military's highest award for valor, the Medal of Honor. Before he could receive it, however, all American forces on Bataan surrendered to Japanese forces (Burley, Washington: Coffee Break Press 1980).\n\nHe was renowned for his heroic deed during World War II. According to Beers (1198), Calugas filled in as a Philippine Youth and a legend that gives his life and heart for our beloved country. He was held at Camp O'Donnell for a very long time and was permitted to go to work in a Japanese-controlled rice factory. At the point when the Americans landed, Calugas battled in the recovery of the Philippines. The Medal of Honor known as the Congressional Medal of Honor is the most elevated military honor given to the United\n\nStates Military for bravery in battle far in excess of what was required. On April 30, 1945, Major General Richard J. Marshall awarded the Medal of Honor to Jose Calugas Sr. during a special ceremony. After the ceremony, he was offered U. citizenship and a commission in the United States Army and joined the military as a subsequent lieutenant. He was the first Filipino in World War II to be granted the Medal of Honor (Vachon, 2011).\n\nnew era of nationalism when Bonifacio was murdered and Sakay creating the Republika of Katagalugan in order to revive the old Katipunan and continue Bonifacio9s legacy.\n\nAccording to Nakpil (2008), Sakay can be described as <more determined than Rizal, more fortunate than Bonifacio, purer than Aguinaldo, more lyrically mysterious than Mabini.= After the independence, scholars 9 intent on writing history from a Filipino viewpoint began to review the colonial versions and examine old records. They came to the conclusion that Sakay was an authentic hero in the best tradition of Bonifacio, Emilio Jacinto and Apolonio Samson who were his comrades-in-arms in the Katipunan. Far from being a bandit, he was a glorious die-hard, incredibly brave and tenacious, a heroic hold- out for Philippine independence. His bravery to stand up for the sovereignty of the Philippines against the American Regime is evident. His determination to fight for the country could serve as an inspiration to the Filipino youth nowadays.\n\nJose Calugas Sr., being the only Filipino to earn the Medal of Honor 4 the United States of America9s military9s highest decoration for valor, during World War II for his for bravery during the Battle of Bataan, gave a significant tribute to the Philippines. His heroic act of voluntarily running a thousand miles to put the gunnery position back to its place had gained an opportunity in being able to handle the constant gun fires of the Japanese (Patterson, n.).\n\nThe two heroes portrayed what a Filipino should do during the times of oppression and revolution; their actions, despite being overlooked by bigger names of other heroes who have sacrificed their lives, were a proof that these heroes have put Philippines first in their hearts. Patriotism, bravery and determination are some of the characteristics\n\nwhich Filipinos can admire from the two. Knowing their stories is an inspiration for every Filipino.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThere are two unknown heroes from different phases of revolution whom were talked about on this comparative study named, Macario Sakay and Jose Calugas. Based on the findings of the study, conclusions were drawn. On their early life history, Sakay was born in Manila which is far from the quiet province of Iloilo where Calugas was born. Sakay had a good working background as well a big participation in Tagalog dramas; while Calugas became a responsible sibling at the age of 12 because of the death of her mother. For their heroic actions, Sakay became a part of the Katipunan movement and a president of <Republika ng Katagalugan\" that has its own constitution. And for Calugas' heroic actions, he went through 27 years in the United States Army and survived the <Death March= of the World War II.\n\nBoth heroes showed their love to their country, the Philippines, which led both of them to join revolution against America for Sakay and Japanese for Calugas. Because of both heroes9 bravery and determination to fight for our country, they gave significant contributions to gain our freedom. Sakay was hanged and his last words are \"Filipinas, farewell! Long live the Republic and may our independence be born in the future!= while Calugas received a Medal of Honor. These show that both of them possess patriotism and they seek for sovereignty.\n\nFlores, P. (1996). Macario Sakay : Tulisán or Patriot?
