        "text": "The word “katipunan” literally means “association”, and comes from the root tagalog word “tipon” meaning “gather together” or loosely “society”.\n\nBefore the Katipunan, Bonifacio had subscribed to the idea that meaningful changes could still be gained through peaceful means, thus he was one of those who responded to Rizal’s call to form the La Liga Filipina, a reformist organization, which gave Bonifacio valuable insights into the dynamics of fighting for a cause.\n\nBut on July 7, 1892, upon learning that Rizal was arrested and to be deported, a secret council was convened where Andres Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata (brother-in-law), Ladislao Diwa, Valentin Diaz, Deodato Arellano, Jose Dizon and a few other members of La Liga Filipina, came to the agreement that a revolutionary secret society must be founded, thus the virtual death of the La Liga Filipina gave birth to the Katipunan on the same day, the Kataas-taasang, Kagalang-galangang Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan (Supreme and Venerable Society of the Children of the Nation) was born. Bonifacio arrived at a radical conclusion that it was pointless to ask Spain for reforms.\n\nThe objectives of the Katipunan as brotherhood were threefold: political, moral and civic. They advocated for freedom from Spain to be achieved through armed struggle. They also saw it as their responsibility to help the poor and the oppressed, teach them good manners, hygiene and morality.\n\nThis secret brotherhood organization thrived as an underground society through the use of secret codes and passwords. Symbols, cryptologic languages, and clandestine rituals marked the Katipunan’s operations. These necessary tools ensured that the Spanish remained unaware of their plans. The organization had its own structure, law system and system of government. The Katipunan was dedicated to the development of its surrounding community; it established mutual aid societies, and forms of education for those who would not have been previously able to afford it.\n\nMost of the Katipunan’s founders were freemasons. The Katipunan patterned its initiation rites after the Masonry, but its ideological principles was derived from the French revolution and can be judged radical in its materialistic-historical orientation. It also had a hierarchy of rank that was similar to that of freemasonry. It directed attention to the unjust class structure of the colonial system, the increased exploitation of the indigenous population and collective need to affirm the strength of the working masses.\n\nThe Katipunan had four major aims, namely:\n\nTo develop a strong alliance with each and every Katipunero\n\nTo unite Filipinos into one solid nation\n\nTo win Philippine independence by means of an armed conflict (revolution)\n\nTo establish a republic after independence\n\nIt was the original plan of Bonifacio to increase its membership by employing the Sistemang Patatsulok or Triangle system, a system of enlistment wherein a recruiter would ask only two members to join, this was to ensure that growth would be discreet. Only the recruiter would know the names of both recruits while the recruits would not know each other. Thus the organization is encapsulated into three-man units. Bonifacio formed his first triangle with his two comrades, Teodoro Plata and Ladislao Diwa.\n\nBut the triangle method provided for slow growth so around October 1892, it was decided that members would be allowed to recruit as many persons as they could.\n\nThe organizational structure of the Katipunan entailed three ranks of membership, starting out as Katipon (member), then, moving up to Kawal (soldier), and eventually to Bayani (patriot). Members were to pay an entrance fee and a membership fee.\n\nThey formed small branches called Sangguniang Balangay and these small branches would form larger provincial councils, governed by the Sangguniang Bayan. All these would be overseen by the Kataastaasang Sanggunian (Supreme Council) which was composed of the Pangulo (president), Kalihim(secretary), Tagausig (fiscal), Tagaingat Yaman (treasurer) and six Kasanguni (councilors).\n\nThe legislative body of the Katipunan was known as the Katipunan Assembly, and it was composed of the members of the Supreme Council, along with the presidents of the popular and provincial councils.\n\nJudicial power rested in the Sangguniang Hukuman which were provincial courts that decided on internal matters, however, judgement on grave matters (such as betraying the Katipunan or committing acts penalized by the organization’s laws were meted by the “Secret Chamber”, composed of Andres Bonifacio, Emilio Jacinto, and Pio Valenzuela.\n\nAlthough Bonifacio was one of the prominent members of the Katipunan, he was not its first Supremo or President of the Supreme Council. The first President was Deodato Arellano elected on July 15, 1892. It was not until January 5, 1894 when Bonifacio would become the Supremo, and was the Supremo at the outbreak of the 1896 revolution.\n\nIt was also in 1894 when a young law student from the University of Santo Tomas by the name of Emilio Jacinto joined the Katipunan. He intellectualized the society’s aims and formulated the principles of the society as embodied in its primer, called Kartilla. It was written in tagalog and every recruit would commit to it by heart. Jacinto would later be called the “Brains of the Katipunan”.\n\nThe Katipunan also had its official organ called Kalayaan (Freedom), which was edited by Jacinto but only one edition of the paper was issued, the second was prepared but was never printed due to the discovery of the society.\n\nThe women also rendered valuable services to the Katipunan. At first, it was purely a patriotic society for men but due to the growing suspicion of the women regarding the nocturnal absences of their husbands and the reduction of their monthly earnings and “long hours of work”, Bonifacio had to bring them into the realm of the KKK. To become admitted one must be a wife, a daughter or a sister of a Katipunero. They guarded the secret papers and documents of the society. They also served as distractions for the civil guards when the Katipuneros were having their meetings as if they were only having harmless social parties.\n\nOver the next four years, the Katipunan founders would recruit new members. By the time the society was uncovered, historian, Teodoro Agoncillo estimated the members to have increased to around 30,000 in 1896, the Ilocano writer, Isabelo de los Reyes estimated membership from 15,000 to 50,000.\n\nAside from Manila, the Katipunan had sizable chapters in Batangas, Laguna, Cavite, Rizal, Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac and Nueva Ecija and smaller chapters in Ilocos Sur, Ilocos Norte, Pangasinan and the Bicol region.\n\nIn planning the revolution, Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise of rescuing Rizal from his detainment but Rizal refused the offer and did not want to have anything to do with the revolution.\n\nOn May 1896, a delegation was sent to the Emperor of Japan to solicit funds and military arms.\n\nRumors about the secret revolutionary society had been in circulation but no evidence could be found to support them. The big break for the Spanish authorities came when on August 19, 1896, a KKK member, Teodoro Patino told his sister Honoria about the existence of the Katipunan, who was then living with the nuns in a Mandaluyong orphanage. Patinio was a worker in the printing press of Diario de Manila.\n\nThe information upset Honoria that she told the orphanage’s Mother Superior, Sor Teresa de Jesus, so they went to see and told Fr. Mariano Gil, the parish priest of Tondo, who in turn accompanied the Guardia Civil to the printing press of Diario de Manila. They searched the premises and found evidence of the Katipunan’s existence. The printing press was padlocked and hundreds of suspected KKK members were arrested.\n\nOn August 23, 1896, Bonifacio and his fellow Katipuneros tore their cedulas (residence certificate) and shouted: “Long Live the Philippines”which marked the beginning of the revolution. This was called the “Cry of Balintawak” which actually occurred in Pugad Lawin. This is also called “ Sigaw ng Pugad Lawin”."
