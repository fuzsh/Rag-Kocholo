        "text": "2. Pío Alejandrino Valenzuela Personal details  Born: 11 July 1869, Valenzuela  Died: 6 April 1956, Valenzuela  Full name: Pío Valenzuela y Alejandrino  Spouse: Marciana Castro  Parents: Lorenza Alejandrino, Francisco Valenzuela  Education: Colegio de San Juan de Letran, University of Santo Tomas  Children: Arturo Castro Valenzuela, Diego Castro Valenzuela, MORE . Governor of Bulacan\n\n3. Pio Valenzuela y Alejandro(July 11,1869 – April 6, 1956)  was a Filipino physician and revolutionary leader. At the age of 23, he joined the society of Katipunan, a movement which sought the independence of the Philippines from Spanish colonial rule and started the Philippine Revolution.  Together with Andres Bonifacio and Emilio Jacinto, they formed the secret chamber of the society called Camara Reina. He took charge of the publication of Ang Kalayaan, Katipunan’s first and only official publication. He was the one who tried to convince the exiled Jose Rizal to join the revolutionary movement.  He was elected fiscal of the secret society in December 1895. He was inducted together with the other elected officials at Bonifacio’s home on New Year’s Day in 1896 . He used the nom de guerre “ Dimas Ayaran” (untouchable) in the movement.  Shortly after his induction, Valenzuela moved to San Nicolas district in Manila so he could supervise the publication of the secret society’s official organ, where he also wrote articles using the nom de plume “ Madlang – Away” (Public Conflict). Valuenzuela claimed in his memoirs that he was supposed to be the editor of publication but Emilio Jacinto would eventually be the one to supervise its printing.\n\n4.  Valuenzuela said he was the one who suggested the name Kalayaan (Freedom) for the publication. To mislead the Spanish authorities, he also suggested that they place the name of Marcelo H. del Pilar as editor and Yokohama, Japan as the place of publication.  Kalayaan's first number, dated January 18, 1896, came out in March 1896 and consisted of a thousand copies which was distributed to Katipunan members all over the country. However, the publication only came out with one more issue because the Katipunan had already been uncovered by the Spanish authorities. He considered the publication of Kalayaan as the most important accomplishment of the secret chamber of the Katipunan, which he claimed consisted of himself, Bonifacio and Jacinto.  In a meeting of the secret chamber in July 1896, they decided to assassinate the Spanish Augustinian friar who uncovered the Katipunan to the authorities, but they failed to accomplish the mission. Valenzuela also claimed that after the discovery of the Katipunan, he and Bonifacio distributed letters implicating wealthy Filipinos, who refused to extend financial assistance to the Katipunan\n\n5.  He was a member of the committee that was tasked to smuggle arms for the Katipunan from Japan. He was also with Bonifacio, Jacinto and Procopio Bonifacio when they organized the Katipunan council in Cavite.  At the secret general meeting called by Bonifacio on the night of May 1, 1896 at Barrio Ugong in Pasig, Valenzuela presented to the body a proposal to solicit contributions to buy arms and munitions from Japan. The proposal was approved on condition that it first be approved by José Rizal, who was in exile in Dapitan in Mindanao.  Valenzuela was tasked to discuss the matter with Rizal and he left for Dapitan on June 15, 1896. However, Rizal told him that the revolution should not be started until sufficient arms had been secured and the support of the wealthy Filipinos had been won over.  When the Katipunan was discovered, he fled to Balintawak on August 20, 1896, but he later availed of an amnesty that the Spanish colonial government offered and he surrendered on September 1, 1896.  He was deported to Spain where he was tried and imprisoned in Madrid. He was later transferred to Málaga, Barcelona and then to a Spanish outpost in Africa. He was incarcerated for about two years\n\n6. GUILLERMO R. MASANGKAY (1867-1963)  Friend and Adviser of Andres Bonifacio  A bosom friend of Andres Bonifacio, the founder of the Katipunan, Guillermo Masangkay who joined that underground society when he was only 17 –  was the Supremo’s personal counselor.  He was born on June 25, 1867 in Meisic, Tondo, Manila. His parents were Domingo  Masangkay of Batangas and Victoria Rafael of Tanza, Cavite. He was the youngest of four children.  Masangkay had no formal education. However, he had a strong intellectual drive. He read  assiduously books borrowed from his neighbors. Thus, although he was only a bangkero, or boatman, he became fluent in Spanish and deeply aware of the political and social conditions of his time.\n\n7.  He was plying his trade when he heard about a prominent young man in his neighborhood that he became friends with Bonifacio. As they got to know each other well, they found that they had the same patriotic aspirations. When Bonifacio founded the Katipunan on July 7, 1892 together with Ladislao Diwa and Teodoro Plata, he became one of its first members, along with Restituto Javier, Vicente Molina, Valentin Diaz, Briccio Pantas, Roman Basa, etc.  As his adviser, Bonifacio sought Masangkay for his approval in transforming the Katipunan into a revolutionary association. It was Masangkay whom he had designated to organize the Katipunan chapter in Cavite.  In August 1896, after the Katipunan was discovered, Masangkay joined Bonifacio, Emilio Jacinto, and others in a clandestine meeting held on the 24th of that month at Apolonio Samson’s house in Caloocan. Initially, the leaders of the movement quarreled over strategy and tactics, and many of its members questioned the wisdom of an open rebellion due to the lack of arms and logistical support. However, after Bonifacio’s intense and convincing speech, everyone destroyed their cedulas to symbolize their defiance of Mother Spain and, together, raised the cry of “Revolt.”\n\n8.  Masangkay was with Bonifacio in April 1896 at the Bernardo Carpio Cave on Mt. Tapusi, San Mateo, Rizal. It was the site originally chosen for the start of the uprising, not Balintawak. However, it was abandoned because of its remoteness from the town. Nonetheless, it was in there that Bonifacio, Masangkay, and Emilio Jacinto planned the attack in Manila. Newly appointed general, Masangkay was tasked by Bonifacio to lead one of the groups that assaulted the city .  As a revolutionary general, Masangkay figured prominently during the Filipino-American War. His competence was demonstrated in the memorable battle against the American forces on Zapote Bridge in Las Piñas Rizal. During the initial day of the 72-hour battle, Masangkay and his troops were winning. They eventually lost their advantage, however, to the superior arms of the enemy. Gravely injured in that battle, Masangkay was brought to San Juan de Dios Hospital for treatment. After being confined there for three days, Masangkay, dressed as a woman, surreptitiously left the hospital and went into hiding. With the restoration of peace, Masangkay returned home and was reunited with his wife, Romana Noriel of Cavite, and their 12 children. Since then, he also lived a simple life, attending to the growing family business and his children’s education.\n\n9.  When the government decided to erect Bonifacio’s monument, Masangkay strongly supported the project and donated P10, 000 from his own funds.  He died on May 30, 1963.  Guillermo R. Masangkay was one of the original members of the Katipunan. He was designated to build the KKK in Cavite. His accounts contribute to our understanding of the Cry of Balintawak and the death of Bonifacio. He was also a general in the Philippine-American War. He strongly supported the erection of the Bonifacio monument and contributed P10,000 of his personal money for the effort.\n\n10.  GUILLERMO MASANGKAY - On August 26th, a big meeting was held in Balintawak, at the house of Apolonio Samson, then cabeza of that barrio of Caloocan. Among those who attended, I remember, were Bonifacio, Emilio Jacinto, Aguedo del Rosario, Tomas Remigio, Briccio Pantas, Teodoro Plata, Pio Valenzuela, Enrique Pacheco, and Francisco Carreon. They were all leaders of the Katipunan and composed the board of directors of the organization. Delegates from Bulacan, Cabanatuan, Cavite, and Morong were also present. At about nine o'clock in the morning of August 26, the meeting was opened with Andres Bonifacio presiding and Emilio Jacinto acting as secretary.  The purpose was to discuss when the uprising was to take place. Teodoro Plata, Briccio Pantas, and Pio Valenzuela were all opposed to starting the revolution too early. Andres Bonifacio, sensing that he would lose the discussion then, left the session hall and talked to the people, who were waiting outside for the result of the meeting of the leaders.\n\n11.  He told the people that the leaders were arguing against starting the revolution early, and appealed to them in a fiery speech in which he said:\"You remember the fate of our countrymen who were shot in Bagumbayan. Should we return now to the towns, the Spaniards will only shoot us. Our organization has been discovered and we are all marked men. If we don't start the uprising, the Spaniards will get us anyway. What then, do you say?\" \"Revolt!\" the people shouted as one. Bonifacio then asked the people to give a pledge that they were to revolt. He told them that the sign of slavery of the Filipinos were (sic) the cedula tax charged each citizen. \"If it is true that you are ready to revolt... I want to see you destroy your cedulas. It will be a sign that all of us have declared our severance from the Spaniards.  The Cry of Balintawak occurred on August 26, 1896. The Cry, defined as that turning point when the Filipinos finally refused Spanish colonial dominion over the Philippine Islands. With tears in their eyes, the people as one man, pulled out their cedulas and tore them into pieces. It was the beginning of the formal declaration of the separation from Spanish rule.\"Long Live the Philippine Republic!\", the cry of the people. An article from The Sunday Tribune Magazine on August 21, 1932 featured the statements of the eyewitness account by Katipunan General Guillermo Masangkay, \"A Katipunero Speaks\". Masangkay recounts the \"Cry of Balintawak\", stating that on August 26,1896, a big meeting was held in Balintawak at the house of Apolonio Samson, then the cabeza of that barrio of Caloocan.\n\n12.  At about nine o'clock in the morning of August 26, the meeting was opened with Andres Bonifacio presiding and Emilio Jacinto acting as Secretary. In August 1896, after the Katipunan was discovered, Masangkay joined Bonifacio, Emilio Jacinto, and others in a clandestine meeting held on the 26th of that month at Apolonio Samson’s house in Caloocan. Initially, the leaders of the movement quarreled over strategy and tactics, and many of its members questioned the wisdom of an open rebellion due to the lack of arms and logistical support. However, after Bonifacio’s intense and convincing speech, everyone destroyed their cedulas to symbolize their defiance towards Spain and, together, raised the cry of “Revolt“  PIO VALENZUELA In 1935, Pio Valenzuela, along with Briccio Pantas and Enrique Pacheco said (in English translation) \"The first Cry of the revolution did not happen in Balintawak where the monument is, but in a place called Pugad Lawin.\" In 1940, a research team of a forerunner of the National Historical Institute (NHI) which included Valenzuela, identified the location as part of sitio Gulod, Banlat, Kalookan City. IN 1964, the NHI described this location as the house of Tandang Sora.[8] The first place of refuge of Andres Bonifacio, Emilio Jacinto, Procopio, Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Aguedo del Rosario, and myself was Balintawak, the first five arriving there on August 19, and I on\n\n13.  August 20, 1896. The first place where some 500 members of the Katipunan met on August 22, 1896, was the house and yard of Apolonio Samson at Kangkong. Aside from the persons mentioned above, among those who were there were Briccio Pantas, Alejandro Santiago, Ramon Bernardo, Apolonio Samson, and others. Here, views were only exchanged, and no resolution was debated or adopted. It was at Pugad Lawin, the house, store-house, and yard of Juan Ramos, son of Melchora Aquino, where over 1,000 members of the Katipunan met and carried out considerable debate and discussion on August 23, 1896. The discussion was on whether or not the revolution against the Spanish government should be started on August 29, 1896. After the tumultuous meeting, many of those present tore their cedula certificates and shouted \"Long live the Philippines! Long live the Philippines!\""
