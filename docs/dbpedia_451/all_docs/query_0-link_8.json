        "text": "Haring Bayang Katagalugan\n\nVerse 1\n\nMoments before his execution on December 30, 1896, by a squad of Filipino soldiers of the Spanish Army, a backup force of regular Spanish Army troops stood ready to shoot the executioners should they fail to obey orders. The Spanish Army Surgeon General requested to take his pulse: it was normal. Aware of this the sergeant commanding the backup force hushed his men to silence when they began raising \"vivas\" with the highly partisan crowd of Peninsular and Mestizo Spaniards. His last words were those of Jesus Christ: \"consummatum est\", – it is finished.\n\nHe was secretly buried in Pacò Cemetery in Manila with no identification on his grave. His sister Narcisa toured all possible gravesites and found freshly turned earth at the cemetery with guards posted at the gate. Assuming this could be the most likely spot, there never having any ground burials, she made a gift to the caretaker to mark the site \"RPJ\", Rizal's initials in reverse.\n\nHis undated poem Mi último adiós, believed to have been written a few days before his execution, was hidden in an alcohol stove, which was later handed to his family with his few remaining possessions, including the final letters and his last bequests. During their visit, Rizal reminded his sisters in English, \"There is something inside it\", referring to the alcohol stove given by the Pardo de Taveras which was to be returned after his execution, thereby emphasizing the importance of the poem. This instruction was followed by another, \"Look in my shoes\", in which another item was secreted. Exhumation of his remains in August 1898, under American rule, revealed he had been uncoffined, his burial not on sanctified ground granted the 'confessed' faithful, and whatever was in his shoes had disintegrated. And now he is buried in Rizal Monument in Manila.\n\nIn his letter to his family he wrote: \"Treat our aged parents as you would wish to be treated...Love them greatly in memory of me...December 30, 1896.\" He gave his family instructions for his burial: \"Bury me in the ground. Place a stone and a cross over it. My name, the date of my birth and of my death. Nothing more. If later you wish to surround my grave with a fence, you can do it. No anniversaries.\"\n\nIn his final letter, to Blumentritt – Tomorrow at 7, I shall be shot; but I am innocent of the crime of rebellion. I am going to die with a tranquil conscience. Rizal is believed to be the first Filipino revolutionary whose death is attributed entirely to his work as a writer; and through dissent and civil disobedience enabled him to successfully destroy Spain's moral primacy to rule. He also bequeathed a book personally bound by him in Dapitan to his 'best and dearest friend.' When Blumentritt received it in his hometown Litoměřice (Leitmeritz) he broke down and wept.\n\nBonifacio would learn that Aguinaldo is a spy of the Spanish and decided to get rid of him and have him executed.\n\nVerse 2\n\nThe Spanish–American War was fought between the United States and Spain in 1898. Hostilities began in the aftermath of the internal explosion of the USS Maine in Havana Harbor in Cuba, leading to US intervention in the Cuban War of Independence. American acquisition of Spain's Pacific possessions led to its involvement in the Philippine Revolution.\n\nThe main issue was Cuban independence. Revolts had been occurring for some years in Cuba against Spanish rule. The US later backed both the Philippine and Cuban revolt upon entering the Spanish–American War. There had been war scares before, as in the Virginius Affair in 1873, but in the late 1890s, US public opinion was agitated by anti-Spanish propaganda led by newspaper publishers such as Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst which used yellow journalism to call for war. The business community across the United States had just recovered from a deep depression and feared that a war would reverse the gains. It lobbied vigorously against going to war.\n\nThe United States Navy armoured cruiser USS Maine had mysteriously sunk in Havana Harbor; political pressures from the Democratic Party pushed the administration of Republican President William McKinley into a war that he had wished to avoid.\n\nPresident McKinley signed a joint Congressional resolution demanding Spanish withdrawal and authorizing the President to use military force to help Cuba gain independence on April 20, 1898. In response, Spain severed diplomatic relations with the United States on April 21. On the same day, the US Navy began a blockade of Cuba. On April 23, Spain stated that it would declare war if the US forces invaded its territory. On April 25, Congress declared that a state of war between the US and Spain had de facto existed since April 21, the day the blockade of Cuba had begun. The United States sent an ultimatum to Spain demanding that it surrender control of Cuba, but due to Spain not replying soon enough, the United States assumed Spain had ignored the ultimatum and continued to occupy Cuba.\n\nThe ten-week war was fought in both the Caribbean and the Pacific. As the American agitators for war well knew, US naval power proved decisive, allowing expeditionary forces to disembark in Cuba against a Spanish garrison already facing nationwide Cuban insurgent attacks and further wasted by yellow fever. American, Cuban, and Philippine forces obtained the surrender of Santiago de Cuba and Manila despite the good performance of some Spanish infantry units and fierce fighting for positions such as San Juan Hill. Madrid sued for peace after two obsolete Spanish squadrons sunk in Santiago de Cuba and Manila Bay and a third, more modern fleet was recalled home to protect the Spanish coasts.\n\nThe result was the 1898 Treaty of Paris, negotiated on terms favorable to the US which allowed it temporary control of Cuba and Luzon and ceded ownership of Puerto Rico and Guam.\n\nDue to the Spanish losing control of Luzon to the revolution of Katipunan the Spanish would give away the island for free and focused on regaining its territories in Visayas and Mindanao which are lost in the splintered revolutionary republics the Spanish would still have some areas they held in Iloilo which they would use against the Visayan and Mindanao republics.\n\nIf you want an idea what will the Philippines look like after this version of Fil-Am war.\n\nhttps://www.deviantart.com/toixstory/art/The-Philippine-Rainbow-Commission-579536187\n\nVerse 3\n\nWhen the Americans gained the rights to the Island of Luzon or Saludong, the Magdiwang faction and the General Government’s military who are said to be genocidal would start the expulsion of the Peninsulares from the Republic of Katagalugan and the Americans would make the Tagalog republic as a protectorate of the United States.\n\nSome of the Peninsulares would go to Manila where the Americans live, however some of the others would go the areas still controlled by the Spanish in the South, the Magdiwang faction the rest of the populace of the Tagalog republic would treat Kapampangans in Macabebe and Ilocanos with contempt and the rest of the population hating them due to allying with the Spanish in the past revolts[1] and this would get worse and also the Katipuneros or the government of the Tagalog Republic would gradually remove the Spanish influence in Saludong.\n\nA revolutionary group, the Comite Conspirador (lit. Conspirator's Committee), was organized in the town of Molo in Panay island in March 1898. The group, which planned an uprising against the Spanish colonial government, regularly held meetings at the residence of Francisco Villanueva. The organization later became the Comite Central Revolucionario de Visayas as support for the group grew. They commenced a revolution in Panay in August 1898 and established a temporary revolutionary government on November 1898, which would later be known as the Provisional Government of the District of Visayas. The rebels were led by Col. Adriano Hernandez.\n\nThe Spanish–American War which sparked in Cuba reached the Philippines. On May 1, 1898, US Commodore George Dewey defeated the Spanish Navy in Manila. The Spanish designated Iloilo City as the colonial government's capital after Manila fell to the Americans on August 13, 1898, and later installed Roque Lopez as president of the provisional government in Santa Barbara town in Iloilo. Diego de los Ríos was named Governor General over the Philippines. The Spanish armed the Iloilo Voluntarios, a battalion composed mainly of Ilonggos believing that they are loyal to the Spanish crown. However, Ilonggo revolutionaries, calling themselves the \"Ejercito Libertador\", started a revolt gaining control of all of Panay within days, except for Iloilo City, Jaro, La Paz and Molo.\n\nThe Spanish would pacify the rebellions in Visayas with the help of the Americans who had gained Luzon in the treaty of Paris.\n\n1. Think of the Rohingya situation in Burma for a similar situation."
