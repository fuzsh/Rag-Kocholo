        "text": "The exploratory-descriptive study tries to show that the two languages of the Philippine bilingual educational system--two languages-in-progress--are heading to a convergence as it proves empirically that Filipino is no different from and is contributing to the expansion, development, and evolution of Philippine English as both are codified in the standard lexicons of the two languages. The paper identifies the features exhibited by and the word-formation processes involved in the new words from Sawikaan's Words of the Year winners that were entered in the University of the Philippines' Diksiyunaryong Filipino (2010) and are at the same time standard words in the Oxford Dictionary of World English Online (2010). An initial result and contribution of the study to this field of research is a table of the most prevalent features of Philippine English in Filipino words using Bautista & Gonzalez (1992) and Borlongan (2007) vis-a-vis the most popular word-formation processes in Filipino-Philippine English based on Zorc (1996), Abello (2002), Reyes-Otero (2002), and KWF (2004).\n\nFilipino, the national lingua franca of the Philippines, is perceived as the Metro Manila Tagalog which has pervaded the entire country through media, local movies, and educational institutions. There are, however, emerging varieties of Filipino which deviate from the grammatical properties of Tagalog. These are influenced by non-Tagalog speakers whose native language competencies interfere with their usage of Filipino. These deviations from Tagalog are undeniably distinctive and are used by a significant segment of the non-Tagalog population in the country. The Filipino Variety of Davao City (FVD) is a case in point. Using as data actual language use –by people in the street and on cyberspace, this paper shows the indigenization of Filipino through linguistic description of FVD - its features, morphosyntax, and innovations and how they deviate from those of Tagalog. The indigenization of Filipino, an emergent phenomenon in the Philippine linguistic landscape, empowers non-Tagalog Filipino speakers to actively participate in its evolution, and to bring about the de-Tagalization of the evolving national language.\n\nThe Philippines suffers an enduring linguistic problem that is not identified as such. Through the 20th century the goal has been to study a foreign language hoping for economical competitiveness in an Asian context. At present, this very context has revealed the fallacy of abandoning the education of the citizens in its own setting, if not pointed out the problem—Diglossia. By using an alien means of communication in the schools, the whole education has been alienated, and the result is a society that does not know their history (in Spanish), much less have a future other than to be manpower in a capitalist market (in English). Highlighting the experience of the multilingual European Union, the paper explains a model for the Philippine setting in the context of the “House Bill 162: The Multilingual Education and Literacy Act of 2010.”\n\nThis paper investigates on the problems arising within the intellectualization of the Filipino language. The implementation of this process has begun when the 1987 Constitution and several other policies were passed in order to support the growth and strengthen Filipino. Despite the decades that have gone by, the Filipino language is still constantly being shaped into an intellectualized language. Since the English languages continues to be the only intellectualized language used in the Philippines to date, this has motivated the objective of this paper to investigate on the issues that the process of implementation is facing specifically in the academic domain. Furthermore, this paper focuses on the common problems faced by private and public school students regarding intellectualization. The methodology in this paper makes use of both quantitative, and qualitative data. An online survey and focus group discussions regarding the topic were organized and answered by students. The responses of the participants were then analyzed through categorization. The following categories used were Attitude, Educational System Government and Policy, 4. Misconceptions, and Regionalism. The results of the study showed that there are a number of interconnected problems that arise in the implementation of the intellectualization of Filipino not only in the academic domain, but in other domains as well.\n\nHow should national societies build legitimate and inclusive collective identities amidst prolific multiculturalism and linguistic diversity? We argue that cultural ownership of particular ways of framing ethics should be part of this collective identity building process. We should avoid unfair domination of minority cultural identities, but how do we do this when ethical discourses themselves tend to be shaped by particular dominant identities? We look into the case of the challenges that a particular multicultural society, the Philippines, faces in its ongoing collective identity building project on three levels: (1) ethnic and linguistic differences (e.g. differences between Tagalog, Cebuano, Maranao, etc.), (2) the historical layers of foreign culture (e.g. Islamic, Spanish, and American) that have each influenced these distinct cultural identities in different degrees, and (3) the apparent domination of Tagalog linguistic culture over others. Our answer to the question of legitimate and inclusive collective identity comes from an inter-linguistic dialogue that can be effected between cultures by harnessing similarities of ethical concepts, without compromising cultural differences. We present three different possible approaches under the following headings: (1) Pilipino ethics, (2) Filipino ethics and (3) Philippine ethics, each representing a particular stance to the dominant Tagalog linguistic culture. We argue for the third option, which is the most inclusive because of how it equalizes the status of all participating cultures in the dialogue. We also draw from the possibilities afforded by the phenomena of Scandinavian semicommunication (Haugen 1966) and what this practice offers in making collective identity building more inclusive.\n\nThis study tackles the development of writing Filipino dictionaries by presenting critical review analyses of the three of the most current Filipino monolingual dictionaries published by the two most authoritative institutions of Filipino language: the Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino [KWF] (formerly the Institute of National Language, then became the Linangan ng Wika sa Pilipinas [LWP]), and the Sentro ng Wikang Filipino (SWF). The oldest of the three is the first edition of KWF's (then LWP's) Diksyunaryo ng Wikang Filipino (1989). The second is the centennial edition of the same dictionary (1998), still published by the KWF. And the last is the UP Diksyonaryong Filipino (2001), published by the SWF. The study primarily aims to provide a preliminary discussion of the development of monolingual lexicography of Filipino. The examination of these dictionaries is done by applying lexicographic principles in writing monolingual dictionaries. This study found several errors in the writing of these dictionaries and concludes that such errors were primarily due to the lack of substantial corpus collection.\n\nLanguage is connected with many sides of social-economic, political, cultural and everyday (private) life of society in any country. In this connection the study of language situation and language policy seems to be highly relevant not only from purely linguistic point of view, but from social-political one as well, because it helps to analyze more deeply and sometimes to look anew to one or another process in the society. Particularly fruitful is to undertake a benchmark analysis of these processes in the dynamic developing Nusantara countries (insular South-East Asia), which are distinguished by the multi-national composition and are rather dense, though not equally populated: 202.5 millions of Indonesians are placed on area of nearly 2 000 thousand km2 (nearly 80 percent of the islands are populated) (Indonesia 1997:16), 80 millions Filipinos - on the territory of 300 thousand km2 (95 percent accounts for 11 most large islands of the Philippine archipelago), 17,6 millions Malaysians occupy nearly 333 thousand km2 (Information 1997: 64). Singapore here is an exception, because its population is nearly 3 millions persons and the area of the island does not exceed 700 km2 (Census 1991: 17). However with all external similarities between these countries language situation in each of it has its own particularities, and language policy has some similar and some different features.\n\nThe present thesis aimed to explore the possibilities of using Davao Filipino, the variety of Filipino spoken in the Mindanao areas of Kidapawan and Davao, as a literary medium, and of the implications to using it in this manner. Specifically, it aimed to determine: how DF could be linguistically described; how DF can be used as a literary language; and in what communicative contexts, as replicated in fiction and plays, DF can be used. The discussion of existing literature relating to the subject medium, the production of literary works, and the discussion of these same works provide answers to these questions. It was determined that Davao Filipino is the result of the linguistic diversity in Mindanao and serves as a potent tool for the de-Tagalization of Filipino. Furthermore, it was defined as the Tagalog based inadvertent language contact spoken on a first language basis in Davao and Kidapawan, and features borrowings that are predictable. It was further determined that writing in DF presents both difficulties and advantages: the fact that it is a primarily spoken medium means there is a need to grow more accustomed to using it in writing, but the variety’s nature as language contact provided for elegant variation and terminological precision, allowed for preservation of idiom and figure of speech authentic to the locale, and its colloquial origins allow for free indirect speech in third person narration. The expressive limitations of DF’s colloquial origins could also be taken advantage of in first person narration, stream of consciousness, and in dialogue. Its social implications, vis-à-vis the other languages—and other forms of language contact—spoken in its locale can also be used to authentically represent social backgrounds. Translating in DF—particularly for third person limited narration—made the narration more intimate because of DF’s predominant usage in speech. Moreover, DF could be used in a wide array of communicative contexts, ranging from casual conversations, to expressions of fear, love, and hatred. Its usage as a third person omniscient narration medium or as medium for stage instructions was not impossible, although this study pointed out the novelty in such usages. But its usage in formal public speaking contexts was observed to be problematic owing to the conventions of that field, which favoured the standard Tagalog. Five short stories and seven plays written by the researcher are included in the study."
