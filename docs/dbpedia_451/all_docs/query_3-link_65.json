        "text": "The author contends that Bonifacio was an ilustrado or an intellectual, that he translated the poem when he was in Cavite, and that he deliberately mistranslated Rizal’s Mi ultimo adios for agitational purposes. Bonifacio used the awit form in his translation since it was the popular form at the time. He was aware of the significance of bringing to the masses a revolutionary framework for them to realize there was a way out of their misery.\n\nThe author interprets Honorio Lopez’s work as a case of mythologizing a historical figure for the Filipino masses. It is therefore a protelarian myth in contrast to bourgeois myths which Roland Barthes talks about. Myth indeed is a language—a metalanguage—and Lopez made use of it to express the theme of emulation and the responsibility of the proletarian man through traits that endure in the Filipino psyche: his loob (inner self), budhi (conscience), hiya (shame), and sense of responsibility. The author agrees with Barthes that history and myth do not mix. Where a piece of work does not portray historical facts faithfully, it should not be taken as a historical document but—in the context of Lopez’s awit—a piece of literary work that must be enjoyed.\n\nThe glorious revolution that broke out in 1896 is a major highlight in our history. That revolution is the stepping stone in forming our nation and identity as a Filipino. Before the revolution, it is clear that there are systems that are applied in the secret society called Katipunan that has political foundations. Political accountability in the formation of an organized government in the society is essential in establishing good governance that led the Katipunan to its success in the revolution. It uses different studies and literature with regards to political accountability and relate it to the historical events happened inside the secret society of Katipunan. This paper will discuss the political accountability in the Katipunan as a foundation of the revolution of 1896 that resulted to the Philippine independence in 1898.\n\nA transoceanic comparative study of Caribbean modernista and Filipino propagandista essays and poetry written between 1880-1910, contextualized by Spain’s loss of its final colonies in 1898. The works studied show the development of a new, regional and national consciousness and reveal the authors’ responses to modernization, highlighting the political, cultural, social, and economic tensions of that time period aesthetically and socio-culturally. In the struggle for active participation in the production of knowledge and power, justice, and national identity, both Latin American and Filipino cultural and ideological production came from autonomous agents that confronted, negotiated, and initiated their own responses to the colonizing and modernizing projects."
