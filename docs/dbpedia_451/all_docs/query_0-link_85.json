The Philippine Revolution began in 1896 as a rebellion against Spanish colonial rule led by Andres Bonifacio and the secret organization Katipunan. As the revolution grew, Emilio Aguinaldo emerged as the leader of the revolutionary government. In 1898, the United States defeated Spain in the Spanish-American War, gaining control over Spanish colonies like the Philippines. This led to tensions between the Philippine revolutionaries and the United States, resulting in the Philippine-American War from 1899-1902, as the Philippines fought for independence from its new colonial ruler.",
