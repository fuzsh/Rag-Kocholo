        "text": "1. Background of the Author\n\nEmilio Jacinto (Kei Hojas)  (Spanish pronunciation: [eˈ Kei Hojaso];  15 December 1875 – 16 April 1899\n\n Was a Filipino General during the Philippine Revolution.  He was one of the highest-ranking officer in the Philippine Revolution and was one of the highest-ranking officers of the revolutionary society Kataas-taasan, Kagalang-galang na Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan, or simply and more popularly called Katipunan,  He was elected Secretary of State for the Haring Bayang Katagalugan, a revolutionary government established during the outbreak of hostilities.  He is popularly known in Philippine history textbooks as the Brains of the Katipunan  Some contend he should be rightfully recognized as the\n\n &quot;Brain of the Revolution&quot;  (Filipino: Utal ng Himagsikan, a title that is usually given to Apolinario Mabini).  Jacinto was present in the so-called Cry of Pugad Lawin (or Cry of Balintawak) with Andrés Bonifacio, the Supremo (Supreme President) of the Katipunan,\n\n2. Historical Background of the document\n\nThe KKK or The Kataastaasan, Kagalanggalangang, Katipunan ng mga anak ng bayan or Katipunan is arguably the most important organization formed in the Philippine history. The organization envisioned: A united Filipino nation that would revolt against the Spaniards. The total independence of the country from Spain. Previous armed revolts had already occurred beforenth foundation of the katipunan, but none of them envisioned a unified Filipino nation revolting against colonizers. For example:  Diego Silang was known as an Ilocano who took up his arms and led one of the strongest running revolts in country. His mainly concerned about is locality and referred to himself as El Rey de Ilocos (The King of Ilocos). The imagination was largely absent in the aspirations as the local revolt before the Katipunan.  The Propaganda movements led by the Illustrado like Marcelo H. Del Pilar, Graciano Lopez Jaena and Jose Rizal did not envision a total separation of the Philippines from Spain, but only wants is equal rights, representation, and protection from the abuses of the friars.\n\nThe Katipunan was a Philippine revolutionary society founded by anti-Spanish Filipinos in Manila in 1892, whose primary aim was to gain independence from Spain through revolution. The name Katipunan is actually a shorter version of the official name, which is in Tagalog: Kataastaasang, Kagalanggalangang Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan (translated as, Supreme and Venerable Society of the Sons of the People, Highest and Most Honorable Society of the Children of the Nation). The Katipunan is also known by its acronym, KKK. The word &quot;katipunan&quot;, literally meaning &#039;association&#039;, comes from the root word &quot;tipon&quot;, a Tagalog word, meaning &quot;society&quot; or &quot;gather together&quot;. Katipunan was a secret organization until its discovery in 1896 that led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.\n\n3. Content presentation and analysis of the important historical\n\ninformation found in the document.\n\nOn the night of July 7, 1892, Andrés Bonifacio, a member of the La Liga Filipina, founded the Katipunan in a house in Tondo, Manila. Bonifacio did establish the Katipunan when it was becoming apparent to anti-Spanish Filipinos that colonial authorities would suppress societies like the La Liga Filipina. The Katipunan was founded along Azcarraga St. (now Claro M. Recto Avenue) near Elcano St. in Tondo, Manila. The Katipunan had four aims, namely:  To develop a strong alliance with each and every Katipunero  To unite Filipinos into one solid nation;\n\n To win Philippine independence by means of an armed conflict (or revolution)  To establish a republic after independence.\n\nThe rise of the Katipunan signalled the end of the crusade to secure reforms from Spain by means of a peaceful campaign. The KKK members agreed on the following objectives: The political goal was to completely separate the Philippines from Spain after declaring the country’s independence. The moral goal was to teach the Filipinos good manners, cleanliness, hygiene, fine morals, and how to guard themselves against religious fanaticism. The civic goal was to encourage Filipinos to help themselves and to defend the poor oppressed.\n\nThe Katipunan was governed by the Supreme Council (Tagalog: Kataastaasang Sanggunian).The first Supreme Council of the Katipunan was formed around August 1892, a month after the founding of the society. The Supreme Council was headed by an elected president (Pangulo), followed by the secretary/secretaries (Kalihim); the treasurer (Tagaingat-yaman) and the fiscal (Tagausig). The Supreme Council also had its councilors (Kasanguni); the number varied through presidencies. To distinguish from presidents of lower sanggunian or councils (below) the president of the Supreme Council was called the Supreme President (Tagalog: Kataastaasang Pangulo; Spanish: Presidente Supremo). In each province where there were Katipunan members, a provincial council called Sangguniang Bayan was established and in each town was an organized popular council called Sangguniang Balangay. Each Balangay were given a chance to expand their own spheres of influence, through triangle system in order to elevate their status to Sangguniang Bayan. It was the original plan of Bonifacio to increase the membership of the Katipunan by means of sistemang patatsulok or triangle system. He formed his first triangle with his two comrades, Teodoro Plata and Ladislao Diwa. Each of them re-instituted Katipunan thoughts into another two new converts. A new system of initiation, modeled after the Masonic rites was then adopted.\n\nBonifacio divided the members into three grades. In the meeting of the society, Katipon wore a black hood with a triangle of white ribbon having the letters &quot;Z. Ll. B.&quot;, corresponding to the roman &quot;A.N.&quot;, meaning Anak ng Bayan (Son of the People). Kawal wore a green hood with a triangle having white lines and the letters &quot;Z. LL. B.&quot; at the three angles of the triangle, and also wore a green ribbon with a medal with the letter (ka) in Baybayin script above a depiction of a crossed sword and flag. The password was Gom-Bur-Za, taken from the names of the three martyrs. Bayani (Hero) wore a red mask and a sash with green borders, symbolizing\n\nincrease thy interest in her and she will remind thee of the mother who bore thee and reared thee. 12 thou dost not desire done unto thy wife, children, brother, and sister that do not unto the wife children, brother and sister neighbour. 13. Man is not worth more because he is a king, because his nose is aquiline, and his color white, not because he is a priest, a servant of God, norr because of the prerogative that he enjoys upon earth, but he is worth most who is a man of proven and real value, who does good, keeps his words, is worthy and honest; he who loves and cherishes his fatherland, though he be born in the wilderness and know no tongue but his own. 14 these rules of conduct shall be known to all, the longed for sun of Liberty shall rise brilliant over this most unhappy portion of the globe and rays shall diffuse everlasting joy among the confederated brethren of the same rays, the lives of those who have gone before, the fatigues and the well paid suffering will remain. If he who desires to enter has informed himself of all this and believes he will be able to perform what will be his duties, he may fill out the application for admission.\n\n4. Contribution and relevance of the document in the understanding\n\nthe grand narrative of Phil. History\n\nKnowing the sacrifices of the hero’s and their contribution on how we become independence and we get our freedom for our country. Knowing there is one way to give respect to them. The movement of Katipunan is a huge success for the Filipino’s because it is the symbol of the unity of the people of the Philippines. If they don’t wrote this documents or statement, todays generation wont know how the Filipino’s get their freedom this is the reason why the Katipunan has a huge. The grand narrative of the Philippines not only about how the Spaniards taken us but also the other countries. The grand narrative of the Philippines is about the history of the Filipino who fight our freedom and made a better future for the future generation.\n\n5. Learnings Experiences\n\nThe past discussion about the history of our country i realized why we cant be a better country, because of this what we called envy, because of envy we cant become a better country also because of crab mentality we have that set up of mind several years ago, that is not new to us if we know the truth and the truth only maybe the people know a days will be more aware and maybe we can change it but this generation they want to change but they don’t want to be change, we still in the cage of past, we are still living in the palm of other country, if don’t want to be change we cant stand to our own feet."
