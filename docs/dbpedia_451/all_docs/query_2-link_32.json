We invite you to check out a new website for travelers, expats and local residents of Taguig at:\n\nTaguig City\n\nFilipino or Tagalog?\n\nAlthough the terms \"Filipino\" and \"Tagalog\" are often used interchangeably, according to the 1987 constitution [1] the official language of the country of the Philippines is Filipino (and not Tagalog). Technically, Filipino is a language based on the Tagalog language with some (minor) changes. The government's official position on the language has changed over the years: In 1937 the official language was named to be the regional \"Tagalog\" language. In 1959 the language name was changed to \"Pilipino,\" to differentiate it from the regionally-focused \"Tagalog\" language. And then in 1973 and again in 1987 the language name was officially and finally changed to \"Filipino\" and included influences from other regional languages in the Philippines. You can read a more in depth History of the Filipino language on Wikipedia's article, here [2].\n\nGenerally, learners of the Filipino language will refer to it as \"Tagalog.\" On this website we use the terms interchangeably.\n\nReferences:\n\n^ The Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines.
