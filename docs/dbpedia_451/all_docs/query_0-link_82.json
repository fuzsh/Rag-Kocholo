        "text": "This composition attempts to review the historical and revolutionary films “Heneral Luna” (2015) and “Sakay” (1993) which featured two of the most important predicaments of Philippine history entrenched by Filipino revolutionaries who truly touched the desire to liberate the Philippines from the nascent invasion of the American imperialists in our country until we are completely under their rule. It takes us through an evocative and well-detailed account of General Antonio Luna’s stoical journey during the Philippine-American War in an attempt to find our true liberation even as he faced the challenge of crucifixion at the hands of our own compatriots as well as the struggle of General Macario Sakay towards the establishment of the Tagalog Republic only to become one of the last Filipino armed generals to surrender to American imperialism the remaining vestiges of our revolt.\n\nOn review of the two films mentioned in the title of this paper, the writer took the most important take-aways learned from watching the historical events represented by the producers and writers of these movies. American imperialism in the country has had a variety of effects on Philippine politics, economy, education, and even among the people. The division among the beliefs of many Filipino officials has led to an unwell system of betrayal among the Philippine government and its own Generals. Luna and Sakay for example have had the biggest advances when it comes to planning and bravery in their fight against the land takers. However, their principles in question have led not to the liberty they have aimed to get, but to the massacre that they have gotten not from their enemies but from the fellow Filipinos of themselves."
