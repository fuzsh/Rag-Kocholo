        "text": "Prologue\n\nApril 28, 1898\n\nManila\n\nAndres Bonifacio can't help but feel ecstatic. After almost two years of hardships and struggles, here he is, riding his horse while leading his people to freedom. Right at the opposite side of the Pasig River lies the walls of Intramuros, the lasting symbol of Spanish tyranny and oppression. They need to capture that fortress, tearing down its walls if needed, to finally liberate Manila once and for all.\n\nBreaking Bonifacio's train of thought is Emilio Jacinto, his most trusted subordinate, who brought him a letter from Malacañang: he's been elected as Vice-President of the Republic. This latest development added to El Supremo's resolve to end the reign of the Spaniards in his homeland.\n\nBy 5:00 am of the next day, Bonifacio give his commanders the order of the day - open the gates of Intramuros and raise the Filipino flag above the venerable fortress. Two hours later, cannons shots started to fill the atmosphere, officially starting the Siege of Intramuros. Under the fierce artillery barrage, Bonifacio rallied his comrades, as they attempt to cross Pasig River and storm the Spanish bastions. Personally raising the Red and White Sun flag, he raises the morale of the revolutionary troops. This is the day they're all looking forward to. The day they give the Colonial army a dose of their own medicine.\n\nBut before we go on, you may ask, how did it end up like this? Let's go back to where it all started: the forests of Pugad Lawin. This is a story of war, politics, struggle and victory. All in the name of freedom and motherland.\n\nHello. I am planning to do a timeline. It's about a different (and successful) Philippine Revolution, and a surviving First Republic (the Phil-Am War may or may not be butterflied), along with some... surprises. The POD is 1896.\n\nAny thoughts? Any suggestions?\n\nIn order for the 1896 to survive, the revolutionaries need to be financial capable of going head to head with Spain. It needs to be more organized and have more logistics than it had OTL. So a better diplomat to get more aid from Japan, Germany, UK or the USA will help. Since most of the illustrados have friends and closer to Japan or Germany, it will be most likely those nations.\n\nThe revolutionaries also need to be united and well led. I have nothing against Bonifacio nor Aguinaldo but Bonifacio never won a battle while Aguinaldo was subpar as a general versus the Spanish forces and generalship like General José de Lachambre. Antonio Luna would probably be a better general being European trained compared to Aguinaldo but Luna lacked the political guile, savy and connections of Aguinaldo.\n\nOn equal weaponry with Spain much like 1898 OTL, the Filipinos can win the 1896 revolt rather than losing it.\n\nErmiteño (Chavacano de Ermita) could be the lingua franca, while languages like Tagalog, Cebuano and Ilocano continue to flourish individually.\n\nThis is quite possible. Anything closest to Spanish is a possible lingua franca for the Philippine Islands.\n\nIn order for the 1896 to survive, the revolutionaries need to be financial capable of going head to head with Spain.

Anything closest to Spanish is a possible lingua franca for the Philippine Islands.\n\nIf Bonifacio is defeated, the revolution would lose support among the masses, it would be suicide and Aguinaldo and the Illustrado party were sell outs who wanted reform to begin with..what is the most likely is Philippines gets scrambled and divided up...but you can do anything with your timeline..\n\nErmiteño (Chavacano de Ermita) could be the lingua franca, while languages like Tagalog, Cebuano and Ilocano continue to flourish individually.\n\nFor me, Luzonians should have a different Linguafranca - I prefer Kapampangan as a linguafranca in that place because of historical reasons, I think without the Visayan immigration to Luzon it would have a fighting chance even if it still lags behind both Ilocano and Tagalog,during the 19th century it was the third most spoken language, the Visayan immigration to Luzon worsened the situation of Kapampangan from a widely used language to a moribund one because the Visayan migrants shifted to Tagalog further dilluting Kapampangan, before some people of Bulacan and northern metro manila even used Kapampangan in the 19th century even if those places were resettled by people from Southern Luzon - for me the best scenario is for Luzon is to be split from the Philippines.\n\nChapter 1\n\nFor more than 300 years, Spain held jurisdiction over the Philippine Islands. Their rule could be described as \"a man holding the cross at his right hand, the sword on the other\", with the cross symbolizing the Church, and the sword symbolizing the government. During the early years of colonial period, the Spanish ruled with an iron fist, exacting taxes and unpaid labor from the natives. Several uprisings occured here and then, but were easily crushed.\n\nBut that all changed in the 18th century, when Manila was opened to world trade. As overseas products and commodities began to arrive, so are the new ideas, particularly those from the Age of Enlightenment. Liberalism began to spread all over the archipelago. In the beginning of the 19th century, a new class of people began to emerge - the ilustrados. These intellectuals gave birth to the Propaganda Movement, which aims to curb the abuses of the colonial government, and to improve the standings of their fellow natives in the Spanish Empire. Unfortunately, the conservatism of the Spanish, coupled with the large influence of the clergy denied the movement any of crucial reforms. They instead began to suppress these intellectuals, now branded as filibusters, subversives and, worst of all, rebels.\n\nThe corrupted system of government prevailed until the last quarter of the 19th century. As many intellectuals lose hope for reforms, they began to turn into radical means. One example is Andres Bonifacio, a warehouse clerk. In 1892, together with fellow intellectuals Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa, Valentin Diaz and Deodato Arellano, Bonifacio founded the Katipunan. It is a secret organization with one aim: the independence of the Philippines from Spain through armed revolution. Many people from almost all walks of life joined the revolutionary movement. In the next four years, its membership rose from a few hundreds to hundreds of thousands.\n\nBut in mid-1896, as fate allowed it, the colonial authorities discovered Katipunan's existence. Mass arrest of suspected members occured. Bonifacio, acknowledging the increasing threat to the revolutionary movement's existence has decided enough is enough. It's time for war.\n\nIn August 23, 1896 Bonifacio assembled all the local leaders of Katipunan in Pugad Lawin. They officially form a revolutionary government, with him as the President of \"Sovereign Tagalog Nation\". Bonifacio then gives his first general order: a declaration of war against the Kingdom of Spain. All the Katipuneros present at the meeting tear down their cedulas (tax certificates), symbolizing their secession from the colonial rule. The Philippine Revolution has begun.\n\nBonifacio laid down his plan: it consist of a multi-front attack on Manila, converging on Intramuros. With the help of some double agents within the Spanish administration, the rebels succeeded in spreading misinformation about their movements, throwing the colonial troops into disarray. However, Geronimo Cristobal, a Spanish army corporal, expressed to Bonifacio his concerns about the Katipunan's capability to wage war. He suggested to Bonifacio to gather more firearms and give the soon-to-be insurgents basic training before starting an offensive, to which the latter agreed. Tito Miguel and Roman Ramos, employees from the Government Arsenal, volunteered to smuggle out weapons and ammunitions to be used by revolutionaries. The attack is set on the 29th.\n\nAfter sorting out the plans, Bonifacio and his comrades evacuated to a safer place in Mandaluyong, to avoid the hot pursuit of the Guardia Civil. The countdown to the Battle of Manila starts now. Bonifacio is hoping to get a decisive victory, or die trying. The next 6 days may decide the fate of the whole nation.\n\nChapter 2\n\nAugust 26, 1896\n\nA few days after the Cry of Pugad Lawin, Andres Bonifacio sent his representatives to different provinces of Luzon, in order to coordinate the upcoming uprising. The first shipment of smuggled weapons just arrived yesterday, and today Corporal Geronimo Cristobal starts to teach the rebels about using the rifle. The task is pretty difficult for the rebel officer, as teaching his fellow Katipuneros the art of war is like teaching a class of delinquent children how to write in Latin. There are instances of misfires and guns being broken apart, whether unintentional or not. But Cristobal repeatedly reminds himself that his task is crucial.\n\nAt Cavite, another hotspot for anti-government activities, Emilio Aguinaldo receives the letter from Bonifacio, urging them to join in attacking Manila. Citing lack of weapons, the Caviteño refused, but promised to commence the revolt in his own province later. Bonifacio is frustrated when he received the reply, but nonetheless understood. He even managed to divert some of the smuggled weapons to Cavite, to strengthen their brothers-in-arms.\n\nAugust 29, 1896\n\nThe day of the offensive has arrived. Although it should've been today, but Bonifacio was persuaded to postpone the planned assault to Manila for another day. The original plan had been modified, which now calls for a preliminary attacks in Mariquina, to capture the water supply facilities, and San Juan del Monte, where a powder magazine is located. Expecting the Spanish troops to be diverted to these places, Bonifacio is to lead his personal army to Manila proper as soon as possible. Meanwhile in Kawit, Aguinaldo plans to lead his forces in toppling the colonial authority in his hometown, before proceeding to Imus.\n\nAt 8:00 pm, the Katipuneros successfully attacks a Guardia Civil garrison in Pasig, then resumes the march to Mariquina, now encountering a handful of cazadores. The ensuing skirmishes last for less than 30 minutes before all Spanish troops surrendered to the numerically superior opponents. On the other hand in San Juan del Monte the insurgents faced strong opposition, but nonetheless succeeded in taking the powder magazine after more than an hour of brutal combat.\n\nAn hour later, Bonifacio and his men arrives at the outskirts of Manila. Disguised as traders, they scouted for enemy deployments, until they spotted large contingents of infantrymen, mostly Peninsulares, marching out of Intramuros. Assuming that these are reinforcing Mariquina & San Juan del Monte, Bonifacio instructs the rebel force to prepare for battle.\n\nBy 1:00 am the next day, the Katipuneros began its assault. With only a few troops left in the city , the revolutionaries successfully captured a majority of the city's suburbs, with most of it already rising in revolt.\n\nBonifacio personally led the advance to Intramuros expecting it to fall quickly, only to faced massive cannon shots and, surprisingly, several Spanish platoons waiting for them. It was a grave miscalculation on the part of the rebel leader. But nonetheless, he urged his compatriots to press on. But with the qualitative superiority of the Colonials, along with artillery support, the Katipuneros suffered heavily, with hundreds of casualties in the first wave of attacks. As the fight rages on, the situation is slowly becoming more and more dangerous to the Katipuneros. Bonifacio, slowly losing hope, had been fighting the urge to call a retreat before they face annhilation.\n\nBut an unexpected incident will decide the final outcome of the Battle of Manila."
