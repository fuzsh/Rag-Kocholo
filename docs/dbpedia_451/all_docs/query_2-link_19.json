Macario Sakay y de León was a Filipino revolutionary and president of the short-lived Tagalog Republic during the Philippine-American War. He was originally a member of the Katipunan movement and fought alongside Andres Bonifacio against Spanish rule. During the Philippine-American War, he continued resisting US occupation and in 1903 became president of the Tagalog Republic. However, the US did not recognize Sakay's government and labeled him an outlaw. In 1904, he established his own government called the Repúblika ng Katagalugan in opposition to US colonial rule. Sakay was eventually captured and executed by firing squad in 1906 on charges of bandolerism.",
