        "text": "Muscle analysis and quantitative parameters\n\nThe most straightforward quantitative measurements are the muscle area from a single slice or muscle volume from a stack of slices covering a whole muscle. These measurements require a prior segmentation. However, muscle segmentation is a difficult step, due to the low soft tissue contrast, especially at the trunk where muscles and surrounding organs have similar CT values. Therefore, the most simplistic segmentation approach is a manual outline of the muscles [23], [34], [40], an acceptable technique as long as the number of slices to be processed is small. The advantage of a manual segmentation is the use of expert knowledge to outline the muscle border, although different experts will never fully agree on a specific segmentation. However, when a larger stack of CT images needs to be segmented, as with spiral scanning, a more automated segmentation approach is required.\n\nMost of the literature on muscle segmentation is dedicated to MRI, whereas reports using CT are sparse [25], [27], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47]. In several clinical studies and research projects, commercially or publically available software tools such as Slice-O-Matic (http://www.tomovision.com/index.html), OsiriX (http://www.osirix-viewer.com), or ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) have been used. OsiriX and ImageJ do not provide dedicated muscle segmentation algorithms, but standard segmentation tools such as thresholding, contouring regions, or volumes of similar signal intensity that define muscle, fat, or organs in combination with morphological operations can be easily combined with corrective operator interaction. Three studies [48], [49], [50], in which the three software tools were compared, reported excellent agreement between paraspinal muscle of cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements of abdominal and paraspinal muscles, despite the use of a simple threshold or even fully manual segmentation.\n\nIn the thigh, usually first the outer margin, i.e., the skin, then the fascia, and finally the individual muscles within the fascia are successively segmented [25]. In the trunk, statistical shape or atlas-based approaches [41], [51] have been proposed to facilitate the segmentation of abdominal and paraspinal muscles, which is complicated by the presence of organs and visceral fat. Atlas-based approaches, which require prior training with a gold standard, seem to be the method of choice to separate individual muscles, for example, the quadratus lumborum, multifidus, and sacrospinalis within the paraspinal muscle group. Similar segmentation techniques have been suggested for the hip and thigh muscles [27].\n\nAnalysis of entire muscles requires scanning of a largevolume. However, most often, only a small range (several centimetres) of a muscle is scanned to reduce the radiation dose. In this case, area and volume measurements need to be normalized, for example, to the square of the body height [24], [39], [52], [53], to be representative regarding fatty infiltration assessment. The trunk muscle area at the L4-5 level or 5 cm above is highly correlated with the total body skeletal muscle volume (r2 > 0.8) [54]. In the appendicular skeleton, radiation exposure is much lower than that in the trunk and larger volumes can be scanned.\n\nThe assessment of the muscle density requires a calibration step but not necessarily muscle segmentation. Representative muscle density values may be obtained by geometrically defined volumes of interest (VOIs) placed in the muscle of interest such as a circle for a slice-based analysis or a sphere or cylinder for a volume-based analysis. A detailed overview of studies in which a geometrical VOI was used to determine the muscle density has been provided in Ref. [55]. So far, in the vast majority of studies measuring the muscle density, muscle was first segmented and the muscle area was obtained as a primary outcome.\n\nIt must be understood that the muscle density is not a physical density measured in mg/cm3, but a ‘CT density’ measured in Hounsfield units. The term muscle attenuation is used synonymously [56], but the term CT density will be used in the present contribution. By default, each CT scanner is calibrated to water:\n\nwhere μ is the linear absorption coefficient of the material under investigation, and μw is the attenuation coefficient of distilled water at room temperature. In a calibrated scanner, the CT numbers for water and air are 0 and -1000, respectively. For water-equivalent materials, i.e., for materials with comparable mass absorption coefficients such as muscle, CT values quantify percentage density differences to water. A CT value of 1 HU quantifies a density difference to water of 0.1%. The physical density of skeletal muscle, including IMCLs, is about 1.055 g/cm3 [57], [58], [59] compared with 1 g/cm3 for water. Thus, for a properly calibrated scanner, the CT value of skeletal muscle also termed as muscle tissue is about 50–60 HU. Published values of IMCL content in human skeletal muscle as measured by MRS are between 6% and 14% [60] compared with 2%–9% for chemical analysis [57] and 2%–5% for histochemical analysis [61]. Additional infiltration of extracellular lipids—or adipose tissue within muscle—will decrease the muscle density value below 50 HU.\n\nOwing to CT scanner instabilities, the water value often deviates from 0 HU. shows CT values measured in the European Spine Phantom (ESP), which was scanned on 41 scanner units. The ESP is a reference standard used in bone densitometry, in which soft tissue is made of a water-equivalent plastic. Each scan was acquired with the same phantom on a different CT scanner, and 17 different CT scanner models from four manufacturers were tested. All scanners were regularly calibrated according to the local hospital and manufacturer standard operating procedures. In the ESP, a cylindrical VOI positioned in the water-equivalent soft tissue region anterior to the vertebrae was analysed. In 15% of the scanner units (6 of 41), CT values differed by 5 or more HU from 0. In the thigh, a difference of 5 HU in the water value causes a 15% difference in the muscle density [25]. Thus, for accurate muscle density measurements the use of a calibration phantom should be considered. This phantom can either be scanned with the subject (simultaneous calibration). An example is shown in . Alternatively the phantom can be scanned before or after the patient (asynchronous calibration).\n\nCT values are used not only to determine the muscle density but also to segment muscle and adipose tissue. Furthermore, they play a central role in estimating the adipose tissue content within muscle. lists the published CT values used for these three different applications and the terminology used in the corresponding reference for muscle and adipose tissue parameters. It shows that even for a given application, for example, to determine the tissue composition, CT values vary significantly, which has also been noted in an earlier review [55]. One source of confusion in comparing CT values of muscle and adipose tissue among previous works is the great variability in terminology. For example, the term muscle is typically used to denote the organ muscle, which includes adipose tissue, whereas the term muscle tissue includes intramyocellular lipids (ICML) but excludes adipose tissue. Thus, the CT value of muscle will vary considerably depending on its adipose tissue content. Some authors, however, use muscle tissue synonymously with muscle [24]. CT values for muscle tissue are higher than those of muscle. Pure muscle and high-density muscle have been used to denote the muscle density in young healthy individuals [23], [25], although it can be speculated that some amount of intermuscular and intramuscular adipose tissue is present even in young healthy individuals, and therefore, that the term pure muscle may not be fully appropriate. However, the average muscle density of young people may serve as an upper fix point for muscle density calibration using CT. The terminology is even more diverse for fat/adipose tissue.\n\nDifferences in CT values shown in are probably not very relevant when used as thresholds for segmentation of muscle, subcutaneous, or visceral compartments. Automated techniques may use fixed thresholds to initiate the segmentation but are usually refined without using absolute thresholds. In semiautomatic procedures, initial threshold-based contours guide the operator and are corrected if required. In contrast to segmentation, differences in CT values have a much larger impact on the quantification of the adipose tissue content within a single muscle or within a muscle group contained by the perimuscular deep fascia such as the paraspinal muscles or the whole thigh muscles. Such an entity is often analysed as a whole to avoid a rather difficult segmentation of individual muscles. Therefore, the separation of intermuscular and intramuscular adipose tissue components is of interest. Obviously, the use of absolute thresholds is problematic. They are not consistent across the literature ( ) and do not take into account deviations from the ideal water calibration of the CT scanner. Therefore, some studies have suggested techniques based on in-scan calibration phantoms [29], [62], internal calibration [23], or both [25].\n\nFor a more detailed characterisation of the adipose tissue infiltration, a frequency analysis ( ) of the density values [23], [55] and of its spatial distribution has been suggested [25]. Based on the histogram of the CT values of the segmented muscle, five different bins were distinguished [23]: pure muscle, pure fat and voxels containing 25%, 50%, and 75% adipose tissue according to the muscle density, respectively. This is the quantitative analogue to the Goutallier score [63] used to qualitatively score fatty muscle degeneration.\n\nThe histogram analysis requires two values, one for pure adipose tissue and one for pure muscle. In Ref. [25], the value for adipose tissue was obtained by internal calibration based on the distribution of subcutaneous adipose tissue corrected for potential inclusion of water, oedema, and vessels. The value for pure muscle was obtained from a group of young active athletes. For each CT scan, this high-density muscle value was individually corrected for potential water calibration offsets using an in-scan calibration phantom [25]. If the CT scanner is stable, the in-scan calibration phantom can be replaced by asynchronous calibration, which means that phantom and subject scans are typically not performed at the same time [64].\n\nA further step is the quantification of the spatial distribution of adipose tissue infiltration and the characterisation of muscle structures termed as washed out or moth eaten ( ) in radiological scoring systems [65]. For this purpose, we have recently used a number of different descriptors that quantify the texture [25]. They can either be applied to the CT images directly or after image binarisation. While details are beyond the scope of this review, illustrates the principle, assuming four different muscle–fat compositions, where for simplicity, muscle in red has a value of 1 and fat in white has a value of 0, corresponding to a binary image. Texture parameters may help to better distinguish different structural patterns than CT density (or in case of the simplified simulation, relative volume)."
