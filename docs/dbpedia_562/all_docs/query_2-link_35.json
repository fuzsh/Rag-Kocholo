        "text": "Science was always an interest of mine and I knew that I wanted to spend my life making a difference. Initially I wanted to be a veterinarian, but I changed my mind because animals bite and are short on conversation! Instead, I decided a Doctor of Osteopathic medicine would be a better fit. I spent my medical school years in Iowa and traveled around the West Coast. After visiting Oregon one summer, my wife and I decided that this was the perfect place to raise our children and I’ve never looked back. Family medicine was the perfect match offering the diversity of ages and stages that fueled my passion for caring for people. I take care of families from birth to the end of life; often taking care of multigenerational families.\n\nI have always loved making a difference in peoples’ lives both by giving direction and by setting a good example of what a healthy lifestyle involves. I lead by example. I work out at the gym daily and often see my patients working out next to me. I rarely use prescription medications. I recommend the same for my patients and only prescribe medication when necessary.\n\nI value listening to my patients’ concerns and helping them find solutions to a healthier, happy life. As an alternative to prescription drugs, I suggest complementary medicine and approach everyone’s care in a holistic manner to find root causes. I give my patients the tools they need to succeed and encourage everyone to eat healthy meals and stay active.\n\nWhen my career began, I specialized in obstetric care and found delivering babies and caring for new mothers’ very rewarding. As life changed, my direction has also changed from new mothers and newborns to the opposite end of life’s spectrum. In my practice I am seeing a growing trend in an increase in people caring for their aging parents. My challenge is to try to ease the burden on these caretakers who watch helplessly as this difficult process unfolds and at the same time assist the person with declining health leave their physical body with dignity. I work to ease the burden and promote support by bringing family members together. I am working closely with hospice and will be helping to educate others about this time of life.\n\nFamily is important. I grew up in the hustle and bustle of the East Coast with family and extended family all around and listening to my grandmother’s favorite Yiddish phrases. We now have 5 children of our own who span a wide range of ages with the typical joys and challenges. My biggest joy is watching families grow and change."
