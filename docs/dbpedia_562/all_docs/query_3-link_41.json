        "text": "The maximum age to join the Army as an enlisted Soldier is 35, while Officers must accept their commission before age 31. However, the Army can lift some restrictions based on the need for certain roles to be filled. It’s possible to receive an age waiver, especially if you have prior military service. Talk to your recruiter to learn more.\n\nYou can have tattoos almost anywhere on your body, with a few exceptions. There are some limits to the size and number of tattoos on highly visible areas like the hands, neck, and behind the ears. Tattoos in the mouth, ears, or on the eyelids are not allowed. It’s possible to get a waiver in some instances. However, tattoos anywhere on your body that are extremist, racist, sexist, or otherwise indecent aren’t allowed, no exceptions. See all tattoo requirements in the hair and appearance guidelines.\n\nAsthma will only prevent you from joining if you were diagnosed with it after your 13th birthday. Hearing, vision, and asthma qualifications are usually determined by medical exams. You can still request an asthma, vision, or hearing loss waiver if a doctor denies your application.\n\nYes. It will only prevent you from joining the Army if you’ve been treated with ADD/ADHD medication within the last year, or if you display obvious signs of the condition.\n\nHeight and weight restrictions vary by age and gender. Check the height and weight chart to see if you’re within the requirements to join.\n\nMen (Ages 17 – 20)\n\nHeight: 58 – 80 in.\n\nWeight: 234 lb max\n\nWomen (Ages 17 – 20)\n\nHeight: 58 – 80 in.\n\nWeight: 119 – 227 lb.\n\nIf you enlist to become a Soldier and don’t meet the physical requirements at MEPS, you may be eligible for the fitness track of a program called the Future Soldier Preparatory Course. Over 90 days, Army health and fitness experts will help you meet the required body fat composition before you start Basic Training. Talk to a recruiter about program details and if it’s an option for you.\n\nFor both the enlisted Soldier and commissioned Officer paths, you’ll need to meet the height and weight requirements for your age and gender before joining. A recruiter will work with you after you join to meet the physical requirements of your chosen Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) or Army job.\n\nThe Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) evaluates your physical and mental abilities, starting at Basic Training for enlisted Soldiers and during initial training for those commissioning as Officers\n\nEveryone will need to pass the ACFT during training and again several times a year for every year of service. Scores are recorded twice a year for active duty Soldiers in the Army, or once a year for members of the Army Reserve and Army National Guard. The Army will be there to support your growth with resources during every step of the evaluation process to ensure your success\n\nYes, the Army understands that some circumstances can impact your ability to score well. A waiver can be requested in those situations.\n\nIf you want to improve your test score and have a minimum score of 21, the academic track of the Future Soldier Preparatory Course may be an option for you. This 90-day program provides training on all the subjects covered on the ASVAB, as well as opportunities to retake the test. Find out more about the ASVAB entrance test and work with a recruiter to see if this program is right for you.\n\nAlthough the Army wants people from all different backgrounds and experiences, all candidates must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident with a valid Green Card (officially known as a I-551 Permanent Resident Card).\n\nIf you already have a Green Card, serving in the Army can reduce the residency requirement for becoming a U.S. citizen to as little as one day instead of five years. The naturalization process for citizenship can begin as soon as your first day of Basic Training.\n\nThe Army has a waiver process that you can take advantage of to prove you overcame a disqualifying issue that would otherwise prevent you from joining the Army. After submitting a waiver, a review takes place to make sure you can join. If your waiver is denied, you can also look into pursuing a civilian career within the Army."
