        "text": "Women place fifth, men eighth in final team meet of the season\n\nBOZEMAN, Mont. â€” Miles Grant became the Big Sky champion in the high jump and was one of six all-conference performances for Sacramento State during the final day of the Big Sky Outdoor Championships on Saturday at Montana State. The Hornet women finished in fifth place with 68.5 points. The men's team was eighth with 54 points.\n\nNorthern Arizona repeated in the women's team standings, collecting 240.5 points to finish 66 points clear of second-place Montana State. The men's team competition came down to the final race and the host Bobcats were able to snap NAU's stranglehold on the conference. The Bobcats ran 3:07.98 to win the 4x400 while NAU was fifth. MSU's 10 points in the race game the team 186 to finish one point ahead of the Lumberjacks.\n\nMEN'S FIELD HIGHLIGHTS\n\nGrant continued his impressive season by winning for the third time in his last four meets. Additionally, he has finished in the top three in all but one meet this year. Grant entered the high jump with the bar at 6-05.50 and was successful on his first attempt at that height as well as 6-06.75, 6-08.00 and 6-09.00. The rest of the field was eliminated at 6-09.00 and Grant opted to move the bar to 7-01.00 which would have set his PR. However, he was unable to record a clearance at that height.\n\nHe becomes just the third Sacramento State male to win the high jump at the Big Sky Outdoor Championships, joining Emilio Hernandez (2009-11) and Daniel Onuoha (2016). Grant also won the Big Sky Indoor Championship this season to match Hernandez (2011) as the only Hornets to capture both titles in the same season.\n\nA day after scoring a point in the pole vault, John Gibbs finished in second place in the triple jump to add eight points to the team total. Gibbs matched his career best of 50-04.50 on his final attempt to move from fourth place to second. His distance ranks fifth in program history.\n\nFreshman Diego Lopez placed fifth in the hammer behind a career long throw of 194-08. Lopez moved into ninth place in the Hornet record book and recorded the longest throw by a Sacramento State athlete other than Evan Stork since 2019.\n\nWOMEN'S FIELD HIGHLIGHTS\n\nAs expected, the Hornets scored big points in the triple jump finishing with 13 points. Alexia Croffet finished in third place with a leap of 41-06.00 which had a wind reading of 3.1 meters per second. That measurement will count towards Croffet's quest to qualify for the NCAA First Round in a couple of weeks. Her triple jump of 41-02.25 had an allowable wind for school record purposes and moved her into sixth place in the record book.\n\nTamia Ramos finished in fifth place in the triple jump on Saturday with a long of 39-11.50. R'kai Davis set her PR of 39-10.75 to place sixth while Audrey McElmurry just missed out on points with a ninth-place effort of 39-05.25.\n\nBreanna Espinoza and Abby Meder each scored in the discus. Espizona used a long of 150-00 to finish in fifth place. Meder set her season best of 1443-10 to place seventh.\n\nAbby Sheets was sixth in the javelin at 133-01 to set her personal best.\n\nMEN'S TRACK HIGHLIGHTS\n\nZachary Winger was fourth in the 110-hurdles and fifth in the 400-hurdles for the top finishes by a Hornet male in the running events on Saturday. Winger followed his PR of 14.12 in the qualifying round of the 110H on Friday with a time of 14.24 on Saturday. He sett a career best in the 400H in 52.93.\n\nBrandon Moreno earned a point by placing eighth in the 800 in 1:54.80.\n\nThe 4x100 and 4x400 relay teams each set season bests and tallied points. The 4x100 team of Jalen Adams, Winger, Nathan Rider and Xavier Bruce ran 40.94 to place fifth.\n\nMalachi Cox, Khalil Fowlkes, Nautus Moore and Rider combined to complete the 4x400 in 3:13.86 to finish in sixth place.\n\nWOMEN'S TRACK HIGHLIGHTS\n\nAva Fitzgerald finished in second place in the 100-hurdles, was seventh in the 100 and was part of the 4x100 relay team which placed third. Fitzgerald started her day by running the second leg of the 4x100 and then quickly turned to the 100-hurdles where she topped her qualifying time and then-PR of 13.60 by .07 seconds. Her time of 13.53 in the finals improves her fourth-place standing in the school record book. She later added a 100 time of 12.27.\n\nFreshman Breija Stredic finished in second place in the 400-hurdles. Stredic ran 58.76 which was just a hundredth of a second off her qualifying time of 58.75 which moved her into third place in school history.\n\nJessi Barry contributed five points to the team total after finishing fourth in the 100 in 12.09. Barry was also part of the 4x100 relay.\n\nThe 4x100 relay team of Barry, Fitzgerald, Kassidy Schroth and Zoe Ewell ran 45.54 which is the second-fastest in school history, trailing only the mark of 45.13 set in 2019.\n\nThe 4x400 relay squad also set a season best in 3:45.73 to finish sixth. That unit was comprised of Stredic, Emily Giddens, Dominique Abbott and Mia Lawrence.\n\nBIG SKY OUTDOOR CHAMPIONSHIPS\n\nWomen's Team Scores: 1. Northern Arizona 240.5; 2. Montana State 134.5; 3.
