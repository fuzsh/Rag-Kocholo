        "text": "A normal resting heart rate can range anywhere from 40 to 100 beats per minute. Below is a chart relating resting heart rate and fitness level. As can be seen on this chart, your resting heart rate can vary with your fitness level and with age — the fitter you are, generally the lower the resting heart rate. This is due to the heart getting bigger and stronger with exercise, and getting more efficient at pumping blood around the body - so at rest more blood can be pumped around with each beat, therefore fewer beats per minute are required.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the functioning of your heart, you should consult a doctor who can examine you personally and give their expert opinion. Don't rely on comments and feedback here as medical advice.\n\nHeart Rate and Fitness Chart\n\nThese ratings provide only a generalization of you fitness and health, there are many other factors which may account for variations in heart rate such as medications, illness and stress. For a true measure of resting heart rate, it is important for the measurement to be taking accurately and under the best resting conditions. There is more information and instructions on how and when to measure resting heart rate. Fitness can also be assessed by measuring heart rate during exercise, which is a better measure of fitness. If you have any questions, you should check out the Resting Heart Rate FAQ.\n\nRelated Pages\n\nHow and when to measure resting heart rate\n\nAll about Heart Rate and Exercise\n\nMeasuring Heart Rate — how to measure using the manual and monitor methods.\n\nExercise Heart Rate — a measure of intensity and fitness\n\nMaximum Heart Rate — how high can you go?\n\nA discussion of What is a normal heart rate?\n\nHeart Rate Records, maximum and minimum.\n\nSee also the table of Heart Rate training ranges\n\nTable of maximum heart rate related to age.\n\nHeart Rate Monitors for sale, also ECG Monitors\n\nOld Comments\n\nCommenting is closed on this page, though you can read some previous comments below which may answer some of your questions.\n\nAndy (2013)\n\nI'm 19, quite tall (over 6 foot), less than 10% body fat, about 65kg and exercise regularly but my resting heart rate has always been 80bpm (below average). Anyone have any idea why my heart rate is so high all the time? I've been exercising more lately and it won't go down. I don't eat badly (my family eats the same stuff and their heart rates are all fine) so what gives? Am I dying?\n\nDaniel Garcia Andy (2013)\n\nHi Andy. How did you measure your resting heart rate?\n\nApril Mcginnes Daniel Garcia (2016)\n\nYou measure your resting heart rate when you first wake in the morning I use and app on my iPhone :)\n\nBenjamin April Mcginnes (2017)\n\nThat's not true. Your HR will be considerably lower when asleep than \"at rest\" but your sympathetic drive increases during waking and so you will be measuring a depressed but rising HR first thing in the morning upon waking. \"At rest\" means not active (and have not been active immediately prior to taking the reading.\n\nVince Davies Benjamin (2017)\n\nHi. I am 55 and have a resting heart rate between 45-48 bpm,but I have done sport most of my life and am in the middle of doing insanity for the third time,my view is as you get older it's more important to look after your heart,vince\n\nChristine bishop Vince Davies (2017)\n\nI'm 63 and I just checked my heart rate with one these fit bit at 7clock night and my heart rate was 60rbm is that normal cos my daughter 29 and her is 76rbm\n\nJonathan Bailey Christine bishop (2018)\n\nTry counting it instead of relying on those inaccurate devices.\n\nErik Nilsson Jonathan Bailey (2018)\n\nEh, many of those devices are quite accurate for resting heart rates... Yes, when you move around and exercise it becomes increasingly inaccurate but they are plenty good for resting heart rates.\n\nBertie Shennan April Mcginnes (2020)\n\nDoesn't work for me; my heart rate is always faster on waking but calms down later, around 3pm is my realistic RHR measurement time.\n\nJess Andy (2013)\n\nThis may just be because you are so tall. If you think about your body as a system of pipes, the more pipes in the system, the harder the heart has to pump to push the blood around. To move all of your blood around your body(given your height) your heart is likely to either pump faster or pump harder. The fitter you become the stronger your heart will get but still given the distance that your blood has to travel, your heart rate may still be slightly higher on average than other people who aren't quite so tall.\n\nEvan Jess (2013)\n\nI'm 18 6'2 ish 187lbs and my RHR is 50 it was tested 3 times with the same result by a diet expert that my university has paid for to get my diet establish(I'm a scholarship lacrosse player) i do have lab coat syndrome and i experience anxiety at the office but I would consider a visit because that seems high especially if you're slim\n\nDavid Sellers Jess (2018)\n\nIncorrect. I am 6'6 and a half inch tall 265 pound male. My resting heart rate is about 45 in the morning (the correct time to measure) being a large person wouldn't make you need a higher heart rate. Your body grows proportionate to itself and it's size. I have more pipes but I probably have a larger heart as well that is used to pumping for my sized body.\n\nSmokingjacket David Sellers (2018)\n\nI agree. I'm 6,4, 47 year old male and my HR is 55.\n\nMs609 Jess (2018)\n\nThis is a nice intuition, but actually the maths ends up slightly differently. Heart rate in mammals scales inversely with body size: a mouse's heart beats around 500 times per minute, whereas a whale's beats at around 10 bpm. This in part accounts for the fact that women (who are typically smaller) tend to have higher heartbeats than men.\n\nCannondale Andy (2013)\n\nI'm an active 42 year old male who is 6 foot 8 inches tall and weighs 105kg my resting heart rate is 44 which is good but we are all different and I wouldn't worry too much about yours.\n\nInstead eat well train sensibly get your rest and listen to your body look after your back and knees and you'll have a long and active life.\n\nManzapip Cannondale (2013)\n\nI am 49, very athletic and eat very well. I drink wine very minimal. For some reason, I had high blood pressure after returning to the states. I was in the gym and felt nervous/dizzy, sweaty. My BP was high at the dr. He just prescribed 20mg Benicar. It's my 2nd day and my BP is 124/70 with a resting rate of 75. I ok so far, just a little dizzy and weird from the medication which is normal for a week or two. What do you think?\n\nGlenda Martin Manzapip (2017)\n\nLook at the horrible side effects of Benicar. If you have leg cramps,swelling in fingers,toes and/or legs,or have issues with loose bowels.....it's Benicar. They should take this off the market. Almost killed my husband. He went from 260 to 124 in 5 months. Could hardly move around because of weakness. Which caused him to get two blood clots. One went to his lungs. He spent 6 weeks in Baylor hospital. They found out what was causing it....Benicar. It was terrible. Tell everyone you know.\n\nRos Byrne Andy (2013)\n\nWhen are you testing your heart rate? It should be as soon as you wake in the morning.\n\nManzapip Ros Byrne (2013)\n\nWhat is the significance of checking the heart rate in the morning, please?\n\nHarj Manzapip (2013)\n\nyou are just coming out of a resting state, so your heart rate is generally at its lowest, later in the day movement and general activity means you are no longer in a stable resting state\n\nDooda Loc harj (2016)\n\nThat advice is so wrong. Upon waking adrenaline is released which actually raises BP and BPM slightly.\n\nGub Dooda Loc (2017)\n\nMine is consistently at its lowest when I first wake up, but more importantly it is the most consistent time of day to take heart rate as digestion, temperature changes, other movement, etc. throughout the day have various effects.\n\nNordlys harj (2014)\n\nMine is always high in the morning. My mum is the same. it slows down during the morning, and it stays low all day (except when I move or when I do physical activities).\n\nMy hearth rate is always at lowest when I read, when I'm sitting and doing things I like or when I go to sleep.\n\nJoel Blaeser Nordlys (2017)\n\nyou have sleep issues if you awake and it is high, i suggest getting a sleep test at sleep lab pronto\n\nRoboticus Aquarius Nordlys (2015)\n\nHuh, mine is always lowest in the morning... about 45 +/-5. It picks up during the day as I get active.\n\nOtisGumbo harj (2018)\n\nWhen I wake up, my blood pressure is slightly elevated, same with my heart rate. It's called \"waking up,\" not \"going to sleep.\" Resting Heart Rate is not the same as Waking Heart Rate.\n\nJanice - Salads 4 Lunch Andy (2013)\n\nYou could be overtraining.\n\nOlivia Andy (2014)\n\nHi Andy, I don't know if you will ever see this, but it could be possible that you have a hormonal imbalance such as hyperthyroid, you may want to talk with your doctor about having a your hormone levels checked. Hope this helps, Olivia\n\nSai rohit Andy (2017)\n\nHii Andy\n\nI'm Rohit I'm 18 years now\n\nI have 3 more than you\n\n83 bpm which is poor\n\nIs it unfair\n\nPlease help me what to do..\n\nAnd how are you\n\nHa ha haaa\n\nLobo Sai rohit (2017)\n\nRohit. It could be anxiety of getting your BP tested. You need to test it when you're completely relaxed\n\nSai rohit lobo (2017)\n\nOK i will get checked\n\nManzapip Andy (2013)\n\nAndy; Go out to a Walgreens Pharmacy or CVS and get a digital blood pressure wrist machine. They cost about $80 and you will have it for a long time. Take your BP and then it will have your resting heart rate. Relax, sit down for 5 minutes and follow the instructions to a tee! Then, after the results, look up on the net under Blood Pressure Chart. Last, go to your doctor and get a physical just to be safe! Compare notes and see what he/she tells you! You should be ok!\n\nMatÄj MikeÅ¡ Andy (2017)\n\nAndy. Exercising doesn't mean you have a great conditioning. Actually, exercising is probably the easiest method of workout. Ask yourself this. Did you really ever wanted to throw up after exercise? I doubt it, unless you did some heavy compound lifts while being out of shape. Now try to do interval 6x800m sprints with only 1 minute rest between each. Or 15x100m hill sprints with 1 minute rest between each. Way harder isn't it? Well, these kind of hard trainings athletes with great cardiovascular system do. You have simply never reached that level and your HR is so high because you simply don't have good conditioning. I doubt you will answer or see this, since it's already been 4 years. But this is answer to anyone who is curious about the same thing as you.\n\nRandall Potter Andy (2017)\n\nI just bought a fitbit about 3 weeks ago and I've noticed that when I wake up it is about 20 bpm higher. Then after about an hour and 32 ounces of water it goes down. My hypothesis is that it you aren't well hydrated then it will affect your heart rate.\n\nHotsnail Andy (2017)\n\nAre you dead yet? It's been 4 years since you posted...Bad news is that we are all dying. Good news is that it usually takes about 80+ years, if you look after yourself.\n\nMyra Andy (2017)\n\nHave your doctor check your thyroid.\n\nRiyadh Andy (2013)\n\nI have the same thing, I'm 23, 5'8, 74kg with 14% bf, I've always been healthy, exercise regularly, but I usually get high readings for my pressure and pulse during rest 13/8 with a pulse no less than 80. I started to swim and do anaerobic exercises when you sprint or swim the fastest you could in a short period of time, now my pressure is 11/6 and my pulse is 60 :D I believe it's all with the same bf% and weight and that's after 3 months of adding the exercises I told u abt\n\nDragonPie Riyadh (2014)\n\nSome people just have higher rates than others.\n\nWhen I was sedentary and obese, I still had a rate of 70. I don't hold an illusion that I was healthy, but people's \"normals\" do vary.\n\nAndy (2013)\n\nmy dad was always a square build so when he was skinny he still weighed quite a bit. Hes always had high blood pressure so it might just be your genes.\n\nSomeone Andy (2013)\n\nIt is probably because you are consuming GMO foods or any foods contaminated by GMOs. Even trace amounts can spike bpm as high as 30 points. I would be willing to bet your blood pressure tends to be high too, yes? I exercise all the time. Even though I exercise all the time and am super fit, my heart rate is typically 95-105. After cutting out all GMO foods and any foods contaminated by GMOs, my heart rate dropped to about 60 bpms.\n\nThe more your heart beats, the faster it wears down. The faster it deteriorates, the shorter your life span. So, yes... you are dying.\n\nCharlie Hoying Someone (2013)\n\nHahahaha you are a joke. The mere fact of genetically modifying something doesn't make it a \"contaminant.\" That notion is laughable. Whether a genetic modification is good, neutral, or harmful for you depends entirely on what sequences of genetic code are altered. I'm all for transparency in the food preparation process, but the kind of fear GMO alarmists promote is unfounded.\n\nGerry Charlie Hoying (2013)\n\nExactly right - finally someone who isn't scientifically illiterate!\n\nBen A Charlie Hoying (2013)\n\nCorrect. GMO is no more harmful than cross breeding. Further it's the only way to feed the global population in 100 years.\n\nFrank T. Lofaro Jr. Ben A (2013)\n\nIf that is the case, we need population control/reduction!\n\nRoboticus Aquarius Ben A (2015)\n\nWhile I agree with Charlie, I would say that GMO is NORMALLY no more harmful than cross breeding. When you modify a plant or animal, you don't quite know what you are creating... usually you have an understanding of the basic trait you are coding for, and the results are fairly predictable... that doesn't mean there won't be unintended consequences. Most of our diet has been modified from it's original form, but it was via selective breeding. As for gene splicing, I'd prefer to know what was spliced into what before I digest.\n\nJohan Steyn Ben A (2016)\n\nNot true. The Monsanto poisons used are the problem. You guys are not informed about how bad GMO is for you. The same goes for aspartame, sugar, animal fats, MSG etc.\n\nJust eat everything as you like and don't bother being healthy.\n\nJohn D. Charlie Hoying (2015)\n\nTHANK YOU for posting that. It helps me retain some kind of hope for the intellectual future of mankind. :)\n\nOtisGumbo Charlie Hoying (2018)\n\nI like how you tell people they are a joke. You are so nice, no one will ever change tell you. Enjoy yourself.\n\nDooda Loc Charlie Hoying (2016)\n\nSo what can man do better than nature? Nothing,so exactly what are they doing then?\n\nWik Wang Someone (2013)\n\nThat statement about GMO is preposterous! You have no idea what you are talking about!\n\nNordlys Someone (2014)\n\nStrange. I just had to cut down coffe and tea. For the rest i eat everything. Even sugary food (occasionally, I'm not crazy for sweets).\n\nAlso GMO =/= nuclear.\n\nEven whites are (naturally) GM (first men that appeared on Earth were all black). And I don't think whites are weaker (in terms of health) than black people.\n\nDr Middleton Andy (2013)\n\nYes, due to my experiance with patients it is my understanding that your cardiac muscle system is not strong enough to cope with everyday life, which leads to a high resting heart rate so to conclude this you may pass in 5 months so the date would be 07/2014 please consult your local GP as soon as you can.\n\nJennifer Dr Middleton (2017)\n\nWhat kind of a response is this? He'll die from an 80 bpm rate?\n\nDave Dr Middleton (2017)\n\nSo much of your statement is true. I am a 57 yo retired military officer who has had HBP since my early twenties. I have taken many different BP meds. They put me on Lisinopril in 1997 a year before I retired and BP was still high and my resting HB was always around 78. After I retired and divorced due to a very unhealthy marriage, my BP became under control still on The same dose of Lisinopril and resting HR was still in the 70's and I ran every day and am a smoker. Last summer I had kidney failure. I am T2 diabetic and was taking Metformin and Glypozide. I had a dental issue and the dentist told me to take Advil. Before this, I had to quit running due to back surgery. I broke my back in the first Gulf War but lived with it because no doc believed my back was bad and said it was muscular and said take Motrin. Finally, I doc sent me to a surgeon and my scheduled three hour surgery lasted over eight hours. While I was in recovery the surgeon told my new wife I was a ticking time bomb and should have been paralyzed. So, my kidney failure was a result of taking Metformin, Advil, and Lisinopril which the kidney specialist stated these were all bad for a persons kidneys. Kidneys totally recovered and they took me off of all oral diabetic meds, Lisinopril, and can never take an aspirin or ibroprofen the rest of my life. I still cannot exercise and the put me on Amlodipine and 5 mg of Lisinopril. Now, my BP is consistently around 117/78 and my resting HB is between 47-55. I don't know the reason why, but am always asked if I am a runner with my resting HB in that range. I do believe that stress was the culprit in my HBP. My job in the military was highly stressful, home was stressful and now that I am totally retired and in a great marriage now for almost 13 years I am pretty much stress free. My wife and I have no children and not once have we raised our voices at one another. We never argue and that is because we communicate. So, Doc you are right.\n\nSheldon Scott Hatred Matthews Andy (2018)\n\nControl of your breathing will lower your rate, you could be breathing more causing your heart to pump more, deep slow breaths, breathe through your nose for 4 seconds, hold for 7s, release through your mouth for 8s. 4-7-8. With enough practice you should be able slow your breathing and control it without thinking about. Marathon runners and swimmers use this technique if they're taught it.\n\nI'd do some more research about it though, there's more to it I just can't remember. It's natural for me now.\n\nNote(it might be 4-8-7 I honestly can't remember, but my BPM on average is 57-63 when it used to be in the high 90s)\n\nTeegs Andy (2018)\n\nStress can affect your heart rate too...\n\nBrian Heise, MD Andy (2017)\n\nim 51 and have awakeng HR's of 39-41, but run 50 miles a week. i played tennis aggressive singles 3 hours a day age 9-17 and then quit working out untill 37. since 37, ive averaged 15 hours a week of weights or running. i think it takes time to get into shape. Of course exercise can be negated by a lack of sleep, alcohol, tobacco or stimulent use. if you said you were working out with at least a hour of cardio ie at 75% predicted max and eating 4000 plus calories a day and still had a 80's resting heart rate, id be worried. but, 30 minutes a day of what i see in the gym (in my area) and the typical calorie restricion type of diet, is not enough to really get into any real cardio shape.\n\nPeter K Andy (2017)\n\nI don't think you're dying, Andy. I spoke to a doctor about resting heart rate once and he told me about a 1500m Olympic athlete that had a resting heart rate in the 80's... Some people just have a high resting heart rate... but a disclaimer - go and ask a doctor....\n\nFern64 Andy (2017)\n\nOvertraining can cause a higher resting heart rate...\n\nBrad Senior Richardson Andy (2017)\n\nHR is fake news. I'm an athlete too and my HR always has been 80 to 90.\n\nPsycho Star Andy (2017)\n\nI know a lot of people would call you an adult but your a teenager trust me that's why your heart rate us soo high it'll go down when your about 20-21 don't worry it'll pass soon. I'm 17 and mine is 98bpm\n\nJon Andy (2017)\n\nWhy you so light\n\nNatalie Wong (2013)\n\nHi, I'm a 28 year old female, Chinese, 5'5 tall and weigh about 51kg /110lbs. I have a resting heart rate of 42. Is that too low? I regularly exercise (either of running or swimming or yoga adding up to 6 / 7 times a week).\n\nDaniel Garcia Natalie Wong (2013)\n\nHi there, How did you measure your resting heart rate?\n\nAmanda Daniel Garcia (2014)\n\nsit in a quiet area. place index and middle finger on your wrist not to hard. once you find your pulse have a watch with a second hand and count the beats for 15 seconds and then multiply by four.\n\nLondonguy14 amanda (2016)\n\nIt would be better to measure the pulse for 60 seconds or more to decrease the margin of error\n\nJordan amanda (2016)\n\nI think he knows that he was asking the person that he replied to how she specifically mesured hers\n\nFlic Natalie Wong (2013)\n\nI've similar stats - 30 year old female, 5'5, 50kgs, though not Chinese (Australian - European heritage) and a resting heart rate of 39 (they took this yesterday at a hospital when I checked in for Day Surgery). They did seem to think it was low and asked if I exercised, which I do. I don't think it matters if its low :-)\n\nAldousmom Flic (2014)\n\nha ha. I'm 45 and mine is 37. I'm an ultra-marathoner. I had a nurse get three diff machines to measure b/c she thought her thing was broken.\n\nKris Aldousmom (2014)\n\nLol, I'm 55 and mines 40, not bad for someone who only exercises 2x a week\n\nJustanfyi Kris (2014)\n\nActually if your resting heart rate is that low without significant cardiac training you likely suffer from some sort of cardiac dysfunction and have a nodal rhythm. Your resting heart rate shouldn't be that low. You might need to be evaluated for bradycardia.\n\nMike Orme Justanfyi (2016)\n\nFrom smug to worried in one reply. LOL\n\nMelissa Woods Justanfyi (2015)\n\nYes, anorexia causes a low resting heart rate because by excessive exercise and malnutrition the heart muscle itself starts burning (along with other muscles) because there are no glycogen stores. It is actually an indication of lowered heart function, and can lead to cardiac arrest. Elite athletes have heart rates in the 40's. So do malnourished anorexics.\n\nC. C. Justanfyi (2016)\n\nSo true. Especially if you have symptoms of breathlessness, confusion, dizziness and fatigue. I know because I have Bradycardia myself and I'm having a really hard time today rate at this moment is 47 beats per minute. When I was younger and more into fitness my heart rate dropped down lower 62-64 bpm.\n\nIn the excellent category according to the Box above but nowhere near these super fit women. Just be careful and if you have that low heart rate along with the symptoms I mentioned, please see your doctor.\n\nZidan Justanfyi (2015)\n\nExercising 2x a week is enough to achieve such a low heart rate, assuming those 2 exercise sessions are effective at metabolic conditioning (e.g. a total body resistance training workout that targets all major muscle groups through compound movements done to failure, and with no rest between said movements). If you don't believe me, do a workout like this yourself. You'd be susrprised how much you can change your health with infrequent workouts that are only 10 to 20 minutes and a good diet.\n\nThough I do agree 40 is a little on the extreme side. But I wouldn't make your diagnosis with a heart rate of 50+.\n\nYan Aldousmom (2014)\n\nKJ has a 34 resting heart rate. Almost there. :)\n\nDougie Aldousmom (2015)\n\nyou'll be dead by 60, enjoy\n\nJohn D. dougie (2015)\n\nHighly, HIGHLY unlikely.\n\nBut thanks for playing, we've got some great prizes for you on the way out.\n\nChris H. dougie (2015)\n\nYou clearly don't know what your talking about\n\nHunk guy dougie (2016)\n\nyeah right dougie, justifying your inactivity?\n\nAnotherperson Aldousmom (2016)\n\nwow, you're so awesome hahahaha\n\nLol Aldousmom (2015)\n\nAs a nurse, I wonder why she didn't just take a manual HR. Geez, basics! And it's more accurate. It's not like getting three different machines is easy anyway!\n\nNatalie Wong Flic (2013)\n\nThanks Flic, glad to hear that I am not alone :) I guess we should just keep up with our healthy lifestyle.\n\nKristin Ryan Flic (2014)\n\nI had an outpatient surgery today and mine was just 30!! I am 41 yrs old, 5'5, 135 lbs and do aerobics or run for exercise 6 days a week, but not more than an hour of cardio per day. I also do yoga twice a week. I hardly consider myself an athlete. The low pulse was an issue when they went to give me a narcotic for pain because they didnt want it to drop anymore with the narcotic.\n\nHandsome Jack Kristin Ryan (2015)\n\nWas there any point to this post, other than to brag?\n\nMichael Hammer Handsome Jack (2016)\n\nThese people may think they are bragging about their low HR, but most likely they have a serious underlying heart condition.\n\nDaria Handsome Jack (2016)\n\nshe has nothing to brag about, her BMI is 22.5\n\nCurtisk Daria (2016)\n\nThat's actually very anorexic. Low pulse is nothing to brag about. Most cases heavy workout reduces heart muscle which causes the heart to obviously beat slower. I would much rather have an average heart rate or only slightly above average as this shows the heart is strong and very muscular.\n\nMichael Hammer Kristin Ryan (2016)\n\nThat's a shame.Most likely a rate of 30 would be problematic with pain meds by iv infusion. I'm sure you think your low HR is due to you being \" Superfit \" but your being delusional. You need a complete cardio workup to see what the problem is.Bradycardia most likely is the cause. It could be cardiomyopathy which simply is heart failure due to the overuse of protein supplements.These damage your kidneys which leads to heart failure. It's a shame.Thank you. Michael.\n\nNeeta Flic (2015)\n\nYou are wrong s low heart rate can signal a low adrenal function ir body conserving energy due to low cortisol also low thyroid especially in women. If your heart rate is below 72 to 84 bpm on average your metabolism is too slow and you are hypothyroid if your body temperature is not steady at 98.2 to 98.6 in the afternoon. It's a real problem and doctors simply don't realize it but functional docs do. I suffered for 3 years low bpm low temp fatigue and weight gain and finally got thyroid meds. Huge difference !\n\nJohn D. neeta (2015)\n\nSo since his resting heart rate was somewhere in the low 40s/upper 30s, that means Lance Armstrong's metabolism was too slow?\n\nSal John D. (2015)\n\nhe was an athlete exercising 4-6 hours a day...you guys are most likely NOTTTTTTTTTT\n\nMichael Hammer Sal (2016)\n\nThat' correct Sal. Well said.\n\nMichael Hammer John D. (2016)\n\nWrong.This does not apply to an athlete on the pro level. Only a athlete on the pro level can have a HR this low, and still be considered normal. The rest think they are in super shape from their little workouts, but have underlying conditions. Don't fool yourself into not getting some tests done. If all is good, then that's great.You are a pro athlete billing clerk. Pro athletes get checked out very thoroughly on a routine basis. They are not on here asking questions about HR.\n\nMichael Hammer neeta (2016)\n\nWell said. I know people that have suffered for years not knowing what was wrong with them. Weight gain, no energy, and cold even when everyone else is hot. I talked this girl into getting some blood work done.Today she is feeling much better after going on Synthroid for her Hypothyroid condition.She lost weight, and has way more energy. Her hair stopped falling out, and her chronic dry skin cleared up.\n\nUnordinaryCitizen neeta (2015)\n\nCoQ-10 it up, and thank me later\n\nHotty198 UnordinaryCitizen (2016)\n\nwhich brand CoQ-10 do you use and what did it help you with?\n\nApril Smiley neeta (2015)\n\nWould like to know who your doc is\n\nNetey Flic (2015)\n\nYes it does because if you over train or have low thyroid or low progesterone as a female this can give you a false low and the lower the heart rate the slower the metabolism. Also if your adrenal glands are fatigued from stress or too much exercise or an infection your heart rate would be low as well as your blood pressure and that is not good. Slow heart slow metabolism. Means body not optimally efficient. Body temperature should be 98.2 or higher. If it's lower 5 days in a row when you wake up your thyroid isn't good or you have too much estrogen.\n\nJamie Mac netey (2015)\n\nNeeta... your taking your specific problem and applying it to the general. Your issues are a lot more complex than a low rest heart rate, indeed this is only one symptom of your condition. However, for the majority low rbmp is a good thing. Btw having an illness does not make you a medic expert... having extensive medic knowledge does.\n\nSal Jamie Mac (2015)\n\nLike all the doctors that misdiagnose things several times per day\n\nJamie Mac Sal (2015)\n\nso whats the option? Stay healthy and stay out of hospitals\n\nHehe Natalie Wong (2013)\n\nidk what nationality has to do with your heart :P\n\nGuest hehe (2013)\n\ndifferent races have different \"normal\" values, such as for blood proteins etc. most medical charts reference only Caucasians, and increasingly more African and Hispanic due to their population rise in the US, so there will be \"normal\" values for different populations. however because there are fewer Asians and they tend to be more passive and less demanding, most medical charts don't take them into consideration. this is bad for the population because there is no reference point for when someone is fine or unwell.\n\nDragonPie Guest (2014)\n\nWhat a load of trash. Her resting heart rate isn't related to your notions of race and stereotypes. There are outliers in all races. I am a Chicano in the US with indigenous heritage and European heritage and my resting heart rate is also abnormally low.\n\nMedically speaking, what I'd say matters is that your heart is perfusing your cells. That is to say, you aren't sick because your heart is failing at its duties. As long as you aren't pail, weak and lacking in energy, a low heart rate can merely be a sign that you are in good shape and is efficient.\n\nPersonally, at time when I've been in terrible shape, my heart rate has been 70 and at times when I've been in great shape, my heart rate has been 44 (my current rate). I mean, this despite the fact that I'm obese (Though I exercise quite a bit and I'm in terrific cardiovascular shape).\n\nBilbosaggins DragonPie (2014)\n\nweird. I just read lean unfit people are healthier than fat \"fit\" people.\n\nDragonPie bilbosaggins (2014)\n\nWhere did you read that?\n\nAnyhow, I do see my belly fat as being predictive of some problems in the future if I don't attempt to fix it, but I question that conclusion. I've read articles pointing to studies that state precisely the opposite and that makes more sense physiologically to me.\n\nI mean, having excess belly fat is certainly not good for anybody, but being sedentary raises your ldl cholesterol and lowers your hdl cholesterol and it isn't uncommon for sedentary people who appear thin to have unhealthy cholesterol levels, or blood pressures that increase their risks of developing various health problems.\n\nEither way, I plan on losing most of this belly fat in the next few months, so that should alleviate my biggest current risk factor for most foreseeable health problems. Unfortunately, losing weight in a healthy way takes time.\n\nBilboreturns DragonPie (2014)\n\nI read it in the June issue of Train magazine (they throw it into the box when you buy stuff off bodybuilding.com). Anyways, \"Research in the European Heart Journal found that unfit lean people are better protected against than fit obese people. The extra weight thanks to overeating simply puts too much pressure on your ticket.\" So yeah, you'll have to go digging in the European Heart Journal as a more in-depth citation wasn't given, and I'm sure there is a lot to it. It's good that you are losing weight, but don't fool yourself into thinking that you are already in the clear.\n\nDragonPie bilboreturns (2014)\n\nWell, I know that a study published by the Journal of American Medical Association showed precisely the opposite to be true, so I still question your conclusion.\n\nOf course I'm not perfectly \"in the clear\". I mean, after all, I have a risk factor for some diseases, but my vital signs say exactly the opposite. My resting heart rate is incredibly healthy. Through hard work and exercise, I've gotten it down to 40 beats per minute and I have plenty of energy throughout the day to do more than many sedentary thin people I've met. I can physically outperform many thinner people as well at bicycling despite the fact that I have to carry around extra weight to do so. I have a blood pressure in the normal range and I eat foods that are very healthy, so, yeah, I think that I've done more than enough to consider myself healthier than all but the fittest thin people.\n\nMy level of fitness and diet already mean that my HDL is raised and my LDL is lowered and that my vasculature is more healthy than many thinner people who exercise less and have worse diets.\n\nAnd, yes, once I lose my excess body fat, I have no major risk factors for any diseases and that will make me happier, but I know that I'm already in fantastic shape.\n\nBilbort DragonPie (2014)\n\nI'd go with the study that keeps you motivated instead of the one that has you convinced to relax because you can outperform some skinny couch potatoes. I'm guessing the study I referred to was in a recent issue of the journal, so it may have some new insight you want to look at. I'm sure there is some truth to both studies so don't be so quick to discredit it. It is probably a case of different ways they gauged health, maybe one is better than the other? You seemed into all of this so I just thought you'd of wanted to investigate. You can probably find it online in a university archives.\n\nDragonPie bilbort (2014)\n\nI need no study to motivate myself. That you presume that I do means that you presume I'm lazy that is a problem you should deal with regarding your own attitude about body weight. I am certainly healthier than unfit sedentary people, but I am also in better cardiovascular shape than many normal body weight active people and I regularly outperform many such people.\n\nDo some outperform me? Of course, but that doesn't mean that I can't be obese and in better cardiovascular shape than many active people. I think that by any objective measure except belly fat, I most certainly am.\n\nOf course, I'm excited to lose my belly fat, but that doesn't mean that I can't have pride in my abilities or that you should presume superiority.\n\nYou've made a point about making this about me. You've been on the offensive about my body even though you know nothing about me except that I am obese.\n\nWell, what about you? What makes you so proud and presumptuous? Why do you presume to lecture me? Have you been blessed with a thin body that doesn't put on weight easily and you like to presume that other people put on weight because they're lazy? You mentioned body building. Are you an exceptionally athletic person who gets his kicks by knocking people he sees as less physically fit down a notch? If so, you should really examine this about yourself before examining the bodies of others.\n\nBilbort DragonPie (2014)\n\nYou still haven't done any research, which is what this is about. I don't care about your body, but just about what's in your brain. What I read in the magazine makes more sense to me and I thought you would be interested to getting to the bottom of it. I don't care about what's in your brain anymore though - you've shown me enough. Maybe you shouldn't talk about your health issues in a public forum if you take everything so personally. Good luck and I'm so over this. Maybe re-read our conversation on here when you are feeling better about yourself.\n\nSteph bilbort (2014)\n\nI understood where you were coming from and I don't think you were being judgemental\n\nThe Anti-bully bilbort (2015)\n\nWhy are you attacking DragonPie? You must be a thin out of shape person who is using conflicting research to help raise your confidence levels. I'm an athlete and have a phenomenal physical appearance that gets glances everywhere I go. I am shaped like a sprinter because I am a sprinter. I find it best to uplift those who are trying to better their life. Not act in a matter of personal disgrace by trying to derail their goals to better health. You aren't listening to anything DragonPie is saying. You are just arguing some stupid point that makes no sense. The magazine you are referring to isn't even a reputable foundation of scientific research or evidence. It's basically \"contemporary\" science. It has no academic foundation. Im sure it doesn't even explain how thin people can be very unhealthy on the inside. Many of my thinner inactive friends have had colon cancer, blood pressure issues, diabetic disorders, and the list goes on. Don't think you are immune because you are thin. So just continue to be a thin coach potato and stop destroying lives! And DragonPie, continue to press forward with your goals. There are many factors that plays a role in why you have extra weight on you. Most are genetic. My parents were both athletes. So were my grandparents. Which explain my body composition. But, keep it up. Trust that the hard work will pay off! And keep working out. Muscle is the foundation needed to go into your golden years. It helps prevent many bone issues by acting as support system. That's why many thin elderly have higher risk of bone fractures. Lack of muscle definition. And all of my information can be found in any academic resource! Enjoy health by enjoying life! God Bless!\n\nJ. Sebastian DragonPie (2014)\n\nI think this discussion and your personal experience just highlights two things:\n\n1. There is a huge degree of individual variability with regards to cardio-vascular health\n\n2. Despite that variability, the data that is presented as scientific findings is focused on the median (and to a larger extent, the 95th percent confidence interval as the gold standard of predictive value, imagining patient data as a bell curve with normal distributions) - the collective experiences of the entire patient population in the study. Of course, in real life, we don't usually get biological data that is predictive to the gold standard or has normal distributions, so instead, we look at outcomes and the associations over a period of time (longitudinal studies). So given what we know about obesity, it is highly concomitant with and presents a high degree of co-morbidity with other risk factors, even when it is itself perhaps not a risk factor.\n\nSo the people that are saying \"fat people are unfit\" are generally correct. That is the most common case. OTOH though, folks like DragonPie are true outliers and what he is saying isn't necessarily false. The truth lies somewhere between, because his personal experience is valid, while not being representative - ie folks like him do not represent the norm.\n\nThe takeaway is that cardiovascular health is a spectrum but by and large its better to be thin than to be fat (even if its \"just a beer belly\"). Having a significant amount of visceral fat is most certainly unhealthful, being associated so prominently with a variety of disease processes. Having a significant amount of subcutaneous fat localized to the midsection may not always signify elevated risk for the same disease processes, but *is* associated with early death and increased likelihood of cardiovascular accident. This is the \"population outcome view\", so it doesn't negate the experiences of outliers.\n\nJustcause DragonPie (2014)\n\nDragonpie,i agree with you. My son at the age of 22 is fit and always in the gym.but ask him if he's healthy in cartio and his answer in no. On the other hand my daughter 23, struggles with weight (not 10 vanity pounds either) but plays softball meaning cartio is great. She can out perform my son anyday. Heart rate and blood pressure is good no health issues so far.hum i lost my point but just know you can be skinny and unfit or obese and fit.\n\nBodymechanicnyc DragonPie (2014)\n\nCholesterol is not a indicator of good or bad health . Bad cholesterol is a pharmaceutical bold face lie. A better indicator of overall health is inflammatory markers.\n\nJ. Sebastian bodymechanicnyc (2016)\n\nYes, but some *thing* is causing that inflammation. So high serum cholesterol is a proxy for bad health, and whether that is because it is causative or simply associated with disease processes like atherosclerosis - does it really matter though? I'd argue it does not.\n\nBecause, as a screening tool, serum cholesterol is useful. In terms of an assessment of relative risk, it isn't very useful and as you point out, looking at the HS-CRP is going to give you a better indicator of that or at least unveil some diagnostic avenues to explore.\n\nElevated inflammation could be from so many factors, for instance, that you'd not want to assume artherosclerotic plaques are the culprint just because of high serum cholesterol. Patient could have a malignancy or an infection. You'd want to keep it in mind, but also keep your mind open until other causes can be worked up and eliminated.\n\nHoward Milstein DragonPie (2014)\n\nNice to see you realize your fat could be a prediction of future problems.... Sad to imagine what you must look like?\n\nDragonPie Howard Milstein (2014)\n\nSad to see that you're so shallow that you think that you should be some sort of authority to judge the looks of people you've never met. That you very much, but I look great, but if I didn't, judging by your personality and values that you've displayed, anybody except the most shallow of people would almost certainly prefer my company to yours.\n\nHoward Milstein DragonPie (2014)\n\nI am only responding to your admitted (at one time I presume) obesity. I actually watch and struggle with almost every food I eat in order to keep myself looking good and pretty healthy for my age (61). Being even slightly overweight is uncomfortable as well as unhealthy and most importantly, shows a lack of dicipline\n\nOh and pardon me... For not waiting to make a comment before I see how you look. This is just my OPINION pal; it is how I feel ; if that is ok with you?\n\nThe Anti-bully Howard Milstein (2015)\n\nYou presence on this forum just proves one thing, with age doesn't bring wisdom! You make elders look bad! You off all people should know better. You have been around long enough to have seen Adam kiss Eve and still haven't found the value of what a closed mouth can do. Lol. You should be ashamed of yourself! My parents are your age and my grandparents are in their 90s. They would never act like you! We are all in great shape and condition. My grandparents still workout. With light weights of course. But even though they look younger than people your age, they never talk as stupid as you do about physical aesthetics! They encourage. But education may play a key in that. We all have our PhD's. My grandmother was a professor, grandfather a doctor, mother a doctor, father a lawyer and myself a professor. We uplift! Bad Grandpa! Bad!\n\nOlga The Anti-bully (2016)\n\nYou are calling yourself The Anti-bully, yet what you are doing right here is putting down a person for his age, instead of just discussing what was wrong with his statement. It's called 'ageism' and you either have to change your 'name' or your attitude.\n\nDragonPie Howard Milstein (2014)\n\nEverybody is entitled to their opinion.\n\nRoboticus Aquarius Howard Milstein (2015)\n\nYou have every right to be opinionated and spout negative comments and make shallow judgements. Just like some people are born on third base and think they hit a triple, a lot of skinny people are self-rightous about weight, I suppose it gives you one area in your life in which you can feel superior to others. Your right to an opinion doesn't make it an appropriate one.\n\nMichelle bilbosaggins (2014)\n\n...well last i read people who talk about \"fat\" people are real bad.... down from 360 to 235 here... and can runs circles around most of my friends....\n\nRoboticus Aquarius Michelle (2015)\n\nGreat Job! I've gone from 310 to 270 so I'm on my way. That's still about 70 lbs overweight for me. Too much work, too little sleep for too long. Now I eat virtually no sugar or simple carbs. Willpower has it's limits, I try to design my life so I rarely need it. I grew up on sports, am currently into running, softball, tennis, and martial arts, plus the odd hike or bike ride or swim. BP 117/79 pulse is 58, but can be 45 if I'm sitting at work all day, or 65 if I'm up and doing chores on the weekend. All my blood markers are in healthy ranges... liver, kidney, Triglycerides very low, and I passed the army physical for my age group (47) last year. I'd wager I'm in far better health than a lot of skinnier folks. That won't stop me from losing the weight; now that I know what works for me.\n\nBrooke Lorren bilbosaggins (2015)\n\nWeird. I just read the opposite yesterday in the August issue of Runner's World, where they were profiling an obese marathon runner. Doctors in the article said that she was healthier than thin people who sit on their butts all day (paraphrasing).\n\nRoboticus Aquarius Brooke Lorren (2015)\n\nAs someone who is technically 'obese' myself (but then I was 'overweight' as a muscular teen with 5% bodyfat, so I'm somewhat an outlier) it may very well be true, but the problem with us big athletes is that at some point we go downhill fast - the extra weight is an anchor if we don't take care of it. A risk factor is a risk factor, we all tend to have one or two, and whether its visible, like weight, or not, like hypertension, or it's smoking, or substance abuse - we all need to address our weaknesses if we want to improve our longevity. I know an ultra-marathoner vegan who has a pot-belly - some of us just have a really rough time with weight, just liike some of us are predisposed to hypertension (runs in my family.) We can have multiple risk factors and still be healthy, but the more you have, the bigger the anchor you pull every day, so it's good to knock them off one by one.\n\nOlga Brooke Lorren (2016)\n\nBrooke, from studies that I've read, the studies are not talking particularly whether obese people cannot be fit (they can), but whether obese fit people have higher morbidity rates than unfit people within normal BMI range. I'm not talking here from perspective of a slim couch potato. I am overweight unfit person trying to motivate myself being more fit and hopefully loosing some weight.\n\nKamal Daher bilbosaggins (2015)\n\n100%, when i was in a obese shape my heart rate had an average of 80, now that i brisk walk and run 5 times a week 1 hour a day, my resting heart rate is 45 .\n\nRobert DragonPie (2014)\n\nNobody uses the word Chicano anymore. How old are you\n\nDragonPie Robert (2014)\n\nWhy do you care how old I am? Maybe I'm older than you, maybe I'm younger. What do you imagine that would say about me?\n\nWhy do you think I have to defend calling myself a Chicano? Why do you presume that you get to judge me based off of my use of that term?\n\nL DragonPie (2014)\n\nDragonPie seriously don't waste your time on this guy. It sounds like you are taking care of yourself and that's great ;-)\n\nJames DragonPie (2014)\n\nDragonPie you are right most marathon runners and bicyclist die in between the ages of 40 and 50 because they are doing to much cardio and not enough physical exercise. You need a lot of carbs and protein for your body to burn if you don't and you do an excessive amount of cardio your body will begin to break down your muscle and use them for energy and that causes fat to build up around your heart. So having a bit of body fat not bad as long as you stay fit, eat right, and work both your cardiovascular system and your muscles then you will remain in great shape. Personally man I don't listen to magazines, books, or websites. I go by what I see. Take for instance If I wanted to get big muscle wise i'm not going to read in a magazine I am going to go to a guy that is the size I want to be and take training from him, not from a book.\n\nMark james (2014)\n\nYea! Reading books is a stupid idea; and medical journals are an even worse idea!\n\nDragonPie Mark (2014)\n\nI think that magazines tend to be filled with a bunch of pseudointellectual nonsense from pseudo-experts, so I tend to be somewhat dismissive of them unless they build a good cogent argument.\n\nMedical journals are another thing. I tend to take those more seriously.\n\nRoboticus Aquarius Mark (2015)\n\nEveryone learns with a different style, it's wise to adapt to what works best for you, whether that's reading, video, or 1x1. We're lucky to have so many learning opportunities available to us.\n\nJohn D. james (2015)\n\n(Reads James's comment)\n\n(rubs eyes)\n\n(reads it again)\n\nYou're kidding, right?\n\nMb DragonPie (2014)\n\nDragon you sound very insecure.\n\nThe fact that you refer to yourself as obese and in terrific shape in the same post indicates your delusions.\n\nSounds like somebody needs to lay off the carbs and saturated fats.\n\nDragonPie Mb (2014)\n\nI'm not insecure. One can be obese and in terrific shape. That you question this is kind of ludicrous. I mean, seriously, if I spent months of time building up more and more cardiovascular endurance and I am able to outcompete others, why should I not see myself as in very good cardiovascular health?\n\nI'm not insecure. That's the type of presumption that shallow people make about people they want to deride because of looks. I have everything to be proud of who I am. That I work in a profession that's meaningful in my community, that I work hard to improve myself in every way possible, that I am physically capable in many ways and that I am an intelligent person are all things that I should be proud of.\n\nYou should be ashamed for presuming that you should judge me for willingly disclosing my one health predictor.\n\nLennoxMorey DragonPie (2014)\n\nYa. because i watch the Olympics where every 8th or 9th competitor is a fat fit guy.\n\nDragonPie LennoxMorey (2014)\n\nActually, if you watch some competitions, you will see some fat, fit guys.\n\nBut, one doesn't have to be a top athlete in any particular field to be cardiovascularly fit. Some athletes in the best shape they could ever muster would never be able to compete in any number of sports at the top level, but they can be in terrific relative shape.\n\nIf you exercise and have plenty of energy throughout the day and you are happy because of the benefits of the exercise and you can even outcompete many thinner people who themselves have put in the time to get into decent shape, you can be fat and in good shape.\n\nThis isn't a hard concept. This shouldn't be shocking to you. Really, I don't understand how some folks can be so hard headed in trying to understand this concept.\n\nRoboticus Aquarius LennoxMorey (2015)\n\nEver watch the weightlifters? Some of them are pretty hefty.\n\nClem_the_Great DragonPie (2014)\n\nYour ignorance of human physiology is showing. There are many parameters in which normal values vary with race. But we know, you're one of those \"race is only a social construct\" lala land dim wits.\n\nDragonPie Clem_the_Great (2014)\n\nOh, am I in the presence of a phrenologist? Enlighten me, sir.\n\nAvatar\n\nDragonPie Guest (2015)\n\nThere are conditions that occur at higher frequencies in some races. That doesn't really mean that it's obfuscating to dwell on them and pretend that the vast majority of health conditions are not predicated by race and to pretend that there are such staunch differences is in fact harmful to patient care and upholds false notions.\n\nPhrenology, now properly regarded as pseudoscience, was a good example of what happens when race is treated as significantly important when examining basic information such as vital signs.\n\nThere is more variation within a race by a large degree than between races which are indeed social constructs.\n\nThere is more genetic variation between different African people than all other socially constructed races combined, so it's disingenuous to pretend that race is somehow genetically defined.\n\nJ. Sebastian DragonPie (2016)\n\nThere is more genetic variation between different African people than all other socially constructed races combined, so it's disingenuous to pretend that race is somehow genetically defined.\n\nThis is a common misunderstanding of genetic distance. That genetic distance in Africans is larger, isn't any evidence that race is NOT genetic, of course it is. That doesn't even make any sense to claim. Genetic cluster analysis demonstrates that race is NOT a social construct as non-scientists and scientists in other fields (Who are laypersons in biological science and no more qualified to render an opinion than a man on the street) like to claim, but rather coincides very neatly with study participants self-assigned race AND the race perceived by stranger observers. Also, race can be determined by DNA testing. It is in other words *only* capable of being genetically determined - whether the assay process is a computer or the human eye/mind. Because ultimately race is merely the phenotypical expression of a discrete genotype that forms the basis for the recognition and categorization of \"racial\" identity. These manifest as overt and covert cues such as eye shape, head shape, body shape, skin coloration and pigmentation, hair coloration and texture, eye coloration, etc. The human observer categorization isolated physical features (phenotypes) and excluded social features (stereotypes), and the DNA test cannot test for social features or constructs, so they are excluded automatically.\n\nThe simple explanation is that the intra-group genetic distance is larger because Africans are an older population - its like a boat at sea...the more time you spend adrift, the more you diverge from the point of origin. The African peoples have no admixture with homo neanderthalis, for instance, while Asians and Whites have less than 2% variance in relative neanderthal admixture. So already whites and Asians are closer genetically to each other than either one is to African populations.\n\nSame thing with genetic distance - it is a heavily time dependent variable. Time is also a proxy for physical distance, since traveling takes time, migration takes time, every migration reduces the population and increases genetic variation due to interbreeding with strangers. Populations that have had 1000-2000 *more* generations to spread to the corners of their continent and repeat the cycles of isolation and intermixing are inevitably going to exhibit greater variation in their group than younger and less mobile populations that didn't have those diaspora event cycles.\n\nWaldon DragonPie (2016)\n\nTotal BS. If you are obese, you are not in terrific cardiovascular shape.\n\nDragonPie waldon (2016)\n\nYou absolutely can be. If you are obese and can run several miles you are in terrific cardiac shape. Obesity isn't healthy for somebody overall, but that doesn't mean that an obese person can't improve their cardiac fitness as much as anybody else.\n\nI am personally no longer obese, but I was absolutely in fantastic shape as an obese person with a very low resting heart rate and a very healthy diet and I could run for several miles without tiring and did so regularly.\n\nWaldon DragonPie (2016)\n\nTotal rubbish. You wouldn't be able to run several miles a day and be obese.\n\nDragonPie waldon (2016)\n\nThat sir is simply incorrect. People absolutely do so.\n\nHell, when I was obese I did so. I've had a few friends who were obese and trained up to running several miles.\n\nThere is no medical reason that an obese person can't condition themselves to run several miles. There are some injuries more common with heavier runners such as increased risk of repeated stress injuries like shin splints or stress fractures.\n\nWatch the \"Marathon Challenge\" Documentary (it's on you tube). Some of the participants failed to run the marathon, one lady who had diabetes had difficulty with repeated stress injuries, but almost all were able to run at least ten miles with training and many remained obese throughout.\n\nBrad Mundie Guest (2016)\n\nWhat aren't you PC BRO?

This concerned me but when I got my physical fitness evaluation I was told that it was not a bad thing. It just meant I was in excellent health. She actually said I had the conditioning of a professional athlete. So I don't think it's anything to worry about. That said, I am not a doctor. So you should probably get an exam just to be sure. Hope this helped.\n\nHomerlly Natalie Wong (2014)\n\nI weigh 245 6 ft tall 68 years old my resting rate varies 43 to 50avg. 46\n\nBAD Natalie Wong (2014)\n\nhello Natalie. i meant to reply about your resting heart rate, but i created my own comment. but hope the information helps.\n\nJim (2013)\n\nI'm 97 and have a resting heart rate of 103BPM, i consider this to be a problem as i run 20 miles a day, 8 days a week, can anybody help?\n\nNotGoku jim (2013)\n\nYou need to train in 100x gravity. This will raise your power level and lower your resting heart rate.\n\nHippy Chick jim (2013)\n\nHmmm...try giving honest facts...Get off a serious sight, and go hang out in yahoo answers or something Jim... 97 yrs old 20 miles a day 8 days a week...Your beyond help!\n\nManzapip jim (2013)\n\nDiet and tone down the running for a day or two and give your body rest. Watch the sodium intake, drink plenty of water and watch the sugar intake. Eat carrots and greens and then see what the results are after totally resting and taking your BP with a digital monitor from Walgreens/CVS pharmacies. Good luck and keep me posted, please!\n\nPaul jim (2013)\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nApoc (2013)\n\nI'm 37 a cage fighter known for having great cardio.i do intence cradio workout and strength training 3 to 4 times a week. I weigh 145 to 150 lbs. The young athletes that I train with and fight can hardly keep up with me and often can't. So I'm in great shape. My resting heart is usually about 100 bpm. What does that mean?\n\nEvil mitch apoc (2014)\n\nim the same age as u 72 kg and i do the same sport train 6 days a week and my resting heart rate is 49 bpm\n\nManzapip apoc (2013)\n\nCheck the Blood Pressure with a digital monitor first. You need to rest for 10-15 minutes before checking it and do not eat anything for a least 30 minutes prior to checking it. Cut out sodium and really watch the protein intake. These make the BP increase. Then, see what the heart rate is. I think the most important thing is the Blood Pressure. All heart rates fluctuate and vary significantly. Plus, your impact sport and contact workouts are stressful on the body.\n\nTina Necaise (2014)\n\nhi i am a 28 year old female i been having resting heart rates of 49 to 61 they say it is normal and i will be fine i also have wolf Parkinsin white syndrom it scares me idk what to do anymore i just wanna be better again\n\nKarleen Zimmer (2015)\n\nI'm 42, 5'6\" and 125 lbs. I have a resting heart rate of 84. I do not exercise and I consume copious amounts of sugar. I do not have any weight issues. Is there anything that could help me understand if I have a heart issue or a thyroid issue?\n\nAlistair A Miller (2013)\n\nI am 77. Due to severe arthritic limbs, I cannot do much exercise. My heart-rate at rest is 50. I assume,therefore,\n\nthat my heart is very healthy!\n\nManzapip Alistair A Miller (2013)\n\nBuy a digital monitor at Walgreens/CVS pharmacy. Every person should have one. They cost about $80. Follow the instructions. Depending on the model, I can assist you in setting it up. Get the wrist model. It has upper and lower blood pressure plus heart rate. Rest for 10 minutes sitting down and arm resting at heart level. Take your blood pressure in the morning, and at night. It will vary and see what it says. Let me know and good luck!\n\nCarmen (2013)\n\nOkay! I am concerned lol. Thought I was fine. I am 28 female exercising few times a week for last couple months and my heart beat is around 112-114 per minute... It shoots up to 185 during running or body attack... should I be concerned? I feel mostly fine. Maybe I should think about a doctors appointment lol I may already be dead. Maybe that is what attributes to my crazy fatigue.\n\nGuest Carmen (2013)\n\nLast time my body was attacked, my HR went to 242. Getting the knife out of my back was the bigger problem though. The thief stole my wrist monitor too. Bastard. I've been trying to find it on EBay and Craigslist.\n\nManzapip Carmen (2013)\n\nHello Carmen,\n\nGo get a physical and see what your Blood pressure and heart rate are. Keep in mind, it always goes up at the Dr. Office due to a little anxiety. Get a digital monitor at the local pharmacy and get the wrist band. It has all those features and take it twice daily. it will vary and see what it displays. Good luck!\n\nNordlys Manzapip (2014)\n\nindeed. It always happens to me, so I measure my heart rate with a clock or a stopwatch.\n\nIf you're mentally serene, pressure should not increase as much as heart rate due to agitation.\n\nSomeone Carmen (2013)\n\nCut out GMO foods and any foods that may have been contaminated by GMOs. Your bpms will normalize and your crazy fatigue will go away.\n\nMichelle Carmen (2013)\n\nI have the same problem IM out of shape but i now work out 6 days a week with intense cardio my heart rate will go all the way up to 190 bpm and at rest it is around 74 bpm I am a 26 year old female throughout the day sometimes it goes up and down while IM just sitting down at work but I do have thyroid disease and am pretty sure the synthroid is making me have rapid heart rate.\n\nLeon Kingsford (2018)\n\nThe general guidance is that the normal heart rate is 60-100\n\nDoctors prefer 50-76 simply because anything above 80 is considered a major indicator of potential heart disease in the future - there is an undeniable link between congestive artery disease and heart rate simply because as the arteries become blocked the heart has to work harder to pump blood.\n\nLifestyle changes are the key - healthier diet and lots of cardio exercise.\n\nSimon G (2013)\n\nI'm 44, mountainbike, climb and run, drink occasionally, don't do ponsy gym's (outdoors is free) and eat when I'm hungry, resting heart rate 52\n\nManzapip Simon G (2013)\n\nPerfect. That's what I need to get back into. Biking and a glass of red wine. Mine should drop!\n\nDr. Stone (2013)\n\nBe advised that if you are not a marathon runner, or not heavily active in cardio excersise, a low resting heart rate is one of the prime symptoms of an enlarged heart. If you fall in this category it would be wise to see a physican, who will then refer you to a cardiologist. Dont panic however, as it good also just be genetics. Also if you are concerend about your resting heart rate not falling were you want it on this table, the 60-100 range is perfectyl acceptable, and blood pressure is a far superior indicator of cardiovascular health(HEALTH not FITNESS) then resting heart rate!!!! So be sure to get a home monitor and check it at least a couple of times a week!\n\nManzapip Dr. Stone (2013)\n\nI returned to the states from Mexico. I lived there 3 years and am temporarily here. Northern Cal. It is stressful as I forked out the tuition money and condo for my college freshman daughter. I am very athletic, 49, never had any major medical problems. I have been under some stress, my BP shot up and the doctor insisted on giving me benicar 20mg. Now, my BP Is perfect. it has been two days. I just feel a little dizzy and apparently, this is an adjustment period. What would happen if I stopped taking benicar after 4 days?\n\nNordlys Dr. Stone (2014)\n\nUhmmm.\n\nI was always fat and my rest heart rate was 100.\n\nNow, after losing 5 kilos is 72. And I still have 12 kilos to loose.\n\nMy heart always worked to support a fat body. There will be a problem if, when I will be slim, it will be below 60?\n\nMy brother said my rest heart rate dropped also because of a radical changement in my life style.\n\nCharlyne Lepetit (2013)\n\nI am 30 years old, 4'9 and 45kg/99lbs and my heart rate is 83 which is poor! :(\n\nHow can I improve it? My mum and my granddad died due to heart attack and I would to avoid that.\n\nNikhil Apte Charlyne Lepetit (2013)\n\nCardio exercises get your heart rate up and makes the heart stronger. That is the ONLY solution.\n\nI have recovered from 90+ bpm (was obese) to a 50-55 bpm heart rate and I feel great!\n\nNordlys Nikhil Apte (2014)\n\nNews. My rest heart rate dropped to 72 in latest weeks.\n\nI started to run and I'm still losing weight at healthy pace.\n\nNordlys Nikhil Apte (2014)\n\nProbably you were extra fat.\n\nis the only reason why you managed to slow down a so high rest heart rate.\n\nMine is above 80. I'm fat, but to reach an healthy weight, I need to lose just 12 kilos. Is very poor to improve my earth contitions.\n\nGuest Nikhil Apte (2013)\n\nI didn't feel great when I fainted and my pulse heart rate was 34\n\nElise (2013)\n\nI'm a semi-professional modern-ballet dancer (I go 2 hrs 6 times per week) yet my heart rate's 97...Hu?\n\nRach Elise (2013)\n\nI run 3 times a week (5miles) and go to gym in between and my heart rate is about 95, my blood pressure is good though, which is a better measure. This is genetics as my mum is the same, so don't worry when she was 50 she cycled around brazil. x\n\nManzapip Rach (2013)\n\nWhat is your age and what is your BP?\n\nIvanKaramasov (2013)\n\nMy resting heart rate is around 40. I am 47 years old and in good shape (work out 3-4 times a week), but not a super athlete in any way. I guess it is genetical as my father also has a very low resting heart rate.\n\nJanac Meena (2013)\n\nIf you are excited, angry, or anxious, your heart rate will fluctuate. Don't be afraid you aren't meeting the requirements on this table. Also note that the comments are biased, because most people that DO exercise would search up a heart-rate website.\n\nFunkyMunky Janac Meena (2013)\n\nOr those concerned about their heart rates which seem too fast or too slow, like me.\n\nSteve (2013)\n\nIt may be noted that resting heart rate correlates more quickly to physical activity than the possibility of any cardiovascular structural changes which might occur long term. I believe that is because exercise effectively slows down the conversion of T4 thyroid hormone to T3 which is the active form of the hormone. Decreased T3 achieved by way of an increase in the stress hormones cortisol results in a slower heart rate. The same thing occurs when we're sick as if the body is reappropriating energy for fight or flight to the detriment of normal metabolic processes.\n\nAntigua Farms (2014)\n\nChuck Norris' resting heart rate is -27.\n\nHal (2013)\n\nPeople seem to be confused..\n\n1. The LOWER your resting heart rate, the BETTER (generally)\n\n2. Resting heart rate is best taken IMMEDIATELY upon waking up (without alarm, when you are most at rest but conscious)\n\n3. KNOW YOUR OWN BODY. Numbers can mean different things to different people based on genetics, lifestyle and other factors\n\nGuest (2014)\n\nI am 65 y.o., female, 5'6\" and I was in great shape 10 years ago but quit exercising and paying attention. Last September I weighed (gulp) 182 lbs and looked fat/awful. I started to eat healthy foods and dropped 10 lbs in 6 months but it was a struggle. I finally committed myself on March 1st. Have been using exercycle and walking plus eating fresh foods. In the past 60 days I've dropped another 10 lbs, my BP has dropped from average of 135/90 to 120/80. My average RHR dropped from mid 80s to mid 70s.

I have a resting heart rate of 57-67 which seems remarkably low for a person my size. I get little to no exercise and I eat OK. I was 270 a year and a half ago and working out intensely (insanity) 5 days a week. But I have since gained nearly 40 lbs and seriously cut out on exercise. My blood pressure is 117/ 67 - 128/ 84. I get these checked regularly as I donate plasma to help support school. So I guess I'm wondering that if my previous habits of working out could last this long or should I be concerned? When I was working out it was 115/76 around 60-70 BPM but never below 60 when I checked. However I was not checking it as regularly as I am now. I don't know if this helps but I've always been around 300 lbs. What are the possibilities/probabilities? I understand that a normal range is 60-100bpm but i can't think of an environmental/dietary reason for my pulse to be dropping when I thought it should be rising and the 57 was very surprising to me. Is it common when pacemaker cells are out of whack that the pulse will slowly change over time or will it happen abruptly?\n\nCindy (2014)\n\nMy husband is 59 years old...he is a big man ...weighs 300 lbs. he has had 2 heartattacks....has 3 stents in and the last 2 days he has been short of breath ...said his chest is just sore and I take his blood pressure and heart rate with a machine...yesterday his heart rate stayed around 104 but today it is staying around 110...is there need to be alarmed?\n\nAntigua Farms (2014)\n\nA low RHR is good...but you don't want a RHR of 0 ;)\n\nSonia khan (2013)\n\nHi I am 23, 5ft and about 52kg.

Davis (2013)\n\nIts funny on here half of ya or very healthy and don't know it and the other half have a potential problem going on and have no clue about it! Read, read, read and educate yourself with legitimate medical information.\n\nJoseph (2013)\n\nI am 50 yr old male, good diet, 5'11\", but overweight at 200 lbs. I run 3.5 mile/day for 4 days/week, combining grueling sprints, distance runs and hills (but not that much run time, really), and eat a very high veg/fruit diet. Run 2 miles in 15:40, RHR 45, feel great.\n\nMarnie McCallister (2013)\n\nRHR in a vacuum of \"your RHR should be...\" is so one dimensional as to be almost completely useless. It misses completely the aspect of metabalism. I saw a show once on these crocodiles in Africa who eat only during a one two week period of the year--when the wildebeast migration comes past their watering hole. For the other 50 weeks of the year, the crocs barely move. They never mentioned it on the show, but I'd hazzard a guess and say their RHB was pretty damn low. If you're a slug--even a fat one--who comes home from a desk job and park your fat ass in front of the tv to watch American Idol, only moving to change the channel and shove greasy prepackaged food into your cake hole, you probably have a pretty slow RHB. Why wouldn't you?\n\nThis isn't just speculation. You don't have to read much to come across the fact that one of the benefits of working out is that even after a mere 45 minutes of moderate physical activity, your metabalism can be revved up for up to 18 hours. If you're an athlete who spends time working out, you're going to have a higher RHR. And, if you're a weight lifter, carrying a nice proportion of muscle, your RHR will be that much higher.\n\nSo, what do they mean by the RHR of an athlete? I work out first thing in the morning, and after combining weight training and aerobics (I'm a guy--my facebook account is as fake as a three dollar bill...just created so I can place comments on blogs), by HR is sometimes as high as 175. Three hours later, it's still about 65. It rarely, even on off days dips below 60. I'm 46, 6 feet tall, 197 pounds, and about 6% bodyfat.\n\nAs an athlete carrying a fair amount of muscle, I would be surprised if my RHR was lower than a couch potato, who considers physical activity to be watching NFL on Sudays.\n\nCoytle Marnie McCallister (2013)\n\nI thought that having a lower resting heart rate meant that it wasn't working as hard because you are healthier. Im somewhat over weight and not very active but my rhr is between 108 and has gotten as high as 153. Resting! I was told more exercise will help lower my rhr. High is bad but somehow my blood pressure is very low to normal. And one more clarification, not all lazy people watch sports.... ick\n\nDouglas Stratton (2020)\n\nI am 23, I did boxed for over 9 years, some sessions with The Olympic boxing team. I am 5\"9 and I weight 13 stone. My RHR was 96. I counted my pulse for 15 seconds then times it by two and then again by two. Getting a total of 60 seconds. I have been laying down in bed for over an hour. Reasons on why I have such a high heart rate? I am also a retail manager so I'm still quite active, biking to and from to work and my work can be Physically challenging at times. So again why would my RHR be this high?\n\nChristopher Brown (2020)\n\nI'm 31 my rhr from fitbit is 49 to 52 but I'm no athlete I'm semi fit, is this bad\n\nLouisiette Ellens (2020)\n\nI am a 27 year old female, recently given up smoking of 10 years, 5'5, weigh 120lb and my resting heart rate can get as low as 49 but usually in the 50's range.

My doctor never gives me 10 minutes of lay down time and I've been taking mine after being up for awhile and walking around. So I'll just subtract 5 points to get the true resting number. Which is much better looking btw. Ran 75 at age 60 this a.m. after getting up and milling around for a couple of minutes. So I assume that would be around 70ish if I had taken it in bed.

Cuz honestly it actually scares the crap out of me. This is the absolute lowest it's ever been at least since we have been together. I take both our vitals at least once a day cuz we both have different medical issues that require we keep a close eye on blood pressure...pulse rate...temperature...that kind of thing.

I played football competitively in the UK until I was 45 and now play some golf. I go to the gym 3-4 times a week and would say my resting heart rate is normally between 45 and 55 bpm. I purchased an Omron blood pressure monitor for my wife recently and have taken my own readings 3-4 times a week - average readings last week were 141/79 RHR 48. Last week on on afternoon my resting heart rate was 37bpm but I had been sitting down writing a report for most of the morning. I went out for a walk with our dog and it was back up to normal for me when I got back. I guess my point is that we are all different and medical science seems to base everything on what is statistically the 'norm'. As an example for a number of years my father was given eyedrops to treat glaucoma as he had high pressure in his eyes. I have been having regular eye tests because of the family history but with medical advances they have now found out that I have very thick cornea which seems to mean that even though I have high pressure in my eyes the thick cornea mean that it is not a problem (it would be if I had thin cornea). It was mentioned at my last visit at the eye clinic that maybe my father did not suffer with glaucoma because it is likely he had thick cornea as it is very often hereditary but unfortunately these tests were not available when he was alive.\n\nHector Hellious (2017)\n\nI am 23y, 6ft3in, 230lb\n\nTowelie (2017)\n\nIm fat out of shape but my resting heart rate under athlete\n\nSteve (2017)\n\nIf you're worried about heart health consider cutting salt from your diet. Almost everyone eating high salt will get high blood pressure in time. Also, go plant based and cut out refined oils and simple sugars. Walk. Meditate. I recommend a diet mostly from a plant-based approach which is the only approach proven to actually work and reverse/prevent heart disease. Hope this helps. Be well.\n\nRajib Roy (2017)\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am posting this query for my father (75 year old) with the following details â\n\n1.slightly ischemic heart (no surgeries were recommended).\n\n2. On BP medicines for a period of about 15 years now.\n\n3. Absolutely active (as compared to his age) and does all normal household as well as outdoor jobs (market/bank etc). Doesn't play sports but is into lot of walking.\n\nHe has a pulse of around 40 per minute; however he doesn't complain of any dizziness, fainting, clarity of thought problem, exhaustion/fatigue etc, which i see typically are symptoms of low heart rate.\n\nWould you kindly advise is this is of any concern? If so, what needs to be done please?\n\nYour expert advise is solicited please.\n\nSiegfried Verheijke (2017)\n\nHi, I am 52 years old, and I have two questions:\n\n1) I have a resting heart rate of 41 (used to be 43-44, but after going vegan for 3.5 months I am getting much fitter) and yesterday I hit a max. heart rate of 179 bpm at the sprinting end of a one-hour mountain run. I seem to be outside of all the charts with both my resting and maximum heart rate. Could you say that a range of 41 to 179 is quite okay and denotes good fitness?\n\n2) During a Bruce fitness test in May this year, when I was still not so fit (i.e. when I was starting my vegan lifestyle), my blood presurre went up to 210. The doctor said that this was extermely high, but that all other signals seemed to be okay (I maxed out at 20.4 METs and 15'16\", which is supposedly athletic). Is it correct to think that my heart is just capable of pushing a lot of blood, because I have been doing sports all my life, so the blood pressure rises? Or is it something to worry about?\n\nI have lost 10 kilos since May and improved my running times by 25%, simply because of a plant-based whole foods lifestyle. It definitely feels great, but these are two questions I have had on my mind for a while.\n\nVelocity Bird (2017)\n\n\"Fewer\" heartbeats are required, not \"less\".\n\nBrian Heise, MD (2017)\n\nearly am upon awakening HR is in the 38 to 42 bpm range. ive been trail running 25 plus miles a week for 9 years. age 51, 220#, 6'0\" 901 am cst right now its 47 after some very string coffee.\n\nYusuf musa (2017)\n\nIam 16 years old, 68kg, my resting heartbeat is 58-62, Is it ok.\n\nLovely fernandez (2017)\n\nHi I'm turning 29 years old. And im always palpitating when I'm resting. And to day it was 115 per minute. Imy stress yes for 2yrs but I'm quite worried about my heart because sometimes my chest hurts too. What do u think it is?\n\nI am ME (2017)\n\nI am 50 and PUTZING around my home and garden are the extent of my physical activity. My resting pulse is 50bpm and it has been as low 42 pbm. I occasionally use marijuana, about 1.5-2 times a month. I also use magic mushrooms approximately 3-4 times a year. Valium and adderall about 2-4 times a year each. I have no history of abuse except for alcohol in my low to mid 20's. \"My\" definition of abuse. no aa or rehabs, just a young heavy drinker that ended when I got married. I have not been to a doctor except for emergency care. Once following an auto accident with a few follow up appointments after I was released. I should mention that my heart did stop at some point because of the crash. However, I am thankful to the first responders and Dr's for saving me. I have not taken an antibiotic since the early 80's and stopped any and all meds when I got out of hospital following the auto accident. I spent 2 months in a hospital bed inside my home where my wife had to give me injections of a blood thinner. These stopped once I was able to aptly move around. I do NOT want to go to a Dr. but with my age my wife is insisting. Can someone please tell her that we are all dying and i just want to be left alone until the time comes. I do NOT want fingers in my bum, i do not want to turn my head and cough, I do not want blood work. Like most everything in my life moderation is my practice. My weakness for ice cream may be the worst health decision. Unable to partake in heavy exercise because of my injuries has left me a bit on the heavy side. I can stand to loose 20-30lbs. I do some meditation and light stretching daily. I garden year round but my son does any heavy lifting and/or digging, etc.. I walk my dog daily about 1/2 mile. With rests this takes approximately an hr depending on weather and fun. I say if it is not broke do not fix. RIGHT?

Still, my so-called max heart rate is 175. I can barely get my heart rate to 140 even as I'm working out so hard that I'm gasping for breath.

It's not a preventative medication; it's a preventative physical training program. A healthy low RHR is a great status symbol that no one can buy just with money.Example: My heart compresses about 16,380 times in seven hours of normal sleep. A non-fit \"normal\" man's heart beats 29,400 times in the same seven hours of sleeping. That's 13,020 more compressions needed for him during the short seven hours of 24 hrs per day. In just one month's of sleep time his resting heart beats 390,600 more than mine. Make it a lif"
