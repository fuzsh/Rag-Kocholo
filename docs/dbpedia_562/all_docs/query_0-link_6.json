Looks fairly tall but idk about over 6'0 as some comments say. 6'0 1/2 morning maybe?\n\nSlim1.75m said on 21/May/23\n\n@Rob Gustin,Lentner,Cavanagh,Wesley Shipp who would be the tallest.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nShipp probably lost a fraction by now. I think Gustin holds up well with\n\nthose guys, really close call.\n\nBroussard077 said on 18/May/23\n\nAccurateâ¦a honest six footer\n\nTopal Brusky said on 2/May/23\n\nAt most he is 5'10.5 as he is 4 inches shorter than 6'2.5 Brandon Routh and almost an inch shorter than Tyler Hoechlin. Looks like a 6 footer but in reality at most he is 5'10.5.\n\nSlim1.75m said on 1/May/23\n\n@ Alex Schoenberger\n\nAmell had in 2020 while filming Heels Cracked his T10 & L1 vertebrae It wouldn't surprise me if that knocked a fraction from Amell's height as mentioned on his page.\n\nAlex Schoenberger said on 27/Apr/23\n\nAt first I would of said after watching the flash for 8 years I would of gave him 6ft flat but watching season 8 and some of 9 I thought he seemed a bit above 6ft with newest episode of flash season 9 Stephen Anel came back and minus the time amell had boots on when they both suited up looked at each other I thought grant was 6ft .25-35 range all day same footwear too I think we under guessed for awhile !\n\nSlim1.75m said on 7/Apr/23\n\nHey Rob how much does he weight now I think in the last couple year he put on at least 10lbs.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI'd have guessed in 165 zone\n\nSlim1.75m said on 29/Mar/23\n\nProbably be just 5'11 or 5'10Â¾ if his neck wasn't so long.\n\nJawilder said on 14/Feb/23\n\nYeah heâs a legit 6 footer.\n\nCanson said on 13/Feb/23\n\nDefinitely doesnât look under 6â0 physically. He could even look taller because of the head\n\nSavagetez said on 10/Feb/23\n\nIf you had to list Grant Gustin at 6'0.25 or 5'11.75 what would you list him at? Personally I think 5'11.75-6'0 is more likely than 6'0-6'0.25.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI'm happy with the 6ft listing.\n\nSavagetez said on 10/Feb/23\n\n5'11.75-6'0.25 0r 5'11.875-6'0.125\n\nSavagetez said on 9/Feb/23\n\nRob what is highest and lowest height you would list Grant Gustin at?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nJust under to just over 6ft.\n\nAbdulrahman said on 12/Jan/23\n\n6â1\n\nAlex Schoenberger said on 22/Nov/22\n\nIâd say grant is between 6ft .5 -6ft .35 when he wakes up and heâs one of those people who keeps there height more I think heâs probs 6ft or 5 11.5 at night lowest\n\nJawilder said on 9/Nov/22\n\nRob is goated for this upgrade. 6 feet is perfect.\n\nMalcolm Oliver said on 17/Oct/22\n\nYeah, Gustin looks the full 6ft most of the time.\n\nawkward guy said on 3/Oct/22\n\nfinally correct listing. strong 6' man.\n\nAntoniodagreat89 said on 2/Oct/22\n\nRob you upgraded him but why?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nThe few remaining 1/8ths I have been changing and from watching last season of Flash I feel given the footwear he has, 6ft could be fair.\n\nDJ C said on 2/Oct/22\n\nSeems right. Good upgrade for Grant!\n\nMost Legit 6'3 said on 29/Sep/22\n\nAt the very least 6â. I can see him as being as tall as 6â0.5 honestly. Maybe heâs just like me where since heâs quite lean people assume he is 2-3â taller than he actually is.\n\nAbdul-177DK said on 29/Sep/22\n\n183\n\nberta said on 27/Sep/22\n\ni cant believe a peak ford is more than half inch taller than this guy. this guy 6 feet. and ford a fraction taller.\n\nAntoniodagreat89 said on 10/Sep/22\n\nClick Here\n\nHe look taller than smell so somethingâs off with their heights\n\nEditor Rob\n\nAmell looks like he's bending at the knees there, usually Amell looks taller than Grant.\n\nSlim1.75m said on 8/Sep/22\n\nRob between Ackles & Gustin who would have the edge.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nMay turn out you'd need to measure them to confirm it as both could fall within a narrow range of near 6ft.\n\nSlim1.75m said on 8/Sep/22\n\nWell if you think he's that close to 6'0 then give it to him I think he'd edge Jensen Ackles although at times both can seem a weak 6'0\n\nSlim1.75m said on 7/Sep/22\n\nHey Rod he should be 6'0 or 5'11Â¾ you said that unless someone claims a height in 8ths then 4th is the smallest fraction you'd go.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nAs I mentioned not long ago on Hayden's page, I have been changing any of the remaining random 1/8ths and for Grant, maybe I'll decide on 11.75 or 6ft...from watching season 8 of Flash the 6ft could well be argued.\n\nSlim1.75m said on 29/Jul/22\n\nI think he's the same height as Biden current listing 5'11 â  also in that photo with Routh & Amell I thought he struggled to look 6'0.\n\nSlim1.75m said on 29/Jul/22\n\nI think he's the same height as Biden current listing 5'11 â .\n\nVick said on 29/Jul/22\n\nHey Rob,\n\nCould he still be 6â0 4 hours up?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nThat is a distinct possibility\n\nNlechoppa179 said on 28/Jul/22\n\nWith Brandon Routh he looked 5ft 10\n\nEric W Tam said on 16/Jun/22\n\nSeeing he claims 6'1 or 6'2, he'd be fuming if he saw he's listed pedantically as a cell's width shy of 6'.\n\nthatmanoverthere said on 9/May/22\n\nRob, what height do you think Grantâs height is at an extreme low? 5 11.75?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nHe might not fall much under that mark at a low\n\nTech noir said on 11/Apr/22\n\n6-2??? Heâs sub 6-0.\n\nBluefish said on 14/Mar/22\n\n5'11.5\" Needs a downgrade. Amell looks over an inch taller than Grant.\n\n(Billythetreesurgeon) said on 11/Feb/22\n\n6.1 - 6.2 was pushing it far more than it should of been pushed\n\nSlim 6'0.25 said on 6/Feb/22\n\nHeâs not sickly thin but his lanky build makes him look taller\n\nSlim 6'0.25 said on 6/Feb/22\n\nMore 5â11 5/8ths\n\nAmell is 2cm taller than him\n\nMarquis Hicks said on 6/Jan/22\n\nI think he is 6ft.\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 20/Dec/21\n\nChaoscontrol 6'2.75/190cm said on 17/Dec/21\n\nWhatâs infuriating is heâs listed this based on estimation but thereâs some listings like Anthony Davis where they measured something else and Rob didnât change it\n\nRob has said that he wanted to go easy with the eighth listings.....\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI know it sounds bizarre, but there are some people who may not quite stand as tall as they can for a measurement. For a while I considered Davis as a potential for such a scenario...\n\n\"Height in reserve\" is the term I'd apply to it.\n\nChaoscontrol 6'2.75/190cm said on 17/Dec/21\n\nWhatâs infuriating is heâs listed this based on estimation but thereâs some listings like Anthony Davis where they measured something else and Rob didnât change it\n\nSami 178 said on 17/Dec/21\n\nDude just put 6â man\n\nSeal said on 31/Oct/21\n\nMost of these people here are so biased towards him. He's NO WAY as tall as 6ft 1-2. To me, he looked around an inch shorter than 6ft 0.75 Stephen Amell. He looks taller because of his slim build. I'd give him 5ft 11.75. Well guess that's not an option. Then I give him 5ft 11 5/8\n\nhimmy said on 27/Oct/21\n\nWhat? 5'11 and 7/8s?? Why so specific and how is 1/8 of an inch even noticeable? Help me understand please\n\nSlim 6'1.75 said on 11/Oct/21\n\nYeah from what some people have seen in flash\n\n182-182.5 is fine for gustin but dastmalchan should get a 6â0 7/8ths downgrade\n\nSlim 6'1.75 said on 21/Sep/21\n\nBen, thatâs just my writing style\n\n6ft is high average but I now believe tall starts at 6â1-6â2\n\nGrant is 182-182.5\n\nAmell would have gustin by at least 2cm\n\nAnd Brandon routh had gustin by close to 3 inches\n\nSlim 6'1.75 said on 21/Sep/21\n\nlol if grant is 6â1-6â2 that would make rob 5â10-5â11\n\nSlim 6'1.5\" said on 24/Aug/21\n\nBen, sorry to bother you. Thatâs just my style\n\nI think tall is either 6ft or 6â1\n\nIâm a really practical guy thatâs probably why\n\nGrant isnât actually 6ft heâs just shy of the mark at 182\n\nð\n\nIâll try to stop â\n\nBen - 6'0 said on 13/Aug/21\n\n@ Slim 6'1.5\"\n\nLol not long ago you were saying on the Hayden Christensen page that he was proof that 6â was the start of tall.\n\nGrant Austin is American and the average height for men in America is 5â9, so 6ft would absolutely be tall.\n\nI see your comments all the time on nearly every page, and the way you talk about your opinions as if theyâre facts is kind of annoying, I have to be honest.\n\nSeal said on 10/Aug/21\n\nYo rob, I know Grant Gustin is 100% not 6'2 like he says he is. But do you think Grant Gustin wearing the flash suit would measure 6ft 2?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI'm not sure how much space there is within the crown area of his helmet/mask, but I suppose he might measure with footwear and helmet over 6ft 1\n\nElene said on 5/Aug/21\n\nDefinitely about 182 183 cm canât see 184 or more for him,but 181 is too low,itâs my opinion.\n\nSeal said on 4/Aug/21\n\nListing seems about accurate Rob. Seems about right since Tom Cavanagh edged him by a little bit. He's definitely not 6'2. That would make Rob 5'10-11 lol\n\nSlim 6'1.5\" said on 24/Jul/21\n\n183-184 is only earlier in the day not at his low\n\nGrant was and never will be 6ft+\n\nAlso I donât see 6ft as tall anymore, 6â1â is the start of tall\n\nJake Cam said on 21/Jun/21\n\nWayyyyy off. Def over 6'0. Just bad posture\n\nshweta said on 13/Jun/21\n\n6 feet max not more than that\n\nSlim 6'1.5 said on 3/Jun/21\n\nGrant has a chance to be 184.5-185 out of bed\n\n5'11.5 guy said on 1/Jun/21\n\n@Slim 6'1.5\n\nBut if the person is 6'0.5 in the morning and 5'11.75 at night I would consider him 6'0.\n\nSlim 6'1.5 said on 23/May/21\n\n183 earlier in the day but 182 at his usual low\n\nIan Vector said on 13/May/21\n\nHe is not 6â 2â. Iâd say 5â 11.5â.\n\nEusebiu - 6'1\" (185 cm) said on 29/Apr/21\n\nAfter rewatching the whole Flash series I paid close attention to every possible detail regarding his height and how well he holds up when standing next to actors in his height range or taller.\n\nI must admit that he gives the impression of a tall guy, especially in his Flash suit - this might be due to his lanky body as well.\n\nI can see him at 6'1\" (185 cm) in shoes but his 6'2\" (188 cm) claim is way off - although in the whole Flash series he is listed at 6'2\" (188 cm) and he even claims it on every ocassion he gets (interviews, conventions, TV series, etc.) - I mean, rounding up a bit is something normal but inflating so much is just ridiculous.\n\nAlso, I noticed that he tends to slouch a lot when standing and posing with other celebrities - this thing can make him look shorter then he really is.\n\nFor example, he is a little shorter then Stephen Amell and Jesse L. Martin (both listed 185 cm) but also, he looks almost identical in height with Tom Cavanagh and John Wesley Shipp (both listed 183 cm).\n\nI can see why he is currently listed at slightly under 6'0\" (182,6 cm) but considering that he slouches a lot, I tend to believe that he doesn't give too much attention to his posture and height.\n\nAll in all, I believe it is justified to give him the full 6'0\" (183 cm).\n\nSlim 6'1.5 said on 19/Apr/21\n\n184.5-185 out of bed\n\n182-182.5 before bed\n\nJust missed out on the mighty 6ft mark liek Jensen ackles and Chris evans\n\nDom5'11.5 said on 14/Apr/21\n\n6â and change. 183.5cm, same as Robert Pattinson\n\nJasmine Wells said on 30/Mar/21\n\nI think he should be at least at 6f 1|4\n\nChaos Control 6'2.5 said on 21/Mar/21\n\nEusebiu (185 cm) said on 19/Mar/21\n\nFirst of all, I noticed that his height is being listed on different web sites from 183 cm up to 188 cm which I find ridiculous, same as his claiming.\n\nHaha if those 188 listings exist Iâm a strong 6â4\n\nEusebiu (185 cm) said on 19/Mar/21\n\nFirst of all, I noticed that his height is being listed on different web sites from 183 cm up to 188 cm which I find ridiculous, same as his claiming.\n\nIn The Flash series he is clearly shorter then Stephen Amell which Rob listed at 185 cm.\n\nSecondly, here is a photo with him and Chris Evans (183 cm) and although we can not see their footwear and Grant is slouching a bit, Chris still edges him out.\n\nClick Here\n\nAll in all, I can not see him taller then 182,5 cm.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI don't think that is a legit photo, but more one of those manipulations.\n\nALEXIZ/180cm said on 19/Mar/21\n\n182 cm max\n\nProgking184 said on 14/Mar/21\n\n184.5 morning, 182.5 night makes sense, I think he's 6'0 at least for the most of the day\n\nSteven Stinson said on 20/Feb/21\n\nRob how much does his Hair add\n\nEditor Rob\n\ncan vary a little, but near 3/4 inch at times\n\nslim 6'1 said on 28/Jan/21\n\n2cm between amell and this guy ð\n\nslim 6'1 said on 18/Jan/21\n\n182-182.5cm not the full 6â but nearly there!\n\nBroussard077 said on 13/Jan/21\n\nI'll say 6 foot and 1/8\n\nVincent Caleb said on 10/Jan/21\n\nI would have guessed him as a six footer.\n\nbird in box said on 9/Jan/21\n\nhandsome guy. he is looking 6'2 but i think he is solid 6'.\n\nslim 6'1 said on 5/Jan/21\n\nStephen amell barely scrapes him yet we consider amell tall and this guy average\n\nSlim 6'1\" said on 31/Dec/20\n\nAs listed â\n\nSlim 6'1\" said on 24/Dec/20\n\nPhotos next to Brandon routh bury the 6â+ grant gustin rumour\n\nSlim 6'1\" said on 16/Dec/20\n\nSorry guys Gustin isnât 6â\n\n182cm like Patrick j adams\n\nThe Boss said on 12/Dec/20\n\nGrant deserve to be in the 6ft gang\n\nJ2Frenzy said on 18/Nov/20\n\n@Christoan (sorry, I meant Christian) yeah it was just human error. Iâm doing this from a phone\n\nChristian 6'5 3/8\" said on 17/Nov/20\n\n@J2\n\nFunny how you were going in on Vincent for misspelling your name, but yet you're here calling me \"Christoan\", lol.

I think that Rob really should bump him up! And in photos with Ezra Miller as the flash, Grant is wearing flats and Ezra has at least 1.2 inches advantage due to his boots and large cowel!\n\nNik said on 18/Jan/20\n\n575 eighths of an inch!\n\nChris Junior Hernandez 1990 said on 18/Jan/20\n\n@Jazzy Sorry but had to say you're lying. He is nothing over 6'0 1/8 the best low. I did be protest this 5'11 7/8 listing were too low but over 6'1 for him is awfully negative. Rob def under listed him a bit but he isn't even 6'1 1/2 with normal shoes if your 6'1 claim atually mean it with shoes. Grant is solid 6'0 and 6'1-6'1 1/8 with normal pair of shoes on but could consider he is 6'1 1/2 with boots on.\n\nHawk said on 18/Jan/20\n\n@Jazzy He's not 6ft1 because he's not taller than Stephen Amell (look at their actual pictures together) In flash and arrow he can appear taller because of angles but google real life pictures when they're at gatherings and it's evident Grant is shorter by at least an inch. Stephen Amell is listed on this site as almost 6ft1 which makes sense because he had slight height advantage on michael Jai white in their scenes on arrow (Michael Jai white is 6.05ft). This means that Ezra miller is either 6ft1 or the suit he was wearing gives him height advantage of a few cms because he really should have been the same height as Grant since he claims 5'11.\n\nAlso when was the last time you measured yourself? Maybe you're not 6ft1 anymore.\n\nVsquad said on 17/Jan/20\n\n@Jazzy\n\nEither you weren't standing straight, or I hate to break it to you: but you're not 6'1.\n\nGrant isn't even taller than Stephen Amell, who only claims as high as 6'1. And Grant looks 3 inches shorter than Brandon Routh who is 6'2.\n\nAgain, either you weren't standing straight in your photo with him or you're really not 6'1.\n\nI can't ask you to go measure yourself and check, because I've asked that before on this site and people will lie regardless (I don't mean that as an attack to you, there's just a few liars on this site so it's hard to trust unfortunately).\n\nJazzy said on 16/Jan/20\n\nHi bob, I met Grant Gustin in real life and Iâm 6â1, when I got my picture with him we were both wearing the exact same shoes, which is kind of ironic but we shared a good laugh of it I. And when I looked over at the picture he was at least half an inch taller then me. And we were both standing straight with good posture. Which means that he must be at least 6â 1ââ!\n\nDiego Inostroza said on 15/Jan/20\n\nSince i watched the appearence of the DCEU Flash in the crossover last night. I Think Ezra is about 5'11 ft tall and Grant Gustin is about 6 ft tall. it's common knowledge Ezra is 180 cm tall. And i think he looked taller thanks to his boots. For other hand, we have seen many times Grant Gustin next to Stephen Amell, who's 6'1 ft tall.\n\nColben said on 15/Jan/20\n\nOk so the pics of Ezra and Grant make Ezra look taller actually. Not sure how their suits/footwear affect their heights, but is Ezra really 180cm and Grant 183cm?\n\nVsquad said on 15/Jan/20\n\nEzra Miller appeared in the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" crossover today. His whole scene was with Gustin. In it as well as in some BTS photos that Grant shared on Instagram, Ezra edges him out.\n\nEzra only claims as high as 5'11. Not sure what that means for Grant.\n\njack walsh said on 25/Nov/19\n\nRob do you truly think Carl Froch would measure higher and do you think if you met grant, you would be more likely to upgrade him or downgrade him?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nBased on how he looked in The Flash I still feel near enough 6ft, but I wouldn't give him over 6ft, maybe one day he will turn up in the UK!.\n\nLirilusk said on 20/Nov/19\n\nHey rob I just wanna ask is his range what you would consider \"a weak 6'\"?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nAt times I've thought that, but I think he is very close to 6ft.\n\nFez said on 23/Oct/19\n\n@Editor Rob,\n\nHey Rob, Have u looked at Nolan Gerard Funk Yet?\n\nI think around 5'11.25-11.5\" range (181-2cm) is reasonable, probably not a Big 6fter.\n\nWhat do u think Rob?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nNolan looks to be slightly shorter than Grant, he does have a bigger head though which actually can make him appear a 5ft 10-11 guy proportionally at times.\n\nTheBat said on 9/Oct/19\n\nCan't believe he claimed was between 6'1\" and 6'2\", he's 5'11.75\"-6'0.25\".\n\nGyro said on 23/Sep/19\n\nI know Brandon Routh more recently claimed to be 6'3, which obviously isn't true, but even if it was he still looks 4 inches taller than Grant in literally every picture of them together. It's odd.\n\nImporter said on 18/Sep/19\n\n@Jackson thatâs not a good photo to gauge their heights. Gustin has the worst posture out of the 3\n\nJackson said on 15/Sep/19\n\nOkay.... how the heck does he have the nerve to claim between 6â1â and 6â2â and then look like this next to 6â2.5â Brandon Routh?! He is being towered over.\n\nClick Here\n\nHe looks 5â10â\n\nmickey243 said on 14/Sep/19\n\nimporter, how the hell do you know that he isn't 5ft11 from looking at a photo of him? \"that's not how a 5ft11 guy looks like\" people of all heights come in all kinds of shapes. there are narrow and lanky 5ft6 guys and wide, burly 6ft6s.\n\nmickey243 said on 14/Sep/19\n\nis he really that height and claims 6ft1-2...? he says he's 4cm taller than he actually is? that's crazy. not like he's a short guy. it's this human characteristic. we always want more than we have.\n\ndaad1234 said on 1/Sep/19\n\nHis proportions alone suggest he is nothing below six feet.\n\nVino said on 11/Aug/19\n\nI reckon he's 5'11 1/2 or 5/11 3/4. But not 6'0; in most pictures with Tom Cavanaugh, he looks an inch shorter-- and bare in mind grant has puffy hair, giving him a boost. Grant is definitely not 6'0.\n\nJunior Hernandez 1990 said on 30/Jun/19\n\n@Johan 185 cm Posture, footwear and camera angle all places advantage over Brandon side. If you watch Arrow few episode he can look 5'11 7/8 with 6'0.75\" Stephen Amell face to face and problem is Grant had 3/8 inch lesser footwear advantage. I would rule out 6'0 1/8 like Hayden Christensen not under 6'0.\n\nJohan 185 cm said on 22/Jun/19\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nYou upgraded him to basically 6 foot?\n\n^ Next to legit 6'2.5\" Brandon Routh who you met Rob.

Amell needs a downgrade seriously :/\n\nPAN BERRY said on 11/Dec/18\n\nRob I think heâs 6â0â or maybe even more, I used to doubt him but heâs been looking same if not a bit more to Steven Amell so I would say 183-183.5 cm seems a good possibility to Grant, I hope you get a chance to meet him someday\n\nAnthony089 said on 10/Dec/18\n\nIn the cross over that came on yesterday Barry looked taller than Oliver in most scenes it's time for a upgrade Rob...what do you think?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI haven't seen that episode, but I looked at a clip of them and I think the camera was closer to Grant...in older episodes he looked shorter than Stephen.\n\nAnthony089 said on 8/Dec/18\n\nI'll take back my earlier theory I think he's 6'0.25 -6'0 1/2\n\nJunior Hernandez 1990 said on 20/Nov/18\n\nI won't be surprised again to say Rob will upgrade him 6'0 when he got the chance met him in person. Few of my friends have met him thought between 6'0-6'0 1/2. My guess he look solid 6'0.\n\nRick1 said on 15/Nov/18\n\nWhy 7/8 ? How can you really even tell that? Why not just say 6ft\n\nEditor Rob\n\nHe might have measured that mark, and since people copy heights from here to other sites, at least they won't copy a 7/8th ð±\n\nTheBat said on 7/Nov/18\n\nAround 6'0\".\n\nChangeName said on 22/Oct/18\n\nWith this height thereâs no issue just claiming 6â0 but itâs cheeky for him to even go near 6â1 let alone 6â2\n\nJunior Hernandez 1990 said on 28/Aug/18\n\nNot surprise if Gustin stand out above Neal McDonough. Gustin look solid 6'0 next to Routh.\n\nWestworlder said on 20/Jul/18\n\nRob, how many cm apart would you estimate are between Gustin and Amell? With both of their listings you definitely wouldn't say its the full inch/2.5 cm? Because sometimes it does look like the full 2.5 cm between them and then some...\n\nEditor Rob\n\nAt times it seems 2 up to 3cm\n\nAlpeat said on 11/Jul/18\n\nRob how much do you think he weighs? Internet says 165. But he looks some where in the 150s. 155lbs maybe?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nIn the past he might have been 150 but maybe managed to add a few more pounds.\n\nMAD SAM said on 3/Jul/18\n\n6â claim would be fine but this guy has gone as far as claiming himself at 6â2â so we gotta sort out his real height ... Amell is 1.5 inches taller to him and Brendon is 3.5 inches taller, this guy is 5â11.25â max at 181 cm\n\nJunior Hernandez 1990 said on 2/Jul/18\n\nStephen Amell always had 1/4 or 3/8 more advantage on his boots than Grant on Arrow and The Flash. If Amell is 6'0.75\" i hardly see Grant Gustin under 6'0.\n\nBobby said on 11/Jun/18\n\nSo, now Grant is being listed 5'11 and 7/8s, he may as well be 6ft then.\n\nWestworlder said on 7/Jun/18\n\nI mean look at this. Come on. Amell only claims as high as 6'1 as well... -\n\nClick Here\n\nLennox said on 2/Jun/18\n\nRob, I'm as tall as Grant. Can I claim 6 ft?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI think any guy who was almost 6ft is likely to say 6 foot...a rather small proportion might say 'almost' 6ft though.\n\nJunior Hernandez 1990 said on 27/May/18\n\nGrant is more like 6'0 1/8 than 5'11 1/2 or 5'11 7/8. Brandon Routh lowest i believe its not over or under a flat 189cm and there were only 2.25\" range between them.\n\nSajjad said on 4/May/18\n\nHe looks like Andrew Garfield...I think He is 5\"11\n\nCraig said on 1/May/18\n\nWhy wouldnt you just list him at 6 feet tall. How is it even possible to pinpoint 1/8th of an inch on somebody if you havent measured them yourself.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nMaybe he was measured at that mark...\n\nDejavu said on 27/Apr/18\n\nHe can look more than 2 inches shorter than Brandon Routh.\n\nres said on 26/Apr/18\n\nLol he isn't even 182.6 cm. He is about 181.5 cm. He is shorter in every shot than the dude that plays reverse flash in season 1 and 2. Both of them wearing always flat shoes. The guy is listed as 182 cm. Also Gustin compared with 1.79 cm dudes he barely look 1 cm taller, though having footwear disadvantage.\n\nNik said on 26/Mar/18\n\nThis is a fair do's listing for Grant Gustin!\n\nCodfather said on 13/Mar/18\n\nRob,is this listing his absolute low?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI'm not sure I'd call it absolute low, but I think overall he can probably measure near 6ft for a portion of the day.\n\nThunderfin said on 11/Feb/18\n\nI'm 5'11.5 and claim max 6'. How can a sub 6 footer claim 6'1-2?\n\nAnthony089 said on 27/Jan/18\n\nLooks a tad over 6'0 with Goldberg ...what do you think Rob?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nThere are certainly occasions in which Grant can look an honest six footer, but other times I think just under it suits him.\n\nAAAA said on 25/Jan/18\n\nWith Goldberg. Looks closer than I expected\n\nClick Here\n\nDJ C said on 25/Jan/18\n\nI think he needs to be upgraded back to the 6'0 listing. Next to Bill Goldberg who you have listed at 6'2. They were an inch apart at the most. His 6'1-6'2 claim is obviously with shoes and hair. Barefoot, he's 6'0.\n\nPaul NS (6ft0.5) said on 24/Jan/18\n\nExcellent ð\n\nPaul NS (6ft0.5) said on 23/Jan/18\n\nRob, are you going to update the Compare My Height page to show fractions? Grant looks a little awkward with his 5'11.875 listing.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nYes, it's on my list!\n\nAndrea said on 21/Jan/18\n\nIsn't 5'11 7/8 a bit too \"cheeky\", Rob? I mean, I understand you listing some athletes to the 1/8 inch if they were measured around very precise marks, but \"normal\" celebrities? Hmm... I think it's already hard enough to guess them within quarter inches, to be honest. Speaking of Grant, he may well be as tall as his new listing, but the old 5'11.75 listing I think was already good enough. Last time I had a look at him I thought that anywhere between 5'11.5 and 6' was possible, so 5'11.75 perfectly covered that range, IMO.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI think the odd exceptions are ok, but I'm not going to be using it that often.\n\nSD(171CM) said on 21/Jan/18\n\nA-lot of people think that he's 6'2 Click Here\n\nIn Season 4 Episode 10,he's character The Flash/Barry Allen has his mugshot taken...\n\nClick Here Front side\n\nClick Here Side view\n\nClick Here Barry Allen's driving license...says 6'2\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\n@Editor Rob is it possible that he measured his height with his hair hence the reason he thinks he's 6'2 but he's actually 6'0 flat...\n\nkash said on 20/Jan/18\n\nWhat's difficult is that Grant so often leans while Stephen Amell stands up totally straight; although I will say that the leaning is a habit of people used to being taller than those around them (Click Here)\n\nDefinitely not the 6'2\" he claims, but if Amell is near 6'1\", I can see Grant being an even 6'. For example, Amell's footwear looks to have the height advantage here (Click Here) but they're near matched at the shoulders.\n\nAgent Orange said on 20/Jan/18\n\nHeâs so close to 6âft he could honestly claim it .... anything above would be contentious .\n\ngrowtallerguru said on 19/Jan/18\n\nI think he is 6'0.125\" He looks to have the same stature as Ryan Gosling.

This is the footwear Click Here\n\nEditor Rob\n\nskull cap and shoes probably not enough to take him to 6ft 2, but between 6ft 1-2 yes.\n\nAnonymous said on 9/Dec/17\n\nnow we know that grant is actually 5.11,75\n\nin the flash he with shoes, low angle to look higher his head reaches 6, strange is that on the barry ID card he is listed with 6.2 in the flash, this explains teddy sears say that it is actually 6 , 4 in the flash, but we know that Teddy is only 6.3, so the grant does not even come to 6\n\nggmb said on 7/Dec/17\n\ngrant is 6ft 2\n\nJack said on 5/Dec/17\n\nLooks like he is over 6ft 1 inches in shoes from this picture Click Here\n\nAlso I have realised that google brought him down to 1.85 metres\n\nClick Here\n\nWhat do you think rob? , Upgrade to 1.84? Since those scenes could have been shot in the morning and take away vans sole height.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI couldn't really see him at 184cm, although I'm sure at times he might seem that tall.\n\nYou could certainly make the 6ft flat case as being possible.\n\nAlex 6'3 said on 25/Nov/17\n\nGustin that say is around 6'2 make understand how much celebrities like to inflate their heights. Around 182 cm is right for him.\n\nBoy said on 24/Nov/17\n\nHey rob . I am 5ft 10.5 inches . How short would i look if compared to grant ?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nyou might look within an inch if you appeared on The Flash wearing a shoe and Grant in a converse.\n\nNik said on 20/Nov/17\n\n5'11.75' is about right for him!\n\nNull said on 16/Nov/17\n\nThis is his minimum height. He's a little under 6 feet average. Maybe 6 feet and a half in the mornings but I don't know. Stephen Amell is a little under 6ft 1 but not by a lot. Gustin has thinner shoes usually\n\nAnonymous said on 8/Nov/17\n\nAmell - 6'0.5\"/ 184.2 cm.\n\nGustin - 5'11.75\"/ 182.2 cm.\n\nThis is true, guys.\n\nJunior said on 7/Nov/17\n\n@Luker\n\nOn the show The Flash/Arrow Amell had bigger boots wear than Gustin at least 0.4-0.6\" advantage. Amell can look about an inch on Gustin with those boots but more to reality is not even full inch between them and i\"ll rule out 1.5cm different. Amell could be 184.5cm and Gustin more of a legit 183cm.\n\nLuker said on 5/Nov/17\n\nWith Amell being a weak 6'1/strong 6 fter, I think people need to consider this listing for Grant more seriously. Amell's eye level ALWAYS looks down on his big head. There shouldn't be so much second guessing here.\n\nJunior said on 4/Nov/17\n\n@Editor Rob @grizz\n\nIts a hard guessing he look next to legit 6'5.5\" Rick Fox. Gustin may fool some people thinks that he is 5'11.75\" range because most of time he wear converse, vans sneakers that shorten how he could look next to others. I wouldn't go lower than 183cm for him but 6'2 claim was inflating it. Is ok if Gustin plan to claim 6'1 most probably get away with 6'0.5\".\n\ngrizz said on 30/Oct/17\n\n@Junior, Click Here , yeah, this is exactly how it looks when self-billed 6'2 man interacts with another self-billed 6'2 guy. LMAO, pathetic how Gustin gets away with his claim. This is why, thanks to men like Gustin, people buy the myth that Dutch people are on average 185 cm tall.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nwith Rick Fox who might be losing half inch more, I think 6ft 1-2 is hard to believe for Grant.\n\nberta said on 29/Oct/17\n\nhe really looks short next to brandon routh. funny thy claim 6 foot 2 and there is atleast 3 inches beetween them\n\nSlim 6' said on 28/Oct/17\n\nGrant Gustin had Melissa Benoist by 5.75\"-6 inches. This would make Melissa 5'5.75\"-5'6\" or grant Gustin 6'-6'0.25\".\n\nMoncomery said on 28/Oct/17\n\n5'11.75\" is okay for him but nothing more.\n\nJunior said on 23/Oct/17\n\nCheck out this link image. This is tallest Gustin look with a legit 6'2.5\" Brandon Routh in it. I did say he look 6'0.5\" here but most of time he only look legit 6'0.\n\nClick Here:\n\nSlim 6' said on 21/Oct/17\n\nHe's had Melissa Benoist by 5.5-6 inches.\n\nMr child said on 19/Oct/17\n\nI think 6ft in the morning for sure\n\nSlim 6' said on 17/Oct/17\n\nHe could stretch to 182.5-183.1 without a problem. Needs a 6' upgrade.\n\nI know I'll get teased for this comment but anywhere between 182-184 is arguable. Nothing under this listing. Great actor btw.\n\nBobby said on 5/Oct/17\n\n@Igmus, Grant would clear 6ft in the morning, at least by half an inch.\n\nBobby said on 5/Oct/17\n\nI would argue that Grant is a flat six foot. There's no way he's under that.\n\nJohns said on 26/Sep/17\n\nGustin can't even edge Amell with his lanky frame. And he got dwarfed by Routh. He is not a hair over 183 AT MOST.\n\n181-182 for sure. Absolutely tired of 5'11 guys claiming 6'0 - 6'2.\n\nSlim said on 31/Aug/17\n\nHe'll edge out Christian Bale as well.\n\nSlim183 said on 30/Aug/17\n\nMark(5'9.5\") said on 27/Aug/17\n\nThe old 6'0\" listing worked. He wears light converses that he doesn't always stand out. However, he's usually is similar to Cavanagh (a true 6'0\"er) even with light converse.\n\n*******\n\nAlso, a quarter of an inch is more than just puzzling to recognise. ð\n\nMark(5'9.5\") said on 27/Aug/17\n\nThe old 6'0\" listing worked. He wears light converses that he doesn't always stand out. However, he's usually is similar to Cavanagh (a true 6'0\"er) even with light converse.\n\nHe's definitely taller than Justin Timberlake\n\nSlim183 said on 23/Aug/17\n\n6'' would be the absolute max. I need to see more of him though.\n\nJohan said on 22/Aug/17\n\nJunior said on 18/Aug/17\n\n@Johan\n\nSometimes Grant had less footwear most of time taking picture with Amell and Tom Cavanagh. Cavanagh often wear boots in Flash, i did say that he is not over 6'0 and Grant have tendency wear flat sneakers. I've watch enough episode of The Flash and Arrow i see Amell boots is still bigger heeled than Grant Flash boots, when they both had similar footwear they're very close in height like 0.75\" sometimes maybe an inch but not more. I did go with 6'0-6'0.25\" for Grant Gustin as Stephen Amell listed 6'1. 6'0 is high chance trust me.\n\n--------\n\nClick Here\n\nEqual footwear bit of a camera disadvantage but clearly 3\" under 6'2.5\" Brandon Routh and Amell can look 6'0.5\" alot like here. No converse excuses now.\n\nMark(5'9.5\") said on 21/Aug/17\n\nHe has flat sneakers a lot.\n\nJunior said on 18/Aug/17\n\n@Johan\n\nSometimes Grant had less footwear most of time taking picture with Amell and Tom Cavanagh.

In most pics they are identical.\n\nTwo guys confirmed by Rob on the site that buries 6 foot + Grant Gustin.\n\nJunior said on 13/Aug/17\n\nGrant look little over 183cm to me\n\nGwen said on 10/Aug/17\n\nEnough with the downgrading, he is clearly at least 6ft, I'd say over 6ft. People are so quick to downgrade everyone\n\nSlim 182 cm said on 7/Aug/17\n\nTBH rob, he measures 182.88 cm to me concretely, like ed norton in fight club, grant doesn't really have any muscle to hold up his torso and neck, leading him to slouch and look shorter. And grant wears converse while playing Barry and Stephen wears those combat boots, what else!? So annoyed that they haven't released flash to netflix Aus. I judge from his arrow appearances btw.\n\nJohn said on 19/Jul/17\n\nHe consistently looks an inch to an inch and a half shorter than 6'1 Stephen Amell in pictures. This is a good listing for him. No freaking way is he 6'2.\n\nJohan said on 18/Jul/17\n\nJesse L martin is noticeably taller than him and I struggle to believe the 6'1.25\" listing here. He was no taller than Wentworth Miller who we now know is no more than 6'0.75\". So I would say this listing is tops but its a good height for the character 1/4 inch off is nothing.\n\nS.J.H said on 18/Jul/17\n\n@Slim 182 cm\n\nBut if Gustin stay on this listing here with no change then Amell is not over 6'0.5 , he really look solid 6'0 with all his co-star more i look at him. He often wear sneakers that give 2cm or less in The Flash. 6'0 is more possible than 5'11.5-11.75 range. I think Stephen Amell is just a little weak 6'1 like 6'0.75 just like we see it 0.75 (2cm) between them.\n\nSlim 182 cm said on 18/Jul/17\n\nAnimus. Either that or 155 pounds.\n\nAnimus said on 17/Jul/17\n\nA skinny six-footer. He is probably about 160lb, so he can appear taller proportion-wise.\n\nIgmus said on 16/Jul/17\n\nThis is so weird. I could've sworn he was 6'2\". Still he's probably 6'0\" in the morning\n\nSlim 182 cm said on 6/Jul/17\n\n@S.J.H, great minds think alike.\n\nStephens definitely 184-185 so that makes grant 182-183, which sounds close to the bullseye!\n\nSlim 181.5 cm said on 6/Jul/17\n\nPerhaps 2 cm between gustin and amell? it's sounds more likely.\n\nS.J.H said on 5/Jul/17\n\n@Slim 181 cm\n\nSeriously only when he wear flat sneakers he look 5'11.5 with Amell, other time they can look close when both in similar footwear but more like 2cm between the two.\n\nSlim 181 cm said on 3/Jul/17\n\nBetween 182 or 183 cm.\n\nSJH, u might be correct given that he always plays \"beta\" wuss characters and stands with poor posture that makes him look shorter cause rob had him listed at 5'11.5 not to long ago.\n\nS.J.H said on 2/Jul/17\n\nIf Rob meet Gustin in real i wouldn't be surprise an upgrade given at 6'0-6'0.25 , getting more seeing him and he look just about 0.75' shorter than Stephen Amell not quite full inch\n\nBobby said on 25/Jun/17\n\n@Theo, I meant his character on the show, not necessarily the character from the comics.\n\nAverage height and slim said on 5/Jun/17\n\n182 cm. ectomorph build and long face make him appear taller.\n\nAlex 6'3 said on 28/May/17\n\nAround 182 cm, same Jensen Ackles hight.\n\nTheo said on 27/May/17\n\n@Bobby Nope, Barry in the comics is 6'0. Grant, for the most part is at fine height for the role.\n\nBobby said on 24/May/17\n\n@Ben, maybe Barry Allen is 6'2, and is meant to be portrayed in that fashion on the show. I mean, a 5'10 actor may end up portraying a 6ft character or so forth.\n\nBobby said on 24/May/17\n\nRob, while watching The Flash yesterday, Grant and Miller seemed to be exactly the same height and I could swear upon my own eyes that Grant even edged out Miller at times. Maybe you should upgrade Grant to the full 6ft?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nhe can pass for 6ft at times, but he does have an inch of hair, while a guy like Miller has 3mm of hair.\n\nSnart said on 22/May/17\n\n1,82, for real? i think he can be 6'2 like he says. seems to be right for me\n\nClick Here\n\nEditor Rob\n\nthey did some scenes on flat floor, I would say Wentworth seemed taller given he has little hair compared to Grant who has an inch worth.\n\nJosh said on 19/May/17\n\nAgain, he may not be the 6'1 and is definitely not the 6'2 he lists himself, but he's 6'0 range. He looks a bit over it a lot of the time too. He and Wentworth are virtually the same height, with maybe half an inch at most between them. Same goes for him against, Tom Cavanagh, Jesse L Martin and John Wesley Shipp. I say he needs to be upgraded back to 6'0.\n\njack said on 17/May/17\n\nRob, in the most recent episode of the flash , grant is clearly taller than wentworth miller (I hope somebody can find shots of this) , strange I know but what if he started wearing normal footwear, and is actual a full 6ft 1inch ?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI've not seen that episode, but I'd be surprised if grant and big Wentworth were similar barefoot.\n\nFlash173cm said on 12/May/17\n\n@Sammy Derrick and @Ben wonderful job guys...I just watched that episode and all I saw was EYE COLOR:GREEN.I hate numbers...I'll agree with both of you he's definitely 6'0(183cm) height is the one of the few strong points plus singing and playing a beta male.\n\nSammy Derrick said on 11/May/17\n\nClick Here =11:12\n\nIn Season 3 episode 21- Bart Allen pulls out his Driver License and it says..\n\nNAME:Allen,Bartholomew Henry\n\nDOB:03/14/1989\n\nSEX:M\n\nHEIGHT:6'2\n\nEYES:GREEN\n\nSorry for nitpicking but I'm a massive fan of the Flash,but why does he(The Flash) need a driver's license?And in the comic books Barry Allen has blue eyes not green and his 5'11 not 6'2.For proof just check: Click Here.\n\nDon't get me wrong Grant Gustin does an INCREDIBLE job and I'm a huge fan but it's my inner fanboy speaking.\n\nBack to height,Grant Gustin can easily look 6'2=long torso,long face,lanky frame but I think he's a strong 6'0(184cm)\n\nBen said on 10/May/17\n\nIn the latest episode of The Flash, it says that Barry is 6'2\"...\n\nWE HAVE TO TEACH THEM ROB THAT GRANT IS NOT 6'2\"!!!\n\nHere's the photo:\n\nClick Here\n\nEditor Rob\n\nbased on that falsehood, I will have strong words with the Flash prop maker! ð¡ð¡\n\njustbringit said on 9/May/17\n\nafter seeing more of him i think 6' might be a weak 6' might be a better listing honestly\n\nMark(5'9.25 said on 30/Apr/17\n\nI think a full 6'0\" would be a better listing. He usually wears light weight converse.\n\nBut I wouldn't go above 6'0\" either.\n\n182-183 cm guy said on 23/Apr/17\n\nLucky,Ä±f he Ä±s 1.80\n\nHeight obsessed child said on 23/Apr/17\n\nIn one instance in the show, Candice Patton is in 3-inch heels, and she comes up to about Grant's eyes, and I'm about six foot, and I have a friend who's five foot seven (which is Candice's height plus the three inches), and he comes up to about my eyes, so I'd say he's around six foot, give or take about half an inch. Which, in shoes would be close to six one, so maybe he just measured with shoes on.\n\ntravis said on 17/Apr/17\n\nnot 6'1 he 5'11.5 sounds right\n\nmax said on 17/Apr/17\n\n6 ft spot on\n\nS.J.H said on 4/Apr/17\n\nIf grant gustin is 5'11.75 therefore Jesse L Martin will be 6'0.5, stephen amell 6'0.25, brandon routh 6'1.75 , people should bare in mind gustin always have flat footwear like 0.6 inch converse , stephen amell, Jesse L Martin and brandon routh always have 1.1-1.2' footwear. Especially amell have 1.5' boots on when he wear the arrow suit.\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here When Gustin not in his converse or vans sneakers he is only 2' shorter than brandon routh with same footwear\n\nRay said on 18/Mar/17\n\n5'11.75 is his height. No more\n\nBobby said on 6/Mar/17\n\nI think Grant can be a decent 6ft looking back on it, with shoes on, he'd be close to 6'1, so he can claim 6ft and wouldn't technically be lying."
