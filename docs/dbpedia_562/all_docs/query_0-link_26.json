In the year 2017 alone, 2082 articles were published under the key words ‘sport nutrition’. Consequently, staying current with the relevant literature is often difficult.\n\nMethods\n\nThis paper is an ongoing update of the sports nutrition review article originally published as the lead paper to launch the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition in 2004 and updated in 2010. It presents a well-referenced overview of the current state of the science related to optimization of training and performance enhancement through exercise training and nutrition. Notably, due to the accelerated pace and size at which the literature base in this research area grows, the topics discussed will focus on muscle hypertrophy and performance enhancement. As such, this paper provides an overview of: 1.) How ergogenic aids and dietary supplements are defined in terms of governmental regulation and oversight; 2.) How dietary supplements are legally regulated in the United States; 3.) How to evaluate the scientific merit of nutritional supplements; 4.) General nutritional strategies to optimize performance and enhance recovery; and, 5.) An overview of our current understanding of nutritional approaches to augment skeletal muscle hypertrophy and the potential ergogenic value of various dietary and supplemental approaches.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis updated review is to provide ISSN members and individuals interested in sports nutrition with information that can be implemented in educational, research or practical settings and serve as a foundational basis for determining the efficacy and safety of many common sport nutrition products and their ingredients.\n\nKeywords: Sports nutrition, Performance nutrition, Position stand, Review, Recommendations, Efficacy, Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Dietary supplements, Ergogenic aids, Weight gain, Hypertrophy, Strength, Capacity, Power\n\nBackground\n\nEvaluating the scientific merit of articles and advertisements about exercise and nutrition products is a key skill that all sports nutrition professionals must possess. To assist members and other advocates of the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) in keeping up to date about the latest findings in sports nutrition, the ISSN Exercise & Sports Nutrition Review: Research & Recommendations has been updated. The initial version of this paper was the first publication used to help launch the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition (JISSN, originally called the Sports Nutrition Review Journal). This paper provides a definition of ergogenic aids and dietary supplements and discusses how dietary supplements are legally regulated. Other sections highlight how to evaluate the scientific merit of nutritional supplements and provide general nutritional strategies to optimize performance and enhance recovery. Finally, a brief overview of the efficacy surrounding many supplements commonly touted to promote skeletal muscle hypertrophy and improve physical performance is provided. Based upon the available scientific literature testing the efficacy and safety of the nutritional supplements discussed herein, all nutritional supplements discussed in this paper have been placed into three categories based upon the quality and quantity of scientific support available:\n\nA)\n\nStrong Evidence to Support Efficacy and Apparently Safe\n\nB)\n\nLimited or Mixed Evidence to Support Efficacy\n\nC)\n\nLittle to No Evidence to Support Efficacy and/or Safety\n\nSince the last published version of this document in 2010 [1], the general approach to categorization has not changed, but several new supplements have been introduced to the market and are subsequently reviewed in this article. In this respect, many supplements have had additional studies published that has led to some supplements being placed into a different category or removed from the review altogether. We understand and expect that some individuals may not agree with our interpretations of the literature or what category we have assigned a particular supplement, but it is important to appreciate that some classifications may change over time as more research becomes available.\n\nDefinition of an ergogenic aid\n\nAn ergogenic aid is any training technique, mechanical device, nutritional ingredient or practice, pharmacological method, or psychological technique that can improve exercise performance capacity or enhance training adaptations [2–4]. Ergogenic aids may help prepare an individual to exercise, improve exercise efficiency, enhance recovery from exercise, or assist in injury prevention during intense training. Although this definition seems rather straightforward, there is considerable debate regarding the ergogenic value of various nutritional supplements. A consensus exists to suggest that a nutritional supplement is ergogenic if peer-reviewed studies demonstrate the supplement significantly enhances exercise performance following weeks to months of ingestion (e.g., promotes increases in maximal strength, running speed, and/or work during a given exercise task). On the other hand, a supplement may also have ergogenic value if it acutely enhances the ability of an athlete to perform an exercise task or enhances recovery from a single exercise bout. The ISSN has adopted a broader view regarding the ergogenic value of supplements. While the muscle building and performance enhancing effects of a supplement on a single bout of exercise may lead to eventual ergogenic effects or optimized training adaptations, our view is that such evidence does not warrant “Excellent Evidence to Support Efficacy” if there is a lack of long-term efficacy data. Herein, we have adopted the view that a supplement is clearly ergogenic if most of human studies support the ingredient as being effective in promoting further increases in muscle hypertrophy or performance with exercise training. Conversely, supplements that fall short of this standard and are only supported by preclinical data (e.g., cell culture or rodent studies) are grouped into other categories.\n\nDefinition and regulation of dietary supplements\n\nThe Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) and the safety of dietary supplements\n\nCongress passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), placing dietary supplements in a special category of “foods”. In October 1994, President Clinton signed DSHEA into law. This statute was enacted amid claims that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was distorting the then-existing provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to improperly deprive the public of safe and popular dietary supplement products.\n\nThe law defines a “dietary supplement” as a product that is intended to supplement the diet and contains a “dietary ingredient”. By definition, “dietary ingredients” in these products may include vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and substances such as enzymes, organ tissues, and glandular extracts. Further, dietary ingredients may also include extracts, metabolites, or concentrates of those substances. Dietary supplements may be found in many forms such as tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, liquids, or powders, but may only be intended for oral ingestion. Dietary supplements cannot be marketed or promoted for sublingual, intranasal, transdermal, injected, or in any other route of administration except oral ingestion. A supplement can be in other forms, such as a bar, as long as the information on its label does not represent the product as a conventional food or a sole item of a meal or diet.\n\nIndeed, DSHEA clearly defines “dietary supplements” and “dietary ingredients,” it sets certain criteria for “new dietary ingredients,” and the law prevents the FDA from overreaching. Additionally, and contrary to widespread opinion, DSHEA did not leave the industry unregulated. The dietary supplement industry is in fact regulated by the FDA as a result of DSHEA. The law ensures the authority of the FDA to provide legitimate protections for the public health. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also continues to have jurisdiction over the marketing claims that dietary supplement manufacturers or companies make about their products. The FDA and FTC operate in a cooperative fashion to regulate the dietary supplement industry. In this respect, the extent to which information is shared and jurisdiction between these two entities overlaps with regard to marketing and advertising dietary supplements continues to increase.\n\nIn the United States, dietary supplements are classified as food products, not drugs, and there is generally no mandate to register products with the FDA or obtain FDA approval before producing or selling supplements to consumers. However, if a dietary supplement manufacturer is making a claim about their product, the company must submit the claims to FDA within 30 days of marketing the product. Compare this, for example, with Canada where under the Natural Health Product (NHP) Regulations enacted in 2004 supplements must be reviewed, approved, and registered with Health Canada. The rationale for the U.S. model is based on a presumed long history of safe use; hence there is no need to require additional safety data.\n\nDSHEA also requires supplement marketers to include on any label displaying structure/function claims (i.e., claims that the product affects the structure or function of the body) the mandatory FDA disclaimer “This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.” Opponents of dietary supplements often cite this statement as evidence that the FDA does not review or approve dietary supplements. However, most dietary ingredients have been “grandfathered in” as DSHEA-compliant ingredients due to a long history of safe use, and those products containing new ingredients must be submitted by a notification to the FDA for a safety review prior to being brought to market. Although many dietary ingredients have been introduced into dietary supplements since October 1994 and have not been submitted to the FDA for a safety review, nutritional supplementation writ large is generally safe. In this regard, while there are over 50,000 dietary supplements registered with the Office of Dietary Supplement’s “Dietary Supplement Label Database”, a 2013 Annual Report (released in 2015) of the American Association of Poison Control Centers revealed zero fatalities occurred due to dietary supplements compared to 1692 deaths due to drugs [5]. Perhaps more alarming is a 2015 report by the Centers for Disease Control suggesting 2,287,273 emergency room visits were due to prescription drug-related events which dwarfs the 3266 emergency room visits due to dietary supplements (adjusted from 23,000 visits after excluding cases of older adults choking on pills, allergic reactions, unsupervised children consuming too many vitamins, and persons consuming ingredients not defined by DSHEA as a dietary supplement) [5]. Furthermore, a recent Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Statistical Brief by Lucado et al. [6] reported approximately one in six Americans suffered from food borne illnesses in 2010, and food borne illnesses were associated with over 3.7 million treat-and-release emergency department visits, 1.3 million inpatient hospital stays, and 3000 deaths. Notwithstanding, there have been case reports of liver and kidney toxicity potentially caused by supplements containing herbal extracts [7] as well as overdoses associated with pure caffeine anhydrous ingestion [8]. Collectively, the aforementioned statistics and case reports demonstrate that while generally safe, as with food or prescription drug consumption, dietary supplement consumption can lead to adverse events in spite of DSHEA and current FDA regulations described below.\n\nNew dietary ingredients\n\nRecognizing that new and untested dietary supplement products may pose unknown health issues, DSHEA distinguishes between products containing dietary ingredients that were already on the market and products containing new dietary ingredients that were not marketed prior to the enactment of the law. A “new dietary ingredient” (NDI) is defined as a dietary ingredient that was not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994. DSHEA grants the FDA greater control over supplements containing NDIs. A product containing an NDI is deemed adulterated and subject to FDA enforcement sanctions unless it meets one of two exemption criteria: either (1) the supplement in question contains “only dietary ingredients which have been present in the food supply as an article used for food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered”; or (2) there is a “history of use or other evidence of safety” provided by the manufacturer or distributor to the FDA at least 75 days before introducing the product into interstate commerce. The first criterion is silent as to how and by whom presence in the food supply as food articles without chemical alteration is to be established. The second criterion—applicable only to new dietary ingredients that have not been present in the food supply—requires manufacturers and distributors of the product to take certain actions. Those actions include submitting, at least 75 days before the product is introduced into interstate commerce, information that is the basis on which a product containing the new dietary ingredient is “reasonably expected to be safe.” That information would include: (1) the name of the new dietary ingredient and, if it is an herb or botanical, the Latin binomial name; (2) a description of the dietary supplement that contains the new dietary ingredient, including (a) the level of the new dietary ingredient in the product, (b) conditions of use of the product stated in the labeling, or if no conditions of use are stated, the ordinary conditions of use, and (c) a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the dietary ingredient, when used under the conditions recommended or suggested in the labeling of the dietary supplement, is reasonably expected to be safe.\n\nIn July 2011, the FDA released a Draft Guidance for Industry, entitled “Dietary Supplements: New Dietary Ingredient Notifications and Related Issues.” While a guidance does not carry the authority or the enforceability of a law or regulation, the FDA’s NDI draft guidance represented the agency’s current thinking on the topic. The guidance prompted great controversy, and FDA agreed to issue a revised draft guidance to address some of the issues raised by industry. In August 2016, FDA released a revised Draft Guidance that replaced the 2011 Draft Guidance. The purpose of the 2016 Draft Guidance was to help manufacturers and distributors decide whether to submit a premarket safety notification to FDA, help prepare NDI notifications in a manner that allows FDA to review and respond more efficiently and quickly, and to improve the quality of NDI notifications. The 2016 Draft Guidance has been criticized by industry and trade associations for its lack of clarity and other problems. Some of these issues include the lack of clarity regarding Pre-DSHEA, (Grandfathered), ingredients and FDA requiring an NDI notification even if another manufacturer has submitted a notification.\n\nThe lack of clarity surrounding the “new” Draft Guidance has led to many NDI notifications being rejected by FDA for lack of safety data and other issues. Other companies have opted to utilize the “Self-Affirmed Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS)” route in order to “bypass” the NDI notification process. Self-Affirmed GRAS is when a company has a team of scientific experts evaluate the safety of their ingredient. There is no requirement that the safety dossier be submitted to FDA but is used by the company as an internal document that may be relied upon if the ingredient is challenged by the FDA. FDA has expressed its concern with this practice and does not encourage dietary supplement manufacturers to use Self-Affirmed GRAS to avoid submitting NDI notifications. In any event, the likelihood of another revised Draft Guidance from FDA becoming available in the future is high, and possibly more enforcement actions taken against companies that market an NDI without submitting a notification.\n\nAdverse event reporting\n\nIn response to growing criticism of the dietary supplement industry, the 109th Congress passed the first mandatory Adverse Event Reporting (AER) legislation for the dietary supplement industry. In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act, which took effect on December 22, 2007. After much debate in Congress and input from the FDA, the American Medical Association (AMA), many of the major supplement trade associations, and a host of others all agreed that the legislation was necessary and the final version was approved by all. In short, the Act requires that all “serious adverse events” regarding dietary supplements be reported to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The law strengthens the regulatory structure for dietary supplements and builds greater consumer confidence, as consumers have a right to expect that if they report a serious adverse event to a dietary supplement marketer the FDA will be advised about it.\n\nAn adverse event is any health-related event associated with the use of a dietary supplement that is adverse. A serious adverse event is an adverse event that (A) results in (i) death, (ii) a life-threatening experience, (iii) inpatient hospitalization, (iv) a persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or (v) a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or (B) requires, based on reasonable medical judgment, a medical or surgical intervention to prevent an outcome described under subparagraph (A). Once it is determined that a serious adverse event has occurred, the manufacturer, packer, or distributor (responsible person) of a dietary supplement whose name appears on the label of the supplement shall submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services any report received of the serious adverse event accompanied by a copy of the label on or within the retail packaging of the dietary supplement. The responsible person has 15 business days to submit the report to FDA after being notified of the serious adverse event. Following the initial report, the responsible person must submit follow-up reports of new medical information that they receive for one-year.\n\nAdulterated supplements\n\nThe FDA has various options to protect consumers from unsafe supplements. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (which falls under FDA oversight) has the power to declare a dangerous supplement to be an “imminent hazard” to public health or safety and immediately suspend sales of the product. The FDA also has the authority to protect consumers from dietary supplements that do not present an imminent hazard to the public but do present certain risks of illness or injury to consumers. The law prohibits introducing adulterated products into interstate commerce. A supplement shall be deemed adulterated if it presents “a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury”. The standard does not require proof that consumers have actually been harmed or even that a product will harm anyone. It was under this provision that the FDA concluded that dietary supplements containing ephedra, androstenedione, and DMAA presented an unreasonable risk. Most recently, FDA imposed an importation ban on the botanical Mitragyna speciose, better known as Kratom. In 2016, FDA issued Import Alert #54–15, which allows for detention without physical examination of dietary supplements and bulk dietary ingredients that are, or contain, Kratom. Criminal penalties are present for a conviction of introducing adulterated supplement products into interstate commerce. While the harms associated with dietary supplements may pale in comparison to those linked to prescription drugs, recent pronouncements from the U.S. Department of Justice confirm that the supplement industry is being watched vigilantly to protect the health and safety of the American public.\n\nGood manufacturing practices\n\nWhen DSHEA was passed in 1994, it contained a provision requiring that the FDA establish and enforce current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) for dietary supplements. However, it was not until 2007 that the cGMPs were finally approved, and not until 2010 that the cGMPs applied across the industry, to large and small companies alike. The adherence to cGMPs has helped protect against contamination issues and should serve to improve consumer confidence in dietary supplements. The market improved as companies became compliant with cGMPs, as these regulations imposed more stringent requirements such as Vendor Certification, Document Control Procedures, and Identity Testing. These compliance criteria addressed the problems that had damaged the reputation of the industry with a focus on quality control, record keeping, and documentation.\n\nHowever, it does appear that some within the industry continue to struggle with compliance. In Fiscal Year 2017, it was reported that approximately 23.48% of the FDA’s 656 total cGMP inspections resulted in citations for failing to establish specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of dietary supplements. Further, 18.47% of those inspected were cited for failing to establish and/or follow written procedures for quality control operations. Undoubtedly, relying on certificates of analysis from the raw materials supplier without further testing, or failing to conduct identity testing of a finished product, can result in the creation of a product that contains something it should not contain such as synthetic chemicals or even pharmaceutical drugs. All members of the industry need to ensure compliance with cGMPs.\n\nMarketing claims\n\nAccording to the 1990 Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA), the FDA can review and approve health claims (claims describing the relationship between a food substance and a reduced risk of a disease or health-related condition) for dietary ingredients and foods. However, since the law was passed it has only approved a few claims. The delay in reviewing health claims of dietary supplement ingredients resulted in a lawsuit, Pearson v. Shalala, filed in 1995. After years of litigation, in 1999 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that qualified health claims may be made about dietary supplements with approval by FDA, as long as the statements are truthful and based on adequate science. Supplement or food companies wishing to make health claims or qualified health claims about supplements can submit research evidence to the FDA for review.\n\nThe FTC also regulates the supplement industry. Unsubstantiated claims invite enforcement by the FTC (along with the FDA, state district attorney offices, groups like the Better Business Bureau, and plaintiff’s lawyers who file class action lawsuits). The FTC has typically applied a substantiation standard of “competent and reliable scientific evidence” to claims about the benefits and safety of dietary supplements. FTC case law defines “competent and reliable scientific evidence” as “tests, analyses, research, studies, or other evidence based on the expertise of professionals in the relevant area, that has been conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by persons qualified to do so, using procedures generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results.” The FTC has claimed that this involves providing at least two clinical trials showing efficacy of the actual product, within a population of subjects relevant to the target market, supporting the structure/function claims that are made. While the exact requirements are still evolving, the FTC has acted against several supplement companies for misleading advertisements and/or structure/function claims.\n\nA safer industry ahead\n\nAs demonstrated, while some argue that the dietary supplement industry is “unregulated” and/or may have suggestions for additional regulation, manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements must adhere to several federal regulations before a product can go to market. Further, before marketing products, they must have evidence that their supplements are generally safe to meet all the requirements of DSHEA and FDA regulations. For this reason, over the last 20 years, many established supplement companies have employed research and development directors who help educate the public about nutrition and exercise, provide input on product development, conduct preliminary research on products, and/or assist in coordinating research trials conducted by independent research teams (e.g., university-based researchers or clinical research sites). These companies also consult with marketing and legal teams with the responsibility to ensure structure/function claims do not misrepresent results of research findings. This has increased job opportunities for sports nutrition specialists as well as enhanced external funding opportunities for research groups interested in exercise and nutrition research.\n\nWhile some companies have falsely attributed research on different dietary ingredients or dietary supplements to their own products, suppressed negative research findings, and/or exaggerated results from research studies, the trend in the sports nutrition industry has been to develop scientifically sound supplements. This trend toward greater research support is the result of: (1) attempts to honestly and accurately inform the public about results; (2) efforts to obtain data to support safety and efficacy on products for the FDA and the FTC; and/or, (3) endeavors to provide scientific evidence to support advertising claims and increase sales. While the push for more research is due in part to greater scrutiny from the FDA and FTC, it is also in response to an increasingly competitive marketplace where established safety and efficacy attracts more consumer loyalty and helps ensure a longer lifespan for the product in commerce. Companies that adhere to these ethical standards tend to prosper while those that do not will typically struggle to comply with FDA and FTC guidelines resulting in a loss of consumer confidence and an early demise for the product.\n\nProduct development and quality assurance\n\nA common question posed by athletes, parents, and professionals surrounding dietary supplements relates to how they are manufactured and perceived supplement quality. In several cases, established companies who develop dietary supplements have research teams who scour the medical and scientific literature looking for potentially effective nutrients. These research teams often attend scientific meetings and review the latest patents, research abstracts presented at scientific meetings, and research publications. Leading companies invest in basic research on nutrients before developing their supplement formulations and often consult with leading researchers to discuss ideas about dietary supplements and their potential for commercialization. Other companies wait until research has been presented in patents, research abstracts, or publications before developing nutritional formulations featuring the nutrient. Upon identification of new nutrients or potential formulations, the next step is to contact raw ingredient suppliers to see if the nutrient is available, if it is affordable, how much of it can be sourced and what is the available purity. Sometimes, companies develop and pursue patents involving new processing and purification processes because the nutrient has not yet been extracted in a pure form or is not available in large quantities. Reputable raw material manufacturers conduct extensive tests to examine purity of their raw ingredients. When working on a new ingredient, companies often conduct series of toxicity studies on the new nutrient once a purified source has been identified. The company would then compile a safety dossier and communicate it to the FDA as a New Dietary Ingredient submission, with the hopes of it being allowed for lawful sale.\n\nWhen a powdered formulation is designed, the list of ingredients and raw materials are typically sent to a flavoring house and packaging company to identify the best way to flavor and package the supplement. In the nutrition industry, several main flavoring houses and packaging companies exist who make many dietary supplements for supplement companies. Most reputable dietary supplement manufacturers submit their production facilities to inspection from the FDA and adhere to GMP, which represent industry standards for good manufacturing of dietary supplements. Some companies also submit their products for independent testing by third-party companies to certify that their products meet label claims and that the product is free of various banned ingredients. For example, the certification service offered by NSF International includes product testing, GMP inspections, ongoing monitoring and use of the NSF Mark indicating products comply with inspection standards, and screening for contaminants. More recently, companies have subjected their products for testing by third party companies to inspect for banned or unwanted substances. These types of tests help ensure that the dietary supplement made available to athletes do not contained substances banned by the International Olympic Committee or other athletic governing bodies (e.g., NFL, NCAA, MLB, NHL, etc.). While third-party testing does not guarantee that a supplement is void of banned substances, the likelihood is reduced (e.g., Banned Substances Control Group, Informed Choice, NSF, etc.). Moreover, consumers can request copies of results of these tests and each product that has gone through testing and earned certification can be researched online to help athletes, coaches and support staff understand which products should be considered. In many situations, companies who are not willing to provide copies of test results or certificates of analysis should be viewed with caution, particularly for individuals whose eligibility to participate might be compromised if a tainted product is consumed.\n\nEvaluation of nutrition ergogenic aids\n\nThe ISSN recommends that potential consumers undertake a systematic process of evaluating the validity and scientific merit of claims made when assessing the ergogenic value of a dietary supplement [1, 4]. This can be accomplished by examining the theoretical rationale behind the supplement and determining whether there is any well-controlled data showing the supplement is effective. Supplements based on sound scientific rationale with direct, supportive research showing effectiveness may be worth trying or recommending. However, those based on unsound scientific results or offer little to no data supporting the ergogenic value of the actual supplement/technique may not be worthwhile. Sports nutrition specialists should be a resource to help their clients interpret the scientific and medical research that may impact their welfare and help them train more effectively. The following are recommended questions to ask when evaluating the potential ergogenic value of a supplement.\n\nDoes the theory make sense?\n\nMost supplements that have been marketed to improve health or exercise performance are based on theoretical applications derived from basic science or clinical research studies. Based on these preliminary studies, a dietary approach or supplement is often marketed to people proclaiming the benefits observed in these basic research studies. Although the theory may appear relevant, critical analysis of this process often reveals flaws in the scientific logic or that the claims made do not quite match up with the cited literature. By evaluating the literature one can discern whether or not a dietary approach or supplement has been based on sound scientific evidence. To do so, one is recommended to first read reviews about the training method, nutrient, or supplement from researchers who have been intimately involved in the available research and consult reliable references about nutritional and herbal supplements [1, 9]. To aid in this endeavour, the ISSN has published position statement on topics related to creatine [10], protein [11], beta-alanine [12], nutrient timing [13], caffeine [14], HMB [15], meal frequency [16], energy drinks [17], and diets and body composition [18]. Each of these documents would be excellent resources for any of these topics. In addition, other review articles and consensus statements have been published by other researchers and research groups that evaluate dietary supplements, offer recommendations on interpreting the literature, and discuss the available findings for several ingredients that are discussed in this document [19–21]. We also advise consumers to conduct a search on the nutrient, key ingredients or the supplement itself on the National Library of Medicine’s Pub Med Online (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/). A quick look at these references will often help determine if the theoretical impetus for supplementing with an ingredient is plausible or not. Proponents of ergogenic aids often overstate claims made about training devices and dietary supplements while opponents of ergogenic aids and dietary supplements are often either unaware or are ignorant of research supporting their use. Sports nutrition specialists have the responsibility to know the literature and search available databases to evaluate the level of merit surrounding a proposed ergogenic aid.\n\nIs the supplement legal and safe?\n\nAn initial question that should be asked is whether the supplement is legal and/or safe. Some athletic associations have banned the use of various nutritional supplements (e.g., prohormones, ephedra that contains ephedrine, “muscle building” supplements, etc.) and many professional sports organization have now written language into their collective bargaining agreements that products made available by the team must be NSF certified as safe for sport. Obviously, if the supplement is banned, the sports nutrition specialist should discourage its use. In addition, many supplements lack appropriate long-term safety data. People who consider taking nutritional supplements should be well aware of the potential side effects so they can make an informed decision whether to use a supplement. Additionally, they should consult with a knowledgeable physician to see if any underlying medical problems exist that may contraindicate its use. When evaluating the safety of a supplement, it is suggested to determine if any side effects have been reported in the scientific or medical literature. In particular, we suggest determining how long a particular supplement has been studied, the dosages evaluated, and whether any side effects were observed. We also recommend consulting the Physician’s Desk Reference (PDR) for nutritional supplements and herbal supplements to see if any side effects have been reported and/or if there are any known drug interactions. If no side effects have been reported in the scientific/medical literature, we generally will view the supplement as safe for the length of time and dosages evaluated. Unfortunately, many available supplements have not had basic safety studies completed that replicate the length of time and dosages being used.\n\nIs there any scientific evidence supporting the ergogenic value?\n\nThe next question to ask is whether any well-controlled data are available showing effectiveness of the proposed ergogenic aid in athletic populations or people regularly involved in exercise training. The first place to look is the list of references cited in marketing material supporting their claims. Are the abstracts or articles cited just general references or specific studies that have evaluated the efficacy of the nutrients included in the formulation or of the actual supplement? From there, one can critically evaluate the cited abstracts and articles by asking a series of questions:\n\nAre the studies basic research done in animals/clinical populations or have the studies been conducted on athletes/trained subjects? For perspective, studies reporting improved performance in rats or an individual diagnosed with type 2 diabetes may be insightful, but research conducted on non-diabetic athletes is much more practical and relevant.\n\nWere the studies well controlled? For ergogenic aid research, the gold standard study design is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial. This means that neither the researcher nor the subject is aware which group received the supplement or the placebo during the study and that the subjects were randomly assigned into the placebo or supplement group. An additional element of rigor is called a cross-over design, where each subject, at different times (separated by an interval known as a “washout period”), is exposed to each of the treatments. While utilization of a cross-over design is not always feasible, it reduces the element of variability within a participant and subsequently, increases the strength of study’s findings. At times, supplement claims have been based on poorly designed studies (i.e., small groups of subjects, no control group, use of unreliable tests, etc.) or testimonials which make interpretation more difficult. Well-controlled clinical trials provide stronger evidence as to the potential ergogenic value and importantly how the findings can best be used.\n\nDo the studies report statistically significant results or are claims being made on non-significant means or trends? Appropriate statistical analysis of research results allows for an unbiased interpretation of data. Although studies reporting statistical trends may be of interest and lead researchers to conduct additional research, studies reporting statistically significant results are obviously more convincing. With this said, it is important for people to understand that oftentimes the potential effect a dietary supplement or diet regimen may have above and beyond the effect seen from the exercise bout or an accepted dietary approach is quite small. In addition, many studies examining a biochemical or molecular biology mechanism can require invasive sampling techniques or the study population being recruited is unique (very highly trained) resulting in a small number of study participants. When viewed together, the combination of these two considerations can result in statistical outcomes that do not reach statistical significance even though large mean changes were observed. In these situations, the reporting of confidence intervals on the mean change, individual responses from all participants to the investigated treatment and/or effect sizes are additional pieces of information that can allow for a more accurate interpretation. In all such cases, additional research is warranted to further examine the potential ergogenic aid before conclusions can be made.\n\nDo the results of the cited studies match the claims made about the supplement or do they accurately portray the response of the supplement against an appropriate placebo or control group? It is not unusual for marketing claims to greatly exaggerate the results found in the actual studies and do so by focusing upon just the outcomes within the supplement (treatment) group as opposed to how the supplement group changed in comparison to how a placebo group changed. Similarly, it is not uncommon for ostensibly compelling results, that may indeed be statistically significant, to be amplified while other relevant findings of significant consumer interest are obscured or omitted (e.g. a dietary supplement showing statistically significant increases in circulating testosterone yet changes in body composition or muscular performance were not superior to a placebo). The only way to determine this is to read the entire article versus focusing an entire study’s interpretation on the provided abstract or even the article citation, and compare results observed in the studies to the available marketing claims. Reputable companies accurately and completely report results of studies so that consumers can make informed decisions about using a product.\n\nWere results of the study presented at a reputable scientific meeting and/or published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal? At times, claims are based on research that has either never been published or only published in an obscure journal. The best research is typically presented at respected scientific meetings and/or published in reputable peer-reviewed journals. Three ways to determine a journal’s reputation is either: 1) identify the publisher, 2) the “impact factor” of the journal or 3) whether or not the journal is indexed and subsequently available for review on Pub Med (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/). Many “peer-reviewed” journals are published by companies with ties to, or are actually owned by, companies that do business with various nutritional products (even though they may be available on PubMed). Therefore, we recommend looking up the publisher’s website and see how many other journals they publish. If you see only a few other journals this is a suggestion that the journal is not a reputable journal. Additionally, one can also look up how many articles have been published by the journal in the last 6–12 months and how many of these articles are well-conducted studies. Alternatively, one can also inquire about the impact factor, a qualitative ranking determined by the number of times a journal’s articles are cited. Impact factors are determined and published by Thomson Reuters under Journal Citation Reports® (a subscription service available at most university libraries). Most journals list their impact factor on the journal home page. Historically, those articles that are read and cited the most are the most impactful scientifically.\n\nHave the research findings been replicated? If so, have the results only been replicated at the same laboratory? The best way to know an ergogenic aid works is to see that results have been replicated in several studies preferably by several separate, distinct research groups. The most reliable ergogenic aids are those in which multiple studies, conducted at different labs, have reported similar results of safety and efficacy. Additionally, replication of results by different, unaffiliated labs with completely different authors also removes or reduces the potentially confounding element of publication bias (publication of studies showing only positive results) and conflicts of interest. A notable number of studies on ergogenic aids are conducted in collaboration with one or more research scientists or co-authors that have a real or perceived economic interest in the outcome of the study. This could range from being a co-inventor on a patent application that is the subject of the ergogenic aid, being paid or receiving royalties from the creation of a dietary supplement formulation, providing consulting services for the company or having stock options or shares in a company that owns or markets the ergogenic aid described in the study. An increasing number of journals require disclosures by all authors of scientific articles, and including such disclosures in published articles. This is driven by the aim of providing greater transparency and research integrity. It is important to emphasize that disclosure of a conflict of interest does not alone discredit or dilute the merits of a research study. The primary thrust behind public disclosures of potential conflicts of interest is first and foremost transparency to the reader and second to prevent a later revelation of some form of confounding interest that has the potential of discrediting the study in question, the findings of the study, the authors, and even the research center or institution where the study was conducted.\n\nClassifying and categorizing supplements\n\nDietary supplements may contain carbohydrate, protein, fat, minerals, vitamins, herbs, enzymes, metabolic intermediates (i.e., select amino acids), or various plant/food extracts. Supplements can generally be classified as convenience supplements (e.g., energy bars, gels, blocks, meal replacement powders, or ready to drink supplements) designed to provide a convenient means of meeting necessary energy or macronutrient needs while also providing support towards attempts at managing caloric intake, weight gain, weight loss, and/or performance enhancement. As discussed previously, evaluating the available scientific literature is an important step in determining the efficacy of any diet, diet program or dietary supplement. In considering this, nutritional supplements can be categorized in the following manner:\n\nI.\n\nStrong Evidence to Support Efficacy and Apparently Safe: Supplements that have a sound theoretical rationale with the majority of available research in relevant populations using appropriate dosing regimens demonstrating both its efficacy and safety.\n\nII.\n\nLimited or Mixed Evidence to Support Efficacy: Supplements within this category are characterized as having a sound scientific rationale for its use, but the available research has failed to produce consistent outcomes supporting its efficacy. Routinely, these supplements require more research to be completed before researchers can begin to understand their impact. Importantly, these supplements have no available evidence to suggest they lack safety or should be viewed as harmful.\n\nIII.\n\nLittle to No Evidence to Support Efficacy and/or Safety: Supplements within this category generally lack a sound scientific rationale and the available research consistently shows it to lack efficacy. Alternatively, supplements that may be harmful to one’s health or to lack safety are also placed in this category.\n\nSeveral factors are evaluated when beginning to counsel individuals who regularly complete exercise training. First, a clear understanding of the athlete’s goals and the time with which they have to meet those goals is important. In addition to monitoring load and recovery, an evaluation of the individual’s diet and training program should also be completed. To accomplish this, one should make sure the athlete is eating an energy balanced, nutrient dense diet that meets their estimated daily energy needs and that they are training intelligently. Far too many athletes or coaches focus too heavily upon supplementation or applications of supplementation and neglect these key fundamental aspects. Following this, we suggest that they generally only recommend supplements in category I (i.e., ‘Strong Evidence to Support Efficacy and Apparently Safe’). If an athlete is interested in trying supplements in category II (i.e., ‘Limited or Mixed Evidence to Support Efficacy’), the athlete should make sure they understand these supplements are more experimental and they may or may not see the type of results claimed. Obviously, the ISSN does not support athletes taking supplements in category III (i.e., ‘Little to No Evidence to Support Efficacy and/or Safety’). We believe this approach is scientifically substantiated and offers a balanced view as opposed to simply dismissing the use of all dietary supplements.\n\nGeneral dietary guidelines for active individuals\n\nA well-designed diet that meets energy intake needs and incorporates proper timing of nutrients is the foundation upon which a good training program can be developed [22, 23]. Research has clearly shown that lacking sufficient calories and/or enough of the right type of macronutrients may impede an athlete’s training adaptations, while athletes who consume a balanced diet that meets energy needs can augment physiological training adaptations. Moreover, maintaining an energy deficient diet during training may lead to loss of muscle mass, strength, and bone mineral density in addition to an increased susceptibility to illness and injuries, disturbances in immune, endocrine and reproductive function, and an increased prevalence of overreaching and/or overtraining. Incorporating good dietary practices as part of a training program is one way to help optimize training adaptations and prevent overtraining. The following is an overview of energy intake recommendations and major nutrient needs for active individuals.\n\nEnergy needs\n\nThe primary component to optimize training and performance through nutrition is to ensure the athlete is consuming enough calories to offset energy expenditure [22–26]. People who participate in a general fitness program (e.g., exercising 30–40 min per day, 3 times per week) can typically meet nutritional needs following a normal diet (e.g., 1800–2400 kcals/day or about 25–35 kcals/kg/day for a 50–80 kg individual) because their caloric demands from exercise are not too great (e.g., 200–400 kcals/session). However, athletes involved in moderate levels of intense training (e.g., 2–3 h per day of intense exercise performed 5–6 times per week) or high volume intense training (e.g., 3–6 h per day of intense training in 1–2 workouts for 5–6 days per week) may expend 600–1200 kcals or more per hour during exercise [24]. For this reason, their caloric needs may approach 40–70 kcals/kg/day (2000–7000 kcals/day for a 50–100 kg athlete). For elite athletes, energy expenditure during heavy training or competition will further exceed these levels [27, 28]. For example, energy expenditure for cyclists to compete in the Tour de France has been estimated as high as 12,000 kcals/day (150–200 kcals/kg/day for a 60–80 kg athlete) [29, 30]. Additionally, caloric needs for large athletes (i.e., 100–150 kg) may range between 6000 and 12,000 kcals/day depending on the volume and intensity of different training phases [31].\n\nAlthough some argue that athletes can meet caloric needs simply by consuming a well-balanced diet, it is often very difficult for larger athletes and athletes engaged in high volume/intense training to be able to eat enough food, on a daily basis, to meet caloric needs [2, 29, 30, 32–34]. This point was clearly highlighted in a review by Burke who demonstrated that carbohydrate needs are largely unmet by high-level athletes [22]. Additionally it is difficult to consume enough food and maintain gastrointestinal comfort to train or race at peak levels [35]. Maintaining an energy deficient diet during training often leads to a number of physical (i.e., loss of fat-free mass, illness, reduced sleep quality, incomplete recovery, hormonal fluctuations, increased resting heart rate, etc.) and psychological (i.e., apathy towards training, heightened stress) adverse outcomes [23, 27]. Nutritional analyses of athletes’ diets have revealed that many are susceptible to maintaining negative energy intakes during training. It is still a question whether there may be specific individualized occasions when negative energy balance may enhance performance in the days prior to running performance [36]. Populations susceptible to negative energy balance include runners, cyclists, swimmers, triathletes, gymnasts, skaters, dancers, wrestlers, boxers, and athletes attempting to lose weight too quickly [37]. Additionally, female athletes are at particular risk of under fueling due to both competitive and aesthetic demands of their sport and their surrounding culture. Female athletes have been reported to have a high incidence of eating disorders [38]. Low or reduced energy availability (LEA) is linked to functional hypothalamic oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea (FHA), which is frequently reported in weight sensitive sports. This makes LEA a major nutritional concern for female athletes [39]. Consequently, it is important for the sports nutrition specialist working with athletes to assess athletes individually to ensure that athletes are well fed according to the goals of their sport and their health, and consume enough calories to offset the increased energy demands of training, and maintain body weight. Although this sounds relatively simple, intense training often suppresses appetite and/or alters hunger patterns so that many athletes do not feel like eating [37, 38]. Some athletes prefer not to exercise within several hours after eating because of sensations of fullness and/or a predisposition to cause gastrointestinal distress. Further, travel and training schedules may limit food availability or the types of food athletes are accustomed to eating. This means that care should be taken to plan meal times in concert with training, as well as to make sure athletes have sufficient availability of nutrient dense foods throughout the day for snacking between meals (e.g., fluids, carbohydrate/protein-rich foods and supplemental bars, etc.) [2, 33, 40]. For this reason, sports nutritionists’ often recommend that athletes consume four to six meals per day and snacks in between meals to meet energy needs. Due to these practical concerns, the use of nutrient dense energy foods, energy bars and high calorie carbohydrate/protein supplements provides a convenient way for athletes to supplement their diet in order to maintain energy intake during training.\n\nCarbohydrate\n\nBeyond optimal energy intake, consuming adequate amounts of carbohydrate, protein, and fat is important for athletes to optimize their training and performance. In particular and as it relates to exercise performance, the need for optimal carbohydrates before, during and after intense and high-volume bouts of training and competition is evident [41]. Excellent reviews [42, 43] and original investigations [44–49] continue to highlight the known dependence on carbohydrates that exists for athletes competing to win various endurance and team sport activities. A complete discussion of the needs of carbohydrates and strategies to deliver optimal carbohydrate and replenish lost muscle and liver glycogen extend beyond the scope of this paper, but the reader is referred to several informative reviews on the topic [23, 41, 50–53].\n\nAs such, individuals engaged in a general fitness program and are not necessarily training to meet any type of performance goal can typically meet daily carbohydrate needs by consuming a normal diet (i.e., 45–55% CHO [3–5 g/kg/day], 15–20% PRO [0.8–1.2 g/kg/day], and 25–35% fat [0.5–1.5 g/kg/day]). However, athletes involved in moderate and high-volume training need greater amounts of carbohydrate and protein (discussed later) in their diet to meet macronutrient needs [50]. In terms of carbohydrate needs, athletes involved in moderate amounts of intense training (e.g., 2–3 h per day of intense exercise performed 5–6 times per week) typically need to consume a diet consisting of 5–8 g/kg/day or 250–1200 g/day for 50–150 kg athletes of carbohydrate to maintain liver and muscle glycogen stores [23, 24, 50]. Research has also shown that athletes involved in high volume intense training (e.g., 3–6 h per day of intense training in 1–2 daily workouts for 5–6 days per week) may need to consume 8–10 g/day of carbohydrate (i.e., 400–1500 g/day for 50–150 kg athletes) in order to maintain muscle glycogen levels [50]. Preferably, the majority of dietary carbohydrate should come from whole grains, vegetables, fruits, etc. while foods that empty quickly from the stomach such as refined sugars, starches and engineered sports nutrition products should be reserved for situations in which glycogen resynthesis needs to occur at accelerated rates [53]. In these situations, the absolute delivery of carbohydrate (> 8 g of carbohydrate/kg/day or at least 1.2 g of carbohydrate/kg/hour for the first four hours into recovery) takes precedence over other strategies such as those that may relate to timing or concomitant ingestion of other macronutrients (e.g., protein) or non-nutrients (e.g., caffeine) or carbohydrate type (i.e., glycemic index) [50].\n\nWhen considering the carbohydrate needs throughout an exercise session, several key factors should be considered. Previous research has indicated athletes undergoing prolonged bouts (2–3 h) of exercise training can oxidize carbohydrates at a rate of 1–1.1 g per minute or about 60 g per hour [41]. Several reviews advocate the ingestion of 0.7 g of carbohydrate/kg/hr. during exercise in a 6–8% solution (i.e., 6–8 g per 100 ml of fluid) [41, 42, 50, 54]. It is now well established that different types of carbohydrates can be oxidized at different rates in skeletal muscle due to the involvement of different transporter proteins that result in carbohydrate uptake [55–59]. Interestingly, combinations of glucose and sucrose or maltodextrin and fructose have been reported to promote greater exogenous rates of carbohydrate oxidation when compared to situations when single sources of carbohydrate are ingested [55–63]. These studies generally indicate a ratio of 1–1.2 for maltodextrin to 0.8–1.0 fructose seems to support the greatest rates of carbohydrate oxidation during exercise. Additional research on high molecular weight amylopectin indicates that there may be a benefit to the lower osmolality of the starch, allowing for greater consumption (100 g/hour) and possibly greater oxidation rates and performance improvement [64–67]. In addition to oxidation rates and carbohydrate types, the fasting status and duration of the exercise bout also function as key variables for athletes and coaches to consider. When considering duration, associated reviews have documented that bouts of moderate to intense exercise need to reach exercise durations that extend well into 90th minute of exercise before carbohydrate is shown to consistently yield an ergogenic outcome [41, 68, 69]. Of interest, however, not all studies indicate that shorter (60–75 min) bouts of higher intensity work may benefit from carbohydrate delivery. Currently the mechanisms surrounding these findings are, respectively, thought to be replacement of depleted carbohydrate stores during longer duration of moderate intensity while benefits seen during shorter, more intense exercise bouts are thought to operate in a central fashion. Moreover, these reviews have also pointed to the impact of fasting status on documentation of ergogenic outcomes [41, 68, 69]. In this respect, when studies require study participants to commence exercise in a fasted state, ergogenic outcomes are more consistently reported, yet other authors have questioned the ecological validity of this approach for competing athletes [43].\n\nAs it stands, the need for optimal carbohydrates in the diet for those athletes seeking maximal physical performance is unquestioned. Daily consumption of appropriate amounts of carbohydrate is the first and most important step for any competing athlete. As durations extend into 2 h, the need to deliver carbohydrate goes up, particularly when commencing exercise in a state of fasting or incomplete recovery. Once exercise ceases, several dietary strategies can be considered to maximally replace lost muscle and liver glycogen, particularly if a limited window of recovery exists. In these situations, the first priority should lie with achieving aggressive intakes of carbohydrate while strategies such as ingesting protein with lower carbohydrate amounts, carbohydrate and caffeine co-ingestion or certain forms of carbohydrate may also help to facilitate rapid assimilation of lost glycogen.\n\nProtein\n\nConsiderable debate exists surrounding the amount of protein needed in an athlete’s diet [70–74]. Initially, it was recommended that athletes do not need to ingest more than the RDA for protein (i.e., 0.8 to 1.0 g/kg/d for children, adolescents and adults). However, research spanning the past 30 years has indicated that athletes engaged in intense training may benefit from ingesting about two times the RDA of protein in their diet (1.4–1.8 g/kg/d) to maintain protein balance [11, 70, 71, 73, 75–80]. If an insufficient amount of protein is consumed, an athlete will develop and maintain a negative nitrogen balance, indicating protein catabolism and slow recovery. Over time, this may lead to muscle wasting, injuries, illness, and training intolerance [76, 77, 81].\n\nFor people involved in a general fitness program or simply interested in optimizing their health, recent research suggests protein needs may also be above the RDA. Phillips and colleagues [76], Witard et al. [82], Jager et al. [11] and Tipton et al. [79] report that current evidence indicates optimal protein intakes in the range of 1.2–2.0 g/kg/day should be considered. In this respect, Morton and investigators [83] performed a meta-review and meta-regression involving 49 studies and 1863 participants and concluded that a daily protein intake of 1.62 g/kg/day may be an ideal place to start, with intakes beyond that providing no further contribution to increases in fat-free mass. In addition and in comparison to the RDA, non-exercising, older individuals (53–71 years) may also benefit from a higher daily protein intake (e.g., 1.0–1.2 g/kg/day of protein). Recent reports suggest that older muscle may be slower to respond and less sensitive to protein ingestion, typically requiring 40 g doses to robustly stimulate muscle protein synthesis [84–86]. Studies in younger individuals, however, have indicated that in the absence of exercise, a 20 g dose can maximize muscle protein synthesis [87, 88] and if consumed after a multiple set workout consisting of several exercises that target large muscle groups a 40 g dose might be needed [89]. Consequently, it is recommended that athletes involved in moderate amounts of intense training consume 1.2–2.0 g/kg/day of protein (60–300 g/day for a 50–150 kg athlete) while athletes involved in high volume, intense training consume 1.7–2.2 g/kg/day of protein (85–330 g/day for a 50–150 kg athlete) [78, 90]. This protein need would be equivalent to ingesting 3–15 three-ounce servings of chicken or fish per day for a 50–150 kg athlete [78]. Although smaller athletes typically can ingest this amount of protein, on a daily basis, in their normal diet, larger athletes often have difficulty consuming this much dietary protein. Additionally, a number of athletic populations are known to be susceptible to protein malnutrition (e.g., runners, cyclists, swimmers, triathletes, gymnasts, dancers, skaters, wrestlers, boxers, etc.) and consequently, additional counseling and education may be needed to help these athletes meet their daily protein needs. To this point, the periods of energy restriction to meet weight or aesthetic demands of their sports that are seemingly a part of the sport’s fabric creates an arguably greater need to understand that protein intake, quality and timing as well as combination with carbohydrate is particularly important to maintain lean body mass, training effects, and performance [25]. Overall, it goes without saying that care should be taken to ensure that athletes consume a sufficient amount of quality protein in their diet to maintain nitrogen balance.\n\nProteins differ based on their source, amino acid profile, and the methods of processing or isolating the protein undergoes [11]. These differences influence the availability of amino acids and peptides, which may possess biological activity (e.g., α-lactalbumin, ß-lactoglobulin, glycomacropeptides, immunoglobulins, lactoperoxidases, lactoferrin, etc.). Additionally, the rate of digestion and/or absorption and metabolic activity of the protein also are important considerations [91]. For example, different types of proteins (e.g., casein, whey, and soy) are digested at different rates, which may affect whole body catabolism and anabolism and acute stimulation of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) [91–96]. Therefore, care should be taken not only to make sure the athlete consumes enough protein in their diet but also that the protein is high quality. The best dietary sources of low fat, high quality protein are light skinless chicken, fish, egg whites, very lean cuts of beef and skim milk (casein and whey) while protein supplements routinely contain whey, casein, milk and egg protein. In what is still an emerging area of research, various plant sources of protein have been examined for their ability to stimulate increases in muscle protein synthesis [77, 97] and promote exercise training adaptations [98]. While amino acid absorption from plant proteins is generally slower, leucine from rice protein has been found to be absorbed even faster than from whey [99], while digestive enzymes [100], probiotics [101] and HMB [102] can be used to overcome differences in protein quality. Preliminary findings suggest that rice [98] and pea protein [103] may be able to stimulate similar changes in fat-free mass and strength as whey protein, although the reader should understand that many other factors (dose provided, training status of participants, duration of training and supplementation, etc.) will ultimately impact these outcomes and consequently more research is needed.\n\nWhile many reasons and scenarios exist for why an athlete may choose to supplement their diet with protein powders or other forms of protein supplements, this practice is not considered to be an absolute requirement for increased performance and adaptations. Due to nutritional, societal, emotional and psychological reasons, it is preferable for the majority of daily protein consumed by athletes to occur as part of a food or meal. However, we recognize and embrace the reality that situations commonly arise where efficiently delivering a high-quality source of protein takes precedence. Jager and colleagues [11] published an updated position statement of the International Society of Sports Nutrition that is summarized by the following points:\n\nAn acute exercise stimulus, particularly resistance exercise and protein ingestion both stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and are synergistic when protein consumption occurs before or after resistance exercise\n\nFor building and maintaining muscle mass, an overall daily protein intake of 1.4–2.0 g/kg/d is sufficient for most exercising individuals\n\nHigher protein intakes (2.3–3.1 g/kg fat-free mass/d) may be needed to maximize the retention of lean body weight in resistance trained subjects during hypocaloric periods\n\nHigher protein intakes (> 3.0 g protein/kg body weight/day) when combined with resistance exercise may have positive effects on body composition in resistance trained individuals (i.e., promote loss of fat mass)\n\nOptimal doses for athletes to maximize MPS are mixed and are dependent upon age and recent resistance exercise stimuli. General recommendations are 0.25–0.55 g of a high-quality protein per kg of body weight, or an absolute dose of 20–40 g.\n\nAcute protein doses should contain 700–3000 mg of leucine and/or a higher relative leucine content, in addition to a balanced array of the essential amino acids (EAAs)\n\nProtein doses should ideally be evenly distributed, every 3–4 h, across the day\n\nThe optimal time period during which to ingest protein is likely a matter of individual tolerance; however, the anabolic effect of exercise is long-lasting (at least 24 h), but likely diminishes with increasing time post-exercise\n\nRapidly digested proteins that contain high proportions of EAAs and adequate leucine, are most effective in stimulating MPS\n\nDifferent types and quality of protein can affect amino acid bioavailability following protein supplementation; complete protein sources deliver all required EAAs\n\nFat\n\nThe dietary recommendations of fat intake for athletes are similar to or slightly greater than dietary recommendations made to non-athletes to promote health. Maintenance of energy balance, replenishment of intramuscular triacylglycerol stores and adequate consumption of essential fatty acids are important for athletes, and all serve as reasons for an increased intake of dietary fat [104]. Depending upon the athlete’s training status or goals, the amount of dietary fat recommended for daily intake can change. For example, higher-fat diets appear to maintain circulating testosterone concentrations better than low-fat diets [105–107]. Additionally, higher fat intakes may provide valuable translational evidence to the documented testosterone suppression which can occur during volume-type overtraining [108]. Generally, it is recommended that athletes consume a moderate amount of fat (approximately 30% of their daily caloric intake), while proportions up to 50% of daily calories can be safely ingested by athletes during regular high-volume training [104]. In situations where an athlete may be interested in reducing their body fat, dietary fat intakes ranging from 0.5 to 1 g/kg/day have been recommended results in situations where daily fat intake might comprise as little as 20% of total calories in the diet [2]. This recommendation stems largely from available evidence in weight loss studies involving non-athletic individuals that people who are most successful in losing weight and maintaining the weight loss are those who ingest reduced amounts of fat in their diet [109, 110] although this is not always the case [111]. Strategies to help athletes manage dietary fat intake include teaching them which foods contain various types of fat so that they can make better food choices and how to count fat grams [2, 33].\n\nFor years, high-fat diets have been used by athletes with the majority of evidence showing no ergogenic benefit and consistent gastrointestinal challenges [112]. In recent years, significant debate has swirled regarding the impact of increasing dietary fat. One strategy, “train low, compete high”, refers to an acute pattern of dietary periodization whereby an athlete first follows a high-fat, low carbohydrate diet for one to 3 weeks while training before reintroducing carbohydrates back into the diet. While intramuscular adaptations result that may theoretically impact performance [113, 114], no consistent, favorable impact on performance has been documented [112, 115]. A variant of high-fat diets, ketogenic diets, have increased in popularity. While no exact prescription exists, nearly all ketogenic diet prescriptions derive at least 70–80% of their daily calories from dietary fat, prescribe a moderate amount of protein (20–25% total calories or 2.0–2.5 g/kg/day) and are largely devoid of carbohydrate (10–40 g per day). This diet prescription leads to a greater reliance on ketones as a fuel source. Currently, limited and mixed evidence remains regarding the overall efficacy of a ketogenic diet for athletes. In favor, Cox et al. [116] demonstrated that ketogenic dieting can improve exercise endurance by shifting fuel oxidation while Burke and colleagues [115] failed to show an increase in performance in a cohort of Olympic-caliber race walkers. Additionally, Jabekk and colleagues [117] reported decreases in body fat with no change in lean mass in overweight women who resistance trained for 10 weeks and followed a ketogenic diet. In light of the available evidence being limited and mixed, more human research needs to be completed before appropriate recommendations can be made towards the use of high fat diets for athletic performance.\n\nStrategic eating and refueling\n\nIn addition to the general nutritional guidelines described above, research has also demonstrated that timing and composition of meals consumed may play a role in optimizing performance, training adaptations, and preventing overtraining [2, 25, 40]. In this regard, it takes about 4 h for carbohydrate to be digested and assimilated into muscle and liver tissues as glycogen. Consequently, pre-exercise meals should be consumed about four to 6 h before exercise [40]. This means that if an athlete trains in the afternoon, breakfast can be viewed to have great importance to top off muscle and liver glycogen levels. Research has also indicated that ingesting a light carbohydrate and protein snack 30 to 60 min prior to exercise (e.g., 50 g of carbohydrate and 5 to 10 g of protein) serves to increase carbohydrate availability toward the end of an intense exercise bout [118, 119]. This also serves to increase availability of amino acids, decrease exercise-induced catabolism of protein, and minimize muscle damage [120–122]. Additionally, athletes who are going through periods of energy restriction to meet weight or aesthetic demands of sports should understand that protein intake, quality and timing as well as combination with carbohydrate is particularly important to maintain lean body mass, training effects, and performance [25]. When exercise lasts more than 1 h and especially as duration extends beyond 90 min, athletes should ingest glucose/electrolyte solutions (GES) to maintain blood glucose levels, prevent dehydration, and reduce the immunosuppressive effects of intense exercise [40, 123–128]. Notably, this strategy becomes even more important if the athlete is under-fueled prior to the exercise task or is fasted vs. unfasted at the start of exercise [68, 69, 129]. Following intense exercise, athletes should consume carbohydrate and protein (e.g., 1 g/kg of carbohydrate and 0.5 g/kg of protein) within 30 min after exercise and consume a high carbohydrate meal within 2 h following exercise [2, 74]. This nutritional strategy has been found to accelerate glycogen resynthesis as well as promote a more anabolic hormonal profile that may hasten recovery [120, 130, 131], but as mentioned above only when rapid glycogen restoration is needed or if the carbohydrate intake in the diet is adequate (< 6 g/kg/day) [53, 132]. In other words, the total carbohydrate consumption and timing of carbohydrate consumption should be individualized to each athlete’s needs according to the goals of the training cycle and bout [112]. Finally, for two to 3 days prior to competition, athletes should taper training by 30 to 50% and consume an additional 200 to 300 g of carbohydrate each day in their diet. This eating strategy has been shown to supersaturate carbohydrate stores prior to competition and improve endurance exercise capacity [2, 40]. Thus, the type of meal, amount of carbohydrate consumed, and timing of eating are important factors to maximize glycogen storage and in maintaining carbohydrate availability during training while also potentially decreasing the incidence of overtraining. The ISSN has adopted a position stand on nutrient timing in 2008 [133] that has been subsequently revised [13] and can be summarized with the following points:\n\nIntramuscular and hepatic glycogen stores are best maximized by consumption of a high-carbohydrate diet (8–12 g/kg/day). Strategies such as aggressive carbohydrate feedings (~ 1.2 g/kg/hour) that favor high-glycemic (> 70) carbohydrates, addition of caffeine (3–8 mg/kg) and combining a moderate carbohydrate dose (0.8 g/kg/h) with protein (0.2–0.4 g/kg/h) have been shown to promote rapid restoration of glycogen stores.\n\nHigh intensity (> 70% VO2Max) exercise bouts that extend beyond 90 min challenge fuel supply and fluid regulation. In these situations, it is advisable to consume carbohydrate at a rate of 30–60 g of carbohydrate/hour in a 6–8% carbohydrate-electrolyte solution (6–12 fluid ounces) every 10–15 min throughout the entire exercise bout. The importance of this strategy is increased when poor feeding or recovery strategies were employed prior to exercise commencement. Consequently, when carbohydrate delivery is inadequate, adding protein may help increase performance, mitigate muscle damage, promote euglycemia, and facilitate glycogen re-synthesis.\n\nConsuming a diet that delivers adequate energy (minimum of 27–30 kcal/kg) and protein (1.6–1.8 g/kg/day), preferably with evenly spaced (every 3–4 h) protein feedings (0.25–0.40 g/kg/dose) during the day, should be considered for all exercising individuals.\n\nIngesting efficacious doses (10–12 g) of essential amino acids (EAAs) either in free form or as a protein bolus in 20–40 g doses (0.25–0.40 g/kg/dose) will maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS).\n\nPre- and/or post-exercise nutritional interventions (carbohydrate + protein or protein alone) can be an effective strategy to support improvements in strength and body composition. However, the size (0.25–0.40 g/kg/dose) and timing (0–4 h) of a pre-exercise meal may impact the benefit derived from the post-exercise protein feeding.\n\nPost-exercise ingestion (immediately-post to 2 h post) of high-quality protein sources stimulates robust increases in MPS. Similar increases in MPS have been found when high-quality proteins are ingested immediately before exercise.\n\nVitamins\n\nVitamins are essential organic compounds that serve to regulate metabolic and neurological processes, energy synthesis, and prevent destruction of cells. Fat-soluble vitamins include vitamins A, D, E, & K and the body stores fat-soluble vitamins in various tissues, which can result in toxicity if consumed in excessive amounts. Water-soluble vitamins consist of the entire complex of B-vitamins and vitamin C. Since these vitamins are water-soluble, excessive intake of these vitamins are eliminated in urine, with few exceptions (e.g. vitamin B6, which can cause peripheral nerve damage when consumed in excessive amounts). Table describes the RDA, proposed ergogenic benefit, and summary of research findings for fat and water-soluble vitamins. Research has demonstrated that specific vitamins possess various health benefits (e.g., Vitamin E, niacin, folic acid, vitamin C, etc.), while few published studies have reported to find an ergogenic value of vitamins for athletes [134–138]. Alternatively, if an athlete is deficient in a vitamin, supplementation or diet modifications to improve vitamin status can consistently improve health and performance [139]. For example, Paschalis and colleagues [140] supplemented individuals who were low in vitamin C for 30 days and reported these individuals had significantly lower VO2Max levels than a group of males who were high in vitamin C. Further, after 30 days of supplementation, VO2Max significantly improved in the low vitamin C cohort as did baseline levels of oxidative stress of oxidative stress. Importantly, one must consider that some vitamins may help athletes tolerate training to a greater degree by reducing oxidative damage (Vitamin E, C) and/or help to maintain a healthy immune system during heavy training (Vitamin C). Alternatively, conflicting evidence has accumulated that ingesting high doses of Vitamins C and E may negatively impact intracellular adaptations seen in response to exercise training [141–144], which may consequently negatively impact an athlete’s performance. Furthermore, while optimal levels of vitamin D have been linked to improved muscle health [145] and strength [146] in general populations, research studies conducted in athletes generally fail to report on the ergogenic impact of vitamin D in athletes [147, 148]. However, equivocal evidence from Wyon et al. [149] suggests vitamin D supplementation in elite ballet dancers improved strength and reduced risk for injuries. The remaining vitamins reviewed appear to have little ergogenic value for athletes who consume a normal, nutrient dense diet. Since dietary analyses of athletes commonly indicate that athletes fail to consume enough calories and subsequently may not be consuming adequate amounts of each vitamin, many sport dietitians and nutritionists recommend that athletes consume a low-dose daily multivitamin and/or a vitamin enriched post-workout carbohydrate/protein supplement during periods of heavy training [150]. Finally, athletes may desire to consume a vitamin or mineral for various health (non-performance) related reasons including niacin to elevate high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and decrease risk of heart disease (niacin), vitamin E for its antioxidant potential, vitamin D for its ability to preserve musculoskeletal function, or vitamin C to promote and maintain a healthy immune system.\n\nTable 1\n\nNutrientRDAProposed ergogenic valueSummary of research findingsVitamin AMales 900 mcg/d\n\nFemales 700 mcg/dConstituent of rhodopsin (visual pigment) and is involved in night vision. Some suggest that vitamin A supplementation may improve sport vision.No studies have shown that vitamin A supplementation improves exercise performance [139].Vitamin D5 mcg/d (age < 51)Promotes bone growth and mineralization. Enhances calcium absorption. Supplementation with calcium may help prevent bone loss in osteoperotic populations.Co-supplementation with calcium may help prevent bone loss in athletes susceptible to osteoporosis [707]. However, vitamin D supplementation does not enhance exercise performance [139].Vitamin E15 mg/dAs an antioxidant, it has been shown to help prevent the formation of free radicals during intense exercise and prevent the destruction of red blood cells, improving or maintaining oxygen delivery to the muscles during exercise. Some evidence suggests that it may reduce risk to heart disease or decrease incidence of recurring heart attack.Numerous studies show that vitamin E supplementation can decrease exercise-induced oxidative stress [708–710]. However, most studies show no effects on performance at sea level. At high altitudes, vitamin E may improve exercise performance [711]. Additional research is necessary to determine whether long-term supplementation may help athletes better tolerate training.Vitamin KMales 120 mcg/d\n\nFemales 90 mcg/dImportant in blood clotting. There is also some evidence that it may affect bone metabolism in postmenopausal women.Vitamin K supplementation (10 mg/d) in elite female athletes has been reported to increase calcium-binding capacity of osteocalcin and promoted a 15–20% increase in bone formation markers and a 20–25% decrease in bone resorption markers suggesting an improved balance between bone formation and resorption [712].Thiamin (B1)Males 1.2 mg/d\n\nFemales 1.1 mg/dCoenzyme (thiamin pyrophosphate) in the removal of CO2 from decarboxylic reactions from pyruvate to acetyl CoA and in TCA cycle. Supplementation is theorized to improve anaerobic threshold and CO2transport. Deficiencies may decrease efficiency of energy systems.Dietary availability of thiamin does not appear to affect exercise capacity when athletes have a normal intake [713].Riboflavin (B2)Males 1.3 mg/d\n\nFemales 1.7 mg/dConstituent of flavin nucleotide coenzymes involved in energy metabolism. Theorized to enhance energy availability during oxidative metabolism.Dietary availability of riboflavin does not appear to affect exercise capacity when athletes have a normal intake [713].Niacin (B3)Males 16 mg/d\n\nFemales 14 mg/dConstituent of coenzymes involved in energy metabolism. Theorized to blunt increases in fatty acids during exercise, reduce cholesterol, enhance thermoregulation, and improve energy availability during oxidative metabolism.Studies indicate that niacin supplementation (100–500 mg/d) can help decrease blood lipid levels and increase homocysteine levels in hypercholesteremic patients [714, 715]. However, niacin supplementation (280 mg) during exercise has been reported to decrease exercise capacity by blunting the mobilization of fatty acids [716].Pyridoxine (B6)1.3 mg/d (age < 51)Has been marketed as a supplement that will improve muscle mass, strength, and aerobic power in the lactic acid and oxygen systems. It also may have a calming effect that has been linked to an improved mental strength.In well-nourished athletes, pyridoxine failed to improve aerobic capacity, or lactic acid accumulation [713]. However, when combined with vitamins B1and B12, it may increase serotonin levels and improve fine motor skills that may be necessary in sports like pistol shooting and archery [717, 718].Cyano-cobalamin (B12)2.4 mcg/dA coenzyme involved in the production of DNA and serotonin. DNA is important in protein and red blood cell synthesis. Theoretically, it would increase muscle mass, the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, and decrease anxiety.In well-nourished athletes, no ergogenic effect has been reported. However, when combined with vitamins B1 and B6, cyanocobalamin has been shown to improve performance in pistol shooting [718]. This may be due to increased levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter in the brain, which may reduce anxiety.Folic acid (folate)400 mcg/dFunctions as a coenzyme in the formation of DNA and red blood cells. An increase in red blood cells could improve oxygen delivery to the muscles during exercise. Believed to be important to help prevent birth defects and may help decrease homocysteine levels.Studies suggest that increasing dietary availability of folic acid during pregnancy can lower the incidence of birth defects [719]. Additionally, it may decrease homocysteine levels (a risk factor for heart disease) [720]. In well-nourished and folate deficient-athletes, folic acid did not improve exercise performance [721].Pantothenic acid5 mg/dActs as a coenzyme for acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA). This may benefit aerobic or oxygen energy systems.Research has reported no improvements in aerobic performance with acetyl CoA supplementation. However, one study reported a decrease in lactic acid accumulation, without an improvement in performance [722].Beta caroteneNoneServes as an antioxidant. Theorized to help minimize exercise-induced lipid peroxidation and muscle damage.Research indicates that beta carotene supplementation with or without other antioxidants can help decrease exercise-induced peroxidation. Over time, this may help athletes tolerate training. However, it is unclear whether antioxidant supplementation affects exercise performance [709].Vitamin CMales 90 mg/d\n\nFemales 75 mg/dUsed in a number of different metabolic processes in the body. It is involved in the synthesis of epinephrine, iron absorption, and is an antioxidant. Theoretically, it could benefit exercise performance by improving metabolism during exercise. There is also evidence that vitamin C may enhance immunity.In well-nourished athletes, vitamin C supplementation does not appear to improve physical performance [138, 723]. However, there is some evidence that vitamin C supplementation (e.g., 500 mg/d) following intense exercise may decrease the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections [696, 724, 725].\n\nMinerals\n\nMinerals are essential inorganic elements necessary for a host of metabolic processes. Minerals serve as structure for tissue, important components of enzymes and hormones, and regulators of metabolic and neural control. In athletic populations, some minerals have been found to be deficient while other minerals are reduced secondary to training and/or prolonged exercise. Notably, acute changes in sodium, potassium and magnesium throughout a continued bout of moderate to high intensity exercise are considerable. In these situations, athletes must work to ingest foods and fluids to replace these losses, while physiological adaptations to sweat composition and fluid retention will also occur to promote a necessary balance. Like vitamins, when mineral status is inadequate, exercise capacity may be reduced and when minerals are supplemented in deficient athletes, exercise capacity has been shown to improve [151]. However, scientific reports consistently fail to document a performance improvement due to mineral supplementation when vitamin and mineral status is adequate [134, 152, 153]. Table describes minerals that have been purported to affect exercise capacity in athletes. Of the minerals reviewed, several appear to possess health and/or ergogenic value for athletes under certain conditions. For example, calcium supplementation in athletes susceptible to premature osteoporosis may help maintain bone mass [151]. For years, the importance of iron status in female athletes has been discussed [154] and more recent efforts have highlighted that iron supplementation in athletes prone to iron deficiencies and/or anaemia can improve exercise capacity [155, 156]. Sodium phosphate loading can increase maximal oxygen uptake, anaerobic threshold, and improve endurance exercise capacity by 8 to 10% [157]. Increasing dietary availability of salt (sodium chloride) during the initial days of exercise training in the heat helps to maintain fluid balance and prevent dehydration. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommendations for sodium levels (340 mg) represent the amount of sodium in less than 1/8 teaspoon of salt and recommended guidelines for sodium ingestion during exercise (300–600 mg per hour or 1.7–2.9 g of salt during a prolonged exercise bout) [158–161]. Finally, zinc supplementation during training can support changes in immune status in response to exercise training. Consequently, several minerals may enhance exercise capacity and/or training adaptations for athletes under certain conditions. However, there is little evidence that boron, chromium, magnesium, or vanadium affect exercise capacity or training adaptations in healthy individuals eating a normal diet. Sport nutritionists and dietitians should be aware of the specialized situations in which different types of minerals may provide support to bolster an athlete’s health or physical performance.\n\nTable 2\n\nNutrientRDAProposed ergogenic valueSummary of research findingsBoronNoneBoron has been marketed to athletes as a dietary supplement that may promote muscle growth during resistance training. The rationale was primarily based on an initial report that boron supplementation (3 mg/d) significantly increased β-estradiol and testosterone levels in postmenopausal women consuming a diet low in boron.Studies which have investigated the effects of 7 wk. of boron supplementation (2.5 mg/d) during resistance training on testosterone levels, body composition, and strength have reported no ergogenic value [280, 281]. There is no evidence at this time that boron supplementation during resistance-training promotes muscle growth.Calcium1000 mg/d (ages 19–50)Involved in bone and tooth formation, blood clotting, and nerve transmission. Stimulates fat metabolism. Diet should contain sufficient amounts, especially in growing children/adole [285] scents, female athletes, and postmenopausal women. Vitamin D needed to assist absorption.Calcium supplementation may be beneficial in populations susceptible to osteoporosis [726]. Additionally, calcium supplementation has been shown to promote fat metabolism and help manage body composition [727, 728]. Calcium supplementation provides no ergogenic effect on exercise performance.ChromiumMales 35 mcg/d\n\nFemales 25 mcg/d (ages 19–50)Chromium, commonly sold as chromium picolinate, has been marketed with claims that the supplement will increase lean body mass and decrease body fat levels.Animal research indicates that chromium supplementation increases lean body mass and reduces body fat. Early research on humans reported similar results [285], however, more recent well-controlled studies reported that chromium supplementation (200 to 800 mcg/d) does not improve lean body mass or reduce body fat [287, 291].IronMales 8 mg/d\n\nFemales 18 mg/d (age 19–50)Iron supplements are used to increase aerobic performance in sports that use the oxygen system. Iron is a component of hemoglobin in the red blood cell, which is a carrier of oxygen.Most research shows that iron supplements do not appear to improve aerobic performance unless the athlete is iron-depleted and/or has anemia [729].MagnesiumMales 420\n\nFemales 320Activates enzymes involved in protein synthesis. Involved in ATP reactions. Serum levels decrease with exercise. Some suggest that magnesium supplementation may improve energy metabolism/ATP availability.Most well-controlled research indicates that magnesium supplementation (500 mg/d) does not affect exercise performance in athletes unless there is a deficiency [730, 731].Phosphorus (phosphate salts)700 mg/dPhosphate has been studied for its ability to improve all three energy systems, primarily the oxygen system or aerobic capacity.Recent well-controlled research studies reported that sodium phosphate supplementation (4 g/d for 3 d) improved the oxygen energy system in endurance tasks [504–506]. There appears to be little ergogenic value of other forms of phosphate (i.e., calcium phosphate, potassium phosphate). More research is needed to determine the mechanism for improvement.Potassium2000 mg/daAn electrolyte that helps regulate fluid balance, nerve transmission, and acid-base balance. Some suggest excessive increases or decreases in potassium may predispose athletes to cramping.Although potassium loss during intense exercise in the heat has been anecdotally associated with muscle cramping, the etiology of cramping is unknown [732, 733]. It is unclear whether potassium supplementation in athletes decreases the incidence of muscle cramping [160]. No ergogenic effects reported.Selenium55 mcg/dMarketed as a supplement to increase aerobic exercise performance. Working closely with vitamin E and glutathione peroxidase (an antioxidant), selenium may destroy destructive free radical production of lipids during aerobic exercise.Although selenium may reduce lipid peroxidation during aerobic exercise, improvements in aerobic capacity have not been demonstrated [734, 735].Sodium500 mg/daDuring the first several days of intense training in the heat, a greater amount of sodium is lost in sweat. Additionally, prolonged ultraendurance exercise may decrease sodium levels leading to hyponatremia. Increasing salt availability during heavy training in the heat has been shown to help maintain fluid balance and prevent hyponatremia [160, 736].Vanadyl sulfate (vanadium)NoneVanadium may be involved in reactions in the body that produce insulin-like effects on protein and glucose metabolism. Due to the anabolic nature of insulin, this has brought attention to vanadium as a supplement to increase muscle mass, enhance strength and power.Limited research has shown that type 2 diabetics may improve their glucose control; however, there is no proof that vanadyl sulfate has any effect on muscle mass, strength, or power [412, 413].ZincMales 11 mg/d\n\nFemales 8 mg/dConstituent of enzymes involved in digestion. Associated with immunity. Theorized to reduce incidence of upper respiratory tract infections in athletes involved in heavy training.Studies indicate that zinc supplementation (25 mg/d) during training minimized exercise-induced changes in immune function [125, 698, 737, 738].\n\nWater\n\nThe most important nutritional ergogenic aid for athletes is water and limiting dehydration during exercise is one of the most effective ways to maintain exercise capacity. Before starting exercise, it is highly recommended that individuals are adequately hydrated [162]. Exercise performance can be significantly impaired when 2% or more of body weight is lost through sweat (i.e., a 1.4 kg body weight loss from a 70-kg athlete). When one considers that average sweat rates are reported to be 0.5–2.0 L/hour during exercise and training [128, 162], performance losses due to water loss can occur after just 60–90 min of exercise. Further, weight loss of more than 4% of body weight during exercise may lead to heat illness, heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and possibly death [128]. For this reason, it is critical that athletes adopt a mind set to prevent dehydration first by promoting optimal levels of pre-exercise hydration. Throughout the day and without any consideration of when exercise is occurring, a key goal is for an athlete to drink enough fluids to ma"
