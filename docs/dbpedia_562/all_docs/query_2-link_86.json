        "text": "KENS 5 anchor Barry Davis has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. He made the announcement on-air yesterday.\n\n“I have clinical Stage III prostate cancer, and it’s scary. Men, I’ve stayed on top of my health for years. If it’s caught early enough, prostate cancer is one of the most treatable and curable forms of cancer,” the San Antonio anchor said.\n\nThe 59 year old is the morning and noon anchor for the Tegna-owned CBS affiliate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThursday was Davis’ last day on air, he will undergo surgery today to remove his prostate.\n\nDavis documented the days after his diagnosis. He estimates the recovery will take about three weeks and vowed to be back on the air soon."
