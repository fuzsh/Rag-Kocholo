        "text": "Penny Stocks, Big-Bucks Fraud --- Aided by a Tipster, Feds Bring a Vast Scheme to Light By Eric J. Savitz 2,455 words 6 December 1993 Barron's PAGE 19 English (Copyright (c) 1993, Dow Jones & Co., Inc.) WHEN last we left him, in a Barron's story on March 25, 1991, the admitted pennystock flim-flam artist <strong>Barry</strong> K. <strong>Davis</strong> was dividing his days between two pursuits. Some of the time he was providing hot tips to investors, via a 900-number telephone service called Wall Street Watch. The rest of the time he was providing hot tips to the government, finking on his friends and trying to keep himself out of jail. Sometimes, hot tips pay off big time. In mid-November, the U.S. Attorney's office in Newark, N.J., announced the indictment of five men tied to <strong>Davis</strong>, accusing them of wire fraud, securities fraud and criminal conspiracy in the manipulation of several over-thecounter stocks in 1988. The stocks included Vista Capital Corp., Castleton Investors Corp. and Bellatrix Corp. That trading in those issues wasn't entirely kosher is no revelation: In February 1991, <strong>Davis</strong> pleaded guilty to three counts of wire fraud and one count each of securities fraud and conspiracy for his part in the manipulation of at least five stocks -- including Vista, Castleton and Bellatrix. The defendants in the case face a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each count. Under the <strong>com</strong>plex federal sentencing guidelines, <strong>Davis</strong> faces the prospect of 37 to 46 months in the pokey, although the judge will take into account his cooperation with the prosecution. And the government apparently has kept him busy. More than two years after entering his guilty plea, <strong>Davis</strong> has yet to be sentenced -- and no date will be set until the <strong>com</strong>pletion of his cooperation. Which is not to say <strong>Davis</strong> won't soon be spending some time in court. When the five go to trial, likely some time next year, <strong>Davis</strong> will undoubtedly be the prosecution's star witness, and his <strong>com</strong>mand performance will make a lot of people nervous. \"Who do you think in the penny-stock market didn't do something wrong?\" thundered the always-loquacious <strong>Davis</strong> in an interview with Barron's in 1991. \"My answer to you is that every single person I know did something wrong. If you called me on the phone, you did something wrong. . . . Major cases are going to get popped. And major people.\" Indeed. The information supplied to the government by <strong>Davis</strong> and the other admitted conspirators, in <strong>com</strong>bination with wiretapped conversations and other evidence, has helped unveil a <strong>com</strong>plex ring of stock fraud reaching into the ugliest corners of the securities business. By the government's count, the scheme involved more than 100 people at brokerage firms across the country. A brief look at the cast of characters and how they do business should make anyone think twice about investing in penny stocks and blind pools. The five men recently indicted raises the number of accused or admitted participants in the scheme to 11. Including <strong>Davis</strong>, six have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the government. The first four pleas came in April 1990, all from persons associated with Sheffield Securities, a defunct Fort Lauderdale, Fla., brokerage that underwrote initial public offerings for Vista, Castleton and Bellatrix.
