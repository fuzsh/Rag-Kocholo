        "text": " At Navy: Enters the fall second on the depth chart with fellow senior Travis Bridges at nose guard ... has good size and can plug up the middle against the run ... powerful player that stays low to the ground ... has earned one varsity letter.\n\n 2012: Played in all 13 contests, starting 10 ... turned in two tackles against Arizona State in the Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl ... involved in perhaps the biggest play of the game in Navy's 17-13 Star Game victory over Army ... recovered an errant exchange between Army QB Trent Steelman and Larry Dixon at the Navy 13-yard line with 1:04 remaining in the game that sealed Navy's win ... it was Dabney's first career fumble recovery ... member of the Mids' defensive unit that held Texas State scoreless for the first 42 minutes of the game ... chipped in a tackle in the Mids' Senior Day win over Texas State ... after surrendering the game's first 10 points, part of a Navy defense that held Florida Atlantic scoreless for the better part of 30 minutes between the second and fourth quarters (8:57 2nd - 9:07 4th) ... turned in a pair of tackles against the Owls ... contributed three tackles in Navy's Homecoming win over Indiana ... part of a defense that held the Chippewas to a season-low 221 yards total offense (70 rush, 151 pass) and 12 first downs ... the 70 yards rushing by the Chippewas were the fewest yards rushing by a Navy opponent since Missouri rushed for 65 yards on 26 carries in the 2009 Texas Bowl ... registered a career-high six stops in the win over Air Force ... part of a defense that did not allow a touchdown in nine consecutive quarters (Penn State fourth quarter - San Jose State) ... the streak was the best by a Navy defense since 2008 when the Mids did not allow a touchdown for 10 straight quarters (fourth quarter against Notre Dame, shut out Northern Illinois, shut out Army and did not allow a first quarter point to Wake Forest) ... part of a defensive unit that held VMI scoreless for the final 53-plus minutes of action ... held the Keydets to just a field goal in the opening quarter, marking the first time Navy's defense did not surrender a touchdown to its opponent since 2009 when defeating Army, 17-3 ... chipped in three tackles against the Keydets ... contributed a career-high three tackles, including two solo stops at Penn State ... made his first-collegiate start in the Mids' opener against Notre Dame ... contributed a tackle against the Irish.\n\n 2011: Saw his first career action against Rutgers, playing three plays.\n\n 2010: Did not see any varsity action."
