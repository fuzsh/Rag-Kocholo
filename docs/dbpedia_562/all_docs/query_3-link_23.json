        "text": "City in California, United States\n\nCity in California, United States\n\nDavis is the most populous city in Yolo County, California, United States. Located in the Sacramento Valley region of Northern California, the city had a population of 66,850 in 2020,[11] not including the on-campus population of the University of California, Davis, which was over 9,400 (not including students' families) in 2016.[12] As of 2023, there were 40,850 students enrolled at the university.[13]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nDavis sits on land that originally belonged to the Indigenous Patwin, a southern branch of Wintun people, who were killed or forced from their lands by the 1830s as part of the California Genocide through a combination of mass murders, smallpox and other diseases, and both Mexican and American systems of Indigenous slavery.[14][15][16] Patwin burial grounds have been found across Davis, including on the site of the UC Davis Mondavi Center.[17] After the killing and expulsion of the Patwin, territory that eventually became Davis emerged from one of California's most complicated ranchos, Laguna de Santos Callé.[18] The 1852 Land Commission concurred with US Attorneys who argued that the grant was \"fraudulent in all its parts,\" and in his 1860 District Court ruling Justice Ogden Hoffman observed that \"It is impossible to contemplate without disgust the series of perjuries which compose the record\" of the land grant.[18] Nevertheless, Jerome C. Davis, a prominent farmer and one of the early claimants to land in Laguna de Santos Callé, lobbied all the way to the United States Congress in order to retain the land that eventually became Davis.[18][19] Davis became a depot on the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1868, when it was named \"Davisville\" after Jerome C. Davis.[20] However, the post office at Davisville shortened the town name to \"Davis\" in 1907. The name stuck, and the city of Davis was incorporated on March 28, 1917.[21]\n\nFrom its inception as a farming community, Davis is known primarily for its contributions to agricultural policy along with veterinary care and animal husbandry. Following the passage of the University Farm Bill in 1905 by the California State Legislature, Governor George Pardee selected Davis out of 50 other sites as the future home to the University of California's University Farm, officially opening to students in 1908.[22] The farm, later renamed the Northern Branch of the College of Agriculture in 1922, was upgraded to become the seventh UC general campus, the University of California, Davis, in 1959.\n\nGeography and environment\n\n[edit]\n\nLocation\n\n[edit]\n\nDavis is located in Yolo County, California, 11 mi (18 km) west of Sacramento, 70 mi (113 km) northeast of San Francisco, 385 mi (619 km) north of Los Angeles, at the intersection of Interstate 80 and State Route 113. Neighboring towns include Dixon, Winters, Woodland, and West Sacramento.\n\nDavis lies in the Sacramento Valley, the northern portion of the Central Valley, in Northern California, at an elevation of about 52 feet (16 m) above sea level.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 10.5 square miles (27 km2). 10.4 square miles (27 km2) of it is land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) of it (0.19%) is water.\n\nThe topography is flat, which has helped Davis to become known as a haven for bicyclists.[23]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Davis climate resembles that of nearby Sacramento and is typical of California's Central Valley Mediterranean climate region: warm and dry in the spring, summer and autumn, and cool and wet in the winter. It is classified as a Köppen Csa climate. Summer days are hot, ranging from 85 to 105 °F (29 to 41 °C), but the nights turn pleasantly cool, almost always dropping below 70 °F (21 °C). The Delta Breeze, a flow of cool marine air originating from the Pacific Ocean via San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, frequently provides relief in the evening. Winter temperatures generally reach between 45 and 65 °F (7 and 18 °C) in the afternoon; nights average at about 35 to 40 °F (2 to 4 °C), but occasionally fall below freezing.\n\nAverage temperatures range from 46 °F (8 °C) in December and January to 75 °F (24 °C) in July and August. Thick ground fog called tule fog settles into Davis during late fall and winter. This fog can be dense, with visibility nearly zero. As in other areas of northern California, the tule fog is a leading cause of road accidents in the winter season.\n\nMean rainfall per annum is about 20 inches (510 mm). The bulk of rain occurs between about mid-November to mid-March, with typically no precipitation falling from mid-June to mid-September.[24]\n\nRecord temperatures range from a high of 116 °F (47 °C) on July 17, 1925, to a low of 12 °F (−11 °C) on December 11, 1932.[25]\n\nNeighborhoods\n\n[edit]\n\nDavis is internally divided by two freeways (Interstate 80 and State Route 113), a north–south railroad (California Northern), an east–west mainline (Union Pacific) and several major streets. The city is unofficially divided into six main districts made up of smaller neighborhoods (often originally named as housing subdivisions):\n\nCentral Davis, north of Fifth Street and Russell Boulevard, south of Covell Blvd., east of SR 113, and west of the railroad tracks running along G Street. Within these boundaries is the officially denoted neighborhood of Old North Davis, which is sometimes also considered part of Downtown.[28][better source needed]\n\nDowntown Davis, roughly the numbered-and-lettered grid north of I-80, south of Fifth Street, east of A Street, and west of the railroad tracks, including the Aggie Village and Olive Drive areas.[29]\n\nEast Davis, north of I-80, south of Covell Blvd., and east of the railroad tracks. It includes the older, 'inner' East Davis of lettered streets and neighborhoods such as Davis Manor, Chestnut, and Rancho Yolo, as well as more distinctly identified (in some cases walled-in) subdivisions such as Mace Ranch, Lake Alhambra Estates, and Wildhorse. [citation needed]\n\nNorth Davis, north of Covell Blvd. North Davis includes Covell Park, Senda Nueva, Northstar, and North Davis Farms.\n\nSouth Davis, south of I-80, and includes Willowbank. El Macero, California, although outside the city limits, is sometimes considered part of South Davis; El Macero is part of the Davis Joint Unified School District, and El Macero children who attend public schools attend Davis' public schools. [citation needed]\n\nWest Davis, north of I-80 and west of SR 113. West Davis includes Westwood, Evergreen, Aspen, Stonegate (west of Lake Boulevard and including Stonegate Lake and the Stonegate Country Club) and the eco-friendly Village Homes development, known for its solar-powered houses.\n\nThe University of California, Davis is located south of Russell Boulevard and west of A Street and then south of 1st Street. The land occupied by the university is not incorporated within the boundaries of the city of Davis and lies within both Yolo and Solano Counties.\n\nEnvironment\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal energy planning began in Davis after the energy crisis of 1973. A new building code promoted energy efficiency. Energy use in buildings decreased dramatically and in 1981 Davis citizens won a $100,000 prize from utility PG&E, for cutting electricity use during the summer peak.[30]\n\nOn November 14, 1984, the Davis City Council declared the city to be a nuclear-free zone.[31] In 1998, the City passed a \"Dark Skies\" ordinance in an effort to reduce light pollution in the night sky.[32]\n\nIn 2013, Davis became part of the state Cool Roof Initiative with the \"CoolDavis\" campaign, requiring all new roofing projects to meet Cool Roof Rating Council (CRRC) requirements, including the installation of light-colored roofs. The aim is to reflect more sunlight back into space via the albedo effect, and reduce the amount of heat absorbed in hopes of limiting climate change.[33]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1880441—189054724.0%1920939—19301,24332.4%19401,67234.5%19503,554112.6%19608,910150.7%197023,488163.6%198036,64056.0%199046,20926.1%200060,30830.5%201065,6228.8%202066,8501.9%2024 (est.)65,054[34]−2.7%\n\nDavis is part of the Sacramento–Arden-Arcade–Roseville Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\n2020\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the 2020 Census the population of Davis was 66,850 people.

In 2010, Davis became the new home of the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame.\n\nBicycle infrastructure became a political issue in the 1960s, culminating in the election of a pro-bicycle majority to the City Council in 1966.[45] By the early 1970s, Davis became a pioneer in the implementation of cycling facilities. As the city expands, new facilities are usually mandated. As a result, Davis residents today enjoy an extensive network of bike lanes, bike paths, and grade-separated bicycle crossings.[46][47] The flat terrain and temperate climate are also conducive to bicycling.[48]\n\nIn 2005 the Bicycle-Friendly Community program of the League of American Bicyclists recognized Davis as the first Platinum Level city in the US[49][50] Bicycling appears to be declining among Davis residents: from 1990 to 2000, the US Census Bureau reported a decline in the fraction of commuters traveling by bicycle, from 22 percent to 15 percent.[51] This resulted in the reestablishment of the city's Bicycle Advisory Commission and creation of advocate groups such as \"Davis Bicycles!\". In 2016, Fifth Street, a main road in Davis was converted from four lanes to two lanes to allow for bicycle lanes and encourage more bicycling.\n\nIn 1996, 2001, 2006, and 2009 the UC Davis \"Cal Aggie Cycling\" Team won the national road cycling competition.[52] The team also competes off-road and on the track, and has competed in the national competitions of these disciplines. In 2007, UC Davis also organized a record breaking bicycle parade numbering 822 bicycles.[53]\n\nSights and culture\n\n[edit]\n\nWhole Earth Festival\n\n[edit]\n\nA continuous stream of bands, speakers and various workshops occurs throughout Mother's Day weekend on each of Whole Earth Festival's (WEF) three stages and other specialty areas. The WEF is organized entirely by UC Davis students, in association with the Associated Students of UC Davis and the university.\n\nCelebrate Davis\n\n[edit]\n\nCelebrate Davis is the annual free festival held by the Davis Chamber of Commerce. It features booths by Davis businesses, live music, food vendors, live animals, activities like rock climbing and zip-line. It concludes with fireworks after dark. Parking is problematic, so most people ride their bikes and use the free valet parking.\n\nPicnic Day\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Picnic Day (UC Davis)\n\nPicnic Day is an annual event at the University of California, Davis and is always held on the third Saturday in April. It is the largest student-run event in the US. Picnic Day starts off with a parade, which features the UC Davis California Aggie Marching Band-uh!, and runs through campus and around downtown Davis and ends with the Battle of the Bands, which lasts until the last band stops playing (sometimes until 2 am). There are over 150 free events and over 50,000 attend every year. Other highlights include: the Dachshund races, a.k.a. the Doxie Derby, held in the Pavilion; the Davis Rock Challenge, the Chemistry Magic Show, and the sheep dog trials. Many departments have exhibits and demonstrations, such as the Cole Facility, which until recently showed a fistulated cow (a cow that has been fitted with a plastic portal (a \"fistula\") into its digestive system to observe digestion processes). Its name was \"Hole-y Cow\".\n\nDavis Transmedia Art Walk\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Davis Transmedia Art Walk is a free—self-guided—public art tour includes 23 public murals, 16 sculptures, and 15 galleries and museums all in downtown Davis and the University of Davis campus. A free Davis Art Walk map serves as a detailed guide to the entire collection. The art pieces are all within walking distance of each other. The walk is a roughly circuitous path that can be completed within an hour or two. Every piece of art on the Art Walk has been embedded with an RFID chip. Using a cellphone that supports this technology, you access multimedia files that relate to each work. You can even leave a comment or \"burn your own message\" for other visitors to see. Artist hosted tours are held on the weekend by appointment only. To pick up a copy of the Davis Art Walk map, visit the Yolo County Visitors Bureau (132 E St., Suite 200; (530) 297–1900) or the John Natsoulas Center for the Arts (521 1st St.; (530) 756–3938).\n\nManetti Shrem Museum of Art\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Manetti Shrem Museum of Art, located on the UC Davis campus, opened on November 13, 2016, and carries on the legacy of the university's world-renowned first generation art faculty, which contributed to innovations in conceptual, performance and video art in the 1960s and 70s. The museum has generated nationwide attention with exhibits by artists such as Wayne Thiebaud, Bruce Nauman, John Cage, and Robert Arneson as well as its striking architecture, featuring a 50,000 square-foot “Grand Canopy” of perforated aluminum triangular beams, supported by 40 steel columns. Every year the museum exhibits works by graduating art students. The museum is free and hosts lecture series and events throughout the year, as well as weekend art studio activities for all ages.\n\nMondavi Center\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Mondavi Center\n\nThe Mondavi Center, located on the UC Davis campus, is one of the biggest non-seasonal attractions in Davis. The Mondavi Center is a theater which hosts many world-class touring acts, including star performers such as Yo-Yo Ma, Yitzhak Perlman and Wynton Marsalis, and draws a large audience from Sacramento.\n\nUC Davis Arboretum\n\n[edit]\n\nThe UC Davis Arboretum is an arboretum and botanical garden. Plants from all over the world grow in different sections of the park. There are notable oak and native plant collections and a small redwood grove. A small waterway spans the arboretum along the bed of the old North Fork of Putah Creek. Occasionally herons[which?], kingfishers[which?], and cormorants[which?] can be seen around the waterways, as well as the ever-present ducks. Tours of the arboretum led by volunteer naturalists are often held for grade-school children.\n\nThe Domes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Domes (AKA Baggins End Innovative Housing) is an on-campus cooperative housing community designed by project manager Ron Swenson and future student-residents in 1972. Consisting of 14 polyurethane foam-insulated fiberglass domes and located in the Sustainable Research Area at the western end of Orchard Road, it is governed by its 26 UCD student residents. It is one of the few student co-housing cooperative communities in the US, and is an early example of the modern-day growing tiny house movement. The community has successfully resisted several threats to its continuation over the years.\n\nFarmers Market\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Davis Farmers Market[54] is held every Wednesday evening and Saturday morning. Participants sell a range of fruits and vegetables, baked goods, dairy and meat products (often from certified organic farms), crafts, and plants and flowers. From April to October, the market hosts Picnic in the Park, with musical events and food sold from restaurant stands.[55]\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nDavis has one newspaper, The Davis Enterprise, a thrice-weekly[56] newspaper founded in 1897. UC Davis also has a weekly newspaper called The California Aggie that covers campus, local and national news. Davis Media Access, a community media center, is the umbrella organization of television station DCTV.[57] There are also numerous commercial stations broadcasting from nearby Sacramento. Davis has two community radio stations: KDVS 90.3 FM, on the University of California campus, and KDRT 95.7 FM, a subsidiary of Davis Media Access and one of the first low-power FM radio stations in the United States. Davis has the world's largest English-language local wiki, DavisWiki. In 2006, The People's Vanguard of Davis began news reporting about the city of Davis, the Davis Joint Unified School District, the county of Yolo, and the Sacramento area.[58]\n\nToad Tunnel\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Amphibian and reptile tunnel\n\nDavis' Toad Tunnel is a wildlife crossing that was constructed in 1995 and has drawn much attention over the years, including a mention on The Daily Show. Because of the building of an overpass, animal lovers worried about toads being killed by cars commuting from South Davis to North Davis, since the toads traveled from one side of a dirt lot (which the overpass replaced) to the reservoir at the other end. After much controversy, a decision was made to build a toad tunnel, which runs beneath the Pole Line Road overpass which crosses Interstate 80. The project cost $14,000, equivalent to $28,000 in 2023.[59] The tunnel is 21 inches (53 cm) wide and 18 inches (46 cm) high.\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nUniversity of California\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: University of California, Davis\n\nThe University of California, Davis, or UC Davis, a campus of the University of California, had a 2019 Fall enrollment of 38,369 students.[60] UC Davis has a dominant influence on the social and cultural life of the town.\n\nD-Q University\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: D-Q University\n\nAlso known as Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl University, D-Q University was a two-year institution located on Road 31 in Yolo County 6.7 miles (10.8 km) west of State Route 113 which closed in 2005. The curriculum was said[by whom?] to include heritage and traditional American Indian ceremonies. The 643 acres (2.60 km2) and 5 buildings were formerly a military reservation according to the National Park Service publication Five Views.[citation needed] According to some tribal members,[who?] use of the spelled-out name of the university can be offensive, and the institution should only be referred to as D-Q University. Tribal members in appropriate circumstances may use the full name.[citation needed]\n\nOther colleges\n\n[edit]\n\nAn off-campus branch of Sacramento City College is located in Davis. The satellite is located in West Village, an area built by UC Davis to house students and others affiliated with the university.\n\nPublic schools\n\n[edit]\n\nDavis' public school system is administrated by the Davis Joint Unified School District.\n\nThe city has nine public elementary schools (North Davis, Birch Lane, Pioneer Elementary, Patwin, Cesar Chavez, Robert E. Willett, Marguerite Montgomery, Fred T. Korematsu at Mace Ranch, and Fairfield Elementary (which is outside the city limits but opened in 1866 and is Davis Joint Unified School District's oldest public school)). Davis has one school for independent study (Davis School for Independent Study), four public junior high schools (Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Frances Harper, and Leonardo da Vinci Junior High), one main high school (Davis Senior High School), one alternative high school (Martin Luther King High School), and a small project based high school (Leonardo da Vinci High School). Cesar Chavez is a Spanish immersion school, with no English integration until the third grade. The junior high schools contain grades 7 through 9. Due to a decline in the school-age population in Davis, two of the elementary schools in south Davis may have their district boundaries changed, or magnet programs may be moved to equalize enrollment. Valley Oak was closed after the 2007–08 school year, and their campus was granted to Da Vinci High (which had formerly been located in the back of Davis Senior High's campus) and a special-ed preschool. On average, class size is about 25 students for every teacher.[61]\n\nAt one time, Chavez and Willett were incorporated together to provide elementary education K–6 to both English-speaking and Spanish immersion students in West Davis. César Chávez served grades K–3 and was called West Davis Elementary, and Robert E. Willett (named for a long-time teacher at the school, now deceased) served grades 4–6 and was known as West Davis Intermediate. Willett now serves K–6 English-speaking students, and Chavez supports the Spanish immersion program for K–6.\n\nPrivate schools\n\n[edit]\n\nDavis Waldorf School (Pre-K–8)\n\nPeregrine School (Pre-K–6)\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nThese are some notable Davis residents, other than UC Davis faculty who were not previously from Davis.\n\nSister cities\n\n[edit]\n\nDavis' sister cities are:[65]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCalifornia portal\n\n2023 Davis, California stabbings\n\nDavis Community Church, 1800s structure, congregation\n\nLake Davis, California\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
