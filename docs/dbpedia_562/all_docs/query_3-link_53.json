        "text": "Pregnant females do not prepare elaborate dens. It seems matter that it provides a refuge from predators (coyotes, golden eagles, other cougars) and shields the litter from heavy rain and hot sun. Dens rarely contain any bedding for the young, though a mothers soft belly hair was found in one.(2)- (This also contradicts the popular misconception, perpetuated largely by some nature movies, that cougars always choose caves as dens.)(6)\n\nNewborn mountain lions enter the world as buff brown balls of fur weighing slightly more than a pound.(1) Biologists call them kittens or cubs either is correct. Their eyes and ear canals are closed, their coats are covered with blackish brown spots, and their tails are dark-ringed.(2) This color pattern provides excellent protective camouflage.\n\nKittens begin nursing within minutes after birth and gain weight rapidly, with males tending to outpace females.(1) Nursing mothers have eight teats but apparently only six produce milk. Kittens start to compete for nipples the first day and generally suckle the same nipple whenever nursing.(4) At two weeks of age the kittens’ eyes and ears are opened and they are able to walk. Within 10 to 20 days the kittens may weigh over two pounds. They begin to move awkwardly about, exploring the rock overhang, brushy thicket, or pile of boulders that serves as their den.(5)\n\nWhile suckling her young the mother must occasionally leave the den to hunt. This is the time of her most restricted movement, because she does not want to venture too far from her vulnerable kittens. Still, she must hunt to sustain herself and replenish her milk. While hunting the female cougar remains within a fixed area called a home range. Varying in size from 25 to 400 square miles,(7,8) home ranges are restricted areas of use in which cougars confine their movements while hunting, searching for a mate, or raising young. Biologists refer to the cougars that occupy home ranges as residents. Possession of a home range is critically important to a female cougar because it increases her litter’s chances for survival by guaranteeing an established hunting area for the mother.\n\n…kittens learn early to move around their range and not imprint upon a single home site.\n\nBy the time kittens are weaned at 2 to 3 months, the mother has moved the litter to one or more additional den sites throughout her home range. This provides greater protection for the young and may be one reason she does not construct elaborate dens. In his book Soul Among Lions, Arizona cougar specialist Harley Shaw explains that there are other advantages to such behavior: “…kittens learn early to move around their range and not imprint upon a single home site. Home is the entire area of use. Within it, lions are free to move, hunt, and rest as their mood and physiology directs. They are not handicapped the human compulsion to return to a single safe base at night. Home is a large tract of land that they undoubtedly come to know as you and I know the floorplan of our house. They learn to be lions in this home area.”(6)\n\nThe physical metamorphosis of young, growing cougars is dramatic, especially their teeth and coat. Teeth are critical to a cougar’s survival, so the teeth in young cougars develop quickly. Their large canines (or fangs) allow them to capture and kill prey, while their specially adapted molars (called carnassials) are used to cut through tissue while feeding. Canines first appear at age 20 to 30 days, followed by the molars at 30 to 50 days. Permanent teeth start replacing primary (baby) teeth at about 5 1/2 months. The permanent canines first appear at month eight, and for a short time both permanent and primary canines are present.(3)\n\nAs an adult cougar’s tawny coat provides camouflage while stalking prey, a kitten’s spots provide camouflage from predators. Kittens begin to lose these spots at 12 to 14 weeks, they fade rapidly but are still obvious at 8 months, less so at one year. By 15 months the markings are visible only on the hindquarters and only under certain light conditions. In some cougars, the stripes on the upper foreleg are still visible at 3 years of age.(3,9)\n\nThe mountain lion’s coat is not the only feature that changes color with age. Their eyes, light blue at birth, begin to change at four months and are the golden brown of adults by 16 to 17 months.(3,9)\n\nGROWING UP AND LEAVING HOME\n\nFemale cougars probably begin leading their kittens to kills as early as 7 to 8 weeks. The mother also carries meat to her young from kills until weaning age (2 to 3 months), at which point the cubs weigh in at between 7 and 9 pounds. As the kittens grow older, the mother will leave them at kills, frequently for days at a time, while she goes in search of the next prey.(6) As the kittens grow and become stronger, the mother will range farther in search of prey.\n\nBiologists have frequently noted how intensely a female with kittens uses her home range. This is most concentrated subsequent to birth, then expands as the kittens are able to accompany her to kills. It’s easy to imagine an insistent mother as she drags, pushes, and urges her kittens along over the many miles between kills. She expends an enormous amount of energy feeding her growing litter. As a result, the density of prey in the mother’s home range affects how well she can provide for her young, which in turn influences their likelihood of survival.\n\nArrival at a kill is a time of both feeding and play for kittens. Vegetation is frequently disturbed for 50 feet surrounding the carcass. Grass is flattened, limbs are broken off trees and trunks are covered with the kittens’ claw marks. The carcass is more fully consumed than it would be by an adult lion alone, and pieces of hair and bone are scattered about. This rambunctious play by the young at a kill is another part of their training as predators. They will stalk, attack, and wrestle with their siblings or mother, as if they were the next meal rather than their own flesh and blood. Ultimately, though, play gives way to the real thing.\n\nAs they grow stronger and more skilled at stalking, kittens will separate from their mother for days at a time and hunt on their own. This growing independence is a precursor to young lions leaving their mother and going in search their own home range. Biologists are not certain whether a mother and her young gradually grow apart, with the kittens gradually leaving of their own accord, or whether she abandons them as do female black bears with their young. Sonny Bass has found the latter to the case in Florida. “My experience with Florida panthers in the Everglades based on daily tracking) indicates that the mother leaves the young.”(10) Seidensticker tells of one Idaho cougar that abandoned her kittens at a kill.(11) Paul Beier, who studied mountain lions in southern California, believes the mother discourages her kittens from remaining with her. “Some sort of agonistic behavior on the part of the mother is necessary to discourage the young from staying. Simply abandoning the young is not possible because they know where to find her.”(12) The presence of mature resident males attracted to the female, who by now is in heat, may also discourage the young from remaining. However they separate, the kittens are finally on their own and the mother will come into heat and breed again.(6)\n\nKittens can survive on their own as early as 6 months, such as when the mother is killed or dies of natural causes, but this appears to be rare. Typically, the young cougars will remain with their mother for 12 to 18 months. This allows them to hone their hunting skills and gives them time to develop their killing bite.(14) This bite is usually delivered to the back of the neck of large prey, severing the spinal cord and causing almost immediate death. To be executed efficiently, the bite requires practice and development of the cougar’s powerful jaw muscles. Evidence seems to indicate that the behavioral patterns of killing prey may be innate, but that selection of appropriate prey and stalking may require practice to acquire the necessary skill.(1,2,6) This may explain why young cougars are sometimes found with a face full of porcupine quills, or are the culprits in attacks on domestic livestock.\n\nThe departure of young cats from their mother’s home range is called dispersal, and it is a time when the young cougars are especially vulnerable; they expose themselves to the dangers of taking prey without the alternative of food provided by their mother. These young cats called transients, wander far from the familiar home range of their mother and their hunting skill are not as efficient as those of older resident cats. The dispersal ot young transient cougars out of their birth areas is crucial, however, as it reduces inbreeding and provides new blood to outlying populations.(9)\n\nMATING\n\nBoth male and female cougars are sexually mature at 24 months, but females have been known to breed as early as 20 months;(9) a Florida panther was recently reported as having given birth before she was 2 years old.(15) The age of the first breeding may be delayed until the female has established a home range.(16)\n\nWhen it comes time to mate, the first challenge facing a male and female cougar is finding each other. Solitary and territorial by nature, cougars are frequently scattered over hundreds of miles of rugged terrain. It further complicates the matter that females are receptive to males for only a few days out of each month;(17) however, it appears to be the lions’ territorial habits and keen senses that ultimately allow them to come together.\n\nPolygamy seems to be the rule for both male and female mountain lions. Males occupy larger home ranges than females, and a resident male with a large home range typically overlaps or encompasses the home ranges of several resident females. Nevertheless, in stable cougar populations with established home ranges, females rarely mate with more than one resident male during a breeding cycle.(9)\n\nResident male cougars use scrapes as visual and olfactory signals to other cougars and to mark their home range area. A scrape (or scratch) is a collection of pine needles. leaves, or dirt scraped into a pile with either the forepaw or hindpaws. Occasionally they urinate or defecate on the pile. Scrapes are made throughout the home range and are frequently located along travelways under a tree(18,19) or along ridges. Females rarely scrape, more commonly burying their feces under mounds of dirt and debris; these mounds are usually found near large kills.(19)\n\nMountain lion authority Fred Lindzey believes scrapes help mountain lions both avoid and locate each other. “Scrapes are definitely a means of communication. They broadcast the resident male’s presence to other males (residents and transients) and to females. Females may use scrapes made by the resident male to both avoid him when she has dependent kittens and to find him when she is in estrus.”(20)\n\nAdult males probably spend most of their time searching for receptive females.(21) When mating does occur, it usually takes place in the female’s home range, with the male seeking out the female.(6) The female’s estrous cycle lasts approximately 23 days and she is usually in heat for about 8 days. The pair may stay together for up to 3 days, sometimes even sharing a kill.(19)\n\nCougars compensate for long periods of solitude with some of the most vigorous breeding behavior known to exist among mammals. Copulation can occur at a rate of 50 to 70 times in 24 hours for a 7- to 8-day period.(22) Each copulation lasts less than a minute.(2) Such enthusiastic copulation in is thought to stimulate ovulation, (the release of eggs from the ovaries to make them available for fertilization). In his book The Natural History of Wild Cats, Andrew Kitchener explains the advantage of such behavior: “Most cats are thought to be induced ovulators, so that even though the female may come into estrus, no ovulation occurs unless the vagina and cervix of the female are stimulated repeatedly during mating. As a consequence of estrus lasting several days and ovulation being induced, the chance of a successful fertilization can he maximized.”(23) Some biologists speculate that high copulation rates also evolved as a way for females to evaluate male vigor(1) and to ensure that their offspring receive the best genetic endowment.(24)\n\nCougars appear to be as vocal as they are enthusiastic during mating. The “caterwaul,” characteristic in domestic cats, seems to be even louder in mating cougars. Such behavior has been documented both in captive and wild cougars.(9) Paul Bier has heard these sounds coming from mating cougars in his California study area;(12) biologist Susan de Treville, who studied mountain lions in California, was camping on the Malaspina Peninsula in British Columbia when the heard two cougars mating nearby. “Both were screaming loudly. They got to within a foot of my tent, then they gradually moved off. In the morning I found the ground torn up and all the grass flattened.”(25)\n\nAfter 88 to 96 days, the mother retires to the seclusion of the den and gives birth to a litter of 1 to 6 kittens (or cubs). The average litter size is 2 to 3 kittens, but a young female may produce only 1 kitten in her first litter. This seems to reduce the stress on first-time mothers, allowing them to develop their skills in rearing young. Since cougars tend to bear young every other year, a female that lives for 8 to 10 years has the potential to produce 5 litters. One captive cougar produced 7 litters in 16 years.(27) How many of the kittens survive to adulthood is still a mystery. It is also unknown if the number of offspring produced by a female cougar fluctuates in relation to the abundance of prey, as in other predators such as coyotes and barn owls. Few newly born litters have been studied closely in the wild and definitive information is lacking; however, current research underway in Yellowstone National Park and in the San Andres Mountains of New Mexico may provide some answers about the early lives of pumas.\n\nIf a female loses her kittens to predators or other circumstances, she may begin her estrous cycle and breed again soon after the loss.(28) Sometimes, predators include male cougars; studies in Idaho, Utah, and California have documented that males do indeed kill and even eat kittens on occasion. Whether this is an evolved behavior similar to African lions is unknown, but it may partly explain why females with kittens are unreceptive to males and intolerant of their presence until the young are independent and can hunt for themselves. Females also seem to possess the ability to suppress their estrous cycle during the period they are raising young. Some experts speculate that this ability is hormonal in nature and is possibly related to lactation; others suggest that estrous cycles continue normally and the female simply works harder at avoiding males by being careful where she urinates and by burying her feces. Whether this behavior is hormonal, behavioral, or both is unknown.\n\nUnlike most wild animals, cougars can and do give birth throughout the year, although peaks have been documented in different parts of their range. One population in Idaho peaked in the spring,(16) while cougars in parts of Utah and Wyoming(29) had fall birth peaks. Nevada biologists documented birth peaks during June and July and noted 70 percent of all births occurred between April and September.(9) Mountain lions in and around Yellowstone National Park give birth primarily in midsummer.(30) Researcher Allen Anderson looked at the birth dates of 6 wild and 35 captive cougars and discovered that over half (55 percent) of the births occurred during April, June, July, and August.(1)\n\nBiologists long speculated that in temperate climates, births occurring during the warmer months placed less stress on both the mother and kittens; however, as Harley Shaw points out, “Birth in warm months forces the mother to be feeding large young during mid to late winter. This does not reduce stress on her over the long haul.”(31) It has also been suggested that in the warmer climates of Arizona, Florida, and California, births may be more evenly distributed throughout the year. Existing information from these states is inconclusive. Two more aspects of the American lion that have left experts scratching their heads.\n\nDEATH\n\nWhile all cougars enter the world in the same fashion, they leave it in a variety of ways. Existing information indicates that the three primary causes of cougar deaths are humans, natural causes, and accidents.\n\nMore mountain lions die at the hands of humans than any other known cause of death. This is as true today as it was in the past. A minimum of 65,665 cougars were shot, poisoned, trapped, and snared by bounty hunters, federal hunters, and sport hunters from 1907 to 1978 in the 12 western states, British Columbia, and Alberta.(32) This carnage seemed to peak between 1930 and 1955, with the highest numbers of pumas killed in California, British Columbia, and Arizona.(1) This sobering tally does not include the thousands of cougars slaughtered prior to the 1900s nor the untold numbers that have gone unreported since.\n\nToday, cougar hunting is legal in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, and the Canadian provinces at British Columbia and Alberta. During the 1989-1990 sport harvest season more than 2,176 cats were killed.(33) Most of these states allow hunters to kill only one lion per season with the notable exception of Texas, which has the most liberal hunting regulations and places no limits on the number of cats a hunter can take. The cougar enjoys full protection in 24 states and provinces, but has no legal classification and no protection, except in agreement with the Federal Government, in 22 other states and provinces. (3,32)\n\nPredator control programs present yet another obstacle to the cougar’s survival. The U. S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Damage Control (ADC) program was responsible for killing 207 cougars in 11 western states during the 1988 fiscal year because of attacks on domestic livestock.(34)\n\nIn addition to ADC’s efforts, many states carry on their own predator control programs. For instance, in 1988, ADC killed 38 cougars in California, while the state Department of Fish and Game authorized other hunters to take an additional 28 cougars on depredation permits, for a total of 64 cats. This situation is further complicated by the fact that cougars are occasionally caught in traps set for other animals, and because there is no easy way to release them many are killed. The cats can sometimes pull themselves free of the traps, often at the cost of severed toes or broken bones. Cats that escape with minor injuries may still be capable of taking large prey and surviving, while those with debilitating injuries likely die of starvation.(9)\n\nCollisions with motor vehicles are the primary cause of death in Florida panthers.\n\nCollisions with motor vehicles are the primary cause of death in Florida panthers. From 1979 to 1991, almost 50 percent of documented mortality of the Florida cats was due to collisions with autos.(35) In California, 22 mountain lions fell victim to collisions between 1971 and 1976,(7) while researcher Paul Beier lost five lions he was studying to cars.(12) Three young cougars were even killed by a train, all in the same incident, in Colorado.(1)\n\nA number of the cats have drowned in irrigation canals,(36) or by falling into wells.(37) Cougars are capable swimmers, but the smooth concrete banks make escape difficult and the exhausted cats will eventually drown. Unfortunately, such incidents will increase as more cougar habit is encroached upon by humans.\n\nEven in the absence of humans, cougars practice a high-risk lifestyle; they are continuously exposed to injury or death because they prey on animals larger than they are. In Idaho, both male and female pumas kill male elk, an animal seven times the size of a female puma.(38) While deer, more manageable in size, are the cougar’s prey of choice, some do not submit without a struggle. During attacks on deer or elk cougars have been thrown against trees so hard that their backs have been broken or they sustained massive internal injuries. They have been trampled by the hooves of deer and elk they were attacking, and even impaled on branches or antlers.(39) A debilitating injury like a broken bone can lead to starvation.\n\nOther types of accidents include falls from cliffs, being struck by lightning, being hit by rock slides, being poisoned by venomous snakes, and choking.(3) Susan de Treville tells of a mountain lion that died from a violent encounter with a manzanita bush. “We were monitoring an old lion (9-10 years) named Snaggletooth, because he had a broken upper canine. One day we found him lying in an open field-dead. We had no idea what killed him. Later an examination revealed a 5-inch piece of manzanita in the cat’s throat. Apparently, during the final rush at what we think was a deer, the cat ran into a manzanita bush at high speed driving a stab down its throat and severing the carotid artery. Failing eyesight may have been part of the reason Snaggletooth bled to death internally.”(25)\n\nThere are three times during their lives when cougars are most at risk: immediately after birth, immediately after becoming independent transients, and during old age.(3) Kittens left alone at a den or kill are vulnerable to other predators, including, as has been noted, adult male cougars; it is unknown how many kittens survive to maturity, but experts suspect that kitten deaths could equal or exceed the number of cougars killed by sport hunting. Transient cougars spend most of their time in unfamiliar territory and have not honed their hunting skills, so do not hunt as efficiently as resident cougars. Old cougars experience extreme tooth wear and loss in weight, making them less efficient hunters, resulting in starvation. Old age is probably the most significant cause of death in unhunted mountain lion populations; a recent study in southern Utah showed that the annual mortality rate in an unhunted cougar population was a fairly high 26 percent. (26) In Montana’s hunted cougar populations, over 50 percent of the resident adults in one area were killed, according to research conducted there.(40)\n\nAdult cougars do kill and even eat one another on occasion.(1) Fighting has been documented in Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas, Wyoming, and Utah. In one study in the San Andres Mountains of southern New Mexico, fighting was found to the primary cause of death.(41) While in Florida, fighting has led to the death of six endangered panthers over the past 11 years. Of these, two were transient males dispersing from their mother’s home range through home ranges of resident males courting females in heat; two were adult females killed by a young adult male; and the last two were the result of fighting between adult males.(35) Experts speculate that most conflicts are over females and home ranges, but it is still unknown precisely how much fighting contributes to overall mortality in a cougar population.\n\nCougars appear to suffer from relatively few internal and external parasites. Those they do contend with include an assortment of fleas, ticks, mites, and tapeworms. The puma’s solitary lifestyle and its habit of spending little time in dens probably minimizes infestation.(2,3)\n\nDeaths attributable to more serious diseases appear to be uncommon. Only two cases of rabies have been documented in wild mountain lions, one in California in 1909,(42) and a more recent case in Florida.(35) Naturally occurring antibodies to feline distemper were found in 85 percent of the Florida panthers tested.(43) Another mountain lion in California was recently diagnosed with feline leukemia and was killed. California Department of Fish and Game veterinarian Thierry Work thinks the cat may have been infected by eating domestic cats. The feline leukemia virus is frequently fatal and no vaccine for wild cougars exists; this disease especially threatens small, isolated populations of cougars that front on urban areas, such as in southern Florida and southern California. Allen Anderson cautions that the widely held opinion that wild pumas are largely free of parasites and diseases may be due to the lack of specific research rather than reality.(1) Cougar diseases are just one of many aspects of the cat that need further study.\n\nCougar The American Lion Line Illustrations\n\nCopyright (1992-2009) by Linnea Fronce\n\nCHAPTER NOTES\n\nAnderson, A.E. 1983.

The best example of this is the cat’s enormous geographic range. Cougars seem equally at home in Alberta’s alpine forests, Arizona’s Sonoran Desert, or Mexico’s tropical jungles. While the lions don’t seem particular about where they live, studies show that the cats do prefer certain types of terrain and vegetation. Habitat, a space and an environment suited to a particular species, and geographic range, a broader term indicating the map area in which a species occurs, are important concepts in understanding cougar life.(1) One expects to find cougars only in suitable habitats within a geographic range, and suitable cougar habitat contains two elements: cover and large prey.\n\nBiologists marvel at the cougar’s remarkable adaptability.\n\nMountain lions are stalking predators that must get close to their prey before ambushing from a short distance. They will take advantage of terrain (steep canyons, rock outcroppings, boulders) or vegetation (dense brush, thickets) to remain hidden while stalking. Cover refers to this combination of terrain and vegetation that allows the cat to stay out of sight while hunting and stalking; habitats that have good stalking cover attract mountain lions. Cover also helps protect the female cougar’s vulnerable kittens. (In The Cycle of Life Chapter I explained how a dense thicket or pile of boulders is used as a den. This is what we mean by protective cover.)\n\nEven the best stalking cover is of no value, however, if there is nothing to stalk. Deer are the lion’s primary prey-mule deer in western North America and white tailed deer in eastern North America(2)-and deer must be present in sufficient numbers in the lion’s habitat for the cat to survive.(3) While lions will take a variety of prey, killing one deer is more energy-efficient than killing several rabbits or squirrels, allowing the cat to procure a lot of fresh meat at once. This is particularly important to females with hungry kittens to feed. Since the presence of cougars in an area is largely dependent on the presence of deer, it is important to understand what makes up good deer habitat.\n\nLike cougar habitat, suitable deer habitat must contain a combination of cover and food. But because deer are ungulates (hoofed, plant-eating mammals) they use both resources differently. Where the puma requires stalking cover, deer need escape cover, usually a dense tangle of vegetation into which predators cannot easily follow.(1) In the case of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), on which cougars occasionally prey in New Mexico, Nevada and California, escape cover may not be “cover” in the normal sense, but a sheer rock face. The steep incline and exposure discourages a cougar from following and allows the sheep to escape.\n\nOther types of cover are required. Deer need cover for giving birth to fawns and for resting (protective cover and resting cover). They cope with seasonal temperature extremes by taking refuge in timber stands (thermal cover); tall trees with dense foliage reduce heat loss through radiation on cold, clear winter nights, provide shade on hot sunny days, and serve as shields from strong winds for deer and cougars alike.(4)\n\nBeing herbivores (plant-eaters), deer will gravitate to habitats that have adequate forage. Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), the most common species of deer in the western United States and Canada, require a mix of food types(5) and are known to eat 788 plant species.(6) In southern Utah, mule deer feed extensively on bitterbrush and Gambel oak, two plants that also provide excellent cover. Not surprisingly, areas dominated by these two plants are also frequented by mountain lions.(7)\n\nMaurice Hornocker(8) and later John Seidensticker and his coworkers studied cougars in the remote wilderness of the Idaho Primitive Area (now the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness). There, they found that cougars referred steep, rocks areas covered with dense stands of Douglas fir and ponderosa pine, with sagebrush and grasslands mixed among the bluffs and talus slopes. The big cats avoided crossing large open areas with insufficient cover, preferring to travel around the perimeters.\n\nResearchers Kenny Logan and Larry Irwin(10) studied cougars in the Bighorn Mountains of northern Wyoming; their work provided the first quantified evaluation of cougar habitat use, and their findings were similar to those of Seidensticker and Hornocker in Idaho. The cats frequented canyonland habitats with steep, rugged slopes (greater than 45 degrees) containing mixed conifer and brushy mountain mahogany cover. Grasslands and sagebrush areas with gentle slopes (less than 20 degrees) were generally avoided.\n\nThe late Steven Laing was a member of a team of researchers who studied cougars in the Boulder-Escalante region of south-central Utah. This 10-year study, completed in 1989, is considered to be the most thorough examination of the cats yet completed. Laing, being responsible for examining cougar habitat use, found that cougars selected pinyon-juniper woodlands with lava boulders scattered in the understory cover (ground vegetation). The cats also frequented ponderosa pine/oak brush, mixed aspen/spruce-fir, and spruce-fir habitats. They avoided sagebrush bottomlands, agricultural and pasture lands, slickrock sandstone canyons, and open meadows. These areas were typically at higher elevations with steeper slopes and denser understory cover. This combination of terrain and vegetation seems to enhance the cat’s ability to survey and move through the landscape unseen.(7)\n\nHarley Shaw observed a similar pattern in Arizona. Forested areas such as those found on the Mogollon Rim and Kaihab Plateau have little understory cover and hold relatively, low mountain lion densities, while chaparral and pinyon-juniper vegetations, which have dense understory cover, have higher densities of mountain lions. Shaw suspects understory cover for stalking is the key to habitat suitability.(11)\n\nCougars cannot successfully take prey if there is too much or too little cover.\n\nSeidensticker and his colleagues(9) described suitable cougar habitat as a combination of vegetation, topography, prey numbers, and prey vulnerability. Prey vulnerability refers to the ease a prey species may be captured and killed by cougars and depends on the availability of cover (both stalking cover and escape cover) and the behavior of the prey. The relationship between vegetation and prey vulnerability is particularly important: cougars cannot successfully take prey if there is too much or too little cover. The best vegetation for stalking cover is moderately dense-thick enough for the lion to remain hidden, sparse enough for the cat to see its prey.(12) Thus, the presence of moderately dense stalking cover in a habitat increases the vulnerability of the prey found there. This also explains why dense vegetation is attractive to deer as escape cover-it reduces their vulnerability to cougars.\n\nWriter Barry Lopez (a MLF Honorary Boardmember) calls the cougar “a dweller on the edge.” Edges, or ecotones, are transitional borders between different habitat types-the places where forest meets clearing, where rocky ledge meets bush, and where willow thicket meets streamside banks.(2,13) Such areas provide good forage and cover for deer, which in turn attracts cougars. Florida panthers make frequent use of ecotones in Everglades National Park;(14) much of the panthers’ habitat in that part of south Florida is slash pine woodland s with dense understory cover of saw palmetto. This woodland forms the eastern boundary of a flat, grassy wetland (the Everglades) dotted with islands of hardwood trees called hammocks. Panthers do most of their hunting and make most of their kills along the edges of these hammocks and in these woodlands. Laing found a similar pattern in the Boulder-Escalante study: “Riparian zones [streamside habitats] and rock ledges were the two ecotones most associated with highly used areas suggesting habitat selection based on prey densities, cover diversity, and possibly water availability.” (7)\n\nTo a cougar, vegetation shape and density seems to be more important than vegetation type in determining habitat suitability. This partially explains the cat’s ability to occupy such an extensive range and variety of habitats.(12)\n\nSo the best deer and cougar habitats appear to be forested areas that contain good deer forage and cover as well as a diversity of terrain and sufficient stalking cover. Cougars seem consciously to select cover and terrain that allow them find prey, observe it while stalking, and approach close enough to make a kill.(4) Seidensticker’s study in Idaho(9) showed that, over a span of years, kill sites were clustered in certain areas, which suggested that these areas offered advantages in taking prey.\n\nHOME RANGE\n\nWithin mountain lion habitat, adult cougars space themselves out and confine their movement to individual fixed areas known as home ranges. Home range should not be confused with geographic range, which is a broader term indicating the entire map area in which cougars occur.(1) Cougar home ranges include hunting areas, water sources, resting areas, lookout positions, and denning sites where kittens or cubs can be safely reared. Cougars that occupy home ranges are called residents, and possession of a home range enhances a resident’ lion’s chances of more consistently finding prey, locating mates, and successfully rearing young.(15)\n\nPossession of a home range is fundamental to the cougar’s survival as a solitary predator. By having a fixed area of land to hunt in, the cougar is better able to consistently locate prey. It roams its home range constantly, learning the terrain, where the best cover is, where the deer most likely can be found. This is why survival for a transient cougar is more precarious than that of a resident cougar. Transients are constantly moving through unfamiliar territory and have not yet perfected their hunting skills.\n\nCougars are not territorial in the sense that they defend their home ranges to exclude all other cougars. Rather, the big cats have evolved a land tenure system(9) in which home ranges are maintained by resident lions but not transient lions. Male home ranges are typically larger than female home ranges, usually overlapping or encompassing several of the female ranges, but only occasionally overlapping those of other resident males; however, female home ranges commonly overlap. Exceptions to this pattern do exist. Studies in the Diablo Mountains of California(16) and the San Andres Mountains of New Mexico(17) showed overlap between male home ranges, while those of females did not.\n\nIn areas where home ranges overlap, cougars seem to avoid each other.\n\nIn areas where home ranges overlap, cougars seem to avoid each other. This mutual avoidance is thought to be accomplished primarily through sight and smell.(2, 12) Smell is employed through the use of scrapes. In the “Cycle of Life” chapter it was explained how scrapes function as biological traffic signals within home ranges. By either making a scrape or sniffing the scrape of other individuals, cougars send and receive a variety of messages. Male residents can announce their presence, transient lions or females with dependent kittens can avoid male residents, and females can find males when they are ready to mate.(18) Two cougars in overlapping home ranges can both use the common area because scrapes allow them to use the area at different times.\n\nAfter sniffing a scrape impregnated with the urine of another cougar, a lion will display a lip-curling grimace known as a flehman. This action is thought to allow them to use a special olfactory organ in the roof of their mouth to evaluate, or get a better “look” at the scent. Biologists speculate that males may use the flehman to determine from a female’s urine whether she is ready to mate.(9,19,20) Both Seidensticker(9) and Lindzey(18) have observed this behavior in captive mountain lions.\n\nExperts speculate that land tenure and mutual avoidance allow cougars too maintain home ranges in a number of beneficial ways. First they seem to reduce conflict. A large, powerful carnivore like the cougar depends exclusively on its good health to capture prey. Frequent fighting could lead to serious injury and starvation. This is not to say fighting between cats never occurs; as has already been pointed out, in some cougar populations, such as in southern New Mexico, fighting is common and even a major source of mortality.(17) Secondly, maintaining a matrix of adjacent and overlapping home ranges seems to limit cougar population density,(8,21,22) which in turn increases the cats’ chances of finding prey. Finally, because home ranges are frequently hundreds of square miles in size, it would be impossible for a cougar to actively defend the entire area against all intruders.(15) As a result, a more flexible system of coexistence has evolved.\n\nResearchers have learned much of what they know about home ranges through radio telemetry. This involves capturing a wild cougar and attaching a collar containing a small radio transmitter. By plotting the cat’s locations on a topographic map, biologists can learn the size of the area a cougar uses throughout the year, what the density of cats in an area is, and the social structure of the population.(23) What they have learned is that home ranges vary widely in size, depending on local vegetation, prey density, and the time of the year. Male home range size can vary from 25 to 500 square miles, while females usually occupy smaller areas of from 8 to over 400 square miles. Sitton and Wallen documented some of the smallest home ranges in the Big Sur region of coastal California, where the average home ranges were 25 to 35 square miles for males and 18 to 25 square miles for females.(24) A warmer climate and abundant forage probably make it unnecessary for the deer to migrate between winter and summer range and the herds thus concentrate in specific areas. Consequently, the cougar population concentrates around the denser prey population. The presence of good stalking cover is likely a factor as well. Hemker and his colleagues found some of the largest home ranges during the Boulder-Escalante study in southern Utah, where males occupied areas of up to 513 square miles and females up to 426 square miles.(25)\n\nAs might be expected, male and female cougars use their home ranges differently.\n\nAs might be expected, male and female cougars use their home ranges differently. Besides a place to hunt, males require in area where they can mate with as many females as possible without interference from surrounding males. That is why male home ranges overlap two, three, or more female home ranges and why male home ranges usually do not overlap. Female home ranges are usually smaller and are used to provide sufficient prey and denning sites for rearing kittens, even in years of low prey density.(15)\n\nLife is tough for a female cougar-much tougher than for a male. Seidensticker explains why: “Adult females are subject to more stress and hazards than are males. The female must hunt and kill large, potentially dangerous prey more frequently than males and must do so at regular, predictable intervals if she is to succeed in rearing her kittens, thus increasing the likelihood of accidental death.”(9) On occasion, males have even been known to abandon their home range and move to a new area;(26) older males can also be displaced from their home ranges by prime males.(17) Females show much more attachment to their home ranges and tend to remain in the same area for their entire lives.\n\nThe amount of stalking cover and prey numbers in cougar habitat obviously influence home range size. Home range size and the degree of overlap in turn influence the density of a cougar population in a given area.(27) Density estimates of 3 to 7 adult cougars per 100 square miles have been made in southern Alberta(28) and 5 to 8 adult cougars per 100 square miles in the Diablo Mountains of California.(16) Both habitats are characterized by good stalking cover and abundant prey. Lion densities in dryer desert climates seem to be lower. Linda Sweanor and Kenny Logan estimate only 2 adult cougars per 100 square miles in their New Mexico study area, which lies in the Chihuahuan Desert.(29) Densities in southern Utah were even lower, at .5 to .8 adult cougars per 100 square miles, which was 30 percent lower than densities estimated elsewhere.(25) When stalking cover, prey, and water are scarce, cougars expend more energy searching for and stalking prey in larger home ranges. As a result, the cougar population is scattered more thinly across the region. (Fred Lindzey cautions that estimating densities of a solitary and highly mobile predator like the mountain lion is difficult, and that a variety of estimation methods are used by biologists, so one must he careful in making comparisons.(12))\n\nAs a result of the functions of land tenure and mutual avoidance, cougars appear to “saturate” an area at a given density. Research indicates that the density of cougars in a particular area is socially regulated through home range size and overlap and does not increase above a level socially tolerable for cougars. In other words, healthy cougar populations appear to be self-regulating. Harley Shaw explains: “In all studies of lions where relatively good documentation of lion numbers has been made, lion densities have peaked and stabilized at points between ten and twenty square miles per adult resident. Evidence indicates that, if left alone, adult resident lions will probably not populate beyond such densities.”(22)\n\nPOPULATION DYNAMICS\n\nWildlife biologists have long puzzled over the cougar’s solitary life style and how it benefits the animal as a predator. “I find it curious that an animal starting in a litter becomes antisocial in adulthood,” writes Harley Shaw. “The earliest moments of a lion’s life involve touching its siblings. Its growth involves play, interaction, and cooperation during early efforts in hunting. Yet the animal ultimately comes to avoid other adults except at breeding time.”(22)\n\nThe cooperative hunting methods of wolves have been extensively studied and their success is well known, as is their gregarious life style. One cannot help but wonder if in comparison the cougar’s solitary life style, especially hunting, puts the cat at a distinct disadvantage. Seidensticker and his fellow researchers don’t think so: “The mountain lion, too, kills large potentially dangerous prey, but unlike the wolf, a pursuit predator, the lion is a stalking predator whose success depends solely on the element of surprise. In the broken land where lions find sufficient cover to stalk and launch successful attacks, the prey usually are scattered and time-consuming to find. Under such conditions, a solitary social structure is apparently the most effective life style.”(9)\n\nWhile hunting alone may have its advantages, cougars may not be as solitary as once thought. Rick Hopkins points out that adult males are not solitary by choice and probably spend most of their time searching for receptive females.(27) Susan de Treville once monitored four radio collared adult resident males to within 50 yards of each other in the Big Sur region of California.(30) Andrew Kitchener writes: “…far from having a chaotic, random system of home ranges driven by the need for [solitary] cats to avoid each other at all costs, most wild cats maintain a predictable system of land tenure, which promotes social stability and maximizes the reproductive success of both males and females… far from being strangers, neighboring cats probably know each other very well from their own distinctive smells.”(15)\n\nSolitary or not, cougars that inhabit a common geographic area are referred to as a population,(1) and within a population not all cougars are created equal. This feline social hierarchy consists of three classes of animals: resident adult males and females, transient males and females, and dependent offspring of resident females. Resident adults maintain established home ranges and do most of the breeding in a population. Transients constantly move through the home ranges of residents in search of a vacant home range of their own; while female transients tend to delay breeding until they find and occupy a home range, this may not be true of males. Dependent offspring include kittens and juveniles that still rely on their mother to hunt for them.(23)\n\nDetermining whether a cougar is an adult, transient, or kitten is more complex than it sounds; finding a reliable way to determine age is something which has long eluded biologists. Age is usually established using a combination of tooth wear, body weight, color spotting, and behavior. Kittens are newborn to 16 months old and are still with their mother in her home range; they may still have spots which fade by the third of fourth month. Transients are 17 to 23 months old and have left their mother’s home range but have not yet settled in a home range of their own; spotting may still be present on the insides of the front legs. Resident adults are mature cats, at least 24 months old, and occupy an established home range; spotting is absent or very faint, and females may show evidence of nursing.(26)\n\nHarley Shaw uses a slightly different system of classifying lions. Resident lions are adult males and females that use established home ranges and are reproductively active. Immature lions are defined as offspring of resident adults that are still traveling with, or close to, the mother. Transient lions are young, newly independent adults searching for a home range.(31)\n\nResearchers Kenny Logan and Linda Sweanor prefer the terms emigrant and disperser to transient. These refer to lions that have emigrated or dispersed from their birth area but have not set up a home range. This dispersal out of a previously occupied area is called emigration, while movement into a new area is called immigration.(1) Emigrants become immigrants when they enter a new population.(17) (While it is good science for researchers to refine their techniques and terms, the lack of consistency also makes it difficult for scientists to compare information. It also frustrates writers attempting to explain mountain lions.)\n\nBecause no reliable method yet exists for accurately aging cougars, determining how many resident adults, transients, and kittens are present in a cougar population at any given time is equally difficult. This is further complicated by the fact that young transient cats are constantly on the move.(12) These factors, if not accounted for, can distort population estimates made by wildlife biologists.\n\nResident females generally outnumber resident males in a population.(25,32,33) This may be because females require smaller home ranges that frequently overlap those of other female cougars. Females also seem generally more tolerant of adjacent females and, as a result, more females might concentrate in a smaller area. Resident males, on the other hand, require larger home ranges that rarely overlap, and they tend to be intolerant of other males and are more widely scattered than resident females.\n\nYoung transient cougars usually leave their mother’s home range (disperse) sometime during their second year. The newly independent cats occasionally linger in the birth area, while others leave immediately. They may wander for more than a before establishing their own home range.(22) If sufficient space is available, however some females will remain in their birth areas; one young female in Nevada stayed in the mountain range of her birth, bred at 24 months, and established a home range adjacent to her mother’s. Female transients have even been known to take over their mother’s home range after her death.(18)\n\nMales tend to wander farther than females,(26) although how far either gender travels seems to vary. Transient males in the Diablo Mountains of California traveled up to 35 miles from their areas of birth.(16) In one Nevada population, males covered an average of 31 miles, while females averaged 18 miles.(26) One young cougar marked in the Bighorn Mountains of Wyoming appeared in northern Colorado, 300 miles from the original location.(34)\n\nTransient males and females seldom remain in one location longer than six months.\n\nTransient males and females seldom remain in one location longer than six months. How the cats “test” a population for vacant home ranges is poorly understood. It is generally thought that a transient either finds a vacant home range or displaces an older resident. If a vacant home range is found, the young male or female will settle down to the business of establishing its place in the population. If the population density is so high that no vacant home areas exist, the transient moves on.\n\nKenny Logan believes male transients enter a new population and for a period of time, make kills, avoid other lions, and avoid scrapings. If they think they can establish a home range they begin to scrape. Meanwhile, the resident male, closely monitoring its home range, is busy investigating the newcomer’s scrapes and kills. If the resident and newcomer encounter each other they may fight. As a result, the resident may kill the newcomer, the newcomer may kill the resident, or the newcomer may drive off or displace the resident.(17)\n\nThe role of transients in populations is important because they are the primary source of replacements for resident cougars who die as a result of hunting, old age, or accidents. Transients also ensure genetic mixing between populations,(12) and appear to be a major factor in the recovery of hunted populations. Cougar populations in isolated mountain ranges, such as those common to the Great Basin, are particularly vulnerable because immigration of transients is low.(35)\n\nFor example, aggressive predator control efforts wiped out all cougars in and around Yellowstone National Park by the 1920s, and – except for a few transients passing through – no cougars lived there for almost 50 years. But transients seem to be slowly recolonizing the 2.2 million-acre park; research biologist Kerry Murphy directs a field study of cougars in the region and estimates 14 to 17 resident mountain lions are now present. Radio collars have been attached to 9 females and 7 males, and the population produced 21 kittens in 1991. The region has abundant deer and elk, and the cougar population is increasing.(36)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the availability of good hunting sites and prey numbers limit the number of cougars in an area. But birth, death, emigration, and immigration are all factors that greatly influence cougar population maintenance and growth. In absence of hunting by humans, the cougar population will remain relatively constant.(12) Rick Hopkins found that the unhunted cougar population in the Diablo Mountains of California was relatively stable with a low turnover of residents.(16)\n\nCOUGARS ON THE MOVE\n\nThere is nothing more distinctive about cats than the way they move, and mountain lions are no different. The big cats are the epitome of graceful, lithe motion. Stealthy shadows that do not move so much as flow across the landscape.\n\nThere is nothing more distinctive about cats than the way they move.\n\nConsider the effect of broken terrain on prey, explains Kenny Logan. “Mountain lions are ballerinas at getting across broken terrain-steep slopes, boulders, outcroppings, and undercut ledges.” Mule deer and elk are not as good at negotiating such rugged landscapes.(17) Here the cougar uses both cover and superior agility to its advantage, and employs yet another weapon in its predatory arsenal-it hunts under the cover of darkness.\n\nCougars are not strictly nocturnal, as many once thought.\n\nCougars are not strictly nocturnal, as many once thought. Rather, they tend to be active at the same time as their prey, and deer tend to be active at dawn, dusk, and at night. Animals that are active during the twilight of dawn and dusk are said to be crepuscular. The big cat’s excellent night vision makes it well suited for stalking during these low light periods. Florida panthers appear to be more active at sunrise and sunset,(37) and Paul Beier reports that in southern California mountain lions are active throughout the night.(39) During the winter in Idaho, radio-collared cougars were found to be more active at night (40 percent of the time they were located) than during daylight hours (14 percent of the time they were located). Daytime activity increased during the summer with an increased abundance of ground squirrels.(9) Bruce Ackerman studied cougar activity patterns in southern Utah and found the cats most active at sunrise and sunset, but less so during the winter. He also found that single adults were more active than females with young, but that the females became more active as their kittens grew.(3)\n\nMost mule deer herds in mountainous areas of western North America migrate to lower elevations in the winter to avoid heavy snow and then come back to higher elevations in the summer. Predictably, cougars also shift their home range use to follow these seasonal movements.(25) This elevational movement of cats following deer herds has been observed in Arizona, Idaho, California, and Nevada; in Idaho, cougars’ winter home ranges were smaller than summer home ranges.(9,25) Biologist Dave Ashman and his coworkers documented a case in Nevada where a male cougar occupied one mountain range in winter, then crossed 10 miles of flat, open desert to take up summer residence in another mountain range. Elsewhere in the state, cougars followed deer herds to lower elevations or traditional wintering grounds. During the cold Nevada winters, cougars avoided the north-facing slopes and frequented the south-facing slopes where there was less snow and more deer. When summer arrived, the cat shifted to the cooler north-facing slope, where there was more vegetation. Cougars also tended to restrict their movements to between 6,500 and 8,500 feet, where vegetation, deer, and other prey were most plentiful.(26)\n\nPaul Beier has monitored some lions continuously for 24-hour periods to better understand their movements. He found that the lions in his California study area travel at a steady speed of approximately one-half mile per hour. Though there is a lot of variation, the cats seem to follow a cycle of traveling for a little less than an hour, followed by 30 minutes of rest.(38)\n\nMountain lions can cover a lot of ground in their nightly wanderings; a lion in the San Andres Mountains of New Mexico has been documented at 10 miles in a night.(17) Not surprisingly, Hemker and his coworkers found in their Utah study area that females with kittens less than six months old moved significantly shorter distances than females with older kittens, females without kittens, transients, or resident males. One resident male traveled eight miles in a one-day period, but this represents only the straight-line distance between locations on a map and does not reflect the actual distance covered.(25) Here is why.\n\nCougars have two basic patterns of movement: hunting and traveling. When the big cat is looking for prey, it traverses a zigzag course through it home range. An entire day searching for prey likely brings the cougar only a few linear miles from its starting point. The cat is basically searching and has no specific destination in mind. A traveling cat, with a specific destination in mind is a different matter. The route will be more direct, though it will still take advantage of the landscape, following ridges, major drainages, or using low passes.(22)\n\nA common myth about the daily movements of cougars is that they follow a regular and predictable circuit around their home range. This assumption may stem partly from observations of domestic cats or vague attempt apply human behavior to cougars. A variety of studies that monitored cougar movements with radio telemetry found no such patterns. Cougars move freely and arbitrarily about their home ranges and have never been seen to pass a fixed location at set intervals.(22) As a stalking predator that depends on the element of surprise to capture its prey, regularity of movement would handicap the cougar’s ability to survive.\n\nCougar The American Lion Line Illustrations\n\nCopyright (1992-2009) by Linnea Fronce\n\nCHAPTER NOTES\n\nDassman, R.F. 1981.

(Personal communication)\n\nANATOMY OF A HUNTER\n\nThirty-five million years of evolution have honed Felis concolor into an almost perfect predator. The cougar’s keen senses, muscular body, and remarkable adaptability make it ideally suited for a predatory existence. Because they are the most exclusive of meat-eaters, almost every feature of a cat’s body is related to the way it detects and catches its prey. (1)\n\nDETECTING PREY\n\nThe big cats use all of their senses in their ongoing search for prey. When the Florida panther stepped in front of my truck that night in the Everglades, and the eerie glint of its eyes flashed back at me, I was witness to a universal feature of feline legend. But the eyes of a cat are not windows to the fires of Hell, as witch hunters in the Middle Ages believed; (2) they are actually the marvelous adaptation of a nocturnal hunter\n\nCats have extraordinary vision.\n\nCats have extraordinary vision. The eyeball, pupil, and lens are proportionately larger than other carnivores. The eyes of a domestic cat are only slightly smaller than those of humans, but the cat can open its pupil to a maximum area three times larger than humans can;(3) this increases light-gathering ability and enhances night vision. Cougars are both nocturnal and crepuscular (active during the twilight hours of dawn and dusk). As a result, their eyes are proportionately smaller than the mostly nocturnal lynx, making pumas suited to hunting both in daylight and at night. (4, 5) The amount of light entering the eyeball is controlled by the pupil, and the pupil in smaller cats is elliptical.\n\nThis allows it to open as wide as possible at night, but close almost completely in bright light, protecting light sensitive cells. Cougars and other big cats have round or oval pupils, reflecting a somewhat lesser dependency on nocturnal hunting. (1, 3)\n\nAfter passing through the pupil and lens, light strikes a layer of light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye called the retina. There are two kinds of light receptor cells in the retinas of mammals: rods and cones. Rods function in low levels of light and do not detect color, while cones are sensitive to high levels of light and are used in color vision. Not surprisingly, the eyes of cats consist primarily of rods, though there is a concentration of cones near the center of the retina as in our own eyes. There is evidence that cats can only discern the color of relatively close or large objects, but much remains to be learned about color vision in cats. (3) Behind the retina is a thin layer of reflective cells called a tapetum lucidum , meaning “bright carpet.” The tapetum reflects light back through the rods and further enhances interpretation of low-light images, giving the cougar a second chance to discern what it is looking at. The tapetum is responsible for the characteristic “eye-shine” of reflected light that is frequently seen in mammals at night. (1, 2, 6) It was the Florida panther’s tapetum I saw that night in the Everglades.\n\nAnother characteristic of feline vision is that the eyes are close together and facing forward. This allows the field of vision of the two eyes to overlap, resulting in binocular vision. Binocular vision provides excellent depth perception and the ability to precisely judge distance; cats have the most highly developed binocular vision of all carnivores. (1) The cat’s total visual field spans 287 degrees, with a binocular overlap of 130 degrees. Humans, by contrast, have a binocular overlap of 120 degrees in a total visual field of 200 degrees. The cougar’s depth perception is most sensitive within a range of 50 to 80 feet, a critical adaptation for a predator that stalks its prey and attacks from a short distance. (6)\n\nWhile a cougar’s extraordinary vision seems to give it a distinct advantage over its prey, nature has a way of compensating for advantages. In humans, the high concentration of cones in our eyes allows us to resolve (discern) visual detail in daylight, while the low concentration of rods inhibits our ability to resolve detail in low light. This resolving power is called visual acuity. While the concentration of rods and the presence of a tapetum has increased the cat’s sensitivity to low light, it has sacrificed visual acuity. Rods do not allow for much discrimination between light wavelengths, and the tapetum further blurs the image the cat sees. As a result, cats’ vision at night is six times better than that of humans, but humans have better visual acuity. (1, 2, 3)\n\nFurther, in prey species such as deer, the eyes are mounted on the side of their head. This arrangement does not allow binocular vision but does increase the total field of view and the ability to detect predators. (7) Cats also have a heightened sensitivity to movement, and biologists believe that it is the movement of prey that triggers the puma to attack. This may explain why prey typically will “freeze” after detecting a predator. (6) In the world of predator and prey, there seems to be a defense for every offense.\n\nAlthough little research has been done on hearing in cougars, it is known that domestic cats can detect their prey by sound as well as sight. They can hear frequencies in the ultrasonic range and are able to move their small, rounded ears together or independently to isolate these sounds. It is also believed that an enlarged auditory bullae (the portion of the skull surrounding the middle ear) may enhance a cat’s sensitivity to certain sounds. (1, 3, 8)\n\nExperts speculate that in most cats, vision and hearing are important for hunting, while smell plays a more active role in social behavior) In Chapter Three: Cougars at Home it was explained that pumas have a special olfactory organ in the roof of their mouth that is employed during a flehman response, presumably to determine the reproductive condition of a female. (11) Cougars also seem to share their domestic cousin’s attraction to catnip. (8, 12) Smell, a well-developed feline sense, is not primarily used in hunting. However, “We probably underestimate how much cougars use their sense of smell,” says Fred Lindzey, “I once saw a captive male picking up the scent of a deer.” Lindzey thinks cougars probably do not use their sense of smell in hunting, but can generally use it to determine whether deer are in the area. (9) Bogue and Ferrari observed a six-month-old puma kitten follow a scent trail they laid down through undergrowth with a piece of hide from a freshly killed deer. (10) Nonetheless, dogs’ sense of smell is much more highly developed. The longer muzzle of a dog boasts almost 50 square inches of olfactory cells to the cat’s 6 square inches, and 5 percent of canine brain volume is committed to its sense of smell, compared to 3 percent in cats. (1)\n\nCats have an acute sense of touch, particularly with the tip of their nose, toes, and paws. (8) A cat’s whiskers are specially adapted as tactile sensors; during prey capture they are extended like a net in front of the mouth so the cat can determine exactly where the prey is to accurately inflict the killing bite. (13) Barry Lopez tells of one biologist who believes that a cougar’s paws are so sensitive that when it attacks deer in pitch black it can determine the location of the head by instantly sensing the direction its hair is growing. (14) A mountain lion is the personification of power, grace, strength, speed, and agility.\n\nCAPTURING PREY\n\nA mountain lion is the personification of power, grace, strength, speed, and agility, largely due to heavy musculature attached to a light but strong skeleton. The majority of a cougar’s body weight is muscle and sinew, with only a relatively small portion made up of bone and organs. Long, muscular legs and a flexible backbone allow strong extended strides, while its long, heavy tail provides balance on quick turns and uneven ground. (15) Horizontal leaps of 45 feet have been recorded, along with vertical leaps of 15 feet . This ability may be partly due to the fact that the cat’s rear legs are longer than its front legs. An adaption for jumping is a valuable characteristic both for attacking prey and moving through the rugged terrain most cougars inhabit. (8) Further, the anatomy of a cougar’s front limbs allows the animal to pivot sharply without losing lateral traction,(14) an important feature when grasping large prey at high speed.\n\nThe big cat is built for speed, not endurance. Writer Jim Bob Tinsley relates that, “It [the cougar] can easily outrun a pack of dogs for a few hundred yards, but its small lungs limit the distance it can cover at full stride. When out of breath, it must seek the temporary shelter of a tree or some other natural protection.”(16) Ralph Schmidt, who works with Alberta lion researchers Martin Jalkotsy and Ian Ross, believes cougars are the fastest predator in North America. “I’ve seen cougars jump out of trees and run up a slope at an unbelievable rate of speed,” says Schmidt, with a pronounced tone of respect. (17) Apparently no cougar has ever submitted to the stopwatch, but it is telling to consider that in some parts of the western United States, cougars have been known to occasionally kill pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), the fastest land animal in North America. (16, 18)\n\nCats and many other carnivores walk upright on their toes, a stance known as digitigrade, as opposed to the plantigrade stance found in humans and bears) Webbed skin and fur between the toes muffle sound as the cat walks, and while stalking or walking on snow or a muddy surface, the hindfeet can be placed almost exactly in the track of the forefeet. (20) Cougar tracks reveal four toe pads in front of a smooth, calloused, three-lobed heel pad. Adult tracks average 3 1/2 inches in width and length,(19) with the forepaws usually larger than the hindpaws. During normal walking the claws are retracted, but during quick acceleration they are extended and used for traction. (8)\n\nSharp claws are important for seizing and controlling prey so the cougar can deliver the killing neck bite. To keep their claws sharp, cougars have spring-like ligaments that keep the claws retracted inside fleshy sheaths and elevated above the ground most of the time. Retraction of the claws is passive, requiring no effort on the part of the cat. In use, the muscles in the forelegs contract, which in turn protract the claws, and the cougar is ready for action. As Kiltie has noted, it probably makes more sense to call them “protractile” claws. (3)\n\nThe skull is short and round, with 16 teeth in the upper jaw and 14 in the lower jaw. (6) Cougars have a powerful bite because of the reduced length of their jaws and their large jaw-closing muscles, the temporalis and masseter. Atop its skull, the cat has a bony ridge called the sagittal crest, which provides a large surface area for the attachment of the temporalis, the larger and stronger of the two muscles, and the one that lifts the jaw up and back.\n\nThe other end of the temporalis attaches to the lower jaw. At a wide gape, such an arrangement gives the temporalis a greater mechanical advantage in driving the large canine teeth through the prey’s muscle and bone. The masseter originates on the zygomatic arch, a bony arch on the side of the skull, attaches to the outside of the jaw, and lifts the jaw up and back. The masseter is more important as the jaws close at the end of the bite and when the cat uses its carnassials during feeding. Carnassials are modified molars and premolars that act as shears to cut through tough hide and tissue, which is why cats turn their heads to the side when they are biting through tissue while feeding. Cats do not chew their food, but rather use their carnassials to cut their prey up into small pieces or strips, which are swallowed whole. (13) Even the puma’s tongue is specially adapted, with sharp, horny protuberances that help remove meat from bone and also aids in grooming. (21)\n\nThe cougar seems to tolerate the bitter cold of the Canadian north or the blistering heat of the Amazon equally well. Its remarkable physique is covered with a tawny coat that is short year-round in warmer climates but grows longer and thicker during the winter in temperate regions. (22) In temperate climates, shedding occurs in the spring. (18)\n\nThough the cougar’s scream is a subject of some debate, the cats are capable of a surprising variety of vocalizations. While they are quite vocal during mating, it is unlikely that cougars roam about in the wild “screaming,” as depicted in films. To do so contradicts the cougar’s secretive behavior and would also be counterproductive, as it would scare away essential prey. Their repertoire includes hisses, growls, .and whistles. (23) It appears whistles may be used as a means of communication between juvenile cougars and between females and kittens;(24) additionally, captive cougars have been observed greeting familiar humans with distinct whistles. (10)\n\nDIET\n\nBecause cougars are one of the most widely ranging cats, their diet varies depending on the prey available; almost completely carnivorous, they rarely eat vegetation. (25) As noted, deer are at the top of the menu – mule deer in western North America and white-tailed deer in eastern North America. (6) Exactly how much of the lion’s diet deer comprise varies with each state and province. (25) Mule deer are the primary prey in Oregon, Alberta, and Utah, while in Florida, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and wild hogs (Sus scrofa) are at the top of the menu. (26) Other large prey are taken as well. Hornocker found that cougars in the Idaho Primitive Area fed primarily on mule deer and elk (Cervus canadensis). (27) In Nevada, the ever-adaptable lion occasionally augments its diet with wild horses and desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis ). (28) Even moose (Alces alces) have been known to fall to the powerful cat in Alberta(29) and British Columbia. (30)\n\nOpportunistic predators, cougars also feed on a variety of smaller prey, especially in times of seasonal abundance. Columbia ground squirrels are frequently the cat’s main course during the warmer summer months in Idaho,(31) while during years of peak snowshoe hare abundance in British Columbia, over a quarter of the cougar’s diet was composed of hares. (30) In the southwestern United States, peccaries (Tayassu tajacu) are taken. (6) Additional prey includes rabbits, marmots, beaver, porcupine, an assortment of birds, domestic livestock, and even carrion, as well as other carnivores, such as bobcats, coyotes, and other cougars. (18, 32)\n\nThe puma’s dependence on smaller prey is more pronounced in South America. In Chile’s Torres del Paine National Park, pumas subsist primarily on European hares (Lepus europaeus), followed by guanacos (Lama guanicoe) and domestic sheep (Yanez et al. 1986). Biologist Louise Emmons found that pumas in the jungles of Peru preyed on small rodents, oppossums, bats, and lizards. The majority of their prey were agoutis and pacas, rodents weighing 2 to 22 pounds. (34) The big cats are able to kill and eat most animals in their home range.\n\nWhen the abundance of their primary prey declines, cougars have been known to switch their diet. This occurred in Big Bend National Park in western Texas, where cougars and male bobcats usually feed on deer. When the mule deer population crashed in 1980-1981, both cats were forced to switch to peccaries and lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), the next largest prey. (35)\n\nThe diet of a cougar also varies according to its sex and age. Solitary cats seem to consume more small prey than do females with young, while transients likely focus their efforts on smaller prey until they develop the skills to hunt and kill larger prey. Females must feed young for up to 18 months, so killing large animals is a more efficient way to procure a lot of fresh meat quickly. Bruce Ackerman and his colleagues concluded that, considering the food requirements of females with young, breeding populations of cougars could not exist in areas devoid of large prey like deer. (36) How often a cougar kills a deer depends on a variety of factors:\n\n• Sex and reproductive status\n\n• Size of the dependent young\n\n• Social status\n\n• Abundance of alternate prey\n\n• Rate of spoilage of kill\n\n• Time of year\n\nEstimated frequencies of kill vary from 1 deer per 10 to 14 days(27) to 1 deer per 2 to 3 days. (36) As stated previously, females with dependent kittens require greater quantities of meat, quantities that increase as the kittens grow. Ackerman estimated the following kill rates for a resident female in southern Utah:\n\n• Solitary resident female – 1 deer per 16 days\n\n• Resident female with 3-month-old kittens – 1 deer per 9 days\n\n• Resident female with three 15-month-old kittens – 1 deer per 3 days\n\nHaving evolved as an opportunistic predator, that may go without eating for days at a time, cougars exhibit fast-and-gorge feeding behavior. Captive cougars will eat 5 to 12 pounds of meat per day, more after deprivation, which is typical of this behavior. (25) Sensitive to spoilage, cougars seem to prefer their meat fresh, though they have been known to eat carrion when near starvation. In the warm temperatures of Arizona, spoilage of the carcass will typically restrict a cougar’s use of a kill to no more than four days. (38) Kills can be fed on for longer periods in more temperate regions. This is a decided advantage during cold winters when metabolic demands are high. One researcher in Idaho observed a cougar remain with an elk carcass for 19 days during one particularly cold winter. (31)\n\nA cougar goes about its feeding with almost surgical precision.\n\nAfter killing a deer, a cougar goes about its feeding with almost surgical precision. The cat plucks the fur from the point of incision using its teeth, then, using its claws, the flank is opened behind the ribs. The stomach and intestines are pulled out and dragged away from the carcass; heart, lungs, and liver are removed and eaten first. (6, 38) These organs contain higher concentrations of protein, fat, and vitamins than does muscle tissue. The liver in particular contains a high proportion of vitamins, amino acids, and glycogen, the primary source of metabolic energy. The fact these organs are consumed first is an important characteristic of the cougar’s fast-and-gorge feeding behavior. It may be a survival adaptation in case continued feeding is not possible;(39) a young transient cougar risks losing its kill to a resident lion, so the transient may gorge then leave the vicinity of the kill. (40) When continued feedings are possible, they include the rear quarters, then muscle tissue on the inside of the legs. If it’s been a long time since the last meal, the lion will feed heavily, consuming up to ten pounds of meat. (38) Generally left uneaten are the head, large bones, hide, and digestive tract. A solitary cougar can consume 75 percent of a carcass by weight, (39) while a female with kittens will perform an even more thorough job of consumption. (38)\n\nBecause they feed on more easily digestible meat than all other carnivores, cats have relatively short digestive tracts.\n\nBoth the small and large intestine are shorter and less efficient than in the more omnivorous dog. It is known, for example, that domestic cats have a mean digestive efficiency for total energy of 79 percent, compared with 89 percent for the domestic dog. (1) While the physiology of cougar digestion is poorly understood, the cat seems to survive on a diet rich in protein and fat. Veterinarian Melody Roelke reports that Florida panthers generally pass all food matter within 36 hours. (41) Houston has suggested that since the hunting behavior of cats requires quick acceleration, they minimize body weight and inertia by having a short, light gut. (42) Unlike dogs, cats appear to be unable to tolerate low levels of nitrogen (from protein) in their diets. (3)\n\nLittle is known about the water requirements of pumas. Stanley Young observed that “When water is scarce the puma apparently is capable of existing for long periods without it. This seems particularly evident in some of the dry semi-desert areas of southwestern Utah.”(12) Kitchener believes that although cats have access to free water, part of their liquid requirement probably comes from their prey. (1) Kenney Logan agrees. “There is no doubt cougars drink free water. They visit springs and guzzlers (man-made water catchments). They probably get a lot of water from drinking the blood of prey. We find very little blood spillage in the kills on our study area.” Logan believes blood provides the cougar with nutrients, vitamins, and water. (43)\n\nPREDATORY BEHAVIOR\n\nCougars are ambush predators. (44) Like most cats, with the notable exception of the cheetah, they attempt to catch their prey unaware, rather than chase it down. Unlike a bear, which kills its prey through brute force, the cougar is the epitome of speed and precision. The cat is silent on approach, quick on the attack, and efficient in making the kill. (15, 38) Few people have ever seen a mountain lion make a kill in the wild and a great deal of myth surrounds how it is done. (38) Stories of cougars killing 800-pound steers and scaling 10-foot fences with the unfortunate bovine still clutched in its jaws originated in frontier imaginations rather than any documented incident. Paul Leyhausen has done extensive research on predatory behavior in domestic and wild cats, including pumas. (13) It is now believed that prey-capture behavior is very similar in all species of wild cats. (1) In cougars, the process begins with the hunt.\n\nThe cougar is a relentless hunter. The search for prey is driven by the cat’s hunger and, in the case of a female, the need to feed growing kittens. The hungrier the cat, the greater the tendency to roam, with effort focused on areas where prey was previously found. (13) The cougar navigates its home range in a zigzag course, skirting open areas and taking advantage of available cover. (31, 38) The cat’s keen senses are focused to pick up the slightest movement, odor, or sound. How frequently the cat encounters prey depends on the number of prey in its home range, the density of cover, and the cougar’s searching behavior. (6) Once prey is detected, stalking begins.\n\nThe cougar fixes its gaze on the animal, lowers itself to the ground in a crouch, and begins to maneuver closer to the animal, taking care to remain hidden. It assumes an alert watching posture: head is stretched forward, the whiskers spread wide, and ears erect and turned toward the front. The cat will hold this position for minutes on end following the prey’s slightest movement with its head. (13) When the prey draws within 50 feet or less, Felis concolor strikes. (38)\n\nFlattened against the ground, the cat darts forward, either running or with several bounds, and quickly closes the distance to its prey. (13) The angle of attack is usually from the rear or side. (1) Once at its prey’s side it grasps the neck and shoulders with the front paws, claws extended. It will frequently strike its prey with such force during the final charge that in the case of a large animal such as deer or elk, the prey will be knocked off their feet. Although cats will attack from elevated positions such as a tree or boulder, they almost never land directly on their prey. To do so would provide a very unstable landing area and a poor platform from which to counter the unpredictable movements of its prey. When attacking large prey, it is important for the puma to keep its weight on its hind legs so that it can adjust its position to maintain control, or if necessary, to make a prudent retreat to avoid injury. (13) (It has already been noted that cougars are occasionally injured and even killed during such attacks.) Instead the cat lands on the ground short of the prey and attacks from there. (13)\n\nThe prey is normally killed with a bite to the back of the neck at the base of the skull. The large canines are inserted between the vertebrae like a wedge, forcing the vertebrae apart and breaking the spinal cord. (13) The speed with which this takes place indicates that the concentration of nerves in its canines allows the cat to “feel” its way to the vertebrae in a fraction of a second. (5) In the case of larger prey such as elk, the neck may be broken by pulling the head down and back, breaking it directly or in a fall. (45) If this fails the cougar may grasp the throat, crushing the windpipe. This necessitates death through asphyxiation and takes longer, exposing the cougar to possible injury. (6, 38) The efficiency of the kill will vary, depending on prey size, cougar size, angle of attack, and other circumstances. Hornocker found that cougars were successful 82 percent of the time in attacks on mule deer and elk in the Idaho Primitive Area. (27)\n\nFollowing a successful kill, cats rarely feed immediately. (13) This characteristic is probably a response to the level of hunger, energy expended during the attack, and the excitement of the attack. At some point, though, the cougar will drag or carry the carcass to a protected spot, such as under a tree, and begin to feed. (38) The cougar’s instinct to hide its kill is strong. After eating its fill, the cougar will hide the carcass by covering it with pine needles, limbs, and small twigs. Hiding the carcass protects it from scavengers, such as coyotes and ravens, and keeps the meat cool and fresh. Using its claws as rakes, the cat will stand over the kill and drag the debris inward with its front feet. Even soil and small rocks are used when nothing else is available. Shaw once found a deer killed on a large granite boulder in Arizona by a radio-collared lion. The female cougar had placed a single twig on the carcass before leaving. (38)\n\nThe cougar will typically remain in the vicinity of its kill for up to five days, making frequent trips back to feed and protect the carcass from other carnivores and scavengers. It’s not uncommon for a lion to move the carcass after each feeding. Fred Lindzey reports that lions will sometimes move a carcass over 100 yards each time, then feed on it. (9) How long the cat remains with the kill and the degree to which it is consumed depends on the size and weight of the cougar, the size of the prey, and weather conditions. (38) It has already been noted that a female with kittens will consume the carcass more completely than a solitary cat. (39) What causes abandonment of a kill is unknown. Some are fed on only once, leaving much of the meat uneaten, others are devoured completely, including the bone marrow. Spoilage and disturbance of the carcass are the most likely causes. Whatever the reason, the cat will leave the immediate area and eventually begin the search for its next prey.\n\nIn nature, predation is the rule, not the exception.\n\nEFFECTS OF COUGAR PREDATION ON PREY\n\nIn nature, predation is the rule, not the exception. All animals compete for the resources their environment provides and there are few animals that are not subject to some kind of predation. (46) Prey populations are influenced by many factors, some of the more important being the availability of food, denning sites, disease, migration, emigration, and predators. (1) The specific impact predators have on prey populations is one of the least understood and most controversial areas of study in wildlife science. Because an in-depth discussion of predator/prey relations is beyond the scope of this book, the following section gives only a brief overview of the relationship between cougars and their prey\n\nTraditional thinking was that predators slaughtered everything in sight and were capable of decimating entire prey populations. It was believed that by eradicating the predators, the prey populations would rise, leaving more game for the human hunter. As a result, the Scottish wildcat was almost eradicated by the early 20th century, large predators in African game parks were “controlled” until recently, (1) and attempts were made to exterminate the mountain lion. The puma’s occasional habit of killing live-stock didn’t help the situation. (6)\n\nThe next evolution in predatory/prey theory suggested that predators weed out old or sick individuals, thereby improving the health of the prey population. (1) This is sometimes referred to as sanitation. While the sanitation theory has elements of truth, it is frequently a distorted and over-simplified interpretation of Darwin’s theory of natural selection. (38) Cougars are known to prey on both healthy and sick animals,(27) and whether the cat selects for unhealthy prey is generally considered unproven. Both healthy and weak are vulnerable because of the cat’s ambush-hunting method. (25) Shaw has pointed out that some aspects of the lion’s behavior suggest that they may actually tend to select for younger and more active animals – that lions are somehow triggered to attack active prey. (38) Current thinking is that cougars select prey more at random; as opportunistic hunters they will kill what they can, sick or healthy, as the opportunity arises. While circumstance and opportunity seem to be more important than conscious selection on the part of the cat, studies indicate certain segments of the prey population appear to be more vulnerable than others.\n\nMountain lions were found to kill a greater proportion of mule deer fawns and mature bucks during studies in Colorado (47) and Nevada. (48) Hornocker observed the same pattern in lion-killed elk in Idaho. (27) The Boulder-Escalante cougar study in southern Utah revealed that adult males (all seasons), fawns (in Winter), and older deer (7+ years) were most vulnerable to cougar predation. (37) Cougars in the Diablo Mountains of California appear to take more of a cross section of the deer population. The cats showed a preference for bucks over fawns, and did not appear to select for old and infirm. (44)\n\nBucks may be more vulnerable because they are more distracted during the mating season. They are in poor physical condition during the winter and have a tendency to winter at higher elevations and in broken terrain, the preferred habitat of the cougar. Unlike the more solitary bucks, females winter in loose groups, which increases their ability to detect predators. Should the group be attacked, the confusion of many fleeing animals reduces the cat’s chance of success. The very young and very old are less vigorous and thus more vulnerable as a result. (6, 25) Other factors have been noted by research biologists. Ackerman believes mule deer vulnerability is determined by their behavior, such as group alertness"
