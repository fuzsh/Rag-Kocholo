        "text": "RJT said on 28/Sep/21\n\nYeah in that Terminator movie look close with Arnie when wearing equal footwears\n\nShe's a cheeky one\n\nClick Here\n\nChris Junior Hernandez 1990 said on 31/Dec/20\n\nClick Here Only 2.25\" looking heels she easily edge out 5'11.25\" Gabriel Luna by an inch, if Luna is 6'0.25\" with that dress shoes then Mackenzie isn't lying being 5'11 barefoot. Also she doesn't look lower than Arnie which i'm not talking about heels advantage.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nshe can look near 5ft 11 with linda and gabriel\n\nSoda machine said on 29/Nov/20\n\n5-10. Imo\n\nChris Junior Hernandez 1990 said on 25/Aug/20\n\nHave see her enough to tell anything 179.5-180 cm as her lowest height is possible. I would have buy her 5'11 claim. Taller than Nicole Kidman.\n\nDmeyer said on 1/Jun/20\n\ni knew 178 was too small 179 much better , on screen she looks 6-1 impression on dark fate\n\nJam Cherry said on 7/May/20\n\nShe looks like a robot ... 179.5 cm +/- 05 at 5â10.75â might be most accurate guess perhaps\n\nVexacus said on 26/Mar/20\n\nTall lady . She looked 5'11 on Terminator Dark Fate.\n\nChris Junior Hernandez 1990 said on 25/Dec/19\n\nI will not be surprise if Mackenzie get another 1/4 upgrade very soon. She's too tall for 5'10, look quite close to 5'11. Probably same height as Jason Bateman in person.\n\nChaits chaser said on 13/Nov/19\n\nsaw the new Terminator movie. should be 179 or 180 cms.\n\nCritty said on 5/Nov/19\n\nShe says herself that she's 5'11 when asked in the podcast \"Talk Easy,\" 21:46 mins in. Solves it! Im about the same height so it made me feel really good to hear, plus she rocks heels all the time which is very inspiring. Not always easy for tall women to own it like that. Love her.\n\nListen here: Click Here\n\nAnimus said on 30/Oct/19\n\nShe looked tall in the new Terminator movie. In several scenes she appeared to be quite close in height to Schwarzenegger. Overall she still seemed a bit shorter than him, so 5'10 seems fair.\n\nChris Junior Hernandez 1990 said on 10/Oct/19\n\nBecause Arnie is 5'10 3/4 and Gabriell Luna 5'11 flat. Mackenzie is 5'10 1/4 not below it.\n\nBarry Fl said on 19/Jul/19\n\nYes... gotta say... as a 5'10 (genuine!!) man... she doesn't strike me as 5'10. She strikes me as someone who'd be a good deal above me even in flat shoes. And my first wife was 6 foot, so I'm not out of my depth my tall women!\n\nAndy Cole said on 7/Apr/19\n\n@houss\n\nSo true after looking at the terminator cinemacon pictures. There is NO WAY she is 5ft 10 if Luna and Arnold are both 5ft 11. The pictures where they received the awards, Davis was wearing flats with zero heels and she is the same height as Gabriel Luna who is wearing boot with heels. I kinda pity her because she usually tries to stand behind her castmates most of the time when taking pictures.\n\nhouss said on 5/Apr/19\n\nshe looked taller than both arnold and gabriel luna\n\nArch Stanton said on 4/Mar/19\n\nClick Here\n\nLooks very tall in heels!\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI think in the white heels, they looked quite thick, but I still would go around 5ft 10 barefoot.\n\nArch Stanton said on 4/Mar/19\n\nClick Here\n\nLee Pace is probably about 6'5 there in shoes? How tall is she really? She might be Nicole Kidman range.\n\nArch Stanton said on 4/Mar/19\n\nI don't know if my post on the weekend came through but I had to clear my cache on this computer to get through. You might want to look at her more, if she was listed at 5'10 I think it's a downgrade, I think she looks taller, the current guestimate might be very close.\n\nArch Stanton said on 2/Mar/19\n\n@Rob, she's more than 0.25 taller than Theron, little chance of 5'10 flat IMO. the average guess here might be nearer the truth.\n\nMimi said on 2/Jan/19\n\nGuesses are too high. I would put her not more than a 1/4 inch over 5ft10\n\nJunior Hernandez 1990 said on 31/Dec/18\n\nCould be a full 178cm in Halt and Catch Fire.\n\nNik said on 8/Aug/18\n\nThe average vote is very high for this girl!\n\nLin said on 7/Aug/18\n\nShe looks a bit taller than Charlize Theron, but not too much, less than 1 inch\n\nMAD SAM said on 5/Aug/18\n\nRob this listing is too short for her, sheâs 5â11.25â at 181 cm\n\nCliff said on 30/Jul/18\n\nShe's 5'11\"\n\nPerri said on 12/May/18\n\nAs a causal fan of her i've heard her mentioned that she's 5'11 in a podcast. I think she's not lying because i've seen pictures of her family around. Her dad seems to be roughly 6'4, 6'5 and is at least a head taller than her.\n\nShe also seems to be taller than Charlize Theron in tully.\n\nmatt666 said on 5/May/18\n\nshe looks 5'11.5-6 ft\n\nBobby said on 9/Jan/18\n\nThis is bending down a lot everytime she walks OR she is walking with one foot bent - like in the first post picture above.\n\nI think she is masking her height, stating that it's 5'10 but I personally think she is leaning more towards 5'11 or maybe even a bit more.\n\nIt's easier for her to get roles if she falls under 5'11 - where most hollywood women would be.\n\nAnonymous said on 11/Oct/17\n\nIn Blade Runner, she didn't seem THAT much shorter than Ryan Gosling in one of their scenes. Although it might have been the camera angle adjusted to make him look taller.\n\nCharles said on 30/Sep/17\n\nLooks around 4 inches shorter than 6'3.5 Lee Pace, in heels of course. Quite evidently she is nowhere near 6' tall, let alone 6'1, as was suggested below. How much of a height advantage do her platform heels give over Lee Pace's rather flat shoes?\n\nShe seems about 1-1.5 inches taller than 5'8.5 Scoot McNairy, still wearing platform heels and standing on one leg (which, at least in my case, increases my height by half an inch or thereabouts).\n\nAll in all, the full 5'10 seems quite unlikely to me.\n\nClick Here\n\nTeddy said on 21/Sep/17\n\n@Richie\n\nIn all the photos I've seen of her, she's deliberately dropping her posture to mask her height.\n\nDespite that, I think 5'10\" is spot on.\n\nWarren said on 25/Jun/17\n\nCanadian actress.\n\nWill C said on 10/Jun/16\n\nI'm not really into tall girls but I've seen her in two movies Awkward Moments and The Martian she could change my mind about tall girls which she is not really that tall but in conclusion she STUNINGLEE BEUTIFUL\n\nRichie said on 25/Jan/16\n\nshe claims to be 5 10 but i think she is more like 6 1 or 6 . she is probably laying about her height because been too tall can be a problem in acting"
