        "text": "Department areas designated as open to the public may be accessed and used for hiking; sightseeing; nature observation; entering or remaining on designated portions of department areas; possession of pets and hunting dogs; field trials; use of vehicles, bicycles, horses, and horseback riding; collecting of nuts, berries, fruits, edible wild greens, and mushrooms; camping; tree stands; target shooting and use of shooting ranges; decoys and blinds; use of boats and motors; taking bullfrogs and green frogs; hunting; trapping; and fishing. The locations and times when department areas may be entered, remained on, or used for these activities may be further restricted by Chapter 11 of the Wildlife Code, signs, this conservation atlas, or area maps. In addition to the rules of the Wildlife Code, federal, state and local laws apply on department lands.\n\nThe following activities are prohibited on department areas and may not be authorized by a special use permit:\n\n1. Destruction, defacing, or removal of department property\n\n2. Digging or excavating\n\n3. Guiding for pay\n\n4. Military or law enforcement training by nongovernment entities\n\n5. Placing of grain, salt products, minerals, and other consumable products on land\n\n6. Placing or using trail or game cameras or other similar devices\n\n7. Use of paint ball, airsoft, or similar projectile weapons not specifically authorized by this Code\n\n8. Placement of honey bee apiaries\n\n9. Parking or storage of watercraft and commercial vehicles during closed hours\n\n10. Use of fireworks\n\n11. Use of remote-controlled boats or land vehicles\n\n12. Prospecting, exploring, mining, or extracting minerals, metals, oil, natural gas, or other nonrenewable resources, except as specifically approved by the commission\n\n13. Commercial or political advertising, except for commercial advertising by authorized concessionaires or by vendors participating in department events\n\nOther activities not listed above, including commercial use and vending, may be authorized by a special use permit when the activity is compatible with other authorized activities. Special use permits may be issued only by the area manager or their designee. Issuance of a special use permit is at the discretion of the department. Application for a special use permit does not guarantee that one will be issued.\n\nSigns, posted regulations, or area maps may further restrict activities, including designating portions of department areas as open or closed to public use. Department areas or designated portions of department areas may be closed, or regulations may be changed, through posting to protect the public from hazardous conditions and threats to public safety, to protect fish and wildlife resources, and for special events or resource management activities where public use conflicts are likely to occur. All persons entering, remaining on, or using a department area shall abide by signs, posted regulations, and area maps.\n\nDeer hunting is allowed only on Conservation Department Areas that are listed in the current Fall Deer and Turkey Pamphlet. Please reference pages 45-59 for regulations about this specific area. If an area that is owned or managed by the department is not listed in the booklet, then deer hunting is not allowed.\n\nArchery hunting permits are not valid during the November Portion of the Firearms Deer Hunting Season. Hunters using archery methods during this portion must possess a valid firearms deer hunting permit.\n\nDeer may not be hunted, pursued, taken, or killed: While in a stream or other body of water; from a boat with a motor attached; with the aid of a motor-driven land conveyance or aircraft; with the aid of dogs, in use or possession; with the aid of artificial light or night vision equipment; within any area enclosed by a fence greater than seven feet in height that could contain or restrict the free range of deer; and with the aid of bait.\n\nFall firearms turkey hunting is allowed only on Conservation Areas listed on pages 45-59 in the current Fall Deer and Turkey Pamphlet. Fall firearms turkey season regulations can be found on page 28 of the pamphlet.\n\nDeer may be taken in accordance with permits held. Hunters may take only two antlered deer during the firearms and archery deer hunting seasons combined. The following restrictions also apply:\n\nOnly one antlered deer may be taken during all portions of the firearms deer hunting seasons (This includes landowners in possession of both landowner any-deer hunting permits and regular any-deer hunting permits).\n\nLimits apply to the number of antlerless deer hunting permits a hunter may fill in each county. Exceptions to this limit may apply to qualifying resident landowners and lessees. Consult the current Fall Deer and Turkey Hunting Regulations and Information Pamphlet.\n\nAntler point restrictions apply in some counties. In these counties, only antlered deer with at least one antler having at least four antler points may be taken (The antler point restriction does not apply to youth hunters hunting on a firearms permit during the youth portions of the firearms season). Consult the current Fall Deer and Turkey Hunting Regulations and Information Pamphlet.\n\nOnly one antlered deer may be taken prior to the November portion of the firearms deer hunting season. Except, youth hunters who harvest an antlered deer on an archery permit prior to the November portion, may harvest their second antlered deer during the Early Youth Portion of the firearms deer hunting season."
