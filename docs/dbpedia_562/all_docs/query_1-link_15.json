        "text": "Iowa Hawkeye wrestling is unique. Few teams garner a fan base quite as passionate, sell out an arena as often and have the cult following as intense as this legendary wrestling program does year after year. The Black and Gold Iowa faithful know wrestling.\n\nHISTORY BOOKS: 10 all-time dream college wrestling matchups at every weight\n\nThe Hawkeyes are now led by a coach who won NCAA and Olympic titles for the program and most recently coached one of the most dominant college teams in NCAA history. Head coach Tom Brands started competing for the Hawkeyes in 1988, and he's been at the school almost every year since.\n\nUnder Brands, the Hawks have won four NCAA titles, trained 21 Olympic and World Team members and produced 13 NCAA champions. Three Hawkeyes have also won the Hodge Trophy, wrestling's equivalent to the Heisman Trophy; Brands coached two of those three athletes. The team has also won six Big Ten Championships and produced 89 All-Americans. Along with his brother Terry and his assistant coach Ryan Morningstar, Iowa has continued a history of excellence that began well before their time.\n\nON THE MAT: The college wrestling head coaches who had the best NCAA wrestling careers\n\nThe first team championship came in 1975 under head coach Gary Kurdelmeier, an NCAA champion for the Hawkeyes himself in 1958. Kurdelmeier would go on to be inducted into the Iowa Wrestling Hall of Fame, but his biggest contribution was creating a winning culture and a dominant program that went on to win 22 more team titles.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the Iowa wrestling dynasty, including season-by-season records and breakdowns of every one of the Hawkeyes' championships.\n\nIowa wrestling quick facts\n\nCoach: Tom Brands\n\nLocation: Iowa City, Iowa\n\nAll-time record (through the 2020-21 season): 1031-231-31\n\nNCAA championships: 1975, 1976, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2021\n\nConference tournament championships: 1915, 1916, 1958, 1962, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2015, 2020, 2021\n\nIowa wrestling has won a total of 24 national championships, including back-to-back titles from 1975-1976 as well as consecutive titles from 1978-1986, 1991-1993, 1995-2000 and 2008-2010.

Led by national champions Chuck Yagla and Dan Holm, the Hawkeyes finished with a solid 102 points in the 1975 tournament to earn a convincing win over second-place Oklahoma. The team also put five athletes on the podium, setting a new school record for number of All-Americans at the NCAA tournament. The win marked the first national title for Gary Kurdelmeier, but he wasn't done yet.\n\n1976 (see the full brackets)\n\nNational Champions:\n\nBrad Smith ( 142 pounds)\n\nChuck Yagla (150 pounds)\n\nChris Campbell (177 pounds)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nTim Cysewski (3rd, 134 pounds)\n\nDan Wagemann (2nd, 167 pounds)\n\nBud Palmer (3rd, 190 pounds)\n\nDoug Benschoter (5th, Unlimited)\n\nThat 1975 championship set the new standard. In his final year of coaching before moving on to athletic administration, Kurdelmeier built upon his success the previous year and guided Iowa to its first back-to-back titles in program history. Yagla led the team with his second individual national title, but teammates Brad Smith and Chris Campbell also won gold. Tim Cysewski, Dan Wagemann, Bud Palmer, Doug Benschoter earned All-American honors to again break the program record for All-Americans at the tournament, a mark set the previous year. Iowa State finished 37.5 points behind the reigning Hawkeyes, while Yagla became the first Iowa wrestler to earn the Most Outstanding Wrestler award at the tournament.\n\n“I had a good career at Iowa and was there during the start of the so-called dynasty,” Yagla told HawkeyeSports in 2013. \"But my freshman year was Dan Gable’s first year as an assistant coach and Gary Kurdelmeier’s first year as a head coach. So it was only partly because I was there that good things began to happen at Iowa.”\n\n1978 (see the full brackets)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nDan Glenn (3rd, 118 pounds)\n\nRandy Lewis (2nd, 126 pounds)\n\nScott Trizzino (3rd, 142 pounds)\n\nBruce Kinseth (2nd, 150 pounds)\n\nMike DeAnna (6th, 167 pounds)\n\nJohn Bowlsby (5th, Unlimited)\n\n1978 brought a narrow victory, but a victory nonetheless for the Hawkeyes, and the year signaled the first in what would ultimately become 15 total for the famous Hawkeye coach Dan Gable. Iowa did not have a single national champion on this championship team, but six All-Americans allowed the team to edge out Iowa State by half a point to earn its third title in four years.\n\n1979 (see the full brackets)\n\nNational Champions:\n\nRandy Lewis (126 pounds)\n\nBruce Kinseth (150 pounds)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nDan Glenn (3rd, 118 pounds)\n\nScott Trizzino (2nd, 142 pounds)\n\nMike DeAnna (2nd, 167 pounds)\n\nBud Palmer (2nd, 177 pounds)\n\nBruce Kinseth, a national runner-up in 1979, highlighted Gable's and Iowa's second national championship as he pinned his way through both the Big Ten and NCAA tournament to set the program record of in-season pins at 23. Joining Kinseth on the top of the podium for the Hawkeyes in 1979 was Randy Lewis, also a national runner-up the year before. The Hawkeyes again beat out in-state rival Iowa State for the title, but this time extended the gap between first and second to 34.5 points.\n\n1980 (view full brackets)\n\nNational champions:\n\nRandy Lewis (134 pounds)\n\nEd Banach (177 pounds)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nDan Glenn (2nd, 118 pounds)\n\nLenny Zalesky (4th, 142 pounds)\n\nKing Mueller (3rd, 150 pounds)\n\nMark Stevenson (7th, 158 pounds)\n\nDoug Anderson (8th, 167 pounds)\n\nDean Phinney (3rd, Unlimited)\n\nIowa added two more national champions to the history books along with six additional All-Americans, setting a new school record on the way to winning its third consecutive national title. The team beat out second-place finisher Oklahoma State by 23.75 points, despite the Cowboys also finishing the tournament with two national champions. As college wrestling moved into a new decade, so did the Hawkeyes, and this decade would be marked with even more title wins for the Black and Gold.\n\n1981 (view full brackets)\n\nNational champions:\n\nEd Banach (177 pounds)\n\nLou Banach (Unlimited)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nBarry Davis (7th, 118 pounds)\n\nTim Riley (7th, 126 pounds)\n\nRandy Lewis (7th, 134 pounds)\n\nLenny Zalesky (2nd, 142 pounds)\n\nScott Trizzino (2nd, 150 pounds)\n\nJim Zalesky (5th, 158 pounds)\n\nMike DeAnna (2nd, 167 pounds)\n\nThe 1981 NCAA champion was the year of the Banach Brothers. Twins Lou and Ed Banach each captured NCAA titles as they helped propel Iowa to its fourth consecutive NCAA title. With Ed Banach earning his second title at 177 pounds and Lou Banach picking up gold at heavyweight, these two athletes showed the world what the Banach family was made of. The Hawkeyes also put nine athletes on the podium at the NCAA tournament, the most All-Americans the team had ever produced in one season until 2020. In addition, this year's team became the winningest team in program history after earning victory in 21 duals during the season. 1981 was unquestionably a banner year for the program.\n\n1982 (view full brackets)\n\nNational Champions:\n\nBarry Davis (118 pounds)\n\nJim Zalesky (158 pounds)\n\nPete Bush (190 pounds)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nJeff Kerber (6th, 134 pounds)\n\nLenny Zalesky (2nd, 142 pounds\n\nDave Fitzgerald (7th, 167 pounds)\n\nLou Banach (3rd, Unlimited)\n\nEd Banach (2nd, 177 pounds)\n\nAnother Iowa-Iowa State NCAA championship race once again ended with Gable's Hawkeyes hoisting the national trophy again. The Hawkeyes put three champs on the podium this year and had two sets of brothers earn All-American honors for a total of 131.75 team points. Barry Davis, a 118-pounder who finished seventh the year before, set the school record for season wins during the Hawkeyes' 1981-1982 campaign, posting a total of 43 victories, a mark that he later broke himself. Iowa also posted an undefeated record this season as the team added to its trophy collection.\n\n1983 (view full brackets)\n\nNational champions:\n\nBarry Davis (126 pounds)\n\nJim Zalesky (158 pounds)\n\nEd Banach (190 pounds)\n\nLou Banach (Unlimited)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nTim Riley (5th, 118 pounds)\n\nJeff Kerber (5th, 134 pounds)\n\nHarlan Kistler (3rd, 142 pounds)\n\nJim Heffernan (4th, 150 pounds)\n\nDuane Goldman (2nd, 177 pounds)\n\nFour national champions, nine All-Americans, and another title run for the Hawkeyes, that's what 1983 was all about for Dan Gable and his squad. Nine athletes on this team also won conference titles and paced the team to a 17-1 dual season record as the Hawkeyes continued to chase and break team as well as sport records. The year was monumental not just for the team's success, but also because it marked the year when Davis, Zalensky and both Banach brothers became multiple-time NCAA champions together. The Hawkeyes had found their dominant rhythm and would go on to win three more consecutive NCAA titles to extend their winning streak to nine.\n\n1984 (view full brackets)\n\nNational champions:\n\nJim Zalesky (158 pounds)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nTim Riley (5th, 118 pounds)\n\nMark Trizzino (4th, 126 pounds)\n\nGreg Randall (2nd, 134 pounds)\n\nJeff Kerber (6th, 142 pounds)\n\nMarty Kistler (2nd, 150 pounds)\n\nLindley Kistler (2nd, 167 pounds)\n\nDuane Goldman (2nd, 177 pounds)\n\nThe degree of separation between Iowa and its opponents continued to grow in 1984 as the team dominated the NCAA championships with 123.75 points, a national champion, and eight All-Americans. Led by three-time NCAA champion Jim Zalesky, the Hawkeyes had four additional athletes in the NCAA finals, including another family connection as the Kistler brothers each finished second at 150 and 167 pounds. Head coach Dan Gable was building something special, and his reputation and success would land him the head coaching job for Team USA at the 1984 Olympics.\n\n1985 (view full brackets)\n\nNational champions:\n\nBarry Davis (126 pounds)\n\nMarty Kistler (158 pounds)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nMatt Egeland (2nd, 118 pounds)\n\nGreg Randall (5th, 134 pounds)\n\nKevin Dresser (4th, 142 pounds)\n\nJim Heffernan (2nd, 150 pounds)\n\nLindley Kistler (5th, 167 pounds)\n\nRico Chiapparelli (5th, 177 pounds)\n\nDuane Goldman (2nd, 190 pounds)\n\nThe 1985 championships was all Gable's world, and everyone else was just living in it. The Iowa Hawkeyes dominated the NCAA tournament with two national champions and five NCAA finalists, the second year in a row that the Black and Gold sent five athletes into the final match. For the third time in his career, Iowa's Davis also won a national title, and his performance in the 126-pound weight class earned him Outstanding Wrestling honors. A monumental undefeated season and another title run for the Hawkeyes ended with an 18-0 dual record and nine All-Americans. \"Fight for Iowa\" was becoming a local and national anthem in the wrestling community.\n\n1986 (view full brackets)\n\nNational champions:\n\nBrad Penrith (126 pounds)\n\nKevin Dresser (142 pounds)\n\nJim Heffernan (150 pounds)\n\nMarty Kistler (167 pounds)\n\nDuane Goldman (190 pounds)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nGreg Randall (2nd, 134 pounds)\n\nRoyce Alger (5th, 158 pounds)\n\nRico Chiapparelli (4th, 177 pounds)\n\nIn front of a hometown crowd and roaring chants of Hawkeye support, Dan Gable led the Hawkeyes to their ninth consecutive championship highlighted by five individual champions, three additional All-Americans and a handful of broken records. Marty Kistler won his second consecutive NCAA title while previous All-Americans Kevin Dresser, Jim Heffernan and Duane Goldman found their way to the top of the podium for the first time in their careers. As a team, Iowa broke the NCAA scoring record with 158 points, a whopping 73.25 points ahead of NCAA runner-up Oklahoma, and tied the NCAA record for most consecutive NCAA titles. The Iowa streak would be broken the following year, but in 1986, all was golden in Iowa City.\n\n1991 (view full brackets)\n\nNational champions:\n\nTom Brands (134 pounds)\n\nMark Reiland (167 pounds)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nChad Zaputil (2nd, 118 pounds)\n\nTerry Brands (2nd, 126 pounds)\n\nTroy Steiner (2nd, 142 pounds)\n\nTerry Steiner (3rd, 150 pounds)\n\nTom Ryan (2nd, 158 pounds)\n\nBart Chelesvig (3rd, 177 pounds)\n\nTravis Fiser (6th, 190 pounds)\n\nFive years after their last title, the Iowa Hawkeyes were back on top again, as Dan Gable compiled yet another championship team led by elite performers. His streak in the 1990's would be shorter than his earlier title runs, but nevertheless, three consecutive national titles showed the world that Iowa wasn't done fighting. Leading the way for the Hawks was two-time NCAA champion Tom Brands, a man who would go on to coach the Hawkeyes to even more NCAA titles. Mark Reiland also won gold, while Brands' brother Terry, Chad Zaputil, Troy Steiner and another future NCAA title winning head coach Tom Ryan finished as NCAA runner-ups. Another banner year for the Hawks came to a close with nine All-Americans and a championship banner for Carver-Hawkeye Arena.\n\n1992 (view complete brackets)\n\nNational champions:\n\nTerry Brands (126 pounds)\n\nTom Brands (134 pounds)\n\nTroy Steiner (142 pounds)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nChad Zaputil (2nd, 118 pounds)\n\nTerry Steiner (5th, 150 pounds)\n\nTom Ryan (3rd, 158 pounds)\n\nBart Chelesvig (3rd, 177 pounds)\n\nTravis Fiser (5th, 190 pounds)\n\nJohn Oostendorp (5th, 275 pounds)\n\nAll three national champions from the 1992 winning Hawkeye team went on to be impactful coaches at the collegiate level after their own athletic careers concluded. But at this time, they were simply the talented, determined young men that propelled Iowa to a second-consecutive national title. The lightweights proved to be Hawkeye territory as Chad Zaputil made the finals at 118 pounds and Tom and Terry Brands along with Troy Steiner swept 126, 134 and 142. Tom Brands was ultimately named the Outstanding Wrestler of the tournament as he picked up his third career title. The season also marked Gable's third undefeated year of his Iowa coaching career and the 19th time that the Hawkeyes won the conference tournament in a row.\n\n1993 (view complete brackets)\n\nNational champions:\n\nLincoln McIlravy (142 pounds)\n\nTerry Steiner (150 pounds)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nChad Zaputil (2nd, 118 pounds)\n\nTroy Steiner (3rd, 134 pounds)\n\nRay Brinzer (3rd, 177 pounds)\n\nJoel Sharratt (2nd, 190 pounds)\n\nJohn Oostendorp (3rd, 275 pounds)\n\nThe 1993 championship didn't produce the most amount of NCAA champions Iowa had seen, and the tournament didn't yield the greatest number of Hawkeye All-Americans in program history. But the season did produce a second Steiner NCAA champ and the rise of future three-time champion Lincoln McIlravy, both middleweight athletes who climbed their way to the top through adversity. Steiner earned the national tournament's Most Outstanding Wrestler honor, and Iowa capped off another winning year with head coach Dan Gable winning Big Ten Coach of the Year honors for the first time in his career. The team would fall twenty points short of the title in 1994, but Gable came back in 1995 for the start of another program title streak.\n\n1995 (view complete brackets)\n\nNational champions:\n\nJeff McGinness (126 pounds)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nMike Mena (3rd, 118 pounds)\n\nMark Ironside (6th, 134 pounds)\n\nBill Zadick (5th, 142 pounds)\n\nLincoln McIlravy (2nd, 150 pounds)\n\nDaryl Weber (6th, 158 pounds)\n\nMatt Nerem (6th, 167 pounds)\n\nRay Brinzer (3rd, 177 pounds)\n\nJoel Sharratt (2nd, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Hawks may not have won the 1994 championship, but they came back with a vengeance in 1995 and put nine of ten wrestlers on the podium with one wrestler, Jeff McGinness, taking home a national title. Gable was continuing to establish a deep team of gifted athletes who would go on to be some of the best to ever wrestle for the Black and Gold. At the conference level, Iowa remained dominant as well, earning a 22nd conference Big Ten tournament title and remaining undefeated during the dual season. Wins were expected in Iowa, and for a team that fell just short of gold in 1994, 1995 felt like a return to normalcy.\n\n1996 (view complete brackets)\n\nNational champions:\n\nBill Zadick (142 pounds)\n\nJoe Williams (158 pounds)\n\nDaryl Weber (167 pounds)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nMike Mena (5th, 118 pounds)\n\nMark Ironside (3rd, 134 pounds)\n\nMike Uker (8th, 150 pounds)\n\nLee Fullhart (4th, 190 pounds)\n\nIn a year full of honors for the Hawkeyes, Bill Zadick, Joe Williams and Daryl Weber stand out as the three champions from the 1995-1996 Hawkeye team that won its 16th NCAA tournament and its 23rd straight conference tournament. Zadick and Weber stood on the podium for the first time as they ended their collegiate careers in a spot that had a eluded them in the past. Sophomore Joe Williams won the first of his three titles, while Mark Ironside, who would go on to be one of just three Hawkeyes to ever win the Hodge Trophy, earned his first All-American honor. Three additional Hawkeyes, Mike Mena, Mike Uker and Lee Fullheart, also collected All-American honors as Iowa head coach Dan Gable was once again honored as the Big Ten Coach of the Year.\n\n1997 (view complete brackets)\n\nNational champions:\n\nJesse Whitmer (118 pounds)\n\nMark Ironside (134 pounds)\n\nLincoln McIlravy (150 pounds)\n\nJoe Williams (158 pounds)\n\nLee Fullhart (190 pounds)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nMike Mena (2nd, 126 pounds)\n\nKasey Gilliss (6th, 142 pounds)\n\nMike Uker (5th, 167 pounds)\n\nFive national champions in 1997 gave the Hawkeyes a new NCAA points record with 170 with second-place Oklahoma State finishing over 50 points behind at 113.5. This squad, led by NCAA champs Jesse Whitmer, Mark Ironside, Lincoln McIlravy, Joe Williams, Lee Fullhart, is considered to be one of the best Hawkeye lineups in program history given the amount of points scored and the resumes of these stars. The Hawks also had an NCAA finalist in Mike Mena and two additional All-Americans in Kasey Gilliss and Mike Uker.\n\n1998 (view complete brackets)\n\nNational champions:\n\nMark Ironside (134 pounds)\n\nJeff McGinness (142 pounds)\n\nJoe Williams (167 pounds)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nEric Juergens (3rd, 118 pounds)\n\nLee Fullhart (3rd, 190 pounds)\n\nWes Hand (8th, 275 pounds)\n\nA new coach, the same tradition of success. Following the retirement of head coach Dan Gable, three-time Hawkeye national champion Jim Zalesky took the reins and kept the momentum rolling. Zalesky led Iowa to a narrow and fiercely-fought title win over Minnesota by 13 points in 1998 headlined by the success of the tournament's Most Outstanding Wrestler Joe Williams. Joining Williams on the top of the podium were multiple-time NCAA champions Mark Ironside and Jeff McGinness. The Hawks also had two wrestlers finish third and a seventh All-American in Wes Hand finish eighth. Gable made his mark in Iowa City, but Zalesky showed that the heart of the program remained strong as he guided Iowa into a new era.\n\n1999 (view complete brackets)\n\nNational champions:\n\nDoug Schwab (141 pounds)\n\nT.J. Williams (149 pounds)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nEric Juergens (3rd, 133 pounds)\n\nJamie Heidt (8th, 157 pounds)\n\nLee Fullhart (2nd, 197 pounds)\n\nThe Hawkeyes ended the decade at the 1999 NCAA championship winning their eighth title in 10 years and producing two national champions in Doug Schwab and T.J. Williams. Both athletes also won conference titles along with Jamie Heidt. The race for the title in 1999 however, was the closest the Hawks had been a part of in 20 years, beating Minnesota by just two points. The team separated itself from the pack further in 2000, beating Iowa State by 6.5 points, but their dominance was slipping ever so slightly.\n\n2000 (view complete brackets)\n\nNational champions:\n\nEric Juergens (133 pounds)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nJody Strittmatter (3rd, 125 pounds)\n\nDoug Schwab (3rd, 141 pounds)\n\nMike Zadick (7th, 149 pounds)\n\nT.J. Williams (3rd, 157 pounds)\n\nWes Hand (2nd, 285 pounds)\n\nThe Hawkeyes rolled into the new millennium with the same force that allowed them to dominant the late eighties and early nineties. Led by national champion and three-time All-American Eric Juergens, Jim Zalesky's squad edged out in-state rival Iowa State by just 6.5 points to claim their twentieth title. The 2000 championship title would be the last for the Hawkeyes for eight more years, but they ended strong and added the first banner of the decade to Carver-Hawkeye. Twenty years after this tournament, Iowa would produce a squad potentially as dangerous and dominant as any squad in program history. While the twenty-year anniversary of this 2000 win would not be marked with another title due to COVID-19, the 2000 championship will be remembered in Hawkeye history as the last title under the Jim Zalesky era and one that continued the Iowa success story.\n\n2008 (view complete brackets)\n\nNational champion:\n\nBrent Metcalf (149 pounds)\n\nMark Perry (165 pounds)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nCharlie Falck (6th, 125 pounds)\n\nJoey Slaton (2nd, 133 pounds)\n\nJay Borschel (3rd, 174 pounds)\n\nPhillip Keddy (6th, 184 pounds)\n\nMatt Fields (5th, 285 pounds)\n\nIn 2006, Iowa legend and Olympic gold medalist Tom Brands returned to the program that built him with the mission of inspiring a winning program and taking Iowa to new heights. He took on the role with focus and fierceness, determined to coach athletes up to his level and beyond. One year later, Brands' squad lifted the trophy that he once lifted as an athlete. The Hawkeyes were on top again. Brent Metcalf and Mark Perry were largely responsible for that victory, as the two national champions raked in big points for Iowa, but a slew of five additional All-Americans proved to be the difference. Brands was back, and so was Iowa.\n\n2009 (view complete brackets)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nDaniel Dennis (7th, 133 pounds)\n\nBrent Metcalf (2nd, 149 pounds)\n\nRyan Morningstar (3rd, 165 pounds)\n\nPhillip Keddy (4th, 184 pounds)\n\nDan Erekson (4th, 285 pounds)\n\nTom Brands didn't even need a national champion in 2009 to win the NCAA tournament, and as the Hawkeyes put five on the podium and edged out Ohio State by 4.5 points to win the title, Brands had officially started a tournament winning streak of his own. Future Olympian and Hawkeye Wrestling Club head coach Daniel Dennis took seventh at 133 pounds while star and future Iowa State assistant coach Brent Metcalf took second at 149 pounds in an infamous final bout. Ryan Morningstar, who would go on to coach with Brands as an assistant for the Hawkeyes after his career, took third at 165 pounds and Phillip Keddy took fourth in what would be the second of three All-American finishes for the Hawkeye. Dan Erekson rounded out the lineup with his fourth place at heavyweight, ending a competitive tournament that left the Hawkeyes wanting more.\n\n2010 (view complete brackets)\n\nNational champion:\n\nMatt McDonough (125 pounds)\n\nBrent Metcalf (149 pounds)\n\nJay Borschel (174 pounds)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nDaniel Dennis (2nd, 133 pounds)\n\nMontell Marion (2nd, 141 pounds)\n\nRyan Morningstar (7th, 165 pounds)\n\nFrom zero national champs to three, Iowa put Matt McDonough, Brent Metcalf and Jay Borschel on top of the podium in 2010 for what would be Tom Brands' last NCAA title to date. The win marked Iowa's 23rd title, and the team also added a conference title that year, bringing the Big Ten championship count to 34. Brands, who won Big Ten Coach of the Year for the third time in 2010, now heads into the 2020-2021 season with 2010 All-Americans Ryan Morningstar on his staff for another season and Daniel Dennis at the helm of the Hawkeye Wrestling Club.\n\n2021 (see full brackets)\n\nNational champion:\n\nSpencer Lee (125 pounds)\n\nAll-Americans:\n\nAustin DeSanto (3rd, 133 pounds)\n\nJaydin Eierman (2nd, 141 pounds)\n\nKaleb Young (7th, 157 pounds)\n\nMichael Kemerer (2nd, 174 pounds)\n\nJacob Warner (4th, 197 pounds)\n\nTony Cassioppi (3rd, 285 pounds)"
