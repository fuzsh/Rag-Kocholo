Medway - On March 7, 2024, Lowell "Barry" B. Davis passed away peacefully at the age of 76, with his family at his side. Barry was many things: an Army Captain, a helicopter pilot, a fisherman, a loving husband, and a father of three, to name just a few. He was most well-known as the owner of Two Rivers Canoe & Tackle and was a generous member of the Katahdin area community; many people will undoubtedly remember him fondly.

He was born on February 21, 1948, in Millinocket, ME, to Lowell W. Davis Jr. and Addie Irene (Nicholson) Davis. Barry is survived by his wife of 46 years, Nancy; their son, Lowell and his wife, Elyza; and his three sisters, Linda, Tina, and Gayleen. He has four beautiful grandchildren, Gianna, Micah, Amberlyn, and Lila; as well as several nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his daughter, Kendie Jean; son, Shannon Scott; and his brothers, Duane and Wade.

In lieu of flowers, Barry asked that "any donations should be to help feed or warm locals who need help. Please keep them in your mind." In his life, Barry made several donations to I-Care Ministries and Preble Oil Co. His final wishes included a request that donations be made to one of these two organizations to help those in need.

Mourners are invited to join his family for calling hours at Lamson Funeral Home, 11 Tamarack Street, Millinocket, on Saturday, March 16, from 2-4 p.m. where Military Honors will be presented at 4 p.m. Messages of condolence may be expressed at Barry's Book of Memories at lamsonfh.com.
