WarschilkaMusic byJohn Carpenter\n\nAlan Howarth\n\nProduction\n\ncompany\n\nDistributed by20th Century Fox[1]\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n99 minutes[1]CountryUnited States[1]LanguageEnglishBudget$19–25 million[2][3]Box office$11.1 million\n\nBig Trouble in Little China (also known as John Carpenter's Big Trouble in Little China) is a 1986 American fantasy action-comedy film co-scored and directed by John Carpenter, and starring Kurt Russell, Kim Cattrall, Dennis Dun and James Hong. The film tells the story of truck driver Jack Burton (Russell), who helps his friend Wang Chi (Dun) rescue Wang's green-eyed fiancée from bandits in San Francisco's Chinatown. They go into the mysterious underworld beneath Chinatown, where they face an ancient sorcerer named David Lo Pan (Hong), who requires a woman with green eyes to marry him in order to be released from a centuries-old curse.[4]\n\nAlthough the original screenplay by first-time screenwriters Gary Goldman and David Z. Weinstein was envisioned as a Western set in the 1880s, screenwriter W. D. Richter was hired to rewrite the script extensively and modernize it. The studio hired Carpenter to direct the film and rushed Big Trouble in Little China into production so that it would be released before a similarly themed Eddie Murphy film, The Golden Child, which was slated to come out around the same time. The project fulfilled Carpenter's long-standing desire to make a martial arts film.\n\nDespite receiving generally positive reviews, the film was a commercial failure, grossing $11.1 million in North America, below its estimated $19 to $25 million budget. This left Carpenter disillusioned with Hollywood and influenced his decision to return to independent filmmaking. In later years, the film gained a steady audience on home video, and has become a cult classic.\n\nTruck driver Jack Burton wins a bet with his friend Wang Chi. To make sure he follows through on payment, Jack accompanies him to the airport to pick up Wang's Chinese fiancée Miao Yin, where a Chinese-American street gang, the Lords of Death, tries to kidnap another Chinese girl. She is being met by her friend Gracie Law. After Jack intervenes, they take Miao Yin instead.\n\nJack and Wang track the Lords of Death to Chinatown, where they find a funeral procession that erupts into a battle between the Chang Sing and Wing Kong, two ancient Chinese warrior societies. When \"The Three Storms\" – Thunder, Rain, and Lightning, warriors with weather-themed powers – appear, slaughtering the Chang Sing, Jack attempts to gun his big-rig through the crowd, but runs over David Lo Pan, a man directing the Three Storms. Horrified, Jack exits his truck, but finds Lo Pan unhurt and glowing with magic. Wang hurriedly guides Jack through the alleys; they escape, but Jack's truck is stolen.\n\nWang takes Jack to his restaurant, where they meet with Gracie, her journalist friend Margo, Wang's friend Eddie Lee, and magician Egg Shen, a local authority on mysticism and Lo Pan. They explain to Jack (who only wants his truck back) the ancient knowledge and sorcery the Chinese brought with them to America. The group devises a plan to infiltrate a brothel, where they believe Miao Yin is held. They break in, but are interrupted by the Storms who kidnap Miao Yin, and take her to Lo Pan.\n\nJack and Wang track down the front business used by Lo Pan and impersonate telephone repairmen to gain access, but are quickly subdued by Rain. After being tied up and beaten by Thunder, they meet Lo Pan – however, he now appears as a crippled old man.\n\nWang tells Jack that Lo Pan needs a green-eyed girl to break an ancient curse, and he intends to sacrifice Miao Yin. Centuries ago, Lo Pan was defeated in battle by Emperor Qin Shi Huang. He cursed Lo Pan with incorporeality; although he can be temporarily granted a decrepit body by supplication to the gods, he can permanently break the curse by marrying a woman with green eyes and sacrificing her. Jack and Wang's friends attempt to save them, and are also captured.\n\nAfter getting the drop on Thunder, Jack, Wang, and Eddie escape and free women kept in cells. An orangutan-like Wild-Man recaptures Gracie before she escapes. Lo Pan notes that Gracie has green eyes, too, and decides to sacrifice her while making Miao Yin his wife.\n\nWang and Jack regroup with the Chang Sing and Egg Shen, and enter a cavern to return to Lo Pan's headquarters. Egg pours the group a potent potion. They interrupt the wedding, and start a battle. Wang kills Rain in a sword duel, while Jack and Gracie chase Lo Pan, who has regained his corporeal form by consuming a few drops of Miao Yin's blood. Wang joins them; Lo Pan attempts to kill Jack with a throwing knife, but he catches it and kills him with a throw to his head.\n\nThunder – who had been distracted with Wang – reappears, and, enraged at finding Lo Pan dead, swells up and explodes. Jack, Wang, Gracie, and Miao Yin are cornered by Lightning in a corridor, who triggers a collapse. Egg rescues them with a rope and kills Lightning by dropping a Buddha statue on him when he tries to follow. After finding Jack's truck and dealing with the remaining Wing Kong guards, the group escapes back to Wang's restaurant.\n\nThe group celebrates in the restaurant; Wang and Miao Yin prepare to marry, while Eddie pairs with Margo. Egg sets off to China. Gracie offers to join Jack, but he leaves alone. Unbeknownst to him, the Wild-Man survived the battle and has stowed away on his truck.\n\nAl Leong, Gerald Okamura and Nathan Jung appear as Wing Kong hatchet men. Lia Chang and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa have minor roles as Wing Kong members. Frank Ho, Conan Lee (Uncredited) and James Lew (the film's martial arts choreographer) appear as Chang Sing warriors. Jerry Hardin appears in the beginning of the film as a lawyer.\n\nBig Trouble in Little China originated from a script by first-time screenwriters Gary Goldman and David Z. Weinstein. Goldman had been inspired by a new wave of martial arts films that had \"all sorts of weird actions and special effects, shot against this background of Oriental mysticism and modern sensibilities\",[5] such as The Butterfly Murders; Weinstein, for his part, was fascinated by the historical Tong Wars of 19th-century San Francisco's Chinatown. The duo combined these interests with a shared a fondness for classic westerns to write the first iteration of the screenplay. Entitled Lotus, the script took place in the 1880s: friends cowboy Wiley Prescott and Chinese railroad worker Sun are set to meet Sun's fiancée Lotus as she arrives to San Francisco, but are opposed by sorcerer Lo Pan who captures Sun's fiancée and separates Prescott from his horse as the story progresses into a mystical realm.[6][7] They submitted the script to TAFT Entertainment Pictures executive producers Paul Monash and Keith Barish during the summer of 1982;[7] the script, now renamed Big Trouble in Little China, was soon optioned by 20th Century Fox.[6]\n\nThe Weird West setting of the screenplay led to objections from producers. Monash remembers his issues with the script \"came largely from the fact it was set in turn-of-the-century San Francisco, which affected everything – style, dialogue, action.\" He had Goldman and Weinstein do at least one rewrite, but was still dissatisfied;[7] Goldman rejected a subsequent request by 20th Century Fox for a rewrite that asked for major alterations, angered that the studio wanted to update it to a contemporary setting. The studio then removed the writers from the project[8] and brought in screenwriter and veteran script doctor W. D. Richter (Academy Award-nominated writer of Brubaker) to extensively rewrite the script. Richter modernized the setting to avoid distancing audiences;[7] though basic elements of the story were retained (such as Lo Pan),[9] Richter rewrote much of the story. In particular, he approached the story as a comedy: the straightforward cowboy hero Prescott reimagined as the blowhard trucker Jack Burton.[6] His draft was written in 10 weeks,[10] a process that included research into Chinese mythology. While admitting that he invented or changed some lore, Richter expressed a desire for those portions of the script to be \"as authentic as possible\" despite coming from a white writer, contrasting his approach with modern criticisms of Charlie Chan.[6]\n\nRichter's script was shopped around to directors by the studio.[6] Fox wanted to deny Goldman and Weinstein writing credit, and eliminated their names from press releases[8] in favor of solely crediting Richter.[11] In March 1986, the Writers Guild of America, West determined that \"written by\" credit would go to Goldman and Weinstein, based on the WGA screenwriting credit system which protects original writers;[8][12] Richter would instead receive an \"adaptation by\" credit for his work on the script.[6]\n\nBarish and Monash first offered the project to Carpenter in July 1985, with the idea he would produce an adventure movie in the model of Indiana Jones. He had read the earlier Goldman/Weinstein script,[12] and signed onboard after reading the Richter script.[6] Carpenter made his own additions to Richter's rewrites, which included strengthening the Gracie Law role and linking her to Chinatown, removing a few action sequences due to budgetary restrictions and eliminating material deemed offensive to Chinese Americans. The characters in the film reminded Carpenter of characters in Howard Hawks' Bringing Up Baby or His Girl Friday — \"these are very 1930s, Howard Hawks people,\" — with respect to their rapid-fire delivery of dialogue, especially between Jack Burton and Gracie Law.[9] Richter, who had befriended Carpenter while the two were attending USC film school, found Carpenter's notes built on what had already been established and made his part in the script-editing process easy.[6]\n\nCarpenter had discovered a fondness for Hong Kong action cinema while in film school, with the \"strange, yet bloody and violent and innocent [and] 'what is this exactly?' vibe\" of movies like Five Fingers of Death and Master of the Flying Guillotine providing inspiration.[6] He envisioned the film as an inverse of traditional scenarios in action films that featured a Caucasian protagonist helped by a minority sidekick. In Big Trouble in Little China, Jack Burton, despite his bravado, is constantly portrayed as rather bumbling; in a climactic fight sequence, he knocks himself unconscious before the battle begins. Wang Chi, on the other hand, is constantly portrayed as highly skilled and competent. On a commentary track for the DVD release, Carpenter said the film is really about a sidekick (Burton) who thinks he is a leading man. According to Carpenter, the studio \"didn't get it\"[13] and made him write something that would explain the character of Jack Burton. Carpenter came up with a prologue scene where Egg Shen reassures the audience (vis-à-vis a lawyer character) that \"Jack Burton is a man of courage.\"[14]\n\nProduction of Big Trouble in Little China was partially shaped by its anticipation of competition with Paramount Pictures' upcoming The Golden Child. The two movies share similar themes, both action-comedies following a Californian everyman drawn into a plot centering around Chinese mysticism, and the movies would go on to share many supporting cast members. Furthermore, the potential box-office draw of superstar Eddie Murphy led Fox to fear their movie would lose in a direct competition. To beat the rival production at being released in theaters, Big Trouble went into production in October 1985 so it could open in July 1986, five months before The Golden Child's Christmas release.[15] Carpenter (who had also been offered The Golden Child[15]) was hired by 20th Century Fox because of his reputation for working fast. He was given only 10 weeks of pre-production.[8]\n\nTo compete with The Golden Child's casting of Murphy, Carpenter wanted a big star of his own to portray lead character Jack Burton; both Clint Eastwood and Jack Nicholson were considered, but were unavailable.[12] The studio felt Kurt Russell was an up-and-coming star — additionally, Russell had previously been directed by Carpenter in Elvis, Escape from New York, and The Thing. Russell was initially unsure if he could approach the character in an interesting way,[16] but came around after talking to Carpenter and reading the script a few more times. The nature of the character appealed to Russell, the comedic tone of the script setting Burton apart from a protagonist like Indiana Jones:[17] \"Jack is and isn't the hero. He falls on his ass as much as he comes through. This guy is a real blowhard. He's a lot of hot air, very self-assured, a screw-up\".[16] Russell took inspiration from John Wayne's characters in portraying Burton, albeit heightening the bravado to a comedic level. Carpenter and Russell's familiarity allowed the actor to improvise and explore outside the script during shooting.[6]\n\nThe studio pressured Carpenter to cast a rock star in the role of Gracie Law, Jack Burton's love interest, but Carpenter wanted Kim Cattrall. The studio was not keen on the idea because at the time Cattrall was primarily known for raunchy comedies like Porky's and Police Academy. She was drawn to the film because of the way her character was portrayed. \"I'm not screaming for help the whole time. I think the humor comes out of the situations and my relationship with Jack Burton. I’m the brains and he's the brawn\".[7]\n\nCasting the Asian characters in the movie was approached with care. Year of the Dragon, released 1985, had drawn much controversy for its depiction of Chinese-Americans. Carpenter and producers met with community leaders to assuage concerns about the writing of the movie and hired a casting director who represented many Chinese and Asian-American actors.[6]\n\nDennis Dun was drawn to Big Trouble in Little China as he was a fan of Richter's Buckaroo Banzai.[6] Carpenter was familiar with Dun's role in Year of the Dragon, and met with the actor twice before casting him in the role of Wang Chi only a few days before principal photography.[18] The martial arts sequences were not hard for Dun, who had \"dabbled\" in training as a kid and done Chinese opera as an adult.[18] He was drawn to the portrayal of Asian characters in the movie,[7] appreciating that, like him, Wang was second-generation American and could be portrayed as Chinese yet still \"a regular, American guy\" rather than \"foreign\" as many of Dun's previous roles had made him feel.[6]\n\nKurt Russell lifted weights and began running two months before production began to prepare for the physical demands of principal photography. In addition, Carpenter and his cast and crew did a week's rehearsals that mainly involved choreographing the martial arts scenes.[19]\n\nAlthough the early exterior establishing scenes were filmed on location in Chinatown,[20] most of the film was shot on sets built in the Fox lot in Los Angeles.[21] Production designer John Lloyd designed the elaborate underground sets and recreated Chinatown with three-story buildings, roads, streetlights, sewers and so on. This was necessary for the staging of complicated special effects and kung fu fight sequences that would have been very hard to do on location.[7] This forced the filmmaker to shoot the film in 15 weeks with a $25 million budget. For the film's many fight scenes Carpenter worked with martial arts choreographer James Lew, who planned out every move in advance. Says Carpenter, \"I used every cheap gag – trampolines, wires, reverse movements and upside-down sets. It was much like photographing a dance.\"[12]\n\nCarpenter was not entirely satisfied with Boss Film Studios, the company in charge of the film's visual effects.[11] According to the director, they took on more projects than they could handle and some effects for the film had to be cut down. Richard Edlund, head of Boss Film Studios, said that there were no difficulties with the company's workload and that Big Trouble was probably its favorite film at the time, with the exception of Ghostbusters.[11] The effects budget for the film was just under $2 million, which Edlund said was barely adequate. One of the more difficult effects was the floating eyeball, a spy for Lo-Pan. It was powered by several puppeteers and dozens of cables to control its facial expressions. It was shot with a special matting system specially designed for it.[11] Noble Craig puppeteered a creatured referred to in the script as the \"sewer demon\".[6]\n\nWith the soundtrack, Carpenter wanted to avoid a stereotypically \"Chinese\" sound, as he found that \"other scores for American movies about Chinese characters are basically rinky tink, chop suey music. I didn’t want that for Big Trouble\".[12] Carpenter instead focused on a general fantasy-music feeling with his trademark synthesizer scoring, mixing in rock 'n' roll elements.[6][12] The title theme, \"Pork Chop Express\", was partially inspired by the temp score's use of \"Just Got Paid\" by ZZ Top for the opening scene.[6]\n\nThe theme song \"Big Trouble in Little China\", which plays over the closing credits, was performed by The Coup De Villes — a group consisting of Carpenter alongside friends Tommy Lee Wallace (second-unit director on the film) and Nick Castle. Though all three members appear in the music video, the song was primarily performed by Carpenter excepting backing vocals by Castle.[6]\n\nJohn Carpenter was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Music for this film.[citation needed]\n\nOpening in 1,053 theaters on July 2, 1986, Big Trouble in Little China grossed $2.7 million in its opening weekend and went on to gross $11.1 million in North America,[22] well below its estimated budget of $19–25 million, making it a box-office bomb.[2] The film was released in the midst of the hype for James Cameron's blockbuster Aliens, which was released 16 days after. On the DVD commentary for Big Trouble in Little China, Carpenter and Russell discuss this among possible reasons for the film's disappointing box office gross.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 74% based on 65 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Brimming with energy and packed with humor, Big Trouble in Little China distills kung fu B-movies as affectionately as it subverts them.\"[23] On Metacritic it has a score of 53% based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[24] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \"B+\" on scale of A to F.[25]\n\nRon Base, in his review for the Toronto Star, praised Russell's performance. \"He does a great John Wayne imitation. But he's not just mimicking these heroes, he is using them to give his own character a broad, satiric edge.\"[26] Walter Goodman in The New York Times wrote, \"In kidding the flavorsome proceedings even as he gets the juice out of them, the director, John Carpenter, is conspicuously with it.\"[27] Writer Harlan Ellison, widely known in Hollywood for his brutally honest critiques, praised the film, writing that it had \"some of the funniest lines spoken by any actor this year to produce a cheerfully blathering live-action cartoon that will give you release from the real pressures of your basically dreary lives.\"[28] In his review for Time, Richard Corliss wrote, \"Little China offers dollops of entertainment, but it is so stocked with canny references to other pictures that it suggests a master's thesis that moves.\"[29]\n\nHowever, in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert wrote, \"special effects don't mean much unless we care about the characters who are surrounded by them, and in this movie the characters often seem to exist only to fill up the foregrounds,\" and felt that it was \"straight out of the era of Charlie Chan and Fu Manchu, with no apologies and all of the usual stereotypes.\"[30] Paul Attanasio, in The Washington Post, criticized the screenwriters for being \"much better at introducing a character than they are at developing one\".[31] David Ansen wrote, in his review for Newsweek, \"though it is action packed, spectacularly edited and often quite funny, one can't help feeling that Carpenter is squeezing the last drops out of a fatigued genre.\"[32] In his review for The Times, David Robinson felt that Carpenter was \"overwhelmed by his own special effects, without a strong enough script to guide him.\"[33]\n\nAlex Stewart reviewed Big Trouble in Little China for White Dwarf No. 83, and stated that the film was \"Amiable nonsense, delivered with panache by fearsome demons and flying swordsmen; and the jokes work. Wayne Crawford should take notes.\"[34]\n\nAfter the commercial and critical failure of the film, Carpenter became very disillusioned with Hollywood and became an independent filmmaker.[35] He said in an interview, \"The experience [of Big Trouble] was the reason I stopped making movies for the Hollywood studios. I won't work for them again. I think Big Trouble is a wonderful film, and I'm very proud of it. But the reception it received, and the reasons for that reception, were too much for me to deal with. I'm too old for that sort of bullshit.\"[36]\n\nIt has since enjoyed a resurgence on television and home video, and has received a good deal of retroactive positive press. Some critics and fans considered it one of Carpenter's best movies.[37] Empire magazine voted Big Trouble in Little China the 430th greatest film in their \"500 Greatest Movies of All Time\" list.[38][39][40][41]\n\nBig Trouble in Little China was released on a two-disc special edition DVD set on May 22, 2001. Entertainment Weekly gave the DVD a \"B+\" rating and wrote, \"The highlight of this two disc set – which also features deleted scenes, an extended ending, trailers, and a 1986 featurette – is the pitch perfect Russell and Carpenter commentary, which delves into Fox's marketing mishaps, Chinese history, and how Russell's son did in his hockey game.\"[42] In his review for the Onion A.V. Club, Noel Murray wrote, \"If nothing else, this is a DVD designed for Big Trouble cultists; it's packed with articles from Cinefex and American Cinematographer that only a genre geek would appreciate.\"[43]\n\nA single-disc movie-only DVD version was later released, with the only special features being the Carpenter/Russell commentary and the theatrical trailer.\n\nA Blu-ray Disc edition of the film was released on August 4, 2009. It contains the same content as the double-disc DVD release. In 2013, the film was released on Blu-ray Disc in the United Kingdom by Arrow Films as a regular case and Steelbook.\n\nOn December 3, 2019, Scream Factory released a two-disc \"Collector's Edition\" Blu-ray of the film in the U.S., which included a bevy of new bonus features.[44]\n\nIn June 2015, TheWrap reported that Dwayne Johnson was developing a remake to be produced under his Seven Bucks Productions film studio. Ashley Miller and Zack Stentz were hired as screenwriters, with Johnson planned to star as Burton.[45] Though Johnson expressed interest in having Carpenter involved in the film;[46] Carpenter remained \"ambivalent\" about a remake and did not meet with Johnson.[47] By 2018, Seven Bucks was instead developing the film to be a sequel rather than a remake.[48] In a 2019 interview, screenwriter Stentz explained that his script had been for a remake and he had not been contacted about the film's revised concept; he was unaware of any new scripts being commissioned and also suspected that the then-recent acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney had placed the project into limbo.[49]\n\nA tie-in video game of the same name was published in 1986 by Electric Dreams Software for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC. Critical reception was mixed.[50]\n\nOn February 27, 2014, Boom! Studios announced they were working on a comic book series.[51] The comic book is written by Eric Powell and John Carpenter with artwork by Brian Churilla. The series began in June 2014.[52]\n\nBoom! released a crossover limited series between Jack Burton and Snake Plissken titled Big Trouble in Little China/Escape from New York in October 2016.[53]\n\nA previously projected comic book series previewed by Top Cow Productions at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con failed to appear.[54]\n\nOn June 14, 2017, Boom! announced a new four-issue limited series, to be published in September 2017, called Big Trouble in Little China: Old Man Jack, written by Carpenter and Anthony Burch, with art by Jorge Corona. Taking place in 2020, Jack Burton comes out of retirement to battle Ching Dai and save the world.[55][56]\n\nIn February 2015, Funko released a line of ReAction and Pop! vinyl figures based on Big Trouble in Little China.[57]\n\nOn July 15, 2016, Boom! Studios announced a partnership with Everything Epic and Flipside to create a board game based on the film. It was released in 2018, and is a highly thematic cooperative miniatures board game for 1–4 players.[58][59]\n\nIn August 2016, Upper Deck released the Legendary: Big Trouble in Little China deck-building card game. It is a semi-cooperative game for 2–5 players using the deck-building mechanic in which players purchase cards from a central pool to work together against the \"villain\" deck. The cards feature original artwork based on characters from the movie. It comes with 400 cards and a special playmat, and retails for around $40.[60]\n\nMarvel supervillain The Mandarin in the 1990s Iron Man comic run by John Byrne and John Romita Jr. was modeled in appearance after Lo Pan.\n\nThe film's portrayal of the lightning sorcerer/demigod character has been occasionally described as an inspiration for the character of Raiden from Mortal Kombat, introducing the archetype of a straw hat–wearing monk able to control lightning with his hands to non-Asian audiences (in traditional Chinese and Japanese culture, the lightning god has an appearance more similar to that of a traditional Asian creature). Additionally, the character David Lo Pan has been credited as the original inspiration for the soul-stealing Mortal Kombat villain Shang Tsung.\n\nThe twenty-third episode of the second season of the 2012 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles TV series, \"A Chinatown Ghost Story,\" uses concepts from the film, but renames the antagonist Lo Pan to Ho Chan and replaces the Storm figure Rain with Wind. In addition, James Hong (Lo Pan) reprises his Little China performance as the principal villain character.\n\nThe song \"We Have Candy\" by the South African rap-rave group Die Antwoord features lead singer Ninja reciting some of Jack Burton's dialogue from the film.\n\nIn 2006, American experimental rock band Man Man released an album with the title Six Demon Bag, which is a reference to a line in the film.\n\nA 2012 parody music video of the song \"Gangnam Style\" was entitled Lo Pan Style [61] and featured the storyline and characters from the movie, including a cameo by James Hong.\n\nNew Zealand director Taika Waititi cited the film as an influence on Thor: Ragnarok (2017).[62]\n\nThe Regular Show season 3 episode \"Fortune Cookie\" features a villain called The Warlock, who bears a resemblance to Lo Pan; he also played by James Hong.\n\nThe title of the Rick and Morty season 2 episode \"Big Trouble in Little Sanchez\" is a reference to the film.[citation needed]\n\nIn the Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja season 2 episode \"Big Trouble in Little Norrisville,\" the titular place is a reference to Little Chinatown (the title of the episode also references the film). James Hong (who played Lo Pan) also provides a guest voice role as the Shopkeeper.\n\nThe American hard rock band Lo-Pan is named after Hong's character in the movie.[63]\n\nList of cult films\n\nList of martial arts films"
