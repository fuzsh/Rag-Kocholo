His henchman, the main antagonist of the film, Mr. Benedict hates him and kills him, and he finally takes over his entire villa, and going out to kill Jack Slater and Danny. He is also responsible to the death of Slater's cousin Frank. In the police of LA, John Practice helps Benedict but gets killed by Slater after Danny's arrival to the movie. Around the end of the movie, Benedict came to his (Vivaldi's) swimming pool and pulled out his gun, shooting Vivaldi who died, and took over his house.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nBeing in a typical action flick, Vivaldi is your average Saturday morning cartoonish villain: Greedy, diabolical, cruel, but has a slightly comical side. He is also shown to act pretty impatient at times and be somewhat playful, in his own horrible ways of course, such as joking about getting Slater's cousin cooked.\n\nGallery[]\n\nTBA\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHe has the habit of messing up maxims (e.g. \"You've gone 360 on me,\" instead of 180), which is to the great chagrin of Mr. Benedict, who corrects him under his breath."
