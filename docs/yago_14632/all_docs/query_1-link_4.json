        "text": "Citation preview\n\nSubvers\n\nArt\n\nAmos Vogel\n\n$15.00 From its beginning, the cinema has been a major target of censors, the state, and traditionalists afraid of its powerful impact, especially when manipulated by aesthetic and ideological innovators and rebels. As a result, public cinema has often found it difficult to display openly some of man’s most fundamental experiences. Today, however, neither fear nor repression seem able to stem an accelerating world-wide trend toward a more liberated cinema, in which subjects and forms hitherto considered unthinkable or forbidden are boldly explored. The attack on the visual taboo and its demystification by open display is profoundly subversive, for it strikes at prevailing concepts of morality and religion and thereby at law and order itself. Equally subversive is the destruction of old cinematic forms and ‘‘immutable”’ rules by new approaches to narrative style, camera work, and editing.\n\nAmos Vogel places this subversion of content and form within the context of the contemporary world view of science, philosophy, and politics. The aesthetic, sexual, and political subversives of the cinema are introduced to the reader as catalysts of social and intellectual change. There are special chapters on Nazi propaganda, the early Soviet Russian avantgarde, expressionism, surrealism, the counterculture, and the “forbidden subjects” of cinema (sex, birth, death, blasphemy). Also analyzed are the massive assaults on narrative, time, and space in modern cinema and the effectiveness and containment of filmic subversion.\n\nEach chapter focuses on a major aspect of this movement and is followed by a detailed examination of representative films; these include many banned or rarely seen works. The text is rounded out with more than three hundred rare stills accompanied by unique, detailed captions designed to invite their close “‘visual reading”. Amos Vogel has drawn on the experience of twenty-five years in film, exhaustive international research, and personal archives of over 20,000 titles and stills to produce a thought-provoking, controversial\n\nwork that deals with areas of film rarely covered by standard histories and is simultaneously designed to test the limits of each reader’s tolerance as well.\n\nDigitized by the Internet Archive in 2022 with funding from Kahle/Austin Foundation\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/filmassubversive0Q000voge\n\nFilmasa Subversive Art\n\n‘But that the white eye-lid of the screen reflect its proper light, the Universe would go wpm flames.’ Luis Bufiuel\n\nFilm asa Subversive Art Amos Vogel\n\nRandom\n\nHouse a\n\nNew York\n\nAUTHOR’S\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nIn various secret and endless ways, the following friends helped make this work a reality: Rudolf Arnheim, David Bienstock, Luis Bunuel, Fabiano Canossa, Carlos Clarens, Mary Corliss of the Museum of Modern Art Stills Archive, Gary Crowdus of Tricontinental Film Center, Andy Angel of Politkino, Kate Frankenthal, Jack Goelman, Erica and Ulrich Gregor, John Handthardt, Nick Hart-Williams of The Other Cinema, Karlheinz Heinz of PAP Film Galleries, Martje and Werner Herzog, Derek Hill, Hilmar Hoffman, Wolfgang Klaue and Manfred Lichenstein of the Film Archive of the German Democratic Republic, John Kobal, John B.

This book is an approximation of a draft of a first edition; in short, a hint (to the wise). 2. A still is not a film. It lacks the dimensions of time and movement — indispensable components of film art — and represents only a small fraction of a single second of a given motion picture.\n\n3. Words are not the best way to deal with a visual medium.\n\nThe Film Experience\n\nThis is a book about the subversion of existing values, institutions, mores, and taboos — East and West, Left and Right — by the potentially most powerful art of the century. It is a book that trafficks in scepticism towards all received wisdom (including its own), towards eternal truths, rules of art, ‘natural’ and man-made laws, indeed whatever may be considered holy. It is an attempt to preserve for a fleeting\n\nmoment in time — the life of this book — the works and achievements of the subversives of film. Subversion in cinema starts when the theatre darkens and the screen lights up. For the cinema is a place of magic where psychological and environmental factors combine to create an openness to wonder and suggestion, an unlocking of the unconscious. It is a shrine at which modern rituals rooted in atavistic memories and subconscious desires are acted out in darkness and seclusion from the outer world. The power of the image, our fear of it, the\n\nthrill that pulls us toward it, is real. Short of closing one’s eyes — in cinema, a difficult and unprecedented act — there is no defence against it. When Lumiére’s immortal train first pulled into that station in 1895, moving directly towards the camera, the audience shrieked. It did so again when Bufiuel sliced a woman’s eyeball with a razor, when Clouzot quite literally made the dead return, when Hitchcock committed sudden murder in a shower, Franju killed animals before its eyes. The audience fainted during films of operations, vomited during birth sequences, rose in spon-\n\ntaneous enthusiasm at propaganda films, wept while the heroine died protractedly from leukemia, shouted with delicious anxiety during Cinerama’s rollercoaster ride, and even felt twinges of concern at being exposed to screen cholera. In the light of these manifest responses, why assume that the countless\n\nother fantasies dreamt in silence in the cinemas of the world during the last seventy years — fantasies of lust, violence, ambition, perversion, crime and romantic love — were any less powerful? ‘It is at the movies that the only absolutely modern\n\nmystery\n\nis celebrated’,\n\nsaid André\n\nBreton.' It is appropriate that it was a surrealist who so well expressed the curious combination of technology and metaphysics ' that is cinema; for modern science’s realiza-\n\ntion of a continuum from the rational to the irrational relates directly to the very nature of the film-viewing process. This entails a darkened theatre, greater openness to suggestion, the semi-hypnotic trance of the viewer, the surfacing of deeper desires and anxieties, and the inhibition of reasoned response in favour of ‘gut-level’ reaction. Far from representing a defeat in man’s struggle toward consciousness, the acceptance of this\n\ninevitable duality (the flowing into each other of rationalism and irrationality) is itself a step toward the future. The mechanics of the film-viewing process have been discussed by Mauerhofer, Kracauer,\n\nStephenson-Debrix\n\nand\n\nothers,’\n\nthough a comprehensive analysis remains to be undertaken. The viewer enters the theatre willingly, if not eagerly, ready for surrender, (and deeply dissatisfied later if the film is ‘bad’ and the illusion does not ‘work’). The film experience requires total darkness; the viewer must not be distracted from the bright rectangle from which huge shapes impinge on him. Unlike the low-pressure television experience (during which the viewer remains aware of room environment and other people, aided by appropriately named ‘breaks’), the film experience\n\nis total, isolating, hallucina-\n\ntory. The viewer ‘forgets’ where or who he is and is offended by stray light, street or audience noises which destroy the anticipated,\n\naccepted illusion.\n\nFilm Experience\n\nAs soon as the lights are lowered, the huge rectangle of the screen — previously noted without interest — becomes the viewer’s total universe. What transpires here in bursts of light and darkness is accepted as life; the images reach out to him; he enters them. The many mysteries of film begin at this moment; the acceptance of a flat surface as three-dimensional,\n\nof sudden action-, scale-\n\nor set-changes as ordinary, of a border delimiting this fraudulent universe as normal, of black-and-white as reality. The spectator, Rudolf Arnheim points out,3 experiences no\n\nshock at finding a world in which depth perception has been altered, sizes and distances flattened and the sky is the same colour as the human face.\n\nBut the mysteries are only beginning. The very darkness enveloping the viewer is more complete than he realizes; for the essence of cinema is not light, but a secret compact between light and darkness. Half of all the time at the movies is spent by the transfixed victims of this technological art in complete darkness. There is no image on the screen at all. In the course ofa single second, forty-eight periods of darkness follow forty-eight periods of light. During this same infinitesimal period, every\n\nimage is shown to the audience twice; and as a still photograph; for the film comes to a dead stop in the projector forty-eight times in the course of a single second. Given the retina’s inability to adjust quickly to differences in brightness, an illusion of movement is created by this rapid, stop-start series projection of still photographs, each slightly different from the one before. Thus, during half the time spent at the movies, the viewer sees no picture at all; and\n\nat no time is there any movement. Without the viewer’s physiological and psychological complicity, the cinema could not exist. The ‘illusion’ of film — so platitudinously invoked by journalists — is thus revealed as a far more intricate web of deception, involving the very technology of the film process and the nature of its victim’s perceptions. Could it be precisely during the periods of total darkness — 45 out of every 90 minutes of film\n\n10\n\nwe see — that our voracious subconscious, newly nourished by yet another provocative image, ‘absorbs’ the work’s deeper meaning and sets off chains of associations? It is in this alien environment that the viewer willingly permits himself to be invaded by strong images, created and manipulated by a director-magician who entirely controls his vision. True, all vision, even undirected, is dynamic, and reflects, as Arnheim emphasizes, an invasion of the organism by external forces which upset the balance of the nervous system.* But while in daily life the viewer can shift his focus of attention as he wishes (without losing a sense of continuity regarding his surroundings), in cinema his attention is ‘riveted’ on a pre-ordained succession of images, whose nature, tempo, sequence, and duration have been carefully constructed for maximum impact by a third party. Removed from the real world, isolated even from fellow-viewers, the spectator falls to dream and reverie in the womb-like darkness of the theatre. Flooded by images, his unconscious is freed from customary constraints and his rational faculties are inhibited. Stephenson and Debrix point out that except for seeing and hearing, body and other senses are at rest in the cinema, thus allowing imagination, stimulated by the filmmaker’s emotionally charged, expressly-selected material, to exert deeper and more lasting influence. Mauerhofer refers to the viewer’s voluntary passivity and uncritical receptivity; and Kracauer emphasizes the dialectical wavering between self-absorption (leading the viewer away from the image, into personal associations triggered by it) and self-abandonment (the movement toward the image). Perhaps the state of the viewer (as Mauerhofer, the psychologist, and Breton, the surrealist, both agree) is closest to that between waking and sleeping, in which he abandons the rationality of daily life while not yet completely surrendering to his unconscious. And the image is powerful; he cannot turn from it. For man, perhaps in response to an atavistic memory of fear or child-like joy, cannot resist the attraction of movement\n\nThe Film Experience\n\n(when he enters a room or cinema, his eyes are inevitably drawn to the moving shapes). He cannot ‘resist’ the shocking changes caused by editing, the sudden intrusions of shapes into the frame, the cascading bursts of images flashing by at a rate faster than life, the sensuous power of the close-up looming over him. It is so much easier to turn from the action in a live play. Here the spectator has accepted its unreality (just as he accepted the film’s ‘reality’) and since he knows it cannot ‘reach out’ and attack him, he never flinches from stage as he does from screen violence. In both cases, the murdered man rises to be killed another time; but cinema is ‘closer’ to the viewer — strange tribute to the faculties of a brain more affected by two-dimensional reflections on flat canvas than by live actors performing in three-dimensional space. And it is a tribute to the power of visuals\n\nThis magical invocation of concrete images that seemingly reflect reality while actually distorting it, sets up additional tension between film and spectator; it increases his sense of dislocation and disquiet and permits further inroads into his ever more vulnerable subconscious. It is the powerful impact of these brightlylit images moving in black space and artificial time, their affinity to trance and the subconscious, and their ability to influence masses and jump boundaries, that has forever made the cinema an appropriate target of the repressive forces in society — censors, traditionalists, the state. While the result has often been its inability openly to project fundamental human experiences or insights, neither repression nor fear seem able to stem an accelerating, world-wide trend towards a\n\nas such.

Their transmutation into art does not seem to diminish the images’ impact. As holy today as in man’s pre-history, the image is accepted as if it were life, reality,\n\ntruth. It is accepted on a feeling- rather than mind-level. Significantly, it is only if the ‘suspension of disbelief? is broken by dissatisfaction with a given film that the viewer emerges from his hypnotized state. And yet, however ‘authentic’ the image, it remains a distortion of life. Not only does it lack depth or density, the space-time continuum, or the non-selectivity of reality, but it emphasizes certain aspects to the exclusion of others by isolating them within a fixed frame in a constantly evolving concatenation\n\nof blacks and whites, objects and ground.\n\nmore\n\nliberated\n\ncinema,\n\none\n\nin which\n\nall\n\nREFERENCES: (1) André Breton, quoted in J.H.Matthews, Surrealism and Film, Ann Arbor, University of Michigan Press, 1971, p. 2.

In order to understand the subversion of modern cinema, we must go not merely beyond film but beyond art and explore the evolution of the contemporary world view. This constitutes the inevitable matrix within which the artist’s creativity and originality operate.\n\nThe Natural Sciences The twentieth century has brought renewed questioning of the nature of the ‘objective’ world. We do not know what the next hundred years will bring, but we do know that that nineteenth-century notions of reality and science represent a stage of human development already superseded. We now understand that absolute truth is an unachievable goal. Quantum physics and the theory of relativity have transformed ‘cause’ and ‘effect’? into statistical probabilities. Instead of reliance on a so-called ‘objective’ world picture, we\n\nnow\n\nstress the\n\nsubjective nature of all experience (only God, said Robbe-Grillet, can claim to be objective). Our ‘knowledge’ of the world first comes to us through our senses, and these are primitive, deceptive, and limited. Though this was already recognized by the early Greek philosophers,' it is only in our time that the split between perception and cognition has become so shatteringly evident. The ‘solid’ objects surrounding us are, we now know, but swirling masses of electrons, protons, neutrons, and sub-atomic particles: smell, sound, colour, and taste are not inherent in these objects but exist only relative to the observer; and mass and energy are equivalent and transformable, as we learned at Hiroshima. What we know of the world comes to us primarily through vision. Our eyes, however, are sensitive only to that segment of the spectrum located between red and violet; the remaining 95 per cent of all existing light\n\n2.\n\n(cosmic, infra-red, ultra-violet, gamma, and X-rays) we cannot see. This means that we only perceive 5 per cent of the ‘real’ world; and that even if we supplement our primitive vision with our equally primitive senses of hearing, smell and touch, we are neither able to know everything nor even realize the extent of our ignorance.? P.W.Bridgman points out that ‘there are so many phenomena beyond the range of our senses that the world of modern physics has become predominantly the world of instruments’. Hence, what we refer to as reality, is only a partial and distorted vision of the ‘real’ world. Recent experiments conducted by Robert Livingston at the Brain Research Laboratory of the University of California offer clear evidence that man rearranges his view of the world to conform to his experience and that different people literally ‘see’ different worlds.4 To the modern scientist, ‘reality’ is colourless, soundless, featureless, and impalpable — a construct\n\nof mathematical\n\nsymbols,\n\nbased\n\non the mysterious unity of space and time, mass and energy, matter and field. Gravitation, electromagnetism, energy, and atom are\n\n“ Reality can no longer be apprehended by the ‘naked eye’; the truth hides in the shadows. A seemingly innocent photograph of two /overs in an empty park slowly yields — in /ts dot configurations — a truth not previously apparent: a corpse. To reveal the dirty secret, three levels of created reality\n\nare necessary, all involved with vision. the (photographed) photographer, the picture he and we view; and the detail discovered only by the magnifying glass. (Michelangelo Antonioni, Blow Up, Great Britain, 1966) bAntonioni’s entire work projects visual metaphors of non-communication,\n\nalienation, solitude — and desperate\n\nattempts to break through to others. But man is overpowered by objects, structures, and the physical world; and people rarely face each other except in tension. (Michelangelo Antonioni, The Eclipse, France//taly, 1962, see p. 23)\n\nWorld View\n\nrevealed as theoretical metaphors, constructed to help man grasp an underlying reality which his sense organs do not otherwise allow him to picture.’ Hence the order we so happily perceive in the cosmos is no more than a reflection of the structure of our minds. It is therefore possible to question — without resort to religion — whether we shall ever fully ‘know’ the objective world. The contemporary answer — as always subject to revision — remains unassuring. To the fifty leading scientists and scholars attending a 1972 symposium at the Institute of Advanced Studies\n\nat Princeton,\n\nit seemed\n\n‘that\n\nthe\n\npossibility of understanding all of nature — which is after all, the loftiest goal of all science — was in question because, through the computer, many disciplines have discovered hitherto unknown strange phenomena. The nineteenth-century hope that just a little more investigation would reveal the ultimate truths about the workings of the natural world is now virtually gone. Each layer of the onion that is removed reveals not the irreducible core but yet another layer.° We do have more theoretical knowledge than ever before; but as we learn more about structures of underlying reality, we confront growing complexity instead of simplicity and add more to the unknown than to the known. Every solved mystery of the physical world immediately points to another one beyond it.7 (There is no need to invoke the supernatural ; the processes of science — the unravelling of mysteries — are as eternal as the universe.) Finally, our inevitable ‘presence’ in nature compromises our necessary scientific objectivity; protagonists and observers, we are what we attempt to observe. * Werner Heisenberg’s ‘principle of indeterminacy’ (1927) seems to introduce a further, perhaps ultimate barrier to our attaining knowledge of the world; it is impossible to observe atomic events without changing them in the process. The high-frequency gamma light rays — the only possible light source — damage the electron during observation, preventing us from ever determining its position or velocity. We are ‘in the position of a blind man trying to discern the shape and texture\n\n14\n\nof a snowflake — as soon as it touches his fingers or his tongue, it dissolves’.» The investigation of the most basic particles of the universe therefore can never lead to certainty but only to probability — a fundamental revision of man’s cognitive methodology. Einstein has revealed a universe in which space and time are relative. The incessant movements of bodies in space can be described only in relation to other bodies, for in space there are no directions or boundaries. Absolute time does not exist; time is only a form of perception and requires an observer. An hour or a day is nothing without an event to mark it and nothing without an observer to observe it. Space is thus simply a possible series of material objects and time a possible order of real events.'° Time and space represent a ‘continuum’ ; to think of them as separate is arbitrary. Inextricably one, they eternally ‘flow’ into each other, compromising such rickety human constructs as beginning, end, past, and future.\n\n“The only definite location of ‘“‘now” is “‘here’’. In fact, every man’s “now is here’ “the “there” meaning where he 1s).’*! All reality exists in both space and time; all measurement in time is really a measurement in space and vice versa. Looking through one of our large telescopes means looking not only into space but also ‘into time’ — the unbelievably distant past (at present, up to 500 million years ‘back’). 12 Einstein’s universe is incomprehensible to ‘common sense’. It is a universe in which straight lines do not exist, only great circles. It is a finite, yet unbounded universe, curved back into itself; an expanding universe, filled with galaxies that hurtle away from us at 35,000 miles per second. '3 And there are other universes. To be a scientific rationalist in the twentieth century means to acknowledge that most irrational\n\nand real universe inhabited by man: his own subconscious. With Freud and those beyond him we are only beginning to unravel the laws governing the demonic ambiguities and incalculable ambivalences of human character, motives and relations. Since Einstein, we have\n\ncontinued\n\nto\n\nait\n\n“The upper class ‘as if immobilized; perfectly groomed, well/-bred puppets,\n\napplauding an invisible spectacle,\n\ncasting ominous shadows... background to Resnais’ intricate web of memory and desire set in a total time—space continuum.

No explanation exists as yet as to their nature or source of enormous energy. Processes unknown to contemporary science may be at work, for a single quasar is brighter than an entire galaxy (i.e. a millionmillion stars) while its mass is estimated at one hundred million times the size of the sun. Increasing evidence for the existence of neutron stars (super-dense dead stars weigh-\n\n‘\n\nZ\n\nseat\n\nOS\n\nPee\n\n7\n\n5\n\ning ten billion tons per cubic inch), of objects moving faster than light (hitherto considered an impossibility), and of ‘black holes’ (invisible objects of tremendous density and miniscule radius) raise the question whether natural laws as presently understood are ‘sufficient’ to other regions of time and space. Calamities have befallen man’s view of his role in the universe. Our forefathers rested content in the knowledge that the earth was the centre of the universe. Under scientific duress they uneasily shifted this centre to the sun. But today, in Shapley’s beautiful phrase, it is ‘necessary to write the obituary of anthropocentrism altogether. For now we know that our sun is a simple, very ordinary star, one of billions (100,000 million like it exist in our own galaxy alone). Our entire solar system,\n\nof which\n\nthe sun\n\nis the proud\n\ncentre, has been relegated to the position ofa small glob at the edge of one ordinary galaxy out of billions.\n\nHD\n\nIs man unique perhaps because he is alive? To imagine that life would arise on only one ridiculous planet in the sublime expanses of the universe is in itself a monstrous anthropocentric conceit. Life can and must arise on any planet illuminated by a star on which certain conditions in the evolution of gases and liquids combine properly. In 1953, Stanley Miller, in a celebrated experiment at the University of Chicago, synthesized amino acids, the basic constituents of living matter, by subjecting hydrogen gas, ammonia, methane, and water — the primeval atmosphere of earth — to an electric discharge. Since all galaxies are similar in composition, there is a very high probability that there may exist billions of planets on which life is possible. '+ We have no reason to assume that these planets, if inhabited, are at or near our level of civilization; after all, if the entire life\n\n16\n\nspan of earth is represented by a clockface, » man appears in all his splendour approximately one second before midnight. Since the average life span of a planet is in the billions of years while — as in our case — the change from a primitive into a highly technological society can take place in the brief space of two centuries, the chances of other civilizations being at different stages of development are enormous. The recent discovery of seemingly artificial energy emissions from small well-defined areas and of infra-red objects of extraordinary intensity, invisible to the eye, have once again reminded astronomers of the possibility that highly technological societies may exist elsewhere in the heavens.'5\n\nBut however ‘frequent’ life may be in the cosmos, it is also tenuous; only one twobillionth part of the radiation of one minor\n\nWorld View\n\n4 Inside the spaceship earthly truths no longer hold. The positioning’ of the figure is fully explicable and ‘scientific’: the resulting visual shock is not and opens us to a sense of cosmic consciousness. (Stanley Kubrick, 2001, Great\n\nBritain, 1968)\n\nother, to drift gropingly about for a few instants of cosmic time before they were extinguished.'®\n\nPerhaps, then, we must take heart and in an outburst of proud humility, recognize ourselves for what we are in the cosmos: primi-\n\ntive, peripheral, temporal; late arrivals, with a stubborn drive towards great achievement and spectacular evil, struggling to make ends meet in a barely noticeable location in an ordinary island galaxy. And perhaps the cosmos itself is merely an atom in some unimaginable super-universe and electrons the galaxies of microscopic worlds below the realm of comprehension. But in losing our exalted, God-like position in the universe — a position based on ignorance— we are now at last given the opportunity to realize ourselves as part of nature and the cosmos.\n\nstar constitutes the difference between our world civilization (Beethoven, Christ, Hitler) and nothingness, not to speak of our newly developed capability to destroy all life on earth within seconds of nuclear war. There is no evidence that the life expectancy of technologically advanced societies with nuclear capabilities exceeds a few decades: the explosion in the sky looks like any other stellar catastrophe, ironically reaching other civilizations hundreds of thousands of years later as an impenetrable message instead of as a warning. It is symptomatic that Macbeth’s soliloquy on the insignificance of human life has in our century been transposed into a cosmic plaint in Olaf Stapleton’s legendary science-fiction novel The Starmaker, with its journeys to untold numbers of cosmic civilizations: In every one of these worlds, thousands of millions of persons were flashing into existence, one after the\n\nThere can be no better laboratory for the elaboration of thoughts on man’s orientation in a complex world than a flowing meadow or a noisy brook or a spiral galaxy. For the green leaves of the meadow are sucklings of a star’s radiation.

The 100-ton maple tree that calmly dreams through the decades is in the same universe as the Andromeda Galaxy with its billions of seething stars. The tree heeds the impulses of gravitation according to the same rules as those subscribed to by the stars in a globular cluster.\n\nFurther,\n\nthe\n\ntree\n\nis made\n\ncomplex molecular aggregates its branches,\n\nthe\n\nparasites\n\non\n\nof the\n\nsame\n\nas are the birds in its roots,\n\nand\n\nthe\n\nphilosophers who wonder about it.'7\n\nA New God? Faced with the immensity of the cosmos and its mysteries, scientists experience a sense of\n\nawe which offers them a dialectic synthesis between rejection of a personal Earth-God and acceptance of the ice-cold, unapproach-\n\n1\n\nWorld View\n\nable new deity of space. Einstein expresses this most succinctly: The most beautiful and most profound emotion we can experience is the sensation of the mystical. It is the source of all true science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead. To know that what is impenetrable really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their most primitive forms — this knowledge, this feeling is at the centre of true religiousness. In this sense only am I a religious man.'8§ My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable super spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble minds. That deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power, which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe, forms my idea of God.9\n\nIt is fascinating that one of the greatest scientists here invokes ‘the impenetrable’ and ‘the incomprehensible’, two notions presumably at odds with the scientific spirit for which no ultimate mysteries exist. But they are also at odds with our age-old concepts of a personal God. As the scope of His presumed kingdom has been revealed to encompass the infinite reaches of the cosmos, it seems ever more presumptuous to believe in the efficacy of personal prayer or in the appearance of His son on one planet. And Auschwitz, Hiroshima, and Vietnam pose the\n\npossibility of a God who is neither benevolent nor omnipotent, but too subtle or cosmically\n\ntoo preoccupied to concern himself with one tiny planet. But even if we substitute ‘nature’ for ‘God’, we are left with a series of presently or, given our limited sense organs, perhaps eternally unanswerable questions: where did matter ‘originally’ come from? And space? If the universe is curved back into itself, what is the\n\nnature of the space ‘beyond’ it? What are its boundaries? We are confronted with the ironic dilemma ofpostulating two hypotheses, equally untenable for human minds; a universe of infinite duration or one that ‘ends’, with no explanation as to what happens to empty space thereafter.\n\n18\n\nPhilosophy, Politics, Psychology If in our century the modern world view has undergone fundamental transformations in cosmology and science, the same is true of politics, philosophy and psychology. For we have been confronted not merely with the break-up of empires, the decline of Christianity, the horror of two world wars, and the rise\n\nof a new barbarism in the technologically most advanced European nation, but also with the betrayal of the first Communist revolution, the philosophical crisis posed by concentration camps and atomic weapons, and the decline of Western hegemony and of bourgeois civilization. The rise of Marxism as a methodology of social science has introduced the notions of relativity and historicity into ‘the very concept of society itself, positing change as the only constant. And the realities of Hiroshima and Vietnam constitute the end of the myth that other nations are less capable of genocide than was Hitler’s Germany. Indeed, America has updated the concept to encompass the destruction of entire countries. In terms of the collective unconscious of mankind, the result of these developments is a crisis of uncertainty and impermanence, a total questioning, if not destruction, of all values. The humiliations suffered by man at the hands of modern science and the possibility of impenetrable mystery have led to a search for meaning in a world which has none except that which we are able to give it. It is now clear that no masterplan exists for the cosmos, no prior intention, no inevitable progress, no pre-ordained harmony between man and universe. And the cosmos is meaning-less not only for us. Even more unfathomable, this monstrous, splendid construct of circling, radiating, exploding, expanding masses of matter embodied in a matrix of emptiness, carries no meaning for itself as well; it merely is. Were all life to cease, it would continue in\n\nits cycles unobserved. To Nobel-prizewinner\n\nJacques\n\nthe\n\nsuch\n\nscientific\n\nbasis\n\nfor\n\nMonod,\n\nphilosophy\n\nresides in recent discoveries about basic organic matter. These demonstrate that life is the product of chance and necessity,\n\nWorld View\n\nthus abolishing the possibility of religious or other systems that assume a masterplan of creation. Armed with all the powers, enjoying all the wealth they owe to science, our societies are still trying to practice and to teach systems of value already destroyed at the roots by that very science. Man knows at last that he is alone in the indifferent immensity of the universe, whence he has emerged by chance. His duty, like his fate, is written nowhere. It is for him to choose between the kingdom and the darkness.?°\n\nMan has no divine or secular right to the world. Instead, between birth and death, he is forced into an adventure for which no happy end is guaranteed.\n\nThis is what, in Camus’\n\nview, transforms Sisyphus’ unceasing, doomed attempt to push the rock up the mountain from punishment into challenge. This\n\nuniverse,\n\nhenceforth\n\nwithout\n\na master,\n\nseems to him neither sterile nor futile. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart.?!\n\nThis bleak ‘optimism’ of existentialism is even more clearly conveyed by RobbeGrillet: once we deny significance to the world, we also deny it absurdity. There is nothing ‘absurd’ about man’s attempt — against the most severe odds — to impose his purpose on a world indifferent to him. But these revelations have proven too horrifying or too difficult for man. As yet another example of his weak cognitive faculties, his consciousness lags far behind existing realities. He therefore clings to such outdated and comforting philosophical tenets as the predominance of Western civilization, the supremacy of reason, the concept of simplistic causality, absolute truth, and fixed\n\ncertainty; isolated identity and permanent states.22, Neal Postman propounds as far more appropriate symbols of the nuclear space age a series of concepts almost sadistically designed to repel the conservative mind: relativity, probability, contingency, uncertainty, structure as process, multiple causality, non-symmetrical relationships, degrees of difference, incongruity. To withstand these, we need a new breed\n\nof man:\n\nflexible, tolerant, innovative,\n\nques-\n\ntioning.?3 Only these will be able to dissolve the false antitheses we have unsuccessfully attempted to live by: matter and form, objectivity and subjectivity, imagination and reality, memory and. presence. What is perhaps most needed is the quality praised above all by Einstein in his mentor, the Austrian philosopher-scientist Ernst Mach: ‘incorruptible scepticism’.\n\nModern Art: Truth Through Subversion It is thus no longer possible for an artist creating within this historical period to portray reality along mimetic lines (art as the imitation of reality) or to view it as a coherent, fully intelligible construct, capable of apprehension through his sense organs and in its documentary aspects, a valid representation of the universe.\n\ntruth implies\n\n‘In our age, as never before,\n\nthe courage\n\nto face chaos.’24\n\nThe discoveries by Marx, Einstein, Freud, Heisenberg, and Planck, and the decline of a capitalist civilization previously viewed as immutable, have destroyed forever the myth of stability and permanence and have devalued realism. At the same time they have revealed poetry and non-linear art as more\n\nsuitable to the complex fluidities of the modern world view. The mysteries of microcosm and universe (and man’s humble role within it), the realized nightmares of Bosch, Kafka, Baudelaire, and Céline are finally\n\nbeginning to permeate the collective unconscious\n\nof the race, of which\n\nalways but barometers:\n\nthe most\n\nthe artists are\n\nsensitive\n\nand\n\nnaked\n\nContemporary man sees himself in his art, not as an idealized godlike figure, in the manner of the classical\n\ntradition,\n\nbut as a disrupted,\n\ncontorted\n\nvictim of the modern cataclysm, torn by forces of a magnitude beyond his comprehension, a grim figure, full of despair and anguish, entirely without hope.’5\n\nBut the process of learning is slow. This is why at the core of modern art stand concepts that still strike scorn or fear into the hearts of many as they are subversive of the very notion of conventional ‘reality’. Dissolution, fragmentation, simultaneity, decomposition —\n\n19\n\nWorld View\n\nthese are words in the service not of obfuscation but of clarification. They denote not escape from reality, but a more fundamental analysis by a dissection of its ever growing complexity. ‘The art of our century’, says Katherine Kuh, ‘has been characterized by shattered surfaces, broken colour, segmented\n\ncompositions, dissolving forms and shredded images. During the last hundred years, every aspect of art has been broken up — colour, light, pigment, form, line, content, space, surface, and design.’?° From the fragmentation of colour by the impressionists to the broken distortions of the expressionists, from\n\nthe segmentation of surfaces and planes by the cubists to the surrealists’ destruction of space and time, from the abstract expressionists’ attack on form and pigment to the dadaist-pop subversion of art and the conceptualists’ reduction to structure and nonmeaning, the ‘break-up’ of form and content in modern art is complete.\n\nModern Cinema as Modern Art The\n\ncongruence\n\nof these\n\ndevelopments\n\nin\n\nscience, philosophy, and art with the evolu-\n\ntion of modern cinema is so astonishing that Arnold Hauser, at the conclusion of his monumental study of the social sources of art, postulates film as the paradigm of modern art: The agreement between the technical methods of the film and the character of the new concept of time is so complete that one has the feeling that the time category of modern art must have arisen from the spirit of cinematic form, and one is inclined to consider film itself as the stylistically most representative (though qualitatively perhaps not the most fertile) genre of contemporary art.?7\n\nAnd so we are confronted by a stylistic, thematic, technological, and ideological liberation of film from nineteenth-century art. Everywhere the trend is away from illustrated literature and simplistic realism towards a freer, more poetic, visually oriented cinema. Realistic narrative structures, clearly defined\n\nplots and characters are increasingly displaced by visual ambiguity, poetic complexity, and restless improvisation. Editing is\n\n20\n\nexplosive,\n\nelliptic,\n\nunpredictable.\n\nmovements\n\nare frequent,\n\nand\n\nare\n\nspace\n\nCamera\n\nfree, fluid. Time\n\ntelescoped\n\nor\n\ndestroyed:\n\nmemory, reality and illusion are fused, until, in a flash of frightful revelation, we realize\n\nthat the totality of these uncertainties and discontinuities reflects nothing less than the modern world view. Thematically, the simplifications of realism have been left behind: concern with the human condition has not. We are inundated by ambiguity, allegory, and complexity, by an existentialist humanism devoid of certainty or illusion. The enormity of chaos has necessitated enormity of artistic means to portray and dissolve it. The ugly, the grotesque, the brutal, and the absurd provide the truths of a society in decline. Those who depict these truths, are the ‘committed’ artists of our day. Far from withdrawing into empty aestheticism, they are themselves anguished configurations of the alienation and deeper wisdom they portray. The simple answers of the nineteen-thirties are behind them. On a higher plane, they have returned, instead, to the questions. If the sum total of their endeavours seems to consist of configurations of anxiety, discontinuity, ambiguity, and tension, the causes reside in spheres beyond their control. Instead, in stately or disorderly array, today’s artists imploringly present us with flares in the night — reflections of terror, symbols of limited hope, allegories of inevitable corruption, warnings of holocausts, and intimations of possible love. It is on this exalted, adventurous plane that the new cinema perpetrates its errors and its triumphs, providing the mysterious satisfactions of art, the strange delight of ‘truth parading as illusion’, created within a\n\n> The wasteland of modern man; nature denuded and subjugated; human movement and inter-action amidst concrete; two silent, non-relating buildings, at odd angles to each other, paralleled by the positioning of the human protagonists; cars — prototypes of technology — zig-zagging; a perfectly straight, therefore inhuman white traffic line; and. in defiance of rationality, an inexplicable balloon that dominates all.

He sarcastically mocks our belief in filmic truth, disclaiming the omnipotence we ascribe to him and the director and insists on the falsehood and artificiality of the art work. This is a very modern film of ambiguity, mixed tenses, scepticism, and,\n\nultimately, anguish at the realization that the artist is both con-man and magician, impotently straining for unattainable perfection yet inevitably being taken seriously by an audience panting to be duped. Canyon Jon Jost, USA, 1971 A silent perusal of the Grand Canyon, morning to night, from a single, fixed camera position, by means of constant dissolves spaced a few seconds apart. Man — entirely absent — is no longer the centre of the universe ; the canyon exists outside of him. Despite the invisible photographer and his technologically-caused dissolves, this is a creditable approximation of the true foreign-ness of nature.

The message: beauty and order will be discovered only by those who first travel the painful road of confusion and disorder. The Eclipse (L’Eclisse) Michelangelo Antonioni, France/ltaly, 1962 (F) The third of the trilogy which includes L ‘Avventura and La Notte, this is Antonioni’s ultimate comment on the alienation of man in contemporary society. It is best exemplified by the last part of the film, one of the great sequences in film history. Repeatedly excised by various distributors as ‘irrelevant’, this is, in fact, the film's monstrous climax. The two protagonists have failed to ‘connect’ and do not appear for their date. Instead, in fifty-eight shots lasting seven minutes, we are subjected to an astonishing succession of empty streetscapes (at times referring back to earlier episodes in the film) signs, pavements, shadows, traffic lights, a darkening sky, and then night; a visual metaphor for the eclipse of man. La Jetée Chris Marker, France, 1963 This mysterious, profoundly disturbing masterpiece — made up almost entirely of still shots — is a poignant philosophical speculation on memory, loss and human destiny, permeated by an unbearable sense of nostalgia. Its doomed protagonist — representing imperfect, yet still human twentieth-century man — is compelled by his scientist-captors after the third (atomic) world war to travel into the past and a more ‘perfect’ future. In a poignant act of self-\n\naffirmation and self-destruction, he rejects it to return to our day when there still existed ‘real’ gardens, birds, children, and women. The montage of hundreds of stills shaped into poetic structures by means of rhythmic editing, sensuous dissolves, fades and zooms Is entirely unique. The one live sequence is a filmic ode to human love as in a series of continuous, imperceptible dissolves, stills of the girl from the past are transmuted into the haunting reality of her live smile. A subversive defence of human imperfection and romanticism as against technology and totalitarian conformism, the film effectively undermines what Marcuse refers to as the ‘Happy Consciousness’ of bourgeois society; after seeing It, nothing remains what It was before. Even Dwarfs Started Small (Auch Zwerge Haben Klein Angefangen) Werner Herzog, West Germany, 1970 (F) Set in an unidentified house of correction In a vaguely Spanish landscape, this sardonic, ominous film by Germany's most original young director centres on a misguided revolt against authority. In typically perverse fashion, Herzog’s entire cast is made up of dwarfs, a stroke of black humour that elevates this grotesque tale into a metaphor of humanity. This cruel attack on half-baked revolutions — an insidious call for better ones — Is filled with Kafkaesque episodes, as the dwarfs are repeatedly stymied by normalsize decor and objects that give the action a monstrous aspect: it is, after all, difficult\n\nZS\n\n4 Double chins, knitted brows, and sagging children achieved goggles,\n\nskins reveal these ominous to be dwarfs; mystery is by strange caps, Over-size white sticks, a seemingly dead\n\n(‘murdered?') animal.

Two blind dwarfs, grotesquely fitted out with caps, black goggles, and sticks, are taunted into ineffectual battle,\n\n24\n\nin which they continually miss their targets. A bizarre procession approaches with burning smoke-pots and a Christ-figure on a cross blasphemously revealed as a monkey. A midget couple is forced into a bedroom to perform a sexual act while watched by the others. The bed is too high. The female finally climbs it with difficulty, but the male cannot, even after taking a running jump; we ‘laugh’ — in horror. Perhaps the most disquieting scene occurs at the end, when a midget, suddenly confronted by a mysterious camel, breaks into a horrible, high-pitched, endless laugh. This turns into a scream of anguish, occasionally interrupted by spasmodic, deathlike coughs — a\n\nmetaphor for Herzog’s view of the human condition.\n\nThe Goalie’s Anxiety At The Penalty Kick (Die Angst Des Tormanns Beim Elfmeter) Wim Wenders, Austria, 1972 (F) . The story of a man — a soccer player — suddenly unable to function or to relate, except in ‘motive-less’ murder; a metaphor for alienation in contemporary life, based on Peter Handke’s novel. His world — a glossy, Americanized Vienna — is seen as existential mystery, lacking explanation. Fearful matters are touched upon in laconic, strange dialogue. An air of vague dread, intensified by the film’s magic realism, permeates the mysteries hinted at but never confronted.\n\nWorld View\n\nLast Year At Marienbad (Année Derniére A Marienbad)\n\nAlain Resnais, France//taly\n\n#267 (F) Ambiguity and simultaneity, the space-time continuum, the existence of interior and exterior universes, the bankruptcy of simplistic causality, the abandonment of psychological naturalism, the fusion of illusion and reality, the end of bourgeois individualism, the impossibility of ‘objective’ truth — all the high signs of the new sensibility are contained in this coldly brilliant classic of the modern film. In retrospect, it represents the apotheosis of the New Novel and New Cinema collaboration as personified by Resnais and Robbe-Grillet. Living In A Reversed World Theodor Wrismann and /vo Kohler, Austria, 195? Fascinating — and unintentionally funny — experiments at Austria’s famed Institute for Experimental Psychology involve a subject who for several weeks wears special glasses that reverse right and left and up and down. Unexpectedly, these macabre and somehow surrealist experiments reveal that our perception of these aspects of Vision is not of an optical nature and cannot be relied on, while the unfortunate, Kafkaesque subject stubbornly struggles through a morass of continuous failures. Masculine-Feminine\n\n(Masculin-Feminin) Jean-Luc Godard, France, 1966 (F) Among all the extraordinary experiments of this extra-\n\nordinary director, perhaps this\n\nis the one most typical of his concerns and modes of expression. Here, in microcosm or in full bloom, are the basic stylistic and thematic preoccupations of a man who — more than any other contemporary director — nakedly displays the new insights and confusions of our day. Godard has never transcended his ambiguous subject matters and anguished political-philosophical enquiries. They are chapters in his long essay of selfrealization, still being written on film. Godard, an obsessed humanist constantly torn between radical bourgeois liberalism and revolutionary impulses, is viscerally as well as intellectually at war with contemporary capitalist society. Although masterfully reflecting capitalism’s mortal crisis, he is unable to synthesize his insights into how it is to be transcended. And so Masculine-Feminine is not a story film (its ‘plot’ is virtually non-existent) but a view of a generation; a portrayal of Parisian youth of the sixties — the children, in Godard’s words, ‘of Marx and Coca Cola’. Lengthy political discussions, fleeting sexual liaisons, the drifting senselessness of adolescent life in a big city, the inundation of consciousness by advertising, consumer goods, posters, slogans, manipulated images; all these co-exist with apparently gratuitous death (a frequent Godard tribute to the existential act); antibourgeois shock (‘loose’ talk about birth control, still illegal in France); extreme emphasis on improvised, intimate interviews (investigations of emotions instead\n\nof their portrayal); intrusion of lettering, signs, and philosophical main titles into the action; and long silences and extended one-take sequences, dynamically inter-cut with quick, nervous passages. When the film is over, instead of having viewed a story that has come to an end, we remain caught up in an ambiance of feeling and understanding that is remarkably modern: nonromantic, bitter-sweet, ambivalent. Nothing Happened This Morning\n\nDavid Bienstock, USA, 1965 An extraordinary, original attempt at pure cubism, simultaneity, atomization of time, space, plot, and narrative, as the camera observes ‘a most ordinary and truly universal event’: waking up, getting ready, departure. An exploration of atmosphere and states of being, the film proceeds on the levels of outer and inner reality and projects yet a third: the ‘innate’, man-less reality of the room and the objects within it, viewed in lengthy, stationary one-shots, silent except for street noises. A forerunner of minimal cinema, but ‘with a purpose’, these scenes are in startling contrast to those involving the man, which proceed at staccatospeed (two-frame-cuts), to the point of annihilation (and more sophisticated reconstitution) of reality.

A macabre landscape of impotence and absurdity, peopled by ambiguous travellers, finally explodes into senseless violence. A hypnotic paraphrase of mankind's atomic cul-de-sac (clearly influenced by existentialism), the film has no conventional plot, dealing instead with day-dreams, associations and dé/a vus. Set in a stone-covered, sunparched desert, with remnants of civilization strewn about, the travellers pass through stations of an illusory voyage that increase the feeling of the absurd. A murder occurs without cause and creates neither guilt nor prosecution. The world has moved beyond good and evil; since life is absurd, crime is inconsequential. The film analyses states of a meaningless existence from which no escape is possible.\n\n26\n\nRashomon Akira Kurosawa, Japan, LOS se) ae While this film has always been considered one of the classics of world cinema, it remained for Parker Tyler to analyse it as the archetype of modern sensibility in film. For the killing of the travelling merchant and the rape of his wife by a bandit — reenacted four times by each of the protagonists and a presumed witness — results not merely in four different and irreconcilable stories: more perversely, it implies that all are true and false, that ‘the truth’ of a human situation is never simple and that objectivity cannot be achieved. Here cinema approaches the subtleties of Dostoevski, the insights of the Cubists, Futurists, and Freudians into the nature of reality as a multiplicity of overlapping, conflicting, converging strands and layers, each contributing to the ‘truth’ of the whole — a truth that remains ‘subjective’ and, in terms of certainty, inevitably elusive. Relativity Ed Emshwiller, USA, 1966 A complex, metaphoric statement of man’s place in the universe, from a modernist perspective. Significantly, this draws on both science and metaphysics. The most accomplished craftsman of the American avant-garde, Emshwiller uses his handheld camera, as if an extension of a dancer's body, for sensuous tracking shots and intricate movements. Combined with his complete control over tools and technique, this creates a visually dense and mysterious work\n\nthat comments on man’s evolution, the relativity of his striving, his slightly ridiculous persistence, sexual drives, and possibly hopeful future. Two Or Three Things | Know About Her (Deux Ou Trois Choses Que Je Sais D’Elle) Jean-Luc Godard, France, 1966 (F) Paris today: high-rise buildings, anonymous living, and casual prostitution as symbols of capitalist decline; the benevolent dictatorship of the consumer society enforces performance and the ‘selling’ of self so that one may live well. Godard’s whispered philosophical comments on the film’s action introduce further elements of sophisticated ambiguity. Zorn’s Lemma Hollis Frampton, USA, 1970 (F) This radical example of reductive cinema Is a warning of things to come: ‘Meaning’ (political, psychological, personal, or whatever) has been eliminated and the work exists purely for itself, demanding attention to structure, pattern and orchestration. Reality is declared impalpable, faceless, incoherent, existing in inexplicable grandeur, independent of us. ‘The film's title derives from a mathematical axiom (or\n\n“lemma’’) postulated by the 19th-century German mathematician Zorn according to which “every partially ordered set contains a maximal fully ordered sub-set’.\n\nIt consists of three parts.

(Jean-Luc Godard, Weekend, France, 1968, see p. 27)\n\nWorld View\n\nalmost two hours, we observe a young, strikingly pretty girl, nude most of the time and alone in an apartment, engaged in a sonambulistic and sensuous attempt at coming to terms with herself. We first see her encircling, embracing, encompassing a round, white formica table.\n\nShe undresses, mounts it nude, rubbing against it in a vain attempt to possess it. Later, this same tactile, sensuous exploration occurs with a door, a doorknob and a latch, all of which are compulsively manipulated, She fingers an orange and, simultaneously, one of her breasts, with her eyes closed. ,Overpowered by the objects around her, she attempts to wrest their mysteries from them and to define her relation to them; even a toilet is explored as a new object, In an extraordinary scene, she props up the legs of a heavy sofa with some books, just enough to allow her to slip under it, and then systematically removes them to feel fully the growing weight of the sofa upon her as she tries to extricate herself; the heavy, sado-masochistic sensuality of this scene is remarkable. The most important — and sensational — scene of the\n\nfilm, almost fifteen minutes long, involves a minutely detailed and seemingly ‘real’ act of masturbation with a bicycle wheel. As the girl reclines on the sofa in mounting ecstasy, the wheel is first fondled, then pressed against her crotch, moistened by mucus transferred from her mouth to a handkerchief, and ever more rapidly rotated with one hand. The passionate union of this beautiful young woman with an inanimate\n\n30\n\nobject represents a simultaneous apotheosis of eroticism and-alienation; her voluptuous exhaustion and playful toying with the wheel after her ‘lover’ has left her is without parallel. The fact that Arakawa is a painter contributes to but does not explain the striking plasticity of the film, the palpable, oppressive closeness of shapes, objects and visuals. The room, innocent in its simple, antiseptic modernity, imperceptively changes from environment into devourer: objects are transformed into myths and metaphors. We see them, as does the protagonist, with an exceptional lucidity and profound tactile sensuality, and are riveted not by a conventional story but by a state of mind. The ritualized style reinforces the film's internal, hallucinatory intensity and the obsessive power of its images. Throughout It all, the camera remains alienated from the action, a cold-hearted observer, reminiscent of early Warhol, almost sadistic in its concentration. It does not flinch from showing whatever comes before it, even her bush as she crawls, sits, or straddles. But it does so ina totally documentary, nonsensational manner, lightyears removed from both the intentional, titillating avoidance of nudity in commercial films (in scenes where it is required), or the unerotic revelation of gaping cunts in the ‘beaver’ movies. Ultimately, and by purely visual means, the film reveals itself as a Comment on the torture of self-knowledge, the madness of loneliness, the sweetly lethal nostalgia of\n\nmemory. A great, very modern sadness and nightmarish heaviness inform the film. Here minimal art, deeply touched by emotion, becomes the terrifying equivalent of the human condition. Is not the girl — totally self-centred, tortured by that which no longer exists, alienated and relating only to objects, highly eroticized, and involved in lacerating self-exploration — is she not a mirror of ourselves today in the disaster which calls itself our civilization?\n\nPART ONE\n\nWeapons of Subversion: The Subversion of Form\n\nThe Revolutionary Film\n\nAvant-garde in Soviet\n\nTo anyone acquainted with the Soviet cinema of the Stalin era —- a numbing succession of academic, reflecting\n\nconventional, ‘bourgeois’ works the ossified ideological superstructure — a return to the great Soviet masterpieces of the nineteen-twenties is the equivalent of a trip to another planet. As in politics, the two periods are aesthetically and thematically poles apart. Never before had there existed a statefinanced, nationalized cinema entirely devoted to subversion as was built in Russia after the October revolution. The creation of a new consciousness, the destruction of reactionary values, the demolition of myths of state, church, and capital — these objectives were to permeate the ideological superstructure of the proletarian state, its arts, its education. And the cinema — in Lenin’s view,\n\nthe most important of the arts — was to assume a central role in the struggle; for it was the art form most accessible to the dispersed,\n\nilliterate masses. Several factors contributed to the unpre-’ cedented explosion of creative energy forever linked with the towering achievements of the early Soviet cinema. Among these were the profoundly liberating, innovative tendencies freed by the liquidation of the former regime, the exuberant hopes for the creation of a first society of equality and freedom, and the Lenin-Trotsky-Lunacharsky decision, despite their insistence on proletarian dictatorship, to permit freedom of expression to the various artistic tendencies beginning to develop. This was particularly significant, since Lenin’s views on the arts were conservative and tinged by that same ascetic puritanism so often found in the revolutionary movement. The result was an unprecedented flowering of diverse avant-garde and intellectual tendencies in theatre, painting, literature, music,\n\nand cinema — unique also in being statefinanced. This cultural proliferation saw the\n\n52\n\ngrowth of constructivism and futurism and the absorption into the Soviet experience of expressionism and surrealism. From 1917 into the early twenties, the congruence of avant-garde art and radical ideology, the fusion of form and content (so hotly debated in the West ever since, and not so secretly the subject of this book) existed in action. For a brief, glowing second of historical time, the commitments of the vanguard artist and the society around him almost coincided. This achievement of the October revolution will never be eradicated; yet, just as the promise of a new society faded into the gruesome obscenities of Stalin’s state-capitalist totalitarianism, so did the wedding of avant-garde and state prove temporal. The eternal tension between organized society and creative artist reasserted itself in the particularly brutal form of suicides, secret deaths, exile, emigration,\n\nor abject surrender. The price paid by Stalin in the arts for the internal consolidation of a regime of terror was — as in Hitler’s Germany — the total eradication of modernity and the creation of a perverse picture-postcard Kitsch ‘art’, criminally referred to as ‘socialist realism’. Since social liberation is impossible without personal freedom (which includes the freedom of all art forms to develop), the only person truly ‘subversive’ of the values of the October revolution was Stalin. In retrospect the basic political and aesthetic tenets of the early Soviet cinema can be summarized as a fundamental subversion of filmic content and form. In content, it constituted rejection of the individualism, sentimentality, and aestheticism of rulingclass art, a passion for the grasping and taming of reality, and the creation of archetypes and revolutionary consciousness. In form, early Soviet cinema manifested an aggressive rejection of conventional methods and systems and a profound concern with the theory and language of film, influenced by\n\nAvant-Garde\n\nin Soviet Russia\n\n4 Three people, related by murder, trapped in an Arctic wilderness amidst mounting psychological tension. Plot, decor, and style are stripped to their essence, thus making gestures and small events loom larger. The agitated yet formal composition of the still reflects the film's ordered melodrama. (Lev Kuleshov, By The Law, USSA, 7926)\n\nthe formalist critics Shklovsky and Jacobson, forerunners of structuralism. These elements recur in the philosophical and aesthetic writings as well as in the films of the directortheoreticians who created an entire art in their image and made the Soviet Cinema world-famous.\n\n33\n\nStrike (Stachka) Sergei M. Eisenstein. USSR, Zou (ie) The genius of Soviet cinema was Sergei Mikhailovich Eisenstein. Filmmaker, teacher and theoretician, his writings on film constitute brilliant syntheses of philosophy and aesthetics amidst a morass of mediocrity. Member of a minority nationality (a Jew born in Riga), cosmopolitan by nature and a man of wide culture, this complex internationalist proved too sophisticated and perverse for the earthy conservatism of Stalin. His life therefore reads like a tragic caricature of the successful, frustrated, eternally haunted artist. Though he left us Strike (1925), Battleship Potemkin (1925), October (1927), The Old And The New (1929), Alexander Nevsky (1938) and /van The Terrible (1944-46), Eisenstein’s life was an unbroken series of abandoned projects. His films were shelved by official fiat; they were banned, mutilated, or, worse, self-censored. His was a life of powerful and uncertain official position, of compromise and emasculation, of abject self-criticism and isolation within triumph. Eisenstein is the archetypal tragic artist who cannot fit’ into any establishment; his ill-fated ventures in the USA (Dreiser's unfilmed An American Tragedy) and in Mexico (with Upton Sinclair) _ testify to his inability to coexist with capitalism as well.1 In the end, emasculated by bureaucrats in the East and financiers in the West, one of the few authentic geniuses of\n\ncinema died in embitterment and impotence. Strike, his ill-fated first film — a veritable compendium of\n\n34\n\nexperimental cinema — is not even supposed to exist. Attacked in Russia and renounced in later years by Eisenstein himself, banned in several countries, not shown in others, it was officially declared ‘lost’ under Stalin and ‘rediscovered’ in the Soviet archives only after his death. A major work, it prefigured in embryonic form the major tenets of Eisenstein’s aesthetic. As such it is indispensable for understanding film as a subversive art. Editing as the essence of film art The essence of film art for Eisenstein lies in the creation of a new psychological reality by means of creative editing (montage). Increasingly dissatisfied with the too limited (because static) realism of theatre, Eisenstein had made a final abortive attempt to force immediacy by staging the play Gasmasks inside a factory. He then turned to cinema under the slogan: ‘Away from Realism — To Reality!’ A profound, possessed adherent of visual culture, he firmly placed the image at the centre of his filmic ideology, but only as it existed in relation to subsequent or preceding shots; cinema was seen as an art of conflicts between images. A technical process (the ordering of strips of film into logical, narrative sequence) was thus transformed into an aesthetic act. The cinema became an art of the laboratory, not of the act of shooting: events, seen in real life as a continuous, integrated flux of objects in motion, were ‘cut’ by the director-editor into discrete segments (mere snatches of reality), then dynamically joined in combinations\n\ndesigned to create a new reality. In a not entirely tenable analogy with Japanese character writing, Eisenstein explains creative editing as a multiplication rather than addition of separate effects. Just as the Japanese character for ‘dog’ and another for ‘mouth’ form, when juxtaposed, the character for ‘bark’, so the juxtaposition of two shots creates an entity greater than the sum of its components (as in Gestalt psychology). Each shot is an object; but in their combination, shots create concepts — metaphors, symbols, a new grasp of underlying intellectual constructs. Montage works by the collision of two pieces of film, not by their mere ‘joining’. Eisenstein insists on the presence of montage, conflict and contradiction in all the arts — surprises, disproportion, distortion, unexpected combinations, and, most importantly, irregularity.2 As the brain is confronted by the unexpected, it moves back and forth in confusion and excited agitation in an immediate,\n\ninevitable search for relationships and does not come to rest until a new ‘understanding’ is reached. Here Eisenstein parallels the Surrealists’ insistence on unexpected juxtapositions. Thus editing is not peaceful, but rather like a ‘series of explosions of the internal combustion engine to drive a car (film) forward .... The conflicts between shots or even within a single shot might be those of scales, volumes, masses, graphic direction, close-up as against long-shot, darkness against light, image against sound. Each of these tensions is, as Gyorgy Kepes puts it, ‘resolved\n\n= a\n\nExpressionism,\n\nCommedia\n\ndell’ Arte,\n\na love of the bizarre, and a strong feeling for visuals and compositions converge in this extraordinary shot of Lumpenproletarians emerging from their ‘homes’ to become police provocateurs against the striking\n\nworkers. (Sergei M. Eisenstein, Strike, USSR,\n\n1925, see p. 34)\n\ninto a meaning configuration. These configurations in turn serve as a basis for further tensions; consequently for further configurations. Contradiction is the basis of dynamic organization of the associative qualities of the image.’° Editing, then, is not merely combining what is visible in individual shots, but making conscious invisible concepts arising from their combination — the chains and clashes of psychological associations\n\ndiabolically contrived by the artist for maximum shock. To Eisenstein, the concept of collision was the expression in art of Marxist dialectics — the movement of all nature from thesis to antithesis to synthesis. It also represents the subverting of objective reality and of the unwitting spectator, who is thereby raised to new levels of comprehension by the manipulations of the director. In Strike, this emphasis on ‘collision’ is carried out in almost every one of its thousands of shots by such technical devices as changing the size of the image within the frame, unorthodox dissolves and iris effects (even to the combining of the two), split screen, slow and reverse motion, unexpected camera movements and angles, double\n\nexposures, the use of masks to hide or reveal portions of the image, the sudden intrusion of objects and limbs into the frame, the introduction of new locales and/or characters without prior explanation. Even the titles interspersed throughout form part of the\n\nmontage, since their wording, typography, length, and positioning (precisely specified by Eisenstein) are integrated into the rhythm of the film. Throughout, there |s deliberate visual manipulation and mystification to put the spectator into a state of permanent psychological tension. The best example of Eisenstein's montage methods occurs In the famous sequence in which the four capitalists dealing with the strike are\n\n30\n\noS -\n\n:\n\nAvant-Garde\n\nseated in the plush comfort and isolation of their mansion, smoking and drinking. Through cross-cutting, we now see, in this order: workers at a clandestine strike meeting; the Capitalist putting a lemon into a juice extractor; the workers discuss their demands; the handle of the juice extractor descends to crush the fruit; the workers are charged by mounted police; the boss says in an inter-title: ‘Crush hard and then squeeze!’; the workers are attacked; a piece of lemon drops on to the wellpolished shoe of the capitalist; disgusted, he uses the paper containing the workers demands to wipe it off. The juice extractor both embodies the force used to crush the strikers and simultaneously implicates the bosses in the action. Stylization and Typage From his life-long preoccupation with circus, music hall, Commedia dell’Arte, and Kabuki Theatre, Eisenstein derived the concept of ‘type-\n\n4 Aesthetic and formalist preoccupations of Soviet film avant-garde join with ideological content; the hands of striking workers, raised in supplication or self-defence against the attacking\n\npolice. Dynamic utilization of frame area. (Sergei M. Eisenstein, Strike, USSR, 1925, see p. 34)\n\n4 The Ruling Class: plush comfort, cigars (excessively used), reclining figures sure of being ‘on top’. As in Commedia dell ‘Arte — a life-long influence on Eisenstein — the director works with easily identifiable stock types. Strong formal composition avoids superfluous decor and concentrates action in the centre. (Sergei M. Eisenstein, Strike, USSR, 1925)\n\ncasting’. This entailed the creation of composite ‘stock’ types — worker, capitalist, spy — a distillation of the most significant traits of a particular social ‘type’. Eschewing subtlety or the ‘building’ of character as bourgeois\n\nindividualism, Eisenstein portrayed the ‘essence’ of social types for purposes of propagandistic art. In Strike, capitalists are fat, smoke cigars, wear top hats, grimace frequently, are vicious, oppressive, spoiled, and sensual (a peculiar equation of sex and the ruling class); to increase their grossness and power, they are frequently photographed from below. In a similar manner the stock characters in Commedia dell ‘Arte, Punch and Judy shows, and the films of Chaplin (whom Eisenstein greatly admired) move through pantomime and slapstick to portray easily identifiable ‘types’. Since Eisenstein, ‘typage’ has become a favourite tool of propaganda films, used by political systems of every persuasion to attack their enemies in the most direct, most simplistic manner possible. Substitution of Collective Man for Individual Hero Customary bourgeois tales of individual sorrow or sex, eternal triangles, and unrequited or orgiastic love affairs were eliminated by Eisenstein in favour of dramas involving the movement of classes or masses. In Str/ke, the protagonist is ‘collective action’ — an episode of mass struggle in pre-revolutionary Russia. Despite its propagandistic intent, the film is suffused with an aestheticism that\n\nin Soviet Russia\n\nproved anathema to the regime and later to Eisenstein himself. A work of youth — free, exuberant, passionate, full of ‘errors — it reveals a genius exploring a new language in a gushing excess of imagination. Clearly the story itself — the suicide of a worker leading to an ill-fated strike — seems in retrospect secondary to his basic preoccupations. But Eisenstein was never to systematize his structuralist concern with the new vocabulary and syntax of cinema, though he continued to explore them in his films, his teaching and writing. 1See Marie Seton, Serger M.

Earth (Zemlya) Alexander Dovzhenko,\n\nUSSR, EEO (GF) In retrospect, Alexander Dovzhenko emerges as one of the most profound talents of the Russian cinema, the man who raised it from the encrustations of propaganda\n\nand intellectualism to the level of visual poetry. The destruction of realistic time and space occurs here — as it does in advanced contemporary cinema — as a necessity of poetic art.\n\nAesthetically revolutionary, Earth was ‘rightfully’ attacked by conservative Stalinist commissars who distrusted its poetic freedom, pantheist lyricism, and the ‘cosmic’ manner in which it absorbed (instead of liquidating) the class enemy.\n\noul\n\nAvant-Garde\n\nin Soviet Russia\n\nThe ‘plot’ is minimal, ideologically safe; the kulaks in a Ukrainian village are opposed to the purchase of a tractor by the young peasants and arrange to have their leader murdered. But the film’s significance lies elsewhere, in its ode to the oneness of man and nature, to the joys and terrors of existence, In its overpowering procession of lyrical images, each larger than life. Earth exists entirely in episodes: the peaceful, smiling death of an old peasant among his apple trees; the almost hallucinatory dance of the doomed young leader down a deserted, moonlit country road — a hymn to the human spirit — which continues wordlessly for minutes and ends in sudden murder; the distress of his fiancée who tears off her clothes in spectral despair — a sequence unique in Soviet cinema for its nudity (promptly removed by Stalinist censors but preserved in an uncensored copy discovered\n\nin 1958). Stylistically, the film is spectacular in the originality with which conventional structure is replaced by poetic continuity. It is framed by lyrical images of sky and soil, of the richness of nature's fruits. It portrays man’s place within a pantheist universe of fertility, life and death. A series of passionate episodes — more powerful than the plot — anticipates the concerns of contemporary and avant-garde cinema in its exploration of states of being. Much of the film consists of a succession of beautifully sculptured\n\npeasant portraits of\n\ngreat plasticity. These are photographed in medium shot or close-up, in attitudes and\n\n38\n\nmotions of joy, repose, expectation or fear, separated by slow fades. -Though representing social ‘types’, these are the real faces of the\n\nUkraine far removed from propagandistic simplifications. Constant tension is maintained by the massing of related images into repeated climaxes; several scenes resemble frozen shots but are posed by immobile actors in attitudes of pregnant stillness. Following the son's murder, an identical scene of his father mourning, immobile at a table is repeated three times, separated by slow fades. Throughout, time is concentrated to the utmost. Decor, events, motivations are reduced to an epic, very modern simplicity. The real significance of the film resides not so much In its content as in its subversion of established form; it is a masterpiece of modern cinema thirty years ahead of its time.\n\nStorm Over Asia (Potomok Chingis-Khan) V.1. Pudovkin, USSR, 1928 (F) One of the four giants of the early Soviet cinema, Vsevolod llarionovich Pudovkin, is at once more sensuous and less cerebral than Eisenstein or Vertov. His films tend more towards clear-cut, simple stories in which a particular carefully drawn human fate serves as a statement of universal relevance. This frequently is the attaining of revolutionary consciousness by the oppressed, learning from the experience of life. The intentional simplifications of\n\ncharacter and situation are inherently in accord with the requirements of silent cinema. The style is almost lyrical, of great psychological resonance,\n\nvigorously naturalistic but with strong expressionist overtones, depending heavily on complex, almost mathematical montage and rhythm. (‘| claim that every object shown on the screen to the spectator Is a dead object, even if it moved before the camera, until it has been edited.’) During the 1920 Russian civil war, a young Mongolian is falsely assumed by the British White Army to be a descendant of Genghiz Khan and is therefore used as puppet to legitimatize its invasion. He discovers the imperialists’ true intentions, and, at the head of a suddenly huge horde of mounted revolutionaries, drives them from the country. The sheer visual dynamism of this final sequence — a cascade of ever more rapid, ever more forceful images interspersed with revolutionary titles in increasing crescendo — had a powerful, radicalizing impact on audiences. Other strong images and episodes had the same effect; the Mongol about to be executed,\n\na Poverty and despair as a political and aesthetic experience; the stark realism of minimal decor and attire is reinforced by painstaking composition\n\nand lighting. The shocking juxtaposition of military decoration and debility caused by war provides an ideological and compositional centre. (Alexander Dovzhenko, Arsenal, USSR, 1929)\n\n> Excised by Stalinist censors, this sequence — unique in Soviet cinema because of its nudity — violently conveys\n\nthe irrational despair of a young woman whose lover has just been murdered. Strong horizontal and vertical lines (table, chair, curtains) are disturbingly broken by the opposing diagonals of woman's body and bench. (Alexander Dovzhenko, Earth, USSR, 1930, see\n\np. 37)\n\na Having just wounded him in a botched execution attempt, the British White Army and its clerical collaborators — East and West — now attempt to woo this Mongolian guerilla into becoming their puppet ruler, falsely assuming him\n\nto be a descendant of Genghiz Khan. His rebellious innocence, however, has been replaced by revolutionary distrust, revealed in a strongly diagonal composition converging on the centre. (V./.Pudovkin, Storm Over Asia, USSR,\n\n1928, see p. 38)\n\nheedlessly walking through a mud puddle which his ‘civilized’ British executioner studiously avoids; Buddhist priests, Western businessmen, and British militarists related visually to establish their congruence as ruling class; a dignified Lama priest and a ridiculous British general's wife cross-cut while dressing for a formal occasion. At a moment\n\nAO\n\nof revelation, the Mongol suddenly grabs hold of the British soldier's lapels. This is repeated several times in very ‘modern’ editing style. Altogether, the film is an object lesson in visual political cinema, glowing with revolutionary fervour and hatred for oppression. The Man With The Movie Camera (Chelovek a Kinoapparatom) IDAIGE) Wliov, OSSin, 12S), (Pe) In retrospect, the avant-garde poet Dziga Vertov emerges as one of the most important influences in Soviet Cinema. Vertov moved rapidly from the production of propagandistic newsreels to a full radical aesthetic — the Kino-Eye — which found its culmination in his masterpiece, The Man With The Movie Camera.\n\nBeginning with his 1919 manifesto in LEF, the avant-\n\ngarde journal edited by Mayakovsky, Vertov condemned the story film and proclaimed himself disinterested in psychological explorations of character: ‘Down with bourgeois fairytale plots and scenarios — long live life as it is!’ The emphasis was to be on the ‘unplayed’ over the\n\nplotted film, on the substitution of documentation for narrative and mise en scene, on the destruction of the theatrical proscenium (invisibly present in so many Hollywood films) in favour of ‘the proscenium of life itself’. This meant, as one Russian critic put it, the ‘detection’ of plot within reality, instead of its ‘invention’ Hence, the elimination of actors, lighting, make-up, studio, costumes, and decor.\n\na The cinematographer as God, hovering over the multitude, seeing all.\n\nSignificantly, however, he seems to be photographing a camera which stands by itself, as if even the cinematographer had become dispensable (anticipating what happens in the /ast ree/). In any case, he is an i//usory God; the ‘real’ cameraman — the one who photographed him — remains invisible. (Dziga Vertov, The Man With The Movie Camera, USSR, 1929, see p. 40) >7he origins of Godard: Vertov's obsessive delight in mysterious visuals counterposes poster and bottle, their size and compositional unity (shape of bottle conforming to that of woman's cheek) transforming them into huge reaffirmations of unknown mysteries. (Dziga Vertov, The Man With The Movie Camera, USSR, 1929, see p. 40)\n\n41\n\na The early Soviet cinema displays a strong sense of plastic and visual values, an emphasis on composition,\n\nand a\n\nfeeling for form and abstraction within the requirements of radical ideology. Here capitalists crowd the stock exchange to watch their war profits climb. (V./.Pudovkin, The End of St.Petersburg, USSR, 1927)\n\nIt was with the ‘camera eye’, — the ‘armed eye of the director’ — that the essence of reality was to be captured.
