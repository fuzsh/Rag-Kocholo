The Name Was Spelled P-h-r-y-c-e When They Wove the Bayeux Tapestry\n\nWalter Price was talking about himself again, discoursing in detail on the distinguished and ancient history of the Price family. Tom Harrow had often heard Walter indulge himself before in egocentric reminiscence. Breakfast was almost over, and Tom Harrow was listening without being bored. In fact, he was not sure, because of his age and the erosion of time, whether or not he had ever before heard Walter on the subject of his very early forebears. This was not strange, because he had heard Walter on a great number of others, and for many years had only half listened. Given an adequate space of time, one could discount a number of things about Walter, but Tom Harrow still could not discount him personally. He knew that Walter had ability and he invariably respected Walter's powers of imagination. It was a pleasure to sit over a late breakfast and listen to Walter talk, because it was no longer necessary to give Walter full attention. He could think, as Walter's discourse progressed, that Walter must have overindulged in his old bad morning habit of sitting in a bathtub filled with cold water and drinking a jigger of straight gin.\n\nTom Harrow could recall distinctly the first time he had ever known Walter to indulge in this practice. This had been when Tom was living in an apartment on Lexington Avenue. It was summer and his wife, Rhoda, had gone to Watch Hill with their son, Hal; but it had been necessary for Tom to stay in town in order to pick the cast for a play, the name of which he could not recollect at the moment. It was a great many years ago, although even then his friendship with Walter Price had already burgeoned, but the whole scene was accurately dated because the gin which Walter had been drinking was still known as \"bathtub gin.\" Walter had occupied Hal's tub, and Walter had not fitted into it accurately.\n\n\"Tom,\" he had heard Walter calling--and whenever Walter wanted anything his voice had the appeal of melodramatic urgency--\"will you please come here quickly?\"\n\nHe could remember the first thought that had run through his mind. Walter in those days frequently told of a crisis which he had faced while staying at the Hotel Biltmore in New York when he was working in an advisory capacity with the author of the play known as Getting Gertie's Garter. Walter had been very sure that the play was Getting Gertie's Garter, although it could have been Up In Mabel's Room, and Tom Harrow had already observed back in the bathtub gin days that Walter was becoming less and less accurate about plays and facts. Indeed, as of the present, Walter was beginning to move his early play-doctoring days to London, where he had helped Mr. Shaw with Major Barbara--a difficult move, since Walter's life span did not fit well with Major Barbara.\n\nBack at the Biltmore, Walter had felt exhausted after hours of what he chose to call \"close intellectual collision,\" and he had retired to the room supplied for him by the producer of Up in Mabel's Room or Getting Gertie's Garter, or whatever the confection might have been on which he had been working. The title did not really matter. The point was that Walter had plunged himself into a hot tub for purposes of relaxation, and there were fine large bathtubs in the Biltmore then, as perhaps there were still, but Walter only recollected the Biltmore as it had existed in the days contemporaneous with F. Scott Fitzgerald, whom Walter always oddly referred to as Fitzy.\n\nPlunging into a hot bath for purposes of relaxation was a practice, he often explained, that had been taught him by his old colored mammy on the family plantation near Columbia, South Carolina--a lovely place, which General Sherman had spared after Walter's grandmother, then a mere slip of a girl, had interceded personally with the general. The plantation period had occurred long before Walter had begun moving himself and the whole Price family to their holdings at Halliday Hall in Hampshire, England--not that any of this concerned the bathtub. The point was that Walter in his warm bath had developed a habit of plunging almost beneath the water and then pushing himself upward against the back of the tub. Even in the twenties he had started putting on weight, because suddenly a suction developed between his shoulder blades so severe that any motion he made to extricate himself caused excruciating agony and his cries for assistance went unheeded, but finally nature asserted herself by abhorring the vacuum and thus he was released.\n\nWhen Walter called on that distant day at Lexington Avenue, Tom hurried to Hal's bathroom fearing that Walter had been caught again, but it was morning and Walter was in cold water. It was Walter's old Scottish tutor, a direct descendant of Boswell, who had taught Walter to indulge in the rigors of a cold preprandial bath. The pain, as the tutor had said, was worth the buttered scones, or words to that effect.\n\n\"Tom,\" Walter had said, \"would you mind playing the good host and bringing me a bottle of gin to counter the chill? Gin and cold water of a morning give me my best thoughts. It was a trick I learned from my grandfather, Colonel Lamar, who served with Hood's Brigade before he acquired his large holdings in Nicaragua.\" That was certainly long before Walter had moved the Price family to Hampshire, but Walter had never given up a cold morning tub and gin. The practice set the wheels of the mind revolving, not that the wheels had ever needed lubrication, and ever afterwards Tom had seen to it personally that a fifth of gin was always placed in Walter's bathroom whenever Walter came to stay with him, professionally or socially.\n\nToday at the breakfast table Walter's discourse on the early history of the Price family was not a bad topic for the late morning. Over the centuries, it seemed, the name Price, originally early Norman, had undergone considerable alteration.\n\n\"This fact first occurred to me when I was in the fifth form at Harrow,\" Walter Price said. \"Those dear Edwardian days! I wish you might have been able, Tom, to share with me the privilege of having attended Harrow.\"\n\nReluctantly Tom pulled his rambling thoughts together. A glance at his Spode coffeecup, at the mahogany of the breakfast table, and at the hot plates on the hunting board reminded him that he also had been occasionally to England.\n\n\"Now wait a minute,\" he said. \"I thought you had gone to the Taliaferro School for Boys outside Columbia, South Carolina. You used to walk there barefoot from the old plantation, didn't you? The school was run by Colonel Taliaferro, a great Latinist, who had served with your grandfather Lamar under General Hood--or was I thinking of somebody else?\"\n\nWalter Price sighed patiently.\n\n\"That was considerably earlier, Tom,\" he said, \"before my Uncle Roderick sent for me in South Africa. Uncle Roderick was one of Rhodes's protégés, you may remember. He started as Rhodes's office boy when he was eleven and a half. I'll have to tell you about Uncle Roderick sometime, Tom. He's a story himself--a true product of the old unregenerate days when England was Old England. May I have another cup of coffee? It's a beautiful George the Third coffeepot, Tom.\"\n\n\"Actually it's George the Second,\" Tom Harrow said.\n\n\"Of course it is,\" Walter Price answered. \"And I remember now. You bought it after Hero's Return, didn't you? No wonder you could afford the piece, Tom. But I'm amazed that Rhoda didn't want it.\"\n\n\"She would have, if she'd remembered it,\" Tom Harrow said. \"But she had switched by then to Early American silver. Go and call on her someday and let her show you the Reveres and Hurds I bought her.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" Walter Price said, \"I've seen them, Tom. I thought they were Presley's old family pieces.\"\n\nThere was no use pursuing the subject. Perhaps everything, even history, ceased being factually accurate after a term of years.\n\n\"Let's get back to your school days at Harrow,\" Tom said. \"You must have been pretty old for Harrow, judging from what you told me about that Taliaferro School in Columbia.\"\n\n\"I've always admired your memory, Tom,\" Walter Price said, \"but still you fall down sometimes on small details. What was it I ever told you about Taliaferro School in Columbia?\"\n\n\"I don't suppose I'm as accurate as I used to be,\" Tom Harrow said, \"but it seems to me that you told me once that in your first year in Taliaferro's School in Columbia, South Carolina, you got a young girl into trouble. I think you said that she had something to do with the Temperance Drink Bottling Company.\"\n\nWalter blinked his eyes twice. There was no doubt that he had put on weight. In fact, his features hardly resembled those of the earlier Price that Tom Harrow had known once, but personality still persisted.\n\n\"We're getting off the subject,\" Walter said. \"When was it I told you about Colonel Taliaferro's School?\"\n\nAlthough Walter Price had ceased to be useful long ago, if indeed he ever had been, Tom still enjoyed his company because neither seriously expected anything from the other--except that Walter would probably ask for a loan before his visit terminated.\n\n\"I'm glad you asked me that one,\" Tom Harrow said, \"because I can remember the occasion exactly. It was in that apartment that Rhoda and I had on Lexington Avenue. You were sitting in Hal's bathtub drinking gin when you told about the Temperance Drink girl.\"\n\n\"I remember, now that you bring up the point,\" Walter said. \"But please recollect that Southerners are more sexually precocious than Northerners, as a rule. Look what goes on in the West Indies, according to all accounts.\"\n\n\"Whose accounts?\" Tom Harrow asked.\n\n\"Anyone's accounts,\" Walter Price said. \"Frankly, I don't recall at the moment ever having got any girl in Columbia into trouble; and if I had, I do not think I would have mentioned it in Harold's bathtub because I would have remembered that Rhoda would not have liked it.\"\n\n\"Rhoda was at Watch Hill at the time,\" Tom said. \"You had no reason to worry about Rhoda.\"\n\n\"If Rhoda had been less at Watch Hill,\" Walter Price said, \"and more often in that dear old place of yours on Lexington Avenue, and later on Park, Rhoda might be here this minute, mightn't she?\"\n\nTom Harrow picked up the George the Second coffeepot. It had been with him on Lexington Avenue, but time was beginning to make it a less and less tangible object. He was only lately beginning to discover that one could reach an age when possessions could assume impermanence and lose intrinsic value as they mingled with associations.\n\n\"I don't think any trip to Watch Hill had much to do with anything,\" Tom Harrow said. \"But let's get back to our primary subject.\"\n\n\"What subject?\" Walter Price asked.\n\n\"The Price family,\" Tom Harrow said. \"You were talking about the Price family, weren't you?\"\n\n\"Was I being so egocentric?\" Walter said.\n\n\"You were being informative,\" Tom Harrow said, \"not egocentric, Walter.\"\n\nTheir glances met for a moment across the table.\n\n\"You grow increasingly dramatically constructive, Tom,\" Walter Price said. \"I'm sure I don't know how I ever got on the subject of the Prices, but it is, quite impersonally, interesting. A Price came over from Normandy with William the Conqueror. I am told, although I cannot confirm it momentarily, that he is depicted riding at the rear of the Duke in the Bayeux tapestry.\"\n\n\"Did he wear a nose guard?\" Tom Harrow asked.\n\n\"Strange you should mention that,\" Walter Price said. \"I had almost forgotten nose guards, but I wore one when I played left half at Groton, just before I went to Yale.\"\n\n\"I thought you went to Harrow after your Uncle Roderick made money in the DeBeers Syndicate,\" Tom Harrow said.\n\nNeither of them smiled since each was sufficiently considerate of the other to understand that revealed inaccuracy was not a laughing matter.\n\n\"I was popping in and out of several schools,\" Walter Price said, \"directly before I went to Yale. It's hard to keep them straight, but I did wear one of those rubber nose guards at Groton. I distinctly remember the taste of it.\"\n\n\"How could you taste it if it was on your nose?\" Tom Harrow asked.\n\n\"Part of it was in my mouth,\" Walter Price said. \"You must be nearly old enough to have worn a nose guard yourself, even if you didn't go to Groton.\"\n\n\"Well, let's skip it,\" Tom said, \"and tell me about the Price that came over with William the Conqueror.\"\n\nWalter sipped his coffee.\n\n\"His name was Sieur Monsarratt de Phryce. P-h-r-y-c-e. They spelt it that way in those days. Phryce.\"\n\n\"Why did they stop spelling it that way?\" Tom asked.\n\n\"The Phryce branch in England at the time of Charles the First changed it to Price after the beheading,\" Walter said, \"but my own direct ancestors accompanied the young prince to France. The de Phryce château was only a few kilometers northwest of Versailles. I was entertained there when I was a young lieutenant in World War I. Did I never tell you about the Château de Phryce?\"\n\n\"Not that I remember at the moment,\" Tom Harrow said. \"But then, you've had a full life, Walter.\"\n\n\"I very seldom mention the Château de Phryce to anyone,\" Walter said. \"It is painful to think about it, but General Pershing stopped there.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Tom Harrow said, \"if it's painful, don't feel you have to bring it up.\"\n\n\"It's quite all right, Tom,\" Walter Price said. \"All that is painful was the ending of the château. It was completely destroyed with my dear cousins in it by the first shot of the Big Bertha, when the Germans were endeavoring to get the range of Paris. It isn't sensible, of course, that I should be so moved, after the obliteration of so many monuments; but none were so personal to me in quite the same way, Tom. After all, when one comes to think of it, the course of any life is marked by its series of small ruins, at least in the region of human relationships. But then, one must create ruin in order to develop. One can't stand still, can one?\"\n\nThere was no doubt that occasionally Walter could exhibit a flash of wisdom. It was true, what he had said about ruins of human relationships. People grew away from each other, tastes changed, and nothing was ever static.\n\n\"A good case in point might be my friendship with the Duke of Windsor,\" Walter Price said. \"David was Prince of Wales at the time. We saw quite a lot of each other during World War I.\"\n\nWalter was off again. It was impossible that Walter should feel that anything he said could be believed--or was it? Tom Harrow could not be sure because Walter was the only psychopathic liar he had ever known over a long period of time. It might be possible that Walter could contrive to believe the figments of his own imagination, since they all started on some small platform of fact--and no one was wholly accurate when he talked about himself. It might even be that the palpable falsehoods of Walter Price contained their own peculiar currencies of truth. They indicated a divine sort of discontent. When you thought of it this way, there was a magnificent element in Walter's battle against reality, and his prevarications became part of literary tradition.\n\nWalter Price, when you came to think of it, was only doing to himself what the great Dumas had done to the real D'Artagnan in The Three Musketeers, but Walter Price was no Dumas. He was an agent who kept losing clients--a fat man in his sixties, with high blood pressure, traveling down to Ogunquit, Maine, to discuss the possible use of a client's play by a summer theatre; but he was doing the best he could and there was something heart-warming, almost gallant in the effort. The chances were a thousand to one that he had never met the Duke of Windsor, let alone the younger Prince of Wales, but there was still that thousandth chance. You might start to write off the Château de Phryce, but then there had been a Big Bertha.\n\nIn the last analysis there was a good deal to be said for that secondary school platitude about playing the game to the end. If you had been playing the game for a very long while, you became conditioned to it until you finally forgot embellishments and graces, and in the end facts were not so important as they used to be. Character in the end was about the only value left, and by disregarding fact, Walter Price had gained in character; yet he was meticulously reliable when it came to contracts and agreements--but then, he had to be.\n\nTom Harrow looked across the table to the window over the garden. Everything outside was fresh and delicately green because it was the end of May. The gentle pastel tints of the trees and bushes were a sign of renewal reminding him of a speech which his first producer, Arthur Higgins, had once made when presented with a silver tray by a grateful cast on the three hundredth performance of a play.\n\n\"This lovely gift,\" Arthur Higgins had said, \"will stimulate me to rededicate myself anew.\" Although these awful words were not useful in themselves, they evoked anew a picture of Arthur Higgins, now deceased, which went to prove that the distillation of fact was all that mattered.\n\nIt was spring. Decoration Day was just around the corner, and it occurred to Tom Harrow that this year he must positively make a visit to the family lot in the Upper Hill Cemetery. He would stand there looking at his parents' graves and muse on the inescapable fact of mortality, which was one fact that could not distill itself; but he would not resolve to rededicate himself anew. It was too late, because you only dedicated yourself once in a life time, and there was no such thing as rededication. And the worst of it was that you never really knew that you had genuinely dedicated yourself until long after you had done it.\n\n\"There's more coffee and bacon if you want them, Walter,\" Tom Harrow said. \"They are up there being kept at a constant temperature, like your friendship and mine. You are sure you don't want some more?\"\n\n\"Oh, no thanks, Tom,\" Walter said, \"and are you sure you don't mind my staying over tomorrow or the day after?\"\n\n\"It will be a pleasure, Walter,\" Tom answered. \"There will only be the family. But I hope you will excuse me for a while right now. I've got one or two things to do. I'm still worrying over finishing a third act, and I've got to call up Beechley in New York.\"\n\n\"I know that you and Ed are very close ever since the old Mort Sullivan days,\" Walter said, \"but it does seem to me, quite frankly, that Ed has been slipping in the last few years.\"\n\nIt was hard to tell whether or not Walter had heard something. You never knew exactly when you were on solid ground with Walter Price.\n\n\"We are all slipping, I suppose,\" Tom said, \"in our small, individual ways.\"\n\nIt was pleasant to realize that he was including himself in the slipping group only through courtesy, but the moment would arrive sometime and there could be no concealment.\n\n\"Are you sure Emily won't be bored if I stay?\" Walter Price asked.\n\n\"You know very well Emily is never bored,\" Tom Harrow said. \"That's the main reason why I married Emily.\"\n\n\"Oh, come now,\" Walter said, \"there were lots of other reasons.\"\n\nThe worst of it was that reasons were like the lilacs outside the window--they burgeoned and bloomed triumphantly and then went to seed. Villon had said something along those lines. Villon was a very able poet.\n\n\"The capacity for not being bored was one of the main reasons,\" Tom said, \"and someone, out of compassion, had to take her off the stage. But the point is that Emily is going to love your staying here awhile.\"\n\nHis glance traveled again around the dining room. The room and the whole house were the result of his having been director and producer as well as a playwright. It was inevitable that the place should have the perfection and the atmosphere of a stage set. Suddenly, because thoughts moved oddly sometimes, he found his mind writing stage directions:\n\nThe curtain rises on the Harrow dining room at a quarter before ten o'clock of a late May morning. The pale but glorious sunlight of a New England spring filters through window at L; through its small panes one glimpses dewy lilacs in bud and the fresh foliage of a copper beech. The dining room itself is austere New England of the early nineteenth century, as is accurately indicated by its delicate moldings and the truly beautiful mantelpiece at R. The wallpaper is authentic French pictorial, showing the conventional scene of shipwrecked Ulysses encountering Nausicaa and her maidens. The furniture, Chippendale, purchased in the great days of Christie's, is worthy of this restrained and beautiful background, markedly the fine screen concealing the pantry door, and the hunting board acquired from an Irish castle. Hot plates for a comfortable breakfast stand on its meticulously waxed surface. Obviously the owner of this dining room has a sharp eye for detail. Seated, at the rising of the curtain, one discovers WALTER PRICE, corpulent, loquacious, in his mid-sixties; and his younger host, THOMAS HARROW, director and playwright, turned fifty--a spare man, carefully dressed, with an air about him showing that he is up from New York and not indigenous to this expensively acquired background. There is a sound of footsteps (the clattering of mules) on a staircase offstage at R. EMILY, third wife of THOMAS HARROW, ash-blond and plumply late-thirtyish, in a gold brocade housecoat, enters at R. Though it is only ten in the morning, she wears a number of exceedingly heavy gold bracelets, a diamond-and-sapphire clip, and three diamond rings. One gains the impression that Emily carries as much as she possibly can on her person in case things may become difficult again.\n\nTom Harrow had learned never to discount coincidence. He could never remember whether the scenario had flashed through his mind before or after he had heard Emily's mules on the stairs outside. But there she was, entering at R, with the housecoat and exactly the correct amount of jewelry, smelling of bath salts and Chanel No. 5, and with her hair done in the new way that she had picked up from that place in the sixties, just off Park Avenue, run by that new little man about whom Rita had told her the last time Rita or someone else had come East from Hollywood.\n\n\"Good morning, everybody,\" Emily said. \"And it is a good morning, isn't it?\"\n\nNo one could have written a better entrance line. Tom pushed back his chair, crossed to the right and kissed her lightly.\n\n\"Ummm, dearest,\" Emily said.\n\nShe had made the same humming noise the first time he had ever kissed her, and she still did it, and somehow the sound was never as perfunctory as it should have been.\n\n\"Walter and I were both wondering where you were, dear,\" Tom said. \"We were hoping rather desperately that you would join us at breakfast--but better late than never.\"\n\n\"Oh, I would have, Tom,\" Emily said, \"except I do know when to efface myself, don't I? I knew you and Walter wanted to have one of your good long talks. I can read all Tom's expressions now, Walter. The thing to notice is that teensy-weensy wrinkle just above Tom's nose. Whenever it deepens, I've done something wrong, and it deepened the last time I interrupted you and Walter, Tom, and why shouldn't it have? I was being selfish. Tom is possessive about his old friends, Walter, just the way he ought to be.\"\n\n\"Walter is staying for a few days, dear,\" Tom said.\n\n\"Oh, splendid,\" Emily said. \"Then I will have a chance to see Walter, and so will Harold. Is Harold down yet?\"\n\n\"No, not yet,\" Tom answered.\n\nEmily seated herself at the foot of the table. Her brocade housecoat rustled discreetly, and her bracelets, as she put her elbows on the table, made a comfortable, solid sound.\n\n\"Stepmothers are always horrid, aren't they?\" she said, and her brown eyes turned appealingly to Walter Price. Her ash-blond hair and her brown eyes were the combination, as Arthur Higgins had often said, that got Emily through the outer office, and they still were so beautiful that they frequently made one forget the beginnings of her double chin.\n\n\"I hate to be a prying stepmother, Tom,\" she said, \"but Harold came in very late last night, and I don't see what there is for him to do in this poky little town. Not that it isn't a dear town.\"\n\n\"She means it's dear because I lived here once, Walter,\" Tom Harrow said, \"and Emily's middle name is Loyalty. Emily Loyalty Harrow. She added it the moment she dropped her maiden name.\"\n\n\"Why, darling,\" Emily said, \"you say the sweetest things sometimes, so unexpectedly, and you've never said that one to me before. He really hasn't, Walter. There's always something new every minute when you're the handmaiden to a genius.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" Tom said. \"Each day you must rededicate yourself anew, and let's not mind about Harold's late hours. Besides, it is very patient of him, and gracious, to be here with us.\"\n\n\"Darling,\" Emily said, \"I adore having Harold, and you know I always have, ever since he first appeared in my life as a gangling, pouty little boy from Groton.\"\n\n\"Don't speak disparagingly of Groton, dear,\" Tom Harrow said. \"It's one of Walter's alma maters.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Emily said, \"I never knew you went to Groton, Walter. You've never acted like a Grotonian. And coming from me, that's a compliment, darling.\"\n\n\"He went there,\" Tom said, \"and he wore a nose guard.\"\n\nEmily dissolved into soft laughter. Her laugh was still beguiling, and she usually knew when to use it.\n\n\"Oh dear,\" she said, \"I never can tell when Tom is going to be funny. It still creeps up and pounces, just the way it did the first time I met him at dear old Arthur Higgins's apartment. Age cannot wither nor custom stale thy infinite variety.\"\n\n\"That's a very apt quotation, Emily,\" Walter Price said. \"I've often applied it to Tom myself, but never out loud.\"\n\n\"She must have been browsing in the library, although the quotation is not quite correct,\" Tom said, \"and stumbled over a loose Bartlett. And I have another one for you, dear. If you keep reading Bartlett, 'Get thee to a nunnery'--also William Shakespeare.\"\n\nEmily laughed again.\n\n\"Darling,\" she said, \"isn't this a nunnery enough--being away in this poky old house for the next three months or so? I don't mean that I don't love it, and that I don't love the creative improvements you've made on it. Sometimes I say to myself that it is one of your best stage arrangements. It's almost like a revival of Berkeley Square.\"\n\nHe had never been able to get over feeling a sharp surprise when Emily startled him. The experience was still like running into a door in the dark.\n\n\"That's a very valid observation, dear,\" he said, \"and I know what you mean. But after all, we're both in the theatre, and if you've been in the theatre long enough I suppose you can't help becoming theatrical. I admit I'm theatrical, and Walter here is, too. Somehow you can't stop attitudinizing, even when you're at home.\"\n\n\"Oh, Tom,\" Emily said, \"I didn't intend a single thing I said to be a criticism. I just love the whole house, and I know you do your best work here, and I know how you enjoy the atmosphere, and I'm beginning to enjoy it myself more and more each year--the cemetery and the streets and everything, and the small-town-boy-who-made-good part of it. But you will admit it is such a little puddle for such a big frog, dear, and you are big in any puddle.\"\n\nThere was no reason why Emily should have liked the house or the town, since she was unfitted for both by training and predilection. He was only irritated because she was obviously trying to solicit the sympathy of Walter Price. He wished that Emily would stop soliciting sympathy, but she always had--and from the most unlikely quarters.\n\n\"It isn't a puddle,\" he said; \"it's an environment, my dear.\"\n\nHe was relieved when the pantry door opened, because Emily, once she started, always found it difficult to drop a subject. It was Alfred, the colored houseman, in his gray alpaca coat--a sign that it was morning. In the evening he wore a fresh white coat, and there was no reason why he should not have looked well on the wages that he and his wife were receiving as a couple. There were times when Emily expressed a suspicion that Ruth was not Alfred's wife, but if Ruth went where Alfred went, so far away from town, her adaptability overcame possible moral turpitude.\n\n\"Mr. Dodd asks if he might see you in the garden, Mr. Harrow,\" Alfred said.\n\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People would have been delighted by Alfred's voice, which had no hint of Dixie in it. Alfred was a highly educated man for whom Tom Harrow felt a personal and professional respect. If you wanted a scene in the White House, with a colored butler like the one who had appeared in a Sherwood war play, or if you wanted a gentle colored professor in a sequence of quiet social significance, there was no reason to look further. Alfred had a fine, high forehead, deep-set, sensitive eyes, and the delicate hands of an artist. It was incredible that what Emily said she had discovered could be true--that Alfred and Ruth daily used up a fifth of bourbon from the liquor closet and that Alfred made two surreptitious calls to New York each day so that he could play the numbers. On the whole, Tom Harrow condoned both these facts, because Emily never had been able to get on with servants--but Alfred and Ruth were able to understand her.\n\n\"Thank you, Alfred,\" he said, and he smiled affectionately at Emily and Walter Price. \"I'm afraid I'll have to leave you two alone until lunchtime. There's the garden and then there are some calls to New York.\"\n\n\"Tom, dear,\" Emily said, \"I wish you wouldn't force yourself into this routine. We've hardly settled in and we never seem to have any time to do anything together.\"\n\n\"I know, dear,\" Tom said. \"I realize I'm always saying and hoping that I'll have some leisure on my hands here, and then duty obtrudes itself; but I'm sure, this year, that things will quiet down.\"\n\n\"I know you have to keep on paying alimony,\" Emily said, \"to that Laura Hopedale, who doesn't need it, and besides, you support Harold and...\"\n\nTom raised his hand deliberately. Emily never could learn the value of reticence or when it was time to stop if she had an interested audience, and possibly it paid her not to learn.\n\n\"Tell Walter the rest after I've gone, dear,\" he said. \"Don't be hurt with me, but I think I know what else you're going to say.\"\n\nHe seldom needed to wonder what Emily was going to say. The unreality of the theatre world had descended heavily upon the breakfast scene. It was no wonder that people in the theatre found it hard to get on with outsiders and ended by clinging together in self-defense. Most of their lives were conducted in disproportionate make-believe, and dramatic effect was actually an unnatural phenomenon requiring years of cultivation. The gesture and the word that interested an audience across the footlights were peculiar deviations from ordinary life. A special talent was required to select such technicalities. No wonder the conversation in the dining room had been off the normal beat. No wonder the house was decorated with large, bold strokes, and no wonder he was not the man he used to be. He had lived so long with flamboyant personalities, had been obliged to cope so long with what was called artistic temperament, and had been compelled to deal so long and charmingly and patiently with actors' and actresses' stupidities, that of course his own character had changed.\n\nII. It's Always Fair Weather, Even without a Stein, When Good Fellows Get Together\n\nIt was not consoling to realize that he had been a ham actor in his sequence with Emily at the breakfast table, bidding for laughs and sympathy from a nonexistent audience. And now Jack, of Dodd's Arborists and Landscaping Service, was waiting for him in the garden. This fact in itself had its dramatic significance although it might be lacking in audience appeal. He and Jack Dodd, when in school together, had competed for the affections of the same girl, and he had often wondered what would have happened if Jack Dodd had not won the competition. It had been so long ago that they were now almost strangers, and yet you could not be wholly a stranger to anyone in a small town where you had once lived. The surface of the town had changed as much as he had; the business had once been called Dodd's Nursery. Now it was Dodd's Arborists and Landscaping Service, but the undertones were there. A new pickup truck labeled Dodd's Arborists and Landscaping Service stood in the driveway in front of the old stable, which had been turned into a garage many years before.\n\nIt would have been a desecration to change any part of the garden, which had been designed just after the house was built in the first decade of the 1800's. He had only tried, as he had with the house, to put it back in its original condition. Everyone, including members of the Garden Clubs of America, had called the final result a notable achievement, and, in spite of the professional advice he had received, he could give himself most of the credit. He had always disliked a sloppy stage set and he was increasingly critical of the best stage designers. He had treated the weed-grown garden like a stage, yet with respect for the original architect, a Frenchman exiled by Napoleon, according to tradition. The summerhouse, or gazebo, not far from the crumbling brick wall, told more of that forgotten landscape artist than any of his box-bordered paths. Even in its ruined stage it had the spirit of the Regency and he knew from the moment he saw it that he must exercise great care in reconstruction. He had been uncompromisingly particular that nothing was planted that could not have grown there more than a few years after the sea-fight between the Constitution and the Java. It was the end of May and things would look better in a week or so, but spring would be gone by then. Now in the morning light the garden was full of hope, and though he was against pathetic fallacy, he could believe it was grateful to him for its renewal.\n\nThere was only one thing about it that marred his satisfaction--the remark that Emily had made about Berkeley Square. The reconstruction had been too meticulous, too self-consciously removed from the present. It was not a formal garden; instead it was a horticultural museum, and now the discovery appalled him. What was it in him that made him desire to recreate something that time had erased? Obviously his desire for self-expression represented some form of escape, but still he could not understand from what he was escaping. If the effort represented an intense desire for order, he could not understand the compulsion, because his life had been orderly--or had it? Perhaps he had been seeking peace of mind, although he should have known that doing over a house and garden was a childish way to achieve it.\n\nJack Dodd was standing on the yellow graveled walk almost in the center of the garden. There was something puzzling about his expression when Tom first saw him. You could not tell whether he approved or disapproved or whether he was simply making a mental financial estimate. His shoulders were bent forward and his face had a tanned, outdoor look. The pockets of his blue serge suit bulged with a Dodd catalogue and order blanks and there was a smear of lime dust on his left shoulder.\n\n\"Hello, Jack,\" Tom Harrow said.\n\n\"Hello, Tom,\" Jack Dodd said. \"You're looking good.\"\n\nThere must have been some sort of reverse explanation of why he was pleased that Jack Dodd should call him Tom. It struck Tom Harrow that morning, as it had before, how curious it was that he could never be wholly at ease with Jack Dodd or with other of his contemporaries there in town, when he could deal with people in any other place in the world adroitly, affably, and without the slightest sense of strain. He had once tried to get things down to an easier basis by asking Jack Dodd into the house for a drink. He should have known that Jack would not have fitted into the setting, and Alfred, carrying a Georgian tray, had not helped. When Jack Dodd had asked for a shot of rye and some water as a chaser, Alfred had been obliged to go back for another glass suitable for a shot. There had been no rapprochement and no new basis.\n\nIronically, Tom Harrow could hear himself saying at dinner parties in the neighborhood of Park Avenue that the most useful thing that had ever befallen him was a public school education in a small New England town. And why was it he was grateful for this benefit? He was grateful because he could rub shoulders with people in every echelon of life, understand their problems and speak their language. And basically perhaps this concept was still true, except that the echelons had been changing since he was a schoolboy. What, he wondered that morning, did Jack Dodd actually think of him? There was a type of friendliness in Jack's glance, and curiosity, but also a broad indifference. Undoubtedly Jack Dodd was thinking that this Tom Harrow had picked up a lot of slick tricks and bad habits since the old days, and you had to watch things you did not understand.\n\n\"Well, it certainly is good to see you, Jack,\" Tom Harrow said. \"How have things been all winter?\"\n\n\"I can't complain, Tom,\" Jack Dodd said. \"The snow hung on longer than usual, but it made up for the dry spring.\"\n\n\"I hope Malvina got through the winter all right,\" Tom Harrow said. He had nearly forgotten that expression, \"getting through the winter,\" but its meaning had come back to him. Malvina was Jack Dodd's wife, and there was no reason whatsoever why he should not refer to her as Malvina, although when he did so to her face she very often became embarrassed and called him \"Mr. Harrow.\"\n\n\"Malvina is all right, except for that hip of hers,\" Jack Dodd said. \"It used to be called rheumatism, but now it's arthritis. It's getting so it's hard to keep up with these new names for diseases and flowers. Isn't that so, Tom?\"\n\nIt seemed to Tom Harrow that Jack Dodd had stuck out his neck slightly more than usual by ending his speech with a question.\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear that, Jack,\" he said. \"I was talking to a doctor in New York only the other day about arthritis and I understand they're coming up now with one of these new wonder drugs that's better than cortisone. I'll let you know when I hear some more about it.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Tom,\" Jack Dodd said, \"I'd appreciate hearing. You look as though you'd come through the winter all right yourself. You didn't get that coat of tan sitting around New York.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Tom Harrow said. \"As a matter of fact, Emily and I took off for a while to the West Indies in March.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" Jack Dodd said. \"The West Indies.\"\n\nSooner or later they would get down to business, but it would not look well to be brusque and, besides, at any cost Tom Harrow did not want to appear patronizing.\n\n\"How's that pretty daughter of yours getting along, Jack?\" he asked. \"What's her name? I'm getting worse and worse with names... Irene?\"\n\nThere was a change in Jack Dodd's expression. You could not tell whether it was paternal pride or amusement, but the change was appreciable.\n\n\"Reenie's doing fine,\" Jack Dodd said. \"You know, she started in at Mount Holyoke College.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" Tom Harrow said. \"Well, that's fine.\"\n\nHe tried to evoke a mental picture of Irene, but she was only a name to him.\n\n\"But she's like her old man,\" Jack Dodd said, \"no good at books, and she's back home now. Maybe Harold told you.\"\n\n\"Harold?\" Tom Harrow said, and he was ashamed that his voice sounded sharp.\n\n\"He was over to the house last night,\" Jack Dodd said, \"taking Irene to the pictures.\"\n\n\"I guess he came back late,\" Tom Harrow said, \"after my bedtime, anyway. But that doesn't mean much. I always get sleepy here.\"\n\n\"The garden looks good, doesn't it?\" Jack Dodd said. \"Seems as if everything came through except a couple of the azaleas.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Tom Harrow said. \"I hope you're well enough fixed for help so you can take it over again this season, Jack. Aside from your knowing a lot more about it than I do, it would be nice seeing you around.\"\n\nHe was disturbed when the business talk was over. He could not understand, when Jack Dodd continued on the subject of Irene, whether Jack was amused or worried. He could not understand how Harold had met Irene Dodd. It was a piece of information, but he wished that he knew whether Jack Dodd had intended it as such.... At any rate, Dodd's Arborists and Landscaping Service agreed to take care of the garden.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe house stood on the town's main residential street on a ridge of high ground sloping gradually down to the river. It was one of a row of houses which had been built in the best McIntire tradition by the town's local shipwrights for the more prominent shipowners, in the days when the town had been a seaport. There was a marked similarity in the architecture of those houses, in cupola and cornice and in the arch of the doorways, and their interior plans were the same--the broad hall that stretched from the front door to the back, the two front parlors, the back parlor, and the dining room, the broad staircases and landings leading to the bedchambers on the second and third stories--but the finish of no two was alike. They had been built pretentiously for large families. The plots of land on which they stood with their shade trees and gardens had run back to the stables and coach houses that represented a mode of living which no longer existed. There were very few people left in town who could afford any longer to keep up the houses on Johnson Street. In Tom Harrow's memory, several of them had fallen into a state of hideous disrepair, but their owners had clung to them so tenaciously that it was still difficult to buy a house in the row and it still meant something, even in a changing world, to live on this main street. In spite of increasing motor traffic, the row had a conspicuousness which must have been brash and arrogant when the houses were new, but which had been mellowed by time, without wholly disappearing. Johnson Street might become a thoroughfare of funeral and tourist homes eventually, but even then it would retain its dignity, and perhaps, it occurred to Tom Harrow, dignity in the end was all that mattered--and he wished very much that this fact had registered with him a number of years ago. Unfortunately, you seldom think of dignity at the appropriate period of life.\n\nWhen the Saebury house on Johnson Street had come on the market, he had not hesitated to buy it at the asking price, even though he knew the decision was not practical. He knew he was indulging in a sort of pretentiousness which he should have outgrown after he had become inured to Broadway openings. He knew he was not fooling anyone when he came back and bought the Saebury house on Johnson Street. He did not belong there, but still he had not hesitated. It had been a gesture that was entirely personal. When Emily asked him why he had done it, he had produced the quotation about the weariest river winding somewhere safe to sea--but this was a superficial explanation. He had bought the house on Johnson Street because, instinctively, he had not wished to see it fall to pieces. He had bought it and restored it out of a sense of obligation; but if anyone had asked him obligation to what, he would not have been able to answer. The obligation was still upon him at the moment. He should not have left New York in late May--but there he was, because he had wanted to see the garden. He had no regrets for the impulse when he walked from the garden around the house to the front door and saw the restored wood fence and the brick sidewalks of Johnson Street. He had no regrets, but he wished that he could fully understand his motivation. He was always accurate about the motivation of characters in a play, but he was seldom as successful in recognizing his own, and perhaps no one was ever wholly successful along these lines.\n\nIt was getting to be time to call New York but there was still a margin of leisure since nothing around him synchronized with New York. Ed Beechley was customarily in the office at 10:30, but it was safer to wait until eleven because Ed Beechley was one of those people who always believed that being late to the office and unavailable, indicated position, and Ed, like other people who had come up the hard way, was careful of position. Tom knew also that it would not be a good day for work, with Walter Price in the house. If he was to put finishing touches on the last act of the play on which he was working, he needed an interval of time unbroken by interruptions. It had always seemed to him that he could manage such a schedule after he had bought and renovated the house, and he was still sure that he would get things started, particularly if Emily should leave to visit someone, as she was very apt to do after a week or ten days of quiet. In the meanwhile, before calling up the Beechley office, he might walk downtown for the mail--not that he could not have sent someone--but he enjoyed the walk.\n\nHis hat and the key to the mailbox were both on the front-hall table and the shortest way to reach them was to walk up the steps of the front portico with its graceful Corinthian columns and push down the heavy brass latch of the Saebury front door. The door with its eight panels was fashioned from Santo Domingo mahogany that might have been carried north on one of the Saebury ships. It had been painted at some period but now the paint was off and the door had been rubbed and oiled. There had been no settling of sill or foundation in the Saebury house. The mahogany door swung inward as easily and quietly as it had for more than a hundred years, revealing the hall and stairway with its beautifully turned balusters. No amount of investigation had been able to tell him who the designer of the house had been. He was certain it had not been McIntire. The stairs and the proportion of the hall did not have the McIntire touch. They were lighter and more spare, indicating as surely as print that the town had once been famous for its shipyards.\n\nThe unknown designer had no doubt been an artisan who had taken time off from the yards to draw the Saebury plans, but the instinct for space and proportion was the reflection of a definite personality. He had obviously been plagued by a series of intolerances, traces of which still remained in the Saebury hall. He had been intolerant of waste or clumsiness, and his honesty or his professional pride had made him intolerant of careless work. Beyond his conscientiousness had lain an appreciation of beauty, and with it, perhaps, a sense of revolt against his own environment--because the town must have been grim and cold in the days when the Saebury house had been conceived. The whole hall was a revolt and a craving for luxury which its builder had never known. It was easy to make these deductions, but something unspecified in the Saebury house showed that its builder's mind was a dawn-of-the-nineteenth-century mind, attuned to past difficulties which social historians might attempt to analyze but could not resurrect. Tom Harrow realized that if it were possible to meet the builder face to face they would not have understood each other. What one would have thought was remarkable, the other would have thought was natural. The creation of taste was based upon such obvious momentary desires that a simple mind did not have to analyze them. The builders of the new split-level ranch types that were sprouting up along the new highways doubtless were all obeying a modern impetus without being bothered by thought. The builder of the Saebury house would have been an unrewarding social contact, but there was no doubt that he had known his trade. Beneath the angle of the staircase, so much of which was waste space but all of which added to the sense of the hallway's ease and depth, came the dining room door, and the dining room door stood open. As Tom Harrow closed the front door, he could hear Emily's voice raised to its confidential, earnest note--a tone which indicated, even before he overheard the words, that she was trying to tell her side of a difficulty to Walter Price, and trying also to enlist his support.\n\n\"He never told me a thing about it, Walter darling,\" she was saying. \"He simply presented it as an accomplished fact; and now, here we are, uprooted merely because of a whim, and now after two years of building-up and tearing-down and living in a sort of madhouse, not really knowing where we were living, I honestly believe he's getting restless again. I honestly do believe so, Walter. It isn't as though he really had roots here. He only came here when he was fifteen, and just stayed awhile with his mother's sister, who must have been a very poky old spinster, according to her photographs. You know how sentimental Tom is. You can see her picture in the library. I do not believe that Tom was deliberately thoughtless when he moved me here without a by-your-leave. As a matter of fact, Tom has always been very sweet to me, right from the beginning. He was so desperately lonely, Walter, when we first met. He was so appealing--just like a little boy, and I think you, like everyone else, will say that his work has improved enormously. I will only say that Tom is forgetful, and of course he is enormously sensitive, Walter, actually to the point of emotional instability. But what I cannot understand is why, with his sensitivity, this place shouldn't give him the creeps in exactly the way it does me. I know the guest room is charming and everything's like the American Wing in the Metropolitan, but it still is creepy. It's all been cleaned and everything. It doesn't smell or anything, but I can't get over the feeling that lots of people have lived here and have had babies and everything. Somehow you don't have a sense of privacy--not nearly as much as you get in any apartment on Park Avenue, or even, say, in a cottage at Easthampton. Walter, I don't know if you've noticed, but there really isn't any room for bathrooms...\"\n\nThe only reason he was eavesdropping was because it would have been needlessly embarrassing if they had heard him in the hall. There was nothing novel in any of Emily's remarks, all of which moved in the pattern of an old sequence. Her mind had a retentive quality that never permitted her to forget her obvious observations. In time, these formed tape-recordings that could be rewound and replayed by a chance word or observation; and he was quite sure that Emily did not know how frequently she repeated herself, and was unaware of her growing loquacity. It was not her fault that the old recording would start as soon as a particular thought struck her, and now she was on the subject of bathrooms.\n\n\"Of course there was plumbing in the house before Tom bought it,\" she was saying. \"There was a zinc-lined bathtub in the servants' ell, and a family bathroom at the end of the upstairs hall that even Tom said was more interesting than that all-copper bathroom that was once exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art. Well, there just wasn't any space for more bathrooms, and Tom and the architect just had to dream up places so that the proportions of the bedrooms would not be disturbed. Now, I've always liked a good bathroom, and I don't like to be a contortionist getting in and out of a tub.\"\n\nShe paused and laughed in the informal tone she used when she was asking someone to share her little joke. He could remember that he had once been intrigued by Emily's laughter. Standing there detachedly in the hall, he could still recognize that it was attractive--but Emily was going on.\n\n\"Do you know where Tom's bathroom is?\" she asked. \"It's in a little niche called a prayer-closet! They thought more about prayer than about keeping clean, in Federalist America. That's only a joke, Walter. I've had my nose rubbed in Federalist America by now and I know that plumbing was not invented then, although they used to have it in Roman villas or what have you, and maybe Tom is right when I take up what he calls my Bath Routine, and when he says that the world might be better off if there were more praying and less plumbing. But when you come to think of it, Walter, India doesn't seem to be very well off, does it, where they have no plumbing at all and millions of prayer wheels and what have you?\"\n\nHe had never heard the one about the prayer wheels before, but in any play that had a long run actors kept adding to their routine. He was wrong in fearing that Emily was moving off at a tangent. The prayer wheels were only a brief diversion.\n\n\"Tom is forever talking about motivation,\" she was saying, \"and I suppose there was some motivation when he put this show on the road. But what do you suppose it was, Walter--to move here, when we had that lovely house on the dunes at Easthampton? I think in some ways he's full of free guilt because he didn't consult me the way he does about everything else. Do you suppose he was trying to escape from something? And if so--what? I really don't think he's looked at another woman since we were married, not that they don't keep looking at Tom--and they should, because he gets more and more attractive all the time; and that reducing and massage man who worked on him in the apartment three mornings a week all through the winter has honestly done wonders. I have had a thought that it is my predecessor that he was trying to escape from--Laura Hopedale, I mean. I don't blame his feeling bitter about her after the way she literally took him to the cleaners and then never offered to change the agreement, when I understand her Mr. Number 4 is worth literally trillions. Of course I didn't understand about these things, having only just come from Indiana--only a starry-eyed Hoosier girl, darling--when I first met Tom at dear old Arthur's. Tom was truly desperate, and you know, though he's miles older than I am, he does have that little-boy quality.... I don't see how so many men retain it after middle age--especially American men. I've never seen Frenchmen with wistful little-boy qualities, have you? Nor Englishmen, except young transplanted poet ones, who don't really count for any number of reasons.... Oh, dear me, where was I?\"\n\nWhere was Emily, indeed? Off the rails on the curve of her own garrulity, but he had never heard her ask before where she was. It showed that Emily had lived so long that she, too, was beginning to forget, even though she was correctly miles younger than he. It was true that he had told her his troubles that night at Arthur Higgins's, but he was damned if he had told them in a little-boy way, or if he had a little-boy quality, either. It was too late to cough or make any sound in the hall by now, because if she were to know that he had overheard her it would only cause an unnecessarily difficult moment for them both. The point still was: where was Emily? Taken from the angle of their relationship, it was honestly quite a question.\n\n\"You were talking very charmingly and cogently,\" he heard Walter Price say, \"about the immaturity of American men. I can agree with you completely. Having been educated in England and the Continent, after a carefree childhood in Columbia, South Carolina, I have the advantage of a very real perspective...\"\n\n\"I know that I was talking about immaturity,\" Emily said, and her voice had assumed an unexpectedly compelling quality. She could stop anyone talking--even Walter Price--if she wanted to make a point. \"But what was it that I was talking about before that?\"\n\n\"About Tom's second wife, I think,\" Walter said, \"and you were on the ever-painful subject of alimony. Between you and me, I disapproved of Laura from the first moment, and I did my best to warn Tom. I spoke to him in a very man-to-man way. Indeed, I went right to the mat about it, out of sheer affection. 'Why get married again?' I said. 'Isn't one experience enough? Why not follow the wiser precept of loving them and leaving them?' Now I had a great advantage over Tom, of course, of having followed for a lifetime a quite unattainable romance. I don't know whether I ever told you, Emily....\"\n\nObviously the time had arrived to create an interruption by a cough or a careless footstep, but Emily's voice cut in again.\n\n\"Of course I was just a little starry-eyed Hoosier girl,\" Emily was saying. Tom had tried to induce her to drop that phrase, but had never succeeded. In fact, lately she was using it more and more regularly. \"But still I told Tom at the time not to put up with that agreement for a moment. Of course there weren't any grounds, or Tom didn't want to sue on grounds. He's so utterly frivolous sometimes and so beguilingly American, but thank goodness women don't have to conform to chivalry, do they? I know what a traumatic experience it was for Tom, facing marital difficulties a second time, and I think that a sensitive, artistic spirit like Tom's magnifies everything much more than we pedestrian people can realize. Do you know what I've often thought? I've often thought, thank heaven Tom isn't able to bear a child. He would distort the trauma out of all proportions.... But I really don't think he moved here to run away from Laura Hopedale. I think, on the contrary, he came here to run after someone--not a reality so much as a memory. It's Tom's incorrigibly romantic streak.\"\n\nHer voice stopped. When Emily was on the stage, her timing had left much to be desired; but occasionally she knew when to stop, and this was a correct moment, when everything was hanging in dramatic balance, and even Walter Price's mind was off himself, which indicated a considerable achievement.\n\n\"I don't quite follow you, my dear,\" he said. \"I've known Tom to pursue a number of projects very assiduously, but never a memory. What sort of memory?\"\n\nThere was another pause. If he had been directing the scene himself, he would have insisted on this silent beat of time at just this point.\n\n\"I know it may sound fantastic,\" Emily said, \"but every human being is fantastic in some department, isn't he? If you were to ask me, I think Tom's come here because of old memories of Rhoda.\"\n\nNow and then Emily could still surprise him. Emily's monologues might continue by the hour. You might be fighting off drowsiness or the ultimate of boredom, when suddenly she would hit on something. It might be only the fabrication of a chain of inaccuracies, but Emily had her own qualities of perception. He was surprised to discover that he was startled simply because his first wife's name had been mentioned by his third wife, but then, perhaps if you had ever been closely associated with anyone, you might start at her name. You never could tell about memory. Take the memory of a horse, for instance, that caused him invariably to balk or shy at a certain turn on a riding trail simply because something had occurred there once that had shaken him... But Emily was speaking again.\n\n\"You see, I don't think he's ever lived-down Rhoda. Hasn't someone said, some poet or someone, that a first love is never over?\"\n\nHer voice dropped almost to a whisper, another effect which had been achieved by the teaching of Arthur Higgins, who had always had a weakness for the old Belasco school. But one should never discount techniques simply because they are timeworn, and Emily did not pause too long.\n\n\"I don't mean that he hasn't lived her down in a practical sense. Tom has always been a great liver-downer--the 'here today, gone tomorrow' school. An artist has to be, or else his sensitivity would kill him, and Tom is a creative artist, no matter how annoyed he gets when someone tells him so. Of course Tom is one of those people who would have been good at anything. Did you know he was positively brilliant in the war? Well, my only point is that a man who can turn his hand to anything must be a great liver-downer, but he hasn't ever got over Rhoda. Walter... it frightens me... just a little.\"\n\nArthur Higgins had worked hard on Emily. Arthur had undoubtedly thought, as others had, that anyone with her figure, combined with brown eyes and ash-blond hair, could develop a stage presence, given instruction--and the instruction had not been wholly wasted. You could believe Emily was frightened a little, and once again she did not pause long enough to risk an interruption.\n\n\"Walter...\" Her voice was higher, but bravely controlled, eloquently pleading. \"I wish you'd use your influence to get him to move somewhere else. There's something wrong about it all, Walter. His preoccupations here are somewhat weird, Walter, and I feel like a shadow. I'm subconsciously rejected, and it's very dreadful to be rejected by a memory. I never realized that it could be so dreadful....\"\n\nEmily had the faculty of making many things difficult, and now she had done it again. It was now no longer possible to interrupt her discourse. To have done so would have trespassed on hospitality by embarrassing Walter Price. Also, as he had learned by now, any relationship, more especially one established between man and wife, was based in part on the uncatalogued facts one never faced or discussed, and Emily's habit of telling her most private troubles was beyond discussion. It was better to pretend that Emily was the soul of discretion as she always said she was. It would now cause Emily needless pain and confusion if she were to find that he had been listening in the hall, and life was hard enough without deliberately causing pain. It was necessary to tiptoe softly to the front door and his admiration for the long-dead builders of the house increased with every furtive step.\n\nThe hall, as was customary in that ancient, brash era when the house was built, had been floored with native white pine. These broad boards had been protected for generations by various forms of carpeting, so that now, having been scraped and oiled, they were in excellent condition. Not a board creaked beneath his tread, but, if one had, it might not have mattered. Emily's voice had risen to a controlled but louder level.\n\n\"Walter, dear,\" she was saying, \"you know what a respect Tom has always had for your opinion. He has a great many acquaintances, but not many friends, and you are a friend--a friend of both of us.\"\n\nThis was another expression that Emily had taken up recently--A Friend of Both of Us--and one could tell very readily what she meant. A Friend of Both of Us meant someone whom Emily could use conveniently in order to get her husband to do something that he might have been reluctant to do otherwise.\n\n\"All he needs is someone to get him interested in something new, Walter,\" she was saying. \"You know how restless and questing Tom always is, and I don't think his play is doing well, either. He always shuts up like a clam when I ask him about his work. Work is a part of him he always insulates from me like a bamboo curtain, although darling Arthur used to say that I had a highly acute dramatic critical sense. Walter dear, I still have instinct even if he never tells me anything. He's worried about the play and I'll tell you something else, Walter. Between you and me, and I've never mentioned this to another soul, I think Tom is growing professionally afraid. You know that dreadful fear that comes over everyone in the theatre at some point, Walter--that sort of professional doubt--the discovery that he is just a little behind the tempo of today. Tom's wonderful. I know it, Walter--but then, there's Tennessee Williams. I just know there's something that worries Tom--something new he can't touch. I wish you could have seen his face at The Cat on the Hot Tin Roof. It was enigmatic, Walter, and sad, and I've never breathed this to another soul. What he needs is a change, Walter, and not living in a doll's house and questing back into the past. It's Rhoda, Walter, the memory of Rhoda that's making him uncertain; and if you could just speak to him, Walter...\"\n\nThe gentle click of the front-door latch was not audible over Emily's voice.\n\nHe was on the steps again in that gentle May sun. He knew that his face was flushed, and it should not have been. He had only heard again what he had known already. He knew that Emily disliked the place and that for years she had let him down in subtle ways in order to build herself up, but something new had been added simply because of overhearing. Emily always came upon realities with glancing blows, juggling half-truths and quarter-truths. There was something to be said for her interpretation of Rhoda. There was some truth in the competitive fear but she should have known that one lived always with the fear that one might never write again. It was a common occupational disease, yet when you heard someone else say it, the shock was a little like hearing your own voice on a tape-recorder with tones you barely recognized, or suddenly seeing your face unexpectedly in a mirror. Such experiences always showed that there was a lot you did not know about yourself. At any rate, the old saying was true: nothing you ever overheard about yourself was ever favorable. How right the rule was never to listen at open doors, or closed ones, either.\n\nIII. It's Always Old Home Week in Any Old Home Town\n\nHe had not intended to go to the office until after he had called downtown for the mail; but, once he had closed the front door, he found himself walking not toward the street but back past the cutting and vegetable garden to where the old coach house had stood. He had recognized, years ago, the utter futility of maintaining any serious working quarters in any house in which he lived. No matter what rules one might make against interruptions, they were always being broken; and, even if they were not, there was always something in the house to stimulate his curiosity--voices in the hall, the ring of the doorbell, or a crash of glass in the pantry. It was hard enough at best to concentrate, without having the extraneous appear suddenly to blot out some chain of thought; and also, in the house, there was a continuous battle between the sexes. Women, from his experience, preferred having a man beneath their thumbs, if such a thing was possible. It was true, of course, that most women--wives of lawyers, doctors, and businessmen--knew that they could not attain this desire; they watched resignedly when their men went downtown or to goodness knew where, and waited in the afternoon with growing curiosity and impatience if ever their husbands missed the 5:15; but there was no valid reason for writers, artists or composers to get away from home. Usually it was disloyal of them to think of such a thing, and uneconomical, and thoughtless.\n\nIt would have been difficult to count the number of times he had heard the wives of writers, artists, and composers say, at some literary cocktail party after a third Martini, that one of the wonderful things about being married to a writer, artist, or composer was that you could share his work, or if not share it, at least watch the creative wheels go round, and this, though often trying, was fascinating in that it gave one a sense of worthwhileness to help, just a little bit, in those lonely, creative struggles. You never knew, you couldn't know, all that a writer, artist, or composer went through, unless you were actually married to him. Not even his mistress could know, not that any of their husbands had mistresses; but lots of other people's husbands did. Doubtless you knew some of the husbands to whom they were referring, and some of the gals, too, who appeared with them at first-night parties and things like that--but, let's face it, a mistress was different from a wife. She might be more attractive. One dared say she was--and why shouldn't she be, with nothing else to do but be clever and simpática for occasional, limited periods? Yet no matter how delightful she was, she could not have the same true interest in creative work that a wife had. She might be aware of the fun of it, but never of the pain. After all, men who had mistresses could not tell them all their troubles. At any rate, only a wife could understand the true difficulties and the pains of creation--that is, if she were the sort of wife who tried to understand.\n\nIt wasn't all peaches and cream being married to a writer, artist, or composer. They were naturally temperamental, and at some points surprisingly immature, with crotchets and vanities and little-boy habits that you would have thought they should have outgrown at grammar school. They were not even--let's face it--very good husbands from a conventional point of view. Sometimes they were so busy with creation that they could not remember that they were husbands. No matter how faithful he might be, a writer, artist, or composer did lead a double life, what with his copy paper, palette, or metronome, or whatever--but still it was the sort of life that an understanding wife could share, and it could be a fine adventure, and the best thing about it was companionship. He was always there and you could see and hear the wheels go round. It was a pleasure to listen to the typewriter in the study and, if there was a pause, to wonder whether one should interrupt and try to be of help or whether, if one did, one's head would almost literally be taken off. You never could tell which it would be if you were the wife of an artist, author, or composer--but this was part of the fascination. It was--let's face it--in spite of all the trouble he made, the cigarette burns on the rug, the aspirin and Bromo-Seltzer all over the bathroom and the glass rings on the furniture--it was still wonderful to have your man in the house and know where he was. Moreover, it was the way things ought to be, and anyone who was married to a writer, artist, or composer was silly and shortsighted not to give him a study, studio, or whatever, and keep him in the house instead of listening to suggestions that he move to an office outside with some blond secretary or model or singer or something. What was the use in being married to a creative man if you did not have him right there in the house?\n\nTom Harrow had heard it all and also he had tried working at home. He had tried it first in their apartment in the old and ungainly Lexington Avenue house where Rhoda and he had begun their married life. He had used one of the hall bedrooms for writing and, as Rhoda said herself, it was just a cubbyhole; but when he closed the door she made it a special point, on her word of honor, never to disturb him. If he had to leave the door open, in order to get some heat inside the room, it was his fault if Rhoda called to him or occasionally came in to give him a kiss when he was not typing. In retrospect, the ballroom study had not been so bad and surroundings were not important when you were in your twenties and in love. Then there was the study on Park Avenue in the cooperative duplex, and then the other study on Park Avenue in the other duplex which Laura Hopedale had decorated while in one of her beige-and-ivory moods. Nancy Mulford, now his secretary, had come in part-time to do letters and script typing at Park Avenue, on the days she was lent him by the Higgins office. But even before the end of the first Park Avenue duplex, he had had it--and he had rented an office of his own in a dingy building in the vicinity of Carnegie Hall.\n\nThe old coach house here, after it had been made over, was a pleasant office with an open fireplace and windows looking over the garden. Its location was one of its greatest assets: at the far end of the gravel drive, and a considerable distance from the garage and the couple's quarters. Fortunately Emily had not given up wearing high heels. In fact, she seemed to be under the impression that these made her different from the other tweedy women of this community into which she had been catapulted. He was careful every year to have fresh layers of gravel copiously poured upon the drive as well as on the path beyond the turn-around leading to the coach house, and consequently it was almost impossible for Emily to reach the place. In an effort of hers to do so, the previous summer, she had twisted her ankle severely and, as far as he knew, Emily had not attempted the trip again. Thus the coach house was free of interruptions; and there was another room for Miss Mulford, so that, when he wanted, he could be entirely alone.\n\nHis workroom impressed him that morning as at least one place that unself-consciously reflected his personality. The odds and ends of his past were around him, not placed in any studied balance, but with the sort of continuity that came with association. There were the Hogarth prints he bought in his last year at college. There was the desk he had bought in London the first time a play of his had been produced there. The armchair by the bookcase was an ugly Victorian interpolation that had come from his parents' house on Seventy-second Street. There were a few framed photographs on the wall that would have made no especial sense to anyone else--one of Jack Barrymore, and one of a general, signed, Tom, with admiration--Arthur D. Whelk. There was a photograph of his mother in an evening gown stiffly posed against an Italianate backdrop by a forgotten New York photographer, and a snapshot of his father in white tennis flannels and a yachting blazer with brass buttons. The main point about the room was that all its furnishings, including the clock on the mantel, marked some point in his past without obtruding on his thoughts.\n\nThe door to Miss Mulford's office was ajar and he could hear the sound of her typewriter. His desk was bare except for the writing he had done the day before on yellow copy paper. The typing stopped and he heard Miss Mulford push back her chair.\n\n\"Good morning, Miss Mulford,\" he said--and he was glad to see her, because, like all the room, she was part of its continuity.\n\nLike the furnishings, it had been a long while since Miss Mulford had demanded his full attention. She wore one of her severely tailored suits of gray worsted with a trace of ruffled white showing at the open neck. He had never known her to wear a piece of jewelry in the office. Her nails were unpainted and she had on only a dash of lipstick. It was often difficult to realize that she had been with him for about twenty-five years. Although there was no visible gray in her hair, there was no obvious tinting in it, either, and it made no startling contrast with her regular features. In fact, one could not tell whether she was forty-five or not and in the end the question had no importance. She was still the neat, quiet girl whom he had met in the Higgins office when he had called in 1928 to discuss the casting of his play Hero's Return, and, in spite of thirty years, her beauty was still apparent. The moment he had first seen her, he had known that she was a part of the theatre and that her aggressive simplicities were part of stage tradition. In the theatre, good secretaries drew an uncompromising line between themselves and actresses.\n\n\"Good morning,\" Miss Mulford said, and he saw that she was watching him with unusual care. \"No one's brought the morning mail yet.\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said, \"I thought I'd walk down and get it myself this morning, but the New York Times has been delivered, hasn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Miss Mulford said, \"but don't you think it would be just as well if someone on the place called for the mail regularly?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I suppose you've got a point there, but I rather like to go down and get it myself. I won't be away long.\"\n\n\"Don't forget that Mr. Beechley is waiting for you to call him about Hollywood.\"\n\nHe looked at the clock on the mantel.\n\n\"I'm not forgetting,\" he said. \"He's probably not in the office yet.\"\n\n\"There are some more bills for you to look at.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"Is there enough money in the New York account?\"\n\n\"There isn't,\" she said. \"There never has been, has there?\"\n\n\"It's funny, isn't it?\" he asked. \"I keep putting money into that account, a little more each year, and yet there never is enough. But what about the housekeeping account?\"\n\n\"That's down, too--so don't forget to call Mr. Beechley.\"\n\n\"Maybe I'd better go to Hollywood if they want me there,\" he said. \"But then, there'd only be the income tax.\"\n\n\"Don't go,\" she said. \"You've just got here.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"and maybe things will just settle down now. Guess who came in last night?\"\n\n\"Who?\" she asked.\n\n\"Walter Price.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"he isn't going to stay long, is he?\"\n\n\"Only for a day or two,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh dear,\" she said, \"he always makes you restless.\"\n\n\"I wish you'd been at breakfast this morning,\" he said. \"He was telling about the Price Château, spelled with a Ph. Have you ever heard that one?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"never about the Price Château.\"\n\n\"He met the Duke of Windsor there,\" he said, \"but the whole thing was blown up by the Big Bertha in World War I. The château had the old Norman spelling, Phryce. It did not belong to the Price branch that came over to England with William the Conqueror. It belonged to the other branch and they retained the old family spelling.\"\n\n\"Maybe you'd better go and get the mail,\" she said, \"if you're going to work this morning.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" he said, \"but I've just got a new idea. When I was talking to that man Dodd--he was here this morning, you know--in the garden. Did I ever tell you that we used to go to school together?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"and you always call him Jack.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" he said. \"It's pathetic, isn't it, clinging to a thing like that? Frankly, I'm tired of being pathetic.\"\n\n\"You're not pathetic, only restless,\" she said, \"and you'd better go down and get the mail.\"\n\n\"Just let me make my point,\" he said. \"The point is: once you get involved in the theatre, you can't seem to project yourself out into the rest of the world.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"I know.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"you know, do you? Have you ever tried to get away from being involved?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"several times.\"\n\nShe had a good speaking voice. It would have been hard for her not to have picked up enunciation after all the scripts she had held through rehearsals, but there was nothing contrived in her speech. Nevertheless, he could not remember that she had ever sounded just as she had at that moment. It occurred to him that he had very seldom inquired about her private problems, but she had a right to her own life.\n\n\"I might have guessed at one or two,\" he said, \"but I didn't know that there were several times.\"\n\n\"I'll get the bills ready,\" she said, \"and there are still some letters you haven't answered.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"I shouldn't have made that remark, but I was only trying to make a point. My point is that all of us keep dealing in unrealities until they finally get more real than reality. It was that way out in the garden.\"\n\nHe stopped because nothing he was saying had much coherence.\n\n\"I suppose everybody gets caught up in something sometime,\" he said--\"that is, if you live at all.\" And he laughed. \"First and last, I've certainly got myself caught up in a lot of things.\"\n\nIt was morning, but he was talking as he might have at the end of a long day. He was almost sure that the overheard conversation was what had cast a shadow over his thoughts. He felt uncertain, and uncertainty was a serious malady which invariably called up the fear that you were written out and finished. It did no good to tell himself that he had gone through the same mood often enough before. It was the penalty for creative talent, plus the knowledge that one only had oneself to thank for failure. He was facing loneliness again, and vanity--the worst of it all was vanity. He wanted reassurance, and he wondered what Miss Mulford was thinking. Was she thinking, too, that he was losing his grip?\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I've been in and out of a lot of things--and you always leave some of yourself behind. There used to be a time when I thought I could set the world on fire. I was under that impression the day I came into the Higgins office, do you remember?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"you've got more sense now.\"\n\n\"Well, thanks a lot,\" he said. \"And now I'd better go and get the mail, and before going I'll leave you with a quote from Ecclesiastes: 'Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher... all is vanity.'\"\n\nHe was pleased with his own voice, which spoke well for the rhythms of King Solomon.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Harrow,\" Miss Mulford said, \"there's one thing...\"\n\nHe was half turned toward the door and he swung back sharply.\n\n\"Tell Alfred to lay out a new tweed coat for you,\" Miss Mulford said, \"and do see that the one you're wearing gets pressed. You've been wearing the same coat for the last three days.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nEmily was right that he was not really connected with the town. He was, like so many of his contemporaries, almost rootless except for business or profession. He and the rest of his generation had never lived in permanence. They had lived in the suburbs or in apartments during the winter, and the country places they bought they knew very well would be instantly sold by their heirs. There were no Old Home Weeks or old homes any more. If he had an old home at all, it was obviously New York, and New York itself had undergone such a metamorphosis that it was hard for him to reconstruct his old days there. The streets remained, but the buildings were evaporating. The Plaza was still there, and so was the entrance to the Central Park Zoo with the balloon men and the peanut men, but where was the Murray Hill? Where was the Belmont? Where was the Ritz? The truth was, his life afforded few sites for landmarks. You lived for decades in New York, but the time inevitably arrived when you retreated to a small area of it. You finally could not adjust yourself to its constant changes. You were more aware of impermanence there than anywhere else in the world.\n\nIn everyone there was a lurking desire for permanence, and most of life was pursuit of it. He knew very well that his associations with the small town to which he had returned had been brief though poignant, and he knew very well that he did not seriously belong there. The town was changing, like everything else in the postwar world, but not hysterically. It still had elements of dignity. It still was a scene of his youth. Dock Street, which he had first remembered in the early days of the Model T Ford, was hideously crowded with arrogant, rainbow-hued cars lining each curb of the old business thoroughfare. The trolley cars that had operated when he had first known the town had disappeared. Except for the Dock Street Savings Bank, the façades of the shops along the street had all been altered in an aggressive way that reminded him of television make-up on the faces of certain superannuated actresses. The new plastic façades on Dock Street were as blatant as the cars when the May sunlight struck them, justifying the remark, which he had heard somewhere, that we were living in a jukebox civilization. In fact, all of Dock Street seemed to be dancing that morning to a modern jukebox record, luxuriating in its materialism and in the pseudo-sophisticated displays in its shop-windows. In the show business one had necessarily to develop an eye for change, but he was forced to admit that the rising tide of new gadgets for sale on the old street was beginning to confuse him. All you could perceive was that everything was on the verge of change which would eventually be reflected in every facet of life and thought. He wished to goodness that he could gauge the trend, which was vaguely reminiscent, of course, of the upsurge of 1929, but no trend was ever identical with another.\n\nNevertheless, the town was still reassuring. The present was only a garish coat of paint over older buildings whose façades and shapes were scarcely altered by new blends of color. He wished that Dock Street could be translated to the stage, and in his thoughts he had occasionally attempted to do so, but he had never found a way to present its subtleties to an audience--that sense of being partly old and partly young. The youth that came with spring, for instance, was apparent in the elm trees that had survived hurricanes and disease, and yet the trees themselves were very old.\n\nEveryone knew about everyone else on Dock Street, and everyone knew where everyone else fitted in the elastic but undeviating social order. He knew very well that he did not belong in Clyde, but that knowledge in itself gave him a sense of identification. The gray slacks and the tweed coat that he wore that morning were things he would never have worn in New York. They were not the costume of the local citizenry, either, but they suited his category. He was the nephew of Miss Edith Fowler who had lived on Locust Street, the nephew whom she had taken in, the one who went through the last two years of high school here and who had been around town off and on later visiting his aunt, and who had married the Browne girl--Rhoda Browne; not one of the regular Brownes, but the daughter of the Browne who had once had the Ford agency. He was the Thomas Harrow who had written plays that had been produced on Broadway, and who had bought the Saebury house and fixed it up. He walked with his shoulders set exactly as he should have to maintain this part, in the military manner that he had picked up in his first week or so in the Pentagon during the last war. Emily had said that morning that he could have been good at anything. Generalities are never correct, but he had learned to walk and to talk like a soldier, and a little of it did not hurt on Dock Street.\n\nWhile thoughts like these moved through his mind aimlessly, he was still able to appreciate everything that went on around him. His interest in people and places had never lagged, and his instinct for caricature was as good as his memory for names and faces. Just in front of the Dock Street Savings Bank he recognized Mr. Everett Wilkins--not that this was a remarkable feat, because Mr. Wilkins was vice-president of the bank, waiting in quiet confidence for its president, Henry Baines, to retire; trustee of the Public Library; on the directors' board of Smith, Hawley; president of the West End Burying Ground. These offices all had a local value which were incomprehensible beyond the town limits, but Tom Harrow understood them, and also knew that if he had lived in town all his life he would never have attained these positions.\n\n\"Well, hello, Everett,\" he said. \"It's nice to have this glimpse of you.\"\n\n\"Why, hello, Tom,\" Mr. Wilkins said.\n\nBankers of the Chase or the First National in New York made honest if clumsy efforts to be broad-gauged, but such efforts would not have been desirable on Dock Street. The clear, pinkish face of Everett Wilkins was cool and intelligent. He wore an old Leghorn straw hat and a blue serge suit, the trousers of which were more shiny than the coat because inside the bank he wore a black alpaca jacket.\n\n\"You've come back early this spring, Tom,\" Mr. Wilkins said.\n\n\"Yes,\" Tom Harrow said. \"We did move up earlier this year, Everett, but it's very impressive that you should remember my comings and goings.\"\n\nMr. Wilkins smiled with what a columnist might have called a cracker-barrel smile.\n\n\"At the bank we keep track of customers,\" he said. \"As soon as I saw your last deposit, I said to myself: Tom Harrow is back in town and he's going to make more improvements on the Saebury house, or else he's moving his account from New York, and that couldn't be possible, could it?\"\n\nTom Harrow smiled. He never had been able to understand why business at certain levels had to be conducted in terms of badinage, or why money, when the subject was first introduced, should be a joke.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"You might need some extra help if I increased my account that much. I hope you've had a good winter, and that Mrs. Wilkins is well.\"\n\nHe could not recollect the first name of Everett Wilkins's wife, although she had once been a friend of Rhoda's back there in the past; but on the whole it was better not to remember her first name because he did not want Everett Wilkins to think that he was overanxious to improve their relationship.\n\n\"We had a very good winter, thanks,\" Everett Wilkins said. \"In fact, so good that Mrs. Wilkins and I were able to realize a dream we've always cherished--to take a two weeks' winter cruise on a Grace Line boat in the Caribbean. I heard that you and Mrs. Harrow were down there yourselves. It's quite a place, isn't it, the Caribbean? As long as you were down there I guess you and Mrs. Harrow had a good winter, too.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" Tom Harrow said, \"except that we were on the West Coast more than I like.\"\n\n\"Working on a new play, I guess, aren't you?\" Mr. Wilkins said.\n\n\"Yes, in a mild way,\" Tom Harrow said. \"We can't sit around and do nothing, can we, Everett?\"\n\n\"We certainly can't,\" Everett Wilkins said. \"Well, I've got to be moving. Is there anything we can do for you at the bank?\"\n\n\"Not at the moment, thanks,\" Tom Harrow said. \"It's nice to have seen you. How's Mr. Baines?\"\n\nThere was a transient sharpness in Everett Wilkins's eyes, but it faded very quickly.\n\n\"Never better,\" Mr. Wilkins said. \"He'd appreciate it if you came in and shook hands with him sometime, Tom. He was looking over your account only the other day. He remembers all about you.\"\n\nIt was hard to tell whether or not there was an edge to Everett Wilkins's voice. Small-town values were refined and difficult.\n\n\"He doesn't look a day older than he did when we were kids,\" Tom Harrow said. \"I certainly will come in and pay him my respects, Everett.\"\n\nHe had just finished speaking when a strange thing happened, one of those irrational things that you always wonder about later, that move out of the sequence of events. He was just about to nod to Everett Wilkins and walk on when he saw a girl walking toward them up Dock Street, and for an instant he had the illusion that she was part of memory, because her figure and posture and her walk reminded him of another day on Dock Street. Very few women walked gracefully. Even on the stage they had to be taught how to put one foot in front of the other; but the stride of the girl moving toward them was natural, matching the folds of the inexpensive polo coat she was wearing and falling into perfect tune with her head and shoulders. Her head was bare, her hair was a copper-chestnut, and in spite of her still being some distance away from them, he saw that the bone structure of her face was not unlike the face of Kit Cornell.\n\n\"What a very striking girl,\" he said. \"And she walks well, too, no hip sway, nothing. She just walks.\"\n\nEverett Wilkins's look of surprise made him realize that by evening everyone would know that he had come to Dock Street to look at girls.\n\n\"What girl?\" Everett Wilkins asked.\n\nTom had gone too far, but it was too late to stop.\n\n\"The only one worth looking at,\" Tom Harrow said. \"The one in the polo coat.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Everett Wilkins said, \"she walks in a sort of a sliding way, doesn't she? But she looks kind of plain to me.\"\n\n\"She wouldn't, with another dress and another hairdo,\" Tom Harrow said. \"Look at her bone structure.\"\n\n\"Bone structure?\" Everett Wilkins said. \"I'm afraid I don't quite follow you.\"\n\nBy evening everyone would know that Tom had been discussing bone structure on Dock Street, but it was too late to stop.\n\n\"The cheekbones and the molding of the jaw,\" he said. \"It's a beautiful face. You'd see it if she had another hairdo.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose you ought to know, Tom,\" Everett Wilkins said, \"just the way I know good mortgages.\"\n\nHe stopped because the girl was too near them to allow further discussion; Tom Harrow was embarrassed by the clumsy silence that followed, and yet the quality in the silence in itself was a part of memory.... He was standing on Dock Street again, and it was spring with the same sun and the same tone of sunlight.\n\n\"God damn,\" he was saying, \"that's a pretty girl.\"...\n\nShe was still walking toward them and Everett Wilkins raised his antiquated straw hat.\n\n\"'Morning, Irene,\" he said. The girl nodded and smiled. She must have known they had been talking about her, but she looked more interested in both of them than in what they were saying. Tom Harrow was highly conscious of the glance she gave him. She had blue-gray eyes. He was glad he was still not too old to be attracted by a pretty face. He would never be too old. She looked at him in a questioning sort of a way, just as he must have looked at her, but of course their reasons were different.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Wilkins,\" she said.\n\nShe had not changed her pace. She walked past them unhurriedly and it would have been ridiculous if they had still gazed at her without speaking.\n\n\"I don't know what you see in her,\" Everett said. \"Frankly, she looks kind of skinny and peaked to me, Tom, but then maybe I don't understand women.\"\n\n\"Irene...\" Tom Harrow said. \"What's her last name?\"\n\n\"Why, Dodd,\" Everett Wilkins said. \"She's Jack Dodd's oldest girl. She's been at college somewhere. Mount Holyoke or somewhere. But I hear she's been dropped or something.\"\n\nNow that he had seen Jack Dodd's daughter, he could understand why Harold had come home late the previous evening and he could completely applaud Harold's good taste, but at the same time he felt no wistfulness, no twinge of envy and no regret that he was no longer Harold's age. He was not moved by the girl herself--only by memory.\n\nThe girl's voice lingered with him, modulated, confident and unself-conscious. \"Good morning, Mr. Wilkins\" was all she had said, but he was not thinking of the voice of Irene Dodd. He was thinking, instead, of that constantly written scene of fiction and drama, the scene now stereotyped in Hollywood, of boy-meets-girl. In spite of all the times such scenes had been written and rewritten, the essence of them was evasive. At some time or other almost everyone on Dock Street, or anywhere else, for that matter, had played that scene, but always without knowing until later that he had played it. You could not rededicate yourself. Dedication could be done only once. And there never could be consciousness in that sort of dedication. There was a scene in Richard Feverel, and Beatrix walking down the stairs in Esmond, and the gawky grace of one of Arnold Bennett's heroines. These approached what he was thinking of, without being wholly satisfying. They reminded him, like the Dodd girl, of something in one's life that had never completely been put into words and something that could happen only once.\n\nHe had been Henry Esmond and Richard Feverel himself once, when he had first seen Rhoda Browne on Dock Street. He had thought the whole thing was forgotten, but then, no one ever completely forgets anything. Irene on Dock Street had not looked like Rhoda Browne. Rhoda had been better-looking, in spite of the impossible clothes of the period. There had only been the voice, the walk, the self-confidence and the restiveness. But now it was time to get to the post office and go back and call New York, and it was not time to think of melodies that boys and girls once sang on the beach at night. He had been able to sing \"Mandalay\" himself once, and some of the words were appropriate.... Long ago and far away... There ain't no buses running from the Bank to Mandalay.... There were no buses going back to Dock Street, either, and it was time to get the mail.\n\nIV. He Meant It When He Said, \"God Bless and Keep You, Thomas\"\n\nIt occurred to him, as he crossed Dock to Walter's Drugstore and proceeded down Bay Street toward the post office, that he was walking under the umbrella of consciousness, which he recalled from his college reading of Bishop Berkeley's philosophy. He had never returned to those pages to refresh his memory and now doubted that he ever would, but he still thought he had the whole thing straight. It was the Bishop's contention, if he remembered rightly, that nothing could provably exist which was not within the immediate radius of an individual's senses. Frequently this concept had given him considerable consolation. By its logic, for example, as he walked down Bay Street, Rhoda Browne, Laura Hopedale, Emily, Walter Price, Harold, and a lot of other people including Mr. Beechley in New York, were merely figments of the imagination and Bay Street alone was demonstrably real. For some reason difficult to explain, Bay Street had been the point from which the commercial impetus of the modern town had emanated. The first chain stores had opened on Bay street. Warren's Toggery Shop had been the first men's store to handle nationally advertised sporting regalia. The Bijou Theatre opposite the venerable Congregational Church had been the first motion picture house in town. Pendle's Notion Store, having changed its name to Chez Nanette, had been the first store in town to produce a window display of girdles and brassières, and right next to the old First Congregational Church. Tom Harrow had once walked each morning the length of Bay Street to reach high school and the street had given him many ideas. For instance, he had never seen a brassière until he encountered one in the window of Chez Nanette, and his knowledge of the Bible had been derived initially from Mr. Naughton's Bible class at the First Congregational Church. A swinging sign had been placed in front of the church ending with the name of its present minister, Ernest W. Godfrey. A narrow strip of lawn separated the church from Chez Nanette on one side; an identical strip on the other side separated the church from a candy shop; but Sam's Liquor Store (another first on the street, having been the town's first package store after Repeal) was at a lega"
