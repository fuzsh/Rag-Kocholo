Such a cinema would moisten your parched imagination and root your life in life itself. Maybe you dream further, of the real consequences such a cinema might bring beyond you: to the earth and the billions living on it or to your land and people. In any case the cinema you live with day to day will never do. It belongs to someone else, to a corporate nonentity. The mirage it tenders in its better moments only makes you dream further. And you dream not of some unimaginable holographic cinema, but of the past. You dream of films that have whispered to your imagination, films that somehow delivered a horizon surrounding their own delectable experience, the promise of a world of films, a chorus of voices speaking the world as it makes sense to speak it. The names that surface as you delve into this past resonate with moments and feelings belonging to the other arts: \"expressionist,\" \"futurist,\" \"impressionist,\" \"realist,\" \"Surrealist,\" \"poetic,\" or \"constructivist\" films. Vague yet hopeful terms, these tie the cinema to grand cultural aspirations, leaving behind the clumsy economy of ordinary movies and daily life. Most often the treasured films cradled by these \"art terms\" come from a past and from a place so remote as to make them nearly as imaginary as a cinema of dreams. And so it is with the cinema I am dreaming, the one I plan to evoke now in this book, a cinema whose abundant source lies back in France more than a half century ago. My challenge is to conjure something of these films and of this France, thereby imagining what the cinema has been capable of meaning elsewhere, not just what it means in these our meager days. The measure of independence I accord these films by watching them behave in the social environment of their origin is meant to invite a mature rapport between this cinema and our present time, one we can learn from and enjoy. Poetic realism is composed of two of the vaguest \"art terms\" critics have applied to the cinema in their pretense to precision. Nevertheless, within the myriad conjuries of this oxymoron there lies something true about the power of the cinema, about its abstract potential and about its realization in history. Andre Bazin affirmed that in the cinema \"poetry\" and \"realism\" were congenitally conjugated, that there was no way of speaking of realism without poetry and conversely that no film or technique could approach the poetic without a degree of realism.l The degree is what mattered to him, the ratio of poetry to realism, which in the course of history produces discriminable\n\nPREFACE\n\nstyles and genres. On the one side Bazin wrote of the oneiric and fabulous effect of scientific documentaries about plants and animals; on the other, he praised Albert Lamorisse's fairy tale, Le Ballon rouge, for its startlingly objective photography.2 Bazin liked to remind us of the parascientific origin of the cinematographe in the inventions of savants like Jules Marey, glad that the cinema from its outset confounded what otherwise our culture neatly separates into facts and fables, positive science and poetic value.3 Not surprisingly he opposed with equal vehemence the advocates of \"pure cinema\" who claimed an alliance with music and painting, and those for whom the cinema was only an instrument to gather and organize information. Bazin indicated another, middle route, the direction traveled by films that would ultimately be termed \"poetic realist/' True to the peculiar parentage of the medium, this impulse would strive to be most radically cinematic by resisting the extremes of art and of science so as to combine them as only it was capable. Bazin is just one of many critics enticed by a kind of film that encourages far-reaching aesthetic speculation while remaining a cinema of broad consumption and hence of great social significance. Unlike the necessarily restricted, elite audiences addressed by \"arty\" films and by scientific or documentary products, \"poetic realism\" vaguely addresses what most audiences seek at the movies, something that is true to life, yet more concentrated and intense than life. Although the name \"poetic realism\" is seldom pronounced outright in the conversations of theorists and intellectuals, its program has been on the table throughout the century. Bazin's theories seem most congenial to it, but only rarely did he address an unmistakably poetic realist film. Importantly, his major piece in this vein, on Marcel Carne's Lejour se live (1939), was designed as a pedagogical model for those directing cine-club discussions.4 Bazin could find no better example of cinema at work in its standard conditions. The greatness of Le Jour se live, and thus of the cinema, stands out in the way it provokes its \"poetry\" by reference to the social conditions it directly sets forth, and at the same time by the way it inflates a social conception of life to a level Bazin was not hesitant to call \"metaphysical.\" While Bazin's theories certainly support films like Lejour se live, he relied on them more often to gain access to neorealism, the western, ethnographic films, theatrical adaptations, and so on: modes, styles, and genres deviating from the \"poetic realist\" middle path I have marked out here. Nevertheless, poetic realism can gather under its name, as under some gaudy flag, a set of questions so endemic to the medium that theorists will always grapple with them. But the term, or more certainly the impulse, exists for an audience wider than scholars. To study poetic realism is to watch an aesthetic be negotiated by myriad cultural forces only one of which, the loudest but by no means the most powerful, is the intellectual. Poetic realism identifies a range of films and, more important, a function for the cinema that go deep into\n\nPREFACE\n\nXI\n\nculture. To understand its past and its possible future—and I do not shrink from this goal—is to observe it suspended in the web of historical situations. Poetic realism may be thought of as a general impulse in the heart of cinema, but far more important to me is its coming into phase with a culture that at a certain moment relied upon it for vision and expression. One can also watch it move out of phase, as the culture grew in different directions during the Occupation and postwar period. The result of this exploration should be a history that pays tribute to a certain moment (the Popular Front) while it examines the development, exaltation, and decline of a particular way of making and using films. Such a film history is simultaneously a film aesthetics, even a film theory, insofar as one holds that film aesthetics (what is possible in terms of signification and value in the movies) can be examined only on the basis of concrete cultural manifestations. There can never exist a hypo the tically important film style, because signification (or art, for that matter) only exists for someone, indeed for a group of \"someones\" we call a culture. The history of cinema and of aesthetic theory is to my mind the competition of views and practices that in specific moments have produced films and reflections upon them. Its historical embeddedness should keep us from understanding poetic realism as an airy impulse, attractive because logical. Its vagueness suggests that it be taken instead as a complex \"quantum\" or \"identity\" made up of the mass of aesthetic, technological, social, and psychological facets that must characterize any but imaginary cinematic categories. Beyond this, a comprehensive view of poetic realism explicitly seeks to know \"what cinema has been\" and \"what cinema might be,\" contributing thereby to the more abstract questionings of theorists who ever ask in their own idiolects, \"What is Cinema?\" Why poetic realism? Because it beckons with a look that is at once familiar and exotic, and because, in its quiet but alluring manner, it tempts us to turn to a different era, so as to explore the possibilities of this difference for our life and for our time. For whom were these movies made? For others, surely, others I will need to summon up, but also—and this is the point—for us and the kind of spectators we might become in watching these films. Begun as a series of independent but coordinated forays into the films and period of the 1930s, this study soon took on a perspective and a focus, even an argument. Consequently, many topics that I read and thought about have been shoved to the background or into the notes and bibliography where I encourage the reader to rummage. Industry matters were a principal casualty of my restricted view, although I am relieved to have included in the bibliography numerous monographs that delve into these tangled issues.5 As for my filmography, the chronological appendix reveals that this book puts in play less than 15 percent of the films made in the decade, and by no means all the films I screened during my research. Again the argument—plus my feel for the\n\nXll\n\nPREFACE\n\nmaterial—conquered my initial urge to write in encyclopedic fashion.6 The Appendix supplies minimal requisite information (dates when films premiered, their English title equivalents, and their directors) that otherwise would have cluttered the body of the text. It can be scanned like a flowchart of the book's concerns. Those concerns move toward their fulfillment in chapters 7 to 9 (on realism, on the poetic, and on the incomparably important Jean Renoir). For here I treat the films that gave poetic realism its reputation and its claim to an identity. To understand these films, to comprehend their function and what I am tempted to call their portent, I devote the first six chapters to a search for relevant predispositions in the type of history I write and in the culture I write about. The final chapters test the persistence of a kind of film or film culture across the barriers erected by the Nazis in 1940 and by the modernity that replaced them in 1945. What kind of identity can a national cinema claim? What sort of existence do films, and related groups of them, claim for later epochs? Can something of the sensibility of poetic realism live on in a culture markedly different from that which produced it? To treat these films and their period nostalgically or as a myth is to treat them as both present and absent to us. It is to see them the way we see movies, as insubstantial yet unmistakably affecting. It is to look through a mist of films we can feel even if we cannot quite touch. As for the illustrations, their corporeality introduces some texture to the mist of films we have in many cases forgotten or scarcely heard of. Occasionally chosen to seal a point made in the text, they more often serve multiple functions and have been placed in the general vicinity of the most obvious of these. Whether frame enlargements or production stills (and I do not try, and would be in some cases unable, to distinguish these), they articulate a parallel discourse to my text, playing off one another and off my words in an only partially predictable manner. And this again points to my method. I invite the reader to enter this book as I entered the subject it treats: with a sense of one's own concerns, but a willingness to adopt provisionally the concerns of another. The habit of circling from text to illustration and back to text promotes a historiographic strategy that leads from the films to the culture for which they were in some way consequential and back again to the films; this strategy in turn inscribes itself atop that greater, hermeneutic circle that whisks us from our embeddedness in the present back to the 1930s where we search not only for the significance that these artifacts—these strange and tantalizing films—portend, but where we may equally fabricate, under their guidance and that of the period, an import for our own lives and futures.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nALTHOUGH French cinema entranced me as an undergraduate at Notre Dame, it was only in 1978 while I was teaching at UCLA that I determined to study it to the limit. In the course of routine research, I noticed in the archives there a title that startled me, La Tosca. This was indeed a rare print of the film Jean Renoir had begun to make in Italy with Michel Simon just after La Regie du jeu and that his German assistant Karl Koch had completed when Mussolini asked the French to leave. Through Alexander Sesonske, I was able to screen this film for Jean Renoir, who had never seen it. I watched this man in the last year of his life, as he in turn watched for the first time images he had shot when he was at the top of his game and was surely among the greatest artists in any medium. I kept glancing from the screen to the man and then beyond to the wall on which hungjean at the Hunt, the painting his famous father had made of him in the full vigor of boyhood. A good part of the century hovered in the room for him and for me that day, and with it an astounding spectrum of sensibilities that I wanted to sort through and genuinely learn from. It made me want to write a book on what the cinema has meant and might mean, a book not about Jean Renoir but about the life of cinema in France when he was crucial to it; it was clear to me then that I would need to assimilate what I could of French culture, not just of the thirties, but of the decades from the Belle Epoque of Pierre Auguste right up to this moment I shared with his son in Bel Air, California. The University of Iowa allowed me to contemplate such a project when in 1981 it appointed me a Faculty Scholar with extended research leave. In 1985 the university renewed its support through an invitation to work at its Center for Advanced Studies. The ambience fostered by the center's director, Jay Semel, and his assistant, Lorna Olson, beyond the amenities found there, gave this book a warm nest to grow up in. I benefited from other institutional support as well: one memorable term was spent as a Fellow of the Camargo Foundation in Cassis, France; another entire year was freed up by the Guggenheim Foundation. Well-timed grants from the American Philosophical Association, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the American Council of Learned Societies took me to collections of materials and gatherings of colleagues I needed to visit. As the La Tosca anecdote indicates, screening rare films will always be the deepest pleasure as well as the most salient form of research in this field. And so I am particularly pleased to recall the welcome I received at the Cinema-\n\nXIV\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\ntheque royale de Bruxelles from Gabrielle Claes and the late Jacques Ledoux, at the Cinematheque nationale de Luxembourg from Fred Junck, and at the Cinematheque francaise from Vincent Pinel. Ed Buscombe arranged for me to work with the competent personnel at the British Film Institute. I was also given access to films at the Museum of Modern Art, the Library of Congress, and the French Consulates in Quebec and Ottawa. As for documentation, I relied most heavily on the Bibliotheque de r Arsenal (Emmanuelle Toulet helping here), the library of the Institut des Hautes Etudes Cinematographiques, and the British Film Institute. On this continent I found material at the Margaret Herrick Library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills, the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, the French Library in Boston, and the library of the Cinematheque quebecoise in Montreal. Scholarship requires archives and libraries, but it comes alive in discussions with colleagues. Of the many comments and exchanges my ideas have occasioned, I must mention those from Natasa Durovicova and Richard Abel first of all and then those from Ed Turk, Francesco Casetti, Steven Ungar, Roger Odin, and Ginette Vincendeau. In the United States Angela Dalle Vacche, Kelly Conway, Dana Benelli, and Jeff Ruoff were sounding boards. In Paris I profited from conversations with Michele Lagny, Genevieve Sellier, Lenny Borger, Glenn Myrent, Daniel Serceau, Eric Le Roy, Pierre Sorlin, Marc Vernet, and Marie-Claire Ropars. I was also privileged to interview several people associated with French film in the thirties: Jean Mitry, Pierre Chenal, Pierre Prevert, Denise Tual, Eugene Lourie, and Jean Oser. Some of these have since passed away. Two groups of faculty participating in NEH summer seminars that Steve Ungar and I led contributed to my ideas and their expression. Peter Christensen, Janice Morgan, David Slavin, and Robin Bates continue our discussions, years after those seminars ended. A succession of graduate research assistants, several now professors on their own, collected and organized my materials, becoming working partners in the process: Charles O'Brien, Claire Fox, Neal Baker, Jim Lastra, Janette Bayles, Sylvie Blum-Reid, Georgia Gurrieri, Didier Bertrand, Ursula Hardt, and Shoggy Waryn. Heather McKay and Anne Alfke helped ready the manuscript for Mary Murrell's editorial scrutiny at Princeton University Press—which had been convinced to take on such a large book thanks to Joanna Hitchcock, who believed it could be something special. Composing these acknowledgments reminds me how privileged my life and project have been. To the institutions and the people mentioned here, but even more to Stephanie and our children, to Angelo Bertocci, to Donald and Christine Costello, and to those unmentioned who have been with me in a special way throughout this period, I owe the dare of trying to live up to the fullness and the imagination of the films treated here. In the dominant chord\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nXV\n\nof those films, I regret the passing of these years that have been so rich for me and for the field I work in. That regret is condensed around the three extraordinary figures who died while I was writing this book and to whose memory I dedicate it—as different as they were from one another, they shared, in addition to their nationality, a passion for films and for talk about the cinema. They shared as well a generosity of spirit that touched me personally as it did so many others.

It has been imitated abroad but, God knows why, nobody makes this kind of movie better than the French. —PIERRE BRAUNBERGER,\n\nCinemamemoire\n\nOPPOSITE PAGE:\n\nHotel du Nord. MOMA\n\n1938: THE APOTHEOSIS OF POETIC REALISM\n\nPoetic realism hails us with a most nonchalant greeting, one that few of us take time to acknowledge. Most scholars nod in recognition and then move on in the crowded marketplace where films are hawked on all sides. But if one were to stop and answer back, as I have chosen to do, and if one hoped to gain or build whatever is possible when a rapport with anything or anyone is accepted, then a process of acquaintance, suspicion, and comprehension will be initiated that might be termed a cultural hermeneutics. There is no reason to hold an allegiance to poetic realism. Neither the name itself nor the films huddled under the porous umbrella of that name should be taken as sacred. Nevertheless, to distrust, and even to disparage the term, while following out the directions it indicates, is to proceed in good faith. It is to proceed as students of culture always should: without the illusion that our constructs are solid, and without the greater illusion that we can do without constructs altogether. Let us summon poetic realism, then, by letting it summon us. Let us gauge the power of this kind of film in 1938, when it was at its apex, by looking not at a sublime instance but at Marcel Carne's Hotel du Nord, a standard star vehicle, neither high-nor lowbrow. Hotel du Nord was meant to slipstream behind the phenomenal and rather unexpected success of his previous effort, Le Quai des brumes (1938). Evocative locations, characters from the lower social class, a downbeat ending, and a quartet of fabulous actors constitute the recipe for both films. Hotel du Nord was not to be lionized by critics the way its predecessor had been. It was too patently a commercial venture\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nHotel du Nord: \"Atmosphere. . . . Atmosphere.\"\n\nLe Quai des brumes: More atmosphere. BFI\n\nMOMA\n\nfull of compromises, little jokes, and lapses in taste to aim at the formal unity achieved by Le Quai des brumes and Le Jour se leve, that third \"somber tale\" Carne delivered before the war. Some of those jokes seem aimed right at the high seriousness of the style itself. The film's most memorable line, one of the most memorable in all French cinema, comes out of the broad Parisian mouth of Arletty when she is tired of the way her cultured and taciturn protector, played by Louis Jouvet, has treated her. As he leaves to go fishing for \"a change of atmosphere,\" she calls out in a saucy voice: \"Atmosphere. Atmosphere . .. bonne peche et bonne atmosphere.\" Is she spitting not just at Jouvet's pretensions but at the studied gloomy atmosphere suffusing Le Quai des brumes'? Yet the success of Hotel du Nord was exactly one of acting and tone, whereby Jouvet, Arletty, Jean-Pierre Aumont, and Annabella exuded the kind of fluency yet familiarity that characterized James Stewart, Gary Cooper, and Claudette Colbert in this same epoch. As in a Frank Capra film, we relish the dreams of these down-and-outers, in this case dreams of voyages and double suicides. Beyond the dramatic contrivances such dreams lead to, we relish the social celebrations that provide their backdrop: a first communion, a Bastille Day street dance. Quietude distinguishes Hotel du Nord from its American competitors at the festivals and box offices around the globe. Those raised on Hollywood fare might have allowed the fated lovers to mumble their despair to one another but must have awaited a dramatic surge to carry them away to their glory or their doom. Hotel du Nord withholds any such surge. It scarcely has a denouement to point to; rather the Bastille Day dance swings each character out toward some corner to await the final fade-out. Jouvet arranges his own end, smirking at the smiling gangster whose gunshots are mistaken for firecrackers. The lovers return to their bench beneath the bridge on the canal and\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nponder a bleak future. Arletty packs and leaves the hotel for good, leaves it to the peculiar proprietors and guests who inhabit this milieu and make it worth our attention. Hotel du Nord replaces a cinema of events with one of people, language, and milieu. It asks its viewers to enjoy the ordinary interplay of social types on the ordinary streets of Paris. Of course neither those streets (the picturesque canal Saint Martin and le quai des Jemappes that runs beside it) nor those types (Jouvet as the pimp, Arletty as the whore, Bernard Blier as the cuckold, and so forth) are ordinary at all. An idealized, poeticized reality encourages viewers to measure the reach and aspiration of their own ordinary lives, to look for the picturesque details in their own homes and neighborhoods, waiting for the chance to blurt out to a friend, a lover, or an enemy their own versions of the colorful repartees and tender sentiments Henri Jeanson had written so \"naturally\" for the cast. That an unmistakably commercial venture such as Hotel du Nord could triumph so readily in 1938 certifies the epigraph that opens this chapter. The French did indeed know how to make dark films and sell them worldwide. Compared to the highly plotted and gaudy American cinema, poetic realism promised far more integrity. For example, it promised authenticity in its sets, which were recognized at the time for their detail, their nuance, and for the way they seemed to participate in the dialogue and action played out upon them; whereas Hollywood sets, at least those the industry lauded with awards, stood off as added attractions that the audience might applaud, as when the curtain goes up at the overture of an opera. No one applauds Hotel du Nord that way, though the magnificent footbridge on which the film opens will carry us across to a fascinating world of people and incidents. When we return to that bridge in the finale, we are satisfied that this is our quartier, or could be ours, and that it is worthy of our attention and imagination. Few Hollywood films of the time draw us in quite the same way,\n\nHotel du Nord: \"The Discourse of Sets.\" BFI\n\nHotel du Nord: \"The Spectacle of Actors.\" BFI\n\n6\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nor were meant to. Hollywood's classic prototype of this genre, Grand Hotel (1932), features standard studio elegance as the setting proper to showcase its cast of stars. Exceptions, such as The Informer (1935) or Peter Ibbetson (1935), were deemed \"European\" in look. Hotel du Nord is not a classic but just a very good film produced at a moment when it seemed easy to make good films. Its quietness and poverty of incident mask its self-assurance. In the same year and in another, much more complex film, La Bete humaine, Jean Gabin and Simone Simon would exchange some of the most violent and erotic language and looks the cinema was then capable of, yet they would do so in an equally subdued, whispering tone, letting audiences monitor the incredible pressure underneath the sad routine of ordinary life. Such calculated repose in even the most violent or exotic films identifies the poetic realist sensibility. It is a sensibility that flourished in France in the 1930s, involving more than the internationally celebrated directors we have mentioned. Pierre Chenal, for example, had little reputation outside the industry in which he labored. But his relentless, nigrescent Crime et chdtiment (1935) makes one want to apologize for Joseph Von Sternberg's ostentatious version, made the very same year. At the decade's end Chenal adapted James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice (Le Dernier Tournant) with a tone of understated but general discontent that in their versions neither Tay Garnett (1946) nor Bob Rafelson (1981) would care to imitate or, for that matter, be able to fathom. American cinema has always invested in maximum shock effects, in bursts of song, violence, eros, or language. Poetic realism diffuses such energy in a warm mist of style that mutes the sound and brightness of every effect, even as it washes over us and seeps down to the roots of feeling. A NATIONAL PROJECT\n\nEvery identifiable aesthetic originally develops within a national context, even if it later bleeds across political borders. Thus cinematic expressionism is first of all German, and only later does it serve as an apt way of describing, among others, Eisenstein's final films. It is in this sense that poetic realism is properly identified as French. A history of any national cinema written from the perspective of political economy necessarily tells a debilitating story, because it views the past from the standpoint of the conquerors of that past, the Classic Hollywood Cinema and its avatars. But there is more to the history of French cinema, or any national cinema for that matter, than political economy can tell. There is a cultural and psychic economy that demands another form of history, one that accesses the French cinematic mentality. A proud nation, France has always\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nproclaimed the difference of its institutions, or at least the difference of its style of participation in institutions. In a word, it believes in its \"distinction.\" Claims about the special nature of French cinema continually ooze from right-wing and left-wing magazines, from official governmental proclamations, and from the announcements put out by the film industry. They establish a virtual, if phantasmagoric, axiom: French cinema may obey the laws of international economy, but it retains an inner purity exempting it from the debasing consequences of that system. Its purity is thought to descend from the hallowed traditions of literature and painting that underlie filmmaking in France more than in any other country, lending it a subtle moral edge that it has occasionally exploited against Hollywood businessmen. In addition, the cinema spreads French culture to new audiences at home and abroad. A typically soothing response to the fear of sound film can be found in a 1929 article called \"Toward a French Style of Cinema,\" which warns producers not to imitate American films by turning to ersatz theater, particularly of the boulevard variety. To recover its cinematic mission France needs but two elements, organization and style, both of which aim at \"unity of expression,\" something that is practically a national instinct. What is the French style? We are quickly told: \"a certain precision of contour and rhythm, a mixture of darkness and poetry, occasionally a quality of eloquence that seems to be ours alone, and above all a sense of architectural line, a genius for simple sturdy construction.\"1 Poetic realism took up this standard in the 1930s, and on a battleground of uneven terrain already staked out by other kinds of movies representing sizable economic forces. On the one hand, this new, delicate French strain asked for special attention and consideration from audiences and critics alike. On the other, these same films had to compete with Hollywood at the box office. Hence, their appeal fell somewhere between the sophisticated and the popular, an elusive target that French cinema has aimed to hit ever since the founding of the Film d'Art company in 1908, and especially since the cine-club movement of the 1920s. The leader of that movement, Louis Delluc, may have been responsible for recruiting intellectuals to turn to the cinema, but he was also adamant that the medium maintain its lifeblood through connection to the lower classes. It was he who first announced that \"the cinema will be a popular cinema or it will not be at all.\"2 To negotiate this middle zone, those responsible for poetic realism adopted a literary demeanor. Its very name referenced literature or, at least, literary ideas. It would be up to poetic realism to prove that serious cinema, taken with the seriousness generally accorded to literature, could at the same time be as irrefutably alluring as Hollywood films. To define French cinema with Hollywood in mind, then, is not merely a heuristic exercise, for French cinema has developed in relation to this explicit competition. Arguments over the very invention of the medium pit Louis\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nLumiere against Thomas Edison, the victor determined evidently only by the chauvinism of whatever historian you are reading. There is no argument, however, regarding the early mastery of the field. The French dominated the world hands down. Centrally located, and with far more experience in international entertainment trade, they were without rivals up to World War I. Georges Melies opened an office in New York, and, at least up to 1911, Pathe Freres distributed more films from its New Jersey offices than any of the American companies, including Edison. But 1914 put an end to all that as it did to so much more. Four years of hostilities left the cinema business open to the nonbelligerents. Sweden and America prospered, making films in untroubled circumstances, selling them to all countries. When the rest of the world awoke from the nightmare of World War I, it found itself caught in the midst of a gentler dream spun in a land of sorcerers: Hollywood. Forever after the world would look to Hollywood as it would to any sorcerer, with a mixture of fascination and fear. Hollywood played on these feelings, manipulating the international market to suit itself. Just consider the unilateral reconfiguration of the medium to include sound. With this stunning business gambit, Hollywood incurred the wrath of smaller industries unable to afford the required audio technology. The French were most vociferous. The cinema was their invention, or so they believed. Now a cartel of crass studio heads from across the Atlantic were intent on starving the already anemic French production. In the process the art of cinema was being permanently disfigured. And so the period of concern to us could not start on a bleaker note. In 1929 only sixty of the four hundred films projected in France were French, and 80 percent of all receipts found their way back to Hollywood. Bringing with it both immense capital and up-to-date technology, Paramount of Paris immediately became France's leading production company. As a consequence the French populace must have assumed that the movies were a rightful Hollywood phenomenon: they routinely watched more American than French films. In contrast, although Americans went to the movies more often than the French (some twenty-three times annually per capita in this era), they most likely would never encounter a French film. How had such a situation developed? First of all, the structure of Hollywood gave it an unbeatable advantage. A virtual monopoly held by what would eventually amount to eight vertically integrated studios kept foreign films from all but a few designated import theaters in New York. Production, distribution, and exhibition in France, on the other hand, competed with one another, permitting foreign interests a foothold. Since 95 percent of theaters in that country were independent and unchained, power lay in distribution. Subsidiaries of Hollywood studios quickly began to control distribution, pressuring theaters into exclusive deals with them. After all, they could provide Hollywood stars and spectacle. Soon second-line genre pictures began to per-\n\nINTRODUC TION\n\ny\n\npetuate themselves through this system. Audiences became used to westerns and Mickey Rooney vehicles and routinely went back to see them. And so, while their facilities and personnel were easily capable of turning out 250 films a year, in the 1930s France produced half that number. Not only was this a financial loss and a failed opportunity for idle artists, the massive importation of American films had invisible consequences for cultural identity, that is, for \"French\" ideology. From 1925 on an alarm decrying this situation was sounded in French trade papers, an alarm that continues to this day. A panoply of emergency strategies has been deployed. Most of these have been economic in nature: taxes on imported films and on the dubbing of films; the required employment of French personnel in dubbing; quotas limiting imports, then limiting the number of weeks theaters might play foreign films; the blocking of funds made by American companies from leaving France.3 Far more interesting are those textual strategies aimed at product improvement and differentiation. This was defense by counterattack, with consequences for the history of film style. Since, with its vast technical and financial resources, Hollywood was unassailable in the realm of spectacle, certain French producers introduced guerrilla tactics, launching distinctively French offerings that emphasized regional characters, dialects, tales, and lore that Hollywood could never copy or assimilate. Because the international language of the silent film exploded in 1930 into a Babel of dialects, the possibility was raised of innumerable independent fiefdoms ruling over local terrain. French stage plays, cheap to reproduce on film, could bring to a large French audience the witty and often socially attuned dialogue that playgoers in Paris enjoyed. And this dialogue could be spoken by actors the whole country had heard about but few had ever had the opportunity to see in person. From 1930 to 1934 the national theatrical genius flowed onto film in the form of farces, satires, boulevard comedies, and melodramas. Many, such as Marcel PagnoFs, were spiced with regionalisms. A second strategy flowed from the magic words \"cinema of quality,\" first pronounced with missionary zeal in this context of trade around 1930. With \"quality\" the French would dare to strike back not at regional outposts but at the center of the American power. Quality was to match up with, and defeat, the ungainly American cinema of \"quantity,\" and not just in France alone, for this would be designated an export line of movies. Hollywood was pictured as an assembly-line factory, whereas all films made in France were thought to develop in an individual, hence more natural and human, manner. The standardized genres and studio styles of the factory were countered by the healthy diversity of French subjects, each treated in a style tailored specifically to it. As for working conditions, the alienated writers and contract performers in Hollywood were said to lack the morale maintained on French projects by talent who considered themselves artisans, heirs of a medieval guild system. Furthermore, these artisans could take pride in their devotion to a grand proj-\n\n10\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nect as well as in their relations to co-workers with whom they formed a team or equipe.\n\nSuch an argument had a material basis. The absence of an integrated studio system in France meant that each film gestated as a unique venture. In 1937 only a handful of French producers were involved in more than one film, no producer involved in more than six. Hollywood studios, by contrast, turned out as many as fifty films each. Everything in a French film of export quality was built around the writer-director team who offered a project to a producer (frequently a friend). Jacques Prevert and Marcel Carne formed the most famous of such teams, but there were many others. Often an actor was included in the package, which, once under way, grew with the addition of a trusted cameraman, designer, and composer. Such teams frequently traveled together from project to project, getting to know and respect one another. This contributed to that wholeness of atmosphere that bathes each of the famous poetic realist films of the late 1930s, this and the fact that in a system of such liberty, where projects develop along lines of friendship and acquaintanceship, often the very best artisans were eager to join in. Take music, for instance: cinema attracted prominent composers like Darius Milhaud (who in his career composed 24 scores), Georges Auric (125), Maurice Jaubert (19), Arthur Honegger (40), and Jacques Ibert (29). The composer, along with the rest of the equipe, met frequently with the director to contribute to and share the overall design of the film. The difference between the systems stands out visibly in set design, as we saw with Hotel du Nord. When the technical shooting script is handed to the designer and properties manager in Hollywood, they outfit the sets with the backdrops and props available in the studio warehouse. Every item may be of first-rate quality, but nearly every item has been used in earlier films and few would be constructed with the current project in view. By contrast, to take an illustrious French anecdote, when Jean Renoir asked Eugene Lourie to construct the chateau set of La Regie du jeu (1939), Lourie started from scratch.\n\nLa Regie du jeu: A prop comes\n\ncenter-stage. CB\n\nINTRODUC T ION\n\n11\n\nPerhaps the limits of the budget show; certainly the chateau does not have the brightly lit expanse of a Paramount set, but Lourie's chateau grew up around the possibilities inherent in the script and contributed possibilities all its own: a staircase to separate (and connect) the servants from the aristocrats, redoubts and closets to permit the camera its hide-and-seek game with the action. Furthermore, Lourie's wife combed Parisian antique shops in search of the mechanical toys collected by the Marquis. Indeed the role of the Marquis was enlarged once Renoir saw what Mme Lourie had collected. Its natural childbirth, so to speak, gave this and the better French films an artistic edge over Hollywood products that were doctored by specialists working serially and in increments. How successful was this strategy? French cinema even today likes to measure its strength by the stir it creates. Box-office statistics were not even tabulated and published during most of the 1930s; so the luminous image that French cinema projected was thrown primarily by the discourse kept up by critics, journals, and official proclamations.4 Films made for export naturally received far more critical attention than others, shaping an impressive \"front\" of the industry that was often disproportionate to their commercial success in France. What is the artistic \"image\" of French cinema worth? Under its lure some producers were tempted to take on striking projects proposed by writers and directors looking to raise the cultural stakes of the cinema. No matter what the economic realities of poetic realism, then, its image was not only a source of pride, most critics were certain it upgraded the importance and impact of the national cinema. ETYMOLOGY OF AN AESTHETIC\n\nI do not believe the words \"poetic realism\" ever entered into the discourse of producers, distributors, or exhibitors, in the way that labels like \"western,\" \"musical,\" or even \"neorealist\" certainly did. Symptomatically, the origin of the term came by way of literature. It was conferred by Jean Paulhan, editor of the prestigious La Nouvelle Revue francaise, on Marcel Ayme's La Rue sans nom, a 1929 novel about a handful of forgotten people who languish in the dark suburban streets of Paris. When Chenal adapted this work late in 1933, relying on location shooting, the reviewer for Cinemonde declared, \"This film, in my view, inaugurates an entirely new genre in French cinema: poetic realism.\"5 He then distinguishes the \"artificial realism\" of standard cinema from ChenaFs breakthrough and he links that breakthrough to a concentration of the caldron of contemporary social life seen at its most squalid but most lively. This was a quiet baptism, very unlike the case for a movement like Surrealism. Intellectuals who knew little about cinema were apt to pay attention to Surrealist films because its name brought with it debates in both literature and\n\n12\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\npainting. Moreover, filmmakers began to think of, sometimes to promote, their new projects in relation to the ongoing sense of the Surrealist mission, as though that mission were an entity one could adhere to, carry forward, and be rewarded by. Poetic realism, in contrast, commanded no adherents, promulgated no doctrine. Its name did not arise in the workplace, so to speak. It did not accompany the films associated with it, cuing the way they should be read or indicating in advance their projected import. It was in effect a fabrication of the critical establishment, and it remains so today. A fabrication, however, is by no means a fiction. Some label was required to help sort out the increasing number of films that displayed at least a common ambition. Without the convenient genre categories of Hollywood, without a governmental body to speak for it (the only major European cinema left to fend for itself in this way), and without a vertically integrated industry (indeed without a substantial production company after 1934), French cinema appeared on screens in piecemeal fashion, only the names of stars guiding the viewer and the critic in their efforts to harmonize what they saw week after week. One can imagine the anxiety pervading a filmmaking community that could scarcely predict what, or how many, films it was liable to bring out each year. The fact that production remained constant (between 110 and 140 films each year from 1934 to 1938) suggests that certain economic and marketing factors were quietly regulating the flow of this laissez-faire industry, but its identity was another matter. Certainly, successful ventures were repeated with variations (military comedies, for example), and producers made sure to concoct scripts congenial to the dominant presence of certain stars, whose names unquestionably served as the one reliable lure capable of catching the attention of prospective viewers. But since no single producer planned for more than a couple of films each year, French cinema developed haphazardly. In such apparent absence of constraint, independent initiatives could sprout and take their chances. Nothing in the system could have predicted Le Quai des brumes, for example. It belonged to no nameable genre. Its astounding success sent critics searching their memories of earlier films to gi.v& substance to the feelings it aroused. Adjectives like \"romantic,\" \"moody,\" \"pessimistic,\" cropped up. Understandably, poetic realism became a concept to latch on to. Should it surprise us that foreign critics more comfortably identified this trend than did the French? Politics split French critics on every film, fragmenting an already fragmented situation. With a haughtiness born of the recent ascension of the Popular Front, the communist critic Georges Sadoul saluted the triumph of Jacques Feyder and Carne over German competition and even over the alluring but vapid Hollywood films of the time.6 While he was singularly aware of the stylistic pedigree of these directors (he mentions Emile Zola, Louis Feuillade, D. W. Griffith, F. W. Murnau, and German expressionism), he was much more anxious to applaud their realist (and \"antifascist\") temper-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nament. Yet other critics, and not just right-wingers, found poetic realist themes and characters puerile and evasive. Renoir went so far as to contradict Sadoul, labeling Le Quai des brumes \"fascist/' and thereby initiating a rancorous response, as we shall see.7 Foreign critics ignored such differences. At the Venice Biennale, for example, appearing against the background of Italy's \"white telephone\" genre, Julien Duvivier, Carne, and Renoir stood out for their astounding seriousness and pessimism. Meanwhile, \"French films of the late 1930s became the first substantial body of foreign-language pictures to interest American audiences. In major American cities, a few little 'art theaters' sprang up to show them.\"8 One after the other, La Kermesse heroique (1935), Mayerling (1936), La Grande Illusion (1937), Regain (1937), and La Femme du boulanger (1938) received the New York Critics Prize as best foreign film.9 As different as they may be, they were taken as sharing a particular sensibility, one that distributors knew how to direct to a certain class of viewers. A survey of the New York Times reviews for the whole decade shows not only the large number of films that played in the city (170 are reviewed) but also how highly they were valued: a great majority are praised, often for outscoring Hollywood in artistry, taste, and maturity of content and execution.10 Especially after 1935 the Times repeatedly gives the impression that something about French mores, tradition, education, or language destines its better films to be serious, candid, atmospheric, and strangely dark. The review of Jacques Feyder's Pension Mimosas, to take an example nearly at random, speaks of \"the fondness of the traditionally gay French for films of somber tragedy.\" La Bandera is praised for \"its camera consciousness . . . its ability to suggest mood and regulate tempo,\" that makes it \"possible to get behind the externals, to develop the drama psychologically, to build up steadily to the close of the chase and then with typical Gallic fatalism and irony . . . leave the solution to destiny.\" Perhaps most telling is the Times's reaction to Jeff Musso's Derniere Jeunesse, since this was a rather ordinary film of 1939. Although it received little attention in its own country, the American reviewer seemed predisposed to its poetic realist tone: \"A macabre, shadowy drama of jealousy and fear, with a certain somnolent attraction which we can attribute to the performances and to its director's conjuration of mood.\"11 Outside France, then, a \"cult\" value began to accrue to \"the school of poetic realism,\" as it came to be known in the 1940s.12 Paul Rotha snidely says, \"French films were thought to have something to do with 'culture,' something to do with sophistication. The word most often used to describe them was 'mature.'\" 13 He found this aesthetic jejune: \"[These films] all focussed on the individual against a background of poverty, crime, and violence. . . . These misty waterfronts and low dives were excellently rendered and photographed, but their life' was a subjective one. . . . Beautifully made, sensitively acted, they were films of defeat in which the British and American intelligentsia\n\n14\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\ndiscovered poetry.\"14 Evidently large audiences in Buenos Aires and Tokyo were also drawn to this defeatist sensibility. When World War II cut off French exports, foreign critics froze poetic realism into a single, solid, and dazzling block. Even in postwar France, the politically motivated dissension these films caused at their premieres evaporated; suddenly everyone regretted \"the school of poetic realism\" that had brought such glory to the nation. Textbooks and coffee-table volumes15 could now size up its impact in an overall history of cinema. They have made the movement official by citing a small catalog of traits and a few canonized films, he Quai des brumes, because of its single-mindedness and concentration, has dominated these appraisals of poetic realism. When, in its very first scene, a bedraggled Gabin shuffles down a foggy road, he evidently ushered in a new morality, a new, anonymous hero, and a new style of filmmaking, comparable to the change wrought twenty years later by Jean-Paul Belmondo in Jean-Luc Godard's A bout de souffle.16 \"With its moon-lit port town enveloped in fog and inhabited by symbolic people with exotic-sounding names, Quai des Brumes [sic] creates a fantastic, stylized world in which reality and imagination merge into one, but which is still essentially real and true. The most tangible quality is the sense of anxiety and finality. . . . All the elements of style are perfectly blended and balanced.\"17 The sheer gravity of this film is sufficient to attract a plethora of others coming before and after. Jean Vigors VAtalante (1934) may seem closer to magic realism, for the objects crammed within its frame convey not fatality but a liberating sense of possibility; still Vigo's only feature film confirms the movement of the best French directors away from action or intrigue and toward milieu. The same point has been made for the bucolic lyricism of Pagnol and the tragic naturalism of Renoir: even though neither fits willingly or comfortably into the poetic realist camp, their films belong to an era dominated by its conception of story and character, and by its attention to evocative physical detail. Similarly, less well known examples, like Jean Gremillon's 1930 La Petite Lise can now be taken into the movement; after all, it was reviewed at the time as a film that \"created an atmosphere surrounded by destiny, fatum implacabile.\"18 Thus for the historian who can make use of it, a large galaxy of films swirls around the textbook constellation of dark stars that Carne released in the waning years of the Third Republic. Alan Williams's authoritative Republic of Images provides a catalog of both traits and films putatively belonging to poetic realism, although he is careful to point out that \"few labels in film history are as vexing,\" and that \"it is arguably not a school. . . . Nor is it a genre, yet it is something more than a style.\"19 As for film theorists, their reach is always centrifugal. Andre Bazin, we have seen, was attracted to Lejour se leve, because it exemplified in a supreme way that \"balance\" between attention to the everyday and a heightened concern for subjective mood that he felt to be definitive of modern cinema. Jean Mitry was prepared to extend this balance outward in his expansive and sympathetic\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15 survey of poetic realism. Because of its moody romanticism, Mitry mingles this style with that of Von Sternberg, Frank Borzage, and the German Kammerspiel20 He calls it an \"attenuated expressionism inserted into the norms and conditions of the immediately real where symbolism is reduced to things, to objects.\"21 Mitry came to such wide-ranging ideas in the very milieu of Popular Front Paris. A schoolmate of Pierre Chenal, frequent critic for Pour Vous and Cinemonde, and co-founder of La Cinematheque francaise, he was on hand to witness and publicize what he saw as the progress of French sound cinema. And so it is hardly surprising that poetic realism should take its place literally in the center of his massive Histoire du cinema,22 where it functions as a touchstone, the most indicative and progressive use of the medium in the first decade of sound. Unlike related genres of the time such as social realism, psychological realism, and psychosocial lyricism, which he judges ponderous and tendentious, poetic realism maintains contact with social experience analogously, not directly; it models social experience by means of a cinematic experience that chemically transforms whatever facts make up its climate. Like Carne he would gladly exchange the term \"poetic realism\" for Pierre Mac Orlan's more precise fantastique social The stories Mac Orlan concocted between the wars, Le Quai des brumes23 foremost among them, were designed, like all tales of the fantastic, to engender \"disquiet and mistrust\" but to do so in the manner of nocturnal street photography rather than eldritch lore. In the twentieth century, our own urban landscapes exude the eerie more readily than do the Gothic settings of traditional tales of this genre.24 *§«\n\nle Quai des brumes. BFI\n\n\"Le Fantastique social.\"\n\nLe Quai des brumes. BFI\n\nPoetic realism earns Mitry's respect because it respects cinema, whereas propaganda, social or psychological realism, and the fantastic all commandeer the cinema to transport spectators outside the movies to some recognizable or foreign land. Poetic realism, on the other hand, promises to drive its enfolded\n\n16\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nspectator into an ever-deepening cinematic world. For this reason its impact on film history was the greater, for it developed an interplay of registers that led to strikingly concentrated effects. In his theoretical writings, Mitry went on to hypostatize poetic realism, a term so haphazardly introduced at the time of the Popular Front. Whether specifically French or not, this kind of cinema fulfilled the dual role of the medium signaled in the title of his treatise: Esthetique (the appeal of the poetic) et psychologie (the need for realism) du cinema. The version of film history that Mitry narrates and that textbooks have disseminated brushes dangerously against both formalism and narcissism. This history of the great tradition of poetic realism values formal developments which point the way to the cinema that, in all senses of the term, \"becomes us.\" In this process the bulk of movies fall into oblivion, since 80 films, 100 maximum, are all one needs of the decade's 1,275 to establish this tradition. Social historians of every stripe have come to challenge this hegemonic view of the decade by opening up the full archive for inspection. To the student of popular culture these 80 films stand as a mere genre (films of \"dark pessimism\")25 within the larger system of the French film industry and the larger needs served by a range of genres. Moreover, when treated as one part of the chief \"popular entertainment medium\" of the day,26 poetic realism hardly fulfills the vaunted social claims made for it by the likes of Sadoul. Shortsighted and morally anemic, this genre, like nearly all the films of the time, evaded pressing political problems and wallowed in regret. Few French films, none of them commercially viable, lifted their heads out of the sand to confront the economic depression and the fascist threat head on.27 None of the poetic realist writers or directors came from the working class; this is evident when one tallies up the problems they fuss over (virginity, for example), problems that apply aptly to the petit-bourgeois moral code that was officially promulgated in the country but that did not keep the proletariat awake at night. As Rotha was quick to note, because it appealed to an international and literate audience, including later generations of film lovers like us, the poetic realist canon is suspect. Berated as too lax in its \"social\" ambition,28 or as too pretentious in its \"cultural\" ambition, poetic realism has been consecrated by a purely formal appreciation that has obliterated whatever work cinema as a whole performed in its social context. In exploding the canon, the modern historian may appear to exercise a professional obligation to recover the entirety of the past, yet here too selfinterest asserts itself. The \"us\" that the past helps constitute has changed even in the few years since Mitry, Bazin, and Sadoul assessed it. If today's historians are likely to emphasize the social dimension of the films of the Popular Front era, one can thank changes in the politics of academic life since 1968 or the\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n17\n\ninspiration of Francois Mitterrand's socialist government that came to power in 1981. To use the title of Genevieve Sellier's provocative article, after Mitterrand we all suddenly became \"remarkable inheritors of the French cinema of the 1930s.\"29 But what we have inherited is certainly not everything that the 1930s tendered; rather it is what we require: a socialist vision in politics and the aspirations for the cinema it gave rise to. For better or worse, this vision and these aspirations descend from the films that made an impression so indelible it can be retraced today; that is, the films of Renoir, Carne, Duvivier, and Gremillon remain with us, not the \"cinema du samedi soir.\" Even in their most powerful moments, these directors were not in direct touch with the heartbeat of the masses (a case that could be made for a Fernandel) or with the key issues confronting Europe (as was the cinema engage).30 Instead their social relevance—hence, their relevance to Mitterrand's France, Sellier argues—must be indirect, through the importance of particular narrative strategies and investments. The ideological density at the heart of Gremillon's Gueule dyamour (1937), for example, derives from an inspired script that conjoins in the same female figure (played by Mireille Balin) both the object of the hero's desire and the representative of the cavalier upper class that oppresses him. When the enraged hero (Gabin) strangles her, his doomed gesture can be read as deeply revolutionary. Admittedly, Gremillon's assessment of his era's social problems may be partial, and his \"solutions\" may be escapist. Nevertheless his film remains powerful for its ingenious, yet precarious, balance of individual aspirations, social forces, and the destiny of sentiments. Sellier believes that he learned this balance from Honore de Balzac and Zola whose aesthetic precedent allowed him to sculpt a sophisticated model of subjectivity that indirectly gives us access to a Popular Front perspective. To study a film as clairvoyant as Gueule d'amour is to seek to understand indirectly the social and psychological sensibility of a particular past. This may also tell us about our sensibility as we return, with nostalgia or obsession, to a former time. We have reached the forking paths in film historiography. In one direction lies the canon, for even with social issues in mind, to focus on a figure as substantial as Gremillon31 inflates the specific power of a certain cinema above other films, other modes of expression, and perhaps even above its culture. The danger is that \"indelible\" masterpieces and their auteurs are all too easily taken as transcending their era. The other direction veers toward a sociology that claims to establish (often statistically) a rapport between cinema and the social trends of the day. The danger here is that, no matter how comprehensive such a study may be, or how attentive to the myriad genres and topics of a complete archive, the social touchstone it employs neuters whatever it is that films bring to culture, reducing them to evidence, the equivalent of votes in an election or public speeches or caricatures found in newspapers.\n\n18\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nAnyone who takes films seriously surely conceives of them as involving more than the unpredictable intuitions of inspired artists and more than the fully predictable output of a social mechanism of popular culture. For the one concerns itself with masterworks as though they were autogenetic and the other treats the movies as engendered by social forces and laws. Those who credit the cinema with having, if not a mind of its own, at least a body of works and practices, must look beyond the hypotheses of either autogenesis (in the case of auteurism) or social engendering. The body of films within the larger body politic of culture has something to say about the way we should assess French cinema of the 1930s. This is the point of departure of a team of scholars who have arrived at what they call, in the very title of their stunning book, a Generique des annees 30.\n\nThe term generique refers in the first instance to the \"generic\" network that interrelates films by topic and theme. The authors—Michele Lagny, MarieClaire Ropars, and Pierre Sorlin—deliberately unknot this network and even unravel the threads of individual films in order to retie them in various \"series\" that model the mechanism of an industry of the social imagination. Without qualms, they manipulate the films so as to look behind them (at their staging) and in front of them (at the investment of audiences paying to see them). The series they draw up are intentionally diverse and include depictions of collectivities (such as the army), individual stars (like Harry Baur and Gabin), thematic taboos (as in the representation of the colonies), and repeated narrative rituals (the public /private reversibility of main characters). These are not formal traits but structures of representation that \"generate\" the figural possibilities of the films of this era. These possibilities, it turns out, are concentrated in the credits (generique) of each film. It is here that production hierarchies, audience fetishes, and dramatic structures stand revealed. In modeling the unconscious system at the root of French cinema, Generique des annees 30 treats filmgoing as a repetition compulsion driven by the names of a coterie of stars. The limited roles that could be scripted for them inevitably congeal into still more limited dramatic and imaginative possibilities. Stars, roles, plots, and themes are shown in case after case to rise into the spotlight, then split apart, motivating a quest for unity that absorbs but never fully satisfies spectators. The \"lack\" structured in each film requires the production of further films with modified generiques. Thus, once off the ground, French cinema of the 1930s was virtually self-sustaining, but it was also, and for the same reason, monotone. Under the spell of an ingratiating narration that asked little from them, under the greater spell of a generique that froze them in their seats, spectators of the time admired, but did not enter into, the feigned sacrifices of the actors playing before them on the screen. The ingenious critical coup of the generique exacts a price paid for by history, or by the possibility of historical development. Discounted in advance is the\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n19\n\nimportance of variety both in films and in audiences; in this kind of structural analysis, a single mass spectator sits mesmerized before the single block of \"the film of the 1930s.\"32 To recover variety and change, without resorting to the kind of \"exceptionalism\" implied by the masterpiece approach, and without abandoning the scorching attention to films implied by the generique, I need to introduce another French term, optique, so as to give French cinema access to something outside itself, access precisely to the culture of the 1930s. CULTURAL SPHERES AND THE NOTION OF OPTIQUE\n\nIn his first major book, he Degre zero de V ecriture, Roland Barthes called on the concept of ecriture to open a wedge in Jean-Paul Sartre's binary literary theory.33 For Sartre, literature could be reduced to an interplay of language and style: the one general, universal, and impersonal (as in a generique); the other idiosyncratic, spontaneous, authentic (as in a masterpiece). Barthes found this view suffocating and ahistorical. By ecriture he meant to designate the limited plurality of literary options available in any epoch. Barthes's term motivates both my investigation into cultural history and my understanding of aesthetics as these work together to locate what was artistically or rhetorically available. Because it is dependent on cultural history, the notion of ecriture allows for the development of movements, for shifts in taste, for competition and variety among audiences. It helps make concrete the mysterious operations of the auteur (who chooses a particular aesthetic option before contributing personal style), while at the same time it specifies the aesthetic and cultural fields within which artworks make their mark. By optique I designate ecriture's equivalent in the domain of cinema. Optique is meant to retain the original structuralist connotation Barthes first intended for ecriture, a connotation that has been largely lost after the term's assumption into the complex theories of Jacques Derrida, Julia Kristeva, and others. More pertinently, optique suggests the ocular and ideological mechanisms of \"perspective,\" both of which aptly play roles in the medium of film. Finally, its position in the dictionary allows optique to carry an echo of option, of a limited set of possibilities alive at a given moment in a specific cinematic situation. Although it can be conveniently used to differentiate groups offilms,in fact the most genuine application of the term optique as I conceive it involves the specification of audience expectations, needs, and uses. It is in this sense that poetic realism can best be seen as an optique. Among types of filmmaking in France during the 1930s, it exercised the option that has most deeply fascinated film scholars and international audiences. The restricted narrative scope of these films, their heavy atmosphere and sustained largo, hamper the vision and the understanding of audience and characters\n\n20\n\nCHAPTERl\n\nalike, forging a complicity between spectator and drama that one does not find in any other type of film in that era. For example, \"entertainments/' whether comic or social, catered to a spectator who paid to enjoy and judge what was displayed, while historical films and propaganda were meant to impress and instruct a spectator whose applause or assent was requested. Renditions of boulevard theater successes, to take up the most ample genre of the decade, aimed to set admirable acting, dialogue, and plots before an audience that gathered precisely to admire such performances. These representative types of films traded in different ways on spectatorial distance and discernment, be it the discerning of quality performance, or of tough political analysis, or of the pattern in a clever intrigue. Poetic realism, on the contrary, does not flaunt its talent or authority. It is, as I shall repeatedly show, and despite appearances, nontheatrical in its methods and, more crucially, in its mode of address. When examined alongside other films of the 1930s, the poetic realist text seems to invite its spectators onto the screen, seems to invite them to merge with the sensibility it expresses. The spectator plods forward hand in hand with such a film, unconscious of any voice behind the screen, be it satiric, consoling, analytic, or knowledgeable. The spectator of he Jour se leve is as helpless as is its doomed victim. Who was this spectator, and why was this somber cinematic optique appealing? We know poetic realism earned prestige among sophisticated audiences prepared to take some risk at the movies. Might this not be the same audience who would shortly applaud the closely related existentialist aesthetic of Albert Camus and Sartre? Poetic realism lays claim to such an elite reception by disingenuously laying itself open as a type of direct \"experience.\" The ordinary tragedies of daily life, so deliciously repeated in such films, are not rendered homiletically as in a sermon about the poor and downtrodden, but are figured directly. Poetic realism promises to deliver not a message about frustrated desire, or oppression, or bartered hopes, or helplessness, but the very experience of these feelings. Such an aesthetic function was neither forged by the genius of a handful of auteurs nor inevitably ground out of a mindless moviemaking machine. It owes its existence to historical and cultural circumstances that involved strong directors and the conditions of the industry, to be sure, but that, more specifically, were characterized by the particular rapport the cinema developed with renegade literary, musical, and artistic figures during the heady days of the Popular Front. In turn, the aesthetic forms spawned by this optique affected the standard films of the day, the other arts, and the whole cultural atmosphere. In order to find these films consequential, one does not have to believe that poetic realism helped bring the Popular Front to power (its heyday came about only later) or helped the Third Republic fall (though this is what the right wing claimed). The press they received at home and abroad testifies to their public prominence. I plan to look at both the films and the culture for the\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n21\n\nsource of that prominence, practicing a hermeneutics that strives to understand the culture from the films and reciprocally that teaches us how to watch the films from the culture. Between the high road of political history and the folk path of personal biography lies the varied landscape of culture, a landscape whose ecology features the complex and contradictory interplay of institutions, expressions, and repressions all subject to the force fields of power. The cultural historian bears, to the limit, the burden of the contested middle, by insisting on a stance between the already hermeneutic enterprises of the critic and the historian. Refusing to stop at the boundaries of texts, as do most critics, yet unwilling to seek an era's \"imagination\" by direct, disinterested investigation (philosophic or historical), the cultural historian proceeds, by methods of supple interpretation, to read and weigh culture in texts and texts in culture. In this way the logic of changing values can be understood as felt. Every history that treats the cinema must calculate the importance of films within a world larger than film. From the perspective of the film scholar, culture surrounds the film like an atmosphere comprising numerous layers or spheres, as numerous as we want. One may identify these as though they successively encompass one another moving from the center (the individual film) out toward the stratosphere of political structures and events. Intermediate layers might include the film industry, film history (the tradition of genres, the biographies of filmmakers), the status of the other arts, the institutions of culture, and the organization of social classes. My revision of French film in the 1930s derives in part from the spheres I choose to emphasize (the nebulous zone between high art culture and popular culture), but it derives more certainly from a belief in the permeability of all spheres. The fluidity of its object forces any cultural hermeneutics to abandon the hope of full command over its \"material,\" but by devoting itself to complex interaction, it can observe disturbances in one sphere affecting the situation in another. Moreover, the direction of this interactive flow is reversible, although it is usually tracked from the top down. For example, a change of government may bring in a new minister of education or of leisure who promotes the expansion of literary journals. These journals may, in turn, promote an aesthetic that works its views on the legitimate theater. Ultimately film acting, including the kinds of roles created for, or chosen by, key actors may literally encourage a specific cinematic style, amounting to a significant alteration in the way the culture represents itself on the screen. Cultural interaction can be treated as a continual trickle-down process from government to popular expression only in states exercising the most rigid political control. The fact of censorship is a notorious reminder of how governments themselves can be disturbed by images bubbling up from beneath the cultural surface. Who can forget the way the French ministry flinched at\n\n22\n\nCHAPTERl\n\nviolent filmic discourse or at local vigilante groups whose intermediate discursive spheres might include the Church (the case of Luis Bunuers VAge d'or, 1930) or the educational establishment (Vigo's Zero de conduite, 1933). Censorship is an index of the power that films evidently deploy beyond the sphere of the strictly cinematic. No history with aspirations of thickly representing an era's cinema can ignore this traffic among spheres, in this case between texts and institutional structures. Beyond keeping all spheres actively in mind the film historian ought to identify the most pertinent sphere within which to track the (shifting) values of cinema. Pertinence depends both on the researcher and on the topic under scrutiny. Take the period that concerns us. In establishing the special relevance of a particular cultural sphere containing subgroups such as the Surrealists and the novelists published by Gallimard, I mean to challenge a study like that of Francis Courtade, for example, whose Les Maledictions du cinema francais examines French films within the atmosphere of official history (political proclamations, censorship rulings) and official events in the film world (technological innovations like sound, economic developments like the fall of Gaumont). In certain revolutionary eras such as that of the Soviet Union of the 1920s, Courtade's focus seems apt; the Soviet film historian ought to follow very closely the major events of public life, since cinema explicitly participated in a national reawakening. But in the interwar period of France, cinematic values were forged and debated less in the political sphere than in the cultural sphere, or rather in the nebulous zone where transactions between high and popular culture were possible. The effect on cinema of personalities from the established arts outweighs, from my perspective, all governmental and most economic pressures. And so the involvement in cinema of novelists and publishing houses, classical composers, painters, architects, and playwrights is more than anecdotically significant and is meant to do more than validate a popular art. Such involvement testifies to changes in the function of cinema and helps specify the direction such changes took. This cultural sphere is pertinent precisely because it identifies the site of development in a cinema that, from the perspective of other spheres, can hardly be said to have changed at all. In brief, a cultural history of cinema must reconstruct the options of the times, neither through the direct appreciation of its products nor through the direct amassing of \"relevant facts,\" but through an indirect reconstruction of the conditions of representation that permitted such films to be made, to be understood, even to be misunderstood, controversial, or trivial. I have determined to put into focus the address of films, because, as a spectator myself, it is the films that seem to address me. By examining the event of their broadcast, the situation in which they first spoke in the way they do, one avoids the narcissism of teleological histories that force the past to submit to the rule of the present and that neatly suggest a single world of the movies.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n23\n\nThe films that beckon us are entrances to a different way of being a spectator, not totally different (else how could we ever intuit that something lies there for us?) but different enough to tempt us to construct the spectator to which they are addressed. Thus the historian must understand not their style so much as the optique that makes them possible, and that at the same time models a possible world that can still be fleshed out. As a historian, I am a spectator ready to become another spectator.\n\nImpressionism Surrealism: The Origins of an Optique\n\nOPPOSITE PAGE:\n\nBroken Blossoms. BFI\n\nand\n\nEVERY redescription of a phenomenon succeeds in overcoming the shortcomings of its predecessors only through the help of a key concept or word that must itself remain unquestioned and in a sense magical. My word is pronounced in the title of this chapter, optique. Untranslated it retains an essential imprecision, throwing its arms around films, events, persons, and other elements that, when seen globally, construct a significance for the movies that is pertinent to the past and the present. As an optique poetic realism encompasses more than a style or a genre, though only certain styles and genres could conceivably belong to it. By introducing aspects of cultural function and audience address, optique involves a plethora of heterogeneous elements that interact in making up in this case \"poetic realism,\" embedding it in historical and cultural life. I say \"embedding,\" rather than \"dissolving,\" for the term optique credits the presentiment that what we call poetic realism is more than a concoction of the critics, that its sensibility—a manner of representing and valuing experience in pre-World War II France—can be intuited by attentive viewers from other places and later times. As an optique (a sensibility, a function, and a mode of address) rather than a genre or a style, poetic realism belongs to more than the four years of its abundant flourishing (1936-1939). To explore the historical possibility of what I have called a cinematic possibility surely involves identifying elements of style or subject matter that bear a \"family resemblance\" to aspects of the definitive films of Marcel Carne, Julien Duvivier, and Pierre Chenal; but it equally involves the search in the years prior to 1936 for something\n\n26\n\nCHAPTER2\n\nequivalent to the particular role poetic realism assumed in its heyday. Specifically the neighboring optiques known as Surrealism and impressionism can be scrutinized not just for the themes and techniques that later show up in the films of the late 1930s, but for the attitudes toward the cinema inculcated by what can only be called the \"cultures\" of these movements. Why not begin with a hint provided by the critics of the time? \"Poetic realism\" ingratiated itself with audiences through the \"calculated naivete\" with which it represented life, one oxymoron fertilizing the other. In this lies both its charm and its limitations. And in this it drew on attitudes and strategies that preceded it in Surrealism, in impressionism, and in the films both these movements in turn had valued.\n\nFEUILLADE: A SOURCE DISOWNED AND RECLAIMED\n\nAsked in 1962 to assess the specifically French contribution to world cinema, Alain Resnais was only too happy to count himself one of the inheritors of that combination of popular instinct and intellectual mantle which I have claimed as the most salient features of the national pedigree.1 Resnais would amend the cliche about French cinema's double parentage in Louis Lumiere (realist) and Georges Melies (fantasist). For him, as for me, Emile Zola is the name of the father of the French cinema, Zola and such popular \"spiritual descendants\" as the authors of Fantomas, Marcel Allain and Pierre Souvestre. At the very moment Lumiere and Melies were exploiting the technology of the cinematographe, these popular storytellers were preparing the tastes of the nation for large-scale social melodramas that employed the familiar and quotidian details of life as a lure into a world full of exciting and often disturbing surprises. Resnais singles out Louis Feuillade as \"one of my gods,\" because he brought this sensibility into the movies.2 This sensibility would inform the work of many of the most revered French directors and would give shape to the nation's most characteristic cinematic proclivity, ultimately labeled \"poetic realism.\" Carne, Rene Clair, Jean Vigo, Jean Gremillon, Jacques Becker, and Jean Renoir form the trunk of this great tree to the top of which Resnais adds the comic Jacques Tati and among whose roots he implicates Feuillade's two antagonists of the 1920s, Louis Delluc and Jean Epstein. Despite his reputation as one of the most coolly intellectual of directors, Resnais likes to date his own interest in the cinema from a childhood experience in 1936 with the exciting serials of Feuillade. He could not resist \"in Feuillade this prodigious poetic instinct that allowed him to fashion Surrealism as easily as he breathed.\"3 Regretfully Resnais ruminates, \"I could have been made a member of SAF, that imaginary Society of the Friends of Fantomas which was founded before 1914 by Guillaume Apollinaire and Max Jacob.\"\n\nIMPRESSIONISM AND SURREALISM\n\n27\n\nResnais inherited this hybrid fascination (with the popular Feuillade and with the avant-garde Apollinaire) from those Surrealists who in the late 1920s were already reminiscing about Feuillade's anarchist villains.4 The disdain for the moneyed classes, the conspiracies and paranoia, indeed the hatred of growing up that Feuillade evinces, were perfectly tailored to the Surrealist personality and worldview. These feelings would seep into poetic realist movies when Surrealism had largely run its course. Feuillade's impact on the industry, particularly his blending of studio decor with location shooting, had an indelible effect on French cinema. The mythology disseminated in his films shows heroes and villains surfacing and disappearing across a dangerous topography of streets, alleys, department stores, warehouses, railyards, and townhouses. It is a seductive mythology that even the impressionists drew on in their own way. As critics, the impressionists had dismissed Feuillade's serials as lowbrow, but as filmmakers they often adopted a general atmosphere of mystery and alienation hovering above modern city life. The differences between the two can be reckoned in the split personality of melodrama, the Ur-form both descend from. On the one side lie Feuillade's convoluted plot reversals, misconceived identities, and epic scope. Impressionist melodrama, on the other, reduces plot to a skeleton that protects within it a delicate motif. It then emphasizes ' melos\" rather than \"drama,\" excessively\n\nLes Vampires: Urban anxiety. BFI\n\n28\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nand redundantly expressing the emotional significance of that motif through multiple stylistic registers. These two distinct avatars of melodrama served two quite different cultural functions. Like ballet and opera, the stylistically complex impressionist films appealed to an elite audience, whereas Feuillade specifically saw the cinema within a mass entertainment context. It was primarily on these grounds that the Surrealists were proud to support Feuillade and satirize the impressionists. One must not forget that the Surrealists, peculiar and extreme though they may have been, traded in popular images and motifs even while proclaiming a Utopian cinematic project that could only outrage a public looking for comfortable diversion. The Surrealists hoped to reestablish something akin to Les Amies du Fantomas, perpetuating the sensibility of cutting-edge figures like Apollinaire and Pierre Reverdy who, even before World War I, had pointed to the popular cinema as the site of activity for any culture worthy of the twentieth century. Impressionist cinema they found unworthy, a throwback to old-fashioned ideas of tortured subjectivity, delicate expressiveness, and fussy images. By contrast, in their artistic production the Surrealists aimed for what today we might call hyperreal representations, claiming Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Erik Satie as forebears. Recall Un Chien andalou (1929). In the non sequiturs of its intertitles (\"Au printemps,\" \"Huit ans apres,\" and so on), it pokes fun at the convoluted tenses and moods invented by such serious poets of the cinema as Epstein. At the same time these intertitles playfully recall the childish narrative drive exploited by Feuillade, a drive that the impressionists perverted in their allegiance to the purportedly higher aims of photogenic The Surrealists were only too glad to come to the rescue of Feuillade, who was treated with disdain by the critical establishment of the 1920s. In 1929 Andre Breton and Philippe Soupault paid homage to Feuillade by writing a play, Le Tresor desjesuites, for Musidora, the head Vampire of Feuillade's serial. This was the second script dedicated to the haunting actress; in 1920 Colette had authored the screenplay La Flamme cachee for the actress she believed best represented the modern era.5 In 1932 producer Pierre Braunberger remade Fantomas with Paul Fejos as director. Although Fejos's film disappointed Braunberger's hopes, attracting neither support nor critical discussion, it can mark for us the idea of an integrated audience that arrived with the decade of the 1930s and the technology of sound. Between these two vehicles for Musidora, and between the original and the remake of Fantomas—during the period Richard Abel calls \"the first wave\" (1915-1929)6—a drastic differentiation of audience and art function developed. Colette gave way to a new, haughtier type of critic. Intellectuals insisted on their own film culture and produced their own films. For most of them Feuillade and his virtually interminable serials (Tih-Minh, Judex, Barrabas, Les Deux\n\nIMPRESSIONISM AND SURREALISM\n\n29\n\nGamines, all shot between 1917 and 1921) became the emblem of a mindless and aesthetically dull commercial medium. He was the target at whom Delluc aimed his clarion call for the development of a superior national cinema, led by men and women not afraid to take chances with their images and stories. Delluc employed a vocabulary of \"risk\" in attacking Feuillade, concluding one barrage: \"You have at your disposal all the means necessary to undertake and carry out great things. What are you going to do?\" Feuillade answered in his own way: \"I consider the cinema to be a place of relaxation, of pleasure, of sweet emotion, of dream and forgetfulness. Others want to make of it a temple of the abstract, the bizarre, even of hallucination and deformity. That's their business.\"7 Now the Surrealists were certainly given over to the bizarre and to hallucinations, but not so much in the realm of film form. They thought of themselves as ethnographers (a la Georges Bataille and Michel Leiris) rather than as poets. They wanted to explore cruelty, sexuality, and obsession, Feuillade's stock-in-trade. The pure successivity of the plots of his serials fascinated them. Feuillade's storytelling must have seemed as primitive as sexuality and ritual, which they also studied and furiously celebrated. Les Vampires (1915-1916), for example, is studded with uncanny occurrences and motifs that later would show up in films by Luis Bufiuel. When one of the villains falls into a booby trap as he tries to enter a forbidden room, a large nail pierces his hand. An extreme close-up of the oozing wound prefigures the ants that crawl from the center of the hero's palm in Un Chien andalou. The perverse close-ups of the villains' bright lips that bracket this image add to the incipient Surrealism of Feuillade's narration. Bunuel must also have been thrilled by a gratuitous flashback later in this same film wherein a bull is mercilessly killed, its carcass cluttering up the outdoor set. Such strange and abrupt occurrences, strung together by farfetched intertitles, would fuel the Surrealist imagination. Robert Desnos wrote a fabulous poetic tract called \"Complainte de Fantomas\" for radio broadcast in 1933, just after Braunberger's unsuccessful remake of that subject.8 Earlier the great Surrealist poet had written a hymn to Musidora in her role as the voluptuous villainess Irma Vep: \"How beautiful you are in Les Vampiresl Do you know that we dream of you and that, evening come, in your black outfit, you enter our room without knocking and that, on waking the next day, we seek out the traces of that troubling mouse that visited us in the night?\"9 Desnos was only taking seriously what Breton and Louis Aragon spoke about in 1929. \"You will understand soon enough that there is nothing more Surrealist and at the same time poetic than the filmed serials which not long ago were the joy of those strong of spirit. It is in Les Mysteres de New-York, it is in Les Vampires that we must\n\nsearch out the great reality of this century.\"10 As they all pointed out, there was hardly a street corner in Paris that was not haunted by some mysterious\n\n30\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nadventure from Les Vampires, making for \"a complex interpenetration of the real and the imaginary, a transmutation of the lived by a transfiguration of quotidian space/'11 Clair, the filmmaker most tied to Parisian geography, began his career as an actor in Feuillade's troupe. His first experiment in directing, Paris qui dort (1924), tells a tale worthy of Feuillade in which a mad scientist holds the hypnotized metropolis hostage. In Entr'acte (1924) Clair's debt to Feuillade is visible in the animated cannon that fires on Paris, a motif lifted directly from the Marseilles adventure of Les Vampires. But the most memorable images linking these two filmmakers are surely the haunting silhouettes that both photographed of outlaws scurrying across the distinctive rooftops of Paris. Climbing down rainspouts, Feuillade's vampires create the kind of futurist designs Clair was only too happy to emulate in Le Million (1931). Tellingly, it was not until the end of his life that Clair deigned to credit Feuillade as a master, and to deprecate the chic avant-garde in which he himself had participated. The young filmmakers of the period [the 1920s] were not at all interested in the popular vehicles manufactured by the prolific author of'Judex whom they spoke of with some disdain. But what can be predicted? Today the esthetic experiments of that era are forgotten or no longer arouse much interest, whereas film societies show Fantomas or Les Vampires to respectful houses. Louis Feuillade was not that wrong: his works still have an audience and a particularly alert audience! That would really have surprised Louis Delluc and his friends (that is it would truly have surprised me), if some fortune teller had predicted it to them.12 This is not to say that Feuillade's technique of narration was ahead of its time. On the contrary, its premodern tenor is precisely what attracted the Surrealists who wanted to recover the pure possibilities of cinematic astonishment that had been bartered away by the sophisticated cineastes of the 1920s. His scenes, shot in ordinary locations, take no shortcuts, but inch forward predictably until they reach a culminating moment in some memorable tableau. In the final scene of the first half of Les Vampires, for example, the wealthy of Paris have come dressed in their finest to a ball; suddenly fumes can be seen seeping up from the floorboards. Noblemen lose all decorum in fighting their way to exits. Naturally they find these locked. The Vampires' greatest victory, gloriously photographed in longshot, calls to mind newspaper drawings of the disastrous Bazar de charite of 1897 wherein 140 well-to-do Parisians lost their lives in a cinema fire.13 The first audiences of Les Vampires must have looked around uncomfortably as the lights went up. Feuillade found in hypnosis an even better way to unnerve his spectators, by showing how readily an alien control can, through concentrated vision, utterly take over an innocent person. An engaging scoundrel named Moreno\n\nIMPRESSIONISM AND SURREALISM\n\n31\n\nLes Vampires: The Vampires' greatest victory. BFI\n\nhypnotizes a cohort. Then at the Gaumont Palace our hero Philippe intently watches a newsreel of a burial at Fontainbleau after a shocking assassination. Gradually the diegetic screen grows to full frame, as the Grand Vampire he has been tracking seems to stare directly at him from the graveside. Instantly now Philippe appears on the scene at Fontainbleau, as though sucked into the screen. What an allegory for hypnosis and for storytelling too! Andre Bazin put it best after experiencing a marathon screening, without intertitles, of Les Vampires.\n\nThis story, the meaning of which was a complete mystery to the audience, held its attention and carried it along purely and simply by the tension created in the telling. There was no question of a preexisting action broken up by intervals, but of a piece unduly interrupted, an inexhaustible spring the flow of which was blocked by a mysterious hand. Hence the unbearable tension set up by the next episode to follow and the anxious wait, not so much for the events to come as for the continuation of the telling.14 Bazin points to something apt. The sheer size of these narratives, requiring hours and hours (actually weeks and weeks) to unravel, confers on them a stature that supports the institution of storytelling beyond any given episode. Off and on Les Vampires acknowledges this contract. Marcel Levesque mugs directly to the audience on numerous occasions and in doing so he gains our\n\n32\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\naffection not just for his clownish character but for the storyteller as well. At the same time, such gestures assert the theatrical origins of melodrama. In one of the tale's most charged moments—when Irma Vep at last lays her hands on the lost treasure map—she winks twice at the audience to signal her success. As was the case with many Film d'Art productions and other French silents, the set design underscores its rapport with theater. Several important scenes that pit characters in adjacent rooms are shown in cross section, dollhouse fashion, so that we see both spaces bisected by the interposing wall. One of these scenes has the villain peep through a hole in the wall at a young boy who hides himself in the adjacent room. We observe the observation.\n\nLes Vampires: Haunting silhouettes. BFI\n\nLes Vampires: Generating paranoia. MOMA\n\nPlaying, like Alfred Hitchcock, with the spectator's knowledge diminishes Feuillade's ability to render character subjectivity. His serials generate paranoia by marshaling evidence (inserts of newspapers, maps, and diagrams) and by testing explanations of an evil so pervasive that it seems beyond the powers of civilization to comprehend and control. Poetic realism will express much the same incomprehension before its dark world, but this time from the restricted point of view of a single, ignorant character. While it developed a completely different mode of narration from Feuillade's, poetic realism inherited his ingenuous way of employing settings to suggest the stable qualities of the characters living there and the dramatic surprises that put those characters in danger. The home apartment of the journalist hero of Les Vampires, for example, is replete with bourgeois appurtenances, offering both him and us a place of refuge and rationality. Here he collects his evidence and makes his plans. Feuillade employs a box set here and in other places that serve a similar function, such as hotel rooms and police offices. The simplicity of the staging allows our eyes to rest after the unpredictability we are subjected to on the streets and in public places. The camera setup in these scenes never varies, with the journalist sitting at his desk directly\n\nIMPRESSIONISM AND SURREALISM\n\n33\n\nbefore us in the front plane, writing up a report, talking on the phone, or poring over the facts. This tableau recurs at regular intervals to punctuate the plot and to permit us to assess the complexity of his dilemmas and to consider possible measures yet to be taken. Moreover, the stability of the composition works like a musical motif that becomes increasingly familiar. It is as comforting as the chair where the journalist sits in his dressing gown. But even these privileged"
