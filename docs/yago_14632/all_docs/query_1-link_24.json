The Negro, a musical force, through his own distinct racial characteristics has made an artistic contribution which is racial but not yet national. Rather has the influence of musical stylistic traits termed Negro, spread over many nations wherever the colonies of the New World have become homes of Negro people. These expressions in melody and rhythm have been a compelling force in American music — tragic and joyful in emotion, pathetic and ludicrous in melody, primitive and barbaric in rhythm. The welding of these expressions has brought about a harmonic effect which is now influencing thoughtful musicians throughout the world. At present there is evidenced a new movement far from academic, which plays an important technical part in the music of this and other lands.\n\nThe question as to whether there exists a pure Negro art in America is warmly debated. Many Negroes as well as Anglo-Americans admit that the so-called American Negro is no longer an African Negro. Apart from the fusion of blood he has for centuries been moved by the same stimuli which have affected all citizens of the United States. They argue rightly that he is a product of a vital American civilization with all its daring, its progress, its ruthlessness, and unlovely speed. As an integral part of the nation, the Negro is influenced by like social environment and governed by the same political institutions; thus we may expect the ultimate result of his musical endeavors to be an art-music which embodies national characteristics exercised upon by his soul's expression.\n\nIn the field of composition, the early sporadic efforts by people of African descent, while not without historic importance, have been succeeded by contributions from a rising group of talented composers of color who are beginning to find a listening public. The tendency of this music is toward the development of an American symphonic, operatic and ballet school led for the moment by a few lone Negro musicians of vision and high ideals. The story of those working toward this end is herein treated.\n\nFacts for this volume have been obtained from educated African scholars with whom the author sought acquaintanceship and from printed sources found in the Boston Public Library, the New York Public Library and the Music Division of the Library of Congress. The author has also had access to rare collections and private libraries which include her own. Folk material has been gathered in personal travel.\n\nThe author is happy to acknowledge her indebtedness to the following: To the Boston Museum of Fine Arts for reproduction of the picture of seventh century musician of East India, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City for permission to describe African instruments included in the Crosby Brown Collection of Musical Instruments in the Museum, to the Crisis for permission to reprint poems from that monthly, and to Clarence Cameron White for assistance in reading the proof.\n\nMAUD CUNEY- HARE\n\n\"Sunnyside\"\n\nSquantum, Massachusetts.\n\nJanuary 20, 1936.\n\nCONTENTS*\n\nChapter Page [1st] Page [2nd] [INTRODUCTION] [xi] [xi] I.

One who does not already know of the versatility of this remarkably talented woman will doubtless be amazed at the diversified character of her activities.\n\nMrs. Hare is a pianist, lecturer and writer whose devotion to the highest ideals of her art has compelled admiration. She is the daughter of the late Norris Wright Cuney of Galveston, Texas, and Adelina Dowdy Cuney of Woodville, Mississippi. She was born in Galveston, Texas, February 16, 1874, and was graduated from the Central High School of that city. Her musical education was received at the New England Conservatory in Boston and later under private instructors among whom were Emil Ludwig, a pupil of Rubenstein, and Edwin Klahre, a pupil of Liszt. Following the completion of her work under these masters, she became director of music at the Deaf, Dumb and Blind Institute, of Texas, and at Prairie View State College in the same State. In 1906 she returned to Boston where she married William P. Hare of an old and well-known Boston family, and has since made her home there. She died there February 13, 1936.\n\nAs a concert and lecturer-pianist Mrs. Hare has travelled widely and as a folklorist she has collected songs from far off beaten paths in Mexico, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Cuba. She was the first to collect and bring to the attention of the American concert public the beauties of New Orleans Creole Music as attested by her Creole Songs, published by Carl Fischer and Company of New York City.\n\nAs music historian Mrs. Hare takes high rank. She collected data in this field for more than a generation. She has exhibited her personal collection of Aframerican and Creole music and Early American music which dates chronologically from 120 years ago. As a writer on music subjects she has long been a valued contributor to the Musical Quarterly, the Musical Observer, the Christian Science Monitor, Musical America, and many other newspapers and magazines of the first order. For a number of years she edited the column of music notes for the Crisis. As a writer of distinction outside of the field of music she has attracted wide attention with published works of real literary value. In this list may be included a biography of her father and an anthology of poems called The Message of the Trees.\n\nDuring recent years Mrs. Hare found time to establish in Boston the Musical Art Studio. Together with the musical activities of an art centre, she fostered and promoted a \"Little Theatre\" movement among the Negroes of Boston. Included in the plays produced her original play \"Antar,\" written around the life of the Arabian poet, was staged in Boston under her personal direction. Concurrently with these activities Mrs. Hare has appeared with great success as recitalist, with William Howard Richardson, the baritone, at such educational centers as Wellesley College, Syracuse University, Albany (New York) Historical and Art Association, and elsewhere in costume recitals of music of the Orient and the Tropics.\n\nTo do any one of these things well would be a distinct achievement, but to do all of these acceptedly as Mrs. Hare has done is truly amazing. As a crowning achievement she has now given us an authoritative record of Negro Musicians and Their Music — a book that is more than an anthology, in fact a source book of great value to musicians, music lovers and all others who wish to be well informed on matters of artistic racial development and progress.\n\nCLARENCE CAMERON WHITE.\n\nBoston, January, 1936.\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nAFRICA\n\nEARLIEST TRACES OF AFRICAN MUSIC — DANCES OF WORSHIP — MYSTIC DANCES — RITES OF THE PRIESTHOOD — WAR DANCES — CEREMONIAL DANCES — FESTIVE CUSTOMS — TRIBAL DANCES — DANCE FORMS OF AFRICAN-NEGRO INFLUENCES.\n\nNegro music traced to its source, carries us to the continent of Africa and into the early history of that far off land. We may even journey to one of the chief sections said to hold the music of the past — that of Egypt, for it was the ceremonial music of that land as well as that of Palestine and Greece, which was the foundation of at least one phase of modern musical art. While a continuous recorded history that would so greatly aid in giving knowledge of African art as well as its peculiar type of civilization is not yet complete, we do know that, in spite of the obscurity of the prehistoric period, there existed a great people, as their architectural monuments alone have proved to us.1\n\nThe Copts are a Christian people, descendants of the Greeks, Nubians, and Abyssinians. The Coptic Church is said to have preserved the most ancient and primitive Christian ceremonies.\n\nOn the Gold and Slave Coast every god of note has his own individual dance. The Negroes of the Gold Coast believe in an indwelling spirit, the Kra, or soul; there are two souls, one of which abides with the body at death while the other departs to the land of the dead. Among the indwelling spirits are those which are believed to inhabit trees. A. B. Ellis gives the following terms used for the gods: Orisha (Yoruban), Bohsum (Tshi-speaking people), Vod&utilde; and Edrõ (Ewe-speaking people). The term Vodu is derived from võ (to be afraid), or from võ (harmful). Edrõ from drõ (to judge).2\n\nVodu (voodoo or vaudoo) is the term used at the present time in the West Indies and Haiti, but the superstition long remained among the Negroes and Creoles of Louisiana and was introduced in their dance and song. The deity is the python. Festivals held in honor of the accepted god of wisdom were accompanied by singing and voodoo dancing. The crocodile, called Elo or Lo, had neither priests nor temples; but when canoeing, the canoe men chanted to its praise.\n\nThe use of music in healing is very old. In the psychic life of the African, connected with the Bori religion of the Sudan, we find \"songs of exorcism\" which are performed with various idolatrous methods of healing those whom they believe to be possessed by spirits. In the Nile countries, treatment by tones of the fiddle and the drum continue for seven days when the patient is declared cured. The Goye-player, a fiddler, and in some places a guitarist, plays an important part in these ceremonies. Only outside the Sahara was the drum used.\n\nThe player chants the names of the various alledjenu (spirits), because each deity has his own particular theme in harmony. The proceeding is likened to a duet or musical dialogue between flute and drum, a combination still in use. The combined treatment of religious observances and music, and sacrifices of rams, ending with dancing, is a part of Shango worship.3 We hear much today of the therapeutic value of music, spoken of as being in a new, experimental stage, and yet we find uncivilized people practicing the art in the days of long ago.\n\nDancing clubs representing figures of the god Edju, which is worshipped in North Yoruba, are found made of ivory and of wood. This god dwells at the cross-roads where are placed in his honor small clay cones, around which dances and processions take place at certain annual seasons.\n\nThe early religious belief of the Egyptians — that of many gods — has been preserved in their hymns. The exceptional monarch, Akhenaten (or Aknaton), 1450 B. C., father-in-law of Tut-Ank-Ahmen, devoted himself to the worship of one god and believed that god was manifested in the rays of the sun. His Hymn to Aten has been published in full by Prof. Breasted, Mrs. A. A. Quibell and other Egyptologists. Of spiritual and lofty thought his poem began:\n\n\"Beautiful is thy resplendent appearing on the horizon of heaven,\n\nO living Aten, thou who art the beginning of life. When thou ascendest in the eastern horizon thou fillest every land with thy beauties.\n\nThou art fair and great, radiant, high above the earth;\n\nThy beams encompass the lands to the sum of all that thou hast created.\n\nThou art the Sun; thou catchest them according to their sum;\n\nThou subduest them with thy love.\"\n\nThe land of Osiris, \"the god of the dead,\" is believed by the Egyptians to be that of the West. The Zulus use the word \"west\" as the name of this mysterious spirit-land. The word comes from the verb \"tshona\" to sink or die away, while the complete expression \"He went West\" — Zuva lake la vila — means his sun has set. The expression is common to other African languages. C. Kamba Simango of East Africa gave the author the following Zulu expression of like import: \"Zuva rakwe rabira\" — \"I langa lake li tshonile.\"\n\nWe find that the phrase \"He went West\" which came to us from the World War, was taken from the African soldiers. Natalie Curtis-Burlin in Songs and Tales from a Dark Continent quotes a Zulu love song, a song of grief which Simango also sang to the author of this volume:\n\n\"My Darling stayed in the West, Westward faring, he slept in the West. Alas! Alas! Alas!\"\n\nAmong other songs which Mrs. Burlin recorded through Madikane Cele of South East Africa and Kamba Simango of Portuguese E. Africa, is a song which is supposed to be sung as a farewell by the Familiar Spirit which has entered the Nyamsolo, diviner, when treating the sick. The folklorist likens the condition of the diviner to the trance of the spiritualistic medium of modern times.4\n\nMany of the African folk songs express implicit faith in the god while a host of their old legends attribute magical power to music. From the ancient races of the Mediterranean to the Kaffir of the South, from Mohammedanism to Shâmânism, through blend of races and influence of religion, Africa presents the greatest vestiges of her past — music and song.\n\nThere is unmeasured length from the practised contortions of the voodoo worshippers of heathen tribes, to the rhythmic grace of a Ballet Russe, but the distance is not so great from the ancient dances woven around an incident of pre-historic times to the interpreters of the Scherazade Tales. Alike in spirit, both are indicative of the storyteller's \"Once upon a time\" —\n\n\"When the sun goes down, all Africa dances.\" Such is the popular saying of the explorer and traveller. The dance is interwoven with every conceivable custom. While the licentiousness of some of the primitive dances have been commented upon by certain spectators, the society dances of the present, tolerated and accepted by the most highly civilized nations, are less than a stepping stone from the gyrations of a heathen people.\n\nThe earliest traces of music in native Africa are found in the dances of worship. No matter what form of religious cult was practised, music took an important part in its ritual. Many of the dances are connected with the rites concerning the mythological gods. One of the most interesting of the worship dances is the fire dance, performed at the great seven-day festival accompanied by drum-beating of the Batta drummer. A mystic dance practised by the Tshi-speaking people on the Gold Coast, between the Assini river and the Volta, is part of the ceremonies connected with the worship of the tutelary deities.5 The Dako Boea Dance, to the Great Father, the sacred deity of the Nupe tribe in West Africa, in which the presence of the Great Spirit is invoked, is no longer practised, for the custom has been forbidden by the missionaries.6 A mystical dance of the Bushmen is called nagoma by the Basutos. When a man is ill, this dance is performed around him and is continued throughout the night by men and women who follow each other. The dancers are supposed to have supernatural power.\n\nAmong Ewe tribes, dancing is a special branch in the education of both priest and priestess. They must be very proficient in the art, and practise for months in order to acquire the necessary agility. The boy and girl recruits who have studied three years for the priesthood, dance before the King at the Annual Custom. During their novitiate they are taught the dances and chants peculiar to the worship of the gods. The dances among the Ewe tribes are always performed to the sound of drums. The addugba is used for the ceremonies. Another dance connected with the priesthood is that of the Tshi-speaking people of the Gold Coast. When new members were tested for the priesthood in Freetown, the following ceremony took place: The company drums were used, and as the drummers struck up their beat, youths and men raised a song in honor of one of the deities of the company. Just as there is a special hymn for each deity, which is sung to a special beat of the drum, there was also a particular dance for the same; the priest is under the influence of the individuality of a tutelary deity of the company, as soon as he places his hands upon the drum. In honor of this deity, drums give out the rhythm, the singers begin to chant and the priest performs a dance.7\n\nThe war dances are the finest of the African dances, and perhaps the most important of these is the Dance of the Spears. Usually, when the dances are about to begin, they are heralded by sounds from the fiddle (goye) and guitars (molo), accompanied by the drums. When the drums are grooved, they are held before the player who scratches them with his nails as they are turned around. There is a spear song and dance that comes from the Thonga of South Africa.\n\n\"Let us stand fast! Let us stand fast!\n\nDo not let your strength go,\n\nIt would help the enemy to conquer.\"8\n\nDances connected with ceremonies of state are attended by elaborate preparations and magnificent display. Of great event are those that are held at the coronation of the kings. In West Africa, after the conclusion of the coronation festivities, a dance is held in the open square in the center of the town. The best singers, clappers and other musicians come to take part, led by the Zobas or \"Country Devils,\" the best dancers of the country. One to three hundred trained women dancers go through many intricate figures.9\n\nThere are also festival dances. In the territory of Sierra Leone we find what is known as the Hammock Dance, which is one of a number of festive exercises. Another festival dance known in British West Africa is called the ugowa and is danced only at the high festivals of the Zanzibar. Thought to be of magical power, the instrument called kinandi-kinubi is brought out and borne about the town while the dance is performed to its accompaniment.10 A dance of the Kafirs which continues from sunset to sunrise is the ugoma. It is accompanied by a large kettle-drum which receives its name from the dance. Performed to drums of like name, is the ukonje which is danced by the Mpongwe, the Gaboon and the French Congo tribes. The Bushmen are particularly fond of dancing by moonlight. They possess a variety of dances pertaining to social customs, each of which has its appropriate chant. One dance imitates the actions of different animals.11 Among a variety of dances of West Africa is the ziawa which is accompanied by song. Another is the mazu in which there is much gesticulating with the arms. A third, the timbo, is the common native dance. On fine evenings, it is customary for professional strolling singers and dancers to go from house to house dancing and singing for the amusement of the wealthy. One of their song-dances is named the ngere.\n\nIn all civic ceremonies and social institutions pertaining to christening, marriage, death or the political life, the dance ranks in importance with the feast. It has place in the training which the youth receive in the societies of learning in West Africa — the Beri and Sande institutions.12 At the close of a young man's education in one of the societies, classified as these institutions are by age, he is quite likely to meet the girl of his choice, but a long courtship ensues before the marriage takes place. After the season of probation is over, the wedding is solemnized. In the Bantu country, South Africa, a wedding dance is known as the khana. The dance consists of leaping and springing up and down with a quivering of the body. The leaps from the ground are made exactly upon the certain note when repeated. This dance extends over the period of the celebration which lasts as long as the bride-groom's relatives provide oxen for slaughter. There are intervals, however, for feasting and for rest. The movement of the men in the dance is different from that of the women. Their mode of dress differs, of course, according to the particular tribe.13 The native social dance, bamboula, is opened with the beating on the tom-tom.14\n\nThe perfection of the African dance rhythm has produced comment from all those who have been privileged to witness the performances. It is well marked, always emphasized by the instruments. The time signatures of 2/4 and 4/4 are found oftener than 3/4 or 6/8.\n\nDancing was the principal part of the songs called \"The Songs of Ronga.\" The dances were performed after harvest. They were taught to the boys and girls, who became proficient in them. Now no longer practised, newer dances having taken their place. The Zulu mudjatu and muthimbo became popular only in turn to be succeeded by the shiloyi in which the performers sit and execute movements in imitation of boat rowers.\n\nIt is a significant fact that the youth of the coast are summoned by the chief to take part in the dances, and, while it is not obligatory, it is expected. This causes the conjecture that here perhaps is the beginning of a native ballet!15 A few years ago, Adolph Bolm, the Russian Mime, of the Imperial Ballet School in Petrograd, expressed a desire to stage a Negro ballet with people who had a perfect understanding of that race. He believed that the effect would be thrilling. From the mythological history as expressed through the medium of the African dance, a ballet, replete with the imagery of the people, may yet be evolved under patronage of chiefs and kings.\n\n[CHAPTER II]\n\nNotes, Chapter I\n\n[Page 2]\n\n1 Dr. Merlin W. Ennis, archaeologist and anthropologist for the American board for foreign missions, 30 years working in Portuguese West Africa, has been excavating in the heart of the African jungles. Excavating at the Cunene and Kukai rivers, he discovered pyramids indicating a pre-historic civilization. Natives told of a drum in the shape of a hyena, reputed taken from a royal tomb. (1933.)\n\n2 Ellis, A. B., The Ewe Speaking Peoples, p. 29.\n\n[Page 3]\n\n3 Frobenius, The Voice of Africa, Vol. II, pp. 524, 562, 567, 570.\n\n[Page 6]\n\n4 Curtis-Burlin, Natalie, Songs and Tales from a Dark Continent, pp. 24-145.\n\n[Page 7]\n\n5 Frobenius gives a vivid description of one of the mystic dances in the land of the Muntshi, a pagan people and a freedom-loving nation very much feared by other tribes. Having secured the good will of the people, he was allowed to witness one of the mystic dances.\n\n\"Then — what is that peculiar looking ornament shining on that beautiful woman's neck? What a curious, bird-shaped hairpin it is which she is putting into her neighbor's head-dress! What extraordinary bronze spirals decorate the foreheads of the men! How beautifully forged the spear-heads and the iron rings and chains! Just look at that beautifully shaped bronze tobacco pipe; there is no doubt but that we are among a people whose art and industrial development stands high indeed.\n\n\"Evening falls . . . A huge wooden signal drum is pushed into the middle of the Square, little field drums as well as flutes and a kakatshi trumpet taken as a war trophy from the Fulbes, are brought along too. The moon goes up. The folks have foregathered in their hundreds from the surrounding villages, laughing and chatting. The first taps of the drum resound: the flutes join in and develop a charming air to which some men dance a measure. All the hundreds assembled begin to move their shoulders and hips. The time gets quicker — the steps get quicker and stronger. More flutes join in until the whole of the vast, old, primeval forest re-echoes with the tunes and the glad shouts of the joyfully excited throngs of the human beings who madly whirl about in circles.\n\n\"Separate dancers perform here and there. The melodies are changed. The musical sense tries to obtain fresh combinations and variations of rhythm. The shrieks of the women grow sharper and sharper: the shouts of the men become louder and wilder. A passionate excitement I have never before in all my experience witnessed seizes the crowd. We enjoy the sight till far into the night.\" Frobenius, The Voice of Africa, vol. I, p. 214.\n\n[Page 8]\n\n6 \"Formerly, those who took part in the dance were masked and in appearance evidently not unlike the \"devils\" of the early carnival days in the French West Indies. Two of the masquers, on stilts, many feet high and draped in flowing robes, dance along together. Those who danced around these figures were in their normal dress, except the upper part of the body was unclothed.\n\n\"A striking feature of the dance were the devotional songs chanted in rhythm to clapping hands by a group of women who gathered about the tree-trunk. The burden of their prayers to the mighty Dako-Boea was that they might be blessed with motherhood. In front of the singers danced a single figure drawn from the group that danced in ectasy before the symbol of their ancient god.\n\n\"It is remarkable how the dances and songs of Africa lead to ethnological facts. Tracing a bit of melody, one finds an old legend and through the myth or folk-tale the prehistoric life of a people is discovered. In 1874, amid the highest mountains of South Africa (the Maluti) and the overhanging rocks that form caves, George Stowe and J. M. Orpen found pictures of dancing figures. Of their mythological significance, Dr. Bleek, a scientist, wrote that it was \"an attempt at a truly artistic conception of the ideas which most deeply moved the Bushman mind.\" Frobenius, The Voice of Africa, vol. 1, p. 216-7; Dr. Bleek, Folk-Lore, June 30, 1919, p. 155.\n\n[Page 9]\n\n7 For the benefit of many writers of \"African Dances\" in art-music, the following description may not be amiss:\n\n\"The drummers at once struck up the rhythm. . . . After a few moments the priest stopped (his dance) and putting his head on one side, indicated that the god who now possessed him could not hear the song in his honor — the singing was not loud enough or the particular drum rhythm was not sufficiently marked. — The song and drumming stops; a new start is made. This is repeated until satisfactory; then the priest dances furiously, bounding in air, tossing arms, but keeping perfect time to rhythm of the drum. This must require long practise and great endurance, for the dancer has naked feet and no springy board of floors, but the inelastic earth. Another god enters him and again wild dancing, and then the utterance of oracular sentences.\" Ellis, A. B., Tshi-speaking People of the Gold Coast of West Africa, p. 138.\n\n[Page 10]\n\n8 Henry M. Stanley glowingly described this as a phalanx dance of great volume and color, \"The phalanx stood still with spears grounded until at a signal from the drums, Katto's deep voice was heard breaking out with a wild triumphant song or chant, and at once rose a forest of spears high above their heads, and a mighty chorus responded. . . . There was accuracy of cadence of voice and roar of drum.\" Faces were turned upward, heads bent back; right arms shook clenched fists on high as every soul was thrilled by martial strains. Then heads turned and bowed earthward with thought of the desolation of war-ridden lands and widows' cries. But again heads were tossed backward, \"bristling blades flashed and cracked and the feathers streamed and gaily rustled. There was a loud shout of defiance and such an exulting and energising storm of sound that man saw only the glorious colors of victory, and felt only the proud pulse of triumph.\" Stanley, Henry M., In Darkest Africa, vol. I, p. 436.\n\n[Pages 10-12]\n\n9 \"Bowditch writes of the Pyrrhic dance which was performed at a reception given him in the Spring of 1817. He gives a vivid description of barbaric splendor:\n\n\"Met by a crowd of 5,000 people, largely warriors, who greeted the party with martial music, they were halted in order that they might witness the Pyrrhic Dance which was performed in a center of a circle of warriors, where flags, English, Dutch and Danish were waved. The Captains held spears in their left hands, while affixed to a long chain held between the teeth and right wrist, was a scrap of Moorish writing.\n\n\"The bands, of which there were more than one hundred, were composed principally of horns and flutes with innumerable drums and metal instruments. Each band had its own peculiar tune for its particular chief. One hundred or more large umbrellas were sprung up and down by the bearers and as the canopies were made of scarlet, yellow and the most brilliant silks and crowned with crescents, pelicans, elephants' ears and swords of gold, all of various shapes, with fantastically scalloped valances, the startling and brilliant effect may easily be conceived.\n\n\"The State hammocks were raised in the rear. Large drums, supported on the head of one man and beaten by another, were bound around with the thigh-bones of their enemies and ornamented with their skulls. Kettle drums were scraped with wet fingers. Wrists of the drummers were hung with bells and peculiar shaped pieces of iron. There too, were smaller drums — prolonged flourishes of the horns and ever the deafening beat of drums.\n\n\"The dance was witnessed by many native dignitaries who were of the king's escort — the Chamberlain, the Gold Horn-blower, the Captain of the Messengers, the Captain of Royal Executions, the Captain of the Market, the Keeper of the Royal burial-ground and the Master of the Bands.\"\n\nAnd then, Bowditch continues, \"The royal stool, entirely cased in gold, was displayed under a splendid umbrella, with drums, 'sehukus' (native stringed instruments), horns and various musical instruments cased in gold, about the thickness of cartridge paper. The swell of the bands gradually strengthened on our ears, the peals of the war-like instruments bursting upon the short but sweet responses of the flutes.\"\n\nThose who wish local color in their pageants, such as has been given in recent years depicting visually the history of Africa, might profitably turn to the vivid pictures of royal settings of the African dance as given years ago by Bowditch. — Bowditch, Mission from Cape Gold Coast Castle to Ashantee, pp. 246, 255. 1819.\n\nOccasionally, the King takes a part in the dance. Schweinfurth was privileged to witness in 1870, a performance by Munzo, King of the Monbuttoo — (According to \"scientific observations,\" he makes the deduction that the Monbuttoo are of Semitic origin, most thoroughly impressed upon their countenance, to which in particular, the nose very much contributes.) Describing the dance, this traveller writes:\n\n\"First of all a couple of horn-blowers stepped forward and proceeded to execute soli upon their instruments. These men were advanced proficients in art, and brought forth sounds of such power, compass, and flexibility that they could be modulated from sounds like the roar of a hungry lion, or the trumpeting of an infuriated elephant, down to the tones which might be compared to the sighing of the breeze or to the lover's whisper. One of them, whose ivory horn was so huge that he could scarcely hold it in a horizontal position, executed rapid passages and shakes with as much neatness and precision as though he were performing on a flute.\"\n\nFollowing the professional singers and jesters, the king himself, takes part on the program, making a speech and afterwards assuming the role of a conductor. The baton used was a hollow rattle. After a return visit to Schweinfurth's camp, the king arranged a feast in celebration of a successful raid over the Momvoo. The festival reached its climax mid-day when the king, himself, danced in the presence of his wives and courtiers. It was held in the noble saloon, a royal hall which the explorer calls one of the wonders of the world. George W.

The tee-tees, or young girls, are adorned with bracelets of palm leaf fibre encircling the arm and wrists, their body nets being made of cotton to which are attached small iron plates jingling as their owners dance.\n\n\"The dance is sometimes weird and fantastic, especially the 'devil dance,' and is accompanied by the inevitable 'sangboi' or drum, and a 'sehgura' or kind of guitar made from a hollowed gourd with seeds threaded on strings to make a sharp, metallic sound. At the end of the dance, women spectators rushed into the circle and embraced the dancers.\" — \"Negro Social Life in West Africa,\" Journal of Race Development, Vol. IV, Oct. 19. H. O. Newland, Sierra Leone, p. 125.\n\nA mask dance of the Ronga and Thonga tribes of South Africa, is called the \"Mayiwayiwane.\" The mask has its traditional significance. Frobenius found in West Africa that \"reverential remembrance\" is embodied in a like ceremony of Nupes — \"When Egedi, the founder of the young Empire came into the country some 475 years ago, the Dako-Boea, a mask of several yards in height, stood upon his canoe. When Gushi, one of the oldest rulers of the land died, his corpse vanished and the mask referred to rose up where it had lain — the associated idea of growth into manhood, the unfolding of masculinity out of the neutrality of childhood.\" — Frobenius, The Voice of Africa, Vol. II, p. 395.\n\n[Page 14]\n\n13 A description, however, of the garb of armed attendants of a chief in southern Africa who took part in the dance, is interesting:\n\n\"Their figures are the noblest that my eye ever gazed upon, their movements the most graceful and their attitudes the proudest. Standing like forms of monumental bronze, I was struck with the strong resemblance that a group of Kaffirs bear to the Greek and Etruscan antique remains, except that the savage drapery is more scanty and falls in simpler folds; their mantles, like those seen on the figures of the ancient vases, are generally fastened over the Shoulder of the naked arm, while the other is wholly concealed; but they have many ways of wearing the carosse. In the dance, they threw their carosses off and forming a semi-circle, bowed their heads low and bounded upwards with a spring. Our interpreter sung a Kaffir song which was soft and pleasing, for their language is in an uncommon degree musical.\" Rose, Cowper, Four Years in Southern Africa, p. 84.\n\n14 \"Pierre Loti, Le Roman d'un Spahi, chapter II.\n\n[Page 15]\n\n15 Junod, Henri A., Life of a South African Tribe, pp. 167, 181.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nAFRICA IN SONG\n\nLEGEND AND FOLK TALE — SINGING IN GENERAL — EXTEMPORANEOUS SONG — HARMONY AND RHYTHM — TRIBAL CUSTOMS AND SONGS — HARMONY AND FORM — PRESENT-DAY CHARACTERISTICS — NATIVE AFRICAN MUSICIANS AND OPERA. 1: Drums; 2: Stringed instruments; Harp-type-psaltry, Lute and Bow-played; 3: Vibrating Sonorous Bodies, Marimba, Flutes, Trumpets, and Horns; 4: Lesser instruments.\n\nWe have seen how the content or significance of the African dances may be traced in the legends of that continent. In like manner, many of the songs are found based on a fable or folk tale, or descriptive of a social custom of a tribe or nation. Here, through music, we find a related myth that has existed for centuries. Had the explorers of Africa been musicians as well as archaeologists, they would have appreciated the mighty ally of song which was at their hand, and their historical researches would have been expedited.1\n\nTHE AFRICAN DANCE\n\nAN AFRICAN PAINTING\n\nWe know how the animal stories of Negro-Africa have been assimilated in American literature by Joel Chandler Harris in his Uncle Remus Stories. Many episodes of the \"Romance of the Hare\" alone are found in Bantu folklore. \"Brer Rabbit\" as the American version of the African hare is an emblem of cunning and wisdom.2\n\nTraditions of the Kanuri people are handed down from generation to generation by a school of sages known as \"kogolimas\" or story-tellers. Grégoire says, \"The Negroes have their troubadours, minnesingers and minstrels, named Grals, who attend kings, and praise and lie with wit.\" A peculiar class of professional musicians which may be found nearly everywhere in Africa, make their appearance decked out in the most startling apparel — feathers, roots and bits of wood, with other emblems of magical art. Whenever a listener is discovered, he begins at once to recite details of his travels and experiences, in a chanting recitative. The Arabs have bestowed upon them the name of hashash (buffoons). Wandering minstrels, they are held in light esteem by the Niam Niam, who call them nzangah.3\n\nIn the Senegal, minstrels who frequent market-towns, have what is called a song net which is made of a fishing net. On this all manner of things are tied — tobacco pipes, bits of china, bird's heads, feathers, reptiles, skulls and bones, and every object bespeaks a tale. The passer-by selects an object and asks the price for the song. Bargaining ensues; finally a price is agreed upon and the purchaser listens to the song. The saying is that when these singers die, they are put into trees.\n\nThe fantastic \"song net\" reminds one of a home owned by a very aged colored couple in a Tennessee city of the United States. It stands on the outskirts of town, on the road that leads to a well-known college. The trees in front of the house are literally covered with bits of brightly colored glass, glazed crockery, parts of broken earthenware and scraps of gayly flowered china — broken pieces of every known article of a crockery store — and these fastened in the trees! Was it possible that this aged man and woman were the progeny of Senegal minstrels? No one could give me an answer to the riddle.\n\nAFRICAN MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe principal legend of the Songhay, a nation that dwelt on the Niger, is called the \"Originator of the Race.\" From it is taken the \"song of Nana Miriam,\" composed to celebrate the slaying of the Nile-horse. Miriam, the daughter of Owadia, primal ancestor of all the Sorko tribes, was taught all her father's magic arts. By her incantations, she killed all the river-horses (the hippopotami), that had destroyed the rice fields. Only one she spared because it was a Nile mare in foal. Fara Naka rejoiced, saying, \"What a splendid daughter is mine! Nana Miriam I thank thee!\" Then he summoned the Kié (Dialli or troubadours) singers. He composed a beautiful song and taught the Kié to sing and play it. All the people in the land, all the singers, all the fishermen, all the Sorko sang the song of Nana Miriam. And since that time whenever anyone makes a charm for hunting the hippopotamus, he always chants over it the name of Nana Miriam.4\n\nThe songs of the Africans are chiefly a species of recitative or chant with a short chorus. The soloist gives the melody while a chorus sings a refrain, which at times are but ejaculations. The chief singer remains standing while the members of the chorus are seated around him; and as the melody is given out, they turn to one another, each improvising in turn. Their power of invention and improvisation may last for hours. Expert in adapting song to current events, they indulge in mockery, ridicule, and sarcasm, or in flattery or praise of men and happenings.\n\nA song of the bridesmaids offers advice which would occasion great surprise if it were followed. It is from a collection noted by Mrs. Audeoud in Maputju: \"Do not go with him.\" The women friends, upon accompanying the bride to her new home, sing:\n\n\"Whither goest thou, mother? Whither goest thou?\n\nThey will bring thee the basket full of maize and the fan, my mother!\n\nWhen thou hast finished crushing it, they will make thee crash it again, my mother!\n\nWhen thou has plastered the floor, they will make thee plaster it again, my mother.\"5\n\nOther songs are sung, not only to the bridegroom and to the relatives, but to the neighbors, for the marriage is a community affair. All the songs are in a mocking vein, rather than in a sentimental one.\n\nThe writer to whom we are indebted for the information above also tells of certain rites pertaining to the festival season which is characteristic of the Bantu. One of a number of the \"first fruit rites\" says, \"The nkanye is a beautiful large tree, called by the English the Kafir plum. It bears a small golden yellow fruit which ripens in January. The first ripe makanye (plural) are gathered and the sour liquor, which is made from it, is poured on the tomb of the dead chiefs in the sacred wood, who are invoked to bless the New Year and the coming feast which is about to be celebrated. The new beer is first drunk by the warriors of the army — it has been medicated to prevent them, by a mysterious spiritual influence, from killing any of their comrades during the festive weeks. There are singing and dancing and rejoicing that the men be spared in battle.\"\n\nBefore the closing day of the carnival which is almost in the nature of an orgy, the payment of the tax — a large portion of makanye — must be made to the chief. The women, as they carry the wine to the town, sing the following chorus: \"Hi! Hi! We seek the hawk! Who soars — In the sky! Hi! Hi! Who is the hawk? — It is Muzila — It is Muzila!\"6 In this carrier song (there are a number of them) Muzila, the chief, is compared with the mythical \"lightning bird,\" — with the hawk that \"swoops down from the clouds.\"\n\nOn the Gold Coast, thanks are returned to the gods for having protected the crops. As in other sections, there are apparently two seasons, one in September when the yam crop is ripe; another (Ojirrah) in December when the crop is planted. A minor festival, Affi-nah-dzea-fi, is held in April. The September festival of the Ashanti is commenced by loud beating of drums.7\n\nNot only in the agricultural life does the native rejoice in song, but at home as well as abroad, all industrial labor is lightened by music. Much of the travel in Africa is carried on by water-ways. Canoeing or rowing is the favorite manner in which this is done. Wallaschek in quoting Ernst von Weber, says, \"The Balatpi reminded Weber of Venetian gondoliers or of the lazzaroni in Naples. One would improvise a strain which others would immediately sing in chorus to a charming melody. Each in turn improvises thus, so that all have an opportunity of exhibiting their talents for poetry and wit.\"8\n\nIn Newlands' description of canoeing in Sierra Leone, he writes, \"Boat-boys would stand on the bottom of the boat and place one leg upon the seat. Then they lift themselves upon the seat with both legs and while still rowing, each would throw one foot backwards and upwards into the air, balancing on one foot and not relinquishing the oars. At same time they chanted a dirge-like ditty or sang some song, although evidently to them inspiring, had yet to me a melancholy strain of sadness. . . . The boys beat the kettledrums vigorously and the bugle rang out.\"9\n\nThe exclamation Eji (Aië) found at the close of many African verses is typical of the shield struck by the spear. The war song is stopped at a given signal, immediately the shields are elevated and a hissing ngu-ngu-ngu is heard through the crowd. From this comes the word ngunquzela, meaning to stop a war song.\n\n9a\n\nThen there are war dances.10 The Bantu of South Africa give war-dances (gila) at which time medicine is given the soldiers to make them invulnerable. It follows the war-song. Usually there is but little change of position in the dance, and the movements may consist of simply moving the head and hands with a slow motion of the feet. Always the war-dances are accompanied by old chants, many of which have been noted. One of them, which is the oldest of the Nkuna, dates back to 1820. It was sung before the Zulu invasion before the arrival of Manukosi, in the early XIX century. The dialect is Thonga.11 In the gila a single dancer detaches himself from the circle of warriors and stamps with all his strength on the ground. He beats the earth with one long tread followed by three short ones, all the time brandishing his weapons. His place is taken by a younger man who leaps like an antelope. If the troops are detained in going to battle the young men go dancing to the king to ask permission to go forward.\n\nHenry M. Stanley in Darkest Africa describes the Phalanx Dance which was given to celebrate a victory. In the afternoon, one thousand warriors gathered and joined the men, women and children whose voices arose in song high above the drums. The main chorus was that of the Wanyamwezi, called the best singers on the continent, while the Bandussume under Katto, brother of Mazamboni, led the warriors to the Phalanx Dance.\n\nThe African boat songs of yesterday may be the origin of our sea-chanty of today. Even in far off Africa the chanty had its use.12 All these songs help us to trace history.\n\nIt is said that the scientific world was first told of the wonders of the pre-Mohammedan era in Africa by the French, who had carried on early excavations there. The old Arabian explorer, El Bekri, who visited the Hausa in 1050 A. D., told of the red mounds that are still seen in the region of the lower Senegal, as having been ancient royal graves. But the list of the dead kings, then of the second dynasty, is found through the medium of a song which was chanted at the funeral festivals. The singers, so the old \"fairy-song of the Nupes\" goes, called each of the great chiefs by name, and told the number of years and months of his reign.13\n\nThe old story as told in detail by Frobenius, fantastic as it is, makes interesting reading. Of particular interest to us, however, is the fact that important historical knowledge of the time before 1275 is given the world through song. Describing the \"god-like memory\" of those who lived before the time of the written word, the writer tells of the gaffers who still recall the song which was sung when workmen toiled in the building of pyramids, centuries old, and claims that every archaeologist can quote extracts from the natives. While this is true, it is to such scholars as Junod and Frobenius that we are indebted for unparalleled accounts of the musical traditions of the black continent.\n\nAmidst the Tshi-speaking people of West Africa,14 dancing and singing in honor of the deceased take place at funerals. Decima Moore and Major F. G. Guggisburg in We Two in West Africa tell of funeral songs being heard that were sung by a score of women who went up and down the street dancing a weird measure. They clapped hands in time to their song and circled around and around a man singer, who sang short soli at intervals, the chorus of the dirge being taken up by the women. The song and dance were kept up for days by hired mourners. Always there was the accompaniment of the drum.\n\nGeorge W. Ellis, formerly of Chicago, who was at the town of Bomie when the Vai king died in 1904, stated that, following a death, a large feast is spread and while songs are given, drums announce the festivities of the day. There are many mourning songs descriptive of the loss of a family or tribe. Following the official period of mourning for the dead chief, the African coronation is held, an occasion of great moment. Among many tribes it is a military affair in which the people declare their loyalty to the new chief and he in turn to them. In parts of South Africa the war dance known as the gila or giya, is followed by the guba, which is a solemn chant used interchangeably as a coronation chant, a war song, a funeral dirge or patriotic hymn.\n\nThe classical war song of the Tembe and Maputju which inspired Coleridge-Taylor's fine piano transcription \"Lo-ko-ku-ti ga\" (At the Break of Day), originated at the coronation of Muwai who reigned at the close of the eighteenth century. He was the great, great grandfather of the chief Mabai who was deposed in 1896. Muwai, whose son Makasana reigned from 1800 to 1850, is compared to the rising sun, and the words are thought to recall a coronation at daybreak.15 Before going to war and during coronation ceremonies the army sings this old coronation song in praise of the royal family. Notice is called to the change from minor to major and its return to the major mode.\n\nSir Richard Burton gives many instances of dancing and singing in connection with the \"Grand Customs\" about the time of the New Year, 1864. He has many interesting things to say of this very old festival which was founded upon a religious rite, and which included human sacrifice and the slaying of captives. His work would have been more valuable, however, had he not so often descended to flippancy and ridicule. His lack of sympathy with the people of whom he wrote prevented him from discovering the underlying significance of the mystery dances and songs. He tells of sundry dances at which Amazons (women soldiers) chant to a single cymbal, and then to a full band. This was followed by a mock dance of \"So,\" representative of the Thunder god, which he considered buffonery without any mystical meaning. At the king's \"So-sin Custom\" armed women sang dirges in the minor key, clapped hands and presented arms, after which followed a dance given by six Amazons. These women excelled in the chanting of Nago songs.\n\nIt has been long thought that African folk-song has a harmonic background. However, Ballanta, a native of Sierra Leone who has been making musical researches in West Africa under the auspices of the Guggenheim Foundation, wrote in the Journal of West Africa, of July 14, 1930, that \"there is no perception of harmony as the term is understood in music.\" He continues:\n\n\"What enters into a musical expression by way of tone combination is a highly developed form of polyphony, which may embrace two, or at most three parts. This polyphonic form is the freest from the point of view of concords and discords, and it is preponderantly rhythmic; that is to say, each part preserves its individuality. There appear to be no conditions as to the succession of intervals; and although there are evidences of the use of some intervals rather than others, especially in the cadence, one could not prove the rule.\n\n\"The perfect fourth is the basis of harmonic combinations; that is, where two parts sing together tone by tone. Towards the cadence, however, other intervals may be used as the major third and the major second; but the major third is in all cases treated as discordant, whereas, the major second is accepted as a concord.\n\n\"Taking the major diatonic scale as a standard, although that scale gives imperfectly the sounds produced, the fourth and seventh of that scale are not fundamental tones in the African perception, but subordinate tones. The principal tone in African perception is that group of tones answering to the second major diatonic scale; the tones next in importance are the fifth and sixth being the fourth below it. The other two tones are subordinate and are used for cadential purposes, or otherwise, to divide the interval of the perfect fourth. This appears to have been the original perception.\"\n\nBallanta then concludes, \"Each one of these standard tones now has what may be called tones in opposite phases with it. These other tones stand at the distance of about a quarter tone above and below the standard tones and are used for and instead of the standard tones; that is to say, they rarely follow each other, so that the actual intonation of a quarter tone is rare.\"\n\nJunod says of native South African harmony, that it certainly exists, even if not always easy to detect. When you hear a chorus of beautiful voices singing in two or three parts, you at once perceive great differences between their system of harmony and ours. These choruses are by no means disagreeable, but are very strange to our European ear. . . . I have succeeded in fixing the two parts of the song of Zili which can be considered typical; I owe it to two girls of Lourenco Marques, who had clear voices and lent themselves willingly and with great patience to the long inquiry. One will notice a curious succession of fourths and sixths quite unusual in our music. . . . The fourth seems to be more acceptable to the Bantu ear than the third or the fifth.\"16\n\nThe author of this volume has heard a quartette of Bechuanas sing native songs in harmony with half-tone inflections, although the melodies were simple as were the words, after those of a South African proverb. Guided only by the ear, they improvised harmonic parts to the leading voice.\n\nWe should note here also present-day characteristics. Ballanta, who travelled about 7,000 miles in research work in his native land and collected over 2,000 specimens of African song, found that the African melodies did not always consist of short melodic phrases of only two or four bars endlessly repeated, but that there existed melodies of from twelve to sixteen measures without the appearance of one repetition. This he found true of the Mende (Sierra Leone), Susu (French Guinea), and Munsi (Northern Nigeria) tribes. The most interesting melodies were those of the tribes of the middle region, that had not been influenced by outside culture. Ballanta noted a most interesting example which was a flute solo with vocal chorus which he heard sung by over sixty voices at Makurdi, the town-seat of the Munsi tribe.17 In describing the dance songs he adds, \"The highest class is the artistic dance of the Yorubas. Cross rhythms in abundance. In these dances one meets with characteristic rhythms; that is to say, rhythms which have meanings ascribed to them in directing the dancer how to proceed; they act as cues, not necessarily with reference to a change of dance steps, but with reference to action, either to retire, or to come forward, or go backward. They are the beginnings of the drum-talking system.\"\n\nIn an essay read at the International Colonial Exhibition of Paris during the International Congress of Ethnography, by M. Félix Eboué, a Negro from French Guiana, graduate student of l'Ecole Coloniale and chief colonial administrator, it was stated that among the Oubanguians who do not know writing, the choruses are sung only in middle range, as the children alone have high voices. According to Eboué-Tell, who had collected thirty-two songs, the minor modes predominate. The measures are in 4/4 or 2/4; the phrases short with ever-changing variations, the longest melodies never over eleven measures while the shortest was that of five.\n\nIn the Banda songs from Baubi the language is so musical that they could be written \"by means of musical notation as with syllables of our alphabet.\" The words are reproduced on the tom-tom lingua (drum) but they can also be spoken in tune with European musical instruments.18 Stephen Chauvet in La Musique Nègre, (1929) describes the beauty of the music given by characteristic chanting of the porters and voyageurs, with the improvisations which are delicate and subtle, reminders of the song of the troubadours of the Medieval epoch.\n\nToday we find African song creeping from its native heath and arousing curiosity and interest in the concert hall. In London during the music season of 1932, a concert of Bantu songs and rhythms was given by the natives named Montsieloa, Dube and Marimbela. The songs were sung in Zulu, Sesuto, Lizosa, Matebele and other African languages.\n\nMme. Grall, wife of the doctor-in-chief of the medical Corps of Bambari, who is completing her studies of the African song and speech, makes interesting observations on the connection between African words and instruments. As the D minor triad for a basis, she writes that \"the linda (drummer) speaks by striking the linga so as to reproduce exactly the rhythm of his own words and the different tones of his dialect. Even the children understand the messages. . . . Whenever a message is about to be transmitted, the 'broadcasting station' summons those who can hear it by a series of strokes, in which it names those to whom the message is to be given. The beginning phrases may vary among stations, according to the 'mokhoundji linga' or drummer, but all of them mean, 'So and so, listen to me.'\"\n\nAFRICAN DRUMS\n\nCertain words are always represented by the same notes and rhythm, and thus Mme. Grall finds it is possible to distinguish a musical vocabulary of the Banda language. It is interesting to note that a South African native, Mark Radabe, conducting research in 1932, with the idea of presenting an opera, the development of the Bantu principles, would portray the Zulus in Basutoland. During the year of 1932, R. C. Nathaniels, a West African composer, gave recitals in Vienna for similar reasons.\n\nOther performances have also invited attention to these characteristics. In July, 1933, a group of African singers, accompanied by dancers and the Royal Ashanti Drum Corps under the direction of Duke Kwesi Kuntu, gave performances at the Century of Progress Exposition at Chicago. Prior to their American visit, Dr. M. J. Herskovits, of Northwestern University, and other anthropologists witnessed their entertainment abroad. According to the American press, the fourteen \"well-poised, beautifully molded black men with drums four and one-half feet high . . . gripped, stirred, and thrilled an audience of people from all parts of the world, in most fantastic and rhythmic ceremonial dances.\"\n\nKykunkor, \"The Witch Woman,\" a native African opera, the music by Asadata Dafora, a native of Sierra Leone, West Africa, was the artistic sensation of the music world when presented in New York during the season of 1934. The director, Asadata Dafora Horton, who came to New York in 1929, is an African singer and dancer. For some time unrecognized, he struggled to gain a hearing for Negro music that was more than the accepted jazz. Receiving unstinted praise from John Martin, dance critic of the New York Times, who heard an early presentation of Kykunkor in the Unity Theater Studio, the musician was successful in having the dance opera performed in the Chanin Auditorium, New York, and elsewhere. An act from the opera was broadcast in June, 1934.\n\nThe libretto of this African opera is based on a folk legend of love and marriage, and the setting is that of an African village. Effective use is made of traditional chants and dances. Leopold Stokowski, who with Lawrence and other noted musicians have praised Kykunkor, is said to have asked that he be taught the intricate African rhythms as exhibited by the drummers. Abdul Assen in the role of the witch doctor, showed remarkable dramatic ability. The opera was given at the Newport Casino, Newport, Rhode Island, during late August, 1934.\n\nAlthough it is true that dance and song enlivened all sections of Africa, we have long turned to Egypt for first knowledge of music and musical instruments. According to Dr. L. S. B. Leak, who has made a study of conditions in East Africa (1932), recent excavations there give evidence that the history of man goes back to an age greater than in any other section of the world.19 It is not surprising that many Negro-African instruments show a kinship to many of those found in Egypt, since centuries of commerce and conquest brought into close contact many races of men — Arabian and Moorish, Assyrian and Persian, Ethiopian and Egyptian. Egypt learned much from the purely Negro Africa, and the latter from the former. It is said that stringed instruments owe their origin to Negro Africa.\n\nThe African tom-tom, the drum, although not always used as a musical instrument, is of unusual importance. It is claimed that in a hot climate, the older the drum gets the tauter the string becomes. The method of tuning is by placing the instrument over a fire to contract the skin or in water to expand it. The drum has three distinct and separate usages — by the priests in worship, by the youth in affairs of love, and by chiefs and rulers in military life. However, there is no custom or ceremony connected with daily life but that the drum has a share therein. No march is undertaken without the call of the drum, and it is also used as the hunters prepare for the leopard hunt. In the Tshi-speaking country, the announcement of all festivals is made by beating of the large state drum at sunset after which signal, songs and discharge of fire-arms break out from all quarters of the town. The harvest festival in September, lasting a fortnight, is commenced by the beating of the drums. Among the Kafirs, there are drum-calls for all occasions. Besides the all-night drumming to scare away wild animals, there is the summons at day break which is known as the reveille. Much importance is laid upon the morning summons.\n\nThe African tom-tom has had parallels abroad. Daniel Alomia Robles, a Peruvian musician and archaeologist, has a flute which was found in one of the old tombs in Peru. Among the old Inca instruments, some of which are over 3,000 years old, is a 5 string harp. Of the 4 note instruments, the scale was found to be Re, Fa, Sol, La, later enlarged by the interval of a third, which is a complete Inca pentatonic scale. Mr. Robles claims this is in advance of the Greeks. As we know, this Inca music, later absorbed by the Spanish, was again modified by African influences. In this the \"marimba\", or xylophone, a native African piano, was an important factor.\n\nMARIMBA OR XYLOPHONE\n\nIn Puerto Rico, as in the Virgin Islands, the guiro or juiro (pronounced \"weero\"), is the most popular instrument. It is seen everywhere and is the main instrument of percussion used in that section of orchestras and bands. Here the juiro is made of hollowed gourds, cut with, many small grooves and decorated with simple motives and two or three cut-outs. The one in the possession of the author is made to resemble a fish. The juiros, made of various sizes, are stroked with a steel wire or hair-pin. The author has listened with amazement to the extraordinary playing of a Negro juiro performer in the Puerto Rican Municipal Band under the conductor, Tizal, in San Juan. The many and varied rhythmic effects and the rapidity with which he produces syncopated notes, makes him the center of attraction to tourists who listen to the outdoor concerts given in the plaza.\n\n[CHAPTER III]\n\nNotes, Chapter II\n\n[Page 16]\n\n1 René Bassett, noted folklorist, says that certain episodes mentioned in South African stories are to be found in the folklore of the ancient Greek and Roman, the modern French and Italian, and in the Scotch and German as well. He gives an explanation of the phenomenon in which he declares that there may be such a similarity in the minds of the various races when still in their primitive phase of development, that they have invented the stories independently — or that they belong to primitive humanity and all the races have taken tales with them in their migrations and in contact between the various races, the tales have spread all over the world. — Revue des Traditions Populaires, \"Les Chants et les Contes des Ba Ronga,\" June, 1918.\n\n[Page 17]\n\n2 The tales of Africa are very old. A Sudanese proverb reads: \"Salt comes from the North, gold comes from the South, but the word of God and wisdom and beautiful tales, they are found only in Timbuctoo.\" Not only in Jenne, the ancient city which played so important a part in the Sudan centuries ago, but throughout Timbuctoo an entire class of the population was devoted to the study of letters, and here not only talebearers of the old legends are found, but a collection of ancient manuscripts as well. Among the histories found here was one written by Abderrahman Es-Sadi who recorded events before 1656. Of the libraries owned by educated natives, Ahmed Baba declared, \"Of all my friends I had the fewest books, and yet when your soldiers despoiled me they took 1,600 volumes.\"\n\nIn the old manuscripts the old writers who also copied books, as material was scarce, were called sheiks — termed \"marabuts\" by the Sudanese of today. When the marabuts were asked why they did not write more books instead of making records, the explanation closed with this illuminating statement which arouses the sympathy of musicians as well as writers, \"Sometimes we are asked to write talismans and to copy books, but that does not give us sufficient to live upon. Many are obliged to devote themselves to commerce and absorbed by the care of not dying of hunger, how can they find time to write?\" Du Bois, Felix, Timbuctoo, the Mysterious, chap. XIV, p. 319.\n\nThe author was told by a learned African, the late Professor Aggrey, that among the Fantis the people resort to the telling of facts and the description of events on wood, not because of ignorance, but because of the prevalence of destructive white ants which causes the people not to attempt the saving of papers.\n\n[Page 18]\n\n3 Schweinfurth, H., The Heart of Africa, vol.

T. BURLEIGH.\n\nDuring 1913-14, James Barnes the novelist and war explorer, collected a number of folk songs in Central Africa. The music was recorded by the use of a reproducing phonograph. \"It was surprising to me,\" says Barnes, \"to find how similar African music is to that of the Negroes in America. That is evident to one who is not a professional musician. As you will see from our films, many of the dances are like those which our southern Negroes have made familiar, such as the cake-walk and the shuffle. We can only approximate the music, of course, for they use intervals that are strange to our ears.\"1 It is quite likely that the feelings of the Negroes in America were expressed in the manner of the primitive music of Africa and that the first generation should unburden their troubled souls, and voice their homesickness in a medium familiar to them. Krehbiel remarked that \"they contain idioms which were transplanted hither from Africa, but as songs they are the product of American institutions.\"\n\nWithin the past few years, a number of native African youths have come to this country for study. Possessing intelligence and musical talent, they have been able to give valuable information regarding African music, and at the same time they have made a study of the art of Negro America. Foremost among these are C. Kamba Simango of Portuguese East Africa, a former student at Hampton Institute and Columbia University, who has been heard in African song and playing native instruments. Another was Madikane Cele of Southeast Africa, a product of Hampton Institute, who returned to his country as a minister and later revisited the United States with a group of African musicians who gave performances for the benefit of his missionary work on the East Coast. Still another was Nicholas J. Ballanta of Sierra Leone, who studied at the Institute of Musical Art in New York.\n\nOne of Ballanta's compositions was played at a student recital in New York in 1923. Shortly before this, he conducted a number of his works at a Negro pageant given at Symphony Hall, Boston. Just at this time, Kathleen Easmon, a girl of mixed blood, a native of Sierra Leone, a prize-winner in London institutions, brought the message of African music to America; and in Brooklyn, New York, Boston and elsewhere she gave native dances that were surprisingly beautiful in their imagery. This young woman, who returned to Africa as the bride of Simango and assisted him in his educational work for the natives, died in London in August, 1924. Some of her poems were set to music by S. Coleridge-Taylor.\n\nOf this quartette, Nicholas Ballanta was privileged to continue scientific research into the musical conceptions of the people of Africa for comparison with the musical systems of European races, by a grant from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. The scholar states that African music does not survive in its primitive purity when brought into contact with other music systems. Outside influences are shown in different ways. \"In the Yorubas in and around Lagos, the effect of this influence is found in the melodic perception, and not in polyphonic or harmonic content. In the Sherbros the influence shows itself in both perceptions; the tribes use major and minor thirds as consistently as American Negroes do.\"\n\nBallanta has concluded that the alteration is seen to be: \"(a) The substitution of the perfect fifth for the perfect fourth as interval or association; (b) the use of the major third instead of the major second as interval of harmonic definition; (c) the exclusion of ternary divisions of the single beat in the rhythmic perception, retaining only the duple divisions, in which, in order to satisfy the craving of ternary divisions, these duple divisions are grouped into three plus three plus two instead of four plus four. It is significant, however, that in those places where the influence is Eastern the African retains his own perception of tone combination.\"2\n\nThis can be accounted for by the strong affiliation between the Oriental and African systems in which the intervallic melodic line and tonal embellishments are alike practised. Examining a number of Negro folk songs, we find that in the majority of them the cadences progress downward and that the phrase ends before the first accent of a measure just as is done in true African song. Negro song in America did not command attention before 1835; however, Sir Grove speaks of melodies ascribed to the American Negro having been printed in London as early as 1782. In June, 1800, the Boston Review notes the reprint in the United States of the African song heard by Mungo Park, the explorer, the words of which were adapted by the Countess of Devonshire, and set to music by G. G. Ferrari.\n\nThis is thought to be the first Negro African song printed in English.\n\nThe winds roared and the rain fell,\n\nThe poor white man, faint and weary\n\nCame and sat under our tree.\n\nHe has no mother to bring him milk,\n\nno wife to grind him corn. Chorus Let us pity the white man, no mother has he,\n\nThe loud wind roared, the rain fell fast,\n\nThe white man yielded to the blast;\n\nHe sat him down, beneath our tree\n\nFor weary, sad, and faint was he;\n\nAnd ah, no wife or mother's care\n\nFor him the milk or corn prepare. Chorus The white man shall our pity share,\n\nAlas, no wife or mother's care\n\nFor him the milk or corn prepare.\n\nThe storm is o'er; the tempest past\n\nAnd Mercy's voice has hushed the blast.\n\nThe wind is heard in whispers low;\n\nThe white man far away must go! —\n\nBut ever in his heart will bear\n\nRemembrance of the Negro's care. Chorus Go, white man, go — but with thee bear\n\nThe Negro's wish, the Negro's prayer;\n\nRemembrance of the Negro's care.\n\nThis song is interesting, mainly, in its expression of the kindly and sympathetic qualities found in African character, and it is not an example of Negro African or Negro American song in its purity.\n\nIt is noticeable that before interest was aroused in the inspired and extemporaneous song of the race, Negro minstrelsy was practised by plantation groups of gifted slaves who were allowed to entertain plantation guests. As a forerunner of black-face minstrelsy, a troupe of comedians under the direction of Louis Tabary (1791), appeared in New Orleans giving their shows in houses and tents, and finally in a theater on St. Pierre street between Royal and Bourbon. Shortly after, white groups were formed, and with their unique style of entertainment, the stage setting, a half moon of black faces, an interlocutor \"star,\" the jocular end men and for music, bones, tambourines and guitars, they gained widespread reputation here and abroad.\n\nOn July 17, 1873, white men with blackened faces and grotesquely clothed, gave a performance in Cincinnati, Ohio. This was said to be the first authentic \"Negro Minstrel\" troupe. But troupes of minstrels were known in New England some years before this time. Major Dumbleton's Ethiopian Serenaders, active in 1844, played in London in 1848. Jerry Bryant, whose real name was O'Brien, was of this troupe, but later he led the Bryant's Minstrels with his two brothers, Dan and Neil, and was prominent in the North in 1857. Jerry died in 1861, but the company, said to have been an excellent one, continued for some years. In 1868, their program included operatic burlesques.\n\nIn 1859, Bryant's Minstrels introduced \"Dixie's Land\" which became one of the most popular songs of the nation. It is said to have been written for this troupe by \"Dan Emmett,\" who published the song in 1860. There is a controversy as to the authorship. A correspondent writes in the Boston Evening Transcript that he heard the song in Cincinnati in the early part of 1859, when it was played by Menter's Military Band. They had been engaged for a parade in New Orleans and had brought back this striking air with them. It was said to be of Negro origin, the sentiment having originated not from the use of the Mason and Dixon Line but from the currency. In Louisiana, prior to 1860, citizen's notes were printed both in French and English. Among these were popular ten-dollar bills which bore the French term \"Dix\" and were commonly known as \"Dixies.\"\n\nEight early versions of the song are found in the Brown University Library (Providence, Rhode Island), under the De Marsan's broadsides. Emmett's \"Dixie's Land\" was printed on a program of September 12, 1859, and described as \"Emmett's Original Plantation Song and Dance.\" It was also entitled \"Dixie's Land, Ethiopian 'Walk 'round'.\" The first two lines read:\n\n\"I wish I was in de land of cotton,\n\n'cimmon seed an' sandy bottom.\"\n\nAs early as March 19, 1860, the song was featured by the Rumsey and Newcomb's Minstrels in New Orleans engagements.3\n\nTwo different stories have been told as to the origin of the century old song, \"Jim Crow,\" as featured by Thomas D. Rice (1808-1860), known as \"Dady Rice.\" The Louisville (Kentucky) Courier Journal, editorially claims:\n\n\"The origin of Jim Crow can be traced directly to Louisville. Tom Rice was playing at one time at the old Louisville Theatre, which stood at Fourth and Green (now Liberty), and behind the theatre there was a livery stable where an amusing old man worked. His name was Jim Crow, and Rice and the other actors had taken to watching him as he went about his work in the stable yard. Laurence Hutton, in his 'Curiosities of the American Stage,' quotes a description of Jim Crow written by one who had seen him:\n\n\"'He was very much deformed, the right shoulder was drawn up high, and the left leg was stiff and crooked at the knee, which gave him a painful, but at the same time ludicrous, limp. He was in the habit of crooning a queer old tune, to which he had applied words of his own. At the end of each verse he gave a peculiar step, 'rockin' de heel' . . . and these were the words of his refrain: 'Wheel about, turn about, do jis so, an' ebery time I wheel about I jump Jim Crow.'\"\n\n\"Rice watched the unconscious comedy of this performance, and determined to imitate it. One night he persuaded Crow to come and sit in the wings and to lend him his clothes. When Rice appeared on the stage in rags and tatters, crooning the tune and doing his jerky little step, the audience was delighted. The actor, however, had made his performance sure-fire by inventing numerous verses to the Jim Crow melody which dealt with local celebrities and affairs of the day in Louisville, and these little jingles brought down the house.\n\n\"The next morning the song of Jim Crow swept over Louisville, and the whole town flocked to the theatre to see Tom Rice do his wonderful act. Soon other cities had a chance to laugh at the antics of the comic Negro, and Rice's fame spread like wildfire, New York greeted him with wild enthusiasm, and thus, it was, that black-face comedy and minstrelsy got their start.\"\n\nAnother popular version maintains that while playing in Cincinnati in 1830, Thomas Rice heard a Negro stage driver singing a tune, the refrain of which ran, \"Turn about and wheel about an' do jist so, an' every time I turn about, I jump Jim Crow.\" Rice immediately secured the song and used it at an opening performance in Pittsburgh. Joseph Jefferson when quite a young boy had first stage experience in Rice's Minstrel company. Others who later become famous, secured their first practical knowledge of the stage, as did many Negro singing actors on the minstrel boards. Among those thus associated in their early years were J. K. Emmett, Edwin Booth, Edwin Forrest, Nat Goodwin, Fred Stone and Chauncy Olcott.\n\nEdwin F. Christy claimed to be the first to organize a Negro minstrel and has been called the father of minstrelsy. An act which he featured was James Madison Morton's farce given as \"Box and Cox\" — \"Africanized expressly for George Christy by E. Byron Christy, Esq.\"4\n\nThe Buckleys, James, the father, with his three sons, Richard, George and Frederick, perhaps the first to harmonize Negro tunes, made their appearance with other performers in New York and Boston in 1843. They used their own name until 1844, when having given shows in New Orleans, Louisiana, they changed their name to that of \"The New Orleans Serenaders.\" Philip Hale places the date of the Buckleys' appearance under their new name in the North, as that of November, 1848, at the Bowery Theatre. Meanwhile they had toured Europe.\n\nDescriptive names of the black face form of minstrelsy which white performers adapted included those of the Virginia Minstrels followed by Congo Melodists (Boston, 1842), Ethiopian Serenaders, the Sable Harmonizers, and the Nightingale Serenaders. Beginning the 12th of September, 1932, Joseph Weber and Lew Fields celebrated their partnership in minstrelsy by a Golden Jubilee of two weeks' radio performance.\n\nAbout 1865, the Georgia Minstrels, a Negro troupe, was organized under the leadership of George B. Hicks and later directed by George Callender. The company consisted of twenty-one Negro performers, many of whom were trained musicians, capable of a higher class of work. Outside of the theatre, they entertained in church concerts and private homes. The stage manager, Richard G. Little, possessed a remarkable bass voice of considerable range. John T. Douglass, of New York, and William (Billy) Kersands were members of this troupe when they toured Europe in 1877 and sang before the Queen of England as late as 1883. Members comprising the company in 1877-8, four of whom had been music teachers and three writers of music, were (besides those mentioned above), F. E. Lewis, Samuel Jones, William Elmer Lyle, James Emidy, Peter Devonear, George Cooper, Robert Mack, David Scudder, James Grace, Oct. Moore, R. Emidy, Robert Hight, Charles Anderson, James Fernand, Messrs. Thompson and Gaines, and William W. Morris, interlocutor.\n\nIn America they were hailed as \"masters of minstrelsy.\" In the West, according to the Cincinnati Commercial, they drew better houses than any white troupe. P. T. Barnum said of them, \"They are extraordinary, and the best I ever saw. They fully deserve their large patronage.\" While in the East, the Boston Herald said, \"The Georgia Minstrels have burst upon us like an avalanche. All the reserved seats were sold last evening before the performance commenced; and the house was filled by a fashionable audience — one rarely seen at a minstrel entertainment. The troupe have made a decided hit, and their performances last night were received with great enthusiasm. Their songs and choruses are excellent; their puns, jokes, and stories, fresh and laughable; and their special acts new, and of a superior order. The performances of the troupe have happily filled a void which existed in the amusement field.\" The Folio, a musical, journal of Boston, said, \"As for the whole evening's enjoyment, it may be characterized as novel from the fact that it is native and not imitative, commendable because it is wholly refined, and most pleasant because it is always artistic.\"\n\nBefore the twilight of minstrelsy, the largest Negro company ever known was organized under the name of Callender's Consolidated Spectacular Colored Minstrels, Gustavo and Charles Frohman, proprietors (1882). Another well known company was that of Lew Johnson's Plantation Minstrels. Somewhat later, Lew Dockstader's Minstrels, a so-called two-part show, one half white, the other half black, were hailed as the best minstrels of the day. In the Primrose and West Minstrels, 1883, Billy Windom who was a Negro tenor, wrote his own songs, among which was the popular ballad, \"She may have seen better days.\" This troupe was called \"The Forty Whites and Thirty Blacks.\"\n\nAt this time popular songs and writers also had their day. The \"Jim Crow\" Song of Negro minstrelsy days, held the stage between 1815 and 1857, but rumors of its coming were heralded by Negro melodies from Missouri as early as 1810 and 1812. Henry E. Krehbiel mentions a descriptive song of the battle of Plattsburg which he heard sung in Negro dialect in 1815. A song which was printed in the Negro Singer's Own Book, 1846, is a Canoe Song typical of the racial songs of canoe and river.\n\n\"I got up in the mornin' 'bout brake of day,\n\nI went to de ribber, my canoe gone away,\n\nWhen I got to de ribber radder wide\n\nI look ober yonder, my canoe on toder side.\"\n\nIt would be difficult, however, to declare that either of these two songs are originally Negro ones. The first was incorporated into a drama while the second is akin to the type of true Negro song that was parodied by white impersonators on the minstrel stage.\n\nThe first Negro writer of popular ballads was Samuel Lucas Milady, born August 7, 1848. He wrote \"Grandfather's Clock is too tall for the Shelf.\" When he featured this song in 1878, the Milwaukee Sentinel said, \"His rendition of 'Grandfather's Clock,' with distant chorus and refrain, was the sweetest music we ever listened to. The audience was breathless; the lowest whisper could be heard distinctly all over the house. . . . As an actor he takes high rank.\" Lucas died January 10, 1916. One of the Frohmans, who attended the funeral, gave the eulogy. A talented daughter, Marie Lucas, orchestra director, survives him.\n\n\"Grandfather's Clock\" was published by C. M. Cady of New York as the \"most popular song in America,\" with words and music credited to Henry Clay Work, a Connecticut white man. However, from the time the song became known — in 1876 — it was spoken of as Sam Lucas' song. A relative of the comedian's, Bishop Reverdy C. Ransom of the A. M. E. Church, says that Lucas claimed that Work heard the song, liked it, and bought it from him. He afterwards published it naming himself as author and composer.\n\nAs sung by the comedian, it brought the demand of an order of 10,000 copies by Oliver Ditson & Co., from the publisher Cady. A correspondent addressing the Boston Evening Transcript a few years ago said, \"The song used to be sung by the late Sam Lucas, colored vocalist and actor. He always referred to it as being his own composition. He was always fashionably attired, courteous always, and was in frequent demand when a 'colored aggregation of talent' was given at any of the local theaters. His characterization of Uncle Tom in 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' was considered his best effort.\"\n\nThe song has been reprinted in various collections such as \"Songs the Whole World Sings,\" \"More Heart Throbs,\" and in \"Songs of the Rotary Club.\"\n\nGRANDFATHER'S CLOCK\n\nMy grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf,\n\nSo it stood ninety years on the floor;\n\nIt was taller by half than the old man himself,\n\nThough it weighed not a pennyweight more.\n\nIt was bought on the morn of the day he was born,\n\nAnd was always his treasure and pride;\n\nBut it stopped short — never to go again —\n\nWhen the old man died. Chorus: Ninety years, without slumbering — tick, tick, tick, tick,\n\nHis life-seconds numbering — tick, tick, tick, tick,\n\nIt stopped short — never to go again — When the old man died. In watching its pendulum swinging to and fro,\n\nMany hours had he spent while a boy;\n\nAnd in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know\n\nAnd to share both his grief and his joy;\n\nFor it struck twenty-four when he entered the door,\n\nWith a blooming and beautiful bride:\n\nBut it stopped short — never to go again —\n\nWhen the old man died. My grandfather said that of those he could hire\n\nNot a servant so faithful he found,\n\nFor it wasted no time and had but one desire —\n\nAt the close of each week to be wound.\n\nIt was kept in its place — not a frown on its face,\n\nAnd its hands never hung by its side;\n\nBut it stopped short — never to go again —\n\nWhen the old man died. It rang an alarm in the dead of the night —\n\nAn alarm that for years had been dumb —\n\nAnd we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight —\n\nThat his hour of departure had come.\n\nStill the clock kept time, with a soft muffled chime,\n\nAs we silently stood by his side:\n\nBut it stopped short — never to go again —\n\nWhen the old man died.\n\nThe guitar was the favorite instrument used to accompany these old songs. The famous old Mocking Bird song was first published with guitar accompaniment. It evidently appeared before 1854. The lithographed cover of another old song reads —\n\n\"What is Home Without a Mother,\" dedicated to Ann Eliza P. Shuster, by Alice Hawthorne, guitar, piano, and voice, 1854, entered by Winner and Shuster.\" The cover page gives a list of twenty songs by Alice Hawthorne, author of \"My Cottage Home,\" \"Song of the Farmer,\" \"Our Good Old Friends,\" (et cetera) and \"Listen to the Mocking Bird.\" We learn from this publication that Winner did not at first lay claim to the authorship of the Mocking Bird song, but releases it under the authorship of \"Alice Hawthorne,\" who may have written verses to other songs credited to her son. The Mocking Bird song, with its whistling refrain, for long one of the favorites of the minstrel singers, was a Negro extemporization. An early copy can be seen in the Schomburg collection in the Negro Division of the 135th Street Public Library, New York City.\n\nAmong the first singing-comedians whose tunes became well-known, was Richard (George) Milburn, a barber in Philadelphia. He wrote \"Listen to the Mocking-Bird.\" He spent his leisure in imitating the song of birds and playing the guitar, and was engaged by the Philadelphia Library Company, a Negro literary organization connected with St. Thomas' Episcopal Church, to give exhibitions of his skill. Septimus Winner, a skilled white musician, induced Milburn to whistle to him bird tunes which he wrote down. Milburn, who was also an expert guitarist, is said to have sold his tune, the mocking-bird song, for $5.00, while the publishers realized $100,000 on its sale. In 1855, the song was published with the frontispiece, \"Music by Richard Milburn, Words by Alice Hawthorne. Publisher, Septimus Winner.\" Lee and Walker became later publishers, and the final credit was given to Winner as the creator of the melody. Alice Hawthorne was the mother of Winner.\n\nOther song writers known in Philadelphia wrote a sentimental type of song, well-liked in that day. In 1829, James Hemenway contributed to \"Atkinson's Casket\" in Philadelphia, and published \"That Rest so Sweet like Bliss Above,\" \"The Philadelphia Entree March,\" and \"Hunter and Hope Waltzes.\" In 1859, A. J. R. Connor's \"My Cherished Hope, My Fondest Dreams\" was published in the February number of The Anglo-African Magazine, a literary publication edited by Thomas Hamilton, a Negro, and printed by the same at 48 Beekman Street, New York. From 1846 to 1857, Connor composed a number of pieces among which were \"American Polka Quadrilles\" and \"New York Polka Waltz,\" published by music houses of Philadelphia and New York.\n\nGussie L. Davis of Cincinnati, Ohio, was a well-known writer of ballads many of which were in the favorite waltz rhythm. The best known of his many songs were \"Do the Old Folks Miss Me,\" \"My Creole Sue,\" \"The Light House by the Sea,\" and \"When Nelly Was Raking the Hay.\" The last-named, dedicated to the tenor, Wallace King,5 was published in 1884.\n\nOne of the most popular songs written about 1875 was James Bland's \"Carry Me Back to Ole Virginny.\" The thousands of Virginians and others who are delighted by this song today ignore the fact that it emerged from the mind of a black man.\n\nOne of the principal instruments used by the minstrels was the banjo said to have1 been derived from the African \"bania.\" A noted banjoist of the period known as the \"80's,\" was Horace Weston, formerly a slave who was said to have \"stroked\" the strings instead of picking them and who also used a thimble. The white banjoist, Edward C. Dobson, studied Weston's methods and became one of the finest players of his day. These popular ballads together with slave songs, doggerel rhymes, and amusing Negro impersonations may have had but little value as a medium in the development of Negro music in the United States, but they were a type, nationally liked in their time and, in certain of their manifestations, have lived in the rollicking college songs of today.\n\nFor some years the melodic line of Negro song had its appeal. In 1845, Stephen Foster entered a competition for a prize offered by a minstrel company for the best Negro song. \"Way Down South\" was written and liked, but it did not receive the prize. It was followed by \"Louisiana Bell\" and \"O Susannah,\" after which came songs by which he will be long remembered — \"My Old Kentucky Home,\" \"The Old Folks at Home,\" and \"Old Black Joe.\" The latter was written in I860, and in the first edition, it is described as \"An Ethiopian Melody.\" Stephen Foster's interest in Negro music dates from the time when as a little lad, he was taken by his mother's maid to a Negro church. Hearing the religious melodies sung, he received a lasting impression.\n\nRussell Hanby, another song writer, thus attained fame. The year 1933 marked the centenary anniversary of this writer of \"Darling Nellie Gray,\" one of the well remembered \"heart songs\" of long ago, recently incorporated in a modern composition of old plantation days. The words written as a blackboard singing exercise were first sung by the pupils of the writer at the district school where he taught at Rushville, Ohio. Hanby was born in that town, on July 22, 1833, the son of a minister. He played as a boy in the old yard adjoining the local church which was also used as a school, and he and his playmate Hyde, became interested in a particular grave — that of a runaway slave. A Negro, Joe Selby, who had succeeded in making his escape from Kentucky to Rushville, related, it was said, the story of his disappointed love to a group of sympathetic abolitionists who were gathered at his death-bed.\n\nThis slave loved a young girl named Nellie Gray who belonged to a neighboring plantation. After his escape he had striven to earn enough to purchase her freedom, but before he could do so her owner, involved in debt, sold Nellie to a richer plantation farther south. The sad story affected Hanby, who wrote the poem which he long afterwards had copyrighted and then sold for $25. An only living pupil, Mrs. T. M. Adams, learned the song from the composer, and her brother, George E. Kalb, of Rushville, has told the story of Nellie Gray to the American public.\n\n\"There's a low green valley on the old Kentucky shore,\n\nWhere I've whiled many happy hours away,\n\nA-sitting and a-singing by the little cottage door,\n\nWhere lived my poor Nellie Gray.\"\n\nThe melody of \"Way Down upon the Suwanee River\" is said to have been one of pathetic homesickness sung by a woman slave who was sold from the Suwanee River district in North Central Florida, to Alabama. The song, which had echoed up the Ohio River, appealed strongly to Stephen Foster who, taking a voyage down the Tennessee River to Florence, Alabama, found the original singer and wrote down the song for publication. The melody is the same as \"Way Down upon the Mobile River.\"\n\nThe enslaved or newly-freed continued to sing the extemporaneous melodies which for centuries had brought them comfort and solace. The first authentic picture of the use of the slave songs, the manner in which they were sung and their meaning, come to us from the great Negro statesman, Frederick Douglass, in his autobiography,6 as they were heard on the Lloyd plantation in Talbot County, Maryland, during his childhood; this must have been about 1827. Douglass wrote:\n\n\"I did not, when a slave, fully understand the deep meaning of those rude and apparently incoherent songs. I was, myself, within the circle, so that I could then neither hear nor see as those without might see and hear. They breathed the prayer and complaint of souls over-flowing with the bitterest anguish . . . The remark in the olden time was not unfrequently made, that slaves were the most contented and happy laborers in the world, and their dancing and singing were referred to in proof of this alleged fact; but it was a great mistake to suppose them happ"
