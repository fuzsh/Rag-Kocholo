On March 31, while visiting a second time, he receives a legal judgment against him from Paris. He will stay away from Paris for four years. He visits Marseilles June 1, gets involved in several schools, start a novitiate, try to go to Rome (unsuccessfully), encounter Jansenist opposition, and ultimately feel as if heâ€™s failed in his endeavors there."
