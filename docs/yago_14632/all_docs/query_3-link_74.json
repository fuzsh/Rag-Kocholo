Corrections welcome supported by evidence. Thanks for your help. Dimensions given, if any, are approximate. Scans large to show any defects. Unseen defects described. VG or better condition. Item complete as issued unless otherwise stated.\n\nCollection of 19 vintage black-and-white photographs of actress Daniel Rocca, seen here at the 15th Cannes Film Festival in 1962, as well as some candid risque shots of Rocca in bed., and two negative contact sheets. Several photos credited to Catherine Redmond-Hesse, with her rubber stamp on the versos, and others with the Dalmas press agency rubber stamp on the versos. Included is a handwritten letter from a representative of the Dalmas agency, on their stationery, thanks Rocca for her recent order, dated 1962. Rocca (1937-1995) began modeling in the early 1950s, winning Miss Catania in 1953s, and eventually was discovered while she competed in the Miss Italy pageant. Her film debut came in Maurice Cloche's \"Marchands de Filles\" (1957), and notable credits include \"Caltiki - The Immortal Monster\" (1959), \"Austerlitz\" (1960), \"Divorce, Italian Style\" (1961, opposite Marcello Mastroianni), and \"The Captive City\" (1962). After some success in the 1960s, Rocca's career went south, and mental illness plagued her until death, having since retired to an assisted living home where she wrote books of poetry and fiction. Imagery from early Cannes Festivals is uncommon, making this substantial collection of Rocca photos all the more desirable. Four photos 5 x 7 inches, seven photos 7 x 9.5 inches, six photos 8 x 10.5 inches, contact sheets 8 x 10 inches, with some slightly larger or smaller overall. All slightly curling, else Near Fine."
