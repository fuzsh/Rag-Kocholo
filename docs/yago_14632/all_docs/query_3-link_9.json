        "text": "A remarkably vivid picture of an humble and truly righteous man rather than a bona fide drama or a comprehension of a state of affairs is imparted by \"Monsieur Vincent,\" a French biographical film about Vincent de Paul, the great reformer, which opened simultaneously at the Avenue and Fifty-fifth Street Playhouses yesterday.Credit this virture of the picture to a fine performance by Pierre Fresnay, who fills the role of the sevententh-century cleric with spirit and godliness. From the moment that Mr. Fresnay presents himself as the new young priest to take over the long-neglected parish of plague-ridden Chatillon, he etches this bold humanitarian with deep and passionate strokes, revealing a man of sensitive nature and boundless energy and aim to do good.And in subsequent scenes and situations involving this charitable priest with the poor, the sick and the wretched to whom he devoted his long and active life, Mr. Fresnay makes clear and affecting his strong reactions to misery and woe.As basis for these reactions, the producers have put into the film some poignant and shocking demonstrations of inhumanity in seventeenth-century France. The opening episode describing the fright and cruelty of people confronted by the plague establishes sharply and fairly the sort of prejudice the priest had to combat. Later episodes portraying the pestilent conditions in the priest's own hospice of St. Lazare or the brutal bias against foundling children are properly horrifying, too.Most vivid and singularly dramatic is one isolated scene in which the priest, moving into a Paris tenement, listens to the sounds of his poor neighbors in the night while the degradation of poverty is described to him by a consumptive with whom he shares his room. This one scene is a memorable achievement—a rare bit of brilliant cinema—distinguished by the eloquent dialogue of Jean Anouilh and the sensitive direction of Maurice Cloche.But, unfortunately, these individual episodes are not effectively combined to do more than give a general impression of wretchedness in seventeenth-century France. And the painful disorder of the story, either by origin or from cutting on this side, despoil it of dramatic compulsion—or even of coherence at times. The career of de Paul is made indefinite, and characters appear and disappear in provoking multiplicity and confusion. The consequent vagueness is evidenced by the fact that we cannot intelligently comment on any other performers in the large cast.For all that, Mr. Fresnay does give us a haunting image of a passionately good man. And that is something worth having—even though it doesn't mesh with anything.\n\nMONSIEUR VINCENT, scenario by Jean Bernard-Luc and Jean Anouilh; dialogue by Mr. Anouilh; directed by Maurice Cloche; produced by E. D. I. C.-U. G. C. of Paris, and released here by Lopert Films, Inc. At the Avenue and 55th Street Playhouses.Vincent de Paul . . . . . Pierre FresnayCardinal Richelieu . . . . .
