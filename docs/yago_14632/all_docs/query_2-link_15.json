        "text": "Ahoy! This here is the 22nd Featured Article.\n\n\"Monkey D. Garp\" has been featured, meaning it was chosen as an article of interest.\n\nMonkey D. Garp,[13] also known as \"Garp the Fist\",[7] is an extremely famous and powerful Marine Vice Admiral. He is the father of Monkey D. Dragon,[14] the paternal grandfather of Monkey D. Luffy,[15] and the adoptive grandfather of Portgas D. Ace. He was responsible for overseeing Ace's birth and raising a young Luffy, before entrusting them both to the Dadan Family.\n\nGarp is a major figure, along with Kong, Sengoku, Shiki, Silvers Rayleigh, Tsuru, and Whitebeard, from the times when Gol D. Roger, the \"Pirate King\", was still alive. His feats as a Marine soldier gained him immense notoriety and prestige, with his actions during the God Valley Incident in particular bestowing him the title of \"Hero of the Marines\". Notably, Garp was offered the rank of Admiral several times throughout his career, but he refused the offer of promotion every time due to his deep hatred and contempt for World Nobles. He is also the former mentor of Kuzan.[16]\n\nGarp was first introduced during the Diary of Koby-Meppo Cover Page Serial, where he took charge of both Koby and Helmeppo's training after its events. After the war and Ace's death, he became a Marine Instructor to train new recruits, though still retaining the rank of Vice Admiral,[5] which is not known to the public and it appears as if he has retired.[17] During his mission to rescue Koby from the Blackbeard Pirates, Garp was badly injured and forced to remain behind, and as a result, he has been declared \"missing in action\".[18]\n\nDue to his actions, he could be considered the main antagonist of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc. He is also a supporting antagonist in the Marineford Arc.\n\nQuick Answers\n\nWhat is the significance of Garp's nickname 'Garp the Fist'?\n\nGarp's nickname 'Garp the Fist' is a testament to his immense physical strength and fighting prowess. He is known for his devastating punch attacks, one of which is the 'Galaxy Impact' that can create massive explosions and even destroy an entire island. Garp earned this epithet after defeating formidable opponents like Don Chinjao, who was known to split a continent with a headbutt, with just a single punch. Even at an advanced age, Garp's power remains undiminished, striking fear into the hearts of pirates and earning him the respect of his peers in the One Piece universe.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nHow did Monkey D. Garp become a Vice Admiral in One Piece?\n\nMonkey D. Garp, also known as 'Garp the Fist', joined the Marines at the age of 22 and over the years, he rose up through the ranks due to his exceptional strength and heroism. His journey to becoming a Vice Admiral is marked by numerous battles and victories. Despite his descendants Dragon and Luffy being among the world's most infamous figures, Garp's dedication to justice and his 'galaxy impact' in the Marine forces earned him the respect and rank of Vice Admiral.\n\nProvided by: Community\n\nWhat is the relationship between Garp and Monkey D. Luffy?\n\nMonkey D. Garp is the grandfather of Monkey D. Luffy. As a vice admiral and a hero of the Marines, Garp had high hopes for his grandson and wanted him to follow in his footsteps. However, Luffy chose the path of piracy, much to Garp's disappointment. Despite this, Garp cares deeply for Luffy and often finds himself torn between his duty as a Marine and his love for his grandson.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWho did Garp entrust the upbringing of Ace and Luffy to?\n\nMonkey D. Garp, the renowned Vice Admiral, entrusted the upbringing of Ace and Luffy to a close friend of his, the mountain bandit Curly Dadan. Despite his tough love and high expectations for them to become strong Marines, both boys had their hearts set on the pirate life. Garp's unique training methods, which included leaving Luffy in a jungle in the middle of the night, were all part of his plan to make them strong and resilient. However, their paths diverged from Garp's vision, much to his chagrin.\n\nProvided by: Community\n\nAppearance\n\nGarp is a tall, tanned, broad-chested, muscular old man. He has a beard and a scar over his left eye. In the anime, his eye color is blue, and his hair is gray, whereas in the manga, it is white. Garp and Tsuru are the only two Vice Admirals to have special shoulder-pads; Garp is golden and blue (black and red in the anime) while Tsuru is purple with white dot whereas the standard color is blue and red. During the Battle of Edd War, Garp's had two black stripes on his epaulettes, and during his appearance at Water 7, it increased to three stripes and by the time of the Marineford War, it increased again to four stripes.\n\nThe dog mask that Garp initially wore when introduced served to hide his identity as Luffy's grandfather, whose design had appeared in Romance Dawn, Version 2. After their relationship was revealed in the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Garp is no longer seen wearing the mask.\n\nIn his free time or vacation, Garp often wears sandals, a red tropical shirt and light-colored shorts. He sometimes pairs this shirt with black trousers and boots.[19] When visiting Dadan during Luffy's childhood, he sometimes wears his official black suit without wearing his Marine cape.\n\nThirty-eight years ago, Garp's hair was all black and lacked a goatee. He wore a white dress shirt and a red tie.\n\nThirty years ago, Garp's hair and goatee were all black. He wore a dark suit with an orange striped undershirt and a black tie.\n\nTwenty-four years ago, Garp's hair and goatee were still black, with sideburns beginning to whiten. He wore a dark double-breasted suit with a white shirt and a red necktie.[20]\n\nWhen he was a child and a young man, Garp resembled Luffy, though more muscular than his grandson. As a child, he had light brown hair, wore a tropical button shirt with shorts, and wielded a pipe staff. Garp already had the scar on his left eye in his childhood days.\n\nAfter the timeskip, his appearance has somewhat remained the same though he now wears a dark-colored suit (still white in the anime).\n\nGallery\n\nMain\n\nVideo Games\n\nLive-action series\n\nOther\n\nPersonality\n\n“ Don't be tied down by this nonsense!! I taught you to live in the moment!!!! Listen up, Kuzan!! Wavering is a sign of weakness!!!! ”\n\n— Garp to Kuzan\n\nGarp is an eccentric but righteous and caring man, who is loyal to both his criminal family and the Marine Headquarters, who he has served for decades. He is loud, boisterous, exuberant, and overall acts in a similar manner to his grandson, however he can be very serious if the situation requires it, for example in combat against an enemy (this can be seen when he faced the pirate Shiki alongside Sengoku, and also more recently when he had to fight against Aokiji, his former pupil). He has a habit of falling asleep during conversations and can be absent-minded. Luffy's crew noted his apparently hereditary selfishness during Garp's interaction with Luffy in Water 7.\n\nDespite being a righteous man, Garp takes great pride in being a Marine despite knowing how corrupt the Marines are under the World Government, and wanted his family to follow his footsteps, as his son Dragon previously joined the Marines but left due to being disgusted by their corruption and hypocrisy, he also harshly trained his grandsons in order to make them splendid Marines and would beat them up whenever they defied his wishes by wanting to be pirates.\n\nGarp is aware of the World Government's immense corruption and tyrannical influence over the world and society, particularly of the Celestial Dragons' cruelty and oppression of civilians but held a lenient and laid-back stance on it, believing as long as there is no open bloodshed, even if there are social discrimination and political corruption, he can call it peace, contrary to his son's rebellious stance against political corruption.\n\nUnlike many Marines, Garp does not believe that a person's lineage determines their path. On a similar note, he does not believe that being labeled a criminal necessarily makes someone a bad person. Although Garp wanted his grandsons to become marines, he entrusted their care to a mountain bandit whom he had refused to turn over for prosecution.\n\nGarp believes that throwing children into harsh conditions will ultimately make them strong and has no problem striking children to drive home a point. His grandson, Luffy, for example, stated that Garp almost killed him several times when he was a child under the guise of making him strong. Despite this, Garp is a supportive person. When Ace asked Garp whether he should have been born, Garp replies that Ace will find the answer if he continues living. When Momousagi mentioned Luffy being targeted by two Emperors, Garp did not express much concern about it.\n\nHis harsh discipline extends to himself as he forced himself through an extremely harsh and unorthodox training method of punching battleships since his youth.\n\nAlthough Garp will ultimately comply with Marine HQ's most serious orders, he highly values his freedom and family. Often to a point where he bends the rules to accommodate these values. He initially refused to capture Luffy in Water 7 until explicitly ordered to do so. Despite fulfilling his duties, Garp has a strong Moral Code to follow, which according to Sengoku is the main reason why Garp refused the promotion as an Admiral multiple times, as his code dictates that it is not his duty to protect Celestial Dragons. Additionally, Garp is generally amused by Luffy's exploits as a pirate, and only seriously laments both of his grandsons' choices to become pirates after Ace is captured. He ultimately allowed Luffy to hit him due to valuing his family more than his duty as a Marine during the war at Marineford. He even seemed ready to defend them when Akainu executed Ace and was on the verge of killing Luffy.\n\nLike Luffy, Garp is extremely blunt and honest when talking to people as seen when he openly badmouthed Sterry, the current king of the Goa Kingdom, unafraid of the consequences. He considers the Celestial Dragons scumbags and is not afraid of expressing this vocally. The main reason he refused to become an admiral is because he does not want to be their direct subordinate. On one occasion, he also blurted out Monkey D. Dragon's name in front of Luffy, his friends, and his subordinates without any consideration at Water 7. When he realized he should not have said that he just simply laughed it off, and shamelessly asked those who heard it to forget it.[21]\n\nGarp believes in the potential of youth and sees it as a Marine's duty to protect the future. This is the first lesson he teaches to Marine recruits, even telling them in a situation where they have to choose between saving an old man and a baby; they should leave the old man behind on the dangerous island and save the baby because the old man doesn't have much time left while the baby and them have a whole future ahead of them. While his fellow Marine instructor told him never to repeat this lesson, Garp stood by it. He would display his commitment to this by launching a rescue mission to save Koby after he was taken to Hachinosu by Blackbeard, declaring Koby the future of the Marines. At the end of the raid, he showed his faith in Koby, Prince Grus and Helmeppo by entrusting them to save the Marine ship from Avalo Pizarro's attack while he stayed behind to allow to them to escape, calling all of them the \"future of the Marines\".[18]\n\nWhen Garp prepares to fight seriously, he often removes his Marine coat[22] or a suit jacket.[23] Like his grandson, Garp is extremely fond of food, especially donuts, rice crackers and meat.\n\nGarp has his own laughter style: Bwahaha or Wahaha.\n\nRelationships\n\nMarines\n\nAs the \"Hero of the Marines\", Garp is overall very well-respected for cornering the Pirate King multiple times. While Garp seems devoted to his duties, he has his own sense of justice and does not always obey orders which are given to him. Both Garp's immense popularity and achievements are noted by Sengoku to be the reason Garp was never disposed of for his rebellious attitude. He was requested to remain behind as an instructor due to his fame, which will be invaluable in recruiting, Garp has problems with respecting his superiors and such is the case with then-Fleet Admiral Kong 27 years ago, and former Fleet Admiral Sengoku. Even including the fact that Garp was about to try to kill Akainu for killing Ace, it seems that this has not affected Garp's standing in the Marines even after his relationship with both Dragon and Luffy was revealed to the world, as Kong insisted that Garp's title and records can be utilized to recruit new Marines.\n\nCrew\n\nGarp's crew often reacts with shock or uncertainty to his behavior. At times he seems to be unaware of the true extent of what is going on around him. After ordering his crew to rebuild a wall that Garp himself had just destroyed, his crew refused to do so unless he helped as well. This insubordinate behavior was displayed amongst a Marine crew, but Garp complied with their demand. Despite Garp telling his crew about his relationship with Luffy and Dragon, most Marines were unaware of it until the war with Whitebeard, suggesting that his men kept it a secret.\n\nGarp's right hand man is a Marine of unknown rank, who is usually seen with him. In the anime, his name is Bogard, although his name has not been revealed in the manga as of yet. It seems that Garp and Bogard have been together for at least 38 years.\n\nKoby and Helmeppo\n\nAdditionally, Garp is the mentor of Koby and Helmeppo, who both came to admire him. He was shocked when Koby shouted out to stop the killing at Marineford during the war with Whitebeard.\n\nWhen Koby was captured by the Blackbeard Pirates after his failed attempt to arrest Boa Hancock, he plans on going to rescue him, disregarding protocol. Garp acknowledged Koby to be his beloved pupil. Due to knowing Koby's relentless determination and effort during the early days of his training, Garp had high expectations for Koby calling him the future of the Marines. Upon seeing Koby awaken his potential by destroying Pizzaro's giant Island hand, Garp wholeheartedly laughed, content to witness his beloved pupil's growth.\n\nSengoku\n\nAs a hero of the Marines, Garp commands high respect among the Marines, even from then-Fleet Admiral Sengoku. In the past, Garp and Sengoku seemed to be very good friends, albeit that Sengoku was a little annoyed with Garp's tendency to act of his own accord whenever Roger was involved. Currently, as with the revelation that both Monkey D. Luffy and Portgas D. Ace are Garp's grandsons (Ace being adopted), as well as Luffy's multiple actions in such a short time, Sengoku has begun losing patience with Garp. But the two Marines still share a close friendship even though Sengoku is often exasperated at Garp's antics, like his offering of tea to Sengoku and Kuma while discussing Luffy's actions at Thriller Bark.\n\nGarp, on the other hand, seems to merely laugh it off and enjoys getting on Sengoku's nerves. Notably, Sengoku's biggest annoyance was Garp's refusal to keep his family under control even when threatened with the consequences. Garp simply does not believe the life of an old man could ever atone for the actions of his family. When or how long Sengoku knew of Garp adopting Ace is unknown, but Sengoku found out that Ace is the son of Gol D. Roger. Also, how long Sengoku knew about Luffy and Dragon's familial relationship to Garp is unknown, but Sengoku had no problem revealing all of it worldwide.\n\nWhen Garp allowed Luffy to land a punch on him to save Ace, many of the surrounding Marines were shocked to see what they believe to be an impossibility: the legendary Garp was easily defeated by a rookie. Sengoku, however, was able to tell of Garp's hesitancy, and was displeased that he chose family over duty.\n\nAfter the Summit War of Marineford, Garp and Sengoku retired but their records remained untouched.\n\nTsuru\n\nGarp is well acquainted with Tsuru having known her for a long time. Before the Summit War of Marineford occurred, she told him that he had done nothing wrong regarding Ace, which Garp replied to with laughter, saying that she was supposed to be sympathetic towards him during this situation.\n\nSakazuki\n\nSakazuki did not show any respect to Garp despite the old Vice Admiral being a \"Hero of the Marines\" who was eligible for the position of admiral due to him being from the previous generation, but mostly for sharing the same lineage with criminals like Dragon and Luffy.​​ Garp in turn also has no respect for Sakazuki even though he is now the fleet admiral, nor does he consider it. He claimed to Sengoku that he would have mercilessly killed Sakazuki for executing Ace if he was not restrained by the former.\n\nWorld Government\n\nKong\n\nGarp and Kong are well acquainted with each other, due to the latter being the former Fleet Admiral years ago. Kong respects Garp's abilities, as he always insisted that Garp accept the promotion to Admiral, but Garp constantly declined. They remain acquainted even after Kong became the Commander-in-Chief for the World Government. After the Marineford War, Kong reassigned Garp to the rank of Marine Instructor after he succeeded in persuading Garp to stay in the Marines and train new recruits.\n\nWorld Nobles\n\nThough he is a Marine and is loyal to the World Government, Garp is disgusted by the World Nobles and refused the promotion to admiral due to the fact it would make him their direct subordinate.[24] He has no hesitancy in degrading the Celestial Dragons in front of others of importance, such as King Sterry, only halfheartedly taking back the insult and went as far as directly calling them scumbags for their cruel and heinous natures. The only reason why the World Nobles did not dispose of him for his rebellious personality was due to his popularity and merits.\n\nFamily\n\nMonkey D. Dragon\n\nDragon is Garp's son.[14] No direct interactions between the two have been shown. In the past, he expressed discontent about his own son leaving the Marines and becoming a Revolutionary,[25][26] though over the years he seems much more casual about his son's path as a Revolutionary who is wanted by the World Government. There appears to be some sort of understanding between the two, as Garp was aware that the reason Dragon was in Loguetown was to see Luffy set off for the Grand Line.[27] After the Summit War of Marineford, he was not fazed by the fact that his relationship with Dragon became public knowledge. It also seems his reputation as a hero hasn’t been tarnished by this revelation.\n\nGarp and Dragon have different assessments of the East Blue. While Garp perceives it as a rather peaceful place, Dragon expresses his disgust with Garp's view of \"peace\" as nothing more than a form of oppression authorized by the law in places, such as Tequila Wolf and the Goa Kingdom, where common people live in horrible conditions.\n\nUltimately, Garp has an extremely different ideology from his son. While Garp takes pride and contentment in being a Marine serving the World Government, Dragon absolutely despises the World Government to the point of becoming a Revolutionary and seeking to overthrow them. However, they are unified in one belief – disdain toward the Celestial Dragons.\n\nMonkey D. Luffy\n\nGarp raised his grandson Luffy and sets high standards for him,[15] and gets mad at the slightest mistake he makes, even when his own are sometimes no better (i.e., telling off Luffy for falling asleep only to fall asleep himself). This often leads Luffy to receiving the force of Garp's punches, and due to these experiences, he has become afraid of his grandfather. Garp also claims Luffy was poisoned by Shanks with ideas of becoming a pirate, as Garp wanted Luffy to be a great Marine like him. Luffy, however, claims otherwise and told Garp that even as a child he wanted to be a pirate.[28] Nevertheless, the two get along quite well. As Nami stated at the time of Garp's departure, that there seems to be an amazing ego that runs in Garp's family. Garp left Luffy in Dadan's care as a child, which is how Luffy met Ace.\n\nGarp appears proud when Luffy commits outrageous acts and found it amusing when he learned that Luffy had infiltrated the great prison Impel Down in an attempt to rescue Ace. When he learned that Luffy had broken out of Impel Down (taking many infamous prisoners along with him) and headed straight to Marineford, where the marines were currently waging war against Whitebeard and his crew, Garp was shocked. He was even more shocked when Luffy, along with an entire battleship of prisoners, fell off a frozen tsunami and into the war front.\n\nThis shows that he cares for his grandson's well-being. He later calmed himself as the battle went on and simply watched as Luffy fought the marines, throughout which he seemed distraught whenever Luffy was struck down by various powerful soldiers. When Sengoku made Luffy's relationship to Dragon public, Garp simply states that Luffy already has such widespread notoriety that his connection to Dragon is irrelevant. Garp expressed surprise at Luffy's ability to use Haoshokou Haki before commenting that Luffy inherited it after all. When Luffy was on the verge of saving Ace, Garp blocked him and refused to move, citing his Marine duties. Despite this, Garp allowed Luffy to hit him without fighting back.\n\nAfter the timeskip, Garp does not seem to be troubled by his grandson's growing infamy. This was demonstrated when he was not the least bit concerned that two of the Four Emperors are after him, even laughing at the idea of the emperors actually teaming up over something.[29]\n\nPortgas D. Ace\n\nGarp adopted Ace from Gol D. Roger, who requested him to take care of his son while adding that Ace does not deserve to be treated as a criminal just because of his family ties. While Garp initially thought of adopting Ace as a preposterous idea, he eventually agreed to Roger's final wish, as the latter pointed out that after multiple confrontations, he trusted the vice admiral as much as a friend. Indeed, Garp was troubled when Ace was about to face death and claimed he had no pity for a pirate, but believed family is different. He cares about him deeply, crying for his grandson as he was about to be executed for being a pirate and desperately asking why he could not have just been a Marine. In fact, after Akainu killed Ace, Garp was more than willing to kill him in revenge, and the only reason he didn't follow through was because he was restrained by Sengoku.\n\nWhen Ace was an infant, Garp would use his vacation time to visit the village often and make funny faces to cheer him up. Despite the fact that Ace was a troubled child that would beat up anyone who insulted his father, Garp seemed amused with Ace, yet never scolded him for his actions as a part of him felt sad that the child did not fully accept Roger as his father. After Luffy, Sabo and Ace had gotten along well, Garp would sometimes visit them and train them by beating them up and destroying most of the forest in the process.\n\nAs with Luffy, Garp had high expectations for Ace to be a strong Marine but is disappointed that he chose the life of piracy, which incidentally sent him to Impel Down where they were speaking about the issue. Ace refused to acknowledge the idea that he and his younger brother could have ever been Marines, considering their fathers' restless blood in their veins.\n\nEnemies\n\nGol D. Roger\n\nBack when Gol D. Roger was alive, Garp managed to corner him numerous times.[30] As such, they have a long history against each other with the exception to the Rocks Pirates. Garp was one of two Marines that Roger considered to be worth his time, the other being Sengoku.[31] Due to their countless clashes, Roger came to see Garp as much a friend as the rest of his crew.[32] Garp too had respect for him, as he not only protected Ace but also showed signs of disappointment from Ace's decision to disregard Roger being his father. Garp also acknowledged Roger's strength, stating that although Roger was extremely reckless, this is what made him become the King of the Pirates. Garp also told Dadan that although he is a Marine, he could never come to hate Roger.\n\nWhen Roger was about to be executed after turning himself in due to his terminal illness, he made a final request to Garp. He asked Garp to take care of his unborn child, as he did not deserve to be condemned as a criminal because of his father's crimes, something they both agreed on.[32] While Garp had initially wanted to make Ace into a Marine rather than a pirate like Roger, he still wanted Ace to be proud of his biological father. Though in the end, Garp had no success in this endeavor either.\n\nEdward Newgate\n\nWhitebeard respected Garp and acknowledged his strength when he addressed him by his own real name, and not \"brat\" unlike Crocodile, Akainu, Aokiji, Kizaru, Shanks, and many others (though Garp was more in the same age group as Whitebeard, being 4 years older than him). Garp did not let Marco pass through to get to Ace's execution platform meaning he did not care how fearsome Whitebeard could be after seeing that, which is due to not only having fought Whitebeard's rival the Pirate King but also Whitebeard himself during the God Valley Incident.\n\nWhile the two are on opposite sides, Garp shares similar views with Whitebeard. They don't believe a child should be condemned or hated because of what their parents did, nor would they hate someone simply because they were enemies with their parents. They also believe it's their duty to raise and protect the next generation.\n\nChinjao\n\nChinjao was an infamous pirate who took deep pride in his pointed head, which Garp was determined to break. Garp and Chinjao had multiple battles in the past.[33] After he trained by leveling eight mountains with his fists, Garp successfully dented Chinjao's head in a confrontation, depriving the latter of the means to access all of his stored treasures. This led to Chinjao holding a grudge so strong against Garp that it extended to all of his descendants and lasted over 30 years. Chinjao lifted his grudge and forgave Garp when the latter's grandson, Luffy, punched his head hard enough to return it to its former glory.[34] Chinjao also reveals that in Garp's younger days, he was like a \"demon\" to pirates.[9]\n\nShanks\n\nGarp bears a grudge against Shanks, because Garp believes he is the one who influenced his grandson, Monkey D. Luffy, to become a pirate.[35] When seeing him at Marineford, Garp was greatly angered by his presence and deepened his grudge against Shanks for inspiring his grandson to be a pirate.[36] Despite his resentment, Garp did not stop Shanks from giving his late grandson Ace a proper burial after he requested it.\n\nRocks D. Xebec\n\nBefore Roger's era, Rocks was his enemy. There was a conflict at God Valley that required Garp to team up with Roger in order to put an end to his reign of terror.\n\nKuzan\n\nGarp is the former mentor of Kuzan, during their time in the Marines.[37][38] Kuzan, in particular, owes a large part of his physical strength due to Garp's training and has been indebted to Garp due to a certain incident that involved Garp saving his life, and is impressed that Garp refused several promotions.\n\nWhen confronting his former student, who had since become a member of the Blackbeard Pirates, at Hachinosu, Garp demanded Kuzan to come back to the Marines, unfreeze Hibari and let them leave with Koby. However, Kuzan rejected Garp's plea and refused to return to the Marines due to his hatred towards Sakazuki, although Kuzan always loves Garp being direct as usual. They both clashed but Garp managed to easily overpower Kuzan, while scolding him for losing his way.[39] Kuzan eventually got the upper hand when his fellow Titanic Captains joined the fight while Kuzan told his underlings to stand aside as he knew they were still no match for his former mentor even in his weakened state. Kuzan then managed to pierce Garp's chest a with a massive icicle.[18] Kuzan still respects Garp even though they are now on opposite sides and had a grim expression on his face as Garp was lying on the ground as the Blackbeard Pirates surround him.\n\nOther Pirates\n\nOver his many years as a Marine hero, Garp has made many enemies with pirates over the sea, such as Shiki and Shakky.[40] He felt neither remorse nor pity for any of these pirates, as they are criminals.\n\nOthers\n\nCurly Dadan\n\nIt is unknown how they met, but they have known each other for at least 22 years, since Garp was seen entrusting a newborn Portgas D. Ace to her.\n\nAs Curly Dadan is the leader of a bandit group, Garp blackmailed her to watch over Ace and Luffy as their foster mother, in exchange that he will turn a blind eye on their criminal activities, which is said to equal the numbers of stars in the sky. Despite Dadan having a fear and irritation against the vice admiral for leaving two children in her care, Garp claims that Dadan is a friend of his. This is ironic, as Garp claimed that he has no sympathy for criminals and will arrest them with ease. Even in more recent times, Garp and Dadan continue to show a violent relationship that likewise harbors respect for each other and for the work they had in connection with both Luffy and Ace.\n\nEven though Dadan usually fears him, she did not have a problem attacking Garp for not managing to save Ace. In turn, Garp did not resist as he understood her grief.\n\nSabo\n\nLittle is known about Garp's relationship with Sabo, beyond the fact that Garp trained him along with Luffy and Ace. Sabo noted that Garp tried to keep the three brothers on a short leash, implying that he gave Sabo similar treatment to Ace and Luffy.[41] This is expanded in the anime when Luffy told Garp he, Sabo, and Ace had exchanged cups of sake. He then declared that there were three fools in need of a lesson and decided to \"train\" Sabo alongside Luffy and Ace.\n\nSterry\n\nAs the ruler of the Goa Kingdom, Sterry expected absolute obedience and respect from Garp since he is one of its citizens. However, the old Marine showed neither to the young king, not even knowing who he was and even telling him to get lost and calling him ugly. When he was told of Sterry's position, he only half-heartedly took back much of what he said. He even looked down on Sterry's desire to become a Celestial Dragon and bluntly expressed this aloud.[42]\n\nNeptune Family\n\nGarp became acquainted with Neptune's family, notably Neptune and Shirahoshi due to being Luffy's grandfather. When they parted, Garp happily waved goodbye to the mermaid princess.\n\nAbilities and Powers\n\nGarp is considered a living legend and is one of the strongest Marines of all time. In his heyday he was famous for cornering Gol D. Roger many times,[30] as he was one of the very few people capable of fighting the Pirate King.[43] In fact, Roger states that he and Garp had almost killed each other many times throughout their battles.[32] Due to his incredible power and popularity, Garp was offered the rank of Admiral several times throughout his life but refused the promotion every time.[44] This is even more impressive given the fact that most admirals are shown to have powerful (mostly Logia-type) Devil Fruit powers. As a testament to his strength, together with Roger he fought and defeated the Rocks Pirates, one of the strongest pirate crews in history that featured Roger's most formidable rival, Rocks D. Xebec; three future Emperors, Edward Newgate, Charlotte Linlin, and Kaidou; and other legendary pirates such as Shiki the Golden Lion. This tremendous feat earned Garp the title of \"Hero of the Marines\".[45] Despite his advanced age, his power and reputation are so immense that Cross Guild has given him a bounty of 3,000,000,000, the same bounty as an Admiral.[12]\n\nAs another testament to his sheer power, Garp defeated and nearly killed Don Chinjao in the past with a single punch, whose bounty was worth 542,000,000 in his prime and was said to be able to split a continent with a headbutt, this earned him the epithet, \"Garp the Fist\".[33] Chinjao himself said that during that time, all the pirates saw Garp as a \"Devil\" to them.[9]\n\nEven at the ripe age of 76, he was shown to be able to easily strike down Marco the Phoenix, Whitebeard's right hand, which was something that both Kizaru and Akainu seemed unable to do. In fact, during the War after Ace's death, Akainu would possibly have been killed by a furious Garp had Sengoku not restrained him. Whereas it took Akainu 10 days to barely defeat Aokiji, Garp was able to easily overpower the latter in moments. During the raid on Hachinosu, he battled his former student, Kuzan, and the other Titanic Captains present there—Sanjuan Wolf, Shiryu, Avalo Pizarro, and Vasco Shot—all at once, while he initially held the upper-hand he was eventually overwhelmed after being stabbed through the abdomen by Shiryu to protect Koby. Despite this he held them off long enough to cover the Marines' escape.[46]\n\nSimilarly, when it was revealed worldwide that Luffy is Garp's grandson, Luffy's fame rose based on that fact, as Demaro Black attempted to use that as one of the strong points in his impersonation of Luffy. Charlotte Linlin referenced Garp when Luffy challenged her. He has merits and influence great enough to make even the World Nobles do not dare to get rid of him despite his rebellious personality. Jaygarcia Saturn of the Five Elders remarked how Luffy's record is understandable, being Garp's grandson.\n\nIn addition, like his late rival, Gol D. Roger, Garp has never displayed any signs of being a Devil Fruit user, which makes everything he accomplish even more impressive.\n\nLeadership\n\nAs a Vice Admiral of the Marine Headquarters, Garp has command over all lower ranking soldiers, as seen when he took two of Ripper's subordinates (Koby and Helmeppo) and made them his own subordinates instead due to his higher rank.[47] Also, as a Vice Admiral, he has the potential to be called upon to be one of five Vice Admirals leading a fleet of ten battleships during a Buster Call.\n\nBeing a Marine Vice Admiral and the commanding officer of the 153rd Marine Branch, Garp possesses leadership skills and is well respected by many among the Marines, having mentored many other prominent figures in the Marines, including former Admiral Kuzan.\n\nGarp is also a great teacher, as he was able to make Koby and Helmeppo capable fighters in a short period of time, and he was also selected to be an instructor. He was also the one who trained Luffy and Ace into being strong enough to set sail on their own. After the Summit War of Marineford, Garp now trained the new recruits of young Marines. Kuzan, who was at the time as a cadet who already learned all he could from the official instructors, was able to become the powerful warrior he is today thanks to Garp's tutelage.\n\nPhysical Abilities\n\nGarp is one of the strongest Marines, whose physical strength is considered legendary, having fought many powerful pirates including the Rock Pirates and Gol D. Roger himself in his prime. At his best he had monstrous punching power at his disposal, with his epithet, \"Garp the Fist\", attesting to the immense power of his punches. He claimed to have crushed eight mountains during his training to face Chinjao. This is proven when he was able to dent Chinjao's drill head, which was powerful enough to split the immensely hard Ice Continent in two, with relative ease. In his youth and even all the way to old age, he would use retired battleships as punching bags, often doing so every day for years, without using Haki to build up punching power. As a result, he became capable of caving in the armored hulls of those ships with the strength of his fists alone.[48] It is evident Whitebeard respects Garp's strength, as he mentioned him during his talk with Shanks.\n\nEven in old age, Garp still remains powerful, being able to launch iron cannonballs like baseballs at higher velocities than if they were fired from a real cannon, break through brick walls and cannon supports with his fists and carry and throw a giant iron ball and chain many times bigger than the Thousand Sunny. During the Summit War of Marineford, he struck down and injured a Mythical Zoan user like Marco with a single blow and, in the anime, Garp took down Jesus Burgess, a master fighter with titanic physical strength effortlessly. In conjunction with his tremendous mastery of Haki, Garp's strength becomes monstrous, as he was able to obliterate a portion of a town with a single blow, toss Sanjuan Wolf, a giant with the ability to grow even more enormous clean into the ocean and almost drowned him in the process, and decimate multiple structures and land masses connected to Avalo Pizarro and his Devil Fruit.\n\nIn addition to his immense physical strength, Garp also has tremendous levels of durability and tolerance to pain, as seen when his chest was deeply slashed by Captain Morgan's axe hand, only to recover mere seconds later, with no obvious pain and apparently oblivious to the fact that he was struck at all. In fact, when informed by one of the Marines that he was nearly killed, he mistook this for one of the men being killed. It was only when he saw what the wound did, he realized what happened, as he fell asleep before being attacked. He was able to get back on his feet after allowing himself to be punched by Luffy in Gear 2 at point-blank range without losing consciousness and was still able to fight the Blackbeard Pirates along with Sengoku. On Hachinosu, Garp took numerous attacks from Kuzan, his former student who went through the same battleship punching training as Garp and came out with noticeably very little damage from his punches or his ice-based attacks. He was also run through with a sword by Shiryu, but not only did he shrug off the injury and attack Shiryu, but continued to fight a large number of the pirates on the island, including Kuzan and the rest of the Captains of the Blackbeard Pirates, holding them off long enough for the marines and the all the people rescued from the island to successfully escape.[49]\n\nGarp is also extremely fast and agile, seemingly disappearing as soon as he starts moving. He managed to bypass all of the Straw Hats in order to get to a sleeping Luffy, with none of them even being able to react until he was already past them. He is also fast enough to grab Kuzan, a former Marine Admiral, by the face and slam him to the ground before he managed to defend himself. He was quick enough to grab two random pirates just to block a flaming attack from Vasco Shot, and even after being stabbed by Shiryu, was able to move around fast enough to bowl over Kuzan and travel across the island to land a devastating attack on Avalo Pizarro.[18]\n\nTechniques\n\nAi aru Kobushi (愛ある拳?, literally meaning \"Fist of Love\"): A gag technique. It is a simple but powerful punch used to strike Luffy on his head. Garp had been shown to have used this on Ace during his childhood as well. In Pirate Warriors 2 and Pirate Warriors 3, the game adds the visual effect of a giant fist coming down on the enemies and is Garp's first Special Attack in both games. In the Funimation adaptions, it is called Fist of Love.\n\nGalaxy Impact (拳骨衝突（ギャラクシーインパクト）, Gyarakushī Inpakuto?, literally meaning \"Fist Collision\"): Garp infuses his fist with advanced Busoshoku Haki and Haoshoku Haki and then delivers a massively powerful shockwave punch that surrounds an enormous radius, devastating anything in its range. This attack was first seen used against the Blackbeard Pirates on Hachinosu.[50] In the anime, the shockwave looks more like an enormous explosion; in addition, while charging the attack, Garp's fist generates a massive red flash of light.\n\nGalaxy Divide (拳骨唐竹割（ギャラクシーディバイド）, Gyarakushī Dibaido?, literally meaning \"Fist Cleaving\"): Garp infuses his fist with Busoshoku and Haoshoku Haki and then delivers a powerful shockwave punch that creates a vertical fissure on his target. This was first seen used against the Hachinosu skull face controlled by Avalo Pizarro.[51] The name of the technique references a kenjutsu technique called karatake wari (唐竹割り?, \"splitting the Chinese bamboo\"), a downward vertical cut.\n\nBlue Hole (海底落下（ブルーホール）, Burū Hōru?, literally meaning \"Seafloor Fall\"): After hardening his hand with Busoshoku Haki and infusing it with Haoshoku Haki, Garp grabs an opponent by the face and slams them downwards, creating a massively deep hole in the ground as they fall. This was first seen used against Kuzan.[39] A blue hole is a large marine cavern or sinkhole.\n\nKaizoku Hinotama (海賊火の玉?, literally meaning \"Pirate Fireballs\"): An improvised technique Garp came up with after he used the bodies of defeated pirates to shield himself from Vasco Shot's fire stream. After the attack resulted in the pirates being engulfed in flames, Garp threw them in various directions causing damage to other pirates surrounding him.[52] In the VIZ manga, this is called Pirate Fireballs.\n\nRokushiki\n\nMain article: Rokushiki\n\nGarp is seemingly able to use Soru to move at great speed, being able to close the distance between himself and Kuzan in an instant.[39]\n\nHaki\n\nMain article: Haki\n\nAs a Vice Admiral of the Marines, Garp is fully capable of using Haki.[53] and is one of the very few people in the world who can use all three types of Haki. He is also a capable teacher, as he taught Kuzan, Koby and Helmeppo.\n\nHaoshoku Haki\n\nGarp possesses immense mastery in the usage of Haoshoku Haki, a rare form of Haki that only one in several million people in the world can use. Most notably, he is among the small \"handful\" of users who are capable of using the advanced application of \"infusing\" his Haoshoku Haki into parts of his body or objects, as signified by the thin streams of black lightning emanating from his fist.[50] Garp can also use Haoshoku Haki defensively, protecting himself from the deep-freezing effects of Kuzan's Ice Ball before easily breaking out of it.[39] Garp displayed advanced application at multiple points, notably during his fight with Kuzan, grabbing him by the face and sending him downward creating a large hole with a powerful Haoshoku attack, and once more on Avalo Pizarro, delivering a powerful Haoshoku shockwave punch that left a vertical injury on the pirate.[51]\n\nBusoshoku Haki\n\nGarp is an immensely skilled and powerful master of Busoshoku Haki. By hardening his fist, Garp became able to counter and even crush Chinjao's Busoshoku Haki-enhanced drill-shaped head 30 years ago, proving his superior mastery compared to Chinjao, who himself is a masterful Busoshoku Haki user in his own right.[34] During the Summit War of Marineford, he managed to punch and hurt Marco, despite the latter being in his regenerative phoenix form.[54] He can also utilize the advanced application of emitting Busoshoku Haki out from his hands, allowing him to attack opponents without making physical contact.[50][39][51]\n\nKenbunshoku Haki\n\nGarp is an extremely skilled and experienced user of Kenbunshoku Haki.[53] He could sense that Kuzan was present on Hachinosu and was going to freeze Hibari where other Kenbunshoku Haki users (Koby, Helmeppo, and Tashigi) could not sense him.[55] He was able to sense and catch Shiryu's attack when he attempted to attack a distracted Koby, despite the former jailer being invisible.\n\nWhen Koby awakened Kenbunshoku Haki, Dr. Fishbonen recommended that he ask Garp how to master it, suggesting Garp has enough expertise in it to mentor others.\n\nWeapons\n\nGarp throws cannonballs with his bare hands. The cannonballs soar much faster than when fired from a cannon, due to Garp's immense physical strength.[23] He also wields a giant iron ball, mounted on a chain, which dwarfs the size of his own Marine battleship.[56]\n\nTechniques\n\nGenkotsu Meteor (拳骨隕石（メテオ）, Genkotsu Meteo?, literally meaning \"Fist Meteorite\"): Garp throws a cannonball at an enemy ship. Due to Garp's superhuman strength, he can throw them like baseballs, and the impacts are more powerful than when being fired from an actual cannon.[57] In the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptions, this is called Meteor Fist.\n\nGenkotsu Ryuseigun (拳骨流星群, Genkotsu Ryūseigun?, literally meaning \"Fist Meteor Swarm\"): Garp throws one thousand iron cannonballs at enemy ships. The cannonballs are supplied by conveyor belts on either side of him.[58] In the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptions, this is called Meteor Fist Shower.\n\nVideo Game Attacks\n\nGenkotsu Satellite (拳・骨・衛星（サテライト）, Genkotsu Sateraito?, literally meaning \"Fist Satellite\"): Garp throws a large cannonball at his opponent. The size of the cannonball is slightly larger than his upper body. The attack first appeared in Pirate Warriors 2 as Garp's third Unique Action and is also usable in Pirate Warriors 3. In the English version it is translated as Satellite Fist.[59] The literal kanji reading for satellite is eisei.\n\nTokudai Tekkyu (特大鉄球, Tokudai Tekkyū?, literally meaning \"Extra-large Iron Ball\"): Garp throws an enormous cannonball at his enemies. The cannonball is several times larger than his body, and its name comes from what the Straw Hats screamed when Garp threw his ship-sized cannonball at the Thousand Sunny just before they escaped from Water 7.[56] The attack is usable in Pirate Warriors 3 as Garp's Special Kizuna Attack. In the English version it is translated as Oversized Iron Ball.[60]\n\nCho Tokudai Tekkyu (超・特大鉄球, Chō Tokudai Tekkyu?, literally meaning \"Super Extra-large Iron Ball\"): A slightly larger version of Tokudai Tekkyu. The attack first appeared in Pirate Warriors 2 as Garp's second Special Attack and is also usable in Pirate Warriors 3. In the English version it is translated as Super Oversized Iron Ball.[59]\n\nHistory\n\nPast\n\nBefore the Great Age of Pirates\n\nMonkey D. Garp was born 78 years ago in the Goa Kingdom in the East Blue.[6] He joined the Marines 56 years ago at the age of 22 along with Tsuru and Sengoku.[61] At 23, Garp started a family with an unknown woman and had a son named Monkey D. Dragon.[62] Over the years, Garp would rise up through the ranks of the Marines, eventually achieving the rank of Vice Admiral.\n\n38 years ago, Kong alerted Garp, who was on vacation, of an incident on God Valley involving the World Nobles and the Rocks Pirates. Initially Garp brushed it off as the God's Knights and other Marines were already on the island for their protection until Kong told him that the Roger Pirates were also there. This revelation caused Garp to immediately take the threat seriously and head over to God Valley, bringing along Bogard and a few more Marines with him to confront Gol D. Roger.[63] This event would later be labeled as the God Valley Incident, where Garp would earn his epithet of \"Hero of the Marines\" after successfully defeating Rocks D. Xebec at God Valley and protecting the Nobles through joint forces with Roger, the latter a detail that was not publicly reported due to Morgans covering only Garp's heroism. Garp rarely discusses the God Valley Incident as he feels shame about this event.[29][64] Around this time, Garp also chased other pirates like Shakuyaku as part of his duties.[40][65]\n\nAt some point, Garp was approached by Kuzan, who had already surpassed the standard Marine training and was ready for the next level, so he asked Garp to take him on as an apprentice. Garp initially refused, but eventually, through unknown events Garp did indeed end up training Kuzan. They trained using \"punching ships\", the same thing as punching bags, only they trained by punching the bow of scraped ships, leaving large indents in the ships they practiced on. As a rule of the training, they were not allowed to use Haki or Devil Fruit powers, just raw brute strength. During this training, Garp became more casual with Kuzan even talking to him about his son.[37]\n\nThirty years ago, he fought Chinjao and got his epithet as \"Garp the Fist\"[6] and also earned his hatred after denting his pointy head, which was the strongest head of that time, and robbing him of the means to acquire the treasure from the Ice Continent.[34] He became famous for cornering and fighting the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, numerous times in his career. Garp was offered a promotion to admiral position many times from Fleet Admiral Kong, but he declined every time. The main reason was because he refused to work under authority of the Celestial Dragons, according to Sengoku's statement.[24]\n\nThree years before Roger's execution, Garp hears about the Roger Pirates and the Golden Lion Pirates confrontation at Edd War. He then walks out on the then Fleet Admiral, Kong's office, and was accompanied by Tsuru, Jaguar D. Saul, Sakazuki and Kuzan who remarked that he rejected another promotion with Garp rebuffing it and asked Tsuru to give her ship to him. He then forces his way onto Admiral Sengoku's ship, much to Sengoku's annoyance.[66]\n\nPrior to Roger's execution, the Pirate King requested Garp to take care of his then-unborn child, as he thought the child did not deserve to be branded a criminal due to being born to a pirate.[32]\n\nWhen Shiki the Golden Lion attacked Marineford a week before Roger's execution, Garp and Sengoku challenged him together. After a grueling battle that devastated half of Marineford, they managed to defeat him. A number of months after the Pirate King's death, Garp went to Baterilla and visited Portgas D. Rouge. He was present at Ace's birth and Rouge's death afterward. Honoring Roger's last request, Garp took Ace to Dawn Island to be raised by Dadan. Garp would visit Ace during his vacations. Seventeen years prior to the start of the story, Garp became a grandfather to a newly born Monkey D. Luffy after his son had left him in his care.\n\nThe Three Brothers\n\nEarly on in Luffy's life, Garp trained him to become a strong Marine. Luffy was thrown into valleys, left alone in dangerous forests, and tied to balloons over high altitudes, all for the sake of making him stronger. After this, he left Luffy in the care of Dadan.[67] Despite Dadan not wanting to take care of another one of Garp's children, she complied. When Dadan voiced her displeasure of Garp's irresponsibility to take care of them himself, he became angered, making Dadan immediately take back what she said.[68]\n\nThroughout his visits, he would often hold \"training sessions\" with Luffy and Ace and on one occasion with Sabo.[69] When Garp first read in the newspaper that Ace had become the captain of the Spade Pirates, he was furious.[70]\n\nDiary of Koby-Meppo\n\nGarp was first introduced as the Marine Officer in charge of escorting Captain Morgan.[71] However, after Garp fell asleep, Morgan made his escape by striking Garp and taking Helmeppo as a hostage, fleeing on a small boat. Garp then woke up unfazed and broke a cannon while waking up.[72]\n\nAfter Koby returned with Helmeppo, they offered themselves to be punished, but Garp decided to take charge of the pair. He took them back to Marine Headquarters and oversaw their training.[73]\n\nAt some point, Garp was lecturing a class of Marine recruits on his special training regime program, when he asks them what they would do if they were riding in a boat and could only bring either a baby or an old man onboard. When Koby answered that he will let both of them ride in the boat while he gets off, Garp throws a marker at him and tells him that answer is wrong. Garp explains that the baby should be saved because the old man does not have much time left to live. He adds that the most important thing that the Marines should be trying to protect is the future of the people, meaning that the survival of babies and young people like Koby is more important than that of an old man. Later, he gets hit in the head and scolded for his lecture by the teacher who told him that all lives are equal, but Garp insists that the future of the young people is limitless.[74] Garp was then visited by Helmeppo who talked about how Koby has been improving but always has bandages wrapped around his hands shocking Garp with the fact that he was sneaking out for workout. Helmeppo explains he was asked by Koby to keep quiet, but he ultimately reveals to Garp that he had been training intensely in private so he can be one of the best Marines there is. He even went as far as to use Garp’s battleship bags to hone his strength, punching them to the point that his fists bled.[75]\n\nJango's Dance Paradise\n\nHe appears walking alongside Koby and Helmeppo, showing some of their physical change during Garp's training.[76]\n\nWater 7 Saga\n\nPost-Enies Lobby Arc\n\nAfter arriving at Water 7, he went to the small house where Luffy was recuperating from his battles at Enies Lobby. Vice Admiral Garp marched to the front of the temporary Galley-La Headquarters and told two subordinates in specific to wait outside. Garp broke through the wall and into the Straw Hats' room. He asked if they were the Straw Hats as everyone prepared to fight, but before they could do anything, Garp passed them and punched a sleeping Luffy's head into the floor, telling him to wake up. To everyone's surprise, Luffy screamed in pain. Garp then said that no one can escape his Fist of Love. He then removed his mask and told Luffy he heard he had been doing reckless things. Luffy was shocked to see that the man behind the mask was none other than his grandfather, and everyone else were even more surprised that Luffy's grandfather is a high-ranking Marine.[15]\n\nGarp said Luffy owed him an apology as he was causing trouble. Luffy told the others not to fight with his grandfather, as Garp had nearly killed him on many occasions in his childhood. Garp snapped at Luffy for making him sound like a bad guy for what he did in the past and claimed those incidents were aimed at turning Luffy into a strong man.\n\nGarp reminded Luffy that he wanted him to be a strong Marine, which Luffy countered by claiming he had always told him he wanted to be a pirate. Garp responded by saying that Luffy was negatively influenced by Shanks, to which Luffy took offense because Shanks saved his life. Garp suddenly grabbed Luffy, asking if he was trying to tell his grandpa what to do. Luffy's crew panicked over what to do until they found the pair have fallen asleep. Garp, being the first of the two to wake up, punched Luffy awake for falling asleep on him, while the others pointed out Garp did the same. Garp then ordered his men to repair the wall he damaged. The men said that Garp should help repair the wall as he destroyed it. Garp explained he did so because he thought it would look cool.\n\nAs Garp repaired the wall, he said he heard that Luffy met his father at Loguetown. Luffy did not have a clue about it and was clueless of even having a father in the first place. Garp then announced that Luffy's father is the revolutionary Monkey D. Dragon, causing a sudden shock amongst all those around him. After Robin explained to Luffy about Dragon, the Revolutionary Army, and their goals, Garp turned around and said that he should not have said that, asking them to forget he said anything, causing even more shock amongst everyone.[77]\n\nGarp told Luffy that he would let him go since he is his grandson and would use that as an excuse when informing his superior officers. However, his advisor Bogard told Garp it would be better to lie and say the Straw Hats got away. Garp then said that he mostly came for his students and announced his departure. Luffy said goodbye and Garp punched him, saying he was letting him leave too easily and berated him for being too casual about saying goodbye to his grandfather whom he had not seen in a while. Luffy complained by saying the only thing Garp has ever done was hit him to which Garp replied he just wanted to show love to and be loved by his grandson.[78]\n\nSome days later, Fleet Admiral Sengoku ordered Garp to return to Water 7 to capture Luffy. Garp's ship picked up Aokiji along the way, but only because he did not want to ride his bicycle. After returning to Water 7, Garp announced to Luffy that he was going to die there. Luffy argued that he said he would not attack, but Garp simply said he got his orders and proceeded to attack by throwing a cannonball at breakneck speed at them. The Straw Hats were amazed but prepared to defend the ship and started to set sail. Garp then asked for one thousand cannonballs, intending to throw them all at them. Garp began to get flustered and threw another cannonball, but Luffy knocked it out of the way. Luffy said he really had to run and hoped they would see each other again sometime.[79]\n\nGarp then took out an enormous iron ball and tossed it at the Thousand Sunny. Before it could crush the Thousand Sunny, Franky activated Coup de Burst to launch the ship up into the sky. The Straw Hats got away, but Garp just laughed.[80]\n\nSummit War Saga\n\nThe following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story.\n\nOne Piece Film: Strong World\n\nWhen Shiki returned from his 20-year disappearance, he attacked Marineford Headquarters by using his powers to levitate and hurl fleets of ships at the island. Garp identified Shiki right away, recognizing his abilities from past encounters. Garp wondered if he had returned to get revenge on the world.[81]\n\nConcludes non-canon section.\n\nSabaody Archipelago Arc\n\nAfter his grandson's assault on Thriller Bark, he was seen at Mary Geoise with Bartholomew Kuma and Sengoku, where he laughed at how Luffy had avoided capture by Kuma and annoyed Sengoku by talking about tea and crackers.[82]\n\nRecently, Garp found out that Silvers Rayleigh was to be sold as a slave on the Sabaody Archipelago, whom he assumed let himself get captured to pay off a gambling debt. Due to the Marines being busy with the incident regarding Whitebeard and the execution of Portgas D. Ace, Garp remarked that he would take care of the situation.[83]\n\nImpel Down Arc\n\nHe later visited Ace in Impel Down. Upon Ace's request to die, Garp merely told him that his death would not stop Whitebeard. They later discussed family issues such as Ace and Luffy's turning to the life of piracy instead of becoming Marines. Ace also told Garp that he only considered Whitebeard as his true father.[84]\n\nBack at Marineford, Garp was informed that Luffy broke into Impel Down and was rather amused about it, even proud. Sengoku was furious and said that if Garp was not a hero to the Marines, he would have him punished for his family's actions. Garp just laughed and stated that an old man's life could not atone for his family's actions.[85]\n\nMarineford Arc\n\nThree hours before Ace was to be executed, Garp walked with Sengoku to the execution platform. Sengoku told him that he would tell the public everything and Garp did not express any objections. As Sengoku began his public announcement on the execution platform, Tsuru told Garp that it was not his fault. Garp just laughed and said that women get so sentimental at times like these. Once Sengoku revealed that Ace was truly the son of Gol D. Roger, Garp remembered the time when Roger personally begged him to protect his unborn child.[86]\n\nAfter the war began, Garp sat with Ace and Sengoku on top of the execution platform, upset at the present events. He stated that while he felt no sorrow for scoundrels, he felt differently when it came to Ace, who was family. Garp bitterly lamented that both Ace and Luffy did not become Marines.[87]\n\nUpon Luffy's arrival at Marineford, Garp was utterly shocked. Nevertheless, he managed to calm down long enough to comment on the viability of the motley little band that Luffy had assembled at Impel Down as part of Ace's rescue effort. Later, when Sengoku revealed Luffy's status as the son of Dragon the Revolutionary, Garp stated that with the infamy and power Luffy had acquired, such knowledge being brought to the general public hardly made a difference.\n\nAfter Luffy was hurled over the siege wall and stood before the three admirals, Garp was shown to be worried about his grandson. He was later seen with Sengoku, getting ready to participate in the battle. Garp later punched Marco, who had transformed into his Phoenix form, while he was trying to save Ace. Garp then challenged the Whitebeard Pirates, saying that they would have to kill him before they could reach Ace.[88] When Luffy released a massive burst of Haoshoku Haki, Garp said he knew his grandson had that kind of power inside him.[89]\n\nWhen Luffy came close to reaching Ace, thanks to Inazuma's powers, Garp himself confronted him. He smashed part of the bridge in the process, saying that he could not let Luffy pass. He again complained about Luffy and Ace becoming pirates instead of Marines and declared that he considered them enemies.[90]\n\nAs he was about to hit Luffy, he recalled Ace's renewed desire to live and reminisced about when Ace and Luffy were both young. Finding himself unwilling to resist, Garp closed his eyes, missing his punch. Thus, he allowed Luffy to land a Gear 2 punch that sent him flying and smashing into the ground, much to the shock of the Marines watching him.[91]\n\nGarp later dislodged himself, more or less unfazed, and rejoined the battle. After witnessing Ace being pierced from behind by Akainu's magma fist, Garp flew into a rage, prompting Sengoku to stop him, grabbing his head from behind and slamming him to the ground. Coughing up blood, Garp snarled that Sengoku should keep him down tight or he would murder Sakazuki. Sengoku responded by calling Garp a fool. When Ace died, Garp wept over the loss of his grandson.[92]\n\nWhen Whitebeard began attacking Marineford Headquarters after the death of Ace, Garp commented that Newgate was putting an end to this era, which he welcomed. As Whitebeard lost his life at the hands of the Blackbeard Pirates, Garp watched with a grim expression. After acquiring the Gura Gura no Mi from Whitebeard's corpse, Blackbeard commented to both Garp and Sengoku that their age was over, much like Whitebeard's.\n\nLater, he heard someone yelling to everyone. He saw Koby standing in front of Admiral Akainu, calling for an end to the war. Upon seeing Shanks making an appearance at Marineford, Garp made a snarling comment about the pirate who influenced Luffy into the path of piracy. When Sengoku announced that the war was over, Garp stood down along with the rest of the Marines.\n\nPost-War Arc\n\nWith the end of the war, Garp took up a station in Foosha Village on Dawn Island, seeing it as necessary to protect the island with the increase in pirate activities. After returning to the village, he took a beating from Curly Dadan for letting Ace die until Makino intervened. Makino tried to tell Dadan that Garp was suffering the most from Ace's death, but Dadan replied that the one suffering the most was Luffy. After Dadan calmed down, Garp informed Woop Slap that Luffy escaped Marineford in a submarine.[93]\n\nIt was later revealed that both him and Sengoku stepped down from the Marines. However, both would remain for the sake of rearing up new young Marines.[3]\n\nThe following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story.\n\nDressrosa Saga\n\nOne Piece Film: Z\n\nAfter Firs Island was destroyed by Z, Garp appeared on a Marine battleship along with Koby and Helmeppo, and revealed to them the existence of Z. Later, after the destruction of Secon Island, he and Sengoku explained to them Z's past.[94]\n\nWhole Cake Island Saga\n\nMarine Rookie Arc\n\nGarp was in his office when he received a call from Vice Admiral Prodi, who was angry about the new transfer Grount's actions in his base on Fron Island. Garp simply asked Prodi to take care of Grount.[95]\n\nConcludes non-canon section.\n\nLevely Arc\n\nAfter the Neptune Family arrived at the surface to the Red Port at the Red Line, Garp escorted them to the bondola. He commented on Shirahoshi's beauty that exceeds everyone's expectations when the media was taking pictures of her. When he met Sterry, Garp claimed that he did not know him and openly insulted him before half-heartedly taking it back after he was told that Sterry was the king of Goa Kingdom. As the Neptune Family rode on the bondola, Garp waved one last time to Shirahoshi.[96]\n\nAfter the Marines intercepted a communication between Big Mom and Kaidou, Garp remained calm despite the fact that the two Emperors had a grudge against Luffy. He then spoke with Hina about a pirate group prominent before Roger's era during which suggested that he got the distinction of \"Hero of the Marines\" from dealing with them while Garp noted that he could not imagine what the Marines would do if said crew were to come back into power.[29]\n\nWano Country Saga\n\nThe following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story.\n\nOne Piece: Stampede\n\nGarp appears at the Marine Headquarters listening to Brannew's talk about Douglas Bullet and the current situation on Delta Island. Then, he meets Sengoku outside, with whom he talks about Bullet's past.[97]\n\nConcludes non-canon section.\n\nWano Country Arc\n\nAfter the Levely, Garp went to Fish-Man Island with Neptune and his family. While conversing with Neptune, Garp mentioned an incident involving Arabasta that occurred after they left Mary Geoise.[98] While leaving Fish-Man Island, Garp read a report, being informed of the alliance between Kaidou and Big Mom, much to his annoyance.[99]\n\nFinal Saga\n\nEgghead Arc\n\nWeeks later, Koby was reported to have been abducted by the Blackbeard Pirates, so Garp sailed to G-14 before heading to Hachinosu. Vice Admiral Doll tried to dissuade Garp from taking Helmeppo and starting a fight with an Emperor, but Garp ignored her protests and yelled for Helmeppo to join him in rescuing Koby.[100] Having recruited members of SWORD and Tashigi for his mission, the Marines departed to Hachinosu. Upon SWORD beginning their attack on the island and Garp's ship approaching it, the ship was launched from the sea to above the island. Telling the pirates how important Koby is to the future of the Marines and himself, he infused his fist in Haoshoku Haki and attacked the island with Galaxy Impact and decimated the surrounding area.[101]\n\nGarp then landed safely and stated he was disappointed that he had lost his touch with his attack, much to the shock and surprise of the Blackbeard Pirates. Garp was then confronted by Kuzan, who froze Hibari and stated he would not let Koby escape. Garp then demanded that Kuzan unfreeze Hibari, set Koby free, and return to the Marines, but Kuzan rejected his demands, stating he always loved that Garp did what he wanted. Kuzan then froze Garp with Ice Ball, asking Garp if he could kill his old protégé to protect his new one, but Garp only replied he had told Kuzan that he should live in the moment and that wavering would be a sign of weakness. He then imbued his hand with Busoshoku and Haoshoku Haki and grabbed Kuzan mid-air, slamming him into the ground below with Blue Hole.[102]\n\nGarp threw Sanjuan Wolf into the sea, which caused the Blackbeard Pirates to rush in to save him from drowning. Vasco Shot then tried burning Garp, but the old man merely used random pirates as human shields. Shiryu attempted to stab Koby while he was invisible, but Garp stepped in front of him and took the attack instead. Kuzan then returned and resumed battling.[49] As Avalo Pizarro was about to crush Garp's ship and all the marines and escaped slaves on it with his massive hand of rock and soil, Garp ordered Koby, Helmeppo, and Grus to deal with the hand while he attacked the giant stone skull, delivering serious damage to Pizarro. As Koby and the rest of SWORD successfully escaped the island, Garp was pierced though the chest again, this time by Kuzan's ice. Garp smiled as he told everyone via the Den Den Mushi to never forget they were the future of the Marines as Wolf, Shiryu, Pizarro, Shot and Kuzan closed in on him. Then Garp started laughing and the transmission ended.[103]\n\nAdaptation Differences\n\nAnime Differences\n\nIn the anime, the Marines accompanying Garp identified him, not Nami immediately and she only calls him that after hearing his name.\n\nIn the anime, Garp attacks Jesus Burgess when he moves to strike Sengoku while he is distracted. After the war ended, he orders the soldiers to gather the wounded so no one else would die.\n\nIn the anime, a young Luffy blurted out that the trio shared a promise over a shared drink. Garp overheard them boasting of their dreams to become pirates, leaving him infuriated. Garp then chases them out into the night, breaking down trees and rocks and beating them all to a pulp. Sabo exclaimed he was a monster. Afterwards, he casually leaves them, saying that he will not be so merciful next time. This was not shown in the manga. In the manga version, Garp was shown saying hello first before \"training\" them.\n\nLive-Action Differences\n\nIn the live-action series, Garp's role in the story is changed drastically from the manga. Garp's relationship to Luffy is made clear much earlier than the manga, with Zoro, Nami, and Usopp learning that he is Luffy's grandfather as early as their first sail on the Going Merry. Garp chases the Straw Hat Pirates across the East Blue, from Shells Town to Cocomi Islands, instead of meeting them after the events at Enies Lobby. Garp is also much more dedicated to capturing Luffy and ending his pirate career before it begins.\n\nWhen Garp's ship intercepts the Going Merry, Luffy manages to deter the Marines by bouncing one of their cannon balls back at their mast as the Straw Hats escape through a fog.\n\nAfter the Straw Hats arrive at the Baratie, Garp enlists the help of Dracula Mihawk to bring Luffy in alive. When Mihawk refuses to, even with the threat of revoking his status as Warlord, Garp is irate. He later talks to Koby about the Warlords and expresses his disdain for the World Government's decisions and why he remains a Vice-Admiral.\n\nGarp arrives at the Baratie to ask Zeff about Luffy's whereabouts. Garp confesses to Zeff why he is insistent on capturing Luffy.\n\nAs Straw Hats celebrate their victory over Arlong and his crew, Garp and the Marines arrive at Coco Village. Garp plans to bring the Straw Hats in, but Luffy refuses to yield. Garp and Luffy fight, with the former dominating the battle. After seeing Roger's own determination and spirit in him, Garp changes his mind on arresting Luffy and instead orders his Marines to hunt the stragglers of Arlong's crew. He later receives his grandson's first bounty, impressed by how far he has come.\n\nMajor Battles\n\nMonkey D. Garp and Gol D. Roger vs. Rocks Pirates (unseen)\n\nMonkey D. Garp vs. Gol D.

Garp vs. Vasco Shot, Shiryu and Kuzan\n\nFiller Battles\n\nMonkey D. Garp vs. Jesus Burgess\n\nEarly Concepts\n\nWhile unnamed, Garp was introduced in Romance Dawn, Version 2 (featured in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine itself) as Luffy's grandfather. For a long time, it was first thought that Luffy's unnamed Grandfather was a sole addition to Romance Dawn V.2.\n\nSome aspects of his character remain from Romance Dawn V.2. He is as hot tempered as ever and intolerant of Luffy's antics. Like the final version, he was determined to make Luffy follow in his footsteps, however here he is a pirate captain, the complete opposite of his current occupation. Both stories have in return Luffy completely rejecting the idea of following in his grandfather's footsteps. Garp now occasionally wears a dog hat and compared to his chubby Romance Dawn V.2 version, his upper body is much more muscular.\n\nOne feature carried over from Luffy's grandfather from V.2 to the final version of Garp was the scar on his left eye. Also, Luffy got both his hat and the Devil fruit he ate from his grandfather in V.2, not Shanks. According to Oda the reason for not featuring Shanks was that he wanted Shanks to be kept a secret until One Piece was serialized so he would have a greater impact.[104]\n\nWhen V.2 was adapted into Episode 907 of the anime as a celebration of the series' 20th anniversary, he had Garp's muscular physique instead of the chubby appearance he had in the manga. He also had Garp's voice actors.\n\nMerchandise\n\nVideo Games\n\nPlayable Appearances\n\nOne Piece: Unlimited Cruise\n\nOne Piece: Pirate Warriors 2\n\nOne Piece: Pirate Warriors 3\n\nOne Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 (young version; DLC)\n\nOne Py Berry Match\n\nOne Piece Treasure Cruise\n\nOne Piece: Burning Blood (DLC)\n\nOne Piece Thousand Storm\n\nOne Piece Bon!

This is somewhat unique as most characters only stick with one laughter style (the only other character sharing this distinction being Dracule Mihawk).\n\nGarp appears to have a dog animal-theme, as shown by his mask and his ship.\n\nIn the 4th, 5th and 7th fan polls of most popular characters, Garp was ranked the 50th, 74th and 44th, respectively.\n\nIn One Piece Magazine Vol.5, Oda drew a \"what-if\" illustration of Ace, Luffy, and Sabo as Marines. Garp was seen wielding a pair of katana swords.[107]\n\nGarp's favorite foods are senbei and curry.[6]\n\nDuring their youths, Garp's looks were strikingly similar to Luffy's own, and, in an ironic twist of fate, Garp and Luffy would have a similar appearance to the former's long-term rival Gol D. Roger, before the latter appeared more so like his son Ace as he got older.\n\nSBS-Based Trivia\n\nA fan pointed out the fact that despite Garp's few appearances, his trademark scar has disappeared 25 times if counted up to Volume 58. In response to the statement above, Oda joked that \"if an enemy he hates is around, his scar tingles, and it will float up\" and that Garp's \"true form\" may be the scar-less one, but he also points out that this is not proved anywhere.[108]\n\nAccording to Oda, the reason Garp's \"Fist of Love\" can injure his rubber-bodied grandson Luffy is not due to Busoshoku Haki but simply \"love\".[109]\n\nReferences\n\nSite Navigation\n\nMarine Officers:Subordinates and Others:Non-Canon:\n\nFormer MarinesMarine Officers:Subordinates and Others:Non-Canon:\n\nTransportationShip(s):Vehicles:\n\nAbilitiesDevil Fruit Based:Fighting Style Based:Weapon Based:\n\nRelated ArticlesMarine Bases:Groups:Events:Concepts:Story Arcs:Cover Stories:Movies:Specials, Featurettes and OVAs:Other:\n\nMonkey Family:\n\nMonkey D.
