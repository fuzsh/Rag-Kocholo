Christopher went and sat. He was a brown child of eleven, with a grave face and a sudden pleasant smile. His bent knees showed the shininess of his trousers. \"Have to be careful, you know,\" said Sorrell. The father's dark head was close to the boy's brown one. He too was shiny in a suit of blue serge. His long figure seemed to curve over the portmanteau with anxiously rounded shoulders and sallow and intent face. The child beside him made him look dusty and frail. \"Now, the other one, old chap. Can't afford to be rough. Gently does it.\" He was a little out of breath, and he talked in short jerky sentences as he pulled carefully at the straps. A broken strap would be a disaster, for the clasp of the lock did not function, and this dread of a trivial disaster seemed to show in the carefulness of the man's long and intelligent hands. They were cautious yet flurried. His breathing was audible in the room. \"That's it.\" The words expressed relief. He was kneeling, and as he looked up towards the window and saw the strip of sky and the grimy cornice and grey slates of the house across the way, his poise suggested the crouch of a creature escaping from under some huge upraised foot. For the last three -2 ears, ever since his demobilization, life had been to Sorrell Tike some huge trampling beast, and he—a furtive thin down in the mud, panting, dodging, bewildered, resentf and afraid. Now he had succeeded in strapping that portmanteau. \"They were slipping away from under the shadow of the great beast. Sornething had turned up to help the man to save his last made-to-measure suit, his boy, and the remnant of his gentility. Horrible word! He stroked his little black moustache, and considered the portmanteau. \"Well,—that's that, son.\" He smiled faintly, and Kit's more radiant smile broke out in response. To the boy the leaving of this beastly room in a beastly street was a glorious adventure, for they were going into the country. \"It will want a label, pater.\" \"It will. 'Sorrell and son, passengers, Staunton'!\" \"How's it going to the station?\" Sorrell rose, dusting the knees of his trousers. Each night he folded them carefully and put them under the mattress. \"I've arranged with Mr. Sawkins. He'll take it early and leave it in the cloak-room.\" For Sorrell still kept his trousers creased, nor had he reached that state of mind when a man can contemplate with unaffected naturalness the handling of his own luggage. There were still things he did and did not do. He was a gentleman. True, society had come near to pushing him off the shelf of his class-consciousness into the welter of the casual and the unemployed, but, though hanging by his hands, he had refused to drop. Hence Mr. Sawkins, and Mr. Sawkins' coster's barrow, transport for the Sorrell baggage. \"What time is the train, pater?\" \"Ten twenty.\" \"And what time do we get to Staunton?\" \"About three.\" \"And where are we going to stay?\" \"Oh,—I shall get a room before fixing up with Mr. Verity. He may want us to live over—over the shop.\" There were times when Sorrell felt very self-conscious in the presence of the boy. The pose he had adopted before Christopher dated from the war, and it had survived various -3 humiliations, hunger, shabbiness, and the melodramatic disappearance of Christopher's mother. Sorrell turned and looked at himself in the mirror on the dressing table. He patted his dark hair. \"Over—the shop.\" Yes, the word had cost him an effort. \"Captain Sorrell, M.C.\" To Christopher he wished to remain Captain Sorrell, M.C. He felt moved to explain to the boy that Mr. Verity's shop at Staunton was not an ordinary shop. Mr. Verity dealt in antiques; the business had flavour, perfume; it smelt of lavender and old rose-leaves and not of cheese or meat. Mr. Verity—too—appeared to be something of a character, an old bachelor, with a preference for a man of some breeding as a possible assistant. Also, Mr. Verity was a sentimentalist—a patriotic sentimentalist. He had been in correspondence with the Ex-Officers' Association, and Stephen Sorrell had been offered the job. He was going down to Staunton to discover whether he and Mr. Verity would harmonize. Sorrell adjusted the wings of his bow tie, and considered the problem of Christopher and Mr. Verity's shop. Should he be frank with the boy, or keep up the illusion of their separateness from the common world? He could say that he was going into business with Mr. Verity, and that in these days a shop—especially an antique shop—was quite ''à la mode.'' Yells from the street broke in upon his meditations. Someone had scored a goal, and someone else had refused to accept the validity of the goal. \"Damn those kids!\" said the man. He looked at his own boy. \"Pater.\" \"Yes.\" \"Shall I go to school at Staunton?\" \"Of course. I expect there will be a Grammar School at Staunton. I shall arrange it when I have settled things with Mr. Verity.\" \"Will it be a gentleman's school, pater?\" \"O, yes; we must see to that.\" There was a pause in the adventure, for on this last evening in London there was nothing left for them to do, and on warm evenings Lavender Street did not smell of herbs. Its smells were very various and unoriginal. It combined -4 the domestic perfumes of boiled cabbage and fried fish with an aroma of horse-dung and rancid grease. It was a stuffy street. The clothes and bodies of most of its inhabitants exuded a perfume of stale sweat. The boy had the imagined scent of the country in his nostrils. \"Let's go out.\" \"Where to?\" \"Let's go and look at the river.\" They went, becoming involved for a moment in a mob of small boys who were all yelling at once and trying to kick a piece of sacking stuffed with paper. Kit was pushed against his father, but reacting with sensitive sturdiness, upset one of the vociferous crew into the gutter where he forgot Kit's shove in the business of eluding other feet. Sorrell noticed that the boy was flushed. He was conscious of himself as something other than those Lavender Street children. He did not want to be touched by them. \"We'll be out of it, to-morrow, son.\" \"I'm glad,\" said the boy. Sorrell was thinking of Christopher's schooling, and he was still thinking of it when they paused half-way across Hungerford Bridge and stood leaning on the iron rail. The boy had had to go to a Council school. He had hated it, and so had Sorrell, but for quite different reasons. With the man it had been a matter of resentful pride, but for the boy it had meant contact with common children, and Kit was not a common child. He had all the fastidious nauseas of a boy who has learnt to wash and to use a handkerchief, and not to yell \"cheat\" at everybody in the heat of a game. Sorrell stood and dreamed, and yet remained aware of the kindling face of the boy who was watching the life of the river, a pleasure steamer going up-stream, a man straining at a sweep upon a barge, a police-boat heading for the grey arches of Waterloo Bridge. To Sorrell the scene was infinitely familiar yet bitterly strange. The soft grey atmosphere shot through with pale sunlight was the atmosphere of other evenings, and yet how different! His inward eyes looked through the eyes of the flesh. To him London had always seemed most beautiful here, a city of civic stateliness, mellow, floating upon the curve of the river. He had loved -5 the blue black dusk and the lights, the dim dome of St. Paul's like the half of a magic bubble, the old \"shot\" towers, the battered redness of the Lion brewery, the opulence of the Cecil and the Savoy, the green of the trees in Charing Cross gardens. He remembered that he had dined and danced at the Savoy. Spacious days! Khaki, and women who had seemed more than women on those life-thirsty nights when he had been home on leave. Odalisques! Women! How through he was with women! He remembered a night when he had taken his wife to the Savoy. Two years ago his wife had left him, and her leaving him had labelled him a shabby failure. She had had no need to utter the words. And all that scramble after the war, the disillusionment of it, the drying up of the fine and foolish enthusiasms, the women going to the rich fellows who had stayed at home, the bewilderment, the sense of bitter wrong, of blood poured out to be sucked up by the lips of a money-mad materialism. He looked at the face of his boy. \"Yes, it's just a scramble,\" he thought, \"but an organized scramble. The thing is to keep on your feet and fight, and not to get trampled on in the crush. Thank God I have got only one kid.\" Kit, head up, his cap in his hand, was smiling at something, the eager and vital boy with the clear eyes and fresh skin. To him life was beginning its adventure. He saw the river and the city in the splendour of their strength and their mystery. The Savoy and the Cecil were still palaces of the great and adventurous unknown, and Sorrell, full of the grim business of existence, felt a sudden deep tenderness towards the boy. \"I suppose it's egotism,\" he thought, \"but I'll try to give him a better chance in the scramble than I have had. After all we are more honest in our egotism,—these days. The thing is not to love your neighbour, but to be able to make it unsafe for him to try and down you. Co-operation in bargaining, organized grab. But you have to bargain with some sort of weapon in your hand.\" Standing there beside his boy and watching the light and the life upon the river, Sorrell felt himself to be weapon- -6 less. What was he but a pair of hands, and a rather frail body in a shabby suit of clothes? He thought of his wounds, wounds of the flesh and of the spirit. He met Kit's smile. \"I say, pater, is there a river at Staunton{{bar|2}}\" \"A small one.\" He was realizing that the niche at Mr. Verity's might also be a very small one, but at least it was a niche in the social precipice. {{anchor|Section 2}}{{ph|class=section|2}} Sorrell and son arrived at Staunton about three in the afternoon. Amid the clatter of empty milk cans Sorrell addressed himself to the porter who was removing the brown portmanteau from the luggage van, but the porter either did not or would not trouble to hear him. \"Do you mind being careful with that? The straps{{bar|2}}\" The porter swung the portmanteau out of the van and let it fall with a full flop upon the platform, and like Judas it burst asunder, and extruded a portion of its contents upon the asphalt. Sorrell looked sad. \"You shouldn't have done that, you know.\" It was a bad omen, and he bent down to recover a boot, a clothes brush and a tobacco tin, and to stuff the crumpled nakedness of an unwashed shirt back into the gaping interior. The porter, full of sudden compunction, bent down to help him. \"I'll find you a bit of cord. The stitching of the straps must have been rotten.\" Christopher stood and looked on while Sorrell and the porter applied first aid to their piece of luggage. The incident had touched the boy; he had seen that look in his father's eyes, and he felt—somehow—that it was not the portmanteau but his father who had gaped and betrayed a whole clutter of painful and shabby problems. Poor old pater! But his boy's tenderness was touched with pride. Sorrell was putting the porter's contrition to other uses. -7 Before reaching Staunton he had counted the ready money that remained to him, and it amounted to thirteen shillings and five-pence. \"Do you know of any lodgings; clean, but not too dear?\" The porter was knotting a length of cord round the body of the portmanteau. \"Staying here? What sort of lodgings?\" \"I am taking up a post in the town. A bed-sitting-room for me and the boy. I don't mind how plain it is{{bar|2}}\" \"I've got an aunt,\" said the porter, \"who lets lodgings. There's a room, up at the top. Fletcher's Lane. Not a hundred yards off.\" \"Would she board us?\" \"Feed you?\" \"Yes.\" \"She might. Look here,—I'm going off duty in ten minutes or so. I'll show you the way.\" \"I'm very much obliged to you.\" Sorrell gave him the five pennies. \"Thank you, sir. I'll pop this round for you on my shoulder.\" No. 7, Fletcher's Lane, accepted the Sorrells and packed them away in a big attic-like room under the roof. It had a dormer window with a view of the cathedral towers and the trees of the Close, and between the cathedral and the dormer window of No. 7 every sort of roof and chimney ran in broken reds and greys and browns. The room was clean, with a white coverlet on the bed, a square of linoleum in the centre of the floor, and a smaller piece in front of the yellow washstand. The chest of drawers had lost a leg and most of its paint, and when you opened a top drawer it was necessary to put a knee against one of the lower drawers to prevent the whole chest from toppling forward. The landlady asked Sorrell if he would like tea, and he glanced at his wrist watch. \"I have to go out first. Would half-past five do?\" \"Nicely. Will you take an egg to it?\" \"Yes, an egg each, please. And could I have a little hot water!\" The hot water was forthcoming in a battered tin jug, and Sorrell washed himself, brushed his clothes and hair, -8 wiped the dust from his boots, and glanced at himself in the little mirror. First impressions were important, and he wanted to make a good impression upon Mr. Verity. His blue suit was old and shiny, but it was well cut, and the trousers were creased. \"I'm just going round to see Mr. Verity. You might unpack, old chap.\" Christopher was leaning out of the window and inhaling the newness and the freshness of Staunton. \"Yes,—I will, pater.\" \"We'll have some tea when I come back, and a stroll round. This is only a temporary roost.\" \"It's better than Lavender Street,\" said the boy. Mr. Verity's shop was in the Market Square, and Sorrell, on turning out of Fletcher's Lane found himself in Canon's Row. A passing postman, questioned as to the whereabouts of the Market Square, jerked a thumb and said \"Straight on.\" Sorrell did not hurry. He was pleasurably excited, and as he strolled up Canon's Row he saw the short, broad High Street opening out before him. It was all red and white and grey. The Angel Inn thrust out a floating golden figure. Higher up, a clock projected from the Market Hall with its stone pillars and Dutch roof, and its statue of William of Orange in a niche in the centre of the south wall. The Market Square spread itself, a great sunny space into which the more shadowy High Street flowed. It was surrounded by old houses that had been built when Anne and the Georges reigned. In the centre the market cross carried time back to the Tudors. A vine covered one little low house, and another was a smother of wistaria. There were queer bay windows, white porches, leaded hoods, and at the end the chequered Close threw a massive and emphatic shadow. Above and beyond, the towers caught the sunlight, rising from the green cushions of old limes and elms, and backed by brilliant white clouds in a sky of brilliant blue. Sorrell paused outside the Angel Inn, for the old town pleased him. Not a bad spot to settle in, to listen to the bells, and to feel that life was less of a hectic scramble. And dabbling in old things, handling old china and glass and Sheffield plate, the creations of dead craftsmen who had not -9 hurried. No doubt old Verity had absorbed the atmosphere of oak and mahogany, maple and walnut. He might have a richly brocaded soul. Sorrell strolled on into the Market Square. He looked about him, and then crossed the cobbles and questioned a policeman who was on traffic duty. \"Mr. Verity's shop?\" \"Over there,—near the gate.\" Sorrell was half-way across the Market Place when he realized that there was something queer about Mr. Verity's shop. He saw it as a red house with a white cornice and white window sashes, and painted in white letters on a black fascia-board \"John Verity—Dealer in Antiques,\" But the shop was shut, the windows were screened by black shutters. Sorrell glanced at the other shops. No, it was not early closing day; the other shops were open. He crossed the rest of the space more quickly, and sighting a black door beside the shop, with a brass bell handle in the white door-jamb, he pulled the bell. He was puzzled, aware of a sudden suspense, and when the door opened he found himself staring at the face of a woman who had been weeping. \"Is Mr. Verity in?\" The woman's eyelids flickered. \"Mr. Verity died this morning.\" Sorrell's mouth hung open. \"What{{bar|2}}!\" \"Yes—sudden{{bar|2}}. it must have been his heart. He fell down the stairs—O,—dear{{bar|2}}\" She began to whimper, while Sorrell stood there with a blank face. He realized that the woman was closing the door. He blurted something. \"I've just come down. I was to be—the assistant. It's very;—I'm sorry{{bar|2}}\" \"It was so sudden,\" said the woman. \"Of course—without him—nothing—you know. I'm sorry. Have you come far?\" \"From London.\" \"Dear, dear, and you will have to go all the way back{{peh|—}} -10 for nothing, It's awkward,—but there it is. If you'll excuse me—now.\" She closed the door, and Sorrell stood staring at it. {{anchor|Section 3}}{{ph|class=section|3}} Sorrell's first feeling was one of bitter resentment against old Verity for dying in so sudden and inconvenient a fashion, but before he had re-crossed the Market Square he had realized the absurdity of his anger. It died away, leaving him with a sense of emptiness at the pit of his stomach, and a chilly tremor quivering down his spine. He was trembling. His knees were so weak under him that when he passed through the gateway of the Close, and saw a seat under a lime tree, he made towards it and sat down. He felt helpless, bewildered, for the disappointment,—coming as the last of many such disappointments, seemed to have fallen on him with the cumulative weight of the whole series. He put a hand into a pocket for his pipe and pouch. His fingers moved jerkily, and when he lit a match his hand was so unsteady that he had difficulty in lighting his pipe. The nausea of an intense discouragement was upon him. He felt tired, so tired that his impulse was to lie down and to admit defeat, and to allow himself to be trampled into the mud of forgetfulness. His senses were dulled, and the whole atmosphere of this quiet old town had changed. Half an hour ago he had been vividly aware of the blueness of the sky and of the tranquil white domed clouds floating above tower and tree, but now the objective world seemed vague and grey. His feeling of despair cast a shadow. He thought of Christopher waiting in that upper room for is tea. He shrank from the idea of facing the boy, of going back there with a hang-dog illusion dead in his eyes. All the sordid and trivial realities of the business buzzed round him like flies. He had thirteen shillings in his pocket; he would owe the woman for food and a night's lodging; there would be the cost of the tickets back to London; that damned portmanteau needed mending; and if they returned to London there was nowhere for them to go. {{nop}} -11 He realized the nearness of a panic mood. He got up. \"When you are in a blue funk, do something.\" That was one of the human tags brought back from France. He remembered that he had won his M.C. by \"doing something\" as a protest against the creeping paralysis of intense ear. He walked back to Fletcher's Lane, and climbing the stairs, paused for a moment outside the door of the room. He was trembling. He heard the woman moving somewhere below, and leaning over the banisters he called to her. \"We are ready for tea, please.\" His own voice surprised him. It was resonant, and it had a quality of cheerfulness, and it seemed to express the upsurging within him of some subconscious element that was stronger than his conscious self. He opened the door and went in. The boy was standing by the window. He had unpacked their belongings; a {{hinc|nightshirt}} and a pair of pyjamas lay on the bed; brushes, a razor, a comb, and three old pipes were arranged upon the dressing-table. Father and son looked at each other. \"Well, my son, what about tea?\" Kit continued to look at his father; his eyes were very solemn. \"Mr. Verity's dead,\" said the father; \"he died this morning. So—Staunton's a wash-out. Well, what about tea?\" The boy's face seemed to flush slightly. His lips moved. It was as though he was aware of something in his father, something fine and piteous, a courage, something that made him want to burst into tears. \"Sorry, pater.\" His lips quivered. \"We—we'll have to make the best of it.\" And suddenly—and with a kind of fierceness, Sorrell caught his son and kissed him. {{anchor|Section 4}}{{ph|class=section|4}} Afterwards, they went out and sat in the cathedral and wandered about the Close under the shade of the elms and limes. The evening was very still, and the sunlight sifted through the trees and lay gently upon the mown grass. -12 Swans cruised upon the moat surrounding the Bishop's palace. There was the sheen of water, and the mellowness of old red walls seen through the dappled foliage of trees. The canons' houses, sealed away in pleasant security, gave through their gateways glimpses of their gardens. Jackdaws circled about the towers, their cries dropping from above into the deeps of a green tranquillity. A sunset filled the lacework of the leaves with red and gold, and the smooth and stately security of the Close caught moments of mystery. Sorrell and the boy were sitting on a seat above the water, with a slope of vivid grass going down to it, and a weeping willow trailing its branches in a stream of yellow light. It seemed to Sorrell that no one who lived near the shadowy splendour of these towers and trees could know what poverty was, or hunger, or the filthy dread that oozes like slime over a man's soul. Life seemed so secure here, so incredibly secure. He sat there, a shabby man beside a shabby child, and yet the shabbiness had fallen from him, the shabbiness of little, suburban make-believes. He had discovered a sudden and helpful frankness. He had undressed his soul before his boy. They sat and talked. \"I'm not going to bother about the crease in my trousers, my son. Keeping up appearances. I don't care what the job is, but I am going to get it.\" The thing that astonished him was the way that the boy understood. How was it that he understood? It was almost womanish, a kind of tenderness, and yet manly, as he had known manliness at its best during the war. \"It was because of me,—pater.\" \"Captain Sorrell, M.C.\" \"But you will still be Captain Sorrell, M.C., to me, daddy. If you swept the streets{{bar|2}}\" \"Honour bright?\" \"Honour bright.\" Sorrell held Kit's head against his shoulder. \"Seems to me, kid, that you and I have got to know each other as we never did before. Thanks to poor old Verity. I was so damned afraid that you were going to be ashamed of me{{bar|2}}\" The boy smiled. {{nop}} -13 \"Dear old pater,—I'll help.\" \"Think of that poor old portmanteau! What its feeling must have been—when it burst open! But I have been burst open to-day, Kit. You have had a look at the inside of me. Yesterday—I was a sort of shabby gentleman. That's finished.\" Christopher meditated some profound thought. \"I don't mind—just bread and butter.\" \"No jam?\" \"No.\" \"Well, somehow—I think it was worth it,\" said Sorrell, \"quite worth it. You and I know where we are.\" The sunset was dying behind them, and the dusk and the shadows of the great trees seemed to meet upon the water. The Sorrells left the seat and wandered away together, united by a sudden understanding of each other and by a sympathy that was frank and tender. \"I am always going to tell you things, Kit; no more make-believe.\" \"And I'll tell you things too, pater,\" said the boy—\"everything.\" \"No secrets?\" \"No secrets.\" It was the beginning of the great comradeship between them, and for the first time for many months Sorrell felt a happiness that surprised him. The shock of the day's disappointment had passed. The human relationship suddenly realized between his boy and himself swallowed up the sense of defeat. His courage returned. As they wandered in the dusk of the Close under the darkening trees he felt Kit's nearness, a nearness of spirit as well as of body. \"If I had not had the boy{{bar|2}}\" he thought. Kit's hand touched his sleeve. \"Look{{bar|2}}\" They had turned into a stone flagged path that ran at the backs of the old houses on one side of the Market Square. Gravestones and brick tombs showed between them and the houses. A high yew hedge screened many of the lower windows, but Kits eyes were fixed upon a broad, arched window that was visible beyond the hedge. The window was brilliantly lit, and glowed with streaks -14 of colour, orange, green, blue, cerise. A figure in black was moving amid the streaks of colour. \"What's that?\" the boy asked. Sorrell smiled. They were looking across the old graves into the window of a Staunton modiste's showroom, and it would seem that the modiste had received a consignment of silk \"jumpers.\" She was unpacking them and hanging them up on the stands in her showroom where they glowed brilliantly like jewels in a case. \"Clothes,—Kit.\" \"They look like bunches of flowers,\" said the boy. They passed on, and out by an iron gate into one of the Staunton streets, and so back to Fletcher's Lane, where Sorrell sat and smoked while Christopher undressed and went to bed, port sat there for a long while after the boy had fallen asleep. \"Yes,—there's my job,\" he reflected. Undressing very quietly so as not to wake his son, he slipped into the bed beside the boy and lay wondering how he would solve the problems of the morrow. -15 {{ph|class=chapter|II}} {{anchor|Section 1}}{{ph|class=section|1}} {{di|W}}HEN Sorrell placed two rashers of bacon on Christopher's plate he found himself reflecting that he and his son were eating this meal on credit, and that unless some sort of job was to be discovered in Staunton he might have to visit the sign of the three golden balls. At the end of the meal he lit his pipe and glanced down the list of the advertisements in a copy of the ''Staunton Argus.'' Someone was advertising for a chauffeur; a farmer needed a cowman, and a number of ladies were asking for cooks and housemaids, but Sorrell had to recognize his own limitations. He could not drive a car, or milk a cow, or cook a dinner. Indeed, when he came to consider the question there were very few things that he could do. Before the war he had sat at a desk and helped to conduct a business, but the business had died in 1917, and deny a business man his office chair and he becomes that most helpless of mortals—a gentleman of enforced leisure. At the top right hand corner of the page Sorrell noticed a paragraph that might have some bearing on his case. It appeared that there was a private Employment Agency in Staunton, conducted by a Miss Hargreaves at No. 13, the High Street. Sorrell tore off the corner of the paper, slipped the notice into his waistcoat pocket, and passed the rest of the paper across the table to Christopher. \"I am going out.\" The boy understood. \"I'll be here when you come back.\" No. 13 proved to be a stationer's shop, one half of its window brilliant with the wrappers of cheap novels. Its doorway looked across the road into the arched entry of the \"Angel\" yard, and Miss Hargreaves, from the moment when she pulled up her blind in the morning or pulled it down at night, lived in the gilded presence of the inn's -16 angelic figurehead. Sorrell entered the shop. It was long and rambling and dark, and on dull days a light was needed in the far corner where the circulating library lived in a tall recess. There were no customers in the shop, and the young woman behind the counter, turning a pair of myopic eyes on Sorrell, moved instinctively towards where the daily papers were kept. ''\"Daily Mail?\"'' That was the sound she expected Sorrell to make, but he surprised her by uttering other words. \"I believe you run an employment agency.\" \"Yes,\" said the girl, \"that's so.\" She glanced in the direction of a kind of desk or cage at the back of the shop where a woman's head was visible. \"You had better see Miss Hargreaves—there.\" As Sorrell approached the desk Miss Hargreaves raised her head, showing him the face of a woman of five and forty. She was thin and wiry, with brown eyes of a hungry hardness, and her nose marked out a little red triangle with its congested lip and network of minute blood-vessels. \"Good morning.\" He was a stranger, and to this woman all strange men were interesting, yet as Sorrell looked into her brown eyes he felt himself growing inarticulate. \"I want to consult you{{bar|2}}\" \"You are wanting a servant?\" \"No,—that fact is{{bar|2}}\" But at this moment they were interrupted by the rush of a vital presence into the shop, something highly scented and with a suggestion of the soft friction of silks. Its movements were large and easy and swift, and bringing with them a sense of disturbing and adventurous liveness. It was at Sorrell's elbow, compelling him to glance over his shoulder. He saw the mass of tawny hair, the broad and handsome face, the red mouth, the blue of the eyes. There was something brutal in the face, a vivacity, a sensual energy. He felt as though a gust of wind had blown into the dark shop, and that this large, blonde creature was stifling his courage, overlaying it as though it were a feeble infant. He turned to the cage, only to find that Miss Hargreaves was all eyes for the newcomer. The thin woman was smiling. Her face suggested some inward excitement. {{nop}} -17 \"Morning,—Flo—dear{{bar|2}}. How are you?\" \"Do I look ill?\" There was some element of sympathy between these two women, contrasts though they were, but the lady of the tawny head was studying Sorrell. She stood aside, leaning easily against the wainscoting, her blue knitted coat vivid against the old brown wood. \"This gentleman—first. Mine's not business.\" Sorrell wished her with the devil. He felt her eyes upon him, and had he followed the line of least resistance he would have bolted from the shop. To stand there and blurt out his shabby business while she embarrassed him and made him acutely self-conscious! \"Damn!\" he thought, \"haven't I decided to plunge?\" Miss Hargreaves was fingering the leaves of a ledger, and waiting upon his silence. \"You said you wished to engage{{bar|2}}\" \"I want a situation.\" \"Oh{{bar|2}}? For yourself? I'm sorry,—but,—only domestic service—you know.\" \"Of course,\" said Sorrell, stiff as a frightened cat, \"that's what I mean; a place as valet, or footman or something of that sort.\" He felt that the two women despised him, especially that big, blonde creature with her blueness and her hard world-wise eyes. Why couldn't she clear out and leave him to the thin woman in the cage? Miss Hargreaves pretended to glance through the entries in her ledger. \"I'm afraid I have nothing of that sort,—nothing at all.\" \"I see.\" \"Why not try the Labour Exchange?\" \"I might. Thank you. Sorry to have troubled you. Good morning.\" He turned abruptly, his back to the blonde—woman and made for the doorway. He noticed how the worn boards of the floor squeaked under his feet, an uncomfortable sound caused by a discomfited man. He arrived at the doorway. A voice reached after him like a restraining hand. \"Hallo—one moment{{bar|2}}\" Sorrell turned in the doorway, and saw the blonde woman sailing down the shop, and he stood aside to let her pass, -18 thinking that his necessity was no concern of hers, but she paused by a revolving stand of picture postcards, and taking one at random, gave Sorrell the full stare of her blue eyes. \"Serious?\" she asked. He looked at her rather blankly. \"I beg your pardon{{bar|2}}\" Her smile puzzled him. \"Well,—if you are—come across to the 'Angel' in a quarter of an hour. There's a job—vacant.\" She passed out, almost brushing against him, and he watched her cross the road and enter the arched gateway of the Angel Inn. She turned to the left towards a doorway, but she did not look back, and he wondered why she had left him with a feeling of having been crushed against a wall. She had suggested immense strength, a brutal and laughing vitality. Sorrell went back suddenly into the shop, and along its dark length to the woman in the cage. \"Excuse me—would you mind telling me{{bar|2}}?\" She caught his meaning. \"That's Mrs. Palfrey; she runs the 'Angel.{{' \"}} \"Oh. Have you any idea{{bar|2}}?\" Miss Hargreaves looked at him queerly. \"They want an odd man—for the luggage and the boots and things{{bar|2}}\" He stared at her thin face. \"Well,—why didn't you{{bar|2}}?\" \"Because I didn't know,\" she said tartly. \"If it is any use to you—well—there it is.\" {{anchor|Section 2}}{{ph|class=section|2}} Sorrell stood on the footway and looked across at the Angel Inn. The exterior of the building pleased him. It had the creamy whiteness of last year's paint, and a well proportioned cornice that threw a definite shadow. The window sashes were painted maroon, and from the centre of the façade an old iron balcony projected like the poop of a ship. The gilded angel appeared to have floated from off this balcony, and there could be not doubt as to the rightness -19 of the angel's political opinions. She was a solid Tory angel who had pointed the way heavenwards to generations of Staunton crowds, carrying with her the eloquence of many triumphant Tory orators. Sorrell's glance travelled towards the arched entry by which coaches and carriages had entered and left the inn in the old days. Above this entry a fine semi-circular window overhung the footwalk, two tall Ionic pillars, painted white, supporting it. Sorrell noticed that the curtains were of green taffeta. The window was fitted with window boxes, but the flowers in the boxes were dead. He strolled up the street, across the Market Square and into the Close. He was undecided. He had glanced for a moment at the shuttered windows of Mr. Verity's shop, only to realize how rapid had been the drop in his expectations. Odd man at a provincial pub! Assuredly he was landing with a bump at the very bottom of the social precipice. He sat down on the seat and watched the swans, casual and stately creatures gliding as they pleased. \"Well,—anyway,\" he reflected, \"if one starts at the bottom one has the satisfaction of feeling that one cannot drop any farther.\" He thought of Christopher. \"I said I would get a job. Any kind of job may be a ladder—to push the boy up. Or if he can climb up off my shoulders{{bar|2}}?\" He rose and walked back to the Angel Inn, and turning in at the arched entry, found a doorway on his left that led into a broad passage. He was to learn to know that passage very well, and to hate it and its slippery oil-cloth, and the stairs that went up from it into the darkness. A lounge enlarged itself on the right, the windows looking into the courtyard; and opening from the other side of the lounge were the office, the passage to the kitchen, the \"Cubby Hole,\" and the back entrance to the \"bar\"! Sorrell paused in the passage, with his back to a map of the surrounding country. Two or three visitors were seated in the lounge, smoking and reading the daily papers. A ruddy woman in a leather coat was turning over the pages of a Michelin guide. Sorrell noticed that the tables in the lounge had an uncared-for look. Tobacco ash and used matches littered the trays. There were the marks of glasses. -20 The chair nearest him needed the hands of an upholsterer. Moreover, the place had a distinctive and stuffy smell. Sorrell approached the office window, and as he did so a man appeared at the doorway of the \"Cubby Hole.\" His suffused and injected eyes sighted Sorrell. \"Good morning, sir.\" \"Good morning,\" said Sorrell. The man was in his shirt sleeves, unshaven, and his close-cropped head glistened white between his heavy shoulders; in fact his head seemed attached directly to his broad, short body without the interposition of a neck. His shortness made his bulk more evident, and even the effort of speaking appeared to render him short of breath, for Sorrell saw the labouring of the ballooned waistcoat. The man was not old, and yet he made Sorrell think of some poor, obese, mangy old god with bleared eyes and panting flanks. \"What can I do for you, sir?\" His bluffness had a certain pathos. He appeared the master, a hearty, loud voiced creature, and he was nothing but an obedient sot. \"Mrs. Palfrey told me to call. It's about{{bar|2}}.\" \"About what{{bar|2}}?\" \"She is needing a man.\" \"Oh,—ah,—that's it.\" The brain behind the blotched face functioned very slowly, nor did the suffused blue eyes express any emotion. They did not change their look of solemn obfuscation. The man moved to the door on which \"The Cubby Hole\" was painted in black letters. He opened it. \"Flo.\" \"Hallo.\" \"Someone to see you, a fellow after Tom's place.\" \"Show him in.\" As Sorrell responded to the gesture of a fat hand he divined the fact that this poor, rotten shell of a man—the bruised and swollen fruit—was Florence Palfrey's husband. {{anchor|Section 3}}{{ph|class=section|3}} He closed the door and stood by it, holding his hat in his hand. It was a darkish room, with one window looking out upon a yard, and beneath the window ran a long sofa -21 full of crimson coloured cushions. The woman was sitting on the sofa fiddling with some piece of needlework. She did not tell Sorrell to sit down. \"Well, what's your trouble been?\" she asked abruptly. He answered her with equal abruptness. \"Is that any business of yours?\" Her eyes seemed to take in his thinness, the black and whiteness of his rather solemn face with its little moustache and neatly brushed black hair. His quick reaction to her insolence did not displease her. \"Do you want this job?\" she asked. \"That depends{{bar|2}}.\" \"On your pride, my lad. Gentleman and ex-officer and all that!\" She pretended to fiddle with her needlework, and he looked down at her and met her occasional and baffling glances. He could not make her out. Her immense vitality, the brutal glow of her handsome strength made him feel like an'inexperienced and shy boy. Why had she told him to come to her? Was it pity, good nature? \"I want work,\" he said. \"Married?\" \"No. But I have got a boy.\" She gave him a comprehending stare. \"What made you come to Staunton?\" \"I had a berth offered me. At Verity's. I came down yesterday. He was dead.\" She reflected for a moment, her head bent over her work. \"Rather a comedown for you.\" \"That's my affair.\" He had a feeling that she was amused at finding a mancreature in the corner of her cage. \"What about references, a character?\" \"I could get you references from the Ex-Officers' Association. My name is Sorrell, Captain Sorrell.\" \"You will have to drop the 'captain.' Temporary, I suppose?\" \"Yes. And what is the job?\" She dallied over revealing the details of the post he was to fill, as though it piqued her to discover at her leisure how much mauling the man-thing could bear. {{nop}} -22 \"Of course—you are pretty raw. The thing is—you won't be able to put on side. A man who cleans the boots in my house doesn't put on side.\" \"Point No. 1,\" he said, \"I clean the boots.\" \"And carry up luggage.\" \"Yes.\" \"And keep an eye on the yard and the garage. By the way,—know anything of billiards?\" \"I play.\" \"Then you know how to mark. Then—there is the 'Bar.' You will have to scrub that out every morning, and give a hand sometimes with the drinks.\" \"Right.\" She felt him growing stiffer with the swallowing of each detail. His pale face confronted her with an air of defiance. With each scratch of the claw he forced himself to a grimmer rigidity. He refused to wince. \"Anything else?\" \"Oh,—any odd job I may want done.\" \"Yes.\" \"And you will call me 'madam.{{' \"}} She gave him a stare, and in it was a brutal curiosity. He was like a slave in the arena, down in the sand, and she was wondering whether he would cry for mercy. \"Very well, madam. And may I ask—what I get out of the job?\" \"Thirty bob a week—and your keep.\" \"Is that all?\" \"Tips. Don't forget the tips. If a man's obliging{{bar|2}}\" She gave an indescribable twitch of the shoulders. \"It's a posh job—in the right place. You'll live in—of course.\" Sorrell stood fingering his hat. \"And what about my boy?\" \"I'm not engaging a boy. We don't have children here. You can board him out somewhere, and he can go to school. How old?\" \"Eleven.\" \"Very well; it's up to you, Sorrell. I can fill this place ten times over in half an hour.\" She saw the white teeth under the little black moustache, and she understood how he was feeling. He hated her. -23 He could have struck her in the face, and his suppressed passion gave her the sort of emotion that she found pleasurable. She liked using her claws on men, driving them to various exasperations, and not for a long time had she had such a victim. \"I'll take it,\" he said. \"When shall I start?\" She had turned on the sofa to place a finger on the push of an electric bell. Sorrell heard the distant \"burr\" of it. She sat as though waiting for someone in order to keep him waiting. \"What did you say?\" Her manner was offhand. \"I asked you—madam—when I should start?\" \"Right away. I'll give you an hour to fix up that kid of yours.\" \"Thank you,\" he said, and opened the door to go. But she called him back as her husband entered the room. \"I've taken this man on. He is going to fetch his things.\" Mr. Palfrey, stertorous and staring, was nothing but a fat figure of consent. \"Right, my dear.\" \"That's all, Sorrell. Be back in an hour.\" It took Sorrell five minutes to reach the upper room of the house in Fletcher's Lane, and he found Christopher at the window looking out upon the world of Staunton's roofs. \"I have got a job, Kit.\" The boy gave him that happy, radiant smile. \"I am glad, pater. What is it?\" Sorrell took one of the first steps towards the greater courage. \"I'm porter at the Angel Hotel.\" -24 {{ph|class=chapter|III}} {{anchor|Section 1}}{{ph|class=section|1}} {{di|I}}T took Stephen Sorrell the best part of a week to understand the \"atmosphere\" of the Angel Inn at Staunton. It was a little world in itself, a world dominated by that woman of blood and of brass, Florence Palfrey. The other humans were little, furtive figures, scuttling up and down passages and in and out of rooms. There were the two waitresses, the cook, the two chambermaids, and the apathetic young lady who helped in the bar. Poor, besotted John Palfrey, waddling about like a pathetic yet repulsive old dog, a creature of wind and of nothingness, was a voice and nothing more. He was perpetually fuddled. His hands trembled; his swollen waistcoat was never properly buttoned; even his gossipings in the \"Cubby Hole\" were like the blunderings of a brainless animal. Sometimes Sorrell found him in tears. \"What is it, sir?\" \"I've lost—my slippers{{bar|2}}. It's that damned pup—again.\" \"Who cares{{bar|2}}? I'm—I'm asking you? Not a blessed—soul{{bar|2}}\" Sorrell would find his slippers for him, or his pipe, though he could not dry the poor creature's silly tears. There were times when he himself was on the edge of tears, tears of rage or of exhaustion. He went to bed each night, worn out in mind and in body, so tired that he would lie awake and listen to the cathedral clock, or to the noises of his own body. The work was new to him; he was on the go from morning to night; the luggage pulled him to pieces. Moreover, the food was execrable, and those slovenly meals snatched anyhow and at any time in the slimy kitchen, -25 turned sour in his tired stomach. Very often he was in pain. But the thing that astonished him was the dirtiness of the place. From the street the Angel suggested cleanliness and comfort; the paint was fresh, the dcor-step white, but an observant eye might have noticed the dead flowers in the window boxes. Within, a cynical slovenliness prevailed. It was not safe to look under the carpets, or to reflect upon the blankets hidden by the treacherously clean sheets. There were places that smelt. As for the kitchen, and that awful dark and greasy hole where the dishes were washed, they made Sorrell wonder at the innocence of the people who ran their cars into the Angel yard and ate the Angel dinner, and slept in the Angel beds. The place had a sly filthiness. It was like a wench in silk stockings and lace whose ablutions were of the scantiest. Yet there was money in the \"house.\" Trade was good; Florence Palfrey never gave you the impression that she had to deny herself anything. She was brazen, voracious, insatiable, an animal with bowels full of fire. It was she who made out the bills, and in most of them there was some flagrant item against which the easy English visitor should have protested. In nine cases out of ten they remained mute, and paid. Florence Palfrey knew her world. She bluffed. She chanced the protest, knowing that people would pay and go away and grumble and forget. She knew the world's moral cowardice, its inertia. Sorrell soon realized that the Angel as an hotel did not matter. The coffee-room, the commercial-room, the bedrooms were of no importance; what mattered was the bar. Men came to booze. In fact the \"Cubby Hole\" of the Angel Inn was a pivot, a fly-trap, a cave into which all sorts of male things crowded, and drank, and made silly noises and sillier laughter, and looked with lustful eyes at Florence Palfrey. At night the room would be full of them, and even in the daytime it was rare for the room beside the bar to be empty. This cavity had a secret, conspiratorial air. The men who sneaked into it dreamed of catching old Palfrey's wife in a mood of consent, and of exciting moments among the red cushions. The \"Cubby Hole\" filled Sorrell with nausea. {{nop}} -26 He began to know the names and the faces and the callings of the men who drifted into it. There was Romer—the managing clerk of Spens and Waterlove, a polite person with restless brown eyes and an unpleasant tongue. He had an amazing collection of stories. Biles, who owned the big butcher's shop in High Street, would slip in with his red, greasy and furtive face, and would spill silly compliments from his coarse lips. Sadler the \"vet\" went away each night stiffly drunk, moving like a figure on wires, his eyes fierce in his thin and debauched face. But there were dozens of them, farmers, tradesmen, commercial travellers, young bloods, all slinking in like dogs, drinking, and lounging and lusting. \"The fools{{bar|2}}!\" Sorrell called them fools, and his scorn of them was part of his own pain. He had to mark for some of them in the billiard room, to listen to their dirty stories, to fetch them drinks. It was their amusement, and his torture, for often he was drooping with fatigue and boredom, and yearning for the fools to go to bed. And he would hear the laughter in the \"Cubby Hole,\" and the splurgings of these tradesmen who made love like bullocks. \"Floe—on thou shining river.\" That was Medlum's jest, Medlum who kept the bookshop and sold prayer-books and Bibles and pretty-pretty art tourist guides, and who had a wife and seven children. He was a sandy man who looked as though he had been dipped in a bleaching vat, all save his mouth which was thin and red and lascivious. They spent much money. They would send poor old Palfrey up to bed, bemused, shuffling in his slippers, grabbing at the handrail. Often Sorrell would have to help John Palfrey up the stairs, listening to his pantings and to his fuddled confidences. \"She don't care—not a damn. I've got water in me{{bar|2}}. I'm like a grape, Steve. What did the doctor call it? Ass-i-tis{{bar|2}}. Wish I were dead.\" He would pause at the top of the stairs, panting, and staring solemnly at Sorrell. \"You mark my words{{bar|2}}. A coffin—in six months, I'm asking you{{bar|2}}. Who cares{{bar|2}}?\" He would weep. {{nop}} -27 \"You're a good chap,—Steve. Don't know why. God,—I feel sick.\" There were other things that Sorrell began to understand. Women came to the \"Cubby Hole\"; Miss Hargreaves from across the way, red nosed, excited, ready with thin, hard giggles; the lady who kept the fruit shop and who looked like an over-ripe plum, and who was always protesting that she could not bear to be tickled. \"I'll scream.\" These earthly souls soon ceased to puzzle him, but the woman of brass remained an enigma. She bullied these people, even when she treated them with brutal good-humour. She knew exactly how to handle each fool-man, and how to repulse some flushed face that was breathing too near to hers. There were times when Sorrell felt that she despised the whole crowd as much as he did. And since a man must wonder, he went in pursuit of her motives. Did her huge vitality suck something from her herd of swine? Was it money? Did it cause poor Palfrey to disobey his doctor's orders and to shuffle nearer to the inevitable coffin? She was shrewd, like a strong and cunning animal. She never lost her dignity, or allowed the amorous clowns to take liberties. \"I have seen something like her before,\" he thought. \"Where{{bar|2}}?\" One wet night he remembered. The den was full of her Circe troop, and Sorrell, going in with a tray of glasses, saw her sitting on the sofa and looking over the heads of her adorers. Yes, he remembered. He had seen a lioness at the London Zoo, couched, and looking just like that, savagely and superbly indifferent. He could remember the way the tawny beast's eyes had looked over the heads of the humans fidgeting and chattering outside the railings, those tame people, those monkeys. The lioness, couched up above, eyes fixed upon some distance of her own, had ignored them. But she met Sorrell's eyes, and a sudden glitter came into them. He was closing and locking the hotel door when he heard her calling him. \"Stephen.\" He went to the door of the den. She was sitting on the -28 sofa, yawning, and with the naturalness of a fine animal. \"What damned fools!\" She looked at him, and picked up a cigarette from the table. \"I want a match.\" He produced a box, and striking a match, held it for her to light her cigarette. She blew smoke. Her eyes lifted suddenly, and he saw the big black pupils and the vivid blue of each iris. \"You looked fagged.\" \"It's the end of the day.\" \"You ought to get off more. You work too hard.\" Sorrell's eye dropped. \"If I could get out for an hour—after tea. There's my boy; I don't see much of him{{bar|2}}\" Instantly he was aware of the fact that he had offended her. \"O—your boy! What's he doing?\" \"Going to school.\" \"The Council school?\" \"Well, it's that—or{{bar|2}}\" \"A summons. All right,—clear out for an hour each day. Have you locked up?\" \"Yes, madam.\" He had a glimpse of her profile as he passed the door on his way to the stairs. She was smoking and looking at and through the wall opposite her. The corner of her mouth was drawn down and she was frowning. {{anchor|Section 2}}{{ph|class=section|2}} Sorrell had particular moments in the day when life was worth living. One of the moments was when he got to his attic at night, and counted up the day's tips and entered the amount in a little black note-book; the other moment of happiness came to him with a daily glimpse of the clean, frank face of his boy. Kit would come to the arched entry, and Sorrell would meet him there, and Kit would see his father in the old, familiar blue serge suit grown more shiny and less neatly creased about the trousers. There were times when Sorrell wore an apron, but he contrived to appear before Christopher -29 minus the apron. His pride allowed itself this little satisfaction. They would stand together for five minutes beside one of the white Ionic pillars supporting the bow window of the dining-room, the boy looking up into his father's face. He was an observant child, and his love for Sorrell had undergone a transfiguration. Christopher noticed changes in his father's face; it looked more waxy; there were little wrinkles as of a troublesome knot of effort lying between the eyebrows. Sorrell was thinner; he stooped more. But Sorrell's eyes smiled. \"How's she feeding you, son?\" Christopher had no complaint to make of the food that Mrs. Barter gave him at No. 13 Fletcher's Lane. She was a good woman. \"She's been mending my shirts, pater.\" \"Ha,\" said Sorrell, \"has she!\"—and glanced at the boy's suit. Yes, that fresh face contrasted with the shabby clothes. \"Time I took you to the tailor, my lad. I think I can manage it next week.\" Christopher could not analyse all that lay behind his father's eyes, but he felt the warmth of the love in them. He noticed that his father's eyes had a filminess, a veiled and secret delight, a moment of deep dreaming. They were the eyes of a man who was thirsty, and to whom the boy brought pure, clean water. Christopher refreshed him. His candid eyes and the brown warmth of his clear skin were unblemished fruit after the rottenness of those squashed and purple souls, those men who made Sorrell think of faces trodden on by an ever-passing crowd of sordid and unclean thoughts. His boy had youth, a future, possibilities; he was the sun in the east. And poor Palfrey! \"My God!\" Sorrell thought; \"one must hold on to something, even if it is nothing but a clean shirt and a piece of soap.\" Christopher never asked questions, awkward and embarrassing questions. He accepted his father's job, and he understood the significance of it far more subtly than Sorrell knew. It reacted on the boy, and deepened his sensitive seriousness. {{nop}} -30 At school he was very careful of his clothes. He did not say much about the school. It was all right. Better than London. What did he do in the evenings? O,—went for walks, mostly. There were woods outside the town, and the river. Those few minutes were very precious to Sorrell, but they tantalized him. His boy was so apart from him all through the day, and whenever they met he would look eagerly at that frankly radiant face for the shadow of any possible blemish. He felt so responsible, greedily responsible. The boy's clean eyes made the life at the Angel possible. On one occasion when he had walked a little way along the footpath with Christopher he became aware of a face at a window. The woman was watching them. He caught her bold, considering eyes fixed on the boy. He went back rather hurriedly into the passage, and met her there. \"That your kid, Stephen?\" \"Yes, madam.\" \"He's not a bit like you. The mother's dead, I suppose?\" \"I divorced her,\" said Sorrell, pale and stiff about the lips. Usually, it was about eleven at night when he went slowly up the narrow staircase to the top landing where the staff slept. He carried a candle. Sometimes he would hear giggling and chattering in one of the girls' rooms, but he always went straight to his own, shut the door, put the candlestick on the chair, sat down on the bed and turned out his pockets. At this hour he did his precious calculations. His little black note-book was a model of neatness, with credit and debit entries. {| |July 7. |{{ditto|July}} 7. |{{ditto|July}} 8. |{{ditto|July}} 9. |{{ditto|July}} 10. |{{ditto|July}} 11. |{{ditto|July}} 12. |{{ditto|July}} 13. |- |Credit |Wages £1 10 0 |Tips{{gap}}4 6 |{{ditto|Tips}}{{gap}}3 0 |{{ditto|Tips}}{{gap}}{{gap}}0 |{{ditto|Tips}}{{gap}}7 0 |{{ditto|Tips}}{{gap}}5 6 |{{ditto|Tips}}{{gap}}1 0 |{{ditto|Tips}}{{gap}}9 0 |- |Christopher—Board £1 0 0 |Tobacco {{gap}} 2 0 |Tooth brush {{gap}} 1 0 |Christopher—Boots 1 0 0 |} -31 He found that his tips averaged about twenty-five shillings a week. He paid Mrs. Barter a pound a week for Christopher's keep. He spent a few odd shillings on himself. He was contriving to save about a pound a week. £52 a year? If his health held out? Already he had a plan for his boy, an objective that showed like a distant light through the fog of the day's confusion. \"It's my business to do my job thoroughly,\" he thought, \"in order to get Kit a better one. I'll save every damned penny.\" Life, the life that should have appealed to the cruder of his own appetites, had ceased to attract him, and all his energy appeared to concentrate itself and to flow in one particular channel. He developed a peculiar passion for thoroughness, even though he might curse the inanimate things upon which he had to exercise this thoroughness. Queerly enough, much of his thinking and his philosophizing were done while he was cleaning the various pairs of boots and shoes left outside the bedroom doors. He did not mind this job,—though scrubbing the bar floor made his gorge rise. It was like cleaning out a pen where unclean animals had left their ordure. But boots{{bar|2}}! Boots had character. He got into the way of estimating the owners of the boots by their footgear. He had a preference for neat brown shoes, gentlemen's shoes, and his favourites came in for more polish. Young women's shoes—were they ever so chic—gave him no thrills. The boots he detested were the boots worn by a particular type of middle-aged commercial traveller, men who trod heavily and whose waistcoats bulged. He never put a hand inside one of these \"swine's trotters\" as he called them. But with a free hour each day snatched from the Lioness's rather jealous paws, Sorrell began to see more of Christopher. He took his hour off from eight till nine, for he had found that too many motorists arrived after tea and he was not there to handle the luggage and to carry it up from the garage. He wished to be in evidence because is subsequent tips. But in these long summer evenings he and Christopher wandered together; sometimes they chose the Close, on other evenings they wandered out a little way into the country; if it was wet Mrs. Barter let -32 them sit in her parlour. She was kind to Sorrell; she offered to do his mending for him. Christopher loved trees. There was a particular elm in the Close, a green giant with a ring seat round its bole, under which the boy liked to sit. Nor was Sorrell sorry to sit. It conserved boot leather, and rested his tired feet. Kit had noticed on their short country rambles that his father walked as though his feet hurt him. He had noticed—too—that one of the boots was patched. \"Your turn next—pater?\" \"What for, son?\" \"Boots,\" said the boy. He had fatherly moments towards Sorrell. He too had his plans, vague ambitions, and impulse that pushed him towards some magnificent job in the doing of which he would earn much money. He had sensed the effort in his father's life; he dreamed of taking his share of the effort. \"I can start work at fifteen, pater.\" Sorrell was astonished. \"I hope not,\" he said, and glancing from the boy's face to the spreading branches of the elm he saw life and its effort symbolized. \"Most people grow like cabbages. Look at this tree. How many years—eh? O,—it was not in a hurry. We—are not going to be in a hurry.\" The boy's eyes were questioning. \"Not as long as that{{bar|2}} With you—sweating—and doing everything{{bar|2}}\" \"It's my job, Kit.\" He looked mysterious. \"I've got plans. The thing is{{bar|2}}Well, you don't know yet,—what you will want to do—I mean. No blind alleys, or office stools.\" \"You mean—dad—what I would like to be?\" \"That's it.\" \"Seems—one's got to earn money.\" \"Wait a bit. There's something better: how you earn it. The real job matters more than the money.\" \"Yes,\" said Christopher very solemnly, \"the sort of thing you love doing. Well,—I suppose I shall find out.\" -33 {{ph|class=chapter|IV}} {{anchor|Section 1}}{{ph|class=section|1}} {{di|A}}N incident that occurred about five weeks after Sorrell's arrival at the Angel startled him into a sudden aliveness towards the drift of other people's temperamental whimsies. It was early in the morning, before the paying part of the hotel had descended to his breakfast, and Sorrell was down on his knees in the lounge cleaning Be the spilt contents of one of the ash trays. Someone had knocked it off the table the previous night. The two waitresses were busy in the coffee-room, and one of them, a little sallow girl, with a shock of black, bobbed hair, running out towards the kitchen with a serviette over her arm, saw Sorrell kneeling. He had had glances from the girl; she was always passing him in the passage, but Sorrell was too tired for life's little thrills. He had forgotten the fact that he might be attractive to women. Anyhow, the girl slipped the napkin over Sorrell's eyes,—and drawing it tight, bent down till her mop of black hair touched his head. \"Guess who it is{{bar|2}}?\" She giggled, but before Sorrell had made any effort to free himself, the napkin was whisked away, and he had a glimpse of Millie's slim legs disappearing urgently down the passage leading to the kitchen. Some one had come down the stairs, and was passing behind him, and glancing round, he saw Florence Palfrey going towards the office. It was the most trivial of incidents, a mere piece of hoydenish mischief, but when the staff of the Angel sat down to its midday meal Sorrell realized that the little dark girl was not present. \"What's become of Millie?\" The other waitress gave him a sour look. \"You—ought to know.\" \"But I don't know.\" {{nop}} -34 \"She—sacked her.\" \"What for?\" \"Romping.\" Not much was said, though it was obvious that the other girls felt themselves injured by the peremptory ejection of a comrade, but they were afraid of the Lioness, and they mistrusted Sorrell—the man. He became aware of the mistrust; it made him uncomfortable; moreover he had felt a sudden, sordid tremor of fear. That which had happened to Millie might happen to him, and he knew that for the boy's sake such a thing must not happen. The keenness of his own anxiety was a humiliation, and he accepted the humiliation, explaining it to himself quite frankly as though he were explaining the wearing of a shabby suit of clothes. He was alarmed at the possibility of his being pushed out into the street, of losing his thirty shillings, his keep, and his tips. Yet this fear shocked him. That a man should be afraid of being evicted from such a caravanserie! He had not realized how much the Angel Inn had become his \"straw,\" and that he was ready to cling to it with the instinctive terror of a man who feared the unknown. That afternoon he spent himself in a passion of activity. He went about eagerly looking for work. He made work. He attacked the various slovenliness of the place. He was aware of the constant nearness of the woman. She—too—appeared to be in a restless and active mood. She kept coming out of the office of the \"Cubby Hole,\" going out or up the stairs and returning. She saw Sorrell in all sorts of postures and places, on his knees polishing the \"surround\" of the lounge, cleaning the glass panels of the doors, carrying out the aspidistras and washing them in the yard. She had one particular glimpse of him doubled up under the big walnut table in the passage, but what he was doing there she did not pretend to know. Though she passed him a dozen times that afternoon she neither spoke to him nor appeared to look in his direction, but each of them was conscious of the other. The feline intuition of the woman divined Sorrell's fear. He was like some busy thing in a cage; propitiatory, eagerly turning a -35 wheel. Also, she knew that he was cursing her, himself, and his activities. Captain Sorrell, M.C.! She was moved to brutal laughter, but her laughter was silent. There were thoughts in her too that purred. She had Sorrell on his knees, and she could tell him to get up or remain there, to come or go. And there were inclinations in her that were whetted by her sense of power. \"Damn the woman! Is she going to{{bar|2}}?\" He had a queer feeling that her passings and repassings were not haphazard. They concerned him. She took notice of him by ignoring him; her seeming indifference had an intimate and veiled significance. He had carried in a pair of steps and was polishing one of the big mirrors in the lounge. He saw himself in it, his anxious, sallow face, the sweep of the hand carrying the wash-leather. He threw silent abuse at his own reflection, that sedulously active and worried creature. \"You wretched failure,—you grovelling idiot! Rushing about to create a good impression{{bar|2}}\" Suddenly, he saw her figure drift into the mirror. She was standing behind him, looking at him. He fancied that he detected amusement in her eyes, the kind of amusement a lioness might be expected to enjoy if a lioness had a sense of humour. \"Very busy to-day,—Stephen.\" \"Yes, madam.\" He went on with his polishing, believing that he was going to hear about the silly incident of the morning. He waited. She stood and watched him for fully a minute, and he felt the back of his neck and his ears all flushed. Confound her! What did she want? Why didn't she go away, or stick her claws into him and have done with it? He reached up to a far corner of the glass, and when next he searched for her reflection, he found that she had gone. He was conscious of relief, but the sense of relief was only partial. He felt her somewhere. Where? The door of the \"Cubby Hole\" was wide open, and he could see a part of the interior reflected in the mirror, a strip of green carpet, a red cushion, part of the frame and glass of the window. She was in there, sitting on the sofa, -36 watching him. He saw the gleam of her hair, and two eyes, very dark, like the eyes of a creature watching him from the gloom of a wood. He fancied that she smiled. He tried to concentrate his senses upon the mere glassy surface of the mirror, and to keep his vision and its accompanying thoughts from passing through to the deeps of it where the woman was, but he could not help focusing her. She remained there, watching him, enigmatic, motionless, like a great tawny cat. Sorrell decided to leave the mirror. He came down the steps, and was folding them up when he heard her voice. \"Stephen{{bar|2}}\" \"Yes, madam.\" \"There is a glass in here. It hasn't been touched since—since{{bar|2}}\" She laughed as he stood in the doorway with the steps and bucket. \"Since Adam and Eve.\" Sorrell obeyed her with an air of great briskness. The mirror was over the mantelpiece, a gilt-framed thing of the \"Regency\" period, and when he got on the steps he found that the top of the frame was black with dust. Florence Palfrey had picked up a paper that had been lying on the sofa, but instead of reading it she fanned herself with it, for the day was hot. \"Anyone in the lounge?\" \"No.\" Sorrell came down the steps to dip his leather in the bucket. \"Very warm to-day.\" She did not reply, but watched him get to work, and his movements told her that he was nervous. She was satisfied in a part of herself. And then she began to talk to him with an air of casual intimacy, and in a way that she had never talked before. He was both Captain Sorrell, and M.C., and her \"boots\" and porter. \"Rather different from the war, Stephen.\" He agreed. He felt strangely alert. \"How did you get your M.C.?\" \"I didn't know{{bar|2}}\" \"Oh,—I know most things. Well? How?\" \"Oh, in a trench raid.\" {{nop}} -37 \"Were you raiding the others?\" \"No, madam, the others were raiding us.\" He was working hard at the mirror, with his back to her, and somehow he felt that he had to keep a distance, though he could not analyse the feeling. \"Well,—what happened? Don't be so dashed modest.\" \"The Germans came into our trench.\" \"Yes.\" \"And they stuck some of our chaps. It's a nasty tool, the bayonet. And there was a bit of a panic. I was in a deuce of a funk.\" \"That's funny!\" \"It wasn't at all funny. But something seemed to go off inside me—and I saw red.\" She nodded her head. She was considering him, eyes half closed and fiercely languid. \"So you can see red. Well,—I shouldn't have thought it. It's rather—interesting. You must have been stronger then.\" \"I was. But it's not mere beef{{bar|2}}\" \"No. Not bullock's strength. Wounded—I suppose?\" \"Twice.\" \"Badly?\" \"A bit of H. E. in the chest—the second time. I had to come home—after that.\" He both felt and heard the rustling of the paper as she fanned herself, a disturbing sound, like the rustling of leaves or lace. He had finished cleaning the mirror, and he came down the steps rather hurriedly, folded them up, and grabbed the bucket. \"Anything else, madam?\" She observed him steadily above the rustling paper. \"No. You are an odd fish, Stephen.\" He stared, and she laughed. \"Odd as odd. Go and see if you can find anything else to polish.\" {{anchor|Section 2}}{{ph|class=section|2}} From that day Sorrell began to perceive Florence Palfrey more and more vividly as the tawny creature, the lioness -38 who had him shut up in her cage. She did not say much, but she managed to convey to him the impression that he was dependent on her, and that she had but to raise a paw{{bar|2}}. Her way of dealing with him was both subtle and simple; it mingled moments of provocation and of caressing cruelty with sudden flashes of naked intimacy. Her badness was so unclothed at times that it frightened him. For Sorrell was thinking of the boy, and his thoughts turned to escape from any entanglement, a shabby affair with a woman who was both elemental and cynical. He did not want it. He was tired of life as a merely personal adventure, and when this thing loomed over him he realized that he was living vicariously, and that the very roots of the will to live drew their sustenance from the youth of his boy. He was frightened. For he had a most absurd feeling that he was being kept and fed and played with in order to be devoured. He divined her ruthlessness, her ferocity, her stealthy, amused strength. For some reason he had piqued her, and he wondered why. Was she intrigued by the fact that he was a gentleman handling luggage and cleaning boots? Or had the obvious man, the blatant, butcherly people who stormed into her den ceased to pique her? He could imagine a lioness being bored and looking about her for some new sort of victim. Moreover, Sorrell was helping poor old Palfrey up to bed, and though Florence Palfrey's husband might be no thing of loveliness, the very act of helping a man begets a sense of comradeship. John Palfrey was derelict; no one bothered about him now; he might shout feebly down the stairs with that husky voice of his, and no one would take any notice. \"Hallo,—hot water,—shaving water{{bar|2}}\" On more than one occasion Sorrell found him standing on the landing in his old blue dressing-gown, weeping. \"I—want—my breakfast.\" He had it in his bedroom, and it was Sorrell who took upon himself the duty of carrying up poor Palfrey's shaving water and his breakfast tray, for in Palfrey he saw the husk of a man, a man who had been devoured. {{nop}} -39 \"You're a good chap, Steve. I'm of no account now. Who cares?\" \"I do, sir.\" Palfrey made a sudden clutch at his arm. \"Don't you ever marry, Steve; don't you ever let a woman get you. She'll eat you up.\" And Sorrell understood. It happened one evening when he had helped the dying man to bed that Sorrell found Florence on the landing outside the door. The landing was badly lit, and she was standing by the stairs with one hand on the rail as though in the act of pausing. She was in low-necked dress of black, with her arms bare to the shoulders. Sorrell still had his hand on the handle of John Palfrey's door. Her sudden presence there agitated him; he felt that he had to get by her quickly and go downstairs. He could smell the particular scent she used. He walked towards her,—and remaining where she was she closed the stairs to him unless he should push rudely past close to the wall. \"Put him to bed, have you?\" She looked Sorrell full in the eyes as though her stare could beat down any independence that was in him. \"He won't last long now.\" Her tone was callously significant. It was as though she was trying to convey to him her appreciation of his soft-heartedness, to humour something childish in him, even while she conspired with him as to the future. O, well, she could lie sleekly in her cage and wait for this odd fish who boasted a sort of absurd integrity of his own. Sorrell felt shocked. Something flamed in him; he could have struck her, thrown her down the stairs, with furious abuse, but behind her he seemed to see the face of his boy. \"It is pretty rotten for a man{{bar|2}}\" he said. He felt ashamed before her. His eyes looked over into the well of the stairs, and then—with an abrupt and awkward \"Excuse me,\" he pushed past her and went below. He felt that he needed air, to be alone somewhere under the stars, and daring the desertion of his post he went out into the High Street, and along it into the Market Square. The place was deserted. He saw a great yellow moon hanging in the tops of the elms, and beside it the blackness of -40 the cathedral towers. He walked up and down, hatless, and in his shirt sleeves. He felt that he wanted to rush round to Fletcher's Lane, and catch up Christopher and hold him. \"The one clean thing left to me,\" he thought. His lips made a movement as of spitting. \"Good God! That a man should be left to die like that,—like a piece of rotting meat in a corner! If I should have to die like that? Damn her{{bar|2}}!\" He was in a fever to escape,—but how? Necessity held him chained. If he broke the chain and plunged? He was saving money, just a little money, and if he could win a breathing space he might have time to look about him. It was the boy who mattered. If he the man—surrendered—and allowed himself to be cajoled and to be devoured{{bar|2}}? But why this niceness? How easy it would be for him{{bar|2}}. She had hinted so broadly. But his soul's exclamation was a \"Pah!\" To step into that poor sot's shoes, and to be pushed eventually over the edge of all decencies when the feline creature was tired of him. No. He struggled. The nature of the struggle was vague and elemental, and he did not visualize it as one of those primitive crises in a man's life when something that is stronger than his mere appetites pushes him a step higher up the precipice. He clung to a prejudice, and to the one human thing that mattered. He was not going down into the dubious muck, and to feel himself smeared with it when he met the eyes of his boy. \"Damn her,\" he said, \"I'll fight through,\" and he went back to the hotel with his eyes staring as they had stared at horrible moments during the war. {{anchor|Section 3}}{{ph|class=section|3}} Sorrell's frenzy of activity continued. It seemed as though he were trying to lose himself in a desperate combat with the multifarious slovenliness of the Angel Inn, to hide himself in the dust cloud of his own energy. He was never still. He ran round and round in his cage, sweeping, polishing, tidying, carrying things. His indefatigable activity itself even upon the loungers in the \"Cubby Hole.\" {{nop}} -41 \"That chaps of yours seems full of juice, Flo.\" \"Well,—why not? He doesn't belong to a Trade Union.\" \"Queer sort of beggar. Looks as though he thought your pub wanted a wash.\" \"That's not unlikely.\" \"Oh,—I say! That's a bit thick. Hallo, Bob, old bean. Crush in here. What's yours?\" In this vulgar world Sorrell's nausea became too chronic and too real. He began to be afraid of his meals, and to wake at night with a knotted pain under his ribs. He thought of going to see a doctor, but it was not a doctor that he needed, and he knew it, but he did arrive at the more economical expedient of slipping into a chemist's shop. There were no other customers, and Sorrell made his confession across trays of soap and washing gloves and tooth-brushes. \"I've got indigestion. Can you give me something?\" The chemist was a colourless little man with thin and peculiarly compressed lips. \"Pain after meals?\" \"Yes.\" \"How long?\" \"Oh, it varies.\" He met the man's scrutinizing eyes. \"Looks as though you wanted a tonic. Run down. I'll give you something.\" Sorrell sacrificed a precious three and ninepence for a bottle of tonic and some tablets. \"Help you to get rid of the wind, you know.\" The stuff did him no good, for he was worried, and overworking himself, and eating bad food and rushing about after he had eaten it. The constant pain and the discomfort began to depress him; he felt less and less of a man, and more and more of a sick animal in a cage. He had mocds of melancholic apathy when a voice within him played tempter, saying—\"What's the use? You are a failure. Even your wretched body is a failure. Why not give in, slide, go down the shoot? After all, what is the fuss about? A woman and a boy and an adventure that most men would laugh at? You're a fool.\" Kit saw a change in his father. Sorrell's eyes looked strained, and the whites of them were muddy; he stooped -42 more, and appeared uneasy when he was sitting on the seat under the elm. A discouraged figure. And yet Christopher did not like to ask questions. \"The work makes you rather tired, pater.\" \"Oh,—a bit. I shall get used to it.\" \"Couldn't there be—something else?\" \"I've got a plan,\" said Sorrell. He was always talking about that plan. The more difficult it seemed of attainment the more obsessed was he by the contemplation of it. His plan was like a hypothetical sun invisible during the greater part of an English summer, but there, and liable to shine some day next year. He forced himself to appear confident before the boy, for he realized that Christopher was the only living person who believed in him, and he wanted Christopher to go on believing in him, especially when he was in danger of ceasing to believe in himself. It was suggestion, the dear—trusting stimulus of youth. One day he was sick, and he went about with a face all pinched and the colour of cream, making himself do things. He was tidying up a disorder of papers in the commercial room when the woman glided in. \"You don't look well, Stephen.\" There was a seductive kindness in her voice, and he mumbled something about his dinner not having agreed with him. \"You fuss too much,\" she said. He went on tidying the papers, feeling that her presence radiated a false sunlight. \"You—might—do much less—if you cared, you odd fish.\" He understood her. \"It's my job,\" he said. \"As you please.\" When she left him he sat down in one of the chairs, and held his head in his hands.' -43 {{ph|class=chapter|V}} {{anchor|Section 1}}{{ph|class=section|1}} {{di|S}}ORRELL was leaning against one of the white Ionic pillars that supported the bow window when the claret-coloured car drew up outside the Angel Hotel. The car was a two-seater, and in it sat a man wearing a grey suit and a soft grey hat. He was very brown. He beckoned to Sorrell. \"Any rooms here?\" \"Yes, sir.\" The quality of Sorrell's voice surprised the man, and he showed his surprise by looking at Sorrell for half a second longer than was necessary. \"Right. The car won't be in the way here?\" \"No, sir. Would you care to go straight into the garage?\" \"Presently,\" said the man. He climbed out and stood on the pavement, glancing up at the windows of the hotel. He appeared to be about Sorrell's age, one of those square men, but not too square, with a fresh brown skin, blue eyes, and a firm but human mouth. He moved easily, and you gathered from his steady eyes and his rather measured movements that he was a deliberate person, no great talker, a man with courage, but one who never rushed at life haphazard. There was something about the man that attracted Sorrell, his freshness, his obvious strength, the calm way his eyes looked at you and then gave you a sudden and pleasant smile. Sorrell had known one or two such men in the war. They had made good soldiers. The man entered the hatel, and Sorrell remained by the car. He liked the colour of it, and the compact brightness of the dash-board, and the neatly covered leather hood. He himself would have liked to possess such a car, but he did not grudge the man in grey the possession of it. {{nop}} -44 Sorrell heard the pleasant and deliberate voice at his elbow. \"All right. I'll drive in.\" From the way the newcomer looked about him in the Angel yard, Sorrell divined his disapproval. Nor did Sorrell approve of the yard. \"No lock ups?\" \"No, sir.\" \"I want an inner tube mending.\" \"I'll take it round to a garage for you, sir. Luggage in the dicky?\" \"Yes.\" Sorrell extracted the luggage, a massive leather kit-bag, a suitcase, and an attache case. \"Do you know the number of your room, sir?\" \"Fifteen.\" The visitor paused at the office window to sign his name in the registration book, while Sorrell carried the luggage upstairs. No. 15 was no better and no worse than the average bedroom at the Angel, and though Sorrell had grown accustomed to the rooms, there were moments when he appreciated their depressing casualness. He unfastened the straps of the kit-bag, and went downstairs, to find the visitor talking to Mrs. Palfrey, and Sorrell came by the impression that it was the woman who had begun the conversation. He turned to Sorrell. \"Which way?\" \"This way, sir. First floor, second room on the left.\" The man disappeared up the stairs, and Sorrell glanced at the visitors' book. \"Thomas Roland. London.\" The handwriting was like the man, broad and deliberate and without affectation. Five minutes later Sorrell, who was rearranging the magazines and papers in the lounge, fancied that he heard a bell ringing with aggressive persistency. It was an upstairs bell, and on going to investigate he found Mr. Roland standing outside the door of No. 15. \"Isn't there a maid on duty?\" \"There should be, sir.\" {{nop}} -45 \"I have no towels and no soap, and no one has brought me any hot water.\" \"Sorry, sir.\" \"And look here—at this.\" Sorrell looked, and gave a little lift of the shoulders. \"These confounded wenches{{bar|2}}. I'll see to it myself, sir.\" He went out on to the landing calling \"Maggie—Maggie,\" but no Maggie materialized, for she was somewhere below at one of the many back doors, and busy with the other sex, so Sorrell went to the chambermaid's closet, and collected towels and hot water, and purloined a new cake of soap from another bedroom my. Mr. Roland was unpacking his kit-bag, and had thrown a pair of orange and blue striped pyjamas on the bed. \"Thanks.\" That was all he said, but he smiled at Sorrell and gave him one of those quietly observant glances, and Sorrell went below feeling warmed by something pleasant and human and wholesome in the man. He wondered who Thomas Roland was, and what he did. Meanwhile, Roland had paused in his unpacking, and was sitting on the bed and examining the room as though it interested him. Its deficiencies, its perfunctory slipshodness interested him. He happened to be interested in rooms, and he was a man of detail. His mental comments followed immediately upon his visual perceptions. \"No wardrobe. Now—where the devil? Faded green paint,—dirty paper—strings of pink roses between black and white lines. One hook off door. Carpet—h'm—, I wonder what a vacuum cleaner would fetch out of it. Brass bed, one knob missing. Yellow chest of drawers, one handle missing.\" He got up. \"I bet the drawers stick, and that the paper inside them is last year's ''Daily Mail.\"'' He was right. His observations ran on. \"Swing mirror plugged into place with a wad of paper. Blind torn. Japanese mats on floor need burning. Slop pail -46 minus a handle. Marble top of wash-hand stand stained. Tooth glass smeary. Over washing-stand advertisement of Jeyes' Fluid. Over mantelpiece—tariff and advertisement of local tradesmen. Sheets need mending. Blankets,—yes,—just so!\" He resumed his unpacking and his meditations, — \"How many of these places have I stayed in during the last month? A dozen—I suppose. And only one decently run place in the dozen. Slovenly holes, especially in these cathedral places. Here's a great opportunity under the noses of our inn-keepers, and all they seem to think of is the booze and the 'bar'!\" He put out his boots. \"The cheek of them—too. Give you every sort of slovenliness and inattention, and bad food, and then charge you top prices. Now take this place. Nobody seems to care a damn, except that porter chap. No supervision, no discipline, no conscience.\" His sponge-bag was extracted from a brightly polished cavalry mess tin, the two halves of which found receptacles for his sponge, washing gloves, nail-brush and tooth-brush. He glanced at the cracked sponge-basin belonging to the inn. \"No thanks! Obviously—no. Now—if that tow-headed female downstairs did her job properly instead of{{bar|2}}. O, well, that's the curse of these places; a lot of soaking fools, and yellow-headed women. But what I never can understand is—why—if people take on a job—they can't do it properly. And yet—not three in ten can. Socialism! What rot!\" He lit a cigarette and looked out of the window into a back yard that contained the rotting relics of an old brougham, a pile of bottles, and a derelict dog-kennel. \"Cheerful prospect! I wonder what that porter fellow is doing here? Queer chap. Takes trouble, but looks ill. A gentleman's voice—and eyes. Does his job.\" It was five o'clock, and Mr. Roland went downstairs into the lounge, and rang for the waitress, for he desired tea. He had to ring twice before a girl appeared as though the oeing in the world she was expected to do was to answer a bell. \"Tea, please.\" \"For one?\" {{nop}} -47 \"For one.\" She went away, and Mr. Roland waited twenty minutes, and when the tea tray did arrive he noticed that the girl had forgotten to fill the milk jug. \"I take milk with my tea.\" She whisked the jug away. Sorrell was tucking letters under the tapes on the green letter-board, and he happened to turn and catch Mr. Roland's eye. A faint, sympathetic and understanding smile seemed to pass between them. \"You haven't forgotten that tube?\" \"No, sir. It has been done. I put it in the dicky.\" \"Did you pay?\" \"Yes, sir. Two shillings.\" \"Thanks.\" A two-shilling piece passed from Roland's hand to Sorrell's, and again their eyes met and smiled. Sorrell felt cheered, though he had no great reason for feeling cheered. He went upstairs to No. 15, possessed himself of Mr. Roland's brown shoes, two pairs of them, and cleaned them as they had not been cleaned for a month. {{anchor|Section 2}}{{ph|class=section|2}} Dinner was late. Roland was chatting in the lounge with a big and genial person who had grown suddenly testy with hunger. The genial man was asking his casual acquaintance to explain to him how it was that a certain stereotyped piece of work that was done day by day could not be made to keep pace with the clock. \"We abuse machines,—but hang it all—they have rhythm.\" Roland laughed softly. \"Well,—I don't suppose it will be anything great when it does come. And I think I could give you the menu.\" \"Guessing?\" \"No, the law of averages. We shall begin with tomato soup, go on to tough chops—boiled potatoes and cabbage, pass thence to fruit salad, tinned apricots and stewed prunes. And we shall finish with rather bad cheese.\" \"I don't care what it is,\" said the testy man. \"I feel inclined to go and hammer that gong.\" {{nop}} -48 The gong sounded at ten minutes to eight, and Roland, strolling into the dining-room, saw the usual number of small tables arranged under the window and along the wall. Each table had a cruet stand from which most of the plating had long ago been worn away, and a vase of perfunctory flowers. A long table occupied the centre of the room. Roland waited for the waitress, his pose that of the interested observer. \"One, sir?\" \"Please.\" The waitress indicated the long table, and Roland smiled. \"I prefer a table to myself.\" \"We have only tables for two or four, sir.\" \"Are all these tables reserved?\" \"No.\" He smiled again. \"If I can get a bedroom for one—I suppose I can get a table. You don't put me in a dormitory—thank you.\" He was one of those unusual men who not only thought of things to say, but actually said them, and said them with a smile. He was given his table. \"Have you a menu card?\" \"No, sir.\" \"What are we going to have?\" \"Tomato soup. Roast beef and veg. Fruit salad.\" Roland caught the eye of the testy man who was unfolding his napkin at the next table. \"I gave you the menu. There is only one alteration.\" \"What's that?\" \"Roast beef instead of chops.\" \"Ah{{bar|2}}!\" \"And 'veg.' A vague and comprehensive word that—veg.\" Wandering out afterwards in the cool of the summer evening under a tumultuous yet quiet sky Roland saw the great trees of the Close all edged with gold. He passed in, and stood looking at the cathedral's western façade, the magnificent window recessed between two towers, the arcades and niches, and all that grey and delicate silence in stone. The lawns, like rich old velvet, sheltered by the trees, and -49 refreshed by the mists from the moat of the palace, were vividly green in spite of the heat of the past week. Roland could see the gilded cupola and the clock above the Tudor gateway of the palace. He strolled upwards along the canons' gardens, pausing to look in through the old gateways, and his chance strollings brought him to the great elm where a man and a boy were sitting. Sorrell had been talking to Christopher of Thomas Roland, though he himself was puzzled by the impulse that moved him to speak to the boy of a man who was a mere passing stranger. But he let the impulse have its way, and the spread of it had surprised him. \"So I cleaned his shoes, my son, put such a polish on them.\" Kit had noticed a sort of shine in his father's eyes. \"Strange—how your heart and your hand go out to some people. He made me suddenly feel good, and smooth. I knew that I could do anything for him, and that he would never ask me to do anything dirty. Instinct. He looks as though he had come straight out from swimming in the sea, when it's all blue and the sun makes a glare on the yellow sand.\" Roland recognized Sorrell before Sorrell was aware of his nearness, for Sorrell was leaning forward with his hands clasped between his knees, and his eyes on the ground. Roland went towards them, and Sorrell, sensing a presence, looked up, startled but smiling. \"Your boy?\" \"Yes, sir. This is Mr. Roland, Christopher.\" Kit stood up and lifted his cap, and he and Mr. Roland took a steady look at each other. \"Are you at the Angel?\" \"No,—I have him boarded out,\" said Sorrell; \"we get an hour together—when I'm off duty.\" \"So you get an hour!\" \"Yes.\" Sorrell was looking at Roland's shoes. He was wondering whether the other man had noticed the polish that had been put on their comrades in No. 15. Roland sat down on the seat, and laid a big brown hand on Kit's shoulder. \"Sit down, old chap.\" He filled a pipe. \"Pretty peaceful here. Do you ever go to any of the services down there?\" {{nop}} -50 \"Not often.\" \"I've been,\" said Kit. \"If you want to be alone—when the organ is playing.\" Roland made a slow movement of the head. \"I know. Service; a full choir, half a dozen priests, three lonely women, a verger and a forest of empty chairs. And the organ notes quaking, and a boy's voice soaring up to the grey roof like a bird. Perhaps a few spectators cee at the west end of the nave. It always makes me fee queer.\" Kit was watching him with solemn eyes. \"Queer? How?\" \"Oh,—as though I had fallen suddenly through a trapdoor into another world. Not our world. Men saw the sunset through trees in those days. I suppose they looked at the stars. Do you ever look at the stars?\" His eyes were on Sorrell. \"No,—hardly ever. Never thought about it.\" \"Quite so.\" \"Too busy or too tired, and under a roof. I used to look at them a lot in the trenches.\" \"Ah,—you were there too,\" said Roland, lighting his ipe. And when he had lit it he got up, stood a moment, smiled at the Sorrells, and tilted his head slightly in the direction of the moat where the water was dappled with gold. \"Think I'll wander down there. They still keep the swans—I suppose?\" \"And there are two peacocks, sir.\" \"In the bishop's garden. I remember. So—like us—they survived the war. Good night.\" The Sorrells watched him go down the path to the water, holding himself very square and straight, and yet moving with an air of lightness. \"I like that man,\" said the boy, \"he's—he's{{bar|2}}\" Kit searched for some particular word. \"How do you call it, pater, when you feel right up close against someone you've never met before?\" \"Sympathy?\" \"No, not quite that. I can't get it.\" \"I think I know what you mean,\" said his father. -51 {{anchor|Section 3}}{{ph|class=section|3}} On the first floor of the Angel Inn, and at the end of a dark passage there was a little, dim drawing-room, musty and sad, with engravings of Landseer's pictures on the walls, and a Kidderminster carpet on the floor. On the hearth, behind the brass fender, stood a cheap Japanese screen in black and gold, the centre piece between a mock-mahogany coal purdonium on the one hand, and an occasional table on the other. The wallpaper displayed faded pink roses blooming a strangely detached way on a dull grey background. There were a few books on an octagonal table, a Dunlop guide, bound copies of the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' twenty years old, Tennyson's poems and a Latin grammar. How the Latin grammar had got there—heaven alone knows, but it remained there because no one troubled to remove it. A gilt clock that had not ticked since Queen Victoria died, escaped the dust by standing on the white marble mantelpiece under a glass case. Two bronze gentlemen on horseback, mailed and armed, menaced each other from opposite ends of the mantelpiece. The armchairs were of that bastard breed in which each wooden arm bears an excrescence of padding covered tightly' with a material that is reminiscent of a footman's breeches sixty years ago. People rarely entered this room. The windows remained closed, and it lived shut up in its own dark mustiness. Occasionally some lone woman sat in it, and knitted, and looked at the books and put them back again, but the women who sat in this room had no men attached to them. Any man chancing to open the door, looked in, stared, and, feeling the room's unwedded deadness, fled. No one ever left the door of this room open. They closed it carefully, as though the room's emptiness were best sealed up. Sorrell was coming down the stairs when he heard strange sounds drifting from the dark passage. There was a piano in the drawing-room and someone was playing it, and playing it extraordinarily well, feelingly, and with a strong, rich touch. Sorrell paused. Music, such music was so unknown in this haphazard house that he felt like a man -52 in a factory yard who suddenly hears a blackbird singing. It gave him a moment of exquisite pain. He stood with quivering throat, and a sense of strange and deep emotion stirring in him. The pianist was playing Chopin. He or she was in the midst of the First Prelude when Sorrell first paused to listen. Then came the Berceuse, and after the Étude in A. Flat. Sorrell, leaning against the wall, felt his memories going back to the days of his youth when he had sat and dreamed in Queen's Hall. Romance. Those days when he had imagined{{bar|2}} But who was the pianist? A car with two or three women in it had arrived an hour ago, and Sorrell had carried up their luggage, but these ladies had suggested rag-time rather than Chopin. He felt curious. He approached the drawing-room door, telling himself that it would be easy for him to enter the room as though in search of some visitor. He could wait for an interlude. Leaning against the wall opposite the door, he let the surge of those sweet sounds go through him. A pause came. He was about to slip across the passage when the door opened. It was Mr. Roland who opened the door. His face had a kind of radiance, a happy rapture. \"Hallo!\" Sorrell had straightened up. \"Sorry, sir. I was listening. Was it you?\" \"Yes.\" The two men looked at each other, and the light on Thomas Roland's face seemed to have spread to Sorrell's. They were together for a moment in a transcendental world of mystic sounds and symbols. And life was drawing them nearer. -53 {{ph|class=chapter|VI}} {{anchor|Section 1}}{{ph|class=section|1}} {{di|T}}HOMAS ROLAND was a man of observation, and yet he was more than a mere observer, and he saw much more than he seemed to see. He registered atmospheres. That was the musical part of him. The practical part of him would sit comfortably in a chair behind a book, and watch without appearing to watch, and his tranquil solidity was so deceptive that his neighbours saw nothing but a man and a book. His interest in life might be catholic, but it was also fastidious and very quick to seize upon an arrestive figure or an intriguing situation. He had intended staying two days in Staunton, but his two days enlarged themselves into a week. He was interested in Stephen Sorrell, both as a practical man and as a psychologist, and he became interested in Sorrell's entanglement. When he sat in a corner of the lounge and watched, he could not help being struck by the "
