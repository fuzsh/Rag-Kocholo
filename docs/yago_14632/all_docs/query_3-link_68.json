Ermoliev / Tobis. <b>Charpin</b> as Jolivet in the French sound film <i>Michel Strogoff</i> (Jacques de Baroncelli, Richard Eichberg, 1936). Caption: A film based on the famous novel by Jules Verne.\n\t\n\tHeavy-set French character actor and singer <b>Fernand Charpin</b> (1887-1944) was known as Charpin. His most famous role was Panisse, the wealthy widower who marries Fanny, in Marcel Pagnol's Marseille trilogy. He had a busy but relatively short career in the cinema.\n\t\n\tFernand Charpin was born in 1887 in Marseille, France. He was the son of a gendarme. He grew up in Venelles, a village near Aix-en-Provence where his father was employed. He was attracted to acting very early on. He went to Paris to take lessons at the Conservatoire national supérieur d'art dramatique (CNSAD). After his education, he became one of the permanent values ​​of the Théâtre de l'Odéon. In 1928 he played the leading role in the comedy 'Chotard et Cie'. One day Marcel Pagnol went to watch Charpin's acting performance on the advice of his friend Raimu. After all, he was looking for a second actor (like Raimu) with a somewhat plump build, a candid natural way of acting, and the 'accent du Midi' for his new play 'Marius'.  Charpin was approved and Marius achieved resounding success. This was followed by 'Fanny', the second part of what would become the Marseille trilogy.\n\t\n\tFrenand Charpin also made his film debut as Honoré Panisse in the film adaptation, Marius (Alexander Korda, 1931) starring Raimu and Pierre Fresnay, and returned as Panisse in the sequels Fanny (Marc Allégret, 1933) and César (Marcel Pagnol, 1936). During the same period, Jean Renoir directed him in Chotard et Cie/Chotard and Company (1933), the film adaptation of the comedy that was Charpin's breakthrough. Charpin's film career was launched. Pagnol, who had become friends with Charpin, also directed him in the comedies Le Gendre de monsieur Poirier (Marcel Pagnol, 1933) and Le Schpountz (Marcel Pagnol, 1938), and in the tragicomedies La Femme du boulanger (Marcel Pagnol, 1938) and La Fille du puisatier (Marcel Pagnol, 1940) with Raimu. Charpin appeared seven times on the film set with his counterpart Raimu, but also appeared eight times alongside the young Fernandel. In addition to his film work for Marcel Pagnol, Charpin has also appeared in several film adaptations of work by Alphonse Daudet, another literary fellow from the region: the drama Sapho (Léonce Perret, 1934), the comedy Tartarin de Tarascon (1934) where he again played alongside Raimu, who played the title role and the dramas Le Petit Chose/The Little Thing  (Maurice Cloche, 1938) and L'Arlésienne/The girl from Arles (Marc Allégret, 1942). Charpin played soldiers and policemen of all ranks. He also appeared in civil authoritative positions such as investigating judge, mayor (three times), principal of school, and pastor. He repeatedly played business manager (traders, grocers, hoteliers, innkeepers, shopkeepers) and well-meaning father figures. Julien Duvivier cast him twice: in the drama La Belle Équipe/They Were Five (1936), Charpin was a gendarme and in the crime film Pépé le Moko (1937) he was a snitch, a very atypical role for him. In 1913, Charpin had married actress Gabrielle Doulcet. Their marriage was childless. In 1944, Charpin died from heart failure in Paris. He was 57.\n\t\n\tSources: Wikipedia (English and Duitch), and IMDb.\n\t\n\tFor more postcards, a bio and clips check out our blog <a href=\"http://filmstarpostcards.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">European Film Star Postcards</a>.",
