        "text": "A tiny creature possessed of a power disproportionate to its size, or to its significance in the hierarchy of creation, figures in folktales the world over. It is sometimes a cricket or a mouse. In the folklore of France, it is une piaf, the argot for sparrow. Edith Piaf ’s tremendous voice surged from a stunted body. She considered herself hopelessly ugly, yet her rag-doll features had the same radiance that her sound did. It came, in part, from the friction between raw grief and joy which produced her vibrato. She planted her feet at a microphone as if it were a stake or a mast and she was about to be either burned at it or swept away. Destitution was her great theme, and she knew it in all its guises, so she never withheld. Her mouth and eyes dramatized her weary defiance of life’s blows, but with her mothlike hands, which flickered or swooned or seemed to be caressing her own breasts, she let go.\n\nPiaf is probably the best-known and best-loved popular singer in French history, and one of the few to become a household name in America. She made ten concert tours of the United States, appeared eight times on “The Ed Sullivan Show,” and twice played Carnegie Hall. Her records sold forty million copies in her lifetime, and she composed many of her own lyrics, including those to “Hymne à l’Amour” and “La Vie en Rose,” which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998. “She is an inimitable genius,” Jean Cocteau wrote. “There has never been an Edith Piaf before, and there will never be another.”\n\nCocteau also wrote “Le Bel Indifférent,” a play for and about Piaf and an atypical lover, the patrician aesthete Paul Meurisse (whose part was entirely mute). Piaf’s affairs were legion, and she generally preferred roguish he-men who would rough her up a little, although she roughed them up in her own fashion, and she once threw a party for all the ex-“Mr. Piaf’s” willing to attend—a crowded roomful. The tumultuous melodrama of her unprivate life has been chronicled in scores of biographies and films, which tend to be as unreliable as their subject’s autobiographies. There was, however, one fact that no one could embroider or dispute, least of all Piaf. “I’ve had an irresistible need to destroy myself,” she said, shortly before she died, in 1963, at the age of forty-seven, ravaged by malnutrition, alcoholism, morphine addiction, ulcers, tuberculosis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and, ultimately, cancer. It was the year of the Beatles’ first LP.\n\nMy seventh-grade French teacher at a Queens public school, M. Swirsky, was among Piaf’s most ardent fans on this side of the Atlantic. The boys laughed at his Friday ritual of donning a beret to signify that Piaf Hour, our weekly sing-along to one of his cherished albums, had arrived. We couldn’t have understood what those gritty and wanton love songs really meant, and they probably wouldn’t now be judged edifying for twelve-year-olds. But Piaf herself was the size of a twelve-year-old—about four feet eight inches—and she never outgrew a child’s magical thinking, or a wayward adolescent’s bravado.\n\nPiaf Hour included a diction lesson. Her native language was the harsh nasal vulgate of the Paris slums, but the clarity of her musical phrasing was the model that M. Swirsky drilled into us, just as one of her early Pygmalions, the impresario and lyricist Raymond Asso, had drilled it into her, and as she drilled it into Yves Montand, Eddie Constantine, Gilbert Bécaud, Georges Moustaki, and Charles Aznavour, among countless protégés, most of them her consorts. “Je n’suis qu’une . . . ombre de la rue,” she sings in “Milord” (“I’m nothing but a backstreet shadow”). It’s the wry sales pitch of a waif beckoning to a lonely British sex tourist, but it’s also a perfect exercise for beginners—even if French labial gymnastics feel vaguely obscene when you’re not used to them. Piaf, who was prone to fits of hysterical laughter, was never embarrassed about making a spectacle of herself in polite company with drunken ebullience or pugnacity, and, as the daughter of an itinerant contortionist, who spent some of her formative years living in her grandmother’s brothel, she must have, by puberty, seen pretty much everything one can do with a mouth. That knowledge is in her voice. Yet its crystalline vibrancy defies the murky pathos of her story.\n\nPiaf was as much a phoenix as a sparrow. She returned after her periodic fugues, car crashes, breakdowns, and operations to sing more soulfully than before. The makers of her latest film biography, “La Vie en Rose,” directed by Olivier Dahan and starring Marion Cotillard, are betting that she can rise again. If they are right, the triumph will belong primarily to Cotillard, who almost persuades you that you are watching Piaf herself. Were she alone on a bare stage, synching not only her lips but her every fibre to Piaf’s, the movie might be a masterpiece rather than a pedestrian saga about a pop star’s rise and fall. It isn’t the fault of the stylish photography, or the cast of virtuosos, including Catherine Allégret (a ringer for her late mother, Simone Signoret), as Piaf’s paternal grandmother, or Gérard Depardieu, as Louis Leplée—the Teddy-bearish homosexual who owned Gerny’s, a voguish cabaret, and who discovered Piaf as a rachitic nineteen-year-old hellion singing on a street corner. But subtle acting can’t save a script that resorts at nearly every turn to a visual cliché: the childhood of picturesque squalor; the picaresque adolescence; the montage of rave reviews rolling off an old-fashioned printing press that gives way to the scene of a trashed hotel suite.\n\nTiming, however, is as critical to a film’s prospects as to a singer’s art, and Dahan’s homage to Piaf opened in France on Valentine’s Day, at an opportune moment. The country was preoccupied with its upcoming Presidential elections, and national identity was a central issue in the campaign, as it has been since the Revolution. For millions of her compatriots, Piaf and her music, la chanson réaliste—a Gallic version of the blues made popular at the turn of the last century by melancholy music-hall artists like Aristide Bruant and Yvette Guilbert—define what it means to be French.\n\nCoasting on a wave of anxious, sentimental nationalism that crossed party lines, Dahan’s film launched a Piaf craze that crossed generational lines. “France loves desperate love songs,” Jean-Pierre Raffarin, a former Prime Minister under Jacques Chirac, who was endorsing Nicolas Sarkozy, told the press, adding that Piaf symbolized the desire of ordinary voters for a return to “real values” and the rejection of “élitism.” The assertion itself is untranslatable to another culture. (Imagine Karl Rove making the same claim for Billie Holiday.) And while none of Sarkozy’s rivals thought to invoke the “real values” of a profligate alcoholic millionaire, nobody demurred.\n\nIn France, a realist tends to be a former romantic mocking his lost illusions but also secretly mourning them. Jacques Brel and Georges Brassens are of that dark school. Like them, Piaf was too worldly and bruised to escape the ironic view that gives her art its depth and modernity, and experience taught her that most love isn’t true. What she steadfastly refuses to renounce is her belief in loving. As for the reality of history or politics, Piaf does not seem to have given them a second thought, despite having entertained French prisoners of war in Nazi Germany (a fact you will not learn from “La Vie en Rose,” which tacks back and forth from Piaf’s death to her birth, in 1915, docking like a cruise ship at various colorful destinations in between, but giving the war years a pass). She is, nonetheless, that quintessential heroine of the Republic—a daughter of the people. No one can belt out “La Marseillaise_”_ as stirringly as she. Her name, figure, accent, and legend—even her backstage hobby, knitting for her men—embody an ideal of heroic-underdog populism sacred to students and bohemians. Everything about Piaf is pungently French, even if (or especially because, depending on your politics) her maternal grandmother, Emma Said ben Mohammed, known as Aïcha, was a Berber from Algeria.\n\nPoised to benefit from the expensive European rollout of Dahan’s movie—the French title is “La Môme” (“The Kid”), Leplée’s stage name for his scruffy prodigy—were a CD of the soundtrack, a fruity new perfume by Balmain, and the publication or reissue of several biographies and memoirs: “A Life Not Always Pink,” by the journalists Philippe Crocq and Jean Mareska; “Piaf, Mon Amie,” by Ginou Richer, her dresser and confidante, with a preface by Aznavour; and the feverish “Vivante,” an unsourced novella-length reverie with literary pretensions by Isabelle Sobelman, who is Dahan’s coscreenwriter. (French resentment of American imperialism, cultural and political, surfaced in both the electoral campaign and the film reviews. Le Monde criticized the movie for being the first Hollywood-style bio-pic by a French director about a contemporary French icon, and “Vivante” was promoted—presumably to the same audience of highbrow patriots—as being “like a biography of Edith Piaf, but not in the American style.”) There was also a sold-out musical, at the Théâtre Marigny, “Piaf, A Life in Pink and Black,” starring Nathalie Lhermitte, who got the audience up and singing; “Moi pour Toi,” an edition of Piaf’s correspondence with the middleweight world boxing champion Marcel Cerdan, her true love; a comic book illustrating her lyrics; and a special Piaf photo supplement to Paris Match.\n\nLegend has it that Edith Giovanna Gassion was born on the pavement, although her birth certificate locates the event in a hospital near her mother’s apartment, on the Rue de Belleville. The neighborhood was then a ramshackle slum in the hilly twentieth arrondissement. When artisans and the working poor were forced out of central Paris, during the Second Empire, many settled in Belleville and its environs. The Paris Commune started there, in March of 1871, and it ended there, that May, with the barricaded citizens mounting the last, most ferocious pocket of resistance to imperial force.\n\nIn Piaf’s youth, when she might have crossed paths with Jane Avril and Django Reinhardt, tenements like hers were a haven for political refugees—Greeks, Armenians, Jews, Spaniards—and they later served as a foothold for immigrants from the former French colonies in Africa and Indochina. With its steep landscape, seething street life, and radical cachet, Belleville has figured like a favela in the city’s mythology, and it still does. It was recently described in the Times as “one of Paris’s most shabbily atmospheric corners.” It’s easy to imagine her, high and wan, in one of the black dresses that seemed to have come from a charity bazaar even when it was signed Dior, arriving late at the clubs with her entourage of minders and enablers, to troll for a new protégé. She came home to be buried—in Père-Lachaise—close to the monuments of the Resistance fighters and deportees who perished in the camps, and to the cemetery wall where the Communard holdouts were shot.\n\nBoth of Piaf’s parents were buskers with immodest dreams. Her father, Louis Gassion—the contortionist—would look for a level spot near a busy corner and unfurl his mat, cajoling pedestrians to ante up before he entertained them. Much of his meagre earnings went to drink, and when Piaf was rich and famous she paid him an allowance—a cash transaction that took place in a café—and hired a valet, partly to keep him clean and fed but also to restrain him from making a nuisance of himself at her stage doors. In 1914, a month after the First World War began, Louis married Piaf’s mother and was sent to the front. He was given a leave to attend Edith’s birth, fifteen months later, but was mysteriously awol when it occurred. “Maybe he missed the train to Paris,” his wife later said bitterly, “but I’ll bet he wasn’t late for happy hour”—la buvette—“at the station bar.”\n\nHappy hour, one infers, was any unhappy hour in the Gassion family, on both sides. Piaf’s mother, Annetta (or Anita) Maillard, made her living as a street singer. Much of her meagre earnings also went to drink, and once she had recovered from labor she left the newborn with her mother. Aïcha’s husband may have owned a circus, perhaps a flea circus (she is described as a “trainer of fleas” by profession, although the expression is ambiguous: it might simply mean a drunk with the D.T.s). Her household, Crocq and Mareska write, was a place where “filth kept company with indigence,” and “a slug of plonk was added to the kid’s bottle, so she’d fall asleep.” When Edith’s father paid a visit on his next leave, he decided that a brothel in the countryside might make a more wholesome environment.\n\nAround 1918, Edith, scabby and skeletal, was taken to Normandy, and became the mascot of a house where Louis’s mother, depending on the source, was either the owner or the cook. This luxurious idyll of regular meals, baths, and affection was abruptly shattered when, with no warning, the child went blind. A doctor diagnosed infections in both corneas. After a few months of treatment, she recovered her sight. Piaf preferred to believe that the pious whores’ fervent prayers to St. Thérèse of Lisieux and a pilgrimage to her shrine effected a miraculous cure. For the rest of her life, she trusted Thérèse to oversee her destiny, though the saint proved to be a capricious patron. The next thunderbolt also fell without warning: Piaf’s hapless father came back to reclaim her. Until she was fourteen, when she struck out on her own, and befriended Simone Berteaut, a thirteen-year-old urchin nicknamed Momone, Edith and her father travelled with a provincial circus, and then lived hand to mouth, sleeping in a cheap hotel when they had a good take and on a park bench when they didn’t. Her singing of the national anthem, they discovered, earned more applause than his contortions.\n\nBy 1935, Piaf and Momone had spent five debauched years bumming around Paris in the company of a thuggish crew. Piaf was performing on the sidewalks and Momone was shilling for her. They told people that they were sisters, and a portion of their earnings went to a pimp. But Piaf never admitted to having prostituted herself, except, perhaps, once: when she needed the money for her daughter’s funeral. Marcelle Dupont, who died at two of meningitis, was the fruit of a brief liaison, at seventeen, with a delivery boy of the same age. The baby, pacified with the same formula that Piaf had once imbibed, often slept in the coat closet of a cabaret, while her mother sang for their supper. When Marcelle fell ill, her father took her away.\n\nLeplée chanced by, three months after Marcelle’s death, and heard Piaf singing in the Rue Troyon, near the Arc de Triomphe. He invited her to audition for him at Gerny’s, then arranged for a well-publicized début before a house full of celebrities, many from the music world. The audience knew the real thing when they heard it, and Maurice Chevalier led the ovation. The Kid was cast as herself in a movie, “La Garçonne,” and in 1936 she recorded her first record, “Les Mômes de la Cloche.” But then, suddenly, her Papa Leplée was dead—murdered for unknown reasons by an unknown intruder. The crime has never been solved, but suspicion fell on one of Piaf’s gangster friends. The press found her guilty by association, even though the police had cleared her, and the animosity of Parisians was so intense—she was hissed off the stage at holes like Au Rat Mort, in Pigalle (the only work she could get)—that she skipped town. She spent about half a year on the road cruising for sailors in ports like Brest or Nice and getting into brawls. What or who brought Piaf to her senses no one knows—perhaps it was St. Thérèse. But she was faithful to only one master: her vocation. With her last few sous, she phoned Leplée’s friend Raymond Asso. “Get in a cab,” he told her. “I’ll pay the fare.” She arrived on his doorstep for what proved to be an indefinite stay. “He taught me to become a human being,” she said.\n\nAsso reckoned that it took him two years, and Piaf that it took him three, to make her, if not quite a lady, an ex-tramp. He was dealing with a cocky savage who found it natural to receive reporters in a stained bathrobe, or to slug back a full glass of wine in a single gulp. Grooming her manners was a greater challenge, according to Crocq and Maleska, than engaging her mind. Fiction and poetry were part of her reëducation (“I’d always thought of reading as a bourgeois thing,” she said), and getting through a Jack London novel was her first achievement. Genius may be innate, but artistry is acquired, and Asso taught Piaf the meaning of rigor. He wrote the earliest of her theme songs, “Mon Légionnaire” (with music by Marguerite Monnot, her longtime collaborator), and choreographed her gestures. They rehearsed until he was satisfied that she knew in her bones what she was singing. If Piaf cheated on Asso the lover, she rewarded Asso the master by becoming a consummate professional—not only as a technician but as a critic who could recognize a great song from the opening bars and help a composer to perfect it. Her own lyrics would be remembered for their dramatic economy even if she hadn’t recorded them. By the time Asso was mobilized, in 1939, and went off to war, their affair was over, but Edith Piaf, no longer La Môme, was ready for stardom. A year later, she made her concert début in Occupied Paris, at Salle Pleyel, one of the city’s most prestigious halls, accompanied by a full orchestra—the first pop diva to play there. “At first I asked myself what the fuck I was doing in that temple of classicism in my head-housekeeper’s dress,” she told a radio audience the next morning. “And then, since people seemed happy to hear me, I was happy, too, and I forgot where I came from.”\n\nPiaf, of course, never really could forget where she came from, and in Marcel Cerdan, “the Moroccan bomber,” she found a soul mate. He was a handsome pig farmer who was emblematic to the French in the way Piaf was, as a working-class hero. They were mutually dazzled by their prowess in different arenas. Here was a man whom she couldn’t dominate, and who wasn’t daunted by her hunger or success, because ferocity only excites a champion. It was as archetypes that they fell in love (he heard her sing, she watched him fight, both from a front row), and the public fell in love with them as a couple—republican royalty. But Cerdan had a wife and children in Casablanca, and his paternal loyalty moved Piaf to renounce any hope of becoming the second Mme. Cerdan. When their schedules kept them apart, as they mostly did, they exchanged rapturously incautious letters. In time, perhaps, his example of self-discipline might have helped her to stop brutalizing herself. But almost two years into their affair—on the night of October 27, 1949—Cerdan was killed in a plane crash over the Azores, on his way to visit Piaf in New York. He had planned to travel by sea, but changed his mind in response to her phone call begging him to fly.\n\nPiaf’s story loses its momentum from this point on. Dahan tries to grapple with its inherent tedium by fragmenting the narrative into flashbacks, but he doesn’t grapple with the problem of a life that ceases to evolve. In 1952, Piaf married Jacques Pills, a singer now forgotten. (Marlene Dietrich, one of the rare women whom Piaf considered a close friend, was her witness. There is a photograph of them before the ceremony, the frizzy-haired bride looking bloated in a pleated dress, and Dietrich, sublimely elegant, kneeling at Piaf’s feet to fix a shoe.) Pills was a decent man and a good drinking companion, but when he discovered Piaf shooting morphine he was in over his head. She never gave up trying to contact Cerdan through the spirit world. Frauds, crackpots, thieves, and parasites—“grotesque puppets,” as Asso put it—feasted on her fortune. Each of her paramours received the regulation starter kit of a gold watch, cufflinks, and a lighter, and was subjected to a regimen of sleepless nights, jealous scenes, career coaching, and betrayal. Money was abstract to her, and she spent it and her health with the same abandon, and the same results—a chronic state of nearbankruptcy. So she had to keep working, and, in addition to her unending tours and recording sessions, she made nine films, including, in 1954, Jean Renoir’s “French Cancan” and Sacha Guitry’s “Si Versailles M’Était Conté,” starring Orson Welles, Gérard Philipe, Brigitte Bardot, and a whole firmament. (Directors cast her to sing; only Cocteau seems to have discerned her talents as a comedian.) She survived a staggering number of automobile accidents, but her sense of futility was probably more lethal than her cars. “For eight days, every evening, two thousand people are the enthusiastic bystanders to a suicide attempt,” a journalist for Libération wrote of a concert series in the late fifties.\n\nLast April, I made an appointment to visit the Musée Edith Piaf, a private shrine on the Rue Crespin-du-Gast, not far from Père-Lachaise. It was created in 1977 by Bernard Marchois, the founder of Piaf’s fan club and the editor of “Opinions Publiques,” an anthology of reminiscences with some of the people who knew her best, including Asso and Marguerite Monnot. Marchois was sixteen when he was introduced to Piaf, in 1958, and she was forty-three. She had collapsed earlier that year on the stage of the Olympia, and her condition was alarming. Louis Barrier, her long-suffering manager, cancelled or postponed her engagements and persuaded her to buy a country villa in the Seine-et-Oise. But without her crew, and, as Crocq and Maleska note, twelve miles from the nearest bar, which closed at eight, she couldn’t take the peace and quiet. Neither Barrier nor her doctors could prevent her from embarking on another road trip. She was practically a corpse when it ended, but in 1961 she met a shy twenty-six-year-old Greek hairdresser from the outskirts of Paris, Théophanis Lamboukas. He was twice her height and as handsome as a god. They married in an Orthodox ceremony, and she willed him to become a singer—Théo Sarapo. Many of her fans and friends considered him a gold digger, but he doted on her, tenderly styling what was left of her hair. Together they performed Michel Emer’s duet, which is Piaf’s credo, “À Quoi Ça Sert l’Amour?” Despite her premature decrepitude—she looked like an old mother defending her devout faith in love to a doubting son—it was her last moment of incandescence.\n\nThe museum is a tiny apartment owned by the Piaf fan club. One of its two rooms is painted red, the other yellow. The furnishings came from the grand Haussmannian apartment on the Boulevard Lannes that she bought with Pills. They include a teal-blue horsehair sofa with fur pillows, a collection of imitation Renaissance pottery, and a mantel clock with a figure of the Marquise de Sévigné, pen in hand. Framed on the walls are a variety of posters and portraits, and several letters. In one, written on her twenty-sixth birthday, Piaf complains of getting old. A black dress with a sweetheart neckline, by the couturier Jacques Heim, is displayed on a mannequin. She wore it onstage with a showy Rosicrucian cross that Dietrich gave her as a wedding present. “I started collecting things while Piaf was alive,” Marchois said, “and later the family and artist friends made donations.” They include her Victrola; some of her custom-made T-straps, in size 4; and a velvet dressing gown that she bought for Georges Moustaki, who wrote “Milord.” An enormous stuffed bear occupies a chair in the corner. “It’s exactly Edith’s height,” Marchois explained. “She loved stuffed animals, and was buried with a rabbit.” Perhaps the most poignant item in this claustrophobic reliquary is a pair of Cerdan’s sparring gloves. “My God, how much I love you,” she wrote to him on May 27, 1949, three weeks before he lost his title match to Jake LaMotta, in Detroit. “I would like to put myself at your knees and spend my time admiring you, serving you, loving you, being nothing but yours and having nothing but you before my eyes.” “What a lucky man I am,” Cerdan told Piaf humbly. “Me, just a brute of a boxer.”\n\nMarchois kept looking at his watch—he had a doctor’s appointment—so he turned off the Piaf CD he was playing, and we said goodbye on the sidewalk. Needing some fresh air, I walked to Père-Lachaise and found the tomb that Piaf shares with her father, her daughter, and Sarapo, who died in a car crash in 1970. The shiny slab of black marble is engraved with the motto “Dieu réunit ceux qui s’aiment,” and it was smothered with fresh roses. A small crowd of twenty or so fans and tourists had gathered. Two of them were a mother and daughter who had seen Dahan’s film and were taking pictures with a cell phone. One was a Swiss teen-ager with a pierced lip. “I’m here because my mother was a Parisienne,” she said, “and she always loved Piaf.” When the others had left, an elderly couple introduced themselves. They told me that they come often, and that “even in the rain there are people here. It has nothing to do with this new film, there was an old one that was better. Most of them are like us. They saw her sing and they just can’t forget her.” ♦"
