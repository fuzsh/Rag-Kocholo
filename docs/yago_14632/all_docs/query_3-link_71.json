        "text": "Great French Historical Production\n\nEPIC of M. VINCENT\n\nThere is something akin to pearl fishing in my o shadow chasing job.\n\nTheatre after theatre yields nothing but oysters— some not even fresh.\n\nOne feels engaged in a very slimy business until the reward. of a pearl .\n\nof price compensates for the hope deferred that maketh the heart (and\n\nthe stomach) sick - 7\"\n\nLast weeks sedentary\n\ntoll In the dark was rewarded\n\nby a filmic Jewel worthy of an\n\nimperial crown. It comes out\n\nof France, that has given us so\n\nmany screen gems. With inspired\n\ndirection by Maurice Cloche, Mon-\n\nileur Vincent, released at the Aus\n\ntralia, tells the story of a peasant\n\nwho became a saint.\n\nSuperlatives are risky, critical ma-\n\nterial, but it is difficult to avoid them\n\nwhen dealing with such a film. Its\n\nscript, its direction, its : acting, its\n\nphotography and its atmosphere, of\n\nsincerity all reach the high-water\n\nmark of screen art. .\n\n. it is set in France during the clos\n\ning years of the sixteenth, century\n\nand the opening years of the seven\n\nteenth. It was a time when the court\n\n»nd the nobles lived in extravagant\n\nluxury, and when the masses suf\n\nfered horrible poverty and oppres-\n\n'jLpeasant's son, Vincent entered the\n\nchurch. His genius opened the way\n\nto high office and ease, but the sight\n\nof the appalling misery, of the poor\n\ndrove him Into making their cause\n\nhis.\n\nIn portraying Vincent the. film em\n\nphasises the selfless simplicity, of. the\n\nman who ! remains the peasant\n\nthroughout; There Is no attempt to\n\nglamorise him in appearance or man\n\nner. He moves - through . .the court\n\nwith the same unassuming . dignity\n\nthat Invests him on his missions- of\n\nmercy in the dreadful slums. .\n\nBrilliant Sequence\n\nI photography makes the background\n\nsavage in Its realism - .and- contrasts.\n\nIt alternates between the selfish, lux\n\nury of the court and the nobility and\n\nI sickening scenes of abject ; poverty.\n\nI The opening scenes show him enter-\n\nI liig his first parish of Ohatillon. Here\n\nI Vincent finds a woman, suspected of\n\nI being plague-stricken. , nailed up in\n\n| her home and left to starve with her\n\n| daughter. ... . : . . .\n\nI Among the highest of- many high,-.\n\nI lights are an interview with .the all-\n\nI powerful Richelieu. Vincents last talk\n\nI with Anne of Austria.- his: experience\n\nI with the galley slaves -and the final\n\nI scene with a hospital nurse. ,\n\n1 There Is arama and humor In hio\n\nI work in enlisting the sympathy of\n\n1 the wives of nobles. His patience\n\n9 with their weakness comes out when\n\n1 they break up a meeting to discuss\n\n1 clothes and frocks. The only flash\n\n1 of anger comes'when they ; resent Vin-\n\n9 cent's plea to care for - illegitimate\n\n1 babies. They say such bables are sin-\n\n1 iul. He shatters their arguments\n\ni;l with one blistering, brief outburst\n\n|1 that leaves them shamed and silent.\n\nA Sheer Delight\n\nActing in every role is a sheer de\n\nlight. Of course, Pierre Fresnay's\n\nVincent dwarfs all. I cannot, re\n\nmember another screen role that\n\nreaches the same understanding and\n\ninterpretation of a character, and\n\nwith Pierre Fresnay are Germalne\n\nDermoz as Anne of Austria, Aime\n\nClariond as Richelieu and Jean Delu-\n\ncourt as Vincent's patron, De Gondi.\n\nAnne of Austria has one scene only\n\nwith Vincent: it is not long, but it\n\nwill stick in the mind when hundreds\n\nol other are forgotten. The last scene\n\not all is perhaps the most powerful,\n\nmore so because of its simplicity.\" He\n\nknows the end Is approaching, and\n\nhe gives his final Instruction' to the\n\nlatest-Joined hospital sister. The film\n\nfades out on .a note, that the hard\n\nest-boiled-, ears - - could . not hear un\n\nmoved\n\n. Monsieur 'Vincent' is not a -film for\n\na- section of the. community. -It is\n\nan object lesson - driven . home' hard\n\nto a world that needs a lesson badly.\n\nIf you miss it the. loss is -yours. It\n\noffers nearly two hours of, enthralling\n\nhistory that will amply, repay any\n\nInconvenience of transport \"to reach\n\nIt. Lately we have: two -films In The\n\nHeiress and The Third Man that\n\nare great stuff. But. believe me.\n\nMonsieur Vincent leaves them behind.\n\nChance also sent another - first-\n\nrater to the Capitol screen in . The\n\nChampion,- a United Artists produc\n\ntion. Boxing.'ls a' sport that makes\n\nvery small appeal- to me. : '\n\nNo doubtithe sportsmen seated com\n\nfortably by the ringside, enjoy . the\n\nspectacle. My- imagination becomes\n\ntoo lively, and makes me' wonder\n\nabout /the feelings of men on whom\n\nthose bulldozer blows fall, and who\n\nare smashed senseless to the floor\n\nof the ring to the accompaniment of\n\nyells of hordes of savages— and sports\n\nmen.\n\nHowever, The Champion happens to\n\nhe a boxing film; packed- with what\n\nAustralians call \"stoush.\" But, de\n\nspite the assault and battery it in\n\nvolves, it Is an exceptionally good\n\nfilm. I have, to my sorrow, seen many\n\n.of Its kind. One only, The Set-Dp,\n\nscreened a few weeks ago, was really\n\ngood stuff.\n\nNow, I have to admit, though I\n\nstill think- boxing Is a lamentable\n\npastime, that. The Champion Is a\n\nfar better production in every- way\n\nthan The Set-Up. In Its own class,\n\nthat of. action, it is in the front rank.\n\nInterest in the film stems from the\n\ncharacter the ' script - writers have\n\ngiven its central figure Midge Kelly\n\nand from the sincerity that Kirk\n\nDouglas puts into his rendering of\n\nthe role. / He is given the Job and\n\nsucceeds in it. of portraying a man\n\nwhom you will admire immensely\n\nfrom one angle and dislike . as much\n\nfrom another.\n\nMidge, after being, kicked round the\n\ncountry from a poverty-stricken boyr\n\nhood, fights his way to the cham\n\npionship of the ring. He keeps his\n\nfighting reputation clean, despite vari\n\nous temptations to play dirty. On the\n\nother side of the ledger he has an\n\nIrresistible fascination for women. He\n\ntakes full advantage of their, folly,\n\nand ditches: them, with callous bru\n\ntality. It leaves a nasty taste in\n\nthe mouth, until he finishes In a style\n\nthat almost redeerhs. his rancid past.\n\nit may - or may ..not be otherwise\n\nIn other countries, but,, according to\n\nthe film, boxing In the U.S. is ruled\n\nby powerful gangs of crooks, who de\n\ncide on winners before the fight be\n\ngins. Boxers— Midge was one of them\n\n— who decline to accept orders to\n\n\"throw\" a, match, are visited after\n\nwards by gangs of bashers, who teach\n\nthem discipline with a skinful of\n\nfractured ribs ' and skulls. Nice\n\nwork I . If the boxer is not subs-\n\nquently boxed between six silver-\n\nplated handles he is lucky. ,\n\nIn the Front Rank\n\nHowever, - it was Midge's hobby of\n\nphilandering that led to his finish.\n\nHe first marries, and deserts Emma,\n\nwho is too good for him. Then he\n\nalienates the best , girl of a rival to\n\nthe championship. After that he flies\n\nfor higher game in the wife of one\n\nof the. gambling bosses.\n\nThe film culminates in Midge's last\n\nfight.' - As' a - screen - spectacle - of the\n\nring and the- stadium It Is' a triumph'\n\nof realistic photography and sound.\n\nThe fight made me feel sick; but I\n\ncouldn't help: watching it.\n\nActing besides that of Kirk Douglas\n\nis on a high level. Emma - is finely\n\nplayed by Ruth Roman, and Grace,\n\nthe feline friend of his rival, is done\n\nby Marilyn Maxwell.' A very fine role\n\nIs played by Paul Stewart as Haley,\n\nMidge's trainer. Between them they\n\nmake \"stoush\" lose half its evil by\n\nlosing all - its grossness. I never\n\nthought. I would recommend a boxing\n\nfilm, but -77 — . Well,, see -it for your\n\nself. ..-\n\nMixed Pickles\n\nThe remainder of - the - -week's ' catch\n\nwas just more oysters, ' without even\n\na seed pearl among . .them. 7 Opening\n\nshots of Everybody Does\" it, a Fox\n\nfilm, at the piaza, made it look\n\nlike a winner. Its story idea is exf\n\neeilent, but . the real cpmedy degene\n\nrated into disastrous clowning.\n\nIt Is about a Chap named Leonard\n\nBorland, whose, wife, ! Doris, who\n\ncouldn't sing for nuts, aspired to be\n\ncome- a platform soprano. Doris's\n\nfather warned Len that he had suf\n\nfered under three generations of frus\n\ntrated sopranos, and could offer no\n\nhelp. Len went for comfort' and ad\n\nvice to Cecil Carver, a girl with a real\n\nvoice. She made the amazing dis\n\ncovery that Len possessed a magnifi\n\ncent baritone gift.\n\nStory turns bfi how Cecil trains\n\nLen's voice In secret; ' to enable him\n\nto crush Doris's aspirations. Singing\n\nunder a false -name, Len has the\n\ncritics raving.' Meanwhile Doris proves\n\nto be a dismal -flop. :\n\nIt would make the ' angels weep' to\n\nsee the- Way' that story was 'ruined\n\nby Its script' writers. The first 'part\n\nmust have- been written by a genius,\n\nand was then 'taken/ up by a:T6-year-\n\nold schoolboy. Paul Douglas — his voice\n\nis a knockout — is wasted as Leonard,\n\nand Linda Darnel shares the disas\n\nter as Cecil. .\n\n\\\n\nColor Prejudice\n\n.Sometimes when I see Hollywood's\n\nfilms on the color and racial pre\n\njudice in the U.S., I am reminded\n\nof the practice of Oriental beggars\n\nwho exhibit their sores- as an incen\n\ntive to charity. Such a one is In\n\ntruder In the Dust, an M-G-M pro\n\nduction at the St. James.\n\nIt is about a braye and indepen\n\ndent negro, Lucas, Who is accused and\n\ncaptured on a charge of shooting a\n\nwhite man, who should have been\n\nshot anyway. However, a fanatical\n\nanti-negro population of. a town de\n\ncides to pour petrol over him and In\n\ncinerate him alive. _\n\nHowever, a boy aged about 17, and\n\nan elderly woman with a will of her\n\nown, combine- forces and prove Lucas\n\ninnocent, and .. spoil the town's fun\n\nof witnessing a nigger., barbecue., ..\n\nThe week's /shows finished .-. at .the\n\nLyceum, where the . Dtuuaa story of\n\nthe famous diamond necklace . is\n\nscreened under the title of Black\n\nMagic. In It Orson Welles appears\n\nas the notorious charlatan, Cagliostro.\n\nThe story Is badly handled, and\n\nthe' historical details are ridiculous.\n\nThe only redeeming feature is the\n\nbackground, alleged to be Versailles,\n\nbut which was actually photographed\n\nat the Qulrinal Palace,' in Rome. It\n\nmakes a wonderful and magnificent\n\nsetting. Orson Welles as Cagliostro\n\nwould wipe the grin from the face\n\nof the Cheshire cat In Alice In Won\n\nderland.\n\nPierre Fresnay's Vincent dwarfs- all. ... . Help"
