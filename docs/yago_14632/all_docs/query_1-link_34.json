They two-stepped on the wide porch, with its pillars of pine trunks, its bobbing Japanese lanterns; and never were there dance-frocks with wider sleeves nor hair more sensuously piled on little smiling heads, never an August evening more moon-washed and spacious and proper for respectable romance.\n\nThree guests had come in these new-fangled automobiles, for it was now 1903, the climax of civilization. A fourth automobile was approaching, driven by Samuel Dodsworth.\n\nThe scene was a sentimental chromo—crisping lake, lovers in canoes singing \"Nelly Was a Lady,\" all very lugubrious and happy; and Sam Dodsworth enjoyed it. He was a large and formidable young man, with a healthy brown mustache and a chaos of brown hair on a massive head. He was, at twenty-eight, assistant superintendent of that most noisy and unsentimental institution, the Zenith Locomotive Works, and in Yale (class of 1896) he had played better than average football, but he thought well of the most sentimental sorts of moonlight.\n\nTonight he was particularly uplifted because he was driving his first car. And it was none of your old-fashioned \"gasoline buggies,\" with the engine under the seat. The engine bulked in front, under a proud hood over two feet long, and the steering column was not straight but rakishly tilted. The car was sporting and rather dangerous, and the lights were powerful affairs fed by acetylene gas. Sam sped on, with a feeling of power, of dominating the universe, at twelve dizzy miles an hour.\n\nAt the Canoe Club he was greeted by Tub Pearson, admirable in white kid gloves. Tub—Thomas J. Pearson—round and short and jolly, class-jester and class-dandy at Yale, had been Sam Dodsworth's roommate and chief admirer throughout college, but now Tub had begun to take on an irritable dignity as teller and future president of his father's bank in zenith.\n\n\"It runs!\" Tub marveled, as Sam stepped in triumph from the car. \"I've got a horse all ready to tow you back!\"\n\nTub had to be witty, whatever happened.\n\n\"Certainly it runs! I'll bet I was up to eighteen miles an hour!\"\n\n\"Yeh! I'll bet that some day automobiles'll run forty!\" Tub jeered. \"Sure! Why, they'll just about drive the poor old horse right off the highway!\"\n\n\"They will! And I'm thinking of tying up with this new Revelation Company to manufacture 'em.\"\n\n\"Not seriously, you poor chump?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh, my Lord!\" Tub wailed affectionately. \"Don't be crazy, Sambo! My dad says automobiles are nothing but a fad. Cost too much to run. In five years, he says, they'll disappear.\"\n\nSam's answer was not very logical:\n\n\"Who's the young angel on the porch?\"\n\nIf she was an angel, the girl at whom Sam was pointing, she was an angel of ice; slim, shining, ash-blonde, her self-possessed voice very cool as she parried the complimentary teasing of half a dozen admirers; a crystal candle-stick of a girl among black-and-white lumps of males.\n\n\"You remember her—Frances Voelker—Fran Voelker—old Herman's kid. She's been abroad for a year, and she was East, in finishing-school, before that. Just a brat—isn't over nineteen or twenty, I guess. Golly, they say she speaks German and French and Italian and Woof-woof and all known languages.\"\n\nHerman Voelker had brewed his way into millions and respectability. His house was almost the largest in Zenith—certainly it had the greatest amount of turrets, colored glass windows, and lace curtains—and he was leader among the German-Americans who were supplanting the New Englanders throughout the state as controllers of finance and merchandising. He entertained German professors when they came lecturing and looking, and it was asserted that one of the genuine hand-painted pictures which he had recently brought back from Nuremberg was worth nearly ten thousand dollars. A worthy citizen, Herman, and his tart beer was admirable, but that this beef-colored burgher should have fathered anything so poised and luminous as Fran was a miracle.\n\nThe sight of her made Sam Dodsworth feel clumsy as a St. Bernard looking at a white kitten. While he prophesied triumphs for the motor car, while he danced with other girls, he observed her airy dancing and her laughter. Normally, he was not particularly afraid of young women, but Fran Voelker seemed too fragile for his thick hands. Not till ten did he speak to her, when a partner left her, a flushed Corybant, in a chair near Sam's.\n\n\"Do you remember me—Dodsworth? Years since I've seen you.\"\n\n\"Remember! Heavens! I wondered if you were going to notice me. I used to steal the newspaper from Dad to get the news of your football heroisms. And when I was a nice young devil of eight, you once chased me out of your orchard for stealing apples.\"\n\n\"Did I? Wouldn't dare to now! Mavenex' dance?\"\n\n\"Well—Let me see. Oh. The next is with Levering Mott, and he's already ruined three of my two slippers. Yes.\"\n\n*\n\nIf he did not dance with any particular neatness, a girl knew where she was, with Sam Dodsworth. He had enough strength and decision to let a young woman understand who was doing the piloting. With Fran Voelker, he was inspired; he waltzed as though he was proud of his shining burden. He held her lightly enough and, after the chaste custom of the era, his hands were gloved. But his finger-tips felt a current from her body. He knew that she was the most exquisite child in the world; he knew that he was going to marry her and keep her forever in a shrine; he knew that after years of puzzled wonder about the purpose of life, he had found it.\n\n\"She's like a lily—no, she's too lively. She's like a humming bird—no, too kind of dignified. She's—oh, she's a flame!\"\n\n*\n\nThey sat talking by the lake at midnight. Out on the dappled water, seen through a cloud of willow leaves, the youngsters in canoes were now singing \"My Old Kentucky Home.\" Zenith was still in the halcyon William Dean Howells days; not yet had it become the duty of young people to be hard and brisk, and knowing about radios, jazz, and gin.\n\nFran was a white shadow, in a lace shawl over her thin yellow dancing frock, as she drooped down on a newspaper which he had solemnly spread for her on the long grass. Sam trembled a little, and sounded very pompous, rather boyish:\n\n\"I suppose you went everywhere in Europe.\"\n\n\"More or less. France and Spain and Austria and Switzerland and—Oh, I've seen the Matterhorn by moonlight, and Santa Maria della Salute at dawn. And I've been almost frozen to death in a mistral at Avignon!\"\n\n\"I suppose you'll be bored in Zenith.\"\n\nShe laughed, in a small competent way. \"I know so much about Europe—I'm no Cook's tripper!—that I know I don't know anything! All I can do in French is to order breakfast. Six months from now, all I'll remember of Germany is the names of nineteen towns, and how the Potsdamer Platz looks when you're waiting for a droschke. But you've done things. What are you doing now, by the way?\"\n\n\"Assistant supe at the Locomotive Works. But I'm going to take a big gamble and—Ever ride in an automobile?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, several times, in Paris and New York.\"\n\n\"Well, I believe that in twenty years, say by 1923 or '4, they'll be as common as buggies are now! I'm going in on a new company here—Revelation Automobile Company. I'll get less salary, but it's a swell gamble. Wonderful future. I've been working on my mechanical drawing lately, and I've got the idea that they ought to get away from imitating carriages. Make a—it sounds highbrow, but I mean what you might call a new kind of beauty for autos. Kind of long straight lines. The Revelation boss thinks I'm crazy. What do you think?\"\n\n\"Oh, splendid!\"\n\n\"And I've bought me an automobile of my own.\"\n\n\"Oh, really?\"\n\n\"Let me drive you home tonight!\"\n\n\"No, sorry; Mama is coming for me.\"\n\n\"You've got to let me take you for a ride. Soon!\"\n\n\"Perhaps next Sunday...We must go back to the clubhouse, don't you think?\"\n\nHe sprang up, meekly. As he lifted her to her feet, as he felt her slim hands, he murmured, \"Certainly like to see Europe some day. When I graduated, I thought I'd be a civil engineer and see the Brazil jungle and China and all over. Reg'lar Richard Harding Davis stuff! But—Certainly going to see Europe, anyway. Maybe I might run into you over there, and you might show me some of it.\"\n\n\"I'd love to!\"\n\nAh, if she desired Europe, he would master it, and give it to her on a platter of polished gold!\n\n*\n\nThere was the telephone call to her when he should have been installing machinery at the Revelation Automobile Company. There was the drive with her in his new car, very careful, though once he ventured on seventeen miles an hour. There was the dinner at the Voelkers', in the room with carved beams like a Hofbrauhaus, and Sam's fear that if Fran was kept on food like this, roast goose and stuffed cabbage and soup with Leberknodel, she would lose her race-horse slimness.\n\nAnd there was even a moment when, recalling his vow made in Massachusetts Tech after graduating from Yale that he would cut loose from America and see the great world, he warned himself that between Fran and tying himself to the urgent new motor industry, he would be caught for life. The vision of himself as a Richard Harding Davis hero returned wistfully...Riding a mountain trail, two thousand sheer feet above a steaming valley; sun-helmet and whipcord breeches; tropical rain on a tin-roofed shack; a shot in the darkness as he sat over a square-face of gin with a ragged tramp of Noble Ancestry. But his mind fled back to the excitement of Fran's image: her spun-glass hair, her tingling hands, her lips that were forever pursing in fantastic pouts, her chatter that fell suddenly into inexplicable silence, her cool sureness that made him feel foggy and lumbering.\n\n*\n\nIn a slaty November drizzle, they were tramping the cliffs along the Chaloosa River. Fran's cheeks were alight and she was humming, but when they stopped to look at the wash of torn branches in the flooded river Sam felt that he must be protective. She was too slight and precious for such hardship as an autumnal rain. He drew the edge of his mackintosh over her woolly English topcoat.\n\n\"You must be soaked! I'm a brute to let you stay out!\"\n\nShe smiled at him, very close. \"I like it!\"\n\nIt seemed to him that she had snuggled closer. He kissed her—for the first time, and very badly indeed.\n\n\"Oh, please don't!\" she begged, a little shocked, her lively self-possession gone.\n\n\"Fran, you've got to marry me!\"\n\nShe slipped from the shelter of his raincoat and, arms akimbo, said impishly, \"Oh, really? Is that a new law?\"\n\n\"It is!\"\n\n\"The great Yale athlete speaks! The automobile magnate!\"\n\nVery gravely: \"No, just a scared lump of meat that's telling you he worships you!\"\n\nStill she stared at him, among the autumn-bedraggled weeds on the river bank; she stared impudently, but quite suddenly she broke, covered her eyes with her hands, and while he clumsily dabbled at her cheeks with a huge handkerchief, she sobbed:\n\n\"Oh, Sam, my dear, but I'm so grasping! I want the whole world, not just Zenith! I don't want to be a good wife and mother and play cribbage prettily! I want splendor! Great horizons! Can we look for them together?\"\n\n\"We will!\" said Sam.\n\n*\n\nIt was not till 1908, when he had been married for five years to Fran Voelker and they had had two babies, Emily and Brent, that Samuel Dodsworth came on his real struggle at the Revelation Automobile Company.\n\nHis superiors in the company had equally prized him for his steadiness and industry and fretted at him for being a dreamer. He was crazy as a poet, they said. Not only did he venture to blaspheme against the great Renault-Darracq dogmas of car-designing, not only did he keep on raving about long \"stream-lines,\" but he insisted that the largest profits would lie in selling automobiles as cheaply as possible to as many customers as possible. He was only assistant manager of production in 1908, but he owned a little stock, and his father-in-law, portly old Herman Voelker, owned more. It was hard to discharge Sam, even when he growled at the president of the company, \"If you keep the Rev looking like the one-horse-shay, we'll go bankrupt.\"\n\nThey tried to buy him out, and Sam, who had been absorbed in blue prints and steel castings, had to learn something about the tricks of financing: about bonds, transfer of stock, call loans, discounts to dealers. With Voelker's money behind him, he secured twenty-three per cent. of the stock, he was made vice president and manager of production, he brought out the first four-door model, and he saw the Revelation become the sensation of America for a season and one of its best-selling cars for a score of years.\n\nAnd never, these twenty years, did he come nearer to the Brazilian jungle than Wall Street, nearer to the tinkling pagodas than the Revelation agency in Kansas City.\n\nBut he was too busy to be discontented; and he managed to believe that Fran loved him.\n\nChapter 2\n\nSamuel Dodsworth discovered that there was a snowstorm, nearly a blizzard, whirling about the house. He closed the windows with a bang and plumped back into bed till the room should be warm. He did not move so swiftly as he once had, and above the frogged silk pajamas which Fran insisted on buying for him, his hair was gray. He was healthy enough, and serene, but he was tired, and he seemed far older than his fifty years.\n\nFran was asleep in the farther of the twin beds, vast walnut structures with yellow silk draping. Sam looked about the bedroom. He had sometimes caught himself wondering if it wasn't too elaborate, but usually its floridness pleased him, not only as a sign of success but because it suited the luxurious Fran. Now he noted contentedly the chaise longue, with a green and silver robe across it; the desk, with monogrammed stationery very severe and near-English and snobbish; Fran's bedside table, with jeweled traveling-clock, cigarettes, and the new novels; the bathroom with its purple tiles.\n\nFran stirred, sighed and, while he chuckled at her resemblance to a child trying to slip back into dreams, she furiously burrowed her eyes into the little lacy pillow, which was crumpled with her determined sleeping.\n\n\"No use,\" he said. His rather heavy voice caressed her. \"You know you're awake! Rise and shine! Face the problems of humanity and the grape fruit!\"\n\nShe sat up, looking at him with the astonishment she had never quite lost at being married, breaking a yawn with a smile, tousling her bobbed hair that was still ash-blond, without gray. If Sam seemed older than his age, she was far younger. She was forty-one now, in 1925, but, rosy with sleeping, she seemed thirty-one.\n\n\"I'm going to have breakfast in bed you're smoking before breakfast again I haven't had breakfast in bed since yesterday,\" she yawned amiably, while he swung his thick legs over the edge of his lilac satin comforter and lighted a cigarette.\n\n\"Yes. Stay in bed. Like to, myself. Devil of a snowstorm,\" he said, paddling round to stroke her hair, to nuzzle his ruddy cheek against her soft fairness. \"By the way, did I ever remember to tell you that I adore you?\"\n\n\"Why—let me see—no, I don't believe so.\"\n\n\"Golly, I'm getting absent-minded! I'll have my secretary remind me to do it tomorrow.\" Seriously: \"Realize that we finally wind up the old Revelation Company today? Sort of sorry.\"\n\n\"No! I'm not a bit sorry! I'm delighted. You'll be free for the first time in all these years. Let's run off some place. Oh, don't let yourself get tied up with anything new! So silly. We have enough money, and you go on stewing—'must change the design of the carburetor float—simply must sell more cars in the territory between Medicine Hat and Woolawoola.' So silly! What does it matter! Do ring for the maid, darling.\"\n\n\"Well, no, maybe it doesn't matter, but fellow likes to do his job. It's kind of a battle; fun to beat the other fellow and put over a thundering big sale. But I am rather tired. Wouldn't mind skipping off to Florida or some place.\"\n\n\"Let's!\"\n\nHe had dutifully brought her heavy silver mirror, her brush and comb, her powder, her too-gorgeous lounging robe of Chinese brocade. When she had made herself a bit older by making herself youthful, she sat up in bed to read the Zenith Advocate-Times. If she looked fluffy and agreeably useless, there was nothing fluffy in her sharp comments on the news. She sounded like a woman of many affairs, many committees.\n\n\"Humph! That idiot-boy alderman, Klingenger, is going to oppose our playground bill. I'll wring his neck!...The D.A.R. are going to do another pageant. I will not be Martha Washington! You might be George. You have his detestable majesticness.\"\n\n\"Me?\" as he came from his bath. \"I'm a clown. Wait till you see me in Florida!\"\n\n\"Yes. Pitching horseshoes. I wouldn't put it past you, my beloved!...Huh! It says here the Candlelight Club expect to have Hugh Walpole lecture, next season. I'll see our program committee pinches him off 'em.\"\n\nHe was slowly dressing. He always wore large grave suits, brown or gray or plain blue, expensively tailored and not very interesting, with decorous and uninteresting ties of dull silk and no jewelry save a watch-chain. But though you were not likely to see what he wore, you noted him as a man of importance, as an executive, tall, deep-chested, his kind eyes never truculent, but his mouth serious, with crescents of wrinkles beside it. His gray-threaded brown mustache, trimmed every week by the best barber at the best hotel, was fully as eccentric and showy as a doormat.\n\nHe made his toilet like a man who never wasted motions—and who, incidentally, had a perfectly organized household to depend upon. His hand went surely to the tall pile of shirts (Fran ordered them from Jermyn Street) in the huge Flemish armoire, and to the glacial nest of collars, always inspected by the parlor maid and discarded for the slightest fraying. He tied his tie, not swiftly but with the unwasteful and extremely unadventurous precision of a man who has introduced as much \"scientific efficiency\" into daily domesticity as into his factory.\n\nHe kissed her and, while she nibbled at sweetbreads and drank her coffee in bird-like sips and furiously rattled the newspaper in bed, he marched down-stairs to the oak-beamed dining-room. Over a second copy of the Advocate, and a Chicago paper, he ponderously and thoroughly attended to orange juice, porridge and thick cream, bacon, corn cakes and syrup, and coffee in a cup twice as large as the cup which Fran was jiggling in her thin hand as she galloped through the paper up-stairs.\n\nTo the maid he said little, and that amiably, as one certain that he would be well served. He was not extraordinarily irritable even when he was informed that Emily, his engaging daughter, had been up late at a dance and would not be down for breakfast. He liked Emily's morning gossip, but he never dreamed of demanding her presence—of demanding anything from her. He smiled over the letter of his son, Brent, now a junior in Yale.\n\nSamuel Dodsworth was, perfectly, the American Captain of Industry, believing in the Republican Party, high tariff and, so long as they did not annoy him personally, in prohibition and the Episcopal Church. He was the president of the Revelation Motor Company; he was a millionaire, though decidedly not a multimillionaire; his large house was on Ridge Crest, the most fashionable street in Zenith; he had some taste in etchings; he did not split many infinitives; and he sometimes enjoyed Beethoven. He would certainly (so the observer assumed) produce excellent motor cars; he would make impressive speeches to the salesmen; but he would never love passionately, lose tragically, nor sit in contented idleness upon tropic shores.\n\n*\n\nTo define what Sam Dodsworth was, at fifty, it is easiest to state what he was not. He was none of the things which most Europeans and many Americans expect in a leader of American industry. He was not a Babbitt, not a Rotarian, not an Elk, not a deacon. He rarely shouted, never slapped people on the back, and he had attended only six baseball games since 1900. He knew, and thoroughly, the Babbitts and baseball fans, but only in business.\n\nWhile he was bored by free verse and cubism, he thought rather well of Dreiser, Cabell, and so much of Proust as he had rather laboriously mastered. He played golf reasonably well and did not often talk of his scores. He liked fishing-camps in Ontario, but never made himself believe that he preferred hemlock boughs to a mattress. He was common sense apotheosized, he had the energy and reliability of a dynamo, he liked whisky and poker and pate de foie gras, and all the while he dreamed of motors like thunderbolts, as poets less modern than himself might dream of stars and roses and nymphs by a pool.\n\n*\n\nA crisis in life had been forced on him, for his Revelation Company was being absorbed by the Unit Automotive Company—the imperial U.A.C., with its seven makes of motors, its body-building works, its billion dollars of capital. Alec Kynance, president of the U.A.C., was in Zenith, and today the final transfer of holdings was to be made.\n\nSam had wanted to fight the U.A.C., to keep independent this creation to which he had devoted twenty-two years, but his fellow directors were afraid. The U.A.C. could put on the market a car as good as the Revelation at a lower price, and drive them from the market. If necessary, the U.A.C. could sell below cost for a year or two. But they wanted the Revelation label and would pay for it. And the U.A.C. cossacks were good fellows. They did not treat Sam like a captive, but as a fellow warrior, to be welcomed to their larger army, so at the last Sam hid from himself the belief that the U.A.C., with their mass production, would cheapen and ruin the Revelation and turn his thunderbolt into a standardized cigar-lighter, and he had agreed to their generous purchase price.\n\nHe was not happy about it, when he let himself think abstractly. But he was extremely well trained, from his first days in Zenith High School, in not letting himself do anything so destructive as abstract thinking.\n\n*\n\nSam clumped up-stairs and found Fran, very brisk, fairly cheerful, still in her brocade dressing-gown but crouching over her desk, dashing off notes: suggestions to partisans in her various clubs, orders to the secretaries of the leagues which she supported—leagues for the study of democracy, leagues for the blind, societies for the collection of statistics about the effect of alcohol on plantation-hands in Mississippi. She was interested in every aspect of these leagues except perhaps the purposes for which they had been founded, and no Indiana politician was craftier at soaping enemies, advising friends, and building up a political machine to accomplish nothing in particular.\n\nShe shone at Sam as he lumbered in, but she said abruptly, \"Sit down, please. I want to talk to you.\"\n\n(\"Oh, Lord, what have I done now?\") He sat meekly in a chintz-covered overstuffed chair.\n\n\"Sam! I've been thinking lately. I didn't want to speak to you about it till you had the U.A.C. business all finished. But I'm afraid you'll get yourself tied up with some new job, and I want to go to Europe!\"\n\n\"Well—\"\n\n\"Wait! This may be our only chance, the only time you'll be free till we're so old we won't enjoy wandering. Let's take the chance! There'll be time for you to create a dozen new kinds of cars when we come back. You'll do it all the better if you have a real rest. A real one! I don't want to go just for a few months, but for a solid year.\"\n\n\"Good Heavens!\"\n\n\"Yes, they are good! Think! Here's Emily going to be married next month. Then she won't need us. Brent has enough friends in college. He won't need us. I can chuck all these beastly clubs and everything. They don't mean anything; they're just make-believe, to keep me busy. I'm a very active female, Sam, and I want to do something besides sitting around Zenith. Think what we could do! Spring on the Italian Lakes! Motoring through the Tyrol! London in the Season! And I've never seen Europe since I was a girl, and you've never seen it at all. Let yourself have a good time for once! Trust me, can't you, dear?\"\n\n\"Well, it would be kind of nice to get away from the grind. I'd like to look over the Rolls-Royce and Mercedes plants. And see Paris and the Alps. But a year—That's a long time. I think we'd get pretty tired of Europe, living around in hotels. But—I really haven't made any plans. The U.A.C. business was so sudden. I would like to see Italy. Those hill-towns must be very curious. And so old. We'll talk about it tonight. Auf wiedersehen, old lady.\"\n\nHe tramped out, apparently as dependable as an old Newfoundland and as little given to worrying about anything more complex than the hiding-places of bones. But he was fretting as he sat erect in his limousine, while Smith drove him into town.\n\nThese moments of driving were the only times when he was alone. He was as beset by people—his wife, his daughter, his son, his servants, his office-staff, his friends at lunch and on the golf course—as in his most frenziedly popular days at college, when it had been his \"duty to old Yale\" to be athletic and agreeable, and never to be alone, certainly never to sit and think. People came to him, swarmed about him, wanted his advice and his money and the spiritual support which they found in his ponderous caution. Yet he liked to be alone, he liked to meditate, and he made up for it on these morning rides.\n\n\"She's right,\" he worried. \"I'd better not let her know how right she is, or she'll yank me off to London before I can pack my flask. I wonder—Oh yes, of course, she does care for me, a lot. But sometimes I wish she weren't quite so good a manager. She just tries to amuse me by playing at being a kitten. She isn't one, not by a long shot. She's a greyhound. Sometimes when I'm tired, I wish she just wanted to cuddle up and be lazy with me. She's quicksilver. And quicksilver is hard, when you try to compress it!\n\n\"Oh, that's unfair. She's been the best wife—I haven't given enough time to courting her, what with all this cursed business. And I'm tired of business. Like to sit around and chat and get acquainted with myself. And I'm tired of these streets!\"\n\nThe limousine was laboring through a gusty snowstorm, skidding a bit on icy asphalt, creaking and lumbering as it climbed over drifts. The windows of the car were frost-emblazoned. Sam impatiently cleared a peep-hole with the heel of his glove.\n\nThey were creeping along Conklin Avenue, where the dreary rows of old red brick mansions, decayed into boarding houses, the cheap grocery shops and dirty laundries and gloomy little \"undertaking parlors\" and lunch-rooms with the blatant sign \"Eats,\" not very entrancing at any time, were turned by the rags of blown snow into the bleakness of a lumber-camp, while the breadth of the street made it only the more shelterless and unintimate. On either side were streets of signboards advertising oil and cigarettes, of wooden one-story shacks between old-fashioned yellow brick tenement-houses gloomy in the sunless snow; a region of poverty without picturesqueness and of labor without hope.\n\n\"Oh, Lord, I'd like to get away from it! Be nice to see the Mediterranean and a little sunshine,\" Sam muttered. \"Let's go!\"\n\n*\n\nThe General Offices of the Revelation Motor Company were in an immense glass and marble building on Constitution Avenue, North, above Court House Square, opposite the flashing new skyscraper of the Plymouth National Bank. The entrance to the floor given to executive offices was like the lobby of a pretentious hotel—waiting-room in brocade and tapestry and Grand Rapids renaissance; then something like an acre of little tables with typists and typists and typists, very busy, and clerks and clerks and clerks, with rattling papers; and a row of private offices resembling furniture showrooms, distinguished by enormous desks in imitation of refectory tables, covered with enormous sheets of plate glass, and fanatically kept free of papers and all jolly disorder.\n\nThe arrival of President Dodsworth was like that of a General Commanding. \"Good morning!\" rumbled the uniformed doorman, a retired sergeant. \"Good morning!\" chirped the girl at the inquiry desk, a charming girl whose gentleman-friend was said to be uncommonly high up in the fur business. \"Good morning!\" indicated the typists and clerks, their heads bowing like leaves agitated by a flitting breeze as he strode by them. \"Good morning!\" caroled Sam's private stenographer as he entered his own office. \"Good morning!\" shouted his secretary, an offensively high-pressure young slave-driver. And even the red-headed Jewish office boy, as he took Sam's coat and hung it up so that it would not dry, condescended \"Mornin', boss.\"\n\nYet today all this obsequiousness, normally not unpleasant to the Great Man, annoyed him; all this activity, this proof that ever so many people were sending out ever so many letters about things presumably of importance, seemed to him an irritating fussiness. What did it matter whether he had another hundred thousand dollars to leave to Brent? What did it matter whether John B. Johnson of Jonesburg did or did not take the local Revelation agency? Why were all these hundreds of young people willing to be turned into machines for the purposes of rattling papers and bowing to the president?\n\nThe Great Man approached his desk, put on his eye-glasses, and graciously received a stock-report, as one accomplishing empires.\n\nBut the Great Man was thinking:\n\n\"They make me tired—poor devils! Come on, Fran! Let's go! Let's drift way round to China!\"\n\n*\n\nAlec Kynance, president of the Unit Automotive Company, with his regiment of officers, lawyers, secretaries, was not coming for half an hour. Sam said impulsively to his stenographer, \"Miss Rachman, skip down to the travel bureau at the Thornleigh, won't you please, and bring me all the steamship folders and European travel information and so on that they have there. And round-the-world.\"\n\nWhile he waited for her he turned over the papers in the wire basket which his secretary had reverently laid on the glass-topped vastness of his desk. These matters had seemed significant a few days ago, like orders given in battle, but now that the Revelation Company was no longer his—\n\nHe sighed, he shuffled the papers indifferently: The secret report on the dissipations of the manager of the Northwestern Division. The plans of the advertising agency for notices about the union of the U.A.C. and the Revelation, which was to be announced with glad, gaudy public rejoicing. What did they matter, now that he was turned from a bandit captain to a clerk?\n\nFor the first time he admitted that if he went to the U.A.C., even as first vice president, he would be nothing more than an office boy. He could make no daring decisions by himself. They had taken from him the pride in pioneering which was one of his props in life—and who they were, he didn't quite know. They were something more than just Alec Kynance and a few other officers of the U.A.C. They were part of a booming industrial flood which was sweeping over him. They would give him a larger house, a yacht, but they would not give him work that was really his own. He had helped to build a machine which was running away from him. He had no longer the dignity of a craftsman. He made nothing; he meant nothing; he was no longer Samuel Dodsworth, but merely part of a crowd vigorously pushing one another toward nowhere.\n\nHe wandered to the window. In that blast of snow, the shaft of the Plymouth National Bank Building was aspiring as a cathedral; twenty gray stories, with unbroken vertical lines swooping up beyond his vision into the snowy fog. It had nobility, but it seemed cruel, as lone and contemptuous of friendly human efforts as a forgotten tower on the Siberian steppes. How indifferently it would watch him starve and freeze!\n\nWith relief he looked at the travel brochures when his stenographer brought them in—a lively girl, shaking the snow from her little cloche hat, beaming at him, assuring him that he really did exist and was something of importance still. Then he was lost in the pictures...Titanic walls of the Grand Canyon: scarlet pillars and pyramids of orange. A tawny road in Algiers, the sun baking, nodding camels, and drivers with dusky malign faces under their turbans. St. Moritz, shadowed by the mountains, and a pretty girl on a toboggan. A terrace at Cannes, where through fig-trees and palms and tumbling roses you looked on the sea with a lone felucca. A valley of colored patchwork fields seen from a harsh tor of Dartmoor. Japanese children rollicking among cherry trees beside a tiny temple. Dark wood of carven mediaeval houses looming over the Romerberg at Frankfort. The Grand Canal, with the fantastic columns of the piazzetta and the soft pink and cream of the ducal palace. The old sea-fronted walls of Ragusa. The streets of Paris—kiosks, impudent advertisements, a whisk of skirts, a whirligig of traffic, and little tables at which to loaf all day long.\n\n\"Wouldn't be so bad!\" thought Sam. \"I'd like to wander around a few months. Only I'm not going to let Fran coax me into being one of these wishy-washy expatriates, homeless, afraid of life, living on the Riviera as though they were in a sanatorium for neurotics. I'm going to go on doing something with life, and my place is here. We'll go abroad, only I'll make her fight for it or she'll feel she's running the whole show. Then I'll come back here, and I'll take Alec Kynance's show right away from him!\"\n\n\"Mr. Kynance is here,\" announced his secretary.\n\nChapter 3\n\nMr. Alexander Kynance, president of the Unit Automotive Company, was a small bustling man with a large head, an abrupt voice, a lively mind, a magnificent lack of scruples, and a love for oratory and Corona-Coronas. He had been a section-hand and a railway superintendent, he had the best cellar of Burgundies in Detroit, and he made up for his runtiness by barking at people.\n\n\"Everything all ready? Everything all ready?\" he barked at Sam Dodsworth, as the dozen representatives of the two companies settled down and rested their elbows on the gigantic mirror-surfaced table in the gold and oak directors'-room.\n\n\"I think so,\" Sam drawled.\n\n\"Just a few things left,\" said Kynance. \"We've about decided to run the Revelation in between the Chromecar and the Highroad in class—drop it three hundred below your price—two-door sedan at eleven-fifty.\"\n\nSam wanted to protest. Hadn't he kept the price down to the very lowest at which his kind of car could be built? But suddenly—What difference did it make? The Revelation wasn't his master, his religion! He was going to have a life of his own, with Fran, lovely loyal Fran, whom he'd imprisoned here in Zenith!\n\nLet's go!\n\nHe was scarcely listening to Kynance's observations on retaining the slogan \"You'll revel in a Revelation.\" Sam had always detested this battle-cry. It was the invention of a particularly bright and bounding young copy-writer who took regular exercise at the Y.M.C.A., but the salesmen loved it. As Kynance snapped, \"Good slogan—good slogan—full o' pep,\" Sam mused:\n\n\"They're all human megaphones. And I'm tired.\"\n\n*\n\nWhen he had rather sadly signed the transfer of control to the U.A.C. and his lifework was over, with no chance for retreat, Sam shook hands a great deal with a number of people, and was left alone with Alec Kynance.\n\n\"Now to real business, old man,\" Kynance blatted. \"You'll be tickled to death at getting hooked up with a concern that can control the world-market one of these days—regular empire, b' God!—instead of crawling along having to depend on a bunch of so-so assistants. We want you to come with us, of course. I haven't been hinting around. Hinting ain't my way. When Alec Kynance has something to say, by God he shoots! I want to offer you the second vice-presidency of the U.A.C., in general charge of production of all our eight cars, including the Rev. You've been getting sixty thousand salary, besides your stock?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"We can offer you eighty-five, and your share in the managers' pool, with a good chance for a hundred thou in a few years, and you'll probably succeed me when the bootlegged hootch gets me. And you'll have first-class production-men under you. You can take it easy and just think up mean ideas to shove over. Other night you were drooling about how you'd like to make real Ritzy motor caravans with electric stoves and radios and everything built in. Try it! We've got the capital. And this idea you had about a motorized touring-school for boys in summer. Try it! Why, God, we might run all these summer camps out of business and make a real killing—get five hundred thousand customers—kid that hadn't gone on one of our tours, no class to him at all! Try it! And the U.A.C. getting into aeroplane manufacture. Go ahead. Draw up your plans. Yes sir, that's the kind of support we give a high-class man. When do you want to go to work? I suppose you'll have to move to Detroit, but you can get back here pretty often. Want to start right in, and see things zip?\"\n\nSam's fantastic schemes for supercaravans, for an ambulatory summer school in which boys should see the whole country from Maine pines to San Joaquin wheat-fields, schemes which he had found stimulating and not very practical, were soiled by the lobster-faced little man's insistence on cashing in. No!\n\n\"First, I think I'll take a vacation,\" Sam said doubtfully. \"Haven't had a real one for years. Maybe I'll run over to Europe. May stay three months or so.\"\n\n\"Europe? Rats! Dead's a doornail! Place for women and long-haired artists. Dead! Only American loans that keep 'em from burying the corpse! All this art! More art in a good shiny spark-plug than in all the fat Venus de Mylos they ever turned out. Naw! Go take a run through California, maybe grab a drink of good liquor in Mexico, and then come with us. Look here, Dodsworth. My way of being diplomatic is to come out flat. You necking around with some other concern? We can't wait. We got to turn out the cars! I can't keep this open, and I've offered you our pos-o-lutely highest salary. That's the way we do business. Yes or no?\"\n\n\"I'm not flirting with any other company. I've had several offers and turned them down. Your offer is fair.\"\n\n\"Fine! Let's sign the contract right now. Got her here! Put down your John Hancock, and begin to draw the ole salary from this minute, with a month's vacation on pay! How's that?\"\n\nWith the noisiness of a little man making an impression, Kynance slapped the contract on the glowing directors'-table, flourished an enormous red and black fountain pen, and patronizingly poked Sam in the shoulder.\n\nIrritably Sam rumbled, \"I can't tie myself up without thinking it over. I'll give you my answer as soon as I can. Probably in a week or so. But I may want to take a four-months rest in Europe. Never mind about the pay meanwhile. Rather feel free.\"\n\n\"My God, man, what do you think is the purpose of life? Loafing? Getting by with doing as little as you can? I tell you, what I always say is: there's no rest like a little extra work! You ain't tired—you're just fed up with this backwoods town. Come up to Detroit and see how we make things hum! Come sit in with us and hear us tell Congress where it gets off. Work! That's the caper! I tell you,\" with a grotesque, evangelical sonorousness, \"I tell you, Dodsworth, to me, work is a religion. 'Turn not thy hand from the plow.' Do big things! Think of it; by making autos we're enabling half the civilized world to run into town from their pig-sties and see the movies, and the other half to get out of town and give Nature the once-over. Twenty million cars in America! And in twenty more years we'll have the bloomin' Tibetans and Abyssinians riding on cement roads in U.A.C. cars! Talk about Napoleon! Talk about Shakespeare! Why, we're pulling off the greatest miracle since the Lord created the world!\n\n\"Europe? How in hell would you put in four months? Think you could stand more'n ten art galleries? I know! I've seen Europe! Their Notre Dame is all right for about half an hour, but I'd rather see an American assembly-plant, thousand men working like a watch, than all their old, bum-lighted, tumble-down churches—\"\n\nIt was half an hour before Sam got rid of Kynance without antagonizing him, and without signing a contract.\n\n\"I'd like,\" Sam reflected, \"to sit under a linden tree for six straight months and not hear one word about Efficiency or Doing Big Things or anything more important than the temperature of the beer—if there is anything more important.\"\n\n*\n\nHe had fallen into rather a rigid routine. Most days, between office and home, he walked to the Union Club in winter, drove to the golf course in summer. But tonight he was restless. He could not endure the fustiness of the old boys at the club. His chauffeur would be waiting there, but on his way to the club Sam stopped, with a vague notion of tasting foreignness, at a cheap German restaurant.\n\nIt was dark, quiet, free of the bouncing grandeur of Kynances. At a greasy oilcloth-covered table he sat sipping coffee and nibbling at sugar-crusted coffee-cake.\n\n\"Why should I wear myself out making more money for myself—no, for Kynance! He will like hell take my caravans away from me!\"\n\nHe dreamed of a very masterwork of caravans: a tiny kitchen with electric stove, electric refrigerator; a tiny toilet with showerbath; a living-room which should become a bedroom by night—a living-room with a radio, a real writing desk; and on one side of the caravan, or at the back, a folding verandah. He could see his caravanners dining on the verandah in a forest fifty miles from any house.\n\n\"Kind of a shame to have 'em ruin any more wilderness. Oh, that's just sentimentality,\" he assured himself. \"Let's see. We ought to make that up—\" He was figuring on a menu. \"We ought to produce those in quantities for seventeen hundred dollars, and our selling-point will be the saving in hotel bills. Like to camp in one myself! I will not let Kynance have my ideas! He'd turn the caravans out, flimsy and uncomfortable, for eleven hundred, and all he'd think about would be how many we could slam on the market. Kynance! Lord, to take his orders, to stand his back-slapping, at fifty! No!\"\n\nThe German restaurant-keeper said, as one content with all seasons and events, \"Pretty bad snow tonight.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nAnd to himself: \"There's a fellow who isn't worrying about Doing Big Things. And work isn't his religion. His religion is roast goose, which has some sense to it. Yes, let's go, Fran! Then come back and play with the caravan...Or say, for an elaborate rig, why not two caravans, one with kitchen and toilet and stores, other with living-bedroom, and pitch 'em back to back, with a kind of train-vestibule door, and have a real palace for four people?...I would like to see Monte Carlo. Must be like a comic opera.\"\n\n*\n\nHis desire for Monte Carlo, for palms and sunshine and the estimable fish of the Prince of Monaco, was enhanced by jogging through the snowstorm in his car, by being held up in drifts, and clutching the undercurving seat during a rather breathless slide uphill to Ridge Crest. But when he entered the warmth of the big house, when he sat in the library alone (Fran was not yet back from the Children's Welfare Bridge), with a whisky-soda and a volume of Masereel woodcuts, when he considered his deep chair and the hearth-log and the roses, Sam felt the security of his own cave and the assurance to be found in familiar work, in his office-staff, in his clubs, his habits and, most of all, his friends and Fran and the children.\n\nHe regarded the library contentedly: the many books, some of them read—volumes of history, philosophy, travels, detective stories; the oak-framed fireplace with a Mary Cassatt portrait of children above it; the blue davenport; the Biedermeyer rug from Fran's kin in Germany; the particularly elaborate tantalus.\n\n\"Pretty nice. Hotels—awful! Oh yes, I'll probably go over to the U.A.C. But maybe take six weeks or a couple of months in Europe, then move to Detroit. But not sell this house! Been mighty happy here. Like to come back here and spend our old days. When I really make my pile, I'll do something to help turn Zenith into another Detroit. Get a million people here. Only, plan the city right. Make it the most beautiful city in the world. Not just sit around on my chair in Europe and look at famous cities, but make one!\"\n\n*\n\nOnce a month, Sam's closest friends, Tub Pearson, his humorous classmate who was now the gray and oracular president of the Centaur State Bank, Dr. Henry Hazzard, the heart specialist, Judge Turpin, and Wheeler, the packing-house magnate, came in for dinner and an evening of poker, with Fran as hostess at dinner but conveniently disappearing after it.\n\nFran whisked in from her charity bridge as he was going up to dress. In her sleek coat of gray squirrel she was like a snow-sprinkled cat pouncing on flying leaves. She tossed her coat and hat to the waiting maid, and kissed Sam abruptly. She was virginal as the winter wind, this girl who was the mother of Emily about to be married.\n\n\"Terrible bore, the bridge. I won seventeen dollars. I'm a good little bridge-player, I am. We must hustle it's almost dinnertime oh what a bore Lucile McKelvey is with her perpetual gabble about Italy I bet I'll learn more Italian in three weeks than she has in three trips come on my beloved we are late!\"\n\n\"We are going then?\"\n\n\"Going where?\"\n\n\"To Europe.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. Think how nice it would be for you to 'pitch a wicked horseshoe,' as dear Tub would say, in Florida.\"\n\n\"Oh, quit it!\"\n\nAs they tramped up-stairs he tucked his arm about her, but she released herself, she smiled at him too brightly—smile glittering and flat as white enamel paint—urbane smile that these twenty years had made him ashamed of his longing for her—and she said, \"We must hurry, lamb.\" And too brightly she added, \"Don't drink too much tonight. It's all right with people like Tub Pearson, but Judge Turpin is so conservative—I know he doesn't like it.\"\n\n*\n\nShe had a high art of deflating him, of enfeebling him, with one quick, innocent-sounding phrase. By the most careless comment on his bulky new overcoat she could make him feel like a lout in it; by crisply suggesting that he \"try for once to talk about something besides motors and stocks,\" while they rode to a formidable dinner to an elocutionary senator, she could make him feel so unintelligent that he would be silent all evening. The easy self-confidence which weeks of industrial triumphs had built up in him she could flatten in five seconds. She was, in fact, a genius at planting in him an assurance of his inferiority. Thus she did tonight, in her nicest and friendliest way, and instantly the lumbering Ajax began to look doubtfully toward the poker he had always enjoyed, to fear the opinion of Judge Turpin—an eye-glassed sparrow of a man who seemed to admire Sam, and who showed his reverence for the law by taking illicit drink for drink with him.\n\nSam felt unworthy and apologetic till he had dressed and been cheered by a glimpse of his daughter, Emily.\n\n*\n\nEmily, as a child, had been his companion; he had always understood her, seemed nearer to her than to Fran. She had been a tomboy, sturdy of shoulder, jolly as an old family dog out on a walk.\n\nHe used to come to the nursery door, lamenting:\n\n\"Milord, the Duke of Buckin'um lies wownded at the gate!\"\n\nEmily and Brent would wail joyously, \"Not seriowsly, I trust,\" and he answer, \"Mortually, I fear.\"\n\nThey had paid him the compliment of being willing to play with him, Emily more than the earnest young Brent.\n\nBut Emily had been drawn, these last five years, into the tempestuous life of young Zenith; dances, movie parties, swimming in summer, astonishingly unrestricted companionship with any number of boys; a life which bewildered Sam. Now, at twenty, she was to be married to Harry McKee, assistant general manager of the Vandering Bolt and Nut Company (considered in Zenith a most genteel establishment), ex-tennis-champion, captain during the Great War, a man of thirty-four who wore his clothes and his slang dashingly. The parties had redoubled, and Sam realized wistfully that Emily and he had no more of their old, easy, chuckling talks.\n\nAs he marched down to supervise the cocktails for dinner, Emily flew in, blown on the storm, crying at him, \"Oh, Samivel, you old beautiful! You look like a grand duke in your dinner jacket! You sweet thing! Damn it, I've got to be at Mary Edge's in twenty minutes!\"\n\nShe galloped up-stairs, and he stood looking after her and sighed.\n\n\"I'd better begin to dig in against the lonely sixties,\" he brooded.\n\nHe shivered as he went out to tell the butler-for-the-evening how to prepare the cocktails, after which, he knew, the butler would prepare them to suit himself, and probably drink most of them.\n\n*\n\nSam remembered that this same matter of a butler for parties only had been the subject of rather a lot of pourparlers between Fran and himself. She wanted a proper butler in the house, always. And certainly they could afford one. But every human being has certain extravagances which he dare not assume, lest he offend the affectionate and jeering friends of his youth—the man who has ventured on spats dares not take to a monocle—the statesman who has ventured on humor dares not be so presumptuous as to venture on honesty also. Somehow, Sam believed that he could not face Tub Pearson if he had anything so effete as a regular butler in the house, and Fran had not won...not yet.\n\n*\n\nTub Pearson—the Hon. Thos. J. Pearson, former state-senator, honorary LL.D. of Winnemac University, president of the Centaur State Bank, director in twelve companies, trustee of the Loring Grammar School and of the Zenith Art Institute, chairman of the Mayor's City Planning Commission—Tub Pearson was still as much the jester as he had been at Yale. He and his lively wife Matilde, known as \"Matey,\" had three children, but neither viceregal honors nor domesticity had overlaid Tub's view of himself as a natural comedian.\n\nAll through the poker-game, at the large table in Sam's library, where they sat with rolled-up sleeves and loosened collars, gurgling their whisky-sodas with gratified sighs, Tub jabbed at Judge Turpin for sentencing bootleggers while he himself enjoyed his whisky as thoroughly as any one in Zenith. When they rested—that is to say, re-filled their glasses—at eleven, and Sam suggested, \"May not have any more poker with you lads for a while, because Fran and I may trot over to Europe for six months or so,\" then Tub had an opportunity suitable to his powers:\n\n\"Six months! That's elegant, Sambo. You'll come back with an English accent: 'Hy sye, hold chappie, cawn't I 'ave the honor of raising the bloomin' pot a couple o' berries, dear old dream?'\"\n\n\"Ever hear an Englishman talk like that?\"\n\n\"No, but you will! Six months! Oh, don't be a damn' fool! Go for two months, and then you'll be able to appreciate getting back to a country where you can get ice and a bath-tub.\"\n\n\"I know it's a heresy,\" Sam drawled, \"but I wonder if there aren't a few bath-tubs in Europe? Think I'll go over and see. My deal.\"\n\nHe did not show it; he played steadily, a rectangular-faced, large man, a cigar gripped in his mouth, cards dwarfed in his wide hand; but he was raging within:\n\n\"I've been doing what people expected me to, all my life. Football in college, when I'd as soon've stuck in the physics laboratory. Make money and play golf and be a good Republican ever since. Human cash-register! I'm finished! I'm going!\"\n\nBut they heard from him only \"Whoop you two more. Cards?\"\n\nChapter 4\n\nIt was late when Sam yawned up to bed, for their poker-game had lasted till after one. The spacious chamber was half lighted from the bathroom. The dusky light caught the yellow silk curtains by her bed, the crystal on her wide dressing-table. She had left the windows closed, and the air was not unpleasantly stuffy with cold cream, powder, and steaminess lingering from a hot bath scented with bath-salts.\n\nHe was eager for her breathing presence. His determination to escape with her had made Fran seem nearer and more desirable than in months, but as he felt guilty about awakening her, he did not admit that he was doing anything so unkind—he merely dropped his shoes loudly.\n\nShe looked startled when she awoke. How many times she had looked startled, a little incredulous, when she had stirred to discover him beside her! She turned on her bedside light, she looked at him vaguely, as though she wasn't quite sure who he was, but, after all, one had to be polite. She was incredibly young and unmarked with wrinkles, a girl in a lace nightgown edged at the neck with white fur.\n\nHe plumped down on the bed beside her, kissed her shoulder. She suffered it, unresponding, and said, too cheerily, \"Please no! Not now. Listen, dear, I want to talk. Ohhhhh, gee, I'm sleepy! I tried to stay awake till you came up, but I dozed off. So 'shamed! But pull up the big chair and listen.\"\n\n\"Don't you want me to kiss you?\"\n\n\"Why do you always ask that? In that hurt way? You're so silly! You know you've had several drinks. Oh, I don't mind—though Tub and you, for men that are responsible citizens and don't really drink at all, always do manage to tuck away a lot too much! I don't mind. But don't you think it's a little icky, this sudden passion for embracing when you're—well, exhilarated?\"\n\n\"Don't you want me to kiss you?\"\n\n\"Good Heavens, my dear man, haven't I been your wife for twenty-two years? Oh, please, dear, don't be quarrelsome! Have I done something to hurt you? I'm so, so terribly sorry! I am, truly, dear. Kiss me!\"\n\nIt was the coolest, most brief of kisses that she gave him and, that chore done, most briskly she rattled, \"Now pull up the big chair and listen, dear. Or would you rather wait till tomorrow?\"\n\nShe added, with the imitation of baby-talk which ordinarily tickled him, \"Is mos' awful' important!\"\n\nHe dragged the wing-chair to her bed and decorously sat down, wagging a varnished pump, but he said testily, \"Good Lord, you don't need to coax. Let's have it.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't be such an old grump! Now I ask you: is that fair? Because I don't like the reek of whisky? Would you like it on my breath?\"\n\n\"No. But I didn't take much. But—Never mind. Listen, Fran. I know what you want. And I've decided. Kynance tried to tie me up with a contract to go to work right away, but I refused. So we'll go to Europe, and maybe for four-five months!\"\n\n\"Oh. That.\"\n\nWith all his experience of her zig-zag incalculability, her shreds of knowledge that seemed to have no source, her ambitions and desires that seemed not worth the pains, her veiled resentment of hurts which he had not meant to inflict, her amiability when he had expected her to be angry, he was surprised now at her indifference.\n\n\"It's more fundamental than going to Europe. See here, Sam. Even if I didn't want to, oh, kiss you—Sorry I don't seem to be more passionate. I wish I were, for your sake. But apparently I'm not. But even so, we have been happy, haven't we! We have built something pretty fine!\"\n\n\"Yes, we have. What's worrying—\"\n\n\"Even if we haven't been wild operatic lovers, I do think we mean something awfully deep and irreplaceable to each other. Don't we?\"\n\nHis touchy ardor gave way to affection. He reached his long arm out and patted her slight, nervous fingers. \"Yes. We differ on a lot of things, but I guess we've got something solid for each other that we can't find in anybody else.\"\n\n\"Something really permanent, Sam? Dependable? So we're like two awfully good friends backing each other in a terrible street fight?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. But what's—\"\n\n\"Listen. We've done the first part of our jobs. We've made enough money. We've brought up the children. You have something to show for your work—this really marvelous car that you've created. And yet we're still young, comparatively. Oh, let's not settle down into contentment with the dregs of life! Let's have a new life, all over, and not worry any more about duties (and I've had my own, young man—if you think it's easy to run a house like this, and entertain everybody!). Let's—oh, it's hard to express it, but I mean: let's not tie ourselves down to saying we'll come back from Europe (but it was sweet of you, dear, to consent without making me beg), but I mean: let's not insist that we have to be back from Europe in four months—yes, or four years! On the other hand, if we don't like it, let's not feel we have to stay; let's take the first boat back. But let's—Oh, please now, get this! Let's start out of this stupid old town without one single solitary plan in our heads beyond landing in Europe, and coming back when we really want to, and going where we please when we please. Maybe we'll be back after two months on the Riviera, and then again, forty years from now, we may be living in a bamboo shack in Java and thumbing our noses at anybody who doesn't like it! Why, I'd almost like to sell this house, so we won't have anything to bind us.\"\n\n\"You're not serious? Good Lord, we couldn't do that! Why, it's our home! Wouldn't know what to do if we didn't have a safe harbor like this to come back to! Why, we've built ourselves into this old place, from the Radiola to the new garage doors. I guess I know every dahlia in the garden by its middle name! I love the place the way I do Emily and you and the boy. Only place where we can slam the door and tell everybody to go to hell and be ourselves!\"\n\n\"But perhaps we'll get us some new selves, without losing the old ones. You'd—oh, you could be so magnificent, so tall and impressive and fine, if you'd let yourself be, if you didn't feel you had to be just an accessory to a beastly old medium-priced car, if you'd get over this silly fear that people might think you were affected and snobbish if you demanded the proper respect from them! There are great people in the world—dukes and ambassadors and generals and scientists and—And I don't believe that essentially they're one bit bigger than we are. It's just that they've been trained to talk of world-affairs, instead of the price of vanadium and what Mrs. Hibbletebibble is going to serve at her Hallowe'en party. I'm going to be one of 'em! I'm not afraid of 'em! If you'd only get over this naive passion for 'simplicity' and all those nice peasant virtues and let yourself be the big man that you really are! Not meekly say to His Excellency that though you look like a grand-duke, you're really only little Sammy Dodsworth of Zenith! He won't know it unless you insist on telling him!...And perhaps an ambassadorship for you, after you've been abroad long enough to learn the tricks...Only to do all that, to grab the world, we must not be bound by the feeling that we're tied to this slow-pokey Zenith till death do us part from the fun of adventuring!\"\n\n\"But to sell the house—\"\n\n\"Oh, we don't need to do that, of course, silly—not at first. I just mean it as an example of how free we ought to be. Of course we wouldn't sell it. Heavens, we may be delighted to slink back here in six months! But don't let's plan to, that's what I mean. Oh, Sam, I'm absolutely not going to let my life be over at forty—well, at forty-one, but no one ever takes me for more than thirty-five or even thirty-three. And life would be over for me if I simply went on forever with the idiotic little activities in this half-baked town! I won't, that's all! You can stay here if you insist, but I'm going to take the lovely things that—I have a right to take them, because I understand them! What do I care whether some club of human, or half-human, tabby-cats in eye-glasses study dietetics or Lithuanian art next year? What do I care whether a pretentious bunch of young millionaire manufacturers have an imitation English polo team?...when I could have the real thing, in England! And yet if we stay here, we'll settle down to doing the same things over and over. We've drained everything that Zenith can give us—yes, and almost everything that New York and Long Island can give us. And in this beastly country—In Europe, a woman at forty is just getting to the age where important men take a serious interest in her. But here, she's a grandmother. The flappers think I'm as venerable as the bishop's wife. And they make me old, with their confounded respectfulness—and their charming rejoicing when I go home from a dance early—I who can dance better, yes, and longer, than any of them—\"\n\n\"Now, now!\"\n\n\"Well, I can! And so could you, if you didn't let business sap every single ounce of energy you have! But at the same time—I only have five or ten more years to continue being young in. It's the derniere cartouche. And I won't waste it. Can't you understand? Can't you understand? I mean it, desperately! I'm begging for life—no, I'm not!—I'm demanding it! And that means something more than a polite little Cook's trip to Europe!\"\n\n\"But see here now! Do you actually mean to tell me, Fran, that you think that just moving from Zenith to Paris is going to change everything in your life and make you a kid again? Don't you realize that probably most people in Paris are about like most people here, or anywhere else?\"\n\n\"They aren't, but even if they were—\"\n\n\"What do you expect out of Europe? A lot of culture?\"\n\n\"No! 'Culture!' I loathe the word, I loathe the people who use it! I certainly do not intend to collect the names of a lot of painters—and of soups—and come back and air them. Heavens, it isn't just Europe! We may not stay there at all. It's being free to wander wherever we like, as long as we like, or to settle down and become part of some community or some set if we like, and not feel that we have a duty to come back here. Oh, I could love you so much more if we weren't a pair of old horses in a treadmill!\"\n\nThey sailed for Southampton in February, three weeks after Emily's wedding.\n\nSam was absorbed in completing the Revelation Company transfer, and in answering Fran when she complained, \"Oh, work's become a disease with you! You go on with it when there's no need. Let the underlings finish up. Dear, it's because I do love you that—Do you think you'll ever learn to enjoy leisure, to enjoy just being yourself and not an office? You're not going to make me feel guilty for having dragged you away, are you?\"\n\n\"By God, I'll enjoy life if it kills me—and it probably will!\" he grumbled. \"You've got to give me time. I've started this business of being 'free' about thirty-five years too late. I'm a good citizen. I've learned that Life is real and Life is earnest and the presidency of a corporation is its goal. What would I be doing with anything so degenerate as enjoying myself?\"\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe S. S. Ultima, thirty-two thousand tons burden, was four hours out of New York. As the winter twilight glowered on the tangle of gloomy waves, Samuel Dodsworth was aware of the domination of the sea, of the insignificance of the great ship and all mankind. He felt lost in the round of ocean, one universal gray except for a golden gash on the western horizon. His only voyaging had been on lakes, or on the New York ferries. He felt uneasy as he stood at the after rail and saw how the rearing mass of the sea loomed over the ship and threatened it when the stern dipped—down, unbelievably down, as though she were sinking. But he felt resolute again, strong and very happy, as he swung about the deck. He had been sickish only for the first hour. The wind filled his chest, exhilarated him. Only now, the messy details of packing and farewells over, and the artificially prolonged waving to friends on the dock endured, did he feel that he was actually delivered from duty, actually going—going to strange-colored, exciting places, to do unknown and heroic things.\n\nHe hummed (for Kipling meant something to Sam Dodsworth which no Shelley could, nor Dante)—he hummed \"The Gipsy Trail\":\n\nFollow the Romany patteran\n\nNorth where the blue bergs sail,\n\nAnd the bows are gray with the frozen spray,\n\nAnd the masts are shod with mail.\n\nFollow the Romany patteran\n\nWest to the sinking sun,\n\nTill the junk-sails lift through the houseless drift,\n\nAnd the East and the West are one.\n\nFollow the Romany patteran\n\nEast where the silence broods\n\nBy a purple wave on an opal beach\n\nIn the hush of the Mahim woods.\n\n\"Free!\" he muttered.\n\nHe stopped abruptly by the line of windows enclosing the music-room, forward on the promenade deck, as he fumbled for the memory of the first time he had ever sung \"The Gipsy Trail.\"\n\nIt must have been when the poem was first set to music. Anyway, Fran and he had been comparatively poor. The money that old Herman Voelker had lent them had gone into the business. (A sudden, meaningless spatter of snow, out on that cold sea. How serene the lights in the music room! He began to feel the gallant security of the ship, his enduring home.) Yes, it was when they had gone off on a vacation—no chauffeur then, nor suites at the best hotels, but Sam driving all day in their shabby Revelation, with sleep in an earth-scented, wind-stirred tent. They had driven West—west, two thousand miles toward the sunset, till it seemed they must indeed come on the Pacific and junk-sails lifting against the misted sun. They had no responsibilities of position. Together they chanted \"The Gipsy Trail,\" vowing that some day they would wander together—\n\nAnd they were doing it!\n\nSuch exultation filled him, such overwhelming tenderness, that he wanted to dash down to their cabin and assure himself that he still had the magic of Fran's companionship. But he remembered with what irritable efficiency she had been unpacking. He had been married for over twenty years. He stayed on deck.\n\n*\n\nHe explored the steamer. It was to him, the mechanic, the most sure and impressive mechanism he had ever seen; more satisfying than a Rolls, a Delauney-Belleville, which to him had been the equivalents of a Velasquez. He marveled at the authoritative steadiness with which the bow mastered the waves; at the powerful sweep of the lines of the deck and the trim stowing of cordage. He admired the first officer, casually pacing the bridge. He wondered that in this craft which was, after all, but a floating iron egg-shell, there should be the roseate music room, the smoking-room with its Tudor fireplace—solid and terrestrial as a castle—and the swimming-pool, green-lighted water washing beneath Roman pillars. He climbed to the boat deck, and some never realized desire for sea-faring was satisfied as he looked along the sweep of gangways, past the huge lifeboats, the ventilators like giant saxophones, past the lofty funnels serenely dribbling black woolly smoke, to the forward mast. The snow-gusts along the deck, the mysteriousness of this new world but half seen in the frosty lights, only stimulated him. He shivered and turned up his collar, but he was pricked to imaginativeness, standing outside the wireless room, by the crackle of messages springing across bleak air-roads ocean-bounded to bright snug cities on distant plains.\n\n\"I'm at sea!\"\n\n*\n\nHe tramped down to tell Fran—he was not quite sure what it was that he wanted to tell her, save that steamers were very fine things indeed, and that ahead of them, in the murk of the horizon, they could see the lanes of England.\n\nShe, in their cabin with its twin brass beds, its finicking imitations of gray-blue French prints on the paneled walls, was amid a litter of shaken-out frocks, heaps of shoes, dressing gowns, Coty powder, three gift copies of \"The Perennial Bachelor,\" binoculars, steamer letters, steamer telegrams, the candy and the Charles & Company baskets of overgrown fruit and tiny conserves with which they were to help out the steamer's scanty seven meals a day, his dress-shirts (of which he was to, and certainly would not, put on a fresh one every evening), and French novels (which she was to, and certainly wouldn't, read in a stately, aloof, genteel manner every day on deck).\n\n\"It's terrible!\" she lamented. \"I'll get things put away just about in time for landing...Oh, here's a wireless from Emily, the darling, from California. Harry and she seem to be standing the honeymoon about as well as most victims.\"\n\n\"Chuck the stuff. Come out on deck. I love this ship. It's so—Man certainly has put it over Nature for once! I think I could've built ships! Come out and see it.\"\n\n\"You do sound happy. I'm glad. But I must unpack. You skip along—\"\n\nIt was not often, these years, that he was kittenish, but now he picked her up, while she kicked and laughed, he lifted her over a pile of sweaters and tennis shoes and bathing-suits and skates, kissed her, and shouted, \"Come on! It's our own honeymoon! Eloping! Have I ever remembered to tell you that I adore you? Come up and see some ocean with me. There's an awful lot of ocean around this ship...Oh, damn the unpacking!\"\n\nHe sounded masterful, but it was always a satisfaction, when he was masterful, to have her consent to be mastered. He was pleased now when she stopped being efficient about this business of enjoying life, and consented to do something for no reason except that it was agreeable.\n\nIn her shaggy Burberry, color of a dead maple leaf, and her orange tam o' shanter, she suggested autumn days and brown uplands. She was a girl; certainly no mother of a married daughter. He was cumbersomely proud of her, of the glances which the men passengers snatched at her as they swung round the deck.\n\n\"Funny how it comes over a fellow suddenly—I mean—this is almost the first time we've ever really started out like lovers—no job to call us back. You were dead right, Fran—done enough work—now we'll live! Together—always! But I'll have so much to learn, to keep up with you. You, and Europe! Hell, I'm so sentimental! D'you mind? Just come out of state prison! Did twenty years!\"\n\nRound and round the deck. The long stretch on the starboard side, filthy with deck chairs, with rug-wadded passengers turning a pale green as the sea rose, with wind-ruffled magazines, cups left from teatime, and children racing with toy carts. The narrow passage aft, where the wind swooped on them, pushing them back, and the steamer dipped so that they had to labor up-hill, bending forward, their limbs of lead. But, as they toiled, a glimpse of ship mysteries that were stirring to land-bound imaginations. They looked down into a hatchway—some one said there were half a dozen Brazilian cougars being shipped down there—and along a dizzy aerial gangway to the after deck and the wheelhouse and a lone light in the weaving darkness. They saw the last glimmer of the streaky wake stretching back to New York.\n\nThen, blown round the corner, released from climbing upward, a dash along the cold port side, blessedly free of steamer chairs and of lardy staring. Swinging at five miles an hour. The door of the smoking-room, with a whiff of tobacco smoke, a pleasant reek of beer, a sound of vocal Americans. The place where the deck widened into an alcove—thick walls of steel, dotted with lines of rivets smeared with thick white paint—and the door of the stewards' pantry from which, in the afternoon, came innumerable sandwiches and cakes and cups and pots of tea. The double door to the main stairway, where, somehow, a stewardess in uniform was always talking to a steward. The steel-gripped windows of the music room, with a glimpse of unhappy young-old women, accompanying their mothers abroad, sitting flapping through magazines. Where the deck was unenclosed, the yellow scoured rail and the white stanchions, bright in the deck light, brighter against the dark coil of sea. Always before them, the long straight lines of the decking planks, rigid as bars of music, divided by seams of glistening tar. Deck—ship—at sea!\n\nThen forward, and the people along the rail—bold voyagers facing the midwinter Atlantic through glass windows—honeymooners quickly unclasping as the pestiferous deck-circlers passed—aged and sage gentlemen commenting on the inferiority of the steerage passengers who, on the deck below, altogether innocent of being condescendingly observed by the gentry-by-right-of-passage-money, jigged beside a tarpaulin-covered hatch to the pumping music of an accordion, and blew blithely on frosted fingers.\n\nAnd round all over again, walking faster, turning from casual pedestrians into competitors in the ocean marathon. Faster. Cutting corners more sharply. Superior to thrusting wind, to tilting deck. Gaining on that lone, lean, athletic girl, and passing her...\n\n\"That's the way to walk! Say, Fran, I wonder if sometime we couldn't get away from hotels and sort of take a walking-trip along the Riviera—interesting, I should think...Darling!\"\n\nGaining on but never quite passing that monocle-flashing, tweed-coated man whom they detested on sight and who, within three days, was to prove the simplest and heartiest of acquaintances.\n\nA racing view of all their companions of the voyage, their fellow-citizens in this brave village amid the desert of waters: strangers to be hated on sight, to be snubbed lest they snub first, yet presently to be known better and better loved and longer remembered than neighbors seen for a lifetime on the cautious land.\n\nTheir permanent home, for a week; to become more familiar, thanks to the accelerated sensitiveness which is the one blessing of travel, than rooms paced for years. Every stippling of soot on the lifeboats, every chair in the smoking-room, every table along one's own aisle in the dining salon, to be noted and recalled, in an exhilarated and heightened observation.\n\n\"I do feel awfully well,\" said Sam, and Fran: \"So do I. So long since we've walked together like this! And we'll keep it up; we won't get caught by people. But I must arise now and go to Innisfree and finish the unpacking of the nine bean rows oh why did I bring so many clothes! Till dressing-time—my dear!\"\n\n*\n\nHe was first dressed for dinner. She had decided, after rather a lot of conversation about it, that the belief that our better people do not dress for dinner on the first night out was a superstition. He sauntered up to the smoking-room for his first cocktail aboard, feeling very glossy and handsome and much-traveled. Then he was feeling very lonely, for the smoking-room was filled with amiable-looking people who apparently all knew one another. And he knew nobody aboard save Fran.\n\n\"That's the one trouble. I'm going to miss Tub and Doc Hazzard and the rest horribly,\" he brooded. \"I wish they were along! Then it would be about perfect.\"\n\nHe was occupying an alcove with a semi-circular leather settee, before a massy table. The room was crowded, and a square-rigged Englishman, blown into the room with a damp whiff of sea air, stopped at Sam's table asking abruptly, \"Mind if I sit here?\"\n\nThe Englishman ordered his cocktail with competence:\n\n\"Now be very careful about this, steward. I want half Booth gin and half French vermouth, and just four drops of orange bitters, and no Italian vermouth, remember, no Italian vermouth.\" As the Englishman gulped his drink, Sam enjoyed hating him. The man was perfectly expressionless, like a square-headed wooden idol, colored like an idol of cedar wood. \"Supercilious as the devil. Never would be friendly, not till he'd known you ten years. Well, he needn't worry! I'm not going to speak to him! Curious how an Englishman like that can make you feel that you're small and skinny and your tie's badly tied without even looking at you! Well, he—\"\n\nThe Englishman spoke, curtly:\n\n\"Decent weather, for a February crossing.\"\n\n\"Is it? I don't really know. Never crossed before.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"You've crossed often?\"\n\n\"Oh, perhaps twenty times. I was with the British War Mission during the late argument. They were always chasing me across. Lockert's my name. I'm growing cocoa down in British Guiana now. Hot there! Going to stay in London?\"\n\n\"I think so, for a while. I'm on an indefinite vacation.\"\n\nSam had the American yearning to become acquainted, to tell all about his achievements, not as boasting but to establish himself as a worthy fellow.\n\n\"I've been manufacturing motor cars—the Revelation—thought it was about time to quit and find out what the world was like. Dodsworth is my name.\"\n\n\"Pleased to meet you.\" (Like most Europeans, Lockert believed that all Americans of all classes always said \"Pleased to meet you,\" and expected so to be greeted in turn.) \"Revelation? Jolly good car. Had one in Kent. My cousin—live with him when I'm home—bouncing old retired general—he's dotty over motors. Roars around on a shocking old motor bike—mustache and dignity flying in the morning breeze—atrocious bills for all the geese and curates he runs over. He's insanely pro-American—am myself, except for your appalling ice water. Have another cocktail?\"\n\nIn twenty minutes, Sam and Major Clyde Lockert had agreed that the \"labor turnover\" was too high, that driving by night into the brilliance of headlights was undesirable, that Bobby Jones was a player of golf, and that they themselves were men of the world and cheery companions.\n\n\"I'll meet lots of people. And I like this ship. This is the greatest day of my life—next to my marriage, of course,\" Sam gloated, as the second dinner gong flooded the ship with waves of hysterical sound and he marched out to rouse Fran from her mysterious activities.\n\nThere was awaiting him in his cabin a wireless from Tub Pearson:\n\nBON VOYAGE STOP LONDON SURE SEE MY NEPHEW JACK STARLING AMERICAN EMBASSY LIVING GEORGIAN HOUSE STOP DONT RAISE ON BOBTAILED STRAIGHTS WISH WITH YOU TUB.\n\nHe wondered about introducing Major Lockert to Fran.\n\nHe was never able to guess how she would receive the people whom he found in the alley and proudly dragged in to her. Business men whom he regarded as upstanding and vigorous, she often pronounced dull; European visitors whom he found elegant, she was likely to call \"not quite the real thing\"; and men whom he had doubtfully presented to her as worthy but rather mutton-headed, she had been known to consider fine and very sensitive. And for all her theoretical desire to make their house a refuge for him and for whomever he liked to invite, she had never learned to keep her opinions of people to herself. When she was bored by callers, she would beg \"Do you mind if I run up to bed now—such a headache,\" with a bright friendliness which fooled no one save herself, and which left their guests chilled and awkward.\n\nWould she find Lockert heavy?\n\nWhile they sat in the music room over after-dinner coffee, with a dance beginning in the cleared space, Lockert came ambling up to them.\n\n\"Mr. Lockert—my wife,\" Sam mumbled.\n\nLockert's stolidity did not change as he bowed, as he sat down in answer to a faint invitation, but Sam noted that his pale blue eyes came quickly alive and searched Fran with approval...Fran's lovely pallor, in a robe de style such as only her slenderness could bear.\n\nSam settled back with his cigar and let them talk. To him, always, the best talk was no brilliance of his own, but conversation that amused Fran and drew her out of her silken sulkiness.\n\n\"You've been long in America, Mr. Lockert?\"\n\n\"Not this time. I've been living in British Guiana—plantation—no soda for your whisky, and always the chance of finding a snake curled up in your chair on the verandah—nice big snakes, all striped, very handsome and friendly—don't seem to get used to 'em.\"\n\nLockert spoke to her not with such impersonal friendliness as he had for Sam, not with the bored dutifulness which most men in Zenith showed toward any woman over a flapperish eighteen, but a concentration, an eagerness in the presence of attractive women, an authentic need for women, which seemed to flatter Fran and to rouse her, yet make her timid. She had first looked at Lockert with metallic courtesy. \"Here was another of those ponderous business men that Sam was always dragging around.\" Now she concentrated on him, she forgot Sam, and murmured youthfully:\n\n\"It sounds dreadful. And yet so exciting! I think I should be glad of a nice striped snake, for a change! I'm terribly fed up with the sound, safe American cities where you never find anything in your chair more thrilling than the morning paper. I think I'll go look for snakes!\"\n\n\"Are you going East?\"\n\n\"Don't know. Isn't it nice! No plans beyond London.\"\n\n\"You'll stay in London a bit?\"\n\n\"Yes, if there aren't too many Americans there. Why is it that the travelling American is such a dreadful person? Look at those ghastly people at that second table there—no, just beyond the pillar—father with horn-rimmed spectacles, certain to be talking about either Coolidge or Prohibition—earnest mother in home-made frock out to hunt down Culture and terribly grim about it—daughter with a voice like a file. Why is it?\"\n\n\"And why is it that you Americans, the nice ones, are so much more snobbish than the English?\"\n\nShe gasped, and Sam awaited a thunderbolt, which did not come. Lockert was calm and agreeable, and she astonishingly bent to his domination with a puzzled: \"Are we, really?\"\n\n\"Appallingly! I know only two classes of people who hate their own race—or tribe or nation or whatever you care to call it—who travel principally to get away from their own people, who never speak of them except with loathing, who are pleased not to be taken as belonging to them. That is, the Americans and the Jews!\"\n\n\"Oh, come now, that's idiotic! I'm as proud of being—No! That's so. Partly. You're right. Why is it?\"\n\n\"I suppose it's because your boosters go so much to the other extreme, talking about 'God's Country'\"\n\n\"But that expression is never used any more.\"\n\n\"It isn't? Anyway: 'greatest country on earth' and 'we won the war.' And your ghastly city-boosting tours and Elks' conventions—people like you hate this bellowing. And then I do think the English have, as you would say, 'put something over on you'—\"\n\n\"I've never used the phrase!\"\n\n\"—by sitting back and quietly assuming that we're the noblest and rightest people on earth. And if any man or any nation has the courage or the magnificent egotism to do that long enough, almost every one will accept it from him. Oh, the English are essentially more insufferable than the Americans—\"\n\n\"But not so noisy about it,\" mused Fran.\n\nSam was not at all sure that he liked this discussion.\n\n*\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" said Lockert; \"though if there's anything noisier than the small even voice with which an Englishman can murmur, 'Don't be so noisy, my dear fellow—!' Physically, it may carry only a yard, but spiritually it rings clear up through the Heavens! And I'll be hearing it, now that I've become a Colownial. Even my cousin—I was speaking to your husband about him—absolute fanatic about motor transport—I'm to stay with him in Kent. And he'll be pleasant to me, and gently rebuking—And he's rather a decent old thing—General Herndon.\"\n\n\"General Lord Herndon? Of the Italian drive?\" said Fran.\n\n\"Yes. You see, my revered great-grandfather did so well out of cotton that he was rewarded with a peerage.\"\n\n\"And you're so proud of it! That's why you enjoy your mock humility. You had a quite American thrill in admitting that your cousin is a lordship. It's bunk—I mean, it's nonsense, the British assertion that only Americans take titles seriously. You have as much satisfaction out of not calling your cousin 'Lord' as—\"\n\n\"As any charming American woman would out of calling him 'Lord'!\"\n\nShe seemed helpless against Lockert's bland impertinence; she seemed to enjoy being bullied; she admitted, \"Yes, perhaps,\" and they smiled at each other.\n\n\"But seriously,\" said Lockert, \"you'll be more English than I am, after you've lived there a year. I've knocked about so much in South America and Colorado and Ceylon that I'm merely a tramp. Jungle rat.\"\n\n\"You really think so—that I'll become English?\" She was unguardedly frank, she the ever-guarded.\n\n\"Quite...I say, may I have this dance?\"\n\nLockert, for all his squareness—he was as solid and ungraceful-looking as his favorite mutton-chop—danced easily. Sam drooped in his chair and watched them.\n\n\"Nice she has somebody to play with already,\" he insisted.\n\nAnd within three days she had a dozen men to \"play with,\" to dance and argue with, and race with around the deck. But always it was Lockert who assumed that he was her patron, who looked over her new acquaintances one by one, and was not at all shy about giving his verdict on them. She became helplessly angry at his assumptions, and he apologized so affably and so insincerely that she enjoyed quarreling with him for hours at a time, snuggled in a steamer robe on deck. And when Lockert and she found that they were both devoted to dogs and they became learned about wire-haired terriers, Sam leaned back listening as though she were his clever daughter.\n\nBetween times she was gayer with him and more affectionate than she had been for years; and day by day the casualness suitable to a manufacturer like Sam broke down into surprising, uncharted emotions.\n\nChapter 6\n\nOn their last day out—they were due in Southampton at noon, tomorrow—there was on the Ultima all the kindly excitement, all the anticipation and laughter, of the day before Christmas. When the Dodsworths came up to the smoking-room for their cocktail before dinner they were welcomed by the dozen people whom Lockert, the mixer of the voyage, had attracted to the round table in the center of the room.\n\nWhat delightful people! Sam glowed; what a pleasure to travel with them: Lockert, the stolidly loquacious English adventurer; the jolly and vulgar little Jewish millinery buyer from Denver, who was quite the cleverest man aboard; Lechintsky, the pianist; Colonel Endersley, American military attache at Constantinople; Sally O'Leary, the satiny movie actress, whose real name was Gwendolyn Alcovar; kindly and ruminating old Professor Deakins, the Assyriologist; Max Ristad, the Norwegian aviator; Pierce Pattison, the New York banker.\n\n\"Come on, you're late!\" and \"Sit down here; I've had mine,\" and \"We missed you!\" they cried. They were as friendly as a college reunion, as free of jealousy, and just as undiscriminating.\n\nThe Jewish buyer had two new anecdotes (against his own race, naturally), and they flowed down to dinner in a group.\n\nThe Captain's Dinner on the Ultima occurred on the last night of the voyage, and much was made of it. The dining salon was draped in scarlet, the stewards were in red hunting-coats, champagne was served at the expense of the Line. Even prohibitionists were betrayed into smiles which indicated that they wanted to keep up the friendships of this halcyon week. Toasts were drunk from table to table, with many bows, and the large Seattle contractor, who always overdid everything, threw confetti, and tonight no one minded his alcoholic philanthropy. The Comtesse de Val Montique, who had been born in Chicago, who owned nine million dollars, two chateaux, and part of a beautifully varnished husband, who crossed the ocean regularly twice a year and was so aristocratic that she had for friends only her servants, was moved tonight to look amiable as people passed her table. And the old captain, his beard like a whisk broom, went about the room patting shoulders and chuckling, \"You cross again with Papa, eh?\"\n\n*\n\nSam was raised to a quivering sensitiveness toward all of them. He was not drunk, certainly, but after two cocktails, half a bottle of champagne, and a cognac or two, he was released from his customary caution, his habitual concentration on his own affairs. He was excited by their merriment at first; then it seemed to him pitiful that all of them, and he himself, should so rarely cease thus their indignant assertion of the importance of their own little offices and homes and learnings, and let themselves rejoice in friendliness. They seemed to him like children, excitedly playing now, but soon to be caught by weary maturity. He felt a little the lacrimae rerum of the whole world. He wanted to weep over the pride of the waiters as—the one moment on the voyage when they were important and beautiful and to be noticed—they bore in the platters of flaming ice cream. He wanted to weep over the bedraggled small-town bride who for the moment forgot that she had not found honeymooning quite so glorious, nor the sea so restful. And he saw as pitiful the fact that Fran expected to find youth again merely by changing skies.\n\nAll the while he looked as little sentimental as possible, the large, grave man plodding through the courses.\n\n*\n\nThat was the great dance of the trip, with Japanese lanterns making the starboard deck curiously like the verandah of the Kennepoose Canoe Club, years and years ago, when he had found Fran. But he did not explain it to her. He couldn't. He said, \"I adore you! You look mighty well in that gold and ivory dress.\" He had, indeed, little chance for sentimental explanations. No flapper aboard had more partners than Fran; certainly none danced so smoothly. Lockert was proprietorially about her, always, and to Sam he snapped, \"Want to have you at Lord Herndon's for a week-end, if you'll come, and I'd like to show you a bit of London. We'll dine at Claridge's.\"\n\nSam was not at all sure that Lockert would do anything of the kind; he suspected that Lockert could forget people as quickly as he picked them up; yet it gave him a feeling of belonging a little to England. And there was Tub Pearson's nephew at the American Embassy, and of course Hurd, the manager of the London Revelation agency. He belonged!\n\nHe was emboldened to ask for a dance with Sally O'Leary, the movie queen who had made seduction famous.\n\n\"I'm not much good at this,\" he grumbled, as the steamer rolled and they struggled to dance up-hill. \"You ought to be dancing with one of these young fellows.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly! You're a lovely partner. You're a man, not one of these gigolos, or whatever the damn' word is. If you didn't have such a lovely wife, I'd probably lay my head on your lovely big chest and ask you to go out to Hollywood and kill a coupla lovely beauty-parlor cowboys for me!\"\n\nHe was pleased to believe that she meant it. His heightened sensitiveness, his wistful perception of the loneliness of the world, was gone in a boisterous well-being. When he danced with Fran and she dutifully pointed out his roughness, he laughed. Always she had a genius for keeping herself superior to him by just the right comment on his clumsiness, the most delicate and needle-pointed comparison of him with defter men. But tonight he chuckled, \"I'm no Nijinsky, but I'm enjoying myself so much that even you can't make me mad!\" He whirled her again, mercilessly; he slid gloatingly down the long deck, and marched her back to their table.\n\nAnd, when Fran assured him they needed no more wine, there were joyful invasions of the smoking-room, where tablefuls of the shamelessly happy greeted him, \"Come sit down!\"\n\nThey liked him! He was Somebody! Not just as the president of the Revelation but in himself, in whatever surroundings!\n\nHe did sit down; he wandered from table to table in an ecstasy of friendliness...which became a little blurred, a little dizzy...But they were the best company he'd ever known, everybody on board, all of 'em...But he'd better watch out; he was slightly lit...But they were the best folks— He went out on deck, to clear his head; he swayed up to the boat deck. Then he stood fixed, and all his boisterousness vanished in a high, thin, clear ecstasy.\n\nOn the horizon was a light, stationary, on land, after these days of shifting waters and sliding hulls. He waited to be certain. Yes! It was a lighthouse, swinging its blade of flame. They had done it, they had fulfilled the adventure, they had found their way across the blind immensity and, the barren sea miles over, they had come home to England. He did not know (he never knew) whether the light was on Bishop's Rock or the English mainland, but his released imagination saw the murkiness to northward there as England itself. Mother England! Land of his ancestors; land of the only kings who, to an American schoolboy, had been genuine monarchs—Charles I and Henry VIII and Victoria; not a lot of confusing French and German rulers. Land where still, for the never quite matured Sammy Dodsworth, Coeur de Lion went riding, the Noir Faineant went riding, to rescue Ivanhoe, where Oliver Twist still crept through evil alleys, where Falstaff's belly-laugh discommoded the godly, where Uncle Ponderevo puffed and mixed, where Jude wavered by dusk across the moorland, where Old Jolyon sat with quiet eyes, in immortality more enduring than human life. And his own people—he had lost track of them, but he had far-off cousins in Wiltshire, in Durham. And all of them there—in a motor boat he could be ashore in half an hour! Perhaps there was a town just off there—He saw it, from pictures in Punch and the Illustrated London News, from Cruikshank illustrations of his childhood.\n\nA seaside town: a crescent of flat-faced houses, the brass-sheathed door of a select pub and, countrywards, a governess-cart creeping among high hedges to a village green, a chalky hill with Roman earthworks up to which panted the bookish vicar beside a white-mustached ex-proconsul who had ruled jungles and maharajahs and lost temples where peacocks screamed.\n\nMother England! Home!\n\n*\n\nHe dashed down to Fran. He had to share it with her. For all his training in providing suitable company for her and then not interrupting his betters, he burst through her confidences as Lockert and she stood aloof from the dance. He seized her shoulder and rumbled, \"Light ahead! We're there! Come up on the top deck. Oh, hell, never mind a coat! Just a second, to see it!\"\n\nHis insistence bore Fran away, and with her alone, unchaperoned by that delightful Major Lockert, he stood huddled by a lifeboat, in his shirtsleeves, his dress coat around her, looking at the cheery wink of the light that welcomed them.\n\nThey had full five minutes of romancing and of tenderness before Lockert came along, placidly bumbling that they would catch cold...that they would find Kent an estimable county...that Dodsworth must never make the mistake of ordering his street-boots and his riding-boots from the same maker.\n\n*\n\nThe smell of London is a foggy smell, a sooty smell, a coal-fire smell, yet to certain wanderers it is more exhilarating, more suggestive of greatness and of stirring life, than springtime hillsides or the chill sweetness of autumnal nights; and that unmistakable smell, which men long for in rotting perfumes along the Orinoco, in the greasy reek of South Chicago, in the hot odor of dusty earth among locust-buzzing Alberta wheatfields, that luring breath of the dark giant among cities, reaches halfway to Southampton to greet the traveler. Sam sniffed at it, uneasily, restlessly, while he considered how strange was the British fashion of having railway compartments instead of an undivided car with a nice long aisle along which you could observe ankles, magazines, Rotary buttons, clerical collars, and all the details that made travel interesting.\n\nAnd the strangeness of having framed pictures of scenery behind the seats; of having hand straps—the embroidered silk covering so rough to the finger tips, the leather inside so smooth and cool—beside the doors. And the greater strangeness of admitting that these seats were more comfortable than the flinty Pullman chairs of America. And of seeing outside, in the watery February sunshine, not snow-curdled fields but springtime greenness; pollarded willows and thatched roofs and half-timbered facades—\n\nJust like in the pictures! England!\n\nLike most people who have never traveled abroad, Sam had not emotionally believed that these \"foreign scenes\" veritably existed; that human beings really could live in environments so different from the front yards of Zenith suburbs; that Europe was anything save a fetching myth like the Venusberg. But finding it actually visible, he gave himself up to grasping it as enthusiastically as, these many years, he had given himself to grinding out motor cars.\n\nChapter 7\n\nNot the charge and roaring of the huge red busses, not the glimpse of Westminster's towers beside the Thames, not the sight of the pale tall houses of Carlton House Terrace, so much delighted Sam and proved to him that incredibly he was in London as did a milk cart on its afternoon delivery—that absurd little cart, drawn by a pony, with the one big brassy milk container, instead of a truck filled with precise bottles.\n\n\"That certainly is old-fashioned!\" he muttered in the taxicab, greatly content.\n\nThey planned to stay at the Berkeley, but when Sam stood at the booking-desk, making himself as large and impassive and traveled-looking as possible, and said casually, \"I'd like a suite,\" the clerk remarked, \"Very sorry, sir—full up.\"\n\n\"But we wirelessed for reservations!\" snapped Fran.\n\n\"Come to think of it, I forgot all about sending the radio,\" said Sam, looking apologetically at the clerk, apologizing for the rudeness of Fran, his child.\n\nShe breathed quickly, angrily, but never yet had she quarreled with him in public.\n\n\"You might try the Savoy, sir. Or the Ritz—just across Piccadilly,\" the clerk suggested.\n\nThey drooped back to the taxicab waiting with their luggage, feeling unwelcome, and when they were safely inside the car, she opened up:\n\n\"I do think you might have remembered to send that wireless, considering that you had absolutely nothing else to do aboard—except drink! When I did all the packing and—Sam, do you ever realize that it really wouldn't injure your titanic industrial mind if you were occasionally just the least little bit thoughtful toward me, if you didn't leave absolutely everything about the house and traveling for me to do? I don't think it was very nice of you! And I'm so tired, after the customs and—\"\n\n\"Hell! I suppose you got the tickets to Europe! I suppose you got our passports—\"\n\n\"No. Your secretary did! I'm afraid you don't get any vast credit for that, my dear man!\"\n\nThat was all the family scene for which they had time before they disembarked at the Ritz, but Fran was able to keep up quite a high level of martyrdom and bad temper, for the Ritz was nearly full, also, and they could not have a suite till the next day. Tonight, Fran had to endure a mere double bedroom with a private bath.\n\n\"I suppose,\" she stormed, \"that I'm expected to spend my entire time "
