        "text": "I have gone through Mahathir’s prime ministership and have seen the massive development of infrastructures that he planned and executed. Whenever I am at KLIA (Kuala Lumpur International Airport), I think of Mahathir, whenever at Petronas KLCC, I think of Mahathir and I thank Mahathir whenever I am travelling on the North-South Highway.\n\nThe facilities on this highway are first-class. The toilets are clean and well maintained, better than those at KLIA. I just travelled from KL to Johor Bahru back to KL and up to Alor Star and Penang and back again to KL yesterday. I have nothing but praise for PLUS which manages the highway.\n\nI think about Mahathir, Malaysia’s fourth Prime Minister, when I am surfing the internet and blogging. Gosh, I think of Mahathir most of the time!\n\nSo I read his blog today on his response to his successor’s scathing attack on his supposedly spendthriftiness! His sarcasm is brilliant; (reproduced in full below).\n\nWhen do I think of Abdullah Badawi? Hardly, I must admit, or rather I’d like to just push him to the most distant fringes of the universe of my mind.\n\nTo be fair though, there is a couple of things which he mooted that I appreciate like the National Cancer Hospital, a humongous yellow building in Putrajaya, ostensibly in memory of his first wife who died of breast cancer in 2003. Then his late formation of Malaysian Anti-Corruption Council (MACC) just before his stepping down.\n\nOn the whole, his tenure was a huge letdown. Instead of curbing corruption, he seemed to have systematised it. He dealt directly with businessmen and contractors, signing off approvals without checking with the executives and when pointed out that certain procedures needed to be adhered to, to ensure transparency and check and balance, he labelled those executives as “LITTLE NAPOLEONs”!\n\nOne senior civil servant opined that almost 50% of fund under the then five-year Malaysia Plan’s total allocation could have been wasted due to this kind of unchecked direct dealings and fast prime ministerial approvals. What kind of thriftiness is this?\n\nYes, he gave the impression that he was the BIG NAPOLEON, good lord! he will never come close to be compared to Napoleon in terms of mental acuteness. His degree in ‘religious studies” makes him think that he could manage and control people “fatwa” style. No wonder he lost big in the 12GE.\n\nThe most memorable features of Abdullah Badawi (or Bodohwi), the 5th PM, are his sleeping on the job and his habitual lateness at official functions. When he was supposed to come at 9am, he turned up at 12 noon! He virtually had no respect for other peoples’ time. I had ever missed a flight for an important company meeting in Singapore due to his tardiness.\n\nAnother irritating aspect was his long-winded rhetorics, substanceless, uninspiring and delivered sermons like.\n\nHis dismantling of his predecessors’ projects appeared vengeful rather than thoughtful and is well described by Tun Mahathir in his blog. It is sad to to see the truncated monorail, still standing as uncompleted structures in Putrajaya. That rail system would have solved the traffic congestion and parking problems in and around the massive government complex.\n\nBut this slow witted man would rather give the money to build what he called “towering individuals”. One of the individuals he created was his own brother who was given a 25-year contract to cater food for MAS (Malaysia Airlines) at an exorbitant rate. Another is his son-in-law, that Oxford trained man who never have to “work” in his life. Yet another is his sister- in – law with her hotel business.\n\n“Mr Clean” as he was labelled before he became PM , curbing corruption? I would say “Balderdash, Bodohwi! You truly fooled us”.\n\nThis is the kind of leader UMNO (United Malay National Organisation) gets and sadly we Malaysians get, through that flawed system of “NO CONTEST” for its President’s post.\n\nPrecisely, Abdullah Badawi is a forgettable glorified politician.\n\n“Quote:\n\nADVICE THAT WILL BANKRUPT THE NATION\n\n1. I am happy that Tun Abdullah has explained that he did not write about how the nation would be bankrupt if he had followed my advice. It was the interviewer.\n\n2. I hope he does not mind my clearing my name over what the interviewer wrote in “The Awakening”. Yes, I agree that I was a spendthrift Prime Minister who finished all the government money building the North South Expressway, Penang Bridge, West Port, KLIA, Putrajaya, Cyberjaya and an assortment of others.\n\n3. Had Tun Abdullah succeeded me earlier all these would be stopped to save Malaysia from bankruptcy. As it is, he managed to stop the crooked bridge and therailway double-tracking and electrification project.\n\n4. The bridge would have cost just under 1 billion Ringgit. The cancellation cost the Government 200 million Ringgit in compensation and unfinished work.\n\n5. The railway project from Johor Bahru to Padang Besar was going to cost 14 billion Ringgit – slightly more than 2 billion per year for six years. Fourteen billion Ringgit was saved. But then it was found necessary to build the electrified double track from Ipoh to Padang Besar. The cost is 12 billion Ringgit.\n\n6. A contract was given to a foreign company to build the track from Seremban to Gemas. I don’t know what it cost. Looks like the 14 billion saved was spent on very much shorter tracks, about one-third in length.\n\n7. Still there must have been a lot of money saved. The small jet I used was good only for the Deputy Prime Minister. A big jet was bought not through the usual channels but by some private individual. There was denial by the Government that the A320 was bought for the use by the Prime Minister. But the aircraft is even today used by the Prime Minister. Wonder why the deal was struck. Who really owns the aircraft? How much money has been saved by the Government from this deal?\n\n8. Then there were these corridors to be developed. Each would cost 70 billion Ringgit. Then it is learnt that the allocation include private sector investments. Before Government budget is about how the Government will spend Government money. Under Tun Abdullah the Government budgets for the private sector to spend. But that’s allright because the figures look good.\n\n9. However since none of the corridors took off, billions were saved.\n\n10. It must have been a very rich Government which went for the 12th General Election. Sadly the people did not appreciate the billions that were saved. They rejected the Government party, giving 5 states and one federal territory to the opposition, and just a small majority to the thrifty party.\n\n11. Just imagine how many billions more would be saved if I had stepped down earlier before building the North-South Highway, Penang Bridge, KLIA, West Port, Putrajaya, Cyberjaya, the twin towers of Petronas and a host of other mega projects. We would be sitting on a mountain of Ringgits.\n\nUnquote”\n\nI wish there would be a more transparent informative assessment of the state of affairs of Malaysia Airlines (MAS), especially in relation to its recent share swap with Air Asia. Granted that the travel industry has never been the same after 9/11, the rise in price of fuel and that forgettable era when MAS was “privatised” and led by people not conversant with the airlines industry, the airlines was facing stiff competition from its rivals in the region such as Singapore airlines.\n\nCurrent MAS’s problems, inter alia, are higher operating costs and non-profitable routes. It also has old fuel-guzzling aircraft fleet that need replacing.\n\nAnd what about its management? According to Tan Sri Aziz who used to helm MAS during its hey days some years ago, MAS has not been managed well for the last 15 years. Now, whose fault is that? Being a government-linked company (GLC) do I wonder whether there is an element of political interference that normally would stall creativity and prevent the best from taking charge?\n\nBut to a layman and a helpless minority shareholder like me ( I kept my shares as I thought the government would look after the national interest, boy, was I wrong!), the biggest single blow to MAS is the establishment of the no-frills airlines, Air Asia which became highly aggressive under its new owner, Tony Fernandes, in 2001. This is subsequently made worse by an element of an unfair competition.\n\nAir Asia was initially a GLC and started operating in 1996 and you guessed it, it was not managed well and was in debt and had to be sold off for a token of RM1 (sounds familiar, remember the Agusta?). Within a year, Fernandes was able to turnaround the company and making profit and finally was listed on the Malaysian stock market in October 2004 and has not looked back since then despite some hiccups in 2009 due to the GFC (global financial crisis).\n\nNow how is that when Air Asia is taken private it prospers? Think about it people. When it was owned by DRB-HICOM, the government put all sorts of landing hindrances to Air Asia and the minute it was sold off to Fernandes and some “proxy”, they lifted most of it. So you see how inconsistent policy helped some “lucky” people to be successful.\n\nAnother way I see it, under Fernandes, he has a free hand in decision making and he works hard to get the connectivity and he hires the right people in management,marketing and operating what have you. There are no other silly considerations such as family connection (?), political inclination and dare I say racial factors? He runs it as a pure business. And he is an accountant by training – astute at looking at the bottomlines.\n\nHe is,due to his schooling background in Great Britain, able to connect with the likes of Richard Branson the ex-owner of UK’s Virgin Airlines, one of the first non-frills airlines in the world. (Yes, Branson has sold off his non-frills airlines after he has made lots of money!) Fernandes also has a charming personality, so charming (plus the right “proxy”) that he is able to get the Malaysian government to reverse their earlier decision of not giving Air Asia routes already taken by MAS.\n\nAnd so you see BN government decisions made after 2005 to let Air Asia operate out of Sepang (KLIA) to Singapore (a very profitable MAS route) and also from East Malaysia to Johor Bahru and Singapore ( two very profitable MAS routes) and later allow them to operate the long-haul routes such as London and Melbourne. Surely people will choose lower priced flights at the expense of MAS. Do not totally blame MAS’s management for this apparent lack of government’s support.\n\nSo everyone can fly, that is the tagline of Air Asia. Yes, to me everyone can fly but the standard of service has gone down the gutters. And Air Asia gets to choose its routes and even dictates terms to MAB (Malaysian Airport Ltd) despite a cabinet decision for it to relocate its low-cost operation to a new terminal in Kota Kinabalu,it has so far refused to budge and Fernandes was reported to have said, ” They have to drag me to go there!” (recalcitrance!), all because the operational cost is a little higher due to better staff and passengers’ facilities.\n\nAir Asia was supposed to service the rural routes in Sabah and Sarawak but gave them back to MAS when it found out it could not make any profit. Look at that, people. No re-branding or turnaround strategy will ever make those routes profitable. It is all about bottomlines for Air Asia and unlike MAS, no social service, thank you very much.\n\nI am also intrigued by those in BN government who make decisions to cause MAS to go down further this loss-making path. I believe ex-PM Bodohwi and his Deputy Finance Minister, Nor Yackop, were instrumental in helping Air Asia to get MAS’s profitable routes. And this is the kind of people who don’t really care what happens to MAS because they use private jets to travel.To heck with the airlines’ quality standard as it doesn’t apply to them. Anyway it is not their money which is funding MAS. Ironically, the sleepyhead is now the current MAS advisor, God help us!\n\nThe recent non-transparent share-swap with gregarious Fernandes (Air Asia) is also concerning. While people who care for MAS are saying there is a need to overhaul the operating aspects and marketing strategies of the loss-making airlines, Fernandes, instead, is recommending “rebranding“, which is a cliche in a negative business environment. And what? A new airline named “Sapphire“? As a form of Fernandes’s rebranding I believe, the name itself is a mockery of MAS (gold in Malay). No wonder MAS staff Union is getting jittery. See, I was right in my earlier posting about MAS-Air Asia share swap, I don’t trust Fernandes on MAS board, he would change things around as part of “his” turnaround program.\n\nJust fancy that, Fernandes was like a new kid on the block as far as an airlines industry is concerned in 2001 compared to those long-serving and “experienced” MAS officials and yet.. and yet in a matter of 10 years in 2011, he is telling the so-called seasoned airline managers what to do,how to do and who to do with! Don’t you find it strange? I thought the previous MAS Chairman, Munir used to travel almost everyday overseas to do business for MAS? What happens to the people who have been managing MAS all these years?\n\nI still bark at the GLC tree. Have we selected the right people to manage MAS? Now Khazanah, this government body, a major shareholder of MAS, seems to be at its wit’s end to solve MAS’s problem by tying-up with Air Asia, its competitor. I bet Tony is laughing in the mirror every morning he brushes his teeth!\n\nAir Asia is expanding regionally by virtue of it being private as you can see its stock price has risen and well surpassed MAS. But do you think it is easy for Fernandes to just go to Thailand,Indonesia and the Philippines to partner those local airlines without the government’s tacit support? Now you know why MAS is losing and its competitor is gaining.Air Asia is making money no doubt and I salute Fernandes but its success is ,in part, built on MAS’s ashes so to speak. And do you think Fernandes is going to help MAS at the expense of his Air Asia? No prize for your correct answer.\n\nAnd now the ebullient and glib and wealthy Fernandes has become a major share holder of an English football club , Queens Park Rangers (QPR) and guess who foots the bill for 50% sponsorship of the club players’ shirts at a cool RM18 million? It’s MAS, MAS and MAS! (it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth) and Fernandes calls this a brilliant marketing strategy like Emirates airlines for Arsenal? So in the wealthy nation big league now are we?.\n\nAs people in the business know, to appear successful you have to show that you are spending money. I hope this strategy works but if it doesn’t, this, they will say is a risk you have to take, either way Fernandes will be laughing all the way to the bank. And the faceless government and the helpless tax-payers don’t even know what hits them.\n\nAzman of Khazanah said the MAS-Air Asia share swap is necessary but we the tax-payers, the minority MAS shareholders, concerned citizens and the thinking man on the street are not happy with the exercise which is seen as fraught with back-room politics and apparent lopsided deals, not in the long term best interests of MAS. The presence of Nazir the sibling of PM Najib at the inking ceremony has been reported as smirking of nepotism and cronyism, adding fodder to the rattlings.\n\nYes, GLC divestment and transformation indeed! When we transform, it is for the better and not for the sake of transforming to benefit some private interests.\n\nApparently according to an online news portal, MAS staff unions are meeting with the opposition to bring up their problems in parliament. Now, why does PM Najib let this happen? Surely you don’t want an issue like this, virtually opening up a can of worms, to be so near to your calling for a general election? I was beginning to admire PM Najib but his apparent recent “flip-flops” are deeply worrying me.\n\nWhich premier travel airlines are currently making profits in this world? Look at Qantas, British Airways and even our neighbour Royal Brunei Airlines but they don’t suffer the fate like MAS being treated in such a manner, discarding and employing MDs and CEOs every so often? Bringing in its competitor to help it make its management decision? Blaming the airlines and not the unfair environment it is operating in is shallow thinking.\n\nI would like to quote a comment made by an online news portal’s reader on MAS’s problem, Quote “If MAS is run and managed like SIA since independence without the interference by all the corrupt politicians, tycoons, etc, MAS would not have to waste so much tax payers’ money. MAS would have set up low cost airliner like Airasia, full service short haul service like Silk Air (Singapore) and Dragon Air (Hong Kong).…. Corruption and racism have wasted so much resources of this country…. Period! Unquote.\n\nThe story of MAS is a sad one as the people who are entrusted to look after its interests are pushing it deeper into “artificial” problems and now applying an artificial solution. It appears that the government has resorted to taking the easy way out without a proper analysis of the airlines situation and long term repercussions including the welfare of MAS staff and customers’ needs.\n\nMalaysia has a reasonable proportion of middle-income citizens who wish to travel by air with a certain standard of service. Moreover MAS can act as our international ambassador as it has always been, portraying our culture of service and promoting our national identity, and to me, it’s a national treasure that requires talented management.\n\nMAS-Air Asia share swap/collaboration/partnership/merger, whatever you like to call it, should not be a means to re-establish a monopoly on air travel at the expense of the citizens and the minority shareholders. An element of fair competition is healthy and surely we Malaysians deserve better.\n\n** An interesting post by a journalist based in Australia G Sahathevan in 2008 on Tony Fernandes in relation to MAS and Air Asia at http://sahathevan.blogspot.com/2008\n\nWhat is corruption?\n\nFrom the website of Transparency International comes this elegant definition: Corruption is the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. It hurts everyone whose life, livelihood or happiness depends on the integrity of people in a position of authority.\n\nCorruption comes in all guises in Malaysia. Those that have been arrested and go through the court are usually small frys except for one or two big ones like the current trial of Ling Liong Sik the ex- Federal Minister of Transport in the PKFZ land scandal and the ex Menteri Besar (Chief Minister ) of Selangor, Khir Toyo in his mansion purchase.\n\nWe need the present government leadership to also focus on ministers and other politicians in its war against corruption. PM Najib please translate your anti-corruption mission into concrete action. Going hard after the likes of Teoh Beng Hock for RM2k corruption shows a misplaced resolve.All politicians and government servants living beyond their means should be investigated.\n\nTo reflect on the perceived systematic nature of this social disease I would like to re-post the thought of one commentator on an online news portal following the revelation by American cables through Wikileaks on corruption at high levels in Malaysia.\n\n“Quote”\n\nFed-up says:\n\n“For all those that comment here regarding corruption\n\nBe it good or bad comments\n\nI will stake my life on the fact that at some time or another\n\nIn our daily lives we have had to pay someone to do something for us\n\nNot a day goes by when\n\nIF we want something “fast tracked”\n\nWe have to pay for it in some way shape or form\n\nIF the ACA (MACC) is really interested\n\nI will stand up in a court of law and swear, corruption is rampant in Malaysia\n\nCorruption is rampant in all government departments\n\nFrom the clerk that takes your file and the office boy that passes it on\n\nTo the pegawai (officer) that is going to sign off on it\n\nThey ALL expect to get paid to fast track anything that needs to be done\n\nGet caught by the police ….. boleh selasai ka (Can we solve it) …. yes boleh (can)\n\nWant your container cleared from the port\n\nAll it takes is 300RM to have it out and cleared by day’s end\n\nGo to the Motor Vehicle department (JPJ)\n\nEven if your vehicle in NOT road worthy when inspected\n\nThat’s ok, just place enough RM in the ash tray and it’s “passed”\n\nDrivers license, it’s the same, pay and you pass\n\nDo you want to get approval for any project\n\nYes, boleh, IF you are wiling to grease the palms of the right people\n\nYes, let’s jumpa (meet) later at a Hotel coffee shop and business is done\n\nSo much so, that the approval is hand delivered to you after hours\n\nDo you want to meet a Menteri at Putrajaya for a photo opportunity\n\nPay the right person and it’s a done deal\n\nOr you could go to Putrajaya and wait for an appointment that never comes\n\nI could go on and on …\n\nSo, for all those bleeding hearts out there\n\nThose high and mighty ones that think Malaysia is corruption free\n\nThink again “.\n\n“Unquote”\n\nI agree with him/her that we do have a relatively rampant corruption in this country. I must say I am emphatic with Fed up as I absolutely abhor corruption. And I wonder whether there is a special fatwa against it to make it really a great sin among the Muslim. Though I must say there are government servants and politicians who are not corrupt and unfortunately this kind is taken for granted and have seldom been given due recognition. They seem to be the exception rather than the rule in Malaysia. The more the people appear religious-centric in their Middle-eastern garbs and their words, the more corrupt they are, right to the top. As they say the fish rots from the bloody head!\n\nWhilst measures are being taken to eliminate this scourge, we look up to the political will to sustain this noble effort. We need to tackle corruption at every nook and crannies of society, at all levels both government,the private sector and non-governmental organisations including charitable ones. It is important that the fight against corruption is led by people of integrity. People who occupy the seats of political power and potentially able to inspire a whole generation of citizens to loathe corruption. Unfortunately it looks like we, at least I, have been dreaming.\n\nThere is a special breed of corruption at the highest decision-making level in this country as noted by the American diplomatic cables revealed by Wikileaks. The headline in an online news portal read “Malaysian procurement system riddled with corruption, says US cable” “http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/malaysian-procurement-system-riddled-with-corruption. These are the very people who talk about fighting against corruption and yet they indulge in the practice with glee and dare I say, without conscience?\n\nSo these public officials entrusted with power take 30% as commission in the purchase of defence equipment and that, my dear friends, is exactly the amount being up by the successful contractor and what should have cost say 1m becomes 1.3m and who pays for that? You and I, the tax payers. Our money and the State’s money from our resources like oil is used to fatten up the corrupt. May they and their families rot in this world! Such is the disappointment and frustration at these bloody greedy scumbags.\n\nI remember the previous PM Abdullah Badawi talking so much about an open tender system and transparency, the end of negotiated tenders and establishing an Institute of Integrity to combat corrupt practices and yet he was the one engaging in this practice through his sister-in-law according to the news report. Or doesn’t he know that using his position as the Prime Minister for his relative to gain financially is a form of corruption? Perhaps he doesn’t know, being a graduate of Islamic Studies, he probably thinks that money needs to be physically given to his sister-in-law before you can call it corruption. Haven’t we been taken for a ride by this sleepyhead PM!\n\nOther people in this special breed of corrupt public officials are in the seat of power and at the pedestal of political decisions and public policy. How do they expect the rakyat (citizens) and the pegawai kerajaan (civil servant) not to indulge in the same practice when the latter knows what their leaders are up to? I am reminded of the Malay proverb “Seperti ketam mengajar anaknya berjalan lurus“? or a crab teaching its progeny to walk straight as we know a crab moves by zigzagging sideways. Or is this a question of “Do as I preach and not as I do?”. Have our leaders then succumbed to the proverbial moral abyss?\n\nThis high level corruption is hard to bring to book. Just look at how virtually impossible it is for MACC (Malaysian Anti-Corruption Council) to investigate Taib Mahmud, the long-serving and corrupt Sarawak Chief Minister despite the Swiss government’s freezing of his vast assets allegedly procured through corruption. What more to investigate the ex-PM, the serving politicians and the current PM ?. Only through a drastic change of government could you undertake this massive spring cleaning exercise. But I bet there would be a do or die efforts by the existing serving politicians to stay in power and continue their corrupt lifestyle. Money politics will be the order of the day: an entrenched corrupt party culture..\n\nIt is both interesting and ironic to note that in China, the leader of CPC (Communist Party of China), Hu Jintao maintains that for the party to remain in power, it must fight and fight corruption hard. Yes, they shoot corrupt officials there! And in India, we have people-backed Anna Hazare, the epitome of the anti-corrupt, to virtually force the government to revise its anti-corruption bill to make it more stringent for public officials including ministers. Where are our anti-corruption champions?\n\nTo expose high level corruption we rely on external agencies such as Transparency International and other concerned foreign governmental authorities; that is more towards naming and shaming rather than penalising the perpetrators through a legal process.\n\nUnless our wayward public officials appreciate and internalise that material wealth gathered through corruption is morally wrong and achieved at the cost to the society, they will continue to enrich their relatives and friends while they are still in power. I wonder what they say in their daily prayers- thank you God I got 30% commission (bribe) today? What a sickening thought!\n\nThe ordinary folks would not generally understand the repercussions of these despicable practices on their everyday life.Indeed there can be no fairness without transparency and neither can there be justice without integrity.\n\nWe as the citizens must be alert and say “no” to corruption at all levels so that systematic pervasive government corruption will not take roots in Malaysia and let us guard her from plunging into destructive and baffling social problems as noted in some countries by Transparency International.\n\nMay the will of the people prevail.\n\nLet me just re-post the disturbing Malaysian Insider news below:\n\nMalaysian procurement system riddled with corruption, says US cable\n\nMalaysian Insider, September 09, 2011\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Sept 9 — The seedy and allegedly corrupt side of Malaysia’s defence procurement has been laid bare in a US embassy cable, with startling revelations on how Umno politicians, agents, civil servants and military officials receive 30 per cent “commission” on deals.\n\nIn a note on the opaque procurement system here revealed by whistleblower site Wikileaks, the US embassy noted that American companies operating here had three main complaints about the system: the lack of transparency, outright corruption, and Bumiputera requirements.\n\nThe undated cable sent during the Abdullah administration between 2004 and 2009 also noted that many government tenders do not follow procurement rules.\n\nA US aerospace executive told the US embassy here defence deals were done through shadowy agreements with no tendering process. For example, the then-Prime Minister Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi’s (picture) sister-in-law arranged a US$400 million (RM1.2 billion) contract to buy military cargo aircraft from Airbus.\n\nThe deal was announced following Abdullah’s return from a trip to France.\n\n“The US executive asserted that PM Abdullah’s brother told him this deal was ‘done for political and other reasons, such as commission’,” noted the US embassy cable made public through Wikileaks.\n\nSimilar scenarios were described for the procurement of T91 Polish tanks and SU-30 Russian aircraft, noted the executive, who also said that once someone purporting to work for then-Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak approached him about a deal and suggested “you will get a part of it.”\n\nThe US embassy noted that Malaysian political parties including Umno rely on “money politics” for much of their operating funds.\n\n“Projects or tenders often are awarded as political patronage with a cut of funds circulating back to the party through different channels,” noted the embassy.\n\nThese revelations come at a time when there has been some scrutiny surrounding the deal to buy Scorpene submarine. More than RM500 million was allegedly paid to a local consulting company Perimekar and the opposition has pointed fingers at Najib who was the defence minister when the deal was inked.\n\nPakatan Rakyat (PR) politicians have also questioned the inflated costs of several new defence deals announced by current Defence Minister Datuk Zahid Hamidi.\n\nThe US embassy noted that lack of transparency was also evident when it came to awarding contracts in the information communication technology (ICT) sector. A manager at a US ICT firm pointed out that it was shortlisted for a tender with Telekom Malaysia Bhd but lost to another company that did not even bid for the contract.\n\nThough the cable was sent during the Abdullah administration, there is little evidence that the procurement system has improved. Anecdotal evidence suggests that lip service is paid to open tender system with the preferred choice being direct negotiation.\n\nThis trend is especially true for large contracts and concessions where politically-connected companies are involved.\n\nThe Malaysian Insider reported yesterday that a consortium led by 1MDB and Puncak Niaga have been given the greenlight by the government to buy IWK for RM1. The consortium will assume the debts of RM1.5 billion but will obtain a concession for 60 years.\n\nDespite English being a global language of science,commerce and international diplomacy, Malaysia is bent on downgrading it to just an extra language class. The efforts made by the previous forward-looking Prime Minister Dr Mahathir to get the children learn science and mathematics in English has been shot down by the so-called Malay nationalists who are mostly in their sixties and getting ready to stamp their ideology before their final exit in this world stage.\n\nUnfortunately this cry to do away with English was done after the retirement of Mahathir and during the weak tenure (2003-2009) of Abdullah Badawi who could not see the wood for the trees. A leader whose vision was cloudy and lacking in commitment to enhance Malaysia’s global competitiveness. A leader who thought more about his political survival rather than the good for the country. As the current Prime Minister’s mandate is based on the result of the disastrous 12th General election, it is understandable that he could not turn back the policy change made by his weak predecessor without being seen as rashed. He also has to be careful treading on Malay sensitivities which could be politicised by the opposition party particularly by PKR ( People Justice party) led by Anwar Ibrahim, the ex-UMNO disgraced deputy Prime Minister.\n\nEnglish usage in school has become politically sensitive in this Malay-majority country though glaring examples of successful Malays schooled in English prior to 1982 are abundant in all sphere of professional fields. Captains of industries need to be conversant in English to make a presence at the global level. Say what you like, English is vital for international communication and also as a means to gain rapidly expanding knowledge especially in the fields of science,technology and research.\n\nI have seen how English open up educational and international networking in all fields related to advancement in knowledge and practical skills. In the past Malaysians attending international conferences and seminars were sought after to chair meeting, workshops or become a reppartoeur and contribute in the promulgation of policies etcetera. Chairing an international conference has been a highlight of my profession as I strove to put Malaysia on the global map. But I believe now our Malaysian participants, those educated after 1982, are becoming passengers in these meetings as they struggle to express themselves in a language understood by the global community.\n\nLast week Malaysia is still recognised as having high English fluency among the countries in this part of the world but I think this achievement will be a thing of the past once many of those schooled in the English medium of instruction have retired. Some Malaysians then can still use common words in English but they are not likely to be able to converse and express themselves in the language. Without doubt they are not going to be of use much in the private sectors whose companies deal at the international level.\n\nThough many politicians are aware of the significance of English but nobody dares to undo what took place during Abdullah Badawi’s time for fear of being labelled as ignorance on the need to establish a national identity. The politics of English is fraught with egotism and misplaced nationalism. The divide between the wealthy and the poor in this country will widen as the former will be able to ensure their children’s proficiency in English.\n\nMalay language should be encouraged as one that unifies the nation but English should be emphasised for acquisition of knowledge. Children good in English will certainly have an edge over those who are not. The news report in the STAR today testifies to this conclusion. Ignore English at your peril so to speak.\n\nI am re-posting the report below:\n\nSunday April 10, 2011\n\nTOP JOBS ONLY FOR THOSE WHO KNOW THE LANGUAGE WELL\n\nBy Hariati Azizan and lee Yen Mun\n\nsunday@thestar.com.my\n\nPETALING JAYA: It does not matter if you are top of your class or have a string of degrees, that dream job will not be yours unless you can speak and write well in English.\n\nFeedback from local and international employers shows that verbal and written communication skills in English remain the most sought-after attribute in prospective employees.\n\nAccording to a recent Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF) survey, it is the most important trait employers look for when recruiting graduates.\n\nThe MEF Salary Survey for Executives 2010 revealed that 68% of the companies surveyed named communication skills as the top quality required in job applicants, followed by working experience (67%), interpersonal skills (56.2%) and passion and commitment (55.7%).\n\nMEF executive director Shamsuddin Bardan said globalisation had changed the nature of jobs, making communication skills, specifically in English, a valuable asset for today’s worker.\n\nHe added that this was an essential criterion even for professions traditionally seen as “backroom” staff such as engineers, technical personnel and scientists. “It is especially so for those working in multinationals and bigger firms,” he said.\n\n“Today, our clients are worldwide. In factories, for instance, engineers are a different breed from the past,” said Shamsuddin.\n\n“Now, they have to be involved in various aspects of business and interact with clients.”\n\nShamsuddin expressed concern that many local graduates today could not speak or write proper English, saying this was a reason why they faced difficulties getting jobs in the private sector.\n\nKelly Services (M) Sdn Bhd managing director Melissa Norman concurred, noting that six in 10 graduates who attended its interviews could not communicate effectively in English.\n\nThe company is one of the top headhunters in the country.\n\nNorman said it was important to master English as it was widely used among the business community, both in Malaysia and internationally.\n\nThe Kelly Global Workforce Index survey released in 2010 listed “communication skills” as one of the top five most desired skills within the corporate sector.\n\n“We have encountered local graduates who are weak in spoken and written English and have limited vocabulary,” said Norman.\n\n“These candidates can only manage to secure jobs in small-medium enterprises and small businesses.”\n\nVarious industry and business leaders also warned that the decline in English was affecting Malaysia’s global competitiveness.\n\nFederation of Malaysian Manufacturers President Tan Sri Mustafa Mansur said the young ones who could not communicate in English were unable to negotiate the best deals in business transactions or investments.\n\n“We need to send people out to market our products, negotiate deals or get contracts signed. If they cannot communicate well in English, we will lose out,” he said.\n\nPemudah co-chair Tan Sri Yong Poh Kon pointed out that, contrary to popular belief, it was important for civil servants to have a good command of English due to a growing borderless world.\n\n“The standard of English also affects the quality of the public sector as civil servants have to interact with international citizens and the business world as well as articulate Malaysia’s stand on issues to the international community. These include negotiations on important agreements such as trade agreements.”\n\nNoting that the quality of English in the country had declined over the last two decades, former Human Resource Minister Tan Sri Fong Chan Onn warned that the country would lose out to its neighbours that did not teach English in schools previously.\n\n“Thailand, Indonesia and China are making efforts to improve their English through their education system,” he noted.\n\nI must admit that I just had a brief look at the TV broadcast of the meeting though I was quick to note the way the two leaders sat. Obama with his hands both on the right side of of the sofa next to Najib and his body leaning across with both legs crossed and pointed halfway towards Najib’s chair. Whereas Najib sat stiffly with one arm on the right and the other on the left and feet wide apart like a king!\n\nThe non-verbal signs actually tell many things from background, willingness to listen, stress level, confidence and agility of mind. As the American system seems more transparent albeit a bit restraint compared to that of the UK, I can relate to Obama having read two of his books, “Dreams from my father” and ” The Audacity of hope” well before he became the most powerful man on earth, the President of the United States of America in 2009.\n\nObama comes from a humble beginning and had had to overcome a lot in his life. He learnt a great deal about endearing himself to the people especially when he was canvassing to become a Democrat senator in Chicago. His experiences in life had also taught him to be rather down to earth. Harvard education has made him into a more refined person both in knowledge and social skills and communication. So despite being the President of a great country, he appears approachable and friendly, fair and dependable. Yes, he has no family connection to hold on to during his journey to power unlike Bush and even our Najib. He is also an only child of Ann Stanley and Barack Obama, an African student. He made it all by himself and through his ability to influence and garner the people support. Simply he is indeed an amazing man. His other helpful attribute is his gift of the gab. Except for his smoking habit, he is a true model of character.\n\nAs for Najib, I hope he will continue to learn to soften his “upper-crust” bearing, be more humble and appear more approachable especially with the wife the like of Rosmah whose reputation precedes herself. From my self observation Najib has made great strides in endearing himself and UMNO/BN to the Malaysian people on paper and from the podium, yes, from the podium. Because when he talks to the ordinary people he still has that stiff “silver plate” attitude. The body language speaks volumes about a person than what he actually says and is trying to portray.\n\nNajib’s performance compared to his predecessor, Abdullah Badawi is much better as he is more organised and wields a better control of his Ministers. And his warm relationship with Mahathir ensured a quieter period politically. And remember it was Najib’s father who helped Mahathir back to UMNO following his expulsion by Malaysia’s first Prime Minister. Najib is balancing a lot of issues but he is wading in calmer waters in UMNO.\n\nBe that as it may, he should look again at some of the videos of him with other people and correct the perceived deficiencies. A good leader is one who is not frightened of constructive criticisms especially in this era of efficient inter-connectivity where a leader can be compared with others internally or externally at a click.\n\nAs the government of Malaysia is stepping up its efforts to eliminate corruption, the public should play its role to support these. Let us say “NO TO CORRUPTION”.\n\nThe corruption in Malaysia occurs at almost all levels and involves small and big fish. It is however the small fish that is often got caught, charged, tried successfully and sentenced. We hear of a low-ranking policeman given a bribe and later arrested, tried, found guilty and then jailed. Then we hear of a Director General of a ministry who received free expensive dental treatment, charged, tried and not found guilty. Look like justice for the small fish and the big fish is unequal. Unequal justice is no justice!\n\nAn agency like the Malaysian anti-corruption council (MACC) will have to be innovative in order to mount successful prosecution of cases. Despite their training in the art of interrogation, the staff might still not be able to formulate and pose probing questions to extract meaningful responses from the witness or the suspect. That is why I believe, in many cases, the interrogating officers became frustrated and use physical force or choose to mentally torture the witness/suspect by questioning them for long period of time, at unsavory hours and without a lawyer (unheard of in Malaysia).\n\nIt is common among the legal fraternity to find lawyers specializing in various fields, for example, criminal, intellectual property, medico-legal and family law so that they become conversant and able to defend their clients in a professional manner. This specialization is found in other profession as well such as the police, medical and engineering. Specialization will enable better focus, reliability and validity of approach at problem solving.\n\nWhile specialization is the way to go, it may be difficult to have it in the short term so MACC will have to outsource the expertise if they are serious to fight corruption. I do not know whether they are actually doing this already, if so, kudos to them. From what I observe, they have not been that successful in areas related to land fraud. There are experts in land matters in our country that MACC could have asked for opinion on how to approach the subject and the right questions to ask. I would suggest that a fee should also be paid to these experts for their skill and time.\n\nMany corruption-abhorred citizens welcome the establishment of corruption lab by the Najib government, imagine if UMNO still followed the Abdullah Badawi’s plan of transition of power only in 2010!! I really shudder at the thought. At least the new PM have both strategies and activities to tackle corruption. During Badawi’s time, he acted like a fatwa-issuing person without specific activities so it was just a fantasy of his! We had a National Integrity Institute (NII) which was good at talking, suggesting and more talking. Holding seminars in five-star hotels and no visible results. And more seminars were being held.\n\nThere was a NNI seminar (2006?) for about 1000 teachers held in a big hotel where they were supposed to return to their respective schools and teach their students on integrity! Many of the teachers interviewed after the seminar admitted they came away with no better knowledge and skill on how to teach integrity. It was a sheer waste of government (tax-payers ) money. Seminar in seminar out, that seems to be the culture of the decadence and the day dreamers.\n\nThe lab concept introduced by the former MAS CEO Datuk Idris Jala gives the impression that things are being studied to come up with the best strategies and actions to fight corruption. In today’s STAR we had a glimpse of what they are doing in the lab on corruption. I am relieved to see this new development. A responsible government is the government that can defend its citizens against corruption.\n\nWe want a corruption-free society so that there is no widespread social resentment and where the weak and the poor are treated fairly and services are obtained at no extra cost. We want projects to be tendered openly and only people who have the capability to handle and complete them should be considered. Do away with cronyism and nepotism. Assist the Bumiputra if needs be but not at the expense of the people especially when some of this selected Bumi do not perform.\n\nLet the World see that fighting corruption is a serious business in Malaysia.\n\nNo one is perfect. Everyone has got good and bad points, it is the degree of this positive or negative aspects which should be assessed. Sometimes we are so besotted with a person that we do not see his black side and by the same token, we may be so obsessed with someone’s actions and pronouncements that we fail to see the enormous contributions he makes. We fail to see the wood for the trees.\n\nI like to think that I am politically neutral. I try hard to understand cultural differences through reading and interactions with other races. The internet has enriched my knowledge and put a lot of things into perspectives. I embrace it gleefully and that is how I really find out how some people can be so expressive about things. All the while I thought (naively) that Mahathir was generally loved by everybody seeing that he has made Malaysia progressively modern. His treatment of the judiciary was of course a negative point and also his perceived promotion of cronyism in business through negotiated tenders which resulted in numerous mega projects and made many a multi-millionaire.\n\nWell, negotiated tenders shortened the time taken to complete projects for the benefit of the people. So we have Putrjaya, KLIA, LRT and Sepang Formula One circuit and that awesome Petronas Twin Towers which fill me with so much pride whenever I look at them! At the same time I am painfully aware that this form of project tendering has also caused a lot of problems like shoddy work and unnecessary over provision of infrastructures and there are projects like schools and health clinics which are way too big for the local population and built without proper coordination, for example no proper access road to the building, no water supply and sometimes no electricity so the project was completed fast but the operation was much, much delayed.\n\nDuring Mahathir’s time before 1998, there were many “wealthy” poster boys in Renong, Malaysia Airlines,among others. Our national airlines was privatised, yes, Mahathir followed his contemporary, Margaret Thatcher’s policy in England who privatised a lot of government’s agencies. So many become wealthy almost overnight. But there were also the likes of Ananda Krishna and Vincent Tan who benefited a great deal from their connection with Mahathir.\n\nIn short Mahathir’s contributions, partly through his long tenure (22 years) as the Prime Minister are visible in all segments of the Malaysian society, be it the government civil service ( remember the punch-clock, the name tag and the quality drive?), the democratisation of the education sector, the Technology (remember the multimedia supercorridor MSC?), the development infrastructures ( I ride the Express Rail to and fro KLIA with brimming pride and I remember Tun Mahathir) and the Malaysian psyche (remember “Malaysia Boleh”?), of course this “boleh” culture could sometimes be exaggerated to ludicrous extent! And some people have expressed cynicism towards this and extend it to things negative.\n\nAnyway, despite the perceived suppression of the press and freedom of speech and the judiciary, I must say we had that feel good factor in Malaysia then. The stock market was booming and where everywhere else was experiencing low growth, our country was posting good economic data, that was then till that fateful Asian Financial Crisis in 1997-1998 and yet due to Mahathir’s unorthodox capital control measures we were able to come out of it without having to depend on IMF (International Monetary Fund) with its “punishing financial measures designed to keep us indebted to it!” apart from stoking potential social chaos in the country. Mahathir saved us! His financial measures (previously attacked) are being adopted by countries facing the recent financial meltdown and economic crisis.\n\nTun Mahathir was a leader with passion in everything he did and he delivered! Hats off to him. A truly great and visionary leader who happened to speak his mind especially against the West (sometimes I must admit, made me cringed!). I am glad I was able to meet him personally and shook his hands on four occasions, two of which after he has stepped down as PM. I had also met his wife, the gentle Tun Siti Hasmah and I will remember her work through BAKTI ( the Association of Ministers’ Wives) for the unfortunate children.\n\nI am rather bewildered by blogs’ postings which are against Mahathir. Some are quite venomous. One even stated he would like to invent a virus so that it will infect people to erase all their memories of Mahathir! And not surprisingly, the blogger is a lawyer! I can understand blogs which belong to the opposition such as Limkitsiang or Tuk Guru Nik Aziz who would not really praise Mahathir.\n\nThen this so called forum this week in Malaysiakini whose participants spoke very badly about Tun. As I was reading through, it dawned upon me that these people would not be able to express themselves silly and freely if not because of Mahathir whose policy on information technology has brought us kicking and screaming into the 21st century. Tun has set a foundation and we are benefiting from its expansion, extension and innovation. These people have every right to express their opinion but surely they must be fair. Even Lim Kit Siang, one of our politicians I most admire, praised Tun on the History channel recent documentary on Mahathir for his vision on MSC. I remember Uncle Kit was incarcerated during Operation Lallang under Tun.\n\nRecently I came across the blog by a Malaysian residing in Adelaide, My! His articles against Mahathir are vexatious and so very personal that I wonder what has the Tun done to deserve such a maligned treatment! He even went to the extent of saying Mahathir was corrupt and he praised Abdullah Badawi for being Mr Clean. This made me smirk as I have seen the abuse during the latter’s tenure which saw the company of his son in law being given a contract to supply buses to RapidKL, ambulances and buses to government health agencies which did not follow specifications. Ambulances which cannot go beyond 60Km/hr, buses with the wrong engine capacity as a result they were so slow as to cause transport problems and many of them now , like those in RapidKL are left idle, unmaintained, causing huge loss to tax-payers. And what about Mr Clean writing a letter of recommendation for his sister in law to get a business deal in the UN Iraq oil for food programme?\n\nI was present at a big convention in 2005 where there were about 1000 people and mind you, this was not a political gathering. Three main speakers spoke on different days, the Prime Minister, the Deputy and the ex-Prime Minister. Most people dozed off half-way of the speeches of the first two and only those in the front row shook their hands as each was leaving after the session. Yet the participants were captivated by Mahathir when he was speaking on the third day and when he was about to leave, you have to see it to believe it, the participants rushed forward, including yours truly and we were almost in a stampede trying to shake his hand. I have a photo to show me extending my hand eagerly and him looking with an amused smile. Such was the love we had for him!\n\nSo Tun Mahathir, I know that you are not getting any younger and while you are still with us, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for making Malaysia what it is today, proud and capable. Though not all your missions were accomplished, you can rest assured that the nation feels ever so grateful to you. You built visible towers that endure while your immediate successor promised to produce “towering individuals” that came to naught (really just hot air!). Yes, your detractors lauded Abdullah Badawi for allowing more freedom than you but at what cost? You understand the country and its people better. The way people go on about total freedom of expression in this country is like asking China to practice democracy in its truest form. Can we imagine the socio-political implications and repercussions? Look at Yugoslavia and Iraq, democracy with cruel bloodbath.\n\nWe are lucky in Malaysia where our form of democracy and respect for different cultures, political arrangements and social contract have enabled us to grow to this level and thank also to our abundant natural resources. So, can’t we all be grateful and co-exist peacefully? People may say I take a simplistic view but as long as I am happy with it, who would really care, I wonder."
