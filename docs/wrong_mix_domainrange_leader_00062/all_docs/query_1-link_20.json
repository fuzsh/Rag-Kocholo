        "text": "About 20,000 wellwishers are expected to greet PM Abdullah Ahmad Badawi when he steps down on to the tarmac at Penang Airport on his first day in power.\n\nThe 63-year-old Abdullah was sworn-in on Friday as Malaysia’s fifth PM since it gained independence from Britain in 1957. He took over from Mahathir Mohammed who stepped down from\n\npost after 22 years at the helm.\n\nAbdullah is due to make his maiden speech as premier before being whisked away from the northern resort island by a motorcade of some 2000 motorcycles to his village in Kepala Batas on the mainland peninsula.\n\nPolice said some 300 security personnel will be on duty and several roads will be closed in stages to provide a smooth\n\njourney for his convoy home.\n\nWhen he arrives the new PM will seeks blessings from his\n\n79-year-old mother Kailan Hassan and break the Ramadan fast with his family before attending a nearby mosque for prayers and a thanksgiving feast thrown by supporters.\n\nKailan has described Abdullah’s appointment as God’s will and\n\nhas advised her son to remain down-to-earth.\n\n“It never crossed my mind Abdullah will become prime minister.\n\nEverything is up to God. We should not be carried away by\n\npositions,” she said, adding that they would share a simple meal of porridge and dates, her son’s favourite.\n\nObservers do not expect Abdullah, who is less bristly than his predecessor, to make any dramatic departures from Mahathir’s economic and social policies, at least in the short term.\n\nOn Sunday, he gets down to work by visiting flood victims in the northern region and handing out aid packages before returning to Kuala Lumpur and clocking-in at the PM’s office early Monday morning.\n\nLater in the day he will deliver his first parliamentary\n\naddress."
