        "text": "In the end, all’s well that ends well.\n\nThis is being compiled on Saturday at around 4.30pm. Up to now, at least, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta has gone off without any noticeable hitches and especially without the much-feared terrorist attack on the Queen, Tony Blair or any of the other guests.\n\nThis is due, well partly, to the strict and thorough security arrangements put in place and rigorously observed.\n\nWhile the rest of us sleep in warm beds, spare a thought for the security people who have been manning the roadblocks around the Golden Sands Hotel over the past bitterly cold nights.\n\nEqually to be congratulated are the police for the way they directed traffic especially during the Queen’s visit, the GWU protest and the inauguration of CHOGM on Friday. Some, who were caught in the traffic jams waiting for the corteges of cars, with sirens screaming, to pass, may have been angry, or even very angry, as witness the angry GRTU statement on Friday.\n\nBut most people kept away; in fact, as from Wednesday Valletta was a much quieter city than normal, which helped the police carry out their duties with less stress.\n\nThe long line of cars bringing the Heads of State and Governments to the Mediterranean Conference Centre, however, turned out to be far more than the narrow road could handle. Indeed, Australian Prime Minister John Howard, for instance, had to leave his car quite some distance away and walk the rest of the way, surrounded by a very anxious security detail.\n\nConsidering everything, however, Malta, which up till some months ago was totally scared holding the EU presidency of one day, has emerged with flying colours from this ordeal of hosting 53 world leaders.\n\nStill, inevitably, some glitches and humorous moments were also experienced. The following are just a few of them.\n\nNo romantic memory\n\nrevisited\n\nAccording to last week’s UK Sunday Times, the Queen could not revisit the house of happy memories, Villa Guardamangia, because, the organisers told Atticus, the house had been ‘completely redecorated’ when the Queen last visited in 1991, and they could not do it up again.\n\nArrogance at the airport\n\nLast week, Air Malta flight KM101 from London was delayed for three hours due to fog in London.\n\nOn arrival at Malta International Airport, passengers were informed that there would be a delay to collect their luggage.\n\nVarious Maltese passengers heard a group of English travellers loudly passing snide and cynical remarks about Malta and the service at MIA.\n\nPassengers were informed that preferential treatment was being given to people attending CHOGM. In fact luggage with the logos and stickers of SKY News were the first to come out on the luggage carousel.\n\nMuch to the surprise of the Maltese, these were picked up by the group of British people who had passed derogatory remarks about whether their luggage would arrive in one piece or not.\n\n“I found the attitude of the journalists or whoever was in the SKY team extremely offensive. They were implying that Malta is a Third World country and it was insulting,” said one of the passengers.\n\n“I mean not only were they given preferential treatment because they got their luggage at least 20 minutes before the other passengers, they were impolite and arrogant,” he added. “At Heathrow a 20-minute wait to retrieve luggage is normal and I don’t see why snide implications had to be made because the same happened in Malta.”\n\nLooking for a foreign minister\n\n“Is the foreign minister of Brunei on board this bus?” There was no immediate response to the protocol man’s question as he peered into the bus taking passengers from the plane to the terminal at MIA, Mike Woolridge, the BBC’s World Affairs Correspondent reported.\n\nEventually the foreign minister did step out from among the people on the bus and accepted the VIP treatment he had been offered.\n\nBut it was a delightfully informal moment that somehow seemed to catch the intended spirit of a Commonwealth summit, Mr Woolridge commented.\n\nWrong number\n\nMaltacom employees encountered an unexpected problem when the 24-hour helpline started being used: whoever called any number starting with 2144 was automatically diverted to the CHOGM helpline at the Westin Dragonara Hotel.\n\nMaltacom technicians worked on the problem until they managed to solve it but numerous calls were received at the call centre in the meantime.\n\nA huge bang\n\nPolice officials on duty at the Suncrest Hotel in Qawra, where the Commonwealth Youth Forum was being held, got the fright of their lives when part of the false ceiling collapsed with a very loud noise.\n\nSources close to the police said the noise was so loud they thought some explosive device had gone off.\n\nAt least someone appreciates\n\nThis is how Vasemaca Rarabici reported the media centre to the Fiji Times:\n\n“Media centre first class\n\n“Hundreds of journalists from around the world are in Malta to cover the three-day Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting which started yesterday.\n\n“Like never before, the journalists have been provided with a state-of-the-art press centre that has 80 fixed-point personal computers with Internet access, 40 laptop points, wi-fi hotspots and 15 offices for international networks such as the BBC and Sky.\n\n“More than 38 kilometres of cabling have been used in the media centre but you would never know because it is hidden under a raised floor. The centre has two channels — CHOGM 1 and CHOGM 2 — streaming live information for journalists.\n\n“The stations also beam into the hotel system so that journalists can follow proceedings in their room or even in the lift, if the need arises.”\n\nMr or Ms Rarabici had other very complimentary reportages from Malta as regards the Tuesday MTA event at Vittoriosa and the Wednesday one at Mgarr. Together with two other colleagues he/she had a long and tiring 28 hour flight from Nadi via Australia, Malaysia and London, and no less than 11 hours time difference to home.\n\nTalk of media spin\n\nThis is how Yachting World reported the inauguration of the Cottonera marina by the Queen:\n\n“Under beautiful skies and with a large audience of yachtsmen and local dignitaries, HM Queen Elizabeth formally opened Grand Harbour Marina, Malta, which includes many berths for superyachts up to 100 metres.”\n\nIt was pelting with rain at the time!\n\nCommonwealth miscommunication\n\nThe Commonwealth Tele-communications Organ-isation asked to hold a press conference on Alternate Dispute Resolution at the Press Centre at the Eden Arena.\n\nHowever this request made by CTO chairman Anthony Debono was met with a flat refusal by the head of the Press Centre Paul Azzopardi.\n\nThe indefatigable CTO chairman then made the same request to the Commonwealth Secretariat and the press conference was held on Thursday in spite of Mr Azzopardi’s objection.\n\nOpening ceremony runs late\n\nThe CHOGM opening ceremony started 10 minutes behind schedule because the first head of government to be called on stage, the Prime Minister of St Lucia, had not yet arrived. “We’re off to a great start,” quipped the presenter to the general laughter of the audience.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Tony Blair was welcomed with a generous round of applause, as were Australian Prime Minister John Howard and New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark, the latter thanks to a number of Kiwis who were present in Republic Hall.\n\nThe ceremony was further delayed when Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi was called. Finally, after a three-minute wait, the Queen accompanied by Dr Gonzi and the Commonwealth Secretary General Don McKinnon, walked on stage to the warm applause of the audience.\n\nBy the time the Queen started her speech, the ceremony was running 20 minutes late. From then on, the show kept to its timings.\n\nAthletes lap up PM training run\n\nAustralian pole-vaulter Tatiana Grigorieva and cyclist Michael Rogers took their Commonwealth Games training to a new level on Thursday.\n\nThey hit the bitumen with Australia’s best-known power-walker, Prime Minister John Howard. Joined by Commonwealth Games chairman Ron Walker, they charged through a brisk 30-minute morning walk along the narrow streets and medieval battlements of Mdina.\n\n“He is very good, very fit,” Grigorieva said of the Prime Minister’s pace-setting. “We definitely added a little bit to our training. Well, I have. Walking is part of my training.”\n\nIt was the perfect warm-up for a major Commonwealth Games promotion all four were to undertake later when the Prime Minister briefed fellow leaders on Games security at a Melbourne 2006 breakfast at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.\n\nAs Mr Howard said on arrival in Malta, he’d last been in Malta as treasurer in Malcolm Fraser’s government attending a Commonwealth finance ministers meeting 25 years ago.\n\nPM celebrates birthday at Malaysian restaurant\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi celebrated his 66th birthday two days early last week at a restaurant owned by an entrepreneur from Terengganu.\n\nAfter cutting a cake, the Prime Minister received a gift from Ismail Ali, 40, the owner of Sumatra Restaurant, who hails from Pengkalan Berangan in Marang, Terengganu.\n\nIsmail came to Malta in 1996 to work at a hotel. Four years ago, he purchased the restaurant along with a nearby house from the original owner for Lm80,000 and kept the name as it was already well known among the Maltese. He said the Maltese love Malaysian dishes like satay and curry."
