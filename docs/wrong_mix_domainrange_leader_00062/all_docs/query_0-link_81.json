        "text": "At least 33 TV presenters, editors, columnists and bloggers are currently in prison, the victims of an opaque and arbitrary judicial system, because of what they said in an article, a TV interview, a blog post or even a single tweet.\n\nAccording to certain local media outlets, the journalist Turki Al-Jasser probably died under torture shortly after Khashoggi’s murder. The Saudi authorities have never denied this. As for the presenter and preacher Ali Al-Omari, who is part of the Muslim scholars movement considered moderate, he faces the death penalty for terrorism-related charges.\n\nSome were arrested many years ago, under the late King Abdullah or when the current king, Salman, was crown prince and in control. They include the citizen-journalist Raif Badawi, who was sentenced in 2012 to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes for “insulting Islam.” Others are the victims of the crackdown launched in the autumn of 2017 by the current crown prince, his son Mohammad bin Salman (MBS).\n\nSince then the list of detainees has grown longer in the course of several waves of arrests. In March 2018, three women who defended women’s rights – columnists and bloggers – were arrested and accused of endangering the state’s security and being in contact with foreign entities. In the fall of 2019, two additional women journalists were thrown behind bars in yet another wave of arrests and their fate is uncertain: Maha Al-Rafidi and Zana Al-Shahri.\n\nThe detainees included two foreign journalists, the Yemeni Marwan Al-Muraisy and the Jordanian Abdelrahman Farhaneh, who were the victims of enforced disappearances. Their families are still waiting for them to be released.\n\nJAILED BEFORE 2017\n\nFadhel Al-Manasef, citizen-journalist and human rights defender\n\nCharges: “Working against national security and stability,” “disloyalty towards the king,” and “publishing articles and communicating with foreign journalists with the aim of harming the state’s image”.\n\nJailed since: 1 May 2011.\n\nJudicial situation: Sentenced on 17 April 2014 to 15 years in prison, a fine of 100,000 riyals (19,300 euros) and a 15-year ban on leaving the country after release.\n\nJassim Al Safar, photographer\n\nCharges: “Participating in anti-government protests,” “publishing photos of prisons in public places” and “being in contact with foreign journalists and sending photos to media outlets”.\n\nJailed since: 9 May 2013.\n\nJudicial situation: Sentenced in July 2014 to seven years in prison and a seven-year ban on leaving the country after release.\n\nWajdi Al-Ghazzawi, TV presenter and founder of the Al Fajr TV channel\n\nCharges: “Inciting division within members of society” and “defaming the state and its judicial institutions\".
