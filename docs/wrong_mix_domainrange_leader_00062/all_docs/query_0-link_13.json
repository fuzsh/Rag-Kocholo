        "text": "Muslim nations moved closer to forming a free trade area yesterday, with plans to adopt tariff-cutting steps by the end of this year to bridge a gap between oil-rich and poor members of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference.\n\n\"This is an important first step towards the larger goal of greater economic integration among the OIC countries,\" the group's chairman, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, told an OIC trade forum.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges facing the grouping of Muslim nations is the vast economic disparities among its 57 members, Mr Abdullah told the forum in Malaysia's administrative capital. The OIC includes Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait - which together possess 700 billion barrels of proven oil reserves - as well as poor countries such as Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and Bangladesh.\n\nMr Abdullah said OIC countries were negotiating to establish a preferential trading system to boost trade with each other.\n\n\"The protocol is expected to be finalised in November,\" Malaysian Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz said. \"The negotiations are now regarding tariff reduction modalities and implementation period. It will cover seven per cent of total tariff lines.\"\n\nOIC nations account for just eight per cent of global trade, and trade within the bloc amounts to 13 per cent of the grouping's total trade, she said.\n\n\"There's a three-staged lowering of tariffs,\" Mr Rafidah added, describing the OIC measures. \"Increasingly, we will be offering market access duty-free to each other in the longer-term.\"\n\nMorocco urged the OIC to use the trade pact as the basis for a free trade area.\n\n\"It is imperative to establish a free trade area among member states in the short term,\" said Rahmouni Houcine, deputy director general of the Islamic Centre for Development of Trade based in Morocco, adding that it could be set up within 10 years.\n\n\"Efforts should focus on creating a favourable environment to liberalise trade among the OIC countries that is consistent with the new international economic and trade order,\" he added. Fourteen countries have signed and ratified the trade framework agreement. They are Malaysia, Indonesia, Iran, Bangladesh, Turkey, Lebanon, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Cameroon, Pakistan, Guinea, Uganda and Jordan.\n\nThis week Malaysia is hosting the annual meeting of the OIC's financial arm, the Islamic Development Bank. IDB officials have said the meeting may approve the creation of an international Islamic trade financing firm, with an initial paid-up capital of $1 billion, to spur intra-IDB trade.\n\nMalaysia also wants the IDB to launch a $10 billion Islamic bond fund for infrastructure in another effort to help close the gap between rich and poor Muslim nations."
