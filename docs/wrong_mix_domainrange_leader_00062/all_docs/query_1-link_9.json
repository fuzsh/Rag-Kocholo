        "text": "ABDULLAH AHMAD BADAWI\n\nTun Abdullah bin Haji Ahmad Badawi served as Prime Minister of Malaysia from 2003 to 2009. Malaysia’s 5th prime minister since it became independent in 1957, he was also the president of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the largest political party in Malaysia, and led the governing Barisan Nasional parliamentary coalition. He is informally known as Pak Lah, 'Pak' meaning 'Uncle' while 'Lah' is taken from his name 'Abdullah'. He also called Father of Human Capital Development (Bapa Pembangunan Modal Insan).\n\nIn October 2003, after 22 tumultuous years in power, Dr Mahathir Mohamad retired and handed power to his anointed successor, Abdullah, who went on to convincingly win a general election in March 2004. After this win, Abdullah was increasingly been criticised by Mahathir for degrading the freedom of the press and for scrapping projects such as a new bridge between Malaysia and Singapore that would have replaced the existing causeway.\n\nAbdullah has been a politician most of his life, Known as “Mr. Clean” and “Mr. Nice-guy,” he served as foreign minister and education minister before being named as deputy prime minister in 1998 when Anwar Ibraham was sacked. He was widely respected among the middle class and regarded as consensus builder. He is calm and affable where Mahathir was brash and abrasive.\n\nSean Yoong of Associated Press wrote: “Abdullah is considered milder than the blunt-spoken Mahathir, an advocate of the developing and Islamic worlds and known for his fiery criticism of globalization and U.S. policy in the Middle East. Dubbed the \"Mr. Nice Guy\" of Malaysian politics, Abdullah, who has a degree in Islamic studies and once worked in the civil service, waded into politics after the death of his father, a pioneer member of the ruling party. He entered Parliament in 1978, holding the education, defense and foreign affairs portfolios before becoming Mahathir's deputy. [Source: Sean Yoong, Associated Press, November 2, 2003]\n\nLife and Family of Abdullah Ahmad Badawi\n\nAbdullah born in November 1939 is from Bayan Lepas, Penang. The son and grandson of religious teachers, he attended Bukit Mertajam High School and studied at MBS (Methodist Boy's School) Penang for his 6th form. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Islamic Studies from the University of Malaya in 1964. After graduating from university he joined the Malaysian Administrative and Diplomatic Corps (the formal term for the civil service). He served as Director of Youth at the Ministry of Youth and Sport as well as secretary of the National Operations Council (MAGERAN).\n\nBadawi's paternal grandfather, Syeikh Abdullah Badawi Fahim, was of Arab descent. Syeikh Abdullah was a well-respected religious leader and nationalist, was one of the founding members of Hizbul Muslimin, later known as PAS. After independence, Syeikh Abdullah became the first mufti of Penang after Independence. His father, Ahmad Badawi, was a prominent religious figure and UMNO member. His maternal grandfather, Ha Su-chiang was a Utsul Muslim who came from Sanya in Hainan. [Source: Wikipedia]\n\nAbdullah’s first wife didn’t wear a headscarf and was the leader of “Sisters in Islam,” which encourages monogamy as a Muslim ideal. He was 63 when he took office in 2003. After his first wife died Abdullah married again while he was serving as prime minister. Reuters reported: Malaysia’s prime minister tied the knot with the manager of his official residence, marrying for a second time after his first wife died from breast cancer, the official Bernama news agency reported. Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, 67, and Jeanne Abdullah, 53, were married at the premier’s official residence in Putrajaya, the nation’s administrative capital, the report said quoting a family statement. The wedding was attended by close relatives. There was no press coverage at the family’s request. “The prime minister and his wife would like to thank the people for their good wishes for a happy marriage,” the statement said. Shortly after the ceremony, the couple, in beige-coloured traditional Malay dress, visited the grave of Abdullah’s first wife in Putrajaya. A prime ministerial aide said the couple’s first trip abroad would be to Brunei to attend the wedding of the Brunei sultan’s daughter. The prime minister was married to Endon Mahmood, a former colleague in the Malaysian civil service, for 40 years before she died on October 20, 2005, after a lengthy battle with cancer. [Source: Reuters, June 10, 2007]\n\nPolitical Career of Abdullah Ahmad Badawi\n\nAbdullah won a seat in parliament in 1978 in Mahathir’s UMNO party in the constituency of Kepala Batas in northern Seberang Perai (which had also been represented by his late father), which he still represents today.. His religious background made it hard for fundamentalists to dismiss him as not Islamic enough.\n\nEarly during Mahathir's tenure as prime minister, a bitter dispute erupted within the ruling UMNO party and it was divided into two camps, which were colloquially known as 'Team A' comprising Mahathir loyalists, and 'Team B', which supported former Minister of Finance Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah and former Deputy Prime Minister Musa Hitam. Mahathir prevailed, leading to the exclusion of Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah from the newly established UMNO (Baru) or New UMNO. Abdullah was a close supporter of his political mentor Musa Hitam in Team B and as a result, he was sacked from his post of Minister of Defence in the cabinet. He did not join Semangat 46 (Spirit 46) party which was set up by Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. Semangat 46 is now defunct. [Source: Wikipedia]\n\nWhen UMNO (Baru) was formed in February 1988, the then UMNO President and Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad brought Abdullah into the pro tem committee of UMNO (Baru) as the Vice President. In 1990, Abdullah retained his seat as Vice President. During the Cabinet reshuffle in 1991, Mahathir brought him back into the Cabinet as Foreign Minister. He held this post until November 1999 when Syed Hamid Albar succeeded him. Even though he lost his Vice Presidency in the 1993 UMNO elections, he remained in the Cabinet and was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. Prior to 1998, he had also served as Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, Minister of Education, Minister of Defence, and Minister of Foreign Affairs. He completed his probation when he was appointed Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia and Minister of Home Affairs following the dismissal of Anwar Ibrahim.\n\nAbdullah Steps Out Mahathir Shadow\n\nIt was thought Abdullah would pretty much follow in Mahathir’s footsteps but that was not the case. A few months after taking office he embarked on a high profile anti-corruption campaign and canceled one Mahathir‘s most cherished pet projects: the $3.7 billion cross-Malaysia railroad project, Malaysia’s largest infrastructure program, whose contact had been awarded to a Mahathir crony. Abdullah has promoted rural development and a moderate form of Islam and freed Anwar, which was seen as a portent of a mild liberalisation.. And he did all this while continuing Malaysia’s impressive emergence from the 1997 economic crisis and maintaining robust economic growth.\n\nA year after Abdullah took office as prime minister,Sean Yoong of Associated Press wrote; “When Mahathir Mohamad retired as Malaysia’s prime minister, year, his successor was asked if he could fill the shoes of the Goliath who had towered over Southeast Asian politics for 22 years. Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi replied: “I don’t know how big his shoes are, but I have my own shoes.” The quiet self-assurance Abdullah displayed that day has been the bedrock of his one year in office, demonstrating that he is no longer in the shadow of the man who handpicked him to be Malaysia’s prime minister. [Source: Sean Yoong, Associated Press, October 25, 2004]\n\n“Since taking office Abdullah has presided over one of the most radical political makeovers Malaysia has gone through, occasionally by reversing Mahathir’s initiatives. “Abdullah’s emphasis seems to be on the well-being of the people,” said Goh Chee Meng, 27, a marketing executive. “He tries to make friends, not foes.”Abdullah, 64, halted Malaysia’s era of expensive infrastructure projects; tacitly approved the release from prison of Mahathir’s former deputy-turned-nemesis Anwar Ibrahim; and healed ties with countries that were often the target of Mahathir’s famously acidic tongue.“Abdullah has his own excellent vision for Malaysia,” said Agus Yusuff, a Malaysian university political lecturer. “He is more democratic than Mahathir, but we still have to wait and see whether his policies are ultimately as effective.”\n\n“Abdullah does not have his former boss’ magnetism or charisma, and some worried that he lacked support within the ruling National Front 13-party coalition. But he swiftly stamped his authority. He shelved a $14.5-billion railway project Mahathir had championed and launched an anticorruption crackdown that led to the arrest of a tycoon allied to Mahathir. Abdullah’s “policies sit very well with the business community,” said Nicholas Zefferys, president of the American Malaysian Chamber of Commerce.Abdullah has worked to shore up ties with countries such as the United States, Australia and Singapore, which traded barbs with Malaysia in the past over bilateral disputes, Mahathir’s human rights record and his abrasive criticism of Western policies.\n\n“But the biggest turnaround was the September 2 release from prison of former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who marshaled street protests against Mahathir in 1998 and was subsequently arrested and sentenced to prison terms totaling 15 years for corruption and sodomy. Indeed, Abdullah, who is known as a pious Muslim, has buoyed his popularity by avoiding Mahathir’s penchant for belligerently berating his political rivals. In March, Abdullah secured his own five-year mandate when the National Front won 90 percent of the seats in Parliament, one of its best electoral results ever.”\n\nMalaysia General Election in 2004\n\nIn the March 2004 general election, the National Front led by Abdullah had a massive victory, virtually wiping out the PAS and Keadilan, although the DAP recovered the seats it had lost in 1999. This victory was seen as the result mainly of Abdullah's personal popularity and the strong recovery of Malaysia’s economy, which has lifted the living standards of most Malaysians to almost first world standards, coupled with an ineffective opposition.\n\nAbdullah’s and Mahathir’s National Front coalition took 198 (90 percent) of the 219 seats. It was the biggest parliamentary majority ever. The Islamic Party PAS, collapsed from 27 to 7 seats. The Democratic Action Party became the major opposition party by increasing the number of seats from 10 to12. Keadilan (National Justice Party) held on to only one of its previous five seats, the seat held by Anwar’s wife Azizah Ismail.\n\nAbdullah seemed to have the right mix of continuing some Mahathir policies and establishing new ones. His anti-corruption campaign and his religious background gave him the moral high ground and deprived the opposition of their complaints and issues with the ruling party. The opposition alleged fraud and demanded new elections. Not much came of the allegations or demands. In July 2004, Abdullah secured the top position in the ruling party after his top opponent couldn’t even secure enough nominations to oppose him.\n\nAbdullah Ahmad Badawi as Prime Minister\n\nAs Abdullah settled into his job he has sought to win party support by relaxing spending curbs after pursuing a period of austerity that proved unpopular since many UMNO members depend on government contracts. To address these concerns the government launched a $15 billion project to improve the infrastructure of the southern state of Johor, a UMNO stronghold. Abdullah accused the West of being too preoccupied with terrorism and not doing more to help the poor. He accused Malaysians of being too preoccupied with race and religion. Human rights abuses weren’t much of an issue. And in any case, after 22 years of Mahathir, most Malaysians tryied to avoid trouble and didn’t care that much anyway about human rights issues beyond those associated with Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIn the summer of 2005,Philip Bowring wrote in the New York Times, “July seems to have been a watershed month in the administration of Malaysia's low-key prime minister, Abdullah Badawi. After months of growing gripes that his good reformist intentions were not matched by decisiveness orwillingness to take on vested interests in the governing United Malays National Organization (UMNO), there is now a sense that fundamental changes are taking place. The merit of Abdullah's Fabian tactics is becoming clearer as symbols and personalities of the Mahathir bin Mohamad era slowly fade into history. [Source: Philip Bowring, New York Times, August 5, 2005]\n\n“Many positive things had already happened in the previous 20 months since he came to office. The courts were left free to release jailed former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim; a report on the police pulled no punches in its descriptions of corruption and abuse of power; a senior UMNO minister was suspended and investigated for corruption; the news media became slightly more open to opposition views; backbench members of Parliament were not discouraged from querying government deals; new senior appointments appeared to go to people with clean, professional reputations; relations with America, Australia and Singapore were patched up.\n\n“Nonetheless, there was a sense that Abdullah remained the captive of the party. The cabinet remained largely unchanged, and he was under constant pressure from Mahathir-era interests. His preference for delegating authority slowed decision making and upset those in the business community who relied on government contracts. He left power in hands of people who did not always share his enthusiasm for clean, institution-led administration by strong institutions. He was evidently more popular with the public than with the party. However, he emerged from the party's annual assembly last month with flying colors. He declined to back off his pursuit of clean government and his admonitions of Malays for not appreciating the opportunities offered to their community to raise their wealth and educational levels and remaining too reliant on preferential status.\n\nEconomic Policy Under Abdullah Ahmad Badawi\n\nDante Pastrana wrote in the World Socialist Web Site: “When Mahathir stood down in 2003, Abdullah took over as prime minister and, under pressure from business, began to moderate the previous economic controls. He offered a more moderate image, cracked down several figures known for their corruption under Mahathir and won a landslide victory in 2004. He called for more foreign investment, the privatisation of government assets and signed a free trade agreement with Japan, one of Malaysia's major trading partners. [Source: Dante Pastrana, World Socialist Web Site, April 2, 2009]\n\nGrowth was 7.2 percent in 2004, the fastest in four years. Semiconductors, hard-disk drives and other electrical and electronic products accounted for around half of Malaysia’s exports. Growth was 5.1 percent in 2005. In July 2005, Malaysia scrapped the ringgit’s peg to the dollar which had been in place since 1998. In November 2005, Malaysia raised its benchmark interest rate for the first time in more than seven years to curb inflation. Again exports were strong. Growth was 5.9 percent in 2006.That year there was 2.5 percent inflation and 3.5 percent unemployment. Growth was 6.3 percent in 2007. That year there was 2 percent inflation and 3.3 percent unemployment.\n\nPhilip Bowring wrote in the New York Times, Change was partly “driven by the ending of the ringgit peg to the dollar, which has been a form of protection for inefficient industries and held back both corporate reform and consumption. The currency has been seriously undervalued. A current account surplus that was running at 8 percent of gross domestic product even before the commodity price boom has ballooned to nearly 20 percent. High commodity prices can be either a crutch supporting hand-outs and extravagant schemes, or used to spur productivity and a shift toward a higher-wage, service-oriented economy. The chances now are better that the end of the peg will help Abdullah's strategy to reduce the links between government and business. [Source: Philip Bowring, New York Times, August 5, 2005]\n\nBut there were problems. Thomas Fuller wrote in the New York Times, “From the vantage point of central Kuala Lumpur, the country appears to be booming. The sounds and sights of jackhammers, cranes and backhoes across the city are testament to the continued transformation of what was once a sleepy backwater into a thriving, cosmopolitan Southeast Asian capital. But many Malaysians say they are worried about the country’s economic prospects. In a survey of 1,026 registered voters released by the Merdeka Center in January, only 19 percent of ethnic Chinese, who form the cornerstone of the country’s business community, said they expected the economy to improve in the coming year.Price increases for food and fuel, both of which are subsidized here, are major campaign issues. Voters surveyed listed inflation, inequality, ethnic relations and a rise in crime as their top concerns. Income distribution in Malaysia is the least equal of all Asian countries but Papua New Guinea, according to United Nations statistics. [Source: Thomas Fuller, New York Times, March 7, 2008]\n\nBy 2006, things were starting to wrong for Abdullah. By that time he had lost much of the goodwill he received when he took office in 2003. Associated Press reported: “Abdullah was blamed for failing to properly manage inflation, crime, corruption and most importantly ethnic tensions between the minorities and the majority Malays. Minorities have complained of increasing discrimination, citing a 37-year-old affirmative action program for Malays that shows no sign of being diluted despite their rising standards of living. The program gives Malays preference in government jobs, business, education and religion. [Source: AP, March 7, 2008]\n\nIn January 2008, Radio Australia reported: “Malaysian retailers have begun rationing cooking oil purchases due to the government introducing restrictions to curb a shortage. It's believed price-hike rumours have caused panic buying of cooking oil. Rationing of five kilograms per customer per purchase was supposed to be enforced from Monday. The parliamentary opposition has criticised the measures, which it says is harming restaurants, consumers and vendors. Supermarket shelves were stripped of cooking oil in several states of Malaysia last week, with retailers not able to replenish supplies fast enough. [Source: Radio Australia, January 7, 2008]\n\nMalaysia and the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009\n\nDuring the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009 growth slowed and unemployment rose in Malaysia as its palm oil, rubber, oil and natural gas sectors were hit by falling commodity prices and its electronics industry and exports in general were hit hard by declining global demand.\n\nDuring the economic slowdown Malaysia into its first recession in a decade. Growth reached a record low of -6.2 percent in the first quarter of 2009 but bounced back reaching an all time high of 5.9 Percent in the third quarter of 2009 . The economy contracted by 1.7 percent in 2009.\n\nIn August 2009, Liz Gooch wrote in the New York Times, “Malaysia recorded 31,392 layoffs from January through July, and the country’s unemployment rate rose to 4 percent in the first quarter of 2009. That was up from 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. The average monthly wage in the manufacturing industry has risen to 650 to 700 ringgit ($183 to $197) in the last three months, up from 450 ringgit, the national news agency Bernama reported. Figures released by the government showed that the economy had emerged from recession in the second quarter. Mr. Rajasekaran, the labor leader, said that although job losses were easing, the unions thought the freeze on foreign workers should continue. If there is a need for more workers in the coming months, he said, companies should be able to extend the visas of foreign workers already in the country. [Source: Liz Gooch, New York Times, August 31, 2009]\n\nIn March 2008 as the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009 was taking hold and elections were a few weeks away, the Malaysian government announced an ambitious $16 billion stimulus program. Elffie Chew wrote in the Wall Street Journal, “Malaysia's government unveiled a 60 billion ringgit ($16.26 billion) economic-stimulus plan that will strain government finances in an effort to shield the economy from the global downturn. The plan — larger than expected and the biggest economic stimulus initiative Malaysia has ever taken — amounts to 9 percent of gross domestic product and will drive the fiscal deficit to 7.6 percent of GDP this year. It will be implemented during 2009 and 2010, Finance Minister Najib Razak said. [Source: Elffie Chew, Wall Street Journal, March 11, 2008]\n\nThe plan follows seven billion ringgit in stimulus steps announced in November and complements efforts by the central bank to support the economy. Bank Negara has cut policy interest rates a total of 1.5 percentage points in three policy moves since November. Yeah Kim Leng, chief economist at Kuala Lumpur-based rating agency RAM Holdings Bhd., said the new spending will help boost confidence as it focuses on curbing unemployment and helping distressed companies affected by the downturn in exports. \"The plan should help cushion the negative effects from the deteriorating global conditions and prevent the local economy from spiraling downwards,\" Mr. Yeah said.\n\nCriticism of Abdullah Badawi\n\nBy 2006, things were starting to wrong for Abdullah. By that time he had lost much of the goodwill he received when he took office in 2003. Associated Press reported: “Abdullah was blamed for failing to properly manage inflation, crime, corruption and most importantly ethnic tensions between the minorities and the majority Malays. Minorities have complained of increasing discrimination, citing a 37-year-old affirmative action program for Malays that shows no sign of being diluted despite their rising standards of living. The program gives Malays preference in government jobs, business, education and religion. [Source: AP, March 7, 2008]\n\n“The Chinese and Indians are also angry at a string of court decisions in religious disputes that have gone in favor of Malays. Indians were incensed by the demolition of Hindu temples by authorities last year. \"The problem is not with the Malays. The problem is with the corrupt leadership of this country,\" opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim told a rally in Kuala Lumpur Thursday night. Anwar, a former deputy prime minister under Mahathir, promised to end racial discrimination if his People's Justice Party wins, a virtually impossible scenario. \"We want strong Malays, strong Chinese, strong Indians ... Take the best Malays, let them work with the best Chinese and the best Indians,\" he said to roaring applause.”\n\nThomas Fuller wrote in the New York Times, “Public protests are frowned on by Malaysia’s mildly authoritarian government and often broken up by the riot police. So when a group of opposition party members and activists wanted to send a message to Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi earlier this year they chose a softer and safer alternative — delivering a pillow to his office. “He has a reputation for liking to sleep,” said Rahmat Haron, a poet and self-styled government critic. Mr. Rahmat helped lead the small delegation, which made it as far as the security checkpoint. “He sleeps in cabinet meetings, he sleeps in Parliament,” he added. “So we thought, why not make him more comfortable?” [Source: Thomas Fuller, New York Times, March 7, 2008 /~/]\n\n“Mr. Abdullah is being portrayed both by the opposition and by some high-profile members of his own party, the United Malays National Organization, as sluggish and listless. Mahathir bin Mohamad, who preceded Mr. Abdullah as prime minister and is from the same party, reiterated his regret for having chosen him as his successor and called for Malaysians to elect a strong opposition — a stunning reversal for a man who while in office sent opposition politicians to jail. “He looks a bit out of touch,” said Ibrahim Suffian, director of the Merdeka Center, an independent polling agency. At a time of rising crime, higher food prices and ethnic tensions, he added, “He’s basically telling people that there are no problems.” Tan Sri Abdullah Ahmad, a confidant of Dr Mahathir’s, told The New Yorker that, if anything, corruption has grown worse. “They’re making hay while the sun still shines.”\n\nClash Between Mahathir and Abdullah\n\nSharp differences with Mahathir emerged after Abdullah cancelled the contract for several major projects, including a new bridge to Singapore. In 2007 Mahathir publicly denounced Abdullah, who managed to head off an inner party challenge by using the same autocratic methods Mahathir had employed earlier.\n\nRichard Lloyd Parry wrote in The Times in 2006: “It sounds a depressingly familiar Malaysian story. An outspoken political activist accuses the Prime Minister of being corrupt, authoritarian and intimidating opponents. The two antagonists meet, but the lone crusader refuses to stay silent. Soon he is reporting the inevitable retribution — threats against his relatives, and a whispering campaign casting doubts on his sanity. But this is not the story of an isolated human rights activist or lonely left-wing MP. [Source: Richard Lloyd Parry, The Times, October 30, 2006 ///]\n\n“The figure in question is 80-year-old Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia’s former Prime Minister, famous for his merciless intolerance of dissent and opposition. The object of his denunciations is his successor, 66-year-old Abdullah Badawi, a man known, if anything, for his mildness of temper. For months tension has been rising between the two men. Last week it boiled over, just before the third anniversary of the handover from Dr Mahathir to Mr Abdullah. The older man accuses his one-time protégé of running a “police state”, of tapping text messages and eavesdropping on the internet. ///\n\n“During his 22 years as prime minister, Malaysians grew accustomed to Dr Mahathir’s short fuse and rants against the West, liberal democracy and anything else that upset him. But even they are shaking their heads over the ironies of his latest outburst.” Mahathir’s own record of repression and human rights abuses “which makes his criticisms of Mr Abdullah rather hard to swallow. It is rather as if Margaret Thatcher were to have spent her retirement denouncing John Major for his abrasive manner and refusal to build consensus. Under Abdullah , the press has become more free to criticise the authorities, and alleged Islamic fundamentalists have been released from their detention without trial.\n\nDr Mahathir also accuses Mr Abdullah of improperly helping a relative to obtain contracts under the notorious UN oil-for-food programme in Iraq — accusations that he denies. “In a situation where no one can criticise the Prime Minister, I have to voice my criticisms on matters that do not concern my personal being but only those concerning the interest of the religion, race and country,” Dr M, as he is known, said. “A climate of fear has enveloped this country.” ///\n\nScandals, Corruption and Protests Under Abdullah\n\nThomas Fuller wrote in the New York Times, “Abdullah’s administration has been beset by scandals and controversies that have challenged the prime minister’s now widely mocked nickname, Mr. Clean. A top aide to the deputy prime minister is on trial, charged with abetting the slaying of his Mongolian mistress, a killing that two police commandos who also served as Mr. Abdullah’s bodyguards are charged with carrying out. And the nation was stunned last year by the release of a videotape of a prominent lawyer apparently brokering judicial appointments with a top judge. The videotape was made before Mr. Abdullah came to power but has led to renewed calls for reforms of the judiciary.

It was a pledge to stamp out corruption that won Abdullah a landslide victory in elections in 2004, and the failure to do so saw the government slump to its worst ever election result in March 2008 and eventually forced him out of office.

The 2007 Bersih Rally which was attended by 40,000 people was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on 10 November to campaign for electoral reform. Another rally was held on 25 November in the Malaysian capital led by HINDRAF. The rally organiser, the Hindu Rights Action Force, had called the protest over alleged discriminatory policies favouring ethnic Malays. The crowd was estimated to be between 5,000 and 30,000. In both cases the government and police tried to prevent the gatherings from taking place. In 16 October 2008, HINDRAF was banned when the government labelled the organisation as \"a threat to national security\".

Al-Jazeera reported: “At least 5,000 Malaysians have protested in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, against a steep increase in fuel prices despite a warning from police that the opposition-backed demonstration was illegal. Petrol rose by 40 percent in Malaysia last month, when the government scrapped billions of dollars in fuel subsidies. The authorities banned the rally, saying that organisers did not have the permit needed for gatherings of more than four people. Protesters were undeterred and gathered at a stadium wearing red bandanas and T-shirts bearing the word \"down\" to demand a reduction in oil prices. “Public anger over fuel prices has heightened in recent weeks after the government led by the National Front Coalition increased petrol by 41 percent and diesel by 63 percent.

The opposition alliance now has 82 seats in the 222-member Parliament, a massive jump from its 19 seats in the outgoing house. The result was the coalition's worst electoral performance in the 51 years that it has governed Malaysia following independence from Britain in 1957. Scores of senior National Front officials lost their seats in the federal and state legislatures.

Vijay Joshi of Associated Press wrote: “For the first time since 1969, the National Front lost control of the assembly in northern Penang, the only state where ethnic Chinese are a majority. It also lost control of Selangor, Kedah and Perak states for the first time, and failed to wrest Kelantan state from the opposition. The defeat in Penang was like \"a tsunami coming in,\" said Chang Ko Youn, vice president of Gerakan party, which belongs to the ruling coalition. \"Nobody expected it to be so bad.

Despite being barred from standing in the poll, he organised the opposition campaign, capitalising on rising discontent over unemployment, poverty and the obvious corruption of the BN government.The results were disastrous for UMNO, which had previously relied on discrimination against the country's Chinese and Indian minorities to cement the support of the majority Malays. Anwar's allegation that these discriminatory policies favoured only the tiny Malay elite struck home. For the first time since the 1970s, the ruling coalition lost its two-thirds majority in parliament and thus its ability to amend the constitution at will. In addition, the BN lost power in five of the country's key states.” [Source: Dante Pastrana, World Socialist Web Site, April 2, 2009]\n\nAnwar's People's Justice party won 31 seats in the 222-member National Parliament, the most of any opposition party, and will share power in four of five states now under opposition control. The strongly Islamist Parti Islam se-Malaysia (PAS) will lead or share power in four states, including three — Kedah, Perak and Kelantan — that share borders with Thailand, which has been battling an Islamic insurgency with historical links to Malaysia.

Analysts see it as the foothold that the resurgent opposition needs to eventually break the National Front's stranglehold over power. \"They have not taken care of the people,\" said Michael Lim, a first-time voter in the capital of Kuala Lumpur. \"A lot of promises were made, but nothing fulfilled.\" Although the economy grew by 6.3 percent in 2007, exceeding government expectations of 6 percent, many Malaysians feel the benefits have not trickled down to them.[Source: Associated Press, March 10, 2008]\n\nSee Separate Article 2008 ELECTIONS IN MALAYSIA factsanddetails.com\n\nAbdullah Ahmad Badawi’s Downfall\n\nDante Pastrana wrote in the World Socialist Web Site: “The poor showing by the UMNO in 2008 election plunged the UMNO into crisis. Sections of the UMNO leadership blamed Abdullah and his moderate policies for the defeat. The resurgent opposition got a further political boost after Anwar convincingly won a by-election in August and entered parliament despite the dredging up of new sodomy charges. With Anwar threatening to topple the government, Abdullah's opponents forced him last October to agree to step aside in early 2009. None of the underlying conflicts inside UMNO have been resolved. Sections of the party continue to back economic and political reforms as a means of sustaining the Malaysian economy amid the deepening global recession. [Source: Dante Pastrana, World Socialist Web Site, April 2, 2009]\n\nInitially Abdullah rejected calls to resign after the 2008 election, claiming he won a \"strong\" mandate in elections that gave the opposition its biggest gains in the country's history. He acknowledged that support for his National Front coalition had plunged—from 91 percent of the parliamentary seats to 63 percent - or 140 seats in the 222-member chamber— but said the ruling coalition managed to get a \"strong majority,\" just eight short of two-thirds of the seats, Abdullah said in an interview on state television.\"This is still a mandate given to me. I will not run away from my responsibility to carry out the wishes of the people,\" he said.

News services reported: “The still influential Mahathir, who was prime minister and leader of the UMVO for 22 years until 2003, said he would only return to UMNO after Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi quit as leader. Mahathir urged other UMNO members to quit but not to join the opposition, which is seeking to seize power from the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition by wooing defectors. \"It's like pulling another brick out of the crumbling wall,\" said Tricia Yeoh, director of the Center for Public Policy Studies. \"Once Mahathir resigns, some others will too.\"[Source: Agencies, May 20, 2008]\n\n“If UMNO lawmakers quit the party and declare themselves independents, meaning no party commands a clear majority in parliament, it will send Malaysia into the political wilderness. UMNO, backbone of the 14-party BN that has ruled since independence from Britain in 1957, holds 79 of its 140 seats. The opposition, led by former deputy premier and Mahathir foe Anwar Ibrahim, needs to gain just 30 seats to win a simple majority and form the government.”\n\nIn September 2008, Reuters reported: “A small party in Malaysia's ruling coalition walked out on as Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi ceded his finance job to his increasingly powerful deputy. The Sabah Progressive Party (SAPP) announced it would quit the 14-party Barisan Nasional coalition, three months after it proposed a no-confidence vote against Abdullah, in the first defection in the coalition since March elections. SAPP, which accounts for only two of Barisan's 140 MPs, has little clout but there are concerns that more non-Malay parties could abandon the coalition now headed by Abdullah's UMNO party. \"If UMNO leaders continue to harp on Malay supremacy and race relations continue to strain, I think more non-Malay parties will leave,\" said political analyst Agus Yusoff.[Source: Jalil Hamid, Reutersm September 17, 2008]\n\nAbdullah Ahmad Badawi Retires\n\nIn October 2008, Abdullah announced that he was stepping down because of the poor showing of his party and coalition in the March 2008 general elections. Sean Yoong of Associated Press wrote: “Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi announced that he would not defend his presidency of the party amid intense demands for his resignation. Support for Abdullah has slumped since he led the governing coalition to disastrous losses in March general elections. The government's popularity has plummeted amid racial disputes, a weak economy and corruption claims. It returned to power with only a simple parliamentary majority in March and has since been rattled by opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim's threats to seize power through defections.

Al-Jazeera reported: The move is part of a carefully orchestrated transition that will see Abdullah hand power to his deputy, Najib Abdul Razak. The king has already given his consent for Najib to be sworn in as prime minister, and he is expected to take the oath of office, loyalty and confidentiality at the palace in Kuala Lumpur. [Source: Al-Jazeera, April 2, 2009]\n\n“Abdulla was pressured to step down following a dismal performance by the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition in last year's general elections. He is likely to be remembered for allowing more public freedoms than his predecessor Mahathir Mohamad, who was known for his semi-authoritarian rule during his 22 years in office. But he also failed to fulfil promises to eradicate corruption, reform the judiciary and strengthen institutions such as the police and the civil service. Earlier this week Abdullah told Malaysian media editors that his time in office was marked by \"missed opportunities\", and that the poor electoral showing in 2008 was his biggest regret.”\n\nImage Sources:\n\nText Sources: New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Times of London, Lonely Planet Guides, Library of Congress, Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board, Compton’s Encyclopedia, The Guardian, National Geographic, Smithsonian magazine, The New Yorker, Time, Newsweek, Reuters, AP, AFP, Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic Monthly, The Economist, Foreign Policy, Wikipedia, BBC, CNN, and various books, websites and other publications.\n\nLast updated June 2015"
