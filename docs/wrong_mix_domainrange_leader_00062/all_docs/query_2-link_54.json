        "text": "On April 28, 2011, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao met respectively with former Malaysian prime ministers Mahathir Mohamad and Abdullah Haji Ahmad Badawi in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nIn his meeting with Mahathir, Wen spoke highly of Mahathir's contributions to boosting relations between China and Malaysia, as well as ties between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Calling Mahathir an influential senior statesman in Asia and an old friend of the Chinese people, Wen praised Mahathir's important contributions to the development of bilateral ties. Wen said the former Malaysian leader has for many times spoken out boldly with a sense of justice on issues concerning China and has actively pushed for the launch of China-ASEAN dialogue relationship. The good situation in China-Malaysia relations today is inseparable from the positive efforts made by Mahathir. The Chinese government attaches great importance to its relations with Malaysia, and is willing to work with all who commit to bilateral friendship to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields so as to continue bringing bilateral ties to higher stages, the Chinese premier said.\n\nMahathir, for his part, expressed warm welcome for Premier Wenâs visit and said the visit is of vital importance to boosting bilateral ties. Further deepening mutually beneficial cooperation in economy and trade, finance and infrastructure is in the interests of both countries, he said. Under the current circumstances, it will better serve the common interests of East Asian countries to promote unity and deepen cooperation under existing mechanisms, Mahathir added.\n\nWhen meeting with Badawi, Wen said the former Malaysian leader is an old friend of the Chinese people and applauded his major contributions to promoting the friendship between the two countries. Wen particularly hailed Badawi's efforts in the establishment of the China-Malaysia strategic cooperative relations, which brought bilateral relations to a new phase. Wen also expressed the hope that Badawi would continue to care for and support the China-Malaysia friendship cause and contribute to the long-term, sound and stable development of bilateral ties.\n\nBadawi said he was rejoiced to see the development of bilateral relations during his term as Malaysian prime minister, adding that he was greatly honored to serve as a Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) director and would remain committed to further strengthening bilateral cooperation in fields such as economy and trade, humanities, education, and traditional Chinese medicine. He believed bilateral relations will achieve greater development."
