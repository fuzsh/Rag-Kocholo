        "text": "The Telegraph\n\nWhy has Obama not endorsed Harris?\n\nBarack Obama and Kamala Harris go back more than two decades. She campaigned for him in 2004, when he was an unknown candidate for the Senate and she was San Francisco’s district attorney.\n\nFuturism\n\nElon Musk, With Tesla Factories in China, Tweets AI Video of Chinese President Xi Jinping Wearing Pooh Clothes\n\nUnplugged Tesla has to drive on rocky ground in China, where sales have slumped and its availability is subject to government approval. So it's head scratching that Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted an AI video that seems to disrespect China's leader Xi Jinping on the social media platform X-formerly-Twitter, which should drive any Tesla execs […]\n\nThe Hill\n\nHarris vs. Trump: What the polls tell us\n\nPresident Biden is out of the 2024 race and backing Vice President Harris to take over his mantle in November, raising questions about what the polling can help us glean about her chances against former President Trump. Though Harris still has to win over enough delegates before the party’s national convention next month in order…\n\nThe Telegraph\n\n‘You’re full of s---, you must quit,’ Secret Service chief told over failure to stop Trump shooting\n\nThe director of the US Secret Service was told she was “full of s---” during an excruciating congressional hearing in which she was told she should resign.\n\nSky News\n\nHow the sending of one photo led an 11-year-old girl to become a victim of physical sex abuse\n\nA mother has told Sky News how her 11-year-old daughter was groomed into sending sexually explicit photographs of herself to men online and how this spiralled into physical sexual abuse. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) says this is a growing problem and self-generated child abuse images - where a child is encouraged by someone online into sexualised behaviour - now makes up a large proportion of the imagery that they are removing from the internet. It is calling on the new government to make keeping children safe online a priority."
