        "text": "1. Preface by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson\n\nJust over two centuries ago, the first holder of the office of British Foreign Secretary persuaded the House of Commons to strike a blow against unconscionable suffering by abolishing the slave trade.\n\nCharles James Fox was desperately ill when he rose to address the House on 10 June 1806 – indeed he had only three months to live – yet after his passionate advocacy had won the day, he declared that he could “retire from public life with comfort and the conscious satisfaction that I had done my duty”.\n\nThanks to Fox’s skills as a parliamentary gladiator – and the Herculean efforts of, among others, William Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson – Britain became the first country to abolish the slave trade the following year, 1807, whereupon the Royal Navy devoted its strength to stamping out a vile traffic in human beings.\n\nWhen I reflect on the efforts of the modern Foreign Office to promote human rights around the world, I am conscious of the example we must strive to follow. Promoting the values that Britain holds dear is not an optional extra, still less a vainglorious addition to our diplomacy; it is in keeping with centuries of tradition. This is part of who we are.\n\nOur report on the state of human rights in 2016 will, of necessity, make for bleakly realistic reading. In these pages, you will find our assessment of the troubling situations in our priority countries.\n\nBut there are also bright spots. You will learn about the groundbreaking conference we held in the Foreign Office last October on how freedom of religion and belief can aid the struggle against violent extremism.\n\nYou will find examples of how we are helping millions of girls to attend school; how our diplomats are combating human trafficking, curbing child marriage and campaigning against female genital mutilation. You will read about Britain’s efforts to protect the rights of LGB&T people and our actions to cope with the migration and refugee crises.\n\nYou will also discover how the Foreign Office is continuing Fox’s work by tackling the cruel phenomenon of modern slavery, a tragedy that blights the lives of people from rich and poor countries alike.\n\nIn February, I was delighted to appoint Joanna Roper as the FCO’s Special Envoy for Gender Equality, helping us to place gender equality at the heart of all we do.\n\nIn surveying these fields of activity, I am convinced they are right in and of themselves. But Fox and the Abolitionists can teach us another lesson. By straining every nerve and sinew to eradicate the slave trade, Britain did not damage its prosperity; on the contrary, the era when our fleets pursued the traffickers on every ocean was also the time of the industrial revolution.\n\nHuman rights are not inimical to development and prosperity; the opposite is true. Freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom to practice whatever religion you want and live your life as you please, provided you do no harm, are the essential features of a dynamic and open society, filled with the spirit of innovation and enterprise that triggers economic growth.\n\nSo promoting human rights is an essential aim of the foreign policy of a Global Britain. To do otherwise would be unthinkable for anyone inspired by the example of Charles James Fox.\n\nThe Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP, Foreign Secretary\n\n2. Foreword by Minister for Human Rights Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon\n\nIt was an honour to be appointed last month as Foreign and Commonwealth Minister with responsibility for Human Rights and Modern Slavery, and as the Prime Minister’s Special Representative on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict. I pay tribute to my predecessor, the Rt Hon Baroness Anelay of St Johns, for her dedicated work on these issues.\n\nHuman rights are more than just principles enshrined in international law. They are the bedrock of successful and progressive societies. Evidence shows that countries where human rights are respected tend to be more prosperous, democratic and stable. Corruption is less likely to take root, and extremism is less likely to find fertile ground.\n\nThat is why safeguarding, promoting and defending human rights, including freedom of religion or belief, is a key and integral part of the work of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. British diplomats put human rights at the heart of everything they do, working in partnership with foreign governments and civil society, particularly in our 30 Human Rights Priority Countries. We also fund frontline work through programme funds, such as our Magna Carta Fund for Human Rights and Democracy and the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund.\n\nWe take great pride in being a consistent champion of human rights at multilateral fora, including the UN and the Commonwealth. The UK was re-elected last October to serve a further three-year term on the UN Human Rights Council, and remains as committed as ever to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and meeting the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals. The UK was proud to play an instrumental role in securing a mandate last year for the UN’s first Independent Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nIn the Commonwealth, we work closely with our partners to promote the shared values of human rights, democracy and rule of law enshrined in the Commonwealth Charter. Next April’s Commonwealth Summit – which I am delighted will be hosted in London – offers an opportunity to celebrate our strengths and deliver a re-energised Commonwealth that champions democratic values on the global stage.\n\nOur Annual Human Rights Report reviews developments over the last twelve months. This year it paints a stark picture of continued human rights violations and abuses in Syria, Iraq, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and many other countries across every continent.\n\nHowever, the picture is not unremittingly bleak, and the UK has been instrumental in promoting and protecting human rights in many areas around the world. For example, a landmark Human Rights Council Resolution at the UN, co-tabled and driven forward by the UK, successfully encouraged the Sri Lankan Government to continue making progress on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights, in line with its commitments.\n\nIn Bahrain, the Ministry of Interior committed to address concerns about prison conditions at Jau Rehabilitation and Reformation Centre, following an inspection report by the Prisoners and Detainees Rights Commission – a body established and supported through UK technical assistance.\n\nWe have seen a significant breakthrough for LGB&T rights in Belize and the Seychelles, where consensual same sex relations have recently been decriminalised. In Belize, it was UK-based legal organisations which provided support during the three-year court case which resulted in decriminalisation. In the Seychelles, the UK helped to bring about this ruling through a combination of diplomatic lobbying (both locally and in international fora) and low-cost supportive programme work.\n\nAll these examples prove that a sustained and determined approach to safeguarding, protecting and promoting human rights can bring about real change. Looking ahead, I would like to highlight three areas that the UK Government will prioritise in the coming months.\n\nThe first is modern slavery, a human rights violation that our Prime Minister has pledged to eradicate. Our Modern Slavery Act 2015 was the first formal step. I am pleased to serve on the Prime Minister’s Implementation Taskforce, established last year to ensure that all of Government, business and civil society plays its part in eradicating this evil crime. The UK is committed to ending this scourge by 2030 – a goal agreed by all 193 UN Member States at the Sustainable Development Summit in 2015. Our diplomatic network plays a crucial role in building international consensus and translating political will into practical action.\n\nSecondly, we are strengthening our efforts to prevent and respond to sexual violence. As the Prime Minister’s Special Representative for Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict, this will be a personal priority. I intend to build upon the good work already begun to increase education and understanding of how to eradicate the stigma that unfairly afflicts survivors of sexual violence. 2016 saw the launch of that campaign, through which we held a series of workshops in conflict-affected countries and hosted a conference that identified key recommendations to help tackle stigma. I shall present and garner support for our new Principles for Global Action at the UN General Assembly in September.\n\nThe third area that I’d like to expand on is our critical work on freedom of religion or belief. As the Prime Minister said at a 10 Downing Street reception for faith leaders on 28 February, “We must reaffirm our determination to stand up for the freedom of people of all religions to practice their beliefs in peace and safety”. It will be a key priority to drive forward our international efforts to build more cohesive, tolerant and peaceful societies, where people of all faiths and none are equal citizens of the country in which they live. This also involves the crucial work of building international consensus and collaboration to tackle extremism and radicalisation online. In October, the FCO convened faith leaders, academics, civil society and diplomats for a groundbreaking conference exploring how tolerant and inclusive societies with a strong respect for human rights are more immune to the disease of violent extremism, and the ideological basis of non-violent extremism. Building on this foundation, I will take a fresh look at how the UK can lead the charge in tackling discrimination and persecution of religious communities around the world.\n\nThis Annual Report shows the progress we’ve made, but also the extensive and urgent work that remains to be done. I look forward to leading a dedicated team to ensure the UK remains a committed and consistent advocate for the promotion and protection of universal human rights.\n\nLord Ahmad of Wimbledon\n\nPrime Minister’s Special Representative on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict and Minister of State for the Commonwealth and the UN at the Foreign & Commonwealth Office\n\n3. Chapter I: Democratic Values and Rule of Law\n\n3.1 Introduction\n\n2016 was another year of mixed results for democracy and the rule of law. Some countries took significant steps forward, but others went into reverse. This reminds us that progress towards wider and deeper respect for democratic values and the rule of law is neither linear nor inevitable. It has to be worked for. Achievements hard won by earlier generations, sometimes over decades, can be lost if subsequent generations do not safeguard that progress. Democracy and the rule of law are still denied to many. Some have never enjoyed these rights. Others have seen them taken away. Others, more fortunately, are living in states and societies where the progress is positive.\n\nThe United Kingdom pursues a foreign policy based on deep respect for universal human rights and the rule of law. Our history informs our present and future behaviour. Equal political participation for all men and women took centuries to achieve in the UK; we urge all countries to find ways to allow their citizens to take part in political processes without discrimination. Freedom of Religion or Belief was fought for in the UK over generations; we continue to press for those freedoms to be respected around the world. The UK was a leading force in the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade; and in 2016 the Prime Minister declared our intention to be a leading force in the eradication of modern slavery. Our tradition as a progressive, values-conscious society continues.\n\nDemocracy is a multifaceted concept. It includes, but is not limited to, the concept of a system of government and public administration of the people for the people. This cannot be achieved without full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the wide range of international conventions which have been broadly adopted and ratified by the international community in the decades since the Second World War.\n\nThe UK will continue to work to promote those rights and benefits where they are currently denied, and as we do so we remind ourselves that the hard-won gains of past decades can never be taken for granted, anywhere.\n\n3.2 Democracy\n\nDemocracy continued to come under threat in 2016. At the extreme, three countries – The Gambia, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Burundi - saw attempts to delay or avoid democratic electoral processes altogether. Elsewhere, governments increasingly used spurious excuses to justify more authoritarian measures to restrict civil society space. The UK considers such moves to be counter-productive: democracy not only allows individuals to exercise their rights as citizens but is also the best method of government for promoting both prosperity and security. Societies thrive and prosper when innovation and new ideas are encouraged. Societies in which people are allowed to express their dissent without fear are less likely to see people resorting to take non-democratic means to have their voice heard.\n\nThe UK wants to work with others to continue to promote the benefits of democracy – for states and citizens. In December 2016, the UK became the 30th member of the Governing Council of the Community of Democracies, a group of like-minded states which exists to promote democracy and strengthen democratic institutions. We intend to play an active role in the Community of Democracies, including in its working group on protecting civil society. We will also continue to support the work of the Freedom Online Coalition to promote respect for freedom of expression in the virtual world.\n\n3.3 Elections\n\nThe UK continues to emphasise the importance of free and fair elections as fundamental elements of a functioning democracy.\n\nThe observation of elections plays an important part in that work; it gives more credibility to elections in those countries which seek to improve their democratic procedures and sends a powerful message to those who try to abuse the system. Credible observation can help to build voter confidence, reduce fraud and prevent violence and intimidation, supporting the smooth transfer of power and increasing participation in democratic processes. The Commonwealth continued to demonstrate its strength in this area, running observer missions to several countries in 2016. In 2016, the UK provided election observers to observation missions in several countries, including Russia, Ghana, Serbia and Kazakhstan.\n\nEnsuring that elections are free and fair and that citizens feel empowered and safe to participate is important in all democracies, even those which are long-established. It is particularly important in countries in democratic transition and in fragile states, or where democracy is under threat. 2016 saw successful elections in a number of countries, including Seychelles and Ghana.\n\nAs far as the Overseas Territories[footnote 1] are concerned, in December, the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) elected its first ever female Premier. A commonwealth Parliamentary Association mission observed the election. The mission reported that although the process was broadly well managed, it could be simplified; and that TCI should review its Elections Ordinance. Successful elections were also held in Ascension Island, Tristan da Cunha and the Pitcairn Islands. Where practicable, the UK Government encourages territories to receive independent observers, and stands ready to support any territories that require support.\n\nWestminster Foundation for Democracy\n\nThe Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD) is an executive Non-Departmental Public Body funded mainly by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Department for International Development (DFID). WFD allows the UK to share its democratic experience and expertise - its work is complementary to the government’s diplomatic and development efforts in advancing human rights.\n\nWFD supports the UK’s objectives of increasing security and prosperity by supporting democratic systems around the world. It works in partnership with UK political parties and with the Parliaments and Assemblies in Westminster, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to strengthen the effectiveness and accountability of their counterparts in more than 40 countries. It also provides electoral assistance to ensure fair and transparent elections.\n\nIn 2016, WFD’s work supported actions on human rights in a range of countries. In Georgia, WFD’s research on parliamentary human rights committees helped a reform of rules of procedure in the Georgian Parliament. This resulted in legislators making substantial recommendations to government on the national ‘Human Rights Action Plan’ for the first time.\n\nWFD deployed its human rights assessment tool, developed in partnership with the University of Oxford, to help diagnose the state of parliamentary democracy and assess development needs in Macedonia, Morocco, Serbia, Tunisia, Uganda and Ukraine. In Indonesia, WFD provided training and assistance to parliamentary committee clerks, resulting in provisions for the protection of human rights being added to the draft ‘Bill on the Amendment of Counter-terrorism Law’. In Venezuela, WFD completed the first year of a two year Magna Carta Fund project to help strengthen the National Assembly’s procedures.\n\nOver the last 12 months, WFD has mainstreamed the political participation and representation of women and youth throughout its country programmes. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, WFD helped to encourage more women to stand as candidates in local elections. In Kyrgyzstan, WFD helped develop a women’s caucus. It also supported the Coalition of Women MPs from Arab Countries in drafting the Arab League ‘Convention to tackle violence against women’ and in campaigning to reform sexual violence laws in Lebanon, Jordan and Tunisia .\n\nFrom a ‘Youth Academy’ for Africa to the International Young Democrat Union, WFD continued to enable UK political parties to develop initiatives to encourage greater representation of young people in the political process.\n\nIn 2017, WFD is committed to improving representation of marginalised groups in democracies across Africa while it continues to support women’s empowerment in the Western Balkans and the Middle East. In Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Uganda, WFD will activate partnerships with local civil society organisations to increase youth participation in the political debate.\n\nFreedom of Expression\n\nThe rights of individuals to express opinions, peacefully challenge authority and take part in public policy-making and administration are essential to a free and open society. Similarly governments should embrace the concept of citizens working together and creating movements and organisations to share values and promote views, rather than seeing this as a threat. Freedom of expression is essential to exercising human rights; when it is under threat, or restricted, human rights in general are challenged or diminished.\n\nSuccessful societies encourage innovation and the development of new ideas. Societies which deny freedom of expression also deny themselves the opportunity to benefit from new approaches and fail to make the most of the talents of their citizens. The role of a functioning independent media is more important than ever, challenging “fake news”, and providing accurate, independent and verifiable information.\n\nFreedom House’s Freedom of the Press report for 2016 estimated that only 13% of the world’s population lives in a country with a free press – defined as a country where political reporting is robust, where journalists are able to operate safely and where state intrusion into media affairs is minimal and does not generate onerous legal or economic pressures. At the same time, the role of journalists remains challenging and dangerous.\n\nReporters Without Borders recorded the deaths of 78 journalists, citizen journalists or assistants in 2016. Impunity for crimes against journalists remains a significant problem in many countries. Governments have used a number of pretexts for restricting media freedom, including security and the need to protect against defamation.\n\nIn Burma, the 2013 Telecommunications Act has been used increasingly to imprison journalists for defamation.\n\nMalaysia, Vietnam and Thailand continued to take action to restrict political expression critical of the government. In Malaysia a number of opposition politicians, human rights activists, journalists and social media users were charged under existing laws, including the Sedition Act; some were detained without trial. In Vietnam a growing number of bloggers and activists were imprisoned for peacefully stating their views on matters of legitimate public interest. Since the military government took power in Thailand, sedition and lèse-majesté laws have been used to restrict the media, free speech and the right to protest, and harsh sentences have been applied in some instances.\n\nJournalists and civil society activists were vulnerable to intimidation and attack in many countries affected by conflict, including Syria, Yemen and Libya: and general restrictions on democracy and freedom of expression and association were imposed in Egypt and Turkey. In its latest Global Impunity Index, published in October 2016, the Committee to Protect Journalists ranked Somalia as “the worst place in the world to be a journalist” as a result of the high number of journalists killed without subsequent convictions.\n\nThe UK Government strongly believes that the rights people enjoy offline also need to be protected online. We have participated actively in the Freedom Online Coalition, an inter-governmental grouping which seeks to promote and protect internet freedom and to work with business and civil society to address issues relating to online freedom of expression. In 2016, there were deliberate internet shutdowns in more than 50 countries including Ethiopia, India and Uganda. The Brookings Institute estimated the economic impact of such shutdowns to be around £2 billion. To counter this, the FCO supported the #Keepiton project, led by Access Now. The project reports on and challenges attempts by governments to disrupt or shut down the internet. In 2016 we also funded civil society organisations to implement work promoting freedom of expression in Burma, Central Asia and East Africa.\n\nSirikan Charoensiri, known as June, is a Thai human rights defender and lawyer who faces several charges including sedition, for defending basic legal rights. Her case will be heard in a military court and she could face up to 15 years in jail. The British Embassy in Thailand works hard to support those who are defending human rights. The British government is a long term supporter of Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, funding projects to offer legal assistance and develop their network beyond Bangkok. These projects help to better report and document cases of human rights abuses. The British Embassy has hosted several civil society events, helping members to meet and network, developing wider support. Beyond this the British Government continues to raise June’s case and have also made statements at the UN about the need to increase the protection of human rights defenders. The embassy continues to monitor June’s case closely, providing visible and vocal support.\n\nHuman Rights Defenders\n\nHuman Rights Defenders are at the forefront of work to promote and protect human rights and democracy, often at great personal risk to themselves. In many places they are persecuted, imprisoned, attacked or even killed because of their work. Around half of the killings of human rights defenders relate to the issue of environmental protection and land rights, often in connection with business activities and large infrastructure projects or extractive industries. Other disturbing trends include the targeting of the family members of human rights defenders as a tactic of intimidation. Laws restricting civil society space are used in many countries to limit the ability of human rights defenders to operate or to receive external assistance in the form of funding or capacity building.\n\nThe FCO continues to work with and support a wide range of organisations committed to helping human rights defenders either through emergency assistance or by building their capacity to protect themselves. In 2016 we worked with the University of York’s Centre for Applied Human Rights in the development of its Human Rights Defenders Hub, which aims to bring practitioners and human rights defenders together to share experience and best practice and develop practical tools for defenders. We also supported the Centre’s Protective Fellowship Scheme, which helps defenders to develop new skills. Working together with the Hub, we organised a visit of human rights defenders to meet FCO country desk officers, an enriching experience which we will repeat.\n\nUsing the Magna Carta Fund we supported projects to support the protection of human rights defenders in a number of countries, including Afghanistan and Colombia.\n\nRestriction of Civil Society space\n\nThe restriction of civil society space was an increasing problem in 2016, limiting civil society’s ability to operate and restricting freedom of expression and democracy. Measures included clamping down on media freedom, or introducing regulations to prevent NGOs from operating, for example by limiting their ability to receive funding.\n\nThe organisation CIVICUS assesses civil society space as being “closed” in a number of countries, including Libya, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Vietnam, and “repressed” in many more, including Russia, China, Turkey and Thailand.\n\nRestrictions often take the form of requirements for organisations to be officially approved and registered or limitations on access to funding. In Eritrea, the UN and bilateral aid agencies are prevented by law from funding civil society organisations, and in Jordan and Egypt advance approval is needed from government bodies in order to receive foreign finance.\n\nDuring 2016, Russia continued to apply the Foreign Agents Law and the Law on Undesirable Organisations, as a result of which 42 domestic NGOs were labelled as “foreign agents” and three international organisations were classed as “undesirable”. The British Embassy intervened when an attempt was made to close the Moscow office of Amnesty International. The definition of activities under the “foreign agents” law was broadened and for the first time the regulation was used to close down an NGO and bring criminal charges.\n\nMore positively, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in 2016 revised its Recommendation 8 (International Standards on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation) and interpretative note covering the abuse of non-profit organisations for money laundering and terrorism. This Recommendation had been misused in many countries to restrict the ability of legitimate civil society organisations to operate. The updated guidance, which the UK supported, takes a more risk-based and proportionate approach, recognising that the risk of abuse for criminal or terrorist purposes applies only to a minority of civil society organisations.\n\n3.4 Non-Discrimination\n\nRights of Women and Girls\n\nIn 2016, the UK’s gender priorities were the elimination of violence against women and girls, including Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) and Child and Early Forced Marriage (CEFM), tackling discriminatory laws and practices, and promoting gender equality (including political and economic empowerment).\n\nAt the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) in March, the UK advocated an ambitious agenda and worked hard with other UN Member States to secure an agreed conclusions document which reflected all UN adopted Resolutions and pressed for an end to all forms of violence against women and girls, including FGM and CEFM.\n\nDespite the progress that was achieved at the UN level and elsewhere in 2016, significant challenges remained. These included: ending the many different and pervasive forms of violence against women; securing sexual health and reproductive rights; achieving gender equality in the workplace and in political and public life; and women’s economic empowerment and equal access to education. But it remained the case that the human rights of women and girls, including adequate healthcare and access to justice, were often restricted at the provincial and community levels even in countries where good domestic protections exist on paper.\n\nThroughout 2016, the UK continued to be a world leader in advancing work on the UN’s Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda. In September, we hosted the annual UN Peacekeeping Defence Ministerial with delegates from 80 countries. Our 2016 WPS priorities reflect the importance of non-discrimination in conflict resolution and security work. From November 2016 all UK troops deployed on overseas missions have received WPS training. WPS training will also be included in all training packages delivered overseas. We also prioritised working with Iraq and Afghanistan in implementing their National Action Plans and promoted women’s participation in peace/post-conflict processes in Syria, Yemen, South Sudan and Somalia. We also prioritised working for women’s participation at relevant international events.\n\nIn 2016, the Magna Carta Fund for Human Rights and Democracy allocated over £1.5 million to 16 women’s rights projects, and over £3 million was allocated to a further 19 women’s rights projects from the FCO’s Rules-Based International System fund. These included projects focused on encouraging political leadership, legislative reforms and regional cooperation in order to produce a safer environment for women and girls in ten North African and Middle Eastern countries. We provided funding for a number of women’s rights projects in India, including one aimed at tackling violence and discrimination against Dalit women, and one on improving women’s access to justice. In Fiji the UK worked closely with Fijian NGOs to enhance the participation of young women and girls in policy making and human rights advocacy.\n\nThe UK hosted visits by several overseas delegations, including from China and India, enabling us to share experience from our domestic response to the problem of Violence Against Women and Girls. The FCO’s “Week of Women 2016”, held in association with the Women of the Future Programme and Wilton Park, was aimed at supporting, connecting and inspiring the next generation of female leaders from around the world bringing together more than 300 women from 28 countries. The “Week” included an event hosted at the FCO which looked at the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination that hold women back. Around 70 Chevening Scholars – mainly women – attended the event and a subsequent networking lunch with FCO officials working on human rights policy.\n\nIn 2016, the decision was taken to create the role of the Special Envoy for Gender Equality; a senior UK diplomat (Joanna Roper) was appointed to the position. In 2017 she will lead the FCO’s efforts to deliver on the Foreign Secretary’s commitment to a foreign policy that produces tangible results for women and girls’ equality.\n\nAt the UK–Overseas Territories Joint Ministerial Council in December 2015, UK and Overseas Territories Governments reaffirmed their commitment to work together to extend outstanding core UN human rights conventions to those territories where these had not been extended already. The extension of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), to the populated Overseas Territories was one of the recommendations of the CEDAW Committee during its examination of the UK’s seventh periodic report on CEDAW. In 2016, the UK marked the 30th anniversary of its ratification of CEDAW, by extending ratification to Anguilla and Cayman Islands, the first territorial extensions since 1986. This was followed by requests for extension of CEDAW ratification by the Pitcairn Islands and by St Helena, Tristan da Cunhaand Ascension Island.\n\nThe then FCO Minister for Human Rights, Baroness Anelay chaired a panel discussion on IDAHOBIT (International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia) 17 May with experts from the Human Dignity Trust and Kaleidoscope Trust to consider the ongoing criminalisation in 36 countries across the Commonwealth.\n\nLesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGB&T) Rights\n\nThe authorities in many countries actively persecute LGB&T people. Consensual same-sex relations remain criminalised in 75 jurisdictions, including the majority of Commonwealth countries. Even in countries where consensual same-sex relations are legal, many people still face violence and discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This results from a number of factors, including: state-sanctioned homophobia, biphobia or transphobia; a lack of adequate legal protection; poor enforcement of existing protections which can lead to impunity for those committing acts of violence or discrimination; harmful social norms; stigmatisation of LGB&T people. In many countries, LGB&T people are subject to hate crime.\n\nThe UK is committed to protecting and promoting the rights of LGB&T people and to supporting the legal, cultural and social change required to make equality a reality for LGB&T people the world over.\n\nIn 2016, both the Seychelles and Nauru decriminalised consensual same-sex relations, partly in response to international pressure. A successful legal challenge led to decriminalisation in Belize. We continue to urge all countries to decriminalise consensual same-sex relations and put in place legislation that protects LGB&T people from discrimination - including in the workplace and in the provision of goods and services.\n\nThrough our Embassies and High Commissions we monitor and raise human rights concerns around the world. LGB&T equality remains a sensitive subject for many countries and much of this diplomatic lobbying is carried out behind closed doors and is not reported on.\n\nIn 2016, we continued to support the work of the UN Free and Equal Campaign which raises awareness of homophobic, biphobic and transphobic discrimination and violence, and promotes tolerance, equality and greater respect for the rights of LGB&T people everywhere. The FCO also worked to create space at the international level for LGB&T equality to be discussed, debated and celebrated. In June, FCO staff in Moscow, Ekaterinburg and St Petersburg set up a number of media interviews during Sir Ian McKellen’s visit to Russia as a ‘Shakespeare in Film’ Ambassador. He was able to share his personal story and set out his strong advocacy of LGB&T equality.\n\nIn November, the Embassy in Bangkok hosted an event on tackling violence and discrimination to tie in with the International Lesbian and Gay Association conference, drawing attention to the UK’s efforts to promote and protect LGB&T rights, and supporting the role of Human Rights Defenders. Participation in Pride celebrations provided the opportunity for a large number of British diplomats to signal strong solidarity with LGB&T communities worldwide.\n\nIn 2016, we worked with partner countries and through international organisations, including the UN, EU, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe and the Commonwealth, to promote inclusion and to celebrate diversity. In June, the UK strongly supported the establishment by the UN Human Rights Council of the first ever UN Independent Expert on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity. We subsequently used our global diplomatic network and influence to help achieve the necessary support to defend his mandate when it came under attack at the UN General Assembly. We remain committed to supporting Mr Vitit Muntarbhorn in his important work.\n\nThe UK is a founder member of the new Equal Rights Coalition, which brings together more than 30 countries which are committed to working together to promote LGB&T equality globally. The Coalition was launched at the Global LGBTI Human Rights Conference in Montevideo in July 2016.\n\nThe UK Government continues to offer a consular marriage service to same-sex couples (one of whom must be a British national) in 26 countries. By offering these services we have drawn attention to the lack of local legislation for same-sex marriages and prompted wider discussion of LGB&T issues.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2018 the FCO’s Magna Carta Fund for Human Rights and Democracy will provide over £1.5 million funding to projects promoting and protecting the rights of LGB&T people in projects working in over 15 countries.\n\nThe UK Government is committed to working with Governments of Overseas Territories to tackle all forms of discrimination and strengthen compliance with our shared international obligations. Generally, respect for LGB&T rights in the Overseas Territories continued to lag behind the UK mainland. Nevertheless there were some examples of progress in 2016. Same-sex marriage was legalised in Ascension Island, the British Indian Ocean Territory and Gibraltar. In respect of the Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs) of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, which have a sizeable UK Armed Forces population, the authorities notified the UK Government that there was no objection to marriages and conversions of civil partnerships being conducted within its territory under UK Armed Forces laws. The first same-sex marriage in the SBAs took place in September.\n\nChild Rights\n\nChildren are impacted disproportionately by violence, discrimination, poverty and marginalisation, affecting their health, education and overall development, and putting them at an increased risk of exploitation, abuse and trafficking. The protection and promotion of children’s human rights, including those of children who are victims of armed conflict and children at risk of abduction and exploitation, form an important part of the FCO’s wider international human rights agenda.\n\nAt the March UN Human Rights Council, the UK co-sponsored the annual Resolution on the Rights of the Child, which had as its theme “information and communications technologies and child sexual exploitation”. This called upon all states to recognise that, while information technology is a powerful and transformative force for growth with the potential to enrich young people’s lives and offer opportunities which earlier generations never experienced, it also enables new forms of criminality to which children are especially vulnerable. The UK is committed to supporting UN member states in building their capabilities in the area of online child sexual exploitation, and pledged £50 million to tackle this crime.\n\nThe UK co-sponsored the Resolution on the Right to Education by Every Girl which was adopted unanimously at the June 2016 UN Human Rights Council. We also hosted the Girls’ Education Forum 2016 to stimulate action on the world stage. We have supported education for the most vulnerable. At the Syria Conference which the UK hosted in February 2016, global commitments were made for vulnerable and refugee children to have access to education of a high quality. Increasing girls’ access to education is linked to population growth at replacement rates, with consequent benefits in areas such as food security. It also acts as a multiplier, by enabling girls to enjoy their human rights, including to equal participation in public life and in making decisions which affect their own lives.\n\nIn 2016, the UK continued to build on the success of the Girl Summit held in London in July 2014, through work nationally and internationally to support the international movement to eliminate Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) and Child and Early Forced Marriage (CEFM). The UK is committed to work with its partners to end FGM and CEFM within a generation. On 1 December the Home Secretary hosted a meeting to discuss continuing efforts to tackle this issue, including through UK-led programmes in over 25 high-prevalence countries. At the UN Human Rights Council the UK is a member of the core group for the CEFM Resolution and also strongly supported the CEFM resolution at the UN General Assembly in November.\n\nOur Embassies and High Commissions continued to play an important role in our work to protect and promote the rights of children. The High Commission in Kuala Lumpur facilitated the UK National Crime Agency (NCA) helping the Malaysian authorities to secure convictions for 71 child abuse offences mostly committed in Malaysia. In August, the NCA office at the Embassy in Santo Domingo facilitated access by the authorities in the Dominican Republic to technology which will allow its judiciary and investigators to identify individuals using the internet to share images of child sexual exploitation and abuse.\n\nThe UK continues to work in partnership with the Governments of the Overseas Territories to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. Through the development of its multi-year programme, the UK Government aims to harness UK expertise to promote transformative and sustainable change. The UK Government continues to ensure child safeguarding remains a political priority for the Overseas Territories.\n\nRights of Persons with Disabilities\n\nIn 2016, much of our work on the rights, promotion and protection of persons with disabilities was focused on the UN. The UK actively engaged on resolutions at the Human Rights Council in 2016 focusing on disability. Themes included “the rights of persons with disabilities in situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies” and “Protection of the family: role of the family in supporting the protection and promotion of human rights of persons with disabilities”.\n\nIn May, the UK Delegation to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in Vienna facilitated the attendance of activists from UK civil society organisation, Scope, at an event on the participation of persons with disabilities in political and public life. The meeting brought together representatives from the governments of the OSCE’s participating states as well as from civil society.\n\nScope’s representatives were able to share positive practices and experiences from the UK, and to promote its ‘End the Awkward’ campaign, which uses humour to encourage people to think differently about disability, break down negative attitudes towards disabled people, and help people feel more comfortable when talking about disability.\n\nIn June 2016, the UK sent a Ministerial-led delegation to the 9th Conference of States Parties to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The theme of the conference was “Implementing the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals by the year 2030 for all persons with disabilities: ‘Leaving no one behind’”.\n\nWe supported the Rehabilitation International World Congress on Disability and Inclusion held in Edinburgh on 25-27 October. This event attracted speakers and delegates from more than 50 countries. It was focused on promoting social inclusion and accessibility.\n\nIn November, we hosted a Ministerial panel event entitled: Delivering on the commitment to ‘Leave No One Behind’: Working together to break down barriers to women’s economic and political participation. We invited Rahma Elsiddig, a Sudanese disability activist and Programme Manager for ADD International – Action on Disability and Development - to speak on the intersection between gender discrimination and disability rights and on ADD’s confidence-building work to enable disabled people to challenge social norms, barriers and preconceptions that prevent many disabled women from enjoying their rights on a full and equal basis.\n\nIn 2016, we continued to advocate that states should sign and ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD), including through use of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism at the UN Human Rights Council.\n\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) ratified the UN CRPD in November. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that the DPRK has implemented any of the other international human rights treaties which it had previously ratified. Together with other partners, the UK maintained its engagement with the DPRK authorities to press for better treatment of the most vulnerable groups in North Korean society, including children, women and disabled persons.\n\nThrough announcements made on 3 December (International Day for Persons with Disabilities) and the DFID 2016 Bilateral Development Review, the UK is committed to driving action to improve the lives of people with disabilities in developing countries, ensuring that people with disabilities are systematically included in and benefit from international aid and humanitarian assistance.\n\n3.5 Human Rights and the Private Sector\n\nBusiness and Human Rights\n\nOn 12 May, the UK Government published an update to the National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights. This followed the publication of our original action plan in September 2013, when the UK became the first government to commit to the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles (UNGPs) on business and human rights.\n\nThe updated National Action Plan reaffirms the government’s belief that the promotion of business and respect for human rights go hand in hand. It set out some of the steps we have taken or supported since the original plan was published and the commitments we have met. These include the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act, in particular the Transparency in Supply Chains provision which requires companies with a turnover above £36 million to publish an annual report setting out the steps which they have taken to eradicate slavery throughout their operations and in their supply chains.\n\nWe have continued to encourage other governments to develop similar measures for the implementation of the UNGPs both bilaterally and by setting out in international fora our experience of developing our National Action Plan. In 2016 we also participated in the annual UN Forum on business and human rights in Geneva, presenting on the Modern Slavery Act, and in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Responsible Business Forum in June.\n\nWe have supported a number of other initiatives to promote business and human rights. The Corporate Human Rights Benchmark is collaboration between investors and civil society to measure the human rights performance of leading companies against 100 criteria. The intention is to provide information which allows investors, shareholders and consumers to carry out their own due diligence and encourage a mutually reinforcing drive to improve corporate behaviour.\n\nThrough the FCO’s Magna Carta Fund we supported the organisation ‘Shift’ to create a Reporting and Accountability framework to help companies report against the responsibilities set out in the UN Guiding Principles.\n\nWe have also supported the work of the Institute of Human Rights and Business to create a multi-stakeholder coalition to promote respect for human rights in the planning and delivery of mega-sporting events. Large scale sporting events such as the Olympics, World Cup or Commonwealth Games have the potential to make a positive impact on the lives of individuals and communities but also carry the risk of human rights abuses as land is acquired and infrastructure developed. The development of a platform for human rights is intended to share and encourage best practice in this regard.\n\nWe will continue to support initiatives on business and human rights, including as an integral part of our ambition to lead global efforts to eradicate modern slavery.\n\nVoluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights\n\nThe Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPs) provide guidance on responsible business practice to oil, gas and mining companies operating in high-risk and conflict-affected areas. This guidance helps companies work responsibly with state security agencies and private security companies (PSCs). It helps them minimise the risk of their security operations leading to human rights abuses or exacerbating conflict. The guidance also helps encourage investment by reducing the operational, legal and reputational risks which companies face in connection with security, especially where their work affects the daily lives of local people.\n\nDuring 2016, the UK continued to be a strong supporter of the Voluntary Principles Initiative (VPI) which encourages companies, governments and NGOs to work together to support the implementation of the VPs. As an active member of the Steering Committee, the UK has supported the in-country implementation working groups demonstrating “value added” on the ground in Burma, Ghana, Nigeria and Peru, which support the business case for membership of the VPI and provide a forum through which we can strengthen the VPI’s verification mechanisms. We have committed to act as co-leaders of the Burma implementation working group and look forward to working with partners from government, civil society and corporate pillars to develop a work plan for this group in 2017. The development of a “toolkit” for VPI implementation in 2017 will further build the value proposition by demonstrating that membership of the initiative can provide companies with direct access to resources.\n\nIn 2016, the UK maintained support for the VPI peer review process. We have participated as peer reviewers for the US Government and AngloGold Ashanti. Through this process we have been able to share good practice and lessons learned amongst members of the government, company and NGO pillars of the VPI. We have committed to act as peer reviewers for the Government of The Netherlands and Newmont Mining early in 2017 and to undergo our own peer review during 2017. As strong supporters of the principle of transparency within the VPI, the UK continues to encourage all participants to publish their annual reports.\n\nIn 2016, the UK worked to spread knowledge and understanding of the VPs. For example, the Embassy in Luanda held a conference to develop understanding of the VPs amongst the Angolan Government, extractive companies operating in Angola and NGOs. We also funded two projects in Colombia, including a project helping the government develop a business and human rights plan for the mining and energy sectors.\n\nIn 2017, the UK will continue to work to increase understanding of the VPs, supporting projects which target implementation of security and human rights good practice on the ground.\n\nPrivate Security Companies\n\nLegitimate Private Security Companies working to high standards play a crucial role in the protection of businesses, NGOs and diplomatic missions operating in complex and dangerous environments. However, the nature of PSCs’ work makes it essential that they actively manage and mitigate any negative impact which their work has on local communities and conflicts. The UK is a signatory to the Montreux Document on private military and security companies, which defines how international law applies to the activities of private military and security companies when they are operating in an armed conflict zone.\n\nThe UK applies the principles of the Montreux Document in a number of ways. Internationally, the UK has continued to advocate the benefits of PSCs pursuing certification to a recognised standard via membership of the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Providers Association (ICoCA). As active members of the Board of ICoCA since its inception in 2013, the UK has assisted in the development of the ICoCA certification process.\n\nThrough certification, we believe PSCs can meet the challenge of effectively managing and mitigating risks involved in their operations. Certification opened on 1 November 2016 and the first company became ICoCA certified in December. We will be encouraging more companies to apply for certification in 2017. We will also support ICoCA’s work to operationalise the procedures for monitoring and complaints agreed at the Annual General Assembly in September 2016.\n\nWithin the UK, we have continued to work closely with our industry partner, the Security in Complex Environments Group (SCEG), and with civil society to ensure that stakeholders are engaged with the government’s policy on PSCs. Working with SCEG has provided a valuable forum to discuss issues in the private security industry and has given the UK Government the crucial opportunity to meet industry representatives on a regular basis. We will continue this engagement in 2017.\n\nResponsible Sourcing\n\nAs high value-added products, minerals can provide a source of funding for armed groups and, where funds are diverted from legitimate local producers, can harm local communities which should expect to benefit from a valuable economic resource. In 2016, the UK continued to address both issues through The Kimberley Process (KP) Certification Scheme for trade in rough diamonds, and by encouraging better corporate due diligence on supply chains for minerals.\n\nThe Government Diamond Office (GDO) based in the FCO and the UK Border Force is responsible for implementing the requirements of the KP and for preventing illicit diamonds from entering or leaving the UK. In 2016, the GDO continued its work with the UK’s rough diamond industry to provide expert advice and audited 13 rough diamond traders as part of its oversight of industry compliance with KP minimum standards. GDO officials also inspected eight shipments of rough diamonds entering or leaving the UK, and issued certificates for rough diamond exports worth over US$60 million.\n\nEffective due diligence by companies buying minerals which may originate from conflict-affected and high-risk areas complements the diamond-specific work of governments in the KP. In 2016, we continued to support and encourage relevant UK importers in carrying out full and transparent due diligence based on the OECD’s Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. This provides specific guidance on gold and tin, tungsten and tantalum, all of which are used in consumer electronics. We also pressed for significant progress in the negotiations between EU Member States towards agreement on the EU Regulation on the responsible sourcing of minerals, which aims to encourage EU importers of minerals to carry out due diligence on their supply chains.\n\nIn May 2016, we joined The Netherlands as a founding partner in the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM). We believe this initiative, which supports the implementation of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance in Europe, will enable us to work effectively with global partners to increase the proportion of responsibly sourced minerals across the supply chain – from mines to consumers. As a Board Member of the EPRM in 2017, the UK will play an active role in ensuring the EPRM uses its pooled fund to support projects which will increase the proportion of responsibly sourced minerals in developing countries. We will be actively engaged in outreach, with a view to increasing the number of companies and governments supporting the EPRM.\n\nThe Open Government Partnership\n\nThe Open Government Partnership (OGP) was established in 2011 to provide an international platform for domestic reformers committed to making their governments more open, accountable, and responsive to citizens. The UK was a founding member and since 2011 has helped the OGP grow from 8 to 75 participating countries. In all of these countries, government and civil society work together to develop and implement open government reforms in the form of National Action Plans (NAPs). Realising the commitments in these plans requires active cooperation between governments and citizens. This principle of supporting civic participation is fundamental to membership. All governments joining the OGP commit to protecting the ability of not-for-profit and civil society organisations to operate in ways which are consistent with the commitment to freedom of expression, association, and opinion.\n\n2016 marked the last year of the UK’s participation in the Steering Committee. During our tenure we have promoted various OGP initiatives to drive openness and transparency including the Global Open Data Charter for which the UK is a lead steward and the Declaration at the 4th OGP Summit held in Paris in December 2016, which highlighted the need to protect and defend civil society’s space to operate.\n\nThe OGP has sought greater protection for civil society organisations working in difficult circumstances. Last year, the OGP’s Steering Committee suspended Azerbaijan for its crackdown on the operation and funding of NGOs and is closely monitoring other countries where treatment of NGOs is a concern.\n\nAs well as providing core funding to the OGP, the UK has directly supported projects in over 20 countries during 2016. This work has included providing advice to countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina on the steps required to become full members of the OGP, as well as more targeted work with civil society and governments in member states including Serbia and South Africa either to develop their action plans or to achieve specific objectives.\n\nAs we come to the end of our tenure on the OGP Steering Committee in 2017, the UK remains committed to working with civil society and government to provide the leadership to protect and enhance the necessary civic space for transformative reforms.\n\n3.6 Modern Slavery\n\nThe Prime Minister has identified modern slavery as one of the greatest human rights challenges of our time. As Home Secretary, she piloted the Modern Slavery Act through Parliament in 2015. This is a landmark piece of legislation which gives law enforcement bodies greater powers to tackle crimes such as sexual exploitation, slavery, forced and child labour and people trafficking. As Prime Minister, she has set out her ambition to tackle these same crimes at the global level. In 2016, she established a Modern Slavery Implementation Task Force which she chairs, and which drives forward action both in the UK and globally.\n\nAlthough data are difficult to assemble, the Global Slavery Index, produced by the Walk Free Foundation, estimates that there are as many as 46 million people in modern slavery, in its various forms, around the world[footnote 2]. The crimes we understand as modern slavery are covered by a variety of terminology. At the international level they are set out in the universally agreed Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8.7 which calls for “immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour including the recruitment and use of child soldiers”. In addition, SDGs 5.2 and 16.2 call for an end to trafficking and exploitation, of women and of children respectively.\n\nThe Prime Minister raised modern slavery in her address to the UN General Assembly in September and held a special side-meeting of selected world leaders to discuss the issue. She set out her determination to pursue perpetrators and support victims in her comments in Westminster Abbey marking Anti-Slavery Day on 16 October. She also used these speeches to set out her determination to put Britain “at the forefront of this fight” and mobilise the rest of the international community to combat these heinous crimes.\n\nIn 2016, we supported the development of two initiatives which have the potential to make significant contributions to tackling modern slavery. “Building Responsibly” is an initiative to promote the rights and welfare of workers in the construction and engineering sectors, with a particular focus on the Gulf. As part of the development of this initiative the FCO hosted a roundtable event in May 2016 at which Karen Bradley, then Home Office Minister for Preventing Abuse, Exploitation and Crime, spoke about the UK’s Modern Slavery Act and the government’s commitment to taking action. FCO officials also spoke at the launch of the Institute of Human Rights and Business’ “Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment” which aims to radically improve the way migrant workers are recruited including through the eradication of recruitment fees.\n\nThe FCO will use its entire network of posts to urge greater global activity against modern slavery, to share the UK’s experience through the implementation of the Modern Slavery Act, and to promote areas for practical measures to prevent modern slavery and to support victims. We will give particular focus to those countries which are believed to have the highest prevalence of modern slavery and where we believe the UK is well placed to make a difference. However, acknowledging the fact that modern slavery exists in every country, including the UK, our work will be global – relying on contributions from all posts in our diplomatic network. This reflects the Prime Minister’s identification of modern slavery as a foreign policy priority.\n\nWe will also push for action at the multilateral level, building on the good work which has been done by others including the US’ Trafficking in Persons report, the Australia-Indonesian chaired “Bali Process” and the Spanish-led UN Security Council Resolution (2331) on trafficking in conflict. Our aim is to create a greater sense of urgency and broad global consensus in favour of more determined action.\n\nTackling modern slavery is an enormous challenge; but it also provides an opportunity for the international community and the UN system to show how it can come together to provide a coordinated and coherent response. We will be encouraging all relevant parts of the UN system to work together, including around the creation of Alliance 8.7, a coalition designed to accelerate and intensify action towards achieving the goal of eradicating modern slavery.\n\nModern Slavery will be a major focus of our work in 2017, both bilaterally through our network of posts and in multilateral fora.\n\n3.7 Department for International Development (DFID): Work on Economic and Social Rights\n\nRespect for human rights underpins sustainable development. The Global Goals which were agreed by world leaders at the UN General Assembly in September 2015 are at the heart of the UK Aid Strategy. The goals focus on eradicating extreme poverty and finishing the job of the Millennium Development Goals in key areas like health, nutrition and education. The goals also represent a commitment to achieve substantive, measurable improvements in global economic, social and political human rights. The overarching commitment in the Global Goals to “leave no one behind” is an expression of commitment to the protection of human rights.\n\nA range of DFID programmes that protect and promote human rights in areas such as security, peace and justice are referred to elsewhere in this report. This section describes DFID’s work in 2016 relating to economic and social rights.\n\nRights of Women and Girls\n\nIn 2016 the UK was instrumental in the UN Secretary General’s High Level Panel on Women’s Economic Empowerment, which will see millions more women into jobs and a platform for new partnerships and actions which will catalyse the transformational change needed for women’s economic empowerment. The UK hosted the Girls’ Education Forum, securing commitments to supporting more of the most marginalised girls through quality primary and secondary education. Through its Girls’ Education Challenge programme, DFID supports work to change community and social attitudes to girls’ education and is enabling one million of the world’s most marginalised girls to complete at least one full cycle of schooling.\n\nThe UK is committed to tackling all forms of violence against women and girls at home and overseas, including intimate partner violence, child, early and forced marriage (CEFM) and female genital mutilation (FGM). The UK’s flagship “What works to prevent violence” research and innovation programme is producing rigorous evidence on the most effective approaches to drive down global rates of violence against women and girls. DFID has also increased its support for local women’s rights groups through the UN Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women. Through the work of two other flagship programmes, 22 countries now have National Action Plans in place to address CEFM and/or FGM. The latest data from the UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme on Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C), of which the UK is the largest donor, suggests that over 15,000 communities representing some 17 million people declared their commitment to abandoning the practice.\n\nAt the World Humanitarian Summit in May the UK’s call to put gender equality at the heart of 21st century humanitarian action was echoed by many, with strong agreement on the need to go beyond protection to ensure the empowerment of women and girls in emergencies. DFID has also supported programmes to increase women’s political engagement such as the £9m support programme with the Westminster Foundation for Democracy 2016-21 which provides technical assistance to parliaments, political parties and local governments around the world.\n\nHealth\n\nWorldwide, millions of people continue to die from preventable diseases, especially in the poorest and most vulnerable populations. The UK is committed to building global health security to reduce the risk from future threats such as Ebola, and supporting developing countries in strengthening their health systems to enable better access to good quality and responsive healthcare. The UK continues to invest in research and product development, including through the joint DFID and Department of Health Ross Fund. In 2016, DFID-funded programmes delivered over 127 million treatments through Mass Drug Administration to help control neglected tropical diseases such as blinding trachoma, and achieve near eradication of Guinea Worm.\n\nUK support helps the Global Polio Eradication Initiative administer polio vaccines to more than 400 million children every year, and stay on track for 2017 to be the last year a case of polio is seen globally. By the end of 2015 DFID support had also helped 9.9 million additional women to use modern methods of family planning, had ensured that 5.6 million births were delivered with the help of nurses, midwives or doctors, had kept 9.2 million people alive and on treatment for HIV, had distributed 49.7 million insecticide-treated bed nets, and had immunised 67.1 million children against preventable diseases.\n\nEducation\n\nAfter a decade and a half of good progress in getting children into school across the world, out-of-school numbers started to rise in 2015. 59 million children currently have no access to education and at least 250 million children cannot read or count, even if they have spent four years in school. The UK wants children to be in school and learning. Between 2010 and 2015 DFID supported 11 million children in primary and lower secondary school, and trained 380,000 teachers to improve the quality of education. The UK’s focus is on the most disadvantaged children and through the Girls’ Education Challenge DFID is supporting one million of the world’s poorest girls to learn. DFID has again pledged to support 11 million children with a decent education by 2020.\n\nWater and sanitation\n\nAt the start of 2016, 2.4 billion people did not have access to sanitation and 663 million people did not have access to clean water. Inadequate access to water and sanitation is the principal cause of diarrhoeal disease which kills nearly 1,000 children every day. The UK recognises the right to water and sanitation as rights derived from the right to an adequate standard of living under Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Between 2011 and 2015, DFID helped 64.5 million people gain access to water and sanitation. The UK Government has committed to helping 60 million gain access to water and sanitation between 2015 and 2020. During 2015-2016, DFID helped 11.5 million gain access to these services\n\nEconomic empowerment\n\nDFID’s new Economic Development Strategy sets out a strong focus on ensuring that economic growth delivers opportunities and benefits for the poorest, women and girls, people with disabilities, and other marginalised groups. The Strategy includes a commitment to tackle gender discrimination across all DFID’s economic development work and deliver safer, more secure and high-return work for women. In addition, the UK has played a prominent role in the UN Secretary General’s High-Level Panel on Women’s Economic Empowerment, which brings together global leaders from business, civil society and government. The first report of the Panel, published in September 2016, identified seven drivers of change and issued a global call to action to address gender inequality. Latest figures show that since 2011, DFID has improved access to financial services for over 36 million women and helped three million women gain secure land rights.\n\nSocial protection\n\nSocial protection is important to help the poorest and most vulnerable meet their basic needs, have more control over their lives, and allow them to take advantage of economic opportunities. DFID supports social protection through 16 of its bilateral country programmes, as well as through countries in the Sahel and Middle East and North Africa regions.\n\n4. Chapter II: Human Rights for a Stable World\n\n4.1 Migration and Refugee Crisis\n\nOver 360,000 migrants crossed the Mediterranean in 2016, compared with more than one million who made the journey in 2015. However, the number of dead and missing increased to over 5,000, the highest annual total recorded to date. The UK continues to pursue a coordinated and comprehensive approach to the crisis, tackling the root causes of irregular migration as well as their consequences. The UK is also a major contributor to the humanitarian response to the Mediterranean migration crisis, having committed over £100m since October 2015.\n\nAt the London “Supporting Syria and the Region” Conference in February 2016, the UK pioneered a new approach to protracted crises going beyond people’s basic needs and investing in education, jobs and livelihoods for refugees and the host communities. At a Leaders’ Summit organised by President Obama in September 2016, the UK announced an additional £660 million in humanitarian funding for 2016/17, bringing the total to £1.5 billion, including £2.5 million seed funding for a new global fund to resettle refugees. The UK also committed £80 million to a jobs compact with the Government of Ethiopia, World Bank and European Investment Bank to create 100,000 new jobs for Ethiopians and refugees.\n\nBy the end of 2016, the UK had granted humanitarian protection to 5,706 vulnerable people under the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme. In 2016, we transferred over 900 unaccompanied minors to the UK from Europe, including more than 750 from France as part of the UK’s support for the Calais camp clearance.\n\nThe UK supported the EU-Turkey Statement of March 2016 which contributed to a reduction in arrivals in Greece from 1,500 per day in February to around 50 per day in December. The UK provided 115 expert staff to help the Greek authorities accelerate the processing of asylum claims. We have allocated more than £39 million in humanitarian assistance to migrants and refugees in Greece. The UK also supported Turkey, including through committing €328 million to the €3 billion Facility for Refugees in Turkey.\n\nThe UK provided a significant contribution to Operation SOPHIA, the EU’s counter-migration operation in the Central Mediterranean, which has destroyed over 330 smuggling boats, apprehended 100 suspected smugglers and saved over 29,000 lives. Through the multi-agency Organised Immigration Crime Taskforce, we also provided expertise and assistance in disrupting organised immigration crime and in reducing human smuggling and trafficking in source and transit countries.\n\nAt the UN General Assembly in September, the Prime Minister called for a more effective international response to mass movements of refugees and migrants, based on the principle of seeking refuge in the first safe country reached; a clear differentiation between refugees and economic migrants; and the rights of states to control their own borders. We will continue to promote these principles throughout 2017 in consultations on new UN Migration and Refugee Compacts.\n\n4.2 Freedom of Religion or Belief\n\nIn 2016, the UK emphasised Freedom of Religion or Belief (FoRB) as a freedom which helps to create societies that are more resilient against violent extremism. With this in mind, in October 2016 we held a groundbreaking conference, bringing together experts in FoRB with those working on countering violent extremism. Participants considered how protecting FoRB can help to combat violent extremism by building inclusive societies.\n\nAt the UN HRC, we continued to play an active role in negotiations to maintain consensus on the adoption and implementation of both the EU led ‘Freedom of Religion or Belief’ resolution and the ‘Combating Religious Intolerance’ resolution led by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\n\nWe also continued our policy of raising cases of persecution in individual countries. In September, the Foreign Secretary launched the global ‘Bringing Daesh to Justice’ campaign to support justice efforts, and to recognise and address the harm suffered by victims of Daesh crimes in Syria and Iraq.\n\nIn Burma, we were aware of incidents of violence and hate speech against Muslims and Christians, particularly the Rohingya community in Rakhine State. The UK continued to work with the new civilian government to support and encourage them in tackling this issue.\n\nIn China, we regularly raised our concerns about FoRB, both through the UK-China Human Rights Dialogue in October 2016, and as part of our broader relationship.\n\nIn Iran, the Baha’i faith in particular was subject to mounting persecution, and we were concerned by state efforts to identify, monitor and arbitrarily detain Baha’is. The UK regularly called on Iran to allow the Special Rapporteur on FoRB to have access to the country.\n\nIn Russia, we lobbied the Russian Government about the implementation of the new “Yarovaya Law” aimed at tackling religious extremism. Its vaguely defined ban on “missionary activity” means that in theory certain religious activity cannot take place outside registered religious buildings.\n\nIn Indonesia, we have made representations encouraging the Indonesian Government to respect freedom of religion or belief as guaranteed in the Indonesian Constitution, including for those who do not practice one of the six religions recognised under Indonesian law. We welcome statements by Indonesian President Joko Widodo reaffirming his commitment to pluralism and religious diversity.\n\nIn Pakistan, we raised our concerns about the misuse of the blasphemy laws and discrimination against religious minorities, in particular Ahmadiyya and Christian communities.\n\nIn Sudan, FoRB continued to be an issue which we raised through our ongoing human rights dialogue with Sudan.\n\nWe also supported various projects through our Magna Carta Fund, such as support for a network of human rights defenders in South Asia, and a project to support including FoRB in the curriculum of secondary schools in the Middle East and North Africa region. The FCO also continued to run religious literacy training to help its staff understand the key role which religion plays in shaping the views of the majority of the world’s population.\n\n4.3 Post-Holocaust Issues\n\nThe government continued to attach great significance to learning in practical terms from the lessons of the Holocaust and encouraging greater joint working from the international community. We also worked actively on outstanding issues, such as property restitution. Sir Eric Pickles, the UK Envoy for Post-Holocaust Issues, regularly discussed these matters with relevant countries as part of his mandate. Earlier in the year he joined the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation’s International Committee.\n\nIn January 2016, together with the Israeli Embassy we hosted an event to commemorate Holocaust Memorial Day which brought together a number of high profile speakers including a Holocaust survivor. The main aim of the event was to raise awareness among members of the London diplomatic community of the importance of remembering the lessons of the Holocaust.\n\nDuring 2016, we continued to play an active role in the management of the International Tracing Service archive as a member of its International Commission. We also worked to strengthen international co-operation on Holocaust education, remembrance and research, including through our membership of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA).\n\nThe UK welcomed the notable achievement by Romania, IHRA’s Chair during 2016, of securing IHRA’s adoption of a Working Definition of anti-Semitism, which sets out in detail how contemporary anti-Semitism may manifest itself. In December, the Prime Minister announced that the UK would formally adopt this definition for UK domestic use, reaffirming that there is no place for such hatred in our society, however it is portrayed.\n\nLooking ahead, we will continue to work actively to encourage greater international collaboration on these issues, in particular by supporting the efforts of IHRA experts to ensure that the in-depth analysis available on the Holocaust and its causes is taken into account by those seeking to prevent future genocides. We will also pursue progress on post-Holocaust restitution and work with international partners to advocate the full implementation of the Terezin Declaration, pressing for due recompense for those still affected by the legacy of the Holocaust.\n\n4.4 Countering Extremism\n\nThe UK attaches a high priority to countering violent extremism and the ideological basis of non-violent extremism. The government set out in its 2015 Counter Extremism strategy how it planned to protect communities and safeguard individuals from the influence of extremists. We are keen to work closely with international partners on this issue, including by identifying opportunities for sharing best practice. The UK is also part-funding the new Commonwealth Countering Violent Extremism Unit which will advance the Commonwealth’s role in the international effort to counter extremism. In 2017, a key aspect will be encouraging implementation of the UN Secretary General’s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism with Member States and across the UN system.\n\nDaesh\n\nFor obvious reasons, the government does not recognise Daesh as a state actor. However, given the atrocities Daesh committed in 2016 and the impact on people’s human rights, we consider it appropriate to include reference to those atrocities in this report, noting the distinction between human rights violations, committed by state actors, and human rights abuses, committed by non-state actors, such as Daesh.\n\nDespite significant defeats at the hands of local forces and the Global Coalition, Daesh continued to commit horrific crimes in Iraq, Syria and across the world in 2016. They were responsible for systematic and widespread abuses of human rights including kidnapping, forced marriage, rape, torture and execution.\n\nThe majority of Daesh’s victims in Iraq and Syria continued to be Sunni Muslims, with Yezidis, Shia, Christians, Mandeans and other minority groups also facing severe abuse. Women and girls were repeatedly sold as slaves, forced to become wives of Daesh fighters and killed if they refused. In March, Daesh forces reportedly killed at least nine Iraqi Shia women belonging to the Turkmen minority for refusing to marry Daesh fighters after Daesh forces killed their husbands. In June, the independent UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria published a report on Daesh’s treatment of the Yezidi community[footnote 3]. It detailed cases of killings, sexual slavery, enslavement, torture, forcible transfer, mental harm, and the infliction of conditions that bring about a slow death. It estimated that 3,200 Yezidi women remain under Daesh control.\n\nReports continued of Daesh’s use of public executions in front of large crowds, often including children. Charges in 2016 included apostasy, theft, adultery, black magic and homosexuality. Corpses were often left on public display. The Syrian Human Rights Observatory estimates that between June 2014 and March 2016 Daesh executed 2,197 civilians. Human rights organisations, including Amnesty International, also reported public floggings, lynchings and amputations as means of punishment by Daesh in Libya[footnote 4]. Reports continue to surface of Daesh using civilians as human shields. When operations began to liberate Mosul in October, Daesh began forcibly evacuating civilians, killing those who tried to flee.\n\nThe UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that Daesh installed rocket launchers and snipers on the rooftops of civilian houses. Daesh used families as human shields, placing them between Daesh fighters and Iraqi forces[footnote 5]. Several reports have been made on Daesh’s use of chemical weapons. The UN’s Joint Investigative Mechanism on chemical weapons use issued a report on 20 August which concluded that Daesh used sulphur mustard in Marea on 21 August 2015[footnote 6]. Human Rights Watch’s World Report 2017 reports that in September and October, Daesh launched at least three chemical attacks on the Iraqi town of Qayyarah, south of Mosul, causing painful burning and blistering of the skin[footnote 7].\n\nDaesh continue to pose a threat to liberated areas through the planting of hidden improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Civilians returning to their homes have been injured and killed by IEDs placed in doorways, under mattresses and in television sets. Civilians have been killed and injured by such devices in Al-Mabrouka, Hasakah; Tal Akhdar, Derb Hasan, Raqqah; and Merweh, Aleppo. Human Rights Watch reported that on 27 September, three boys were killed by an IED left in a school classroom in the Seif al-Dawla primary school in Manbij.\n\nThe UK continues to pursue a comprehensive strategy to defeat Daesh, working as a leading member of the 68 member Global Coalition. Since 2014, Daesh has lost 62% of its territory in Iraq and 30% in Syria. Their finances have been hit, their leadership is being killed and their flow of foreign fighters has dried up. Since 2015, almost 1.4 million displaced people in Iraq have been able to return to their homes. 100% of the population of Mukeshefah city has returned and the primary healthcare centre and water works have been rehabilitated. 95% of the population of Tikrit have returned home, and the university re-opened.\n\nIn September, the Foreign Secretary launched the ‘Bringing Daesh to Justice’ campaign to ensure Daesh are held accountable for the heinous crimes they have committed. The campaign has three complementary objectives: to support national and international justice efforts; to recognise and address the harm suffered by victims of Daesh crimes; and, through this pursuit of justice, the unification of communities – local, national and international. This is about justice for all Daesh victims, those who have lived under Daesh and those who have been victim to its terrorist attacks. While investigative and prosecutorial work is already underway across the world, we are cooperating with international partners to identify ways to take this agenda forward, including at the UN.\n\nCounter-Terrorism\n\nIn 2016, the international community continued to face a severe challenge in combating terrorism, with a number of high profile terrorist attacks around the world, including major incidents in Turkey, France, Germany and Belgium. These attacks highlighted the continued need for the UK to invest in capacity building to help our partners detect and respond to a wide range of terrorist threats, as well as to counteract radicalisation and extremism. Human rights compliance training underpins all of this assistance, and is an integral part of the UK approach to countering terrorism.\n\n4.5 Death Penalty and Torture Prevention\n\n2016 saw a minority of states taking backward steps on the death penalty by:\n\ncontinuing to pass death sentences and to execute;\n\ngoing back on established moratoria on the use of the death penalty;\n\nfailing to apply the safeguards and restrictions set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;\n\nadvocating the use of the death penalty, in some cases in breach of previous international commitments.\n\nHowever, a large majority of UN member states re-confirmed their commitment to abolition in a vote at the General Assembly in December.\n\nChina remains the country which carries out most executions, which are generally carried out in secret after an opaque legal process. Of the world’s recorded executions 87% took place in just four countries: Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia. FCO Ministers have condemned the fact that many executions in China and Iran are conducted in secret and that the death penalty is widely applied to offences which are not – to quote the UN standard - ‘the most serious’. Ministers have also expressed concern about particular cases: non-implementation of a moratorium continued in Somalia; the execution in Nigeria of three prisoners in December ending its unofficial moratorium; leaders in the Philippines and Turkey speaking positively about the death penalty, despite their countries’ treaty commitments to abolish it.\n\nWhile there have been setbacks in some countries, 166 of the 193 member states of the UN carried out no executions in 2016. Benin, Fiji, Guinea, Madagascar, Mongolia, Nauru, the Republic of Congo, and Suriname abolished the death penalty. There were no executions in Europe outside Belarus; nor any in the Americas outside six states of the USA. There were fewer than 100 executions in the whole of Africa, where many states have established long-term moratoria and are considering abolition. In most of the world, the death penalty is the exception, not the norm.\n\nThe FCO continued to fund projects in 2016 aimed at establishing a global culture of torture prevention. The UK’s own experience is that two steps are necessary to effectively prevent torture from occurring: a clear political will to end the practice, and the establishment of a National Preventative Mechanism (NPM). The pathway to establishing an NPM is laid out in the UN’s Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT). The UK calls on all states to ratify and implement the OPCAT. FCO project spending on torture prevention is focused on this goal. We welcome Cabo Verde’s ratification of the OPCAT on 1 April 2016.\n\nIt remains the case that the political will to end torture is lacking in many countries. Some states continue to believe – and even to suggest publically – that torture has a role to play in countering terrorism. The UK rejects such views absolutely. Torture is banned under international law and is always wrong. The UK calls on all states to investigate any complaints of torture swiftly and openly.\n\n4.6 Conflict\n\nPreventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative (PSVI) In July, the Minister for Human Rights Baroness Anelay was re-appointed by the Prime Minister as her Special Representative on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict (PMSR). Baroness Anelay continued to build on PSVI’s achievements, by encouraging further training on the International Protocol on the Documentation and Investigation of Sexual Violence in Conflict (“the International Protocol”), promoting UK military expertise on sexual violence issues and providing further support to affected communities. In 2016, she visited a number of conflict and post-conflict countries, including Colombia, Burma and Sri Lanka, to promote PSVI and encourage greater progress in its implementation.\n\nSurvivors of sexual violence in conflict are often ostracised from their communities, shunned by their families, denied justice and cut off from critical support networks. In 2016, the UK increased its work to tackle the stigma associated with sexual violence and to challenge the negative attitudes and misunderstandings that cause further suffering to survivors and children born as a result of rape.\n\nWe held a series of workshops in countries including Burma, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, DRC, Iraq, Kosovo, Nigeria, Somalia and Sri Lanka which brought together survivors, experts, local governments, civil society, media and faith groups to identify and understand some of the issues associated with and challenges to tackling stigma. These findings were subsequently discussed at a UK conference hosted by Baroness Anelay in November. The report and the conference outcomes will contribute to the development of a set of principles and recommendations that will help inform the work of other donor governments and the international community in this area.\n\nIn 2016, we provided financial support to projects to tackle stigma in Colombia, Mexico, Nepal, Nigeria, Somalia, DRC, South Sudan and Uganda. These projects have helped identify the political, social and economic consequences of the stigma which survivors of sexual violence suffer. They have also contributed to combating stigma by working with faith leaders, community members and youth groups to change attitudes, improve response systems and prevent stigmatisation.\n\nSince launching the International Protocol at the Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict in 2014, we have worked with governments, the judiciary, police and civil society in countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, DRC, Iraq, Nepal and Uganda to provide training on the International Protocol, to help them gather evidence and bring prosecutions against perpetrators of sexual violence. By boosting the capacity of States to prosecute offenders and offer justice to victims, and by encouraging human rights defenders and grass roots organisations to press for specific changes to domestic legislation, the International Protocol is making a real and practical difference to the fight against impunity and to tackling sexual violence in conflict.\n\nThe International Protocol was always intended to be a living document, to be updated as best practice evolved and in light of the feedback we received on its use. In 2016, we launched this revision process and a second version of the International Protocol will be available from March 2017. The revised version contains a number of additions, including guidance on the specific context, challenges and techniques required for interviewing and documenting conflict and atrocity-related sexual violence against children and against male victims; further guidance on trauma; and a focus on analysing evidence and establishing patterns of violations.\n\nIn April, the House of Lords Select Committee on Sexual Violence in Conflict published their report ‘Sexual Violence in Conflict: A War Crime’. The report made over 120 recommendations and observations for our work on PSVI. Our response to the report was presented to Parliament in June. We welcomed the subsequent establishment of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Sexual Violence in Conflict as an opportunity to continue our engagement and look forward to doing so throughout 2017.\n\nChildren and Armed Conflict (CAAC)\n\nChildren are often the most frequent victims of the devastating consequences of conflict, including through their unlawful recruitment and use as soldiers, suffering acts of sexual violence, killing, maiming, and abduction, the destruction of schools and hospitals which severely impacts their life chances, and the denial of humanitarian access to alleviate their suffering. The UK Government is strongly committed to supporting the rights of children caught up in conflict, and believes that children are entitled to an education and should feel safe within their communities. Failure to protect children affects a country’s ability to emerge from conflict, undermining the prospects of future generations and the potential of future leaders.\n\nThe UK has continued to play a key role on the UN Working Group on CAAC, which leads the international response to the issue of child soldiers and child protection. This has included pressing those countries listed in the UN Secretary-General’s annual report on CAAC to agree concrete action plans with the UN to verify and release any child soldiers associated with armed groups and forces, in compliance with international law.\n\nThe UK has continued to support the campaign of the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for CAAC, ‘Children, not Soldiers’, to end the recruitment and use of children by government armed forces in conflict. To assist the office of the Special Representative, the UK has also committed to increase its funding for the next four years (2016-17 to 2019-20) to support her work to implement the UN action plans, including through technical missions to monitor violations committed against children. The UK has also continued to push for the inclusion of child protection in peacekeeping responses through UN mandate renewals and resolutions.\n\nOver the past year a number of government forces and non-state armed groups listed in the UN Secretary-General’s annual report for committing violations against children have made welcome progress on this agenda. In March 2016, Sudan signed an action plan to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children by its security forces. In May 2016, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General oversaw the signing of the historic agreement between the Colombian Government and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ejército del Pueblo (FARC-EP) to begin the separation and reintegration of all children under 18 associated with the FARC-EP. The non-state group, Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), signed an action plan with the UN in November 2016 to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children in conflict.\n\nUN Peacekeeping and Human Rights\n\nUN peacekeeping missions play a vital role in supporting the transition from conflict to peace in some of the most fragile regions in the world. The destabilising effects of such conflicts, particularly the violence and displacement that they produce, often leave civilian populations vulnerable to human rights violations and abuses. Peacekeeping missions contribute to reducing that threat, and the protection of civilians is at the heart of their objectives.\n\nThe UK contributes strongly to both the policy and the delivery of peacekeeping. As a member of the UN Security Council, the UK has a key role in setting the mandates for peacekeeping missions. Working alongside our partners in the Council, we seek to ensure that all missions are mandated to protect civilians where relevant to the situation. All new UN peacekeeping missions since 1999 have included an element on the protection of civilians in their mandate, and for some it is the primary goal. The UK has also been a champion of the use of ‘phased mandates’ which prioritise the delivery of certain tasks, such as the protection of civilians, within a mission’s overall mandate.\n\nIn September, the UK hosted the UN Peacekeeping Defence Ministerial: London 2016, which brought together 74 countries and international organisations to discuss how to improve peacekeeping. The London Communiqué, signed by 63 countries, provides a blueprint for peacekeeping reform based on improvement in three areas which we call the 3Ps of peacekeeping – planning, pledges and performance. By encouraging the UN and its member states to focus on these three areas, the UK aims to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of peacekeeping missions and their ability to protect civilians.\n\nThe Defence Ministerial included a clear focus on the role of women in peacekeeping, which all participants recognised as critical to its future effectiveness. The final communiqué called on the UN Secretary-General to double the number of women in UN military and police contingents by 2020 and to prioritise the appointment of more women in senior leadership positions. More women in peacekeeping will enable more effective engagement with communities, as well as improved cultures and behaviours across the force – important for preventing incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse, and for the prospects of successful conflict resolution. We will continue to encourage the Secretary-General to meet these ambitions.\n\nThe UK has committed to doubling the number of UK troops serving in UN peacekeeping missions. The UK is delivering on this commitment through its existing deployment to the UN mission in Cyprus, and through new deployments to UN operations in Somalia and South Sudan. Both of these missions have a strong focus on the protection of civilians. The first troops are already on the ground and more will follow during 2017.\n\nPeacebuilding\n\nPeacebuilding encompasses efforts to prevent and reduce conflict and strengthen the resilience of political, socio-economic, and security institutions, in order to lay the foundation for sustainable peace and development in the longer term. The promotion of the rule of law, good governance and human rights is fundamental to sustaining peace. Peacebuilding is central to the UK’s national security objectives and integral to safeguarding and promoting the human rights of those living in such states.\n\nThe UK pursues many of its peacebuilding goals through the UN, which plays a key role in addressing and preventing conflict. The UK is encouraging a more coordinated UN approach to peacebuilding. This includes working to strengthen the UN peacebuilding architecture and the UN’s political, humanitarian, security and development tools so that they can work together more effectively.\n\nTwo of the UN tools for delivering peacebuilding activities in conflict-affected states are Special Political Missions (SPMs) and the Peacebuilding Fund (PBF). The UK takes a strategic approach to SPMs, including evaluating their mandates, leadership and resourcing. They operate in countries important to UK interests, such as Somalia, Libya, Afghanistan and Iraq. Many SPMs are mandated to monitor and protect human rights. For example, the UN Operation in Somalia (UNISOM) is helping build the Federal Government’s capacity to promote respect for human rights and women’s empowerment, advance child protection, prevent conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence, and strengthen justice institutions. In Afghanistan, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) is mandated to monitor and promote human rights and the protection of civilians in armed conflict.\n\nIn 2016, the UK co-hosted a High-Level Pledging Conference which broadened the number of donors to the PBF. At the Conference, the UK pledged to provide £32 million over four years. The PBF is currently supporting more than 120 projects in 25 countries. Its purpose is to strengthen international support for post-conflict states, filling the gaps where other funding mechanisms cannot help. For example, in Somalia it provided "
