        "text": "This is not the first time a sitting Malaysian prime minister took to the airwaves to defend himself against a predecessor. Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak did yesterday what his predecessor Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi had done in August 2006.\n\nIn both cases, they were responding to Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the truculent longest-serving prime minister who stepped down in 2003 but is still quick to speak his mind at the age of 90.\n\nNearly three years after that interview by TV3 and historic losses in the 2008 general election, Abdullah quit public office in favour of Najib. In Najib's case, he lost further in the 2013 polls and is addressing Dr Mahathir's questions raised over the past few months.\n\nThe early consensus among viewers and those who aired their views in Facebook and Twitter postings is that Najib did not quite address questions raised by Dr Mahathir or opposition lawmakers, or even among ordinary Malaysians.\n\nIn his trademark suit and seated among palm fronds, Najib replied to interviewer Hamdan Ahmir by repeating his previous answers to the questions raised at the pre-recorded interview.\n\nOn the debt-laden government strategic developer 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), Najib said the auditor-general was going through the books and those responsible for any wrongdoing would face the law.\n\nThere was no mention of his ties with businessman Low Taek Jho, who has been linked to the government company that has some RM42 billion in debts. Najib repeated that 1MDB's assets were more than its debts and said its cash pile abroad would be returned when the time was right.\n\nHe did not address why a company with that cash pile would need a government standby credit or loan to pay off the RM2 billion that was due last year but had its repayment time extended to February.\n\nNor did Najib explain the issue of his family's fortune which prompted his siblings to issue a statement that expressed concern about their father, former prime minister Tun Abdul Razak Hussein's reputation being tainted.\n\nThat family statement was released after the Prime Minister's Office attributed the prime minister's fortune and his family's lavish expenditure to inheritance.\n\nNajib also refrained from replying to the the main point of Altantuya Shaariibuu's mysterious murder in 2006: the motive and who had ordered her murder by two police commandos.\n\nHe merely reiterated his innocence, saying he had taken oaths three times that he did not know the Mongolian national.\n\nIn his recent comments and blog postings, Dr Mahathir asked a simple question – the lack of motive for Altantuya’s killing and that those who ordered her murder should be convicted and sentenced to death, not the police commandos who had executed her.\n\nInterviewer Hamdan did not touch on topics of the day, such as Putrajaya's purchase of a new government jet at a time of falling government revenues and cutbacks to the budget.\n\nInstead, he asked about the goods and services tax and amendments to such laws as the Sedition Act which Najib had once promised to repeal. None of the answers were new or illuminating.\n\nAnd therein lies the crux of the issue of Dr Mahathir's criticism of Najib, or for that matter anyone's criticism about the prime minister. There is no trust in him anymore and his answers last night are less convincing than ever.\n\nNajib had Dr Mahathir's trust when he took over from Abdullah in 2009 and kept that trust despite losing more seats in the 2013 election. It was only last year that Dr Mahathir came round to what others had been saying about Najib – that he was worse than Abdullah in running the government.\n\n1MDB, the ambitious firm, will be closed down once its assets are sold. There is no guarantee that the government will not use public funds to service any further debt. There is no guarantee that anyone who caused those losses will face the law.\n\nThe Altantuya murder remains unsolved in terms of motive. The government has yet to show prudence in tightening its belt even as it asks the same from all Malaysians. There is no guarantee that anything will change on that front.\n\nTrust, like Najib's answers yesterday, is sorely lacking. – April 10, 2015."
