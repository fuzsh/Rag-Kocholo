        "text": "What is the weather like in Costa Rica in September?\n\nSeptember is still considered part of the rainy season, which typically extends from May to November. During this month, you can expect higher rainfall and increased cloud cover in many parts of the country.\n\nSeptember is known to be one of the rainiest months in Costa Rica, so you might want to consider other months to visit Costa Rica. Rainfall can be frequent and heavy, especially in the afternoons and evenings. However, it's important to note that weather patterns can vary, and localized variations in rainfall can occur.\n\nIn terms of temperatures, September generally experiences warm and humid weather. Average temperatures can range from the mid-70s to mid-80s Fahrenheit (mid-20s to high 20s Celsius) in most regions.\n\nBoth coasts can experience significant rainfall, with the Caribbean, with destinations like Puerto Viejo and Puerto Limon, side potentially experiencing more consistent and intense rain showers. While September is a rainy month, it doesn't mean that you won't have opportunities to enjoy Costa Rica. Rain showers are often intermittent, and there can still be periods of sunshine.\n\nIs Costa Rica warm in September?\n\nAs a tropical destination located near the equator, Costa Rica generally experiences consistent temperatures throughout the year. In September, the average temperatures in most regions range from the mid-70s to low 80s°F(mid-20s to high-20s°C). However, it's important to consider that specific temperatures can vary depending on the region and elevation.\n\nCoastal areas, such as Tamarindo and Manuel Antonio, tend to be hotter and more humid during September, with average temperatures ranging from the high 80s to low 90s°F (around 30–33°C).\n\nIn the Central Valley region, where San Jose is located, the average temperatures range from the mid-70s to low 80s°F (24–28°C). In higher elevation areas, such as Monteverde and Arenal, the temperatures can be slightly cooler, with averages ranging from the mid-60s to low 70s°F (18–23°C). These areas are known for their lush cloud forests and cooler climates, providing a refreshing escape from the heat of the coastal regions.\n\nIs September a good time to visit Costa Rica?\n\nSeptember is considered the rainy season in Costa Rica, so the weather may be more unpredictable and wetter than during other times of the year. However, the rainfall can also bring lush greenery and beautiful scenery, and you may find fewer crowds and lower prices on accommodations and tours.\n\nKeep in mind that the amount of rain can vary greatly depending on where you are in the country. For example, the Caribbean coast tends to be wetter than the Pacific coast, and the northern regions tend to have more rainfall than the southern regions.\n\nFrom July to November, however, you may be able to witness hundreds of olive ridley turtles (tortugas lloras) dragging themselves out of the surf and nesting on Playa Nancite by moonlight; September and October are the months in which you are most likely to see them.\n\nWhat better way to plan a trip than to rely on personalized experiences? Our content manager has traveled to Costa Rica and shares with you what to consider when planning your trip.\n\nAverage rainfall in September\n\nCosta Rica receives a significant amount of rainfall during September, making it one of the wettest months of the year.\n\nOn average, the country receives around 300mm to 400mm (12 to 16 inches) of precipitation over the four weeks with the Caribbean coast and the northern Pacific coast receiving the most rain.\n\nThis increased rainfall contributes to the lush greenery that Costa Rica is famous for. While it may limit some outdoor activities, it also enhances the beauty of the rainforests and provides travellers with the chance to take advantage of the quieter tourist season.\n\nIt's advisable to pack rain gear and always have a back-up plan in September, should heavy downpours prevent you from doing what you had wanted.\n\nRough Guides tip: Find even more ideas for your autumn adventure with our guide to the best places to travel in September."
