In London, the chance of a wet day over the course of September is increasing, starting the month at 22% and ending it at 27%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 32% on December 29, and its lowest chance is 20% on April 27.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during September in London is gradually increasing, starting the month at 1.5 inches, when it rarely exceeds 2.8 inches or falls below 0.4 inches, and ending the month at 1.9 inches, when it rarely exceeds 3.5 inches or falls below 0.5 inches.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of September in London, the length of the day is rapidly decreasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day decreases by 1 hour, 53 minutes, implying an average daily decrease of 3 minutes, 53 seconds, and weekly decrease of 27 minutes, 14 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is September 30, with 11 hours, 39 minutes of daylight and the longest day is September 1, with 13 hours, 32 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe earliest sunrise of the month in London is 6:13 AM on September 1 and the latest sunrise is 46 minutes later at 7:00 AM on September 30.\n\nThe latest sunset is 7:45 PM on September 1 and the earliest sunset is 1 hour, 6 minutes earlier at 6:39 PM on September 30.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in London during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during September, so the entire month is in standard time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 4:42 AM and sets 16 hours, 39 minutes later, at 9:21 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:04 AM and sets 7 hours, 50 minutes later, at 3:53 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment.

Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in London is essentially constant during September, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on August 10, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in London is essentially constant during September, remaining within 0.3 miles per hour of 10.7 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on January 3, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 13.3 miles per hour, while on August 2, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 9.6 miles per hour.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in London throughout September is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 41% on September 1.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in London typically lasts for 9.8 months (297 days), from around February 22 to around December 15, rarely starting after March 26, or ending before November 13.\n\nThe month of September in London is reliably fully within the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in September in London\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in September in Londongrowing seasongrowing seasonSep1122334455667788991010111112121313141415151616171718181919202021212222232324242525262627272828292930300%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%AugOct100%Sep 16100%Sep 16NowNowcoldcoolcomfortablewarmvery cold\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in London are increasing during September, increasing by 310Â°F, from 1,732Â°F to 2,043Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in London is rapidly decreasing during September, falling by 1.6 kWh, from 4.6 kWh to 3.0 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of London are 51.509 deg latitude, -0.126 deg longitude, and 82 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of London contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 164 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 70 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (492 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (1,027 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of London is covered by artificial surfaces (96%), within 10 miles by artificial surfaces (97%), and within 50 miles by cropland (40%) and grassland (26%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in London, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in London.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and London according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at London is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between London and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nLondon Weather Centre (EGRB, 98%, 0.7 mi, southeast, 46 ft elevation change)\n\nRAF Northolt (EGWU, 2.5%, 13 mi, west, 39 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of London and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
