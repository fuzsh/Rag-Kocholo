        "text": "Grass roots left for councils to grab,\n\ninto darkness is nature plunged.\n\nBy acres of green plastic drab,\n\nof reason, we are now expunged.\n\nBut this is what the people want,\n\nof climate we are nonchalant.\n\nWarnings are for other people,\n\nyet last year floods claimed your garage.\n\nMemories lost, in discharge faecal,\n\nnot long before the next barrage.\n\nClues are in that relentless march\n\nof CET upwards, landscapes parch.\n\nOn we go, no time for nature,\n\nlet us now pave over that drive.\n\nFlat Earthers all, blind to danger\n\nof the abyss, we’re doomed to dive.\n\nFear not we’ll scrub the atmosphere.\n\nOf carbon dioxide from air near.\n\nFly away we must on breaks grand,\n\nWorry about climate later.\n\nHoliday firms need that demand,\n\nfrom the poles to the equator.\n\nBut it’s home, our backyards we need\n\nto restore nature, not concede.\n\nThe coming winter is likely to be mild and wet thanks to a predominant south-westerly Atlantic regime.\n\nThis year I have tried to improve my statistical method by using historic data from across the capital thanks to the Met Office’s ever expanding library of data; daily Kew values now date back to 1881!\n\nIn terms of rainfall and mean temperature a total of eight years were similar to this October and November, spanning 1929 to 2020.\n\nThe probabilities for the following DJF winter were thus.\n\nLooking deeper into the stats I had a look at the Oceanic Niño Index; the most similar years to this one were 1982 and 1987.\n\nA note on WeatherWeb mentions exception rainfall in the Lewes & Brighton area of Sussex, between 20th September and 31st December 1982.\n\nJanuary 1988 was the wettest in England and Wales for over 40 years, and the wettest at Hampstead since records began there in 1909.\n\nFebruary of that winter also saw a major storm affecting much of the British Isles on the 10th and 11th with much damage to buildings.\n\nThe prognosis for snow at this point seems bleak – though chances may be heightened should we experience a stratospheric sudden warming in December / January. Though, as seen in 1987 where a vortex ‘split’ was recorded, this would still not guarantee wintry weather.\n\nTaking the above years into account would give a winter where the average mean would follow this graph. Therefore, after the cold snap during the first week of December, the temperature gradually climbs through the month until the 18th when the will be a gradual drop for a possible cold snap between Christmas and New Year.\n\nThis then followed by the usual warm up in the new year with changeable weather through January. The best chance of a sustained cold snap appears to be from February 7th to 13th.\n\nIt will be 30C season soon but unlikely this month. The only occasion this happened in May in the last 60 years was 2005 on the 27th when 32.1C was reached.\n\nA low pressure system to our west was responsible for sucking up hot air from Iberia.\n\nThe incidence of 30C has increased this century. The level of 86 Fahrenheit used to be very rare in the Seventies and Eighties but as this graph below shows it has been getting more common.\n\nThe highest incidence of 30C days happened in 2018, the summer that seemed to go on and on; an extended dry spell helped contribute to a large blaze on Wanstead Flats during the day of the World Cup Final.\n\nWhat about the likelihood of 30C days this summer? The coming pattern, according to the GFS, looks like June could see heat building over Iberia. It wouldn’t take much for a suitable synoptic to see this heat harnessed for the southern UK.\n\nThe erratic onset of spring in some years often presents that problem of what to wear every morning. During the current warm spell I’ve seen all manner of attire on the school run; everything from T-shirt and shorts to full winter regalia topped off with hat and gloves.\n\nThe position of the sun is now bringing in to range the season when the gap in temperature between day and night can be at its greatest.\n\nOn Saturday (23/2), virtually unbroken sunshine and ‘thick’ air saw the temperature in Wanstead peak at 16.1C before clear conditions overnight saw the minimum plunge to just 0.2C. The gap of 15.9C represents the fourth highest diurnal temperature range for February in this area back to 1959.\n\nLooking at the year as a whole the greatest range is 20.8C with the months of May and June the most likely to see the condition.\n\nEarlier this winter there were many reports on how good snowfall had been in Austria. But on closer inspection it was clear that the weather pattern at that time only favoured certain resorts.\n\nIn contrast with last year the totals I’ve used in my cross section of the range don’t look that exciting; Bourg-St-Maurice, the jumping off point for Savoie resorts including Les Arcs and Val d’Isere, has recorded 96mm of precipitation this season, in stark contrast to the 433mm it recorded last season between Christmas Day and February 5th.\n\nIn Switzerland Arosa, a resort well placed to pick up snow from any direction, has recorded the same this season as last. Totals in Davos are well down on last season. Similarly San Bernardino has recorded about half the amount of precipitation than it did last season. Its location toward the southern side of the range has been sheltered from the prevailing winds this year. That said it did enjoy a big dump last week.\n\nGoing further south and east St Vallentin in Italy has recorded about a third what it did at this stage last season.\n\nMean temperatures overall are about 2C to 3C lower than they were last season.\n\nThe winter of 2017/18 will probably be remembered as much colder that it actually was – the exceptionally severe spell right at the end was only at its halfway point by the time the meteorological winter was over.\n\nThe mean temperature for the season finished 5C, that’s 0.5C below average and the coldest for five years.\n\nRainfall was above average: 180.8mm fell, that’s 124 per cent of average and the wettest for four years.\n\nSunshine was just over average: 174.4 hrs is 104 per cent over average and the sunniest for tree years.\n\nAs so often with winters at this latitude the average for three months makes it look a non-descript season – it is only when you look at the detail that compelling facts emerge.\n\nThe coldest day of the season occurred on the last day of February when the maximum failed to rise above -1C, the first ‘ice day’ for five years and the coldest day since 2010. It was also the seventh equal coldest February day in a local record going back to 1959.\n\nThe coldest night of the winter was in the early hours of the 28th when a low of -6.9C was recorded. The temperature would have been far lower were it not for a shower that moved in at 3am.\n\nThe warmest day of the winter occurred on December 30th with 14.2C recorded. The warmest night was on January 28th when the temperature fell to just 10.8C.\n\nThe wettest day of the winter occurred on January 2nd when 15.3mm was recorded.\n\nSnow arrived at the start of winter and at the very end: seven days of snow falling and four days of snow lying over the three months is below average.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThere were 30 air frosts during the three months, eight above the 1981-2010 average.\n\nThere were 11,680 minutes of frost over the winter, less than last year, though 66 per cent of those were recorded in February. Considering the past 6 Februaries this year’s frost hours were 170 per cent greater than the next highest, February 2016!.\n\nA full weather diary is available for the months of December, January and February.

Bourg-St-Maurice, the jumping off point for Savoie resorts including Les Arcs and Val d’Isere, has recorded over 400mm of precipitation over the past 30 days, equating to around 4m of snow at the resort summits.\n\nIn Switzerland, large amounts of snow in a short period caused chaos in Zermatt, stranding tourists after the area’s rail services suffered disruption.\n\nAway from the north and west side of the Alps, however, snowfall, while good, has been less impressive the further south and east you look.\n\nIt is a far cry from last year where some resorts on the southern side of the range were particularly dry. San Bernardino, during the last 30-days, has recorded 179mm of precipitation. During the same period last year just 14.6mm fell!\n\nThe outlook for the Alps continues to look unsettled with snow forecast to fall at resorts that are in deficit to the Valais and Savoie areas.\n\nI spent last weekend in the Lake District, on Saturday ascending both Scafell and the Pike, England’s two highest mountains.\n\nThe 964m Scafell, though lower than the Pike, is a much more technical ascent with hard to negotiate gullies, among them Lord’s Rake, where I discovered three lumps of icy snow. My findings, that I later Tweeted, attracted the attention of Iain Cameron, who, with a team of volunteers, maps and measures all British snow patches that survive through the summer.\n\nI’ve read about Iain’s findings in the Royal Meteorological Society‘s journal Weather but to find one of these surviving patches myself enabled me to empathise just why he and others find the task of mapping and measuring them fascinating, a sort of first-hand insight into how the UK’s climate varies from year to year.\n\nOn descending from Scafell I thought I’d seen further patches lower down but these turned out to be melted puddles on the moorland that were reflecting white against the bright sky.\n\nIt was a cracking weekend weatherwise. Though the wind on Sunday was fairly brisk at the top of Hellvellyn it didn’t impact much on the conditions. Two dry days in a row with excellent visibility are rare at any time of year in the Lakes. I can’t wait to return."
