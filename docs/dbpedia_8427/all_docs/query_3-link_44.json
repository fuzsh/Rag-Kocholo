        "text": "Of course the weather can be unpredictable like every other month in Iceland, so be prepared for rain and cold weather, especially in the afternoon/night. There is daylight during the day but it gets dark in the afternoon, the average sunshine is 125 hours.\n\nThe best thing about September is probably the autumn colours of the vegetation and the Northern Lights start to appear again.\n\nSeptember is also not as busy as the summer months so less crowded places.\n\nDriving in Iceland in September\n\nSeptember is usually a good month to rent a car in Iceland, even though the summer is over the roads are usually open and conditions not bad. But it is almost impossible to predict the weather in head of time so in September you need to be prepared for all kinds of weather, including heavy rain, snow, blizzards and wind.\n\nIf you are thinking about renting a car we recommend renting a 4WD car and only if you are confident driving in cold weather conditions. Remember that off-road driving is strictly forbidden and the fine for speeding can be very high.\n\nIn September most roads are accessible but some roads in the remote areas of the country might be closed as well as the mountain roads. The main roads are well maintained in September and the most popular tourist destinations around Reykjavík are accessible including the Golden Circle, the South Coast as well as Snæfellsnes peninsula in the West and the North part of Iceland. Usually it is still possible to drive the full circle around Iceland in September.\n\nIf you are not comfortable driving multiple bus tours and private tours are available during the winter in Iceland.\n\nIf you decide to drive in Iceland here you will find useful tips and more extensive information.\n\nWhat to wear\n\nIt starts to get cold again in the Fall and the average temperature in September - November is around 3°C (37°C). September is usually warmer though and the weather is not to bad.\n\nWe recommend to bring warm clothes and be prepared for everything, the weather is very unpredictable and it can rain, be sunny and windy. Layers are the key again in September as you want to be able to strip of clothes when it is warm and put them back on when it gets colder."
