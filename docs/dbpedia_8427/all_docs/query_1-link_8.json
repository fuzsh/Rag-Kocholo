        "text": "Post by CRISPR on\n\nNote that the average humidity was calculated by finding the mean of the 9 am and 3 pm humidities. Unfortunately, BOM lacks average humidity and the average (which was calculated using an online calculator, so potentially inaccurate). Also, bear in mind that the sunshine is from Sydney Airport (like 223 km away, but the closest data source I could find).\n\n2023 was a warm and wet year, with a good amount of sunshine, warmer temperatures and more rainfall than normal. Summers and winters were longer, with an abrupt autumn and a 2-month long spring. Apparently this year was a temperate monsoon climate (Köppen: Cwb) thanks to the dry May-October. Here is a month-by-month summary:\n\nJanuary: Wetter and cloudier than usual, with a relatively mild first half and a relatively hot second half.\n\nFebruary: Warmer, wetter yet sunnier than usual, thanks to a two long, dry and warm periods at the beginning and at the middle of the month.\n\nMarch: Definitely warmer and wetter than normal, due to one wet Tuesday and one hot Thursday in the middle of the month.\n\nApril: Over twice the normal rainfall and is cloudier than normal, with alot of southwesterly winds bringing some drizzle and cloud.\n\nMay: Cooler, drier and sunnier than normal, thanks to persistent westerly winds throughout the second half of the month (El Niño strengthened).\n\nJune: Very similar to May, but still warmer than normal. Almost every day was cool, sunny and dry.\n\nJuly: Almost bone-dry, warmer and sunnier than normal, with lots of northwesterly winds. You can see a pattern.\n\nAugust: Practically a carbon-copy of July with some rain from a southwesterly and some very warm, sunny days (around 25ºC)\n\nSeptember: The greatest positive temperature anomaly, due to a six-day heatwave in the middle of the month. Also very dry.\n\nOctober: Warmer, sunnier and drier than normal, with several hot days sprinkled throughout the month. Bushfire season started early.\n\nNovember: Warmer, cloudier and wetter than the average, with many days with mild temperatures and cloud. The 29th recorded 196.4 mm of rain in one day!\n\nDecember: Much warmer and wetter than normal- with several heatwave days, and a very wet week (20th to 26th).\n\nHere is the 1991-2020 'normals' for comparison- Ulladulla AWS (1991-2020)\n\nPost by Benfxmth on\n\nSince a lot of members are also posting here (and my post also covers annual stats), I'll crosspost it from the December 2023 summary...\n\nWell, guys, here comes the long-awaited...\n\nDICKCEMBER 2023 + ANNUAL SUMMARY\n\nSynopsis: Well, what was it like? Well, this December generally saw seasonable to above-average temps (albeit without the persistent record warmth like 2015 did either). This has been a bit of a contrast to the drier-than-normal fall months of 2023 though, given&nbsp;a few rainstorms (and even one thunderstorm on the evening of the 17th) here and there, partly due to the more active storm track aided by the El Nino. Overall not much happening, but that's par-for-the-course for an early winter month. Furthermore 2023 has seen all months with a monthly average high temp at or above 60°F, which is a feat that has only occurred twice before since 1948: 1990, and 2012.\n\nAverage 1 AM temperature: 46.8°F (8.2°C)\n\nAverage 7 AM temperature: 44.7°F (7.1°C)\n\nAverage 1 PM temperature: 55.9°F (13.3°C)\n\nAverage 7 PM temperature: 51.3°F (10.7°C)\n\nAverage 1 AM dewpoint: 42.5°F (5.8°C)\n\nAverage 7 AM dewpoint: 41.3°F (5.2°C)\n\nAverage 1 PM dewpoint: 44.3°F (6.8°C)\n\nAverage 7 PM dewpoint: 43.4°F (6.3°C)\n\nMax. dewpoint: 70.2°F (21.2°C) on the 2nd, 11:46 AM;

June continued its very hazy and smoky weather. But June also saw a lot of heavy rains, but whenever it didn’t rain it was smoky.\n\n* August saw no days above 30C and just as you thought summer was over, September recorded the hottest days of the year and had another long dry spell and only saw 11mm of rain.\n\n* October also had an early heat wave where it hit 30C and an almost tropical night on October 27 when it didn't drop below 18C.\n\n* December saw unseasonal warmth and an unprecedented stretch of gloomy sun-free week on the week of Christmas.\n\nPost by Cadeau on\n\nFrom December 2023 Thread.\n\nParis, Île-de-France, France\n\nParis 2023\n\nJAN = 1.1°C warmer, 113% of normal precipitation\n\nFEB = 1.5°C warmer, 5% of normal precipitation\n\nMAR = 0.8°C warmer, 156% of normal precipitation\n\nAPR = 0.7°C colder, 143% of normal precipitation\n\nMAY = 0.5°C warmer, 83% of normal precipitation\n\nJUN = 3.6°C warmer, 73% of normal precipitation\n\nJUL = 0.3°C warmer, 180% of normal precipitation\n\nAUG = on average, 108% of normal precipitation\n\nSEP = 4.2°C warmer, 89% of normal precipitation\n\nOCT = 2.4°C warmer, 162% of normal precipitation\n\nNOV = 1.1°C warmer, 173% of normal precipitation\n\nDEC = 2.2°C warmer, 97% of normal precipitation\n\nYEAR = 1.4°C warmer, 117% of normal precipitation\n\nNote: The 2nd warmest year after 2022.
