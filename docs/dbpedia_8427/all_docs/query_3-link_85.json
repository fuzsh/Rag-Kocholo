        "text": "Summer 2023 has been an interesting one to say the least… and now it’s been followed by a September heatwave.\n\nAfter a heatwave in June, we then had one of the rainiest July’s on record, followed by a pretty poor August.\n\nJust when we’d begun to give up hope on the summer, September rolled around and began delivering sunny days and temperatures in the 20Cs range, possibly reaching up to 32C.\n\nSo just why is the weather so hot this September? The Met Office has the answers.\n\nWhy is the weather so hot this September?\n\nThe Met Office has explained that the tropical cyclone season in the North Atlantic has pushed the jet stream to the north of the UK, allowing for warmer temperatures this September.\n\nMet Office Chief Meteorologist Neil Armstrong said: ‘High pressure is situated to the southeast of the UK, which is bringing more settled conditions and temperatures well above average for the time of year.\n\n‘While the highest temperatures are expected in the south, heatwave conditions are likely across much of England and Wales especially, with parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland also likely to see some unseasonably high temperatures.\n\n‘An active tropical cyclone season in the North Atlantic has helped to amplify the pattern across the North Atlantic, pushing the jet stream well to the north of the UK, allowing some very warm air to be drawn north.\n\n‘It’s a marked contrast to the much of meteorological summer, when the UK was on the northern side of the jet stream with cooler air and more unsettled weather.’\n\nTemperatures are set to reach up to 32C, with the highest temperatures set to occur on Wednesday, September 6 and Thursday, September 7.\n\nThis means that autumn could give us the hottest day of the year.\n\nJim Dale, founder of British Weather Services, told the Daily Mirror: ‘Forget the much-touted 28°C, there’s every chance later this week that the UK’s highest 2023 temp so far will be beaten.’\n\nThe highest temperatures are expected in London and parts of south and east England, with highs of 30C being recorded in parts of the south on Monday.\n\nAccording to Sky News weather producer Joanna Robinson, there will be ‘some warm nights too, especially on Wednesday, when [the] odd place may experience a tropical night – when temperatures don’t fall below 20°C.\n\nA health heat warning has been put in place this week by the UK Health Security Agency, due to the unseasonably high temperatures.\n\nThe warning is in place until 9pm on Sunday, September 10, and means the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions should take extra care.\n\nSummer 2023 has been a shock contrast to last year, when the UK reached highs of 40.3C (the hottest temperature ever recorded in the country) and wildfires devastated the nation.\n\nMORE : What is a heat dome and will the UK be affected?\n\nMORE : Meaning behind ‘Indian summer’ revealed as UK swelters in 32C September heatwave\n\nMORE : Map reveals hottest areas in UK this week as Brits swelter in 30C September heatwave\n\nFollow Metro across our social channels, on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram\n\nShare your views in the comments below"
