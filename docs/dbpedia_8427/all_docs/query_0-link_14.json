        "text": "Advertisements\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Junter\n\nYou're wrong: Bilbao has much more liveable temps tho, it hasn't got those cool rainy days which you mention and much better summers, real summers to be honest... plus many months with warm average highs, 6 to be specific. Bilbao has quite sunnier winters than London, that is a very important plus. And Bilbao is not even that rainy climate, lots of climates have +3.000mm of rain year round, lmao.\n\nBilbao gets more rain, yes. But have you seen the rainy days in both? Not a world apart. Have you seen the winter sunshine (the most important?) Bilbao gets quite more winter sunshine.\n\nLondon barely has in overall +20 sunshine hours yearly. Bilbao is not hated, idk about London. Bilbao gets a hotter sun for the latitude, much warmer temps in winter and pretty warmer in summer...\n\nBilbao has a way better climate than London: it's much warmer in the winter, it's much warmer in the summer, has a real warm season, nice autumn... and hasn't got cool summer days lol.\n\nBilbao has a pretty nice climate. It has too much rain, yes, probably, but still has nice liveable temps. Not my cup of tea, like I said for me it's a C climate, but i'm sure that many people would like it a lot.\n\nyoure twisting things again Junter -\n\nBilbao is CLOUDIER than London PERIOD (BUT WE WILL IGNORE THAT LITTLE INCONVENIENCE lmao )\n\nBilbao is WETTER than LONDON - Period (But let us ignore that one too lol )\n\nBilbao gets less snow than London (But lets ignore that one for now )\n\nand so on and so on lol - Bilbao has a worse climate than London (according to what people don't like - apparantly ) ,but it doesn't really because no one wants to accept the same faults that makes Londons climate terrible psml\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Razza94\n\nLondon actually has something approaching a real winter. Bibao has better summers, albeit wetter, but I think that London is the more balanced climate overall.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbao#Climate\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London#Climate\n\nHave you seen bro that both have practically the same rainy days in summer? Bilbao gets more rain in mm tho, because Bilbao gets more powerful rainfall. But normally in the summer, it can rain (and heavy rain) for some hours and then the rest of the day is sunny and cloudy or cloudy without rain. That's the good thing. In Rotterdam for example most rainy summer days have light sh*tty rain during most of the daylight.\n\nTorshavn: London has 110 rainy days year round, Bilbao 124 days. It's not a massive difference tho... Although yes, London is sunnier in the winter, the same difference than the winters, when Bilbao is sunnier (if you see, they have almost akin difference in sunshine hours, both winters and summers differ about 20h in both places in overall).\n\nThe thing is that Bilbao has shorter daylight too in summer, as it's placed 10ºN further south, although has larger daylight in winter too.\n\nThe thing are the temperatures: February is as warm in Bilbao as April in London. Bilbao has practically 6 months with avg highs above 21ºC (well, May is 20.8ºC exactly, i'm considering May too). London? 3\n\nSeptember has an avg high of 24.6ºC in Bilbao. 19.9ºC in London... I guess that you will understand now, why Aberdeen got 24 votes and Bilbao 13. lol, the difference got way bigger this last night!\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by TorshavnSunHolidays\n\nyoure twisting things again Junter -\n\nBilbao is CLOUDIER than London PERIOD (BUT WE WILL IGNORE THAT LITTLE INCONVENIENCE lmao )\n\nBilbao is WETTER than LONDON - Period (But let us ignore that one too lol )\n\nBilbao gets less snow than London (But lets ignore that one for now )\n\nand so on and so on lol - Bilbao has a worse climate than London (according to what people don't like - apparantly ) ,but it doesn't really because no one wants to accept the same faults that makes Londons climate terrible psml\n\nnope... WRONG\n\nBilbao is WAY WARMER than London - PERIOD\n\nBilbao has REAL SUMMERS - PERIOD\n\nBilbao has much warmer winters - PERIOD\n\nBilbao has sunnier winters - PERIOD\n\nBilbao has more thunderstorms - PERIOD\n\nboth have practically the same yearly sun amount. Oh! London wins by 20h! OMG this surely can fulfill the difference of having 3 months with high avgs +21ºC while Bilbao has 6, or that September in London has 19.9ºC and Bilbao has 24.6ºC, PMSL! Bilbao has 124 rainy days. London 110. Although Bilbao has much more rainfall amount...\n\nBoth have very similar rainy days (and summers have the same rainy days in both). So both are crap in this sense. Besides, Bilbao wins by a loooong shot for the much better temps.\n\nOh mate. Look at the poll! Just look at September or October in both climates to finish this... 24.6/21.4ºC Bilbao. 19.9/15.5ºC London. hahahaha! I prefer more rain but having real nice temps. LOL, even November has an average high of 16.6ºC in Bilbao, while in London has 11.1ºC. Even January (the coldest month in Bilbao) has an avg high of 13.4ºC and more sunshine. This is the real deal.\n\nJunter - where are you coming from lol ?\n\nyou are talking about temperatures which are a fraction above in summer but with so much cloud around it wouldn't be that noticable surely ?\n\nin winter milder yes, but that is a very ,very bad thing ,correct ? we all want continnetal cold , proper ,snowy winters -not mild ,gloomy, 12c drizzlefests - they are the worlds worst climates - but Bilbao has even more milder crappier gloomfest than LONDON lmao\n\nhow does that add up ???"
