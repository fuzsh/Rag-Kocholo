        "text": "Is this an Indian Summer?\n\nNot yet.\n\nThe Met office defines an Indian summer as a \"warm calm spell in the Autumn especially in October and November\" and we're still in September.\n\nIs it a particularly hot September? Disappointingly, temperatures in the late 20s are not remarkable in September. So far this September (1 to 28) the UK mean temperature for day and night is 13.3C. The long term average mean temperature for the UK (from 1971-2000) is 12.3C. The hottest on record was in 2006, when it was 15.2C. The mean temperatures for September between 1990 and 2010, are below.\n\nBut the Met office also says:\n\nThe last time we had temperatures exceeding 28C in mid to late September was 21 September 2006 - reaching 27 to 28C very widely across central and eastern England and the London area. The highest max on 21st September was 29.0C at Sutton Bonington (Nottinghamshire).\n\nThe forecast for today in London is 28C for today and tomorrow and 29C for Saturday. That's as hot as the Met Office's highest temperature for 29C and it's a week later in the month. It certainly feels remarkable. I've asked the Met to get the stats on the hottest temperature in the UK on September 30 going back as far as they can. Perhaps we'll find some kind of record in that. I will report back when they come up with the stats.\n\nIn the meantime, this is the view of sunny London from the Guardian offices.\n\nMy colleagues on the newsdesk are collecting people's late summer snaps - see here.\n\nAnd here are some other hot September facts from the Met Office:\n\n• The highest temperature on record in the UK in September is 35.6C at Bawtry (South Yorkshire) on 2nd September 1906.\n\nOn a country basis the highest temperatures recorded in September are:\n\n• Wales: 31.1 °C on 1 September 1961 at Gogerddan (Ceredigion)\n\n• Scotland: 28.0 °C on 2 September 1991 at Creebridge (Wigtownshire) and 21 September 1998 at Ballater (Aberdeenshire)\n\n• Northern Ireland: 26.7 °C on 11 September 1959 at Armagh (County Armagh)\n\n• Most recently, Kew Gardens reached 30.5C on 11th September 2006.\n\n• The highest temperature on record in the UK in October is 29.4C at March (Cambridgeshire) on 1st October 1985.\n\nAs an aside, I was interested in the term Indian Summer. But apparently nobody really knows where it originated from but the Met office have blogged about it here. They say the earliest record of the use of the term is in America at the end of the 18th century. William R Deedler also refers to a reference by a French man, John de Crevecoeur, in 1778:\n\nSometimes the rain is followed by an interval of calm and warmth which is called the Indian Summer; its characteristics are a tranquil atmosphere and general smokiness. Up to this epoch the approaches of winter are doubtful; it arrives about the middle of November, although snows and brief freezes often occur long before that date.\n\nTomorrow will be the hottest 30 September in 20 years, which is how far published records currently go back.\n\nThe Met Office has just sent me the following table containing the hottest temperature recorded anywhere in the UK on 30 September going back 20 years. The previous record was 24.5C in Ibsley, Hampshire in 1997. Tomorrow's forecast is for 28C.\n\nSo while this month overall may not be remarkably hot, and by definition we're not in an Indian summer yet, the last day of September will be the hottest in two decades. Enjoy."
