        "text": "There is a lot of difference between 10° C and 20° C.\n\nLet's take as a starting point Stockholm in Sweden: average temperature 7.6° C, average low 4.5° C (from −3.9° C in February to 14.5° C in July), average high 10.7° C (from 0.5° C in January to 23° C in July); it rains all year round, with a total of 531 mm/year. (One wouldn't think of it as such, but Stockholm receives less total precipitation than Rome and even Bucharest.)\n\n10° C warmer\n\nConsider Naples in Italy: average temperature 15.9° C (8.3° C warmer), average low 11.0° C (from 4.4° C in January to 19.1° C in August), average high 20.8° C (from 13° C in January to a whopping 30.3° C in August); it rains from September to April, with a total of about 1,000 mm/year (twice as much as in Stockholm, but the summers are drier). While the spontaneous flora is quite different it is not entirely different, and Italians can grow all the plants Swedes can grow, plus some which won't grow in Sweden.\n\nOverall, a 10° C warming going from the climate of Scandinavia to the climate of Italy would be survivable, and, as a bonus, people will have the opportunity to grow grapes and olives and oranges.\n\n20° C warmer\n\nConsider Jakarta in Indonesia: average temperature 26.7° C (19° C higher), average low 23.3° C (year round), average high 30.1° C (year round); it rains all year round, with a total of 1,816 mm/year (3 times the amount of rain which falls in Stockholm). There is very little in common between the spontaneous or cultivated plants of Scandinavia and Indonesia. Some of the plants which grow in Sweden can also be grown in Indonesia, but many cannot cope with the excessive humidity.\n\nA quick warming of 20° C would need very careful management for the country to cope; without careful and active management the country will descend into chaos before reorganizing itself. Most of the plants won't be able to survive; if there is enough rain, new plants will take their place. Many crops won't make the transition; new crops must be substituted, again if there is enough rain.\n\nWarmer places need more water\n\nAs we have seen, Stockholm gets only 531 mm if rain per year, whereas Naples gets about twice that; and yet, Naples does not look wetter than Stockholm, quite the contrary. Algiers on the northern coast of Africa gets just a little more rain per year than Stockholm, but it definitely looks parched compared to the capital of Sweden. That's because warmer climate induces more evaporation, including plant transpiration. Increasing the temperature with an average 10° C while keeping the same amount of rain would transform Sweden into northern Africa, a region where agriculture is possible but quite difficult and anyway very different. Increasing the temperature 20° C while keeping the same amount of rain would transform Sweden into an outright desert.\n\nWith a temperature increase of 20C, your whole weather system will, in exact scientific parlance \"Go Nuts\"\n\nExpect tropical storms to be about 5 times more frequent, and about 30 times as intense as before. No, that is not a typo. Thirty. three-zero times.\n\nPlantlife.. Assuming it gets sufficient moisture, most plantlife will survive adequately in the short term. Thrive, even. Expect seeding patterns to be utterly disrupted. After a while, expect fungal and bacterial infections to also \"Go Nuts\".\n\nInsect life will suffer horribly, but some species will thrive.\n\nHigher animals will die in droves. Especially mammals and birds simply could not survive such a massive change in such a short time.\n\nConsider a simple example, close to yourself. Adding 20C will make NewYork hotter than Dubai is, currently\n\nBut the situation will be temporary. If the plantlife does not get sufficient moisture, OR if the plantlife dies out due to thermal shock OR if the plantlife flourishes, then chokes itself.. Creates continent-wide bonfires just waiting to be ignited. Expect some serious smog for the next few decades.\n\nAnd all those are the short-term consequences.\n\nAdding 20C to the whole planet, then burning all surface plants life, will release a ludicrous amount of CO2 into the atmosphere. Heating the ocean by a similar amount will reduce its capacity to carry CO2, causing about a third of the dissolved CO2 to enter the air. This double blow will leave you with a climate bouncing like a yo-yo, but trending to stabilize eventually with a temp increase of 50-80C. Byebye all life, even microscopic life."
