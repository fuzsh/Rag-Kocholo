        "text": "Variable weather will mean several ups and downs in the temperature throughout the period, with warmer spells interspersed with more near-seasonal temperatures.\n\nOverall, however, there will be a trend towards slightly above-average temperatures, although the rather changeable conditions are likely to persist at least during the next week.\n\nUps and downs in the temperature\n\nChangeable and breezy conditions will continue over the weekend especially in northern and north-western parts. Southern areas may stay mostly dry with some spells of sunshine. Temperatures should drop to near the seasonal average but could remain higher in south-east England and East Anglia.\n\nFor next week the weather models suggest that areas of low pressure will continue to dominate over north-west Europe. However, on Monday and perhaps also on Thursday and Friday, high pressure could build in temporarily, at least in the far south and south-east.\n\nIn general changeable weather with occasionally wet and quite windy conditions and limited dry interludes are more likely throughout much of next week. The chances of slightly drier conditions in the south and south-east are greater. Any temporary high-pressure influence should increase the likelihood of warmer spells moving in from the south, but overall temperatures should be only slightly above the August average.\n\nParticular attention should be paid to next Thursday and Friday, when a deep low pressure with its fronts is expected to affect large parts of the United Kingdom. Bands of heavy rain, and later heavy showers or even thunderstorms accompanied by the risk of gales are possible, especially in the north-west. In addition temperatures could temporarily rise considerably especially across the southern half of the UK.\n\nMore settled, especially in the south\n\nIn the last week of August and into early September there is growing confidence from the global weather models that some high pressure influence could establish itself. This would bring the chance of at least slightly warmer, slightly drier and calmer conditions, although the duration and extent are still quite uncertain. However, the drier, calmer conditions are more likely further south. Further to the north, over Scotland and Northern Ireland, we are more likely to see near-average rainfall amounts and it could get a little windier in Scotland at times.\n\nThe increasing influence of former tropical cyclones or low pressure systems of tropical or subtropical origin in late August could at least increase the likelihood of higher temperatures overall."
