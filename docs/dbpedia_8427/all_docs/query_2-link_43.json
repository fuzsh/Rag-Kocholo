Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed all year round.\n\nLondon has a long history of meteorological observations, with precipitation records beginning as early as January 1697 at Kew Gardens.[2] Irregular observations were made at multiple locations in the ensuing years. An observing station has been located at Greenwich since 1841, giving London its longest continuous reliable temperature series.[3] Other stations include Heathrow, beginning in 1948,[4] Hampstead, beginning in 1910,[5] Northolt, beginning in 1948,[6] and St James's Park, beginning in 1910.[7]\n\nThe highest temperature ever observed in London is 40.2 °C (104.4 °F) provisionally[8] recorded at both Heathrow Airport and St James's Park on 19 July 2022 and the lowest is −16.1 °C (3.0 °F) 1 January 1962.[9] The lowest daily maximum temperature is −8.3 °C (17.1 °F) occurring on 3 occasions: 8 January 1841, 4 January 1867 and 12 January 1987.[10] The highest daily minimum temperature recorded is 25.8 °C (78.4 °F), recorded in Kenley on 19 July 2022.[11] In addition to this, London holds multiple national records, including the record maximum for the months of February, April, May and June.[12]\n\nThe city can sometimes experience extremes. Snowfall is an infrequent occurrence in winter, falling on an average of 16 days per year, though infrequently heavy.[13] Thunderstorms are a similarly occurring feature, occurring on average up to 16 days per year.[14] London rarely experiences tornadoes, although an F2 struck Kensal Green on 7 December 2006. Severe weather and extremes in temperature are uncommon.\n\nLondon is vulnerable to climate change in the United Kingdom, and there is increasing concern among hydrological experts that London households may run out of water before 2050.[15]\n\nClassifications\n\n[edit]\n\nLondon Climate according to major climate systems Climatic scheme Initials Description Köppen system[16][17] Cfb Oceanic climate[a] Trewartha system[18][19] Do Temperate oceanic climate Alisov system[20] — Temperate climate[b] Strahler system[21] — Marine west-coast Thornthwaite system[22]\n\nC2 B'1\n\nMoist subhumid and mesothermal Neef system[23][24] — West side/maritime climate\n\nClimate data tables\n\n[edit]\n\nLondon Weather Centre\n\n[edit]\n\nSt James's Park - Weather Station near the centre of London\n\n[edit]\n\nHeathrow - Airport Weather Station in the suburbs of West London\n\n[edit]\n\nKew Gardens - Weather Station in South West London on the banks of the River Thames\n\n[edit]\n\nHampstead - Weather Station in North London\n\n[edit]\n\nThe weather station enclosure is the most elevated of any in the London area, and as a result daytime temperatures are typically one degree lower than Heathrow, Kew, Northolt and Greenwich.\n\nNortholt - Airfield Weather Station in the North West of London\n\n[edit]\n\nTemperature extremes range from 37.7 °C (99.9 °F) in August 2003, down to −16.1 °C (3.0 °F) in January 1962.\n\nGreenwich - Weather Station in South East London near the river Thames\n\n[edit]\n\nAverage UV index\n\n[edit]\n\nUltraviolet index[47] Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year 1 1 2 4 5 6 6 5 4 2 1 0 3.4\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nRiver Thames frost fairs\n\nClimate of the United Kingdom\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
