        "text": "The best times to visit London for ideal weather are\n\nMay 21st to September 30th\n\nbased on average temperature and humidity from NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). Read below for more weather and travel details.\n\nOther London Travel Info\n\nWeather in London\n\nTemperature\n\nAverage temperatures in London vary drastically. Considering humidity, temperatures feel cold for about half of the year and otherwise nice with a chance of rain or snow throughout most of the year. The area is less temperate than some — in the 28th percentile for pleasant weather — compared to tourist destinations worldwide. Weeks with ideal weather are listed above. If you’re looking for the very warmest time to visit London, the hottest months are July, August, and then June. See average monthly temperatures below. The warmest time of year is generally mid July where highs are regularly around 81.4°F (27.4°C) with temperatures rarely dropping below 62.5°F (16.9°C) at night.\n\n“Feels-Like” Temperatures\n\nThe way we experience weather isn’t all about temperature. Higher temperatures affect us much more at higher humidity, and colder temperatures feel piercing with high winds. Our perceived temperatures factor in humidity and wind chill to better represent how hot or cold the day feels to a person.\n\nAverage London Temperatures by Month\n\nDaily highs (averaged for the month) usually give the best indication of the weather. A significantly lower mean and low generally just means it gets colder at night.\n\nPrecipitation (Rain or Snow)\n\nIf dry weather is what you’re after, the months with the lowest chance of significant precipitation in London are August, March, and then July. Note that we define “significant precipitation” as .1 inches or more in this section. The lowest chance of rain or snow occurs around mid August. For example, on the week of August 13th there is 1 day of precipitation on average. By contrast, it’s most likely to rain or snow in early October with an average of 3 days of significant precipitation the week of October 1st.\n\nWhen can you find snow in London? Weather stations report large amounts of snow likely to be deepest around February, especially close to early February. The best time to ski (if at all) in London is often around around December 17th when fresh powder is deepest. Please note that a value of 0 for snow in the graph below may either mean there was no snow, or that snow is unreported.\n\nAverage Rain and Snow by Month\n\nHumidity and Wind\n\nLondon has some very humid months, with other comfortably humid months. The least humid month is April (56.4% relative humidity), and the most humid month is December (73.9%).\n\nWind in London is usually moderate. The windiest month is April, followed by December and January. April’s average wind speed of around 9.3 knots (10.7 MPH or 17.2 KPH) is considered “a gentle breeze.” Maximum sustained winds (the highest speed for the day lasting more than a few moments) are at their highest in early to mid April where average top sustained speeds reach 17.2 knots, which is considered a fresh breeze.\n\nAverage Wind Speeds\n\nIs it Safe to Travel to London?\n\n#N/A\n\nThe Busiest and Least Crowded Months\n\nThe busiest month for tourism in London, ON, Canada is July, followed by May and June. Prices for hotels and flights will be most expensive during these months, though you can save if you purchase well in advance. Tourists are unlikely to visit London in December. Those willing to visit at these times will likely find it the least expensive month.\n\nEstimated Tourism by Month\n\nOverall London Travel Experience by Season\n\nSpring (March through May)\n\nHumidity and temperatures combine to make this season feel moderately cold. Highs range from 74.5°F (23.6°C) and 30.1°F (-1.1°C) with far warmer temperatures in the later months. Rain is somewhat common with 6 to 7 days of significant precipitation per month. Spring is the second busiest for tourism, which makes it a good time for those looking for things to do.\n\nSummer (June through August)\n\nThe middle-year months have very comfortable weather with high temperatures that are comfortable. These months see the least precipitation with 5 to 8 days of precipitation per month. June – August is the busiest season for tourism in London, so lodging and other accommodations may cost more than usual.\n\nFall (September through November)\n\nFall daily highs range from 76.8°F (24.9°C) and 40.1°F (4.5°C), which will feel chilly given the humidity and wind. It rains or snows a significant amount: 6 to 8 days per month. Tourism is the slowest during these months due to the weather, so hotels may be affordably priced.\n\nWinter (December through February)\n\nWeather is far too cold this time of year in London to be enjoyable for warm weather travelers. The average high during this season is between 36.4°F (2.4°C) and 25.2°F (-3.8°C). On average, it rains or snows a fair amount: 6 to 7 times per month. These times of year are fairly slow with tourists.\n\nBest Times to Travel› Canada › London, ON, Canada"
