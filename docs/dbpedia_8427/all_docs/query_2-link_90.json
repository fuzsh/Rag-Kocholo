Spectacular rainbows!\n\nBright Evenings\n\nIreland is surprisingly far north - we're on the same latitude as Newfoundland in Canada!\n\nThis means that bright evenings stretch until 7:30-8:30pm - ideal conditions to catch a stunning sunset as you stretch your legs after dinner!\n\nWarm Seas\n\nOcean temperature usually peak in Ireland around late August or early September.\n\nIf you're the wet and wild type, September could be the perfect month for you to take an tour filled with watersport opportunities, such as our 7 Day Magnetic North Adventure.\n\nA dip in Ireland's seas is a sure way to invigorate the mind and body!\n\nüß≥ What to Pack For September in Ireland\n\nThe word we like to describe Ireland's weather is 'changeable'.\n\nPeriods of rainfall and sun are driven by prevailing southwesterly breezes.\n\nThat can mean blue skies turning to cloud and then back to sunshine; often all in the space of an hour or less.\n\nSo, come prepared with a good quality rain jacket and the following packing list. You'll be ready for anything.\n\nPacking List For September in Ireland\n\n2 Pairs of lightweight long synthetic pants such as nylon & polyester They dry quick and are way more breathable than cotton.\n\n2-3 T-Shirts Once again, synthetic is best.\n\n1 2 long sleeved shirts Good for those cooler days or to protect against the suns rays.\n\n1 Pair of shorts For when the sun does come out.\n\n1 medium weight long sleeved layer such as a fleece or pull over.\n\n1 lightweight good quality rain jacket, Gore-Tex or PVC coated nylon.\n\n1 Wide brimmed hat and sunglasses.\n\nBug spray Particularly in the late summer months.\n\n1 swimsuit For a refreshing dip in the ocean, or if youre taking part in one of our watersports activities.\n\n1-2 changes of comfortable clothes For when you reach your accommodation and want to go exploring, or simply enjoy a pint. No need for anything too formal in the evenings. The dress code is pretty casual.\n\nOh and dont forget your pyjamas!\n\nAs we say here in Ireland, there's no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes!\n\nEnjoy our helpful blog on What to Pack for Ireland\n\nüòã What To Eat In Ireland In September\n\nSeptember in Ireland is harvest time.\n\nOrchards brim with apples and pears. Try a traditional fruit crumble if you see it on a menu.\n\nGardens and greenhouses are bursting with vegetables in Ireland in September. Look out for tomatoes, herbs, freshly-dug potatoes and zucchini ‚Äî we call them courgettes! ‚Äî when you visit farmers markets and stores on tour.\n\nSeptember is also the best time for wild food foraging.\n\nRoadside hedgerows are full of wild edible fare - if you know where to look!\n\nTry blackberries, hazelnuts, edible greens, and mushrooms*. They're abundant in September and so, so good for you.\n\n*Always remember to consult an expert before eating anything wild, especially mushrooms.\n\nüíÉ What's On In Ireland In September?\n\nWe love a good festival in Ireland.
