        "text": "Super Bowl champion tackle Michael Oher publicly discussed his court case against the Tuohy family for the first time in an interview with The New York Times for an article published Sunday. Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy had a conservatorship over Oher from high school throughout his eight-year NFL career. In 2009, the same year Oher was drafted to the Baltimore Ravens, Warner Bros. released “The Blind Side,” a movie depicting the relationship between Oher and the Tuohy family. Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw starred in the film as Leigh Anne and Sean, respectively, grossing just under $310 million at the box office. “It’s hard to describe my reaction,” Oher said, recalling his first time watching the film when speaking with The New York Times. “It seemed kind of funny to me, to tell you the truth, like it was a comedy about someone else. It didn’t register. But as social media was just starting to grow, and I started seeing stuff that I’m dumb. Every article mentioned ‘The Blind Side,’ like it was part of my name. “If my kids can’t do something in class, will their teacher think, ‘Their dad is dumb — is that why they’re not getting it?'” The film was based on Michael Lewis’ 2006 book on Oher and the Tuohy family. Prior to the release of the movie, Oher felt Lewis’ book also made him seem uneducated, which Oher felt affected his draft status. Oher was selected with the No. 23 pick in the 2009 NFL Draft. “The NFL people were wondering if I could read a playbook,” Oher said. Oher eventually went on to have a successful career in the NFL and won Super Bowl XLVII in 2013 when the Ravens defeated the San Francisco 49ers. In Oher’s lawsuit against the Tuohys, his lawyers allege the Tuohys exploited him by using his name, image and likeness to promote speaking engagements that paid them roughly $8 million over the last 20 years — and by repeatedly saying they adopted him. In August 2023, Oher issued a 14-page petition alleging the Tuohys lied about adopting him when they presented him with paperwork to make them his conservators months after he turned 18. The petition also alleges the Tuohys negotiated a deal with Twentieth Century Fox that secured them and their two birth children $225,000 each, plus 2.5 percent of “defined net proceeds” from “The Blind Side.” The petition said a separate contract purportedly signed by Oher in 2007 “appears to give away to Fox, without any payment whatsoever” the life rights to his story. Oher says he has no memory of signing such a document, according to the filing. A Tennessee judge ended the unusual conservatorship last year, but did not dismiss the financial part of the case. In filings, the Tuohys have said they paid Oher the same share of “The Blind Side” film profits — about $138,000 — that each of them, as well as their two children, received. The lawyers of the Tuohy family state they have a right to tell the story of their family, which includes Oher. Oher’s lawyers say without him, the Tuohy family wouldn’t have a profitable story to tell. The Tuohys have filed for a partial summary judgement scheduled for Oct. 1. The case likely won’t reach trial until 2025, if it does at all.

The Raiders signed Minshew this offseason to compete for the job with Aidan O’Connell, who started 10 games last year as a rookie. Pierce said earlier last week that the Raiders would make a decision after their preseason game against the Dallas Cowboys on Saturday and, after meeting with general manager Tom Telesco and offensive coordinator Luke Getsy, he tabbed Minshew as the winner of the position battle. “A lot of things went into it. It wasn’t based off of last night,” Pierce said Sunday. “We feel like Gardner gives us the best opportunity to get off to a fast start, and that’s who we’re going with. We support him. Our team’s behind it. Our staff’s behind. Our organization’s behind it.” GO DEEPERMinshew Mania hits Vegas: Can the NFL journeyman be the Raiders' answer at QB? Minshew started against the Cowboys and did not fare well. He played five drives and completed just 10 of 21 passes for 95 yards. O’Connell looked better than Minshew in four drives of action. He completed 14 of 20 passes for 96 yards and one touchdown, but he ended on a sour note as he threw a pick six on his final pass of the game. O’Connell said of the interception that he “stared it down.” “It sucks. That one will linger.” Pierce said Minshew had the upper hand when it came to experience, running the offense properly and his ability to process information. For him to hold onto the job, though, he’ll have to make significant strides. He has struggled to find consistency going back to OTAs, and that showed up against the Cowboys on Saturday. Far too many of his throws were either poorly timed or completely off target, which led to several missed opportunities for the offense to extend drives or put up points. If that continues into the season, O’Connell could have an opportunity to take the starting job back. “There’s a lot of stuff we can get better at,” Pierce said. “I don’t think anything here is a finished product. But, based off of where we want to go in the first quarter of the season, we feel like Gardner gives us the best opportunity.” Pierce said O’Connell handled the news that he lost the quarterback competition well. He also left the door open for both quarterbacks to end up playing at some point this fall. “Those two gentlemen are professionals,” Pierce said. “The way they’ve handled this competition has really resonated throughout our building, especially our staff and our team. They’ve cheered each other on. They’ve been good teammates. They’ve brought out the best version of each other in practices and in the games. They both took it on the chin like a champ. “I told them to just both be ready,” Pierce continued. “In the National Football League, you never know. But Aidan is a younger player that has tremendous upside. I think he’ll still be a starter at some point in this league, whether it’s this year or next year. He will play in games. Gardner’s done a good job of being that older presence. … He’s been through some adversity, so that’s been good for Aidan.” GO DEEPERReed: Aidan O'Connell should be the Raiders' starter, but the outlook at QB is concerning Ultimately, the Raiders believe Minshew gives them the best chance to succeed early in the season. “His personality is infectious, his energy is infectious and his leadership is infectious,” Pierce said. “Footwork in the pocket. Staying on script. There is some magic about him when he does break the pocket and does his thing, but there’s a lot of times where the first or second read is there and we’ve got to let it rip. He understands that. And, more importantly, (he has to focus on) taking care of the football.” Raiders safety Marcus Epps, who played with Minshew for two seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles, shared that sentiment. “He is just a gamer,” Epps said. “(He’s a) very smart player who cares a lot and works really hard, and he is going to give you everything he’s got every play. Definitely a guy you want in your corner.” Required reading Raiders training camp: Maxx Crosby gets into skirmish, Davante Adams misses practice Aidan O’Connell, Gardner Minshew play well in Raiders’ preseason loss to Vikings Davante Adams, Raiders offense shows progress in open practice at Allegiant Stadium (Photo: Chris Unger / Getty Images)\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. — Dave Canales put his commitment to the running game on display at the end of Saturday’s exhibition against the New York Jets, when fifth-team running back Dillon Johnson ran the ball on every play of the Carolina Panthers’ final, seven-play drive. On his seventh rush, Johnson banged his way into the end zone for a 2-yard touchdown as time expired in the Jets’ 15-12 victory. It was the Panthers’ first touchdown of the preseason — and first overall since the fourth quarter of a Christmas Eve loss to Green Bay last year. But the most important run of the night came at halftime, when running back Chuba Hubbard jogged across the field at Bank of America Stadium toward the locker room with no sign of a limp or any other issue. When last we saw Hubbard, he was grabbing his knee after an awkward slip that preceded a big hit by Jets safety Chuck Clark during the teams’ joint practice.

And that was easily the biggest development on a night when Canales again held out quarterback Bryce Young and the rest of his starters. “Obviously, had a little scare,” Hubbard said. “But feel great, feel fine.” Canales said Hubbard is expected to participate when the Panthers return to the practice fields Tuesday. In fact, Hubbard said he could have finished out the session against the Jets if the training staff had let him. The former Oklahoma State standout has played 49 of a possible 51 games since the Panthers drafted him in the fourth round in 2021. But after he went down Thursday on a play that drew a flag on Clark, a number of Hubbard’s offensive teammates came to his defense — and nearly came to blows with the Jets. “Just kind of planted weird, got hit, bent my knee back a little awkwardly,” he said. “But other than that, it really wasn’t anything too crazy.” Hubbard had no hard feelings for Clark, who dapped him up at the end of practice. “That’s football,” he said. “Sometimes you’re gonna take a few licks, get back up, deal it back.” Hubbard is coming off a breakout season in which he rushed for more than 900 yards and finished in the top five in the NFL in catch percentage. He entered training camp as the clear starter in a running back room that includes veteran Miles Sanders and Mike Boone and return specialist Raheem Blackshear. So the Canadian-born Hubbard is a key cog in Canales’ plan to establish the running game. And he liked how the offense functioned against the Jets on Thursday, when starters had as many as 50-60 snaps. “It was a great day. We started to see glimpses of who we’re gonna be and kind of putting it all together (during) different periods,” Hubbard said. “Obviously it felt good all being on the same track.” It’s unclear whether Hubbard and the offense will get a chance to put things together in a preseason game. Canales was noncommittal on whether the starters would play in the exhibition finale next weekend at Buffalo. Hubbard doesn’t have a strong feeling one way or the other. “The game obviously, you kind of get a different feel of actual tackling,” he said. “But whatever coach wants, I’m good with it.” Required reading Ten things from Panthers-Jets: Robert Hunt’s a dawg, and a need for Stephon Gilmore?

Unlike most of his best highlights, Mahomes wasn’t as thrilled by what he accomplished as everyone watching him, whether from the stands or on national TV, during the Kansas City Chiefs’ preseason game Saturday afternoon against the Detroit Lions. Less than two weeks after executing his trick in practice, the Chiefs quarterback threw and completed his first behind-the-back pass in a game during the opening quarter. Mahomes, who is known for his creative playstyle and rare arm strength, explained after the game that he was forced by his favorite teammate, tight end Travis Kelce, to use his improvisational skills. On a third-and-3 snap in Lions territory, Mahomes executed a play-action fake to fullback Carson Steele for a run-pass option play. However, Kelce, the primary pass catcher on the play, didn’t run the route designed for him. “I didn’t do it to look cool,” Mahomes said, smiling. “I literally did it as I was, like, pissed. I was like, ‘Why didn’t you run that route like that?’ It just worked out.” MAHOMES BEHIND THE BACK 🫢 📺: #DETvsKC on @NFLNetwork📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/eewdYOpS8c — NFL (@NFL) August 17, 2024 During the game, Mahomes told color analyst Trent Green on the NFL Network telecast: “I was pissed off at Travis. He was supposed to run a flat route. … I’m yelling at him and then he doesn’t run it. So out of spite, I threw a behind-the-back pass, but now it’s gonna be a highlight.” One reason Kelce didn’t run his intended route, and out route into the flat, was because edge rusher Josh Paschal engaged him near the line of scrimmage. Once Kelce realized Paschal pushed him in the opposite direction, he stopped and turned around in the middle of the field. “We had the leverage we wanted,” Mahomes said. “I should’ve known because (Kelce) asked me what (route) he had as he was motioning over. You can kind of see him look back at me. But I thought I told him and it was going to be open, so I pulled (the ball after the play-action fake) and then he wasn’t out there, so I was going to run for it. “Of course, he was blocking and then he just turned around and I threw it to him.” After pushing Kelce, Paschal began chasing Mahomes. By rolling to his right and swinging his right arm around his back, Mahomes created the ideal angle for the behind-the-back pass. Kelce caught the ball and ran for an 8-yard gain. He celebrated during the fans’ ovation by standing up and pointing at Mahomes. This son of a gun actually did it!! Magic Mahomes — Jason Kelce (@JasonKelce) August 17, 2024 Later in the game — which ended in a 24-23 win for the Lions — Kelce shared his perspective while on the Chiefs’ sideline during a short interview on the NFL Network broadcast, joking that he wasn’t at fault. “You know he’s got the voice thing,” Kelce said, ribbing Mahomes and imitating his distinctive voice. “He kind of mumbled out the play and I couldn’t hear it. I was walking up to the line and I was trying to decipher what he was saying. Before I knew it, he snapped the ball and then I kind of saw him out of my peripheral run to the sideline, so I was trying to go help my guy out. “By the time I looked over there, he was already in mid-form, like a photo on a sports card, throwing the ball to me, so I guess right place at the right time.” GO DEEPERUndrafted rookie Carson Steele never played fullback in college. Now he could make the Chiefs Throughout his 12-year career, Kelce has often executed daring things that most tight ends or receivers cannot. He can recognize the opposing defense’s coverage, alter his route — oftentimes deciding to run a completely different route in the middle of the play — and still be available and in rhythm with Mahomes before the ball is passed to him. One of Kelce’s touchdowns last season came because he improvised his route. Near the goal line, the Chiefs started their third-and-goal play against the Chicago Bears with Kelce in a bunch formation next to tight end Noah Gray and receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling. When Kelce heard the play call from Mahomes, his assignment was to run a corner route to the back pylon. But just before the ball was snapped, Kelce anticipated and visualized himself ending the play in the back of the end zone near the goal post. The Bears were in zone coverage, matching Kelce with safety Elijah Hicks. Kelce started his route running directly at Hicks, making the defender commit to covering the perimeter of the end zone. But after planting his right foot, Kelce ran a corner-post route, double move to create plenty of space for him to get open for a 3-yard touchdown reception. Who do you believe? QB1 or TE1 🤔😂 pic.twitter.com/O5R5kvtm0n — Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) August 17, 2024 Kelce ended his interview Saturday smiling and promising fans he didn’t ad-lib his part of the play. “Don’t let Pat trick you guys into me doing the wrong thing,” Kelce said. Coach Andy Reid’s response to the highlight was a simple one: He was just glad Mahomes’ behind-the-back pass ended as a completion. “I heard he blamed it on Kelce, but that’s all right,” Reid said. “(Mahomes) does it in practice, so I’m all right with it as long as it’s a completion. They do it in basketball (almost) every game, so it’s not that big of a deal.” But in NFL history, there appears to be no video of a quarterback even attempting a behind-the-back pass in a regular-season game. The last NFL quarterback to achieve the feat was Sonny Jurgensen, who dazzled fans out of necessity when he avoided a sack by completing a short behind-the-back pass to tight end Pete Retzlaff in a 1961 exhibition game in Chicago between the Philadelphia Eagles and the College All-Stars. Here's how you can step your game up, @PatrickMahomes… Sonny Jurgensen completing a pass behind his back in 1961: pic.twitter.com/p0mlnkYuQm — NFL Legacy (@NFLLegacy) February 20, 2019 A week ago, in one of the Chiefs’ last training camp practices, Mahomes perfectly executed a nifty behind-the-back pass to running back Isiah Pacheco during a red zone team period, the rep ending in a short-yardage touchdown. One of the reasons Mahomes attempted the behind-the-back pass was because the Chiefs’ defense blitzed. Safety Chamarri Conner attacked from the edge to take away Mahomes’ option of running with the ball on the perimeter. Mahomes responded by jumping to give him the proper angle for his creative pass. Pacheco expected the pass, too. He caught the ball, spun to his right and ran untouched to the end zone. “It was cool that I completed it,” Mahomes said after Thursday’s practice. “You want to get it in a live-type of atmosphere — and that’s as live as you’re going to get in practice.” GO DEEPERChiefs 53-man roster projection: Questions remain at running back, cornerback Mahomes first started experimenting with a behind-the-back pass during the 2018 season, when he attempted the feat in practices closed to fans and during team periods that were not observed by reporters. “The first thing he said was, ‘I’ve been telling you to do that for a while; that’s one of the plays I’ve been telling you that you can do it,'” Mahomes said Thursday of Reid’s reaction. “He’s all for it. It’s me who’s the one that’s hesitant to do it in a game.” After successful execution of his trick in a game, Mahomes knows he might be in a similar situation when he can use his unorthodox throwing motion — especially if the play involves improvising with Kelce — in the regular season, perhaps as early as the season opener on Sept. 5 against the Baltimore Ravens. “I always told you that if it’s going to happen, it’s going to have to happen naturally,” Mahomes said after Saturday’s game. “I can’t force it. It probably looked pretty cool. It’s not something I want to try to major in. “It might be something that just kind of happens every once in a while.” GO DEEPERHow Louis Rees-Zammit is tackling the transition from rugby to the NFL with the Chiefs Chiefs’ top rookies excel Receiver Xavier Worthy and left tackle Kingsley Suamataia, the Chiefs’ top two rookies, had encouraging performances in the first half Saturday. Worthy, the first-round pick, led the Chiefs before halftime with three receptions on six targets for 62 yards, including a 22-yard touchdown catch. He also showed his speed on a jet sweep that resulted in an 11-yard gain. Late in the first quarter, backup quarterback Carson Wentz beat a Lions blitz by throwing an intermediate pass to a wide-open Worthy, who used a stutter step at the top of his post route to help sprint past nickel cornerback Amik Robertson. “It was amazing,” Worthy said of his touchdown. “It was good to just have that first catch and first touchdown. Everybody is going to be nervous until they get their first catch. The wide-open ones are always the hardest because you relax so much and you’re like, ‘Oh, shoot, all I need to do is just secure it.’ It was big to focus and secure the ball.” WENTZ FINDS WORTHY FOR 6‼️ pic.twitter.com/bFmoVUBNIz — Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) August 17, 2024 As the projected starting left tackle, Suamataia, the second-round pick, did well in one-on-one, pass-blocking matchups against rookie edge rusher Isaac Ukwu. Suamataia’s lone mistake Saturday was early in the second quarter when he committed a false-start penalty. “I got to showcase my athleticism and we had a couple end-arounds,” Suamataia said. “It was fun and we showed we can be a running offense. I just went out there and played ball. As long as I stay between my guy and Patrick, that’s the goal.” Beyond his performance, Suamataia’s favorite moments came when he chatted with his cousin, Lions left tackle Penei Sewell, before and after the game. “It’s still surreal just seeing him on the other side of the field,” Suamataia said of Sewell. “This is my job and seeing him in our profession is amazing and a blessing just to see how far I’ve come. My cousin is one of the best in the league. He said I did (well).” (Photo: Denny Medley / USA Today)"
