Visiting London in September | What to Expect

Weather

The London temperature in September is still warm following summer, especially early in the month. It can get colder towards the end, but should remain mild throughout. Around eight days of rain is average, during the first month of autumn.

Average high: 20°C / 68°F

Average low: 13°C / 55°F

Average days of rain: 8

As autumn begins on 1st September, according to the meteorological calendar, you might expect the temperature to drop. However, September is the fourth-warmest month of the year in London. So the weather is very similar to what you can expect in June, the first summer month.

Mild weather

The UK has a mild climate, without any extremes as such. There are occasional storms and flash floods, but major weather events are very uncommon in the capital.

Changeable weather

London, like the rest of the UK, has a maritime climate. The fact that the country is an island means that the weather can change very quickly. So be prepared for rain at any time, even if the skies are clear and cloudless in the morning!

Wet weather

The UK is famous for its wet weather. In reality, you could visit during September and experience no rain at all – or there might be heavy showers every day. Often, there will be dry or wet spells lasting for several days at a time. It’s simply a matter of luck.

Daylight hours

In September, the sun rises between 6.15 and 7 am and sets between 7.45 and 6.40 pm. This gives you around 12 hours or more of daylight during most days of September.

Sunrise: Between about 06:15 and 07:00

Sunset: Between about 19:45 and 18:40

In September, you get plenty of daylight for exploring the city before darker skies set in towards the end of the year.

Sunset

At the start of September, the sun doesn’t set until around 7.45 pm. By the end of the month, sunset is at about 6.40 pm.

Sunrise

Sunrise in early September is at about 6.15 am, and around 7 am by the end of September.

What to pack

What to take to London in September includes a wind and waterproof jacket, a travel umbrella, and a strong pair of comfortable walking shoes or boots. You’ll also need extra layers for evenings and colder days.

While the September weather in London is usually mild, it gets colder during the evenings and overnight. Towards the end of the month, temperatures will also start to drop. Here’s what to wear in London in September.

You’ll do a lot of walking, so make sure you take comfortable shoes you can spend all day in. A change of footwear for the evenings is also a good idea. In September, you could need anything from sandals to boots, so something in-between like trainers or sneakers is ideal if you don’t want to pack too many pairs.

Outerwear

A waterproof jacket is a necessity during any season in London. Due to the unpredictability of the weather, and cooler evenings, layers can also be key. Garments such as a waterproof jacket with a removable fleece are perfect. A daypack with sufficient space is necessary to carry clothing you might shed as it gets warmer.

Layering

Active trousers with or without zip-off legs are ideal for September when it can be surprisingly hot on some days. On the top, wear a T-shirt when it’s warm enough, adding a sweater on top when required. Jeans are a good choice for evenings when it’s a little cooler.

Essentials

A packable waterproof jacket, a comfortable daypack and a travel umbrella are ideal accessories for a September trip to London.
