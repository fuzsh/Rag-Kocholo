SEATTLE - The Seattle SuperSonics and point guard Luke Ridnour have reached an agreement on a multiyear contract extension, the team said Monday.

The Sonics had until Tuesday to sign Ridnour to an extension, otherwise the fourth-year point guard could have become a restricted free agent after this season. Talks on an extension have been hampered by the sale of the Sonics to the Professional Basketball Club LLC, headed by Oklahoma City businessman Clay Bennett.

The sale of the Sonics and WNBA Storm was approved by the NBA Board of Governors last week, but doesn't close until Tuesday. Bennett was in Seattle on Monday and spent the morning meeting with general manager Rick Sund to discuss pending contract situations.

Ridnour averaged a career-high 11.5 points and 7.0 assists last season, his second as the Sonics' starting point guard.

In three seasons, Ridnour is averaging 9.2 points and 5.2 assists. He is part of the U.S. national team, but was not selected to play in last summer's World Championships.

Terms of the deal were not released.

Ridnour expressed frustration at the end of last season when coach Bob Hill used backup Earl Watson in the fourth quarter, while Ridnour watched from the bench. Those complaints prompted speculation that Ridnour would bypass signing an extension and instead test the free-agent market next summer.

But Ridnour's roots may have won out. Ridnour grew up in Blaine, Wash., near the Canadian border, and played his college ball at Oregon.
