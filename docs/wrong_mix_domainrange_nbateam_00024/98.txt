After averaging four points and two assists for Orlando last season, he was dealt to Charlotte last month in a deal involving Memphis and then almost immediately sent to the Thunder along with a conditional 2016 second-round draft pick for guard Jeremy Lamb.

Ridnour has averaged 9.3 points, 4.5 assists in 830 games — 493 starts — with Seattle (2003-’08), Milwaukee (2008-’10, 2013-’14), Minnesota (2010-’13), Charlotte (2013-’14) and Orlando (2014-’15).
