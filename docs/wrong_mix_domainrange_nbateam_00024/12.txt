It was on, it was off, now it's back on again. The Oklahoma City Thunder confirmed on draft day they have shipped Jeremy Lamb to the Hornets for Luke Ridnour and a conditional second round pick in 2016.

Ridnour (6-2, 175), a 12-year NBA veteran, has played in 830 career games (493 starts) with five teams, averaging 9.3 points, 2.3 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 1.00 steals in 26.1 minutes. The University of Oregon product spent the 2014-15 season with the Orlando Magic, appearing in 47 games and averaging 4.0 points, 1.4 rebounds and 2.0 assists in 14.5 minutes. Ridnour was acquired by the Memphis Grizzlies on June 24, 2015 before being traded to Charlotte in a separate transaction earlier today.

Lamb appeared in 47 games (eight starts) for the Thunder in the 2014-15 season, averaging 6.3 points and 2.3 rebounds in 13.5 minutes. In three seasons with the Thunder, Lamb saw action in 148 games (eight starts) and averaged 7.0 points, 2.1 rebounds and 1.1 assists in 15.7 minutes.

Oklahoma City is sending Lamb to the Charlotte Hornets who are sending Matt Barnes to the Memphis Grizzlies. Ridnour's contract is $2.7 million, non-guaranteed for 2015-16 so expect the Thunder to release him to free up a roster spot.

OKC acquired Lamb from the Houston Rockets in the James Harden trade. Lamb played in 148 games with the Thunder and averaged seven points, two rebounds and shot 35 percent from downtown. Houston drafted Lamb No. 12 overall in 2012.
