        "text": "Orlando Magic point guard Luke Ridnour has had a long, productive NBA career, playing 12 seasons with five different franchises.\n\nThe former Oregon Ducks star has started 493 of the 814 NBA games he has played in, and he has scored 7,677 points. The way he got those points gives him a unique distinction.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's Ben Cohen reports that Ridnour leads all active NBA players in career points scored without dunking. (Steve Nash of the Lakers has more, but he has not played this season.)\n\nRidnour has played for Seattle, Milwaukee, Minnesota, Charlotte and Orlando, and has scored in a variety of ways -- layups, floaters, jumpers and three-pointers (576 so far). But he has not dunked once as an NBA player.\n\nCohen relays this exchange between Orlando teammates:\n\n\"You've never dunked in the NBA?\" teammate Channing Frye said.\n\n\"Never even crossed my mind,\" Ridnour said.\n\nIn fact, Ridnour tells Cohen that he last dunked while playing for Blaine (Washington) High School. That means in three seasons with the Ducks, during which he had 431 field goals made and scored 1,399 points, not one basket came on a dunk.\n\nAnd he tells Cohen he does not expect to get a dunk anytime soon.\n\n\"I'm proud of that,\" he said. \"I'm OK with the zero.\""
