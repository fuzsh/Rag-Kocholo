In the past three games before the Wolves faced Utah on Wednesday night, Feb. 13, Ridnour was shooting 59 percent from the field and averaging 19.3 points per game.\n\n“Luke is always in the right spot for the most part and is always looking to make a shot for us. He has been great,” Wolves assistant coach Terry Porter said after the team’s shootaround Wednesday, Feb. 13.\n\nOn Monday in Cleveland, Ridnour made 9 of 14 shots and scored a team-high 21 points as the Wolves won their first road game since Jan. 3.\n\n“Coach (Rick Adelman) has used him a couple of times, given him a couple of calls, and it’s really helped him at the end of games,” Porter said.\n\nAgainst New York on Feb. 8, Ridnour drove to the basket, with the Timberwolves trailing 95-94 with 23 seconds left. Tyson Chandler blocked his shot, but Ridnour lobbied the officials for what he thought was a foul in an eventual 100-94 loss.\n\nPorter said Ricky Rubio might have been the first option to drive, but Ridnour is a viable second choice.\n\n“He is one of our better options,” said Porter of a team missing quality shooters Kevin Love, Chase Budinger and Brandon Roy. Ridnour, Porter added, “is a veteran. He has made big shots before. He is one of our key guys, and it’s key for us to make sure that he gets a chance to take a shot.”\n\nThe Wolves shot 57 percent from three-point range in Cleveland — more than 20 percent above their season average. The sweet shooting, which included 52 percent from the field, was the byproduct of better spacing, Porter said.\n\n“When we score some open shots, it opens the game and spreads the floor. It’s really helpful for us,” said center Nikola Pekovic, who had a double-double of 16 points and 10 rebounds against the Cavaliers.\n\nRubio said better defense has set up better offensive looks.\n\n“Our defense was pretty good, too, and that helps to get some comfortable shots down the stretch,” said Rubio, who also made more than half his shots on the two-game road trip to Memphis and Cleveland.\n\nBefore fellow guard JJ Barea sprained his foot against the Knicks, the Wolves were playing more with three guards, Rubio, Barea and Ridnour at the same time.\n\n“You have to take advantage when you play with three guards,” Rubio said. “You can take advantage of who is defending you.”\n\nOriginally Published: February 12, 2013 at 11:01 p.m."
