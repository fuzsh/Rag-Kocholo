        "text": "If you’ve been in an airport in the last week, you very well might have seen NBA player Luke Ridnour.\n\nSince last Wednesday, due to the vagaries of the NBA contract and free agency structure, Ridnour has been on five NBA teams, traded a remarkable four times. That’s crazy. I’ve barely worn five different shirts since last Wednesday. (I did laundry on Sunday, so I may have repeated a work shirt or two).\n\nIt puts me in the mind of that Bugs Bunny baseball cartoon where someone hits a home run that goes around the world and comes back with a bunch of passport stamps on it. Someone should do a meme with Ridnour shooting a 3-pointer and having it come back to him with a bunch of different NBA logos on it.\n\nLet’s go through it.\n\nRidnour finished the season with the Orlando Magic and last Wednesday, the day before the draft, he was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies. The morning of the draft he was traded to the Charlotte Hornets. During the draft, he was traded by the Hornets to the Oklahoma City Thunder as part of a deal that sent Jeremy Lamb to Charlotte.\n\nHe had an epic stint with the Thunder. We’re talking an entire weekend as Kevin Durant’s running mate, but alas, that era ended after five days when he was traded by the Thunder on Tuesday to the Toronto Raptors.\n\nSo to recap, that’s Orlando to Memphis to Charlotte to Oklahoma City to Toronto. If you drove it, it would be 3,797 miles. And I thought the NBA didn’t have traveling.\n\nRidnour’s contract, not his skill level, is the reason he keeps getting traded. It’s a perfect bargaining chip in the convoluted world of NBA money. By acquiring him and cutting him, the Raptors can use the amount of his 2015-16 contract ($2.75 million) to spend on free agents this summer.\n\nTeams consider Ridnour a $2.75 million bill, not a veteran backup shooting guard.\n\nHe can officially be called a journeyman now, although I’m not sure six hours in Charlotte constitutes a journey. He’s been on eight different teams, two of them twice.\n\nHere’s the worst part, Ridnour has such an effective realtor that he actually bought a house in all five locations. Kidding, of course. He spent the entire time in Seattle, where he spends the offseason with his family.\n\nAnd even though he is currently a Raptor, Ridnour isn’t spending his time figuring out the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the loonies and toonies.\n\nWhen July 10 rolls around, he’ll probably add another passport stamp. The Raptors acquired him with the full intention of waiving him on that day, making him a free agent.\n\nAnd he gets it. But his time is coming. After July 10, the team that seeks his services will be doing it for basketball reasons. Or no one will be interested in his services and the 34-year-old can call it a career.\n\nThen he can spend the next couple years focused on his post-career line of work — hanging up all of his NBA jerseys in his man cave.\n\nShad Powers is sports columnist for The Desert Sun.
