        "text": "Reinhold Matay/Associated Press\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies reportedly acquired point guard Luke Ridnour from the Orlando Magic on Wednesday in exchange for Janis Timma, a second-round pick in the 2013 NBA draft.\n\nAdrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo Sports broke the news. Ridnour, 34, is heading into the final season of his contract and is scheduled to make $2.75 million, according to Spotrac.\n\nHe signed with Orlando last summer but was an extremely limited contributor for the Magic. He averaged just four points and two assists while playing a career-low 14.5 minutes per game.\n\nWith Beno Udrih already in the mix to back up Mike Conley, the timing of the acquisition will raise some eyebrows in Memphis. Geoff Calkins of the Commercial Appeal believes the wheeling and dealing may continue:\n\nTimma was the final pick of the 2013 draft. The 22-year-old Latvian has continued to play in his home country with Ventspils and VEF Riga. It remains unclear when the swingman will make the NBA jump.\n\nReal GM previously reported he was looking into a Euroleague move for next term, as Memphis wasn't planning to bring him over. Whether the outlook will change with Orlando is unclear. The Magic also save cap space in the meantime.\n\nRidnour can provide some veteran stability at the point for the Grizzlies. That said, the bigger story is that it appears Memphis might be setting itself up to make a more impactful move, potentially at this week's draft."
