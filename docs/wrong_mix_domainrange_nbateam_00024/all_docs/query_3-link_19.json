        "text": "No one who has played in the NBA this season has scored as much in his career as Ridnour without dunking, according to Stats LLC. This play-by-play data dates to the 2003 season, but only Steve Nash tops Ridnour in this inauspicious statistical category. “There’s got to be more than that,” Ridnour said. “Muggsy?”\n\nMagic point guard Luke Ridnour said Monday he will seriously begin assessing how much longer he will play after this season. “It all goes by so fast,” he said of his career, now in its 12th season. “My family is the most important thing. . . . After this [season,] I’ll just take it season to season.”\n\nWhen Luke Ridnour joined the Seattle SuperSonics as a rookie in 2003, veterans Brent Barry and Ray Allen helped him make the transition to the NBA. “It’s crazy how fast it goes,” Ridnour said. “And now I’m that guy for some younger guys.” The Orlando Magic hope Ridnour can influence second-year guard Victor Oladipo and rookie guard Elfrid Payton just like Barry and Allen helped him 11 years ago. The Magic signed Ridnour, a pass-first point guard, to a two-year contract Friday."
