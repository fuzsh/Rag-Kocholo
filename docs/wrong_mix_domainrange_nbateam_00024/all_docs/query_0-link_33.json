        "text": "Who is really the better GM?\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves (10-33) vs. Houston Rockets (20-25)\n\nDaryl Morey is often lauded as one of the best General Managers in the NBA. An MIT-grad who has become the poster boy for the Advanced Stats movement, he has been mentioned by several media members and bloggers as worthy of being voted the NBA's \"Executive of the Year\".\n\nDavid Kahn is often seen as one of the worst in the NBA. Kahn's drafting, his trades, his knowledge of the game of basketball; all are seen as examples of Kahn's awfulness.\n\nYet, when you break it down, who is really the better GM? Why is Morey given so much credit and Kahn given so little? In addition to breaking down tonight's matchup with the Rockets, I thought I'd also break down Morey vs. Kahn and bring a little truthiness to the proceedings.\n\nHow is a center who is shorter than Corey Brewer going to stop Darko Milicic?\n\nDarko Milicic vs. Chuck Hayes\n\nBrilliant move by Mr. Morey. His starting center is 6'6\" and cannot score from the post or block shots. At least he's only paid $1.9 million this season.\n\nMeanwhile, Darko Milicic is one of the best shot blockers in the league - and when he's dialed in - can be a tremendous offensive option in the post.\n\nBut this summer, Kahn was the one getting destroyed for the Darko signing, while no one said 'boo' about Chuck Hayes. Don't even bring up Yao Ming.\n\nWinner: David Kahn\n\nI hear Luis Scola's favorite song is a toss up between California Gurls and Teenage Dream.\n\nKevin Love vs. Luis Scola\n\nBy almost all accounts, Luis Scola is having a better year than last year. He's scoring more. He's turning the ball over less. His shooting percentages are down but he's still been able to capitalize on Yao Ming's absence.\n\nThe problem is that when Luis Scola - an undersized power forward whose best trait is rebounding and who cannot create his own shot - is your best player, your team is not going to be very good.\n\nThankfully, the Minnesota Timberwolves don't have such a problem.\n\nWinner: David Kahn\n\nEven Coach K couldn't get anything out this guy.\n\nMichael Beasley vs. Shane Battier\n\nNow that Shane Batter is getting older, and is having more foot problems, his one skill - defense - is dwindling. He can't create his own shot and isn't great at finishing at the rim. He still has his basketball IQ and can make a good pass from time to time, but his days of being a +/- superstar are over. Now, he's just a mediocre veteran on a below-mediocre team.\n\nNot Michael Beasley and the Timberwolves. Beasley, despite having ankle problems this year, is still the best offensive option for the team. When he stays out of foul trouble, he's as good as anyone in the league at scoring the basketball. Is he efficient? Who knows. Do you notice how the only people who worry about \"efficient\" scorers are fans of losing teams? Kobe Bryant isn't that efficient. But he's been to the NBA Finals three straight seasons, so who really cares?\n\nWinner: David Kahn\n\nWhose shot is uglier: Kevin Martin or Shawn Marion?\n\nCorey Brewer vs. Kevin Martin\n\nKevin Martin is supposedly an efficient - there's that word again - scorer who creates a lot of contact and makes a good percentage of his shots. He's also one of the worst defenders at his position and both Sacramento and Houston have both defended substantially better when he was off of the court.\n\nSounds like the exact opposite of Corey Brewer. A great defender who isn't a great scorer, Brewer is nonetheless going to get a big payday from some team this coming offseason. I just hope it's the Timberwolves. If you give me the choice to pick Kevin Martin or Corey Brewer, I'll gladly take the former Gator every day of the week and twice on Sunday.\n\nThe Rockets can keep falling short of the playoffs with Mr. Efficient.\n\nWinner: David Kahn\n\nLet's see...a quick, 6'0\" point guard who overdribbles and lacks court vision...where have I heard that before?\n\nLuke Ridnour vs. Aaron Brooks\n\nI'm not exactly sure why, if you asked the casual fan, he would likely say that Aaron Brooks would be the best point guard on the Minnesota Timberwolves. I'm not even sure why Brooks is substantially better than Jonny Flynn. Both Brooks and Flynn are shooting less than 40% from the floor. Both have similar assist rates, turnover rates and rebound rates. Brooks scores more points but also plays more minutes with a much higher usage rate.\n\nYet, Brooks was a \"brilliant draft choice\" by Morey and Flynn was a \"draft bust\" simply because Flynn was picked several spots higher. Double-standards.\n\nThat's not even bringing Luke Ridnour into the equation. Ridnour scores a little less than Brooks, but is better in nearly every other statistical category, including PER. Ridnour's hamstring has been an issue and its not certain that Ridnour will start tonight. If he doesn't, it will be Jonny Flynn vs. Older Jonny Flynn.\n\nWinner: David Kahn\n\nDaryl Morey vs. David Kahn\n\nFirst, let's look at Morey's accomplishments:\n\nDaryl Morey was promoted from Assistant General Manager on May 10, 2007, and took over a team that was 52-30 the previous season and had lost to the Utah Jazz in the first round of the playoffs. He had two All-Stars on his roster and coach Jeff Van Gundy was on the sidelines.\n\nThat offseason, Morey drafted Aaron Brooks (Jonny Flynn in two years) and Carl Landry, signed Steve Francis and traded for Luis Scola. He still had the same two All-Stars, but he exchanged coaches for Rick Adelman.\n\nFor this work, what did he get? 3 more wins (55-27) and another loss to the Utah Jazz in the first round of the playoffs. Bravo.\n\nThe following season, he brought in such great talent as Joey Dorsey, Brent Barry and Von Wafer to the team. They beat a young Portland team in the playoffs and then got smashed by the Lakers in the second round.\n\nThe next season, it all came crashing down. Morey took a gamble on Trevor Ariza and lost, having to dump him the following season for Courtney Lee. He drafted the incomparable Chase Budinger and took on Jared Jeffries salary for Jordan Hill and a couple of picks from the New York Knicks. He also traded Carl Landry - his best draft pick ever - for overpaid Kevin Martin.\n\nThe result of all these moves? Only 42 wins and no playoff appearance.\n\nThis season, Morey's Rockets aren't even above .500.\n\nIn a little more than two seasons, he was able to take a playoff contender and turn them into a lottery team. Fans of his might want to say, \"Yeah, but Yao Ming and Tracy McGrady were always hurt. That wasn't his fault.\"\n\nNonsense. In 2007, it didn't take a shaman to know that Yao and McGrady were two of the most injury-prone guys in the league. To tie your hopes to those players for that long is either being naive, stubborn or both. This year's lottery pick - Patrick Patterson - has played in only 16 of 45 games and is, so far, not a meaningful contributor.\n\nNow, let's look at David Kahn:\n\nKahn took over for one of the most inept General Managers in NBA history - Kevin McHale - and inherited a roster with one above-average player, some cap space and some draft picks at bad spots in weak drafts. As the result of a terrible Kevin Garnett trade that set the franchise back perhaps a decade, Kahn has made several moves, both good and bad.\n\nSure, he could've drafted Steph Curry, but its not as if Curry's name is being brought up for All-Star consideration. He's not even a full step above Luke Ridnour in terms of production this season. Sure, some wanted DeMarcus Cousins, but Cousins is currently on a team that's even worse than ours. Why should we think he'd make any more of a difference - as far as Wins and Losses go - in Minnesota?\n\nJonny Flynn went too high, and so far, Wesley Johnson isn't anything special. But with one of the greatest point guards in Europe on deck and one of the greatest power forwards in the game on the roster, the Wolves are headed upwards. The Rockets, meanwhile, are headed in the other direction.\n\nIf Morey didn't have the injuries excuse and the playoff wins that he got from inheriting an already-good team - oh, and if he didn't use advanced stats - he'd be just another bumbling GM. Unfortunately, since he's friends with Bill Simmons and started the Sloan Sports Conference, he's seen as some kind of visionary, despite results that say otherwise.\n\nWinner: David Kahn\n\nCome on and jump on the Wolves' bandwagon. There's a seat available...\n\nMy Prediction: David Kahn will end his career with more championship rings than Daryl Morey.\n\nTimberwolves' Record: 11-33"
