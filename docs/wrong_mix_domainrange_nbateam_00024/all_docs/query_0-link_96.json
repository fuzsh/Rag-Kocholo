        "text": "The Oregon Ducks may not be considered a blue-blood program when it comes to the world of men’s college basketball, but, over the years, they have been no stranger to success.\n\nThe ‘Tall Firs’ were the winners of the first NCAA Tournament in 1939, and the Ducks have been a mainstay among the best teams in the nation for decades, especially when looking since the turn of the century.\n\nWhile Oregon isn’t on the same tier as college basketball’s blue-blood programs, it has put together a rather impressive resume:\n\nNational Championships: 1 (1939)\n\nFinal Four Appearances: 2 (1939, 2017)\n\nElite Eight Appearances: 7 (1939, 1945, 1960, 2002, 2007, 2016, 2017)\n\nSweet Sixteen Appearances: 8 (1960, 2002, 2007, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2021)\n\nThere have been some legendary coaches in the history of Oregon basketball, but those coaches wouldn’t have been able to achieve their success without some of the players who were on the floor.\n\nThat begs the question, who would make up Oregon basketball’s all-time starting five? Today at the DucksWire, we’re going to unpack who those players should be, and their credentials:"
