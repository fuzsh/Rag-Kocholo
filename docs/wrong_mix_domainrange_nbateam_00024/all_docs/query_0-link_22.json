        "text": "After being traded four times this offseason, NBA free-agent guard Luke Ridnour has made a move that will keep him from getting dealt next season and possibly ever again. Ridnour has decided that he will not play the 2015-16 NBA season, a source told Yahoo Sports. The 12-year NBA veteran has not announced his retirement although his return to professional basketball appears doubtful. Ridnour received interest in free agency, but it wasnâ€™t reciprocated.\n\nPelicans sign Antonio Reeves to a three-year contract\n\nMichael Scotto: The New Orleans Pelicans and Antonio Reeves have agreed to a three-year, $5.41 million deal, league sources told @hoopshype. Reeves was the No. 47 overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft by the Orlando Magic and was acquired by the Pelicans in a trade during the draft.\n\nFormer Sacramento Kings shooting guard Ben McLemore has sold his custom-built El Dorado Hills home in the prestigious Serrano Country Club community for $1.9 million. McLemore bought the home in 2020 for $1.49 million, according to public records, and then built a pool in the backyard."
