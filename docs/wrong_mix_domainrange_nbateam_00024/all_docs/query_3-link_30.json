        "text": "Luke Ridnour woke up Wednesday morning like most mornings. He had a wonderful life as a professional basketball player for the Orlando Magic. Things were good.\n\nThen, out of nothing, there was CHAOS.\n\nFirst, Ridnour (who has an expiring contract that can be bought out by an NBA team for free) was traded from the Magic to the Grizzlies. Cool.\n\nBut it wasn’t over.\n\nFrom there, Ridnour was traded to the Hornets in a deal that brought Matt Barnes to the Grizzlies. Alright. Maybe this would mean the end of this…\n\nNO. After that trade, Ridnour found out he’d been traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Jeremy Lamb and a draft pick.\n\nThe day isn’t over, either. More trades could happen. Luke Ridnour probably has no idea where he lives, what team he’s on, anything. I hope each team got him a jersey, though."
