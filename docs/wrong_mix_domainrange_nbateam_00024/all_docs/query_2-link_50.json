But he capitalized on his second chance, hitting the dagger with time expiring over the outstretched arms of Pacers Forward, Danny Granger.\nIn the words of Granger after the game: ‚ÄúHe made a hell of a shot.‚Äù\n\nLuke finished the contest with 17 points & 6 assists.\n\n‚ÄúThe desire accomplished is sweet to the soul.‚Äù - Proverbs 13:19.\n\nüé•: NBA - ‚ÄúI Love This Game‚Äù feat. Luke Ridnour (tv spot, 2006) \n\n#Seattle #Supersonics #Sonics #BringEmBack #SaveOurSonics\".",
