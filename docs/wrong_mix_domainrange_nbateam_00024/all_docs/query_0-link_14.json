        "text": "Luke Ridnour is the new Alonzo Gee. Or is he the next Quentin Richardson? Either way, he must've completely forgotten the concept of a home in the last 24 hours.\n\nThat's because Ridnour has been on four teams — the Magic, Grizzlies, Hornets and now Thunder — in the past ... wait for it ... DAY! Gee went through a similar situation last offseason; Q-Rich did back in 2009.\n\nRidnour's contract is non-guaranteed for next season as of now, which makes him a valuable tool on the trade market. Trade for him, unload some salary and then cut him and you've created a little more cap room for yourself. Or, like the Magic, Grizzlies and Hornets did, you can acquire him purely as an asset and then flip him to a team looking to open up a little room under the cap.\n\nThe Grizzlies acquired Ridnour from the Magic on Wednesday for the rights to overseas forward Janis Timma. Memphis immediately turned around and dealt him to the Hornets for Matt Barnes. Now, he's off again, reports Adrian Wojnarowski, this time to Oklahoma City in a deal that will net Charlotte Jeremy Lamb.\n\nIt's an odd situation, and it's got to be awful for Ridnour, but it's also just weird enough that it has to leave you with a smirk: \"Luke Ridnour got traded again?!?! How does this keep happening?!?!\"\n\nLet's just chalk this up as another one of those super odd story lines we have going into the draft every year."
