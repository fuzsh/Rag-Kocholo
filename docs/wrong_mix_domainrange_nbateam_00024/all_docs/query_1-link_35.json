        "text": "Former Wolves guard Luke Ridnour played 14 minutes off the bench in his first game against his old mates since the Bobcats acquired him and his expiring contract from the woeful Bucks at the trade deadline. “I was glad to get out of Milwaukee,” said Ridnour, who played three seasons for the Wolves before he was traded to the Bucks last July. “It’s a good situation here. I’ve only played five, six games here so I’m trying to get used to it. It’s a good city and I’ve been in the playoffs before and just to be back in the hunt where every game is big, it’s just a lot different feeling. . … This has been fun.”\n\nSources close to the situation in Milwaukee have informed Basketball Insiders that despite the widespread reports circulating, actual trade talks have been slow and the general feeling in the locker room among players is that there won’t be a rash of moves at the deadline. The source maintains the situation remains fluid, but the team is likely to hold on to assets such as Ersan Ilyasova, Gary Neal and Luke Ridnour if they cannot secure the desired package in return."
