        "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) â€“ The Oklahoma City Thunder has sent Luke Ridnour and cash to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for a trade exception and the rights to forward Tomislav Zubcic.\n\nThe Thunder will have one year to exercise the trade exception.\n\nRidnour averaged 4.0 points per game for Orlando last season. He has played for five teams in 12 years, and has a career scoring average of 9.3 points per game.\n\nZubcic was the 56th overall pick in the 2012 draft and has yet to play in the NBA.\n\nThe Thunder acquired Ridnour and a conditional 2016 second-round draft pick last week from the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for guard Jeremy Lamb."
