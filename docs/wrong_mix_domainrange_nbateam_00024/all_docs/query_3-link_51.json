Named to Dick Vitale’s preseason All-Rolls Royce second team. A member of the 2003 USA Basketball Pan American Games team that placed fourth with a 3-3 record in August in the Dominican Republic. Leaves everything on the floor and will not be defeated for lack of effort. Not afraid of challenging bigger players inside. With good shooting range and aggressive attitude about rebounding, is an ideal wing man in the Pac-10, but also is gritty enough to play the four spot if needed.
