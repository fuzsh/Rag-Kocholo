        "text": "Just when Luke Ridnour thought he was safely ensconced in the comfortable rural confines of Oklahoma City, he gets traded. Again.\n\nIf you've been keeping track, the 33-year-old journeyman (no joke) point guard finished the season with the Orlando Magic, playing in 47 games for the team with averages of 4.0 points and 2.0 assists. He was then traded to the Memphis Grizzlies, who in turn traded him to the Charlotte Hornets, who then traded him to OKC.\n\nRidnour now heads to a Toronto team in need of a third (or perhaps second) guard--assuming Lou Williams leaves in free agency, and Delon Wright is not quite ready yet to be the full-time backup. When you factor in the cash considerations (the NBA's great mystery box), the trade feels like a win for the Raptors.\n\nIt does mean we have to say goodbye to the totally unknown 25-year-old Croatian Tomislav Zubcic, just one more second round pick to be bounced around the NBA, but such is life.\n\nStill, the big question of the trade: Will Ridnour stay in Toronto? Will he get traded again? When will this madness end?\n\n(Seriously, does Ridnour even unpack his bags anymore?)"
