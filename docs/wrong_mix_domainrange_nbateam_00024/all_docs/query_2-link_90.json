        "text": "TORONTO — The Toronto Raptors waived oft-traded guard Luke Ridnour on Thursday.\n\nToronto acquired Ridnour and cash considerations from the Oklahoma City Thunder on June 30 for the draft rights to forward Tomislav Zubcic.\n\nRELATED: Which NBA players played for the most number of franchises?\n\nAfter averaging four points and two assists for Orlando last season, he was dealt to Charlotte last month in a deal involving Memphis and then almost immediately sent to the Thunder along with a conditional 2016 second-round draft pick for guard Jeremy Lamb.\n\nRidnour has averaged 9.3 points, 4.5 assists in 830 games — 493 starts — with Seattle (2003-’08), Milwaukee (2008-’10, 2013-’14), Minnesota (2010-’13), Charlotte (2013-’14) and Orlando (2014-’15)."
