        "text": "The Thunder will waive Ridnour if they do not use him in another deal before before July 10 when his contract becomes guaranteed. Ridnour was traded by the Orlando Magic to the Memphis Grizzlies for the rights to 2013 second-round pick Janis Timma on Wednesday then was sent to the Hornets in a deal earlier Thursday that delivered Matt Barnes to Memphis.\n\nOklahoma City is trying to clear salary-cap space to pay restricted free agents Enes Kanter and Kyle Singler.\n\nLamb, 23, averaged 6.3 points and 2.3 rebounds in 47 games for the Thunder last season. He spent his first three seasons in Oklahoma City, which acquired him in the James Harden trade with the Houston Rockets."
