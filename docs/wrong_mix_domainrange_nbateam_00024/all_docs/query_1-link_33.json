        "text": "Round and round and round he goes. Where he stops, nobody knows.\n\nThat's been the NBA offseason thus far for Luke Ridnour, who was traded for a fourth time this offseason as the Oklahoma City Thunder sent the guard to the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday.\n\nIn return, the Thunder got a $2.85 million trade exception and the rights to Tomislav Zubcic.\n\nRidnour was acquired by the Thunder prior to the draft in a deal with the Charlotte Hornets that moved Jeremy Lamb.\n\nSince the end of the season, Ridnour has also been shipped from the Orlando Magic to the Memphis Grizzlies, from the Grizzlies to the Hornets, and from the Hornets to the Thunder.\n\nRidnour, 34, has a fully nonguaranteed contract for next season that can be waived until July 10, which makes him a very tradable asset.\n\nA 12-year veteran, Ridnour appeared in 47 games last season averaging 4.0 points and 2.0 assists for the Magic.\n\nThe Thunder will have one year to exercise the trade exception. Zubcic was the 56th overall pick in the 2012 draft and has yet to play in the NBA."
