        "text": "Luke Ridnour has had quite a week.\n\nLast week, Ridnour was traded right before the NBA Draft from the Orlando Magic to the Memphis Grizzlies. The Grizzlies then traded Ridnour to the Charlotte Hornets for Matt Barnes. Ridnour was then traded by the Hornets to the Oklahoma City Thunder in a trade involving Jeremy Lamb. The Thunder held on to Ridnour for five days before shipping him to the Toronto Raptors today for a $2.85 million trade exception.\n\nRidnour may not even stay with the Raptors as they could trade him again or waive him. Since Ridnour has a non-guaranteed contract, the Raptors can release him at no cost if he is waived before July 10.\n\nMore than likely, Ridnour did not actually travel to Memphis, Charlotte or Oklahoma City after he was traded. He probably won't even be traveling to Toronto. After July 10, Ridnour's future will become much clearer and he can officially focus on next season, wherever he ends up playing."
