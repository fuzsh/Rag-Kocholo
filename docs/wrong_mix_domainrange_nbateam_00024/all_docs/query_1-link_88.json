Ridnour said Kyson was released from the hospital on Sept. 9.\n\n“From May to August is when things got pretty bad,” Ridnour said. “We almost lost him.”\n\nRidnour, who started 66 games at point guard last season, missed six games in February when Kyson was diagnosed. Ridnour said Kyson, now 10 months old, is doing well and getting stronger each day. Most victims of the condition, particularly infants, are unable to swallow food or liquids.\n\nIf not for the lockout, Ridnour might have missed the opportunity to see Kyson’s progress and help Katie care for him. The labor dispute cost the NBA the first two months of the regular season but gave Ridnour quality time with his family.\n\n“At one point during the summer, basketball wasn’t that important to me,” Ridnour said.\n\nRidnour got emotional on media day Friday when discussing his family situation with reporters. He paused as his eyes started to water but kept his composure.\n\nOther Wolves players started arriving earlier in the week for individual workouts, but Ridnour waited as long as he could before leaving Seattle. He didn’t arrive in the Twin Cities until Thursday night.\n\nSince then, Ridnour has been able to focus more on new coach Rick Adelman and his system. He also will take his turn mentoring rookie point guard Ricky Rubio, who’s expected to get significant playing time in Adelman’s motion offense.\n\nRidnour turns 31 in February. With the glut of games in the abbreviated 66-game schedule, it might be difficult for him to average 30 minutes, as he did last season.\n\n“I’m at the point of my career where I’m tired of losing,” said Ridnour, who averaged 11.8 points and a team-high 5.4 assists last season. “I don’t want to go through what we did last year. I’m willing to do whatever it takes to help us win.”\n\nIn Ridnour’s mind, he already has a pretty important victory.\n\nOriginally Published: December 10, 2011 at 11:01 p.m."
