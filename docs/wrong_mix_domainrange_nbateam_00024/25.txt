Luke Ridnour went on an amusing NBA journey in just one week.

Currently, Ridnour is a member of the Toronto Raptors but this is the fifth team that he has been on in the past seven days. Since he has a non-guaranteed contract, teams have been using Ridnour as a trade chip to get cap space and acquire assets. Ridnour went from the Magic to the Grizzlies, then he was traded to the Thunder, who then shipped him to the Hornets. Charlotte held on to Ridnour for a few days before they traded him to the Raptors. Toronto may move Ridnour again or even waive him at no cost if they do so before July 10.

So what does Ridnour think of all of these trades? He is apparently taking it all in stride as he told ESPN's Mike & Mike. Ridnour hasn't been traveling from city to city, instead he is just at home outside of Seattle getting updates from his agent.

"To be honest, its been pretty funny for us," Ridnour told Mike & Mike. "Being in the NBA, you never know what's going to happen and coming into free agency, I knew I had a contract that was desirable for a trade chip or whatever it might be. Getting the updates daily, was pretty funny."

It is good to hear that Ridnour has been able to laugh about getting traded four times in one week. Having a sense of humor is key in any job including playing in the NBA. Ridnour also added that he believes he will become a free agent after July 10, which means the Raptors or the next team that acquires him will waive him. If that does actually happen, Ridnour's journey will most definitely become the answer to an NBA trivia question.
