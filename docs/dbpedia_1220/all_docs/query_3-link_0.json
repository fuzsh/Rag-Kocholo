        "text": "British politician\n\nSir John William Anderson, 1st Baronet (ca. 1736 – 21 May 1813) was a British politician.\n\nBorn in Danzig, he was the son of William Anderson and Lucy Sheldon who had settled in that town.[1] Anderson was an alderman of Aldersgate between 1789 and 1813 and Sheriff of London between 1791 and 1792. He was Master of the Worshipful Company of Glovers in 1794.[2] He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for London from 1793 to 1806. Between 1797 and 1798, Anderson was Lord Mayor of London. On 14 May 1798, he was made a baronet, of Mill Hill, Hendon, in the County of Middlesex.[3]\n\nIn 1762, he married Dorothy Simkins, daughter of Charles Simkins. Their marriage was childless. Anderson died in May 1813 and the baronetcy became extinct.\n\nInvolvement in slave trade\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn, with his brother Alexander, owned a slave factory on Bance Island.[5] Their business was based in Philpot Lane, Eastcheap.[6] John was active politically to prevent any restrictions in the running of the slave trade, for example working with his brother to organise a petition to the House of Lords in 1799.[6]: 140–1 John was also an investor in the West India Dock Company.[5] He was a director of the company from 1803 until his death.[1]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nHansard 1803–2005: contributions in Parliament by Sir John Anderson, Bt"
