        "text": "BARONETAGE - INTRODUCTION AND RECORDS INTRODUCTION Guide to the tables The first column on the baronetage pages shows the date upon which the relevant baronet succeeded to the title, or, in the case of the first baronet shown under a particular name, the date the baronetcy was originally created. The second column shows the type of baronetcy, being one of either:- E = A baronet of England created between 1611 (the first being Bacon of Redgrave, Suffolk) and 1706 (the last being Halford of Welham, Leics) I = A baronet of Ireland created between 1619 (the first being Sarsfield of Carrickleamlery, Cork) and 1799 (the last being Smith of Tuam, King's County) NS = A baronet of Nova Scotia created between 1625 (the first being Gordon of Letterfourie) and 1707 (the last being Craigie of Gairsay, Orkney) GB = A baronet of Great Britian created between 1707 (the first being Furnese of Waldershare, Kent) and 1800 (the last being Stirling of Faskine, Lanark) UK = A baronet of the United Kingdom created after 1800 (the first being Vavasour of Spaldington, Yorkshire) The third column shows the order of succession to each baronetcy. The fourth column shows the full name of the relevant baronet. If that name is prefaced with a \"Sir\" it indicates that the baronet had previously been awarded a knighthood. The fifth column shows the date of birth (where known) of the baronet. A date in italics indicates the date of baptism. The sixth column shows the date of death (where known) of the baronet. A date in italics indicates the date of burial. In both of the fifth and sixth columns a \"c\" before the year of birth or death indicates that the date is approximate only, but is likely to be within 2 or 3 years of the correct date. In all but a few instances, the blue box which contains the name of the baronetcy is followed by an address (e.g. Abdy of Felix Hall, Essex). Such an address relates to the baronet who received the original creation and may or may not bear any relation to the current holder of the title. Where a number of baronets share the same surname, these are listed in chronological order according to the date of creation. A short history of the baronetage As shown above, there are various classes of baronets - those of England, Ireland, Nova Scotia (Scotland), Great Britain and the United Kingdom. The order of the Baronetage was founded in May 1611 by King James I of England for the purpose of raising money to be spent \"on the civilization and settlement of Ireland.\" Due to the attainder of its previous owners, the whole province of Ulster had become vested in the Crown and James I conferred grants of land upon all who would undertake to maintain thirty soldiers there for three years and pay Â£1095 into the English treasury. In return, the title of baronet was conferred, with an undertaking that no hereditary dignity would ever be created to intervene between baronets and the peerage. When first created, the order was limited to 200, but this limit has long been ignored. For the first 216 years of the existence of this dignity, the eldest son of a baronet was entitled, on reaching adulthood, to the privilege of claiming the honour of knighthood. A clause to this effect was inserted in every patent of creation until 19 December 1827, when King George IV revoked this right for all future creations. Since that time, this clause has been omitted from all patents, although, since the revocation was not retrospective, this right theoretically still exists in those baronetcies created before 1827. To the best of my knowledge, however, this right has been granted on only three occasions since 1827 with the last time being in 1874, when a knighthood was granted to Ludlow Cotter, son of Sir James Cotter, Baronet of Rockforest, Cork. With one exception only, all baronetage creations have been men. The sole exception was a baronetcy conferred upon Mary Bolles of Osberton, Notts, in 1635. However, on a small number of occasions a baronetcy has been inherited by a female and can also, in some instances, descend through a female. The descent of a baronetcy is governed by the same rules as in the case of peerages, most often to heirs male of the body lawfully begotten (unless there is a special remainder outlined in the patent of creation - such special remainders are noted throughout the baronetage pages - or, in the case of most patents granted by Charles I, where the patents were to heirs male whatsoever). Baronets of Scotland are referred to as being baronets of Nova Scotia. This is due to the fact that, when this order was instituted, its purpose was to encourage the establishment of the province of Nova Scotia in what is now Canada. The patents granted certain portions of land in the province and were accompanied by a baronetcy. The newly created baronet was required to pay 2000 marks or to support six settlers for two years. Precedence among baronetcies is decided by the date of creation alone. The Official Roll of the Baronetage is administered by the Standing Council of the Baronetage, first formed in 1898 and re-constituted in 1903. Two of the objects of that Council are to publish an Official Roll and to advise heirs apparent to baronetcies on how to prove their claim, and, as a result, to be entered onto the Official Roll. As part of a Royal Warrant of Edward VII dated 8 February 1910, it was stated that \"no person whose name is not entered on the Official Roll of Baronets shall be received as a Baronet, or shall be addressed or mentioned by that title in any civil or military commission, Letters Patent or other official document.\" Those baronetcies listed by the Standing Council as having unproved successions are not currently included on the Official Roll. However, my listings draw no distinction of this nature, save that those baronets not currently included on the Official Roll are shown in blue, or, for those baronetcies subsumed in peerages, a note included stating that the relevant baronetcy is not currently included on the Official Roll of the Baronetage.

March 1762. If not he would not appear on this list at all. The oldest age at which a person has been created a baronet is 93 years and 196 days in the case of Sir George Burns, who was born 10 December 1795 and created a baronet 24 June 1889. Longest held baronetcies When I first started compiling this listing I believed that baronetcies held for 60 years would provide a reasonable listing. I soon discovered however that this produced a massive number of entries - over 460 in all, and this without including baronetcies held within peerages. I have therefore contented myself with those baronetcies held for 80 years or more, including those baronetcies held within peerages.

Leslie Lynn Marr, 2nd baronet [UK 1919] 24 Nov 1932 84/342* * as at 1st November 2017 ~ = approximately Shortest held baronetcies In the same way that a cut-off period of 60 years led to an unacceptably large result for longest- held baronetcies, a cut-off period of less than one year leads to a similar outcome for shortest- held baronetcies. By my reckoning, at least 270 baronetcies have been held for less than one year, together with another 40 possibles where the lack of accurate information regarding dates of succession and/or dates of death make it impossible to be totally accurate. The listing below shows those baronetcies held for less than one month.

James Bellingham, 2nd baronet [E 1620] Oct 1650 Oct 1650 William Alexander, 1st baronet [UK 1809] 11 Dec 1809 1809 The shortest period between the creation of a baronetcy and its subsequent extinction appears to be that of Sir John Wakefield Weston, who was created a baronet on 31 July 1926. The baronetcy became extinct 7 weeks later, on Sir John's death on 19 September 1926. The youngest age at which a person has been created a baronet is 2 years and 234 days in the case of Cornelis Speelman. A listing of those baronetcies created before the grantee reached age 10 is set out below. This listing is based upon known dates of birth, but there are many earlier baronets whose date of birth is unknown, and some of these may qualify for this listing had more accurate information been available.
