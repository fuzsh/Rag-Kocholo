It is also assumed that Richard Anderson, age 17, who immigrated the same year but on a different ship is this Richard's son, Richard Anderson.\n\nRichd Anderson, age 50, aboard the Merchant's Hope which left Gravesend on 31 July 1635.[1]\n\nRichard Anderson, age 17, aboard the Transport of London, 4 July 1635.[1]\n\nThere are two other Andersons who traveled to Virginia Colony in 1635 and whose names appear in this family. There is no evidence they were related.\n\nTho. Anderson, age 18, aboard the Bonaventure of London, on 2 January 1634/35.[1]\n\nRichard Anderson, age 30, aboard the Truelove of London, on 10 June 1635[1]\n\nMarriage & Children\n\nRichard Anderson married on 26 Dec 1611 in London, England to Elizabeth Hawkins.[2]Children attributed to this marriage, but unconfirmed:\n\nThomas Anderson\n\nRichard Anderson\n\nHenry Anderson\n\nJohn Anderson\n\nDeath & Legacy\n\nRichard passed away after 31 Jul 1635 in Jamestown, James City, Virginia.[3]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nUnsure who the following source is for because it names a different father and a different wife ... Complete Baronetage 1611-1880 by George Edward Cokayne & published in 5 volumes by W. Pollard of Exeter England during 1900-1906; citing FHL book#942 D22cg. v2 p211; m: Mary Spencer; only surviving son & heir for his father, Sir Henry Anderson, Knight, of London, Middlesex, England, who d: 13 Apr 1605; honors: Knighted; succeeded 03 Aug 1630 by his son, Sir Henry Anderson, Baronet.\n\nSources seem to be scarce for the early members of this family Virginia Colony. The first well-documented \"descendant\" of this Richard Anderson is Robert Anderson (1641-1712) of New Kent County, Virginia. There does not appear to be well-documented line of descent from this Richard to his son Richard, to grandson William, to great-grandson Robert Anderson (1641-1712) , of New Kent County. It would be helpful if the descendant linkages were doumented.
