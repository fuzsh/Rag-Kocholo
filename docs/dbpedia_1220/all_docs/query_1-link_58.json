        "text": "John Cam Hobhouse, Baron Broughton (born June 27, 1786, Redland, Gloucestershire, Eng.—died June 3, 1869, London) was a British politician and literary personage known as the alleged coiner of the phrase “His Majesty’s Opposition” (implying the continued loyalty of a major party when out of power) and as a close friend of Lord Byron. On his advice, Byron’s memoirs were destroyed (after the poet’s death in 1824) by their owner, the publisher John Murray.\n\nHobhouse and Byron, who had become acquainted at Trinity College, Cambridge, travelled together in Europe in 1809–10 and in 1816–17. In the 1820s he shared Byron’s enthusiasm for Greek independence from Ottoman Turkey. Imprisoned (1819–20) for his pamphlet attacking the unreformed House of Commons, he was then (1820) elected to that body. In 1825 he secured the prohibition of night labour by children in factories. After the enactment of major parliamentary reform in 1832, Hobhouse (2nd baronet from 1831) became increasingly conservative."
