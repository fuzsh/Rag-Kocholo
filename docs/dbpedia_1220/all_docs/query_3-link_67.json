        "text": "1502. Henry Kebyll. He gave £1,000 for the rebuilding of St. Mary's Aldermary Church, where he was afterwards buried, but 'his bones were unkindly cast up' (Stow, i., 253). Two later Lord Mayors, Sir William Laxton (1544–5) and Sir Thomas Lodge (1562–3) were buried in his vault. 1504. Sir William Fitzwilliam. Son-in-law of John Hawes (Alderman, Sheriff 1500–1). His grandson, Sir William Fitzwilliam, Lord Deputy of Ireland in the time of Queen Elizabeth, was ancestor of the Earls Fitzwilliam. His elder daughter Anne married Sir Anthony Cooke (descended from Sir Thomas Cook, Mayor 1462–3), and was mother-in-law of William Cecil, Lord Burghley, and grandmother of Francis Bacon. From the Alderman's younger daughter, Elizabeth, who married Sir Thomas Brudenell, the Earls of Cardigan were descended. 1505. William Browne (ii.). Son of Sir John Browne (Mayor 1480–1). He married the daughter of Sir Edmund Shaa (Mayor 1482–3) and afterwards the daughter of Henry Kebyll (Mayor 1510–1), the latter of whom upon his death became the third wife of Lord Mountjoy, and the ancestress of the Lord Mountjoy who subdued Tyrone's rebellion and was created Earl of Devonshire. Browne's daughter by his first wife married Sir John Mundy (Mayor 1522–3). His daughter by his second wife married Sir William Petre, Secretary of State to Edward VI. and Mary, from which marriage the Lords Petre are descended. 1506. Robert Johnson. He was removed by the King (Henry VII.) from the Shrievalty within a few days of his election to that office, and it is stated in the Greyfriars Chronicle that in consequence he 'toke soche a thowthe that he dyde.' If so, the result of his vexation was not speedy, as he did not die till nearly or fully twelve months later, his election being in September 1506, and the date of his Will September 23, 1507 (proved October 12 following). 1506. Christopher Hawes. He also, like his contemporary Johnson, appears to have been a singularly sensitive person, as he is stated to have been imprisoned by Henry VII. for some imaginary crime and to have 'soon died from excess of grief.' [Sir J. Baddeley, Aldermen of Cripplegate Ward, p. 42.] 1507. George Monoux. Founded a school at Walthamstow. 1507. Sir William Boteler. Son-in-law of Roger Basford (Alderman, Sheriff 1514). 1508.

Sir John Aleyn. One of the bachelor Aldermen who have held the Mayoralty. He gave a gold chain to be worn by successive Chief Magistrates, which was first worn by Sir William Laxton at the close of his Mayoralty, October 27, 1545. He is said to have been a member of Henry VIII.'s Privy Council. 1515. Sir Thomas Semer (Seymour). He is said to have been a member of the Protector Somerset's family, but I have failed to trace satisfactory evidence of the connexion which, in any case, was not very close. 1521. Sir John Rudstone. He married a daughter of Sir Robert Dymoke, Champion of England, who after his death married Sir Edward Wotton, one of Henry VIII.'s Privy Councillors.

Probably of the same family as Sir William Skeffington, Lord Deputy of Ireland, who was ancestor of the Viscounts Massereene. 1521. Sir Ralph Dodmer. See vol.

Stow records that he 'was the first private man who in his house near Clothworkers Hall built a turret to oversee his neighbours in the City, which delight of his eye was punished with blindness some years before his death.' Fuller (Worthies, iii., 108) comments on this dictum of Stow thus: ' I dare not concur with so censorious an author, because every consequence of a fact is not the punishment of a fault therein.' 1528. Sir William Hollyes. Ancestor of Denzil Holles, the parliamentarian Colonel, and of the Dukes of Newcastle of the Holles, Pelham and PelhamClinton lines. 1528. Sir Ralph Warren.

Richard Fermor. A zealous Romanist who in 1540 was imprisoned and deprived of his property for denying the supremacy of the King (Henry VIII.).

Sir Richard was elected Lord Mayor at the special desire of the King (Henry VIII.) when he had been an Alderman less than two years, twelve seniors below the Chair being passed over. 1536. Henry Amcotts. He refused to accept the office of Alderman until four months after his election, having in the interval been fined £40 and had his shops closed and his 'goodes and catalles' sequestered, and it was not until a week after he had been committed to Newgate that he finally surrendered. He retained his Aldermanry until his death, serving as Sheriff and Lord Mayor in due course. 1538. John Tolos. He also at first refused to accept office and was committed to Newgate, but was sworn nine days after his election, when the claim of his guild, that of the Clothworkers, to be regarded as one of the greater Companies was first admitted.

Wriothesley states that he was sworn previous to his discharge, which the entry in Repertory 11 (not ii. as printed vol. I., p. 11) omits, recording the discharge only. 1547. Sir William Garrarde. Father of Sir John Garrarde (Lord Mayor 1601–2) and father-in-law of Sir George Barne (Lord Mayor 1586–7).

Thomas Witherings. For his work at the Post Office see Hyde's Early History of the Post Office, chapters 1-6, where it is justly said of him (p. 214) that 'from the point of view of work done, he has some claim to be regarded as an early Rowland Hill: it was he who first organized the inland posts generally in Britain for the use of the public.' It is surprising that the Dictionary of National Biography has no notice of him. 1649. Mark Hildesley. Great-grandfather of Mark Hildesley, the successor of Bishop Wilson in the see of Sodor and Man. 1649. Francis Allen. One of the regicides. He is referred to in Rump Songs, i., 306, ('Upon Oliver dissolving the Parliament in 1653.')— 'Allen, the Coppersmith, was in great fear, He did much harm since the war began: A broken citizen many a year, And now he's a broken Parliament-man.' 1649.

(fn. 5) One of his daughters married the second Earl of Radnor of the Robartes line, and another Sir William Portman, Bart.

He was Lord Mayor at the time of the Restoration, which he took part in furthering, but he was not regarded as a whole-hearted royalist and he was one of the Aldermen superseded in 1683, when the Charter was suspended. The account of the Aldermen in 1672 (printed in The Gentleman's Magazine for 1769), says of him that 'the ill principles he had before that happie time, it is to be feared he retains still; in the late times he was no great enemy to the renouncing the familie of Stuarts.' 1653. Henry Hunter. Ancestor of Sir Claudius Hunter (Lord Mayor 1811–2). 1653. Sir William Thomson.

His two daughters married respectively Sir Nathaniel Herne (Alderman, Sheriff 1674–5), and Sir Joseph Herne (Alderman 1686–7). He was a strong supporter of the Restoration, but, like Sir Thomas Alleyn, was regarded as not a firm adherent of the Court and so was superseded with the Whig Aldermen in 1683. The MS. account of the Aldermen in 1672 says of him that 'by reason of his age, he is apt to be ledd by others, especially by Sir John Lawrence: he hates a souldier and cannot endure to see any of the King's guards.' 1653. Tempest Milner. Son-in-law of Richard Turner (Alderman 1652). He was one of the two Aldermen removed by the Commissioners for regulating the Corporation in 1662. 1653. Richard Turner.

Son of Archdeacon Robinson who was half-brother of Archbishop Laud and nephew of Sir William Webbe (Lord Mayor 1591–2). The MS. account of the Aldermen in 1672 says of him that 'he hath been most industrious in the civill government of the cittie, watchfull to prevent anything that might reflect any prejudice or dishonour upon the King's government, happy in dispatch of businesse, to the great contentment of the people.' Pepys writes very contemptuously of him as 'a talking bragging bufflehead . . . . as very a coxcomb as I would have thought had been in the City . . . . nor hath he brains to outwit any ordinary tradesman' (March 17, 1662-3): again, after recording 'a very great noble dinner' at which he (Pepys) was a guest during Robinson's Mayoralty, he adds 'this Mayor is good for nothing else' (October 20, 1663), and in another place he says of him that 'he makes it his work to praise himself, and all he says and do, like a heavy-headed coxcomb.' 1656. Sir John Lewys. A son-in-law of Sir T. Foot (Lord Mayor 1649–50): his elder daughter married the 7th Earl of Huntingdon and the younger the 3rd Earl of Scarsdale. 1656. Robert Burdett.

Well known for his bequests for the foundation of schools in Ireland. He was son-in-law of the first Lord Coleraine, and the marriage of his grand-daughter to Lord Strange, son of the 4th Earl of Derby, from which the later Earls are descended, brought the name of Smith into that family. 1657. Samuel Langham. Brother of Sir John Langham (Alderman, Sheriff 1642–3). 1657. Sir Anthony Bateman. Son of Robert Bateman, Chamberlain of the City and brother of Sir William, Richard and Sir Thomas (all elected Aldermen).

Though a member of the Grocers' Company, he was by trade a ropemaker in Wapping, 1657. Sir Martin Noell. Pepys describes him in his diary (September 5, 1662) as 'certainly a very useful man.' He was one of the victims of the Plague in 1665, his wife dying of grief very shortly afterwards. 1658. Sir John Lawrence. The leader of the party in opposition to the Court in civic affairs. The writer of the MS. account of the Aldermen in 1672, says that 'he hath put all the affronts and indignities imaginable upon all those persons that have been willing to venture their lives and estates in any military employment for His Majesty,' and that he 'hath always had three or four busie turbulent followers to crye him up in all parts of the cittie, and to assist him in all popular elections.' He goes on to say of Lawrence and of Sir William Turner, who had co-operated with him in favouring the Dissenters, that 'what they gained by their treacherous complieing with that party, that they have lost by their impious and insolent behaviour towards almost all persons they have had to doe with.' One daughter married Sir George Vyner, Bart., son of Sir Thomas Vyner (Lord Mayor 1653–4), and another Charles Chamberlain (Alderman 1687–8). 1658. Sir John Barkstead. One of the regicides. 1658. Francis Dashwood. He married a sister of Edmund Sleigh (Alderman, Sheriff 1654–5).

His daughter married successively Sir John Tyrell, 1st Bart. of Springfield and Sir Thomas Stampe (Lord Mayor 1691–2). 1658. Sir Thomas Bludworth. Lord Mayor at the time of the Great Fire of 1666. His daughter married Lord Jeffreys, James II.'s Chief Justice and Lord Chancellor, and was ancestress of the Earls of Pomfret. Pepys writes of him as 'a silly man, I think' (June 30, 1666) and 'a very weak man he seems to be' (December 1, 1666). The MS. account of the Aldermen of 1672 credits him with being 'a zealous person in the King's concernments; willing though it may be not very able, to doe great things.' In his funeral sermon by Dr. Scott it is said that 'he had a mighty affection and zeal for the King and for the Church of England.' 1659. William Love. One of the two Aldermen displaced by the Commissioners for regulating the Corporation in 1662, as having been 'faulty in the late troubles.' 1659. Sir William Bolton. He was accused of cheating the poor of the City out of the collections made for the sufferers by the Great Fire, to the extent of £1,800, 'of which he can give no account, and in which he hath forsworn himself plainly' (Pepys' Diary, December 3, 1667). He was in consequence forbidden to attend the Court of Aldermen pending inquiry and was ultimately constrained to resign his seat. He became very poor and was voted a pension of £3 per week by the Court of Common Council, March 19, 1677 (Journal 48, fo. 293), which was subsequently continued to his widow. See Dr. Sharpe's London and the Kingdom, ii, 432n. 1659. Sir William Peake. Father of Sir John Peake (Lord Mayor 1686–7). The MS. account of the Aldermen of 1672 describes him as 'dilligent in the publique affaires, resolute for the King's interest and for the antient and orderly Government of the cittie.' 1659. William Crow. He was an upholsterer with whom Pepys had considerable dealings. (See Diary, December 15, 16, 1668). Pepys records (December 1, 1663) how Lord Chief Justice Hyde in a trial in which Crow's name was mentioned, 'would not suffer Mr. Crow, who hath fined for Alderman to be called so, but only Mister, and did eight or nine times fret at it, and stop every man that called him so.' 1659. John Blackwell. Father of Sir Lawrence Blackwell, Bart. 1659. Sir William Wale. Father-in-law of Sir Edward Seymour, Bart., Speaker of the House of Commons and ancestor of the later Dukes of Somerset. 1660. Edward Backwell.

Sir William Turner. The MS. account of the Aldermen of 1672 says that he was 'esteemed zealous for the church untill the yeare of his Maioraltie; then he espouzed the interests of the Nonconformists'; it adds that towards the end of his year of office 'there were frequent consultations at his house with the heads of the Nonconformists about continuing him Lord Mayor another yeare.' He appears to have recovered favour with the Court party as he was not superseded with the Whig Aldermen in 1683. He was one of the few bachelor Lord Mayors. 1661. Sir Richard Ford. Pepys (Diary, March 17, 1663) describes him as 'a very able man of his brains and tongue, and a scholar,' but in a later entry (October 18, 1664) he records on the authority of a 'Mr. Gray' that 'among other faults, Sir Richard Ford cannot keep a secret.' The MS. account of the Aldermen in 1672 says that he is ' a man of excellent parts, and may doe his majestie excellent service in the citty,' but notes that he suspended the execution of the laws against Nonconformists when Lord Mayor, 'by which he gained the applause of all that partie.' 1661. Samuel Foote. First cousin of Sir Thomas Foot (Lord Mayor 1649–50). 1661. Sir Samuel Starling. His widow, daughter of Richard Garford (Alderman 1656), married the 4th Viscount Grandison. According to Pepys he was not liberal, as he records in his diary (September 8, 1666), during the progress of the fire, that 'Alderman Starling, a very rich man, without children, the fire at next door to him in our lane, after the men had saved his house, did give 2s. 6d. among thirty of them, and did quarrel with some that would remove the rubbish out of the way of the fire, saying that they came to steal.' As he 'put the law in execution vigorously against phanatics,' he is praised by the writer of the account of the Aldermen in 1672, who styles him 'a person of good learning, a solid judgment and great courage, contemning all danger for the safetie of his majestie's Government.' 1661. Thomas Turgis. He was one of the wealthiest commoners in England of his time, and proprietor of the pocket-borough of Gatton. 1661. Sir Henry Barnard.

Nephew of Bruno Ryves, Dean of Windsor. 1662. Sir Thomas Bateman. Youngest son of Robert Bateman, Chamberlain of the City, and brother of Sir Anthony Bateman (Lord Mayor 1663–4), and Sir William Bateman (Alderman 1657). He, with his brothers, suffered heavy loss through the Great Fire. 1662. Sir William Warren. He is very frequently mentioned in Pepys' Diary. He was a shipbuilder at Wapping.

Sir George Waterman. He is described in the MS. account of the Aldermen of 1672 (at which time he was Lord Mayor), as 'a person almost voide of understanding, but not of will. He is very weake in the one, but most perverse in the other. He employes abundance of tyme, but does no businesse. He for a while was guided by Sir John Lawrence who ledd him astray.' 1664. Charles Everard. One of the victims of the Great Plague of 1665. 1664. Sir Willam Hooker. Pepys writes of him during his Shrievalty (Diary, December 13, 1665), that he 'keeps the poorest, mean, dirty table in a dirty house that ever I did see any Sheriff of London, and a plain, ordinary, silly man I think he is, but rich.' The MS. account of the Aldermen of 1672 says 'that he is fallen off from the party of Sir John Lawrence and Sir William Turner; he saith, he sees their jugling, and will have noe more to do with them. He is bold, and apt to reflect upon the Court, if things crosse his humour.' He was one of the three Aldermen who retained their seats throughout the changes of the period from 1683 to 1688 (see ante p. 115). 1664. Stephen Frewen.

He lost over £400,000 by the closing of the Exchequer in January, 1672, and became bankrupt towards the end of the reign. He is frequently mentioned by Pepys. Grammont's story of his fetching back the King to drink another bottle at his Mayoral dinner is well known. The writer of the account of the Aldermen of 1672 (at which time he was Sheriff and 'contracted an extraordinary friendship' with his colleague, Sir Joseph Sheldon), says that he 'hath as large a soule, and hath done and did design as great and charitable acts in London, as any person, if the necessary shutting up of the Exchequer had not restrained him.' 1666. Robert Aske. He married the widow of Nicholas Bonfoy (Alderman 1664), and was the founder of a school at Hatcham. 1666. Peter Ducane.

The MS. account of the Aldermen of 1672, after recording his 'extraordinary friendship' with Sir Robert Vyner, asserts that 'the King hath noe two persons doe more passionately love his interest than these,' and that 'they are men of good abilities, and very sober and discreete in the management of businesse.' 1666. Sir John Moore. Originally a Nonconformist, he became the leader of the 'Church and King' party in the Court of Aldermen. The writer of the MS. account of the Aldermen of 1672 records that his election as Alderman in 1671, after he had been discharged on payment of a fine in 1667, was due to Sir John Lawrence and Sir William Turner, 'apprehending him a person fitt for their turne,' but that he behaved himself 'with great honestie and integretie, refusing to side with Sir John Lawrence 'for which the latter used 'reproachfull words' to him. For the events of his Mayoralty see Dr. Sharpe's London and the Kingdom, ii., 476–491. He was the Ziloah of Tate's portion of Absalom and Achitophel, who, when he ruled 'Jerusalem' [i.e., London] did 'boldly all seditious surges stem.' 1667. Richard Spencer. His widow married Sir John Stonhouse, Bart., and his daughter was the second wife of Lord Chancellor Harcourt. 1667. John Jermyn. Brother-in-law of John Hoby (Alderman 1666). 1667. Richard Beckford.

Sir Denis Gauden. Brother of John Gauden, Bishop of Winchester (the reputed author of Eikon Basilike). His official position in the Navy Office brought him much into contact with Pepys, in whose Diary his name is of frequent occurrence. The MS. account of the Aldermen of 1672 speaks of him as 'esteemed justly a man of great justnesse and uprightnesse in his place of government,' but adds that his official duties as Victualler of the Navy prevent his frequent attendance in the Court of Aldermen. 1667. William Sherrington. His daughter married Sir William Luckyn, Bart., and was mother of the 1st Viscount Grimston, and ancestress of the Earls of Verulam. 1667. George Clark. From his daughter's first husband, John Trevor (son of Sir John Trevor, Secretary of State), the Viscounts Hampden are descended. Her third husband was Lord Cutts, the 'salamander,' one of Marlborough's Generals at Blenheim. 1667. Sir Thomas Davies. 'The little fellow, my schoolfellow, the bookseller, who was one of Audley's executors and now become Sheriff; which is a strange turn, methinks' (Pepys' Diary, Oct. 23, 1667). His mother was niece of Hugh Audley, the wealthy usurer, from whom he and his brother inherited large fortunes. His niece, Mary Davies, by her marriage with Sir Thomas Grosvenor, 3rd Baronet of Eaton, brought into that family the great West-end Estate, from which the great wealth of her descendants, the Marquess and Dukes of Westminster, was derived. He was son-in-law of William Ridges (Alderman 1651). The MS. account of the Aldermen of 1672 says of him that 'hee knows as well how to keep as Audley knew how to get and keepe' his estate, and describes him as 'a meane spirited person . . . one that will venture as little as may be, either for the safety of the king, or service of the citie.' 1667. Francis Asty. Son-in-law of Ambrose Bronskill (Alderman 1657). 1668. John Forth. (fn. 7) Brother of Dannet Forth (Alderman, Sheriff 1670–1) and sonin-law of Sir Henry Vane, the Republican statesman. Tho MS. account of the Aldermen of 1672 describes him as 'a hasty, passionate person; noe lover of the Church of England . . . he rarely sees the inside of a church . . . he hath a consecrated chappell in his owne house . . . a nonconformist and a brewer officiating there, when he is at leisure on a Sunday to heare. He is a man of noe reputation for keeping his word.' 1668. Sir Francis Chaplin. Father of John Chaplin (ancestor of the Chaplins of Blankney, now represented by the Right Hon. Henry Chaplin) and of Sir Robert Chaplin, Bart. Pepys (Diary, January 22, 1668) describes him as 'a pretty humoured little man, and the MS. account of the Aldermen of 1672 speaks of him as 'a person truly loyall' and 'active in businesse, but too quick and open sometimes in declaring his opinion.' 1668. Sir Richard Howe. Father-in-law of Sir Michael Hicks and ancestor of Viscount St. Aldwyn. 1668. John Lane. Father of Sir Thomas Lane (Lord Mayor 1694–5). His daughter married Paul Foley (Speaker of the House of Commons), from which marriage descended the Lords Foley of the present creation. 1668. William Bainbrigg.

A leading Nonconformist and friend of Richard Baxter, who preached his funeral sermon. Father of Sir William Ashhurst (Lord Mayor 1693–4) and of Sir Henry Ashhurst (Alderman 1688–9). 1668. Sir John Smith. Son of James Smith (Alderman 1650) and father of Sir John Smith, Bart., of Isleworth. The MS. account of the Aldermen of 1672 describes him as 'an honest good-natured person, desireing to serve his majestie to his utmost and ready to oblige any of the King's friends. He is willing to receive good advice . . . and able to distinguish betweene good and bad.' 1668. Benjamin Albin. Son-in-law of John Mayo (Alderman 1650–3). 1669. John Colvill. A goldsmith who lost over £85,000 by the shutting up of the Exchequer in 1672. Pepys did business with him and frequently mentions him in his Diary, in one place (May 24, 1665) characterizing him as 'an impertinent fool.' 1669. Sir James Edwards. He is described in the MS. account of the Aldermen of 1672 as 'a bold stoute man, furnished with honest loyall principles, a man of good understanding and as good a resolution: he is like to prove a very usefull person in the cittie, especially if he would but come and live there.' 1669. Dannet Forth. Brother of John Forth (Alderman, Sheriff 1668–9). He was originally a member of the Drapers' Company, and was translated to the Brewers January 15, 1661 [Rep. 67, fo. 183b], thus exchanging one of the 12 greater Companies for one of the minor ones, of which there are few instances recorded. His daughter married Francis St. John, son of Oliver St. John, the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth period, and was mother of Sir Francis St. John, Bart., and ancestress of the later Dukes of Manchester. In the MS. account of the Aldermen of 1672 he is described as 'a person that hath much more command of his passion than his brother, and a man of greater abilities in busynesse, but as to church affaires, of the same principles with his brother.' 1669. William Fluellin. His daughter was mother of Sir Thomas Colby, Bart. 1669. Sir Jonathan Dawes. His daughter married Sir Martin Lumley, 3rd Bart., great grandson of Sir Martin Lumley (Lord Mayor 1623-4). The writer of the MS. account of the Aldermen of 1672, after noticing his friendship with his brother-Sheriff, Sir Robert Clayton, says that they 'industriously endeavour to serve his majestie and the cittie. They want no courage, nor conduct in any businesse they undertake; they have a greate share of love and estieme from people of all sorts.' 1670. Sir Robert Clayton. He was partner in business as a scrivener with John Morris (Alderman 1669), whose property he inherited. His nephew and heir, William Clayton, was created a Baronet, and was ancestor of the Clayton Baronets of Morden and the Clayton-East Baronets of Hall Place. The writer of the laudatory remarks on him and Sir J. Dawes, quoted above, did not foresee that he would later be one of the Whig leaders both in the City and in Parliament. In the portion of Absalom and Achitophel written by Tate, he is described as 'Extorting Ishban,' in reference to his having amassed a fortune by usury, and\n\n'Ishban of conscience suited to his trade, As good a saint as usurer ever made,'\n\nand some succeeding lines accuse him of having offered 'talents of extorted gold' and to 'turn loyal' in return for a peerage, which was refused him. 1670. Sir Patience Ward. It is said that he was so christened because his father was disappointed in the sex of his child, having desired a daughter. He was one of the leaders of the Whig party in the City, and it was during his Mayoralty that the inscription was placed on the Monument ascribing the Great Fire to the Roman Catholics. The MS. account of the Aldermen of 1672 says that 'he hath had a wife many years, but whether they were ever married is a question, unless it were according to the directory of the quakers.' His wife was daughter of William Hobson (Aldorman 1657). He was uncle of Sir John Ward (Lord Mayor 1718-9). He was convicted of perjury in his evidence at the trial of the action of the Duke of York against Sir Thomas Pilkington, and fled to Holland 1683, where he remained till the Revolution. 1672. Sir William Prichard. One of the leaders of the civic Tories. He obtained a verdict for £10,000 damages in 1684 against Thomas Papillon (Alderman 1689) for illegal arrest in connexion with the disputes arising out of the election for Sheriff in 1682. 1673. Sir Henry Tulse. His daughter, who married the first Lord Onslow, drowned herself in a pond in the Archbishop of Canterbury's palace at Croydon. 1674. Sir James Smyth.

Grandson of Richard Herne (Alderman, Sheriff 1618-9), half-brother of Nicholas Herne (Alderman 1657), and son-in-law of Sir John Frederick (Lord Mayor 1661-2). His grand-daughter married the second Earl of Jersey, and was mother of the first Earl of Clarendon of the present creation. 1676. Sir John Lethuillier. Son-in-law of Sir William Hooker (Lord Mayor 1673-4) and brother of Sir Christopher Lethuillier (Alderman, Sheriff 1689-90). Pepys (Diary, December 13, 1665) describes him as 'a pretty, civil, understanding merchant,' and his wife as 'our noble, fat, brave lady in our parish that I and my wife admire so,' and (December 3) as 'my fat brown beauty, a very noble woman.' 1676. Sir Robert Geffery. Founder of the almshouses which are known by his name, for the establishment of which he bequeathed money in trust to his Company, the Ironmongers. 1676. Sir John Shorter. A Nonconformist, described by Evelyn (Diary I., 643) as 'an Anabaptist, a very odd ignorant person, a mechanic, I think.' He was one of the Aldermen superseded when the Charter was suspended in 1683, but was restored by James II. when that monarch was courting the Dissenters in 1687, and made Lord Mayor, with permission to have whom he pleased as his chaplain. For the accident which caused his death see Sir J. Baddeley's Aldermen of Cripplegate Ward, p. 80. His grand-daughter married Sir Robert Walpole, and was mother of Horace Walpole. 1676. Sir Thomas Gold. His grand-daughter married the 2nd Lord Barnard and was mother of the 1st Earl of Darlington and ancestress of the Dukes of Cleveland.

See Wilford's Memorials, pp. 507, 508. He was father of Sir William Chapman, Bart. 1680. Henry Cornish. This barbarous person, whose execution for treason on insufficient evidence in James II.'s reign has given occasion to Whig historians to glorify him with the halo of martyrdom, was one of the two Sheriffs who protested against the remission of the vivisection portion of the sentence on the aged Viscount Stafford, the victim of Oates' perjury, whose only offence was his adhesion to the Romanist faith, in which protest he was supported by the immaculate William, Lord Russell! 1680. Sir Thomas Pilkington. One of the most prominent leaders of the Whigs in the City during the troubles of the later years of Charles II. The Duke of York obtained a verdict for £50,000 damages against him in 1682 for scandalum magnatum, and in default of payment he was imprisoned till 1686. Burnet writes of him as 'an honest but indiscreet man that gave himself great liberties in discourse.' 1681. Sir Jonathan Raymond. Son-in-law of Philip Jemmett (Alderman 1667). Le Neve (Pedigrees of Knights, p. 333) says that he was 'a very weak silly man but gott a great estate' (by his marriage). He was one of the few Tories in the Court of Aldermen in William III.'s reign, and his resignation of the Aldermanry was said to be due to vexation at having been passed over for the Mayoralty: he had been defeated at the poll in 1689, 1691, 1692, and 1693, and though one of the two returned in 1690 was not elected. 1682. Dudley North. 4th son of the 4th Lord North, and brother of the 1st Earl of Guilford (Lord Chancellor) and of Roger North (author of the Examen and of Lives of the Norths).
