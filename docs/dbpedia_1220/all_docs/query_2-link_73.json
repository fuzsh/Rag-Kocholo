        "text": "Bibliography\n\nThe following is a selective list of biographies, chronicles, documentary collections, articles and bibliographical guides descriptive of the career and background of Sir Francis Drake, or relevant to the records of his voyages. It includes all works mentioned in the historical introduction by David W. Waters and Richard Boulind, or cited in the references to it; and it sets out those works which have been found most useful and reliable in compiling the pictorial biography of Drake and in assessing pieces in the H. P. Kraus Collection of material relating to Sir Francis Drake, as described in \"The Catalogue of the Collection\" (pp. 181-222). Some of the contemporary works entered in this bibliography are themselves items in the H. P. Kraus Collection; where this is the case, the figures in square brackets following the entry refer to the item's number in the Catalogue, where a full description will be found.\n\nIn this bibliography annotation has been avoided wherever possible. Remarks have been limited to those considered essential to keep an informed reader from error or waste of time; for instance, the authors of the main original accounts of Drake's voyages are entered individually, and the reader is referred to the publication of the account. Although editions published by academic libraries and learned societies are noted as such throughout, a continuous attempt has been made to assign all entries either to an author or to an editor: to the author in the case of nearly all works published or prepared for publication, at whatever date; to the editor in the case of entries for works consisting of drafts, printed correspondence or miscellaneous writings. The form of abbreviation used in the short citations of references in the historical introduction is appended to this bibliographical entry where there seemed to be any possibility of confusion.\n\nMuch further progress with the study of Drake, his contemporaries and his background could be made by using the various works of reference and the standard authorities set out in this list. Many of them contain critical notes on the literature of the subject. The standard bibliographies upon the history of the period and its principal personalities are, for Spain and Spanish America: B. Sánchez Alonso, Fuentes de la historia española e hispano-americana , revised edition (3 vols., Madrid, 1952); and for England: the similarly revised edition of Conyers Read listed below. The latter includes a list of works on Drake among its sections relating to individual seamen. Contemporary works on geography and exploration are listed and dated by E. G. R. Taylor in her Tudor geography , pp. 162-90 and in her sequel to it, Late Tudor and early Stuart geography, 1583-1650 (London, 1934), pp. 177-298. Works on navigation, cosmography and pilotage in the corresponding period are listed and analyzed, with full bibliographical citations, by David W. Waters in the notes and bibliography of his Art of Navigation (listed below). The general reference guide to works on contemporary military history and theory is Maurice J. D. Cockle: A Bibliography of Military Books up to 1642 (London, 1900; reprinted 1957), while those relevant to Sir Francis Drake's training and experience have received an extensive critical listing in the bibliography of English military books of the period added by David W. Waters to his edition of Thomas Greepe's The true and perfecte newes...of Syr Frauncis Drake (listed below).\n\nIn one volume it is impossible to cover every single aspect of a career as far-ranging and illustrious as Sir Francis Drake's. References to material on particular aspects of Drake's life and deeds not intensively studied here may be found in the standard works, especially two: Sir Julian Corbett's Drake and the Tudor navy (1898), and Henry R. Wagner's Sir Francis Drake's voyage around the world (1926). The definitive impress that they left upon Drake studies, and the significance of fresh contributions since they wrote have been summed up by W. J. Harte in \"Some recent views\n\nof Drake's voyage around the world,\" in: History , XX (1936), pp. 348-53. Dr. James A. Williamson in 1928 contributed a valuable critical discussion of the literature on Drake: \"Books on Drake,\" in: History , XII, pp. 310-21, while there is an enlightening bibliography of 100 books on Sir Francis Drake by Eleanor Bancroft in the California Historical Society's special publications nos. 13 and 25 (1937 and 1953).\n\nAmherst of Hackney, Lord, and Basil Thomson (eds.), The Discovery of the Solomon Islands by Alvaro de Mendaña in 1568 (Hakluyt Society Sec Series, nos. 1 & 2, 2. vols., London, 1901).\n\n[Anderson, George William], \"A New, Authentic and complete Account of a Voyage round the World, undertaken and performed by Sir Francis Drake in the 'Pelican',\" in his edition of Captain Cook's Voyages ...

There is strong bibliographical evidence to show that the majority of known copies of the 1589 Hakluyt contain \"The Famous Voyage\" in this position and that it may even have been issued with the remainder of the text when the volume was actually published, in January or February 1590. This case for the date of 1589 or 1590 for \"The Famous Voyage\" is set out by Willis Holmes Kerr, \"The Treatment of Drake's Circumnavigation in Hakluyt's 'Voyages,' 1589,\" in: Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , XXXIV (1940), pp. 281-302. In any case, a comparison of the content of printed texts shows that works in part based upon \"The Famous Voyage\" appeared as early as 1592. A facsimile of this edition, edited by D. B. Quinn and R. A. Skelton, with a new index by Alison Quinn was published, in 2 volumes, by the Hakluyt Society (London, 1965).]\n\n--, The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the English Nation, made by Sea or over-land, to the remote and farthest distant quarters of the Earth, at any time within the compasse of these 1500. yeeres ...
