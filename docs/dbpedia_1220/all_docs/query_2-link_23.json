        "text": "Sir Charles Anderson, 9th Baronet of Broughton in Lincolnshire, was the only surviving son of the Rev. Sir Charles John Anderson, 8th Baronet, Prebendary of Thorngate in the Cathedral of Lincoln, and Frances Mary, second daughter of Sir John Nelthorpe, 6th Bart of Scawby in Lincolnshire. He was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, where he matriculated 28 February 1823, taking his B.A. in 1826, and his M.A. in 1829. He married, 11 September 1832, Emma, youngest daughter of John Savile Foljambe Esq of Aldwarke in Yorkshire. In 1846 he succeeded to the baronetcy and became Sheriff of Lincolnshire. Sir Charles was interested in local history, particularly that of Lincolnshire, and wrote a number of books, including A short guide to the County of Lincoln (1847), An eight weeks' journal in Norway, &c.. (1853), and a novel The Swedish brothers: a tale (1845). His three sons predeceased him, the eldest and the youngest without issue. The second son, Francis Foljambe Anderson, left three daughters, of whom the eldest, Margaret Louise, married William Arthur Duncombe, and the second, Katherine Helen, married Richard Coningsby Sutton."
