Immigration to Virginia, 1635

It is generally assumed that Richard Anderson, age 50, who immigrated to the Virginia Colony in 1635 was this Richard Anderson. It is also assumed that Richard Anderson, age 17, who immigrated the same year but on a different ship is this Richard's son, Richard Anderson.

Richd Anderson, age 50, aboard the Merchant's Hope which left Gravesend on 31 July 1635.[1]

Richard Anderson, age 17, aboard the Transport of London, 4 July 1635.[1]

There are two other Andersons who traveled to Virginia Colony in 1635 and whose names appear in this family. There is no evidence they were related.

Tho. Anderson, age 18, aboard the Bonaventure of London, on 2 January 1634/35.[1]

Research Notes

Unsure who the following source is for because it names a different father and a different wife ... Complete Baronetage 1611-1880 by George Edward Cokayne & published in 5 volumes by W. Pollard of Exeter England during 1900-1906; citing FHL book#942 D22cg. v2 p211; m: Mary Spencer; only surviving son & heir for his father, Sir Henry Anderson, Knight, of London, Middlesex, England, who d: 13 Apr 1605; honors: Knighted; succeeded 03 Aug 1630 by his son, Sir Henry Anderson, Baronet.

Sources seem to be scarce for the early members of this family Virginia Colony. The first well-documented "descendant" of this Richard Anderson is Robert Anderson (1641-1712) of New Kent County, Virginia. There does not appear to be well-documented line of descent from this Richard to his son Richard, to grandson William, to great-grandson Robert Anderson (1641-1712) , of New Kent County. It would be helpful if the descendant linkages were doumented. (Strutton-11 18:14, 31 January 2023 (UTC))
