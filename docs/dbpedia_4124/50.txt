History

Immaculate Conception College was founded in 1944 by the former Catholic Bishop of Benin-City, Bishop Patrick J. Kelly, and Rev. Andrew O' Rouke, SMA was its first Principal. The school was started with only 30 students and it became an official Secondary School in 1954. In 1966, it admitted its first Higher School Certificate students.

In 1972, the State Government took over all private and missionary schools, which they did not build, and made them public schools. The first principal at this time was Mr. R. O. Asenimen, who was followed by Mr. Joseph Itotoh in 1975. The school gradually increased its student population to about 8,000 with four principals, and four schools on the same premises. This accounted for what was the worst time in the school's history due to a decline in morals, behavior, and value in education. There were about 100 students to a class, high rates of vandalism, and no renovation or maintenance whatsoever. The Edo State Government by 2004 had no choice but to return all acquired schools to their original owners because the students, teachers, laboratory equipments, class furniture and materials, along with school trophies and yearly financial allocation for renovation and maintenance were moved to other schools, which are now privately owned, or to other unknown locations. The first principal in this period was Rev. Dr. I. P. Ebeigbe who was later replaced by Rev. Dr. C. I. Ofoegbu in 2005.Thanks to the Archbishop Rev Dr. P. E. Ekpu for providing the funds needed for furniture for the classrooms, beds for the hostels, and renovation of the buildings. The school currently has over 500 students.
