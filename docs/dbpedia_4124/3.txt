<strong>Oldenburg</strong> <strong>Academy</strong> Up of the Immaculate Conception opportunities await... every student, every day! Close Letter from the President Back in 1854 Fr. Rudolf served as the district superintendent of schools and examined potential teachers. Along with Fr. Rudolf, Sr. Antonia was a strong and strict disciplinarian and training was strenuous. The school year was always brought to a close with a public examination. The exam was a test of physical endurance as well as intellectual. The three hour ordeal from nine to twelve in the morning was only a beginning; it continued from one to five in the afternoon. Then, beginning at seven o’clock in the evening the Exhibition – a program of plays, songs, and instrumental numbers. Within 14 years enrollment had reached one hundred and seventeen students. Soon in 1898 an alumnae association was formed. The graduates engaged in various fields of endeavor and some with our convent school. It was all so exciting. The school grew and grew. The educational program expanded its offerings always staying true to the fine arts. By 1916 the <strong>Academy</strong> had nearly 200 students. In 1927 the <strong>Academy</strong> was first accredited by the Indiana State Board of Education. The largest enrollment in our history was in 1954 with a growth spurt of 423. A limit was set in place for freshman registration. Oh, if these walls could talk. You might hear students preparing for prom, others practicing their lines for a play, then another group completing hard in sports. Then there would be the day to day events of what was happening on the weekends or what interesting fellow climbed the walls to visit his sweet heart. In the mid 60s life was a buzz with day students, residents and what was known as aspirants – those thinking of being sisters. In the early 80s the residency program experienced change as the day students began to outnumber the residents. Secondly, the Sisters could no longer cover the financial obligations of the school resulting in the <strong>Academy</strong> becoming incorporated in 1994. It was then that the <strong>Academy</strong> came under the leadership of the Board of Directors and today known as the Board of Trustees. (continued on pg. 2) Welcome to the <strong>2012</strong>-2013 school year! It is with great excitement that we launch our 160th year of providing Catholic education here in southeastern Indiana. Now just imagine what it must have been like in 1844 when Mother Theresa Hackelmeier ventured to Indiana from Vienna, Austria. It was then that Fr. Francis Rudolf had a dream to found a religious community of Sisters to teach the children of German immigrants. At age twenty-four Mother Theresa packed her trunk and traveled alone to <strong>Oldenburg</strong>, Indiana. The trip across the ocean was long and arduous. It was a cold bitter day when she finally arrived in <strong>Oldenburg</strong> on January 6th in 1851. Three other women joined Mother Theresa and by the end of 1852 they had established a boarding school for six students. Soon Antonia Dreer from Rorschach, Switzerland, joined the small community. Sr. Antonia was a young woman of superior education who came to the United States to educate youth. Besides being a talented administrator she also taught music. Thus began the Fine Arts program at the <strong>Academy</strong>. 160 YEARS AGUGST <strong>2012</strong>
