Oldenburg Academy has been educating and empowering students since 1852

As a co-educational, independent, private school, we are the second largest employer in the town of Oldenburg and recognized as a key contributor to local culture and sustainability. Our campus sits on approximately four acres, surrounded by the Motherhouse of the Sisters of St. Francis. The grounds are beautifully maintained and are frequently utilized by area residents for walking and recreation. The campus has a very collegiate feel as students move from building to building several times throughout the day.

Academic and Auditorium Buildings

The main Academic and Auditorium buildings are air-conditioned and were built in 1967. These buildings have been extensively renovated over the past decade. This includes collaborative, modular furniture in all classrooms, large televisions for projection, refinishing of the historic gym, a student lounge with a student run coffee shop, and highlighted with school branded colors and student designed and installed murals.

ICA Hall

ICA Hall is a wing of the Sisters of St. Francis historic Motherhouse built in 1900 and is currently the location for Art classes, the cafeteria, and the Advancement, Finance, and Communications Offices. Mass is also held in the Sistersâ€™ beautiful Chapel while class prayer is often held in the Oratory.

Hillenbrand Family Feldhaus

The Hillenbrand Family Feldhaus on the southeast corner of the campus was completed in the summer of 2020. It serves as our main athletic facility for all volleyball and basketball games, contains a fully outfitted strength and conditioning space on the mezzanine, and is a multipurpose facility for many large group OA and community events. The lobby and concession stand are spacious and serve as a welcoming and gathering area. It memorializes the legacy of Academy co-curriculars with historicizing murals and the Ammann-Brinkmoeller Athletic Hall of Fame display.
