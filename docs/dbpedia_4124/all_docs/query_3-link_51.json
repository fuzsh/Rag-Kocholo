        "text": "Catholic university in Indianapolis, Indiana, US\n\nFor the Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, school of the same name, see Marian University (Wisconsin).\n\nMarian University is a private Roman Catholic university in Indianapolis, Indiana. Founded in 1851 by the Sisters of St. Francis in Oldenburg, Indiana, the college moved to Indianapolis in 1937. Marian was known as Marian College from 1936 until 2009, when it was renamed Marian University.[4]\n\nIn 2013, the university opened the first medical school in over 100 years in Indiana, which was the first osteopathic medical school in the state and the second operational medical school in Indiana at the time.[5] As of 2017, enrollment included 2,431 undergraduate students, 1,164 graduate students, and 650 doctoral students.[6]\n\nMarian University athletes have won 45 USA Cycling National Championships and 8 NAIA National Championships: Football in 2012 and 2015; Women's Basketball in 2016 and 2017; Men's Track and Field 60-meter hurdles in 2016 and 2017, and 110-meter hurdles and 800 meter in 2017.[7] Their mascot is Knightro the Knight.[8]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMarian University was founded in 1851 by the Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Indiana, as a liberal arts school with a program for training teachers. Under the direction of Father Francis Joseph Rudolph and Mother Theresa Hackelmeier, teachers were trained at Oldenburg for more than a decade before Indiana adopted its first tax-supported normal school.\n\nOriginally known as St. Francis Normal, the school became a four-year, state-approved institution which merged with Immaculate Conception Junior College to form Marian College. In November 1936, the Sisters of St. Francis purchased the former James A. Allison estate, \"Riverdale,\" located in Indianapolis, as a site for Marian College.\n\nIn 1937, the institution moved to Indianapolis under the direction of Mother M. Clarissa Dillhoff, after securing a state charter and purchasing the Riverdale estate in 1936. Allison Mansion became the new location of Marian College. The building housed the library, administrative offices, classrooms, and sleeping quarters for the Sisters. Classes began on September 15, 1937.\n\nIn 1948 the institution began an expansion project that included the addition of Clare Hall, the Gymnasium, and Marian Hall. In 1954, as the new Marian Hall was completed, the institution became the first co-educational Catholic college in Indiana. Two years later, the North Central Association accredited Marian College.\n\nThe university's Modernist-style library was designed by noted Indianapolis architect Evans Woollen III, the principal and founder of Woollen, Molzan and Partners, and completed in 1966. The library's square form has an exposed structural frame and open staircase with stacks arranged around reading areas.[9]\n\nThe National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education formally accepted all teacher education programs of the college in 1976. The Indiana State Board of Nursing approved the associate level nursing curriculum in 1977 and the baccalaureate program in 1987. The National League of Nursing has accredited both programs—the associate in 1986 and the baccalaureate in 1992. In 2000, Marian's Adult Programs (MAP) began offering bachelor's and associate degrees in business.\n\nOn July 1, 2009, Marian College became Marian University.[4] Over the course of several years prior to this, the college grew and expanded the academic curriculum, added a football team and marching band, adding and renovating buildings.[4]\n\nOn January 15, 2010, Marian University announced plans to begin a college of osteopathic medicine; the second in the state of Indiana and the first Catholic osteopathic medical school[10] due to the generosity of an anonymous donor's $30 million pledge. On August 23, 2011, during the groundbreaking ceremony, the new school of osteopathic medicine building was officially named after the erstwhile anonymous donor, AIT Labs CEO Michael A. Evans.[11] Additionally, Margaret Mary Community Hospital pledged $150,000 to the College of Osteopathic Medicine dedicated to building a simulation lab and seminar room for the medical students.[10]\n\nIn July 2021, Ancilla College and Marian officially merged and opened as the Marian University's Ancilla College in Donaldson, Indiana.[12]\n\nCampus\n\n[edit]\n\nMarian University is located about four miles northwest of downtown Indianapolis, on a 200-acre campus.[2] The Marian University campus includes:\n\nThe Nina Mason Pulliam EcoLab, a 55-acre wetland and lowland forest located on the north end of the Marian University campus.[13]\n\nThe Riverdale Estate, which includes Allison Mansion and Indiana's largest and most intact landscape designed by Jens Jensen. The mansion holds the offices of the president.\n\nThe Lake Sullivan Sports Complex, now known as the Indy Cycloplex, which Marian operates for the City of Indianapolis Parks and Recreation Department. This park is home to the Major Taylor Velodrome and Indy Cycloplex BMX track, as well as singletrack MTB trails and a dual slalom course, and hosts races, clinics, and other events in all cycling disciplines, as well as community events.[14]\n\nAcademics\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2017, Marian University served 2,431 undergraduate students, 1,164 graduate students, and 650 medical students with a student-faculty ratio of 14:1.[6] Marian University is accredited by North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.[15]\n\nMarian University is organized into five schools with 40 majors, 46 minors, and 26 concentrations:[6]\n\nClark H. Byrum School of Business[16]\n\nCollege of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nCollege of Arts and Sciences[17]\n\nThe Educators College[18]\n\nAlan and Sue Leighton School of Nursing[19]\n\nMarian University offers several routes to earning a teaching license via Indianapolis Teaching Fellows, traditional education program, Master's Bridge to Teaching, the Master of Arts in Teaching program, and the ACTION program. Marian University is one of the few universities to offer the Leadership Academy for Principals.\n\nMarian University Leighton School of Nursing offers several degree programs including an online Accelerated BSN program that can be completed in as few as 16 months.[20]\n\nMarian University College of Osteopathic Medicine opened in August 2013 with the first-class graduated 133 doctors of osteopathic medicine.[21][5] The university also offers accelerated degree programs in business for adults through Marian's Adult Programs (MAP). [1]\n\nOn the Ancilla College campus, seven degree programs are offered as of Spring of 2021. These include a Bachelor's in Nursing as well as Associate's in Agriculture, Business, Education, Exercise Science, Liberal Arts, and Veterinary Nursing.[12]\n\nStudent life\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Student Government Association of Marian University (SGA) is actively involved with campus events such as homecoming and the fall festival. Intramural sports are popular, especially basketball, flag football, and ultimate frisbee. The speech team competes regularly; Audra Casterline, a member of the speech team was named Miss Indiana in 2014.[citation needed]\n\nThere are nearly 30 student run clubs and organizations at Marian University.[22]\n\nAdjacent to campus, though not located on campus property, is Bishop Simon Bruté College Seminary, a college seminary for Catholic seminarians, operated by the Archdiocese of Indianapolis. Approximately 20-30 young men, who are also Marian students, live at the seminary and receive formation there.[23]\n\nAthletics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Marian athletic teams are called the Knights. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Crossroads League (formerly known as the Mid-Central College Conference (MCCC) until after the 2011–12 school year) for most of its sports since the 1987–88 academic year; while its football team competes in the Mideast League of the Mid-States Football Association (MSFA).\n\nMarian competes in 24 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men's sports include baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, football, golf, rugby, soccer, tennis, track & field and wrestling; while women's sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track & field and volleyball; and co-ed sports include cycling, cheerleading and dance.\n\nConference sports Sport Men's Women's Co-ed Baseball Y Basketball Y Y Bowling Y Y Cheerleading Y Cross country Y Y Cycling Y Dance Y Football Y Golf Y Y Lacrosse Y Rugby Y Soccer Y Y Softball Y Tennis Y Y Track and field Y Y Volleyball Y Wrestling Y\n\nThe university's mascot is Knightro, the Knight.\n\nMarian began a football program in 2007 under head coach Ted Karras Jr. Since then, the Knights have won two NAIA national championships. In 2012, in only their sixth year of play, the Knights won their first NAIA football championship.[24] In 2014, the #7 Marian Knights became the NAIA runner-up after losing to #8 Southern Oregon University 55–31.[25] The next year, the Knights won the NAIA championship, a rematch of the 2014 national championship against the SOU Raiders, 31–14. This marked their third championship game appearance and second victory in four years. The head coach for that victory was Mark Henninger.[26] Several football program alumni have earned contracts at the professional level, such as Krishawn Hogan[27] and Julian Williams.[28]\n\nMen's basketball\n\n[edit]\n\nThe men's basketball program, established for the 1954–1955 season, claims to be the oldest intercollegiate athletic team at Marian.\n\nCycling\n\n[edit]\n\nMarian University is nationally known[29] for its cycling team, which practices and competes at the Indy Cycloplex, home of the Major Taylor Velodrome. The cycling team is a Division I varsity team underneath the collegiate cycling umbrella of USA Cycling.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Indiana College Mathematics Competition\n\nIndianapolis Art Center provides educational programming for Marian University\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
