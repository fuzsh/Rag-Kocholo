Among them were also included Frank C. Ball and his brothers, who were industrialists and had just moved to the city from New York. Being industrialists, they quickly knew that the city needed development and that what was needed for it. Its roots date back to 1899 as a teacher training institute which was closed and the campus was bought by the Ball brothers. It was then donated to the state and began as a teacher training institute in 1918.\n\nThe institute quickly grew into Ball State University and made tremendous progress in its academics. It is now recognized for its entrepreneurial spirit, state of the art facilities and fast paced research activities. Technological development and advancement sit at the foundation however with the only object of community development and within ethical bounds.\n\nLife at BSU is unique and is not without interesting traditions.

It was Daniel Brenneman, founder of Mennonite Brethren in Christ (MBC) who first talked about setting up an institute. Another voice that joined him was of J. A. Huffman who also insisted on having a Christian higher education institute and with this the approval from the church for an institute came in 1944. With the land purchased, the college began three years later. It was named ‘Bethel’ meaning “house of God”, a name suggested by Huffman.\n\nBeing a Christian college and with exceptional leadership since its beginning, the college is affiliated with the Missionary Church. But being a present day higher education institute it has also worked to expand academically and has been the driving force behind the successes of many of its students. Its students are prepared to think critically to best meet the challenges ahead.\n\nLife at Bethel College has evolved through connection with God and spirituality and connection with each other. It begins with Chapel Services which every full time student is required to attend. This is complemented with biblical study in groups and with charity programs. There is also Discipleship program which serves as further guidance for students looking for a deeper spiritual connection. For further engagement, there are cross cultural programs which are assisted through summer and exchange programs where students are exposed to global differences. There are theatre and musical performances which serve both as entertainment as well as service to God. Students also participate in various fun activities which are solely intended at bringing students together such as Midnight Breakfast, Back-to-school party, Battle of the bands/film festival and few others. Life at Bethel is not without athletics, which participate at the NAIA and NCAA, winning 35 National Championships.\n\nThe academic programs at the college cover more than 50 areas of study including undergraduate, graduate and adult degree programs.
