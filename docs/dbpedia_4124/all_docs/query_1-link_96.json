        "text": "COCONUT CREEK, Fla. (Oct. 8, 2018) Food For The Poor is responding to the devastation caused by Saturday’s deadly 5.9-magnitude earthquake near Port-de-Paix, Haiti.\n\nThe death toll in the northwest part of the country stands at 12, according to published reports, with fears it could rise.\n\nFood For The Poor’s headquarters in Florida is airfreighting 10 pallets of kerosene stoves, canned sausages, blankets, flashlights with batteries, and personal hygiene items, and eight pallets of tarps to the charity’s offices in Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haitien. Additional kerosene stoves shipped to Haiti prior to the earthquake also are being directed to the relief effort.\n\n“Our hearts are heavy for the people of Haiti who are still recovering from the 2010 earthquake,” said Food For Poor President/CEO Robin Mahfood. “We are sending these relief supplies which will be distributed to churches and local leaders in the affected communities so they can help the people recover as quickly as possible.”\n\nFood For The Poor-Haiti has sent five truckloads of food, medicines and hygiene items from Port-au-Prince and two from Cap-Haitien to the three emergency centers in northwest Haiti. One truckload of medicines also was shipped to the Alma Mater Hospital of the Catholic Church in Gros-Morne, the Bereca Hospital of the Evangelical Baptist Union of Haiti in Pointe de Palmistes and the Immaculate Conception Hospital in Port-de-Paix.\n\nBecause of the aftershocks, many people are afraid to return to their homes and are living in the streets, said Bishop Oge Beauvoir, Executive Director of Food For The Poor-Haiti.\n\n“A lot of families have lost their homes and it has been raining in the area for the last two days,” he said. “Many school buildings and churches collapsed. We are very thankful for the support of Food For The Poor’s donors. People are desperate. Please hold them in your prayers.”\n\nFood For The Poor, one of the largest international relief and development organizations in the nation, does much more than feed millions of the hungry poor primarily in 17 countries of the Caribbean and Latin America.
