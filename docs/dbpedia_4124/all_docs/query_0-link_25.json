        "text": "By STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nRising Sun (Ind.) High School has raised a sectional baseball trophy eight times — all on head coach Kevin Wirsch’s watch.\n\nThe Shiners have had Wirsch as head coach since the 2000 season and taken IHSAA Class 1A sectional titles in 2002, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2022.\n\nThe most-recent championship came at the Jac-Cen-Del Sectional (which featured Hauser, Jac-Cen-Del, Oldenburg Academy and Trinity Lutheran) and earned Rising Sun a place in the Morristown Regional on Saturday, June 4.\n\nThe regional semifinals features 16-8 Rising Sun against Shakamak at 11 a.m., followed by Traders Point Christian vs. Indianapolis Lutheran. The championship is slated for 8 p.m. All but Traders Point received votes in the final regular season Indiana High School Baseball Coaches Association poll.\n\nIn 2013, the Shiners won a regional title and took part in the Plainfield Semistate, bowing to eventual 1A state runner-up Vincennes Rivet.\n\nRising Sun (enrollment around 230) is a member of the Ohio River Valley Conference (with Jac-Cen-Del, Milan, Shawe Memorial, South Ripley, Southwestern of Hanover and Switzerland County). The Shiners went 9-3 in the ORVC, finishing behind Southwestern (11-1).\n\n“We’re one of the smallest schools in the state,” says Wirsch, who has also been an English teacher at the school just blocks from the Ohio River since 1999-2000. “I had to work to get players this year.”\n\nBecause of various factors, Wirsch expects to take 11 players to regional and one of those — senior center fielder Kendell Montgomery — has also qualified for the state track meet in Bloomington and will head there after the regional semifinal to compete in the long jump (his seed mark is 21 feet, 3 3/4 inches).\n\n“Believe it or not, we have four and five-sport athletes here,” says Wirsch. “All the coaches (at Rising Sun) know each other and work together.\n\n“That’s what makes it possible.”\n\nWhile participation numbers are often an issue, Wirsch has enjoyed success.\n\n“The kids that come out, buy in and work hard,” says Wirsch. “They do what we ask them to do.\n\n“We try to do the little things right — throw strikes and make plays.”\n\nThe Shiners won the sectional with a 3-2 win against Hauser in 10 innings and 2-0 triumph against Jac-Cen-Del. Rising Sun is 5-2 in games decided by two runs or less and 1-3 in extra innings.\n\nSenior and Earlham College commit Jonathan Jimenez (.431, 3 home runs, 27 runs batted in, 20 runs, 20 stolen bases) leads the offense, which also features junior Peyton Merica (.384, 27 runs, 18 stolen bases), Montgomery (.297, 17 runs), senior third baseman Ashton McCarty (.277, 18 RBI) and junior catcher Brady Works (.267, 21 runs, 17 stolen bases). First baseman Peyton Creech has already joined the National Guard.\n\nRight-handers Merica (7-1, 0.53 earned run average with 98 strikeouts and 16 walks in 66 innings) and Jimenez (5-2, 1.83, 83 K’s, 29 walks, 49 2/3 IP) pace the Shiners pitching staff. Each generally takes turns at shortstop or is somewhere in the infield when not on the mound.\n\nWirsch’s assistants include Steve Jimenez, Keith Works, Jason Merica and one of Wirsch’s former players — Brandon Turner.\n\nRising Sun plays home games on its campus at Shiner Ballpark.\n\n“It’s a nice field,” says Wirsch. “It’s been upgraded since I’ve been there. We’ve got new dugouts and lights.”\n\nThe school’s softball field is near the baseball diamond. The Shiners have won eight sectional softball titles.\n\nA junior high program at Rising Sun was established about seven years ago. This feeds the high school. Many core players who hone their skills in travel ball in Madison, Cincinnati and northern Kentucky.\n\nRecent graduates to move on to college baseball include Class of 2018’s Brent Turner (Huntington University), 2019’s Brayden Bush (Kentucky Wesleyan College), 2020’s Steven Jimenez (Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati) and 2021’s Landon Cole (Franklin College).\n\nWirsch is a 1993 graduate of East Central High School in St. Leon, Ind., where his baseball coach was Bob Benner.\n\nHe played football and baseball for two years at the University of Evansville. Jim Brownlee was the Purple Aces baseball coach. When UE dropped football, he transferred to Northern Kentucky University, where he earned an English degree.\n\nWirsch is also an assistant football coach at Lawrenceburg (Ind.) High School — where son Ashton (18) played and graduated last weekend — and has coached that sport at South Dearborn.\n\nBesides Ashton, Kevin and wife Amy Wirsch have a daughter named Alexandra (23).\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nEric Hilton is breaking baseball down to the basic elements as head coach at Crothersville (Ind.) Junior/Senior High School.\n\nIn his second year leading the Jackson County-based Tigers in 2021-22, Hilton wants his players throwing to the correct bases and knowing situations.\n\n“It’s basics and fundamentals,” says Hilton. “We’ve been working on it in the off-season. We are making progress in that area.”\n\nIn 2020-21, Crothersville had just one athlete who had played any baseball in the last four years. To have enough players to field a team, there were 10 boys and four girls. There were too few girls for a softball squad.\n\nCrothersville (enrollment around 125) is a member of the Southern Athletic Conference (with Borden, Henryville, Lanesville, New Washington and South Central (Elizabeth).\n\nIn 2021, the Tigers were part of an IHSAA Class 1A sectional grouping with New Washington (host), Shawe Memorial and West Washington. Crothersville has not yet won a sectional title.\n\nAt such a small school, participation numbers have always been an issue. Then came the pandemic.\n\n“A lot of kids didn’t return to baseball after COVID (took away the 2020 season),” says Hilton. “They found other things to do.”\n\nBut things are looking up for the spring of 2022. Fourteen different boys have participated in off-season activities and 21 signed up recently with the intention of coming out for baseball.\n\n“We have very decent numbers,” says Hilton, who counts Rita Fletcher as an assistant with another four or five possibles.\n\nThree players — senior catcher/pitcher/third baseman Matthew Clouse, sophomore catcher/pitcher/second baseman Logen O’Sullivan and sophomore shortstop/center fielder Lucas Hilton (the coach’s oldest son) — have indicated their desire to play college baseball.\n\nJunior high baseball, which is played in nearby communities like Austin, Brownstown, Seymour and Scottsburg, has not been present at Crothersville for a few years. Hilton hopes to bring that back in the next few years.\n\nRight now the Crothersville Youth League (T-ball to age 14) serves as a feeder program.\n\nBefore taking the job at Crothersville, Hilton coached Lucas with travel ball teams, including the Southern Indiana Venom, Blazers and The Swings.\n\nA 1995 graduate of Seymour High School, Hilton played baseball for the Owls as a freshman and sophomore. He was also in football as a ninth grader and then went to soccer.\n\nHe graduated at Indiana University Purdue University Columbus and graduated from Ashworth University in Peachtree Corners, Ga. He is in grocery merchandising with the Louisville division of the Kroger Co., working with 116 stores.\n\nEric and Jennifer Hilton have been married 17 years. Lucas Hilton is 16 and Tyler Hilton 12.\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nSouth Ripley High School in Versailles, Ind., has had its share of baseball success.\n\nFrom 2016-19, the Raiders averaged nearly 16 wins per season.\n\nThe team had plenty of veterans in 2020, but that season was lost to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2021, South Ripley won its eighth sectional title — the first since 2008. That team featured Indiana High School Baseball Coaches Association North/South All-Star Series selection Brady Linkel (now at Ohio University).\n\nJeff Greiwe, a Raiders assistant to Steve Franklin the past several years whose middle son Aaron was a senior ballplayer in 2020, has been named South Ripley head coach as the team prepares for 2022.\n\nAs head coach, Greiwe plans to assert the importance of fundamentals and attention to detail.\n\n“If you want the big things to happen, you’ve got to do the little things right,” says Greiwe. “Bunting, base running, throwing strikes — those things will definitely be emphasized.\n\n“We’re going to be extremely young. We’re going to start several freshmen.”\n\nAmong those is catcher Trent Smith.\n\nKeeping everyone involved is also a Greiwe strength.\n\n“I make it a point to use everybody during the game,” says Greiwe.\n\nSouth Ripley (enrollment around 370) is a member of the Ohio River Valley Conference (with Jac-Cen-Del, Milan, Rising Sun, Shawe Memorial, Southwestern of Hanover and Switzerland County).\n\nORVC teams play each other twice during the season.\n\nIn 2021, the Raiders were part of an IHSAA Class 2A sectional grouping with Milan, North Decatur, South Decatur, Southwestern of Hanover and Switzerland County.\n\nSouth Ripley plays its home games on-campus at Forest G. Waters Field. A few years ago, the mound was re-done and new bullpen mounds and dugouts were installed.\n\n“We’ve got a strong tradition in baseball and one of the better fields in southeastern Indiana,” says Greiwe. “It’s up to me to keep the field to a very high standard.”\n\nGreiwe (pronounced (Gry-vee), who teaches high school Geometry, keep things going in the summer and fall for whomever was going to be the head coach and that turned out to be him. He was approved by the school board this month.\n\nGreiwe coached the 14U Redlegs Baseball Club in the summer and fall of 2021.\n\nAs has been the case for years, local players took part in high school and junior team fall leagues at the CERA Sports Park and Camp Ground in Columbus, Ind.\n\nAfter helping get the junior high baseball program off the ground, Greiwe moved up the South Ripley coaching ranks.\n\nBrian Smith, who has coached at the junior high level the past few years, is part of the South Ripley high school staff. Greiwe is talking to other possible 2022 assistants.\n\nA 1998 graduate of Greensburg (Ind.) Community High School when the Pirates were coached by Roger Cash, Greiwe earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Education from Ball State University.\n\nGreiwe has been head coach at Milan in two different stints, helped former high school classmate Doug Behlmer at Oldenburg (Ind.) Academy and was head coach at North Decatur.\n\nPrior to teaching at South Ripley, Greiwe was an elementary then middle school math teacher at Milan.\n\nJeff, who is married to South Ripley Elementary teacher and former head volleyball coach Robyn Greiwe, has also coached sons Shayne, Aaron Griewe and Peyton during their travel ball years.\n\nShayne Griewe (Class of 2018) served in the U.S. Navy and is now working in Florida. Aaron Griewe is in the Navy and stationed in Norfolk, Va. Peyton Owens (Class of 2020) is studying music at Dark Horse Institute in Franklin, Tenn.\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nRock Creek Community Academy in Sellersburg, Ind., fielded its first baseball team in 2021.\n\nThe Jay Hafele-coached Lions played at the junior varsity level and did not participate in the IHSAA tournament. RCCA ended the season with 13 players. More than half of the team had played little or no organized baseball.\n\n“A lot of people came out because they wanted to try it,” says Hafele, who expects the numbers and Baseball I.Q. to climb.\n\n“I think we’re going to have 20 this year,” says Hafele, a 1998 Evansville Harrison High School graduate who played three years of college baseball and is teaching Physical Education, Health and Life Skills to high school and middle school students at the K-12 institution (it became a charter school in 2010). “We’ll have more knowledgeable people than we’ve ever had that played Little League and (baseball’s) been a part of their life.\n\n“We don’t have a field (on-campus) yet, but that’s in the works.”\n\nRock Creek played and practiced last spring at Silver Creek Township Park, which is less than a mile from the school.\n\nTwo public high schools — Silver Creek and Charlestown — are 1.3 and 6.1 miles away, respectively.\n\nMore participation means the possibility of more pitchers which will help with the IHSAA pitch count rule.\n\n“Our rule of thumb is let the hitter get himself out,” says Hafele. “Throw strikes. That’s all we need.”\n\nOther concepts that the coach sees as important are sportsmanship, leadership, fun and the ability to move on from mistakes.\n\n“We’re not letting the last play effect your next play,” says Hafele. “I can’t emphasize that enough.\n\n“Just get the next out.”\n\nHafele hopes his team — which again play a JV slate in 2022 — will be able to scrimmage Charlestown in the preseason to more-prepared for games.\n\nB.J. Paro is one of his assistants and Hafele hopes to have more.\n\nThe Lions’ 2021 schedule included Indiana’s Cannelton, Columbus Christian, Crawford County, Henryville, Jennings County, Lanesville, Perry Central, Providence, Scottsburg, Shawe Memorial, Springs Valley and West Washington and Kentucky’s Whitefield Academy.\n\nRock Creek Community Academy (enrollment around 180) is an independent with no athletic conference affiliation.\n\nAn IHSAA Limited Contact Period goes from Aug. 30-Oct. 16. With Rock Creek’s size (about 180 in the top four grades) and many players in football (seven of nine 2021 baseball starters played that sport and Hafele has been on the coaching staff) or soccer, the Lions have not worked out in the fall.\n\nRCCA’s football team practices on-campus, but rents space at Woehrle Athletic Complex, which is five miles from campus in Jeffersonville, Ind., for home games.\n\nAn outfielder as a player, Hafele played for head coach Andy Rice at Harrison then for one season for Mike Goedde at the University of Southern Indiana before transferring to John A. Logan College, a National Junior College Athletic Association member in Carterville, Ill., and played one season for Jerry Halstead.\n\nFrom there, Hafele went to NCAA Division I McNeese State University in Lake Charles, La., but never suffered a shoulder injury and never played for the Cowboys.\n\nHe played his final college season for Rick Parr at Indiana University Southeast in New Albany, where he earned a bachelor’s degree.\n\nJay and wife Jill, who also teaches at Rock Creek, have three children — son Cooper (12), daughter Skylar (7) and son Chase (2).\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nNearly a decade after guiding a high school baseball program, Dan Thurston is back in that role.\n\nHired as School Resource Officer at Southwestern High School in Hanover, Ind., in January 2020, he became Rebels head baseball coach around mid-year.\n\nThurston was head coach at nearby Madison (Ind.) Consolidated High School 2009-11 while also serving as D.A.R.E officer in the junior high. He resigned as baseball coach when he became chief of the City of Madison Police Department.\n\nMeanwhile, he headed up Long Toss Indiana LLC and the Indiana Rawlings Tigers LLC, helping players with arm care and Mental Toughness Training.\n\nA few years ago, Thurston sold the businesses as a package. He was invited by head coach Grant Bellak to join the Hanover College coaching staff and had spent 2019 and 2020 with the Panthers when the opportunities came along at Southwestern.\n\n“One thing I really enjoyed about Hanover was the personal interaction with players,” says Thurston, who played tennis, basketball and baseball at Mooresville (Ind.) High School and baseball at Hanove. “They knew where they were in life and where they were going to go. They were thankful to play more baseball. But it’s probably not going to be their profession after college.\n\n“I learned so much in the last two years about how to run a program and how to run a practice. I think I’ll be a much better coach than I was before.”\n\nAs SRO, Thurston estimates that he spends more than half his time on relationships with the rest split between counseling and his law enforcement duties.\n\nUntil becoming coach, he got to know students as people and not as athletes.\n\nThurston took the coaching job in time to lead a few summer workouts in June and then guided IHSAA Limited Contact Period activities in the fall.\n\n“It was intrasquad games, (batting practice), infield drills and arm care. We did long toss to stretch arms out,” says Thurston. “Looking back on it, it more about me getting to the know the kids and the program and them getting to know me and my style.\n\n“My style has evolved over the years. At Madison — to a fault — I was a little bit of a control freak. Now I have really good assistants and I expect them to coach.”\n\nThurston’s Rebels staff includes Ethan Leach, Brian Crank and Brendon Bump.\n\nLeach played at Madison Consolidated and Indiana University Southeast. Crank, who is dean of students and junior varsity boys basketball coach at Southwestern, played at Franklin (Ind.) College an was a JV coach for Thurston at Madison. Pitching coach Bump took the mound for Marshall University (Huntington, W.Va.) and was on Shayne Stock’s Hanover coaching staff.\n\nWinter conditioning began at Southwestern last week. Thurston expects around 22 players for varsity and junior varsity teams in the spring.\n\nSouthwestern (enrollment around 375) is a member of the Ohio River Valley Conference (with Jac-Cen-Del, Milan, Rising Sun, Shawe Memorial, South Ripley and Switzerland County).\n\nORVC teams play each other twice on a home-and-home basis.\n\nThough it may not happen in 2021, Thurston says he would like those games to come in the same week.\n\n“That avoids team having one really good pitcher to space out their conference games and pitch the same kid in every game,” says Thurston. “You get more of a true team conference champion.”\n\nSuper ATV Field, located on the Southwestern campus, has a turfed home plate area. A new scoreboard — never used with the cancellation of the 2020 season — is expected to be in-place for the Rebels’ first home game of 2021.\n\nThurston says there’s talk of lighting the field and expanding the dugouts.\n\n“Of course that comes down to that almighty dollar,” says Thurston.\n\nThe Rebels are part of an IHSAA Class 2A sectional grouping with Milan, North Decatur, South Decatur, South Ripley and Switzerland County. Southwestern’s lone sectional title came in 1999.\n\nThe Madison Cubs are on the Rebels’ schedule. Southwestern has never beaten Madison in varsity baseball. When the Rebels won the Class 2A Jeffersonville Regional in 1999, the Cubs and Indiana Mr. Baseball Bryan Bullington won the 3A state championship.\n\n“I’m going to be low key,” says Thurston of this spring’s Southwestern-Madison meeting. “I’m going to treat it just like any other game.\n\n“There’s no pressure for us to win.”\n\nThurston is also a regional scout for SportsForce Baseball — a recruiting service that helps players find the best fit at the college level.\n\nLast summer, he was able to help athletes while serving as a tournament director for Pastime Tournaments.\n\n“I often tell players to take baseball out of the equation,” says Thurston. “Is it the right fit academically, financially and socially? Is it the right distance from home and the right size of school?\n\n“Check all the other boxes first. If baseball is important to you, let’s go somewhere we can play. Some are OK with being the program guy.”\n\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic has come extra years of eligibility for college players. Thurston says his gut tells him that it may be until 2023 before the trickle-down effect that hits younger college players — and even high schoolers — settles down.\n\nThere has traditionally been youth baseball run by the Hanover parks department. Southwestern schedules up to 20 games in the spring for its junior team of seventh and eighth graders.\n\nRecent Southwestern graduate Bailey Elliott is on the baseball roster at Vincennes (Ind.) University. Thurston says he expects the Rebels to produce more college players in the next few years.\n\nDan and wife Jackie Thurston will be married 32 years in March. The couple has three children — Trey (29), Ryan (26) and Trisha (22).\n\nTrey Thurston is in veterinary school at Lincoln Memorial University in Harrogate, Tenn.\n\nLeft-handed pitcher Ryan Thurston played at Madison Consolidated and Western Kentucky University and in the Toronto Blue Jays organization. He was with the independent Chicago Dogs and Gary SouthShore RailCats in 2019 and is expected to be back with that club in 2021. Gary did not field a team in 2020 and Thurston went with the indy Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks and Winnipeg Goldeyes.\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati graduate Trisha Thurston works for Fifth Third Bank in Cincinnati.\n\nBY STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nBrent Ingram went to Indianapolis to attend college.\n\nHis first two teaching jobs were in Gas City, Ind., and Switz City, Ind.\n\nThen the Washington County, Ind., native came back south and became an educator and a coach at a school just up the road from where he grew up.\n\nIngram is a 2011 graduate of Salem (Ind.) High School. He had three coaches in four years. The last one was Brett Miller.\n\nThe Lions’ two county rivals were West Washington and Eastern (Pekin). His father, Larry Ingram, was head coach at Eastern for 29 seasons, concluding in 2011.\n\nAfter earning his degree in kinesiology with an emphasis on physical education at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) in 2015, Brent Ingram worked one year each as a teacher only at Mississinewa High School and White River Valley High School.\n\nThen West Washington Junior-Senior High School principal MaryAnne Knapp called to say that the Senators needed a P.E. teacher and a head baseball coach.\n\nTo his his, he is just the second head baseball coach in the history of the program that was also a teacher.\n\n“That’s a big deal to be able to recruit kids,” says Ingram. “Our numbers are better. We expect to have eight or nine freshmen.”\n\nIngram took both teaching and coaching positions in 2017-18 and made his father one of his assistants.\n\n“I grew up around a baseball coach and a baseball setting and I loved every minute of it,” says Ingram, who counts Larry Ingram, Tim Barksdale and Lincoln Jones as West Washington assistants.\n\nBarksdale is the former director of the youth league in Campbellsburg and a school board member. Jones teaches business at West Washington. The North Harrison High School graduate pitched for four years at Franklin (Ind.) College.\n\nThe 2000 baseball season will be Brent Ingram’s third at the IHSAA Class 1A school of about 290 students.\n\nThe first season saw the Senators on the wrong end of many run-rule games. That only happened a couple times last spring.\n\n“They’ve improved,” says Ingram, who has had about a dozen players in the program and on a few occasions — such as days when baseball games and track meets fell on the same day — went into games with just nine. There was a time he his left fielder was playing with the broken arm. “It makes you sweat a little bit. If the guys are willing to put the time in, they’re going to play.”\n\nMoving players around the diamond is the norm.\n\n“We’ve had bunch of different lineups in the last few years,” says Ingram. “That’s for sure.”\n\nBaseball is a priority at West Washington as evidenced by the building a junior high diamond next to the high school facility — Claude C. Combs Field (named for the former Senators head coach and current school board member).\n\nThe junior high team is affiliated with the school system and coached by West Washington Elementary principal Tom Rosenbaum and West Washington Community Schools superintendent Keith Nance.\n\nA training building with indoor mounds and batting cages will also benefit the Senators.\n\nWhether that will translate into any home runs at Combs Field remains to be seen. While is is 300 feet down the lines and 350 to center, the field sits up on a hill and the wind seems to always be blowing in.\n\nIngram has never witnessed a game-time home run there.\n\nCombs Field is lighted and has brick dugouts, raised fences all the way around and, recently, a turf home plate area was added.\n\n“For a 1A, we have awesome facilities,” says Ingram.\n\nThe Senators are part of a sectional grouping with Crothersville, New Washington and Shawe Memorial. West Washington, a sectional host the past two years, has yet to win a sectional title.\n\nAs a member of the Patoka Lake Athletic Conference (with Crawford County, Mitchell, Orleans, Paoli, Perry Central and Springs Valley), the Senators play home and away games against each league team.\n\nBesides Eastern (Pekin) and Salem, past non-conference opponents have included Borden, Christian Academy of Indiana, Clarksville, Crothersville, Evansville Christian, North Harrison, Orleans, Scottsburg, Shoals, Southwestern (Hanover) and Trinity Lutheran.\n\nThe Ingrams (from left): Brooke, Nick, Dustin, Larry, Luke, Janis and Brent. Brent Ingram is head baseball coach at West Washington High School in Campbellsburg, Ind. Larry Ingram, who was head coach at Eastern (Pekin) for 29 years, is one of his assistants.

Practice was Friday and games are slated Saturday and Sunday at Madison Consolidated’s Gary O’Neal Field.\n\nWhy does Bradshaw stay with the game?\n\n“I just love the game,” says Bradshaw, who has won 499 games with seven invitational tournament, six conference, eight sectional, two regional and two Final Four appearances. “When I couldn’t play it anymore, I knew I wanted to become a teacher so I could coach. It’s been a really great ride over the last three and half decades.\n\n“I’ve coached just about everything there is a coach at Jac-Cen-Del. I wouldn’t have it any other way.”\n\nBradshaw, who led the Eagles boys basketball program to an IHSAA Class 1A state championship in 2008-09 and was head coach as recently as 2012-13, teaches physical education and health.\n\nHe points to the lessons learned on and around the court and the diamond.\n\n“You’re going to learn so many things from athletics,” says Bradshaw. “You’re going to learn not only how to work together. You’re going to learn how to be responsible. You’re going to have to learn to become determined and focused.\n\n“I like to see the kids come out of our program with idea that it takes teamwork for anything to happen just like it does in life.\n\n“You can have all kinds of determination on your own, but you need to have a support system, too.\n\n“It takes a lot of hard work and determination to get somewhere in life.”\n\nJac-Cen-Del (enrollment around 300) is a member of the Ohio River Valley Conference (with Milan, Rising Sun, Shawe Memorial, South Ripley, Southwestern of Hanover and Switzerland County).\n\nThe ORV plays a double round robin to determine its champion.\n\nIn 2018-19, the Eagles were part of an IHSAA Class 1A sectional grouping with Hauser, North Decatur, Oldenburg Academy, Rising Sun and South Decatur. Jac-Cen-Del has won eight sectional titles — the last in 2016.\n\nThe 2019 Eagles went 11-13.\n\n“I started eight sophomores,” says Bradshaw. “I’m looking forward to the next couple years.”\n\nBradshaw will get to be around the all-stars for a couple days, but he has advice for them.\n\n“I just want them to enjoy the moment,” says Bradshaw. “They must’ve done something right to get themselves here.\n\n“They don’t bring people in that are not good people and good athletes. It’s a pleasure and an hour to be here.”\n\nBradshaw is proud of JCD’s home field, saying it is one of the finest in southeastern Indiana.\n\n“We put a lot of time and effort into it,” says Bradshaw. “Everything was completely re-sodded on the inner portion of the diamond. Everything was re-done as far as the clay mixture and the meal mix.\n\n“We put in a new backstop and new fencing in the last 10 years. For a 1A school, it’s a pretty nice field.\n\n“(Batesville coach Justin) Tucker loves to come there and play.”\n\nDavid Bradshaw has been head baseball coach at his alma mater — Jac-Cen-Del High School — for 35 years. He has won 499 games. He is head coach of the South for the 2019 Indiana High School Baseball Coaches Association North/South All-Star Series at Madison.

Academy enjoyed the highest number of participants and victories in a number of years in 2019.\n\nThe IHSAA Class 1A member in Franklin County near Batesville had 24 players in the program and followed up two straight five-win seasons by going 16-8-1.\n\nThe Twisters fell to Rising Sun in the championship game of the Jac-Cen-Del Sectional. The win total is two shy of single-season school record.\n\n“We’re on the uptick with enrollment and with kids being interested (in baseball),” says Doug Behlmer, who just finished his 19th season as OA head coach (the private school went coed 19 years ago). “Hopefully, it keeps going.”\n\nDrawing from area parter Catholic elementary and middle schools (St. Louis in Batesville, St. Nicholas in Sunman, St. Mary’s in Greensburg, St. Mary of the Immaculate Conception in Aurora, St. Lawrence in Lawrenceburg, St. Michael in Brookville and St. John the Baptist in Harrison) and public schools in Indiana and Ohio, Oldenburg Academy (enrollment around 225) is an independent in baseball.\n\nThe Twisters’ schedule includes 1A’s Blue River Valley, Edinburgh, Greenwood Christian Academy, Jac-Cen-Del, North Decatur, Rising Sun, Seton Catholic, Shawe Memorial, South Decatur, Trinity Lutheran and Waldron, 2A’s Centerville, Indianapolis Scecina Memorial, South Ripley, Southwestern (Hanover), Switzerland County and Triton Central 2A, 3A’s Lawrenceburg and Rushville.\n\nBesides Rising Sun and Jac-Cen-Del, Oldenburg Academy is in sectional grouping with Hauser, North Decatur and South Decatur. The Twisters have won four sectional titles (2003, 2004, 2005, 2010).\n\nThe Twisters play home games at Liberty Park in Batesville — the same facility used by Batesville High School.\n\nWith more than a dozen incoming freshmen indicating a desire to play baseball in 2020, Behlmer says the program could have an all-time high of more than 30 players and could even have to make cuts for the first time.\n\nWhen the program began, there was just 13 freshmen and the Twisters played a junior varsity schedule. That moved toward a full varsity schedule in the next few years.\n\nThe 2019 team was led on the mound by sophomore right-handers Chris Hautman, Andrew Oesterling and Riley Schebler and in the batter’s box by Oesterling, Hautman, Schebler, sophomores Race Carle and Patrick Thompson and juniors Matt Sedler, Adam Huber and Michael Hoff.\n\nSenior Hunter Sullivan has committed to play baseball for Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa.\n\nBehlmer’s coaching staff included former OA players Spencer Gommel, Patrick Kolks and Matt Bohman and pitching coach Jeff Ahaus (a Lawrenceburg eye doctor who had two sons play for the Twisters). Bohman is in charge of the junior varsity team.\n\nPoints of emphasis include dependability and hard work.\n\n“If you say you’re going do something, make sure you do it,” says Behlmer. “Family, faith and academics all come in front of baseball.”\n\nA 1988 graduate of Greensburg (Ind.) High School, Behlmer played for head coach Roger Cash.\n\n“Coach Cash was an old school guy,” says Behlmer. “He believed in fundamentals and making the routine play. I’ve carried that over to our guys. Nothing too flashy. Be solid. Throw strikes. That sort of thing.”\n\nDoug and Judy Behlmer have been married 21 years and have no children. He is employed by Hill-Rom in Batesville.\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nThey’re making baseball memories at a tiny school in southern Indiana.\n\nLed by father and son co-coaches Brad and Alex Wiseman, the South Central (Elizabeth) Rebels have won the IHSAA Class 1A Shawe Memorial Sectional and are getting ready for the two-hour trek to the Loogootee Regional (South Central plays No. 9-ranked Tecumseh at 11 a.m., followed by Trinity Lutheran vs. No. 6 Barr-Reeve with the championship at 7:30 p.m.).\n\nSouth Central spotted Borden four runs in the first two innings and trailed 6-2 after four frames in the sectional championship before winning 10-8 and earning a ride on the Elizabeth Volunteer Fire Department’s truck when they got back from Madison to Harrison County.\n\n“It’s a good memory for the boys — something they’ll never forget,” says Alex Wiseman, who played for the Rebels and graduated from South Central in 2012 before pitching for Hanover (Ind.) College. “South Central baseball is a tradition around here. Everybody knows about it.”\n\nThe team mugged for the championship photo wearing the green “Hank Strong” T-shirts that they donned in a benefit game for Hank Sutherland, a young boy in the community dealing with Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome.\n\nKim Wiseman enjoys being at the park about as much as husband Brad and son Alex.\n\n“She’s the epitome of a baseball mom,” says Brad Wiseman. “Alex is 25 and baseball has been a part of our lives for 22 years.\n\n“(Kim) is just as excited to see a Cincinnati Reds game or a T-ball game.”\n\nAlex and wife Leslie have a son — Maverick (1).\n\nWill the boy be a ballplayer?\n\nWhile sitting for her grandson, Kim got a fat lip when a baseball was thrown harder than she anticipated.\n\nThe younger Wiseman has watched the South Central team develop a “grind-it-out mentality.”\n\nThe turning point in the season came May 7 at South Central’s Donald L. Dones Field. That’s when the Rebels rallied from a five-run deficit in the bottom of the seventh inning to edge Austin 10-9. The Eagles scored all nine runs in the first two innings.\n\n“That opened the eyes of the boys,” says Alex Wiseman of the comeback against a team that will compete in Saturday’s 2A Southridge Regional. “It shows they can accomplish a lot.”\n\nSouth Central (enrollment around 215) part of the South Harrison Community School Corporation, which also includes Corydon Central High School (3A).\n\nThe Rebels belong to the Southern Athletic Conference (with Borden, Crothersville, Henryville, Lanesville and New Washington).\n\nThe top three finishers in the 2019 SAC pennant race were Henryville (5-0), Lanesville (4-1) and South Central (3-2).\n\nThe Rebels are part of a sectional grouping with Borden, Christian Academy of Indiana, New Washington and Shawe Memorial.\n\nBrad Wiseman, who was a South Central junior varsity coach from 2014-17 before being joined by Alex to lead the Rebels beginning with the 2018 season, saw the team take an 11-16 regular-season into the postseason before beating Christian Academy and Borden for the program’s seventh sectional title (all since 2005).\n\n“We were very aggressive (about playing all scheduled contests),” says Brad Wiseman. “We knew we needed as much game experience as we could get to get us ready for this part of the season.”\n\nThe Rebels took on 3A teams like Providence and Silver Creek (ranked No. 10 and the 2018 2A state runners-up) and 2A’s Lanesville.\n\n“We really see the difference, especially in the sophomores,” says Alex Wiseman of the strong competition. “The game is coming a lot easier to them.”\n\nSays Brad Wiseman, “We get overlooked because of our record. But it’s not how you start, it’s how you finish.”\n\nVarious factors, including injuries, left South Central’s sophomore-heavy roster with 16 players and many junior varsity games were canceled.\n\nThe Rebels’ top pitchers are junior Zach Needler, sophomore Frank Goodman and seniors Wyatt Crosier, Bryce Lewis and Will Weber. All but Weber are right-handers.\n\nCrosier, junior Austin Tyree and sophomores Wes Wilson and Stephen Sawicki are offensive leaders.\n\nThe Wisemans are assisted by Jeff Riley and Jeff Skaggs.\n\nDones Field has seen upgrades in the past decade and more are on the way. New dugouts and backstop fencing was added around 2010. Since then, the Rebels have gained an indoor hitting facility, turf was placed around home plate and new bullpens and more fencing is coming in the near future.\n\nSouth Harrison Athletic Corporation (SHAC) is a feeder system, training players from age 4 through eighth grade in the Babe Ruth/Cal Ripken system.\n\nThe Wisemans maintain a relationship with junior high coaches to make sure those players are prepared for high school baseball. The younger boys are invited to serve as managers for the older ones and experience the culture.\n\nBrad Wiseman is a 1986 graduate of Castle High School, where he played for Indiana High School Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Famer Al Rabe.\n\n“He was very insistent on the fine details,” says Brad Wiseman of Rabe. “You knew where you needed to be on the field at all times.”\n\nAlex Wiseman’s coach at South Central was Nick Tremain (now head coach at Lawrenceburg).\n\n“He was very much about the mental approach to the game,” says Alex Wiseman. “We played with a swagger. We expected to win. If you take that attitude, not a lot of teams are going to beat you.\n\n“These are values we’ve tried to instill in the boys. Believe you can do it and you will get there if you put in the work.”\n\nWork away from baseball happens in nearby Kentucky for both father and son.

We want to do it up right.\n\n“We’re going to make the all-stars feel like all-stars.”\n\nFestivities are to be held at Madison Consolidated, nearby Hanover College as well as on and along the Ohio River.\n\nMadison boasts the “largest contiguous national historic district in the United States” with sites, landmarks and tours plus speciality shopping, restaurants and cafes and the lure of Clifty Falls State Park.\n\nMadison Consolidated will be the site of three all-star games for seniors (25 each representing the North and South) on the weekend. Hanover will house the players and be the site of the Futures Games (replaces the Junior Showcase) and all-star banquet.\n\nArmstrong says Armstrong says Governor Eric Holcomb has agreed to throw out a first pitch. Indiana University head coach Jeff Mercer has been tapped to be the keynote speaker at the all-star banquet.\n\nThe plan is to get local youth leaguers and Boys & Girls Club members involved in the fun.\n\nMadison has long considered making a bid for the North-South Series. When Armstrong returned to the Madison Consolidated program for his second stint as head coach, he and former assistant Mike Modesitt (who now tends to all of Madison’s outdoor athletic facilities) began planning and got the mayor’s office and tourism folks involved.\n\nArmstrong served as Madison’s mayor (Jan. 1, 2008 to Dec. 31, 2011) and was a city police officer for many years. He is currently certified through the Jefferson County Sheriff’s office and a resource officer at Madison Consolidated.\n\nBasketball is also dear to Armstrong. He was varsity assistant in boys basketball at Madison two different times and was a lay head boys hoops coach at Shawe Memorial Memorial High School in Madison for two seasons.\n\nThe baseball-playing Madison Cubs call Gary O’Neal Field home.\n\nFormer Madison head coach Gary O’Neal, who retired for the second time after the 2002 season with 601 career victories, is a member of the Indiana High School Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame.\n\nArmstrong graduated from Shawe Memorial in 1979. He became an assistant to O’Neal at Madison in 1982.\n\nHe started as Shawe’s head coach in 1989 and took the Hilltoppers the IHSAA Class 1A State Finals in 2001, losing 1-0 to eventual state champion Triton in the semifinals.\n\nAfter sitting out the 2002 season, he returned as Madison’s head coach from 2003-07, resigned to serve as mayor and then got back into law enforcement. He returned to the program for the 2017 season.\n\nGary O’Neal Field is getting a new scoreboard and windscreen this spring and plans call for an expansion to permanent seating.\n\nDuring Armstrong’s first stint with the Cubs, he enlisted the help of Madison American Legion Post 9 and got upgrades to the park like irrigation, a new back stop and fencing and a three-tier press box.\n\n“It’s constant work if you want a nice facility,” says Armstrong. “We’ve got a lot of work to do between now and June. But we’re getting there.”\n\nMadison Consolidated (enrollment around 875) is the smallest school in the Hoosier Hills Conference (which also includes Bedford North Lawrence, Columbus East, Floyd Central, Jeffersonville, Jennings County, New Albany and Seymour).\n\nA tournament determines the HHC champion.\n\n“It’s a great conference,” says Armstrong. “It’s traditionally strong.”\n\nThe Cubs are part of an IHSAA Class 3A sectional grouping with Batesville, Franklin County, Greensburg, Lawrenceburg, Rushville and South Dearborn. Madison has won 22 sectionals — the last in 2009. A 3A state championship was earned in 1999 as the Cubs topped Fort Wayne Carroll 10-0.\n\nBryan Bullington was the winning pitcher in that contest, capping off a 15-0 senior season.\n\nBullington was selected in the 37th round of the 1999 Major League Baseball First-Year Player Draft by the Kansas City Royals, but opted to go to college. He played three seasons at Ball State University and was chosen No. 1 overall in the 2002 draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates. He made his MLB debut with the Pirates in 2005 and went on to pitch for the Cleveland Indians, Toronto Blue Jays and Royals then in Japan.\n\nArmstrong’s 2019 assistants include Joe Jenner, Ryan Mahoney and Drew Frazier with the varsity and Derek Wynn, Peyton Head and James “Doc” Boyd with the junior varsity or C-teams.\n\nLocal attorney Jenner and insurance agent Mahoney both played on Madison’s 1999 state championship team. Frazier played for Armstrong during his first stint as head coach.\n\nWynn also played one season for Armstrong at Madison. Head is a Hanover student. Boyd played at Evansville Memorial.\n\nArmstrong’s core coaching values include taking responsibility for one’s actions.\n\n“I stress accountability,” says Armstrong. “I hold them accountable for what they do on and off the field.”\n\nThe coach also looks to build a relationship and a sense of trust with his student-athletes.\n\n“I’m very personable with my players,” says Armstrong. “We’re building the character and the type of person they will be once leave high school.”\n\nArmstrong says he appreciates the drive and camaraderie of his current group.\n\n“These kids work hard and they get along together,” says Armstrong. “That’s a big part of it.”\n\nThere are 30 in the Madison Consolidated program in 2019.\n\n“Our middle school program is really strong,” says Armstrong. “They are athletes and baseball players. They’re going bump our numbers back up.”\n\nThere are close to 30 for seventh and eighth grade squads that play in the spring. The Madison Junior High School field is inheriting the old scoreboard and batting cage from Gary O’Neal Field.\n\nThis year, Madison Baseball Club aka Mudcats will field eight travel teams ranging from 7U to 14U. The 14U team, made up mostly of seventh and eighth graders, goes by the Madison Fusion.\n\nNot strictly a Madison organization, players are welcomed from all over southeastern Indiana.\n\n“We want to give kids an opportunity where they can play and not travel far and play a lot of money,” says Armstrong, who indicates that costs to families are cut through fundraising and sponsorships.\n\nMudcats and Fusion players are encouraged to participate with the local recreation leagues during the week and their travel teams on the weekend.\n\nMadison American Legion Post 9, which won a state championship in 2000, went on hiatus in 2018. Armstrong and Jenner were coaches and would like to bring the team back in the future.\n\n“(Post 9) pays for it all,” says Armstrong, who saw American Legion Post 9 Field become a reality at Shawe Memorial and games move to Gary O’Neal Field when he landed there. “It doesn’t cost the kids a dime to play.”\n\nArmstrong played Legion ball for Delbert Liter in the ’70s and later coached with him.\n\nTim Armstrong is in his second stint at head baseball coach at Madison (Ind.) Consolidated High School."
