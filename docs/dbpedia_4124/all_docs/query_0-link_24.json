        "text": "Regional Scholars Program\n\nThe MTSU Regional Scholars Program allows select non-Tennessee resident students seeking an undergraduate or graduate degree who live within approximately 250 miles OR in a contiguous state and meet specific academic requirements to attend MTSU at a greatly reduced rate. The recently approved expansion of the program, which began Fall 2019, also included new and returning students living anywhere within the eight states bordering Tennessee (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina and Virginia).\n\nUndergraduate Students\n\nIn order to qualify the student must meet the following requirements:\n\nGraduated from a high school located in a county within a 250 mile radius of MTSU or from one of the eight states bordering Tennessee (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina and Virginia)\n\nHave an ACT composite of 25 (or SAT equivalent) or above\n\nPrior to March 2016- SAT score of 1130 (Critical Reading & Math)\n\nMarch 2016 and future tests- SAT score of 1200 (Evidence-Based Reading/Writing & Math)\n\nAttend full time (at least 12 hours)\n\nApply for the Academic Common market program (if available)\n\nStudents who qualify will receive:\n\nA reduced tuition rate equal to approximately 48% off the standard out of state rate. Students participating in the Academic Common Market Program may receive even lower rates.\n\nAutomatic consideration for the MTSU Freshman Academic Merit Scholarships (see additional requirements below).\n\nGraduate Students\n\nIn order to qualify the student must meet the following requirements:\n\nHave a documented permanent residence located in a county within a 250 mile radius of MTSU\n\nInclude new and returning students living anywhere within the eight states bordering Tennessee (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina and Virginia)\n\nStudents who qualify will receive:\n\nA reduced tuition rate equal to approximately 48% off the standard out of state rate.\n\nCertain students may be eligible for the Academic Common Market Program which offers instate rates.\n\nFor additional Information regarding Graduate students participating in the Regional Scholars Program, please visit theCollege of Graduate Studies – Affording Graduate School website.\n\nThe Fine Print\n\nStudents not meeting initial eligibility requirements that feel they should be considered can submit an Appeal Request to the MT One Stop, SSAC 210. Examples for an appeal could include a high school within the range but not listed, out-of-date test scores, homeschooled students or transfers who did not submit ACT/SAT scores. Lack of test scores or test scores not meeting minimum requirements cannot be used as a reason to appeal.\n\nStudents who complete the application for admission to the University by December 1st for the following fall admission will receive the special tuition rate and may qualify for an academic scholarship (see additional requirements below). There is no separate application for the Regional Scholars program.\n\nStudents who apply after December 1st but before the start of the term for the following fall admission will receive the special tuition rate but will not be guaranteed an academic scholarship.\n\nEligible High Schools\n\nThe following map will provide a reasonable estimate of the area of eligibility of this program, as well as Academic Common Market.\n\nYou can also check your state’s list below for a list of eligible high schools outside of the eight contiguous states. If your high school is not listed, please contact us for more details.\n\n*Homeschooled students living within the 250 mile radius or one of the eight contiguous states must self-identify in order to be reviewed for eligiblity.\n\nAcademic requirements and award amounts for MTSU Freshman Academic Merit Scholarships\n\nUnderdgraduate Students who will be joining MTSU in the summer or fall semesters, who apply by the priority deadline, and who meet minimum eligibility requirements for the following awards will be offered the appropriate scholarship as long as funding is available.\n\nSAT equivalent scores are for tests taken March 2016 and after and will include Evidence-Based Reading/Writing and Math scores.\n\nRequirements for Continuing Eligibility\n\nStudents must maintain full-time enrollment in the fall and spring semesters. If a student withdraws from a class or classes and drops below full-time, they will be asked to pay out-of-state tuition for that term. A student may regain Regional classification the next term, provided they enroll full-time. If there are documentable extenuating circumstances for the change in enrollment, students can appeal the change in tuition using the appeal form. This form must be submitted to the One Stop prior to the end of the term in question.\n\nUndergraduate Admissions\n\n615-898-2111\n\n[email protected]"
