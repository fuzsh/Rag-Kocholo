        "text": "A STANDARD HISTORY\n\nOF\n\ni\n\nGeorgia and Georgians\n\nBy LUCIAN LAMAR KNIGHT\n\nILLUSTRATED\n\nVOLUME V\n\nTHE LEWIS PUBLISHING COMPANY\n\nCHICAGO : : NEW YORK 1917\n\nw/j I I\n\n'i i i\n\nCOPYRIGHT BY\n\nTHE LEWIS PUBLISHING Co.\n\n'H\n\nGeorgia and Georgians\n\nHON. HENRY BASCOM STRANGE. In the annals of the judiciary of Bulloch County there is found no name that is held in higher honor, esteem and confidence than that of Hon. Henry Bascom Strange, jurist, legist, publicspirited citizen and self-made man, whose record in public and private life alike is one on which there is not the slightest stain or blemish. Few men have gained more honestly or completely the admiration of their fellowcitizens, and the honor that has come to him has been gained without animosity.\n\nJudge Strange was born in Effingham County, Georgia, November 13,1863, the family home being located at Mount Pleasant Landing, on the Savannah River. His father, the Rev. L. L, Strange, was: born near Spartansburg, South Carolina, and as a boy of twelve years was brought to Georgia, where he spent the rest of his life, his mature years as a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Conference and as a preacher of wide renown. He died at the age of forty-five years. He was married in Effingham County to Florence Wilson, a native of that county, who is now living at Statesboro, at the age of seventy-two years, and they became the parents of six children, of whom five are still living: Dr. George P., a practicing physician of Effingham County; Henry Bascom; Berry L., a practicing attorney of Houston, Texas; Mrs. Lizzie Graham, of Effingham County; and Mrs. Susie Ann Rackley, who is a resident of Statesboro.\n\nHenry Bascom Strange was but twelve years of age when his father died, and at that time he became the sole support of his mother, this naturally precluding the idea of any extensive educational training at that time. How ever, he had attended the public schools, and when twenty-one years of age began earnestly the study of his chosen profession, and when twenty-two entered the office of J. G. and D. H. Clark, of Tusculum, Georgia, spending two years under the preceptorship of these gentlemen. He was admitted to the bar May 14,1888, under Judge A. P. Adams, of the Eastern Circuit, and at once began practice at Guyton, where he remained four years. He came to Statesboro August 9, 1892, and almost immediately took his place among the strong and thorough attorneys of the Bulloch County seat. As the years passed he established himself more and more thoroughly in the confidence of the people and began to give attention to public affairs. In 1905 he was elected to the Georgia Legislature from the Seventeenth Senatorial District, serving in that and the following year, and in 1908 and 1909 was mayor of Statesboro and gave the people of this city one of the best administrations they have ever known. By this time it was recognized that here was judicial timber, and in 1910 he was elected judge of the City Court, an office which he held for four years. In 1915 he met defeat as a candidate for judge of the Superior Court, Middle Circuit, by 100 votes. He is a member of the Bulloch County Bar Association and the Georgia State Bar Association, is fraternally a Mason, and with his family belongs to the Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\n2285\n\n2286\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\nJudge Strange was married November 4, 1891, at Guyton, Georgia, to Miss Laura Gertrude Fruetrell, daughter of A. J. Fruetrell, a well known merchant still in business at Guyton. They have no children.\n\nAt the time of his retirement as judge of the City Court, Judge Strange was presented with a gold-headed cane by the members of the Bulloch County Bar Association, which body adopted the following resolutions: \"Upon the convening of the City Court, being the first retiring officers of Statesboro, the following resolutions of appreciation were presented and unanimously adopted and ordered to be spread upon the minutes .of the court. Judge Strange. Whereas, with the close of the year 1914, at the hour of midnight, Hon. Henry Bascom Strange's term of office as judge of the City Court of Statesboro expired, after extending over the period of four years; and, Whereas, his administration of that office was marked by a controlling spirit of fairness and impartiality to all, rich and poor alike, without favor or .affection to any, no obligations save to discharge faithfully and fearlessly every duty of the office and, Whereas, during his term of four years he has made for himself by his strict adherence to the principles of right and justice a name and a reputation as a judge of unusual ability and has demonstrated that he possesses a peculiar fitness for the judicial office, a fact recognized by bar and laity alike; and, Whereas, he has uniformly sought to administer the functions of his court with impartiality, tempering justice with mercy, shielding the weak from the oppression of the strong, exercising patience with the shortcomings and the inexperience of many of us who have been practitioners in his court, placing his own experience and knowl edge of the law in the aid of the cause of justice, and in all his conduct of that responsible office has shown an earnest desire and purpose; Whereas, despite the great volume of business over 1,000 cases set before him in the four years, only sixteen cases have been appealed from his court to the Court of Appeals, and of that number a reversal of his decision has only been made in three cases, a record of appeals and reversals perhaps not excelled by any other judge in the state; Be It Now Resolved by the Bar of Bulloch County, that we thus formally express to Judge Strange our regrets at his retirement from office and express to him our cordial personal appreciation of his excellent services as a judge, his splendid character as a man and citizen, and his recognized ability as a felloAV-member of the Bar, and that we tender to him our sincerest wishes for a long and prosperous career at the bar, and that the future may hold in store for him a judicial place of higher station ; and be it further resolved that these resolutions be entered on the minutes of the court and a copy furnished Judge Strange.''\n\nBENJAMIN FRANKLIN JOHNSON. It is an American's proudest boast that he is a self-made man, the architect and builder of his own fortunes. This has come to be true of the South to a much larger extent than it was in ante bellum days, when large estates were handed down from father to son, and there were few manufacturing industries to give rise to opportunities for self advancement. Today, however, the South is full of active, enterprising men, who are investigating and developing her resources, and with the advent of the mill and factory has come a wider and more substantial prosperity in which all the people participate. Among those who are thus aiding in the development of the City of Thomson, McDuffie County, Georgia, is Benjamin Franklin Johnson, a leading business man and banker of this city, which he is now serving in the office of mayor. Mr. Johnson was born in Warren (now MuDuffie) County, Georgia, December 11, 1864, the son of John F. and Effie Reese Johnson, who were natives of this county. The father, who was a well known planter, died in May, 1865, his wife dying\" at the age of seventy-two years. They had but two children: Joel Wigfall, now a prominent citizen of Augusta, engaged in the real estate business; and Benja min Franklin.\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n2287\n\nBenjamin Franklin was only six months old when his father died. He was educated in the country schools and the public schools of Thomson, and at the age of eighteen years began farming in a modest way in McDuffie County. After being thus occupied for six years, he came to Thomson, secur ing a clerkship with the J. A. Shields Mercantile Company. He remained nine years in their employ and then resigned, accepting a position with the T. A. Scott Mercantile Company, with which he remained seven years.' With these two concerns he gained valuable experience, as 'they were the leading mercantile houses in Thomson at that time. With a laudable ambition to be his own master and become a power in the business world, Mr. Johnson assisted in organizing the McDuffie Oil and Fertilizer Company, of which he took the active management, and with which he has been thus connected up to the present time. During the years that have since elapsed this con cern has grown and prospered, and now employs about thirty people, crushing annually about 4,000 tons of cotton seed and distilling about 180,000 gallons of cotton seed oil, for which a ready and profitable market is found. Mr. Johnson is also the vice president and a director of the First National Bank of Thomson. This flourishing institution was organized in 1901 with a capital of $25,000, subsequently increased to $90,000, and has a surplus of undivided profits of $25,000. That Mr. Johnson's fellow citizens have full confidence in his ability and integrity is proved by the fact that in 1913 they elected him mayor of the city, which office he still holds. He avails himself of every opportunity to promote local interests and will at any time cheer fully answer letters of inquiry from prospective settlers pertaining to the industrial or agricultural conditions and possibilities of this locality. Aside from his personal interests already mentioned, he is actively engaged in farm ing, raising cotton, corn and oats. He affiliates religiously with the Methodist Episcopal Church and is a member of the Masonic order.\n\nMr. Johnson was married in Thomson. Georgia, in 1902, to Miss Mary Lou Lewis, of this city, a daughter of Thomas N. and Lou (McLcan) Lewis. Her father, who was for many years a well known merchant of Thomson, is now deceased. Mr. and Mrs. Johnson are the parents of two children: Effie Lewis, born May 17, 1904, and Mary Ruth, born April 17, 1915. The career of Mr. Johnson, as thus depicted, presents an inspiring example to ambitious youths who are gifted with the necessary qualities for success ambition, diligence, perseverance and integrity.\n\nMARSHALL WELLBORN DUNN. Every community has its recognized leaders to whom the people look for initiative action when any important measure is proposed for the general good, or on whose exertions they chiefly depend to bring about its final consummation. To this class properly belongs Marshall Wellborn Dunn, one of the leading merchants of Thomas, McDuffie County, who is now serving as county superintendent of schools. Mr. Dunn was born in Columbia (now McDuffie) County, Georgia, September 5, 1855. His parents were Dr. AVilliam A. and Ada Louisa (Wellborn) Dunn, both natives of Columbia County. The father, who was a graduate of Athens (Georgia) College of Medicine, also of Jefferson College at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, practiced his profession for many years in his native county, until he was forced to retire owing to a serious injury caused by a fall. He purchased the old Isaac Ramsey Plantation of 1,000 acres, in McDuffie County, and operated it successfully for a number of years, aside from his medical practice. His death, which took place in 1898, when he was seventy-six years old, was much deplored, casting a shadow over the entire county. The reason was not far to seek. A generous hearted southern gentleman of the ante-bellum type, of a genial and joyous disposition, he never failed to respond to the call of duty, cheerfully giving his services to all who were unable to pay for them; so it is little wonder that all who knew him loved and honored him. During the war he volunteered as a Confederate soldier, but was sent home by the Confederate\n\n2288\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\nGovernment to care for the wounded left behind. He was a member of the Masonic order, and both he and his wife were active Methodists in religion. The latter died in 1902 at the age of sixty-eight years. Of their family of seven children two died in infancy, the others being as follows: Marshall W., subject of this biography, who was the eldest born; Ethleen, wife of W. R. Dobson, of Ashburn, Georgia; Claudia, who married E. H. Burnside and\n\ndied in 1908; John Clarence, who is a planter on the old homestead, the Ramsey plantation at Cobbham; and Derrelle Duboise, who is a railroad con\n\nductor in the employ of the A. B. & A. Railroad and resides in Atlanta, Marshall Wellborn Dunn was educated in country schools, which he\n\nattended until reaching the age of sixteen, at which time he left school in order to assist his father in the management of the plantation, of which he later took entire charge, residing on it until 1909. He then organized a partner\n\nship with W. T. Parish, under the style of Dunn & Parish, and founded a general mercantile and supply house, which is now one of the leading busi\n\nness concerns in Thomson, the enterprise having been successful. Mr. Dunn\n\nhas long taken a strong interest in educational matters, and his fellow citizens, knowing him to be a good man to entrust with school matters, in 1899 elected him a member of the board of education. After serving efficiently for several years, in 1904 he was elected as county school superintendent, which position he still retains. He took a leading part in the erection of the fine new high school, completed in 1911, and which cost $20,000. In putting through this project to its final consummation, he had to work hard to overcome the strong opposition against it on the part of many citizens who objected to the city's incurring so great an expense, but persuasion and argument finally prevailed, and it would now be hard to find anyone who does not take a pride in this magnificent and commodious building, or who would wish to go back to the old condition of things.\n\nMr. Dunn was first married in 1884 to Miss Mamie Boyd, who died in\n\n1902. She bore him four children, two of whom died in infancy. The sur vivors are: J. Boyd, born February 13, 1888, who is associated with the firm of Dunn & Parish, and Marion W., born December 25, 1891, who is cashier of the First National Bank of Elba, Alabama. On June 21,1903, in Cobbham, McDuffie County, Georgia, Mr. Dunn married for his second wife, Miss Mattie\n\nNeal, daughter of B. L. Neal, a Confederate veteran residing in Columbia, Georgia, who was the son of Basil Neal, a soldier of the Revolution. Of this second union Mr. Dunn has had three children born to him, of whom one died in infancy, the two survivors being: Marshall Neal, born April 19, 1904, and Eugene Palmer, born August 27,1905. Mr. Dunn is an active member of the Methodist Church, he and his amiable wife doing what they can at all times to advance the cause of religion and morality. Their friends are numbered by the score, and there are few families in Thomson better known or more\n\nhighly respected.\n\nEUGENE BURTON RUSSELL. Journalism is probably the medium through which men become more widely known than in any other avenue of business or learned profession. Not always are they brought in this way before the\n\npublic as personalities, but more as influences, their printed thoughts and opinions reaching thousands, where their spoken ones could be heard and appreciated by only comparatively a few. Hence the responsibility of the\n\njournalist is of exceeding weight, and a community may often be judged by the stability and tone of its newspapers. There have been times not too infrequent when a newspaper has forced reformatory legislation, and occa sions have arisen where the fourth estate has been influential in changing the\n\npublic policies of the country. From college halls, Eugene Burton Russell came to Cedartown, Georgia, and entered into newspaper life. During more than a quarter of a century of connection with journalism, he has not only\n\nsucceeded in making a name and a place for himself in his adopted com-\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n2289\n\nmunity, but has also assisted materially in the development and progress of\n\nthe locality where he chose to carry on his activities. He is now half owner\n\nof the Standard Publishing Company, a thriving enterprise; editor of the\n\nCedartown Standard, one of the best conducted newspapers in Northern\n\nGeorgia; and a man of influence in business, financial, civic and political\n\ncircles.\n\nMr. Russell was born in Clyde, Ohio, January 10, 1863, and is a son of\n\nWilliam and Annie (Worst) Russell, natives of the Buckeye State. The\n\nfather, a man of education, passed his life in educational pursuits and died\n\nin 1889, and the mother died in Cedartown in 1915. His sister, Miss Delia\n\nRussell, has been a teacher in the public schools here since 1895, and is well\n\nand favorably known as an educator.\n\n*\n\nEugene Burton Russell received his early education in the graded and\n\nhigh schools of Clyde, Ohio, being graduated from -the latter in 1880, at the\n\nage of fifteen years. At that time he began to learn the printer's trade,\n\nthoroughly learning every detail of the business, in which he was in after\n\nyears to become most successful. At the age of .twenty-one years, he entered\n\nBaldwin University, Berea, Ohio, and was duly graduated therefrom in 1887,\n\nwith the degree of Bachelor of Arts. In the fall of 1888 Mr. Russell decided\n\nto settle in the South, it being his intention to enter the real estate business,\n\nand he accordingly came to Tallapoosa, Haralson County, Georgia, to look\n\nover the ground for an opening. In the spring of 1889 he changed his mind\n\nabout remaining permanently at Tallapoosa, and came to Cedartown, where\n\nthe opportunity presented itself for him to enter the field of journalism.\n\nThe Cedartown Standard was offered for sale, and the county seat of Polk\n\nCounty needed a good, live newspaper. Mr. Russell saw there was an opening\n\nfor such a venture, if conducted along proper lines, and another young,\n\nenergetic and ambitious man, Mr. W. S. Coleman, became interested with him,\n\nand the two bought out the stock and the newspaper outfit. Then began a\n\ncampaign that after a long, hard struggle eventuated in the building up of a\n\nsuccessful and popular newspaper. For a time the old shop, type and presses\n\nwere used, but as soon as the partners found their business was growing\n\nsufficiently to warrant it, they built a suitable and commodious brick build\n\ning, and equipped this with the best of modern printing presses and linotype\n\nmachines, and all equipment which goes to make up a thoroughly up-to-date\n\nnewspaper plant. The Standard has grown and expanded until it now has\n\nmore than 2,500 subscribers, with excellent advertising patronage from the\n\nmerchants and professional men of Cedartown.\n\nThe Standard was founded by a stock company in 1887 and was first\n\nedited by the late Montgomery M. Folsom, of Atlanta, and one year later\n\nwas edited by Charles Langworthy, who conducted it until it was sold to its\n\npresent owners. Mr. Coleman, while still a half owner of the paper, has\n\ndevoted his attention entirely to other business since 1907. The Standard is\n\na well-edited, well-printed paper, its editor endeavoring to give his readers\n\nall the reliable news, with up-to-the-minute editorials, all presented in an\n\ninteresting and entertaining form. Aside from the publishing of the Standard,\n\nthe Standard Publishing Company carries on a successful job printing busi\n\nness, having all facilities for first-class work of every kind.\n\nMr. Russell has interested himself in other ventures, financial and com\n\nmercial, and was one of the organizers, in 1908, of the Fanners and Mechanics\n\nBank of Cedartown, of which he is a member of the board of directors at\n\nthis time. He is secretary of the Chamber of Commerce and an enthusiastic\n\npromoter 'of any movement that will make for better civic or business condi\n\ntions. He has taken a leading \"part in educational work in Polk County, and\n\nfor four terms was an active member of the school board, his further public\n\nservice including three terms as a member of the city council of Cedartown.\n\nHe is the member for Polk County of the board of trustees of the Seventh\n\nDistrict Agricultural and Mechanical School at Powder Springs. In political\n\n2290\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\nmatters he is a democrat, and has long been an active worker in the ranks of the party. Mr. Russell is a member of the Blue Lodge and Chapter of Masonry, of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, of which he is Past Grand, and of the Knights of Pythias, of which he is a Past Chancellor. His religious connection is with the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, of which he is steward and treasurer.\n\nIn 1889 Mr. Russell was married to Miss Susie Robb, of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, daughter of Jackson and Marie Antoinette (Chatfield) Robb, natives of New England. Mrs. Russell is a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and takes an active part in promoting education, literature, philanthropy and civics, being a lady of culture, refinement and extensive information regarding ma-tters of importance. She was president for the years 1914 and 1915 of the Cedartown \"Women's Club, which was organized in 1910 and that same year joined the State Federation of Women's Clubs.\n\nJULIAN HARTRIDGE was born in Savannah, Georgia, on September 9, 1829, and died in Washington, D. C., on January 8,1879. After thorough prepara tion for college he entered Brown University at Providence, Rhode Island, after graduating from which he attended a course of law lectures at Cam bridge, Massachusetts; returned to his native state, read law in the office of Judge Robert M. Charlton, was admitted to the bar, and opened a law office in Savannah. Mr. Hartridge won success in his profession from the very beginning. He served one term in the Legislature, and the outbreak of the war found him a popular and prosperous man. He had served as a delegate in the democratic convention which met in 1860 at Charleston, South Caro lina, and adjourned to Baltimore, Maryland. A Southerner in every fiber, on the outbreak of the war he entered the army as a lieutenant in the Chatham Artillery, one of the famous old organizations of the country, and served in that position until he was elected to represent the First District of Georgia in the Confederate Congress, thus serving until the close of the war. At the close of the war he found himself a young man in the prime of life, but with broken fortunes. He immediately resumed the practice of law. As soon as the reconstruction act permitted and law and order was established, he was chosen as chairman of the first convention which gave to the state a governor who was the choice of the people. He was then made chairman of the state central committee of the democratic party. He was sent as a delegate from the state at large to the Baltimore convention, and was one of the electors at large from Georgia in the famous Tilden and Hendricks compaign of 1876. He was elected to the Forty-fourth and the Forty-fifth Con gresses and while serving his second term, an illness from which no one. anticipated evil consequences took a sudden and unfavorable turn and caused his death. The memorial services held by Congress on February 13th and March 1, 1879, tell at very considerable length of the man and his work.\n\nYOUNG L. G. HARRIS was born in Elbert County; Georgia, and died in Athens, Georgia. He was educated at the University of Georgia, and began to practice law in the then Town of Athens. About 1847 a group of enter prising men led by Prof. Charles McKay organized the Southern Mutual Fire Insurance Company, and Young Harris was selected as the secretary and principal director. The company was successful from the start and he was its managing secretary for nearly fifty years. Although he lived at the seat of the university he took great interest in Emory College, and gave to the college a president's home, and made other liberal donations. He is ' also the founder of Young Harris College, in Union County, as its name implies.\n\nJAMES M. CALHOUN, WILLIAM LOWNDES CALHOUN, LOWNDES CALHOUN. At no time within a period of more than eighty years has the bar of\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n2291\n\nNorthwest Georgia been without the distinguished service and ability of a member of the Calhoun family. The members of three successive generations named above have each in turn followed the law, and in the case of the first two legal training and ability were 'fitly associated with distinguished public service. All of these well known lawyers have lived in Atlanta, and it would be impossible to report, however briefly, a history of the bar of that city without mention of these names. Such were their attainments and such the impress of their service on the capital city that it will be appropriate to devote considerable space to their careers, taking them in succession from\n\ngrandfather through father to grandson. In many intimate ways was James M. Calhoun identified with the early\n\nhistory of Atlanta, He was born February 12> 1811, in the Calhoun Settle ment, Abbeville District of South Carolina. His father, who was a cousin of the famous John C. Calhoun, was a planter in moderate circumstances, while the mother was distinguished for intellectual culture and the virtues of Christian womanhood. James M. Calhoun after the death of his parents left the old homestead at the age of eighteen and removed to Deeatur, Georgia, and for several years lived in the home of his older brother, Dr. Ezekiel N. Calhoun. For two years he attended the village school at Deeatur and gained a fair English education and some knowledge of the English language. In the spring* of 1831 he began the study of law in the office of Hon. Hines Holt, and was admitted to the bar February 22, 1832. Since that date more than eighty years have elapsed, and there has never been a year in that time in which there has not been a Calhoun name on the bar enrollment of Northwest' Georgia. Of James M. 's work as a lawyer, it has been said that he was noted for his diligence as an attorney, and for many years enjoyed an extensive and profitable. practice. Among his partners at different times were Col. W. H. Dabney, Col. B. F. Martin, Col. A. W. Stone, and also his son \"William L. Calhoun. Aside from the profession he was fond of agriculture, and made\n\nthe cultivation and development of his farm a recreation. His first service that identified him with public affairs came in 1836,\n\nwhen he became captain of a company during ,the war against the Creek Indians and was temporary commander of a battalion which in July of that year engaged in a severe and bloody battle with the Indians near Fort McCrary in Stewart County, Georgia. For a number of years he was one of the stanch whigs of Georgia, and though residing in a district largely demo cratic was elected to represent the DeKalb County in the Legislature in 1837. He was a member of the famous state convention of 1850 which was called to consider the series of compromise measures lately enacted by Congress and took a prominent part in securing the passage of the resolutions ratifying those measures. In 1851 he was elected a member of the State Senate. In December, 1852, he removed to Atlanta, and for many years his home was at the head of Washington Street. He was senator from Fulton County in the Legislature of 1855-56, and introduced* and became author of many of the important acts of that assembly, rendering special service as a member of the judiciary committee. He was one of the vice presidents of the convention which nominated Bell and Everett for President and Vice President of the United States in the campaign of 1860. Early in the war he was elected and served as mayor of Atlanta during 1862-63-64-65. During the first year of his term as mayor he was appointed civil governor of the city by General Bragg, but declined to act in that capacity, doubting the legality of the\n\nappointment. Of his subsequent career the best estimate and appreciation are found in\n\nthe words of a memorial adopted by his fellow members of the bar and recorded in the minutes of the Supreme Court: \"In 1864, during the stormy period of the siege and occupation of the city by the Federal army, when the Confederates evacuated the place, the unpleasant duty of surrendering\n\n2292\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\nAtlanta to General Sherman devolved on him. No one can fairly feel, or actually describe the bitterness of his sorrow as he saw the aged, the feeble, and the helpless, laboring under the crushing weight of the exactions, robbery and terror to which our afflicted people had to submit during the occupancy and afterwards. His letter remonstrating against the order of General Sher man expelling the women and children from the city during the hard fall of 1864 will live in history and carry his name to posterity as a man of true courage and generous sensibility. The letter of General Sherman in answer, in which occurred the expression 'war is cruelty and cannot be refined,' con veys but an imperfect idea of the feeling of indifference and revenge with which our sufferings were viewed, and the temper with which the fagot was applied to our cherished homes and rising city. Colonel Calhoun, in the midst of the sea of fire around him, did what he could to support the weak and to aid the suffering. As the city sank amid the lurid glare of incendiary war, its mayor stood like Marius, looking in gloom and despair upon its dying embers. It is a matter of sincere congratulation to know that he was spared by Providence to see the city of his choice and his love arise from its ashes, and again put on the beautiful smiles of peace and prosperity; but from the.tears and sorrow of its thousands of victims of undeserved wrong and oppression the grand proportions of opulence and refinement have returned to cheer and bless his and their descendants. As a public speaker he was earnest, careful, often vehement and impassioned. The latter, however, were exceptions to his style. Pie argued to convince the understanding rather than to. please the fancy. As models for imitation, the zealous pursuit of his purposes by honest means, ' and the reliant manhood of his nature, are worthy of public notice. In private life he was gentle, truthful and courteous, without the tinsel of attractive display in company which is possessed by some; he won the confi dence of those around him by his refined feelings and attention to time, place and person so well that few forgot a first interview with him, or ceased to regard him with esteem and respect. His death occurred on the first day of\n\nOctober, 1875, and he now sleeps in Oakland cemetery, and it may be truth fully said of him that his life, taken altogether, was an eminent success and he left the world with friends, relations, and a great city to mourn his loss.''\n\nIn 1832 James M. Calhoun married Miss Emma Eliza Dabney, daughter of Anderson Dabney of Jasper County, Georgia. To this marriage there were born eight children.\n\nWilliam Lowndes Calhoun, one of the eight children of James M. and Emma Eliza (Dabney) Calhoun, was born at Decatur, Georgia, November 21, 1837. At the age of sixteen in 1853 he entered the law office of his father in Atlanta, and continued his studies until admitted to the bar in 1857. He then became associated with his father in practice, an association which was continued until the death of the latter in 1875. In the flower of his young manhood, and only a few years after taking up the practice of law, he enlisted in March, 1862, in Company K of the Forty-second Regiment, Georgia Infantry, becoming first lieutenant, and later rose to the rank' of captain. He was in the service until the close of the war, was at Knoxville, spent six months in the memorable siege of Vieksburg, with forty-seven days in the trenches; fought at Baker's Creek, and then was in Johnston's mas terly retreat through Georgia, beginning at Dalton and continuing until he was wounded at Resaca, After recovering from his wound he saw some active service toward the close of General Hood's Tennessee campaign, but the final surrender occurred before he could rejoin his regiment. After the war lie took up practice at Atlanta, and following the death of his father in 1875 continued practice alone until 1881.\n\nHis public life was only less notable than that of his distinguished father. He was elected to the Legislature in 1872, serving in the sessions of 1873 and 1874, and by re-election was in the sessions of 1875-76. He was a member\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n2293\n\nof such important committees as the general judiciary, corporations and finance. It was a tribute to both his own ability and his honored father that he was elected mayor of Atlanta in 1879, and he made his administration notable in many ways. Perhaps his most important work as mayor was in funding the city floating debt, which then amounted to $600,000, and which bore a high rate of interest, which by this measure was reduced to a 6 per cent rate. He also procured the legislation necessary for the beginning of the street paving system/ In 1881 he was elected judge of the Court of Ordi nary of Fulton County, and was re-elected every four years until he had given sixteen years of consecutive service in the office. From 1889 to 1894 he was president of the Confederate Veterans Association of Fulton County, and in that time increased its membership from 15 to 700. Judge Calhoun died in 1908, and was at that time president of the Confederate Soldiers' Home at Atlanta. For three years following 1890 he had been lieutenant colonel of battalion, and fraternally was identified with the Masonic Order and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows.\n\nA judicious estimate of his character is as follows: \"Judge Calhoun in every capacity, as soldier, lawyer, judge, legislator and mayor, has displayed the highest qualities of personal 'worth, capacity, judgment, well poised temper and integrity. He is a well rounded character and model citizen. Adding the finest suavity to his force of nature and well balanced intelligence, he has held the esteem and confidence of the public and attracted respect by his unvarying dignity. He was an influential legislator, grasping state ques\n\ntions and a leader in committee and on the floor. As a judge he has been impartial, learned in the law and scrupulously upright. In his. social and domestic relations he is a delightful gentleman.''\n\nIn 1857 Judge Calhoun married Miss Mary J. Oliver, who was born in South Carolina, and who died in 1905. They were the parents of six children, three daughters and'three sons.\n\nLowndes Calhoun, who for the past twenty years as a member of the Atlanta bar has endeavored to uphold the honorable distinctions associated with his name in the profession, was the youngest of the three sons of his father and mother, and was born at Atlanta February 2, 1872.\n\nAtlanta has been his home all his life, and after attending the public schools he entered the University of Georgia at Athens, spending two years there, and after three years in the Washington and Lee University of Vir ginia, was graduated Bachelor of Laws in 1894. Returning to Atlanta he took up the active practice of law, and has continued it without interruption. He has never been a candidate for public office, and has preferred to give his undivided time and attention to his profession and to such duties as come to every public spirited citizen. He is a member of the Atlanta Bar Association, is a democrat, and a Presbyterian.\n\nOn October 12, 1899, Mr. Calhoun married Miss Angela C. Woodward, of Atlanta, They have one daughter, Emily, born October 12, 1902.\n\nHON. H. S. WEST. A member of the Georgia bar nearly thirty-five years, Judge West has filled in his career with many activities and achievements as an able lawyer. He is now judge of the City Court at Athens, and has been in practice in that city for a quarter of a century.\n\nBorn in Gilmer County, Georgia, November 14, 1857, Judge West is a son of Andrew J. c*nd Leah (King) West, both of whom were born in North Caro\n\nlina and came to Georgia when young people with their respective parents. Andrew J. West was a soldier in the Confederate army during the war between the states, and afterwards moved to Banks County, where he served as sheriff a number of years and was also a merchant there. From Banks County he removed to Habersham County, where he died in 1890 at the age of sixty. The mother died in 1911 at the age of seventy-one. They were the parents\n\n2294\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\nof six children, three sons and three daughters, among whom Judge West was the second in age.\n\nAs a boy he attended school at Homer, Georgia, and for one year was a student in the agricultural department of the state university. With this theoretical training he returned to his father's farm and made himself useful as a practical agriculturist. However, he early determined that the horizon of\n\nhis life and experience should not be bounded by the farm, and in pursuance of his designs made arrangements with Judge Button of Clarksville to become his instructor in the law. Every Saturday^ after a week of hard labor on the farm, young West rode the distance of twelve miles from his home to Clarksville, and there recited his lessons to Judge Sutton. It was in this, way that he slowly accumulated a sound knowledge of the law, and after becoming sufficiently proficient took the examination and was admitted to the bar in 1881. Few men are better grounded in the fundamentals of jurisprudence than Judge West, and his determination and learning quickly brought him a satisfactory practice at Clarksville, where he had his office up to 1890. Since then his home has been in Athens, and in addition to a private practice he has filled public offices during the greater part of his residence in that city. For six years he was city attorney of Athens, and in 1907 was appointed judge of the City Court, an office which he has now filled continuously for eight years. Judge West also served for several years in the Georgia Legislature as a representative of Habersham County. His term of service began in 1886 and concluded with the year 1889. The Legislature of that time was notable for the presence of many prominent men, and his early associations with them have developed into many strong and lasting friendships.\n\nJudge West is a democrat, is a member of the County and State Bar associations and president of the Athens bar, and is particularly prominent fraternally in the Royal Arcanum. He is past grand'regent of the state, and is also supreme representative for the state with-jurisdiction both in the United States and Canada.\n\nIn 1887 at Athens Judge West married Miss Marion Lampkin, a daughter of Louis J. Lampkin. Her.father was an early resident of Athens and for many years prominent in the life of that city. Mrs. West's parents are both now deceased. To their union were born four children: Lucy, now Mrs. Mathis, of Athens, was one of the first honor graduates of the Lucy Cobb Institute, and is now teacher of oratory in the high school at Athens, being considered one of the best teachers of expression in the state. Mr. and Mrs. Mathis have two children, Marion Rylander and Henry Edward Mathis. Andrew Lewis West, the second child, was born in Athens, was graduated from the University of Georgia in 1912, and was a member of the class of 1916 in the medical department of Vanderbilt University at Nashville, Ten nessee, taking 1 his medical degree June, 1916. Henry Haynes West, born at Athens, graduated from University of Georgia in class of 1915, in the law department of the University of Georgia. In June, 1916, Frances Marion, born at Athens, graduated from the Lucy Cobb Institute with the class of 1916.\n\nFREDERICK WAHL, M. D. One of the physicians and surgeons of Savannah who have made a successful record in their profession, both by the test of experience and individual merits, is Dr. Frederick Wahl, who was first iden tified with this community as a druggist, and continued that business while studying for medicine in the medical department of the University of Georgia.\n\nWhile his home has been in the South for many years, Doctor Wahl was born in Waterloo County, Ontario, Canada, May 8,1865, a son of Henry and Dorothy (Herber) Wahl, both also natives of Ontario. Their respective\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n2295\n\n,,\n\ni\n\nparents were natives of Bavaria and Hesse, Germany, whence they came to\n\nCanada and were early settlers in Ontario. Doctor Wahl's father and mother\n\nwere reared and educated and married in Ontario, and his father became\n\na prosperous farmer. His death occurred in Berlin, Ontario, May 22, 1871.\n\nHe was then a young man, having been born January 1, 1840. The mother\n\nis still living in Canada, at the age of seventy-five. There were six sons in\n\nthe family, only two now living. These are Doctor Wahl and his twin brother\n\nPeter, who is a resident of Canada.\n\nDoctor Wahl as a boy attended the public schools in Berlin, Ontario, and\n\nsoon after beginning his independent course in the world came to Augusta,\n\n-Georgia, where he was employed as an apothecary clerk. From that he got\n\ninto the drug business on his own account, and while carrying on that busi\n\nness he became a student in the medical department of the University of\n\nGeorgia at Augusta. Doctor \"Wahl w!as graduated M. D. in 1894. After\n\nthat he continued in the drug business for three years at Waynesboro and\n\nat Augusta, and while m Augusta he conducted the City Dispensary from\n\n1894 to 1897. He was also an interne in the Augusta Hospital.\n\nSince 1897 Doctor Wahl has been identified with Savannah as the center\n\nof his professional practice and his home. He enjoys the reputation of a\n\ncareful, painstaking and able physician. In 1907 he attended the Post-\n\nGraduate Medical School in New York City, and has a certificate from that\n\ninstitution. He is a member of the Chatham County and _ State Medical\n\nsocieties and the American Medical Association. Fraternally he is first\n\nmajor in the uniform rank of the Knights of Pythias. He also is a member\n\nof the staff of the Savannah Hospital.\n\nOn October 31, 1900, at Berlin, Waterloo County, Ontario, Doctor Wahl\n\nmarried Alma Louise Illing. Her mother is still living in Canada. To\n\ntheir union have been born two children: Alma Grace Wahl, born in\n\nSavannah August 22, 1906, and now in school; Christina Dorothea Wahl,\n\n\"born January 15, 1909, and also in school.. Doctor Wahl owns a comfortable\n\nhome in Savannah and has a dignified position in the community.\n\nCARL B. COPELAND. The year 1915 finds four living generations of the Copeland family represented in Georgia, and he whose name introduces this review is a scion in the third generation. He has been engaged in the prac tice of law in the City of Atlanta since 1911 and is one of the well fortified and ambitious young lawyers who are making their influence felt in their chosen field of endeavor, his success having been unequivocal and his law business at the present time being of substantial and important order, the while his continued advancement in success and prestige is assured^ for ability,\n\nenergy and worthy ambition all enter into his labors as a member^of the bar of the metropolis of his native state.\n\nCarl Binion Copeland was born on a farm near Gumming, Forsyth County, Georgia, on the 2d of September, 1888, and his earlier educational discipline was obtained principally in the schools of Fulton County, within whose borders his parents still' maintain their home. He later passed two years as a student in the literary and military departments of the North Georgia Agricultural College, at Dahlonega, and in preparation for his chosen profession he com pleted a thorough course in the Atlanta Law School, in which he was gradu ated as a member of the class of 1911 and from which he received the degree of Bachelor of Laws. He was forthwith admitted to the bar of his native state, and has since been continuously engaged in the practice of his profession in Atlanta, his offices being at 407 Gould Building. Mr. Copeland is a demo crat in his political allegiance, is a Master Mason and holds membership in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, as do also his parents.\n\nCarl Binion Copeland is a son of William Samuel and Luella (Abernathy) Copeland, who now reside in Fulton County, of which Atlanta is the judicial\n\n2296\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\ncenter. William S. Copeland was born in Milton County, this state, and celebrated his sixty-second birthday anniversary in 1915. His wife was born and reared in Fulton County and is a daughter of LaFayette and Caroline (Sentell) Abernathy, both of whom are deceased. Concerning the children of William S. and Luella (Abernathy) Copeland brief record is here entered, in the respective order of birth: Warren Candler died at the age of twentyeight years; John Jackson resides with his parents on their homestead farm in Fulton County and is associated in its work and management; Clifford Manning is a prominent figure in connection with educational affairs in his native state and is now a member of the faculty of the Georgia State Agricul tural College at Madison; Carl Binion, of this sketch, was the next in order of birth; and Emily is the wife of Henry R. Harmond, of Fulton County.\n\nAndrew Jackson Copeland, the honored grandfather of him whose name introduces this article, is one of the patriarchal citizens of Georgia and isspecially well known throughout the northern part of the state. He Avas born on the 14th of May, 1819, and thus is in his ninety-seventh year at the time this article is in preparation, in 1915. Notwithstanding his great- age he retains wonderful physical and mental vigor and is still able to give his personal attention to his business affairs, which are of somewhat extensive and important\n\norder, as he is the owner of a valuable landed estate of several hundred acres and is the owner also of a bank at Roswell, Cobb County. He has maintained his home in Milton County from a period antedating the Civil war and is probably the most venerable of the pioneer citizens now living in Georgia. His wife, whose maiden name was Emily Binion, died a number of years ago, and her family name was given to the subject of this sketch as the second of his personal names.\n\nM. C. BUTLER HOLLEY. Much of the present prosperity of the Southern states is due to the large increase in the number of manufacturing industries which have sprung up within the last generation, furnishing greater variety of occupation to the people and greater opportunities for home investments to those of means. In Augusta the wago^-manufacturing industry is repre sented by the large and well equipped plant of M. C. Butler Holley, one of this city's leading business men. Mr. Holley is a native of South Carolina, having been born in Graniteville, that state, June 22, 1879. Both his parents were natives of South Carolina and came to Augusta in 1882, the father, Albert Lafayette Holley, for many years holding a responsible position in the employ of the city. He died in 1909 at the age of seventy-seven years. His wife, whose maiden name was Lydia Catherine Forshee, was educated in her native state, where she.married Mr. Holley. She died in Augusta in 1892 at the age of forty-four years. Of their large family of thirteen children there are seven now living, namely: James Albert, Charles Brantley, Joseph N., (Miss) Eleseheld M., Mrs. G. C. Schaufle, M. C. Butler, and J.' LeRoy. All reside in Augusta except James A., whose home is in Macon.\n\nM. C. Butler Holley as a boy attended the fifth ward grammar school and\n\nOsborn Business College in Augusta, being graduated from the latter insti tution in 1895. He then secured a position in a clerical capacity with a wholesale grocery house and was subsequently employed in a similar capacity with other concerns for several years until he became secretary and treasurer of the Horton Wagon Manufacturing Company. After holding this latter position for two years and a half and becoming acquainted with the possi bilities of the business, in 1911 he bought out the Horton interests and has since been head of the concern, which is now known as the Holley Wagon Manufacturing Company. This industry was established in a small way in\n\n1905 and had had a gradually increasing .growth up to the time that Mr. Holley purchased it. Since then he has developed it into a large and impor-\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n2297\n\ntant business, improving the plant by the addition of modern machinery and doubling its former output. He is also a director of the Union Made Clothing Company, a flourishing retail clothing house of Augusta. For the last three years he has been officially connected with the city government, serving as a member of the council from the fourth ward; he has also been a member of the board of county commissioners. In politics he is a democrat. Mr. Holley is a member of the Masonic order, belonging to the Chapter; a past grand\n\nin the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and a member of the Junior Order United American Mechanics. He is a deacon of the Second Baptist Church of Augusta.\n\nOn January 1,1902, Mr. Holley was united in marriage with Miss Leonora Gleason, daughter of William and Eugenia Gleason, well known and respected residents of Augusta. He and his wife have one child, Arvis Adaline Holley, who was born in 1909, and is now a pupil in the first grade school. Starting out in life in modest circumstances, Mr. Holley has worked his way upward to a high position among the business men- of Augusta and may be regarded in the best sense of the word as a representative citizen.\n\nJOSEPH H. DORSEY. As tax receiver of Clarke County, Joseph H. Dorsey is known as an able and resolute man, one who puts duty before pleasure or * friendship and one who through his honest public service has added much to the prosperity of his county. He was born in the City of Athens, Georgia, September 5, 1855, arid is a son of Capt. \"William H. and C. S. (Erwin) Dorsey.\n\nCapt. William H. Dorsey was born in Georgia in 1800 and died at the ' age of sixty-six years. He was a useful and public spirited citizen of Athens and during many years held positions of trust and responsibility. . During the war between the states he had charge of the conscript office and had under his direct supervision the system by which the women and children of the city were cared for while the men were in the army, and also took charge of the sick and wounded soldiers returning from the war during its continu ance. He had complete charge of the 'city gasworks, owned by Capt. Henry A. Grady, up to the time of his death, in 1866. He married C. S. Erwin, born also in Georgia, who survived until 1877, her death occurring in her seventy-fifth year. They were the parents of eleven children, Joseph H. being the eighth in order of birth.\n\nJoseph H. Dorsey was mainly educated in private schools and was a pupil in the well known school of Rev. H. R, Barnard. Afterward, desiring to be entirely self supporting, he went to work for his brother, A. S. Dorsey, with whom he remained for ten years, when he embarked in a mercantile business on his own account and conducted the same for six years, selling out advan\n\ntageously and afterward leased a grist mill from R. L, Bloomfield.\n\nMr. Dorsey operated the mill and supplied merchants with meal and flour\n\nfor four years, when his lease expired. He did not renew it, deciding to go\n\nout of the milling business.\n\nAbout this time'Mr. Dorsey became interested in a street railway enter\n\nprise -and in fact was the original organizer of the Athens Street Railway,\n\nof which he is the president, and for three years devoted his time and atten\n\ntion to the development of this enterprise. He was then appointed traveling\n\nfreight agent of the Macon & Northern Railway and continued as such for\n\none year, when he went with the Georgia & Southern Railway as soliciting\n\nfreight agent, with headquarters at Macon. Mr. Dorsey continued in that\n\nposition for five years and was then appointed Florida freight agent, with\n\nheadquarters at Jackson, Florida. He continued at Jackson for two years\n\nand then moved to Palatka, Florida, in the same capacity, removing then to\n\nChicago as both freight and passenger soliciting agent. For nine months\n\n2298\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\nMr. Dorsey maintained his headquarters at Chicago arid then went to Indian apolis, and six months later he resigned and in 1897 came back to Athens.\n\nIn the following year, 1898, Mr. Dorsey was elected tax receiver of Clarke County, and this office he has admirably filled ever since, under many chang ing administrations. He was elected -alderman of the First Ward and through his close attention to public needs proved a very useful member of the city council. In 1882, while away from Athens, ten days prior to the election, his name was proposed by his friends for the office of mayor, without his consent, and when he returned he was met by a delegation of such urgent supporters that he consented to run and was elected mayor by the people by a large majority, carrying every ward in the city but one, in which one of his opponents lived, who carried it by three votes. The other candidates were prominent residents.of Athens, Judge Bailey W. Thomas and Dr. E.' S. Lindon. At the next election Mr. Dorsey was re-elected mayor. In every public position he has shown courage and efficiency and as tax collector and receiver has been so especially effective that he has become widely known and through his personal qualities has become not only respected but beloved.\n\nMr. Dorsey was married in 1875 to Miss Sallie Chappel, who died in 1881. She was a daughter of Robert Chappel, of Athens. She left two daughters: Mrs. W. P. Hosey, who resides at No. 109 West Harris Street, Atlanta, has one, daughter, Sarah Frances* and Mrs. Vincent Matthews, who has three children: Vincent, Frances and Chappel. In 1883 Mr. Dorsey was married to Miss M. A. Hargrove, of Crawford, Georgia, a daughter of C. S. Hargrove, and they have three surviving children: Mrs. W. F. Betts, who is a resident of Athens, has two children, Joseph W. and Alice; Ida M., who is the wife of C. S. Compton, traveling passenger agent on the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, resides at Athens and they have one daughter, Mary Alice,- and Elizabeth, who resides with her parents at Athens. Mr. Dorsey and family are members of the Methodist Episcopal Church. He is identified with the Masonic fraternity, belonging to Mount Vernon Lodge No. 22, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, Athens.\n\ns\n\nHON. GEORGE C. THOMAS. Among those who have lent honor to the legal profession in the State of Georgia a place of special distinction must be accorded to George C. Thomas, of Athens, a former circuit judge and for more than forty years identified with his profession in this state.\n\nA native Georgian, he was born in Burke County October 20, 1850, a son of Jethro and Jane T. (Blount) Thomas, who were also natives of Georgia and were married in this state. His, father was a farmer and afterwards a merchant, and died in 1885 at the age of sixty-two. During the war he enlisted in Company I of the Fifth Georgia Regiment of Cavalry as a private, and served from 1862 until the close of the struggle. He was once wounded in a battle in which his command was engaged, and in 1864 he was taken prisoner and was held in the Point Lookout prison in Maryland until the close of the war. The mother died in 1855 at the age of fifty-five, having had three children.\n\nThe youngest of these children, Judge Thomas, spent most of his boyhood in the troubled era of the Civil war, attended school rather irregularly, gained part of his early education in Burke County, later attended Mercer Uni versity from which he was graduated -in 181), and after some further train ing in the University of Georgia was admitted to the bar in 1879. Since then he has been continuously identified with his profession in Athens. From 1886 to 1889 he served as circuit judge of the Oconee Circuit, and during that time presided over many notable trials and gained a reputation for impartial administration of justice and served to give dignity to his office. He was also a member of the State Legislature two terms from Clarke County, serving from 1896 to 1898, during which time he succeeded in having passed\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n2299\n\nt\n\nt\n\nby that body a law donating $100,000, for building purposes, to the Uni]versity of Georgia. Judge Thomas is well known as a member of the Clarke County Bar Association, is an active democrat and a member of the Baptist Church.\n\nIn 1871 at Athens, in his twenty-first year, he married Miss Mary Anna McWhorter, daughter of Moses E. McWhorter, who for many years was a merchant at Athens. Six children were born to their union: Jethro Thomas, who was born at Rome, Georgia, and is now deceased; George C., Jr., who was born at Oconee and died there; Mary, who married H. C. Edwards of Athens; Anna and Kate, twins, who died in infancy; and William Milton, who was born at Athens and since graduating from the University of Georgia with the A. B. degree in 1902 and from the law department in 1912, has been associated with his father in practice, and is one of the rising young attorneys of the state. Judge Thomas in his early youth had many difficulties to struggle with, and gained his education and promoted himself to distinction in the bar through his own efforts. He is extensively interested in farming and has several small farms in the vicinity of Athens.\n\nBRIG.-GEN. GEORGE P. HARRISON had the peculiar distinction of having a son in the Confederate army holding the same rank that he did and having attained to that high rank before he was twenty-four years of age.\n\nGeneral Harrison was born in Savannah, in 1814; died in that city in 1887, and rests in Laurel Grove Cemetery. He was a prominent citizen of the state prior to the war between the states, and engaged in rice planting on the Savannah River, owning what is known as \"the Monteith Plantation.\"\n\nHe represented Chatham County several times in the General Assembly, took an active interest in military affairs, and had risen to be a major-general in the Georgia militia prior to the war. During that struggle, under commis sion from the governor, he commanded a brigade of Georgia state troops, which served in and around Savannah. While on a visit to his plantation at Monteith he was captured by the Federals and held a prisoner until near the close of the war. After the war he served as a member of the first constitutional convention of Georgia, and was for a long time clerk of the Superior Court of Chatham County, serving also for a number of years as a member of the Inferior Court of Chatham County.\n\ni\n\nGEN. GEORGE P. HARRISON, JR., was born near Savannah on March 19, 1841. He was educated in the old Georgia Military Institute, at Marietta, Before completing his course, he participated with the Georgia troops in the siege of Fort Pulaski, January 3, 1861, and in the same month became regu larly enrolled as second lieutenant of the First Georgia Regulars. He then returned to the institute, finished his course, and was graduated with first honors with the rank of captain of Company A. He was serving as com mandant at the military institute when he received his diploma. In May, 1861, he joined his regiment, accompanied it to Virginia, and was made\n\nadjutant of the regiment. He served in Virginia during the balance of that year, and during the winter of 1861-62, when he was elected and commissioned colonel of the Fifth Georgia Regiment. This was a regiment enlisted for six months by the state. He served as its commander during its six months' enlistment on the Georgia coast, and then raised a regiment of which he was commissioned colonel, whichNvas mustered in as the Thirty-second Georgia Infantry. From this time on> he was in active service. His regiment was a part of the garrison of Charleston, participating in the fighting on James Island, which he zealously defended, and part of the time being in command of Fort Johnson, alternating in command on Morris Island with Gen. Johnson Hagood, of South Carolina, and Gen. Alfred Colquitt, of Georgia, as long as the Confederates held the island. In the great assault on Fort Wagner, July\n\nVol. V 2\n\n2300\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n22, 1863, he arrived with his regiment to the reinforcement of the garrison at the very crisis of the fighting and thus precipitated the disastrous and bloody defeat of the enemy. He was in command on John's Island during the several days of stubborn fighting there, during which he showed marked ability. After the fall of Fort Wagner, he was stationed at Mount Pleasant for some time, part of his command remaining in the garrison in the ruins of Fort Sumter, where the Confederate flags floated'until February, 1865. During part of 1864 he was in command at Florence, South Carolina, where he built a stockade for Federal prisoners and had charge of about 25,000 of these, and who were so humanely treated under his direction that when Savannah fell, the family of General Harrison, then residing in that city, were specially mentioned for protection in the general orders of the Federal commander. He was wounded several times in battle and had just passed his twenty-fourth year when the war ended.\n\nAfter the war General Harrison located at Opelika, Alabama, and his' record as a member of the Legislature, congressman and governor was after ward ma'de in identification with the history of that state.\n\nDONALD A. LOYLESS. One of the attractive and influential trade periodicals, issued in the City of Atlanta and covering in its circulation the various com monwealths of the North and the South is the Southern Carbonator and Bottler, of which Mr. Loyless is the editor and publisher and which he has made a vigorous and effective exponent of the interests which it represents, arid aside from this he is publisher also of four other industrial papers of national circulation.\n\nAt Cartersville, the judicial center of Barstow County, Georgia, Donald A. Loyless was born on the 4th of December, 1871, a son of William A. and Hattie (Jackson) Loyless, the former of whom was born in Columbia County, this state, and the latter in Marlborough District, South Carolina. The geneal ogy of the Loyless family traces to fine old Scotch-Irish origin, and representa tives of the name early settled in America. He whose name initiates this article was afforded the advantages of the excellent public schools of Atlanta and later attended the Georgia Military Institute, after which he completed the prescribed curriculum in the law department of the university. In this institution he was graduated as a member of the class of 1897 and he received therefrom the degree of Bachelor of Laws, with virtually coincident admis sion to the bar of his native state. He had previously gained practical news paper experience, through association with the celebrated Southern journal, the Atlanta Constitution, and though he devoted about six years to the prac tice of law in Atlanta and gained definite success in his profession, he retained a distinctive predilection for journalism and, after a careful study of the scope and influence of trade publications of periodical order he decided to identify himself with this important line of enterprise. Atlanta was at the time coming to the; front as a center for the manufacturing of what are commonly designated as soft drinks, and \"he had the prescience to realize that in this field of industrial enterprise was offered an opportunity for suc cessful exploitation through the medium of a paper devoted to such interests. With the confidence of his convictions, though with but modest capital, he established the Southern Carbonator and Bottler, and by his progressive policies and able editorial and executive methods he soon placed the enter prise on a splendid paying basis. The business of this excellent periodical has shown a constantly cumulative tendency under his administration and it stands today as one of the most prosperous trade papers in the United States, fair and liberal in the furthering of the interests to which it is devoted and having now a circulation that extends into every state and territory of the\n\nUnion. Mr. Loyless is a man of most genial personality, loyal and steadfast in all\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n2301\n\nof the relations of life, liberal and tolerant in judgment, and ever ready to aid those in need or distress, though ,his charities and philanthropies are invariably extended without ostentation and with a deep sense of personal stewardship. It is thus but in natural sequence that his circle of friends is virtually coextensive with that of his acquaintances, in both business and social circles. Though never ambitious for public office he is a man of great civic loyalty and progressiveness and gives his allegiance to the democratic party. His business offices are in the Hurt Building, and he and his family reside at 10 East 14th Street.\n\nOn the 15th of February, 1906, was solemnized the marriage of Mr. Loyless to Miss Flora Shaw, of Atlanta, and they have one son, Augustus, who was born in 1907.\n\nDR.. C. LEWIS FOWLER. The cause of education is one that appeals to every intelligent citizen of this or other states, for there are few nowadays who do not appreciate the truth of the old saying that \"Knowledge is Power.\" The State of Georgia can boast of many excellent educational institutions, among Avhich is Cox Southern Female College and Conservatory, usually referred to simply as u Cox College,\" and which is situated at College Park, near Atlanta, Georgia. Established as far back as 1843, its earlier pupils belong to the old regime, to whom it imparted a sound education combined with useful and graceful accomplishments that were distinguishing characteristics of higher class southern women in antebellum days; while at the present day it extends the same or greater advantages to their daughters and granddaughters. The present head of this institution, who came to it as president in June, 1914, is Dr. C. Lewis Fowler, a sketch of whose previous career will be of interest to the friends of education throughout the state.\n\nC. Lewis Fowler was born in Monroe, Union County, North Carolina, Novem ber 17,1877, a son of Thomas Lafayette and Margaret Alice (Riggins) Fowler. His paternal ancestors were among those sturdy settlers of Scotch-Irish descent who did so much to develop that region, and from which stock sprang many noted men. In general they had strong religious convictions, and so we find that the Fowler family produced many ministers, most of them of the Metho dist denomination. On the maternal side Doctor Fowler is a descendant of the McNeeleys of South Carolina and -lower North Carolina, who were French Huguenots and came to this country with the Huguenot colony in the earlier daysof our history. Doctor Fowler was graduated A. B. at Furman University, Greenville, South Carolina, in 1904, Th. G. and post-graduate B. D. at New ton Theological Institute, Newton Center, Massachusetts, in 1907, after which he traveled in Europe, attending lectures at Oxford. In 1911 he received the honorary degree of M. A., during which year he traveled in England, Africa, Palestine and Greece. At the early age of seventeen he entered the Methodist ministry, .attending the Methodist Conference College at Fallston, North Caro lina. He was then made head of the Morgan Academy, at Morgan's Mill, North Carolina, where he served two years. For three years he was co-presi dent of Wingate Academy, AVingate, North Carolina, an affiliated school of Wake Forest College. Before the end of the term Doctor Fowler entered the Baptist ministry and went to Furman University for study. Since that time he has been pastor of the First Baptist Church, at Georgetown, Massachusetts, and of the First Baptist Church at Clinton, South Carolina. In June, 1911, he became president of Lexington College, at Lexington, Missouri, where he served for three years, during which time the patronage of the college was more than doubled. He came to Cox College as one of the presidents in June, 1914, as above narrated. Doctor Fowler is a member of the National Geo graphic Society and is registered with the Independent Lyceum Bureau for Chautauqua and lecture work. He is a noted lecturer and educator. Under his leadership Cox College has come to be one of the great colleges of the South.\n\n2302\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\nOn September 6, 1904, he was married to Nancy Clarinda Hunter, of Simpssnville, South Carolina, the Hunter family being known for four genera tions as one of the most prominent families of that state.\n\nJ. E. DUNSON. For many years the name has stood for prominent suc cess in business and industrial affairs and high ideals with respect to the public welfare in that section of Georgia of which LaGrange is the natural center. It was therefore with great regret that that community was deprived of the services of the late J. E. Dunson who died May 12, 1916.\n\nIn the months prior to his death the people of Georgia at large had been getting better acquainted with the achievement and personality of Mr. Dunson of LaGrange as a result of a sincere and hearty campaign on the part -of his numerous friends in proposing him as a candidate for the next nomination for governor. With an assured business position, and all the qualifications that a successful self-made career implies, with a record of sturdy adherence to the principles which he believes right, with ability to express himself clearly and forcefully in public speech, undoubtedly1 his name was one of the strongest that could have been presented to the people of Georgia, for such a high honor.\n\nMr. Dunson was a man who came up from the ranks, therefore he had a great deal of active sympathy with all classes and conditions of people. He was born on a farm in Troup County, Georgia, June 9, 1865, a son of Sanford Harris and Susannah Elizabeth (Goss) Dunson. Both parents were also born in Georgia, and his father served with a good record in the Confederate Army, was a planter, but never sought nor held any political\n\noffice. Early in his career the late J. E. Dunson chose a course which involved\n\nself-reliance, and his later position might be credited almost entirely to his individual efforts for advancement. As a boy he attended the common schools of Troup County, afterwards took a course in a business college at Atlanta, and his early ambition to gain a college education in the. University of Georgia was thwarted on account of scarcity of funds. Instead of going to college he found work as a salesman and bookkeeper with a supply concern at LaGrange. After that for thirty .years at least he had been closely identified with the business interests1 of the city. The name is primarily associated with the manufacturing interests about LaGrange. He was organ izer of the J. E. Dunson & Bros. Company, a farmers supply house, was one of the organizers of the Unity Cotton Mills, and promoted and built the Dunson Mills, a successful cotton manufacturing company. At the time of his death he was president and director of the LaGrange Banking and Trust Company, of the Dunson Mills, of the J. E. Dunson & Bros. Company, and treasurer of the Troup Fertilizer Company. He owned a large amount of farm lands and might have been classified as a practical farmer himself had other business interests not been dominant, since he was engaged in extensive farm operations in his section of Georgia.\n\nAfter getting established in a business way Mr. Dunson kept himself in close touch with the public affairs of Troup County. In proposing his name for governor his friends had every reason to expect a progressive and enlightened administration with respect to educational affairs should he have been elected. - He was a member of the LaGrange Board of Education and its president for ten years, was a member of the board of trustees of the LaGrange Female College, and also one of the trustees of the Fourth District Agricultural and Mechanical College at Carrollton. For several years he was a member of the city council at LaGrange.\n\nMr. Dunson had not only opinions and views,, but also ideals and princi ples, and was never at a loss to express himself clearly and cogently upon any issues that were presented. Many people knew him best as a public\n\ni GEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n2303\n\nspeaker. Notwithstanding his many talents he had never held any state office, and that was largely due to his chief characteristic of modesty. He came of a Methodist family, was affiliated with the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, and a number of social clubs. At one time he belonged to the LaGrange Life Guards, was one of the organizers and a lieutenant in the Troup Huzzars, and served as a member of the staff of Governor W. Y. Atkinson.\n\nAt LaGrange^March 5,1886, Mr. Dunson married Miss Mary Lee Abraham, daughter of Maj. A. A. Abraham and wife, the former a native of Virginia and the latter of Georgia. Her father served with the rank of captain in the Confederate Army. Mr. Dunson was survived by Mrs. Dunson and four children: J. E. Dunson, Jr., who married Ruth Broome; Florence; Claude and Albert Goss Dunson.\n\nJOHN MEREDITH GRAHAM. Since his advent in Rome, twenty odd years ago, John M. Graham has not been content with the routine accomplishments of the fairly successful business man, but in a number of ways has been an energizer and creator of broader opportunities and more extended lines of com mercial undertaking. He was the founder and is president of the National City Bank of Rome, but his name can also be mentioned in connection with various other departments of the city's affairs.\n\nJohn Meredith Graham was born at Pinewood, Hickman County, Tennessee, November 9, 1873, son of John Meredith and Anna (Wright) Graham. His father was born in Williamson County, Tennessee, and his mother in Floyd County, Georgia, and both parents are now deceased. His father was a cotton factor and a planter for many years in Hickman County,/and died at Pinewood. For four years he gave his capable services as state senator, and was a man of light and leading in civic affairs of bis home state. He affiliated with the democratic party. The mother died at Pinewood at the age of twenty-four. The oldest of their three children was Samuel L. Graham, now clerk of the Superior Court of Floyd County, Georgia, and fie only daughter is Miss Anna W. Graham, also of Rome.\n\nJohn M. Graham, the youngest, was well schooled, at first in the public schools of Pinewood, and later in the Washington and Lee University in Vir ginia, At the age of eighteen he came to Rome, and with a limited -capital invested in the firm of S. S. King & Company, grocers, and in 1899, eight years later, organized the Griffin Hardware Company, both wholesale and retail. This business is still one of the large concerns in Rome, and has done much to concentrate trade in this North Georgia city. With the hardware company Mr. Graham took the position of secretary. In 1912 he went a step further in his business career by organizing the National City Bank, with a capital of $100,000. This is one of the solid banking institutions of a large section of country. AVhile Mr. Graham is presidentjthe vice president is Evan P. Harney, a prominent real estate man of Rome, and the cashier is George C. Beysiegel. Among the directors are the names o*f some of the representative citizens of Rome. What has^een stated in brief outline only suggests some of the more important directions in which Mr. Graham has exerted his enterprise and influence for the commercial advantages of his home community.\n\nHe is a democrat, and at different times has worked for the improvement of city government. He was married at Rome in 1902 to Miss Maybeth Sullivan, who was born in Rome, a daughter of Arthur R. and Laura (Weller) Sullivan. The late Mr. Sullivan during the many years of his life spent in Rome was a foremost business man. a member of the firm of Towers Sullivan Manufactur ing Company, makers of plows, cultivators, planters, and other farm imple ments. Mr. and Mrs. Graham have three children: Laura Weller Graham, born at Rome, eleven years ago; Maybeth Graham, aged nine; and John Meredith1, Jr., aged three. Mr. Graham is a member of the Christian Church, while his\n\n2304\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\nwife is a Baptist and takes much part in church affairs. His only important fraternal affiliation is with the Benvolent and Protective Order of Elks. The one vacation enjoyed by Mr. Graham and family is during the summer months, when they rest and recreate on the shores of Lake Ahmic, Canada, where they have a pleasant cottage home. The success of Mr. Graham is a fact that con cerns not himself alone but the community. He came to Rome with a modest amount of capital, but along with confidence in his own ability had a firm faith in the future of the city, and has done a great deal to realize the possibilities of the situation. His best equipment has been sound business sense and industry, and there is no one who can reasonably begrudge him what he has won.\n\nWILLIAM SPENCER CONNERAT. One of Savannah's younger attorneys, a\n\nyoung man of thorough ability, high character, and one whose outlook is one\n\nof greatest promise and achievement, is William Spencer Connerat, who since\n\nhis admission to the bar has been identified with Savannah's well known law\n\nfirm of Oliver & Oliver.\n\nBorn in Savannah May 7,1889, Mr. Connerat represents a fine old family\n\noriginally French Huguenot but established in this section of the South a num\n\nber of generations ago. His grandfather, Joseph V. Connerat, was born in\n\nSavannah and died at the age of sixty-nine. He married a Miss Palmes. Clar\n\nence Selthridge Connerat, father of the Savannah attorney, was born in Savan\n\nnah in 1849, and married Laura Spencer of Columbus, Georgia. Clarence\n\nConnerat began his business career with the firm of Richardson & Barnard,\n\nship brokers at Savannah, and in time rose to a membership in the firm. He\n\nwas active in the affairs of the Episcopal Church and for more than twenty\n\nyears was superintendent of St. John's Sunday School. He was also affiliated\n\nwith the Masonic Order. His death occurred in 1900 at the age of fifty-one.\n\nHis wife, who was born in 1851, is still living at Savannah. She is a daughter\n\nof-Richard Perry Spencer of Columbus, Georgia. There were three children.\n\nClarence, Jr., died in Savannah in 1910 at the age of thirty-three. Alice is the\n\nwife of 0. C. Drew of Savannah.\n\nAA7illiam Spencer Connerat was liberally educated and thoroughly prepared\n\nfor his profession. He attended the public schools and after graduating from\n\n*'!\n\nthe Savannah High School entered the University of Georgia in the academic\n\ndepartment. He was a student of law in the University of Virginia and finally\n\nre-entered the University of Georgia, where he graduated LL. B. in the class\n\nof 1912. Soon afterwards he became associated with one of Savannah's oldest\n\nand most prominent law firms, Oliver & Oliver, and has been advancing rapidly\n\nin the favor and esteem of his seniors and has done much that is highly\n\ncreditable to his ability as a lawyer.\n\nMr. Connerat is a member of the CM Phi fraternity, of St. John's Episco\n\npal Church, of the Cotillion Club and the Savannah Golf Club, and was first\n\nlieutenant in the Chatham Artillery, on the staff of the late Maj. Richard J.\n\nDavant. He is a fine example of robust manhood, very fond of outdoor sports,\n\nparticularly tennis, and outside of the law has continued his collegiate and\n\nuniversity interests through almost constant reading of history and economics.\n\n*\n\nHENRY H. BLAKE, M. D. Prominent among the physicians and surgeons of the younger generation in the City of Savannah stands Doctor Blake, whose character, high professional attainments and worthy achievement in his humane vocation have given him high standing, the while he is recog nized also as a progressive and loyal citizen who takes deep interest in all that touches the welfare of the community.\n\nDoctor Blake was born in Dorchester County. South Carolina, on the 27th of July. 1886, and is a son of John I. and Amelia M. (Illerton) Blake, the former of whom was born at Madison, the capital city of Wisconsin, and the\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n2305\n\nlatter of whom was born in Dorchester County, South Carolina, where their marriage was solemnized.\n\nJohn I. Blake was a scion of a sterling pioneer family of the Badger State, where he was reared and educated and whence, as a young man, he came to the South prior to the Civil war. He was twenty years of age at the time he established his residence in Dorchester County, South Carolina, and there he gained excellent reputation as an expert bookkeeper and accountant, in the employ of the Grey Phosphate Works. Later he served\n\nas a conductor on one of the railroads traversing South Carolina, and he was one of the venerable'and popular citizens of Dorchester County at the time of his death, in 1911, at the age of sixty-four years, his widow being now a resident of Savannah, Georgia, and having celebrated her fifty-fifth birthday anniversary in 1915. Of their six children, Doctor Blake of this review was\n\nthe fourth in order of birth.\n\nDoctor Blake continued his studies in the public schools of South Carolina\n\nuntil he had completed the work of the junior year in the high school in the city of Charleston, and he then became clerk in the postoffice at Somerville^ South Carolina, the judicial center of his native county. After retaining this position three years he followed the course of his ambitious purpose and entered the Medical College of South Carolina, at Charleston, in which excel lent institution he was graduated as a member- of the class of 1913 and from which he received his well earned degree of Doctor of Medicine. During his senior year and a part of the year 1914 he served as interne in a leading hos pital in Charleston, and he thus gained valuable clinical experience prior to entering upon the independent work of his profession.\n\nIn 1914, Doctor Blake established his residence in Savannah, and his ability and gracious personality have here enabled him to build up a sub\n\nstantial and representative practice and to gain the high regard of his professional confreres, both of the older and younger generations. He is identified with the Georgia State Medical Association, the Georgia Medical Society and the American Medical Association. In politics he supports the men and measures meeting the approval of his judgment, rather than being hedged in by strict partisan lines, and he looks upon his exacting and respon sible profession as worthy of and demanding his undivided fealty, so that he has had no aspirations for the activities of practical politics or for public office of any kind. The doctor holds membership in the Methodist Episcopal Church, and it is but consistent to state that his popularity in social circles\n\nis not lessened by reason of his being still a bachelor. He resides with his widowed mother, as do all of the other children except the second, William G., who still remains in South Carolina. The home circle in Savannah includes besides the doctor, his brother, Robert I., and his sisters Elodia, Cecilia, and Nellie, and the home is known for its gracious hospitality and good cheer.\n\nJUDGE JOHN ERSKINE was born in Strabane, County Tyrone, Ireland, on September 13, 1813, and died in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 27, 1895. His people came to America in 1820, before he was,seven years old. They first located in St. Johns, New Brunswick, where his father shortly died. Surviving members of the family then came to the United States, settling in New York City. Much of his youth was spent on the ocean, but in 1838 he became a resident of Florida, teught school for several years and in 1846 was admitted to the bar of that state. After successful practice for nine years in Florida, he removed to Georgia in 1855, and settled in Newnan, but later moved to Atlanta, where the remainder of his life was spent.\n\nAfter Atlanta was captured by the Federal army Mr. Erskine went to New York and remained there until he was appointed United States judge of the District of Georgia by President Johnson. While on the bench he was the first judge to decide that the legal tender greenback law was constitu-\n\n2306\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\ntional. The Supreme Court reversed him, but Judge Erskine had the satis faction of seeing the* Supreme Court, a short time later, reverse itself and\n\nagree with his original decision. The Reconstruction laws and the revenue laws of that period bore very hardly upon the people, and yet, though he upheld the laws, he managed to do his duty in such a way as to avoid\n\ninflicting unnecessary harshness upon the Southern people. From the time of his appointment as Federal judge, until Ms retirement in 1883, he faith fully upheld the laws and at the same time protected the legitimate interests of the South.\n\nBRIG.-GEN. WILLIAM M. GARDNER, a gallant Georgian and a capable sol dier was so disabled in the first great battle of the war as to incapacitate him for subsequent active service. A native Georgian, he was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, and graduated in 1846, just at the moment the war with Mexico was beginning, and served in that war as brevet second lieutenant of the First Infantry. He took part in the siege of Vera Cruz, and in the battles of Contreras and Churubusco, receiving in the last named affair a severe wound. For his gallantry in these actions, he was breveted first lieutenant. In the interval between the Mexican war and the war between the states, he was on garrison duty at various army* posts and on various scouting expeditions on the frontier, rising to the rank of captain, which position he held when Georgia seceded January 19, 1861. Immediately upon the secession of Georgia, he resigned his position and tendered his services to the new government. He was commissioned lieutenant-\n\ncolonel of the Eighth Georgia Regiment, one of the first which went to the front. At the first battle of Manassas he was* so severely wounded that it was thought he would not recover, and was not able thereafter to actively command in the field. Gardner's commission as colonel was dated from the day of the battle, July 21. On November 14, 1861, he was commissioned brigadier-general and placed in command of the Middle Florida District, holding that position two years. On July 26, 1864, General Gardner was assigned command of the military prisons in states east of the Mississippi, excluding Georgia and Alabama. On November 28, 1864, he was in com mand at Salisbury, North Carolina, and from January, 1865, to April 2d, he commanded the post at Richmond, Virginia.\n\nReturning to Georgia after the conclusion of the war, he lived for a time near Augusta, and afterwards near Rome. From Rome he moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he had a son residing, and the remainder of his life was\n\nspent in that city.\n\nWILLIAM H. MYERS, M. D., is a popular physician and surgeon of Savannah, Georgia, at 402 Drayton Street. He was born at Murray, Ken\n\ntucky, October 22, 1878, a son of Robert Morgan and Margaret (McCorkle) Myers. Both parents were born in Kentucky. His father was also a\n\npracticing physician, but his career was cut short by death in 1880 at the age of thirty-two. The mother is still living at the age of fifty-eight and has her home at Lynn Grove, Kentucky. The other two children are Mrs. E. C.\n\nSherman and Mrs, J. F. Jordan, both living- in Kentucky.

He was appointed instructor in the medical department of the\n\nUniversity of Tennessee for four years.\n\nHe spent three years in the Philippine Islands while the American armies\n\nwere still engaged in the campaigns there.\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n2307\n\nDoctor Myers is a member of the Georgia Medical Society, the Georgia State Medical Society and the American Medical Association.\n\nCOLUMBUS E. ALEXANDER. The colloquial expression that a'man \"has made good\" has a definite significance that fully justifies its common utiliza tion, and the expression is specially applicable in the case of Mr. Alexander, whose advancement has been gained through his own ability and well directed efforts and who, after prior and successful educational service in connection with business colleges, prepared himself for the legal profession and engaged in active general practice in the City of Savannah, where he has won secure place as one of the ambitious and representative younger members of the bar of Southern Georgia and where he controls a substantial law business that shows a constantly cumulative tendency. In addition to his law practice he is doing an excellent business in the handling of real estate, especially in the development of \"Oaks Park,\" a beautiful subdivision of several modern homes built among large oaks with hanging moss. He is known as one of the vigorous and loyal young men and progressive and public-spirited citizens of the fine old city in which he lives.\n\nMr. Alexander was born in Bartow County-; Georgia, on the 9th of January, 1883, and is a son of Columbus E. and Emily J. (Dean) Alexander. His father was born in South Carolina, on the 4th of August, 1844, and was five years of age at the time of the family removal to Georgia, his parents settling in Bartow County, where he was reared to manhood and availed himself of the advantages of the common schools of the period. He became a skilled iron worker in his youth and when the Civil war was precipitated he was able to give to the Confederate States effective service by working at his trade and aiding in manufacturing certain needed supplies for the soldiers in the field. He was detailed to work in the Etowalvlron Works, in Bartow County, and after the close of the war he continued to follow his trade a few years. He then turned his attention to educational and agricultural pursuits. He taught in the schools of Bartow County for a number of years. Be and his wife now reside on the old homestead farm of the latter's father, in Bartow County.\n\nMrs. Alexander was born on this old home stead, in 1848, and is a daughter of Joel Dean, who was a well known and influential pioneer of Bartow County, where he established his home just after the Cherokee Indians were removed from North Georgia by the United States Government. He whose name initi ates this article was the fourth in order of birth in a family of seven children all of whom are living except one, Amanda, the third child. The other sur viving children are: George W., Joseph J., Mrs. Sarah J. Heath, Miss Nora and Mrs. Susan Ann (Alexander) Bradley.\n\nAs a boy Columbus E. Alexander made good use of the advantages afforded in the rural schools of Bartow County, and at the same time worked on a farm, clerked in his father's country store, and postoffice of which his father was postmaster. He completed a course in English branches of study in the Reinhardt Normal College, at Waleska, Georgia. Thereafter he served his novitiate in the pedagogic profession by teaching in the district^ schools of his native county, and finally he entered the Georgia-Alabama Business College, at Macon, Georgia, in which he took a commercial course and became an efficient book keeper and stenographer. After his graduation in this college he worked as a bookkeeper in Alabama for a while, and then taught one term in the depart ment of mathematics in Euharlee Institute, at Euharlee, Georgia. It was then that he turned his attention to commercial teaching and established at Cartersville the North Georgia^ Business College, which he conducted about two years at that place. He then removed the school to Rome, and after there continuing to conduct the same one term he sold his interests in the institution and accepted a position as principal of the commercial department in the Richards Business College, at Savannah. With this excel] ent school he con-\n\n2308\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\ntinned his efficient service five years, and in the meanwhile he gave close atten\n\ntion to the study of law, his reading being directed under able preceptorship. On the 1st of July, 1913, Mr, Alexander was admitted to the bar of his native state,'by Hon. \"Walter G. Charlton, judge of the Superior Court of Chatham County, and in the same year he opened a law office in Savannah, where he has since continued in active general practice and has so used his powers as to build up a profitable law business.\n\nMr. Alexander is a loyal advocate of democratic principles, and he and his wife hold membership in the Baptist Church. He is identified with the Savan\n\nnah Volunteer Guards, Coast Artillery Corps, National Guards of Georgia in which he has rendered loyal and efficient services.\n\nAt ''Oaks Park,\" just without the City of Savannah, Mr. Alexander main tains an attractive and beautifully located country home. He operates his own water works and has built a number of modern homes at this place.\n\nOn the 29th of September. 1907, he was married to Miss Blanche E. Groover, in whom he has found an efficient helper in his many undertakings. To them have been born two sons, Ewell Marion and Harold Joseph Alexander.\n\nHARRY HAND McGEE. A well bestowed honor was that accorded by the Georgia State Medical Society in 1915 when its members chose Harry Hand\n\nMcGee of Savannah as president. Doctor McGee is a physician and surgeon\n\nwhose attainments have a wide recognition and appreciation outside of his\n\nhome city. His present station is the more commendable through the fact\n\nthat as a young man he had to work and save in order to realize his ambition to become a physician.\n\nHe was born on his father's farm in Screven County, Georgia, December\n\n24, 1869, a son of Eli K. and Sarah Jane (Newton) McGee, both now\n\ndeceased. His father was born in Screven County July 22, 1840, and his birthplace was within five miles of the place where he died January 1, 1910.\n\nThe mother passed away June 29, 1909. Both were devout Christians, active\n\nmembers of the Baptist Church, and while'people of modest circumstances they exercised a good influence in their community, and did their very best\n\nfor their children. Eli K. McGee joined the Confederate Army, and was in\n\nservice until severely wounded at the battle of Murfreesboro, after which he was confined in the hospital at Jackson, Mississippi, later transferred to\n\nthe Macon Hospital, and throughout the rest of his life his active career\n\nwas largely handicapped by the injuries he had sustained as a soldier for the South. After the war he married in Screven County in 1868, and then\n\nengaged in farming on a modest scale in that county until his death. After the death of his wife his own health -failed very rapidly, and his end w'as\n\nhastened by the grief at the loss of his life companion. For many years he was a deacon in the Baptist Church, and a democrat in politics. There were\n\njust two children, and the daughter Vetta Jane is the widow of James L.\n\nSheppard, and lives in Screven County about four miles from her birthplace. Doctor McGee as a .boy attended the public schools in Screven County.\n\nHe could expect little help from home in the pursuance of his ambitious aims to secure an education, and fit himself for the medical profession, and conse quently during those years he relied largely on his1 own energies. He sub\n\nsequently entered the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Atlanta, where\n\nhe was graduated with the class of 1890. Doctor McGee began practice at\n\nPlains, Georgia, and remained in that town eleven years. In 1900 he took a course in the New York Polyclinic and in 1903 followed it with another course in the same institution. His ability and attainments had in the\n\nmeantime outgrown the town which he first chose as the. place of his practice. Every physician recognizes the limitations about practice in a country\n\ntown. There is a lack of facilities such as hospitals and the more important cases are usually sent to the cities and turned over to other physicians. In\n\nGEORGIA AND GEORGIANS\n\n2309\n\norder to secure this broader field Doctor McGee in 1903, after his second course in the New York Polyclinic, moved to Savannah, and has since given his entire time to his profession in that city. He is recognized as a man of the higher character, a diligent and thorough student, and has those quali ties which are in the highest degree necessary to successful work as a phy\n\nsician and surgeon.\n\nIt was on January 1, 1915, that Doctor McGee was elected president of the Georgia Medical Society. This is one of the oldest medical societies in\n\nthe country having been authorized in 1804. He is also a member of the American Medical Association and is well known to physicians all over the country. Fraternally he is a Mason, a Knight of Pythias, a Woodman of the World, and belongs to the Junior Order of United American Mechanics.\n\nHe is a member of the First Baptist Church of Savannah.\n\nOn September 29, 1889, in Screven County, he was married by Rev. H. J. Arnett to Miss Anna Evans, who was also born in Screven County. Her parents are James H. and Theresa (Ziegler) Evans. Mr. Evans is a well known planter and banker of Screven County, and the present representa tive in the Georgia State Legislature. To their union have been born four children: Annie Rosa, born in Screven County December 21, 1892, is a college graduate, is the wife of J. P. Boyd of Elba, Alabama, and they have .a daughter Elinor Boyd, born August 30, 1914. Eli K. McGee, the second child, was born at Plains, Georgia, June 30, 1895, is a graduate of the Savannah High School and is now a student in the Georgia Tech. Harry H. McGee, born in Plains,' Georgia, January 5, 1901, is a student in the public schools. Theresa Jane McGee was born at Savannah September 30, 1909. Mrs. McGee is an active worker in the various societies of the Baptist Church, and is also a member of the Daughters of the Confederacy. Doctor McGee is a member of the Sons of the Confederacy, and is well known socially in Savannah, though his enthusiasm and all his time go into his professional work. He is a member of the St. Joseph and Savannah hospitals.\n\nJ. HARTRIDGE SMITH. To Judge Smith it has been given to so apply his natural and acquired talents as to achieve distinction and hold prestige as one of the able and representative lawyers and jurists of his native state, and he stands today as a leading member of the bar of the City of Savannah, where he maintains his office headquarters, his practice being widely disseminated and of most important order. Since his retirement from the bench he has given .close attention to the demands of his extensive law business and has found time also to give personal supervision in a general way to his fine landed estate in Bryan 'County, where he is a progressive exponent of scientific agriculture.\n\nIn the year that marked the initiation of a crucial epoch in the history of his native state, that of the Civil war, Judge Smith was born in Bryan County, Georgia, on the 13th of December, 1861, and he is a son of Henry E. and Martha E.
