        "text": "Paul Scheibelhut is the oldest child of Jack and Pat Scheibelhut. He also has two sisters, Diane and Barb, and a brother, Bill. They lived at 19th and Bancroft throughout grade school and high school. In the three-block neighborhood on Bancroft, there were over 30 children who attended Little Flower, including the Beltrame family and the Tom Griffin family, who were his cousins. Paul says, “It was a great place to grow up.”\n\nAfter Paul graduated from Little Flower in 1963, he went on to Scecina Memorial High School, graduating in 1967. He obtained his Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 1971 and his Master of Science in Industrial Administration from Purdue University in 1974.\n\nPaul worked as a Maintenance Engineer at Raybestos-Manhattan in Crawfordsville, Indiana, after graduating from Rose-Hulman. Later he became a Senior Distribution Systems Engineer at H J Heinz in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Muscatine, Iowa. Beginning in 1980, Paul was a Senior Engineer in Facilities Engineering at the John Deere Harvester Works, Deere & Co., in East Moline, Illinois, until his retirement in 2009. He and his wife Cindy currently live in Davenport, Iowa, with a winter home in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nPaul is an active member of Our Lady of Victory Church in Davenport. He has served in various ministries, including the Board of Education, Finance Council, Stewardship Committee, and as Chair of the Gathering Space Building Committee. He has also served on the Diocesan Building Committee. For the last 17 years, Paul has been the treasurer of the Our Lady of Victory Foundation.\n\nPaul and his wife Cindy have been married for over 46 years. They have a son and a daughter, as well as four grandchildren, with a fifth grandchild due this month! They enjoy spending time with their grandchildren and spoiling them whenever they get the chance.\n\nPaul has been active for many years in Toastmasters, the Quad Cities Bicycle Club, and coaching Dad’s Club Softball. Since his retirement nine years ago, he has enjoyed traveling, bicycling, and spending more time doing woodworking.\n\nPaul says he enjoyed going to Little Flower and having friends from a much larger area than just his immediate neighborhood. “Too many memories to call any one in particular my favorite, but it always impressed me that with over 800 students in school we were organized. We walked to church and back every morning, lined up for recess and dismissal daily, and the halls were always quiet and orderly during the school day. The nuns did have things under control.”\n\nPaul says he didn’t realize it at the time, but after having his own son and daughter go to a Catholic grade school and high school, he believes that the advantage of a Catholic education is the amount of parental involvement. “Our parents helped make the school run. They knew the other parents and students and teachers and worked to make sure we got a good education.”\n\nJohn Traub grew up at the corner of Riley & Bancroft (across the street from Scecina), the son of James (Jim) and Patricia Traub. He has three brothers – Jim ’67 (wife Anne ’68), Joe ‘71, and Jeff ’73 – and three sisters – Barb Braun ’68 (husband Pat ’66), Carol Richardson ‘72, and Susie Kehl ’82.\n\nThe Traub family has a long history of attending Catholic schools. His father Jim went to St. Phillip Neri and Cathedral High School, and his mother attended Our Lady of Lourdes and St. Mary’s High School. His siblings all attended Little Flower and either Latin School, Scecina Memorial High school, or Bishop Chatard High School. John’s wife Kara attended Bishop Chatard and St. Mary’s College in South Bend. His children, Nick, Colin, Kaitlin, and Lindsey, all attended St. Pius and Bishop Chatard, and Lindsey is currently attending Lewis University in Romeoville, IL. John says, “If you add the number of years of Catholic education together (including brothers’ and sisters’ spouses), we have 184 years of Catholic education in our immediate family. Suffice it to say Catholic education is deep in our DNA.”\n\nJohn purchased Thiele Heating and Air Conditioning in December 2006. The business was moved from the Westside to the Eastside (I-70 and Emerson Avenue) in 2008. Prior to owning Thiele, John was a regional manager for a national chain.\n\nJohn has many great memories of his time at Little Flower. On his daily walk to school, he would meet up with various neighbors over the years. Billy, Philip, Colleen, Angie, and Aidan are a few he remembers walking together to the same destination – Little Flower. He also has fond memories of his class of 1980, and everyone seemed to get along well. They had organized singing in the hall between classes in 7th and 8th grade. It was also an athletic class for both boys and girls, winning many division and city championships along the way. John was reminiscing with a classmate who pointed out, “We had full participation for our play, Oklahoma.”\n\nJohn commented, “I don’t think that as you go through your eight years of grade school, you actually ‘understand’ (Mr. Zemelko) the value or appreciate the community, education, and friendship at the time. I believe the older we get, we start evaluating what we want for our own children, and it really comes back to you. You feel the love the teachers had for you. My wife and I very much wanted the same for our children.”\n\nJohn says looking back now, he knows the teachers he thought were mean really just cared about him, sometimes when he did not necessarily deserve it. The teachers would not give up even when someone wanted to slide on a test or homework. He knows he had teachers at Little Flower that pushed him to get more out of himself than he thought possible. “Teachers believed in me more than I believed in me, and for that I am eternally grateful.”\n\nMichael Hassfurder was born on November 18, 1951 in Madison, Indiana to Cliff and Millie Hassfurder. He was the youngest of their three children, with 2 older sisters, Phyllis Wilson and Joyce McMullen. In the fall of 1961, Mike’s father accepted a position with the Indianapolis Star/News and the family relocated to Indianapolis. Living at 1328 North Euclid, he started at Little Flower when he was in the 5th grade and continued until graduating in 1965. Mike graduated from Cathedral High School in 1969 and then went on to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting from IUPUI. After passing the CPA exam, he began his career with the accounting firm of Geo. S. Olive & Co. (now known as BKD LLP). In August 1990, Mike became the Vice President and Controller for Standard Change-Makers, Inc. located on the Eastside of Indianapolis. He retired from Standard Change-Makers in December 2016.\n\nFor the past 27 years, Mike has been a volunteer for the Alzheimer’s Association of Greater Indianapolis, including eight years on the Board of Directors. Since retiring, he now volunteers one day a week at the St. Vincent de Paul food pantry in Indianapolis. Mike and his wife Susan (LF Class of 1970) are members of Holy Spirit at Geist Parish in Fishers, Indiana. At Holy Spirit, he is a member of the liturgy committee, a Eucharistic minister, an usher, and an altar server.\n\nIn his leisure time, Mike likes spending time with family. He also enjoys playing golf and closely follows IU, Notre Dame, the Colts, and the Pacers.\n\nRemembering his time at Little Flower, Mike recalls, “Over the years, I have many great memories of Little Flower. However, the one that seems to be a favorite of mine occurred in the spring of 1962. In 1961, construction began on what is now Little Flower Church. In the spring of 1962, it was time for the steeple to be attached to the building. I recall that all 900+ students got to go outside and watch Fr. John and the construction workers hoist and attach the steeple to the church. It was pretty amazing! Another reason that I may recall this vividly after all these years is that we got out of school for the rest of the day after the steeple ceremony. I never forgot getting out of school early!”\n\nMike feels the education he received at Little Flower prepared him well academically for secondary education. “However, the value of a Little Flower education went beyond academics; it helped me grow in my faith. The school reinforced the values that my parents taught my sisters and me at home—values like discipline, dedication, and treating other people as I would like to be treated, which have helped me throughout my life.”\n\nKevin and Lori had the privilege of growing up together on the Eastside in the Little Flower community. They both graduated from Little Flower in 1973 and Scecina in 1977. They fondly remember Little Flower being the center of everything in their lives, whether it be faith, family, or friends. Lori is 1 of 5 children of Tom and Jerry Watts, while Kevin is 1 of 6 children of Ray and Elinor Johnson—all 11 of these children are Little Flower graduates.\n\nOne of Lori’s fondest memories is being able to walk home for lunch and rush back to the playground to participate in a recess game of kickball against the boys, which the girls always won since the boys did not know the proper way to play kickball.\n\nKevin’s memory is a little different—he remembers the boys beating the girls in kickball! He also remembers the caring and loving teachers at Little Flower who were most often patient and understanding during his and his friends’ mischievous antics!\n\nLori and Kevin were married at Little Flower in 1981 and are the proud parents of Anne and Tommy, who were both baptized at Little Flower. During their young married life, Lori was instrumental in starting a “Young Married Couples” group and coached volleyball and kickball. Kevin served on the Parish Council and was a Eucharistic minister. Together, they were moderators of the CYO Youth Group.\n\nIn 1991 Kevin and Lori moved to Seymour, Indiana where they lived for 13 years and raised their children. In Seymour they were very active members of St. Ambrose Parish. Lori served on the Board of Education, initiated and organized St. Ambrose’s children’s Christmas Mass, developed activities for First Communion prep, coached volleyball, served on the Liturgy Committee, and was a kindergarten teacher’s aide. She also developed a youth leadership program called YoJack for 7th & 8th graders in all of Jackson County that is still thriving today. Kevin chaired a building committee and oversaw the expansion of a new Parish Center at St. Ambrose and served as board president for the Anchor House Homeless Shelter as well as president of the board of Boys & Girls Club of Seymour. He also served on the Chamber of Commerce board and the Leadership Jackson County board.\n\nSince moving back to Indianapolis, Lori has played a lead role in developing and maintaining the Small Church Communities at Holy Spirit East, assists with the SPRED program, and is a member of the Scecina Women’s Circle. Kevin currently serves on the Archdiocesan Catholic Schools Commission and the Scecina Board of Directors. He was recently awarded a 2017 Celebrating Catholic Values Career Achievement Award presented by the Archdiocese of Indianapolis. One of his current passions is being involved with the SPRED Program at Holy Spirit serving those with special needs.\n\nLori and Kevin both remember the wonderful teachers, priests, nuns, and lifelong friends they met while at Little Flower. They have so many fond memories of sports, talent shows, school Masses, slumber parties, dances, and, a sign of the times, when guitar Masses became cool. They are so thankful to their parents for sending them to Little Flower School. They have often reflected over the years that there is just something about the Eastside community that is very special and hard to explain to people who were not raised on the Eastside. They are extremely proud to be from the Eastside and alumni of Little Flower School.\n\nJane Ann Bell was the adopted child of Harry and Edith (Roach) Bell. Her older brother Larry died in 1993. She grew up at 920 N. Chester Avenue where she still lives today. She graduated from Little Flower in 1956 and from Scecina Memorial High School in 1960. According to Jane, she had a good family. She also has fond memories of Little Flower. Some of her favorite teachers were Sr. Mary Donald, Sr. Luetta, Sr. Veronica, and Sr. Marita Rose. She believes her Little Flower Catholic School education helped her become who she is today.\n\nJane worked as a nurse her entire adult life. According to Jane, “I was visiting my neighbor after she got home from work one evening. On her way home, she had talked to a girl on the bus about the LPN program she was in. I always wanted to be a nurse. However, I always played doctor because they had more things in their bag than nurses did like stethoscopes and Red Hots, which were the pills.\n\n“When I went home, I asked my mom how to find out about the LPN nursing program. We looked in the phone book until we found it. At the time it was under the public school system. That started my nursing career.\n\n“After graduation and getting my license, I worked at CommunityHospital for over five years in intensive care until they closed it for reconstruction. I then worked in neuro (which was my first love) and on the medical floor. After leaving Community Hospital, I went to work for Dr. Chester Conway. While working for him, I wanted to get back to hospital nursing. Therefore, I started looking for another hospital. I figured out that if I spent five years in each of the Indianapolis hospitals, it would be time for me to retire.\n\n“While looking for University Heights Hospital, I came upon St Francis Hospital (which I always heard was out in the boonies). If you were coming from the west side of town in a 1939 Chevrolet, I guess it was. When I went to apply for a job, they told me there were no openings, so I started to leave and then they asked me what kind of job I was looking for. I said I was an LPN, and they said they needed nurses.\n\n“In 1966 I started working at St. Francis Hospital, Beech Grove, which was operated by the Sisters of St Francis of Perpetual Adoration, and stayed there for 42+ years (shattering my five years idea). I worked in intensive care, coronary care, and the cardiac cath lab. St Francis sent me to Nashville, Tennessee for a month-long education program to become a Cardiac LPN in the 1970's. So c\n\n“In addition, I have also done some home and nursing home nursing. I helped set up St. Francis’s first crash cart in the 1960's. I had an extremely GREAT career! Cardiac care was my destiny for the rest of my career.\n\nBesides nursing, Jane has dedicated her life to the service of God and others. Because of her nurse’s training, she has been able to help care for many of parishioners who have been seriously ill, especially at the end of their life. She also transports people who need rides.\n\nAt Little Flower, she serves as an Extraordinary Minister of the Eucharist. In the past, she also took Holy Communion to the homebound and to those in nursing homes. She also cleans the Blessed Sacrament Chapel and the Holy Water fonts and keeps the Holy Water fonts filled.\n\nJane is an Oldenburg Franciscan Associate, a Sacred Heart Secular Franciscan, and a member of the Legion of Mary. In grade school and high school, she was a member of the Junior Legion of Mary and served as its president.\n\nErich Bredl, son of Erich and Marie Bredl, lived near 21st and Wallace and attended Little Flower from first grade to mid fourth grade. During those years, he rode the school bus to and from school. After moving to Pittsburgh for one year, his family returned to Indianapolis and lived in Woodruff Place. This was in Holy Cross parish, but he was allowed to finish from mid fifth grade through eighth grade at Little Flower. He rode to and from Little Flower on the trackless trolleys that ran on 10th Street.\n\nAfter graduation from Little Flower in 1954, Erich went on to graduate from Cathedral High School in 1958. He then attended the University of Notre Dame, receiving a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering in 1962.\n\nHe began his professional career with DuPont Chemical Company in 1962 and then worked at Dow Chemical from 1964 until 1978. In November 1978 he founded Intrepid Industries.\n\nIntrepid manufactures polyurethane parts by the reaction injection molding process. Two liquid chemicals are metered, mixed, and flow into the mold where they react to form a solid part. At this point, parts are removed from the mold by a six axis robot. Sawing, routing, sanding, and stacking parts are also done by the robot. They run a “lights out” plant, meaning that employees go home and the robots continue to work through the night.\n\nTheir major product is a safety gate to protect openings at ladder ways in industrial plants. The gate is specified in many company standards. They sell these gates throughout the USA, and they have distributors in Europe, Canada, Singapore, and Australia.\n\nIntrepid has 10 employees and sales of $7,000,000. Of the 10 employees, 7 are hourly. Of these, 3 have been with the company for over 25 years and another for 20 years. Their benefits include a good hourly pay rate, a monthly incentive plan in which an employee can earn 25% additional pay, an annual profit sharing plan in which the least amount earned is $10,000, and paid- in-full insurance premiums. At the end of October, 2015, Intrepid was sold to the employees by means of an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).\n\nErich is proud that Intrepid has shared its success with its employees. He credits lessons learned from his parents and from the Franciscan nuns who shaped his life’s values.\n\nErich recall that during his 7th and 8th grade years, Little Flower had very good athletes and won several championships. They were coached by Mr. Lee Evans (football), Mr. Tom O'Brien (basketball, baseball, softball), and Mr. Jack Hezeldence (basketball, baseball, softball).\n\nHe remembers one softball game in particular when he had just hit an infield pop fly for an out. As he headed for the bench, Tom O'Brien called him over to the third base coaching box and gave him advice he has never forgotten: \"Bretz, don't ever swing at a 3 and 0 pitch.\"\n\nErich currently resides in Houston, Texas.\n\nIn September of 1959, Jane had the good fortune to be born into a loving and faith-filled Little Flower family. Her parents, Genevieve (White) and Michael R. Coffey Sr., four older siblings (Mike ’65, Dan ’67, Tim ’70, and Mary ‘71), and she lived at 19th Street and Bosart Avenue. Along with about 90 other students, she graduated from Little Flower in 1973, then attended Ladywood-St. Agnes, and graduated from Brebeuf. While at Brebeuf, she met her future husband, Thomas Elliott. They married in 1982 and have raised four children together, Genevieve, Tom, Margaret and Peter. All four of them have married wonderful people whom she and Tom love very much.\n\nIn 1981, she graduated from Butler University and joined the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office for a brief stint as a Paralegal in their Child Support Division. From there she went to Baker & Daniels law firm and became their Development Director in 1983. Staying at Baker & Daniels through the birth of their fourth child, she then worked as a consultant for Locke Reynolds law firm and eventually retired in 1996.\n\nJane and Tom educated their children at Our Lady of Mount Carmel School and Cathedral High School. They were active parishioners and served as volunteers in many capacities at the parish and at both of the schools. Throughout Jane’s life the Catholic Youth Organization (CYO) has played a significant role. Not only did she play CYO sports, participate in Science Fairs, and attend CYO Camp Rancho Framasa, but her children did as well. She and Tom coached CYO sports teams at OLMC, and she was later asked to join the CYO Board of Directors. After a brief time serving on the board, she became the Development Director of the organization in 2006 and is still working with the CYO.\n\nJane said there are so many favorite memories from Little Flower that it is difficult to select just one. She recalled, “The late 60’s and early 70’s was a magical time in which to grow up, and Little Flower was a wonderful community of which to be a part. Certainly preparing for and receiving the Sacraments of First Communion, Reconciliation and Confirmation was an integral part of being educated at Little Flower. Those wonderful memories span throughout my time there, but perhaps the fondest moments that I recall involve the fun I had with my classmates and teachers.\n\n“We used to do devious things, like sneak into the fire escape after school and slide down the swirling tube, laughing for hours all the while being terrified that we would be caught. We did heartfelt things such as bring in coins so that we could support Pagan Babies (and hope that our homeroom could win the prize). We did exciting things like play on LF sports teams (often winning city championships) which took us to all parts of the city, teaching us that we were a part of something much larger. We became like family to one another in the eight years we spent at LF. That to me is my fondest memory. I joined Little Flower as a member of the ’Coffey’ family, and graduated from there as a member of the Little Flower family, a community really.\n\n“Not only did we receive a top quality academic education from the teachers and administrators at Little Flower, but we also had the values that we were taught at home reaffirmed. Compassion for others, learning to think of other people before thinking of yourself and treating others the way in which you would like to be treated was a daily lesson to be embraced at Little Flower. The message of loving one another, no matter how much you saw yourself as different from that person, was as much a part of the curriculum as English, Science and Math. Living a life based on Catholic values was integrated into all aspects of education there.\n\n“I am grateful to be a graduate of Little Flower and am thankful to my parents for laying the foundation for a good life. I realize that I am a very fortunate person. I appreciate all that my family has done for me, and I appreciate getting to grow up in the community of Little Flower.”\n\nFr. Joseph B. Moriarty is a priest of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis of 23 years. A native of Indianapolis, Fr. Joe is the youngest of his parents’ nine children and grew up on the city’s Eastside attending Little Flower Grade School and Scecina High School where he was taught by Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg. Throughout his upbringing Fr. Joe was inspired by his parents’ devotion to each other and to the church. His father, a native of County Kerry Ireland, and his mother, a native of Conneaut, Ohio, met and were married in Saint Mary Church, Conneaut, Ohio (April 1952) and were married fifty-nine years when his mother passed away in 2011.\n\nAfter graduating high school Fr. Joe attended Saint Meinrad College and Mundelein Seminary and was ordained to the priesthood for the Archdiocese of Indianapolis on June 5, 1993. After five years in parish (St. Monica) and high school (Cardinal Ritter) ministry, Fr. Joe was named Archdiocesan Vocation Director where he served for seven years. Following vocation ministry Fr. Joe served as Director of Spiritual Formation at Saint Meinrad Seminary for eight years and then returned to school (Creighton University) to get a Master’s degree in Spirituality. While Fr. Joe has spent most of his twenty-three years of priestly ministry ministering to men in formation for the priesthood, he has also served in various parishes and ministries such as Catholic Fire Chaplain for the Indianapolis Fire Department and, in this Year of Mercy, as a Missionary of Mercy appointed by Pope Francis in March of 2016. Fr. Joe currently serves the Archdiocese as Rector of Bishop Simon Bruté College Seminary and Chaplain at Marian University.\n\nFr. Joe’s favorite Little Flower School memory involves his eighth grade play Godspell directed by Mr. Gary Asher. He recalled, “While I enjoyed singing and while my father had been instrumental in teaching me to sing, it was not until my eighth grade year when I tried out for the play that I sang publicly and was affirmed in my singing by Mr. Asher. In choosing me for the role of Jesus, Mr. Asher took a chance on my ability, and this really helped my self-confidence in being before people on stage. Mr. Asher believed the best about me, in spite of myself, and this has helped me spiritually to realize how God loves us. Moreover, the fact that the play happened to be Godspell, I now realize was not a coincidence, but perhaps the hand of God ever directing me to know more about Jesus as I had to learn lines from scripture as part of the script. This experience in eighth grade has helped me to realize that God can work in all circumstances and situations and to always be aware of the presence of God in others.”\n\nWilbert and Mary Catherine Shaver raised three children, Jim (1956), Dave (1958), and Kathy (1962), at 1301 N. Riley. This home was conveniently located three blocks from Little Flower and two blocks from Scecina. Friends and neighbors were always welcome and were always treated to Mary Catherine's excellent cooking. The neighborhood was full of kids who played kickball and baseball in the streets and attended scouting, sporting, and CYO events at Little Flower.\n\nKathy graduated from Little Flower School in 1962 and Scecina Memorial High School in 1966. She attended Purdue University for her Bachelor of Arts (1970), Master of Science (1972), Doctor of Philosophy (1981), Gifted Endorsement (1984), and Superintendent Certification (1996).\n\nKathy met two of her life-long friends, Kate Kinney Painter and Elaine Veerkamp Jerrell, at Little Flower. Kathy and Kate walked to elementary and high school together every day. When Elaine, Kate, and Kathy attended Purdue University, their bonds of friendship strengthened and have prevailed for over 60 years. Another friendship that started at Little Flower was Kathy's association with John Steele (1958). John was a good friend of her brother Dave and spent time at the Shaver's home. It was not until Kathy's senior year in high school that John asked her out on a date. Eight and half years later they were married at Little Flower. They have one son, Matthew. While being members of St. Bernard Church in Crawfordsville, they served as CCD teachers, lay ministers, and Pre-Cana instructors.\n\nProfessionally, she taught for the Indianapolis Public Schools for one year and then was hired by the Crawfordsville Community School Corporation where she was an elementary teacher, Gifted and Talented Coordinator, Curriculum Coordinator, and Superintendent for a total of 43 years. Kathy taught graduate courses in Individualized Instruction and Gifted Education at Purdue University and at IUPUI. She is the author of two books, Creative Teaching and Involving Parents in Schools, and numerous articles, speeches, and grants. Kathy has served on many state and local boards relating to school safety, health and nutrition, and gifted education.\n\nPurdue University has honored her with the Crystal Apple Award, the Alumni Making Indiana Greater Recognition, and the Distinguished Education Alumni Award. She received a Leadership Award from the Indiana Association for the Gifted as well as the Educator of the Year Award from the National Association for Gifted Children. Ten years later she won the Administrator of the Year Award from the National Association for Gifted Children. Locally, she was honored with the Character Counts Educator Award and Making Democracy Work Award. Upon her retirement, the Kathleen J Steele Playground was established in Crawfordsville to honor her for her years of service to the children of Crawfordsville.\n\nKathy recalled, “In the '50s and '60s class sizes at Little Flower were large, desks were in rows, kids went home for lunch, and each classroom had a cloakroom. Daily Mass was offered in the center of the school (now the gymnasium) and was always a fundamental part of our education. You accessed the choir room from the second floor, and you learned a little Latin since the Mass and all the hymns were in Latin. After Mass, on the First Friday of each month, the students were treated to hot chocolate and fresh glazed donuts in the cafeteria, since everyone who went to Communion had to fast from midnight. The taste of this simple breakfast and the festive chatter of the entire school in the cafeteria, while parents poured the hot chocolate from aluminum pitchers, is still a fond memory. Another favorite memory was when John F. Kennedy was inaugurated. Someone brought a portable television to the classroom, and we were allowed to watch President Kennedy give his speech. Having the first Catholic elected to the Presidency was a significant event. One last memory was the after-school science club. Mr. J. Earl Owens volunteered to come once a week to provide science instruction for a selected group of students. His sessions made science interesting and fun. He even organized a weekend science workshop at Camp Rancho Framasa. Mr. Owens lit the creative spark in many students and was an important role model. It was due to his love of teaching that some of us became teachers or scientists. He gave of his spare time to teach and encourage students.\n\n“The priests, sisters and teachers at Little Flower established a strong foundation for our religious and moral development as well as preparing students for academic success. Father Robert Borchertmeyer and Father Edwin Soergel spent many hours at school and CYO events. They took the time to personally know the families in Little Flower parish. Father John Riedinger, the head pastor, had the dream of building the current Little Flower Church. When Kathy was in first grade, she was asked to be in a picture as he showed the model that he had created. It took eight long years for the parishioners to finance the church and for the church to be constructed. The church was dedicated on July 8, 1962 and is still the pride of the city's Eastside. When you walk into Little Flower Church or School there is a spirit. You feel grounded, at peace, at home. You know that you are part of God's mission. The foundation of your faith is strong because of the lessons you learned at Little Flower.”\n\nMike Madden is the son of Dr. Robert Madden and the late Mary Lou Madden. His family joined Little Flower parish in 1956 when they moved back to Indianapolis after Bob’s internship in Ohio. Bob set up a medical practice with two other doctors on East 10th Street, and the Madden children started going to Little Flower School.\n\nMike was the oldest, but was followed by Steve, Karen, Janet, William, Thomas, and Jeffrey. After graduation, Mike went to Latin School, one year behind Fr. Bob. Mike recalls working together with Fr. Bob a lot here at the parish, including work on the seminarian newsletter and answering the phone at the rectory. He still remembers the Mass times at Little Flower in those days... 6, 7:30, 9, 10:30, 12, and 6 pm!\n\nHe went to St. Meinrad for a year, then to IU Bloomington, and after that to Vanderbilt University Medical School in Nashville, TN. That was followed by 3 years internal medicine training at Washington University in St. Louis and then 2 years of nephrology training in Madison, Wisconsin. That is where he met his wife Nancy. They spent 4 years in the Navy and 2 years back in St. Louis, this time at St. Louis University, until settling in Appleton, Wisconsin in 1987.\n\nHe practiced nephrology for about 15 years and then did some administrative work for a few years. For the past several years, he has been practicing general internal medicine at the Partnership Community Health Center, where he is medical director. They serve mostly uninsured and poor people, giving them “almost” free care. He has been blessed with a great staff who really care about the people they serve.\n\nNancy and Mike have three boys, ages 28-44, and 4 grand children, ages 7-20. They have been active in their parish of St. Bernadette in Appleton since 1987, and Mike was ordained to the permanent diaconate in 2002, assigned to his home parish. As a deacon, he assists with baptismal preparation, minister training, and giving the homily at Mass monthly.\n\nAs for his years at Little Flower, Mike said, “I remember especially serving at Mass. We all gathered on the back steps of the old church, now the gym, outside, with one of the nuns, and recited the Latin prayers to learn them. Soon we were serving in the old church and then in the new church, which opened when I was in the 7th grade. One of our server duties was to put up the cloth over the communion railing just before communion. It took two of us and we had to do one section at a time. At least once, I recall, both of us servers went different ways and got to the end of the railing, only to realize the other server was all the way over on the other end! We found out it’s pretty hard to put up a communion railing cloth with only one person! We made so many mistakes that day, Fr. John, the pastor, asked us after Mass if it was our first time. It wasn’t, so he just shook his head at us!”\n\nHe continued, “I believe a primary education is mainly concerned with character formation, learning social interaction skills, and 'learning to learn.' All of that was well done at Little Flower, and I felt extremely well prepared when going on with my education. In addition to that, a Christian school also focuses on faith formation and the development of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. We certainly got that at Little Flower. Even more than that, a Catholic Christian education introduces us to our corporate relationship to Christ as members of his Body, as well as how this causes us to relate to all other Christians. I think all of this was very well done at Little Flower, and it has been the bedrock of my life and formation as I have journeyed on the way the Lord has led me.”\n\nThe Beltrame Family moved into Little Flower Parish in 1953, having lived on the west side for a few years. Father, Bruno, was born in Italy and raised in Clinton, Indiana. He served in WW2 and later owned a motel and restaurant/bar in Casey, IL before running a lucrative vending machine business and then buying into Frank Della Penna’s TV and record shop on East 10th Street. He then branched out on his own to open Bruno TV on 16th Street. Mother, Louise Boland Beltrame, was raised in Holy Cross parish. She went to St. John Academy and St. Vincent Nursing School. There were six Beltrame children with Marie being the oldest, followed by Robert, Michael, Elizabeth, Joanne (deceased), and Annette.\n\nMike graduated from Scecina Memorial High School in 1967. He then earned his BS in Marketing from Ball State University. He has additional certificates in professional selling skills and advanced advertising studies.\n\nHis professional career started in the early 70s in the mailroom of direct response ad firm Len Carl Advertising in New York City before joining the research department of agency giant Compton Advertising where he focused on packaged goods accounts.\n\nMike moved on to the American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA) as a staff executive in the management division for 4 years before moving back to Indiana in 1977.\n\nHe spent 21 years at MZD, Indianapolis’ largest ad firm, starting as an account executive, and was eventually promoted to senior vice president and one of only five owners/partners. He managed more than 40 accounts during his tenure and worked on a variety of large and small business accounts including packaged goods, retail, and business-to-business.\n\nCurrently, as the president of Beltrame Leffler Brand Communications, Mike helps to oversee strategic planning and account services for his brand-based advertising and communications firm. Mike co-founded the firm in 1999 with business partner Karl C. Leffler.\n\nMike is married to former Little Flower graduate, Peggy Branson, and has four children.\n\nMike and his wife Peggy were part of the Marriage Prep team while at Little Flower and continued for some time after moving east to Holy Spirit Parish.\n\nAt Holy Spirit, Mike served for a number of years on the Board of Education, serving as president his last year, and as a member of the parish council. He also has served on the marketing and PR committee, search committee, and finance committee. Mike has helped with advertising and PR for their annual festival for many years as well as helping on various fund-raising committees.\n\nHe has volunteered serving both industry and community organizations through the years. His firm has also provided pro-bono work to a number of local non-profits and religious organizations.\n\nMike recalled, “In the early years, confession was always a challenge. It took courage to tip-toe into the confessional and quietly confess with anonymity even minor offenses. So imagine going into the confessional and starting with, “Bless me, Father, for I have sinned; my last confession was 4 weeks ago,” and being greeted by Fr. Robert Borchertmeyer with a casual, ‘Hi, Michael, how’s it going? What have you been up to?’”\n\nMike is the youngest of four children of Joe and Marianela Urrutia Delaney. All of the children graduated from Little Flower, as did their mother Marianela who graduated in 1944. The family’s home rested on Nowland Ave. between Little Flower and Scecina. Hence, he was raised in the Little Flower community where “I felt like I knew everyone and everyone knew me.” Those who have been around Little Flower since those days cannot help but remember the many volunteer efforts of Joe Delaney, Mike’s dad. Mike currently lives in New Palestine and is a member of Saint Michael in Greenfield. Mike and Lisa have been married 25 years and have three children, , Allison, Logan and Bridget. Allison and Logan attend Indiana University, and Bridget is a sophomore at Scecina Memorial High School.\n\nMike graduated from Scecina Memorial High School in 1983 and received his BS in Accounting from IUPUI in 1987. He earned his CPA in 1992.\n\nAfter graduation from IUPUI, Mike spent two years in public accounting and seven years in the private sector as a Financial Accountant and Controller. For the past 17 years he has been involved in Dental Practice Management where he is currently the Director of Operations with American Family Dental Group (Gentle Dentist).\n\nMike has been a member of the Finance Committee at Saint Michael, Greenfield for 13 years, serving as its chair for six of those years. He is a member of St. Michael's CYO Athletic Boosters, a group that has raised in excess of $150,000 in support of the athletic programs since the Boosters' inception some 15 years ago. He currently is a member of the Board of Directors at Scecina Memorial High School. He chairs the Finance Committee at Scecina as well and, as such, is a member of the Board's Executive Committee.\n\nAs time permits, Mike is occasionally involved in a Hancock County Ministry called Love, Inc. where his parish spearheads the furniture ministry for people in need.\n\nWhen asked about his favorite memories from Little Flower, Mike said, “From the 5th through the 8th grade, I participated in athletics from the start of the school year to the end of the school year. Many of these teams were very good and a couple were City Champions. I was the beneficiary of playing with some exceptional athletes. I am pretty certain that I never played on a team that had a losing season. It clearly was not due to my talent, but that of several others. My mind is filled with countless memories related to athletic participation. Another fond memory was our 8th grade production of ‘The Music Man.’ The entire class of 75students participated. What an event!”\n\nMike also recalled “Naturally, my education at Little Flower was the foundation for all of what followed. I distinctly remember times in high school where I did not need to be all that attentive or did not need to study because I had already learned the material at Little Flower. While I was not always a model citizen at Little Flower, the definition of a good citizen was reinforced daily by the teachers and staff. Eventually, those lessons took hold and it became clearer to me how my behavior and mannerisms needed to reform so that I could become a better person and a contributor to my community.”\n\nMaureen (White) Battles, is the daughter of Kathleen and the late Leo White. She is the sixth of twelve children, all of whom attended Little Flower Catholic School.\n\nAfter graduating from Little Flower in 1979, she attended Scecina Memorial High School. In 1983, she graduated from Scecina and began studies at Indiana University, where she earned her Bachelor of Science in Nursing in December of 1987.\n\nShe then began her professional career at Riley Hospital for Children. She was a bedside nurse for 10 years and provided case management for 2 years until accepting her current position. In January, she will begin her 25th year at Riley. Currently she is Patient Education Coordinator for Pediatrics. She is fortunate to job share her position so that she can spend more time with the people she loves and values the most, her family.\n\nShe married Mike Battles in June of 1999, and they have been blessed with four beautiful sons, all of whom attend Little Flower Catholic School: Anthony – 7th grade, Joseph - 6th grade, Aidan – 4th grade and Wil – 1st grade. When she is not working or shuttling the boys to and from practice or games, you can find her volunteering at school. She was a member of the School Commission for six years and is currently in her fourth year as part of the Catholic School Management Team. As chairperson of the Enrollment Committee, she helps coordinate the annual Open House. She loves to attend school field trips whenever possible.\n\nAt Little Flower, she was recently named Steward of the Month, a recognition for volunteers who provide outstanding service to the parish and school.\n\nWhen asked about her favorite memories of her days as a student at Little Flower, she says, “The thing I looked forward to every year was the Kiddy Carnival - the Cake Walk and Haunted House. It was so much fun. My eighth grade year was probably the best.\n\nAlthough, we did not go to Washington DC, we did have fun — putting on the The Music Man, going to Kings Island and being with all my friends.”\n\nMaureen went on to say, “I believe I am who I am because of my upbringing. My family, of course, had the biggest influence. My parents showed me what stewardship is. They shared their time and talents - in fact, my Mom still does. But attending Little Flower School was also a big part. The school reinforced the values and beliefs I have. I want our children to have that same foundation of faith and values. I truly didn’t realize how lucky I was until I became a parent of a Little Flower student!”\n\nFather Bede and his brother Leo, the sons of Don and Mary Cisco, grew up on Euclid Ave., and both attended Little Flower. He then attended the Latin School and Saint Meinrad College. After college, he entered Saint Meinrad Archabbey and received the name “Bede,” after St Bede the Venerable, at first profession in 1974. Studies in Saint Meinrad School of Theology followed and he was ordained a priest in 1978.\n\nInitial assignments included managing the Saint Meinrad campus bookstore and serving as associate dean of students in the college. Graduate study at Teachers College, Columbia University, led to a doctorate in higher education administration. Returning to Saint Meinrad, he resumed work in the schools as a teacher and administrator, including as Academic Dean of the college for several years until it closed in 1998. After a sabbatical, he moved back to Indianapolis to staff the office Saint Meinrad School of Theology opened to offer programs in the metro area. During this time, he assisted at parishes and served on the Carmelite Sisters’ Advisory Council, the Archdiocesan Permanent Diaconate Committee and the Archdiocesan Council of Priests.\n\nIn 2003, Archbishop Daniel asked him to become the first director of deacon formation for the Archdiocese, and he led the development of the program until 2011.\n\nHe returned to Saint Meinrad in 2008, where he is currently an associate director of spiritual formation and does research for strategic planning in the Seminary and School of Theology. Other current activities include regular commuting chaplain for the Benedictine Sisters in Ferdinand, retreat master, member of the Deacon Digest Advisory Board, and studies for a certificate in spiritual direction. He is a co-author of Lay Ministers and Their Spiritual Practices (Our Sunday Visitor, 2003) with James D. Davidson and others and has written several Catholic Perspectives CareNotes for Abbey Press.\n\nRegarding his days at Little Flower Catholic School, Fr. Bede says, “I don’t have one specific memory that stands out. One is a series of memories around the fact that I was frequently sick. In first grade, I had chicken pox and measles in succession, around the time of First Communion. Together with three others, I made my First Communion when the eighth grade made their Solemn Communion. What I remember most about missing school when I was sick was the care of the teachers in helping me make up the work and get back into the flow of learning. Another set of memories centers on learning to serve Mass. To begin, we were given cards with all the servers’ parts which had a pronunciation guide printed below the Latin text. Our first assignment to serve was to the 6 am Mass. We often helped Father John up and down the steps at the altar.\n\nI have been a student in school for more than 24 years, including eight years at Little Flower, high school, college, theological studies, graduate school, sabbatical and currently studies for a certificate in spiritual direction. My grade school education prepared me well, providing a solid base of learning and the initial base of faith formation. I caught a love of learning that continues and began a faith journey that continues personally and as a guide to others through priestly ministry.”\n\nCharles (Chuck) Finkbiner is the son of Mary Ellen and the late Fred Finkbiner and attended Little Flower Catholic School from 1948 until 1956. Chuck’s wife, Debbie, is a graduate of Arlington High School and Indiana University.\n\nChuck parents were active and dedicated Little Flower parishioners. His father worked on fundraising for Little Flower and Scecina with Barney Blinn and Ed Fillenwarth. Mary Ellen was the president of the PTA in 1953, succeeding Ginny Blinn, the mother of Chuck’s classmate Barbara Blinn Koers. Together they took the Little Flower PTA into the national PTA organization in 1953.\n\nChuck’s grandmother, Margaret Hanrahan, was the first full-time organist for Little Flower in 1927 or 1928. She lived in Holy Cross parish, and Fr. Duffey, founding pastor, used to pick her up and take her home as she did not have a car. She later played full time at Holy Cross every day of the week and on Sundays until 1969.\n\nChuck majored in marketing at Indiana University and continued graduate work in marketing at Northwestern University, Syracuse University, and Warwick University in Warwick, England.\n\nHe was very active with Ronald Reagan’s campaigns in 1976, 1980, and 1984 and was appointed by Governor Deukmajian and Governor Wilson of California to serve on the California Economic Advisory Committee in Sacramento, California from 1988 until 1994.\n\nChuck was instrumental in Catholic high school fundraising in southern California from 1978 through 1996 that raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Catholic Education.\n\nHe was a founding trustee of the Pope John Paul II Cultural Center in Washington D.C. and was able to meet Pope John Paul on two occasions in private audiences in the Clementine Room of the Vatican in 2002 and 2003. He was a significant leader in developing The Catholic Vision of Lead Like Jesus!\n\nIn 1967, Chuck became the second employee of the Indiana Pacers, working in marketing and promotions until 1970. He held senior marketing positions with Champion Products and Beatrice Foods before starting a new company with two friends in 1979.\n\nHe and his associate grew that plastics company from $750,000 in sales in 1979 to $250 million in sales in 1996 and from 40 employees to 2,500 with 14 plants around the world during that 17 year span. They sold the company, and Chuck retired in 1996. Since then he has served on numerous corporate boards across the United States.\n\nIn recent years, Chuck has lent his volunteer efforts to Little Flower’s pastor and administration as an advocate and adviser in areas of technology, such as the school’s wireless network, Smartboards, teacher computers, and the new parish and school website. He was instrumental in bringing The Catholic Vision of Lead Like Jesus to Little Flower first to interested adults through a daylong encounter and then to our school students.He has been an invaluable asset in our efforts to keep Little Flower Catholic School at the leading edge of grade school education in all areas of spirituality, leadership, reading, math, and technology.\n\nChuck highlighted the following fond Little Flower Memories:\n\nFirst grade with Sister Mary Donald and being prepared for First Communion and Confirmation. I remember coming to Mass on that Sunday and all of the water fountains were covered so you would remember not to drink any water before Communion.\n\nHow tender Sister Marita Rose, the principal, was when she corrected your poor behavior.\n\nSister Judith Ann in sixth grade helping me to earn a great report card so that I was out of the dog house at home and would be allowed to play little league during the spring.\n\nThe training from Sister Adriana preparing many of us to become altar boys.\n\n“My Little Flower education has remained with me over all of these years. Those eight years of education have kept me centered on my Faith and the importance of service to others. I remember the sacrifice of our teachers, our priests and the parent community of Little Flower. In some small way I am trying to carry those lessons forward to those I touch.”\n\nKevin grew up on Shannon Avenue, just a short distance from Little Flower, with his parents Jim and Jo Farrell, his sister, Maureen Farrell Sutton (Larry), and his brothers, the late Steve Farrell and Fr. Jim Farrell. He graduated from Little Flower in 1961 and proceeded to graduate from Scecina Memorial High School in 1965.\n\nAfter leaving Scecina High School, Kevin received a BA in History at Marian University in 1969; he received his Doctor of Jurisprudence from IU Law School at Indianapolis in 1974 after teaching in the IPS system for two years.\n\nHe served as a Commissioner in the Marion County Circuit Court from 1975 to 1977 for the Honorable Judge J.

He has been a partner at Cline, Farrell, Christie, Lee and Caress since 1993.\n\nKevin married Judy Allen, and they had three children—Patrick (Rebecca), Kerry (Matt) Abdallah, and Tim. After Judy’s death in 2004, Kevin reconnected with Little Flower and Scecina classmate Beverly Walke. They later married and formed an extended family with Beverly’s son Jon (Amanda) Stropes. They have five grandchildren—Jude, Nick, Georgia, Reese, and Tessa. He also admits to an extended family of six Catholic priests and “almost no convicted felons!”\n\nHe has been a member of the North Deanery Board of Education and serves as a greeter at his former parish of St. Thomas Aquinas. He is a currently a member and lector at SS. Francis and Clare parish in Greenwood.\n\nKevin has been a guest lecturer at both the Indianapolis and the Bloomington School of Law.

He was the first recipient of the Indiana Bar Association Civility Award.\n\nHe is a frequent lecturer for the Indiana Continuing Education Forum, a branch of the Indiana Supreme Court. He serves on the Board of Directors for Indiana Trial Lawyers Association and Community Radio WITT. And just so you know he is just one of us, he holds a membership with Sam’s Club, which comes in handy as he has been responsible for planning the last seven reunions for the Scecina Class of 1965.\n\nThe memories that stand out for Kevin include the Father/Son dinners which included 16mm movies of the Indy 500 and personal accounts from “old” drivers telling inside stories. He also recalls the fire drills which sent students spiraling down the 2nd floor emergency fire slide, and the First Friday Masses which concluded with breakfast in the cafeteria—hot chocolate and donuts—the bane for teachers with rooms full of hyperactive kids. Finally, he fondly remembers climbing over wooden newspaper crates during the paper drives.\n\nPat and her sister Susan lived with their parents at 1505 N. Wallace. She was six when her beloved father died suddenly. Her mother dedicated herself to her daughters and converted to Catholicism, a very strong memory for her. Pat recalls a full life of playing euchre, walking to Irvington library, playing kickball, and horseback riding with her friends Susan Brown, Elaine Zimmer, Ceci Weidekamp, the Steele twins, Nancy Johns, and Jenny Walsh.\n\nAmong her most favorite things are her three children, each of their births a sacred moment for her. Gary, Dawn, and Greg produced her grandchildren Patrick, Griffin, and Sidney. All live close to her, either in Indianapolis or Zionsville.\n\nShe earned her first doctorate from Indiana School of Nursing where she investigated the relationships among combat trauma, fear of close personal relationships, and intimacy. She minored in Human Sexuality at the Kinsey Institute for Sex Research. Her second Indiana University doctoral program focused on spirituality and sexuality cross-culturally.\n\nShe has presented workshops on intimacy, sexuality, trauma, tantra yoga, addictions, compassion fatigue, and stress management throughout the USA, Canada, Europe, and Russia.

She also notes making her Permanent Commitment as an Associate with the Sisters of St. Francis of Oldenburg.\n\nWhen asked about her favorite Little Flower Memory, Pat says, “I really can’t narrow it down to one…I have several. I came to Little Flower in the fifth grade. I was scared of the nuns at my previous school and was delighted that Mrs. Bureker, my teacher, and the nuns at Little Flower were so kind and happy. I felt like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz as my school life went from black and white to color. Some of my favorite memories are working in the sacristy after school, singing with the nuns at daily Mass during the summer with my sister Susan and making rosaries… and I loved playing kickball!\n\nI can’t say enough about the appreciation I have for the educational and spiritual foundation I received at Little Flower and Scecina. On the academic side, I was taught to think clearly, to gather and evaluate information, and to respect others’ opinions. The teachers created a safe place in which we could ask questions without the fear of looking stupid. On the spiritual side, I learned to think of others, be kind, work to make the world a better place, love others and God and know that God loves me.”\n\nShe is currently in private practice, consults, and teaches and continues as an Associate with the Sisters of St. Francis in Oldenburg.\n\nMike grew up as one of nine children of Beverly and the late Robert ‘41 Braun. His siblings are Patrick ‘66, Jeff ‘67, Jayne ‘69, John ‘70, Dennis, Suzanne, Vincent, and Margaret.\n\nAfter twelve years of Catholic education at Little Flower and Divine Heart Seminary, a prep high school associated with the Priests of the Sacred Heart in Donaldson, Indiana, Mike began working for Community Hospital East while attending IUPUI. Following completion of course work for a B.S. in Biology, he began working at Boehringer Mannheim Corporation, now Roche Diagnostics, in May 1979 and will retire at the end of this year after 31 years with the company. During his career at Roche, he received a Certificate in Public Management at IUPUI in 1982 and an MBA from Indiana Central University (now University of Indianapolis) in 1985. In May 2009, he completed a Masters in Theological Studies at St. Meinrad School of Theology and is currently a deacon candidate for the Archdiocese of Indianapolis.\n\nMike and his wife, Wendy, have been married for 33 years this November. They have five children (Justin, Cara, Betsy, Jenny, and Laura) who are graduates of St. Simon the Apostle and Scecina Memorial High School and recently welcomed a son-in-law, Joe Acklin, and two grandchildren, Lucy and Eli. Mike and Wendy look forward to a new son-in-law in October 2011 when Jenny marries Pat McNulty. Mike has been a member of the Catholic Community of St. Simon the Apostle since 1987 and been involved in the following ministries:\n\nParish Building Committee (co-chair, 1996-97)\n\nParish Council (chairperson and ministry rep)\n\nRCIA team\n\nDisciples in Mission (co-chair with wife)\n\nSmall Faith-sharing groups\n\nCYO Athletic Booster Club\n\nCYO Busald Award and St. John Bosco Medal recipient\n\nParish Festival\n\nCursillo\n\nLector\n\nEucharistic Minister\n\nDeacon Candidate – ordination in June 2012\n\nMike’s community involvement includes:\n\nCommunion ministry for homebound and at Community North Hospital\n\nVolunteering at Holy Family Shelter\n\nLeading prayer services for residents at Westminster Village North\n\nTransporting the elderly or homebound to Sunday Mass\n\nWhen asked about his favorite Little Flower Memory, Mike said, “My favorite Little Flower memory is the building of the new church, which was dedicated in 1962. Our pastor, Fr. John Riedinger, had waited for a long time to build a church at Little Flower. And he did wait a long time! We were all happy for Fr. John and excited to be worshiping in our new church. I remember looking at the beautiful altar and the new pews and marveling at the wood ceiling and stained glass windows. And they are still so beautiful today! Fr. Bob Gilday, then known only as Bob, taught me to serve the Latin Mass in the church. Later, as seminarians, we served midnight Mass together. Another thing that stuck with me was that when the bell rang to start every school day, we stood by our desks in Sr. Rose Geneva’s class and prayed for vocations. It worked! Jim Farrell, Bob Gilday, and Bede Cisco, to name a few, heard the call to the priesthood. A lot of good memories at Little Flower.”\n\n“The education received at Little Flower School established a strong foundation for developing a life perspective that emphasizes responsibility, commitment, and discernment of personal vocation. We learned how to know, love, and serve God as faithful, practicing members of the Catholic Church. We were taught that we were part of a universal church and a world where we could make a difference. We were encouraged to further our education in service to God and for all.”\n\nCharley was the second child of Charles and Dorothy (Simon) Withem. He graduated from Little Flower School in 1945 and Cathedral High School in 1949. After graduation, he attended the Lain Drafting College for two years. He received a certificate as a mechanical draftsman. He also attended one year of college at Purdue University.\n\nCharley joined the U.S. Navy in 1951 and served on active duty until 1955 and in the Navy Reserves until 1959. During his stint in the Navy, he served on anti-submarine duty and serviced aircraft engines. Charley is very proud of his service to our country.\n\nOn May 11, 1957, he married Pat Froman at Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral. They have three daughters: Karen, Cynthia, and Tracy. They also helped raise Melody Nichols and consider her almost a fourth daughter. They also have three grandchildren: Isiah, Brendon, and Icely. On July 3, 2009, Charlie and Pat became the proud great-grandparents of Jasmine. Charley’s children and grandchildren also attended Little Flower School.\n\nAfter his naval service, he worked in electrical design for Russell Machael Engineers, Monical and Wolverton Engineeers, Guepel-DeMars Architects & Engineers, James Architects & Engineers and Fulk & Gardner Engineers before retiring in 1999. In 1962, Charley served on the Design Team for the Monument Circle Christmas Tree Lighting. He also designed the second fire alarm system for Little Flower School.\n\nCharley and Pat’s home is next door to the home in which Charley grew up. In his younger years, Charley served on the parish Building and Grounds Committee and worked bingo. He is one of the longest, if not the longest, serving workers on the annual Mothers’ Day Breakfast. He currently serves as Little Flower sacristan and serves ex officio on the Liturgy Commission. Even in this position, Charlie exceeds the requirements of the position. He is present for almost every Mass and Communion Service celebrated at Little Flower, not only setting up for them, but also locking and unlocking the church. He provides the new fire on Holy Saturday. Besides serving as sacristan, he also serves as a Eucharistic Minister and Usher.\n\nIn 1967, together with Mike Shikany and Pat Smock, he started the Little Flower Saint Vincent de Paul Society and served as the first secretary of the group. On one occasion, Charley and Pat took in a parish family of five for three months and allowed them to live in their basement. The father has badly beaten and had lost his job at Chrysler. In the 1970’s, he left the Little Flower SVdP conference to work at the city St. Vincent de Paul warehouse, initially picking up donations. Currently, he arrives at the warehouse at 5:30 a.m. on Saturdays to get the trucks out of the garage and ready for the drivers to go out on their routes.\n\nFor approximately the last fifteen years, he has worked, first, with Sr. Ann Matilda Holloran, S.P., and, then, with Fr. George Ignacio and the Pastoral Ministry Department at Community East Hospital.\n\nFor approximately twenty years Charley has gathered the names of children and sent them Christmas letters from Santa Claus. He drives to Santa Claus, Indiana, to postmark the letters by hand. For the last couple of years, Charley has sent Christmas letters to almost 250 children.\n\nCharley enjoys Cathedral High School Football games and photography. In his younger years, he enjoyed camping and traveling and comments that he has visited every continent except Antarctica. He has served as part of the color guard for the Knights of Columbus and the Ancient Order of Hibernians.\n\n“Little Flower School Memory: What comes to mind at first is my First Grade teacher, Sr. Ernesta, and my Eighth Grade teacher, Sr. Patricia, who also taught my mother. She loved to teach boys because she could be physical. Not that I had that experience. A memory best remembered is when I first served at Mass with my friend Robert Simon, who is still my best friend.\n\nValue of Education at Little Flower: The value of the education given to me at Little Flower is that it taught me the basics of life and how to conduct yourself in whatever you are confronted with. It also taught me to respect others and to treat others as you wish to be treated.”\n\nBorn and baptized in 1946 in the community of Holy Cross Parish, Tom Burke followed in the footsteps of his four siblings. In 1951 his family moved to Grant Street in the Little Flower neighborhood, and it was here that he began his elementary education. At Little Flower School he formed many friendships, served as an altar boy, sang in the school choir, and performed such other chores as selling milk at lunch and cleaning the erasers (a matter of being at the right place at the right time….). A normal happy childhood!\n\nAt this time he was gaining his first work experience delivering The Indianapolis News. Once when he should have been home from his route, he was found sitting on the porch of a lonely elderly customer lending a friendly ear. This scene was repeated often.\n\nAfter graduating from Little Flower in 1960, Tom attended Scecina Memorial High School. While there, he was active in the Explorer Scouts sponsored by Indiana Bell and served as president of the group. He helped pay his school tuition by working afternoons and weekends at Community Hospital. Graduation from Scecina was in 1964.\n\nAt the University of Dayton, where he majored in economics, Tom participated in the Union Activities Committee, co-chairing the Hospitality Committee and helping to form the International Committee, which hosted dinners and sponsored activities to make the international students feel at home. It was at UD that he met Joan Stell, whom he married in 1970.\n\nTom joined AFNB after graduating from Dayton in 1968. His career began in the Banking Centers, but he soon moved on to the Commercial Credit Department, working in such varied areas as manager of credit information and later as software support for commercial lending products.\n\nTom has volunteered on such other projects as the following:\n\nJunior Achievement Company advisor\n\nSERTOMA (Service to Mankind) Club of North Indianapolis, which has raised over $500,000 for the Crossroads Rehabilitation Center in the 38 years he has been a member\n\nPast member of the Board of Directors of the Italian Heritage Society of Indiana\n\nMission trip to Honduras in 2001\n\nSeven trips to the Gulf Coast to do reconstruction after Katrina and Rita\n\nHelped build over 30 houses with Habitat in Indianapolis\n\nIn addition to building homes for Habitat, Tom is a member of the core group of Habitat volunteers, fondly known as the “Tigers.” They meet weekly throughout the year to organize and prepare materials for the many builds in the city.\n\nTom has been a member of Little Flower Parish for over 55 years, a testament to his belief in his home parish. He has had the opportunity to lend his time and talents in many endeavors. Early on, he sang in the choir and served multiple terms on the Parish Council and the School Board. Currently, he is a member of the Finance Commission, a position that he also held previously. In addition, he assists in the weekly counting of the Sunday collection.\n\nLike their father, Tom and Joan’s three children, Chris, Greg, and Kat, all attended and graduated from Little Flower School. They, too, received a sound religious educational background in a secure learning environment.\n\nTom’s memories from Little Flower School include:\n\nDaily attendance at Mass\n\n“Cricket,” used by the nuns to inform the students when it was time to genuflect\n\nFirst Friday breakfasts of donuts and hot chocolate, with the entire school sitting at long tables that stretched from one end of the cafeteria to the other\n\n“Brown bag” lunches in the classroom and the privilege of buying chocolate milk\n\nRecess on two gravel parking lots\n\nFather John distributing report cards, commentating on grades and conduct marks (not always a pleasant experience!)\n\nYearly Christmas parties that ended with Santa passing out boxes of hard candy, followed by early dismissal from school\n\nIn reflecting on his Little Flower Education, Tom said: “I was always aware that there were many students in each of my classes, but in looking back at class pictures, I have counted over 45 students in a classroom. By today’s standards, one teacher for that number of students would be unthinkable! Yet the teachers of my classes, most of them nuns, found a way to care about each and every student. They reinforced the lessons taught at home and showed us the importance of having respect and consideration for others, traits not only important during those school years but for all of life as well.”\n\nThomas Francis O’Gara was born on November 24, 1970. He is the fourth child of Thomas J. and Jeanne (Mayer) O’Gara’s five children. All five children are graduates of Little Flower School: Mary Jeanne Burger (’79), Karen Hartnett (’81), Kathleen Johnson (’83), Tom (’84), and John (’86). Like his siblings, Tom attended Scecina Memorial High School where he was a Co-Salutatorian in the Class of ‘88. During his senior year at Scecina, Tom was the captain of the school’s first team to win the Brain Game Championship on WTHR-13. After high school, Tom attended DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana where he received his Bachelor’s Degree magna cum laude and was named a member of the academic honorary fraternity Phi Beta Kappa in 1992.\n\nAfter college Tom accepted an offer from a lay Catholic organization to teach English at Biskupske Gymnazium, a Catholic middle school/high school, in the Czech town of Ceske Budejovice. Tom was the first American to teach at this Catholic school which was opened in 1990 shortly after the fall of the Communist government in Czechoslovakia in December 1989. Tom taught at Biskupske Gymnazium during the 1992-93 and 1996-97 school years.\n\nBetween his stints teaching English in the Czech Republic, Tom attended the Indiana University School of Law in Indianapolis where he received his J.D. summa cum laude in 1996. Tom was admitted to the Indiana bar in 1996 and has practiced law in Indianapolis since 1997. He is admitted to practice in both the state and federal courts in Indiana. Tom is currently a partner in the Indianapolis office of Taft Stettinius & Hollister, which was previously known as Sommer Barnard. He concentrates his practice on complex civil, commercial, and environmental litigation and frequently represents policyholders in insurance coverage disputes.\n\nOn November 23, 2002, Tom married Elizabeth Walsh at St. John the Evangelist Church in Indianapolis. Elizabeth is the daughter of Patrick and Maria Walsh of St. Michael the Archangel Parish in Indianapolis and the fourth of their five children. Elizabeth and Tom are the very blessed and proud parents of three beautiful children: Danny, Claire, and Tommy. Tom and Elizabeth also have sixteen terrific nieces and nephews. Elizabeth, Tom, and their children are currently members of St. Pius X Parish in Indianapolis.\n\nTom has coached CYO Boys’ Basketball at Little Flower every year since 1997. In 2006, his team won the Cadet A National Deanery Post-Season Tournament and advanced to the Archdiocesan Championships, which was far better than any basketball team Tom played on did while he was a student at Little Flower. Tom also served on the Scecina Board of Directors from 1999 to 2008 and was a member of the Board’s Executive Committee five of those years.\n\nWhile Tom has many wonderful memories of his eight years at Little Flower, two in particular stand out. During the school awards night while Tom was in 4th grade, the pastor, Fr. Schmidt, whispered something to Tom that made him laugh when he received an award. Fr. Schmidt then told the congregation, “I told Tom, ‘Thank God that your mother’s good German brains came through,’” much to his mother’s delight. Another of Tom’s favorite memories was from the school Spelling Bee when he was in 5th grade. Tom and his good friend and classmate Tim Dailey finished first and second that year. Tom still remembers running from the library, sliding into Mrs. Hankee’s class, and declaring the news of his victory to his classmates.\n\nTom is extremely grateful to his parents for making the decision and sacrifice to send him to Little Flower. He still appreciates the teachers and administrators who helped provide the educational foundation for his future academic and professional success. In addition to the academic instruction, Tom is particularly thankful for the Catholic values that were taught and served as the basis for Little Flower School then as they do now. Through Little Flower Tom was introduced to and became part of a larger community of Christian believers for the first time. Little Flower taught him about our Catholic faith, God’s love for us, loving our neighbors, and the promise of salvation in Jesus Christ through prayer, music, school and class Masses, religion class, and preparation for the sacraments of First Holy Communion and Reconciliation.\n\nTom still feels a strong connection to the Little Flower family, not just because he was one of five siblings or nearly three dozen cousins to attend the school or because his classmate Shawn Murphy was the Best Man in his wedding, but because of that feeling of Christian community he first learned there. Tom sends a special thanks to all of his friends and classmates from the Class of 1984 for the memories they made and experiences they shared, even the ones that some of their teachers and principals did not like at the time, of which there were more than a few. Because of Tom’s experiences at Little Flower and Scecina, Tom is and will always be an ardent supporter of Catholic schools.\n\nSo much has happened to me since my graduation from Little Flower in 1945, but I feel as if I am just getting started! I attended Immaculate Conception Academy in Oldenburg, IN, graduating in 1949. Marian College beckoned, and I began my college education there. Being called to religious life, I entered the Sisters of St. Francis in 1950, and continued my undergraduate work there. It took me ten years, since I began teaching in 1952 and went to school only in the summers. (No degree was necessary in Catholic Schools at that time).\n\nMy work with elementary school children began in Cincinnati, Ohio where I taught grades one and two for six years. Then off to St. Louis, Missouri for ten years where teaching grades two through eight was my work. It was there that I studied at St. Louis University in the summers, and earned a Masters Degree in Elementary School Administration.\n\nIn 1966, I returned to Cincinnati to be a terrified Principal at Corpus Christi School. Happily, things went well for the next 6 years. At that time six years was the limit for principals, so my community called me to take a position with the Indianapolis Archdiocese as Consultant for elementary schools, a position I held for four years when I resigned. I knew I was not effective as a consultant, so I chose to withdraw rather than inflict myself on so many worthy educators.\n\nBack in Cincinnati again, I happily taught third graders for a year. Then I was assigned to St. Louis Elementary School in Batesville, Indiana as principal. What a great time that was! Because of some health problems, I left that position for a sabbatical, which became an educational sabbatical.\n\nAttending Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana was an eye-opening time for me. Three women from very diverse backgrounds were my roommates at different times: one a woman on parole for the wrongful death of her son, one a biochemist from Naples, Italy, and one a young Korean woman who treated me like royalty. It was a very interesting time. I loved my work with the children in the research lab, and felt honored to be asked to take a position with Purdue as Infant Lab Director. I was not ready to be working in a University, so I declined. I received a Masters Degree in Child Development focused on Parent Education. I hoped to teach parents what we had learned in teacher education, but no one was ready to hire for that position, and when services were offered, few came. After six months part-time employment by the Family Life Office of the Indianapolis Archdiocese, I took a position as teacher at St. Monica's in Indianapolis. The children, the teachers, and the principal were wonderful, but I still wanted to use the education I had, so I looked for other work.\n\nA perfect place opened up for me in Gaylord, Michigan. I became the Family Life Director through Social Services at the diocesan level. The work covered a wide gamut of ministries, which I like to call pre-birth to post-death. My staff and I covered Natural Family Planning, Marriage, Parenting, Aging, Death, and Grieving.\n\nMy mother became ill, so I came back to Indianapolis and took a position in childcare for a corporation in Fishers, Indiana. Mom got worse, and my wonderful community of Sisters of St. Francis told me to leave my work in childcare and make Mom my ministry. Mom died in 1997, but I had been able to give her daily care at home, in the hospital and in the nursing home. My gratitude to my community has no bounds.\n\nAfter a period of grieving, I applied and received the position of Family Life Director for the diocese of Wheeling, West Virginia, a diocese which covers the entire state. My work there was similar to the work in Gaylord. The most notable event there was the Golden + Celebration where we had more than 800 couples married 50 years or more join in celebrating. We needed three different locations. The total number of years of marriage was displayed on a large banner that said: “CELEBRATING OVER 4000 YEARS OF MARRIAGE IN THE DIOCESE OF WHEELING, WEST VIRGINIA.” Changes at the diocesan level, however, brought me back to Indianapolis after two years.\n\nIn 1999, I worked with Fr. Bede Cisco, OSB to set up the office in Indianapolis for a branch of the School of Theology from St. Meinrad. It was a wonderful experience, but age was beginning to tell on me, so I \"retired.\" At least I did not work outside my convent home.\n\nAn ad I found in the National Catholic Reporter said the parish of St. Mary's Mission was looking for a principal for their Catholic School on Red Lake Indian Reservation. My mother had instilled in me a love for the Indian Culture, and here was a way I could experience it first hand. I was not looking for a principal's position, but this was like a dream come true. There were sixty children, six teachers, and six grades. Usually in a small school, the principal was also teacher. That was not the case here.\n\nSo I inquired, went to Minnesota for the interview, and, despite my age, was hired. I spent almost five years in Red Lake, and I would still love to be there. Ministry is needed so much on that reservation, which is where the troubled young teenager shot five children, four adults, and himself five years ago. My age prevents me from returning there now, but my heart is still with those marvelous children, who are so much in need.\n\nI required shoulder surgery, so I came home to Oldenburg, where the best care in the world was given to me. I am still completing therapy on the shoulder. When that is complete, I will look for work as a tutor in an elementary school. Who knows, maybe Little Flower!\n\nThere are many memories that I cherish, but this is the one I return to often: the Little Flower Novena. I loved the hymns, the processions, St. Therese. The beauty of all those roses on the altar and the scent that filled the church are still very special to me. Many of my classmates must have felt the same because all the girls took Therese for their Confirmation names except one. Therese Lenahan was lucky enough to have the name from Baptism. In school, I can remember how wonderful it was to march, eight in a row, down those wide steps at the end of the day. I felt like I was part of a very BIG thing. However, there were so many memories such as:\n\nFirst Friday donuts and milk\n\nMay Crowning\n\nCovered drinking fountains on First Communion Day\n\nA grotto for our classroom statue of Mary made of rocks we brought to school\n\nSpelling Bees\n\nHoly Picture Awards\n\nCandy sold at recess\n\nMy Dad used to greet every one of his nieces with a warm \"Hello to my favorite niece.\" I feel the same way, \"How can I pick out one favorite memory when I have soooo many.”\n\nThe faith instilled in me at home was greatly reinforced at school. I learned that mistakes can be forgiven, that sometimes people who are in charge make mistakes, that it doesn't take too much courage to stand up for what you believe is right when you witness injustice or blatant misbehavior. I even learned to forge ahead when things have gone wrong. I remember each one of my teachers, (they were all Sisters), and each made her mark on me. The diversity among those of us in the class of 1945 has served me well in my life's journey. The range of differences among us has helped me in the work I have done with children and with adults. Just do the best with what you have, and let God do the rest.\n\nBorn in 1930 and baptized at Our Lady of Lourdes Parish, Jack’s family moved in 1938 to 1308 N Drexel Avenue, a house that would remain in his family for the next 47 years. He graduated in 1944 from Little Flower Grade School and attended Cathedral High School, from which he graduated in 1948. He attended the University of Notre Dame where he received his undergraduate degree in 1952 and a law degree in 1954. He became a law clerk for the late Judge Charles Fahy of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, after which he served two years in active duty for the United States Navy. In 1957 he returned home to Indianapolis to enter private law practice with the firm of McHale, Cook & Welch.\n\nHe was elected to the House of Representatives of the Indiana General Assembly in 1958 and served a two-year term. He remained active in Democratic party politics for a number of years and was closely involved in the successful campaigns of Senator Birch Bayh and President Lyndon Johnson and for the Indiana campaign for President John F. Kennedy. In 1968 he was appointed by the federal court in Indianapolis as receiver for two bankrupt real estate trusts whose reorganization he supervised over a period of several years, resulting in the creation of Century Realty Trust. Under his leadership as President and CEO, Century became a very successful enterprise which was finally liquidated at a substantial profit in 2006.\n\nHe was chairman of the Board of Directors of Cathedral High School from 1997 to 2002 and received the school’s award for distinguished professional achievement in 1998. During his tenure as board chair, the school began a $15 million capital campaign, the largest in the school’s history, and it was successfully concluded ahead of schedule.\n\nHe is past president of the Notre Dame Club of Indianapolis and was named as the club’s man of the year in 1999.\n\nIn 1968 he married Dr. Patricia Mosely of Los Angeles, CA, and they settled in Immaculate Heart of Mary Parish. All five of their children graduated from Immaculate Heart of Mary Grade School, Cathedral High School, and the University of Notre Dame. His oldest grandchild also graduated from Immaculate Heart grade school and is now a freshman at Cathedral.\n\nWhen asked about his years at Little Flower, Jack said, “Our 8th grade class had over 60 pupils and one teacher, Sister Patricia, O.S.F. Of necessity, she had to be a strict disciplinarian, and she was. The boy I sat next to and I were frequently gabbing with each other. Sr. Patricia became increasing exasperated with the two of us. One day she descended upon us for a royal scolding, and before making me go sit with the girls for a while, she said, ’You two boys are talking entirely too much, especially when you should be listening instead of talking. One of you should become a lawyer and one of you should become a priest, but right now I can’t tell which is which.’ It turned out she was very prophetic. The other boy was Don Schmidlin, who became a priest in the Indianapolis Archdiocese, and I became a lawyer. We both still talk too much.\n\nMy roots, my very deepest roots, are at LF School and Parish. The school, the parish, and even the neighborhood constituted my entire world as I was growing up. The teachers, priests, and classmate I had at LF are as vivid in my memory today as they were over 60 years ago. The formation, structure, discipline, and education that I received at LF prepared me not just for high school—which LF prepared me for very well—but for life.\n\nIn June of 1969, Sandy moved with her four siblings, Pat ’74, Dan ‘75, Michele ‘77, and Brian ‘83, and her parents, Jim ‘47 and Laura Hawkins, into the house at 1116 N. Linwood where her father had been raised. That fall her parents sent her older siblings to Little Flower School, and three years later it was time for Sandy to enroll at her father’s alma mater. She graduated from Little Flower in 1980 and went on to graduate from Thomas Carr Howe High School in 1984, where she earned twelve varsity letters in volleyball, basketball, and softball, and made it to the 1983 Indiana Girl’s State Basketball Finals. She was nominated for the Marion County Coaches Girls’ Sports and Indianapolis Star’s City Athlete of the Year in 1984. She also excelled academically at Howe, graduating in the top 1% of her class of 300, and earning the American Legion Award and Daughters of the American Revolution Award. She continued her education at Butler University where she was a member of the softball team for two years and played four years on the Lady Bulldogs’ basketball team. She earned the Tony Hinkle Best Mental Attitude award both her junior and senior years along with All-Academic Team honors. She graduated with a B.S. in Education in 1988.\n\nAfter graduation, on July 29, 1988, she married Paul, her high school sweetheart of 7 ½ years, and settled into their first home on Linwood Avenue. She was hired by the Lawrence Township School District to be a First Grade Teacher's Assistant for At-Risk students at Harrison Hill Elementary. The next two summers, she had the opportunity to coach her first team when she managed a girl’s softball team at Community Little League. In the fall of 1989 she assumed a third grade teaching position at Harrison Hill. She continued to teach third grade, coach the Math Pentathlon Team, and sponsor the Student Council until 1997. At that time, she and Paul decided that it would be best for their family if she stayed home with their two young daughters, Nikki, ’06 and Jackie. However, it wasn’t long before she was back in the classroom helping out in Nikki’s Little Flower kindergarten class. She continued to volunteer at Little Flower doing small things such as field trips, recess duty, room parent, and room volunteer and continued to help out after the birth of Andrew, their third child.\n\nIt didn’t take long before volunteering at Little Flower become her new job. She has worn many hats at Little Flower, including substitute teaching, tutoring, working with Reader’s Theatre productions, helping with the yearbook, working concession stands, and scoring for basketball and volleyball games. She has chaired the Kid’s Games and Activities at the best parish festival in town, Little Flower’s Summerfest, co-chaired the Children’s Activities for the 2005 Capital Campaign Legacy For Our Mission, and served as chairperson for the PTO Hobby Show. She currently is in charge of the PTO sponsored Honor Roll Recognition, coaches kickball and volleyball, helps to decorate the church for Christmas, devotes time weekly to the Adoration Chapel, serves as a catechist for Children’s Liturgy, and volunteers at St. Vincent DePaul. In 2007, she accepted her first paid coaching position with Indiana Volleyball Academy, coaching a girl’s fifteen-year-old team. This past spring, she was awarded the CYO Monsignor Busald Service Award.\n\nSandy says, “My greatest accomplishments are being a wife and mother. I have a fantastic, devoted, and hard- working husband that I have spent the last 27 years growing up with and loving. We have three unique children whom I love being home with everyday and who make us proud and sometimes a little crazy. In my free time, I love playing sports, coaching and watching the kids play sports, going camping, traveling, taking pictures, playing board games, having family movie night, and spending time with the extended family and friends.\n\nMy memories from my years at Little Flower are playing kickball, basketball, volleyball and track and being a cheerleader, winning the City Championship in sixth grade kickball and being in the City Finals in eighth grade. I remember riding my bike around the church’s sidewalks and up and down the ramps and walking to school and meeting friends along the way. Every Christmas the entire school sang songs and performed skits in the gymnasium. In the fall there was the annual Kiddy Karnival and Hobby Show in which I entered my Cincinnati Reds collection and won the Best Overall Collection trophy at the City CYO Hobby Show. Sister Ruth was also a big Cincinnati Reds fan and I thought it was so cool to find a lady who loved baseball as much as me.\n\nThe teachers at Little Flower challenged us academically and gave us the opportunity to express ourselves. I remember looking forward to going to school and having fun while learning. As a student I experienced a Hawaiian Luau in third grade, Pioneer Week in fourth grade - churning butter, wearing costumes and square dancing, and doing creative writing, performing the play Rhubarb, and learning the Fifty Nifty United States song in Ms. Pfau’s, now known as Mrs. Slaton, fifth grade class. I remember in 7th grade, Sister Jeanne Daily talking to us in detail about the readings for our weekly grade level Masses and getting to be a lector. I cherished being a class officer in 8th grade and performing the musical Oklahoma.\n\nI felt safe at Little Flower, and the teachers made you feel special. When I graduated, I was well prepared for high school. I took the confidence that was instilled in me and the values of respect for others that were taught to me by my parents, teachers and coaches at Little Flower and applied them to the diverse student body and challenges that I faced in a public high school.\n\nAs an adult I feel like the members of Little Flower School and Parish are an extension of my family, offering their prayers and support on a daily basis. I was proud to watch my oldest daughter become the third generation of my family to graduate from Little Flower, and I look forward to my other two children graduating from here too.”\n\nAfter graduating from Little Flower in 1967 and The Latin School of Indianapolis in 1971, Fr. Paul spent eight years at St. Meinrad in preparation for his ordination to the priesthood. In 1984 he completed Graduate Studies in Canon Law at the Catholic University of America. His service to the Archdiocese of Indianapolis has been extensive and included the following appointments:\n\nAssociate Pastor, St. Lawrence\n\nAssociate Pastor, St. Barnabas\n\nPart-time assistant at the Metropolitan Tribunal\n\nAdministrator, Holy Trinity, Edinburgh\n\nVice Vicar-Judicial, Metropolitan Tribunal\n\nPastor, St. Rose of Lima, Franklin, and Holy Trinity, Edinburgh\n\nPastor, St. Matthew, Indianapolis\n\nMany of Fr. Paul’s pastoral assignments have been concurrent with assignments at the Metropolitan Tribunal, and he currently serves both as Pastor of St. Matthew and as the Vice Vicar-Judicial.\n\nWhen asked to reflect on the values he received from his education at Little Flower, Fr. Paul wrote, “The values I received from Little Flower School are still with me today. They reflect a desire for knowledge and insight, an understanding of faith and grace, and the building of community. Little Flower School was an environment in which wisdom, grace, and good will were fostered, taught, and lived. I learned the values of acceptance, patience, perseverance, and respect. The lessons learned in and out of the classroom have been values that have shaped my whole life.\n\nMy vocation to the priesthood was also developed and molded through the teaching and the dedication of the Franciscan Sisters and the example and witness of the priests of Little Flower Parish.\n\nLittle Flower has been my spiritual home from the time I was born and baptized to the day I celebrated my first Mass. It continues to be a source of spiritual awakening and renewal when I have the opportunity to visit, remembering the many in the community who served and sacrificed for the parish and the school.\n\nI would be remiss if I did not say that the relationships with classmates and peers have been ones that I still treasure, respect, and admire (Fr. Bob Gilday and Tom Costello being two of them).”\n\nFr. Paul recalls one of the most vivid memories for many Little Flower graduates. “One of my favorite memories of Little Flower was seeing the construction of the church and all that it entailed. From the conversion of the old church into a brand new gymnasium, to the erecting of the steeple and to the dedication of the church and to the first services celebrated there, the process of following the construction of Little Flower Church made me realize what a special place it is and continues to be to this day.\n\nWhen the steeple was erected, I can remember we were all dismissed from classes to go outside. The silver steeple glistened and shined the sunlight. It epitomized the sacrifice and accomplishments of many. To this day it still stands as a symbol of accomplishment that Little Flower has made to the community it serves. I am grateful to have been a part of it.\n\nThe corner of 13th and Bosart will always be a place filled with fond memories for me of people and life experiences of growth and faith. My roots and the roots of many are firmly established because of this corner of the Eastside and what Little Flower represents.”\n\nAlso a graduate of Scecina High School, Jan graduated from the Marion County General School of Nursing (Wishard Health Services) in 1975. After spending ten years at Riley Hospital for Children, she worked nine years for the Visiting Nurse Service as a pediatric home care nurse. She then returned to Wishard Hospital and worked in the Child Assessment Clinic for a three-year grant program to work with abused and neglected children and their families. She then began her work at St. Francis Hospital in 1996.\n\nShe began her career in parish nursing by completing the University of Indianapolis Parish Nurse certificate program in 1996. In addition, she has just completed the certificate program in Pastoral Leadership at Marian College.\n\nCurrently Jan serves as a Parish Nurse for St. Francis Hospitals at Holy Cross Parish. In her tenth year in this part-time position, she also works as a registered nurse in the health center at the Indiana School for the Blind and Visually Impaired.\n\nA parishioner at Holy Cross since 1978, she joined the staff as Parish Nurse in 1997. She has served on the Board of Education, the Parish Council, the RCIA team, and the Social Concerns Commission. Parish Nursing has been her response to the vocation call to a ministry that has integrated faith and nursing, for whole person health and healing.\n\nHer past and present volunteer service includes the Damien Center, Horizon House, and St. Vincent de Paul Society. She has also been on three mission trips to El Salvador and spent three months in Alabama working with the sick poor in 1985.\n\nIn the past several years, her honors have included she American Cancer Society Volunteer of the Year, St. Francis’ Spirit of Women Health Care Provider regional award, and Indianapolis Business Journal Health Care Hero Award.\n\nJan remembers the fun she had with Sister Rose de Lourdes. She remembers her as a free-spirited teacher who affirmed and challenged her students. “She helped each of us reach our potential and prepared us for high school. Perhaps that was the year I became aware of the connection of education and faith….Vatican II renewal was coming into effect at Little Flower at this time with our pastor, Monsignor Bosler. There was excitement in the air with all the changes happening….I was in Girl Scouts and we worked toward the Marian Award, learning our faith and its connections to life for us. It was just the beginning of the groundwork of my faith development through education.”\n\nJan feels that Little Flower prepared her for faith-filled living and taught her the skills necessary to be a successful student at lifelong learning. Franciscan values have been a common thread throughout her life and continuing to this day with her work as a parish nurse. She stated, “The values I embrace are responsible stewardship, joy-filled service, dignity of each person and compassionate care. I feel honored and humble to be of service for the common good and to give back to the community through parish ministry. I give God the glory and am grateful for my early years at Little Flower.”\n\nTom graduated from Little Flower School in 1945. He is a 1949 graduate of Cathedral High School.
