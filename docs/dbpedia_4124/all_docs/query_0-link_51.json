C., May 5, 1925. Sir: There are in the United States a large number of agencies which for a number of years have been accrediting or approving secondary schools on the basis of certain standards which have been established. Chief among these agencies are the regional educational associations, such as the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools and the State departments of education in the respective States. The objects of these agencies in compiling lists of approved secondary schools are numerous; they include use by colleges which admit students on the certificate plan. The number of secondary schools in the United States is now so large that it has become increasingly necessary for higher institutions to have accurate information at hand concerning the status of every high school from which students seek admission to college. Upon four occasions in the past the Bureau of Education has brought together in bulletin form the lists of approved secondary schools which have been compiled by the respective accrediting agencies. These bulletins have proved to be very useful, but owing to the numerous changes in the lists from year to year, it is desirable that the bulletin should be revised periodically. The accompanying manuscript contains such a revision, based on the latest information received from the several accrediting agencies. I recommend that it be published as a bulletin of the Bureau of Education. Respectfully submitted. Jno. J. Tigert, Commissioner. The Secretary of the Interior. Y .

Since the organization of the first public high school in Boston in 1821, this type of secondary school has grown in number until there are more than 19,000 to-day. In addition to these public high schools, there are about 2,500 private high schools and academies and more than 300 preparatory departments of universities and colleges. New junior high schools are added continually. The number of public high school students has increased from 202,963 in 1890 to 2,873,009 in 1922 — a growth of more than fourteen¬ fold in less than a generation. If to this latter number are added those enrolled in private high schools, those in preparatory depart¬ ments of universities and colleges, and those taking secondary courses in normal schools and teachers colleges, the total secondary enrollment for 1922 is 3,204,141. To a large majority of secondary students, the modern high school is their final school; to others it is a preparatory school, an intermedi¬ ate step between the elementary school and college. Of every 1,000 students enrolled in the first five grades of the elementary school, 342 enter high school, 139 graduate from high school, and 72 go on to college; those who attend normal schools, teachers colleges, and other institutions of higher education may be added to the last number. F or these 72, the list of accredited high schools is a necessity . For the other 67 who complete the high-school course and do not enter college, and the 203 who drop out before graduation from high school, a well-seieeted high school becomes a matter of vital im¬ portance. This bulletin, similar in arrangement, content, and design to those published in 1913, 1915, 1916, and 1922, is intended to meet the needs not only of such students, but of officers charged with the control of secondary schools and higher institutions, and State examining and certifying boards as well. ACCREDITED SECONDARY SCHOOL DEFINED “An accredited secondary school,” as the term is used in this bulletin, is a school which is equipped to prepare students for colleges requiring 15 units for unconditioned admission and which has been 1 2 ACCREDITED SECONDARY SCHOOLS investigated or approved for this purpose by one of the following agencies: A State officer of education, a university or college inspector or committee on admissions, an officer or committee of an accrediting association. In the majority of the schools in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia, and in a few cities in other States, high-school courses are based upon seven years of elementary training. In all other places these 15 units represent secondary work above the standard eight-grade elementary school course. As a general rule the curriculum of an accredited school represents four years of 36 or more weeks each; at least three teachers give their whole time to high-school work,1 and the school keeps up an adequate library and laboratory equip¬ ment UNIT DEFINED The following authoritative definition of the word “unit” has been made by the national conference committee on standards of colleges and secondary schools, which was formerly composed of representa¬ tives of the National Association of State Universities, the New England College Entrance Certificate Board, the College Entrance Examination Board, the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the Middle States and Maryland, the Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools of the Southern States, the New England Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, the Associa¬ tion of American Colleges, the Association of Urban Universities, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, and the United States Commissioner of Education: A unit represents a year’s study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year’s work. This statement is designed to afford a standard of measurement for the work done in secondary schools. It takes — (1) The four-year high-school course as a basis and assumes that — - (2) The length of the school year is from 36 to 40 weeks; that — (3) A period is from 40 to 60 minutes in length; and that — (4) The study is pursued four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year’s work in any subject can not be accomplished in less than 120 sixty-minute hours, or their equivalent. Schools organized on any other than a four-year basis can nevertheless estimate their work in terms of this unit. A four-year secondary-school curriculum should be regarded as representing not more than 16 units of work. 1 Exceptions are certain schools in the lists of Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, .and Nebraska which do not conform in every particular to the definition but are approved by the State officials. Also see table on university admission requirements. INTRODUCTION 3 VARIATIONS IN REQUIREMENTS OF ACCREDITING AGENCIES The. number of subjects recognized by the various accrediting bodies as forming an acceptable part of the college preparatory course varies greatly; for example, the subjects recognized by the College Entrance Examination Board as permissible in a standard high-school course are:2 Units Units English _ 3 Mathematics _ 3-4 \\ Latin _ _ „ _ 2-4 Greek _ _ _ ._ 2-3 French _ 2-4 German _ 2-4 Italian _ 2-4 Spanish _ _ : _ 2-4 History. _ ... _ 1-4 Science _ 1-4 Drawing _ 1-2 On the other hand, there are State universities and privately endowed institutions, like Leland Stanford University, which per¬ mit great enlargement of the range of electives. The University of California, for example, accepts the following: Units English _ 2-4 History _ _ _ , _ 1-4 Laboratory science _ 1-5 Mathematics _ _ _ _ 1-4 1 Greek - - 1-4 Latin _ 1-5 French _ _ _ _ _ 1-5 German _ 1-5 Spanish _ . _ 1-5 Physiology and hygiene _ 1 Units Physical geography _ 1 Elementary physical science_____ 1 Drawing _ 1-2 Mechanic arts _ _ _ 1-3 Agriculture _ _. _ 1-3 Home economics _ 1-3 Music _ 1-4 Bookkeeping _ 1 Stenography and typewriting _ 1-2 Military science and tactics _ 1 Chicago University has but one specific requirement, that of 3 units of English. The others, to make 15, may be selected from groups. All specify 15 or more units, except the University of Maine, which admits with 14J^. None requires more than 16 units for admission. The requirements of each voluntary accrediting agency are briefly stated at the head of the list of schools which it accredits. At the head of each list of schools are summarized the requirements for admission to the A. B. course of the State university. The schools on the accredited list generally have the privilege of certificating students to other courses as well. To outline the admission require¬ ments for all these courses would consume much space and might lead to confusion. The requirements for admission to the A. B. course may in each case be considered fairly typical of the institu¬ tion’s policy with respect to entrance requirements. J It should be noted, however, that the maximum amount of credit which a high-school student can secure in any single subject in a year is ordinarily one unit. Four units of credit in any given subject would therefore constitute the normal maximum for a high-school course. 4 ACCREDITED SECONDARY SCHOOLS METHODS OF ACCREDITING Two methods are in common use for, carrying on the system of accrediting in those States where the State authority embraces agencies for higher education. Under the first, the inspection of the work of the high schools is done through an officer or committee of the State university, and the list of acceptable or accredited high schools is published in the catalogue of the university and thus made available for other institutions within the same State or for institutions in neighboring States. Under the second, the inspection and rating are done by the State superintendent of public instruction, the State board of education, or the State education office, acting through specially appointed officers. Examples of the former method are furnished by the Universities of California, Nebraska, and Wisconsin; of the latter method, by the States of New York, Ohio, and Iowa. The requirement of a completion of a standard four-year high- school course representing 15 units for admission to college, or as a part of the prescription for admission to professional schools or to the practice of professions, has produced a group of organizations among whose activities are the coordination of standards of secon¬ dary education in neighboring States and the compilation of lists of accredited secondary schools. Such sectional organizations are now at work in the North Central States, Northwestern States, New Eng¬ land, Middle States, and Maryland, and the Southern States. These organizations are purely voluntary and have no legal control over the institutions which they rate. The influence which they wield, however, because of the fact that they focus representative educa¬ tional opinion in their respective sections, is considerable. Occasion¬ ally, also, private institutions, like the University of Chicago, have carried on their own investigation and accrediting. For convenience in making comparisons, tables are presented showing accrediting requirements and university admission require¬ ments by States.

INTRODUCTION 7 DIVISIONS OF THE BULLETIN Part I: State lists. — The bulletin is divided into two parts. The first part contains lists of schools accredited by State universities and State officers of education. Sometimes both the State university and the State department of education publish lists of accredited schools.3 When the State department of education or the State university publishes lists of accredited or approved high schools of different grades, only schools of the first grade are included in the bulletin, except in the case of California, Delaware, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, and North Dakota.4 Part II: Lists of accrediting associations. — Part II contains the lists of the four principal associations which undertake to accredit schools. The methods or standards of these associations are not identical. The list accredited by each is preceded by a statement of the basis upon which it is compiled. The schools are listed alphabetically, according to the towns in which they are located. The names of accredited private secondary schools and academies are printed in italics. 3 In Minnesota, the State education department accredits or approves only public schools, but private schools having the requisite standards and equipment are accredited by the State university. 4 Schools in Division B of the University of California are accredited. Their continued accrediting, however, is rendered somewhat uncertain by undeveloped organization, inadequate resources, unsatis¬ factory standards, or other causes. In Delaware, schools are divided into classes according to number of pupils, number of teachers, and value of apparatus, the larger and better equipped schools being in the first class. Both classes given. are accredited by the State university. The schools in Group II of the Georgia list, though weak in laboratory, library, and sometimes teach¬ ing staff, are fully accredited by the University of Georgia, and are therefore included in the bulletin. Class B schools in Kansas have at least four teachers in the high school, including superintendent or principal, at least four teachers in the grades, and at least nine months of school in the grades. Class C schools have three teachers in the high school, three in the grades, and nine months of school in the grades. Class D schools have at least two teachers giving entire time in the high school and three teachers in the grades. Accredited high schools in Kentucky in Class B must meet practically the same requirements as Class A schools, except with respect to the number and qualification of teachers and the value of library and scientific apparatus. For the convenience of smaller communities the University of Nebraska has established a list of minor accredited schools, the graduates of which may receive 28 points on credentials, giving them conditional admission to college. This condition is canceled when 30 hours of college work are completed. In North Dakota, schools are divided into classes according to number of puprls, number of teachers, and value of apparatus, the larger and better equipped schools being in the first class. Graduates from all three classes are admitted unconditionally to the University of North Dakota.
