        "text": "<strong>Oldenburg</strong> <strong>Academy</strong> of the Immaculate Conception <strong>opportunities</strong> await… <strong>every</strong> <strong>student</strong>, <strong>every</strong> <strong>day</strong>! June 15, 2012 Greetings! Did you know that the 2012‐2013 school year marks the <strong>Academy</strong>’s 160 th and the town of <strong>Oldenburg</strong>’s 175 th anniversary? As a school community, what a celebratory year to be at OA, and I am excited to announce the following important dates in advance for planning purposes. If you have a freshman, mark your calendar for August 8, 2012, from 8:00 – 1:00. On this <strong>day</strong>, freshman will get a jump start at being in high school by participating in freshman orientation and ending with a free lunch (freshman, feel free to wear any OA spirit top and school appropriate shorts!). All <strong>student</strong>s will convene in regular uniform dress code on August 9, 2012. (In case you need to check, dress code requirements are posted on our website.) There is a lot of required information we need as a school, but it is only once a year and vital to both your son/daughter’s safety and our records. Forms must be filled out completely on a yearly basis and are located on our website to be filled out in advance so there is no wait. Book Days: • Thurs<strong>day</strong>, August 2, (2:00 PM – 7:00 PM) • Fri<strong>day</strong>, August 3, (9:00 AM – 2:00 PM) If you are not able to make those dates, you will need to arrange a time with the front office AFTER August 6, 2012, as schedules will not be ready for distribution prior. If you would like to get a jump start on filling out the forms, you will be able to download <strong>every</strong>thing after July 1, 2012, on our website. Mrs. Lancaster will distribute schedules once all forms are filled out completely and turned in on book <strong>day</strong>s. Final schedules will not be available until the dates above. Every attempt has been made to meet the requests of each <strong>student</strong>. If you have questions or concerns about your <strong>student</strong>'s schedule, please contact the guidance office at (812)934.4440 x229 or via email at jlancaster@oldenburgacademy.org after registration. Please note that necessary schedule changes must be made by August 17, 2012. Any changes made after this date will result in a $50 rescheduling fee. Offices in the academic building will be closed the last two weeks of June and first two weeks of July. If you need to get in touch with anyone in the academic building, feel free to email or call and leave a message. The Administrative Offices located in ICA Hall (Advancement, Marketing, Finance, and President) will be open pending vacation schedules. I wish you and your family a fun and relaxing summer break, because August will be here before we know it to launch 160 years of a great, Catholic high school education in the ‘Burg! Peace and Blessings, Mrs. Bettina M. Rose Principal, <strong>Oldenburg</strong> <strong>Academy</strong> of the Immaculate Conception"
