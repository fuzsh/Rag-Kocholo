        "text": "NEGenWeb Project\n\nChurch/Catholic\n\nFranciscans\n\nChapter V\n\nSt. Bonaventure's School and Academy\n\nST. BONAVENTURE SCHOOL (1878-1884)\n\nAs soon as Fr. Ambrose had remodeled the old public school house into a chapel for divine worship, as well as a place of residence for himself and the religious associated with him in the Columbus field, he set about to make arrangements for the education of the children in his flock. Despite the commands of his superiors, Father Ambrose proceeded very much against his own will. The priest's heart was wholly with his little band, but he dreaded the big addition to the heavy indebtedness. This fear was voiced in a letter to Very Rev. Commissary Mauritius Klostermann, O. F. M. The cost of the monastery was figured at $8,000, that of the school at $5,000, and the requisites for the chapel vestments, furniture, etc., not lower than $450 and most likely a great deal more. This was an enormous indebtedness at a time, when money could only be had at a high rate of interest. The country was poor and none of the settlers had much cash to donate to the cause. For the most part the pioneer Germans and Poles were immigrants, who needed everything they possessed for the maintenance of their own families. The objections of Father Ambrose were finally overruled, and he was straightway ordered to proceed with the plans. This was in 1878.\n\nOld Church Furniture at St. Bonaventure's, Columbus.\n\nBUILDING THE FIRST SCHOOL, 1878\n\nThe first school of St. Bonaventure's congregation, according to old records, was a brick building, erected in 1878. It comprised four rooms of 21x27 feet each. The COLUMBUS JOURNAL of July 16, 1878, states: \"The Franciscan Fathers will shortly begin the erection of a school house near the monastery. It will be a three-story brick, and four rooms, 21x27 feet each will be for occupancy by the pupils. The school will be conducted by four Sisters from Joliet, Illinois. Besides the required and common branches taught in the Public schools, private lessons in sewing, knitting, English, German and music will be offered. The school will be entirely non-sectarian in its character and open to all who desire to attend. The building will accommodate 320 pupils. The school will be opened about the first of September. After the dedication, a fair will be held. No doubt the school will be well attended.\"\n\nUnder date of August 7, 1878, the following article may be read: \"The Franciscan Fathers commenced Thursday last week with their new school building, which is to be a two and one-half story edifice with dormer windows, so as to give it the appearance of a three story structure. It will contain four large class rooms, giving ample accomodation (sic) for 300 pupils. In consequence of unavoidable delays, the Fathers believe that the new school building will not be ready for occupancy until the first of October.\"\n\nOn October 23, 1878, the Columbus Journal again quotes: \"The Franciscan Fathers of this\n\n261\n\ncity will open their school on the fourth day of November, 1878. The teaching will not be sectarian. Catechism will be taught to the Catholic children before or after regular school hours. The branches in English and German will be those usually taught in the best free schools of the country, also lessons for females regarding different branches of their work will be taught. Terms $1.00 per month in advance. If desired, girls will be boarded with the Sisters. Children are required to undergo an examination for classification, which will take place at the new school house any time from 2 to 4 o'clock p. m.\"\n\nAccording to all available records, the first school building was 27x53 feet and cost about $7,000. There were two large rooms on each floor; the east rooms on the first and second floor were used as class rooms, the other rooms served as a residence for the Sisters.\n\nARRIVAL OF THE FRANCISCAN SISTERS OF JOLIET, ILLINOIS\n\nWhen it became known that the Franciscan Fathers had become established in Platte County and an imposing school was under construction, several communities of Sisters offered to take over the School, and also to found a hospital. One community, of Clinton, Iowa, even proffered to transfer its national mother-house (novitiate) to Columbus, but since the Very Rev. Commissary Provincial Mauritius Klostermann, O. F. M., and Father Ambrose had made arrangements with the new Franciscan Community of the Immaculate Conception at Joliet, Illinois, at the commencement of the building, therefore the other communities were refused.\n\nOf the arrival of the Joliet Sisters and their experiences we let the first Superior, Sister Stanislaus Droesler, O. S. F., who is still among the living, tell the story:\n\nTHE SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS OF MARY IMMACULATE\n\nJoliet, Illinois,\n\nat St. Bonaventure School, Columbus, Nebraska, and St. Bernard School, St. Bernard, Nebraska.\n\nThe congregation of the Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis of Mary Immaculate was established at Joliet, Illinois, in 1865. The motherhouse and novitiate, the normal training and preparatory departments, Assisi College and St. Francis Academy, are located here.\n\nThe membership of the congregation numbers 572. They conduct schools in ten dioceses, in which 15,237 pupils were taught during the current year, 1928-1929.\n\nThe congregation also conducts an orphanage, the Guardian Angel Home, in Joliet township. At present the average attendance is one hundred sixty-five, including the elementary and high school classes.\n\nSISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS OF MARY IMMACULATE INVITED TO NEBRASKA\n\nFifty-one years ago, 1878, on the urgent request of Very Reverend Mauritius Klostermann, O. F. M., Commissary of the Sacred Heart Province, Teutopolis, Illinois, Mother M. Francis Shanahan, superior at St. Francis Convent, Joliet, Illinois, accepted St. Bonaventure school Columbus, and St. Bernard school, St. Bernard, Nebraska.\n\nFifty years ago pioneering on the wide Nebraska plains was somewhat of a novelty to the Sisters who rather enjoyed the experience. It was not customary in those days to write annals, chronicles and statistics, as is the vogue in the twentieth century. People were too poor and too busy to indulge in such pastime; therefore, the present sketch is dependent on the meager records of St. Francis Convent, Joliet, and the fading memories of the few survivors who are left to tell the story.\n\nAll but four of the Sisters, who originally entered the Nebraska field in 1878, have gone to their reward. The survivors are Sister M. Stanislas Droesler, Sister M. Felicitas Collet, Sister M. Clementine Koch, and Sister M. Blanche Allonas.\n\nTHE FRANCISCAN FATHERS\n\nReverend Ambrose Janssen, O. F. M., superior at Columbus, was colonizing St. Bernard at that time and was pastor (and superior) of both places, Columbus and St. Bernard. Somewhat later Reverend Cyprian Banscheid, O. F. M., was appointed pastor at St. Bernard.\n\nOther Fathers were associated with Reverend Ambrose Janssen at the monastery in Columbus, assisting and attending missions in the surrounding country.\n\nReverend Sebastian Cebulla, O. F. M., Reverend Seraphine Lampe, O. F. M., Reverend Anselm Puetz, O. F. M., and Reverend Father Meinolph, O. F. M., resided at the monastery, the two latter giving conferences occasionally to the Sisters.\n\nARRIVAL OF THE SISTERS IN COLUMBUS\n\nThe Sisters for both schools, accompanied by Rev. Mother Francis and Sister Cecilia Hartmann, left Joliet for Columbus, August 18, 1878. They expected the schools to be ready for opening in September. Three Sisters were destined for each school. Sister M. Stanislas Droesler was appointed superior at St. Bonaventure school and was assisted by Sister M. Cleopha Fechtrup and Sister M. Felicitas Collet.\n\nSister M. Gregory Miller was appointed su-\n\n262\n\nperior at St. Bernard school; her assistants were Sister M. Assumption Klipfel and Sister M. Sophia Jungblut.\n\nWhen the Sisters arrived in Columbus, good Father Ambrose was taken unawares. There was no building ready for them, neither at Columbus nor at St. Bernard. Evidently he had forgotten to notify the Mother Superior at Joliet to withhold the Sisters until completion of the school buildings. Fortunately, there was a newly built cottage on the prairie a short distance from the Franciscan monastery, where the good pastor engaged the two small rooms on the upper floor for the six Sisters. An elderly gentleman with his young wife and child has recently moved into the cottage and occupied the lower rooms, while they kindly let the two upper rooms temporarily to the Sisters.\n\nMeals were served the Sisters in the small reception room of the monastery, whither they hied themselves three times daily, and be it said to the credit of the good Brother cook, the meals were thoroughly enjoyed. No doubt, the prairie winds whetted the Sisters' appetites, but the monastery cook served wholesome, substantial food, and the appetites of the healthy young Sisters scarcely needed stimulation. Moreover, in those early days of pioneering luxuries were unknown, especially with poor Franciscans.\n\nOn one occasion some charitable soul had supplied the Brother with a pie. Naturally, he would serve the pie for the Sisters' dessert. However, at dinner, it was left untouched. Again it was served at supper and again left untouched. Still the good Brother was not disconcerted, but served the pie the next morning for breakfast. Now the Sisters could no longer refuse the delicacy and prepared to despatch it. The Brother was curious to see how the pie would be divided into six pieces. Of course, the Sisters had some mathematical skill, so there was no difficulty, even though the shares were not mathematically equal.\n\nNebraska winds created merriment, if not disaster on occasion. In those early days when the land was treeless and houses were few and far between, strong winds had full sway and played their pranks with gleeful mischief. It was not unusual to see sheds upset, roofs torn away from buildings, and all sorts of debris scattered over creation.\n\nOn one occasion Sister S. started to church with a box of artificial vines and flowers, intending to trim the altars for the feast of Corpus Christi. However, when she was halfway between the church and the school, the wind spent so much force that she was unable to take a step forward, but was twisted about in a circle until her companion, Sister M. Assumption, came to her rescue. Sad to say, Mr. Wind had torn the precious box of flowers from her grasp and carried them over the prairie beyond recovery.\n\nSince economy was in order, the Sisters utilized corncobs and coarse prairie grasses for fuel. Many a time they were disappointed, when, after building a fire with those rapidly combustible fuels, they returned to find the fire had died out.\n\nShortly after the Sisters' arrival from Joliet, Sisters Stanislas and Gregory fell ill. The former was quite ill for six or eight weeks. Dr. Bonesteel kindly attended the Sisters when his services were needed.\n\nST. BONAVENTURE SCHOOL, COLUMBUS\n\nThe school buildings were not ready for occupancy until January, 1879, when the classes were organized at Columbus and at St. Bernard. Not only Catholic children attended St. Bonaventure school; non-Catholic parents availed themselves of the opportunity to send their children to the Sisters' school, considering it a private select school.\n\nThe following Sisters served St. Bonaventure school during the four years from 1878 to 1882:\n\n1878-'79--Sister M. Stanislas Droesler, Superior; Sister M. Cleopha Fechtrup, Sister M. Felicitas Collet.\n\n1879-'80--Sister M. Stanislas Droesler, superior; Sister M. Assumption Klipfel, Sister M. Sophia Jungblut.\n\n1880-'81--Sister M. Aloysia Bernert, Superior; Sister M. Bonaventure Kolljung, Sister M. Sophia Jungblut.\n\n1881-'82--Sister M. Bonaventure Kolljung, Superior; Sister M. Blanche Allonas, Sister M. Sophia Jungblut.\n\nOnly three of the above Sisters survive--Sisters M. Stanislas, Felicitas, and Blanche.\n\nAmong the former pupils of St. Bonaventure school were the following boarders: Mary Carrig of Shell Creek, Nebraska; Emily Held of Schuyler, Nebraska; Mary Meeney from Utah; Anna Hesler; Dora Stetler from the West, and Dora Brown of Columbus.\n\nSome of the day pupils were Emma Anderson, Millie Metz and her sister, Joseph F. Berney, the twins Deborah and Grace O'Conner, Fannie Burns and her sister, Mary O'Meara, William Grady.\n\nMary Carrig entered St. Francis Convent, Joliet, Illinois, in July, 1879. On October 18 of the same year she was received into the novitiate with five other postulants by Reverend Clementine Deymann, O. F. M., and was given the name Sister Mary Rufina.\n\nAlthough robust in appearance, she had not a strong constitution, and her health began to fail. On the doctor's advice she was sent to her native climate and remained with the Sis-\n\n263\n\nters at St. Bonaventure school, Columbus. There was no perceptible improvement in her condition, and, on December 5, 1880, in her twenty-second year and the second of her religious life, she died suddenly of an internal hemorrhage. She was buried in the cemetery of Shell Creek, near which her parents lived.\n\nEmily Held also entered the convent at Joliet, Illinois, in 1882. In religion she is Sister M. Alcantara, who has been very active in the field of education. She has several university degrees and is at present dean of Assisi College, Joliet.\n\nOne of the best known past pupils of St. Bonaventure school was Joseph F. Berney, who died at Columbus, July 8, 1922. He had always been a devoted member of St. Bonaventure parish and was active in Catholic societies. In the town and county he held positions of trust and responsibility, and his loyalty to his teachers at St. Bonaventure school is shown by a card of merit awarded him in 1880, and which he treasured all his life time. It is still preserved by his widow, Mrs. Eva Berney, who now resides at 817 N. 34th St., Omaha, Nebraska. Her mother, Mrs. Elizabeth Schilz, still lives in Columbus. The latter has a niece, Sister M. Innocentia Wagner, who is a member of the congregation of the Franciscans of Mary Immaculate, Joliet.\n\nIt is to be regretted that accounts of other former pupils are not at hand, for, undoubtedly, there would be other noteworthy careers to be recorded.\n\nREMINISCENCES\n\nOne instance occurs to mind when Sister M. Sophia, who was at St. Bernard, had occasion to go to Columbus. After riding all day through a snow drizzle on a load of produce, she arrived after dark at St. Bonaventure's, wet and cold and hungry. However, there was no complaint; the discomfort was accepted as a matter of course, and was soon forgotten.\n\nAnother incident was the trip to St. Bernard. Mother Francis Shanahan had come from Joliet to visit the new missions in Nebraska. It was March 28, 1879, when she and Sister Stanislas arranged to visit the Sisters at St. Bernard. Two of the young ladies attending St. Bonaventure school, Emma Anderson and Millie Metz, kindly offered to provide the conveyance and were invited to accompany the Sisters to St. Bernard. The equipage consisted of a two-seated carriage and a span of white ponies, for, in order to honor the Reverend Mother, the young ladies wished to make the trip a gala affair. The monastery provided the driver, a young man who was supposed to be familiar with the road. The Sisters had no idea of the distance and carried very little lunch.\n\nRev. Isidore Fosselman, O. F. M.\n\nAn early start was made; all were in the best of spirits, and everything went on well until it seemed the party would never reach its destination. Occasionally the driver was asked whether they were near St. Bernard, and each time he replied that he was taking the \"short cut\", and would soon be there. Indeed, he was taking the \"short cut\", for he had turned off the main road and was driving across prairies and ditches until nightfall, when it became unsafe to drive any farther. Happily, a dim light was seen in the distance and they drove towards it. A small farm house was reached and inquiry was made about St. Bernard. The good people had never heard the name. On further inquiry as to Columbus, the travelers were told they were fifteen miles from Columbus. Supper was prepared for the lost party, and the small kitchen harbored the guests for the night. The next morning at daybreak they steered their way to Columbus, following directions, to be sure, and keeping on the main road. The travelers were not much the worse for the trip, but the driver disappeared from the scene.\n\nThe following young ladies joined the Sisters of St. Francis of Mary Immaculate, Joliet, Illinois:\n\nSister M. Rufina Carrig, Shell Creek, Nebraska.\n\nSister M. Elizabeth Eummelen, St. Bernard, Nebraska.\n\nSister M. Alcantara Held, Schuyler, Nebraska.\n\nSister M. Aloysia Schaefer, St. Bernard, Nebraska.\n\nSister M. Pancratia Craemers, St. Bernard, Nebraska.\n\nSister M. Hubertine Roufs, Lindsay, Nebraska.\n\n264\n\nSister M. Leonissa Schaefer, St. Bernard, Nebraska.\n\nSister M. Engelberta Borer, Lindsay, Nebraska.\n\nSister M. Gervaise Luesse, Arago, Nebraska.\n\nSister M. Wilhelma Ramaekers, Lindsay, Nebraska.\n\nSister M. Aloysia Schaefer has been stationed at the motherhouse the greater part of the time of her religious career. She was occupied in St. Francis Academy as prefect and music teacher, and later was Mistress of postulants and novices. At present she is a member of the general council.\n\nOne instance occurs to mind, when Sister M.\n\nBut we are digressing and anticipating. Let us now return to our narrative.\n\nTHE NEW SCHOOL OPENS\n\nOn November 4, 1878, the new school was opened with about 80 pupils. The COLUMBUS JOURNAL of Nov. 13, 1878, has the following: Monday, Nov. 4th. Attendance so far about 80, with more expected; the number will doubtless reach one hundred in a short time--all of them from the city. The dormitory is now ready for occupancy and boarders will be taken hereafter, as soon as there is a sufficient number of pupils to justify it. Algebra and Bookkeeping will be taught\".\n\nDEDICATION OF THE NEW SCHOOL\n\nThe new school building was solemnly dedicated to its high purpose--the Christian education of the young people of Platte County and vicinity--on November 17, 1878.\n\nSrs. of St. Bonaventure's School: Ven. Sr. M. Stanislaus, Sr. M. Josepha, Sr. M. Agnes, Sr. M. Agnella.\n\nTHE SISTERS PROPOSE A SELECT SCHOOL\n\nUnder date of May, 1879, the COLUMBUS JOURNAL announced: \"The Sisters of the Convent intend to add to the common school they now have, a select school, if they shall have scholars enough. To ascertain the wish of the parents, who want to send their children, these are requested to report to Rev. Father Ambrose or to the Sisters within any time now until the first of June. It will require the employment of another teacher as the higher branches will be taught, and it is important to know the number of those that will attend.\"\n\nFurther on, the same paper says: \"The Convent School conducted by the Sisters of St. Francis will resume its scholastic course on Monday, September 1st, cordially inviting all its former patrons to attend again. It will be a select school henceforth, affording pupils, whose attainments in the common branches are passably good, the advantages of a higher course. At present there will be three principal classifications, viz., the third, embracing only the common branches; the second or intermediate, including besides the common, one or more of the higher branches; the first embracing the higher branches only. German will be taught in each division, special attention being paid to German Grammar in the first. Tuition for the third division will be one dollar a month; for the second two dollars; and for the first, three dollars a month--all in advance.\"\n\nTHE JOLIET SISTERS ABANDON ST. BONAVENTURE'S SCHOOL\n\nIn 1882, the Joliet Sisters handed over their school of a few years to another order. It seems that they had been induced by friends, against their own will, to accept the distant and difficult school. Their teachers were scarce, and when they had a chance to turn over their labors to a religious congregation with a splendid record, having already a hospital at Columbus, Nebr., they gladly did so. The Joliet Sisters must be given credit for having undertaken the valiant task that they did, for in those years, founding and conducting a school on the plains\n\n265\n\nwas far from being a light task. When they left, it is to their credit that the school affairs and future aspects were excellent.\n\nSister M. Stanislas Droesler, O. S. F., is still living at Joliet, Ill., where she was for many years directress of St. Francis' Academy and filled other high offices. She has spent over sixty years in religious life and is still hearty and active. In 1927 she made a trip to Europe to take part in the seventh centenary celebration in honor of St. Francis in Assisi and Rome, Italy.\n\nTHE FRANCISCAN SISTERS OF PERPETUAL ADORATION TAKE CHARGE\n\nThe successors in the two pioneer denominational schools of Platte County--Columbus and St. Bernard--were the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration, whose headquarters are in Olpe, Germany, and the American Mother-house in Lafayette, Indiana. This same group had already undertaken the founding of a hospital at Columbus and could, also, conveniently take over the two schools.\n\nIn the afternoon of July 27, 1882, Sisters Josepha, Agnes, Cordula and Casimira arrived. Sister Josepha describes their arrival as follows: \"We were met at the depot by (Delsman's) driver with a spring wagon, who took us and all our baggages to our destination. We and all our belongings were deposited on the open prairie between the church and the school.\"\n\nA terrific electric storm raged that night. Having been told in the East, however, that such storms were common on the Prairies, the Sisters regarded it as something usual. They were surprised, therefore, when they were told the next morning that the storm had been unusually severe and had done much damage.\n\nThe Sisters arranged their rough quarters as best as they were able and set about completing plans for their teaching. The following September they opened the regular school term with from fifty to seventy pupils. Attendance was very irregular, some children coming to school two or three months throughout the entire term, their parents deeming that time to be sufficient for educating a child of the Plains. Sister Flavia came to Columbus in 1882, Sister Conrada in 1883. Sister Constantia also came about this time and remained in Columbus until she was transferred to St. Bernard's as Superior where she died in 1905.\n\nOPENING OF ST. FRANCIS ACADEMY\n\nOwing to the crowded condition of the school and a desire to care for the unexpected large demand for board and room from girl students, an addition was built to the west, 26x50 ft., in 1883 (July-December). The laundry north of the house was built at the same time. Higher education was also the aim of the Sisters. Heretofore the classes conducted were chiefly on elementary subjects ranging from the primer to the eighth grade. On completion of the new wing in January, 1884, the St. Francis Academy made its appearance. Another room was added for the ninth and tenth grades, making a total of three rooms for classes. Room for a chapel was left over the present parlor and when it was properly arranged for divine services the first Holy Mass was celebrated October 30, 1884. In November of the same year the Rt. Rev. James O'Connor, Bishop of Omaha, said Mass in the chapel, and during the service deposited the Blessed Sacrament in the tabernacle, a religious privilege dear to the heart of every Catholic.\n\nTUITION TERMS OF ST. FRANCIS ACADEMY\n\nThe Columbus Journal of August 29, 1883, contains the following:\n\n\"Terms of St. Francis Academy\"\n\n\"Admission paid only once\n\n$ 5.00\n\nBoard--And Tuition in English and German (if desired)\n\n5.00\n\nNeedle work, vocal music, for session that is for five months\n\n60.00\n\nPiano lessons (if desired) for one session, five months\n\n20.00\n\nUse of instrument for practice\n\n5.00\n\nWashing when done at Academy, five months\n\n5.00\n\nInstruction in the Culinary Department (kitchen, if desired)\n\n5.00\n\nPayment required invariably half year in advance.\n\nEach child must be provided with several changes of clothing, some towels, napkins, all marked with names in full, soap, tooth-brush, and some blacking, work box, containing scissors, thimble, needles, thread, buttons, tape, etc.\n\nSchool commences on the first Monday in September and ends about the close of June. On Christmas eve the children are allowed to go home to enjoy a week's vacation but no visits home are allowed at any other period of the scholastic year without extreme necessity.\n\nSisters of St. Francis.\"\n\nTHE STORY AS TOLD BY SISTER AGNELLA\n\nIn August, 1885, Sister Agnella Bucher, O. S. F., came to Columbus as the travelling (sic) companion of Sister Josepha, who had spent a few days in Omaha. Sister Agnella was instructed to remain in Columbus until a pass could be secured. Somehow the pass was never received.\n\n266\n\nWhen the school term opened Sister Agnella was told to assist her colleagues in the class room. Week followed upon week and still no pass was on hand. No confirmation or revocation of her stay in Columbus was sent to Sister Agnella, and for want of another home, she remained here. It was by this queer beginning that Sister Agnella was destined to spend most of her life in Columbus. Almost forty years were devoted to the education of Platte County's youths, probably the longest record of teaching of any of the County's early pedagogues. Sister Agnella is a real pioneer, and she did as much for the welfare of her Western home as did any others of those hardy souls around her. Her memory is held dear in the hearts of hundreds of people of every denomination, who in their youth were privileged to be taught by her.\n\nNEW ADDITIONS TO THE ACADEMY\n\nDue to scarcity of building funds, no doubt, and probably the ease with which the work could be done, a spacious basement had been fitted out as the school's kitchen and dining rooms. In the spring of 1886 heavy rains caused the water to rise in most parts of the basement and compelled the Sisters and children to seek refuge in other quarters. A class room had to be drafted for service, and into this crowded space a kitchen and dining rooms were managed. The new addition provided for four class rooms, two on the first floor and two on the second. One of these class rooms was utilized as a boys' dormitory. The low third story was made into a girls' dormitory.\n\nA THIRD ADDITION\n\nIn 1890, more room was still needed and accordingly the southwest wing (40 ft. long and as wide as the wing; cost $3,393.83, paid by the Sisters), was built. The first floor provided space for the girls' dining room, and the second was equipped with folding single seats which could easily be taken up and the room turned into an auditorium. The third floor was then converted into the Sisters' sleeping quarters.\n\nFirst Graduates of St. Francis Academy, Columbus\n\nA FOURTH ADDITION\n\nIn 1904, another new addition was made to the southeast wing, making accommodations for two spacious class rooms and a boys' dormitory.\n\nIn 1890, Sister Josepha taught the eighth, ninth and tenth grades; Sister Agnella the sixth and seventh; and Sister Coletta the fourth and fifth. These comprised the staff teaching the higher grades, each having a room on the second floor, while the lower grades occupied the first floor, and who were being taught by Sisters Pauline and Romana.\n\nMiss Josephine Klon was employed as teacher in Polish from 1885 until the St. Anthony Polish School was organized in Columbus. Miss Klon died October 4, 1921. R. I. P.\n\nIn 1891, an epidemic of the measles caused the death of three pupils and boarders: Nellie Conley, sister to Rev. Leander, O. F. M., of Mary Ternus and Mary Kelly (of Omaha).\n\nFIRST GRADUATES OF THE ACADEMY, JUNE 24, 1895\n\nThe first class finishing the tenth grade and\n\n267\n\nliterary course was graduated in 1895. It comprised the following students: Misses Marie Kyle, Rose Flynn, Mamie English, Kate Flynn, and Anna Gietzen. Miss Kittie Kavanaugh, also a member of this class, passed to her final reward a few weeks before graduation. Miss Engglish received a special diploma in music. An interesting program was rendered. Rev. Maurice Baukholt, O. F. M., distributed the diplomas.\n\nBy 1895, six Sisters were teaching. Sister Agnes, head of the music department for many years, was given an assistant in 1890. About\n\n1900 there was an enrollment of approximately 250 pupils. The Academy maintained fifteen Sisters, seven of whom were members of the teaching staff. It was estimated that from 1882 to the beginning of the new century the number of boarders numbered about 994.\n\nTHE CHAPEL WING\n\nThe superior of the Academy, Sister Josepha, decided that the room which had been used for the chapel was entirely too small and unfit for such a purpose and accordingly plans were made for the building of the present north wing, comprising the boys' dining room, the visitors' dining room and the sewing room on the first floor; while the second floor was to be used entirely for the present chapel. Thus the Sisters' cherished desire was fulfilled. The new chapel with its most beautifully arched ceiling was artistically frescoed and adorned with three handsome altars of Gothic style. Munich Statuary graced these altars. Words are inadequate to express the Sisters' happiness and gratitude for the new and more fitting abode for their Hidden Eucharistic King.\n\nSome Children of St. Bonaventure's, Columbus\n\nOn February 8, 1900, amidst a severe blizzard, the first High Mass was celebrated.\n\nReverend Father Mathias conducted a retreat for the Sisters in 1879.\n\nReverend Ambrose Janssen was succeeded by Reverend Dominic Florian as pastor and superior in 1881. Early in the summer of 1882 smallpox broke out at the hospital; the church and school and monastery, as well as the hospital, were quarantined.\n\nMarch 8, 1900, Maurice Baukholt, O. F. M., of Omaha, dedicated the chapel.\n\nMay 8, 1900, Rt. Rev. Bishop Scannell administered Confirmation to the class of boarders from the Wilds of Wyoming.\n\nIn 1903, the Munich Stations were donated by Frank and Joe Bucher, brothers of Sister M. Agnella, in memory of their deceased parents. Thus the already beautiful chapel received a final touch, making it the most endeared spot, the most elevating in spirit, where the Sisters long to tarry and converse with their Divine Spouse.\n\nSISTER AGNELLA NEW HEAD OF ACADEMY\n\nUpon the death of Mother Alphonsa, May 18, 1900, Sister Josepha was chosen to succeed her as Provincial in the United States. Sister Agnella was appointed as the Superior of the Academy.\n\nIn 1900 the Academy had sixty-four children as boarders and a total of two hundred and fifty pupils as compared with thirty-four boarders and eighty-five pupils, the student body of 1883.\n\nIn 1910 the course of study embraced twelve years; involving the essential requirements as prescribed by the State Course of Study. As optional subjects the following were offered: Music, piano and violin-harmony and tech-\n\n268\n\nnique; art, china painting, water color, oil painting and pastel.\n\nENLARGING OF ST. FRANCIS ACADEMY IN 1909\n\nIn the spring, 1909, a new building almost as large as the old buildings was erected on the west side. Its ground dimensions are 40x100 feet and its height is three stories, with an attic above and a basement below as portion of the edifice. There is a one-story addition on the north which serves as a kitchen, bakery, and pantry. The estimated cost was $25,000.00, the real, cost about $45,000.00. The building fronts south and although appearing separate and distinct is joined to the old buildings. The first floor served as a girls' dining room and the top floor as a girls' dormitory, the middle floor was equipped with all the essentials of a modern auditorium. Mr. Charles Wurdeman, the architect, made the structure in some respects, resemble the mission style, although in general outline it conforms rather with the older buildings. The old dining room was then divided into sound proof music rooms. Other parts were also remodeled. It was the aim to remove the musical department as much as possible from the school rooms, and study hall. The new building was occupied in 1910.\n\nST. FRANCIS ACADEMY ACCREDITED WITH THE NEBRASKA STATE UNIVERSITY, 1912\n\nJuly 19, the Lourdes grotto, donated by Mr, and Mrs. H. W. Abts, in memory of the cure of their daughter, Clara, was installed ($200.00). The candelabra ($25.00) was given by Miss Clara Abts.\n\nIn 1912, through the combined efforts of Sr. Agnella and the Rev. Cyriac Stempel, O. F. M., St. Francis Academy was accredited with the Nebraska State University. The installment of a laboratory for the teaching of the Natural Sciences was the only change necessitated thereby. It was installed without delay. In 1913, the congested condition of the school was relieved by the opening of St. Anthony's Polish parochial school, and the withdrawal of seventy Polish pupils.\n\nST. FRANCIS ACADEMY ALUMNI ASSOCIATION ORGANIZED A. D. 1912\n\nFollowing the custom of other higher institutions of learning, the graduates of St. Francis Academy organized an Alumni Association, June, 1915.\n\nThe first officers of the St. Francis' Alumni Association (S.

Gerharda\n\nFIRE AT THE ACADEMY\n\nOwing to defective wiring a dangerous fire broke out in the old building. It was noticed shortly after recess in the afternoon. The children were all marched out without an accident. The fire spread from the old building along the roof to the chapel. Although the firemen were on hand soon after the alarm had been given, the walls of the beautiful chapel were smoked and the beautiful paintings destroyed. The Blessed Sacrament had been removed, the sacred vestments and the altar linens bundled up and taken out. The pews, some windows, and the altars and statues at the extreme north end escaped damage. The walls below, however, were injured and the basement flooded. During the fire the firemen had stretched ropes to keep the spectators from coming to grief. It was a heavenly blessing in misfortune that the fire was discovered in day time and that there was not a strong wind to fan the voracious element--else a catastrophe might have resulted. The loss of about $7,000 was almost counterbalanced by an insurance of $6,000. Fr. Cyriac had the damage repaired.\n\nSR. M. JOSEPHA DIERKMANN, O. S. FR.\n\nAnna Friederica Dierkmann was born as one of six children to the union of Wm. and Wilhelmina (nee Almen) Dierkmann at Nord-Nerrin near Hamm on the Lippe River. She began to attend school at the age of 4 years and a half. Rev. Ferd. Heitmeier, her pastor, helped her to gain admission into the convent. On October 15, 1870, she entered at Olpe and was invested on April 20, 1871. Her eldest Sister, Sister M. Augustine, also entered on April 20, 1871. After some time spent at the Werne convent, Sister Josepha with six others, viz: Sister M. Jacoba (still at St. Mary's Hospital, Columbus) Raphaela, Justina, Elizabeth, Magdalena and Fidelis came to Lafayette, Indiana, on July 10, 1876, to found convents in America.\n\nWhen the Lafayette Sisters replaced the Joliet Sisters at Columbus, Sister Josepha was appointed Superior. She arrived at Columbus on July 27, 1882. During the time of her superiorship here she made many trips to Europe: in 1892, in the company of the foundress Mother Teresa Bonsel, for the election of the Mother General in 1892, 1904, 1911. She went on special business in 1901, 1913, 1921 and 1922. On\n\n270\n\nJune 2, 1900, sister Josepha was made Superioress Provincial with residence at Lafayette. On April 20, 1921, she celebrated her Golden Jubilee amid great solemnity. She passed to her reward on March 19, 1923.\n\nWhen the news was received at Columbus, a solemn Requiem was arranged for and held for the repose of her soul at St. Bonaventure's Church by the Rev. Chas. Schlueter, A good number of people attended. It is said that Mother Josepha could call by name all the 1100 Sisters in the Province, that she had in mind every detail of the extensive business affairs incident to her supervision over the many hospitals and schools maintained by her community in this country. R. I. P.\n\nLIFE OF SISTER AGNES, O. S. F.\n\n(DEC. 23, 1859-DEC. 9, 1918)\n\nOne of the best known Sisters of St. Francis' Academy of Columbus was Sister Agnes, born of Protestant parents, George and Louise Heffner, Caroline Heffner immigrated to America with her parents when about two years old. The vessel was wrecked on the coast of England, but the pasengers (sic), minus most of their belongings, finally went aboard a ship bound for the New World. The family first settled on a farm at Colburn, Indiana, and later on a site six miles west of Lafayette, Indiana. Caroline's early education was at the Wea View school. When the child was thirteen, her mother was cured of a peculiar disease, thought to be the work of witchcraft, by the prayers of a Catholic priest. The family was eventually received into the Church by Rev. Accursius Beine. In 1874 and 1875, Caroline attended the school at Oldenburg, and on Dec. 22, 1877, having joined the Franciscan Sisters previously, received the cap, when Mother Teresa Bonsel, foundress was there. She was invested Aug. 3, 1878, and made her little vows Nov. 21, 1882. Young Sister Agnes was placed in charge of the school at Reynolds, Indiana, about 1878 or 1879. She played the organ, when yet wearing the cap. Observing her fine taste for music, Sister Agnes was allowed to study music under Sisters Rose and Hildegard, two of the order's best musicians, as well as at Belleville, Illinois, and Creighton University at Omaha.\n\nSister Agnes came to Columbus in 1882 with Sister Josepha. She was very skilled and adept at embroidery and art as well as an accomplished artist in music. Appointed as the organist immediately, she was directress of St. Bonaventure Church Choir for many years. Sister Agnes was head of the Music Department of St. Francis' Academy all of her long stay in Columbus.\n\nSr. M. Aquina, Sr. M. Eleanore, Sr. M. Ludgera, Columbus, Nebr.\n\nDuring the plague of 1918 Sister Agnes fell victim to the flu. Stricken at the height of the epidemic, her funeral was very quiet, in conformance with the city's health regulations.\n\nHers was a noble life. Always gay and charming in her manners, she was known and loved by hundreds of pupils, whom she helped to equip for the battle of life on the Plains. Her record of thirty-six years of continuous teaching in Columbus and her final tragic death in the field she labored so long, makes her one of Platte County's most valuable pioneers. It is difficult to bring forth many other early residents of Columbus, who have contributed more than did Sister Agnes for the education of rugged Mid-Nebraska. R. I. P.\n\nSISTER M. AGNELLA BUCHER, O. S. F.\n\nLouise Bucher is the third child of Louis and Ottilia Bucher and was born at Dayton, Ohio, on March 17, 1862. She attended the parochial school of Emmanuel's Church, Rev. John Hahn, pastor. At the age of twelve, sickness compelled her to interrupt her studies for a year. She learned dressmaking and assisted her sister in this. Her father sought to dissuade her from entering the convent on account of her frail health, saying that within three months they would send her home a corpse. She was, finnally (sic) admitted Sept. 21, 1881. Growing stronger, she was sent to teach at St. Boniface School at Lafayette. On April 15, 1882, she received the habit and for the next two years taught at the Sacred Heart School, Emporia, Kansas. She came to Columbus on August 15, 1885, and taught what would now be the sixth to the\n\n271\n\neighth grades. When the school was graded in 1890, she was assigned the sixth and seventh grades. In summer, 1900, she succeeded Sister Josepha as superior of the Academy. She possessed great executive ability and energy to carry out her plans. Her work is mentioned above. It is said that she seldom made a mistake. She was also instrumental in founding the St. Francis Academy Alumni Association in 1915. In 1921, she accompanied Sister Josepha to Europe. Upon her return she was assigned to take charge of the High School at Gallup, New Mexico. From September, 1927, to August, 1928, she was stationed at Lumberton, New Mexico. In August, 1928, she was sent to St. Francis de Sales School, Lincoln, Nebraska. In January, 1929, she was again transferred this time to Dunnington, Indiana. Since August, 1929, she has returned to Columbus to act again as Superior.\n\nTHE SUPERIORS AT ST.
