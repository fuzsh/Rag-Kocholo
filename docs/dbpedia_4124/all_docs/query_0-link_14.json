        "text": "Marian University is a Roman Catholic university in Indianapolis, in the U.S. state of Indiana. Marian University has more than 2,700 full- and part-time students from the United States and other countries with a student-faculty ratio of 15:1.\n\nHistory\n\nMarian University was founded in 1851 by the Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg as a liberal arts school with a program for training teachers. Under the direction of Father Francis Joseph Rudolph and Mother Theresa Hackelmeier, teachers were trained at Oldenburg for more than a decade before Indiana adopted its first tax-supported normal school.\n\nOriginally known as St. Francis Normal, the school became a four-year, state-approved institution which merged with Immaculate Conception Junior College to form Marian College. In November 1936, the Sisters of St. Francis purchased the former James Allison estate, “Riverdale,” located in Indianapolis, as a site for Marian College.\n\nIn 1937, the college moved to Indianapolis under the direction of Mother M. Clarissa Dillhoff, after securing a state charter and purchasing the Riverdale estate in 1936. Allison Mansion became the new location of Marian College. The building housed the library, administrative offices, classrooms, and sleeping quarters for the Sisters. Classes began September 15, 1937.\n\nIn 1948 the college began an expansion project that included the addition of Clare Hall, the Gymnasium, and Marian Hall. In 1954, as the new Marian Hall was completed, the school became the first co-educational Catholic college in Indiana. Two years later, the North Central Association accredited Marian College. In 1970, a new 58,000-square-foot (5,400 m) library was completed. It was designed by Woollen, Molzan and Partners.\n\nThe National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education formally accepted all teacher education programs of the college in 1976. The Indiana State Board of Nursing approved the associate level nursing curriculum in 1977 and the baccalaureate program in 1987. The National League of Nursing has accredited both programs—the associate in 1986 and the baccalaureate in 1992. In 2000, Marian's Adult Programs (MAP) began offering bachelor's and associate's degrees in business.\n\nOn July 1, 2009, Marian College became Marian University. Over the course of several years prior to this, the college grew and expanded the academic curriculum, added a football team and marching band, adding and renovating buildings.\n\nOn January 15, 2010, Marian University announced plans to begin a college of osteopathic medicine; the second in the state of Indiana and the first Catholic osteopathic medical school due to the generosity of an anonymous donor’s $30 million pledge. On August 23, 2011 during the groundbreaking ceremony, the new school of osteopathic medicine was officially named after the erstwhile anonymous donor, AIT Labs CEO Michael A. Evans. Additionally, Margaret Mary Community Hospital pledged $150,000 to the College of Osteopathic Medicine dedicated to building a simulation lab and seminar room for the medical students.\n\nOn August 1, 2011 Greg Ballard, Mayor of the City of Indianapolis declared it \"President Daniel J. Elsener Day\" in the city. The proclamation came on the 10-year anniversary of President Elsener's service to Marian University.\n\nCampus\n\nMarian University is located about four miles northwest of downtown Indianapolis. The nearly 200 acre campus includes:\n\nThe Nina Mason Pulliam EcoLab, a 55-acre wetland and lowland forest located on the north end of the Marian University campus.\n\nThe Lake Sullivan Sports Complex, now known as the Indy Cycloplex.

That represents a climb of 16 spots since 2011, the largest gain by any college in that category during that time span.\n\nMarian University is organized into six schools with 36 majors and 37 minors:\n\nClark H. Byrum School of Business\n\nCollege of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nSchool of Education\n\nSchool of Liberal Arts\n\nSchool of Mathematics and Sciences\n\nAlan and Sue Leighton School of Nursing\n\nMarian University offers several routes to earning a teaching license via Teach for America, Indianapolis Teaching Fellows, traditional education program, Master’s Bridge to Teaching, Master of Arts in Teaching program, and the ACTION program. Marian University is one of the few universities to offer the Leadership Academy for Principals.\n\nMarian University College of Osteopathic Medicine opened in August 2013 with the first class expected to graduate in 2017. The university also offers accelerated degree programs in business for adults through Marian's Adult Programs (MAP).
