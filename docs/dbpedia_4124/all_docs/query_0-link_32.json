LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Education, Washington, D. G., May 1, 1913 . Sir : Large numbers of young men and women now apply for admis¬ sion to college, normal school, or professional school in other States and sections than those in which thfey have received their high-school preparation. Many apply for certificates to examining and certify¬ ing boards which have no direct means of knowing the standards of the high schools from which the applicants come. Many parents moving or contemplating moving from one State to another wish to know what high schools are accredited by State universities and recog¬ nized by examining and certifying boards. For these and many other reasons there is a demand for such a list of accredited high schools as has been prepared by Dr. Kendric C. Babcock, specialist in higher education in this bureau. I therefore recommend that this list, with the accompanying explanations, be published as a bulletin of the Bureau of Education. Respectfully submitted. P. P. Claxton, Commissioner . The Secretary of the Interior. 5 ACCREDITED SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. The lists of accredited secondary schools in the different States which are presented in this bulletin are designed to meet the needs of officers charged with the admission of new students to secondary schools, colleges, universities, professional schools (especially schools of law and medicine), normal schools, etc., of State examining and certifying boards, which are concerned with the status of secondary schools located at a distance, and parents who may want to know about the high schools of any particular State or section. The improvement during the past two decades in the number, scope, efficiency, and popular estimation of secondary schools of all kinds is unparalleled in tne educational history of the United States. From 1890-91 to 1900-1901 the number of secondary schools, both public and private, rose from 4,885 schools, with 309,996 students, to 8,210 schools, with 649,951 students; by 1910-11 these figures had increased to 12,213 schools, with 1,115,326 students. In 1911-12 there were 13,268 schools and 1,246,827 students. The schools belong to many types, ranging from those with only the strictly classical curriculum to those which are essentially vocational high schools organized with little or no reference to higher education. Among them are one-year, two-year, three-year, and four-year schools. From the one-year, one-teacher rural high school, practically without equipment, they reach up to great metropolitan high schools, with buildings, equip¬ ment, teaching staff, and registration rivaling universities. In differ¬ ent sections, and even in the same section of a single State, wide differences appear in strength, stability, soundness of organization, and direction of effort. High schools change with surprising swiftness, even in the older States. What was last year a registered three-year high school in New York often becomes this year a registered four-year high school. During the past decade a steady stiffening of the requirements for admission has occurred. Only the better high schools have been able to keep pace with these changes and to meet fully these requirements. Strong new schools spring up in sections like southern California, Washington, and Oregon. The whole system of secondary education of a State may undergo in half a decade a thorough reorganization and uplift; the State of Virginia offers an example. The movement of families for residence, and of individuals for edu¬ cational opportunities, from one part of the country to another is now 8 ACCREDITED SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. an everyday occurrence. A thousand miles counts for very little. When the principals of such schools as the Los Angeles High School in California, or the Central High School of Washington, D. C., or the registration officers of institutions like the University of Chicago, the Medico-Chirurgical College of Philadelphia, or the University of Washington, attempt to estimate the standards and standing of sec¬ ondary schools in Malden, Mass.; Sumter, S. C.; San Antonio, Tex.; or Billings, Mont., large difficulties are fairly sure to arise, especially if such schools do not appear in the lists prepared by organizations like the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. The system of accepting credentials or certificates from secondary schools in lieu of written examinations for admission to colleges and universities began with the University of Michigan, in 1871. Except for a small number of universities and colleges of the East, the major¬ ity of universities, colleges, technological schools, normal schools, professional schools, and State certifying boards have now adopted this system in some form, for full or partial satisfaction of admission requirements. In New York State, which exercises the most thoroughgoing super¬ vision of its secondary and higher education, four grades of schools are registered by the State education department as affording suitable facilities for maintaining approved courses of stated length: Junior (one year), middle (two years), senior (three years), and high schools (four years). Ohio has “ accredited schools” (satisfactory four-year schools) and “ recognized schools” (doing at least three years of work satisfactorily). South Carolina has class A (four-year curriculum, minimum of 14 units), class B (three-year curriculum, minimum of 12 units), class C (three-year curriculum, minimum of 10 units), class D (three or four year curriculum, with less than 10 units), and class E (with less than two teachers). Two general methods are in use for carrying on the system of accrediting, both of them involving the direct or indirect authority of the State. In the first, the inspection of the work of the high schools is done through an officer or committee of the State university, and the list of acceptable or accredited high schools is published in the catalogue of the university, and thus made available for other institutions within the same State or for institutions in neighboring States. In the second, the inspection and rating are done by the State superintendent of public instruction, the State board of educa¬ tion, or the State education office, acting through specially appointed officers. Examples of the former method are the Universities of Michigan, Cahfomia, and Texas; of the latter method the States of New York, Ohio, and Minnesota. Occasionally private institutions in combination, as in the New England College Entrance Certificate Board, or individually, as the Case School of Applied Science, have ACCREDITED SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 9 carried on their own investigation and accrediting. In some other cases individual institutions supplement the generally accepted list of accredited schools and for reasons varying in soundness admit students from schools not officially recognized by the State univer¬ sity or other State agency. By the term “ accredited secondary school,” as used in this bulletin, is meant a secondary school which requires for graduation at least 15 units of secondary work above a standard eight-grade grammar- school course and which has been investigated and approved by one of the agencies mentioned above. Some variation from this defini¬ tion has been accepted in the case of certain of the Southern States, whose high schools are organized for the most part upon the seven- year elementary course as a basis. The following authoritative defi¬ nition of the word “unit” has been made by the National Conference Committee on Standards of Colleges and Secondary Schools, which is made up of representatives of the National Association of State Universities, the New England College Entrance Certificate Board, the College Entrance Examination Board, the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the Middle States and Maryland, the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the Southern States, the New England Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, and the United States Commissioner of Education: A unit represents a year’s study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year’s work. This statement is designed to afford a standard of measurement for the work done in secondary schools. It takes — (1) The four-year high-school course as a basis and assumes that — (2) The length of the school year is from 36 to 40 weeks; that — (3) A period is from 40 to 60 minutes in length; and that — (4) The study is pursued for four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year’s work in any subject can not be accomplished in less than 120 sixty-minute hours, or their equivalent. Schools organized on any other than a four-year basis can nevertheless estimate their work in terms of this unit. It should be noted in this connection that there is a wide range in the subjects which may be offered in fulfillment of the 15 units pre¬ scribed for the schools in different States. The subjects recognized by the College Entrance Examination Board as permissible in the standard high-school course are briefly: English up to . Mathematics up to Latin . Greek . French . German . . . 91694°— 13 - 2 Units. 3 Spanish. 3J History.. 4 Science. 3 Drawing. 3 Music . . . 3 Units. 2 4 4 1 2 10 ACCREDITED SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. On the other hand, there are State universities and privately endowed institutions, like Leland Stanford Junior University, which permit great enlargement of the range of electives. The University of Minnesota, for example, accepts the following: Units. English . 3 or 4 Mathematics . 2 -3^ Latin . 2-4 Greek . 2 French . 2-4 German . 2 -4 Spanish . 2-4 Scandinavian . 2-4 History and social science . ^-6 Natural science . ^-6 Units. Vocational subjects . ^-4 Business arithmetic . ^ Business law . £ Bookkeeping . 1 -2 Stenography and typewriting . 1 -2 Freehand drawing . 2 Mechanical drawing . 2 Shopwork . 2 Modeling and wood carving. . . 1 Domestic art and science up to . 4 Agriculture . 1 -4 The requirement of the completion of a standard four-year high- school course representing at least 14 units, for admission to college, or as a part of the prescription for admission to professional schools or to the practice of professions, has produced a group of organiza¬ tions one of whose chief features is to coordinate standards of sec¬ ondary education in neighboring States. Such sectional organiza¬ tions are now actively at work in the North Central States, the Middle States and Maryland, New England, and the Southern States. In the preparation of lists of accredited schools presented in this bulletin, the chief reliance has in general been placed upon the lists of schools accredited by State universities and by State offices of education. Where the latter print lists of high schools of different grades, only the schools of the first grade are included, unless specific notice is otherwise given. It is assumed that the school thus placed in the first grade is prepared to offer in acceptable manner the 14 or 15 units, according to the definition just given, which are necessary for admission to a standard college or university; that the curriculum represents four years of 36 or more weeks each; that at least three teachers give their whole time to high-school work; that units of science include satisfactory laboratory work; and that the school keeps up an adequate library and laboratory equipment. The schools are listed alphabetically, according to the towns in which they are located; the names of the principals are added, though the changes in principals are so frequent that only an approxi¬ mation to accuracy is possible. The names of accredited private secondary schools and academies are printed in italics. An annota¬ tion is also made showing the agencies of the State university or State office accrediting each school, whether public or private; for example, the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. No attempt has been made to indicate the individual ACCREDITED SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 11 colleges or professional schools recognizing the work of a distant high school. It is a common practice among institutions of a given State to accept credentials which are satisfactory to the State uni¬ versity or the State education office of a neighboring State having the same general standards of organization and administration of its secondary school system. Lists such as these are bound to be out of date in a short time, and credentials of earlier years from many of the schools listed should be received with caution. Only in the case of New York has it been feasible to indicate the names of the schools which have been added to the accredited list within the past year. Probably the list for nearly every State contains schools which have been recently added and whose earlier certificates would not pass current at face value in their own States. In nearly all the Southern States the system of State high-school inspection, made possible through the cooperation of the General Education Board, is of comparatively recent origin. The inspector in each case is made a member of the State university faculty. Very great improvement has followed the appointment of these inspectors, an improvement evidenced by the notably rapid lengthening of the list of approved high schools published since 1910, by such States as South Carolina, Georgia, and Mississippi. In such cases special scrutiny should be given to credentials dated earlier than 1910. LIST OF ACCREDITED SECONDARY SCHOOLS Giving location, name of institution, and principal. ALABAMA.
