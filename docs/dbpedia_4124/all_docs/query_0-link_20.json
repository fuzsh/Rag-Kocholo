        "text": "By STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nTo say there is excitement in the South Decatur Junior/Senior High School community would be an understatement.\n\nThe Greensburg, Ind.-based Cougars just beat Oldenburg Academy 4-1, Waldron 4-0 and Southwestern of Shelbyville 4-1 to reign at the IHSAA Class 1A Jac-Cen-Del Sectional.\n\nIt’s South Decatur’s third all-time sectional title and the others came in 1972 and 1976.\n\n“We’re excited,” says second-year Cougars head coach Anthony Jarvis. “The boys seem pumped. They’e ready to go. They’re confident. I’m confident.”\n\nSouth Decatur (16-5) has earned the right to play in a one-game IHSAA regional against Indianapolis Lutheran (16-15) at 1 p.m. Saturday, June 1 at Morristown. The winner moves on to the four-team 1A South Semistate.\n\nThe preparation week is going include a focus on defense.\n\n“We’ve got to get the ball in quicker with our outfielders,” says Jarvis. “We’ve just got to make the routine plays. We’ve been doing that all year. We’ve just got to continue that.”\n\nMoving on to regional means Jarvis gets to keep repeating a 2024 rallying cry.\n\n“It’s a different day, but the same game — Do You Believe?,” says Jarvis. “That has been our saying this year.\n\n“The boys have taken that and ran with it.”\n\nRunning is something the Cougars do well with 121 stolen bases in 21 games.\n\nThe leaders are freshman Corey Nugent (25), sophomore J.P. Scudder (20), senior Devin Pate (16), senior Colby Rathburn (16), junior Corbin Johnson (11) and senior Alex Myers (9).\n\nSays Jarvis, “We have a lot of speed on our team and take advantage of miscues.”\n\nThe adjective Jarvis uses to describe South Decatur pitching is “phenomenal.”\n\nThe staff is paced by right-hander Pate (10-2, 0.96 earned run average), lefty J.P. Scudder (5-0, 0.91) and righty Nugent (1-1, 3.12).\n\nIn terms of average, the Cougars top hitters are\n\nNugent (.466), Rathburn (.406), Pate (.357), sophomore Grady Scudder .351) and J.P. Scudder .339).\n\nJarvis says Pate is deciding whether to pursue college baseball or enter the work force after graduation.\n\nOne recent graduate — Avery Seegers (Class of 2023) – is on the baseball team at Indiana University Columbus.\n\nThe SD coaching staff also features Garry Sauley, Wayne Pate, Shane Lakins, Brandon Scudder and Austin Petro.\n\nSouth Decatur (enrollment around 270) is a member of the Mid-Hoosier Conference (with Edinburgh, Hauser, Morristown, North Decatur, Southwestern of Shelbyville and Waldron). The Cougars were 10-2 in the MHC and placed second.\n\nThe other teams in the 2024 were Jac-Cen-Del Sectional were Jac-Cen-Del and North Decatur.\n\nSouth Decatur plays and practices on-campus. The field recently received upgrades to the dugouts and press box. A concrete pad was placed under the bleachers.\n\n“We’re making some small progress,” says Jarvis.\n\nFor eight years, there has been a middle school baseball program. This spring, there were about 15 seventh and eighth graders.\n\n“Being a small school we have multiple-sport athletes and a lot of them don’t play travel ball,” says Jarvis. “Integrating that middle school program is huge for our school. I’m able to sit down and talk with the boys to let them know what I’m looking for. They’re learning the basics so when they come to me (at the high school), we can move on to the next step of getting better so we can compete.”\n\nThe past two years, there have been enough players at the high school to have a junior varsity schedule.\n\nJarvis took South Decatur to a 17-8 mark and a tie with Hauser atop the MHC standings in 2023.\n\nHis first six seasons in the program were as an assistant coach.\n\nPrior to that he helped coach middle school and varsity baseball at Jennings County and travel ball with Columbus-based Demand Command.\n\nJarvis was a pitcher and center fielder at Jennings County, graduating in 2003.\n\nHis head coach was Bob Howe.\n\nJarvis credits Howe for teaching him patience and a winning mindset.\n\n“You go into every game knowing you’re going to win,” says Jarvis.\n\nFor his day job, Jarvis is a JAG (Jobs for America’s Graduates) Specialist. As part of his job description, he “identifies, recruits, and instructs students deemed to have a high degree of difficulty of being promoted into the next grade level, achieving graduation, and/or making a successful transition from school to a career with advancement opportunities.”\n\nBree Geswein is Jarvis’ fiancee.\n\nBY STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nBrandon Kessler took over as head baseball coach at Morristown (Ind.) Junior/Senior High School leading into the 2020 season.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic took those games and practices way, but four years later Kessler can say the Yellow Jackets met several of the goals he start from the start.\n\n“We wanted to build the program back up,” says Kessler, noting Morristown won one game in 2019 and four in 2018 and participation numbers were low and that the Yellow Jackets went 12-12 in both 2022 and 2023. “We had to build the trust of the kids and challenge on a daily basis whether its through their academics or on the field.\n\n“The last two years we’ve had enough kids to have a varsity and junior varsity and have had a steady stream of kids that believe in the program. Last year we hit our mark of having almost the same amount of kids in each grade. Getting the athletes to come back to (baseball) was a major goal. I think we’ve accomplished that.\n\n“It’s heading in the right direction.”\n\nKessler coached travel ball for the Indiana Sliders (formerly Shelby County Sliders) through this past summer as players reached 17U. A few year ago, he helped start junior high baseball at Morristown.\n\nA 1992 Shelbyville High School graduate, Kessler played baseball for then-Golden Bears coach Dave Hunton and went on to earn an undergraduate at Purdue University and an advanced degree at the University of Illinois. He is a research agronomist based on the family farm in Manilla, Ind. (Rush County).\n\nAnother goal reached is that there are four to six players in each grade.\n\nMorristown (enrollment around 170) is a member of the Mid-Hoosier Conference (with Edinburgh, Hauser, North Decatur, South Decatur, Southwestern of Shelbyville and Waldron).\n\nThe Yellow Jackets are part of an IHSAA Class 1A sectional grouping in 2024 with Edinburgh, Eminence, Greenwood Christian Academy, Indianapolis Lutheran and Indianapolis Metropolitan. Morristown has won two sectional titles — 1998 and 2008.\n\nAs a small school, multi-sport athletes are essential to the programs at Morristown. In the fall, the Yellow Jackets are involved in cross country, soccer and tennis.\n\nKessler is also planning to conduct workouts during the IHSAA Limited Contact Period Aug. 28-Oct. 14 for five or six weeks. When the winter contact period comes, players will also hit the weight room.\n\nMorristown’s home diamond is located on south end of campus next to the school’s soccer/track and softball facilities.\n\n“We are extremely proud of this field,” says Kessler. “In my opinion it’s one of the best in the state.”\n\nThe spacious grass layout has a center field fence 395 feet from home plate.\n\nThe Yellow Jackets hosted IHSAA sectional and regional (1A and 3A) tournaments in 2023. This summer the field received a significant amount of drainage.\n\nKessler’s 2024 assistants are Robbie Rogers, Brandon Kleine and Chance Collingwood.\n\nBesides the junior high program, players come to Morristown via Shelby County Babe Ruth and leagues in Greenfield and New Palestine.\n\nBrandon and Leigh Kessler have been married 26 years. The couple have two sons — Wyatt (20) and Grant (18).\n\nA 2023 Morristown graduate, Grant Kessler played tennis and baseball (he struck out a state-leading 142 batters based on MaxPreps and was an Indiana High School Baseball Coaches Association Class 1A first-team all-state selection last spring) for the Yellow Jackets and is now student and left-handed pitcher at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati.\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nSouth Ripley High School in Versailles, Ind., has had its share of baseball success.\n\nFrom 2016-19, the Raiders averaged nearly 16 wins per season.\n\nThe team had plenty of veterans in 2020, but that season was lost to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2021, South Ripley won its eighth sectional title — the first since 2008. That team featured Indiana High School Baseball Coaches Association North/South All-Star Series selection Brady Linkel (now at Ohio University).\n\nJeff Greiwe, a Raiders assistant to Steve Franklin the past several years whose middle son Aaron was a senior ballplayer in 2020, has been named South Ripley head coach as the team prepares for 2022.\n\nAs head coach, Greiwe plans to assert the importance of fundamentals and attention to detail.\n\n“If you want the big things to happen, you’ve got to do the little things right,” says Greiwe. “Bunting, base running, throwing strikes — those things will definitely be emphasized.\n\n“We’re going to be extremely young. We’re going to start several freshmen.”\n\nAmong those is catcher Trent Smith.\n\nKeeping everyone involved is also a Greiwe strength.\n\n“I make it a point to use everybody during the game,” says Greiwe.\n\nSouth Ripley (enrollment around 370) is a member of the Ohio River Valley Conference (with Jac-Cen-Del, Milan, Rising Sun, Shawe Memorial, Southwestern of Hanover and Switzerland County).\n\nORVC teams play each other twice during the season.\n\nIn 2021, the Raiders were part of an IHSAA Class 2A sectional grouping with Milan, North Decatur, South Decatur, Southwestern of Hanover and Switzerland County.\n\nSouth Ripley plays its home games on-campus at Forest G. Waters Field. A few years ago, the mound was re-done and new bullpen mounds and dugouts were installed.\n\n“We’ve got a strong tradition in baseball and one of the better fields in southeastern Indiana,” says Greiwe. “It’s up to me to keep the field to a very high standard.”\n\nGreiwe (pronounced (Gry-vee), who teaches high school Geometry, keep things going in the summer and fall for whomever was going to be the head coach and that turned out to be him. He was approved by the school board this month.\n\nGreiwe coached the 14U Redlegs Baseball Club in the summer and fall of 2021.\n\nAs has been the case for years, local players took part in high school and junior team fall leagues at the CERA Sports Park and Camp Ground in Columbus, Ind.\n\nAfter helping get the junior high baseball program off the ground, Greiwe moved up the South Ripley coaching ranks.\n\nBrian Smith, who has coached at the junior high level the past few years, is part of the South Ripley high school staff. Greiwe is talking to other possible 2022 assistants.\n\nA 1998 graduate of Greensburg (Ind.) Community High School when the Pirates were coached by Roger Cash, Greiwe earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Education from Ball State University.\n\nGreiwe has been head coach at Milan in two different stints, helped former high school classmate Doug Behlmer at Oldenburg (Ind.) Academy and was head coach at North Decatur.\n\nPrior to teaching at South Ripley, Greiwe was an elementary then middle school math teacher at Milan.\n\nJeff, who is married to South Ripley Elementary teacher and former head volleyball coach Robyn Greiwe, has also coached sons Shayne, Aaron Griewe and Peyton during their travel ball years.\n\nShayne Griewe (Class of 2018) served in the U.S. Navy and is now working in Florida. Aaron Griewe is in the Navy and stationed in Norfolk, Va. Peyton Owens (Class of 2020) is studying music at Dark Horse Institute in Franklin, Tenn.\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nDennis Smith has been head baseball coach at Edinburgh (Ind.) High School since the 2019.\n\nHe already knows a point of emphasis for 2022.\n\n“Pitching,” says Smith. “Last year we won one game. In 17 gams, we had 148 walks.\n\n“Throwing strikes will be crucial this (coming) year.”\n\nThree pitchers — seniors Ian Buchanan and Riley Palmer and sophomore Gabe Bennett — return. Senior Travis Jones and junior Max Blanford are also expected to get a turn on the mound.\n\nThe 2021-22 school year is the first where Edinburgh athletes are allowed to participate in two sports during the game season. Smith says Blanford will split his time between golf and baseball.\n\nSmith, who teaches eighth grade math at Edinburgh, was a Lancers assistant on the staff of Cole Zook in 2013-14 and helped Jason Burke one season prior to taking over the program.\n\nA 2003 Edinburgh graduate, middle infielder Smith played for head coach Todd Tatlock as a senior and was a teammate of current Southwestern of Shelbyville coach Chris Ingels (Edinburgh Class of 2002).\n\n“I still pick his brain,” says Smith of Tatlock, an Edinburgh alum who was an All-American at Indiana State University. “I still call him or get with him when I can.”\n\nAn IHSAA Limited Contact Period goes from Aug. 30-Oct. 16. Smith says Edinburgh does not plan to start baseball activities until January.\n\n“I can’t (practice in the fall),” says Smith, who works at a school with an enrollment around 235 and plenty of baseball players involved in fall sports. “We’ve got to share your kids as much as possible.”\n\nSmith says he expects a few players to find the time to play in a Sunday fall baseball league in Columbus.\n\nA feeder for the high school program is the Edinburgh Park and Recreation/Babe Ruth League.\n\nEdinburgh is a member of the Mid-Hoosier Conference (with Hauser, Morristown, North Decatur, South Decatur, Southwestern of Shelbyville and Waldron).\n\nIn 2021, the Lancers were part of an IHSAA Class 1A sectional grouping with Greenwood Christian Academy, Indianapolis Lutheran, Morristown, Southwestern of Shelbyville and Waldron. Edinburgh has won four sectional titles — the last in 2017.\n\nLancer Field at Steve Hollenbeck Sports Complex is the home diamond for Edinburgh baseball.\n\nPlans call for a new mound to be installed next week.\n\n“We hope to put in four new loads of dirt in the infield,” says Smith.\n\nChris Hoffman and Coltan Henderson are assistant coaches. Smith says another may be added to the staff.\n\nDennis and wife Hannah have three children — daughters Reese (9) and Reagan (6) and son Ryan (who turns 2 in November).\n\nWhen he’s not teaching or coaching, Dennis likes to compete in bass fishing tournaments.\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nChris Ingels has watched an exceptional group of athletes make their way through Southwestern Junior-Senior High School near Shelbyville, Ind.\n\nThe Class of 2021 played a part in a 14-11 baseball season in 2018 — the first winning season in program history since 1976. The Spartans went 17-9 on the diamond in 2019 and lost the 2020 season to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSo far in 2020-21, Southwestern has earned IHSAA Class 1A sectional titles in boys soccer and boys basketball.\n\n“They’ve contributed so much to our school,” says Ingels, who heads into his eighth season as Southwestern head baseball coach this spring and is also a boys basketball assistant and head cross country coach at the school where he is also a Social Studies and Physical Education teacher. “They’re pretty special kids and great students.\n\n“When you have really good players it makes the coach look smart.”\n\nOf the Spartans’ six seniors (Anick Harstell, Christian DeArmitt, Ethan Wending, Chance Johnson, Blake Dunbar and Kirk Van Gorden), five played as sophomores with Hartsell, DeArnitt, Wending and Johnson in the starting lineup.\n\nTwo juniors (Aiden Hartsell and Jordan Jones) started as freshmen. Matthew Clements is a talented sophomore who grew up in the Indiana Bulls organization. Southwestern lost two players to graduation in 2020.\n\nIngels’ 2021 assistant is South Dearborn High School graduate and Franklin College senior Alex Smith.\n\nLocated seven miles from Shelbyville and close to the community of Marietta, Southwestern (enrollment around 175) is a member of the Mid-Hoosier Conference (with Edinburgh, Hauser, Morristown, North Decatur, South Decatur and Waldron).\n\nMHC games are played on consecutive days as home-and-home series.\n\n“You have to have multiple pitchers, which I like,” says Ingels.\n\nThe Spartans are part of an IHSAA Class 1A sectional grouping with Edinburgh, Greenwood Christian Academy, Indianapolis Lutheran, Morristown (the 2021 host) and Waldron. Southwestern won its lone sectional crown in 1999.\n\nSouthwestern is to open the 2021 season at home April 5 against Eminence.\n\nOpponents not in the conference or sectional include Austin, Oldenburg Academy, Shelbyville, Brown County, Indiana School for the Deaf, Trinity Lutheran, Arsenal Tech and Herron.\n\nThe Spartans could see Triton Central in the Shelby County Tournament at Morristown on May 8.\n\nThere are 17 players in the Southwestern program. Ingels says a few junior varsity games will be sprinkled in to get younger players some playing experience.\n\nThe Spartans play home games on-campus at the Jeremy Wright Athletic Complex.\n\nThe high school program is fed by a junior high club. Seventh and eighth graders play some games in the spring then take part in the Babe Ruth League at Edinburgh during the summer.\n\n“It’s really beneficial,” says Ingels.\n\nIngels, played tennis for Kevin Rockey, Rodney Klein and Pete Khensouri, basketball for Steve Todd and baseball for Derick Bright and Brian Ingels (his father) at Edinburgh High School and graduated in 2002.\n\nTodd was the first to talk to Chris about coaching and gave him the opportunity to volunteer with the Lancers.\n\n“(Bright) was a really good baseball coach,” says Ingels. “He changed the way we practiced. Everything was structured. In (batting practice), we’d have two-strike swings, hit-and-run swings, bunt, hit to the right side and swing away.”\n\nBrian Ingels, who had been head football coach at Edinburgh when Chris was young and a longtime cross country and track coach at the school. He was Bright’s assistant before stepping in as head baseball coach for his son’s senior year. The Industrial Arts instructor is currently in his 43rd year of teaching at Edinburgh.\n\nIngels began coaching boys basketball before finishing at Franklin College in 2007 as an assistant to Edinburgh head coach Todd Tatlock.\n\nAfter that, Ingels aided Kerry Brown then Toby Carrigan at South Dearborn before helping Brent Keck at Perry Meridian. He is on Brady Days’ staff at Southwestern.\n\nLance Marshall, the Franklin College head baseball coach, has let Ingels sit in on Grizzlies practice and has offered advice.\n\n“He’s a great guy,” says Ingels.\n\nIngels values his relationships and connections to his young athletes.\n\n“Through baseball you are dealing with a lot of failure and adversity,” says Ingels. “You’re trying to get kids to be able to handle that and push their way through it and succeed in the end.”\n\nIngels sees a lot of lessons in baseball.\n\n“It starts with preparation and having to put a lot of work into each little part,” says Ingels. “That adds up in the end.”\n\nThe coach appreciates the team aspect of the sport and that you’re\n\n“A lot of people think baseball is an individual sport on your own island at each position and getting your stats at the plate,” says Ingels. “It’s the ultimate team sport when it comes down to it.”\n\nOne player can’t carry the whole load.\n\nOn the offensive side, Ingels sees worth in batting average. But that doesn’t rank first in his eyes.\n\n“On-base percentage is so much more important,” says Ingels. “We’ve got to get men on base.”\n\nWhile the Spartans may not chart it in 2021, there will be discussions about quality at-bats.\n\n“Sometimes a groundout to the right side can be productive,” says Ingels.\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nTommy Coy enjoys being part of the fraternity that is the Indiana High School Baseball Coaches Association.\n\nThrough the organization, he’s got to know diamond leaders from all over the state — men like Andrean’s Dave Pishkur, Jasper’s Terry Gobert, Southwestern of Hanover’s Dan Thurston, Fishers’ Matt Cherry, Noblesville’s Justin Keever and so many more.\n\n“I feel really lucky,” says Coy, who is heading into his first season as head coach at Waldron (Ind.) Junior-Senior High School in Shelby County. “There are a lot of guys I can seek council from all over the place.\n\n“They want baseball to be great in this state. They’ll give you any piece of advice you need and do anything to grow the game.”\n\nCoy was going to be an assistant to Doug Burcham before the 2020 season was called off because the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWaldron (enrollment around 160) is a member of the Mid-Hoosier Conference (with Edinburgh, Hauser, Morristown, North Decatur, South Decatur, Southwestern of Shelbyville).\n\nThe Mohawks are part of an IHSAA Class 1A sectional grouping with Edinburgh, Greenwood Christian Academy, Indianapolis Lutheran, Morristown (the 2021 host) and Southwestern (Shelbyville). Waldron’s lone sectional title came in 2001.\n\nThe 2021 season opener is slated for Monday, April 5 at Rising Sun (vote-getter in the IHSBCA 1A preseason poll) with the home opener Tuesday, April 6 against 1A No. 2 Oldenburg Academy.\n\nBesides MHC and sectional opponents, the Mohawk slate also features Indiana School for the Deaf, Columbus Christian, Indianapolis Manual, Irvington Preparatory Academy, Jac-Cen-Del, Tri, Knightstown and Triton Central.\n\nSouthwestern is No. 3 and Hauser No. 6 in the 1A preseason rankings and Knightstown is receiving votes in 2A.\n\nWith 16 players — up from the usual 11 or 12 — Coy says the Mohawks will play only a varsity schedule this spring.\n\nCoy’s 2021 assistants are all Waldron graduates — Cam Wells (Class of 2018), Nate Bernard (2019) and Cole Chappelow (2020).\n\nThe 2020-21 school year is Coy’s second in Shelby Eastern Schools (which includes Waldron and Morristown) where he teaches U.S. History, Psychology and Sociology. At various times, he educates sixth through 12th graders.\n\nCoy has also been an assistant boys basketball coach on the Waldron staff of Beau Scott.\n\nWaldron Junior-Senior serves the communities of Waldron, Geneva, St. Paul and some students outside Shelbyville.\n\nIn 2019, Coy spent one season as pitching coach on the staff of Shelbyville head coach Royce Carlton.\n\nBefore that, Coy spent five seasons aiding IHSBCA Hall of Famer John Froedge at Crawfordsville and six helping Rick Cosgray at Lebanon.\n\n“I’ve had a nice little gambit to learn from and coach under,” says Coy. “(Carlton) is a bright young coach. He eats it up.\n\n“They do it differently, but (Cosgray) and (Froedge) were awesome mentors for me.”\n\nCarlton helped Coy upgrade the infield at Waldron’s on-campus field.\n\nThere are five high schools in Shelby County — Waldron, Morristown, Shelbyville, Southwestern (Shelbyville) and Triton Central. Coy and Carlton would like to see a county league for younger players with teams feeding their respective schools.\n\nAt present, younger players can go to the Shelby County Babe Ruth League or Greensburg Youth Baseball League.\n\nA 2002 graduate of Western Boone Junior-Senior High School in Thorntown, Ind., Coy played for Stars head coach Don Jackson and pitching coach Rob Ebert (who also coached him during the summer). His father, Doug Coy, was also a WEBO assistant.\n\nJackson had a passion for baseball and expected his players to respect the game by playing hard.\n\nEbert taught Coy how to “turn the ball over” to get it to move in on a right-handed batter.\n\n“If we can pitch inside I think we’ll have a lot of success at Waldron for sure,” says Coy.\n\nBefore arm issues cropped up, right-hander Coy pitched two seasons at Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Ind., where Tom Flynn was the Little Giants head coach and Cory Stevens the pitching coach.\n\nFlynn was the Old School, in-your-face type of coach.\n\n“He’d get the most out of you,” says Coy. “He genuinely cared for his players.”\n\nStevens, who is now athletic director at Jennings County High School in North Vernon, Ind., let Coy know the importance of controlled movement and pitching backwards (throwing breaking balls and change-ups in counts were the hitter is usually looking for a fastball — 0-0, 1-0, 2-0, 3-1 and 3-2).\n\n“The change-up is most underutilized pitch in all of baseball,” says Coy. “It’s all the grip and takes time to develop. Kids don’t have the patience.\n\n“They want instant gratification.”\n\nCoy admires how Hall of Famer Greg Maddux — while not throwing in the upper 90’s — was able to craftily pin-point his pitches on the inside and outside corners of the plate and get lots of movement.\n\nTommy and Stacey Coy (a 2004 Waldron alum who was a senior in the pep band at the time the Mohawks went 27-0 and won the IHSAA Class 1A boys basketball state championship) have two sons — Kellen (9) and Karsten (7). The boys will have birthdays two days apart in May — Kellen on the 12th and Karsten the 14th.\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nNearly a decade after guiding a high school baseball program, Dan Thurston is back in that role.\n\nHired as School Resource Officer at Southwestern High School in Hanover, Ind., in January 2020, he became Rebels head baseball coach around mid-year.\n\nThurston was head coach at nearby Madison (Ind.) Consolidated High School 2009-11 while also serving as D.A.R.E officer in the junior high. He resigned as baseball coach when he became chief of the City of Madison Police Department.\n\nMeanwhile, he headed up Long Toss Indiana LLC and the Indiana Rawlings Tigers LLC, helping players with arm care and Mental Toughness Training.\n\nA few years ago, Thurston sold the businesses as a package. He was invited by head coach Grant Bellak to join the Hanover College coaching staff and had spent 2019 and 2020 with the Panthers when the opportunities came along at Southwestern.\n\n“One thing I really enjoyed about Hanover was the personal interaction with players,” says Thurston, who played tennis, basketball and baseball at Mooresville (Ind.) High School and baseball at Hanove. “They knew where they were in life and where they were going to go. They were thankful to play more baseball. But it’s probably not going to be their profession after college.\n\n“I learned so much in the last two years about how to run a program and how to run a practice. I think I’ll be a much better coach than I was before.”\n\nAs SRO, Thurston estimates that he spends more than half his time on relationships with the rest split between counseling and his law enforcement duties.\n\nUntil becoming coach, he got to know students as people and not as athletes.\n\nThurston took the coaching job in time to lead a few summer workouts in June and then guided IHSAA Limited Contact Period activities in the fall.\n\n“It was intrasquad games, (batting practice), infield drills and arm care. We did long toss to stretch arms out,” says Thurston. “Looking back on it, it more about me getting to the know the kids and the program and them getting to know me and my style.\n\n“My style has evolved over the years. At Madison — to a fault — I was a little bit of a control freak. Now I have really good assistants and I expect them to coach.”\n\nThurston’s Rebels staff includes Ethan Leach, Brian Crank and Brendon Bump.\n\nLeach played at Madison Consolidated and Indiana University Southeast. Crank, who is dean of students and junior varsity boys basketball coach at Southwestern, played at Franklin (Ind.) College an was a JV coach for Thurston at Madison. Pitching coach Bump took the mound for Marshall University (Huntington, W.Va.) and was on Shayne Stock’s Hanover coaching staff.\n\nWinter conditioning began at Southwestern last week. Thurston expects around 22 players for varsity and junior varsity teams in the spring.\n\nSouthwestern (enrollment around 375) is a member of the Ohio River Valley Conference (with Jac-Cen-Del, Milan, Rising Sun, Shawe Memorial, South Ripley and Switzerland County).\n\nORVC teams play each other twice on a home-and-home basis.\n\nThough it may not happen in 2021, Thurston says he would like those games to come in the same week.\n\n“That avoids team having one really good pitcher to space out their conference games and pitch the same kid in every game,” says Thurston. “You get more of a true team conference champion.”\n\nSuper ATV Field, located on the Southwestern campus, has a turfed home plate area. A new scoreboard — never used with the cancellation of the 2020 season — is expected to be in-place for the Rebels’ first home game of 2021.\n\nThurston says there’s talk of lighting the field and expanding the dugouts.\n\n“Of course that comes down to that almighty dollar,” says Thurston.\n\nThe Rebels are part of an IHSAA Class 2A sectional grouping with Milan, North Decatur, South Decatur, South Ripley and Switzerland County. Southwestern’s lone sectional title came in 1999.\n\nThe Madison Cubs are on the Rebels’ schedule. Southwestern has never beaten Madison in varsity baseball. When the Rebels won the Class 2A Jeffersonville Regional in 1999, the Cubs and Indiana Mr. Baseball Bryan Bullington won the 3A state championship.\n\n“I’m going to be low key,” says Thurston of this spring’s Southwestern-Madison meeting. “I’m going to treat it just like any other game.\n\n“There’s no pressure for us to win.”\n\nThurston is also a regional scout for SportsForce Baseball — a recruiting service that helps players find the best fit at the college level.\n\nLast summer, he was able to help athletes while serving as a tournament director for Pastime Tournaments.\n\n“I often tell players to take baseball out of the equation,” says Thurston. “Is it the right fit academically, financially and socially? Is it the right distance from home and the right size of school?\n\n“Check all the other boxes first. If baseball is important to you, let’s go somewhere we can play. Some are OK with being the program guy.”\n\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic has come extra years of eligibility for college players. Thurston says his gut tells him that it may be until 2023 before the trickle-down effect that hits younger college players — and even high schoolers — settles down.\n\nThere has traditionally been youth baseball run by the Hanover parks department. Southwestern schedules up to 20 games in the spring for its junior team of seventh and eighth graders.\n\nRecent Southwestern graduate Bailey Elliott is on the baseball roster at Vincennes (Ind.) University. Thurston says he expects the Rebels to produce more college players in the next few years.\n\nDan and wife Jackie Thurston will be married 32 years in March. The couple has three children — Trey (29), Ryan (26) and Trisha (22).\n\nTrey Thurston is in veterinary school at Lincoln Memorial University in Harrogate, Tenn.\n\nLeft-handed pitcher Ryan Thurston played at Madison Consolidated and Western Kentucky University and in the Toronto Blue Jays organization. He was with the independent Chicago Dogs and Gary SouthShore RailCats in 2019 and is expected to be back with that club in 2021. Gary did not field a team in 2020 and Thurston went with the indy Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks and Winnipeg Goldeyes.\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati graduate Trisha Thurston works for Fifth Third Bank in Cincinnati.\n\nBY STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nFour decades ago, David Bradshaw received an invitation from the Indiana High School Baseball Coaches Association to participate in the annual IHSBCA North/South All-Star Series.\n\nAs a left-handed pitcher at Jac-Cen-Del in Osgood, Ind., Bradshaw was selected in the 26th round of the 1979 Major League Baseball First-Year Player Draft by the Montreal Expos and signed before the series as did Evansville Memorial’s Don Mattingly and Rob Jackowiak of South Bend St. Joseph’s, Keith Call of Hammond Tech, Mike Jakubowicz of Hammond Clark and Bill Fink of Greenfield-Central.\n\nBradshaw went on to compete in the minors with the Expos in 1979 and Pittsburgh Pirates organization in 1980.\n\nFast forward to 2019 and Bradshaw just completed his 35th season as head coach at his alma mater and will be head coach for the South in the 2019 all-star event June 21-23 in Madison and Hanover. Practice was Friday and games are slated Saturday and Sunday at Madison Consolidated’s Gary O’Neal Field.\n\nWhy does Bradshaw stay with the game?\n\n“I just love the game,” says Bradshaw, who has won 499 games with seven invitational tournament, six conference, eight sectional, two regional and two Final Four appearances. “When I couldn’t play it anymore, I knew I wanted to become a teacher so I could coach. It’s been a really great ride over the last three and half decades.\n\n“I’ve coached just about everything there is a coach at Jac-Cen-Del. I wouldn’t have it any other way.”\n\nBradshaw, who led the Eagles boys basketball program to an IHSAA Class 1A state championship in 2008-09 and was head coach as recently as 2012-13, teaches physical education and health.\n\nHe points to the lessons learned on and around the court and the diamond.\n\n“You’re going to learn so many things from athletics,” says Bradshaw. “You’re going to learn not only how to work together. You’re going to learn how to be responsible. You’re going to have to learn to become determined and focused.\n\n“I like to see the kids come out of our program with idea that it takes teamwork for anything to happen just like it does in life.\n\n“You can have all kinds of determination on your own, but you need to have a support system, too.\n\n“It takes a lot of hard work and determination to get somewhere in life.”\n\nJac-Cen-Del (enrollment around 300) is a member of the Ohio River Valley Conference (with Milan, Rising Sun, Shawe Memorial, South Ripley, Southwestern of Hanover and Switzerland County).\n\nThe ORV plays a double round robin to determine its champion.\n\nIn 2018-19, the Eagles were part of an IHSAA Class 1A sectional grouping with Hauser, North Decatur, Oldenburg Academy, Rising Sun and South Decatur. Jac-Cen-Del has won eight sectional titles — the last in 2016.\n\nThe 2019 Eagles went 11-13.\n\n“I started eight sophomores,” says Bradshaw. “I’m looking forward to the next couple years.”\n\nBradshaw will get to be around the all-stars for a couple days, but he has advice for them.\n\n“I just want them to enjoy the moment,” says Bradshaw. “They must’ve done something right to get themselves here.\n\n“They don’t bring people in that are not good people and good athletes. It’s a pleasure and an hour to be here.”\n\nBradshaw is proud of JCD’s home field, saying it is one of the finest in southeastern Indiana.\n\n“We put a lot of time and effort into it,” says Bradshaw. “Everything was completely re-sodded on the inner portion of the diamond. Everything was re-done as far as the clay mixture and the meal mix.\n\n“We put in a new backstop and new fencing in the last 10 years. For a 1A school, it’s a pretty nice field.\n\n“(Batesville coach Justin) Tucker loves to come there and play.”\n\nDavid Bradshaw has been head baseball coach at his alma mater — Jac-Cen-Del High School — for 35 years. He has won 499 games. He is head coach of the South for the 2019 Indiana High School Baseball Coaches Association North/South All-Star Series at Madison.

It’s made that process of who’s in charge and how it’s run much smoother than I’ve expected.\n\n“I’ve gotten buy-in from the kids.”\n\nSouth Decatur, located 13 miles southwest of Greensburg, plays its game on its campus located along Indiana 3.\n\nThat field has been re-edged. Dirt and field conditioner have been added and it’s been rolled to get truer ground balls.\n\nA long-term project is replacing fencing.\n\n“We’re making small improvements every year,” says Foga.\n\nSouth Decatur (enrollment around 330) is a member of the Mid-Hoosier Conference (with Edinburgh, Hauser, Morristown, North Decatur, Southwestern of Shelbyville and Waldron).\n\nConference teams play each other twice in home-and-home series, usually on back-to-back days.\n\nThe Cougars are in an IHSAA sectional grouping with Hauser, Jac-Cen-Del, North Decatur, Oldenburg Academy and Rising Sun. Jac-Cen-Del has lights and has been the host site in recent years. South Decatur won its two sectional championships in 1972 and 1976.\n\nFoga says 26 boys have signed up for tryouts and 16 will be kept for a varsity-only season. As is the case at most small schools, pitching is at a premium.\n\n“Everybody that plays starts out pitching,” says Foga. “Of our potential roster, 10 to 12 guys will pitch for us throughout the year.”\n\nFoga, who is assisted by Anthony Jarvis, Ben Vanderbur and Joe Storm, says his team has benefitted from the new IHSAA limited contact rules (two days of baseball activity two days a week during certain periods).\n\n“Not having a true feeder system in place, it has allowed me to get in the gym and work on those fundamentals early,” says Foga. “We can keep moving and progressing forward.”\n\nThe start of spring break at South Decatur coincides with the first official day of practice (March 11).\n\n“Kids will practicing on spring break to be able to hit their (IHSAA) practice count before the season begins,” says Foga.\n\nTo create a feeder, a junior high baseball club is starting this spring. Games will be played against many of the schools in the Mid-Hoosier Conference.\n\nThere is a local youth league, but it does not play by high school rules. There is no leading off etc. That’s why the junior high program was started.\n\nFoga sees players on his squad with the potential to play college baseball, including senior center fielder Nolan Storm (Joe Storm’s son), senior right-handed pitcher/shortstop/third baseman Brogan Howard, junior catcher/outfielder/first baseman Charlie Frensemeier and right-hander/outfielder Riley Peele.\n\nA 2002 Jennings County High School graduate, Foga competed in football, wrestling and baseball for the Panthers.\n\nHis baseball coach was Bob Howe.\n\n“The huge thing I learned from him the idea of structure,” says Foga of Howe. “It allows you to focus on what needs to happen and fundamentals.\n\n“He’d tell us that everybody not he team had potential to play at the collegiate level. But potential doesn’t mean anything unless you are able to work for it. I’ve applied that to general life experiences.”\n\nFoga was 5-foot-5 and 125 pounds in high school.\n\nJennings County football coach Jerry Bland told him not to make that a deal-breaker.\n\n“Coach Bland really pushed me to look past my size and not let that hold me back,” says Foga. “I could take on any challenge.”\n\nHe remembers wrestling coach Howard Jones more for what he did off the mat than on it.\n\n“He approached sports in general and coaching almost as a father figure,” says Foga. “He really looked out for the best interests of every kid on the team.\n\n“He wanted you to really strive for what we want in life. He was a really good mentor for all aspects of life.\n\n“I really try to implement that here at South. I want to be a mentor to them, guide them through life’s issues and be a positive role model. A lot of kids we have don’t have that in place.”\n\nIn football, Foga has assisted former South Decatur head coach Garry Sauley and was at the junior high level when Tony Bell was varsity head coach.\n\n“For (Sauley), it was always trying to do the right thing and always taking the higher path no matter what the situation was,” says Foga. “(Bell) was passionate about football. He talked about having a passion for something and pushing it.”\n\nFoga, a 2011 graduate of Indiana University Purdue University-Indianapolis, is married to Tiffany with five boys — Roman (11), Drake (10), Ayden (9), Hudson (7) and Grayson (5). They are all involved in hockey or soccer. Baby No. 6 is due in July.\n\nEric Foga is head baseball coach at South Decatur Junior/Senior High School near Westport, Ind.\n\nHead coach Eric Foga with his South Decatur Junior/Senior High School baseball team."
