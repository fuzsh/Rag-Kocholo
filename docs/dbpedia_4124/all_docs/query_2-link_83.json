In 1853, it burned to the ground, and Harriet Putnam Packer, donated $65,000 towards rebuilding the school if it were named after her late husband, William S. Packer. The new building was noted for its chapel of Tiffany stained glass windows. Until 1972, it was primarily a girls school but boys could attend from kindergarten through fourth grades. Curriculum was comprehensive and included visual arts such as painting, sculpture and photography. Among students were painter and sculptor Albert Pike Lucas as a child.

In 1982, it received a charter and accreditation to offer a four-year Bachelor of Arts degree in fine arts, graphic design, illustration, interior design and photography. Among former students are David and Doug Brega, Kenneth Southworth Davies and Louis Guarnaccia.

For quality paint, pigment must be finely ground so the application is smooth. For centuries, artists had to mix their own paints, and learning professional paint-mixing methods with appropriate binder to pigment proportions was a part of art training. However, in the 19th century the sale of paint in tubes freed artists not only from this task but from the confines of studio painting so they could paint to outdoors, and do 'plein-aire' painting.

To describe a work as being Painterly means to suggest that the artist has responded to his or her subject matter in terms of color and light and dark rather than by well-defined realistic images. The term Painterly was first used by Heinrich Wolfflin, a German art scholar, in 1915 in his book \"Principles of Art History\".

Included were Jack Hamilton Bush, Oscar Cahen, Hortense Gordon, Alexandra Luke, Kazuo Nakamura, Ray Mead, Tom Hodgson, Jock MacDonald, Harold Town, Walter Yarwood and William Ronald. Harold Town suggested the name, and their first group show was held in February 1954 at the Roberts Gallery in Toronto with large crowds, no sales, and reviews ranging from positive to hostile. Subsequent exhibitions went through 1958. The group, having been held together by a common interest in promoting public acceptance of abstraction and a desire to stir a market for their work, voted to disband in 1960 because their goals had been met, and abstraction had become an accepted part of Canadian art.

Painters in Oil Colours, London See Royal Institute of Oil Painters Painting As a noun, it is a fine-art term descriptive of an original work with aesthetic qualities that have skilled application of paint to a surface or ground. Painting mediums include oil, tempera, pastel, fresco, watercolor, gouache, encaustic and polymer or acrylic. The descriptive term Painting, as opposed to commercial or applied art, is usually intended to refer to that which was created to be one-of-a-kind.Source: Ralph Mayer, \"A Dictionary of Art Terms and Techniques\" Painting Knife A very thin, flexible tempered-steel blade, usually elongated, it is similar in use to a Palette Knife, but more delicate and therefore more suited to precise placing of color on a ground.

Its supportive organization was the Palette & Chisel Club. In recent times, the Norris and McCormick Foundations, Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs, plus a dedicated staff, volunteers and member artists have fostered the Academy. Founding members were evening students at the Art Institute of Chicago, who wanted to paint from the model under daylight, which was rather difficult since the Art Institute did not offer Sunday programs. Charles J. Mulligan, of this group, was an assistant to sculptor Lorado Taft and persuaded Taft to rent part of his spacious seventh floor studio in the old Athenaeum Building on Van Buren Street. Within a short time, Palette & Chisel membership multiplied, and in 1921, they purchased a mansion that continues to house the organization. Member artists have included Walter Ufer, Victor Higgins, E. Martin Hennings, Richard Schmid, Irving Shapiro, Walter Parke and Ruth Van Sickle Ford, the first woman, and she was accepted in 1961.

It is used for mixing paint on the palette, for scraping, and especially for modernist artists, spreading paint on canvas, a technique that appeared in the mid-19th century after oil paints were standardized and made available in tubes.

The fair occupied 350 acres (0.55 sq mi) of land on the western edge of what is now Delaware Park, extending from Delaware Avenue to Elmwood Avenue and northward to Great Arrow Avenue. It is remembered today primarily for being the location of the assassination of United States President William McKinley at the Temple of Music on September 6, 1901. The exposition was illuminated at night. Thomas A. Edison, Inc. filmed it during the day and a pan of it at night.

Before the 15th century when artists began using canvas, most paintings were done on panels, especially wooden panels that were sized or covered with a solution that sealed the pores. Source: Kimberley Reynolds & Richard Seddon, \"Illustrated Dictionary of Art Terms\" Panorama A broad or widely inclusive view of subject matter, it usually refers to landscapes. In the 18th and 19th centuries, panoramas were a popular form of entertainment and education. Usually accompanied by music and a lecture, a long roll of canvas was unveiled slowly on cylinders to show a wide view. These presentations, often depicting dramatic battle scenes, were the forerunner of stereopticans and motion pictures. Artist names associated with this type of panorama are Franz Biberstein and August Lohr of Milwaukee, who emigrated from in the early 1880s from Germany to work for the American Panorama Company. This business, founded by Milwaukee resident William Wehner, was the first large-scale panorama producing company in the United States. However, it only lasted for two years, but successor companies kept the activity alive with the 1893 Chicago Exposition being a popular venue. By the end of the 19th century, fascination with panoramas was subsiding, made apparent by the low enthusiasm for \"The Battle of Manila Bay\" staged in San Francisco in 1900. From the mid-19th century, the term took on another meaning, which was any landscape painting that, regardless of actual size, conveys a very wide view. Noted artists in this category are Albert Bierstadt and Thomas Moran with their dramatic western vistas. Among contemporary panoramic artists are Ed Mell with his Grand Canyon scenes and Ulrike Heydenreich from Minneapolis who applies modernist techniques of unfolding images on paper rolls to a method rooted almost two centuries back to Europe.

Paper is made by interweaving plant or cellulose fibers in sheet form and, depending upon quality, is composed of pulped linen, cotton rags, wood chips or recycled paper. Wood pulp is the basis of lesser quality paper. The paper making process involves beating the fibers to a pulp and drying across a fine, wire-mesh screen. The best watercolor paper is handmade. (See Hand-made Paper). Paper making is thought to have originated in China about 100 A.D., allegedly by Ts'ai Lun, and was introduced in Europe in the 13th Century. Papyrus of ancient Egypt and parchment from Roman times through the Middle Ages were forerunners of modern-day paper. In the 15th century, when books and engravings were first being produced in Europe, paper mills came into being. Today some artists make their own paper, but commercial paper is more prevalent among artists. However different techniques require different selections for texture and quality. Pastel works best with rough paper, and pen and ink is best suited to a smooth surface. Sources: Ralph Mayer, \"A Dictionary of Art Terms and Techniques\"; Kimberley Reynolds & Richard Seddon, \"Illustrated Dictionary of Art Terms\" Paper Architecture This term describes a rebellious response by Russian architects in the mid 20th century to state sanctioned building design, constructed unimaginatively with a communist aesthetic. Suppressed creative architects reacted by making their own creative designs on paper only--never to be built. Many of these imaginative drawings, often with vivid depictions of constructivism, deconstructivism and postmodernism, got international attention as exhibition winners in the western-world. Two of the most prominent 'paper architects' were Alexander Brodsky and Ilya Utkin, who often did collaborative work together. The narrative of paper architecture often was human's alienation to the urban world and especially to the loss of the rich heritage of Moscow's historical, artistically designed buildings.

It involves predominantly white area and the artist manipulating, with the warmth of the hands, a sheet of tissue paper in an attempt to convey vitality. Intended to result in a metamorphosis, it is a creativity-oriented approach to reach a different consciousness, a journey into the transcendent, then a return to reality. The surface of \"papier froissé\" is regarded as organic, ready to receive signs, shapes and colors. The communicative action is natural and helps to provide an emotional harvest.” Source: Dr. Cinzia De Bari, biographer of Antonio Papasso. Papier Mache A light, strong but pliable material, it is composed of wastepaper torn into small pieces or strips and made pulp-like when soaked with glue of starch and water or flour paste. It is popular for functional and decorative objects because it is easily made and when dried, can be painted and varnished and made fairly durable. American artists who have used \"papier mache\" include Eugenie Gershoy, who found the material cheap and accessible during the Great Depression of the 1930s; Hope Atkinson, who made folk-art style \"papier-mache\" 'companions' to soothe her loneliness; and Raymond Scully who worked in the medium to create religious figures.

Paper, however, is of vegetable origin---the pulp of plants. Parchment, unlike leather, is not tanned, and artwork on parchment requires conservation that differs from 'works on paper' in that extreme temperature can cause irreparable buckling and cracking and flaking off of paint. Standard conservation-quality matting and framing is usually adequate for 'works on parchment'. The first record of parchment dates to the second century BC in Rome. Because of excellent surface and durability, it became popular in that early period for writings and records intended to be kept for long periods of time. During the Medieval period in Europe, parchment was used for religious and secular writings and was often decorated with gilded illuminations.

Pastel and Pastel Painting A term used both to describe the medium and the finished work, pastel mediums are colored sticks similar to chalk or crayon that consist of powdered pigment and enough non-greasy binder (methyicellulose) to hold it together. Pastels vary according to the amount of chalk they contain, and the deepest toned are the most pure. The artist may build up colors without touching them once they are applied or achieve blending with fingers or a tool called a Stump. A sense of blending can also be achieved by laying many color strokes beside each other so the eye does the blending. Most pastels have water-based gum or binder, but oil pastels have an oil binder and can be thinned with turpentine and used like paint. Oil pastels are less easily damaged than water-blended pastels. In order for the pastels to adhere to a ground, a textured surface is required such as sandpaper and canvas. Then a fixative, either a spray or glass, is used to cover the pastel painting so that it has permanence. However, the glass must have a separating mat, so that it does not touch the pastels, and fixative must be used very lightly; otherwise it can alter the color effects and relationships. When properly cared for, pastels \"can survive indefinitely\" (Mayer) and will never crack, darken or get yellow. Pastel works are generally called paintings because the colors are applied in mass and not by line drawing. However that is true of soft pastels, but some artists use harder, sharply pointed crayons and get a drawing effect. Pastel is the simplest and purest method of painting, since pure color is used without a fluid medium and the crayons are applied directly to the pastel paper. Pastel painting is rooted in prehistoric painting when visual art was made with dry lumps of colored material. As known today, it was first made popular in Paris in the 1720s by Rosalba Carriera, a Venetian painter. Edgar Degas of France was a prolific pastel painter in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and he in turn influenced Mary Cassatt, one of America's best-known pastel painters. Other noted American pastel painters are Henrietta Johnston, reportedly America's first pastel painter; Andrew Wyeth; Wolf Kahn; Ramon Kelley; Dee Toscano and Lyonel Feininger.

Penciller / Penciler A comic book or graphic novel line artist who works in pencil, he or she performs the first step in relaying stories which are most effectively conveyed in visual, image form rather than words. These artists are concerned with layout positions and vantages of scenes, and often work with varying degrees of hardness in pencils, or with mechanical pencils or drafting leads. Usually the penciller draws images on over-sized sheets of paper, 11 by 17 inches, and for the finished product work with inkers. For some inkers and pencillers the teamwork is so satisfying they work exclusively with each other. Artists known for pencilling include Jack Kirby, Neal Adams, Joe Kubert and Wally Wood.

She had learned to weave at Berea College in Kentucky, and the Penland School resulted from her efforts to teach the craft to local women in Penland, North Carolina. The school was officially founded in 1929 by Lucy and others with whom she shared the enjoyment of weaving. A resident art program expanded, as did the number of classes and students. Eventually there were 51 buildings on 400 acres of land, and in 2003, the Penland School was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

Pentimento / Pentimiti An Italian term meaning to repent, \"Pentimento\" is a condition descriptive of old paintings where lead-containing pigments have become more transparent over time, revealing earlier layers or images. Sometimes the initial drawing appears or perhaps an over-painted earlier painting. Corrective measures include removing preliminary lines or colors that are darker than the new paint and smoothing out the first layer of impasto before over-painting. Some artists such as Richard Diebenkorn deliberately left \"Pentimiti\" or traces of pigments from his previous work on that ground as an indicator of human frailty---attempts to create something at an earlier time. Diebenkorn called these leftovers 'crudities', in that they expressed errors or mistakes and were very much a part of the addition and correction processes involved in making art.

It is also linked to earlier movements such as Body Art, Happenings and Fluxus, and these expressions brought into the mix make for a less-than-definite explanation of the term.

In one-point linear perspective, developed during the fifteenth century, all parallel lines in a given visual field converge at a single vanishing point on the horizon. In aerial or atmospheric perspective, the relative distance of objects is indicated by gradations of tone and color and by variations in the clarity of outlines.

Perspective Box From the Dutch word \"perspektyflas\" or \"perspective cabinet,\" it was developed by 17th century Dutch artists to show young art students characteristics of perspective. Also known as a \"peep show\", it enables an artist to create a convincing illusion of interior space through complex construction involving painting and a well-positioned eyehole so that the eye is deceived into believing it has entered a room. Currently there are only six known examples of the 17th century \"perspektyflas\", two of which are by the Dutch artist, Samuel Van Hoogstraten. One of these is in the permanent collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts and one is in the National Gallery.

Philadelphia College of Art See University of the Arts, Philadelphia Philadelphia School of Design for Women / Moore Coll Founded in 1848 by Sarah Peter, a philanthropist, the Philadelphia School of Design for Women, later named Moore College of Art, challenged prevailing norms by training women to be artisans and craftswomen. It was the first school to teach women industrial art. Upon graduation, students were helped by faculty to find jobs with industries. Women of all ages enrolled, but by 1920, most were between the ages of 18 and 22 years. \"A key figure in developing the school as a major center for fine arts was Emily Sartain, who was Principal from 1886 to 1920.\" (Strass) From a family of distinguished Philadelphia artists, she asserted that training in commercial and fine art should receive equal attention, and under her direction curriculum included work from the living model, perspective, and design. She brought respected teachers including Robert Henri to the school. Harriet Sartain, niece of Emily, took over as Principal in 1920. She strongly opposed modernist movements in art and kept the school on message that the institution’s success lay in its ability to train women for industrial art vocations.In 1932, the name changed to the Moore College of Art with a $3 million dollar gift from Joseph Moore, Jr. Enrollment increased greatly, although after World War II into the 1950s, many of the women graduates directed their energies to home and family instead of industrial vocations. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the school weathered accreditation problems but continues into the 21st Century.

They wanted to do sketching, which later came to mean illustration, and also to have a place to socialize and exchange ideas freely. Founders were George and Edmund Bensell, Edward McIlhenny, Henry Bispham, John Gihon and Robert Wylie. They were quickly joined by other artists, and key personalities were Thomas Eakins and Thomas Anshutz. During the 1870s, when the Pennsylvania Academy's new building was incomplete, classes were held at the Sketch Club including life classes by Eakins. Over the years, members have shared studio space and learned from each other, and they have initiated programs including regular workshops and exhibitions to promote the appreciation of art. Many older members have reached out to emerging artists. The organization was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1889, and in 1991, it received legal status to solicit outside funding, having survived on donations from members. In 1903, the Philadelphia Sketch Club began its long-time occupancy of its buildings at 235 South Camac Street. This site has three federal period row houses, built in 1822, and joined together to form one building.

All had trained in Philadelphia. Their first exhibition of their thirty-year annual exhibitions was at the Art Club of Philadelphia and offered for sale 247 paintings. Although known as The Philadelphia Ten, membership fluctuated, and at its highest number had 23 painters and 7 sculptors. Participants were distinctive for quality of production, self sufficiency---liberated before the term acquired its feminist meaning--- and unconventional, independent life styles. Many never married, and few had children. Some historians have suggested that the women formed The Philadelphia Ten in response to The Eight in New York City. Among the members of The Ten were Theresa Bernstein, Mary Colton, Fern Coppedge, Edith Wood, Joan Hartley, Nancy Ferguson and Genevieve Hamlin.

Dana, George Walter Dawson, Herbert E. Everett, Thomas P. Anschutz and Susan Bradley founded the Philadelphia Water Color Club. It was a response to the fact that art exhibitions of the period gave slight attention to aqueous media, being dominated by sculpture and works in oil. Watercolor art was considered less valid and held in low esteem as \"Art\" by students and the public alike. PWCS founders were determined to dignify their art in the eyes of the world. Mounting strong exhibitions at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, members began to work toward their goal. In March, 1922, the growing organization was chartered to give watercolor as a valid and respected art form its deserved place in the Philadelphia area and beyond.

For many of the early exhibiting artists, the Mill was an alternative to the Pennsylvania Academy, which was becoming increasingly exclusive of younger, modernist painters. The founding committee of Phillips Mill was headed by artist William Francis Taylor. The site evolved into the Phillips Mill Community Association, and in the late 20th century led to the formation of the James A. Michener Museum with branches in New Hope and Doylestown.

Photo League In New York City it was formed in 1936 by documentary photographers with social messages considered \"left wing.' Fifteen years later, in 1951, it was closed down by McCarthy era censorship. Members, many of them children of immigrants, had \"unabashedly leftist roots\" and captured images that decry poverty, racism and violence as well as more nuanced observations of postwar American life. In 1955, the Photo League shut down amid accusations that it was a Communist front. Members included Sid Grossman, Berenice Abbot, Lisette Model and Sy Kattelson.

Photo Secession Organized by Alfred Stieglitz in New York City the movement was composed of carefully selected pictorial photographers who did original photography produced in the United States and abroad. Goals of the group were to promote photography as being equal in fine art stature with painting and sculpture, to make the public aware of the potential of photography, and to promote the dry-plate process of pictorialism, meaning to create work that looked like painting or etching of the time. Most of their photos were black and white or sepia toned, and were created with manipulations such as soft focus, special filters and lens coatings. Stieglitz himself was an expert photographer, and he championed the goals of Photo-Secession in his magazine \"Camera Work\" (1903-17) and at his Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession (1905-1917) at 291 Fifth Avenue. Members included Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Clarence White, Gertrude Kasebier, and Alvin Coborn.

Then exposing it to light, it usually has the result of a shadow image with variation in tone. The method was used by Man Ray with his 'rayographs.' Other photogram photographers are Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Christian Schad, Pablo Picasso, James Welling and Imogen Cunningham. Anna Atkins (1799-1871) was a pioneer of photograms, with many images of algae and seaweed.

The word 'gravure' refers to 'grainy' appearance created by dusted rosin, which is part of the very time-consuming process that today is used primarily by fine-art photographers.

Pictorial Photographers of America Founded in 1916 in New York City with the concept that photography was art, early members included Clarence White, Karl Struss and Edward Dickson. White remained a guiding influence. He taught photography at Columbia University from 1907 to 1925, and in 1914, opened the Clarence H. White School of Photography, which at that time was the only school in the U.S. devoted exclusively to photography. Many of the school's students were members of the PPA, which became national with the goal of divorcing the concept of photography as just commercial and mechanized ways of capturing images. Also, the PPA, with emphasis on objective education, distanced itself from the political convictions of Alfred Steglitz and his Photo-Secession group. The White School closed in 1942 with bankruptcy, and the PPA continued as a national organization with diminished exclusive emphasis on New York City.

Picture Plane A term applied to visual elements of a painting that are in the viewer’s most direct line of sight, usually the foreground, the word “plane” is used because the subject is often compared to a window separating viewers from the images. Shapes in a painting intended to appear in three-dimensional space are said to be behind the picture plane, and those in the foreground are in front of the picture plane. Working in relation to the picture plane, the artist achieves perspective by arranging objects behind the picture plane in smaller sizes to create a sense of distance and larger to suggest foreground. In much modernist or abstract art, traditional rules of working with the picture plane are violated, and often there are visual distortions such as looming, out-of-scale objects in the foreground. The concept, which relates to an imaginary surface of a painting, originated during the Renaissance and led to much exploration of techniques to achieve perspective.

Picturesque Meaning suitable for a picture, such as striking or interesting in an eye-pleasing, beautiful way, the term is linked to 19th-century English theoreticians and was articulated by Reverend William Gilpin (1724-1804), schoolmaster of Salisbury. He wrote the description as \"that particular quality, which makes objects chiefly pleasing in painting.\" It also included variety, rough textures, and small scale. Thomas Cole referenced the word picturesque when discussing his philosophies of landscape painting, which he applied to the Hudson River School, 1820-1880. Further description includes rich in meandering line and charming, evocative detail, soothing and day-dreamy – a country cottage or ruins of a Gothic shrine overrun with flowering vines. Thomas Doughty (1793-1852) predating Cole, applied principles of Picturesque to his paintings.

Pierhead Painter A painter who sought commissions to paint portraits of ships, he or she received the name because of setting up their easel on the head of the pier. The commissions were often of short duration and subject to the ship’s departure from port, with the artist’s client aboard. Although pierhead artists did not often have the luxury of time and academy training, they generally produced accurate depictions born of the benefit of specialization, true love of the subject matter, and perfume of the salt air and sea spray. (Compliments of Vallejo Gallery, California) Pigment The coloring component of paint, it is derived from either natural or synthetic sources, and when mixed with binders it becomes paint, ink or crayon, etc. Pigments, as opposed to dyes, are insoluble and impart their color by staying on the surface. Pigments can be derived from a multitude of sources including vegetables, wood, flowers, animals such as beetles and cuttlefish and unnatural sources created in chemical laboratories. Whatever its components, pigment serves one purpose, which is to provide color for all painting mediums. To be usable for artists, a pigment must be finely ground enough to pass through a screen of 325 meshes to the inch, and must meet standards of brilliance, clearness, color strength and inertia so when mixed with other colors, no harmful effects occur.

It first came into general use in mid 19th century France when landscape painters at Barbizon, a village near Paris, used the method for landscape depictions. Shortly after, it was adopted by the French Impressionists led by Camille Pisarro and Claude Monet. The method was facilitated by newly developed oil paint sold in tubes, which meant it did not dry out quickly and could be easily transported. Plein-aire painting was a major break in tradition from the prevalent method of working only in studios. In the United States and Canada, it was practiced by the first-generation of American impressionists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. William Merritt Chase opened the first organized school of landscape painting at Shinnecock on Long Island. The method also took hold in a major way in Southern California from the time of the state's first Impressionist landscape painters including Guy Rose.

Many ancient sculptures from Egypt, Greece and Rome were polychromed as were sculpture in the Medieval and Renaissance periods. In the early 20th Century, sculptors working in Cubist styles such as Alexander Calder, Alexander Archipenko and David Smith used colors or polychorme in their sculpture. In the late 1950s, a new movement developed in polychrome sculpture and continued through the 1960s. Influences were new interest in color stirred by Op Art and materials such as neon lighting and certain plastics that had inherent color. Examples of polychrome are assemblage metal works of John Chamberlain, colored neon of Vardea Chryssa, colorful still-life sculpture arrangements of Robert Hudson, and polychrome clay sculptures of Peter Voulkos, John Mason and Kenneth Price.

Pop Art A term derived from the word 'Popular,’ it is linked to an art movement whereby artists depicted commonplace or familiar, everyday images in contemporary culture. The movement emanated from a mid 1950s meeting in London of artists and architects at the Institute of Contemporary Arts to discuss topics of mass media, fashions, industrial design and science fiction relative to art and architecture. Subsequently the group held English Pop-Art exhibitions, and this English Pop Art movement influenced Englishman David Hockney, who, in turn, became active in the USA, especially in California. Meanwhile in New York in the mid 1950s, Jasper Johns, Tom Wesselmann and Robert Rauschenberg were vanguard artists depicting everyday objects in their work, often as social commentary. Objects used in Pop Art often related to mass production such as Andy Warhol's Coca Cola bottles or Campbell's Soup Cans, and also to his iconic personalities such as the silkscreen reproductions, often hand colored, of Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Chairman Mao, Albert Einstein and Jackie Kennedy. Henry Geldzahler, former curator of contemporary art at the Metropolitan Museum, \"helped put Pop on the map in 1962\" (199) during the Museum of Modern Art's symposium on Pop Art by being the only panel member to support it. He was a close friend of Andy Warhol, who later said: \"Henry gave me all of my ideas.\" (200) Pop Art, initially a rebellion against Abstract Expressionism, began to lose ground in the late 1960s, and was replaced by Minimalism, Contemporary Realism, and Hard-Edge painting.

Porcelain The finest of ceramic ware fired to the highest temperature ranges, the term has come to reference all wares that are translucent as distinguished from Earthenware and Stoneware. Porcelain is usually made from clay, feldspar and flint and is often used for dinnerware, vases, and smaller sculpture. True porcelain ranges in color from white to grey and when struck, produces a clear tone. The original formula was developed in China during the T’ang Dynasty of the seventh century A.D. In the early 18th century, it was first produced in Europe. Source: Ralph Mayer, “A Dictionary of Art Terms and Techniques”. Portrait A painting, sculpture, drawing or photograph that is a likeness of a human being or animal, living or dead. Portraits can be full length, heads, torsos or portrait busts, life size or disproportionate, abstract or realistic, and executed in many mediums. Many artists do self portraits. In the 17th and 18th centuries miniature portraits were popular and small enough to be carried or worn as a locket. Among American portraitists of important American historical figures are Gilbert Stuart and Charles Willson Peale who did famous likenesses of George Washington. Mary Cassatt remains known for child portraits, mostly of family members, and Nicolai Fechin for impressionist portraits of well known people such as Willa Cather that captured the complexities of the inner person. Some artists such as Robert Henri depicted ordinary people, and Alice Neel painted her own children, sad and pensive. Animal portraitists include Ann Collins and Michael Finnell who are noted for their portraits of famous race horses. In contrast Deborah Butterfield is famous for her assemblage sculptures of ordinary horses, often old broken down and un-glamourous. Cassius Coolidge and William Wegmam pose their own dogs for humorous depictions that combine portraiture with anthropomorphic genre.

Post A term meaning \"after\" that is prefixed to some art terms such as Post-Impressionism, Post-Minimalism and Post-Modern. However, these terms are handy primarily to suggest a time line and not to suggest a unity of style amongst the artists to whom the terms are applied. Even if the artists do share a rebellion against a preceding movement, they often have approaches independent of each other. Included among Post-Impressionists, each with a unique style, are Paul Cezanne, Georges Seurat, Vincent Van Gogh and Paul Gaughin. However, they did share determination to inject identifiable objects and or figures into their work rather than be confined to the strictures of Impressionism. Usage of the word \"post\" linked to fine art began in the early 20th century and like the term \"neo\" can be deceptive in that it suggests \"a linear but not necessarily accurate vision of history . . . (It can) \"obscure, rather than enhance, the understanding of art.\" Source: Robert Atkins, \"ARTSPEAK\" Post Impressionism A term applied to the work of modernist artists, it refers to many of the French artists in France from about 1885 to 1900. Included among the Post-Impressionists are Paul Cezanne, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat and Vincent Van Gogh. Although they all painted in highly personal styles and did not exhibit together under the 'umbrella' of Post Impressionism, they were united in rejecting the relative absence of form and emotion characteristic of Impressionism. The focus was on finding new ways to express form and space, and generally the public was not receptive. Sources: Robert Atkins, ARTSPEAK; Ralph Mayer, \"A Dictionary of Art Terms and Techniques\" Post Modern A term that is vague in meaning, it has evolved as general reference to artwork that is anti-modernist in that it is a rebellion against artistic expression such as Abstraction, Conceptual and Performance Art. Use of the description, “Post Modernist\", is attributed to writer Joseph Hudnot in a 1949 book, \"Architecture and the Spirit of Man\". In the 1960s, Post Modernism came into wide use, and since then includes the revival of realist artwork with recognizable subjects such as landscapes, social genre and history painting; in other words, that which has been scorned by abstractionists. Although Post Modernism has new elements reflective of the hybrid aspects of modern society, such as sculpture that is also furniture, it seems impossible to list unifying characteristics of style or subject matter other than that it embodies some aspects of Realism. Source: Robert Atkins, “Art Speak” Post Painterly Abstraction A term coined by Swiss art historian, Heinrich Wolfflin, it was used by art critic Clement Greenberg to describe a period in American art that succeeded Abstract Expressionism. The term came to be associated with any work that Clement Greenberg appeared to promote. It was the title of an exhibition he organized in 1964. It opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of art in June, traveled to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, and ended December 20, 1964 at The Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto. Among the artists were Walter Bannard, Ralph DuCasse, Paul Feeley and Al Held. Source: http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/ppacover.html Post-Minimalism Meaning after Minimalism, the term refers to a movement beginning in the late 1960s that was a general reaction of artists against Minimalism and its closed geometric forms and had somewhat more content, or open forms, than content-free Minimalism. \"Artforum\" writer, Robert Pincus-Witten coined the term in an article he wrote about Eva Hesse, which was published in the November, 1971 issue. Other artists categorized as Post-Minimalist are Richard Serra, Martin Puryear, Joel Shapiro and Tony Cragg.

Potlatch Collection / Mountie Art An art collection from the Potlatch Paper Corporation that donated in 1981 349 original illustrations and transferred all rights, without consideration, to the Tweed Museum of Art, University of Minnesota Duluth. Commissioned between 1930-1971, these paintings on canvas, paper, and illustration board used the Royal Canadian Mounted Police image--a powerful symbol of honesty and resourcefulness--to advertise the company's printing papers. Among the 16 artists who created \"mountie\" paintings are Hal Foster, known as the illustrator of many classic American comic strips, and Arnold Friberg, whose set designs for Cecil B. De Mille's movie, \"The Ten Commandments\", won him an Academy Award.

Powder coating is a dry finishing process, using finely ground particles of pigment and resin, which are electrostatically charged and sprayed onto a surface. The pieces receiving the powder coating are electrically grounded so that the charged powder particles projected at them adhere to the pieces and are held there until melted and fused into a smooth coating in the curing oven. The result is a uniform, durable, high-quality finish that is also environmentally friendly.

The purpose was \"to further the interest of both artists and laymen in printmaking and collecting, and the entire financial philosophy of the Prairie Print Makers in its early days was in keeping with the constraints of the Depression era. Artists were charged one-dollar per year, and collectors were required to pay five dollars per year. Each year one of the artists was chosen to do a print, which would be The Annual Gift Print given exclusively to the members and limited to an edition of two hundred. Norma Bassett Hall designed the logo. Yearly the Prairie Print Makers sponsored traveling exhibitions throughout the United States to schools, libraries and civic organizations. By the mid 1930s, Prairie Print Makers was a well-established entity and had members in many states as well as Hawaii and Washington DC. Methods included lithography, etching, woodblocks, drypoints and aquatints. Prairie Print Makers came to an end in 1966, its member goals achieved of stimulating interest in printmaking and selling work by the artists. \"The society had also provided an important bond of interest and purpose that made the lives of the ten original Kansas-based founders less isolated and removed from the art centers of the rest of America. . . .and perhaps most importantly, a sense of identity as artists, even though for all of them financial reality meant supporting their families through jobs as commercial artists or teachers.\" (9-10) Source: Barbara Thompson O'Neill and George C.

The name \"Pre-Raphael\" means artwork which was done previous to the influence of the Italian painter, Raphael, who lived from 1483 to 1520, and who defied traditional realistic painting and injected grandeur or imagination into his portraits and religious depictions. In England, the leader and founder of the Pre-Raphaelite movement was John Ruskin, whose book \"Modern Painters\" was a guiding source. The underlying idea was to study nature closely and then create art that emulated nature---exactly. Resulting were many realistic still lifes, landscapes and figure paintings, done with avoidance of exuberant, historical, narrative genre, which had so dominated European art. However, many viewers found the Pre-Raphaelite work tedious because of the obsession with staying close to nature and avoidance of injecting imagination. American artists who subscribed to the movement included William Trost Richards, Thomas Charles Farrer, John William Hill, John Henry Hill, Charles Herbert Moore, Henry Roderick Newman and Robert J. Pattison. Many of their paintings were in watercolor.

Primitivism A term descriptive of a style of artwork, it has several origins: 1) pre-historic art 2) art whose subjects are borrowed from non-western cultures such as Paul Gaughin's depictions of Tahitian people and Pablo Picasso's use of African motifs. 3) art by self-taught or unsophisticated artists and 4) a Russian form of Expressionism, which developed between 1905 and 1920 under the influence of Cubism, Fauvism and Russian folk art. Characteristic of the style were simple, block-like shapes that conveyed strength and power. These primitivist painters usually focused on laboring people. The general concept of Primitivism is tied to the sentimental image of the \"noble savage\", uncorrupted, naturally good, and uninhibited by western civilization's sexual mores. Jean-Jacques-Rousseau, 18th-century French philosopher, popularized this idea in his widely-circulated writings, as did imperialistic travel by westerners in Asia, Africa, India and the South Pacific. Many 19th-century fairs and expositions featured creative work by \"Primitives\". In art expression, much of the fascination with Primitivism related to the fact that it was such a contrast to the formal, prescribed academic art of western culture dating back to the Renaissance. Primitivism also allowed western artists to focus on their own emotional and spiritual interpretations that were not prescribed by tradition. However, some interpretation by western artists of Primitivism was misinterpreted such as fierce-looking African masks presented as reflecting the aggressions of its wearer, whereas in fact, they were made to scare away evil spirits who would thwart success in battle.

Print An image created from a master wood block, stone, plate, or screen, usually on paper. Prints are referred to as multiples, because as a rule many identical or similar impressions are made from the same printing surface, the number of impressions being called an edition. When an edition is limited to a specified number of prints, it is a limited edition. A print is considered an original work of art and today is customarily signed and numbered by the artist.

The purse increased in 1926 until Blumenthal's death in 1930 to ten thousand francs for two years. Beginning in 1919 the foundation awarded nearly two hundred grants, and on April 11, 1937, the Prix Blumenthal was declared d'utilité publique (\"of public service\"), giving it a special tax classification.[2] Awards were given through 1954.Source: Wikipedia, 2024 Prix de Rome / Rome Prize The reference is to two recognitions named the Prix De Rome. The first one abolished in 1968 was an award given by the French Academy in Paris to art students showing great promise who had completed required work at the École des Beaux-Arts or elsewhere. The prize entitled recipients to four years’ study at the Académie de France à Rome, founded in 1666 by Jean Baptiste Colbert. The competition was open to all French painters, sculptors, architects, engravers, and musicians between the ages of 15 and 30. It was instituted by Louis XIV in 1666 for the purpose of enabling talented artists to complete their education by study of classical art in Rome. For 300 years, the Prix de Rome was the highest honour in the western world that an artist could earn. The second Prix de Rome is a prize given to American artists based on the tradition of the French prize. It is for study at the American Academy in Rome.

Its founders and only members were Norval Morrisseau, Daphne Odjig, Jackson Beardy, Alex Janvier, Eddy Cobiness, Carl Ray and Joe Sanchez. The original idea was to formalize a group of native artists that would spread the word about native art and assist and inspire up and coming younger native artists. According to Janvier, ‘An important part of the group’s aim was to release young aboriginal artists from the necessity of producing romanticized Indian art. They were challenging Canadian art and destroying people’s conception of native art.’ The first exhibition titled “Treaty Numbers 23, 287, 1171” was at the Winnipeg Art Gallery in 1973. It included only Jackson Beardy, Alex Janvier, and Daphne Odjig. Indian Affairs helped organize three more shows at galleries in Ottawa, Vancouver and Montreal. The last was at the Dominion Galley (Montreal) in 1975. The PNIAI never had more than the original seven members, though Bill Reid did join in some shows, and it eventually ceased to exist as an organization as the individual members concentrated on developing their own careers.

Proportion* Size relationships between parts of a whole, or between two or more objects perceived as a unit. Provenance An artwork’s complete lineage of ownership and/or exhibitions, it is often an important factor in authentication in that it can establish ownership back to the time an artist lived---meaning it could be by the hand of the alleged artist. Such information is often difficult to establish, especially when a painting has been owned by a family for several generations and no record of sale is found. Another obscuring factor is that many private collectors prefer to buy and sell works anonymously through dealers or auction houses, who, in turn oblige collectors by not disclosing the true owner. Also, many dealers and auction houses that were active in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries are no longer in business, and their records may have been lost or destroyed. Thus it is rare to find works of art having a complete provenance or history of ownership unless it is contemporary art. As a result of these complicating matters, it is important to bear in mind that gaps in provenance do not necessarily indicate that a work was looted, stolen, or suggest lack of authenticity.

Bror Nordfeldt developed the technique based upon Japanese ukiyo-e wood block prints. Blanche Lazzell is credited with mastering the technique which left small spaces between the element of the block creating the white line. Because soft colors were often used the finished print looked like a watercolor. Other members of the Colony were Ethel Mars, Mabel Hewit, William Zorach and Edna Hopkins.
