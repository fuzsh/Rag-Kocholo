Department of the Interior, Bureau of Education., Washington, D. C. Sir: Many students apply for admission to higher institutions in other States and sections than those in which they have received their high-school preparation. Many also seek certificates from exam¬ ining and licensing boards, which have no direct means of knowing the standards of the schools from which the applicants come. The demand for this information led the Bureau of Education in 1913 to undertake the collection and preparation of lists of high schools and academies accredited by State universities, approved by State departments of education, or recognized by examining and certifi¬ cating boards and by certain other agencies. The demand proved to be even greater than had been anticipated. The first edition of the bulletin containing the lists was soon exhausted. In order to meet further demands for this information and also to bring the fists up to date, second and third editions of the pamphlet w§re issued, in 1914 and 1916, respectively. The last edition has long been exhausted. I have therefore requested Dr. George F. Zook, special¬ ist in higher education in the bureau, to revise the pamphlet again. The revision is contained in the accompanying manuscript, which I recommend for publication as a bulletin of the Bureau of Education. Respectfully submitted. Jno. J. Tigert, Commissioner. , The Secretary of the Interior. 5 ' ' ' # ' . v , ACCREDITED SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. The lists of accredited secondary schools which are presented now for the fourth time in this bulletin are designed to meet the needs of officers charged with the admis¬ sion of new students to secondary schools, colleges, universities, professional schools (especially schools of law and medicine), normal schools, etc.; of State examining and certifying boards, which are concerned with the status of secondary schools located at a distance; and of parents who may want to know about the high schools of any particular State or section. The first issue of the bulletin was published in 1913 . The introduction to the second bulletin, published in 1915, called attention to the fact that the great annual increase in the number of secondary schools (in 1911-12 there were 13,268; in 1915-16 the num¬ ber had grown to 14,206; in 1917-18 it reached 16,009), together with the sudden changes in standing, generally for the better of many secondary schools in all parts of the country, make frequent revisions of the lists desirable. It was therefore the purpose of the Bureau of Education to revise the bulletin every two years, but on account of the many other pressing matters engaging the attention of the persons responsible for the preparation of the bulletin during and immediately following the war, it was not possible to carry out this purpose, and the present revision is the first which has been made since 1916. The lists here presented show many changes in the way of schools added to or drop¬ ped from previous lists. The accrediting agencies represented, however, remain the same, except that, because of the almost universal practice of the State accrediting bodies in extending their inspection and accrediting of secondary schools to cover private as well as public high schools, Part III of the preceding bulletin, containing the accredited lists of certain private institutions, has been omitted. The arrange¬ ment of the bulletin is substantially unchanged. The essential parts of the intro¬ ductions to the previous issues are reprinted here. ACCREDITED SECONDARY SCHOOL DEFINED. An “accredited secondary school, ” as the term is used in this bulletin, is a school which is equipped to prepare students for colleges requiring 15 units for unconditioned admission and which has been investigated or approved for this purpose by one of the following agencies: A State officer of education, a university or college inspector or committee on admissions, an officer or committee of an accrediting association. Except in the case of certain of the Southern States, whose high-school courses are based upon seven years of elementary training, it is understood that these 15 units represent secondary work above the standard eight-grade elementary-school course- It is assumed that the curriculum of an accredited school represents four years of 36 or more weeks each; that at least three teachers give their whole time to high-school work,1 and that the school keeps up an adequate library and laboratory equipment. 1 Exceptions are certain schools in the lists of Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Tennessee, which do not conform in every particular to the definition, but are approved by the State officials. 7 8 ACCREDITED SECONDARY SCHOOLS. UNIT DEFINED. The following authoritative definition of the word ‘‘unit” has been made by the national conference committee on standards of colleger and secondary schools, which is composed of representatives of the National Association of State Universities, the New England College Entrance Certificate Board, the College Entrance Examination Board, the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the Middle States and Maryland, the Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools of the Southern States, the New England Association of Colleges and -Secondary Schools, the Association of American Colleges, the Association of Urban Universities, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, and the United States Commissioner of Education: A unit represents a year’s study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year’s work. This statement is designed to afford a standard of measurement for the work done in secondary schools. It takes — (11 The four-year high -school course as a basis and assumes that — (2) The length of the school year is from 36 to 40 weeks; that — ^3) A period is from 40 to 60 minutes in length.; and that — (4) The study is pursued four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year’s work in any subject can not be accomplished in less than 120 sixty -minute hours, or their equivalent. Schools organized on any other than a four-year basi3 can nevertheless estimate their work in terms of this unit. A four-year secondary-school curriculum should be regarded as representing not more than 16 units of work. VARIATIONS IN REQUIREMENTS OF ACCREDITING AGENCIES. The number of subjects recognized by the various accrediting bodies as forming an acceptable part of the college preparatory course vanes greatly; for example, the subjects recognized by the College Entrance Examination Board as permissible in a standard high-school course are:2 Units. English . . 3 Mathematics . 3-4£ Latin . 2-4 Greek . 2-3 French . 2-4 Units. German . 2-4 Spanish . 2-4 History . 1-4 Science . 1-4 Drawing . 1-2 On the other hand, there are State universities and pAvately endowed institutions, like Leland Stanford University, which permit great enlargement of the range of electives. The University of California, for example, accepts the following: Units. English . 2-4 History . 1-4 Laboratory science . 1-5 Mathematics . £-4£ Greek . J-4 Latin . 1-4 French . 1-5 German . 1-5 Spanish . 1-5 Physiology and hygiene . 1 Units. Physical geography . 1 E lementary physical science . 1 Drawing . .' . 1-2 Mechanic arts . £-3 Agriculture . £-3 Home economics . £-3 Music . 1-1 Bookkeeping . 1 Stenography and typewriting . 1-2 2 It should be noted, however, that the maximum amount of credit which a high-school student can secure in any single subject in a year is ordinarily one unit. Four units of credit in any given subject would there¬ fore constitute the normal maximum for a high-school course. ACCREDITED SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 9 It will therefore be apparent that the only close correspondence among the require¬ ments of the various institutions mentioned in this pamphlet is the quantitative one. All specify 15 units, except the Universities of Delaware and Maine, which admit with 14 and 144, respectively. None requires more than 16 units for admission. The requirements of each accrediting agency are briefly stated at the head of the list oi schools which each accredits. At the head of each list of schools accredited by a State university are summarized the requirementsYor admission to the A. B. course. The schools on the accredited list generally have the privilege of certificating students to other courses as well. To outline the admission requirements for all these courses would consume much space and might iead to confusion. The requirements for admission to the A. B. course may in each case be considered fairly typical of the in¬ stitution’s policy with respect to entrance requirements. METHODS OF ACCREDITING. Two methods are in common use for carrying on the system of accrediting in those States where the State authority embraces agencies for higher education. Under the first, the inspection of the work of the high schools is done through an officer or com¬ mittee of the State university, and the b'st of acceptable or accredited high schools is published in the catalogue of the university and thus made available for other institu¬ tions within the same State or for institutions in neighboring States. Under the second, the inspection and rating are done by the State superintendent of public instruction, the State board of education, or the State education office, acting through specially appointed officers. Examples of the former method are furnished by the Universi¬ ties of California, Nebraska, and Wisconsin; of the latter method, by the States of New York, Ohio, and Minnesota. The requirement of the completion of a standard four-year high-school course representing 15 units for admission to college, or as a part of the prescription for admis¬ sion to professional schools or to the practice of professions, has produced a group of organizations among whose activities are the coordination of standards of secondary education in neighboring States and the compilation of lists of accredited secondary schools. Such sectional organizations are now at work in the North Central States, New England, and the Southern States. These organizations are purely voluntary and have no legal control over the institutions which they rate. The influence which they wield, however, because of the fact that they focus representative educational opinion in their respective sections, is considerable. Occasionally also private insti¬ tutions, like the University of Chicago, have carried on their awn investigation and accrediting. CONTENTS OF THE BULLETIN. PART i: STATE LISTS. The bulletin is divided into two parts. The first part, as is appropriate, contains lists of schools accredited by State universities and State officers of education. Some¬ times both the State university and the State department of education publish lists of accredited schools. In such cases the list of the State university is printed first, and all schools accredited by the State education department not included in the university list are then added by way of supplement.3 When the State department of education or the State university publishes lists of accredited or approved high schools of different grades, only schools of the first grade are included in the bulletin, 3 In six States, Florida, Louisiana, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, and West Virginia, the State educa¬ tion departments accredit or approve only public schools, but private schools having the requisite standards and equipment are accredited by the State universities. 10 ACCREDITED SECONDARY SCHOOLS. except in the case of California, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky Nebraska, North Dakota, and Tennessee.4 PART n: LISTS OF ACCREDITING ASSOCIATIONS. Part II contains the lists of the three principal associations which undertake to accredit schools. The methods or standards of these associations are not identical. The list accredited by each is preceded by a statement of the basis upon which it is compiled. The schools are listed alphabetically, according to the towns in which they are located. The names of accredited private secondary schools and academies are printed in italics. Part I.— STATE LISTS.1 ALABAMA.

Their continued accrediting, however, is rendered somewhat uncertain by undeveloped organization, inadequate resources, or other causes. The schools in Group 2 of the Georgia list, though weak in laboratory, library, and sometimes teaching staff, are fully accredited by the University of Georgia, and are therefore included in the bulletin. Classes B, C, and D schools accredited by the Kansas State Department of Education and the University of Kansas are four-year schools “which on account of financial and other considerations do not provide courses of study covering all departments of secondary work, or in which there is not the same degree of permanency and efficiency in general administration. ” Schools accredited by the University of Kentucky in Class B are required to have only two teachers. The session is six weeks longer, however, than that of the Class A schools. Schools in Group B of the Nebraska list are accredited by the University of Nebraska, though they do not fully meet the standards of Group A schools as to preparation of teachers, or in library or laboratory facilities. Graduates of the schools in the second and third classes are admitted to the University of North Dakota on certificate. The State Department of Education of Tennessee grades the high schools of the State as A-l, A, B, and C. Graduates of all these schools except grade C are admitted unconditionally to the University of Tennessee, and are therefore included in the bulletin.
