        "text": "<strong>Oldenburg</strong> <strong>Academy</strong> of the Immaculate Conception opportunities await... every student, every day! Close Up DECEMBER <strong>2011</strong> Slow Down… Its Advent! The four weeks leading up to Christmas, for many, is perhaps the busiest, most hectic time of the year. It is so easy for me, in my harried pace of life, to get lost in the “Christmas rush.” I can find myself getting stressed about my incomplete shopping list and unanswered questions of what to give those special someones. The other day, I decided to set aside a few moments for some quiet reflection and picked up Joyce Rupp’s book, “Out of the Ordinary.” It caused me to pause and ponder about the greatest gift of all - the gift of PRESENCE. Jesus came into this world and engaged in the full humanity of life. He lived His life in being with others. The power of being with another person and bringing a ray of God’s love is the greatest gift of all. I invite all of us to Gift each other with the Gift of Presence. I share with you an adaptation of some of Joyce’s suggestions for being with others during this Advent and Christmas Season. - Be with someone who needs you. - Be with a person who gives you hope. - Be with an older person who hungers for a visitor. - Be with a person who is struggling with an illness. - Be with an infant who radiates new life. - Be with someone in prison. - Be with a neglected neighbor or community member. - Be with family and loved ones. May our God of Love be with each of you, your families and loved ones as you prepare to welcome Jesus’ Presence into your lives.
