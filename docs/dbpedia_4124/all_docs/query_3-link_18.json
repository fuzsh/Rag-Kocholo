        "text": "OA currently offers 11 AP courses spanning various subject areas.\n\n(Oldenburg, Ind.) - Oldenburg Academy was named to the 2023 AP® School Honor Roll, earning a Silver distinction for their commitment to offering opportunities to earn college credit by taking rigorous AP courses. In addition, Oldenburg Academy was awarded the AP Access Award for demonstrating a “clear and effective commitment to equitable access to advanced coursework.” In Indiana, only 71 schools earned a place on the 2023 AP School Honor Roll and just 18 were recognized with an Access Award distinction.\n\nOldenburg Academy currently offers 11 AP courses spanning various subject areas, including Arts, English, History, Math, Science, and World Languages. In the previous academic year, Oldenburg Academy administered a total of 123 AP exams to its students, with an impressive 60 percent securing a score of three or higher.\n\nTrevor Packer, Senior Vice President of Advanced Placement and Instruction at the College Board, highlighted the significance of AP as an opportunity for students to earn valuable college credits and to stand out during college admissions. He commended the schools that earned a place on the AP Honor Roll. “These schools” Packer said, “have shown that they can expand access to these college-level courses and still drive high performance—they represent the best of our AP program.”\n\nMrs. Laura Geis, the AP coordinator and guidance counselor at OA, is proud of the students’ and faculty’s notable accomplishments. \"The honor roll designation directly reflects the hard work and academic achievements of our 2023 graduating class, which had 76 percent of its seniors enroll in at least one AP exam during their high school careers,\" said Geis. \"Of those seniors, 94% of them achieved a score of three or higher in at least one AP exam.\"\n\nPrincipal Angie Parmer underscored the value of AP courses, which, she said, “generate a deep engagement with course material and pave the way for academic success in college.” \"Our teachers invest their time, energy, and expertise to nurturing our students' academic growth,” Parmer added, “and their dedication made this achievement possible.”\n\nOldenburg Academy is proud to be recognized by the AP School Honor Roll as an academic institution that both cultivates a college-bound culture and embraces educational inclusivity."
