If anyone has any feedback please feel free to send me a message! Team: FC Pride 08 Boys RL Objective: enhance our ability to pass or dribble forward and advance the ball in wide areas of the defending half Training Session Video Link: https://lnkd.in/g_XmRV8g 1. Warmup: Building up Passing Pattern 2. Activity 1: 8v6 playing into wide areas 3. Activity 2: 8v6 building up from keeper 4. Activity 3: 7v7 game (not included in video) From my own reflection, there are a couple organizational changes I would make such as using a bigger space during activity 1 to make it easier for the focus team and to create more space for the players in the middle."
