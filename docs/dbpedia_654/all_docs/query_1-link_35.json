        "text": "One could say that the martial arts called out to Paul Manogue, as he experienced everything from fencing, kendo, aikido, judo, and kenjutsu. He first found aikido when he was going to university in Japan and began training under Gozo Shioda. When he returned home, Manogue began studying under Yukio Utada in Philadelphia. Soon, he found himself back in Japan, this time studying under Hirokazu Kobayashi. Upon returning home, Manogue had a chance to train under the late Henry Smith of Aikikai of Philadelphia. Throughout his time in aikido, he began learning Edo Yagyu Shinkage-ryu and ultimately becoming the current headmaster for that branch. Today, Manogue took some time to talk about his time in aikido, opening his own school, and becoming a headmaster of a koryu. All images provided by Paul Manogue.\n\nMartial Arts of Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow: Hello and welcome Manogue Sensei! Thank you for joining us!\n\nPaul Manogue: I am happy to be here!\n\nMAYTT: You began training in aikido while staying in Japan, learning under Gozo Shioda at his Yoshinkan Dojo. How did you come to find aikido during your stay and what continues to motivate you to train today?\n\nPM: I was training kendo at a police dojo in Nerima City, where I lived, and wanted to add something else to my training. When I asked a friend if she knew of any dojo near the university’s campus, she showed me the Yoshinkan Hombu a few blocks away. I had trained in karate and judo and was amazed by the aikido at the Yoshinkan, the precision and effortless efficiency. I still train today to try to reach that level.\n\nMAYTT: What was the training like while you were studying under Shioda? What would you consider to be the highlight of your experience there?\n\nPM: Training was very hard; I would go in some days for early practice before university because I had part-time jobs in the evening. So, quite often I got to train with the Senshusei, the rapid course participants. The highlight of my time there was being thrown by Shioda Sensei. He knew I did kendo because one of the policemen I trained with also trained aikido and had introduced me and one day he gave me a bokken and said, “Cut me.” I went for him and landed halfway across the mat. It didn’t even hurt, he was able to do it without even hurting me, I never felt the technique.\n\nMAYTT: Upon returning to America, you took up training with Yukio Utada in Philadelphia. How did that experience compare to your time under Shioda?\n\nPM: Utada Sensei ran the aikido classes at Temple University in Philadelphia and had a dojo at that time on Girard Avenue. I started in the class at university, but as soon as I showed up in a uniform, he knew I had trained, and I explained I had been training for about a year in Tokyo. He put me with a wrestler so we wouldn’t hurt any of the inexperienced people and after a few weeks, I joined his other dojo as well. The training was very similar to the Hombu, Utada Sensei is amazing and kind, and at the same time very powerful. Like many dojo of that era, it was in a terrible part of the city and just getting there was rough and tumble, so all the members treated it as a martial art and a way to fight.\n\nMAYTT: I see. Then in 1991, you returned to Japan and began training under Koichi Yoshida, Jiro Kimura, and Hirokazu Kobayashi. What prompted your decision to travel back to Japan and choose to train under Kobayashi?\n\nPM: I wanted to get back to Japan and immerse myself in the culture and training again. I got a job in the JET program and was stationed in Osaka City. Between my apartment and the subway, I heard the telltale sound of bodies hitting the floor. When I opened the door to peek in it was a small, fourteen tatami dojo and they immediately invited me in. I hadn’t found a Yoshinkan dojo in the Kansai region, and this was minutes from my apartment so training in the Buikukai under Kobayashi Shihan was another happy accident, just like training in the Yoshinkan Hombu.\n\nMAYTT: You have had the opportunity to train in both Yoshinkan and Aikikai Aikido. What are some of the similarities and differences you have seen between the two styles?\n\nPM: Both have a close connection to Daito-ryu, even though Shioda Sensei and Kobayashi Sensei trained in slightly different eras – prewar and early postwar – so they were both kata based. My dojo in particular under Yoshida Sensei and Sugihara Sensei, who were both also koryu practitioners, had that flavor. Yoshinkan is much more codified, but the method of teaching through kata was the same. One of the main differences I feel was that Yoshinkan used more formal kamae and did not really allow flow until third dan and above, while Buikukai used almost the same kamae a Daito-ryu, neutral for strikes and hanmi for grabs, and because of Kobayashi sensei emphasized flow at an earlier stage.\n\nMAYTT: That is an interesting take on flow. When did you begin teaching? How did that experience help you further understand the intricacies of the art?\n\nPM: I moved back to the United States in 1994 and started training at the Aikikai of Philadelphia under the late Henry Smith. At that time, I believe he was a fifth dan. There was Watu James who was a third dan, one shodan, and I was a fresh shodan, so I began leading classes right away. Smith Sensei was a dancer, and his aikido showed that through his freedom of movement and its feeling. I was still using the kata method and developing my flow and feel. Teaching in the USA where, “We do the kata this way” is not an acceptable answer to, “Why do we do it this way?” I also began teaching Yagyu Shinkage-ryu at the same time after aikido practice.\n\nMAYTT: Could you tell us a little bit more about Henry Smith and the aikido community in Philadelphia in the early 1990s?\n\nPM: At the time there was only Smith Sensei and Utada Sensei teaching aikido in Philadelphia. Smith sensei had played football at University of Pennsylvania, and trained in Europe under Kazuo Chiba Sensei, and Nobuyoshi Tamura Sensei so his aikido was very dynamic and powerful. It was confusing for me at first, having trained with Japanese instructors exclusively up to that point, Smith Sensei was an extravagant eccentric, even by American standards. My first class he showed up in a Tibetan yak fur hat and aladdin shoes with bells on them. The dojo was pretty large, the mid-1990s were still a popular time for aikido so you had lots of different bodies to train with.\n\nMAYTT: I see. In 2006, you established your Aikido of Raritan Valley. What factors led you to take that course of action?\n\nPM: I had been training as a member of the Aikido Centers of New Jersey (ACNJ) and had been covering classes at the dojo. A few of the other members of my rank started their own dojos and I decided I wanted to start a dojo in my area and share what I had learned. We were all under the ACNJ umbrella as satellite dojos at that time.\n\nMAYTT: Also at your school you teach battodo, or Edo Yagyu Shinkage-ryu, which is one of two main branches of the Yagyu Shinkage-ryu kenjutsu. What was about Japanese swordsmanship that piqued your interest?\n\nPM: Batto is a part of what we do, but Yagyu Shinkage-ryu is a Hyoho, a strategic system. We train long sword, short sword, and empty hand, solo and in pairs. I started training fencing as a high school freshman, and in my sophomore year, I found a kendo dojo and started training there as well. At that time, as a teenager I was enthralled by the artistry of the blades themselves and the romanticism of sword combat, I didn’t learn till much later the influence of the sword on empty hand arts and spiritual development.\n\nMAYTT: For those who may not be aware, what are the differences between the Edo branch and the Owari branch of the ryu?\n\nPM: To someone from the outside the length of the kata and the flow of the movements will seem different, the intent and timing will also seem different. But at the heart, they aren’t so different – basically two men’s understanding of the same teachings from the same teacher. A friend of mine from the Yagyu Kai has seen me do enbu and said, “I know why you do that…, I just don’t like it.” And I have the same feeling about some of their kata.\n\nMAYTT: Interesting. Additionally, you are the current headmaster of Edo Yagyu Shinkage-ryu. What is it like to hold such a position and what are the responsibilities associated with being a headmaster?\n\nPM: It is a heavy weight, I never expected to be in this position; the idea of a foreign headmaster when I started training was not in the realm of possibilities. I am an envoy to hold and preserve the family tradition and history of our lineage and to make sure it is passed down and survives into the future. Practically speaking I am growing the art. When I joined, there were perhaps three dojo all inside Japan, with a total of fifty members give or take. Currently, we have our main dojo in Philadelphia, my personal dojo in New Jersey, and branches in Memphis and in Tampa. One of the Tampa members has moved back to Hungary and started a study group, and last year I got the Osaka branch back up and running after Covid. All in all, we are about 100 strong now, and I have plans for dojo in other parts of the states and Europe.\n\nMAYTT: Who would you consider to be an influential aikidoka in the Northeast? What is it about these individuals that set themselves apart from their peers?\n\nPM: In my aikido organization, dojo-cho must have a teacher they are connected to, and I have been lucky enough to train with Hal Lehrman Sensei of Aikido of Park Slope for some years now. Lehrman Sensei has incredible sensitivity and seems almost precognition with his ability to set a trap. I also enjoy training with Harvey Konigsberg Sensei of Aikido of Woodstock. He is able to seize the initiative without attacking; he rarely teaches more than one technique, but I always get a little something more about it when I take his class or take falls for him. I also really love the clean precision of Vu Ha Sensei of Boston Aikikai. He never talks about it, but in my mind, he is really teaching from a kata perspective and does a wonderful job of embodying the art. And of course, there are the ones no longer with us, the great Yoshimitsu Yamada Sensei, Henry Smith Sensei, Rick Stickles Sensei, Irv Faust Sensei – all these men have influenced my path in the art.\n\nMAYTT: Could you please tell us a little bit more about Hal Lehrman and the interconnectedness of the New York City aikido community?\n\nPM: Lehrman Sensei also has a dance background, and started aikido when he was just eighteen years old, three or four years before I was born. He trained with Yoshimitsu Yamada Sensei, Akira Tohei Sensei, the former and current Doshu of the Aikikai and all the great postwar uchi deshi. His aikido is extremely subtle, he will often dump me hard and say, “You did that.” And it’s true; the harder I attack, the harder I hit the floor. I learn something new from him every time I train with him. I’m new to the New York City aikido community in a way. At first, I only came to the Christmas seminar at New York Aikikai, but after moving from Philadelphia to New Jersey, I started attending more seminars with more former New York Aikikai members. A lot of North Jersey people would run into New York City for a class, but I am one and a half hours away in Central New Jersey, so it was rare for me.\n\nMAYTT: Final question. Many critiques, and even some within aikido itself, foresee it becoming a koryu in the future. With your experience in both aikido and Edo Yagyu Shinkage-ryu, do you feel that aikido may become a koryu in the future or will it become something different?\n\nPM: Well, you can’t become a koryu; your art either originated before the Meiji Restoration or it came after. But if you mean a martial art not focused on fighting – focused more on the movement and spiritual development – then that is what it already is. One of the main reasons to not have competitions is to take that focus on the outside away and turn it inwards. And I don’t mean this to say aikido is not an effective martial art – it can be – just that that is not the primary goal of training.\n\nMAYTT: Thank you again for joining us for this interesting conversation!\n\nPM: It was my pleasure!"
