We report a case of median raphe cyst in the perineum presenting as a perianal polyp in a 65-year-old, English white male with exceptionally rare ciliated epithelium. According to our knowledge, this is the third such case of ciliated median raphe cyst in the English literature. This case, also the first case of ciliated median raphe cyst in the perineum location, focuses on pathogenesis of median raphe cyst.\n\nMedian raphe cysts of the perineum in children.\n\nPubMed\n\nKrauel, Lucas; Tarrado, Xavier; Garcia-Aparicio, Luis; Lerena, Javier; SuÃ±ol, Mariona; RodÃ³, Joan; RibÃ³, Josep Maria\n\n2008-05-01\n\nMedian raphe cysts of the perineum are uncommon congenital lesions of the male genitalia. They can be found all the way from the distal penis and scrotum toward the perineum in a midline position. They are considered as congenital alterations in embryologic development. A case of a 6 year-old boy is presented. Review of the literature relevant to children was made regarding the embryologic, diagnostic, and treatment aspects. We believe it is important that adult and pediatric urologists recognize these lesions and their management to provide the appropriate information to the parents.\n\nMesopontine median raphe regulates hippocampal ripple oscillation and memory consolidation.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Dong V; Yau, Hau-Jie; Broker, Carl J; Tsou, Jen-Hui; Bonci, Antonello; Ikemoto, Satoshi\n\n2015-05-01\n\nSharp wave-associated field oscillations (â¼200 Hz) of the hippocampus, referred to as ripples, are believed to be important for consolidation of explicit memory. Little is known about how ripples are regulated by other brain regions. We found that the median raphe region (MnR) is important for regulating hippocampal ripple activity and memory consolidation. We performed in vivo simultaneous recording in the MnR and hippocampus of mice and found that, when a group of MnR neurons was active, ripples were absent. Consistently, optogenetic stimulation of MnR neurons suppressed ripple activity and inhibition of these neurons increased ripple activity. Notably, using a fear conditioning procedure, we found that photostimulation of MnR neurons interfered with memory consolidation. Our results demonstrate a critical role of the MnR in regulating ripples and memory consolidation.\n\nMesopontine median raphe regulates hippocampal ripple oscillation and memory consolidation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Dong V.; Yau, Hau-Jie; Broker, Carl J.; Tsou, Jen-Hui; Bonci, Antonello; Ikemoto, Satoshi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSharp-wave associated field-oscillations (~200 Hz) of the hippocampus, referred to as âripplesâ, are believed to be important for consolidation of explicit memory.

Using a pharmacogenetic approach, we find that selectively increasing serotonergic neuronal activity in wild-type mice is anxiogenic and reduces floating in the forced-swim test, whereas inhibition has no effect on the same measures. In a developmental mouse model of altered emotional behavior, increased anxiety and depression-like behaviors correlate with reduced dorsal raphÃ© and increased median raphÃ© serotonergic activity. These mice display blunted responses to serotonergic stimulation and behavioral rescues through serotonergic inhibition. Furthermore, we identify opposing consequences of dorsal versus median raphÃ© serotonergic neuron inhibition on floating behavior, together suggesting that median raphÃ© hyperactivity increases anxiety, whereas a low dorsal/median raphÃ© serotonergic activity ratio increases depression-like behavior. Thus, we find a critical role of serotonergic neuronal activity in emotional regulation and uncover opposing roles of median and dorsal raphÃ© function. Copyright Â© 2015 The Authors.

Both estradiol and fluoxetine increased swimming and decreased immobility in the forced swimming test. The forced swimming stress decreased integrated optical density of TPH-positive regions in dorsal and median raphe. Both estradiol and fluoxetine administration prevented integrated optical density of TPH-positive regions from being decreased by forced swimming stress. These observations suggest that both estradiol and fluoxetine have protective bearing on ovariectomized rats enduring forced swimming stress.\n\nDistinct Contributions of Median Raphe Nucleus to Contextual Fear Conditioning and Fear-Potentiated Startle\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSilva, R. C. B.; Cruz, A. P. M.; Avanzi, V.; Landeira-Fernandez, J.; BrandÃ£o, M. L.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nAscending 5-HT projections from the median raphe nucleus (MRN), probably to the hippocampus, are implicated in the acquisition of contextual fear (background stimuli), as assessed by freezing behavior. Foreground cues like light, used as a conditioned stimulus (CS) in classical fear conditioning, also cause freezing through thalamic transmission to the amygdala. As the MRN projects to the hippocampus and amygdala, the role of this raphe nucleus in fear conditioning to explicit cues remains to be explained. Here we analyzed the behavior of rats with MRN electrolytic lesions in a contextual conditioning situation and in a fear-potentiated startle procedure. The animals received MRN electrolytic lesions either before or on the day after two consecutive training sessions in which they were submitted to 10 conditioning trials, each in an experimental chamber (same context) where they. received foot-shocks (0.6 mA, 1 sec) paired to a 4-sec light CS. Seven to ten days later, the animals were submitted to testing sessions for assessing conditioned fear when they were placed for five shocks, and the duration of contextual freezing was recorded. The animals were then submitted to a fear-potentiated startle in response to a 4-sec light-CS, followed by white noise (100 dB, 50 ms). Control rats (sham) tested in the same context showed more freezing than did rats with pre- or post-training MRN lesions. Startle was clearly potentiated in the presence of light CS in the sham-lesioned animals. Whereas pretraining lesions reduced both freezing and fear-potentiated startle, the post-training lesions reduced only freezing to context, without changing the fear-potentiated startle. In a second experiment, neurotoxic lesions of the MRN with local injections of N-methyl-D-aspartate or the activation of 5-HT1A somatodendritic auto-receptors of the MRN by microinjections of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy- 2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) before the training sessions also\n\nResponses of opioid and serotonin containing medullary raphe neurons to electroacupuncture\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGuo, Zhi-Ling; Moazzami, Ali R.; Tjen-A-Looi, Stephanie; Longhurst, John C.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe midline medulla oblongata, which includes the nucleus raphe obscurus, raphe magnus and raphe pallidus (NRP), is involved in regulation of cardiovascular responses. Opioids and serotonin (5-HT) are thought to function as important neurotransmitters in this region. We previously have demonstrated that electroacupuncture (EA) at the Neiguan-Jianshi acupoints (P5-P6, overlying the median nerves) attenuates sympathoexcitatory blood pressure reflexes through its influence on several brain regions. However, the role of these three raphe nuclei in the acupuncture responses is unknown. In baroreceptor denervated and vagotomized cats, the present study evaluated c-Fos activation in the raphe nuclei induced by EA and examined its relationship to enkephalin and 5-HT. To enhance detection of perikarya containing enkephalin, colchicine (90â100 Î¼g/kg) was administered into the subarachnoid space in anesthetized cats 28â30 hours before the placement of acupuncture needles at P5-P6 acupoints with or without electrical stimulation for 30 min. Perikarya containing the opioid and 5-HT were found in the raphe nuclei of all animals following application of colchicine. Compared to controls without electrical stimulation (n=5), c-Fos immunoreactivity and neurons double-labeled with c-Fos and either enkephalin or 5-HT were found more frequently in all three midline medullary nuclei, especially in NRP (n=6, all P<0.05) of EA-treated cats. Moreover, neurons triple-labeled with c-Fos, enkephalin and 5-HT were noted frequently in the NRP following EA stimulation. These results suggest that the medullary raphe nuclei, particularly the NRP, process somatic signals during EA and participate in EA-related modulation of cardiovascular function through an opioid or serotonergic mechanism.

Projections from the median raphe nucleus (MnR) modulate dopaminergic activity in the forebrain and are also part of a behavioral disinhibition/inhibition system that produces phenotypes resembling behavioral variations manifested during manic and depressive phases of bipolar disorder. Objective Assess the effect of chronic lithium treatment on behavioral disinhibition induced by MnR lesions. Methods MnR electrolytic lesions were performed in C57BL/6J mice, with sham operated and intact animals as control groups. Following recovery, mice were chronically treated with lithium (LiCl, added in chow) followed by behavioral testing. Results MnR lesion induced manic-like behavioral alterations including hyperactivity in the open field (OF), stereotyped circling, anxiolytic/risk taking in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and light/dark box (LDB) tests, and increased basal body temperature. Lithium was specifically effective in reducing OF hyperactivity and stereotypy but did not reverse (EPM) or had a nonspecific effect (LDB) on anxiety/risk taking measures. Additionally, lithium decreased saccharin preference and prevented weight loss during single housing. Conclusions Our data support electrolytic lesions of the MnR as an experimental model of a hyper-excitable/disinhibited phenotype consistent with some aspects of mania that are attenuated by the mood stabilizer lithium. Given lithiumâs relatively specific efficacy in treating mania, these data support the hypothesis that manic symptoms derive not only from the stimulation of excitatory systems but also from inactivation or decreased activity of inhibitory mechanisms.

We examined the relationship between self-transcendence and serotonin transporter (SERT) availability in brainstem raphe nuclei, which are collections of five different serotonergic nuclei with rostro-caudal extension, using ultra-high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) with (11)C-3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethylphenylthio)benzonitrile ([(11)C]DASB) to elucidate potential roles of serotonergic neuronal activities in this personality trait. Sixteen healthy subjects completed 7.0T MRI and High Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT) PET. The regions of interest (ROIs) included the dorsal raphe nucleus (R1), median raphe nucleus (R2), raphe pontis (R3), and the caudal raphe nuclei (R4 and R5). For the estimation of SERT availability, the binding potential (BPND) was derived using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM2). The Temperament and Character Inventory was used to measure self-transcendence. The analysis revealed that the self-transcendence total score had a significant negative correlation with the [(11)C]DASB BPND in the caudal raphe (R5). The subscale score for spiritual acceptance was significantly negatively correlated with the [(11)C]DASB BPND in the median raphe nucleus (R2). The results indicate that the self-transcendence trait is associated with SERT availability in specific raphe subnuclei, suggesting that the serotonin system may serve as an important biological basis for human self-transcendence. Based on the connections of these nuclei with cortico-limbic and visceral autonomic structures, the functional activity of these nuclei and their related neural circuitry may play a crucial role in the manifestation of self-transcendence.

During development, the 5-HT projection system, besides an external placental source, represents one of the earliest neurotransmitter systems to innervate the brain. One of the targets of the 5-HT projection system, originating in the brainstem raphe nuclei, is the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an area involved in higher cognitive functions and important in the etiology of many neurodevelopmental disorders. Little is known, however, about the exact role of 5-HT and its signaling molecules in the formation of the raphe-prefrontal network. Using explant essays, we here studied the role of the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), an important modulator of the 5-HT signal, in rostral raphe-prefrontal network formation. We found that the chemotrophic nature of the interaction between the origin (rostral raphe cluster) and a target (mPFC) of the 5-HT projection system was affected in rats lacking the 5-HTT (5-HTT(-/-)). While 5-HTT deficiency did not affect the dorsal raphe 5-HT-positive outgrowing neurites, the median raphe 5-HT neurites switched from a strong repulsive to an attractive interaction when co-cultured with the mPFC. Furthermore, the fasciculation of the mPFC outgrowing neurites was dependent on the amount of 5-HTT. In the mPFC of 5-HTT(-/-) pups, we observed clear differences in 5-HT innervation and the identity of a class of projection neurons of the mPFC. In the absence of the 5-HTT, the 5-HT innervation in all subareas of the early postnatal mPFC increased dramatically and the number of Satb2-positive callosal projection neurons was decreased. Together, these results suggest a 5-HTT dependency during early development of these brain areas and in the formation of the raphe-prefrontal network. The tremendous complexity of the 5-HT projection system and its role in several neurodevelopmental disorders highlights the need for further\n\nCombined treatment with subchronic lithium and acute intracerebral mirtazapine microinjection into the median raphe nucleus exerted an anxiolytic-like effect synergistically.\n\nPubMed\n\nAn, Yan; Inoue, Takeshi; Kitaichi, Yuji; Chen, Chong; Nakagawa, Shin; Wang, Ce; Kusumi, Ichiro\n\n2016-07-15\n\nAlthough preclinical and clinical studies have established the efficacy of lithium augmentation of antidepressant drugs, the mechanism of action of lithium augmentation is not fully understood. Our previous study reported that subchronic lithium treatment enhanced the anxiolytic-like effect of systemic mirtazapine. In the present study, we examined the effect of subchronic lithium in combination with acute local intracerebral injection of mirtazapine on fear-related behaviors in a contextual fear conditioning test in rats to clarify the target brain region of lithium augmentation of mirtazapine. After conditioning by footshock, diet (food pellets) containing Li2CO3 at a concentration of 0.2% was administered for 7 days. Ten min before testing and 7 days after conditioning, mirtazapine (3Î¼g/site) in a volume of 0.5Âµl was acutely injected into the median raphe nucleus (MRN), hippocampus or amygdala. The combination of subchronic lithium and acute mirtazapine microinjection into the MRN but not the hippocampus or the amygdala reduced fear expression synergistically. These results suggest that intra-MRN mirtazapine treatment with subchronic lithium exerts the anxiolytic-like effect through the facilitation of the MRN-5HT pathway. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, numerous studies have reported that a large proportion of raphe projection cells are nonserotonergic. The identity of these projection cells is unknown. Recent studies have reported that the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 is found in both serotonergic and nonserotonergic neurons in both the median raphe (MR) and dorsal raphe (DR) nuclei. We injected the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B into either the dorsal hippocampus or the medial septum (MS) and used triple labeled immunofluorescence to determine if nonserotonergic raphe cells projecting to these structures contained VGLUT3. Consistent with previous studies, only about half of retrogradely labeled MR neurons projecting to the hippocampus contained serotonin, whereas a majority of the retrogradely labeled nonserotonergic cells contained VGLUT3. Similar patterns were observed for MR cells projecting to the MS. About half of retrogradely labeled nonserotonergic neurons in the DR contained VGLUT3. Additionally, a large number of retrogradely labeled cells in the caudal linear and interpeduncular nuclei projecting to the MS were found to contain VGLUT3. These data suggest the enigmatic nonserotonergic projection from the MR to forebrain regions may be glutamatergic. In addition, these results demonstrate a dissociation between glutamatergic and serotonergic MR afferent inputs to the MS and hippocampus suggesting divergent and/or complementary roles of these pathways in modulating cellular activity within the septohippocampal network.\n\nPrognostic Implications of Raphe in Bicuspid Aortic Valve Anatomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKong, William K F; Delgado, Victoria; Poh, Kian Keong; Regeer, Madelien V; Ng, Arnold C T; McCormack, Louise; Yeo, Tiong Cheng; Shanks, Miriam; Parent, Sarah; Enache, Roxana; Popescu, Bogdan A; Liang, Michael; Yip, James W; Ma, Lawrence C W; Kamperidis, Vasileios; van Rosendael, Philippe J; van der Velde, Enno T; Ajmone Marsan, Nina; Bax, Jeroen J\n\n2017-03-01\n\nLittle is known about the association between bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) morphologic findings and the degree of valvular dysfunction, presence of aortopathy, and complications, including aortic valve surgery, aortic dissection, and all-cause mortality. To investigate the association between BAV morphologic findings (raphe vs nonraphe) and the degree of valve dysfunction, presence of aortopathy, and prognosis (including need for aortic valve surgery, aortic dissection, and all-cause mortality). In this large international multicenter registry of patients with BAV treated at tertiary referral centers, 2118 patients with BAV were evaluated. Patients referred for echocardiography from June 1, 1991, through November 31, 2015, were included in the study. Clinical and echocardiographic data were analyzed retrospectively. The morphologic BAV findings were categorized according to the Sievers and Schmidtke classification. Aortic valve function was divided into normal, regurgitation, or stenosis. Patterns of BAV aortopathy included the following: type 1, dilation of the ascending aorta and aortic root; type 2, isolated dilation of the ascending aorta; and type 3, isolated dilation of the sinus of Valsalva and/or sinotubular junction. Association between the presence and location of raphe and the risk of significant (moderate and severe) aortic valve dysfunction and aortic dilation and/or dissection. Of the 2118 patients (mean [SD] age, 47â[18] years; 1525 [72.0%] male), 1881 (88.8%) had BAV with fusion raphe, whereas 237 (11.2%) had BAV without raphe. Bicuspid aortic valves with raphe had a significantly higher prevalence of valve dysfunction, with a significantly higher frequency of aortic regurgitation (622 [33.1%] vs 57 [24.1%], Pâ<â.001) and aortic stenosis (728 [38.7%] vs 51 [21.5%], Pâ<â.001). Furthermore, aortic valve replacement event rates were significantly higher among patients with BAV with raphe (364 [19.9%] at 1 year, 393 [21.4%] at 2 years, and 447\n\nSynergistic interaction between baclofen administration into the median raphe nucleus and inconsequential visual stimuli on investigatory behavior of rats\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVollrath-Smith, Fiori R.; Shin, Rick\n\n2011-01-01\n\nRationale Noncontingent administration of amphetamine into the ventral striatum or systemic nicotine increases responses rewarded by inconsequential visual stimuli. When these drugs are contingently administered, rats learn to self-administer them. We recently found that rats self-administer the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen into the median (MR) or dorsal (DR) raphe nuclei. Objectives We examined whether noncontingent administration of baclofen into the MR or DR increases ratsâ investigatory behavior rewarded by a flash of light. Results Contingent presentations of a flash of light slightly increased lever presses. Whereas noncontingent administration of baclofen into the MR or DR did not reliably increase lever presses in the absence of visual stimulus reward, the same manipulation markedly increased lever presses rewarded by the visual stimulus. Heightened locomotor activity induced by intraperitoneal injections of amphetamine (3 mg/kg) failed to concur with increased lever pressing for the visual stimulus. These results indicate that the observed enhancement of visual stimulus seeking is distinct from an enhancement of general locomotor activity. Visual stimulus seeking decreased when baclofen was co-administered with the GABAB receptor antagonist, SCH 50911, confirming the involvement of local GABAB receptors. Seeking for visual stimulus also abated when baclofen administration was preceded by intraperitoneal injections of the dopamine antagonist, SCH 23390 (0.025 mg/kg), suggesting enhanced visual stimulus seeking depends on intact dopamine signals. Conclusions Baclofen administration into the MR or DR increased investigatory behavior induced by visual stimuli. Stimulation of GABAB receptors in the MR and DR appears to disinhibit the motivational process involving stimulusâapproach responses.

The purpose of the present research was to examine the functional role of this pathway, using the contextual fear conditioning (CFC) model of anxiety. We show that intra-MRN microinjection of mirtazapine, a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant, reduced freezing in CFC without affecting general motor activity dose-dependently, suggesting an anxiolytic-like effect. In addition, intra-MRN microinjection of mirtazapine dose-dependently increased extracellular concentrations of serotonin (5-HT) but not dopamine in the DH. Importantly, intra-DH pre-microinjection of WAY-100635, a 5-HT1A antagonist, significantly attenuated the effect of mirtazapine on freezing. These results, for the first time, suggest that activation of the MRN-DH 5-HT1A pathway exerts an anxiolytic-like effect in CFC. This is consistent with the literature that the hippocampus is essential for retrieval of contextual memory and that 5-HT1A receptor activation in the hippocampus primarily exerts an inhibitory effect on the neuronal activity.

An implanted, wireless self-powered stimulator delivered intermittent 8-Hz pulse trains for 7 days to the rat's MR or DR, beginning 4â6âh after a moderate parasagittal (right) fluid-percussion injury. MR stimulation was also examined with a higher frequency (24âHz) or a delayed start (7 days after injury). Controls had sham injuries, inactive stimulators, or both. The stimulation caused no apparent acute responses or adverse long-term changes. In water-maze trials conducted 5 weeks post-injury, early 8-Hz MR and DR stimulation restored the rate of acquisition of reference memory for a hidden platform of fixed location. Short-term spatial working memory, for a variably located hidden platform, was restored only by early 8-Hz MR stimulation. All stimulation protocols reversed injury-induced asymmetry of spontaneous forelimb reaching movements tested 6 weeks post-injury. Post-mortem histological measurement at 8 weeks post-injury revealed volume losses in parietal-occipital cortex and decussating white matter (corpus callosum plus external capsule), but not hippocampus. The cortical losses were significantly reversed by early 8-Hz MR and DR stimulation, the white matter losses by all forms of MR stimulation. The generally most effective protocol, 8-Hz MR stimulation, was tested 3 days post-injury for its acute effect on forebrain cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a key trophic signaling molecule. This procedure reversed injury-induced declines of cAMP levels in both cortex and hippocampus. In conclusion, midbrain raphe nuclei can enduringly enhance recovery from early disseminated TBI, possibly in part through increased signaling by cAMP in efferent targets. A neurosurgical treatment for TBI using interim electrical stimulation in raphe repair centers is suggested.

The lesions are rare in adults with 7% occurring in the head and neck area and most often located in the submental region. In children population submental epidermoid cysts are extremely rare. The differential diagnosis of the lesions is necessary as it affects the choice of treatment methods. Among the pathological conditions occurring in that region, salivary retention cyst (ranula), thyroglossal duct cyst, vascular lymphatic malformation (cystic hygroma), median neck cyst, lymphadenopathy, thyroid gland tumor, laryngeal cyst, epidermoid and dermoid cysts, submental abscess, sialolithiasis and salivary gland inflammation should be considered. The authors of the present report demonstrate two cases of submental epidermoid cysts in children. Differential diagnosis in case of suspected submental epidermoid cyst in a child with proposed clinical practice and literature review is provided.\n\nHepatic cyst penetration of cefazolin in patients receiving aspiration sclerotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nLantinga, M A; Wijnands, T F M; Te Morsche, R H M; de SÃ©vaux, R G L; Kuipers, S; Allegaert, K; Burger, D; Drenth, J P H\n\n2016-09-01\n\nHepatic cyst infection is a potentially severe complication in cystic disease. Treatment demands effective antibiotic concentrations within the infected cyst. The aim of this study was to use elective hepatic cyst drainage as a unique pharmacokinetic model to investigate whether cefazolin, a first-generation cephalosporin, is able to penetrate hepatic cysts. Patients scheduled to undergo percutaneous aspiration sclerotherapy of a symptomatic non-infected, non-neoplastic hepatic cyst were eligible for this study. All participants received a single perioperative prophylactic dose of cefazolin (1000 mg, intravenously). We collected blood and cyst fluid samples to determine total and unbound cefazolin concentrations using HPLC. The primary outcome was hepatic cyst penetration, expressed as the ratio (%) of unbound concentration of cefazolin in cyst fluid to plasma (both in mg/L). We included eight patients [maleâ=â25%, median ageâ=â60 years (IQR 54-75), median estimated glomerular filtration rateâ=â97 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (IQR 67-102) and median serum albuminâ=â40 g/L (IQR 37-40)]. We detected low concentrations of unbound cefazolin in cyst fluid (â¤1.0 mg/L). The median plasma unbound cefazolin peak level (immediately after cefazolin administration) was 36.6 mg/L (IQR 23.7-54.1) and the level at the time of cyst fluid aspiration was 16.1 mg/L (IQR 13.0-20.1). In total, the hepatic cyst penetration of free cefazolin was only 2.2% (IQR 0.7-5.2). We developed a study model to investigate the penetration of antibiotics into hepatic cysts. Cefazolin did not reach adequate intracystic concentrations. Future studies should explore alternatives. Â© The Author 2016.

The lesions are rare in adults with 7% occurring in the head and neck area and most often located in the submental region. In children population submental epidermoid cysts are extremely rare. The differential diagnosis of the lesions is necessary as it affects the choice of treatment methods. Among the pathological conditions occurring in that region, salivary retention cyst (ranula), thyroglossal duct cyst, vascular lymphatic malformation (cystic hygroma), median neck cyst, lymphadenopathy, thyroid gland tumor, laryngeal cyst, epidermoid and dermoid cysts, submental abscess, sialolithiasis and salivary gland inflammation should be considered. The authors of the present report demonstrate two cases of submental epidermoid cysts in children. Differential diagnosis in case of suspected submental epidermoid cyst in a child with proposed clinical practice and literature review is provided.

D.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nPrevious anatomic and electrophysiological evidence suggests that serotonin modulates processing in the vestibular nuclei. This study examined the organization of projections from serotonergic raphe nuclei to the vestibular nuclei in rats. The distribution of serotonergic axons in the vestibular nuclei was visualized immunohistochemically in rat brain slices using antisera directed against the serotonin transporter. The density of serotonin transporter-immunopositive fibers is greatest in the superior vestibular nucleus and the medial vestibular nucleus, especially along the border of the fourth ventricle; it declines in more lateral and caudal regions of the vestibular nuclear complex. After unilateral iontophoretic injections of Fluoro-Gold into the vestibular nuclei, retrogradely labeled neurons were found in the dorsal raphe nucleus (including the dorsomedial, ventromedial and lateral subdivisions) and nucleus raphe obscurus, and to a minor extent in nucleus raphe pallidus and nucleus raphe magnus. The combination of retrograde tracing with serotonin immunohistofluorescence in additional experiments revealed that the vestibular nuclei receive both serotonergic and non-serotonergic projections from raphe nuclei. Tracer injections in densely innervated regions (especially the medial and superior vestibular nuclei) were associated with the largest numbers of Fluoro-Gold-labeled cells. Differences were observed in the termination patterns of projections from the individual raphe nuclei. Thus, the dorsal raphe nucleus sends projections that terminate predominantly in the rostral and medial aspects of the vestibular nuclear complex, while nucleus raphe obscurus projects relatively uniformly throughout the vestibular nuclei. Based on the topographical organization of raphe input to the vestibular nuclei, it appears that dense projections from raphe nuclei are colocalized with terminal fields of flocculo-nodular lobe and uvula Purkinje cells. It is hypothesized that\n\nPolidocanol sclerotherapy for hydroceles and epididymal cysts.\n\nPubMed\n\nSigurdsson, T; Johansson, J E; Jahnson, S; Helgesen, F; Andersson, S O\n\n1994-04-01\n\nA total of 87 patients with 63 hydroceles and 29 epididymal cysts underwent injection sclerotherapy with polidocanol on an outpatient basis. In the hydrocele group the cure rate after 1 treatment was 67% and the overall cure rate was 87% after a median followup of 14 months. In the group treated for epididymal cyst the corresponding cure rates were 46% and 64%, respectively, with a median followup of 12 months. A low rate of complications was observed. Of 86 evaluable patients 81 (94%) were satisfied with the procedure and the treatment results. Therefore, we recommend injection sclerotherapy with polidocanol as primary treatment for hydroceles and epididymal cysts in patients older than 40 years.\n\nHarmane inhibits serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons in the rat.\n\nPubMed\n\nTouiki, Khalid; Rat, Pascal; Molimard, Robert; Chait, Abderrahman; de Beaurepaire, Renaud\n\n2005-11-01\n\nHarmane and norharmane (two beta-carbolines) are tobacco components or products. The effects of harmane and norharmane on serotonergic raphe neurons remain unknown. Harmane and norharmane are inhibitors of the monoamine oxidases A (MAO-A) and B (MAO-B), respectively. To study the effects of harmane, norharmane, befloxatone (MAOI-A), and selegiline (MAOI-B) on the firing of serotonergic neurons. To compare the effects of these compounds to those of nicotine (whose inhibitory action on serotonergic neurons has been previously described). The effects of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine known to interact with serotonergic systems, are also tested. In vivo electrophysiological recordings of serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons in the anaesthetized rat. Nicotine, harmane, and befloxatone inhibited serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons. The other compounds had no effects. The inhibitory effect of harmane (rapid and long-lasting inhibition) differed from that of nicotine (short and rapidly reversed inhibition) and from that of befloxatone (slow, progressive, and long-lasting inhibition). The inhibitory effects of harmane and befloxatone were reversed by the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100 635. Pretreatment of animals with p-chlorophenylalanine abolished the inhibitory effect of befloxatone, but not that of harmane. Nicotine, harmane, and befloxatone inhibit the activity of raphe serotonergic neurons. Therefore, at least two tobacco compounds, nicotine and harmane, inhibit the activity of serotonergic neurons. The mechanism by which harmane inhibits serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons is likely unrelated to a MAO-A inhibitory effect.\n\nThe dorsal raphe modulates sensory responsiveness during arousal in zebrafish\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYokogawa, Tohei; Hannan, Markus C.; Burgess, Harold A.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nDuring waking behavior animals adapt their state of arousal in response to environmental pressures. Sensory processing is regulated in aroused states and several lines of evidence imply that this is mediated at least partly by the serotonergic system. However there is little information directly showing that serotonergic function is required for state-dependent modulation of sensory processing. Here we find that zebrafish larvae can maintain a short-term state of arousal during which neurons in the dorsal raphe modulate sensory responsiveness to behaviorally relevant visual cues. Following a brief exposure to water flow, larvae show elevated activity and heightened sensitivity to perceived motion. Calcium imaging of neuronal activity after flow revealed increased activity in serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe. Genetic ablation of these neurons abolished the increase in visual sensitivity during arousal without affecting baseline visual function or locomotor activity. We traced projections from the dorsal raphe to a major visual area, the optic tectum. Laser ablation of the tectum demonstrated that this structure, like the dorsal raphe, is required for improved visual sensitivity during arousal. These findings reveal that serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe have a state-dependent role in matching sensory responsiveness to behavioral context. PMID:23100441\n\nInvolvement of the raphe in the respiratory effects of gigantocellular area activation.\n\nPubMed\n\nRichard, C A; Stremel, R W\n\n1990-07-01\n\nPrevious reports indicate that the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis (NGC) of the brainstem reticular formation is involved in inhibitory respiratory and cardiovascular reflexes. Stimulation of portions of the nearby bulbar raphe complex, specifically the raphe magnus (RM), have also been shown to suppress phrenic activity and to decrease blood pressure and heart rate. Since synaptic connectivity between the NGC and the RM has been demonstrated, we hypothesized that the RM may be involved in the cardiopulmonary effects of NGC stimulation. This study found that electrolytic lesions in the raphe magnus attenuated the inhibitory respiratory effects but not the cardiovascular suppression due to NGC stimulation. Lesions in the raphe magnus also lowered resting blood pressure and resting breath frequency. We conclude that the RM may mediate part of the NGC-mediated respiratory effects.\n\nFrontal horn thin walled cysts in preterm neonates are benign\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPal, B; Preston, P; Morgan, M; Rushton, D; Durbin, G\n\n2001-01-01\n\nBACKGROUNDâScreening cranial ultrasound led to the discovery of isolated frontal horn cysts quite distinct from periventricular leucomalacia cysts.â¨AIMâTo clarify their significance, incidence, characteristics, causal factors or aetiology, and effect on long term outcome.â¨DESIGNâA retrospective observational study of all first cranial ultrasound scans (total of 2914) performed during the period 1984-1994 inclusive found 21 neonates with smooth thin walled frontal horn cysts: 18 of 2629 scanned were of birth weight < 1500 g or gestation < 33 weeks, and three of 285 were > 33 weeks gestation. Sequential ultrasound, maternal records, and neonatal events were retrospectively assessed. In survivors, routine neurodevelopmental evaluations were obtained. Postmortem studies of one cyst were performed to determine the nature and origin of these lesions.â¨RESULTSâOf the 21 subjects, 15 had isolated frontal horn cysts and six had additional ultrasound scan abnormalities, including four with subependymal haemorrhage. The sonographic features of frontal horn cysts were of distinctive morphology (elliptical, smooth, thin walled, ranging in size from 3 to 20 mm) and position (adjacent to the tip of the anterior horns). The cysts enlarged and then regressed by a median corrected age of 2 months. Subjects of < 33 weeks gestation (n = 18) had a median birth weight of 1465g (range 720-1990) and median gestation of 30 weeks (range 24-32). There was no consistent perinatal course. The neurodevelopmental outcome in 10 of the 11 survivors with isolated frontal horn cysts was normal. Five subjects died from causes unrelated to brain pathology in the neonatal period, and one subject died after infancy. Histological examination of a cyst at autopsy in one additional subject subsequent to the period of study confirmed the cyst to be lined by neuroblasts and ependymal cells.â¨CONCLUSIONSâThe incidence of frontal horn cysts in this low birthweight population was 7 per 1000 (0\n\nDevelopment of raphe serotonin neurons from specification to guidance.\n\nPubMed\n\nKiyasova, Vera; Gaspar, Patricia\n\n2011-11-01\n\nThe main features of the development of the serotonin (5-HT) raphe neurons have been known for many years but more recent molecular studies, using mouse genetics, have since unveiled several intriguing aspects of the specification of the raphe serotonergic system. These studies indicated that, although all 5-HT neurons in the raphe follow the same general program for their specification, there are also clear regional differences in the way that these neurons are specified and are guided towards different brain targets. Here we overview recent progress made in the understanding of the developmental programming of serotonergic neurons in the mouse raphe, emphasizing data showing how heterogeneous subsets of 5-HT neurons may be generated. Serotonergic progenitors are produced in the brainstem in different rhombomeres under the influence of a set of secreted factors, sonic hedgehog and fibroblast growth factors, which determine their position in the neural tube. Two main transcriptional gene networks are involved in the specification of 5-HT identity, with Lmx1b and Pet1 transcription factors as main players. A differential requirement for Pet1 was, however, revealed, which underlies an anatomical and functional diversity. Transcriptional programs controlling 5-HT identity could also impact axon guidance mechanisms directing 5-HT neurons to their targets. Although no direct links have yet been established, a large set of molecular determinants have already been shown to be involved in the growth, axon guidance and targeting of 5-HT raphe neurons, particularly within the forebrain. Alterations in the molecular mechanisms involved in 5-HT development are likely to have significant roles in mood disease predisposition. Â© 2011 The Authors.

These patients are usually managed surgically. We evaluated the feasibility and outcome of an alternative method of treatment of these patients. Seven patients with ruptured hepatic hydatid into the biliary tract underwent endoscopic treatment consisting of endoscopic sphincterotomy, cyst material extraction and hypertonic saline lavage via nasocystic catheter. Median age of patients was 40 years (range 17-50 years) with a male:female ratio of 2:5. Abdominal pain, jaundice and fever were seen in all patients. Six out of seven patients were positive for hydatid serology. All patients were successfully treated by endoscopic sphincterotomy, clearance of cyst material and hypertonic saline lavage. On a follow-up of 6 months to 4 years (median, 3.5 years), ultrasonography, computed tomography of the abdomen and magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen showed a complete cure. There were no complications related to procedure. This study demonstrates endoscopic treatment as one of the therapeutic options of ruptured hepatic hydatid cyst into the biliary tract.\n\nSingle-session alcohol sclerotherapy of symptomatic liver cysts using 10-20Â min of ethanol exposure: no recurrence at 2-16Â years of follow-up.\n\nPubMed\n\nLarssen, Trond Bjerke; Viste, Asgaut; Horn, Arild; Haldorsen, Ingfrid Salvesen; Espeland, Ansgar\n\n2016-09-01\n\nTo assess long-term results after single-session alcohol sclerotherapy of symptomatic benign liver cysts performed with maximum 20Â min of exposure to alcohol. We included 47 patients aged 32-88Â years (42 women, 5 men) with 51 benign non-parasitic liver cysts that were exposed to ethanol for 7-20Â min in a single sclerotherapy session and were followed for at least 24Â months. Each cyst was emptied before injecting ethanol (10% of cyst volume, but maximum 100Â mL) into it. The patient rotated from side to side to facilitate contact between ethanol and the whole cyst wall. Pre-treatment cyst volume was defined as the volume of aspirated cyst fluid after complete emptying of the cyst. Follow-up cyst volume was estimated based on computed tomography images. Cyst volumes were 30-4900 (median 520) mL at pre-treatment and 0-230 (median 1) mL at 24-193 (median 56) months follow-up, a reduction of 83-100% (median 99.7%). No cyst required repeated treatment during the follow-up. Median volume reduction was 99.7% at median 49Â months of follow-up for 35 cysts exposed to ethanol for 7-10Â min vs. 99.6% at median 75Â months of follow-up for 16 cysts exposed for 20Â min (pÂ =Â 0.83, Mann-Whitney test). Ethanol intoxication occurred in one patient. There were no other complications except for pain. Long-term results of single-session alcohol sclerotherapy performed with maximum 20Â min of exposure to ethanol were satisfactory with no sign of recurrence of cyst fluid.\n\nAneurysmal bone cyst: a hereditary disease?\n\nPubMed\n\nLeithner, Andreas; Machacek, Felix; Haas, Oskar A; Lang, Susanna; Ritschl, Peter; Radl, Roman; Windhager, Reinhard\n\n2004-05-01\n\nRecent genetic and immunohistochemical studies propose that the primary aneurysmal bone cyst is a tumour and not a reactive tumour-simulating lesion. Based on a familial case of aneurysmal bone cyst the authors contacted 135 patients with this disease. Sixty-eight females and 67 males (median age 14 years; range 2-73 years) were asked if other family members had bone lesions. One hundred and seven patients (79%) denied having other family members with lesions, 23 patients (17%) did not answer, and five patients (4%) gave evidence of other bone lesions in the family. These data indicate that a predisposing genetic defect could be part of a multifactorial pathogenesis in the development of some aneurysmal bone cysts.\n\nActivation of raphe nuclei triggers rapid and distinct effects on parallel olfactory bulb output channels\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKapoor, Vikrant; Provost, Allison; Agarwal, Prateek; Murthy, Venkatesh N.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe serotonergic raphe nuclei are involved in regulating brain states over time-scales of minutes and hours. We examined more rapid effects of serotonergic activation on two classes of principal neurons in the mouse olfactory bulb, mitral and tufted cells, which send olfactory information to distinct targets. Brief stimulation of the raphe nuclei led to excitation of tufted cells at rest and potentiation of their odor responses. While mitral cells at rest were also excited by raphe activation, their odor responses were bidirectionally modulated, leading to improved pattern separation of odors. In vitro whole-cell recordings revealed that specific optogenetic activation of raphe axons affected bulbar neurons through dual release of serotonin and glutamate. Therefore, the raphe nuclei, in addition to their role in neuromodulation of brain states, are also involved in fast, sub-second top-down modulation, similar to cortical feedback. This modulation can selectively and differentially sensitize or decorrelate distinct output channels.

However, we repeatedly encountered recurrences with this technique. Because splenic cysts are rare, we analyzed the combined experience of 3 German pediatric surgical departments. Between 1995 and 2005, primary and secondary nonparasitic splenic cysts were unroofed laparoscopically in 14 children (aged 5-12 years; median, 8.5 years). In 3 patients, the inner surface was coagulated with the argon beamer. In most children, the cavity was surfaced with omentum. In addition, in 4 patients the omentum was sutured to the splenic parenchyma. No intraoperative complications occurred, and no inadvertent splenectomy or blood transfusions were necessary. However, in 9 children (64%) the cysts recurred at intervals ranging from 6 to 12 months (median, 12 months). Also, argon laser treatment of the surface resulted in recurrence. Laparoscopic unroofing of true splenic cysts alone proved inadequate in this series. Either removal of the inner layer or partial splenectomy appears to be necessary to prevent recurrences.\n\nElectrophysical properties, synaptic transmission and neuromodulation in serotonergic caudal raphe neurons.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Y W; Bayliss, D A\n\n1998-06-01\n\n1. We studied electrophysiological properties, synaptic transmission and modulation by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) of caudal raphe neurons using whole-cell recording in a neonatal rat brain slice preparation; recorded neurons were identified as serotonergic by post-hoc immunohistochemical detection of tryptophan hydroxylase, the 5-HT-synthesizing enzyme. 2. Serotonergic neurons fired spontaneously (approximately 1 Hz), with maximal steady state firing rates of < 4 Hz. 5-Hydroxytryptamine caused hyperpolarization and cessation of spike activity in these neurons by activating inwardly rectifying K+ conductance via somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors. 3. Unitary glutamatergic excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSP) and currents (EPSC) were evoked in serotonergic neurons by local electrical stimulation. Evoked EPSC were potently inhibited by 5-HT, an effect mediated by presynaptic 5-HT1B receptors. 4. In conclusion, serotonergic caudal raphe neurons are spontaneously active in vitro; they receive prominent glutamatergic synaptic inputs. 5-Hydroxytryptamine regulates serotonergic neuronal activity of the caudal raphe by decreasing spontaneous activity via somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors and by inhibiting excitatory synaptic transmission onto these neurons via presynaptic 5-HT1B receptors. These local modulatory mechanisms provide multiple levels of feedback autoregulation of serotonergic raphe neurons by 5-HT.\n\nDermoid Cysts of the Floor of the Mouth: Two Case Reports\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMakos, Christos; Noussios, George; Peios, Marinos; Gougousis, Spyridon; Chouridis, Pantelis\n\n2011-01-01\n\nDermoid cysts in the floor of the mouth may be congenital or acquired. The congenital form, according to the main theory, originates from embryonic cells of the 1st and 2nd branchial arch. The acquired form may be due to traumatic or iatrogenic causes and as a result of the occlusion of a sebaceous gland duct. Its occurrence is less and is estimated to be from 1.6 to 6.4% of the dermoid cysts of the body in adults and 0.29% of the head and neck tumors occurring in children. They may also be classified as anatomical and histological. Anatomically, they are divided into median genioglossal, median geniohyoid, and lateral cysts, while histologically they are divided into epidermoid, dermoid cysts and teratomas. Clinically, a distinction between supra and inferior type as well as between central and lateral type is proposed in relation to themylohyoidmuscle and themidline, respectively. Histologically, an estimation of dermoid, epidermoid, and teratoid cysts is reported. Enucleation via intraoral and/or extraoral approach is the method of treatment. Two case reports of dermoid cysts in the floor of the mouth are presented in this paper, and an evaluation with regard to pathology, clinical findings, differential diagnosis, and treatment is discussed.

In order to test if morphine in the Nucleus Raphe Magnus is also analgesic in a tonic pain model, 5 microg of morphine or saline (control) were microinjected into the Nucleus Raphe Magnus of the rat. Analgesic effects were assessed following nociceptive stimulation using transient heating of the tail (phasic pain) and subcutaneous orofacial injection of 1.5 % formalin (tonic pain). While morphine was strongly analgesic for the tail-flick response (p <0.0001 compared to control), analgesia on the response to formalin was also observed for both early (p = 0.007) and late responses (p = 0.02). However, the response to formalin was not completely blunted. These results suggest that the Nucleus Raphe Magnus is not the exclusive site of action of morphine-induced analgesia in clinical conditions.\n\nDepressive disorder may be associated with raphe nuclei lesions in patients with brainstem infarction.\n\nPubMed\n\nNumasawa, Yoshiyuki; Hattori, Takaaki; Ishiai, Sumio; Kobayashi, Zen; Kamata, Tomoyuki; Kotera, Minoru; Ishibashi, Satoru; Sanjo, Nobuo; Mizusawa, Hidehiro; Yokota, Takanori\n\n2017-04-15\n\nDepression is a common symptom after stroke, but its neural substrates remain unclear. The ascending serotonergic system originates from the raphe nuclei in the brainstem. We hypothesized that depressive disorder due to brainstem infarction is associated with damage to the raphe nuclei. We prospectively enrolled 19 patients who had the first-ever acute isolated brainstem infarction in an observational cross-sectional study. All patients were evaluated by using the Montgomery Ã sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the clinician-rated version of Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-C) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Depressive disorder was diagnosed according to DSM-5 and MADRS score of 12 or greater. Diffusion tensor imaging and proton density-weighted images were used to identify damage in the raphe nuclei. Accordingly, patients were classified into either the raphe-nuclei-damaged or intact group. Prevalence of depressive disorder and the MADRS, AES-C, and MMSE scores were compared between the two groups. Depressive disorder was more frequent in the damaged group (n=6) than in the intact group (n=13) (83% vs. 15%; P=0.01). MADRS scores were higher in the damaged group than in the intact group (meanÂ±1 SD, 17.5Â±7.9 vs. 7.0Â±4.4; P=0.002), whereas the AES-C and MMSE scores did not differ between groups. We did not assess the damage to the ascending projection fibers from the raphe nuclei. Our results suggest that damage to the raphe nuclei underlies depressive disorder due to brainstem infarction, possibly via serotonergic denervation. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Several studies have suggested MRI follow-up if the cyst is larger than 10Â mm. However, cysts do not usually change during follow-up. Prevalence, growth, and structure of the pineal cysts were analyzed to decide if follow-up MRI is necessary. A retrospective review between 2010 and 2015 was performed using 3851 MRI examinations of children aged 0-16Â years to detect pineal cysts having a maximum diameter â¥Â 10Â mm. Eighty-one children with pineal cysts were identified and 79 of them had been controlled by MRI. Cysts were analyzed for the size, growth, and structure. A total of 1.8% of the children had a pineal cyst with a diameter â¥Â 10Â mm. Cysts were present in 48 girls (59.3%) and 33 boys (40.7%). Most pineal cysts (70/79) did not significantly grow during the follow-up (median 10Â months, range 3-145Â months). A total of 11.4% (9/79) of the cysts grew with the biggest change measured from the outer cyst wall sagittal anteroposterior dimension (mean 3.4Â mmÂ Â±Â 1.7Â mm). Only one cyst grew more than 5Â mm. We found no factors correlating with the cyst growth among 9 cysts that grew >Â 2Â mm. A majority of pineal cysts remained unchanged during the MRI follow-up. Results of this study suggest that routine MRI follow-up of pineal cysts is not necessary in the absence of unusual radiological characteristics or related clinical symptoms.\n\nPercutaneous drainage without sclerotherapy for benign ovarian cysts.\n\nPubMed\n\nZerem, Enver; ImamoviÄ, Goran; OmeroviÄ, Safet\n\n2009-07-01\n\nTo evaluate percutaneous short-term catheter drainage in the management of benign ovarian cysts in patients at increased surgical risk. Thirty-eight patients with simple ovarian cysts were treated with drainage of fluid content by catheters until output stopped. All patients were poor candidates for surgery. All procedures were performed under ultrasonographic (US) control and local anesthesia. Cytologic examination was performed in all cases. The patients were followed up monthly with color Doppler US for 12 months. Outcome measure was the recurrence of a cyst. During the 12-month follow-up period, 10 of 38 cysts recurred. Seven of the 10 cysts required further intervention, and three were followed up without intervention. Four of the seven patients who required further intervention underwent repeat transabdominal aspiration and three declined repeat aspiration and subsequently underwent surgery. After repeated aspirations, two of four cysts disappeared, one necessitated follow-up only, and one necessitated surgical intervention. Cyst volume (P = .009) and diameter (P = .001) were significantly larger in the cysts that recurred. No evidence of malignancy was reported in the cytologic examination in any patient. No patients developed malignancy during follow-up. No major complications were observed. The hospital stay was 1 day for all patients. The median duration of drainage in the groups with resolved and recurrent cysts was 1 day (interquartile range, 1-1) and 2 days (interquartile range, 1-3), respectively (P = .04). In patients considered poor candidates for open surgery or laparoscopy, percutaneous treatment of ovarian cysts with short-term catheter drainage without sclerotherapy appears to be a safe and effective alternative, with low recurrence rates.\n\nSurgical management of complicated hydatid cysts of the liver\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMalik, Ajaz A; Bari, Shams UL; Amin, Ruquia; Jan, Masooda\n\n2010-01-01\n\nAIM: To review the clinical presentation and surgical management of complicated hydatid cysts of the liver and to assess whether conservative surgery is adequate in the management of complicated hydatid cysts of liver. METHODS: The study was carried out at Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Science, Srinagar, Kashmir, India. Sixty nine patients with hydatid disease of the liver were surgically managed from April 2004 to October 2005 with a follow up period of three years. It included 27 men and 42 women with a median age of 35 years. An abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography and serology established diagnosis. Patients with jaundice and high suspicion of intrabiliary rupture were subjected to preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. Cysts with infection, rupture into the biliary tract and peritoneal cavity were categorized as complicated cysts. Eighteen patients (26%) had complicated cysts and formed the basis for this study. RESULTS: Common complications were infection (14%), intrabiliary rupture (9%) and intraperitoneal rupture (3%). All the patients with infected cysts presented with pain and fever. All the patients with intrabiliary rupture had jaundice, while only four with intrabiliary rupture had pain and only two had fever. Surgical procedures performed in complicated cysts were: infection-omentoplasty in three and external drainage in seven; intrabiliary rupture-omentoplasty in two and internal drainage in four patients. Two patients with intraperitoneal rupture underwent external drainage. There was no mortality. The postoperative morbidity was 50% in complicated cysts and 16% in uncomplicated cysts. CONCLUSION: Complicated hydatid cyst of the liver can be successfully managed surgically with good long term results. PMID:21160854\n\nFos and serotonin immunoreactivity in the raphe nuclei of the cat during carbachol-induced active sleep: a double-labeling study.\n\nPubMed\n\nYamuy, J; Sampogna, S; LÃ³pez-RodrÃ­guez, F; Luppi, P H; Morales, F R; Chase, M H\n\n1995-07-01\n\nThe microinjection of carbachol into the nucleus pontis oralis produces a state which is polygraphically and behaviorally similar to active sleep (rapid eye movement sleep). In the present study, using double-labeling techniques for serotonin and the protein product of c-fos (Fos), we sought to examine whether immunocytochemically identified serotonergic neurons of the raphe nuclei of the cat were activated, as indicated by their expression of c-fos, during this pharmacologically-induced behavioral state (active sleep-carbachol). Compared with control cats, which were injected with saline, active sleep-carbachol cats exhibited a significantly greater number of c-fos-expressing neurons in the raphe dorsalis, magnus and pallidus. Whereas most of the c-fos-expressing neurons in the raphe dorsalis were small, those in the raphe magnus were medium-sized and in the raphe pallidus they were small and medium-sized. The mean number of serotonergic neurons that expressed c-fos (i.e. double-labeled cells) was similar in control and active sleep-carbachol cats. These data indicate that there is an increased number of non-serotonergic, c-fos-expressing neurons in the raphe dorsalis, magnus and pallidus during the carbachol-induced state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nSingle-prolonged stress induces apoptosis in dorsal raphe nucleus in the rat model of posttraumatic stress disorder\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIntroduction Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that develops after exposure to a life-threatening traumatic experience. Meta-analyses of the brainstem showed that midsagittal area of the pons was significantly reduced in patients with PTSD, suggesting a potential apoptosis in dorsal raphe nucleus after single-prolonged stress (SPS). The aim of this study is to investigate whether SPS induces apoptosis in dorsal raphe nucleus in PTSD rats, which may be a possible mechanism of reduced volume of pons and density of gray matter. Methods In this study, rats were randomly divided into 1d, 7d and 14d groups after SPS along with the control group. The apoptosis rate was determined using annexin V-FITC/PI double-labeled flow cytometry (FCM). Levels of Cytochrome c (Cyt-C) was examined by Western blotting. Expression of Cyt-C on mitochondria in the dorsal raphe nucleus neuron was determined by enzymohistochemistry under transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The change of thiamine monophosphatase (TMP) levels was assessed by enzymohistochemistry under light microscope and TEM. Morphological changes of the ultrastructure of the dorsal raphe nucleus neuron were determined by TEM. Results Apoptotic morphological alterations were observed in dorsal raphe nucleus neuron for all SPS-stimulate groups of rats. The apoptosis rates were significantly increased in dorsal raphe nucleus neuron of SPS rats, along with increased release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm, increased expression of Cyt-C and TMP levels in the cytoplasm, which reached to the peak of increase 7 days of SPS. Conclusions The results indicate that SPS induced Cyt-C released from mitochondria into cytosol and apoptosis in dorsal raphe nucleus neuron of rats. Increased TMP in cytoplasm facilitated the clearance of apoptotic cells. We propose that this presents one of the mechanisms that lead to reduced volume of pons and gray matter associated with PTSD. PMID\n\nDorsal Raphe Serotonin Neurons Mediate CO2-Induced Arousal from Sleep.\n\nPubMed\n\nSmith, Haleigh R; Leibold, Nicole K; Rappoport, Daniel A; Ginapp, Callie M; Purnell, Benton S; Bode, Nicole M; Alberico, Stephanie L; Kim, Young-Cho; Audero, Enrica; Gross, Cornelius T; Buchanan, Gordon F\n\n2018-02-21\n\nArousal from sleep in response to CO 2 is a critical protective phenomenon. Dysregulation of CO 2 -induced arousal contributes to morbidity and mortality from prevalent diseases, such as obstructive sleep apnea and sudden infant death syndrome. Despite the critical nature of this protective reflex, the precise mechanism for CO 2 -induced arousal is unknown. Because CO 2 is a major regulator of breathing, prevailing theories suggest that activation of respiratory chemo- and mechano-sensors is required for CO 2 -induced arousal. However, populations of neurons that are not involved in the regulation of breathing are also chemosensitive. Among these are serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) that comprise a component of the ascending arousal system. We hypothesized that direct stimulation of these neurons with CO 2 could cause arousal from sleep independently of enhancing breathing. Dialysis of CO 2 -rich acidified solution into DRN, but not medullary raphe responsible for modulating breathing, caused arousal from sleep. Arousal was lost in mice with a genetic absence of 5-HT neurons, and with acute pharmacological or optogenetic inactivation of DRN 5-HT neurons. Here we demonstrate that CO 2 can cause arousal from sleep directly, without requiring enhancement of breathing, and that chemosensitive 5-HT neurons in the DRN critically mediate this arousal. Better understanding mechanisms underlying this protective reflex may lead to interventions to reduce disease-associated morbidity and mortality. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Although CO 2 -induced arousal is critical to a number of diseases, the specific mechanism is not well understood. We previously demonstrated that serotonin (5-HT) neurons are important for CO 2 -induced arousal, as mice without 5-HT neurons do not arouse to CO 2 Many have interpreted this to mean that medullary 5-HT neurons that regulate breathing are important in this arousal mechanism. Here we found that direct application of CO 2\n\nActivity of dorsal raphe cells across the sleepâwaking cycle and during cataplexy in narcoleptic dogs\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWu, M-F; John, J; Boehmer, L N; Yau, D; Nguyen, G B; Siegel, J M\n\n2004-01-01\n\nCataplexy, a symptom associated with narcolepsy, represents a unique dissociation of behavioural states. During cataplectic attacks, awareness of the environment is maintained, as in waking, but muscle tone is lost, as in REM sleep. We have previously reported that, in the narcoleptic dog, noradrenergic cells of the locus coeruleus cease discharge during cataplexy. In the current study, we report on the activity of serotonergic cells of the dorsal raphe nucleus. The discharge patterns of serotonergic dorsal raphe cells across sleepâwaking states did not differ from those of dorsal raphe and locus coeruleus cells recorded in normal rats, cats and monkeys, with tonic discharge in waking, reduced activity in non-REM sleep and cessation of activity in REM sleep. However, in contrast with locus coeruleus cells, dorsal raphe REM sleep-off neurones did not cease discharge during cataplexy. Instead, discharge continued at a level significantly higher than that seen in REM sleep and comparable to that seen in non-REM sleep. We also identified several cells in the dorsal raphe whose pattern of activity was the opposite of that of the presumed serotonergic cells. These cells were maximally active in REM sleep and minimally active in waking and increased activity during cataplexy. The difference between noradrenergic and serotonergic cell discharge profiles in cataplexy suggests different roles for these cell groups in the normal regulation of environmental awareness and muscle tone and in the pathophysiology of narcolepsy.

In the present study, we evaluated 5,7-dihydroxitryptamine (5,7-DHT) induced serotonergic neurotoxicity in foetal raphe serum free cultures from the rat. For this purpose, a model of foetal raphe serum free neuronal cultures from the rat was established, containing about 16% serotonergic neurons and studied up to 3 months. Two weeks old raphe cultures were exposed to the serotonergic neurotoxin 5,7-DHT (concentration range 10-100 microM) for 72 h, after which the medium was replaced and neurotoxicity was evaluated by immunocitochemistry 1 week later. Lactate dehydrogenase release into the medium, 72 h after exposure to 5,7-DHT, showed a concentration-dependent neurotoxicity. To access morphologically the serotonergic toxicity tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) was used as a specific marker of these neurons. Immunocitochemistry using TPH antisera showed a concentration-dependent serotonergic neurotoxicity induced by 5,7-DHT. Serotonergic neurons showed the typical pattern of \"pruning\" accompanied by axon terminals and dendrites loss, which were either partial or total. The axotomy induced by the neurotoxin was morphologically characteristic of retrograde axonal degeneration. Fluoxetine (0.1 microM) pre-treatment reduced 5,7-DHT-induced serotonergic neurotoxicity. These results indicate that the mechanism by which 5,7-DHT-induces serotonergic neurotoxicity is, at least partially, dependent on the toxin uptake by the serotonin transporter. Finally, we have established a robust model of primary raphe neuronal culture to evaluate serotonergic neurons development and the mechanisms of toxicity involving this neuronal population.\n\nLong-term experience with sclerotherapy for treatment of epididymal cyst and hydrocele.\n\nPubMed\n\nBraslis, K G; Moss, D I\n\n1996-04-01\n\nSymptomatic testicular hydrocele and cyst of the epididymis may be treated with either operation or sclerotherapy. The current report presents the experience of a 9 year prospective study using sodium tetradecyl sulphate (STD) sclerotherapy for the treatment of symptomatic hydrocele and/or epididymal cyst. A total of 102 lesions were treated during the study period, with an initial success rate of 76% which improved to 94% with multiple treatments.

The study included 25 patients (14 males, 11 females; mean age 33+/-19 years; range 7 to 69 years) who underwent surgery for odontogenic or nonodontogenic jaw cysts. The most common presentation was a swelling in the jaw with or without dental problems. Involvement was in the mandible in 18 patients, and in the maxilla in seven patients. The lesions consisted of eight radicular, six dentigerous, two nasoalveolar, two globulomaxillary cysts, and three keratocysts. Four patients had gingival, nasopalatine, residual, and median mandibular cysts, respectively. Marsupialization, curettage, extensive burring, enucleation, or marginal resection were performed depending on pre- and intraoperative findings. The defects were repaired with a corticocancellous iliac bone block graft in three patients and cancellous iliac bone chips in five patients. During a mean follow-up of 14 months (range 12 to 46 months), recurrence was seen in only one patient with a keratocyst. A good preoperative assessment, complete removal of the cystic lesion, and close radiographic follow-up are essential for a successful outcome in jaw cysts. In selected cases, reconstruction of the defects with autogenous corticocancellous iliac bone graft yields highly satisfactory results.\n\nOrthokeratinised odontogenic cyst mimicking periapical cyst\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRajalakshmi, R; Sreeja, C; Vijayalakshmi, D; Leelarani, V\n\n2013-01-01\n\nOrthokeratinised odontogenic cyst (OOC) denotes the odontogenic cyst that microscopically has an orthokeratinised epithelial lining.

When residual tissue exists, there is a propensity for further cyst development and expansion during and after radiation therapy. This can result in obstructive hydrocephalus, visual changes, and/or clinical decline. The authors present a quantitative analysis of cyst expansion during and after radiotherapy and examine how it affected subsequent management. METHODS The authors performed an institutional review board-approved retrospective study of patients with histologically confirmed craniopharyngioma treated between 2000 and 2015 with surgery and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) at a single institution. Volumetric measurements of cyst contours were generated by radiation oncology treatment planning software postoperatively, during IMRT, and up to 12 months after IMRT. Patient, tumor, and treatment-related variables were collected until the last known follow-up and were analyzed. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients underwent surgery and IMRT. The median total radiation dose was 54 Gy. Of the 27 patients, 11 patients (40.7%) demonstrated cyst expansions within 1 year of IMRT. Of note, all tumors with cyst expansion were radiographically Puget Grade 2. Maximal cyst expansion peaked at 4.27 months following radiation therapy, with a median volume growth of 4.1 cm 3 (mean 9.61 cm 3 ) above the postoperative cyst volume. Eight patients experienced spontaneous cyst regression without therapeutic intervention. Three patients experienced MRI-confirmed cyst enlargement during IMRT, all of whom required adaptive planning to ensure adequate coverage of the entire tumor volume. Two of these 3 patients required ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement and additional intervention. One underwent additional resection, and the other had\n\nSimple bone cyst of mandible mimicking periapical cyst.\n\nPubMed\n\nHs, Charan Babu; Rai, Bhagawan Das; Nair, Manju A; Astekar, Madhusudan S\n\n2012-05-29\n\nSimple bone cysts (SBC) are pseudocysts occurring less commonly in the maxillofacial region.

Local applications of 5-HT induced an increase in IPCSs frequency and amplitude in 45% of serotonergic cells. The effect suppressed by the blocker of fast sodium channels tetradotoxin. Antagonist of GABA receptor gabazine blocked IPSCs in neurons both sensitive and non-sensitive to 5-HT action. Applications of GABA induced a membrane current (I(GABA)), which was completely blocked by gabazine. The data suggest self-control of the activity of serotonergic neurons in nucleus raphe magnus by negative feedback loop via local GABAergic interneurons.\n\nBilateral varicocele: single transscrotal approach for Tauber antegrade sclerotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nMazzoni, Guglielmo; Minucci, Sergio; Gentile, Vincenzo\n\n2003-03-01\n\nTo describe the results of a new simple technique of single transscrotal approach for Tauber antegrade sclerotherapy in bilateral varicocele. During the period March 1998-June 2001, overall 341 patients were treated for varicocele using Tauber antegrade sclerotherapy. In 39 of these patients, sclerotherapy was performed bilaterally in the same session whilst in 34, rather than making two incisions at the root of the two hemiscrotums, a single incision was made on the median raphe. During this period, the same approach was used in 4 patients with left varicocele and right hydrocele, 2 patients with left varicocele and right epididymis cyst, 1 patient with bilateral varicocele and bilateral hydrocele, 1 patient with bilateral hydrocele and left varicocele. Maximum ray exposure time was 58 seconds (mean 30). Oro-tracheal intubation was not necessary in any of the patients. In 12 patients, besides local anesthesia, additional sedation was given. Slight bleeding of the wound, occurring in 3 patients, was medicated in the outpatient department. Patients prefer a single incision. When the incision is made on the median raphe, no scars remain. In bilateral varicocele, the single approach reduces invasiveness and increases patient satisfaction.\n\nSimple bone cyst of mandible mimicking periapical cyst\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHS, Charan Babu; Rai, Bhagawan Das; Nair, Manju A.; Astekar, Madhusudan S.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSimple bone cysts (SBC) are pseudocysts occurring less commonly in the maxillofacial region.

Single RD neurons projecting to the CPu and NRM/Gia by way of axon collaterals were identified by the retrograde double-labeling method with fluorescent dyes, Fast Blue and Diamidino Yellow, which were injected respectively into the CPu and NRM/Gia. Then, serotonin (5-HT)-like immunoreactivity of the double-labeled RD neurons was examined immunohistochemically; approximately 60% of the double-labeled RD neurons showed 5-HT-like immunoreactivity. The results indicated that some of serotonergic and non-serotonergic RD neurons might control motor functions simultaneously at the levels of the CPu and NRM/Gia by way of axon collaterals.\n\nCongenital cervical cysts, sinuses, and fistulae in pediatric surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nLaRiviere, Cabrini A; Waldhausen, John H T\n\n2012-06-01\n\nCongenital cervical anomalies are essential to consider in the clinical assessment of head and neck masses in children and adults.

A direct comparison of Spironucleus muris and Giardia microti cysts have revealed that cysts of S. muris are significantly smaller than cysts of G. miroti. At the ultrastructural level, the cyst walls are similar in fibrillar appearance, but the width of the S. muris cyst wall is significantly less than that of G. microti. The cysts of S. muris also differ from G. microti in that they contain a striated rootlet fiber, flagellar sheath, and numerous glycogen rosettes. Characteristic features of Giardia include the adhesive disc and median body. Although the cysts of Spironucleus and Giardia are similar in appearance, these unique morphological features can be used to distinguish between the 2 protozoa and should be employed in the detection of Giardia cysts in water samples.\n\nIncidence of pineal gland cyst and pineoblastoma in children with retinoblastoma during the chemoreduction era.\n\nPubMed\n\nRamasubramanian, Aparna; Kytasty, Christina; Meadows, Anna T; Shields, Jerry A; Leahey, Ann; Shields, Carol L\n\n2013-10-01\n\nTo report on the frequency of cysts and tumors of the pineal gland in patients with retinoblastoma. Observational retrospective case control study. Institutional. study population: Four hundred eight patients treated for retinoblastoma from January 2000 to January 2012 at Wills Eye Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of the pineal gland were evaluated in all patients with retinoblastoma. Characteristics of patients with pineal cysts and pineoblastoma were reviewed. Comparison of frequency of pineal gland cyst and pineoblastoma in children managed with systemic chemoreduction vs other methods. Of 408 patients, treatment included systemic chemoreduction in 252 (62%) and nonchemoreduction methods in 156 (38%). Overall, 34 patients (8%) manifested pineal gland cyst and 4 (1%) showed pineoblastoma. Of all 408 patients, comparison (chemoreduction vs nonchemoreduction) revealed pineal cyst (20/252 vs 14/156, P = .7) and pineoblastoma (1/252 vs 3/156, P = .1). The pineal cyst (n = 34) (mean diameter 4 mm) was asymptomatic (n = 34), followed conservatively (n = 34), and with minimal enlargement (n = 2, 9%) but without progression to pineoblastoma. The cyst was found in 22 germline and 12 nongermline patients (P = .15). Among the 4 patients with pineoblastoma, all had germline mutation and 2 had family history of retinoblastoma. Among all patients with family history of retinoblastoma (n = 45), 2 (4%) developed pineoblastoma. The pineoblastoma was asymptomatic in 2 patients and symptomatic with vomiting and headache in 2 patients. The mean interval from date of retinoblastoma detection to pineal cyst was 2 months (median 2, range 0-8 months) and to pineoblastoma was 27 months (median 28, range 7-46 months). Management included aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy, with 2 survivors. Pineal gland cyst was incidentally detected in 8% of retinoblastoma patients, causing no symptoms, and without progression to pineoblastoma\n\nPeptides, serotonin, and breathing: the role of the raphe in the control of respiration.\n\nPubMed\n\nPilowsky, Paul M\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOver the last 20 years, it has become clear that many functionally defined autonomic neurons in the brainstem contain many more than one neurotransmitter. Here, the possible role and functions of colocalized neuropeptides in the caudal raphe nuclei of the medulla oblongata are discussed. Caudal raphe neurons provide an extensive input to neurons throughout the brainstem and spinal cord, including respiratory and cardiovascular neurons. It is concluded that one plausible function of colocalized neuropeptides is to maintain the membrane potential of target neurons within a defined window so that they remain able to function at extremes of activity.

Serotonergic modulation of sensory responses among defined OB cell types is poorly characterized in vivo. Here, we used cell-type-specific expression of optical reporters to visualize how raphe stimulation alters sensory responses in two classes of GABAergic neurons of the mouse OB glomerular layer, periglomerular (PG) and short axon (SA) cells, as well as mitral/tufted (MT) cells carrying OB output to piriform cortex. In PG and SA cells, brief (1â4 s) raphe stimulation elicited a large increase in the magnitude of responses linked to inhalation of ambient air, as well as modest increases in the magnitude of odorant-evoked responses. Near-identical effects were observed when the optical reporter of glutamatergic transmission iGluSnFR was expressed in PG and SA cells, suggesting enhanced excitatory input to these neurons. In contrast, in MT cells imaged from the dorsal OB, raphe stimulation elicited a strong increase in resting GCaMP fluorescence with only a slight enhancement of inhalation-linked responses to odorant. Finally, optogenetically stimulating raphe serotonergic afferents in the OB had heterogeneous effects on presumptive MT cells recorded extracellularly, with an overall modest increase in resting and odorant-evoked responses during serotonergic afferent stimulation. These results suggest that serotonergic afferents from raphe dynamically modulate olfactory processing through distinct effects on multiple OB targets, and may alter the degree to which OB output is shaped by inhibition during behavior. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Modulation of the circuits that process sensory information can profoundly impact how information about the external world is represented and perceived.

There is evidence that immunologic factors are involved in the pathogenesis of both pathologies. In contrast to radicular cysts, the dentigerous cysts have a developmental origin. Macrophage polarization (M1 vs M2) is a main regulator of tissue homeostasis and differentiation. There are no studies comparing macrophage polarization in apical granulomas, radicular cysts, and dentigerous cysts. Forty-one apical granulomas, 23 radicular cysts, and 23 dentigerous cysts were analyzed in this study. A tissue microarray (TMA) of the 87 consecutive specimens was created, and CD68-, CD11c-, CD163-, and MRC1-positive macrophages were detected by immunohistochemical methods. TMAs were digitized, and the expression of macrophage markers was quantitatively assessed. Radicular cysts are characterized by M1 polarization of macrophages while apical granulomas show a significantly higher degree of M2 polarization. Dentigerous cysts have a significantly lower M1 polarization than both analyzed periapical lesions (apical granulomas and radicular cysts) and accordingly, a significantly higher M2 polarization than radicular cysts. Macrophage cell density in dentigerous cysts is significantly lower than in the periapical lesions. The development of apical periodontitis towards apical granulomas or radicular cysts might be directed by macrophage polarization. Radicular cyst formation is associated with an increased M1 polarization of infiltrating macrophages. In contrast to radicular cysts, dentigerous cysts are characterized by a low macrophage infiltration and a high degree of M2 polarization, possibly reflecting their developmental rather than inflammatory origin. As M1 polarization of macrophages is triggered by bacterial antigens, these results underline the need for sufficient bacterial clearance during endodontic treatment to prevent a possible M1 macrophage-derived stimulus for radicular cyst\n\nRelationship between pineal cyst size and aqueductal CSF flow measured by phase contrast MRI.\n\nPubMed\n\nBezuidenhout, Abraham F; Kasper, Ekkehard M; Baledent, Olivier; Rojas, Rafael; Bhadelia, Rafeeque A\n\n2018-02-23\n\nMost patients with pineal cysts referred for neurosurgical consultation have no specific symptoms or objective findings except for pineal cyst size to help in management decisions. Our purpose was to assess the relationship between pineal cyst size and aqueductal CSF flow using PC-MRI. Eleven adult patients with pineal cysts (> 1-cm in size) referred for neurosurgical consultations were included. Cyst volume was calculated using 3D T1 images. PC-MRI in axial plane with velocity encoding of 5 cm/sec was used to quantitatively assess CSF flow through the cerebral aqueduct to determine the aqueductal stroke volume, which was then correlated to cyst size using Pearson's correlation. Pineal cysts were grouped by size into small (6/11) and large (5/11) using the median value to compare aqueductal stroke volume using Mann-Whitney test. Patients were 39 Â± 13 years (mean Â± SD) of age, and 10/11 (91%) were female. There was significant negative correlation between cyst volume and aqueductal stroke volume (r=0.74; p=0.009). Volume of small cysts (4954Â±2157 mm3) was significantly different compared to large cysts (13752Â±3738 mm3; p= 0.008). The aqueductal stroke volume of patients harboring large cysts 33Â±8 Î¼L/cardiac cycle was significantly lower than that of patients with small cysts 96Â±29 Î¼L/cardiac cycle (p=0.008). Aqueductal CSF flow appears to decrease with increasing pineal cyst size. Our preliminary results provide first evidence that even in the absence of objective neurological findings or hydrocephalus; larger pineal cysts already display decreased CSF flow through the cerebral aqueduct.\n\nReward Processing by the Dorsal Raphe Nucleus: 5-HT and Beyond\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLuo, Minmin; Zhou, Jingfeng; Liu, Zhixiang\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) represents one of the most sensitive reward sites in the brain.

Neuronal diversity has become evident within the brain serotonin (5-HT) system, which is far more complex than previously appreciated. However, until now it has been difficult to define subpopulations of 5-HT neurons based on molecular phenotypes. We demonstrate that the MET receptor tyrosine kinase (MET) is specifically expressed in a subset of 5-HT neurons within the caudal part of the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRC) that is encompassed by the classic B6 serotonin cell group. Mapping from embryonic day 16 through adulthood reveals that MET is expressed almost exclusively in the DRC as a condensed, paired nucleus, with an additional sparse set of MET+ neurons scattered within the median raphe. Retrograde tracing experiments reveal that MET-expressing 5-HT neurons provide substantial serotonergic input to the ventricular/subventricular region that contains forebrain stem cells, but do not innervate the dorsal hippocampus or entorhinal cortex. Conditional anterograde tracing experiments show that 5-HT neurons in the DRC/B6 target additional forebrain structures such as the medial and lateral septum and the ventral hippocampus. Molecular neuroanatomical analysis identifies 14 genes that are enriched in DRC neurons, including 4 neurotransmitter/neuropeptide receptors and 2 potassium channels. These analyses will lead to future studies determining the specific roles that 5-HT MET+ neurons contribute to the broader set of functions regulated by the serotonergic system.\n\nCyst fluid telomerase activity predicts the histologic grade of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHata, Tatsuo; Molin, Marco Dal; Suenaga, Masaya; Yu, Jun; Pittman, Meredith; Weiss, Matthew; Canto, Marcia I.; Wolfgang, Christopher; Lennon, Anne Marie; Hruban, Ralph H; Goggins, Michael\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPurpose Pancreatic cysts frequently pose clinical dilemmas. On one hand, cysts with high-grade dysplasia offer opportunities for cure, on the other hand, those with low-grade dysplasia are easily over treated. Cyst fluid markers have the potential to improve the evaluation of these cysts. Since telomerase activity is commonly activated in malignant cells, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of cyst fluid telomerase activity measurements for predicting histologic grade. Experimental design Telomerase activity was measured using telomerase repeat amplification with digital-droplet PCR in surgically-aspirated cyst fluid samples from 219 patients who underwent pancreatic resection for a cystic lesion (184, dis"
