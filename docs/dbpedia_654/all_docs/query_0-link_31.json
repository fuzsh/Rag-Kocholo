        "text": "These three bibliographies represent the research synthesis which underlies all of my monographs, audio files, video files, and lectures. They are arranged according to Author, Date, and Subject in three separate PDF documents. Each document is fully searchable. There are 4,089 entries in the database. What is a Research Synthesis? A standard research synthesis follows a simple algorithm: 1) collect the relevant research studies; 2) filter these studies according to specified rejection criteria (e.g., no studies that are not placebo-controlled and double-blinded); 3) collate the data; 4) write the research synthesis. (Cooper 1984 and Cooper and Hedges 1994). A 'syncretic' research synthesis, however, modifies the second step by having no pre-determined filters and allowing all research to be included in the final paper. This follows the 17th century alchemists' advice on how to discover the truth and avoid deception: \"Therefore all those who desire to attain the blessing of this art (Alchemy) should apply themselves to study, should gather the truth from the books and not from invented fables and untruthful works. There is no way by which this art can truly be found (although men meet with many deceptions), except by completing their studies and understanding the words of the philosophers...\" (Theatrum Chemicum, p. 444, quoted in Jung 1968, p. 258). \"He should collect the books of different authors, because otherwise it is impossible to understand them and he should not throw aside a book which he has read once, twice, or even three times, although he has not understood it, but should read it again ten, twenty, fifty times or even more. At last he will see wherein the authors are mainly agreed: there the truth lies hidden...\" (Theatrum Chemicum, p. 213, quoted in Jung 1968 p. 258). Bibliography: 1. Cooper, Harris M. (1984).

Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press (Collected Works Vol. 12).\n\nThe moment we are introduced to science we are told it is a cooperative, cumulative enterprise. Like the artisans who construct a building from blueprints, bricks, and mortar, scientists contribute to a common edifi ce, called knowledge. Theorists provide our blueprints and researchers collect the data that are our bricks. To extend the analogy further yet, we might say that research synthesists are the bricklayers and hodcarriers of the science guild. It is their job to stack the bricks according to plan and apply the mortar that makes the whole thing stick. Anyone who has attempted a research synthesis is entitled to a wry smile as the analogy continues. They know that several sets of theory-blueprints often exist, describing structures that vary in form and function, with few a priori criteria for selecting between them. They also know that our data-bricks are not all six-sided and right-angled. They come in a baffl ing array of sizes and shapes. Making them fi t, securing them w...\n\nThe purpose of a research synthesis is to construct new knowledge by making explicit connections and relations between individual primary research reports that were not visible before. With the current thrust on evidence-based policy and practice, large scale funding has become available to some organisations which are primarily committed to support systematic reviews. Examples of such organisations include the &quot;Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre (EPPICentre)&quot;, &quot;The Campbell Collaboration&quot; and &quot;What Works Clearinghouse?&quot;. These systematic reviews tend to be implicitly oriented along positivism and are geared at measuring the overall effectiveness of various educational decisions. In this paper, I assert that the variety and complexity evident in contemporary educational research must also be accommodated, encapsulated and celebrated at the level of synthesising educational research. I propose a Methodologically Inclusi..."
