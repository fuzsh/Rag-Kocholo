Classic in the simplicity of its architecture, the Art Palace strikes a strong and dignified note in the Exposition. It comprises four massive buildings, known as the Central Building, the East and West Pavilions, and the International Sculpture Court. The Central Building, of gray limestone and brick, is to remain on the ground, a lasting memorial of the Exposition, and a permanent Art Museum for the City of St. Louis. In composition it is a tall nave, fronted by a Corinthian portico, above which appears the large lunette which, repeated elsewhere, gives abundant light for the interior. On each side of the main entrance are seated figures, one representing Sculpture, executed by Daniel Chester French, and the other repre- senting Painting and executed by Louis Saint Gaudens. Above the main portico are six figures symbolizing the six great periods of art, as follows: Egyptian Art, by Albert Yaegers; Classic Art, by F. E. Elwell; Gothic Art, by John Gelert; Oriental Art, by Henry Linder; Renaissance Art, by Carl Tefft; Modern Art, by C. F. Hanann. The figure, “Inspiration,” crowning the building, above the main entrance, is executed by Andrew O’Connor. Two bronze griffins, which are effectively used as ornamentations on either end of the main pediment at its base, are executed by A. Phimister Proctor. Near each end of the front of the Central Building, in niches, are two seated figures, representing “Truth,” by Chas. Grafly, and “Nature,” by Philip Martiny. The last five named figures are gilded, a golden note which is repeated at intervals on all the structures and decorations of Art Hill. In the frieze of the main building are placed twenty medallions in stone, con- taining portraits of the great architects, painters and sculptors. These have been executed by George T. Brewster and O. Piccirilli. The intermediate figures sur- rounding the base of the building are replicas from the antique. The East and the West Pavilions, giving, with the Central Building, a total length on the front of eight hundred and thirty feet, and extending back four hundred and fifty feet, enclose a Quadrangle in which is located the fourth building of the group, the International Sculpture Court, which is built, as are the East and West Pavilions, of brick ornamented with staff. This court is one hundred and fifty feet long by ^ne hundred feet wide, its plan being rectangular with an exedra or semi-circular bay at the east and west ends. In architecture it is lighter and more decorative than the main buildings, with motives from the Italian Renaissance. The enclosed space is laid out as a garden, where fountains, growing plants and shrubbery are introduced with charming effect. Here is suggested, beside the close relation be- tween the allied arts of sculpture and architecture, the relation of art to nature. The arrangement of the Art Palace differs from previous expositions, in that all the exhibits are installed on the ground floor. The entire United States exhibit is installed in the Central Building, and the foreign exhibits in the East and West Pavilions, with the exception of sculpture, which is found in the Sculpture Court. The bringing together of foreign sculpture in this building affords an opportunity for close comparison of the various schools. The Central Pavilion is entered from the north; the East and the West Pavilions are entered from the Main Pavilion and also from the north. The outer entrance to the Sculpture Court is from the south. The Art Palace is located near the center of the Exposition, on Art Hill, ninety feet above the level of the grounds. It is directly in the rear of Festival Hall and the Colonnade of States, and is witliin easy reach b}'^ paths gradually ascending the hill, or by the flight of steps leading up from the Grand Basin to Festival Hall. There is also a general station on the Intramural Railway in the rear of the building. The architect of the Main Buildings of the Art Palace is Cass Gilbert of New York, and the Sculpture Pavilion is designed by Emmanuel L. Masqueray. CENTRAL STRUCTURE, ART PALACE.

The generous response of foreign countries to the invitation extended and the loyalty of American artists, have contributed to form a collection which is representative of contemporary art. The art of the Exposition as a whole is not only modern but recent. Several sections are composed entirely of works which have been produced since the Chicago Exposition of 1893. Here is the latest word from the studios. It is when this rule of the selection of works of contemporaneous art is followed, that the history of art becomes consecutive and is vividly told in the modern exposition-story. In recognition of the historical significance of the Exposition, there is added, in the United States section, to contemporaneous art, a retrospective division which includes works produced between 1803, the date of the Louisiana Purchase, and 1893. In this division are also classed the works of artists who lived within this period whose works have influenced the development of the art of the past century. There is also in the United States Section a loan division composed of foreign masterpieces from public or private collections owned in this country. Among the works installed in the galleries devoted to the Loan Collection are examples by artists whose influence has been felt by art workers in every country — among them Rembrandt, Franz Hals, Rousseau, Constable, Turner, Diaz, Corot, Gerard Dou, and Gainsborough. The exhibit of paintings in the United States Section demonstrates again the fact made plain at the Paris Exposition, and cordially acknowledged there, that we have a distinctive national art, so individual that it can be mi-staken for no other. American art, like American literature, is eclectic; but when from the technique of the foreign school the artist comes home for his subject, his interpretation and his atmosphere, we have the American picture. This exhibition is most comprehensive, including Arnerican artists living abroad, as well as an equal representation from the different ‘sections of this country. Figure painting in oil and water color, and in the recent notable revival of miniature art, exhibits the strongest and best traits of modern art, with the re- finement which is so pronounced a characteristic of American work. The works of American portrait painters, including those of international reputation, are promi- nent in the exhibition; and beside reaching the highest standard of modern portrait art, recall the earlier traditions of .American portraiture. Mural painting cannot, from its very nature, be adequately displayed in an exhibition, but what is here exhibited in sketches, studies and photographic reproductions of finished works, emphasizes the fact that we have, under the strong impulse of civic improvement, entered upon a distinct period of mural decoration. Our school of landscape art is here in full force. The works of the most prominent American sculptors will be found, not only in the galleries, but in the Exposition grounds. American archi- tects, engravers and illustrators are fully represented. The Art Department has here adopted a broader classification than has pre- vailed at previous expositions. For the first time at an international exposition in this country Applied Art has been placed on a plane with what is known as the •‘Fine Arts.” A similar attempt was made at the Chicago Exposition to put applied art in its rightful place, but the art worker failed to fully recognize his opportunity, and the response was comparatively meager. During the 90’s the Arts and Crafts movement, developing strongly in England, in certain sections of the continent, and in the United States, has made for itself a distinct and permanent place in the world of art. Flere, for the first time in an exposition catalogue the initials “A. & C.” — Arts and Crafts — appear, and the work for which they stand greatly broadens and diversifies the interest of the collections. The Arts and Crafts movement is a protest against- the monotony of machine-made things; it is a recog nition of the dignity of hand work, of the individuality of the worker and of the value of artistic feeling and knowledge, in whatever medium expressed. The art- craftsman works in the spirit of the old guild and the master-workman, with the added touch of keen modern thought. Never before in our country have the applied arts, which are closely related to every-day life, made such a showing as is here made. Exhibits in glass, earthenware, metal, leather, wood and textiles as well as examples of artistic bookbinding, are placed in side-lighted galleries, specially adapted for their showing, and constitute a most attractive feature of the exhibition. Numerous entries in the Division of Applied Art attest the interest which has been aroused by this new departure. And when it is remembered that the same high standard of selection was observed here as in other departments, it is evident that much good work in the Arts and Crafts is being done in the United States. The exhibit is effectively installed in cases, thus making an impression which could not be made if it were scattered throughout the galleries as bric-a-brac, as has been its fate in previous expositions. The characteristics of American applied art, as shown here, are originality of design, good workmanship, and a daring use of new material, as in the use of semi-precious stones in jewelry. The exhibition of the British Section is representative of the art work of Great Britain, Scotland and Ireland during the last decade, the collection being equal or superior to that made at Chicago, and not surpassed by any collection of art works ever sent from English shores. The Art Committee, made up of the presi- dents of the various art societies of the United Kingdom, gives assurance that the exhibition is national in its scope — an assurance fully confirmed by the list of artists’ names. The best known names in English art — including the three great painters, Millais, Leighton and Burne-Jones, who have died during the last decade — with others of world-wide reputation, are represented here. In sculpture, owing to difficulty of transportation, no attempt has been made to exhibit monumental works. A careful selection, however, of smaller works shows the best spirit of modern sculpture. The exhibit of applied arts is a most generous response to the new recognition given in this Exposition to this work. In three galleries, specially deco- rated for the purpose, is an exhibit showing the influence of such artists as William Morris and Walter Crane — the largest exhibition of its kind which England has made at any exposition. The present collection is the largest and most important one that the French nation has ever sent out of its own country, and is most comprehensive in scope, showing the great versatility of the present day painting of France. Among works in the French Section representing the older masters of that school are those of Carolus Duran, Bouguereau, Henner, Detaille, Flameng, Puvis de Chavannes, Robert Fleury, and Lhermitte. The younger men — the coming masters — in painting and in sculpture are fully represented by works showing the best characteristics of French art. A large exhibit of the applied arts shows the results of generations of trained artist-artisans. In the Holland section a more complete idea of the art of that country niay be - gained than has been possible in any former Universal Exposition, either in the United States or in Europe, outside of their own country. The collection is made up of oil paintings, water colors, etchings and engravings, with such works of sculp- ture as can be installed in the picture galleries, all by Holland’s representative artists. Prominent on the walls are the works of Israels, Jacob and Willem Maris, Mesdag, and Blommers, masters of the school which has made Holland famous. In applied art is shown work in pottery, wood, silver, and copper. Art in Austria is thoroughly organized in four great national societies, so distinct from each other that their individuality has been observed in the grouping of the pictures on the walls, and also in the catalogue. Beside the exhibits of the two Austrian societies, including such artists as Hugo Charlemont, Alois Schram and Karl Pippich, there are those of the Bohemian and Polish artists, each displaying distinctive national traits. Owing to the lack of space which it was possible to assign to Austria, only a portion of these collections is placed in the Art Palace, the remainder being installed in their National Pavilion. In the German Section a larger and more comprehensive exhibit has been made than at any previous exposition in this country. Lenbach, lately deceased, Germany’s most famous portrait painter, is represented by five notable portraits. Adolf von Menzel, Paul Meyerheim, the historical painter von Werner, Franz von Defregger, Ludwig Knatis. Leibl, Loefftz, Schuster-Waldau, Keller, Langhammer, with many others, make this collection representative of modern German art. Noted historical paintings are lent from the public galleries of Germany. The sculptors Reiehold Begas, Peter Breuer, A. Bruett, Heinrich Epler, Ernst Freese, E. Hundrieser,^ Erich Hoesel and many others contribute to a large sculptural exhibit, which includes many figures of heroic size. ^ In the Hungarian Section are exhibited works of the foremost artists of their national school. While the list does not include all the most noted names in Hungarian art, those who are here maintain the high national standard. Mun- kacsky, whose pictures are known throughout the world, and some of whose greatest paintings are owned in the United States, is here represented by typical scenes from Hungarian peasant life. L. Paal, one of Hungary’s best landscape artists, and K. Lotz, portrait painter and noted fresco artist, are among the well known names. Many of the painters are of the newer generation of Hungarian artists, and the collection bears evidence of a high standard of selection. The exhibit in the Belgian Section represents the art activity of the last decade, all the paintings having been produced during that time. In the sculpture, which is installed both in the .A.rt Palace, and the galleries of the Sculpture Pavilion, a representative exhibit is made. Frans Courtens, Leempoels, Heymans, Verhaert, and Gilsoul are among the noted names in Belgian art, and are represented here by important works in figure and landscape. The paintings in the Bulgarian Section are characterized by strong and sympathetic interpretation of the national life. Among the noted artists here represented are A. MitofT and J. V. Mrkvitchka; with a sculpture exhibit comprising statues, busts, and bronze medallions. It is entirely modern art which is shown in the Italian section, most of the paint- ing and sculptures having been produced since the Chicago Exposition. The late decision of the Italian Government to participate prevented the execution of works specially for this Exposition; but the oldest and largest of the art societies of Italy, the International Art Association in Rome, has most earnestly and successfully pro- moted this exhibition. The spirit of modern Italian art is individual; all v/orking together for the development of a national art. Besides the work of contemporary artists, important works are shown by older artists who have had a strong influence on modern Italian art. Among the noted names in this exhibition are G. Previati, A. Rizzi, A. Dali ’Oca Bianca and C. Laurenti. The exhibit of Portugal is installed in one gallery, painting and sculpture being grouped together. Among the more prominent artists of Portugal are Salgado and Columbano, represented here mainly by portraits, and Jose de Brito. Japan comes to this Exposition with an exhibit displaying in cloisonne, art lacquer, enamels, sculpture and painting the well-known characteristics of Japanese art. There are shown noted examples of the old school of landscape art, the tradi- tions of which are the glory of Japan. The foremost bronze casters of the country are here represented by masterpieces. The sculptural exhibit in ivory, wood and terra cotta, shows groups and figures illustrative of scenes in Japanese life. There are also oil paintings done by younger artists in the European method. The leaders in the school of landscape art which is so pronounced a feature of this exhibition are Gaho Hashimoto, Kwampo Araki, Keinen Imao, and Giokusho Kawabata. The impression made by the Swedish pictures at the Chicago Exposition is repeated here. Nowhere is art more patriotic than in Sweden and nowhere has a stronger effort been made to develop a national art, and to induce the return of the artist to his native soil. Since 1880 these efforts have been successful, and have resulted in the development of an art which has a vital connection with the life and civilization of the country. In architecture and sculpture is seen also this same strong showing of race-traits. Among the artists in this exhibition best known in this country are Zorn, Liljefors, and Carl Larsson. _ Russia is represented by a collection of over six hundred works of art, consisting mainly of paintings which illustrate fully the present tendencies of the art of that country. Ten different art societies are represented, the works being hung in their collective capacity, showing a certain individual trend in the case of each society which is well worthy the attention of the student. Included in the collection arc the paintings of such well-known members of the Imperial Academy of Arts as Repin, Vladimir and Alexander Makofsky, Dubofsky, Kasatkine, Volkoff, Soukherofsky, Kosheleff, Venig, Verestchagin (now deceased), Maimon, and von Licbhardt. Re- sides the work of the artists here named there are independent collections illustrative of “Ancient Russia,’’ “The Ural and its Riches” and “Siberia,” which have never before been displayed outside of Russia. As a whole, the display emphasizes the historical and social aspects of Russian life and possesses uncommon interest. The works of art exhibited in the Argentine Section place this South American republic among the nations which cultivate art with dignity and profit. r Painters and sculptors who have studied in France and Italy have returned home to create an art which impresses one with its individuality, sense of harmony and purity of style. Among the artists whose works are represented in this notable collection are Eduardo Sivori, Ernesto de la Carcova, Eduardo Schiaffino, Pio Collivadino, Carlos Ripamonte, Cesareo de Quiros, Correa Morales, Irurtia, Dresco, Alonso, Artigue, Giudici, Garcia and Diana Dampt. The exhibits in the Brazilian Galleries are mostly paintings, and both in land- scape and in figure portray the life and atmosphere of the country. Owing to the late decision of the Brazilian Government to participate in the Exposition a number of her best known artists do not appear in this exhibition. Among the artists represented are Aurelio de Figueiredo, B. Calixto, P. Weingartner, M. Brocos, in etchings, and others of equal note. The art interests of Brazil are fostered by a School of Fine Arts, which offers scholarships, sending her artists t© European art centers for study, while at home she also maintains schools of arts and trades. An interesting exhibit of applied art in this section is composed of original designs and pottery by E. Visconti. Mexico has an exhibit of paintings which in figure and landscape gives glimpses of the life of the country, the most notable feature of the exhibit being the collection of paintings by Antonio Fabres. Cuba, which for the first time exhibits as a nation at an international ex- position, shows a collection of oil paintings, engravings and lithographs. Promi- nent in the collection are the works of Aurelio Melero and Leopoldo Romanach. , Art in Canada is of comparatively recent growth, and the present exhibition is under the direction of the Royal Canadian Academy, the organization which holds | together the art-interests of the country. The works in the Canadian galleries are entirely pictorial, and are the work of Canadian artists who have studied in the art I centers of Europe, and return home to paint. Many of them have exhibited at the i Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo, where they won honorable mention. The International Section is made up from the works of artists of countries not officially represented by national commissions or committees. Among them are ^ works by Norwegian, Danish, Peruvian and Swiss artists, and an exhibit from Ceylon and China of paintings and works of applied art.
