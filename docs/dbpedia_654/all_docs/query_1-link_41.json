        "text": "Kenneth George Edward Cottier was born on December 14th, 1933, which as he always liked to point out, was 50 years to the day after O Sensei. Cottier belonged to a working class family who lived in Birkenhead, which was once a busy shipbuilding town located near Liverpool, United Kingdom.\n\nThe Cottier family was evacuated to Wales during World War II, which interrupted Ken’s school education for some time. When the family moved back to Birkenhead, Cottier resumed school, but he left after finishing Grammar school at age 15 to begin working as a clerk in a bakery, and subsequently in steelworks. He was drafted in the army at age 18 and was stationed in Korea for two years between 1953 and 1954, which gave him an opportunity to visit Japan on three occasions while he was off-duty.\n\nI always wanted to go to Japan, I had a strong impression of Japan, it sounded very mysterious.Ken Cottier interviewed by Frank Burlingham in 1999\n\nJudo beginnings\n\nCottier developed an interest in budo around age 15 after hearing about a jujutsu school in Liverpool, but he was only able to start practicing judo in 1958 when he found a dojo in Birkenhead. It was part of the British Judo Council, headed by legendary judo master Abe Kenshiro Sensei.\n\nOn discovering Judo I soon became hooked. Tuesday and Friday practice nights became my favorites, as opposed to the drinking and dancing Saturday and Sunday ones.Ruddock, Alan - Tales from the Life of Kenneth George Edward Cottier\n\nAbe Kenshiro Sensei used to travel regularly from London to teach courses throughout the country and Cottier was able to study under him on several occasions. Cottier actually liked judo so much that he gave up his job to spend three months in London in 1961 in order to undertake a teacher’s qualification course from the British Judo Council under the supervision of Abe. There, Cottier got the chance to train at Abe’s famous “Hut Dojo\" in Hillingdon. He later tested for shodan in front of Abe Sensei but failed the exam.\n\nAikido discovery\n\nCottier made his first ever visit to London in 1959 when he went to support a friend’s participation in the National British Judo Championship. There, he got the chance to watch an aikido demonstration given by Abe Tadashi Sensei, who was the representative of the Aikikai in France.\n\nWe were very impressed by aikido but we wondered if it was real.Ken Cottier interviewed by Frank Burlingham in 1999\n\nShortly after, a small group of people including Terry Ezra asked if they could use a corner of the Birkenhead dojo to practice moves from a book. Eventually, they invited Kenneth Williams from London, a second dan who was just about the highest grade in the country, and some of the judoka decided to support the event and joined in.\n\nCottier then got the opportunity to study more formally during the judo instructor’s course that he attended in London in 1961. Abe Kenshiro Sensei had studied with Ueshiba Morihei Sensei and was a 6th dan. He gave Cottier and the other trainees an aikido class every Thursday. This sparked some interest in Cottier and when he returned home, he joined Terry Ezra’s study group. Cottier also attended seminars led by early British aikido students of Abe Kenshiro Sensei such as Ken Williams and Henry Ellis.\n\nI particularly liked the atmosphere on the mat, the cooperation between everybody, and the smooth circular movements.Ken Cottier interviewed by Frank Burlingham in 1999\n\nTravel to Japan\n\nIn 1962, Cottier saw an announcement in the British Judo Association Magazine which said that judo would become part of the Olympics Games for the first time during the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. For the occasion, the British Judo Association was arranging flights and accommodations for three weeks for its members for the sum of £160 (~2800 US dollars nowadays). Considering that it would be his only chance to ever get back to Japan, he and two friends, Fred Wainwright and Brian Mowel managed to save the they £25 needed for the deposit, and they worked every single day in order to earn the rest of the money prior to the trip.\n\nUnfortunately, problems with organization led to a cancellation of the flights that Cottier and his friends had plan to take, forcing them to find alternative travel arrangements, by rail, via the Trans-Siberian. For three young men from working class backgrounds with limited means, the fact that this journey happened at all was a real achievement in itself. In their enthusiasm though, the extent of their planning limited to the sole purchase of their onward tickets to Japan, for they did not consider their return tickets, nor their accommodation in Tokyo.\n\nUpon arrival in Japan, they quickly made their way to Kyoto to visit Abe Kenshiro Sensei, who had relocated to Japan a few months ahead of the Olympics.\n\nAfter taking us to a few famous shrines and temples, Abe Sensei used his favorite English word, “necessary”. He always said “necessary this” and “necessary that”, and in this case it was “necessary eat sushi”. It was the most difficult meal I have ever had. I remember keeping something in my mouth for a very long time in fear of what would happen if I were to swallow it. Sitting facing Sensei also did not help. I am happy to say that sushi is now one of my favorite foods.Ruddock, Alan - Tales from the Life of Kenneth George Edward Cottier\n\nAbe told Cottier that he should go and meet O Sensei and focus on practicing aikido. Cottier obeyed and even though he had registered formally at the Kodokan, he never went to train there.\n\nAbe Sensei said I should go see O Sensei and practice Aikido. Maybe he thought I was hopeless at Judo anyway and was glad to get rid of me, I don’t know. I did join the Kodokan; I still have my membership card, the Mecca of Judo with Jigoro Kano’s big statue outside. I didn’t practice there but I did join.Ken Cottier interviewed by Frank Burlingham in 1999\n\nCottier actually sustained a knee injury while practicing in the United Kingdom and to some extent, he felt that moving away from judo might preserve his physical condition. Cottier would in fact later confide to Shane Riley, one of his close students, that he was also somewhat deterred by the fact that most foreigners were considered as “cannon fodder” and that they tended to be kept away from the high ranking Kodokan instructors.\n\nMeeting O Sensei\n\nCottier and his friends entered the Aikikai Hombu Dojo on a cold Monday evening in 1964. They were ushered in, told to remove their shoes, and led to the dojo to watch Saito Morihiro Sensei’s class. All of a sudden, someone clapped and O Sensei was at the center of the dojo.\n\nMy immediate thought on seeing the founder for the first time was, “Why is there this priest here?”Ruddock, Alan - Tales from the Life of Kenneth George Edward Cottier\n\nO Sensei spoke for a few minutes, demonstrated a few techniques, and then left.\n\nO sensei radiated warmth, smiled at times, and spoke to one or two individually. I likened what I was seeing to a grandfather chatting away to his grandchildren. Much to my delight he then started teaching his aikido. I could not believe that a man of 81 could display such coordination, could react so quickly, and yet maintain such a solid posture. [...] Suddenly and unexpectedly he drew his fan from his belt at the same time letting forth a very powerful shout which completely stunned me. I found myself trembling all over and unable to control it. I do not know why O Sensei's voice had such an effect on me. I only know that it was a remarkable experience which I will never forget.Ruddock, Alan - Tales from the Life of Kenneth George Edward Cottier\n\nCottier was so impressed that he decided to register immediately. He attended many classes of O sensei and even though he was never formally called to take ukemi, Cottier was thrown by O Sensei on multiple occasions during classes.\n\nO Sensei taught the 6:30am class. That was one class I rarely missed — even though it took me an hour to get to the dojo from my flat.Ken Cottier interviewed by Frank Burlingham in 1999\n\nOf course, Cottier also attended classes with many of the other Hombu teachers.\n\nThe monthly training fee was 1000 yen. For this one was permitted to take five classes a day. This was surprisingly cheap. Senior teachers at that time were Ueshiba Kisshomaru Sensei, Osawa Sensei, Okumura Sensei, Yamaguchi Sensei and Arikawa Sensei. Teachers who had already been dispatched to various countries were Tada Sensei in Italy, Tamurai Sensei in France, Asai Sensei in Germany, and Yamada Sensei and Kanai Sensei in America.Ruddock, Alan - Tales from the Life of Kenneth George Edward Cottier\n\nArikawa having a fierce reputation, his class were relatively less attended than that of other teachers. Injuries were frequent and even though Cottier thought highly of Arikawa Sensei’s technique and made a point of attending his classes, it did take him a good deal of courage. Interestingly, it is during one of Arikawa Sensei’s classes that Cottier met Chiba Kazuo Sensei for the first time.\n\nBy contrast, Cottier also particularly enjoyed the atmosphere of the 8 am classes led by Osawa Kisaburo, four times a week. Between late 1964 and early 1965, Tohei Koichi was in America, so Osawa Sensei, who was 8th Dan, was the senior instructor at Hombu. Cottier often referred to Osawa Sensei as a kind uncle that everyone liked.\n\nAfter taking Osawa Sensei’s class one morning, I boarded the number 13 streetcar. As we moved off I felt a slight tap on my shoulder. Spinning around I found myself face to face with Osawa Sensei who was offering me a tram ticket. I tried to say ‘domo arigato gozaimashita’ and fumbled for a coin with which to pay him. He just frowned and shook his head, and then smiled. As I am sure that he perceived my extreme embarrassment and we stood side by side for the remainder of the journey without speaking. I really wanted to tell him how much his gesture meant to me, and to ask him a hundred questions about the founder, aikido, the problems I was having with my practice, and so on. As we reached the terminal he gave me a big smile, raised his hand and went on his way. Of course this was his way of saying “I know you, I know you always attend my classes”. His kindness really meant a lot to me.Ruddock, Alan - Tales from the Life of Kenneth George Edward Cottier\n\nWhen Cottier’s friends returned to England after two months, he became the only Englishman at Hombu. There were about 12 foreigners who were regularly training at Hombu during his first stay and he became friends with all of them. Those included Americans Terry Dobson, Virginia Mayhew, George Willard, Bob Frager, Bob Nadeau, Norman Miles, Joanne Shimamoto (who went on to marry the late Tohei Akira Sensei). There was also Henry Kono from Canada, and Alan Ruddock from Ireland. They met both on and off the mat and helped each other with everyday life. For instance, Virginia Mayhew gave Cottier some guitar classes.\n\nAs there were so few of us we were a close group that watched out for each other, for example, if one of us did not show up in the Dojo for a few days, someone would check that all was well with him or her. I remember Alan Ruddock once checking on me for this very reason and thinking at the time how very nice it was to feel part of the group.Ruddock, Alan - Tales from the Life of Kenneth George Edward Cottier\n\nCottier being the only Englishman and Ruddock the only Irishman, they became particularly close friends. In fact, it is Cottier who helped Ruddock’s relocation to Japan in 1966 by writing on behalf of the Hombu Dojo to the Japanese embassy in Ireland, hence helping Ruddock secure a cultural visa specifically to practice aikido. Cottier also went to welcome Ruddock when he disembarked in the port of Yokohama.\n\nCottier was known in the dojo as a very funny man who often made jokes. He was also very keen to tell stories, including this rather embarrassing one:\n\nOne morning between the 6.30 and 8 o'clock class I wanted to use the toilet, so I entered one of the cubicles. I was in there when someone knocked on the door somewhat impatiently, so said: \"yes, alright\", then a few seconds later there was another knock even more firmly and louder, I said \"yes!\". I thought that that person must be in a hurry so I said: \"yes, yes well alright!\" quite strongly. When I opened the door, I realized with horror that it was O Sensei. He just glared at me because apparently that was his toilet which nobody else used! (laughs)Ken Cottier interviewed by Frank Burlingham in 1999\n\nLike many other foreigners, Ken Cottier enthusiastically followed the classes of Tohei Koichi Sensei when he returned from the USA. Tohei was one of the only teachers at Hombu who could speak English and he also attended his classes in Iidabashi.\n\nThe group also had privileged access to O Sensei since he was still living in the dojo at the time. On one occasion, the group decided to bake a cake to celebrate O Sensei’s birthday and to bring it to him.\n\nJoanne Shimamoto asked me if I wanted to be part of O Sensei’s birthday, I asked when it was and she said “December 14th. I said “oh, same day as me”, but I don’t think she believed me! (laughs)Ken Cottier interviewed by Frank Burlingham in 1999\n\nO Sensei insisted that the student stay at his home to eat the cake with them. The group spent some time enjoying tea and cake, while Henry Kono took this rare opportunity to ask O Sensei questions directly, which would have been highly unusual under normal circumstances. Due to the inclement weather, it was decided that the formal picture should be taken in the dojo.\n\nA class was in progress, but as it was customary when O Sensei set foot in the dojo, all dropped to their knees. Needless to say, of all my photographs this is my most treasured. I hope that all who appear in it are still in Aikido and will see it, and that it will bring back happy memories to them.Kenneth Cottier - O Sensei and the Old Dojo. Aikido Shinbun, Fall 1974\n\nCottier stayed in Japan on a succession of cultural visas, which he renewed every 180 days. He made a living teaching English conversation at several schools as well as privately. He also taught a number of aikido practitioners. His good humor allowed him to make a number of Japanese friends, including Kitaura Yasunari, who now teaches in Spain. Most of his time was spent training and at the time, students were allowed to stay at the dojo between classes to continue practicing.\n\nOne morning, George Willard and I were the only ones left in the dojo after the morning classes. Because of George’s strong grip I could not move him. Unknown to us, O Sensei was watching us through the office window. Suddenly the door opened and he was in the dojo, we of course, immediately sat in seiza. He invited George to take hold of him, George, out of respect, did not use his full power, O Sensei, sensing this, let George clearly know that he wanted him to grab strongly the way he had grabbed me. What he did was simply aim a punch at George’s face. He then turned to me, gave me a look that said, did you get the message? Then he walked across the dojo into his house.Ruddock, Alan - Tales from the Life of Kenneth George Edward Cottier\n\nCottier took his shodan examination in front of Ueshiba Kisshomaru in December 1965.\n\nOther experiences\n\nWhile in Japan, Cottier also practiced Shotokan Karate at the Japan Karate Association Honbu Dojo. He also met and trained with Hatsumi Masaaki Sensei, the founder of Bunjinkan.\n\nIn spite of wanting to stay in Japan, Cottier had to return to England in March 1967 in order to care for his mother who had fallen ill. He remained in England for two years and kept practicing aikido, including during seminars under Chiba Kazuo Sensei, who had moved to England as a representative of the Aikikai in 1966.\n\nSecond trip to Japan\n\nEager to meet O Sensei again, Cottier left England once again, this time by passenger liner, on April 18th, 1969. His second stay would be very different from the first one. During the trip, he received a letter sent at one of the ports by Joanne Shimamoto to inform him that O Sensei had passed away on April 26th.\n\nI can remember leaning on the handrail of the ship, crying to myself.Ken Cottier interviewed by Frank Burlingham in 1999\n\nOn his way to Tokyo, Cottier stopped by Hong Kong. Alan Ruddock, who had assisted Virginia Mayhew with introducing aikido in Hong Kong, had given Cottier the contact of a man, Mr. Charles Tie, and arranged for the two of them to meet for dinner. Tie explained to Cottier that following Mayhew’s departure, they had been unable to secure the dispatch of an instructor from Japan and that the dojo was in limbo. He asked Cottier if he could take over where Mayhew left. Cottier, who was set to return to Japan, politely declined, but he agreed to travel to Hong Kong from Tokyo every now and then to help. Cottier continued on his journey and he arrived in Tokyo on June 10th, 1969. He never heard from Tie again.\n\nA year later, a letter arrived to Hombu from Hong Kong from someone called Leonard Leung. It said that Fujita Masataki Sensei had recently visited Hong Kong and given an impromptu class. During that time, the Hong Kong students had asked about Cottier and Fujita Sensei told them that he was indeed in Tokyo and that they should inquire to Hombu about him.\n\nRestarting aikido in Hong Kong\n\nKen Cottier returned to Hong Kong in May 1971 as a 3rd dan and an official representative of Hombu.\n\nHe set up the Hong Kong Aikido Association with the help of Leonard Leung and his brother George.\n\nThese people had trained under Virgina Mayhew so as soon as I got there, I graded two of them to 2nd kyu. They were well worth the 2nd kyu, they had trained a lot.Ken Cottier interviewed by Frank Burlingham in 1999\n\nCottier and the Lung brothers rented a flat on Ho Man Tin Street, Kowloon. They knocked down the walls in order to allow sufficient space to set up a training area. The first evening class he gave was attended by 18 people.\n\nWe were living in a standard flat where tradesmen or people outside of Aikido lived. On seeing a dojo with O Sensei’s picture, a matted floor, bokken, jo, and other stuff I had acquired, rather than tables, chairs, and the likes, they were quite surprised. Some would ask me many questions, they wondered: ‘What the hell is going on here?’Ruddock, Alan - Tales from the Life of Kenneth George Edward Cottier\n\nFujita Sensei returned to Hong Kong as part of a trip in Southeast Asia. He wrote an article about his trip in the October 1971 issue of the Aikido Shinbun and reported about Cottier’s successful efforts to develop aikido in Hong Kong.\n\nDuring his two visits to Japan, Mr. Cottier devoted himself to training at the Hombu Dojo. He was a disciple of Kazuo Chiba 6th dan, of the British Aikikai. He is active in Japan and currently has a dojo in Kowloon, Hong Kong. He is doing his best as the leader of the Hong Kong Aikikai. Other martial arts are also popular in Hong Kong, and the number of members of the Hong Kong Aikikai has increased remarkably.Masatake Fujita - Aikido of Southeast Asia - October 1971 issue of the Aikido Shinbun\n\nCottier and his students actively promoted aikido via newspaper articles as well as participation in TV shows.\n\nIn its March 1972 issue, Black Belt Magazine carried an article about Cottier titled \"A Japanese Oddity: Englishman Teaches Japanese Art to Chinese\".\n\nBefore returning to Japan in September 1972, Cottier promoted Leonard Leung and his brother to shodan. He was confident that from then on, Hong Kong aikido could survive under those two dedicated instructors. Though no longer living in Hong Kong, Ken Cottier remained involved with Hong Kong aikido throughout his life and quite significantly, he never opened a dojo anywhere else.\n\nReturn to Japan\n\nBack in Japan, Cottier continued to train at the Aikikai Hombu Dojo, though his knee problems forced him to change his technique towards less movement, and to take prolonged periods of rest from training, though even during those times, he did make a point to come to the dojo for mitori geiko.\n\nIn Aikido, we don’t wear stripes on our belts - and I hope we never do. So were the people I was watching first dan or sixth dan? I used to try to grade people by watching their shoulders. My thought is that the higher grade, the less movement there is in the shoulders. If the shoulders are down, everything is down.Ken Cottier interviewed by Frank Burlingham in 1999\n\nHe was still a pillar of the foreigners community in Hombu, which had obviously grown larger with time.\n\nCottier made trips twice a year to Hong Kong to conduct seminars and examinations. Doshu actually visited the Hong Kong Aikido Association during a trip to Southeast Asia, further establishing the reputation of the group.\n\nIt was a very great honor for Hong Kong to have the Doshu visit us. In Hong Kong there is a great mixture of martial arts, and there is friction between many of them. I’m very happy that there is only one school of Aikido in Hong Kong, and that’s O Sensei’s Aikido.Ken Cottier - Roundtable discussion with Doshu\n\nCottier was promoted to 4th dan in January 1977.\n\nActivities around the world\n\nCottier returned to England in 1981 but did not get involved with British aikido for a couple of years. He returned to Hong Kong in 1988 to spend a year there.\n\nCottier also traveled to South Africa several times. He was invited for the first time by Christopher Smart, an Englishman who had spent seven years at Hombu Dojo and settled in South Africa in 1981. When Smart left South Africa in 1984, Cottier was asked to conduct a winter aikido school, which was held in July. He spent a month in Pretoria and was invited back two years later for seven months, and then again in 1989 for one and a half years. So he spent over two years in South Africa. He taught classes and seminars in Cape town as well as other cities and promoted a number of students to dan grades.\n\nCottier also traveled to Singapore a number of times and actively supported aikido practice there, as well as to the Philippines as an envoy of Hombu to validate the application of two local groups for recognition by the Aikikai.\n\nHe returned to Hong Kong in 1991 to plan for the 20th anniversary of the Hong Kong aikido Association held in August 1991, which would be attended by then Dojo-cho, Ueshiba Moriteru. Cottier intended to spend about nine months there but he ended up staying for six and a half years, ending with the planning of the 25th anniversary.\n\nCottier left Hong Kong for good at the time of the handover of Hong Kong to China, though he said that his departure was not linked to this event. He established his permanent residence in Chester, near Liverpool and continued to teach seminars in England and abroad. I met him around 2003 during one of those seminars in Liverpool.\n\nMemory of my encounter with Ken Cottier\n\nAlan Ruddock was my teacher for several years and he often spoke about Ken. One day, I told him that I was going to attend one of Ken’s seminars in England but his reaction surprised me. He said that he was happy that I would get to meet his friend, but he also gave me the following warning:\n\nBe very careful when taking ukemi for Ken, you need to be aware that he might hurt you.Alan Ruddock when talking to me about attendind a seminar with Ken Cottier\n\nI went to the seminar and found Cottier Sensei’s way of speaking and carrying himself to be very gentle. I distinctly remember that he exhibited no unnecessary formality or ego, which is a quality that Alan and Henry also shared. However, while on the mat, I was surprised to see that his aikido was in contrast very strong and direct, some may say “rough”. I took Alan’s advice and held back a bit on my ukemi, and everything went very well. I wrote to Alan later to tell him that I had survived the encounter with his friend!\n\nCottier served the International Aikido Federation as Senior Member and as Directing Committee member. He was also a Senior Member at the British Aikido Federation.\n\nWell, we became good friends after that and Ken used to send me audiotapes. He did not like writing letters and was never an Internet fan. Those tapes are full of stories, for which Ken was famous. Ken would start to tell me something about a serious issue involving the IAF, or aikido, or whatever, and incidentally would mention some shihan in the Hombu. There would then be a long interlude full of stories about the shihan, or whatever, after which Ken would ruefully resume his thread until the mention of another shihan he knew…\n\nPeter Goldsbrury, former chairman of the International Aikido Federation\n\nHe was awarded the title of shihan by the Aikikai on January 13th, 2002 and he was promoted to the grade of 7th dan during the Kagamibiraki 2007.\n\nKenneth Cottier passed away on June 8th, 2008. He had been diagnosed with lung cancer and was staying in a hospital in Clatterbridge in Cheshire, England, near his home. He never married but had many friends and was very close to his family."
