My colleagues Ayako Kano and Linda Chance helped me think through what a book about ukiyo-e, rather than the book about ukiyo-e, could do, and I thank them for their support in this and so many other projects. I am grateful to my many teachers, particularly Kobayashi Tadashi, Paul Berry, Peter Parshall, and Jerome Silbergeld, and the students, colleagues, collectors, curators, museum visitors, friends, and family who have shared my fascination with these prints, paintings, and illustrated books. A grant from the Metropolitan Center for Far Eastern Art Studies and funding from Penn’s University Research Foundation and the Department of the History of Art Lenkin Fund provided support for the production of this book, for which I offer sincere thanks. The colleagues, students, and undauntable staff of the History of Art Department likewise supported this work, making it stronger. I have benefited from discussions with colleagues in East Asian Languages and Civilizations, the Penn Forum on Japan, the Center for East Asian Studies, and the Workshop on Material Texts. The Wolf Humanities Center’s year of “Stuff ” in 2018–2019 (for which it was my privilege to be topic director) helped me to think beyond matter (and why it matters) in important and long-lasting ways. The annual Penn faculty weeklong summer writing retreat, sponsored by the School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Education, along with unofficial pop-up retreats during other breaks, offered much-needed space and support. Colleagues in Japan, including Asano Shūgō, Fujisawa Akane, Fujisawa Murasaki, Matsumura Masako, Naitō Masato, Oikawa Shigeru,\n\nxv\n\nOzawa Hiromu, Shindō Shigeru, and many others, have taught me much over many years, and I am grateful for their insights. Colleagues from around the world, including Frank Chance, John Carpenter, Tim Clark, Matthi Forrer, Sherry Fowler, Janice Katz, Roger Keyes, Inge Klompmakers, Angus Lockyer, Shirley Luber, Catriona MacLeod, Andreas Marks, Amy Newland, Gene Phillips, Morgan Pitelka, Tim Screech, Cecilia Segawa Seigle, Ann Sherif, Juliet Sperling, Amy Stanley, Gennifer Weisenfeld, and Stephen Whiteman, among many others, offered timely remarks and served as models of exemplary scholarship. Roger Chartier, Peter Kornicki, Suzuki Jun, Laura Moretti, Michael Suarez, Ellis Tinios, and, most of all, Peter Stallybrass fundamentally changed the way I think about books. I offer thanks to Quintana Heathman, Jeannie Kenmotsu, and Erin Schoneveld for bouncing ideas back throughout this process and to Jalen Chang for kindly checking the final draft. At the Center for Asian and Transcultural Studies at the University of Heidelberg, I sincerely thank Melanie Trede, Radu Leca, Katharina Rode, Shupin Lang, Annelie Schmidt, and an inspiring group of students. Students at Oberlin, Penn, and Rare Book School have shared so much in our conversations around things ukiyo-e. Thanks, too, to the anonymous reviewers for the press for their useful feedback and support of this project. Shirley and Marilyn Luber’s gift of the Gilbert Luber collection of reference materials on Japanese prints has transformed our library holdings, and their remarkable gift has led to other remarkable gifts. Many works featured in this book came to the University of Pennsylvania Libraries from donors Arthur Tress, Ann and Don McPhail, Tom Musco and Deborah D’Amico, and Cecilia Segawa Seigle. Thanks to their generosity, we can now teach from real things, giving students and teachers the opportunity to look more closely and to think through contexts and histories. Thank you so much for transforming what we can do together. I am grateful to colleagues at the Penn Libraries and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA) for the opportunity to work with prints and illustrated books in their collections. At the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts at the University\n\nxvi\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nof Pennsylvania Libraries, special thanks go to Elizabeth Bates, Lynne Farrington, Will Noel, Jackie Parascandola, John Pollack, and Sean Quimby. Thanks, too, to our wonderful East Asian area studies team, Molly des Jardin, Rebecca Mendelson, Eri Mizukane, Mike Williams, and Brian Vivier. Naoko Adachi and Tim Zhang gave time and expertise in organizing the new collections. I am grateful to colleagues at the PMA, Shelley Langdale, John Ittman, Louis Marchesano, and Innis Shoemaker, for our work together on Japanese prints. Many prints, paintings, and illustrated books included in these pages were first encountered in work for exhibitions, catalogues, and collection development. I thank Michel Maucuer and Asano Shūgō for the chance to contribute to catalogues for the Musée Cernuschi and the Abeno Harukas Art Museum, respectively. At the Freer and Sackler Galleries, I had the good fortune to work on the Pulverer Collection online catalogue thanks to Jim Ulak, Nancy Micklewright, and Ann Yonemura, among others. I am grateful to have learned so much from Alessandro Bianchi through our collaboration. I am grateful, too, for the care, humor, and support of the Stockwell, Davis, and Vogland families throughout this and other endeavors. Thanks go to Camille for inspiring me to think more about books as well as to be braver and bolder on so many other fronts. To our basenjis, thank you for leaning in and leaning back. Most of all, thank you, Ray, for being my partner in all things, making this life both possible and wonderful. Of course, any errors are mine.\n\nAcknowledgments xvii\n\nIntroduction Japanese prints were used as packing material around ceramics. It wasn’t until the Impressionists discovered them that they came to be seen as art. — overheard at a museum exhibition\n\nI have often been asked if it is true that Japanese prints received so little appreciation in their home country that they were used as packing material to wrap ceramics or other goods for export. Usually, the question expresses disbelief: How could people do this to such marvelous things? For years I replied that I had never seen evidence of prints having been used in such a way, and I doubted it could be so.1 Prints were exported and sold to European collectors as works of art long before the Impressionists came on the scene, and it is quite clear from period evidence that people in Japan saw these prints as “art” centuries earlier. It has always seemed to me to be a myth. Yet it is so persistently and perennially invoked that I began to wonder: Where did it come from? This myth of prints as packing material probably originates in a misunderstanding of an event that in turn may have been mis­ remembered.2 The most likely source for the idea can be traced to this sentence written by Léonce Bénédite (1859–1925): “En raison de sa matière souple et élastique, il avait servi à caler des porcelaines expédiées par\n\n1\n\ndes Français établis au Japon” (Because of its supple and flexible nature, it [a Japanese illustrated book] was used by the French working in Japan to wedge the shipped porcelains).3 Three points are worth noting here: the object included with the ceramics is an illustrated book, not a print; it was wedged into the box, not used for wrapping; and the people doing the packing were French exporters, not Japanese dealers. The book may have been used to fill a gap, but this case likely alludes to something else: the French exporters probably added the little book as a gift for a good customer. This tale of the little book that arrived with a case of ceramics was published in 1905. By then the story was nearly fifty years old and heard secondhand. Bénédite was recounting what artist Félix Bracque­ mond (1833–1914) told him about a visit he made to the printer Auguste Delâtre’s studio in 1859.4 The book in question was a volume from Hokusai’s Manga series. Art historian Toshio Watanabe notes that French merchants were established in Yokohama by 1859 and thus could have included the Hokusai volume in a shipment of ceramics. Watanabe also adds that prints and books like these were available and on sale in Paris as early as 1861.5 But if prints were not used in Japan for wrapping and packing, how were they used? In reply to this frequently asked question, many of us in the field propose that they were used just like posters, advertisements, flyers, and other ephemeral material, and thus we naturalize these things as everyday items. We often use pictures showing people looking at prints to illustrate this use. Yet asserting this based upon other images or proposing their use in a fashion parallel to our own does not offer enough evidence to make that claim stand. Let’s shift the question to ask, instead: How do we know how they were used? And how do we know how were they valued, if indeed they were? To answer these questions, we should ask related ones: How were they made, who was their audience, and who profited from them (and how)? These are complex and challenging questions, with answers that vary due to time, place, subject, and other matters. They also require us to examine disparate sources for data, from official records to popular texts, and to look at the works we are studying with attention to what they can reveal. This set\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nof inquiries has also helped me to define the parameters of this book. My purpose is to do more than write an overview of ukiyo-e, these “pictures of the floating world”: it is rather a concise and critical inquiry into the genre’s formation, history, production, and reception in early modern Japan. Thus, as we look at ukiyo-e as pictures, we will also put them into the larger context of the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, gleaning answers from the works themselves as well as from related source material. (And I will stress here that this is an introduction, not the introduction to the topic and, while based on long study in the field, cannot be definitive. There is always more to say.) Ukiyo-e things were appreciated in their own time, collected, and put into albums and boxes. Yet there is no denying that their status as commodities—as stuff if you will—shifted dramatically in the second half of the nineteenth century. Vast numbers were exported for the international market, sent by astute dealers at a time when “things Japanese” achieved high prices unknown at home. Clever forgers also had a field day, and just how fakes were made—and just how many—remains an open and contentious question. These dealers’ opportunities were facilitated by efforts to promote Japan as a nation within a larger geopolitical competition that started in the later nineteenth century, a time when the Meiji government (1868–1911) recognized the value of mobilizing “art” as part of a larger, coordinated strategy of soft power. Where these works of art are owned, who owns them, and how those works were acquired is neither accidental nor neutral; art, like other valuable commodities, is made, traded, and stolen for profit. And the market for these pictures remains strong: in 2016 a single-sheet print by Utamaro set a new record at auction when it sold for €745,000 ($841,000).6 The mobility of and long-lasting engagement with these images is also worth consideration. Some have achieved the status of international icons. Hokusai’s “The Great Wave” is without a doubt the most recognized work of Japanese art worldwide; it is also one of the most imitated, adapted, and satirized images of the modern era (figure 1). Rightly so, we might say, for it is one of the most dynamic and thrilling images from the period. But, as Christine Guth has demonstrated\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nFigure 1. Katsushika Hokusai, Under the Wave off Kanagawa (Kanagawa oki nami ura), from\n\nThirty-­Six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjūrokkei), ca. 1831; published by Nishimuraya Yohachi.

Havemeyer, 1929 (JP1847), Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nin her book on the global reception of “The Great Wave,” its modern status is the product of a history of appreciation over time, one with its own merits, risks, and stakeholders.7 The title that appears on this print is not in fact “The Great Wave.” Rather, it is Under the Wave off Kanagawa (Kanagawa oki nami ura), and the title further indicates that it was part of the series Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjūrokkei). This project of thirty-six compositions proved so popular that the publisher and artist extended the set by ten more views, for a total of forty-six designs (without changing the title, however). Clearly, Under the Wave off Kanagawa was intended from the start to be part of an extended study of the mountain, not a stand-alone image. Yet it has\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nbeen so acclaimed that it is now seen more often separately than as part of the group. As a single image, it is thus out of its intended context, no longer part of an extended variation on a theme. What makes its status as a global icon even more peculiar is that it has not been the preferred image from the group in Japan. That honor goes to the print often called “Red Fuji” (figure 2).8 Why these two images are preferred above all others in these different contexts is due to various selections made by various individuals over time. But this preference may also rest, in part, on how the images are perceived. How we look at images—and what they show us as we do so—is culturally constructed. “The Great Wave” evokes entirely different responses depending upon how we look at it.\n\nFigure 2.

It is the graphic power of this immense breaking wave that captures the imagination (no wonder that it has become the emoji for surfing). We are swept up and over the curve of the blue striped wave into the jazzy pattern of curling foam. We see these forms as abstract elements, arc upon arc, a sequence of spirals, set against the stable pyramidal form of Mount Fuji on the horizon. But if we look at this image from right to left, as it would have been seen in its own time (as well as by many viewers in its home country today), our eyes start scanning at the upper-right corner and move to the lower left. This habit of looking derives from practices of reading and writing in East Asia, where texts are written starting at the upper right, and characters line up to form a vertical column reaching the bottom of the page, with columns of text stacking in vertical lines from right to left. (Imagine turning this page ninety degrees; the line on the bottom of this page becomes a vertical line, and you would start reading at the top right, go down the line, then proceed to the next column, moving by columns across to the left side.) Reading and writing from the upper right down the page and across in a leftward fashion (often abbreviated as top to bottom, right to left) was standard in Hokusai’s time, and he would have expected his audience to view the picture from the top right to the lower left. Today Japanese texts are often laid out following this traditional presentation—top to bottom, right to left—as are images. But in the modern era, Japanese texts are also set in the same way—horizontal lines laid down one below the other, left to right, top to bottom—and modern images might also be composed in this “Western” fashion. Readers today can seamlessly code-switch from one direction to another, one of many negotiations of practice that is part of daily life in Japan. Turning back to Under the Wave off Kanagawa and looking at it again, now using the top-to-bottom, right-to-left method that Hokusai’s viewers would have used, we begin with the swelling form of the\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nnext wave and slide with the boat full of men crouching in the hull down into the valley between the waves. Our point of view is under the cresting wave, its mass of energy rising above us. The crab claw tendrils of the spilling breaker reach toward our fragile craft, and we shrink under its impending peril; we see that the boat leeward of us might also be consumed by a smaller wave swelling like a mountain of water. (Note Hokusai’s deliberate compositional parallel between this smaller wave and the mountain itself.) Our boats might slip through the waves if our crew is skillful enough. Behind us, Mount Fuji is a secure, eternal presence, but its solid ground is too distant, now more memory than presence. Little wonder this image has also been adapted to serve as the international warning sign for high waves. Thus, these two modes of viewing demonstrate how a single image may produce entirely different reactions: one of admiration, a sublime frisson, at the wave that rips and curls, the other of terror at the power of the sea and the possibility of total destruction. With this understanding of how cultural differences have trained our eyes to “read” an image, let us turn to what has been the more preferred image from the series in Japan, known by its nickname of “Red Fuji.” Here, the trajectory of the eye across the image follows a similar pattern of sweep and fall, depending on where you start looking. The right-to-left viewer immediately confronts the hard surface of the mountain, visually running into the form. The mountain rises rapidly and soon crests, then descends on a long arc, turning from volcanic to forested terrain. By cropping the conical form dramatically on the right and layering horizontal mackerel clouds in a circle around the peak, with the pines in a parallel cresting pattern, Hokusai counterbalances arc and triangle, circle and rectangle. This is the mountain in Fine Wind, Clear Weather, as the cartouche reading Gaifū kaisei can be translated, and the printer’s art of subtle gradation of color and the carver’s retention of wood grain to suggest a rocky texture acknowledge the print as print, emphasizing its materiality. This is a mountain standing in majesty over its surrounding plain. Reading from the opposite direction, from left to right, the mountain form rises gradually to its apex and then drops off dramatically.\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nThe mountain is ever solid, the clouds and coloration a series of horizontal elements. Geometry, shading, and texture all remain present, but the mountain’s slow rise is less dramatic, less precipitous, and, dare I say, less inspiring, when read along this slower left-to-right trajectory. The experience of viewing, the pattern of crest and fall, is mirrored in these two images, the immediacy of the cresting wave seen from the left a compositional reflection of the right-read cresting mountain. Without entering into the complicated world of how the eye and brain perceive and respond to images, what is evident from eye-tracking studies is that each image excites a different mode of visual perception depending upon how one reads it.9 Perhaps it should not be so surprising, then, that each image has become iconic in these different realms. For the cooperatively conceived Hokusai exhibitions held at the British Museum and the Abeno Harukas Museum in 2017, these two works established key terms: London’s title, Beyond the Great Wave, was counterposed by Osaka’s Beyond Fuji. The titles reveal an awareness that the iconicity of each image is the product of a long history of modern appreciation and that each retains the power to bring in the crowds. But in context, in the early 1830s when both prints were produced, neither was designed to aspire to or achieve the status of individual icon. Neither was singled out for acclaim for its singularity and visual provocation nor repeatedly imitated, parodied, or cited in the manner that demonstrates appreciation in this genre. Rather, both were part of a larger project that, along with the other forty-four designs, was an extended rumination on the mountain—stanzas in an epic poem. Both were part of a larger context of what had, by then, become the genre of ukiyo-e, or the “pictures of the floating world.” The genre is often described as composed of prints that represent the entertainments and diversions of early modern Japan. In this line of discussion, the earliest known use of the term “ukiyo” for floating world is brought out as evidence of an ethos held by people “living only for the moment, like a gourd floating on a stream.”10 Works by ukiyo-e’s acclaimed masters—Hokusai, Sharaku, Hiroshige, and Utamaro, among others— are marshaled to support the claim that the genre expressed an attitude\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nof delighting in temporary, transient escapes from reality. The fact that many ukiyo-e prints were produced in high numbers and sold at low prices is further used to emphasize the genre’s popularity. While ukiyo-e was often trendy, timely, and diverting, generalities like these can sometimes limit deeper understanding of this vibrant field. Prints were one of the genre’s most successful forms—and many of these were cheap and meant for widespread sale—but ukiyo-e also included a range of other materials, including paintings, illustrated books, broadsheets, high-end custom prints, and more. Many sheet prints and illustrated books, particularly those showing famous places and people, were marketed in tandem with popular entertainments and diversions. Others were private, expensive commissions of the highest quality for more discerning tastes. Many of these might have been mere stuff, but this was stuff made, bought, sold, and traded in high numbers for pleasure and profit. The number of images that remain today—and the extant writings about them—demonstrates that paintings and printed matter were regarded as worthy of display, collection, and discussion in their own time. These works were thus part of a more varied and complex artistic world— where some works were made for a commercial market, backed by savvy entrepreneurs seeking new ways to make a profit, while others were produced for private coteries and high-ranking individuals seeking cultural capital—in early modern Japan. Most modern scholarship about ukiyo-e has focused upon sheet prints, thus limiting further understanding of the wide array of things made at the time. By comparison to other fields in Japanese art history, both in Japan and beyond its borders, the study of ukiyo-e was for a long time taken much less seriously in the academy than were other forms of artistic practice. Part of the problem was that ukiyo-e images (especially prints) were too approachable, too plebian, too sexy, and too much fun for the kind of higher-minded study preferred by some in the academy. Closer studies were developed by curators, dealers, and collectors, often through exhibitions and catalogues. More recent trends across the field take up a more holistic approach, and, by integrating lesser-known figures as well as illustrated books and\n\nIntroduction 9\n\npaintings into the discussion, have done much to advance the field. Yet some of these still replicate long-held tropes—from the “genius artist” to the “discovery of landscape”—often for the purposes of higher attendance at exhibitions and ready sales for catalogues. But within and beyond Japan, scholarly monographs on selected figures and subjects are increasingly populating library shelves, spurred on by larger academic trends in which studies of popular culture, gender and sexuality, performance, and others have opened up new zones of discussion. The chapters that follow are organized as historical clusters in accordance with a now-established chronology. While this book is limited by design to a select number of illustrations and words, my intention from the start has been to not limit the field to sheet prints but rather to embrace the broader expanse of the genre by including paintings and illustrated books. Prints, books, and paintings were part of an extended world of representation where differences between media related to matters of patronage and audience. While studying floating-world paintings remains challenging due to issues of authenticity, as well as to provenance, materials, and artistic practices, bringing painting into the discussion is vital to understanding artistic practice and aspiration.11 Illustrated books present another case—one that has more to do with modern practices of classification. As books they are often found in the library, more often than in the museum, and thus are not always included in ways that bring them into dialogue with sheet prints and paintings. Being materially and conceptually placed between modern disciplines such as art history, bibliography, literature, and others, illustrated books have frequently been overlooked as a result. Yet both paintings and illustrated books were vital sources for commissions and forms of expression for Edo-period makers and their patrons. What becomes more challenging is where to draw the boundaries around the floating world and these pictorial practices, for like the world we live in today, the makers and consumers of these media participated in overlapping social, economic, and political networks with less clearly defined limits. The lines drawn around what we now call ukiyo-e are as artificial as those around any genre.\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nUkiyo-e in Its Own Time Most of the ukiyo-e discussed in this book were produced in the Tokugawa period (1603–1868), and while the establishment of the shogunate as the political force ruling the country and the development of the city of Edo (modern-day Tokyo) have been better described elsewhere, a few key points must be recounted here. The Tokugawa clan selected the village of Edo for its political base at the end of the sixteenth century, and following their rise to political power over the next decades, Edo experienced rapid population growth. By the latter half of the eighteenth century, its population numbered 1.3 million people (figure 3). Not only did the late-eighteenth-century census confirm that Edo was the largest city in the archipelago itself, its numbers suggest that its population exceeded that of any other reported by census in the early modern world—far exceeding its rivals in Europe.12 Edo residents profited from its flourishing mercantile economy, making, selling, trading, and buying essential goods and services—as well as things ukiyo-e. Other forms of printed matter, from scholarly books to Buddhist prints, were produced in other locations, to be sure, but Edo eventually won the battle over which city would become the center for print throughout the country. It retained that status after Edo was renamed Tokyo in 1868 and remains the publishing capital today. All floating-world products were made through collaboration and as part of a larger social and cultural art world.13 Large numbers were made as commercial works, serving to advertise entertainments such as kabuki, the pleasure quarters, sumo wrestling, restaurants, sightseeing locales, and more. Others were made as private commissions, designed as gifts, commemorations, or vanity press items. Through close analysis of the material, textual, and visual elements of prints, books, and paintings, many contributors can be identified. Signatures and seals yield names of publishers, illustrators, writers, carvers, printers, and others. Individual style can often allow us to attribute an artist’s hand when no name is included. Patrons are sometimes identified by name in these works—for example, as poets in poetry albums—but frequently they, too, can only be deduced through association or provenance records\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nFigure 3.

Rare Books and Special Collections, University of British Columbia Library.\n\n(the latter of which are admittedly rather rare). The many others, from the makers of brushes, silk, paper, ink, and pigment to the mounters, binders, distributors, dealers, and collectors, are less apparent in spite of their essential material contributions. How the broader audience for floating-world image and text responded is implied by what is visible (and, equally, what is not), and by subject matter and style as a product of taste, of what sold where and when. These makers likewise abided (or pretended to do so) by shogunal promulgations that served in effect as censorship practices. Thus, what is visible—and what may be invisible, too—are traces of many hands and minds. Yet it is the illustrator’s name that served as a kind of brand name, then as it does now, as we shall frequently see throughout the chapters that follow. In the serial The Bathhouse of the Floating World (Ukiyo-buro), begun in 1809 and continuing over thirteen years, Shikitei Sanba (1776–1822) wrote in the guise of recording what people from all professions and classes discussed in the bathhouse. In one notable passage, mothers complain that their children collect actor prints, saying, “Toyokuni’s prints are really powerful,” or “At our house everybody loves Toyokuni. We always take Toyokuni prints as presents when we go to Kansai or when we visit the master’s house.” Sanba expanded upon these mothers’ remarks (in words that seem familiar today): “Children have gotten really extravagant, the lot of them. My girl has a box full of actor prints that she bought, and my third boy buys multivolume illustrated novels (gōkan) whenever they come out. He’s collected a big box-full, too. These days children even remember the names of artists—‘I like Toyokuni’ or ‘I like Kunisada’—pretending they are so grown up!” Her companion replied: “You’re right. And to think, when we were kids all we got were those simple picture books.”14 Sanba’s report is also a little promotional: readers likely recognized that these two Utagawa school artists, Toyokuni and Kunisada, were also frequent illustrators for his texts. But this fictional account makes the point that people used the artists’ names in the same way we use them today—as markers for certain prints—and that “Toyokunis” and “Kunisadas” were known commodities.\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe skillful use of brush and ink to render an image was central to the ukiyo-e artist’s task. These illustrator-designers were trained as painters. The brush was their primary tool, its practice the foundation for their art. Nearly all were apprenticed as children or young adolescents to a more senior artist’s studio for training or serving as assistants, and for most their first images appeared as book illustrations. Establishing a separate studio was accomplished by developing a name and a market for one’s works, and this step was often achieved through close association with, and even promotion by, an influential publisher. By the later eighteenth century, being a master of the full-color print— what became known as the brocade picture (nishiki-e)­—meant having achieved a higher position in the print market than a book illustrator, and being established as a painting master (eshi) was the highest recognition of achievement. This hierarchy of practice was not dependent upon social status, but it did relate to economic success. Most ukiyo-e artists were from the merchant or artisan classes, while some were born to samurai status. All were professional artists working in exchange for payment, in kind or in cash. They were, in short, “brushes for hire.”15 Well-to-do townspeople, samurai, and even aristocrats, from within and beyond Edo, purchased ready-made works as well as requested special items from name-brand artists. The media of painting and printed works required different levels of investment. Paintings were more expensive, usually produced upon request by patrons, and were singular, unique items. Publishers typically bore the costs of printing, commissioning illustrations from these artists for sheets and books intended for reproduction. Few early drawings remain from the period; those used as sketches for prints were often destroyed in the process. Some ukiyo-e sheet prints and illustrated books show the artist at work. Most show the artist as a painter, not as a craftsman associated with the process of making prints. In these pictures of the artist at work, the painter, brush in hand, concentrates completely on the task before him, skillfully limning a marvelous image—such as a beautiful woman, a singular landscape, or a brilliant phoenix—on a sheet of paper, on a roll of silk, or even on the surface of a wall. These pictures of painters\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nserve the rhetoric of artistic skill, suggesting that the work has been conjured from an individual’s talent (and perhaps even his genius). One print even shows the painting in progress coming literally to life as the artist draws it—as though his talent is akin to magic—employing a common trope borrowed from Chinese sources.16 Images like these replicated the long-held concept of the eye, mind, and brush of the artist as the originating place of picture making. And yet there was much more to the painter’s practice, for ukiyo-e artists, like all before them and all since, worked within an art world with its own rules, obligations, aspirations, and rivalries. Perhaps it is no accident that many of these images replicating the painter’s practice are not paintings themselves but prints that served to promote the artist’s image to a wide audience, marketing him as a master painter, worthy of renown. The hierarchies of art appreciation during that time granted painting higher status than illustrating for printed media, and being known as a painter bestowed equivalent capital to the respective makers. Indeed, the terms used to describe artists—often seen in book colophons as well as in signatures on paintings and sheet prints—indicate these differences. One term frequently seen in book colophons is that of gakō (picture maker); this designation defined the illustrator according to similar terms used for craftsmen (shokunin). This was clearly a rank below that of original masters of pictures (hon’eshi), another term used in colophons and signatures. These distinctions not only signaled differences in status but also directly affected the fees an artist might command.17 Moreover, paintings, as unique objects made of high-quality materials, were intrinsically more expensive than most woodblock prints and illustrated books produced as multiples. Whether a painting was the product of a commission or sold as a “ready-made” also signified specific social and financial distinctions. Paintings were typically more elite commodities than woodblock-­ printed multiples. Through the first half of the eighteenth century, artists often produced paintings made in advance and put them on sale, but after printing began to so effectively imitate the colorful effects of painting, the cost differential between prints and paintings widened.18 Individual artists negotiated that terrain differently—for some it meant\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\nbuilding a clientele that allowed them to focus mainly on painting, while for others designing prints remained a vital part of their practice. Many also used the illustrated book as a means to disseminate designs for paintings, producing sketchbooks as well as printed albums showing their painting style. Some paintings, such as those made on a large scale or with special sumptuous effects, clearly argue for having been special commissions. While we may not yet be able to name their patrons, the fact that these would have required a large place for display—spaces like the architectural niche (tokonoma) shown in Shunshō’s painting of the daimyo mansion (discussed in chapter 2)—demonstrates that some patrons were from the political elites. Likewise, paintings made for large restaurants, elite brothels, theaters, teahouses, sumptuous parlors, and others indicate that these served as prestige objects for the floating world’s cognoscenti. Closer study of the issues in ukiyo-e painting, and to the meaning of the painting as the product of a special kind of social interaction, broadens our understanding of the “floating world,” its representation, and its distinct art world. Being known as a painter may have offered greater appreciation and social position, but names were typically and best made through the print trade. For most brushes for hire, their first printed illustration might be included in a book or even distributed as an inexpensive print. Securing an affiliation with one or more publishers willing to take the risk on a new talent would have been critical to making the transition from book to sheet print, just as securing a patron would make possible the leap to painting. Or at least that would be the most typical progress toward success. Not every named artist followed that pattern, with Sharaku being the exception that proves the rule (as we shall see). The next four chapters track the genre of ukiyo-e from its early formation into the modern era. Throughout, carefully selected and representative period documents will be brought into dialogue with images to establish the terms of appraisal used in their own time. Among these, the Ukiyo-e ruikō (Various Writing on Ukiyo-e), a manuscript text started in the late eighteenth century with additions made through the mid-nineteenth, functioned to construct the canon for its\n\nIntroduction 17\n\nperiod audience. Written by contemporary participants and critics in floating-world circles, this document offers essential facts and insider knowledge. However, like others before them, its composers were neither unbiased nor immune to the kinds of errors made by copyists; we must remain attentive throughout to the fact that its evaluations, critical terms, and biographical information cannot be taken at face value.19 Yet the specific terms used to describe types of visual art (such as “Japanese-­style painting” and “lacquer prints”) show that these practitioners developed evaluative sets of categories to describe production, famous names, innovations, and more. Two versions of this manuscript will be repeatedly employed throughout the following pages and assessed for use: the earliest extant copy, dating to 1802, and the (arguably) most well-researched version, produced in 1844.20 Put against the visual evidence as well as against other period commentaries, we can see that “ukiyo-e” was being codified in the period as a discrete genre: defined by its materials, organized into typologies, with its own emerging canon of artistic practitioners. At the same time, these critics participated in a larger discourse about cultural production and what it meant for something to attain the status of “art”—even if such a word was not yet in use—and employed terms that laid the groundwork for all later organizational frames. Their schema constructing ukiyo-e further established the hierarchy of artists, writers, and publishers still in use. These documents further made the genre and its categories seem natural, rather than constructed, although these acts of writing the canon indicate that the field of ukiyo-e was under lively debate during the period. There was a lot at stake. This canon was brought wholesale to later ukiyo-e studies. Art dealers in Japan and Europe employed its typologies and hierarchies to promote the genre to an emerging market for Japanese art in Europe and North America in the later nineteenth century. Ironically, at the same time, foreign collectors were informed that ukiyo-e was little appreciated in Japan. Their definition of ukiyo-e’s categories and contours has remained influential in defining the genre ever since. The purpose of this book is to offer a new critical introduction to ukiyo-e. Throughout, these pictures are put into various contexts.\n\n18\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhen we speak of putting a work of art into context, we often mean that we are placing it back into its larger sociohistorical sphere, relocating it in its own time. Often, we present this context as though we have seamlessly been able to achieve an understanding of that past as it plays out with the work of art under consideration. Yet to do so may gloss over the fact that we have only a partial view of that past. Like the cat peering out over the cityscape in the Hiroshige-signed print, what we see is framed like a view through a window, and it is distant, with some things brightly illuminated and others in shadow (figure 4).21 We may see, as does the cat, the silhouettes of people walking in a festival procession, but we are unlikely to be able to determine individuals’ features and expressions. Bigger things (like Mount Fuji, historical events, or important figures) seem easier to discern, as well as larger than they were in real life. Meanwhile, we may grow so intent upon looking into the past that we forget that we are in a context too. Like the cat, we may turn our backs on elements of the present that in turn are framing us. That present is not only conditioned by where we are now but also constructed by the passage of time from then to now. In the same way, this image made its way from Hiroshige’s sketch to print to publisher’s shop to buyer, making its initial journey in the context of its own time. As a print it was one of many impressions—with the potential to circulate widely—and it may have even been carried beyond the borders of Edo to share this cat’s-eye view of the vast urban plain to the provinces. Like a letter, this picture sent a message meant to be read by its viewers. Yet the life of the print did not end there. Like so much other stuff, it left Japan, traveling into an international market of dealers and buyers. It made its way into the hands of Miss Mary A. Ainsworth, Oberlin College graduate of 1889, sometime after she made her first trip to Japan in 1905. It later came to rest in Oberlin’s Allen Memorial Art Museum as part of her bequest of 1950, and there I first saw it, in a seminar with students. In its present home, the print has been appreciated by students, faculty, and visitors to the collection. It has also been exhibited, published, and compared to other impressions in other collections. In 2019 Hiroshige’s cat returned to tour Japan in exhibitions at\n\nIntroduction 19\n\nFigure 4.

Ainsworth bequest (1950.1445), Allen Memorial Art Museum.\n\nthe Chiba City Museum and the Shizuoka Museum of Art and, finally, it appears here viewed in yet another context. As a material thing, it has had a range of economic and cultural values placed upon it and accreted around it, and like a letter it has been read again and again, its meaning changing with each reader. These are among the many contexts that a single print might ask us to consider. But it has now entered yet another context as a digital image on its museum’s website. Indeed, that is where I encountered it once again, downloading it as part of a lecture to give at its present home in Ohio. The life history of Hiroshige’s cat is inflected by its journey from the past to the moment this page was printed, for nothing from the past that remains in our hands today arrived here by accident. Each iteration bears the marks of makers, producers, dealers, collectors, writers, and others—stakeholders profiting in both material and immaterial ways from its travels. Thus, throughout this book, these many contexts will affect (as well as interrupt) how we encounter these “pictures of the floating world.” More practically, since this book is intended as an introduction, the sources cited are designed to lead inquiring minds to the library, to the museum, to online resources, and elsewhere, giving privilege to accessibility (and those written in English, too). I have also chosen prints, illustrated books, and paintings often used in my teaching and have included a few I have discussed in print before—familiar old friends that have long been in service because they tell the story so well. This, of course, reflects my personal preferences, as does the approach taken throughout. The first reading of this book as a whole was for a seminar at the University of Pennsylvania. There, Hiroshige’s cat changed context once again. Together, we looked at the cat and wondered what he might see that we cannot.\n\nIntroduction 21\n\nChapter 1\n\nInventing the Pictures of the Floating World\n\nMany modern accounts of ukiyo-e begin with Hishikawa Moronobu (1618–1694), positioning him as the “father” of the genre. Starting with Moronobu for ukiyo-e studies has become so familiar that it suggests a break, a moment of transition, even of the “birth of ukiyo-e.” Placed there as the point of origination, the argument goes, Moro­nobu became “an enduring influence on all later ukiyo-e artists.”1 While Moronobu was indeed a touchstone for many that followed, how and why those practitioners chose to reference his style is more complicated, imbricated within market considerations and genre constructions in their own time. Yet this shift from genre painting ( fūzoku-e), like many other moments in history that are now marked as a radical break, did not simply occur. It is part of a larger narrative that has been constructed over time, in which ukiyo-e needed to establish such a founding figure for its chronology. Looking to early modern documents, we can see that Moronobu was put into this position by later connoisseurs and cultural figures as part of their process of constructing systems for framing, ranking, and evaluating ukiyo-e. Indeed, by the later eighteenth century, documents show that these writers were making arguments for the genre as a separate and definable area of image production and championing particular named designers. The act of writing this list of\n\n22\n\nmakers functioned to produce an early canon, if we might call it that, and was participating, too, in a longer history of writing about painting, calligraphy, and other art forms that can be traced back to early China.2 Thus, to begin this book with Moronobu as the “father” without engaging in how he was placed in that position would be to participate implicitly in a critical assessment begun long ago that continues to be reproduced for the present. To argue for the “birth” of ukiyo-e with Moronobu is, in short, to treat a moment of transition as though it were a fait accompli rather than one that was both gradual as well as defined over time by critical appraisers. Let us begin, rather, with that process of writing and ranking, seeking to understand how this articulation of the genre lays out what become critical points for ukiyo-e history. By the time samurai, critic, and cultural commentator Ōta Nanpo (1749–1823) put brush to paper to compose his catalogue of ukiyo-e practitioners in about 1790, the field of “floating-world pictures” had long been an established form of visual production, with a history that stretched back more than a century. Nanpo’s annotated list, the Studies on Ukiyo-e (Ukiyo-e kōshō), represented what he no doubt regarded as important knowledge. What appears at first to be simply a list is much more. Nanpo’s care in its composition demonstrates that he regarded ukiyo-e as a definable field of artistic production, with different forms worthy of distinction. What he could not know was that his catalogue of names would become the foundation upon which, through its many later iterations and accretions, our present canon has been built. Much of what is included therein has become, or has been treated as if it were, fact. Too often, little attention is given to what terms and which individuals are included, who made these distinctions, and how they came to be treated as the “standard.” Ukiyo-e, like other artistic discourses, was not something that simply emerged; it was produced through competition—in the market, in culture, and in practice. Nanpo recorded those he regarded as worthy of note. In other words, Nanpo listed the winners. Nanpo participated in various cultural milieux with contemporary artists, writers, publishers, and others. While he would have based his writing upon understanding gained through those experiences, texts\n\nInventing the Pictures of the Floating World 23\n\nsuch as this one must be viewed as equally opinion and critique. Nanpo’s study of ukiyo-e is a form of ekphrasis, of writing that performs as rhetoric, persuading readers of a particular interpretation through the description of the work of art.3 This acknowledges that Nanpo’s text is the product of active evaluation rather than fact (just as is true for other writers, such as Giorgio Vasari [1511–1574] and Dong Qichang [1555– 1636], who wrote similar documents). Nanpo’s list was apparently so useful that several of his contemporaries continued adding to it. The earliest manuscript copy of this document includes notations contributed by Sasaya Shinshichi Kuni­ nori and Santō Kyōden (1761–1816) and may be dated to 1802. Shikitei Sanba (1776–1822) and Keisai Eisen (1790–1848), among others, added more. Saitō Gesshin (1804–1878) compiled the most thorough version, Collected Writings on Ukiyo-e, Enlarged and Revised (Zōho Ukiyo-e ruikō), by 1844. While each must be approached with healthy skepticism as well as put into period context, this gradual accumulation of information in pursuit of a canon testifies to an impulse to document and acknowledge ukiyo-e as a field of artistic production. For this earliest history, what Nanpo and his later compatriots knew and how they knew it cannot be determined. However, they were part of the same circles where such information was valued, may have also had access to earlier documents, and could vouch for ukiyo-e designers they knew. Yet even in the earliest version, we must regard the act of producing these notes as conveying his era’s assessment, as selection based upon appraisal. Since the contents of this document cannot be independently verified, all variations must be approached with some caution. It may be little more than informed opinion, after all. Its use value, rather, lies in what it reveals about the concepts and categories in play by the end of the eighteenth century and what was considered significant enough for notation. We can glean an overview of who and what (and how) was considered important by someone like Nanpo about this field and put it into an early modern discourse on ukiyo-e as “art.”4 This is a discourse of assessment. The document opens with a list of terms that demonstrate an ongoing process of classification. The first of these is ukiyo-e, the\n\n24\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n“pictures of the floating world.” It is not defined here nor elucidated later in the text. This lack of explication suggests that by now it must have been so familiar it needed no such treatment. Next follows Yamato-e, “Yamato-style pictures,” referring to the tradition of Japanese-style painting (employing the ancient name for Japan). This term, too, is left undefined on this opening page (but it is discussed further in the document in a later hand in a manner that suggests it was under negotiation). As organizing terms, both describe fields of artistic practice with recognizable styles, lineages, and markets, with all the stakes, rights, and politics therein. Following these large taxonomies are terms that refer to specific forms of production in a list that looks like a table of contents. Notably, these are listed in chronological order. They are rendered here in their closest equivalent terms in English, with their subdefinitions: Lacquered pictures (urushi-e): gilded, also pictures lacquered in black Single-sheet pictures (ichimai-e): called rose-colored pictures (beni-e) and Edo pictures (Edo-e) Illustrated fiction (kusazōshi): red-backed books (akabon), Chinesestyle covers (karashi-hyōshi), blue-backed books (aobon) —originally covered in light blue-green and called aobon —now the cover is yellow yet still called aobon Brocade pictures of the East (Azuma nishiki-e) Actor resemblances (yakusha nigao) Specially printed pictures (surimono-e)5\n\nThese are specific terms that demonstrate the degrees of difference recognized between these iterations of production (and many of these types appear throughout this book). Nowhere in this list are these works called prints (hanga). Indeed, the word hanga seems not to have been in use at all in the Edo period; instead it first appears at about the turn of the twentieth century. The term used today for “woodblock print” as mokuhanga seems to have been coined at the turn of the twentieth century, likely in order to discriminate between the forms of intaglio and planar print methods when those technologies came into active use in Japan.6\n\nInventing the Pictures of the Floating World 25\n\nWhat we see in Nanpo’s document is a list of major shifts in forms of image making. Many are described as pictures (e), using the same term that appears in ukiyo-e and Yamato-e for “pictures.” Urushi-e, beni-e, nishiki-e, and surimono all refer to different manipulations of the woodblock printing method, from printed line with special effects and some color (urushi-e and beni-e) to five or more color blocks (nishiki-e) to the further refinement of full color (surimono-e). Ichimai-e makes clear that these are single-sheet pictures. Printed books, listed as a separate category, are distinguished by the colors of their covers in the period shorthand for this format. “Resemblances of actors” (yakusha nigao) lacks the marker for pictures, but put in context, it must be so; what is important here is that the subject is described rather than the technique, perhaps signaling that these “resemblances” were regarded as a new approach. Surimono, specially commissioned pictures, close out the list as an emerging adaptation. Finally, twice in this list these works are designated as the product of Edo: in Edo-e, more explicitly, as Edo pictures, and in Azuma, using the classical term for the East, or Edo in all but a word. Turning the page, we begin reading the discussion of individual practitioners; the rest of the document is organized as a series of names, modified by information about lives and works. Terms designating art forms, from paintings to illustrated books, are also included in these entries, and close study of these demonstrates hierarchies of production in play. By now readers may be wondering why I have started this chapter with a document, not an image, and one that dates from the turn of the nineteenth century. It would seem more logical to begin, according to a chronological structure, at the beginning with the first images associated with ukiyo-e. Indeed, how does discussing a text written one hundred years later help us understand the earliest images? By composing this list, Nanpo was defining the beginning of ukiyo-e: he was literally writing its origin story. Why he did so is not explained in the document, but since his name appears as patron and poet for many works produced by contemporary publishers and illustrators, we can surmise he had a vested interest in that history. Thus, he was making fast that lineage, securing it as an extension of the long-established,\n\n26\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nmore highly valued art form of painting. According to this document, ukiyo-e is placed next to, and comes out of, Japanese-style painting (Yamato-e) (and is thus placed by implication in a longer historical dialectic with Chinese-style painting, Kara-e). And while this list of terms—from ukiyo-e to surimono-e—is unified by terms associated with picture making, further media distinctions are made. That specificity of difference is critical to his appraisal and historicity and, by extension, to that employed in the period. Let us return to the observation that nowhere in this start is there reference to print as a medium of production. Rather, things we know were made as prints—beni-e, nishiki-e, and so on—are treated as specific categories of pictures. Listing these forms of media at the outset demonstrates that these distinctions between forms carried cultural weight. Associating a name with a type differentiates practice (and value) accordingly. It cannot be said often enough or fervently enough that all ukiyo-e artists were trained in the practice of the brush as painters. But many, as this list demonstrates, did not achieve period recognition as painters; their names instead were aligned with specific forms of print media. Those who did achieve success as painters are cited accordingly in their individual biographical sketches. Most, however, worked as brushes for hire, commissioned by publishers to provide the sketches that would be rendered into prints by professionals, into blocks by carvers, and onto paper by printers. Yet for these illustrators, in both mindset and practice, their tool was the brush, not the carver’s knife or the printer’s rubbing pad (baren), and their contributions were ink sketches. How individual practitioners were defined on a list such as this relates specifically to the form for which they became known. Within the Edo market economy, those distinctions between forms of media signaled a system of ranking artistic production. For the names associated with painting, as Yamato-eshi, or “Japanese-style painting masters,” we can infer that these ranked highest, on a par with contemporary exemplars in other painting lineages. Those whose names were linked to forms of printed imagery were not regarded in their lifetimes as equals to painters, and we may well wonder (given the potentially high number of\n\nInventing the Pictures of the Floating World 27\n\nforgeries in ukiyo-e painting as a whole) whether they received commissions for paintings or worked solely as illustrators for prints. The act of writing this compendium (that later became the framework for the canon) stands, regardless, as a signal that the field of inquiry is appreciated and considered worthy of record. It also points to an ongoing competition around image production in the larger sphere of practice, where it becomes necessary to place boundaries around a field of image making. What Nanpo was using for his assessment—opinion, research, personal affiliation, or the works themselves?—cannot be known, but his reputation as a critic and an ally of a number of names on the list granted him then, as well as now, the stature of someone whose opinion was regarded as worthy of attention. Nanpo’s canon likely represented his era’s standards, and these have, in turn, become our own. But this evaluation neither occurred ex nihilo, out of nothing, nor happened overnight. It is the manifest result of a long contest of effort for recognition and validation, with charged terms of appraisal marshaled for greatest effect. Making evaluations of type, material, and quality was essential in Edo culture, just as it was in other parts of the early modern world where goods and services were bought or bartered, establishing value as well as reputation. Ukiyo-e is sometimes defined almost exclusively as a print medium, and modern admiration for the graphic quality of the work on paper has eclipsed the fact that printed works were both priced cheaper and ranked lower than paintings. Paintings were one-offs and unique; they might also be manifest demonstrations of an individual artist’s skills. By the later eighteenth century, their quality signaled higher material costs as commissioned works. Prints, produced in multiples, were the product of collaboration. Publishers hired skilled labor— designers, carvers, printers, and others—to produce printed works for sale on the open market. Private individuals, from poets to painters, sometimes worked as contractors for things intended for private circulation; these were commissioned (and often produced through the aegis of the publisher) for clubby commemorations, gift exchanges, and the like. Some illustrated books replicated paintings in print, making “originals” accessible in multiple for an audience interested in the\n\n28\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\npractice as well as the connoisseurship of painting, while others offered imagined other worlds of adventure, travel, fantasy, and more. If we take a quantitative approach to the larger world of Edo period visual production, the sheer numbers of works still extant that were produced as ukiyo-e leads us to the inevitable conclusion of a very large, acquisitive, and engaged market. The sheet prints that have become so widely appreciated (and appropriated) were part of a rapidly expanding print trade. Smart bookseller-publishers recognized the profits that might be yielded from the new urban and literate audience. But this, too, did not happen overnight. These were also part of a longer political and urban history under the extended military peace achieved during the Tokugawa shogunate and of a larger culture that valued literacy and understood the importance of documents.7 The shifts that resulted from Edo’s gradual economic and cultural dominance have been discussed thoroughly in many other publications and may be summarized here. What is significant for this study is how it is visible in the publishing trade. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth century, the number of book publishers active in Edo increased significantly, while those in Osaka and Kyoto declined. In the seventeenth century, Kyoto publishers in operation numbered 701, while Osaka-based producers numbered 185, making this zone the center of production. By comparison, there were some 242 working in Edo. By the nineteenth century, Edo far and away surpassed the other two, with 917. Kyoto and Osaka publishers dropped to 494 and 504, respectively. At the same time, the number of publishers in the provinces increased, from 43 in the seventeenth century to 135 in the eighteenth century, climbing to 407 across ten provinces in the nineteenth, nearly ten times their initial number.8 It is often said that ukiyo-e represented the manners and customs of the city of Edo, as though designed to put on view the values of this urban population. There is some merit in that statement, but that model ignores the vital environments of Kyoto, Osaka, Nagasaki, and others, where similar printed things were in circulation. It also proposes a scenario wherein Edo’s illustrators were motivated to observe and document, as though their purpose was to record the reality around\n\nInventing the Pictures of the Floating World 29\n\nthem. To be sure, some were, and some did, depending upon circumstances and patronage. However, it seems increasingly clear that many, if not most, of these images served as advertisements, as works for hire promoting entertainments and products in a larger mercantile economy. Ukiyo pictures and stories put on view the amusing diversions, au courant fashions, and various entertainments on offer in the urban centers. These town-painters (machi-eshi), as they were known, had great success in depicting a wide array of scenes of contemporary life— including those of the theater, the pleasure quarters, and the celebrated entertainers—for their audiences. If “ukiyo-e” was worthy of definition as an image-making practice by the end of the eighteenth century, that assessment was part of a longer engagement in the market and in critical evaluation. This chapter will now turn to selected early practitioners to demonstrate how this style emerged, as well as how principles of painting were transferred into print. Here, as throughout, all manner of media will be considered as part of the ukiyo-e genre—sheet prints, illustrated books, and paintings—and careful attention will be paid to the ways that signatures and colophons used culturally significant terms associated with other zones of artistic production. How and why images depicted particular subjects in and for the floating world—and how that process, too, was negotiated within the larger field of publishing and collecting—will also be discussed.\n\nDesigning Pictures for Emerging Urban Markets For Nanpo, the three “founders” of ukiyo-e were Iwasa Matabei (1578–1650), Hishikawa Moronobu (1618–1694), and Hanabusa Itchō (1652–1724), and these three names have retained this stature ever since. In these brief biographies, Nanpo drops key terms that draw the boundaries and define the practices of ukiyo-e. Matabei, known mainly as a painter then as now, was so skilled at pictures of present-day customs ( fūzoku) that he began to be known as Ukiyo Matabei. A later hand adds that this “must be the first ukiyo-e” and that Matabei was reportedly good at Ōtsu-style pictures, a kind of folk art imagery featuring\n\n30\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nlucky, moralizing, or apotropaic subjects.9 While Matabei was worthy of note, it is with Moronobu and Itchō that Nanpo secures the start of the genre. Both Moronobu and Itchō are described by Nanpo as “Japanese-­style painters” (Yamato-eshi), signaling that these picture masters (eshi) studied traditional Japanese painting. Nanpo recognized, as we do today, that ukiyo-e as an artistic form was based upon two earlier material practices, genre painting and woodblock printing. Painters like Matabei and Itchō developed individual painting styles through adapting and melding period precedents, such as those the Kano and Tosa painting lineages advocated. For Nanpo, Matabei and Itchō serve as venerable hinge points to painting traditions, significant as such in this list. Neither painter produced sheet prints or illustrations for books. Instead, later admirers replicated their designs for paintings in the medium of the illustrated book. Copying these paintings for illustrated books distributed their imagery, commemorated their innovations, and reified their stature. Turning the masters’ pictures into print might serve as a guide for connoisseurs or as a memorial to mastery, but linking pictures with a name established the concept of an individual style. Thus, these books functioned as an incipient form of trademarking intellectual property (as well as securing positions for those very followers).10 Illustrated books made the styles of Itchō and Matabei available to a wider audience, but—if later ukiyo-e prints and books that include notations to the past are any indication— they are less often referenced as “founders” than is Moronobu. Rather, Moronobu is more often cited as a “father” or “founder” by later artists, perhaps because he was the first to use both painting and illustrated books as vehicles.11 He would have been working on commission for both, serving well-to-do patrons with his paintings and publishers with his sketches for illustrated books. It is this use of the print medium, I would argue, that renders ukiyo-e as a category distinct: from the start, while a number of its notable early practitioners made paintings, many more designed for print. For some of these, their artistic practice was almost exclusively for print. No other artistic form had this kind of reach and promise, engaging both media at once, and no other exploited so effectively the potential for sales in an emerging market of commodities.\n\nInventing the Pictures of the Floating World 31\n\nIf Nanpo recognized the value in defining some practitioners as Yamato-eshi, or their works as Yamato-e, so did Hishikawa Moronobu and his contemporaries.12 Indeed, Moronobu often included the term “Japanese-­style picture” (Yamato-e) in his signatures, and looking to these inscriptions, we can see that Moronobu and others were acutely aware of the value in asserting that connection to the past. Moronobu was born in Awa Province (modern-day Chiba Prefecture) into a family of embroiderers and textile producers, and throughout his paintings and illustrated books, he displays great sensitivity to depicting fabrics and the fashions of the moment.13 Moronobu made a large number of paintings and illustrated books that integrated, and thus revealed, his mastery of earlier painting styles. In particular, these draw upon styles aligned with the Kano and Tosa lineages. After moving to the shogun’s city as a young man, he rendered scenes of Edo city life in the hanging scroll, standing screen, and handscroll formats, as well as in illustrated printed books showing contemporary life, fashionable figures, and erotic encounters.14 Moronobu’s success as a book illustrator is evident in his name being assigned to about 130 titles made between the 1650s and 1694; these are either signed by him or attributed by style. A number of these were likely brought to completion by members of his atelier, copying from his designs.15 Projects finished through contributions within the studio were not unusual; such was the standard throughout the early modern world (as well as in some contemporary art practices today). By Nanpo’s time the illustrated book as an outlet was also worthy of note, as we can see in his list, and the word hanpon, describing a book printed from woodblocks, is used in his entry on Moronobu. It is worth noting that this term uses the character for “plank” (as a block book) rather than the han meaning imprint. These books, as well as his paintings, featured people from all walks of life. One of the most influential of this kind of book was surely the One Hundred Women of Our Country (Wakoku hyakujo) of 1695, where Moronobu sketched women in a variety of roles and occupations (figure 5).16 This book illustrated women appreciated as beautiful exemplars as well as those engaged in more sundry pursuits. It was part of a larger discourse around classifying individuals, wherein the concept\n\n32\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nFigure 5. Hishikawa Moronobu, One Hundred Women of Our Country (Wakoku hyakujo), 1695;\n\npublished by Matsue.

By this time the notion of the beautiful person (bijin) was well established. The term is gender neutral, thus it could refer to attractive women, stylish men, and those who negotiated the territory in between, particularly the young men called youths or wakashu.17 Pictures of these “beautiful people” also displayed the fashions of the moment, and as in all other eras and societies, the terms of beauty were culturally constructed; physical features were enhanced through stylish clothing, hairstyles, cosmetics, accomplishments, and deportment.18 The notion extended to professional “beauties,” such as the sex workers of the pleasure districts and actors from the kabuki\n\nInventing the Pictures of the Floating World 33\n\nstage, as well as others. Not only did ukiyo books, prints, and paintings replicate these trends, they also contributed to a larger ongoing social conversation about what was considered attractive. Writers during this period—from Ihara Saikaku (1642–1693) to Kaibara Ekiken (1630– 1714)—likewise commented on the ways in which bodily adornment and modification were part of this pursuit of beauty. Moronobu’s classification of women was part of this larger engagement with defining (and commodifying) typologies according to terms of gender, class, and occupation, as well as others. Moronobu’s training in the art of textile design is evident throughout this book and his oeuvre as a whole. His paintings often feature exquisite up-to-date designs in which the textile techniques have been carefully replicated. His books on garment design (hinagatabon) put that knowledge into circulation; they also demonstrate the commercial connection between ukiyo-e illustrations and the world of fashion.19 In a book on kimono designs, Full-Length Figures in Short-Sleeved Kimono (Kosode no sugatami), dated to 1683, Moronobu shows women and youths wearing stylish garments, with the textile’s color pattern and decorative features described in the accompanying text, as exemplars of all that it meant to be a bijin (figure 6). By the late seventeenth century, the rapid changes in fashion prompted one critic to comment wryly that the “women of today go to extraordinary lengths” to present themselves attractively—plucking stray hairs, turning away to hide blemishes, wearing long robes to conceal thick ankles—and in doing so were mimicking the fashions promoted in images of professional sex workers. Whether they were examples of vanity run wild or just keeping up with the neighbors depended upon one’s point of view. Moronobu’s beauties were regarded as sexy when clad and even sexier undressed. Contemporary novelist Ihara Saikaku described the allure of Moronobu’s figures in the erotic book Irozato mitokoro setai (Three Noteworthy Sexual Situations, 1688): “Looking at the ukiyo-e books from Hishikawa’s brush, there is a rich abundance of the flesh and roundness to the hips.”20 For works associated with the prostitution district, it is clear that the well-known advertising phrase “sex sells” was understood for images of that world too.\n\n34\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nFigure 6.

In Moronobu’s kimono design book, for example, note how the articulation of the brush, in the swelling and tapering of the lines along the hem of the robe, has been preserved. Look, too, at the ends of some of these lines—it is as though the brush has been lifted from this piece of paper. This is an illusion, of course, for what is actually printed is the carefully carved taper of a raised block line. But it is in the written text where we might be most amazed—consider how this text is carved in reverse, retaining the flow of the writer’s brush down the page and the arrangement of the characters around the figure. Text\n\nInventing the Pictures of the Floating World 35\n\nand image are rendered in the same block, giving equal attention and merit to both, with attention kept on the hand of the composer. Moronobu’s paintings often described the variety of entertainments on offer in the f loating world. In a pair of handscrolls now held in the Idemitsu Museum of Art, scenes progress from late winter through summer in one scroll, showing people and places of urban life, such as a fan shop, a barrel maker, a cherry blossom viewing, a boating party on the Sumida River, and the annual late summer Obon festival. With the second scroll, we walk through the Yoshiwara licensed prostitution district in autumn, ending our tour with an elaborate evening party as we are warmed by a hibachi burning charcoal and framed with a white plum in bloom, signifying late winter. Some features in these paintings are rendered in ways that indicate Moronobu’s students were contributing, offering their hands to keep up with demand.21 This was standard practice in the period, just as it was in early modern ateliers around the world, and Moronobu’s students would have had access to the master’s sketches as well as his printed books. Whether working in collaboration with their teacher or under his instruction, these works would have gone into the world under the Moronobu brand. His later students further refined his approach, making the Hishikawa style one of the most recognizable in the later seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.22 Many of Moronobu’s works portray the customs and entertainments of the “floating world” of the licensed prostitution district, as seen in a painting dated to the late 1680s (figure 7). By the time Moronobu illustrated the most famous of these quarters, the Yoshiwara, it had long been established as Edo’s officially sanctioned, regulated, and commercialized brothel district. The “beauties” who worked as indentured sex workers in the licensed quarters—as well as in the unlicensed locales— become one of the genre’s most frequent subjects. In early modern Japan, they were known as yūjo, a word that translates to “women for play,” as well as by other terms, and are frequently described as “courtesans” in English. Often they are described in terms that render them agency as individuals and trendsetters. As has been discussed elsewhere, these women were ranked and evaluated according to their achievement\n\n36\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nFigure 7. Hishikawa Moronobu, Genre Scenes in Edo, late seventeenth century. Ink, color, and gold on paper, handscroll, 51.4 × 1,761.4 cm. John C. Weber Collection.\n\nof culturally constructed notions of beauty, with their availability and price points assessed accordingly.23 Throughout this text, I have chosen to use the term “sex worker” instead of “courtesan” to describe the women employed in the sex trade. This is purposefully done, to avoid the glamorization suggested by “courtesan” as well as the potentially derogatory associations with “prostitute” and related synonyms. As will be discussed throughout, pictures were an effective mechanism for representing the women (and some men) indentured into the sex trade. Some of these printed works seem to reveal details about them— such as their crests, handwriting, and so on—but these points must be regarded with due skepticism since they are produced by, through, and for marketing their trade, often on behalf of their employers. Moronobu’s handscroll included notations about some of the places where sex was for sale, noting, for example, the names, kinds, and ranks of brothels and sex workers. For example, in this section of the painting, locations in the Kyomachi section of the Yoshiwara district are identified in the inscriptions: on the right is the Miuraya house, a middle-ranking brothel; in the center, the Takashima house (its name inscribed on the banner), at a lower rank; and on the left, marked by\n\nInventing the Pictures of the Floating World 37\n\nthe gray curtains, are the tsubone, the small “compartment” spaces at the lowest rank. Sex workers on display at the Miuraya wait for customers behind the lattice, perusing books or checking makeup in a mirror, while those at the following doorways attempt to engage clients. One of ukiyo-e’s related subjects was sex itself, and these have become so famous that they are known worldwide by their euphemism shunga, or “spring pictures.” Although edicts were regularly issued banning this subject, the production of erotica flourished throughout the period. One way of avoiding trouble was simply not to sign the work. Individual practitioners developed styles that were distinct, making attribution to specific hands possible. Erotic images were almost always produced in sets in the form of albums or books, not as individual sheet prints, but many have now been removed from these bindings to be sold as single works (see figure 8). Likely part of a set of twelve, this unique impression can also be attributed to the hand of Okumura Masanobu (1686–1764), one of the longest-lived and most prolific illustrators of the first half of the eighteenth century. Masanobu worked for over fifty years in the profession as a book illustrator, print designer, and painter, as well as established his own trade as a publisher, Okumuraya. After listing Masanobu’s artist names, Nanpo notes only that he ran a bookshop in Edo and that he used a gourd-shaped seal; this final detail was likely intended to confirm Masanobu’s practice.24 This example can be dated to Masanobu’s early career, when he was adapting the Moronobu style. In ukiyo-e, as in so many other endeavors, imitation is not only a sign of appreciation but also a means to attract customers seeking similar products. Here, a woman wraps her arms around a young man and tries to distract him from his book. Titled Purple Flowers (Hana murasaki), he is probably reading a book of erotica—was it the book Love’s Purple Flowers (Koi no hana murasaki) that was made in the 1680s? This young male figure is a wakashu, recognizable as such by his hairstyle, with the forelock sweeping back over the shaved top of his head. Shaving off the forelock to achieve a man’s hairstyle was typically done about age fifteen and regarded as part of the rite of passage to adulthood. These wakashu appear often in ukiyo-e, and it has\n\n38\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nbeen argued that they represented a “third gender” and were known for wearing more feminine-style garments (as may be seen here in his kimono with long sleeves) to enhance their sexual appeal to other men as well as women.25 The text above playfully shifts from seeming to float in air to looking as if it decorates the standing screen and is written in an expressive calligraphic style. It replicates the quality of the brush in use, with characters that appear applied with a freshly dipped brush and others where the writer has split the hairs through the action of his hand.\n\nFigure 8.

The text can be translated as: “Lost in the matsutake mushroom hunt, an audacious woman climbs Mount Koya.”26 The woman lying on top of the man is likened to her compatriots who transgressed the rules forbidding women to climb the sacred temple mountain; she is cast as audacious in her desire to “climb” this young man on her hunt for the phallus-shaped mushroom. Masanobu’s design cleverly invites the viewer to participate in her hunt, to distinguish between the layered garments and body parts and to reach below the folds. In doing so the picture also offers the masculine gaze the opportunity to imagine the pleasure of being sought after (as well as the possibilities of participation as a third party in the scene). As the previous examples demonstrate, from the start figures—­ regardless of gender position—from the “floating world” were objects of the eroticizing gaze. Over time, images of women became more often the object of the gaze (although men, particularly young men, remained fetishized too). Women who worked in the sex trade were being described and categorized in other media (such as guidebooks and fiction about the sex quarters), and their representation served to promote that trade. Yet whether professional prostitutes or not, most female figures are shown posing in a manner that encourages the viewer to appreciate selected parts of the female form—the face and hair, nape of the neck, feet and toes, wrists and hands—and of her costume— makeup, hairstyle and ornaments, flowing robes, and gorgeous obi. Earlier genre paintings often featured figures from the demimonde shown singly or in groups for such appreciation. While Nanpo does not mention the Kaigetsudō group of painters in his list of practitioners, period documents as well as visual citations of their style suggest that their treatment of the female figure set a new standard in ukiyo-e. Their images of elaborately clad standing beauties in alluring, twisting postures were, in effect, early eighteenth-century pinup pictures. Kaigetsudō Ando (active about 1704–1736), the founder of the lineage, worked exclusively as a painter, demonstrating truly skillful treatment of the subject of beauties.27 Ando, working from the models established by the earlier painters as well as Moronobu, further\n\n40\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\ndeveloped this manner of presenting the standing beauty (figure 9). With her arms extended to insert her tortoiseshell comb, the figure shown in this painting seems to have been captured at the moment she is making final adjustments to her costume before meeting her client. Close attention has been paid to describing her layered robes, with the uppermost combining pattern with zones of deeply dyed blue, and to her obi tied in front in the practice professional sex workers used for ease of dress as well as display of sumptuous fabric. Her tiny feet and hands, the exposed nape of her neck, and the folds around her bust and legs draw the eye to her desirable features. The painting invites the viewer to indulge in the fantasy of meeting, to look upon her figure with desire and imagine unwrapping those layers. While Ando and his students received commissions, many of their paintings, like the one illustrated here, were produced as readymades, available for purchase from a shop. Like Moronobu, their signatures assert their affiliation with painting, and in both paintings and prints, the Kaigetsudō often used the phrase “lighthearted painting in Japanese style.” From the number of works remaining, it is clear that the Kaigetsudō group produced images that period buyers appreciated. Ando’s followers in the Kaigetsudō school produced monochrome prints as well as paintings, and many of their larger-­ scale prints nearly replicate their paintings so closely that it seems likely that the prints served as cheaper alternatives (figure 10). Yet in his signature on the print, Anchi stakes authorial claim writing that this “amusing Japanese image is by Anchi, the Kaigetsudō’s last leaf ” (Nihon giga Kaigetsu matsuyō Anchi zu). Miyagawa Chōshun (1682–1752), working in the first half of the eighteenth century, is one of the rare ukiyo-e masters known only as a painter. Like the Kaigetsudō school masters, Chōshun’s subject matter was beautiful women, often the stylish professional sex workers, and he tended to employ a set of standard compositions. Like his contemporaries, Chōshun produced paintings put on sale in shops, rather than working on private commission.28 By varying the format and dimensions, as well as the details in his paintings, Chōshun’s works no doubt appealed to a variety of patrons and were sold at several price points.\n\nInventing the Pictures of the Floating World 41\n\nFigure 9.

Likewise, Chōshun’s paintings of beauties in interiors vary mainly in the details of their settings, garments, and the position of the attendants. All were part of the display of the female figure as an object of the gaze, in service to the larger sex trade. Chōshun was prolific, and by the late "
