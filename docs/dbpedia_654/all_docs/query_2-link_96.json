They demonstrate their master\n\nskills that date back over generations. While the\n\nWaza travel throughout the world, Ginza Holiday\n\nat the Midwest Buddhist Temple is one of their few\n\nappearances in the United States.\n\nThis year, we welcome four Waza masters: ceramist\n\nEiji Kinoshita from Kyushu Oita Prefecture; Masahiro\n\nKawakami, a third-generation maker of tenugui\n\n(hand-painted Japanese cotton) from Asakusa Tokyo\n\nPrefecture; chirimen artisan Meisho Yamasaki from\n\nSumida Tokyo Prefecture, and shiatsu practitioner Yoko\n\nKamada.\n\n20\n\nthe waza\n\nEiji Kinoshita\n\nEiji Kinoshita creates\n\nunique earthenware whose\n\nevery creation is a new\n\ndiscovery of its own. Moving\n\nfrom the potter’s wheel, he\n\nbecame attracted to the\n\nnatural beauty of stones and\n\ntiles. It is their forms that\n\nhe transforms into ceramic\n\nearthenware.\n\nApplying the method\n\nknown as carburetting, Mr.\n\nKinoshita’s art forms require high heat and large quantities of\n\nsmoke. Permeating into the earthenware, the smoke produces\n\nthe unique blacks and grays that infuse each creation with a\n\ndistinctive luster. Despite their extreme beauty, his pieces are\n\ndesigned to be used, not just displayed.\n\n21\n\nthe waza\n\nPhotos from asakusa.gr.jp\n\nMasahiro Kawakami\n\nMasahiro Kawakami is a third-generation\n\nmaker of tenugui, loosely translated as\n\ntowel art. However, unlike the typical\n\nwestern use, it could serve as a belt or a\n\nhead cover. Cotton, an import from China\n\nin the 14th–16th century and made into\n\ntowels, became popular throughout Japan\n\nin the Edo period as an accessory at rituals.\n\nSoon beautiful patterns and designs applied\n\nto the fabric became fashionable and in\n\naddition provided means of advertising\n\nproducts.\n\nWhile intended to be used as hankies, towels or wrapping,\n\nmany are hung as wall art—fastened to simple scrolls or\n\nframed under glass.\n\n22\n\nthe waza\n\nPhotos from ichimadoll.exblog.jp\n\nMeisho yamasaki\n\nMeisho Yamasaki specializes in ichimatsu\n\nningyo or “article shaped like a human being”\n\nand makes dolls with children’s faces. She is\n\nthe only female Ichimatsu doll maker in Japan.\n\nThe materials and techniques she uses go\n\nback 300 years, and 74 steps are necessary\n\nto complete each doll. Bodies of sawdust and\n\nrice glue, eyes of glass and multilayer coatings\n\nall contribute to their youthful appearances.\n\nCareful sculpturing gives them detail and\n\nbrings forth their special expressions. A kimono\n\nmade of cloth from antique clothes adds the\n\nfinal touch.\n\nMs. Yamasaki’s dolls can be displayed singly or\n\nin a group, in a glass case or out in the open—\n\nthough open displays lend a playful intimacy in\n\nline with their youthful character.\n\n23\n\nthe waza\n\nYOKO KAMADA\n\nYoko Kamada is a\n\npractitioner of shiatsu\n\nor Japanese finger\n\npressure massage.\n\nMany see it as a way\n\nto help relax and cope\n\nwith stress, muscle pain\n\nand stiffness.\n\nApplying pressure\n\nusing her fingers and\n\nthumbs in a continuous\n\nrhythmic sequence, the pressure feels more\n\nlocalized as the fingers­—instead of the entire\n\npalm—are used to apply pressure. No oil is\n\napplied, so you remain fully clothed during the\n\ntreatment. But it's best if you don’t eat a heavy\n\nmeal before the shiatsu.\n\nCongratulations on the\n\n60th Ginza Holiday Festival!\n\n24\n\nIDeNtIty tHeft\n\nHoW To AVoId THE LoSS oF JA IdENTITy\n\nThe Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) Chicago Chapter has\n\nmany new and exciting free programs for all ages.\n\nProject: Community! is our free program that focuses on leadership\n\ndevelopment and cultural awareness for Chicago-area Japanese American\n\nhigh school students.

Some\n\npeople jokingly refer to SPAM as “mystery\n\nmeat,” falling under the same category as hot\n\ndogs. But the label clearly solves the mystery,\n\nlisting the ingredients of the classic variety of\n\nSPAM as chopped pork shoulder meat (with\n\nham meat added), salt, water, modified potato\n\nstarch (as a binder), sugar and sodium nitrite\n\n(as a preservative).\n\nSPAM, essentially short for spiced ham, can\n\nbe prepared in multiple ways, but grilled is a\n\npopular way to go.\n\nContinued on following page\n\n26\n\nContinued from previous page\n\nHawaii consumes the most SPAM per\n\ncapita, second to Guam. Its popularity\n\nin Hawaii began during World War\n\nII. Today, SPAM, eggs, and rice is\n\na popular breakfast dish. It is also\n\ncommon for McDonald’s and other fast-\n\nfood giants to offer SPAM on their menu\n\non occasion, if not permanently.\n\nMusubis are usually 1- to 2-inch-high In Hawaii, SPAM musubis are sold\n\nblocks of rice—the length and width of in markets, convenience stores, gas\n\na slice of SPAM—topped with a slice stations, restaurants and food trucks.\n\nof meat and then wrapped in dried High-school students also sell SPAM\n\nseaweed (nori).

As a separate\n\nperforming art form, taiko evolved only\n\nin the last 35 years. There is a spirit and\n\nenergy from the drum that expresses\n\nthe harmony of the players, the drums\n\nand the listener.\n\n32\n\n33\n\nMBT Minyo\n\nM inyo, a genre of\n\ntraditional Japanese\n\nfolk music and dance, was\n\noriginally sung and danced as\n\npeople worked, the rhythms\n\nsynchronizing and easing the\n\nlabor physically and mentally.\n\nIn addition to representing\n\nregional occupations (harvest\n\ndances, fishermen’s and\n\ncoal miner’s dances), minyo\n\ndances and songs also\n\nrepresent celebrations and\n\nlegends of Japan.\n\nThe Midwest Buddhist\n\nTemple Minyo group has\n\nkept this style of Japanese\n\nfolk dancing alive at the\n\ntemple for 49 years.

Instead, one blends\n\nthe movements of their body with that of\n\nthe opponent, allowing them to deflect\n\nthe attack and force the opponent off\n\nbalance. Along with this principle are\n\na number of locks and holds that may\n\nbe used to neutralize the opponent.\n\nAikido also utilizes weapons such as the\n\nwooden sword (bokken), short staff (jo)\n\nand dagger (tanto) as training tools.\n\nAikido is characterized by flowing\n\ncircular motion, embodying O-Sensei’s\n\nbelief that man should strive to live\n\nin harmony with his environment and\n\nnature.
