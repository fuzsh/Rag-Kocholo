State U. as well as their own place[...]I can provide these links by pm if anybody else wants them, though [most of] the aikido links are easily gotten through bujindesign.com's link page. [As for]Glen Brook's dojo, that link is dead if anyone can do something about that.\n\nThat's it for me on this, I don't know anything more."
