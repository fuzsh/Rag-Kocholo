        "text": "In Memoriam: Sensei George Simcox and Sensei Edward Baker\n\nIn November 2000, the U. S. aikido community sadly said good-bye two of its early practitioners, Sensei George Simcox and Sensei Ed Baker. The two men were contemporaries, born within two years of each other, each discovering aikido while serving in the Armed Forces. Although their paths may not have crossed directly, they were on a similar journey. Their love of aikido and lifetime devotion to its practice played a powerful part in their lives and in the lives of those who were fortunate enough to have known them.\n\nGeorge Simcox sensei, 6th dan, founder and chief instructor of the Virginia Ki Society, passed away on November 10, 2000. He was sixty-seven years old. Information about Simcox sensei may be found at the Virginia Ki Society website at http://vakisociety.org. A first person account by Simcox sensei of his aikido career may be found in the book Aikido in America, by Stone and Meyer.\n\nEdward B. Baker sensei of Davenport, Florida, was sixty-five at the time of his death in late November, 2000. He touched many lives through his art, having taught in Florida since the late 1960's. He counted among his teachers, in chronological order, senseis Robert Tann, Hiroshi Kusada, Frank Doran, Francis Takahashi, Yoshimitsu Yamada, Mitsugi Saotome, Ruriko Masutani, and he enjoyed seminars with senseis Mitsunari Kanai, Terry Dobson, and Henry Kono. Dan Vaccaro may be contacted for more information at danielv@evcom.net.\n\nWhen an individual departs this life, those of us remaining become acutely aware of our indebtedness to this person, to the sweat and effort he or she put into their life's work and to the gifts they left us as a result. We also become acutely aware that we no longer have direct access to them - ever. We are poignantly reminded that \"Now is now,\" and that opportunities not taken now may be lost forever.\n\nWe owe it to ourselves and to others coming after us to open our minds to aikido, to take advantage of the wealth of experience and talent that is still available to us in the form of living, vibrant teachers. These individuals have persevered in their own training, they have discovered information unique unto them, and we have the opportunity to open ourselves and learn so much.\n\nTo become educated we read many books. We can take a similar approach to our aikido education, but in this case, seminars and classes with great teachers are our \"books.\" They are the most valuable form of resource material available to us, real-time, for our personal research. For a paper or thesis in school, we gather many resources and distill and synthesize them to create a unique interpretation, to which we then sign our name. It is similar in aikido, where we are creating our own aikido knowledge and skill by learning from many teachers and synthesizing that knowledge with the hard work of our daily training.\n\nIn the end, aikido is experiential, body to body and skin to skin, mind to mind, and budo cannot be learned entirely from books or even videos. Let's not ignore the opportunities at hand, for we never know when they may disappear.\n\nI would like to call your attention to our Featured Article by a very fine U.S. aikido instructor, William Gleason sensei, founder of Shobu Aikido of Boston. You won't want to miss this compelling account of his personal experiences in Japan in the late 1960's and '70's at Honbu Dojo and with his primary teacher, Shihan Seigo Yamaguchi. Gleason sensei continues a vigorous and dedicated practice today, operating his dojo and conducting seminars, passing on the gifts of Yamaguchi sensei and the influences of other teachers.\n\nIt was in Japan that I met and became friends with Gleason sensei and Mary Heiny sensei, another student from the United States. (Heiny sensei is founder of the Seattle School of Aikido.) We trained at Honbu together, enjoying the undeniable privilege of attending the classes of O'sensei's uchideshi, each one a distinctive individual, with their own character and specialty. Among our teachers were Doshu Kisshomaru, and shihan Osawa, Kiochi Tohei, Arikawa, Yamaguchi, Saotome, Akira Tohei, and Sasaki. Looking back, I can't begin to describe how valuable those up-close and personal experiences are to me now."
