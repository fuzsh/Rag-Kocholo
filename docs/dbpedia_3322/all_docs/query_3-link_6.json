        "text": "Anything Can Happen is a British satirical entertainment comedy television series created by and starring filmmaker and satirist Theo Webster and originally broadcast on Channel 4 from 10th October 2008 to 15th June 2016. When the show ended, it was replaced by occasional special episodes that often abandoned the usual format of the show.\n\nThe series is a variety show, showcasing a series of sections about certain topics, like a news section, a challenge section, and a special guest section. The show, because of its random nature and giving almost no clue as to how the episode will go from the opening, was fairly successful for Channel 4, bringing in just under 3 million viewers in the first episode alone from people who have seen Webster's films, which are quite popular in the UK.\n\nEver since its airing, Anything Can Happen has become a cult favourite, with many citing it as one of the only TV shows to utilize a late-night talk show styled variety programme without a studio audience. In 2010, HBO ordered a US version of the show, also starring Webster, which aired in 2012 and was shown in the UK on More4 a few days afterwards. In 2021, an Australian version of the show was broadcast on Nine Network, also featuring Webster as the presenter and writer, and aired in the UK on Channel 4 on Sunday nights.\n\nThe show is often repeated on More4, Dave and Comedy Central.\n\nFormat[]\n\nThe show usually starts with Webster giving a brief round-up of the various items coming up in the show, before the intro plays. Afterwards, Webster gives a short monologue about something he's interested in before cutting to the first section, The Headlines, a satirical look at the week's news stories told in a sarcastic and often parodistic manor. This is usually followed by Submissions Off You, a segment dedicated to viewer-submitted clips and short films, or This Week's Challenge, a challenge section where Webster has to complete a task of varying quality. This Week's Challenge is usually split into different parts and played at multiple points throughout the episode.\n\nAnything after an advert break is usually Our Special Guest, a section where Webster is joined by a special guest (or more) and an interview is carried out. Many different celebrities have appeared on the show, like Danny Dyer, Carol Vorderman, Johnny Vegas, Jimmy Carr, Chris Moyles, among many others. Sometimes, the special guests can be unusual and some have even been animated. For the show's seventh and final series, the Simpsons were interviewed on the show, with the chairs replaced by a \"replica\" of their iconic coach. If the section ends early, or if a celebrity walks out (these are more-than-likely staged) then the next section plays. My Opinions, a review section of the show where Webster gives his personal opinion on things in the news, on TV, and in life. This section focuses more on satire than on comedy, as Webster often makes sarcastic and witty remarks about the topics he talks about.\n\nThe third part of the show encompasses no pre-planned section scheduling, meaning any section could play without thought or reason, subject to whether it is truly \"entertaining\". Sections in the third part include some comedy sketches, written by Webster himself and often featuring guest cameos from well-known people. These became more prominent as the show moved on and got more popular with viewers. If there was a challenge in part one, then the third part would often continue that challenge (same with part four, if needed). There is also a chance that animated shows that Webster has been involved in to make an appearance, often being animated into live-action scenery. The show often pokes fun at itself for doing this as an attempt to \"appeal to the live-action fans\".\n\nThe fourth and final part of the show is about the same as part three, but there is slightly more consistency. For example, there is a segment called Supermarket Invasion, where Webster visits supermarket chains across the UK to go shopping and find good food to eat. Webster has always found this segment amusing as he claims: \"It's such a ridiculous thing to add to a show that's got the headlines, sketches, special guests, and animated properties that I just went ahead and did it anyway, and I enjoyed it!\". These sections are often filmed with cheap cameras that film in low quality, with a Nintendo DS being used once to go to a One Stop in Salisbury. Another section used in this part is Don't Talk About the War, a look at different worldwide conflicts by using maps to explain history in a humourous and satirical way.\n\nThe show often ends with Webster giving another look at the headlines, before giving a closing remark.\n\nEpisodes[]\n\nList of Anything Can Happen episodes\n\nSeries Episodes Originally aired Ave. UKviewers(millions) First aired Last aired Network 1 5 10 October 2008 7 November 2008 Channel 4 2.95 2 6 10 September 2009 12 November 2009 2.64 3 8 6 October 2010 1 December 2010 1.71 4 6 11 September 2011 16 October 2011 More4 0.91 5 6 23 July 2013 27 August 2013 Channel 4 2.67 6 6 15 September 2015 20 October 2015 1.95 7 9 20 April 2016 15 June 2016 2.73\n\nBroadcast[]\n\nThe first series was shown from 10th October to 7th November 2008 on Channel 4 on Friday nights at 10pm. Unlike other comedy shows on the channel, Anything Can Happen was separately sponsored from the usual \"comedy on 4\" sponsorships. The first series was sponsored by Revels. On 14th November, Webster presented a special episode for More4 looking at what happened during the US presidential elections.\n\nA second series was commissioned for airing in 2009. The second series, sponsored by Virgin Mobile, was broadcast from 10th September to 12th November 2009 on Channel 4. It was at this time when More4 began showing older episodes in the run up to the new series, where they would repeat episodes the day after if viewers missed it.\n\nA Christmas special was shown on 24th December 2009 at 10pm on Channel 4, reaching over 3.5 million viewers, the highest until 2013.\n\nA third series, sponsored by Dreams Beds, aired from 6th October to 1st December 2010 on Channel 4. More repeats were shown on More4 and even on Channel 4 itself in the early hours, and there were some clues that the show would move to More4.\n\nFor the fourth series in 2011, Channel 4 announced that it would move the show to More4, premiering every Tuesday at 10:00pm, with a repeat of the episode shown on Channel 4 the following night. The series was sponsored by Freederm.\n\nThe show took a break in 2012, although the US version, under the title Anything Can Happen USA, aired on More4 from 6th February 2012 to 26th March 2012, each at 10pm and sponsored by Schwarzkopf Live Color XXL, along with repeats of the show. The show was seen as inferior to the original and saw the setting change ruined it slightly. US ratings bombed below 500,000 and not re-commissioned for a second season.\n\nThe UK original returned on 23rd July 2013, back on Channel 4 and sponsored by WeBuyAnyCar.com. The series aired up to 27th August 2013.\n\nA new Christmas special aired at 9:30pm on Christmas Day on Channel 4 and achieved the highest viewing figures in the shows history was over 3.8 million viewers tuning in.\n\nThe sixth series aired from 15th September to 20th October 2015 on Channel 4, each at 10pm and sponsored by Lucozade.\n\nThe seventh and final series aired for 9 episodes from 20th April to 15th June 2016 at the earlier time of 9pm on Channel 4. The extended amount of episodes gave the show more time until it was the end."
