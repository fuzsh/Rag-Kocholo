        "text": "Jose Ferrer had a stage and film career for half a century, and from almost the first he was recognized as a rising star. My favorite screen role of his came early in his career as defense attorney Lieutenant Barney Greenwald in The Caine Mutiny (1954).\n\nHis opportunity to portray Herod Antipas came in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965)\n\nFerrer plays Herod Antipas as a world weary cynic who fears that Hell is all too real, feebly trying to deny the coming damnation that he knows he has richly earned:\n\nHis execution of John after the dance of Salome seals his damnation as far as Herod is concerned. (Charlton Heston’s portrayal of John is a wonder to behold.) By the time Pilate sends Christ to him, Herod is a drunken wreck who can only mock the Truth he has rejected, and sends Him back to Pilate."
