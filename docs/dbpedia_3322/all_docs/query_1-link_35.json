        "text": "American actor (1955–2017)\n\nFor other people named Miguel Ferrer, see Miguel Ferrer (disambiguation).\n\nMiguel José Ferrer (February 7, 1955[1] – January 19, 2017) was an American actor. His breakthrough role was as Bob Morton in the 1987 film RoboCop. Other film roles include Harbinger in Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993), Quigley in Blank Check, Eduardo Ruiz in Traffic (2000) and Vice President Rodriguez in Iron Man 3 (2013). Ferrer's notable television roles include FBI Agent Albert Rosenfield on Twin Peaks (1990–1991, 2017), Dr. Garret Macy on Crossing Jordan (2001–2007) and NCIS Assistant Director Owen Granger on NCIS: Los Angeles (2012–2017).\n\nFerrer also performed voice acting in animated projects, including Shan Yu in Mulan (1998), Tarakudo on Jackie Chan Adventures (2000–2005), and Vandal Savage in Young Justice (2010-2012).\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nFerrer was born on February 7, 1955, in Santa Monica, California. He was the oldest of five children born to Puerto Rican actor José Ferrer and American singer Rosemary Clooney.[2]\n\nFerrer's siblings were sisters Maria and Monsita, and brothers Gabriel (later the husband of singer Debby Boone) and actor Rafael. He also had an older half-sister, Letty (Leticia) Ferrer, from his father José's prior marriage to Uta Hagen. Ferrer was a cousin of actor George Clooney and nephew of journalist Nick Clooney.\n\nFerrer was raised in Hollywood and Beverly Hills and attended Beverly Hills High School.[3] As a teenager, his interests tended toward music; he played the drums on Keith Moon's Two Sides of the Moon.[4] After high school, Ferrer studied acting at the Beverly Hills Playhouse.[5]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nFerrer's friend Bill Mumy cast him as a drummer in the series Sunshine, his first television role.[6] Ferrer was also Mumy's bandmate in Seduction of the Innocent, a band that also consisted of Steve Leialoha, and Max Allan Collins.[7] Sharing a love of comics Ferrer and Mumy co-created Comet Man and Trypto the Acid Dog plus co-wrote the Marvel Graphic Novel The Dreamwalker.[8]\n\nFerrer began his acting career in the early 1980s, making guest appearances on episodic television. He played the younger version of his father's character on Magnum, P.I. in 1981. In 1983, he was given a small part as a waiter in The Man Who Wasn't There. He also had a minor role in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984) as the U.S.S. Excelsior helm officer. In 1984, he directed the Mark Medoff play “When Ya Coming Back, Red Ryder?” at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami, Florida. He had a major role in the 1987 action film RoboCop as the corporate executive Bob Morton, the young, ambitious executive of Omni Consumer Products' Security Concepts and project leader of the RoboCop program.\n\nFerrer's notable later roles include a sinister biker in Valentino Returns, an overzealous engineer in DeepStar Six (1989), a resourceful vigilante in Revenge (1990), Commander Arvid Harbinger in the comedy Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993), Lloyd Henreid in the Stephen King miniseries The Stand (1994), and a drug informant in Traffic (2000). He occasionally took on lead parts as well, such as The Harvest and The Night Flier.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Ferrer appeared on three primetime TV series simultaneously: as D.A. Todd Spurrier in Shannon's Deal (1989–1991), as Cajun cop Beau Jack Bowman in Broken Badges (1990–1991), and as cynical, wittily abrasive FBI forensics specialist Albert Rosenfield in Twin Peaks (1990–91). Ferrer reprised the role of Rosenfield in the film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992). Ferrer played a super-villain called \"The Weatherman\" in the failed 1997 TV pilot, Justice League of America. Later in the same year, he provided the voice for a similar character, the Weather Wizard, in the Superman: The Animated Series episode \"Speed Demons\". In 1999, Ferrer voiced Aquaman in another Superman: Animated episode, \"A Fish Story.\" The same year, at the 41st Grammy Awards, Ferrer was nominated for \"Best Spoken Word Album for Children\" in Disney's The Lion King II, \"Simba's Pride Read-Along.\" He was also the protagonist of the American rock band Toto's music video for the song \"I Will Remember\", appearing alongside actor Edward James Olmos.\n\nFerrer again played a medical examiner on the small screen, Dr. Garret Macy, in the television crime/drama series Crossing Jordan (2001–07). In August 2003, Ferrer made his New York stage debut in the off-Broadway production of The Exonerated.[9] In 2004, Ferrer performed as the voice of the Heretic leader in the video game Halo 2. Ferrer took voice-over roles in the TV series Robot Chicken (2006) and American Dad! (2007). He played Jonas Bledsoe on NBC's Bionic Woman series and in 2009 also starred in another NBC series, Kings, as a military commander of Gath.\n\nFerrer played Los Angeles Police Lieutenant Felix Valdez in the 2011 Lifetime police procedural drama, The Protector. Also, in 2011, he had a multiple-episode guest role on the final season of Desperate Housewives. Signed to a recurring role in NCIS: Los Angeles as Naval Criminal Investigative Service Assistant Director Owen Granger, Ferrer was promoted to a series regular for the fifth season on February 6, 2013.[10] He also appeared in the 2013 film Iron Man 3 as the Vice President. Ferrer reprised his role of Albert Rosenfield in the 2017 revival of Twin Peaks.[11]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 19, 2017, Ferrer died at his Santa Monica home from heart failure and complications of throat cancer at the age of 61.[11][12][13] At the time of his death, Ferrer was married to producer Lori Weintraub. He had two sons and two stepsons.[14]\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nMiguel O'Hara, the alter ego of the Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man 2099, was named after Ferrer by his friend, writer Peter David, who co-created the character.[7]\n\nThe seventh episode of Young Justice: Outsiders was dedicated to him. Ferrer had voiced the character Vandal Savage in the first two seasons of Young Justice. As a result of his death, David Kaye took over Ferrer's role as Savage as well as his role as Jonathan Rook/Stretch Monster in Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters.[15]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1982 Truckin' Buddy McCoy Pete 1982 And They Are Off 1983 Heartbreaker Angel 1983 The Man Who Wasn't There Waiter 1984 Star Trek III: The Search for Spock USS Excelsior helm officer 1984 Flashpoint Roget 1984 Lovelines Dragon 1987 RoboCop Bob Morton 1989 Deepstar Six Snyder 1989 Valentino Returns Sinister biker 1990 Revenge Amador 1990 The Guardian Ralph Hess 1992 Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me Albert Rosenfield 1992 The Harvest Charlie Pope 1993 Cigarettes & Coffee Bill Short film 1993 Point of No Return Director Kaufman 1993 Hot Shots!
