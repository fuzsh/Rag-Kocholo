        "text": "A play in which show business feeds on itself can be as fascinating to watch as a snake devouring its own tail. The theatrical double entendres and insider innuendos that the populist-minded playwright Terrence McNally serves up in the newly updated version of his 1986 work “It’s Only a Play” (at the Gerald Schoenfeld) go around and around and come at you so fast and furiously that you may feel, at times, like a baby being startled out of the hiccups—your laughter is part of your surprise. But when the antics die down, and this two-and-a-half-hour circus has packed it in for the night, what stays with you? Some indelible performances, Scott Pask’s Art Deco Fred-and-Ginger set, Jack O’Brien’s unostentatious direction of a script that would be more effective as a one-act, McNally’s tinsel-and-barbed-wire view of stardom, and a sense that, sooner or later, show business turns everyone into an asshole.\n\nJames Wicker (the capital Nathan Lane) is a successful TV actor who’s high on his own glamour. We meet him as he walks into a grand boudoir, where a young out-of-work performer named Gus (Micah Stock, who overdoes some of his babe-in-the-woods vocal inflections) is making a call to the sleazy guy who recommended that he check coats at this high-powered Broadway opening-night party. Gus is so excited: this is his first night in New York, and, with guests like Al Pacino and Denzel Washington in the sitting room downstairs, anything could happen. In his too short white waiter’s jacket, the blithe, guileless Gus walks into every situation head first, as if his non-thoughts were propelling him forward. James, on the other hand, moves slowly, almost sinuously, like thick sediment settling in a water-filled bottle. His dark-clad silhouette stands out against the glossiness of the sleek silver chamber. On the bed is a light-colored satin throw, the pearl-gray carpets blend into the gray walls, and off in a corner is a chrome exercise bike. Snow falling from a silvery-blue sky beyond the picture windows completes the image of Gotham glimmer. The room’s decorator seems to have been inspired by the crystalline universe you can find in a snowflake.\n\nWhen Gus goes to get James a drink, James calls his agent—every actor’s best friend—and dives right into dishing the opening-night performance: “Darling, what is your traditional Thanksgiving dinner? Well, this one is a three-hundred-pound Butterball. Bernadette Peters asked me what I thought at intermission, and all I did was flap my arms and go ‘Gobble, gobble.’ ” The show is called, unfortunately, “The Golden Egg” and was written by James’s best friend, Peter Austin (Matthew Broderick, sweet but a little weary-seeming), and produced by the host of the party, Julie Budder (pleasingly played by Megan Mullally), a steely featherbrain who believes that she can bring meaning to Broadway. James was supposed to be the show’s star, but he had already decamped for a more profitable life on the West Coast.\n\nIn short order, Virginia Noyes (the hilarious, one-of-a-kind Stockard Channing) enters, in a floor-length black dress. Virginia is in mourning not so much for her life as for her career, which is more or less the same thing, at least in her mind. “The Golden Egg” marks her return to the stage after a number of movie flops and a run-in with the law. Virginia hobbles while she walks—turns out she’s wearing an ankle monitor. But her past sins are nothing compared with the excitement she feels when she indulges in her present ones, which include nose-hoovering up the coke she’s spilled on her fur coat. Channing plays the part as it should be played—like an even more crazily craven Tallulah Bankhead, right down to the russet, shoulder-length hair and the deep-fried self-regard. “The Golden Egg” may be Virginia’s comeback, but she’s so far gone in her actressy vanity that, even if she were pressed, she wouldn’t be able to tell you who she actually is: she’s simply the sum of her bad parts. And, like James, she speaks perfect show business. “El Diario just came in,” she announces. “I asked Rosie Perez to translate. She said, ‘Girl, you don’t want me to do that.’ ”\n\nAlthough the boudoir is an offstage space, so to speak, there is no such thing for these hustlers of their own histrionics, who are always looking over one famous shoulder toward another. In this issue-free pantomime of attitudes and archetypes, McNally exploits what Betty Comden and Adolph Green chuckled about ruefully in the song “Drop That Name,” from their 1956 musical “Bells Are Ringing”:\n\nJosé Ferrer and Janet Blair and Fred Astaire and Vincent Minelli,\n\nDaniel Mann and Lynn Fontanne, Elia Kazan, the former Grace Kelly,\n\nLouie Schurr and Courtney Burr and Irving Lazar,\n\nAnthony Quinn . . . And Rin Tin Tin! . . .\n\nThat’s the way you play the game.\n\nDrop that name!\n\nJames has the power here—TV trumps the stage; it’s not so old—and yet his life is missing some essential element, some kind of fascination or allure. He feels a little left out when Virginia and Julie and their boys—including the dyspeptic critic Ira Drew (F. Murray Abraham, in the play’s most underwritten part) and “The Golden Egg” ’s maddeningly perverse director, Frank Finger (Rupert Grint, doing too much with too little)—get excited about a script that they think may put them back on top.\n\nLike Dickens, who painted a vibrant portrait of the theatrical world in “Nicholas Nickleby,” McNally knows how stage troupes come together and fall apart. (He also knows how stars do and don’t work collaboratively, as evinced in his beautiful 1995 play “Master Class.”) And he understands this about the business that he’s called home for nearly half a century now: in the theatre, everything is performance and renewed hope—even for the critics.\n\nBroadway production values often drown out a script as good as Simon Stephens’s “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time” (a National Theatre production, at the Ethel Barrymore), which was adapted from Mark Haddon’s acclaimed 2003 novel. But the British director Marianne Elliott, a fresh voice on the American scene—she won a Tony in 2011, for her direction of “War Horse”—doesn’t allow the usual bump and grind of Broadway to get in the way of the story that Stephens means to tell. Elliott knows that audiences whose attention spans have been shaped by TV will feed on the synthetic and the shiny. When she needs extra voltage for a scene—for instance, at the beginning of the drama, when a dog is stabbed with a pitchfork, thereby setting in motion the mystery that Christopher Boone (Alex Sharp), a functional autistic teen-ager, will attempt to solve—she uses all the tools available to her, including fast and hard light cues and an ominous, Trent Reznor-ish soundtrack. But she never loses control, and, in the quieter moments, she explores the story’s subtle insights—about outsiderness, parenting, and how stripping metaphor out of language (Christopher takes everything literally) can make us experience words differently.\n\nThe only unfortunate moments in the piece occur when the lone black cast member, Jocelyn Bioh, appears as that old entertainment-industry standby the testy or dismissive black woman, first in Christopher’s home town, Swindon, and then during a journey he takes to London in search of his mother, who abandoned him. The story is, at heart, a sentimental one, but in Elliott’s hands we don’t feel manipulated, or, at least, not cynically so. She is trying to make show business matter in a way that transcends mere entertainment, and so is the nimble and poetic Alex Sharp.\n\nA recent graduate of the Juilliard School, Sharp knows that acting should be both an exploration of character and an exploration of self. But so few performers are able to pull this off that, when one succeeds, it generates deep audience wonder: how many of us can say that we truly know our inner selves as well as the fictional selves we project, let alone manage to combine the two? Sharp loves acting the way the autistic Christopher loves math. His discriminating work reminds us that performers on Broadway—when they’re not being used, primarily, for their box-office draw—can be canny showoffs, full of possibility, inventiveness, and vision. ♦"
