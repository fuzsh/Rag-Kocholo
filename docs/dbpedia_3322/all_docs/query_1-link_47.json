        "text": "I feel extremely fortunate to have worked with Miguel Ferrer on Twin Peaks: The Return\n\nFor so many reasons. All of the impossibly wonderful things you hear about him are all true. Because most of my scenes involved him, I had the marvelous experience of getting to know his wit, thoughtfulness and charisma first hand.\n\nIt was easy to love Miguel. First, it was his eyes—warm, wise, and gentle. Then it was his voice—like the smoothest Scotch poured over jagged rocks. Then it was the stuff he said and the way he listened. Here’s the thing with Miguel: he’s a good guy. A sweetheart. Not a pushover, sharp as a nail—and you could feel it in his hugs; he was the real deal.\n\nCB, Miguel and David in Twin Peaks: The Return.\n\nPeople Don’t Like To Work On Saturdays\n\nMiguel was playing a lead character, Owen Granger, on NCIS: Los Angeles while we were filming Twin Peaks : The Return. The absolute only way that David could get Miguel on the show was if the crew agreed to work on Saturdays as his weekdays were taken with his other gig. This crew was already working long hours in a high pressure situation. Weekends are coveted. This was not a welcomed proposition and David couldn’t, wouldn’t force anyone to do it. Everyone had to be on board. But David had a way, and Twin Peaks : The Return had a Destiny, and Miguel was a part of it. Every cast member and crew member were a part of it. We all felt it was something quite special and rare. If there was any degree of push back initially, it soon evaporated. I would bet a bag of gold that not a single crew member or cast member that may have have been disappointed to work a bunch of Saturdays regrets doing it. Albert Rosenfield brings something so great and singular to the world of Twin Peaks, and we were all so blessed to create art with him. Saturdays were a minuscule sacrifice. We were given a profound gift.\n\nChrystabell and Miguel Ferrer in a still from Twin Peaks. Photo: Suzanne Tenner/SHOWTIME\n\nVenerated actor Jose Ferrer.\n\nMiguel as Albert on Twin Peaks: The Return\n\nI loved seeing how Miguel and David had a soulful connection and deep mutual appreciation and respect. They didn’t spend much time together in everyday reality, but that is perhaps one reason why David put so much energy into bringing Twin Peaks back: because he would get to spend quality time with so many people he was fond of. It was an absolute joy and incredible gift to have been able to share so much time with David and Miguel on set. I did not take one moment of it for granted. I had no idea that Miguel would not be in his body much longer at the time we were filming, but the level of reverence I felt for the opportunity of working with him was inherently present. I looked forward to his good hugs. I loved giving him big smiles after his fantastic deliveries. On set we were pals and also he was a mentor for me, and on the show he was my senior colleague I wanted to impress and I admired him greatly. Albert looked out for Tammy and Miguel looked out for Chrystabell. Don’t get me started how the dynamics between the characters in Twin Peaks were so (seemingly mystically) aligned with the people playing the roles – to the degree my mouth hangs open in awe when I think about it. Twin Peaks : The Return and practically everything about it is steeped in cosmic alignment. I think this has everything to do with David being a meditator for more than 40 years. The veil is butterfly- wing- thin between art and reality. And the ice cream on the cherry pie is that Miguel gave a parting gift to the Twin Peaks family and we have it to cherish forever more."
