        "text": "The approach of the fire works season heralds also that other annual summer phenomenon—the lighting up of summer theaters across the land. Indeed, though the strawhat theater circuit may be in a semicoma on Long Island, the condition hardly is symptomatic of the rest of the country.\n\nAlthough no one in his right mind indulges any more in such cornball slogans as the season will be bigger and better than ever, the fact remains that, aside from Long Island, the picture has been fairly well stabilized. Actors Equity Association, which governs the employ ment of professional actors, can say at press time that it expects to have bonds posted by between 150 to 200 thea ters this summer. Or just about as many as there have been for some years now.\n\nHitting the citronella trail (a leftover descriptive from the days when many of the summer playhouses were set up in barns and such) will be the usual coven of stars, some on the rise, some on the slide, all anxious for a little hay to tide them over the usual show‐business slack. Jose Ferrer will be seen once again as Cyrano, a role in which he glowed back in the nineteen‐forties and fifties, only this time there will be a score to em bellish the shenanigans; Sada Thompson, for years known as an actor's actor until she caught both the public and critical eye in “The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man‐in‐the Moon Marigolds” will be around In “Twigs” in which she won acclaim on Broad way and subsequently on a national tour; Jerry Orbach, recently seen on Broadway in “6 Rms Riv Vu” will be taking the comedy on a whirl. Among other names on the summer billboards will be Brian Bedford in “But ley,” Art Carney in “The Prisoner of Second Avenue” and Wilfrid Hyde‐Whyte in “The Jockey Club Stakes.”\n\nBut nary a one of these will be available on Long Is land. The truth is that Island ers in quest of straight pro fessional theater — comedy, drama, farce or whodunit—will have to forage most dili gently to satisfy their wants. Yet, it wasn't always thus. To be sure, there never had been quite the proliferation of theaters in the area as say on the Cape in Massa chusetts but there were enough dotting the landscape, such as those in Sea Cliff, Mineola, East Hampton, Northport, Atlantic Beach, Long Beach and Bellport.\n\nSo, what happened? Well, it is easy enough to say that Mineola went over to films, Sea Cliff and the Red Barn in Northport burned down, that the John Drew in East Hampton has had to severely limit its play production this season because the experi mental productions offered in recent years failed to find audiences and the costs are too prohibitive to go back to a resident company.\n\nCosts, whether they be for a resident company or for those “packages” in which the stars appear, are pretty nearly prohibitive not only in the summer theater but also on Broadway and Off Broadway.\n\nJames McKenzie, a veteran of some 30 years in the sum mer theater business and now operating the venerable Westport Country Playhouse in Connecticut, reports that he will have to play to be tween 80 and 85 per cent of capacity to break even. And, he says, he dare not raise his prices. Still, he is offering an 11‐week season that in cludes tryouts of at least two new plays, and he happily discloses, “We're 15 per cent ahead of our advance Sales over last season.”\n\nGetting back to East Hampton, one observer sees the problem compounded by factors other than simply costs and the type of plays offered. He points out that it is the scene itself that has been altered.\n\n“What has been lost,” he said, “are the theatergoers themselves, the old families in those large houses who had “roots in the community. Going to the John Drew was an event, it was a place around which part of their social lives revolved. Today you have a lot of transients in the area, people with fami lies who are vacationing and they have the same problems about baby‐sitters and such as they have at home.\n\n“And there are those groupies on the scene, young people chipping in for a sea son to inhabit many of those big houses mostly on week ends. They're more interested in their cookouts after a day at the beach and how many parties they can line up for an evening than in taking themselves to the theater.”\n\nUnderscoring this theme is William E. Hunt who oper ated the Red Barn in North port for years before it burned down.\n\n“There's been a decided change in the makeup of the island as a whole,” he said. “Much of the Island is resi dential, not resort, and sum mer theater generally does best in resort areas like on the Cape or in Maine.\n\nBroadway Oriented\n\n“What you have on the Island are a lot of refugees from the city. They're work ers, a lot of them in the city, and they're harder to sell. They're big ‐city oriented, Broadway hit oriented. They don't seem to have the same interest in the theater that people used to.”\n\nMr. Hunt also thinks that another problem confronting summer theater on Long Is land is transportation. “Have you ever been in those week end traffic jams?” he asks rhetorically. “They're enough to discourage anyone from traveling any distance to see theater.”\n\nThese assorted reasons for the diminished number of professional theaters on the island appear sound enough. In themselves they are un doubtedly deterrents. But what really is working against any rebirth of activi ty is the cost of land. “Real estate is incredibly invalu able” says Mr. McKenzie, “whether it be on Long Is land or elsewhere. Where theaters exist on land that is owned outright or where mortgage costs are minimal, having been obtained years ago, it is possible to carry on. But you can't start from scratch. You simply cannot pay for the necessary land, build a theater and Moe to make money in t limited sea son of 10 or 12 weeks.\n\nDoomed though the future may be for straight profes sional theater on the Island, those who seek the lighter side of entertainment—musi cals and such—are far from a subsistence diet, Lee Guber and Shelly Gross who oper ate the Westbury Music Fair, report that last year their venture grossed approximate ly $650,000 and this season is likely to do as well if not better.\n\nWestbury, which now pro vides 40 weeks of entertain ment—it used to do 12—mixes a formula of ‘erstwhile Broadway musical hits such as “Applause,” “Anything Goes” and “The Unsinkable Molly Brown” (on this sea son's schedule) with appear ances of Shecky Greene, Dan ny Thomas and Johnny Mathis.\n\nThe Jones Beach Theater, where Guy Lombardo has been functioning since 1954, is giving out reports that are equally as cheerful as those from Westbury. This season's presentation of “Carousel” appears to be a winner, al ready having piled up an ad vance of $285,000."
