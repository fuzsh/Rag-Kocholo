        "text": "Jose Ferrer, renowned as the cool, cerebral and idiosyncratic actor who won an Academy Award playing Cyrano de Bergerac, died yesterday at Doctors' Hospital in Coral Gables, Fla.\n\nA family spokesman gave his age as 80, although some reference works said he was 83. He was a resident of Miami. His family said he died after a brief illness but did not disclose its nature.\n\nVersatility, intelligence and longevity were the hallmarks of his extraordinary career in entertainment. He was successful as an award-winning actor and a producer, writer and director, and was a musician as well.\n\n\"Jack of all trades, and master of most of them,\" commented David Shipman in his book \"The Great Movie Stars\" (St. Martin's, 1972). Broadway Return Called Off\n\nMr. Ferrer's work spanned the stage, films and television for more than half a century. He had planned a return to Broadway this spring, starring opposite Judd Hirsch in \"Conversations With My Father,\" but his name was removed from the marquee because of his failing health.\n\nTo sample the breadth of his work: He organized a successful cruise ship band in college, played Iago to Paul Robeson's Othello, appeared in the original television pilot of \"Kojak,\" sang opera at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Beverly Hills Opera, and made guest appearances on the \"Newhart\" series.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
