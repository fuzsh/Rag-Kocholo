        "meta_description": "I have been watching today the movie 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' Starring Jose Ferrer. I was spooked as he reminded me so much of Van Diesel of modern actors today. Deciding to find out if Jose Ferrer is Van Diesels Father. I can across the fact that Van Diesel does not know who his biological father is and has a fraternal twin. My question now is: Could they be related? Is Jose Van's Dad? Jose Ferrer dated quite a lot in his time and the Van Mother may could have had a liason during that time. Please could you supply to back to back photo's to show them together. Also, Van's acting and is similar and Voice is spot on. It' freaky! But I'm interested to see a connection.",
