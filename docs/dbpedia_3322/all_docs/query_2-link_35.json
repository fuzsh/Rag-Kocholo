        "text": "CHAPTER 1\n\nThe Many Sides of José Ferrer\n\nONE OF ACADEMY AWARD-WINNER JOSÉ FERRER’S REGRETS WAS THAT he never appeared in burlesque or vaudeville. Those might have been the only theatrical feats that the prodigiously talented Ferrer didn’t accomplish, since he began in the arts as a gifted young pianist, then became the leader of his college jazz band, and later, in both stage and subsequently film, found success as an actor, director, producer, and writer. Ferrer also loved to sing, and he achieved limited success as an opera singer in the early 1960s. The versatile Ferrer even appeared onstage in a ballet, dancing the role of the doctor in a 1963 production of Coppelia for the Royal Poinciana Playhouse. He also realized his dream of being a Broadway musical star as the lead in Noël Coward’s The Girl Who Came to Supper (1963), and as a temporary replacement for Richard Kiley in the Broadway hit Man of La Mancha (1966), followed by a lengthy tour.\n\nIn his prime, from the mid-1940s to the late 1950s, José Ferrer was everywhere—he possessed energy enough for three men. Ferrer reached an artistic peak in 1952: he was simultaneously represented on Broadway by three plays that he had produced and directed, Stalag 17, The Fourposter, and The Shrike (the last of which he also starred in), while his movies from that year, Moulin Rouge and Anything Can Happen, were playing in neighborhood cinemas. At any given point in the early 1950s, Ferrer might be acting in a Broadway play, directing a play, preparing to direct a play, working on an adaptation, securing the rights to a play—and when Hollywood beckoned, he would add film roles to his already crowded theatrical output.\n\nFerrer was also the first actor to receive the US National Medal of Arts and the first Puerto Rican actor to be honored with his own commemorative stamp by the US Postal Service. It might be surprising to learn that Ferrer was born in Puerto Rico, especially since some of his most widely known roles were as French historical figures, including the poet/swordsman Cyrano de Bergerac, the artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec in Moulin Rouge, the Dauphin in Joan of Arc, and the unjustly persecuted Captain Dreyfus in I Accuse! Yet Ferrer was proud of his Puerto Rican heritage and conscious of his influence on his fellow Puerto Ricans. He was equally proud of being an American. Even so, Ferrer has never been the subject of a major work that encompassed both his celebrated career and turbulent life—until now.\n\nIt might be that in spite of (or maybe because of) his early success, many found it hard to warm to Ferrer. Although his friends knew him as Joe, the public and several of his peers believed Ferrer was a little cold and arrogant, with an expertise that some felt was all show and little heart. Lyricist and future collaborator Alan Jay Lerner (Ferrer would direct Lerner’s 1979 Broadway musical Carmelina!) wrote that while he admired Ferrer’s talent, he felt that the actor had the soul of a pistachio nut. Veteran character actor H. M. Wynant recalled Ferrer attending a 1949 Chicago production of High Button Shoes (Wynant was in the chorus) and after the performance, Ferrer summoned the cast and admonished them: \"Don’t get into the business unless you get in as a star—otherwise you’ll be treated like shit!\" These were not particularly encouraging words for then-chorus member Wynant, who had aspirations beyond the chorus which have since been more than realized.\n\nYet there were those who admired Ferrer both personally and professionally and believed him to be a prodigiously talented and magnanimous figure. Actress and producer Jean Dalrymple, who was one of the founding members of New York City Center, remembered how Ferrer volunteered to commit to a season of revivals in the early 1950s to help the struggling City Center overcome mounting financial pressures. Writer and director Garson Kanin thought there was no limit to what he could do as an actor. Kanin’s wife, Marian Seldes, who knew Ferrer as both actor and director, felt that as a director, he made you believe he could do anything. Even Wynant said: I consider him one of the major American actors and have the utmost respect for him and his work.\n\nFerrer is perhaps best known for Cyrano de Bergerac, in which he appeared as the flamboyant yet insecure swordsman and poet who is all nobility and self-sacrifice when it comes to satisfying his true love, Roxane, even supplying his handsome rival Christian with the words and voice needed to capture her affections. Delivering Rostand’s lines in his expressive baritone, it was a career-defining performance for Ferrer, both in 1946, when he starred in the revival on Broadway (eclipsing Walter Hampden’s fondly remembered earlier incarnation as Cyrano) and won the Tony Award, and in 1950, when he starred in the film version and won the Oscar for Best Actor. He also revisited the role in 1955 for a live television broadcast, and this performance garnered him an Emmy nomination, making Ferrer the first actor to be nominated for all three major acting awards for the same role.\n\nYet there is a great deal more to José Ferrer, both in theater and film, and away from the spotlight, too. Early in his career, he had been mentored by such theatrical luminaries as Jed Harris, Guthrie McClintic, and Joshua Logan, the last of whom was a schoolmate of Ferrer’s at Princeton University. It was Logan who cast Ferrer in the 1940 revival of the low-comedy hit, Charley’s Aunt, gaining both of them praise and making Ferrer a bona fide star. He might have continued as a comedy actor, but he was not content to do so. Ferrer always felt the need to stretch himself and his talents; his later wife Rosemary Clooney would say he didn’t know how to tell himself no. (As it turned out, that would apply to Ferrer in areas outside of professional life as well.) He co-directed an unsuccessful play called Vickie, and in 1943, succeeded Danny Kaye in Cole Porter’s Let’s Face It. His biggest theatrical triumph of that year would be as Iago in director Margaret Webster’s production of Othello, a success both on Broadway and in its subsequent tour. He would also attract the attention of Hollywood, particularly from writer/director Billy Wilder, who was interested in hiring Ferrer to play the alcoholic writer in The Lost Weekend. Although Wilder wanted Ferrer, he didn’t get the role, as Paramount and Wilder settled on actor Ray Milland, who was under contract to the studio at that time.\n\nFerrer’s next stage triumph would be in Cyrano, which resulted in Hollywood courting him, and in 1948 he made his film debut as the Dauphin in Joan of Arc under the direction of Victor Fleming. He was nominated for an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor for his theatrical and entertaining performance, providing much-needed spark to the mostly lumbering proceedings. At this point, Ferrer’s predominant passion was the theater, as he was either directing, adapting, or performing in classics by Chekhov and O’Neill. Ferrer would acquire a reputation as a theatrical dynamo—and it didn’t hurt that many of his early ventures achieved success, including his turn as a philosophical older gentleman in The Silver Whistle.\n\nFerrer’s theatrical career alone merits attention, particularly his fertile period from the mid-1940s through the late 1950s. In 1950, Ferrer directed and starred in a successful revival of Twentieth Century and immediately followed that with the hit Stalag 17 (which he prepared while starring in Twentieth Century). His well-received staging of The Fourposter in 1952 segued into a darker exploration of marriage with The Shrike. Horton Foote’s The Chase, directed by Ferrer, proved to be a commercial and artistic failure, but it reflected Ferrer’s willingness to take on serious, socially relevant material, as he had done with his direction of the 1946 drama Strange Fruit, which addressed the topic of race relations through the story of a doomed interracial romance.\n\nAlthough money was essential to Ferrer—as soon as he became rich and famous, he cultivated a lavish lifestyle complete with multiple residences and an appetite for the finer things—he was still capable of magnanimous gestures (a la Cyrano). Ferrer might turn down a role because it didn’t come with the right price tag, but on two separate occasions, in 1948 and 1953, he would commit himself—for roughly $85 per week—to staging and starring in a series of shows for the then-struggling New York City Center. Ferrer’s involvement in the 1953 season, which included revivals of Cyrano and The Shrike, assured the theater of its first profitable season.\n\nThroughout this period of Ferrer’s career, the critics were effusive in their praise of Ferrer, both as director and actor. As a director, reviewers praised his choice of material, his excellence with the actors, and the occasional innovative staging; as an actor, the critics generally focused on his rich, resonant baritone, which could be quite a flexible instrument, as he could utilize it to move you, amuse you, or even arouse you. If Ferrer and Cyrano are identified as one, it is because they both possessed sheer bravado and a willingness to test themselves. These passions could also lead them astray. In Cyrano’s case, his loyalty to Roxane and his uncompromising nature come at a great personal cost. For Ferrer, his passions might lead him to alienate those who might otherwise employ him or cause emotional damage to those who had counted on his fidelity, both personally and professionally. It is this dichotomy, which I will return to later, that also makes Ferrer an ideal, if occasionally troubling, biographical subject.\n\nAs a director, Ferrer was primarily identified with his staging of dramas, but he could be quite adept (if sometimes a little heavy-handed) with his handling of comedy. In addition to his successful staging of Twentieth Century, Ferrer directed My 3 Angels, a Broadway hit in 1953 starring Walter Slezak, in which three Devil’s Island convicts, a hapless family, rapacious relations, and a helpful snake elicited gales of laughter from appreciative Broadway audiences. In 1958, Ferrer would direct (and cowrite the libretto for) skilled farceur Tony Randall in Oh, Captain!, a musical remake of The Captain’s Paradise.\n\nDuring this prolific period, Ferrer would alternate between the stage and the more financially rewarding film work. He would be—with one notable exception—in fairly high demand for either acting or directing chores during most of the 1950s. Ferrer would win his one and only Oscar for reprising Cyrano for the screen, and would receive another nomination for his portrayal of the tormented artist Toulouse-Lautrec (as well as portraying the artist’s demanding father) in John Huston’s sumptuous 1952 production of Moulin Rouge. Ferrer impressed as the hopeful Georgian immigrant Giorgi Papashvily in Anything Can Happen (1952), the reluctant defense counsel Barney Greenwald in The Caine Mutiny (1954), and the composer Sigmund Romberg in the all-star 1954 musical biography Deep in My Heart (fulfilling another dream to sing—and dance somewhat—on screen).\n\nPerhaps his only cinematic misstep in the early 1950s was when Ferrer bellowed and pontificated his way as a judgmental, intolerant would-be savior opposite party girl Rita Hayworth’s Miss Sadie Thompson. Yet Ferrer’s participation in this 1953 Columbia release was essential to his maintaining his status in Hollywood. Prior to this film, Ferrer had been called before the House Un-American Activities Committee, as he had been named as a suspected communist in the publication Red Channels. In May 1951, Ferrer testified twice before the committee. He chose not to plead the Fifth Amendment, instead electing to explain the causes he supported, the speeches he made, the meetings he attended—all while praising the work of HUAC. It was neither a triumphant nor disastrous appearance, but the fact that Ferrer was not cleared immediately would lead some producers to reconsider casting him and cause many on both sides of the political fence to picket him. This will be explored at length, as well as how Ferrer’s involvement in Miss Sadie Thompson helped restore him to Hollywood’s good graces.\n\nFerrer made his film directorial debut with the 1955 screen version of The Shrike, earning favorable notices both for his performance as well as his choice of June Allyson in an atypical role as the shrewish wife. (He also took some heat for softening the play’s bleak ending.) His only commercially successful directorial effort in the 1950s was the 1955 fact-based World War II drama The Cockleshell Heroes. While the film received praise, especially for its suspenseful second half, Ferrer the director became involved in some post-production one-upmanship with the producers and departed abruptly. Ferrer would be granted a degree of autonomy for his 1950s films, but he was still at the producers’ mercy when it came to final cut—a development that he would continually lament in interviews through the years. In 1956, director Ferrer and writer Al Morgan would adapt Morgan’s novel The Great Man, making it an intelligent exploration of the darker side of both celebrity and the media. Ferrer would be applauded for enticing Ed Wynn into making his first dramatic appearance. In 1958, Ferrer directed and starred in the comedy The High Cost of Loving for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, then journeyed to England to make a film version of the Dreyfus scandal, I Accuse!, having been denied permission from the French government to shoot in France, where the events depicted in the film had actually taken place.\n\nAlthough Ferrer was still enjoying some success in films, his stage fortunes took a gradual turn for the worse. In 1958, Oh Captain! did not become the long-running success its creators and investors (including Ferrer) had anticipated. Ferrer immediately followed that with Edwin Booth, but despite his performance, direction, as well as his showmanship in attempting to attract the public, the expected audiences failed to materialize. The Andersonville Trial was a qualified success on Broadway in 1959, despite the harsh subject matter regarding offenses and conditions at a Civil War prison camp. His 1959 production of Juno received middling notices and closed soon after its opening. Ferrer would say on numerous occasions that his career went into freefall after the 1950s. Although he still found employment as an actor, and even sporadically as a director, Ferrer would never again reach the heights of sustained excellence and activity he enjoyed in the 1950s.\n\nYet Ferrer persevered, trying to remain employable by always being the consummate professional; however, in interviews, he would unceasingly point out that he was mainly an actor for hire, without the creative freedom he had previously enjoyed. The 1950s and ’60s were also a time when he tried to get his own projects underway, including an adaptation of Death in Venice. Ferrer’s career would center mainly on film and television, both in low-to-medium budget efforts and in prestigious works from top-rank directors, including David Lean’s Lawrence of Arabia, Stanley Kramer’s Ship of Fools, and Billy Wilder’s Fedora; he also acquitted himself nicely in Woody Allen’s A Midsummer Night’s Sex Comedy, both amusingly pontificating and gently moving as the aging scholar. Here Ferrer also was allowed to indulge his love of singing (although many would tell him it’s an area where he could use improvement, he studied voice for many years). Projects like these did not come often enough, and his resume of the late 1960s through the 1990s consists of the occasional worthy effort offset by plenty of B-grade dramas, thrillers, and horror movies (of all kinds).\n\nFerrer did make time to return to the stage, but the results were variable. He finally landed a lead musical role on Broadway with 1963’s The Girl Who Came to Supper, with music and lyrics by Noël Coward, but in spite of their efforts (and Florence Henderson as the Girl), the show did not become a hit nor the annuity that Coward was anticipating. His desire to be a Broadway musical star was better served when he took over the role of Cervantes/Don Quixote in Man of La Mancha, replacing Richard Kiley for two weeks on Broadway in 1966, before embarking on a successful tour and followed by another limited run on Broadway as Don Quixote.\n\nThere were also several directorial endeavors, but only a few of these were for Broadway or off-Broadway engagements. Ferrer directed an adaptation of Thomas Wolfe’s work The Web and the Rock and the play White Pelicans, both for the Theater de Lys (to be renamed the Lucille Lortel Theater) and both critical and commercial failures. He also scored an off-Broadway triumph succeeding Elias Rabb in A Life in the Theater. Ferrer’s final foray on Broadway was in 1979 as the director of Carmelina, a troubled Alan Jay Lerner musical adaptation of the 1968 movie Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell that closed after a few performances. Toward the end of his life, Ferrer was cast as the lead in Conversations with My Father but had to withdraw because of illness. While his theatrical career had fallen from the heights he scaled in the 1950s, Ferrer rarely stopped working.\n\nJosé Ferrer: Success and Survival not only addresses the meteoric rise and gradual descent of Ferrer’s career but also the conflicting desires that led to several failed unions before his fifth and final marriage. His first marriage was in 1938 to the actress (and subsequent teacher and author) Uta Hagen. They met while onstage in summer stock, gave married life a chance, and produced a daughter. Ferrer and Hagen would also attempt to become a theatrical couple, not unlike Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, but a subsequent theatrical engagement would lead to their undoing. A very successful Broadway production of Othello, starring Paul Robeson (Othello), Ferrer (Iago), and Hagen (Desdemona), resulted in a national tour—and also sparked an affair between the married Robeson and Hagen. Seemingly unfazed by this, Ferrer, who had been seeing other women, began a relationship with the actress and dancer Phyllis Hill. After Ferrer and Hagen divorced in 1948 (partly the result of Ferrer and his private detectives surprising Hagen and Robeson on Christmas Eve), Ferrer married Hill.\n\nThat marriage was also doomed, since Ferrer made no apologies for his time-consuming passions—even if these were only for creative fulfillment, they still led to constant separations from wife Phyllis, who was ensconced in their house in upstate New York (aside from taking the occasional small role in a Ferrer-directed play). It was during this period that he began alternating between Hollywood and Broadway, with little time to build, let alone maintain, a relationship. Not long after Hill and Ferrer separated in 1951, Ferrer was seeing the singer Rosemary Clooney; what began as a casual affair deepened, so that when Ferrer finally divorced Phyllis in 1953, he married Clooney a few days later.\n\nFerrer and Clooney clicked on several levels—at first. Both had achieved success in their respective fields; he was a natural teacher and she wanted to learn. Clooney and Ferrer both wanted to have a large family. They were also in the midst of successful careers, but Clooney put hers on hold and devoted much of her time to raising the ever-expanding brood. (Clooney and Ferrer would have five children between 1955 and 1961.) Ferrer also made few apologies for desiring the occasional companion outside the homestead, which led to confrontations, compromises, and eventual reconciliations, at least for a time. Clooney and Ferrer separated in 1961, but after their initial divorce became final in 1962, they began to see each other again; Clooney was there for moral support when Ferrer took on the musical The Girl Who Came to Supper. They reconciled and eventually remarried in 1965, but personal and professional difficulties, including their respective affairs, exacerbated an already tenuous relationship and they divorced (for good) in 1967.\n\nFerrer would again find some contentment in the mid-1970s with his fifth and final wife, Stella Magee, who had been Ferrer’s personal secretary when he was filming in Europe in the early 1960s—and, as one will see later, had also been acquainted with Rosemary Clooney. Up until his death in 1992, Ferrer would shuttle between films and television, while also performing and directing onstage, usually far from Broadway; he would also later make his permanent residence in Florida. Ferrer received several honors during his lifetime, including an honorary doctorate from the University of Puerto Rico (1947) and his induction into the Theater Hall of Fame (1981). He also was the recipient of more honors posthumously, including becoming the first Puerto Rican actor to be honored on a postage stamp.\n\nFerrer was fearlessly versatile. Rosemary Clooney, as well as their daughter Monsita and son Rafael, would all say that he couldn’t accept the word no, so he would attempt to be the best in anything he tried, whether it was acting, directing, producing, or writing. Ferrer believed anyone could master anything so long as there was time to learn. For Ferrer, that included playing the piano, tennis, dancing, fencing, drawing, cooking, windsurfing, golf, and singing (including operatic stints in the 1960s).\n\nFerrer could be incredibly neglectful when it came to both his finances (which he professed to have little feel for) and relationships. He also fretted constantly that his current job would be the last, so that he could become intolerable during his bouts with unemployment—even if these periods were for a very short time. Ferrer could also be very generous, both with his time and talent. When Ferrer was in his seventies, he assumed creative control for the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Florida, accepting a token salary of $1 per year. He also never stopped being a champion of new authors, agreeing to star in promising works for minimal financial compensation.\n\nSeveral current actors would remember Ferrer with affection. Christopher Lloyd viewed Ferrer as a mentor from their time in the play White Pelicans, while Richard Thomas, who worked with Ferrer and got to know him through the Players Club, believed that Ferrer was one of the funniest men I’ve ever known and an incredible storyteller. Maria, one of the five children Ferrer had with Rosemary Clooney, remembered her father as being \"stupidly funny. He would do anything to make us laugh. We were in London at a white-tie dinner. There are dignitaries … he’s conversing in French. And while all this is going on, he takes his napkin and makes little rabbit ears jumping across the table—just enough so I could see it! Because of his exterior, people don’t understand how down to earth he was.\" José Ferrer: Success and Survival explores the many facets of Mr. Ferrer, an artist whose resilience enabled him to persevere through a lifetime’s worth of triumphs and disappointments—and then some.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nFrom Puerto Rico to Princeton and Performance\n\nIT WAS A GREAT SOURCE OF PRIDE THAT JOSÉ FERRER CAME FROM Puerto Rico—San Juan, to be precise. He was born José Vicente Ferrer de Otero y Cintron on January 8, 1912, in Santurce, a district in San Juan. The future actor/director was the son of wealthy, prominent parents. His father, Don Rafael Ferrer y Otero, was a lawyer, while his mother, Maria Providencia Cintron y Cintron, came from a family of plantation owners. The Ferrers were an aristocratic family, originally from Spain; this is indicated by Ferrer’s full name reflecting the Spanish tradition of adding the name of the mother to that of the child. Don Rafael and Maria lived in Puerto Rico because of their widespread financial interests there, and later became naturalized citizens of the United States. José would try to downplay his family’s wealth, saying, I suppose there was money in the family … my father had a good law practice and there were plantations on my mother’s side, but we weren’t rolling in wealth. This would be disputed by his own daughter Monsita, who assured me, They had enormous wealth … sugar cane, tons of property. When José was seven months old, he was taken to New York for an operation as he had been born with a soft palate. Had this been left untreated, José might have developed a speech impediment or experienced severe breathing difficulties.\n\nWhen José was six years old, the family returned to New York. His father had been a graduate of St. John’s College and later received his law degree from Syracuse University, while his mother Maria was an alumna of Sacred Heart College in Manhattanville, New York. Don Rafael and Maria felt that their children, including José and sisters Elvira and Leticia, should be educated in the United States. José attended Loyola High School; all three children were taught French, English, and Spanish. A voracious learner from an early age, José also enjoyed music and learned the piano. Their Aunt Monserrate lived with them for a time; she was Don Rafael’s sister and an accomplished composer and pianist in her own right. Monserrate would help José develop his talent, and his exceptional abilities suggested a possible career as a concert pianist. (Ferrer’s daughter would be named Monsita in honor of Monserrate).\n\nJosé graduated from Loyola High School at the age of fourteen and applied to Princeton University when he was fifteen. Ferrer easily passed the entrance exams. He also told the dean that he spoke three languages and could compose symphony scores by ear. In response, Princeton recommended that he complete another year of preparation to acquire some seasoning (some might call it a cooling-off period). Ferrer spent that time in Switzerland at a fashionable, elite private school known as the Institut Le Rosey. It was one of the world’s most expensive boarding schools, with the main campus in Rolle and the winter campus in Gstaad. Le Rosey would pride itself on its academic and athletic program; it also was known for its exemplary bilingual and bicultural education. Ferrer would later say that he learned some things at the school that proper young gentlemen weren’t supposed to know. The young José also added to his linguistic abilities, picking up German and Italian, in addition to Spanish, English, and French.\n\nFor the sixteen-year-old José, 1928 would prove to be an important year. He would finally be admitted to Princeton—and his mother Maria would unexpectedly pass away. José’s mother was an intelligent, adventurous woman, and she wanted her children to have these same attributes. As an affluent woman, it wouldn’t have been unusual for Maria to walk into José’s room (he was the oldest) and say, I’ve always wanted to go to Rome for Easter, and then leave with young José at her side. Although they had a governess, Maria would travel without her husband, with only the children by her side—as well as her personal physician, as she had a heart condition and did not want to be too far from medical assistance.\n\nIt was Maria who wanted the children to speak French, so she hired a governess who was French. While the older José would give his father much of the credit for his subsequent love for learning, his mother’s importance cannot be underestimated. Her passing left a void that José hoped his father could fill. José would attribute his energy and curiosity to his parents: It comes from having a mother and father who gave me a tremendous education … they inculcated a thirst for knowledge, inquisitiveness … to be as good as you can be. Don Rafael would remarry three years later, to Carolina Garcia Fuya, with whom he had another child, Rafael, who became José’s stepbrother, and would later attain fame as an artist himself.\n\nAt Princeton, Ferrer originally planned to focus on architecture. Although this was his intended course of study, the sixteen-year-old Ferrer, with his musical background and burgeoning flair for self-promotion, soon explored other avenues of academia—notably extracurricular. Borne of a desire to earn some money to supplement a small allowance, Ferrer formed a college band called José Ferrer and his Pied Pipers. Initially Ferrer’s combo was a six-piece dance band, with Ferrer himself playing the piano. According to Ferrer, I didn’t know what I was doing … it was during the Depression when big orchestras weren’t in demand. No one could afford them. We usually ended up playing at coming-out parties. None other than tall, accordion-playing classmate James Stewart was one of his vocalists (though anyone who has heard Stewart warble Easy to Love to a grimacing Eleanor Powell in 1938’s Born to Dance would know singing was hardly his forte). There is at least one extant recording of José Ferrer and the Pied Pipers, done in 1931 in New York City at the Standard Sound Recording Corporation. It was a 78 rpm record of the song Love Comes but Once, co-written by Ferrer and his bandmate Syd Wise, with a vocal chorus by James Stewart.\n\nThe Pipers would vary in size over the years with as many as eighteen members at one point. When the Depression hit, Ferrer would explain, rich papas who couldn’t afford Paul Whiteman hired us. We made a lot more dough than college boys should have in their pants. Ferrer led the band throughout his stay at Princeton, and his Pied Pipers would not only have engagements in New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, but internationally as well. In 1930, the band toured France, Italy, and Switzerland, and the following year, the Pipers were hired for a seven-day cruise. I was very good with the stick. Leading the band was the best thing I did. Ferrer may well have been too good at it—ultimately at the expense of his studies. While his other classmates, such as Stewart, graduated in 1932, Ferrer had to remain another year to make up for classes lost to excessive musical merriment.\n\nThis extra year could well have been a blessing in disguise. Ferrer’s flair for performing had caught the attention of the members of the Princeton Triangle Club, which was the oldest collegiate musical comedy theater troupe in the United States. It also included among its members, such future theatrical mainstays as the aforementioned Stewart, Myron McCormick, as well as stage (and film) directors Joshua Logan and Bretaigne Windust. In his last year at Princeton, Bert Brush, president of the Triangle Club, asked Ferrer if he would play the lead in their annual student musical. According to Ferrer, The head of the dramatic society tapped me on the shoulder and said, ‘I think you’re a born actor and I want you to play the lead in my new comedy show.’ After some mild protests along the line of I can’t act, Ferrer gave in: Once I was in, I was hooked.\n\nThough this was the story Ferrer gave to interviewers, it wasn’t as simple as that. While he had been approached by Brush, Ferrer still had to audition, and he was granted this opportunity because Bert Brush was the president—and Ferrer’s roommate. After his audition, Ferrer had gone to a movie and while in line, he heard some upperclassmen talking about him, specifically that they didn’t like him and were just giving him a chance because of Bert. Ferrer would later tell his son Rafael: I got so angry that when I did the callback, I full out ‘let it go.’ This was anger driven. Nothing to do with acting chops. Ferrer would be cast in the play, and son Rafael would feel this was essential to understanding his father: \"The minute you tell him no, he’s gonna do it. Classmate Logan was close to Ferrer in college and would later collaborate with him professionally; he recalled Ferrer as far above most Princeton men in charm, talent, and cultivation. They resisted him like they would resist any exotic element. He never bowed down before the golden calves of Princeton and because of that he was an outstanding Princeton man.\"\n\nFerrer not only accepted the lead role of the valet—he also rewrote the book. The plot of It’s the Valet consisted of a number of mistakenidentity elements that were mainstays of farce. When the show opened on December 14, 1932, audiences approved both of the show and the performance space, which was none other than the Metropolitan Opera House. Reviewers at the New York Times also caught the opening, with Ferrer earning special mention for playing the lead role in the style of the Marx Brothers. There was one potential audience member that Ferrer could not persuade to attend. His father, Don Rafael, refused to see his son’s theatrical debut, since he had a rather dim view of farce as a mode of artistic expression. Despite Ferrer’s discomfort with his father’s stance, the show’s critical and popular success instilled in the young man the notion that architecture might not be his pathway to success. Instead, maybe theater was the career path he should have pursued all along.\n\nFor the time being, Ferrer would continue his academic career. He graduated from Princeton in 1933 with a degree in architecture, but elected to alter his course of study when he began attending Columbia University: I thought I’d be no good as an architect so I went to Columbia to study modern languages and become a college professor. Staying in New York City only confirmed Ferrer’s feeling that the theatrical life was for him: \"In New York I began to hang around with some theater people … the only thing that made any sense to me was to be an actor … architects were starving in 1933. Honors students were making $25 as draftsmen if they could get a job. Ferrer studied languages and even began his dissertation, but he never completed it. As Ferrer would later recall, in 1935, he was in a Greek restaurant in Greenwich Village with his friend and fellow Princeton alumnus Jimmy Stewart, where he told Stewart: You’re witnessing a great moment in a man’s life, the moment of decision. I’ve just decided—I’m going to be an actor.\" That night he moved into the furnished room that Stewart was sharing with another Princeton alum, Myron McCormick."
