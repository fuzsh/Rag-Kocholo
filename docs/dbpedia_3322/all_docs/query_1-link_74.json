        "text": "I discovered recently that in 2007 “Cyrano de Bergerac” had been presented on Broadway and the stage production had been recorded on film, available on DVD. I had seen the 1950 movie with José Ferrer as Cyrano, had been captivated by the language and was curious to see how Kevin Kline would interpret Edmond Rostand’s 1897 classic romantic hero. I rented the DVD (although it is on-line), watched the stage version, enjoyed that interpretation also, then turned to a fellow cinephile who owns DVDs of many of Gérard Depardieu’s movies and borrowed from him the Depardieu “Cyrano de Bergerac”, in French with subtitles. For Depardieu’s Cyrano, Jean Paul Rappeneau wrote the screenplay and directed a lavish Technicolor production. With my inadequate French, watching took over from listening for the poetry of the language.\n\nCyrano has all the qualities of a romantic hero. He is a nobleman skilled with the sword and in fencing; equally skilled with language and in learning; bold and adventuresome yet refined in manner; generous; loyal; honorable; modest in dress and spurning, except for the broad-rimmed hat with its splendid white feather, the finery, the ribbons and lace worn by other men of the royal court. He is all of this with one tragic flaw: his outsized nose. He is loved and greatly admired by others but nevertheless remains secretly fearful, ready to take offense and defend his honor.\n\nThe two movies and filmed play are in The Swashbuckler genre of movie. (Other American movie genres are The Western, Film Noir, The Biopic, Science Fiction, etc.) In a Swashbuckler movie the protagonist is heroic, combining outstanding courage, swordfighting skill, resourcefulness, chivalry and a sense of honor and justice. He is deeply idealistic, rescues damsels in distress and does battle with dishonorable villains. The genre includes Cyrano de Bergerac, The Three Musketeers, The Scarlet Pimpernel, Robin Hood, Zorro and many others. The buckler to be swashed is a small shield gripped in the fist. It was generally used as a companion weapon in hand-to-hand combat with a sword/rapier.\n\nThe Three Musketeers (Les Trois Mousquetaires) is Alexandre Dumas’ 19th century novel set in the 17th century. It recounts the adventures of a young man named d’Artagnan on his travel to Paris, intending to join the Musketeers of the Guard in King Louis XIII’s Court.\n\nIn 1950 Bosley Crowther wrote with tongue in cheek about the “Cyrano de Bergerac” movie. He points out that it is a filmed version of the theatrical costume romance popular with American audiences at the time and that it faithfully follows the original play with an added scene of derring-do only talked about on the stage. In the movie, Cyrano is seen fighting the “hundred men” at the Porte de Nesle.\n\nRogert Ebert in his review gave high praise to Depardieu’s 1990 Cyrano, and given that it won Depardieu the Best Actor award at Cannes and a nomination from the Academy Awards for Best Actor, others agreed with him. I felt that Ebert identified with Cyrano. Do other men, too? If beauty is in the eye of the beholder so is to some extent the excellence of a film and the actor’s performance.\n\nI must confess my preference for Kevin Kline’s Cyrano. I watched the stage play because he is in it and was not disappointed. I had appreciated José Ferrer’s Cyrano without being emotionally engaged. Gerard Despardieu is an exceptional actor but his Cyrano annoyed me. In a review for Kevin Kline as Cyrano: “…The 60-year-old Kline moves and spars (with sword and word) with the agility of a man in his mid-20s. … Whether his Cyrano is rattling off a wry litany of ways to mock his nose, feeding words of devotion to the Roxane-wooing (and hapless) Christian in the famous balcony scene, or especially when revealing the depths of his feelings on the battlefield, he is in voice and body a whole and wholly involving creation. Both epic and intimate, his quest to avoid falling into the memory hole of history is unusually poignant, his penchant for courting fame or infamy – by tilting with 100 men by himself or even a single ruffled ruffian who dare speak against him in public – all too shattering and understandable. In short, he has no lack of that mythical quality that plays such a crucial role in Cyrano de Bergerac: panache.” And to my eyes, Kevin Kline has the mysterious quality that makes any role he plays convincing and memorable.\n\nJosé Ferrer’s 1950 movie, in black and white, modestly follows the Five Acts of the stage play. For Kevin Kline’s 2007 Cyrano I could imagine myself in a theatre. Depardieu’s 1990 movie is in Technicolor and opens with crowds of people entering a theatre from the street while the setting and the characters we will meet are being explained by a man talking to his eight or nine year old son. Differences between the three Cyrano characterizations begin here. The Cyrano of José Ferrer and Kevin Kline’s Cyrano move gracefully and speak charmingly. Depardieu’s does not fit the image of a 17th century gallant who is out of sync with his fellow noblemen in the aristocratic society of the royal court. His Act One duel is not Ferrer’s or Kevin Kline’s fencing ballet performed as Cyrano wields his sword and composes a poem. Their Cyranos are drawn into the duel through Viscount Valvert’s aggression and arrogance. Depardieu’s Cyrano pursues the arrogant but intimidated Valvert and bullies him into a duel.\n\nIn Rostand’s original play, after Cyrano completes the duel, d’Artagnan, the famous musketeer, approaches Cyrano and congratulates him on his fine swordsmanship. This may have happened in the Despardieu movie and I missed it. The gesture would not suit Depardieu’s swordsmanship. Act One of the play ends with talk of Cyrano going to fight a hundred swordsmen single-handed. We soon see Ferrer cheerfully swinging his sword as he runs through alleys, leaps onto a low wall, over a railing and up a staircase while incidentally killing a man or two or three. One must suspend disbelief. The scene of Depardieu’s Cyrano fighting and doing in a hundred men is beyond believing. I do not recall such a scene for Kevin Kline’s Cyrano. It really does belong off-stage.\n\nThe Depardieu movie has too much background information — interesting buildings, lots of action in Ragueneau’s kitchen, realistic portrayals of people in the crowds, of men and arms on the battleground. It distracts from the telling of a simple romantic tale. During the battle scenes I found myself focusing on the types of weapons being used, mostly swords but also the occasional muskets and two huge cannons, and on the soldiers’ uniforms, wondering if they are accurate for the period. Then in comes Roxane in a wagon with Ragueneau, dressed in men’s clothing but with her blond hair flowing over her shoulders. In the other versions she, as a finely dressed lady of the nobility, charms and flirts her way in a classy coach through Spanish held territory. In the 1990 movie, the heavily armed Spanish in the countryside are shown in action and some detail. Would a woman dressed unconventionally in a manner that reveals her figure, moving through male territory in a humble vehicle get through those lines untouched? I doubt it. On top of this we have Depardieu and Chrisitian carrying on about the complexities of their shared romance while their comrades are fighting off enemy soldiers who are scaling ramparts the Cadets had hastily constructed. (fascinating technical detail shown here) Men are dying around them, their lives are at risk and the two are talking. Bosley Crawther in the NY Times review of Ferrer’s Cyrano credits Ferrer for “… carrying off the maudlin romantics of the play with remarkable grace …” but thinks the “… maundering and mooning over Roxane is considerably hard to take. …” What in the world would he have thought of Depardieu’s maundering and mooning.\n\nAs for Roxane — Few scenes in the three versions of the story show her as anything more than an object allowing Cyrano to reveal his secret longing and exercise his passion for writing and reciting poetry. In the 1990 French version, women characters other than Roxane do not exist. The young woman in Act One who offers food to Cyrano and represents, I suppose, the general admiration for him is replaced by glimpses of a star-struck boy in the first and a later scene. Otherwise, we see Roxane’s woman servant, a few other servant women, low-life types and nuns, all of them stereotypes who make brief appearances.\n\nI have a vivid memory of Roxane’s declaration to Cyrano. It is in the 1950 Cyrano and not in the other two versions. Walking with Cyrano through a garden and into a luxuriously furnished house, Roxane stands arranging flowers in a vase as she tells Cyrano that men own the world and all that’s in it. A woman is at best a property, a prize like a horse or a dog, but if she is to be chattel then the terms would be hers, according to her own values. She would insist upon poetry and eloquence. Cyrano smiles and says nothing. In their pastry shop tête-à-tête she speaks of friendship, but he talks at Roxane, not with her. A phrase by Cyrano stayed with me. It is his last, before dying, standing and, I think, sweeping his hat down before him in a grand gesture, announcing that he still has “my white plume.”\n\nAct Five of the play, Cyrano’s Gazette, takes place fifteen years after the Battle of Arras and Christian’s death. Roxane now resides, and mourns, in a convent outside Paris, a place traditionally meant for unattached ladies of the nobility. De Guiche, Le Bret and Ragueneau are visiting with her and she expects Cyrano to come as usual, bringing news from the outside world, meaning gossip from the royal court.\n\nIn Ferrer’s movie, Roxane’s sudden realization that Cyrano is the man she has always loved has her speaking of her regrets and her loneliness. After he has drawn his sword and slashed away at his old enemies, Falsehood, Prejudice, Compromise, Cowardice, Stupidity, Cyrano dies as Roxane bends over him and kisses his face.\n\nIn Depardieu’s Cyrano, Roxane has far less to say and is standing a distance from him, behind the Comte de Guiche, silently watching Cyrano in his final duel with imaginary enemies. I found this translation of his last words –” … yet there is something still that will always be mine, and when I go to God’s presence, there I’ll doff it and sweep the heavenly pavement with a gesture — something I’ll take unstained out of this world … my panache.” Mon Panache. He dies alone; Roxane is not even near him.\n\nKevin Kline’s Cyrano dies in Roxane’s arms, after a ghostly duel with his multitude of enemies, not wearing his hat but with the vision before him of a white plume, his panache. “Panache” literally means a plume, but figuratively it is Cyrano’s gallantry. Cyrano seems emotionally closer to Roxane here than in the other renditions of the scene.\n\nIn the 2007 “Cyrano” Jennifer Garner’s voice bothered me. While watching a filmed play one makes allowances. I knew she was projecting from the stage to the audience, but other actors were doing the same without shouting. I thought her Roxane was without subtlety or nuance. To me she came across as a nice, energetic American girl with a bright smile. A reviewer here who saw her on stage perceived her differently.\n\nAnother feature of the 2007 play caught my attention: Cyrano’s best friend is different. In other versions, Le Bret is an older man and less a presence than Ragueneau, the pastry chef who aspires to being a poet, or than le Comte de Guiche, the villain and archenemy. In Kevin Kline’s “Cyrano” Le Bret is played by a tall, powerfully built young man, African-American via Canada. His Le Bret seems to have additional lines and a heightened significance as Cyrano’s friend.\n\nDepardieu’s Cyrano is shown in several scenes with a large number of the men of his regiment, the Gascon Cadets, all of whom were from the Gascony area, southwest France, north of the Pyrenees mountains. In the 2007 stage play, liberties are taken in depicting the Cadets; several obviously have some African ancestry, as does the play’s Christian. After all, this is an American adaptation and these days, all to the good, diversity is expected.\n\nIn French, “cadet” is the word for younger sons of a noble family. The oldest son in a family of the nobility inherited all the family’s land and property, privileges and rank. “The law of primogeniture in Europe has its origins in Medieval Europe; which due to the feudal system necessitated that the estates of land-owning feudal lords be kept as large and united as possible to maintain social stability as well as the wealth, power and social standing of their families.” Younger sons were expected to leave home and pursue a career in the government, church or military, but definitely not in commerce or manual activities. That would mean losing the rank of “noble.” Noblemen derived their income from the labor and skills of peasants on the family’s estate and the peasants had to pay to use the mills and forges on the land.\n\nFrom the King on down to the Chevalier and Ecuyer/Squire, this was the political system of pre-Revolutionary France. The nobility made up the Second Estate (about 2% of the population) of the Estates General. The Catholic clergy comprised the First Estate. The bourgeoisie and peasants were the Third Estate. Boys of the nobility were educated, taught Latin, the lingua franca of science, philosophy, literature and poetry. They attended universities where Latin was spoken. I lived in the Latin Quarter of Paris, and wrote here about schools the 17th century aristocratic boys would have attended. They would have continued from there into the ruling upper level of the clergy, above the simple priests or monks, or into official positions where they administered royal justice and civil government. The boys who were so inclined would also have been taught to use the weaponry of the time, primarily the sword but the musket had been introduced. Nobles were required to honor, serve, and counsel their king and to render military service. Cyrano and the Gascon Cadet’s fought the Spanish in Arras in 1640 and helped win the city for Louis XVII.\n\n“Cyrano de Bergerac” is all about Panache. The figurative meaning of the word was introduced into English through translations of the play and it occurs to me that perhaps for Americans the 1950 movie was the primary vehicle for changing the word “panache” from meaning a feather to meaning a personal style like Cyrano’s. In my 1955 Oxford Universal Dictionary, panache is defined as “… 1. A tuft or plume of feathers, esp. when used as a headdress or an ornament for a helmet; hence a tassel of the like. 2. Astron. A plume-like solar perturberance. 1887.” That’s it; no additional meaning. In a recent dictionary, the definition has changed; it is “… 1. a plume of feathers, esp. such a plume on a helmet, 2. a dashing elegance of manner; carefree, spirited self-confidence or style; flamboyance.”\n\nAnd such is the movies’ influence on the way we see and experience our world —"
