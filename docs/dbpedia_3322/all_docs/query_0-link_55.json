The NCIS: Los Angeles star’s rep confirmed the news to ET Canada on Thursday.\n\nThe son of Hollywood star Jose Ferrer (Cyrano de Bergerac) and famed singer Rosemary Clooney, Ferrer appeared in numerous films and TV series throughout his career, which began in the 1980s with guest spots on shows like Magnum, P.I., CHiPs and Cagney & Lacey.\n\nREAD MORE: Miguel Ferrer spotted at cousin George Clooney’s wedding\n\nPrior to becoming an actor, Ferrer was a successful studio musician who played drums for a wide array of performers. He also toured with his mother and Bing Crosby, and recorded with The Who’s drummer Keith Moon.\n\nBreaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens.\n\nFerrer’s breakout performance came in the 1987 big screen sci-fi film Robocop, which was followed by a memorable recurring role in 1990’s Twin Peaks as FBI Agent Albert Rosenfield. It’s a role he reprises in Showtime’s upcoming reboot.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHe went on to tackle roles on Crossing Jordan and NBC’s short-lived Bionic Woman.\n\nTrending Now\n\nJordan Chiles stripped of bronze medal, USA Gymnastics files appeal\n\nTravelling soon?

Miguel was a man of tremendous talent who had a powerful dramatic presence on screen, a wicked sense of humour, and a huge heart,” said R. Scott Gemmill, the program’s showrunner, in a statement. “Our thoughts go out to his wife Lori, his sons, and his entire family. He will be greatly missed.”"
