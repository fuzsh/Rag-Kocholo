        "text": "On FERRER: articles—\n\nLondon, Julie, \"The Two Faces of Ferrer,\" in Films and Filming (London), June 1958.\n\nCiné Revue (Paris), 6 August 1981.\n\nBuckley, Michael, \"Jose Ferrer,\" in Films in Review (New York), February and March 1987.\n\nObituary, in Variety (New York), 3 February 1992.\n\nObituary, in Film-Dienst (Cologne), 4 February 1992.\n\nObituary, in Revue du Cinéma (Paris), March 1992.\n\n* * *\n\nIt may be said of José Ferrer's career in films that his prestige outweighs his success. While considered a major actor, and associated with many important films, some of them innovative milestones, others \"message\" films, Ferrer never enjoyed a consistently satisfying or secure career.\n\nFar from denying the decline in his film work since his heyday in the early 1950s, Ferrer later commented, \"My entire film career has been dominated by Cyrano de Bergerac and Moulin Rouge . I have learned to live with the situation, but I regret the form my career has taken.\" In both films the character actor portrayed sensitive souls who had physical deformities. Cyrano was a complex interpretation of a hapless, ugly, unrequited lover who was also a brave iconoclast and sensitive poet. As Toulouse Lautrec, the brilliant Parisian painter who was a dwarf, Ferrer literally went on his knees. Cyrano earned Ferrer an Academy Award, yet some years later he mused that the honor was no assurance of success. He stated bluntly in 1961, \"For three years there has been no call for my services as a film actor.\"\n\nFerrer always preferred to have a strong hand in any production with which he was involved, and naturally turned to directing. He cast himself as the lead in films which he also directed, such as I Accuse , in which he played the persecuted French Jewish Officer, Dreyfus, and The Shrike , starring as the victimized husband. He was always attracted to films with a social message, and objected to the soft-pedaling of the Jewish issue in The Caine Mutiny , in which he was cast as naval lawyer Barney Greenwald. In Ship of Fools he portrayed the Nazi antagonist.\n\nFerrer's quality on film has been perceived as serious, even dour, and he was usually typecast as a \"heavy.\" In the 1970s and into the 1980s Ferrer made several TV films. What others might term supporting roles, or at least \"cameos,\" Ferrer sarcastically called \"bit parts, to earn a fast buck . . . the roles where I play the villain or I go up in flames in the end.\"\n\nFerrer remained active in the theater, acting on and off Broadway and on the road in a broad range of roles; he also did musicals. He directed in New York, in stock and regional theaters, and even returned to work in his native Puerto Rico. Yet, in a 1983 interview he complained that he was reduced to doing TV voice-overs. Ironically, Ferrer's voice and diction were so distinctive and so well known as to render anonymity an impossibility."
