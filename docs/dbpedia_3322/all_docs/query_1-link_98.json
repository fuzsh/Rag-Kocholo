        "text": "Edmond Rostand's poetic drama, \"Cyrano de Bergerac,\" which has charmed and inspired romantic scholars and theatre audiences for more than fifty years, has finally been made into a movie in which the stage actor, Jos√© Ferrer, plays the famous large-nosed hero with eloquence and grace. Produced by Stanley Kramer in conventional theatrical style, the film began a two-a-day engagement at the Bijou Theatre last night.Since Cyrano is quite as familiar as Hamlet or Huckleberry Finn in the minds and affections of millions, any cheapening of the character or the play would probably result in the scalping of any actor or producer who dared. Obviously Mr. Kramer and his associates were respectful of this peril, and Mr. Ferrer was taking no chances on losing the hair he has.For their film follows almost to the letter the English translation of the play which was made by Brian Hooker for Walter Hampden some thirty years ago and which is, of course, the translation familiar to Americans. Except for the dropping of some characters which are wholly extraneous to the plot and some cuts for the sake of economy, this is the \"Cyrano\" of the stage.Carl Foreman, who wrote the screenplay, even planned and constructed the film in five major phases conforming to the five scenes of its performance on the stage. And Michael Gordon, the director, has seen to it that it is played in the formalized groupings and manners of theatrical costume romance. One significant scene has been added; Cyrano is now permitted to fight the \"hundred men\" at the Porte de Nesle which is only talked about on the stage. And the famous song of the cadets of Gascoyne has been discreetly overlooked.But, above all, Mr. Ferrer plays Cyrano in a style that is in the theatrical tradition of gesture and eloquence. He speaks the poetry of Rostand with richness and clarity such as only a few other actors have managed on the screen. He bears himself proudly and nobly. He duels with decisiveness. And he carries off the maudlin romanaics of the play with remarkable grace. For all who are soft to the enchantments of Cyrano and sentiment, he's their man.However, it must be objected that there is a great deal of hot air in the play which is not in the least extracted or tempered by the character of this film. Cyrano's swagger and arrogance in the face of authority and power are delightfully lush and bravura, and Mr. Ferrer plays them with wit, but his maundering and mooning over Roxane is considerably hard to take. Especially the antique \"gimmick\" of Cyrano pressing Christian's suit (figuratively speaking, that is) and making love speeches for that young man under the balcony of Roxane is a wholly incredible device. Indeed, it is quite as incredible as the size of Cyrano's nose, and the literalness of this presentation does nothing to validate it.Mala Powers' Roxane, for instance, is a lovely but lifeless girl, and William Prince makes the suitor, Christian, nothing more than a solemn young dunce. The Le Bret of Morris Carnovsky and Ralph Clanton's pompous de Guiche are shadowy costume characters that merely surround Cyrano. Same goes for the rest of the people; they are all merely figures on the fringe. They are not made graphic and satiric to point up the pretense of the play. Indeed, they are quite as colorless as the black-and-white photography, which, while mildly distinguished by a new clear focus, is disappointingly drab.Likewise the sets are handsome but lend only modest atmosphere, while the scene on the battlefield of Arras smacks of papier-mache Some tinkling background music by Dimitri Tiomkin, featuring harpsichord and violin, soothes the ear and whets the fancy. More music might have been used.Withal, there is beauty and magic in the things that Cyrano says. He is still a magnificent character. Thank goodness, he is on the screen.\n\nCYRANO DE BERGERAC, screen play by Carl Foreman, from the Brian Hooker translation of Edmond Rostand's play; directed by Michael Gordon; produced by Stanley Kramer and released through United Artists.
