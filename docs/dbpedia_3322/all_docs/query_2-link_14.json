Then in February 1954 Ferrer signed a deal with Universal to finance.[7][8]\n\n\"I'm terribly grateful to have been given the opportunity to star and direct\", said Ferrer.[9]\n\nIn April 1954 it was announced June Allyson would star alongside Ferrer.[10] Allyson had never played this type of role before.[11] \"I was fed to the teeth being sweet\", she said.[12]\n\nFilming started in September 1954.[13] Much of the film was shot on location at Bellevue Hospital and around Times Square in New York City.\n\nFerrer had the film scheduled so the cast would rehearse, then shoot, then filming would stop while the cast would rehearse again, then shoot again. Frings was on set the whole time to assist Ferrer's direction.[4]\n\nThe music score was by Frank Skinner. Ferrer composed \"Conversation (The Shrike)\", recorded by Pete Rugolo on his 1955 album New Sounds (Harmony HL7003).[14] The opening title sequence was created by Saul Bass.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nReviewing for The New York Times, A. H. Weiler wrote:\n\nJosé Ferrer, the director and star of the play, again is portraying the Broadway director who struggles to be released from the confines of the psychiatric ward even though it means a return to a hateful marriage. And, in making his debut as a film director, Mr. Ferrer proves that he is as expert behind the camera as he is across the footlights. Since he obviously is no stranger to his source material, his performance is at once polished, powerful and moving. And many of his principals, who are re-enacting the roles they created on stage, forcefully enhance the stark vista of life in a mental ward... As our sorely beset hero relates in flashback to probing psychiatrists, it was a happy union at first, full of love and companionship. It deteriorated slowly but inexorably, as did his career, when her insatiable yearning for the life of an actress and her meddling in his affairs reached a point of no return... Backstage and hospital sequences have a documentary authenticity heightened in effect by Mr. Ferrer's portrayal. His scenes in the nightmarish world of the mental ward and his climactic session with the psychiatrists as he tearfully and desperately agrees to return to his wife, is acting of a rare order... Although The Shrike has changed its tune it still is an unusual and immensely interesting film drama.[15]\n\nAllyson later said her husband Dick Powell and all her advisers opposed her making the movie:\n\nBut it was a challenge I could not resist. For years I had been the Perfect... And now..., I would be far from the perfect wife. I would indeed be a monster of a wife, one of the least attractive in the history of the theater. As it turned out, the picture was a wonderful flop, but I do not regret deciding to play the vixen, Ann Downs. Other than my personal satisfaction in making my own decision, The Shrike was fun, and I even dreamed vaguely of an Academy Award.[16]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of American films of 1955\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]"
