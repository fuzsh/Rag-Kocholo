        "text": "TCM’s Summer Under the Stars 2024: When to Watch Grace Kelly, Jerry Lewis & 11 Other SUTS First-Timers\n\nSummer Under the Stars (SUTS), Turner Classic Movies’ annual programming favorite, returns in August 2024, with the network again devoting each day of the month to films from a particular actor or actress.\n\nIt begins on Thursday, Aug. 1, with 13 films led by William Powell, including his Best Actor Oscar-nominated roles in The Thin Man (1934), My Man Godfrey (1936) and Life With Father (1947).\n\nThis year, SUTS features 13 stars making their first appearances during TCM’s event.\n\nEleanor Powell in 1935’s Broadway Melody of 1936, one of the films featured during her first Summer Under the Stars appearance\n\nThat’s the most we remember seeing in a while, and a few names on the 2024 first-timers list stand out as surprising they have not been spotlighted before now, given their statuses as Hollywood legends. For example, can you believe that the likes of Grace Kelly and Jerry Lewis are just now being featured in SUTS for the first time?\n\nAt the link just below, you can download the August 2024 TCM schedule and see a full day-by-day lineup for everyone featured during this year’s Summer Under the Stars.\n\nBelow the link, we focus on the 13 newcomers to the event. Note that the writeups on the first-timers are overviews that do not reflect the entire schedules on a star’s given day, and referenced titles are not necessarily presented in their order of airing; see the complete schedule at the link below for complete details.\n\nTCM Summer Under the Stars 2024: Dates and Titles for the 13 SUTS First-Timers (All Times Eastern)\n\nJulie Andrews — Sunday, Aug. 4, 2024, beginning at 6am\n\nLegendary actress/singer Julie Andrews is welcomed to Summer Under the Stars for the first time with a lineup of 10 films, including the network premieres of two movies directed by her husband, Blake Edwards — the romantic spy thriller The Tamarind Seed (1974), costarring Omar Sharif, and the comedy The Man Who Loved Women (1983; airs late-night), also starring Burt Reynolds.\n\nAlso featured today are the Edwards-directed films Darling Lili (1970), 10 (1979), Victor/Victoria (1982, pictured above) and That’s Life!
