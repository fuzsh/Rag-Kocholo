        "text": "The Diplomat season two is officially coming to Netflix – and better yet, it should be with us this year.\n\nThe return of the hit show comes as no surprise given its success for the streaming giant (plus, it would have been cruel not to renew it for us after season one's explosive ending).\n\nThe political drama follows career diplomat Kate Wyler (Keri Russell) as she adjusts to her new high-profile job as a UK ambassador amid an international crisis, all while trying to survive her stormy marriage to fellow career diplomat Hal (Rufus Sewell).\n\nNow that we know Kate's coming back for more, here's everything you need to know about The Diplomat season two.\n\nWhen does The Diplomat season 2 come out?\n\nAt this moment, all we know is that The Diplomat will be back at some point in 2024.\n\nThis was reported by Deadline, among a list of Netflix shows that were to appear on the streamer's \"big, bold\" 2024 slate – including Squid Game season two and Bridgerton's third season.\n\nProduction began on season two of The Diplomat in June last year – the cast and producers even met US Secretary Antony Blinken at the US Embassy in London – however, production was delayed a little due to the industry strikes.\n\nWe'll just have to wait a bit longer for now to get a firmed-up release date, so stay tuned.\n\nWho will be in The Diplomat season 2 cast?\n\nIt's been confirmed that Keri Russell will reprise her role as Kate Wyler (you can't have The Diplomat without the diplomat, after all), but who will be joining her?\n\nWe would expect to see David Gyasi back as Austin Dennison, as well as Ali Ahn as Eidra Graham and Rory Kinnear as Prime Minister Nicol Trowbridge.\n\nWe've also had an exciting cast announcement, with Allison Janney joining the fold for season two – and reuniting with fellow The West Wing alum and The Diplomat creator Debora Cahn.\n\nJanney will take on the role of vice president Grace Penn, who has been frequently mentioned but not yet seen in the show. Janney's guest starring role is set to run through the season, Tudum by Netflix has confirmed.\n\nThe following cast members are also likely to return for The Diplomat season two:\n\n• Miguel Sandoval as Miguel Ganon\n\n• Nana Mensah as Billie Appiah\n\n• Michael McKean as US President William Rayburn\n\nThe fates of Kate's husband Hal Wyler (Rufus Sewell) and Stuart Hayford (Ato Essandoh) are a little more uncertain, given they were both within range of Conservative MP Merritt Grove's (Simon Chandler) car exploding.\n\nWe see but don't hear the French police informing Kate of the news in Paris. Are Hal and Stuart dead or just injured?\n\nIn an interview with Esquire, Sewell said that he's eager to see what happens next —whether it includes his character or not.\n\n\"I would like the show to continue as long as it can — with or without me,\" he said. \"It's so well cast, it's such a fun show to be in, and it's one of those things that plays like it reads. One of the delights [of acting] is to read something, have a gut feeling about it, then turn up [to the job], and it feels right. Then you watch it, and it's what you imagined.\"\n\nLet's just hope it continues with him.\n\nIf we're really lucky, we'll get a reunion of The Americans – as Keri Russell has been trying to get Matthew Rhys on the show.\n\nRussell told The AV Club: \"If The Diplomat gets a second season, maybe we can lure him our way. In fact, when we were filming last summer, I asked him, 'Don't you want Debora [Cahn] to write something for you? What would you do?'\n\n\"Matthew likes tough guys because he's an actor and wears make-up for a living, so when I said, 'What do you want to play?' He said some kind of army or military soldier. So you never know.\"\n\nWhat will happen in The Diplomat season 2?\n\nIn The Diplomat's explosive season-one finale, Kate and Dennison deduce that Trowbridge ordered the attack on HMS Courageous and hired the Russian Lenkov Group to kill his own men.\n\nWe then watch as Grove's car explodes with Hal and Stuart within range before the police inform Kate of the news and the credits roll in.\n\nSpeaking to Tudum about what she wanted to accomplish with this explosive cliffhanger, series creator Debora Cahn said: \"I wanted to bring together all of the different dynamics of the political relationships and the personal relationships in one event that splits apart all at the same time.\n\n\"The essential conflict in the relationship is that these are two people [Kate and Hal Wyler] married to each other and in love with each other, who are colleagues, who were great collaborators and are sometimes great competitors. It takes all the dynamics of a relationship of a marriage and heightens them when you can’t ever get away.\"\n\nIt looks like we'll finally find out if Hal and Stuart were killed by the blast or if they're in hospital recovering – and there reportedly won't be long to wait after the series begins.\n\nIn July, a source confirmed to TV Line that season two will \"pick up right away\" after the events of the finale. They said that The Diplomat \"has a really compressed timeline – something like three weeks pass in season one – so it makes sense season two would start moments later.\"\n\nSharing his hopes for their survival in an interview with Tudum, Sewell said: \"I hope we all survive. What can I say? I mean, I loved the dramatic turn. I just have to hope that everyone will be OK. But the drama needs to be real.\"\n\nAs for Kate and Hal's marital issues, he added: \"I like to think there are enough problems to last us [a few seasons]. Who knows?\"\n\nMeanwhile, Kate and Dennison will likely be building a case against Trowbridge in season two.\n\n\"I'm excited to see what that relationship [becomes],\" Gyasi told Tudum.\"They're so opposite to one another, and yet, when you scratch the surface, [you see] what drives them [and they're] probably more connected to one another than a lot of other characters.\"\n\nIs there a trailer for The Diplomat season 2?\n\nGiven The Diplomat is still in production, it might be some time before we see any new footage from the show.\n\nBut make sure to stay tuned for additional information on season two – including trailers, official casting announcements and fresh plot details."
