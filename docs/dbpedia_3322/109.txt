The great Jos√© Ferrer showed audiences his comical side in the bittersweet Anything Can Happen. He plays a Georgian immigrant, and he's just adorable. The opening scene shows Joe's boat pulling into Ellis Island, and as he gazes at the Statue of Liberty, he practices a basic English phrase. "How...are..." (he sneaks another peek at the guidebook) "...you?" he asks the statue before tipping his hat. It's so cute! Kurt Kazner helps him get through immigration and shows him the ropes in America, from helping him learn English to getting him started in business.

He soon meets Kim Hunter, a sweet girl with an interest in local, international folk songs. Joe sings a bit for her, and before he knows it, they're developing a friendship and including each other in meals and get-togethers. Joe's falling in love with her, but in Kim's mind, he's just a dear friend. However, in America, anything can happen.

Although this movie is a cute comedy with a sweet little romance thrown in, there is some drama thrown in there. For one, the love story is unrequited, and for another, the path to American citizenship is fraught with obstacles. It's not an easy journey for Joe, but he's determined and works hard even when he gets pushed two steps backwards.

Kurt has a very funny lesson to teach Joe one day when they're discussing the dough in their bakery. Joe pronounces it the right way, but Kurt corrects him: "When meat is hard to eat, is called 'tuff'. How you spell? ... When ocean's up and down, is called 'ruff'. How you spell? ... And flour and yeast is spelled D-O-U-G-H. So, is 'duff'." It's an adorable explanation that makes total sense to non-native English speakers. And when native English speakers really think about it, they'll realize how difficult their language is for others to learn. I'd recommend this movie for those who find immigration movies endearing, or if you've just watched 1952's Moulin Rouge and want to see Joe's versatility.
