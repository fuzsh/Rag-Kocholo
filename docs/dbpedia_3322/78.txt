José Ferrer (born January 8, 1912, Santurce, Puerto Rico—died January 26, 1992, Coral Gables, Florida, U.S.) was an American actor and director best known for his Academy Award-winning performance in the title role of the film Cyrano de Bergerac (1950) and for his portrayal of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec in Moulin Rouge (1952).

Ferrer, a graduate of Princeton University (1934), was a gifted pianist and had intended to become an architect before launching his acting career in 1935. He earned acclaim in the comic title role of the Broadway hit Charley’s Aunt (1940) before appearing as Iago with Paul Robeson in Othello (1943), which set an all-time record run for a Shakespearean play on Broadway to that time. Ferrer earned his first Tony Award in 1947 for his performance in Cyrano de Bergerac and won two more in 1952, one for directing the plays Stalag 17, The Fourposter, and The Shrike and the other for acting in The Shrike.
