Individual Note

Maud of Savoy (Portuguese: Mafalda de Saboia, also known as Mahaut or Matilda) (11251158) was the first Queen of Portugal. She was Queen consort through her marriage, in 1146, to King Afonso I, the first ruler of Portugal as an independent kingdom.

She was the second or third daughter of Amadeus III of Savoy, Count of Savoy and Maurienne, and his wife Mahaut of Albon (the sister of Guigues IV of Albon, "le Dauphin").

Walter Map's account of her death

Walter Map tells a story that "the King of Portugal now living", almost certainly Afonso, had been convinced by evil counselors to murder his pregnant wife out of misplaced jealousy. However, there is no other authority for this account, and it is not generally accepted.
