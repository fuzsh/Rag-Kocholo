        "text": "Time for the third installment of our series on Belgian royal brides! This week, we’re discussing the December 1960 wedding of King Baudouin and Fabiola Mora y Aragon; if you missed them, here are links to our earlier posts on the weddings of Queen Astrid of Belgium and Queen Marie Jose of Italy.\n\nKing Baudouin was the second child and first son of King Leopold III and Queen Astrid, who was born a Swedish princess. Baudouin’s childhood was filled with upheaval. When he was four, his grandfather’s unexpected death placed his parents on the throne. His mother died in a tragic car accident when he was five; his father made a controversial second marriage when he was eleven. In 1940, when his father capitulated to the Germans, Baudouin and his family were imprisoned and narrowly avoided a tragic fate.\n\nKing Leopold’s actions during the war were extremely controversial in Belgium, and as a result, Baudouin came to the throne in a rather unconventional way. Even though Leopold was ultimately exonerated of many of the charges leveled against him during the war, continuing political division led him to abdicate in 1951. As a result, Baudouin became King of the Belgians at the age of twenty.\n\nBaudouin was shy and reserved. He was so committed to the Roman Catholic religion that he reportedly once considered becoming a monk. His devout faith ultimately led him to his future wife. Fabiola Mora y Aragon, the daughter of Spanish aristocrats (and goddaughter of Queen Ena of Spain), was also devoutly Catholic. She was working as a nurse in Madrid in 1959 when she was approached by Sister Veronica O’Brien. A Belgian cardinal had tasked O’Brien with finding a wife for the quiet, lonely king, and she selected Fabiola as the perfect candidate. Baudouin and Fabiola were introduced and quickly bonded, and she accepted his proposal of marriage. Baudouin later confessed in his diary that he felt God had brought Fabiola to him and that O’Brien was his “guardian angel.”\n\nOn September 16, 1960, the royal engagement was officially announced by the Belgian prime minister, and the couple appeared before the press. Baudouin and Fabiola had actually been engaged for some time before the announcement, but they had managed to keep the relationship so private that the Belgian people were surprised. The engagement announcement had been delayed because of the tragic and complicated political situation in the Congo, which was then a Belgian colony.\n\nBaudouin and Fabiola appeared together in public in Brussels eight days later, where they were greeted enthusiastically by crowds.\n\nIn early October, the palace announced that the royal wedding would take place in Brussels on December 15. In the meantime, the couple made visits to various parts of the country, including a successful visit to Antwerp where the locals cheered “Long Live the Queen!” at Fabiola’s appearance. Wedding invitations were issued in November, and numerous foreign royals were on the guest list. Princess Margaret, a newlywed herself, was Britain’s representative. Queen Juliana of the Netherlands was on the list, as were his uncle, King Olav V of Norway, and Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg (the mother-in-law of his sister, Josephine-Charlotte), and his aunt, Queen Marie Jose of Italy. The exiled Spanish royal family sent four representatives: the Count and Countess of Barcelona, Infante Juan Carlos, and Infanta Maria Cristina.\n\nFabiola was not only popular in Belgium; she also became something of a superstar in her native Spain. The New York Times noted that she had “replaced movie stars and soccer champions as Spain’s current darling” and was “honored and regaled with jewels, cars, and other gifts from official and social groups.” She departed Spain ahead of the wedding on December 4. Spain’s leader, Generalissimo Franco, and his wife, Carmen, presented Fabiola with a glittering wedding gift: a diamond tiara that could be worn in various configurations.\n\nFabiola wore the new tiara for the first time with a yellow silk gown at the gala dinner held the night before the royal wedding. Newspapers noted the presence of Princess Margaret at the gala, wearing “a diamond-studded tiara and a gown of lilac silk.” (The tiara was the Poltimore.)\n\nPhotographs of other royal guests show Princess Irene of the Netherlands wearing her mother’s aquamarine tiara and Princess Margaret of Denmark (the groom’s maternal aunt) wearing the borrowed Khedive of Egypt Tiara.\n\nQueen Marie Jose of Italy, the groom’s paternal aunt, wore her own wedding tiara, the Musy Tiara, to the gala.\n\nQueen Anne of Romania (pictured with the Princess of Rethy) also wore her wedding tiara: the family’s Greek Key Tiara, a Romanov heirloom.\n\nGrand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg (escorted by Baudouin’s father, King Leopold) wore the imposing Luxembourg Empire Tiara.\n\nKing Baudouin’s grandmother, Queen Elisabeth, wore her glittering Cartier bandeau at the reception. Hereditary Grand Duchess Josephine-Charlotte of Luxembourg, Baudouin’s sister, wore one of her wedding gifts, the Belgian Scroll Tiara.\n\nThe groom’s sister-in-law, Princess Paola, wore the diamond art deco bandeau that had originally belonged to Queen Elisabeth; his stepmother, the Princess of Rethy, wore a diamond Van Cleef and Arpels necklace as a tiara. A reporter for the Associated Press reported that a security officer marveled that “he never had seen so many costly gems in years of guarding royal heirlooms.”\n\nOn the morning of December 15, the family gathered at the palace in Brussels for the civil wedding ceremony. The couple signed more than twenty documents to legalize their marriage. Four men served as witnessses: for Baudouin, Prince Albert, his brother, and Hereditary Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg, his brother-in-law; for Fabiola, the Marqués de Casa Riera, her brother, and the Count of Barcelona, the pretender to the Spanish throne.\n\nBecause both the civil and religious weddings were daytime affairs, the only person wearing a glittering tiara was the bride. With her Balenciaga wedding gown, Fabiola wore the Nine Provinces Tiara, which was made as a wedding gift in the 1920s for her late mother-in-law, Queen Astrid. The tiara’s distinctive height and design held its own against her wedding veil and immediately announced her new royal status.\n\nThe religious ceremony was held at the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula, where Baudouin’s parents had been married more than 30 years earlier.\n\nThe couple received a papal blessing from a Vatican representative and were married by the same man, Cardinal Suenens, who had instigated the search for Baudouin’s bride. They were surrounded by more than two thousand guests and 150,000 pink carnations that had been sent from Spain.\n\nAfter a drive through the city and a balcony appearance, the couple departed for their honeymoon in Spain. Baudouin and Fabiola sat on the throne of Belgium for three decades, until Baudouin unexpectedly died of heart failure while on holiday in Spain in 1993. They served as a unifying presence in an often-divided nation and had a happy marriage, although their inability to have children was a source of personal sadness. Fabiola remained an important part of the Belgian royal family until her death last December.\n\nEarlier this month, we discussed the jewels and the grandeur of the royal weddings of King Leopold III and Queen Astrid of Belgium. In our second post of a series on Belgian royal brides, we’re taking a look at the wedding of Leopold’s sister, Marie José, with a future Italian king.\n\nJust like her Swedish sister-in-law, the marriage prospects of Princess Marie José of Belgium had been the subject of heavy speculation in the press. She was the daughter of a reigning monarch — an increasingly rare thing in post-WWI Europe — and, even more significantly, she was a Roman Catholic. As early as 1923, reporters were linking her with Crown Prince Umberto of Italy and forecasting an imminent engagement. Marie José had been educated in Italy, subscribed to the right religion, and was royal, three important factors that qualified her to be Italy’s future queen consort. The press fairly salivated at the prospect.\n\nA marriage between Umberto and Marie José was indeed in the cards, but the press and the public had to wait six more years before it was made official. The engagement was announced between the twenty-seven-year-old Italian crown prince and the twenty-three-year-old Belgian princess in Brussels on October 24, 1929 — a day better remembered as “Black Tuesday,” the date of the stock market crash that triggered the Great Depression. Umberto and Marie José’s week wasn’t much better. Umberto had decided to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Brussels as his first official act following the engagement. As a band played the Italian national anthem, a student fired a revolver in Umberto’s direction from fairly close range. He missed, and Umberto calmly went about his wreath-laying business.\n\nThe wedding date was fixed for January 8, 1930; Umberto had specifically requested the day, which was the 57th birthday of his mother, Queen Elena. Following the assassination attempt, extra security was employed for the Belgian royal family’s journey to Rome. Extra guards were hired to patrol bridges and crossings along the royal train’s route, which was reportedly kept secret. On January 5, Princess Marie José arrived in Italy, accompanied by her parents, King Albert I and Queen Elisabeth, her elder brother and sister-in-law, the Duke and Duchess of Brabant, and her second brother, Prince Charles.\n\nThe people of Rome welcomed their new crown princess enthusiastically, and Marie José was showered with gifts, including numerous jewels. The New York Times reported that Umberto was given “diadems with diamonds and other precious stones, intended for his bride and sent by some of the richest families in the country.” The paper also noted that Umberto gave his bride “the famous pearl necklace of his grandmother, Queen Margherita, who stated in her will [that] it was her gift to her grandson’s future bride,” plus “a ruby of great historic value that belonged to Victor Emmanuel I of Savoy, as well as other gems of great value.” The papers also reported that Queen Elena’s gift to her new daughter-in-law was “a wonderful diadem of diamonds and other precious stones set in gold.” (This description probably refers to the Musy Tiara, which Marie José wears in the portrait above.)\n\nMarie José’s parents gave her an early nineteenth-century parure of diamond and turquoise jewels, including a necklace, a pair of bracelets, a large brooch, and earrings. She wore the turquoises, with the necklace “mounted as a bandeau in the fashion of the period,” at a reception at the palace in Rome held two days before the wedding [1]. She was also given a diamond and ruby ring by Tammaro de Marinis, a Neopolitan book collector [2]. According to the Times, the nation of Belgium gifted their princess with “a Brussels lace marriage veil and a diamond ring.”\n\nOn the day before the wedding, the royals gathered on the balcony of the Quirinal Palace to watch a procession of Italians from all over the country in traditional local folk dress. The people performed songs and did traditional dances; many of them also brought gifts to the couple. Newspapers estimated that 300,000 people participated in the parade.\n\nThe Belgian royal family at the Vatican [source]\n\nThe same afternoon, the Belgian royal family had a private audience with Pope Pius XI before returning to the palace for another glittering reception. At that evening reception, Marie José wore Queen Margherita’s pearls with a pink gown. Newspapers commented on the purple gown worn by Queen Amelie of Portugal, who also donned a diamond tiara — perhaps this one?\n\n[source]\n\nOn the morning of January 8, the royal guests gathered in the three-centuries-old Pauline Chapel at Quirinal Palace for the wedding. The groom’s sister, Princess Yolanda, had married Count Carlo Calvi di Bergolo in the same chapel seven years earlier. Marie José wore white for her wedding — more precisely, a gown with an ermine train that had been designed in part by Umberto himself — topped with a lace veil and the famous diamond and pearl Musy tiara that had belonged to Queen Margherita.\n\nLike her daughter, Queen Elisabeth dressed all in white, with a lace veil and “a magnificent diadem of diamonds.” Queen Elena wore mauve and also donned a veil and a diamond tiara [3], along with her triple-stranded pearl necklace. The New York Times described the chapel as “pervaded by a subtle odor of incense and glowing with the colors of flashing jewels.” During the wedding ceremony portion of the mass, four princes from the House of Savoy held a veil over the heads of the couple, a tradition performed at the weddings of the first-born sons of the family.\n\nThe Archbishop of Pisa, Cardinal Pietro Maffi, presided over Umberto and Marie José’s wedding, but immediately after the ceremony and a quick balcony appearance, the newlyweds hurried to the Vatican for an audience with Pope Pius XI. Marie José didn’t have time to change her dress. Press reports note that she apologized for appearing before the pontiff in the gown — perhaps because she did not have the right to exercise the privilege du blanc?\n\nEither way, Pius XI was apparently gracious about the sartorial situation and offered the new crown princess a gem-studded rosary as a wedding gift. Newsreel footage of the departure from the Vatican shows Queen Elisabeth and Princess Astrid dressed in black and wearing tiaras. Marie José’s wedding was one of the only times Princess Astrid is known to have worn one of her wedding gifts, the Stockholm Tiara, as a diadem.\n\nAfter the private audience, the couple hopped in a car to head to the wedding breakfast, and then drove to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier — this time, with no assassination attempts involved — before returning to the palace. The official wedding celebrations continued for another three days.\n\nUmberto and Marie José did eventually become Italy’s king and queen — but only for thirty-four days in the spring of 1946. After the monarchy in Italy was abolished, the couple separated, but never divorced. They had four children, including Vittorio Emanuele, the current pretender to the Italian throne.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. The turquoises were sold in the auction of Marie José’s jewels at Christie’s in 2007.\n\n2. The ring was sold at Sotheby’s in November 2015.\n\n3. Elena wore this tiara, which has been in a bank vault in Italy since the exile of the royal family in 1946.\n\nRather than focusing on one jewelry-wearing royal lady this month, we’ll be doing a series on several: some of the royal brides of the Belgian royal family. Our series begins with a royal woman whose tragic end helped cement her important legacy for the family: Queen Astrid.\n\nAstrid was born Princess Astrid of Sweden on November 17, 1905, in Stockholm. She was the third daughter of Prince Carl of Sweden (a son of King Oscar II and Queen Sofia of Sweden) and Princess Ingeborg of Denmark (a daughter of King Frederik VIII and Queen Lovisa of Denmark). As a member of both the Swedish and Danish royal families, Astrid’s royal ties were extensive, and her name was often raised as a potential bride for various royal princes, including King Boris of Bulgaria and the Prince of Wales.\n\nIn September 1926, though, Astrid’s choice of a husband became clear. Her uncle, King Gustav V of Sweden, announced from the palace in Stockholm that Astrid was engaged to Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant, the heir to the throne of Belgium. Simultaneously, Leopold’s parents, King Albert I and Queen Elisabeth of the Belgians, announced the engagement to the press in Brussels. A marriage between a princess and a crown prince certainly involved political negotiation, especially in the aftermath of World War I, but Queen Elisabeth emphasized that the pair were genuinely in love.\n\nShe appears to have been correct. Leopold had been wooing Astrid for months, traveling incognito to Sweden and even hiding away from guests at Astrid’s parents’ home to deflect suspicion. Shortly after the engagement was announced, 24-year-old Leopold and 21-year-old Astrid were seen walking together affectionately in Stockholm. British Pathe cameras filmed their Swedish walkabout, which was chaperoned by Astrid’s parents; you can see the video below.\n\nThe wedding date was originally set for December, but then later pushed forward to early November. Negotiations took place over the couple’s religion; Leopold was Catholic, while Astrid was Lutheran. Although she reportedly considered converting at the time of the wedding, Astrid was reportedly advised not to convert unless she felt a personal conviction to do so. A papal dispensation was granted that allowed the pair to marry, provided that their children were raised in the Catholic church. When everything was settled, Leopold arrived in Stockholm ahead of the civil wedding with his family. For his 25th birthday (the day before the civil ceremony), Astrid baked him a chocolate cake herself, much to the delight of the correspondents covering the wedding in the papers.\n\nLeopold and Astrid had not one but two grand wedding ceremonies. On November 4, the pair wed in a civil ceremony held in the throne room of the palace in Stockholm. More than a thousand guests gathered to watch as Stockholm’s mayor — who, the press trumpeted, wasn’t even a monarchist — married the couple. For the civil ceremony, Astrid wore a white satin gown trimmed with seed pearls. She donned the same Brussels lace veil that had been worn by her mother and her sister Margaretha at their own weddings, plus a traditional crown of Swedish myrtle. A necklace (possibly the diamond necklace given to her by King Gustaf?) was the only significant jewel she wore with her ensemble. Leopold wore a khaki military uniform adorned with the star of the Order of the Seraphim, with which he had been presented the day before by King Gustaf. Leopold presented Astrid with a simple gold wedding ring during the ceremony.\n\n[source]\n\nAstrid’s guests far out-glittered the bride and groom at the civil wedding ceremony. The Washington Post reported, “Everywhere were gorgeous gowns and jewels and brilliant uniforms.” The royal guest list was lengthy. Four kings — Albert I of the Belgians, Gustaf V of Sweden, Christian IX of Denmark, and Haakon VII of Norway — attended the ceremony. Astrid’s bridesmaids included her sister, Princess Martha of Sweden; two royal cousins, Princess Ingrid of Sweden and Princess Feodora of Denmark; and Leopold’s sister, Princess Marie-Jose of Belgium. Leopold’s attendants included his brother, the Count of Flanders; two of his future brothers-in-law, Prince Charles of Sweden and Crown Prince Olav of Norway; and one of Astrid’s cousins, Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden.\n\nIn Sweden, Astrid received a number of sparkling wedding presents. The people of the city of Stockholm gave her an unusual diamond and pearl tiara made by Andersson. Astrid’s uncle, King Gustaf, gave her a diamond necklace, while her parents gave her a ruby necklace and a diamond and emerald brooch. Another newspaper report identifies Astrid’s parents’ gift as an emerald and diamond necklace. Leopold’s parents presented their new daughter-in-law with a tiara set with diamonds and a single large emerald. The presents were displayed at her parents’ home, where Astrid returned following the civil ceremony. Leopold departed a few hours after the wedding to return to Belgium, where the couple would reunite a few days later before their religious wedding.\n\nOn November 9, Astrid arrived in Belgium, and the crowds were so massive that she and the royal party were jostled about during her reunion with Leopold. The following day, the couple married in a religious ceremony at the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula in Brussels. Thousands gathered inside the cathedral to await the arrival of the bride and groom; their wait was fairly long, as delays meant that Astrid arrived at the church half an hour later than expected. When she stepped out of her carriage, she was wearing a second white wedding gown, but the same veil of Brussels lace covered her head. A necklace was again her only major piece of jewelry, but during the religious ceremony, Leopold gave her a ring set with a diamond.\n\nThe royal guest list was just as extensive for the Catholic wedding ceremony. The New York Times reporter noted that the female guests had been granted special permission to attend the wedding without covering their heads, although some “had their heads veiled in lace and others wore tiaras and ribbons.” Tiaras worn across the forehead in ’20s fashion were the order of the day, as you can see in this group photograph from the religious wedding. Astrid’s mother, Princess Ingeborg, wore her brilliant emerald tiara, while the groom’s mother, Queen Elisabeth, donned her remarkable Cartier diamond bandeau. Queen Alexandrine of Denmark wore her fringe tiara, and Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg — whose son would later marry Astrid and Leopold’s daughter — wore her Chaumet tiara with the enormous cabochon emerald centerpiece.\n\nAstrid didn’t wear a tiara to either of her wedding ceremonies, but the Belgian government was planning a major new tiara gift for their new Duchess of Brabant. In February 1927, they presented Astrid with the Nine Provinces Tiara, a grand diadem made by Van Bever of platinum and diamonds, including eleven large diamonds sourced from the Congo, which was then a Belgian colony. The New York Times explained, “The diadem is so made that it can be taken apart without difficulty and made into bracelets, rings, necklaces, or brooches, should the fashion change or its shape cease to please.” Astrid only had a few years to wear her tiara; she died in a tragic car accident in 1935. But the tiara is still with the Belgian royal family today, and we’ll see it play a part in another major royal wedding in an upcoming post."
