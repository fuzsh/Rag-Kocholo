        "text": "Our Womack Royal Line\n\nGEOFFREY, surnamed PLANTAGENET, COUNT d'ANJOU, born 1113, died 1151. King Henry I, of England, in despair over loss of his son, William, Duke of Normandy, who was drowned in the sinking of a ship off the coast of France, sought the aid of GEOFFREY PLANTAGENET, one of the most powerful princes of France, a noble person, with \"elegant and courtly manners and a reputation for gallantry in the field\". Approving the marriage of his daughter MATILDA with GEOFFREY, King Henry personally invested him with Knighthood, and expressed the hope that all Englishmen would give them full allegiance. The Barons took the oath to uphold the succession of Matilda and Geoffrey and their children after them. Thus Geoffrey heads the line of English Kings which bear his Plantagenet name. The friends of Geoffrey were unaware that their playful nickname for him of Plantagenet would live through the years. The story is told that while disguised in battle and to make himself known to his followers, he leaned from his horse and grasped a sprig of \"plante de genet\", the common broom corn, and thrust it in his helmet. Thus he derived his popular title. As eldest son of FULK V, KING OF JERUSALEM, and his wife, LRMENGARDE, daughter of HELIAS, Count of Maine, Geoffrey was of the House of Angevin Kings, which had been prominent for three centuries. (Note: Arms of Fulk V, King of Jerusalem pictured on page 201, Magna Charta.)\n\nGeoffrey's descent from the House of Angevin Kings follows:\n\n(1)THERTULLUS, COUNT of ANJOU, wife PETRONELLA, daughter of Conrad, Count of Paris; (2) INGELERUS I, Count of Anjou, married Adsline of Challon; (3) FULK, \"the red\", born 888, died 938, wife Roscilla of Blois; (4) FULK II, The Good, Count of Anjou, died 958, married Gerberga of Catinais; (5) GEOFFREY I, Count of Anjou, died 21 July 987, married Adelaide de Vermandois, also known as Adelaide de Chalons, born 950, died 975-78; (6) FULK III, \"the Black\" Count of Anjou, born 970, died 21 June 1040, married, second, after 1000, Hildegarde, who died 1 April 1109, married, fifth, Bertrade de Montfort; (9) FULK V, \"The Young\", Count of Anjou, King of Jerusalem, born 1092; died 10 Nov. 1143, who, as above stated, was the father of GEOFFREY V \"PLANTAGENET\", Count of Anjou, Duke of Normandy, who, on 3 April 1127, married MATILDA of ENGLAND, daughter of HENRY I, of England.\n\nNOTE: Also being given below, is the descent of Geoffrey V of Anjou, (called \"Plantagenet\") husband of Matilda (Maud), of England, from KING EDWARD THE GREAT.\n\nGENEALOGY OF GEOFFREY PLANTAGENET (born 1113, died 7 Sept. 1151, from Aedd Mawr,) (KING EDWARD THE GREAT), who appears to have lived about 1300 B.C.

The said Fulk IV's descent from OLD KING COLE is as follows;\n\nTHE FRANKISH KINGS\n\nOLD KING COLE, son of Meric (MARIUS) (g) above mentioned, was the father of, (1) ATHILDIS, wife of Marcomir IV, King of Franconia, who died 149. They had (2) CLODOMIR IV, King of the Franks, died 166, married Hasilda, their son; (3) KING FARABERT, died 186, his son; (4) KING SUNNO, died 213, his son; (5) KING HILDERIC, died 253, his son; (6) KING PARTHERUS, died 272, his son; (7) KING CLOLIUS III, died 298, his son; (8) KING WALTER, died 306, his son; (9) KING DAGOBERT, died 317, his son; (10) GENEBALD I Duke of the East Franks, died 350, his son; (11) KING DAGOBERT, died 379, his son; (12) KING CLODIUS I, died 389, his son; (13) KING MARCOMIR, died 404, his son; (14) KING PHAROMOND, married Argotta, daughter of Genebald, their son; (15) KING CLODIO, married Basina de Thuringia, and died 455, their son; (16) SIGERMERUS I, married the daughter of Ferreolus Tomantius, his son; (17) FERREOLUS, married Deuteria, a Roman lady, their son; (18) AUSBERT, died 570, married Blitheldes, daughter of Clothaire I, King of France, and his wife Ingonde, and grand-daughter of CLOVIS THE GREAT, King of France, born 466, baptized at Rheims, and died 511, and his wife Clothilde, of burgundy, \"The girl of the French Vineyards\". It was she who led him to embrace Christianity, and three thousand of his followers were baptized in a single day. When Clovis first listened to the story of Christ's Crucifixion, he was so moved that he cried, \"If I had been there with my valiant Franks, I would have avenged Him\". Ausbert and Blithildes were the parents of (19) ARNOUL, Bishop of Ketz, died 601, married Oda de Savoy and had (20) ST. ARNOLPH, Bishop of Metz, died 641, married Lady Dodo and had, (21) ACHISEA, married Begga of Brabant, who died 698, their son; (22) PEPIN d'HERISTAL, Mayor of the Palace, died 714, who married Alpais.\n\nThe royal successors of CLOVIS were woefully inefficient. They left the rule of their kingdom to their Mayors of the Palace, and only showed themselves to the people once a year, at the March Parliament, when, adorned with crowns and their fair hair flowing loose to their waists, they rode on a car drawn by oxen. As they did little but eat and drink and enjoy themselves, they went by the name of the sluggard kings, all power being in the hands of the Mayors of the Palace. Among these Mayors, PEPIN of HERISTAL made himself conspicuous. His home was near Spa in the woodland country around Liege. He made the office hereditary in his family. His heroic son, (23) CHARLES MARTEL, the Hammer, Mayor of the Palace, King of France, was still more famous, because, in the decisive Battle of Tours in 732, he utterly routed the Arabs, who had conquered Spain and the south of France. Charles Martel Married Rotrude and died in 741. His son, (24) PEPIN THE SHORT (or PEPIN le BREF, King of France, died in 768, leaving by his wife Bertha, of Laon, a son;\n\n(25) CHARLEMAGNE, Charles the Great, born 2 April 742, probably at Aix-La-Chapelle, the greatest figure of the Middle ages, King of the Franks. Charlemagne and his younger brother, Carloman, succeeded to equal portions to one of the most powerful of European kingdoms, bounded by the Pyrenccs, the Alps, the Mediterranean and the Ocean. Carloman, the younger brother, died soon after the death of their father, Pepin The Short, and with the consent of the great nobles, Charlemagne became King. Desiderius, the King of Lombardy, had made large encroachments upon the states of the Roman Pontiff, whose cause was taken up by Charlemagne. This led to feuds, which Bertha, his mother, endeavored to appease by arranging a marriage between her son and the daughter of the Lombard. But Charlemagne soon took a disgust to the wife thus imposed upon him, and repudiated her, that he might marry Hildegarde, born 757, died 30 April 782, the daughter of a noble family in Suabin. By his wife, Hildegarde, he had a son: (26) LOUIS I, the DEBONAIRE, who by his second wife, Judith, was the father of Gisela, ancestress of Hugh Capet, King of France and of JAMICIA, wife of RICHARD de CLARE, MAGNA CHARTA SURETY. Louis I, by his first wife Ermengarde, who died 818, daughter of Ingram, Count of Basbania, was father of (27) LOTHAIRE, Earl of Germany, who married Ermengarde of Alsace, and had (28) ERMENGARDE, who was the wife of Giselbert. Their son; (29) REGUIER I, Count of Hainault, died 916, who married Albreda, their son; (30) CISELBERT, Duke of Lorraine, married Gerlerga and died 930, their daughter; (31) ALBREDA of LORRAINE, wife of Renaud, Count de Roucy, who died 973, their daughter; (32) ERWENTRUDE ROUCY, married Alberic II, Count de Macon, who died 975, their daughter; (33) BEATRICE MACON, married Geoffrey I de Castenais, their son; (34) GEOFFREY II de CASTINAIS, married Ermengarde de Anjou, their son; (35) FULK IV, Count of Anjou, born 1043, died 1109, married Bertrade de Montfort (no. 67 above), their son (36) FULK V, Count d'anjou, who, as elsewhere stated (above) was the father of GEOFFREY PLANTAGENET, who married MATILDA of ENGLAND, a great-great-great-grand daughter of RICHARD I, Duke of Normandy and his wife, Lady Cunnora. Matilda's descent from Richard I, Duke of Normandy is as follows: (1) RICHARD I, Duke of Normandy, his son; (2) RICHARD II, Duke of Normandy, died 1026, married Judith de Brdtagne, their son; (3) ROBERT the MAGNIFICENT, also known as Robert the Devil, who, by Herleve Falaise, had WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR, father of King Henry I of England, who had Matilda, Wife of Geoffrey Plantagenet.\n\nNOTE: WURTS' MAGNA CHARTA, pp. 158-168 inclusive, gives sixty nine Generations of lineal descent from No. 1, Edward the Great, (Aedd Mawr) to No. 69, Geoffrey Plantagenet. This also shows Geoffrey's descent from the FRANKISH KINGS, Nos. 1, to and including 35; also his descent from No. (b) (HELI) Beli the Great through LUD, through TUANTIUS, through CYNVELIN (CYMBELINE), through AVIRAGUS, through MERIC (MARIUS), through EURGEN, through GLADYS, wife of No. 39, (LLEUVER MAWR) LUCIUS THE GREAT. And page 168 Wurt's Magna Charta shows that both Geoffrey Plantagenet and his wife, Matilda, or Maud, of England, were descendants of WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR, who as above stated, was descended from CHARLEMAGNE.\n\nNotes for Matilda of England:\n\nDescent from CHARLEMAGNE to MATILDA, or Maud, of England, wife of GEOFFREY PLANTAGENET;\n\n(1) CHARLEMAGNE and wife, Hildegarde had a son; (2) PEPIN, born 776, died 8 July 810, before his father. He was crowned by the Pope in 781, King of Lombardy and Italy, married Bertha, daughter of William, Count of Toulouse, his son; (3) BERNHARD, King of Lombardy, succeeded his father about the year 812, he was deposed by his Uncle Louis, blinded and put to death. By his wife Cunegonde, he had a son; (4) PEPIN, who was deprived of the throne by his Uncle Louis, Emperor, called the Debonair, and received a part of Vermandois and the Seignouries of St. Quentin and Peronne. His son; (5) PEPIN, Pepin de Senlis de Valois, Count Berengarius, of Bretagne, who was living in 893, the father of (6) LADY POPPA, (puppet or doll), who became the first wife of ROLLO the DANE, first Duke of Normandy. Their son; (7) WILLIAM LONGSWORD, was father of (8) RICHARD the FEARLESS, father of; (9) RICHARD II, \"the Good\", whose son; (10) ROBERT \"THE DEVIL\", sixth Duke of Normandy, who, by Herleve de falaise, daughter of the Tanner, Fulbert de Falaise, had a son; (11) WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR, born at Falaise in 1027, father of HENRY I, KING of ENGLAND, WHO WAS THE LAST OF THE NORMAN KINGS. (Magna Charta 178, 182, 183)\n\nShe was designated Henry's heir, and on his death (1135), Stephen siezed the throne and Matilda invaded England (1139) inuagurating a period of inconclusive civil war. She and he second husband (Geoffrey) captured normandy and in 1152 the Treaty of Wallingford recognised Henry as Stephen's heir.\n\nBurke says she was betrothed in her eight year (1119) to Henry.\n\nChild of Geoffrey Plantagenet and Matilda England is:\n\nKing Henry OF ENGLAND II\n\nGeneration No. 2\n\nHENRY OF6 ENGLAND II (GEOFFREYD'ANJOU5 PLANTAGENET IV, FULK4 V, FULK3 IV, GEOFFREY II DE2 CASTINAIS, GEOFFREY I DE1) was born 25 Mar 1133 in LeMans, France, and died 06 Jul 1189 in Chinon Castle, Anjou. He married (1) ELEONORE OF AQUITAINE 18 May 1152 in Bordeaux, Gironde, France, daughter of GUILLAUME X and ELBEANOR DECHATELLERAULT. She was born Bet. 1121 - 1122, and died 31 Mar 1204 in Poitiers, Poitou, Aquitaine, France. He met (2) ROSAMOND DE CLIFFORD 1160. He married (3) IDA ISABELLE DETOENI Abt. 1172, daughter of RALPH DETOENI and MARGARET DEBEAUMONT. She was born Abt. 1155 in Flamstead, Hertfordshire, England.\n\nNotes for HENRY OF ENGLAND II:\n\nKING HENRY II of ENGLAND, son of Matilda, or Maud, of England and her husband, Geoffrey Plantagenet, was born at Le Mans, 25 March 1133 and died at Chinon, 6 July 1189. In 1152 he married Eleanor of Aquitaine, former wife of Louis VII, of France, and daughter of William, Duke of Aquitaine. She survived King Henry nearly three years, dying 26 June 1202. Both were buried at Fontrevaud in Anjou. Their daughter Elennor married Alphonse IX, King of Castile; their eldest son William, died at the age of four years, their second son, Henry, born 28 Feb. 1155, who on 15 July 1170, by command of his father, was crowned King of England, but died before his father, 11 July 1183, their third son, Richard the Lion Hearted, reigned as King of England from 1189 to 1199. He was the most prominent leader on the Third Crusade to regain Jerusalem for the Christians from the Mohammedans. He had greater military genius, but less statesmanship than his father; was fickle, but warmhearted. His great power was in his physical and mental capacity as a soldier, and in his strenuous and irrepressible courage. Richard was proud, cruel and treacherous. He left the goverment of England in the hands of his Justiciars, and was in his English Kingdom but twice in his reign of ten years; four months at the time of his coronation, and two months, five years later. The Third Crusade was a failure. Richard fell out with the French King, and refused to marry his sister Alice, to whom he had been betrothed since early childhood, but on 12 May 1191, he married Perengaria of Navarre. HE DIED WITHOUT ISSUE. The fourth son of Henry II, Geoffrey, had a son Arthur, who was murdered in 1203, leaving as successor to the throne of England; (*See Note Below)\n\nHenry II (1154-1189)\n\nBorn: 5th March 1133 at Le Mans, Maine\n\nDied: 6th July 1189 at Chinon Castle, Anjou\n\nBuried: Fontevrault Abbey, Anjou\n\nParents: Geoffrey, Count of Anjou and the Empress Matilda\n\nSiblings: Geoffrey, Count of Nantes & William, Count of Poitou\n\nCrowned: 19th December 1154 at Westminster Abbey, Middlesex\n\nMarried: 18th May 1152 at Bordeaux Cathedral, Gascony\n\nSpouse: Eleanor daughter of William X, Duke of Aquitane & divorcee of Louis VII, King of France\n\nOffspring: William, Henry, Matilda, Richard, Geoffrey, Eleanor, Joan & John\n\nContemporaries: Louis VII (King of France, 1137-1180), Thomas Beckett (Archbishop of Canterbury), Pope Adrian IV, Frederick I (Frederick Barbarossa, Holy Roman Emperor, 1152-1190)\n\nHenry II, first of the Angevin kings, was one of the most effective of all England's monarchs. He came to the throne amid the anarchy of Stephen's reign and promptly collared his errant barons. He refined Norman government and created a capable, self-standing bureaucracy. His energy was equaled only by his ambition and intelligence. Henry survived wars, rebellion, and controversy to successfully rule one of the Middle Ages' most powerful kingdoms.\n\nHenry was raised in the French province of Anjou and first visited England in 1142 to defend his mother's claim to the disputed throne of Stephen. His continental possessions were already vast before his coronation: He acquired Normandy and Anjou upon the death of his father in September 1151, and his French holdings more than doubled with his marriage to Eleanor of Aquitane (ex-wife of King Louis VII of France). In accordance with the Treaty of Wallingford, a succession agreement signed by Stephen and Matilda in 1153, Henry was crowned in October 1154. The continental empire ruled by Henry and his sons included the French counties of Brittany, Maine, Poitou, Touraine, Gascony, Anjou, Aquitane, and Normandy. Henry was technically a feudal vassal of the king of France but, in reality, owned more territory and was more powerful than his French lord. Although King John (Henry's son) lost most of the English holdings in France, English kings laid claim to the French throne until the fifteenth century. Henry also extended his territory in the British Isles in two significant ways. First, he retrieved Cumbria and Northumbria form Malcom IV of Scotland and settled the Anglo-Scot border in the North. Secondly, although his success with Welsh campaigns was limited, Henry invaded Ireland and secured an English presence on the island.\n\nEnglish and Norman barons in Stephen's reign manipulated feudal law to undermine royal authority; Henry instituted many reforms to weaken traditional feudal ties and strengthen his position. Unauthorized castles built during the previous reign were razed. Monetary payments replaced military service as the primary duty of vassals. The Exchequer was revitalized to enforce accurate record keeping and tax collection. Incompetent sheriffs were replaced and the authority of royal courts was expanded. Henry empowered a new social class of government clerks that stabilized procedure - the government could operate effectively in the king's absence and would subsequently prove sufficiently tenacious to survive the reign of incompetent kings. Henry's reforms allowed the emergence of a body of common law to replace the disparate customs of feudal and county courts. Jury trials were initiated to end the old Germanic trials by ordeal or battle. Henry's systematic approach to law provided a common basis for development of royal institutions throughout the entire realm.\n\nThe process of strengthening the royal courts, however, yielded an unexpected controversy. The church courts instituted by William the Conqueror became a safe haven for criminals of varying degree and ability, for one in fifty of the English population qualified as clerics. Henry wished to transfer sentencing in such cases to the royal courts, as church courts merely demoted clerics to laymen. Thomas Beckett, Henry's close friend and chancellor since 1155, was named Archbishop of Canterbury in June 1162 but distanced himself from Henry and vehemently opposed the weakening of church courts. Beckett fled England in 1164, but through the intervention of Pope Adrian IV (the lone English pope), returned in 1170.He greatly angered Henry by opposing to the coronation of Prince Henry. Exasperated, Henry hastily and publicly conveyed his desire to be rid of the contentious Archbishop - four ambitious knights took the king at his word and murdered Beckett in his own cathedral on December 29, 1170. Henry endured a rather limited storm of protest over the incident and the controversy passed.\n\nHenry's plans of dividing his myriad lands and titles evoked treachery from his sons. At the encouragement - and sometimes because of the treatment - of their mother, they rebelled against their father several times, often with Louis VII of France as their accomplice. The deaths of Henry the Young King in 1183 and Geoffrey in 1186 gave no respite from his children's rebellious nature; Richard, with the assistance of Philip II Augustus of France, attacked and defeated Henry on July 4, 1189 and forced him to accept a humiliating peace. Henry II died two days later, on July 6, 1189.\n\nA few quotes from historic manuscripts shed a unique light on Henry, Eleanor, and their sons.\n\nFrom Sir Winston Churchill Kt, 1675: \"Henry II Plantagenet, the very first of that name and race, and the very greatest King that England ever knew, but withal the most unfortunate . . . his death being imputed to those only to whom himself had given life, his ungracious sons. . .\"\n\nFrom Sir Richard Baker, A Chronicle of the Kings of England: Concerning endowments of mind, he was of a spirit in the highest degree generous . . . His custom was to be always in action; for which cause, if he had no real wars, he would have feigned . . . To his children he was both indulgent and hard; for out of indulgence he caused his son henry to be crowned King in his own time; and out of hardness he caused his younger sons to rebel against him . . . He married Eleanor, daughter of William Duke of Guienne, late wife of Lewis the Seventh of France. Some say King Lewis carried her into the Holy Land, where she carried herself not very holily, but led a licentious life; and, which is the worst kind of licentiousness, in carnal familiarity with a Turk.\"\n\nKing Henry II Plantegenet, had many illlegitimate children one of which was William de Longespee.

His wife was Ida.\n\nIda later married Roger Bigod.\n\nRoger Bigod was appointed in 1189 by King Richard one of the Ambassadors to King Philip of France, to obtain aid for the recovery of the Holy Land. In 1191 he was keeper of Hereford Castle. He was chief judge in the King's Court from 1195 to 1202. In 120() he was sent by King John as one of his messengers to summon William the Lion, King of Scotland, to do homage to him in the Parliament which was held at Lincoln, and subsequently attended King John into Poitou; but on his return he was won over to the opposition by the rebel Barons and became one of the strongest advocates of the Charter of Liberty, for which he was excommunicated by Pope Innocent III He died before August 1221, having married as his first wife, Isabella daughter of Hameline Plantagenet, who was descended from the Earls of Warren.\n\nIda de Tosny was a royal ward and mistress of King Henry II, by whom she was mother of a young son William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury) (b c. 1176-March 7, 1226). Ida was not the first English royal ward to be taken as mistress by a King who was her guardian; that honour probably belongs to Isabel de Beaumont (Elizabeth de Beaumont), daughter of Robert de Beaumont, who fought at the Battle of Hastings with the Conqueror. That king's youngest son made Beaumont's daughter his mistress. Ida's ancestry was unknown for many years, but a charter by her eldest (illegitimate) son refers to his mother as the \"Countess Ida\" which pins her down to the wife of Roger Bigod. For Ida's ancestry\n\nKing John OF ENGLAND I\n\nGeneration No. 3\n\nJOHN OF7 ENGLAND I (HENRY OF6, GEOFFREY D'ANJOU5 PLANTAGENET IV, FULK4 V, FULK3 IV, GEOFFREY II DE2 CASTINAIS, GEOFFREY I DE1) was born 24 Dec 1166 in Kings Manor House, Oxford, Oxfordshire, England, and died 19 Oct 1216 in Newark Castle, Newark, Nottinghamshire, England. He married (1) AGATHA DE FERRERS, daughter of WILLIAM DE FERRERS and SYBIL DE BRAOSE. She was born Abt. 1168 in Charltey, Staffordshire, England. He married (2) ISABEL OF GLOUCESTER, daughter of WILLIAM ROBERT and HAWISE DE BEAUMONT. She was born Abt. 1170, and died 14 Oct 1217. He married (3) ADELA DE WARENNE. He married (4) ISABELLA DE TAILLEFER 24 Aug 1200 in Bordeaux Cathedral, Gascony, France, daughter of AYMER TAILLEFER and ALICE DE COURTENAY. She was born 1188 in Angoulême, Charente, France, and died 31 May 1246 in Fontevrault L'Abbe, Maine-et-Loire, France.\n\nNotes for JOHN OF ENGLAND I:\n\nKING JOHN, LACKLAND, the fifth son of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine, born at Oxford, 24 Dec. 1166, died at Newark Castle, Notts, 19 Oct. 1216, married, first on 29 August 1189, Isabel, daughter of William, Earl of Gloucester; married, second, in 1200, Isabel, daughter of Aymer de Taillefer, the Swordsmith. She was the mother of all his children. John S. Wurts, in his Magna Charta, pages 6 to 17, inclusive.\n\nPage 6; \"In case we have forgotten our English History, let us be reminded that King John was a horrid person, an arbitrary and mercenary ruler, who threw people into dungeons at the drop of a hat; married off wards of the crown, young widows and pretty girls, to foreign adventurers and then collected a nice percentage of the ward's fortunes from their husbands....... he greatly increased the royal taxes and replenished his exchequer with the confiscated property of the clergy.\n\nShortly after he became King, he quarreled with the Pope, who deposed him and proclaimed him no longer King. John ignored the deposing, and made a gift to the Pope of all the realm, crown and revenue, by written indenture, dated Monday, 13 May 1213. John then received the crown back as the Pope's tenant and vassal, at a rental of a thousand marks for the whole kingdom, 700 for England and 300 for Ireland.\n\nUnder this condition the Barons of England were only yeoman, or free-holders, or copy-holders of King John, the free-holder of the Pope, and tiring of John's tyranny, they called a conference, and one, after King John had left the Abbey at Saint-Edmundsbury (where he had been asked to attend the conference, which had been called by Stephen Langston, Archbishop of Canterbury), at which meeting nothing was accomplished, the barons took a solemn oath on the high altar, that they would stand united until they could compel the King to confirm their liberties, or they would wage war against him to the death.\n\nThey did wage war, \"a holy crusade against John to recover the liberties their forefathers had enjoyed\". Virtually powerless, and with nearly his whole Baronage and the majority of his subjects of all degrees in arms against him, he finally called his Barons to a conference. They said, \"let the day by the 15th of June and the place Runnemede\". (which is in sight of Windsor Castle, and was used as \"the field of council\").\n\nIn this way was brought about the GREATEST EVENT OF KING JOHN'S REIGN, the veritable wresting from him of MAGNA CHARTA, granting rights to the people of his realm, \"an expression in written words of the principles of human life\", which had been either grossly neglected or altogether forgotten by the King.\n\nSection 61 of the Chart authorized the election of twenty five Surety Barons, who would see that the previsions of the Charter were carried into effect. Their names are not recorded in the Magna Charta, \"but we learn them from Matthew Paris' \"Chronilca Majora\".\"\n\nThese Barons were astonishingly inter-related. Among them were several instances of father and son, of father-in-law and son-in-law, of brothers and cousins. Twenty of the twenty five were related in the degree of second cousin, or nearer. Of these twenty five, only seventeen have descendants surviving to the present day. They had a common descent from Charlemagne.\n\nOn the 15th day of June, 1215, more than two thousand Knights and Barons were encamped on the field of Runnemede to await the coming of King John and secure from him the rights of the people of England, although John had previously sworn by \"God's teeth\", his favorite oath, that he would never agree to such demands or any part of them.\n\n(Runnemede was the \"ancient meadow of council\", and is within sight of Windsor Castle. For ages, this had been crownland and rented for pasturage. When it was proposed a few years ago ((from Crown Edition of Magna Charta, Reprint 1945)), to sell the field of Runnemede to the highest bidder, a great outcry arose. (The former Cara Rogers, now Lady Fairhaven, an American girl, a member of the Magna Charta Dames, bought and presented to the British people the field of Runnemede, as a memorial to her husband, to be kept for all time as a sacred, historic spot.)\n\nOn 15 June 1215, before the day passed, the King affixed his seal to the original, but preliminary draft known as the \"Articles of the Barons\", which contained forty nine articles, setting forth the principles of the Charter. The exact terms of the Charter were decided upon during the four days that followed. On the 19th of June 1215, the great seal was affixed, presumably to twenty five duplicate copies, perhaps one for each of the twenty five Surety Barons, who were to see that King John kept his promises.\n\nNeither the King, the Barons, nor the Knights could read or write, except a few, but a scholar, who was the Secretary of the Baron of Kendal, had accompanied him to Runnemede.\n\nDESCENT OF ISAREL DE TAILLEFUR, second Wife of KING JOHN OF ENGLAND from CHARLEMAGNE:\n\nMore About JOHN OF ENGLAND I:\n\nBurial: Worcester, Cathedral\n\nNotes for ISABELLA DE TAILLEFER:\n\nShe was the mother of all his children.

It is located on the north side of the James River at one of the bends of that stream and he called this place \"Curles Neck\", and it was known to the public as early as 1617.

The two secondary sources I've found give different dates, one 1660 and the other 1664. Tidewater Virginia Families, page 405 says \"Robert Woodson, Jr. was the son of Robert and Elizabeth Woodson. He was born in Henrico Co. in 1664, from a deposition he gave on April 1, 1687. He stated that he was about 23 years old at that time. \"Historical Genealogy of the Woodsons and Their Connections\" gives the date as about 1660 at Curles in Henrico Co., VA.\n\nHe died in 1729 in Henrico Co, VA.\n\nThe date of death has not been proven, but has been established from his will, which was recorded in Henrico County in February 1729. He signed a will in 1729 in Henrico Co., VA.\n\nThe will of Robert Woodson, recorded Henrico Co., VA Feb 1729, mentions: to son Stephen, the land that came in my possession by marriage with his mother, also 50 acres that belonged to John Lewis; to son Joseph, a parcel in Goochland Co. on WS Jennytoe Creek, up Rocky Branch and next to Joseph Parsons' line, also a negro and items; to son Robert, the residue of land in Goochland on Jennytoe Creek; to son Jonathan, land near White Oak Swamp between Richard Cocke, Edward Mosby and Harryson, and his estate to be under the guardianship of my son Stephen until he is 18; to Daughter Elizabeth, a negro and items; to daughter Judith a negro and items; to daughter Agnes, a negro.

His will was recorded Feb 1729 and named 4 sons and 3 daughters.\n\nb) \"Tidewater Virginia Families\" says he named 7 of his children in the will: Stephen, Joseph, Robert, Jonathan, Elizabeth, Judith and Agnes Woodson.\n\nRobert Woodson appears to be the son of Robert Woodson and Elizabeth Ferris. According to \"Tidewater Virginia Families\" by Virginia L. H. Davis, there does not appear to be any record of the births of Robert's children, but John Woodson, brother of the senior Robert Woodson, named his nephews, the youngest children of his brother Robert, in his will. Robert was among those named.\n\nThere is some questions as to how many times Robert Woodson married. The \"Historical Genealogy of the Woodsons and Their Connections\" notes on page 25 that he was twice married, first to Sarah Lewis, then to Rachel Watkins. Tidewater Virginia Families says Sarah Lewis was his second marriage, the first being Elizabeth Lewis, one of the orphans of John Lewis, Sr. deceased, and the third marriage was to Rachel Watkins.\n\nAccording to Tidewater Virginia Families, his marriage to Sarah Lewis, a daughter of John Lewis, is on record in Henrico County, VA, the license returned to the Henrico court in October 1692. \"Records of Henrico Co. 1666-1771\" IGA film #0908962, Lic. 11 Nov 1691 Robert Woodson Jr. to Sarah Lewis. \"The Annals and History of Henrico Parish Diocese of Virginia\" by J. Staunton Moore, includes the 1691 marriage of Robert Woodson, Jr. to Sarah Lewis on page 226.\n\nAlso, according to The \"Historical Genealogy of the Woodsons and Their Connections, \" on page 33, their son Stephen was born about 1682 in Henrico County.\n\nAccording to the Historical Genealogy noted above, Sarah Lewis may have been the sister of John Lewis of Warner Hall.\n\nHe was married to Sarah Lewis (daughter of John Lewis) in 1691 in St. John's, Henrico Parish, VA.(6)\n\nOther sources include: Tidewater Virginia Families, his marriage to Sarah Lewis, a daughter of John Lewis, is on record in Henrico County, VA, the license returned to the Henrico court in October 1692. \"Records of Henrico Co. 1666-1771\" IGA film #0908962, Lic. 11 Nov 1691 Robert Woodson Jr. to Sarah Lewis. \"The Annals and History of Henrico Parish Diocese of Virginia\" by J.

According to the \"Historical Genealogy of the Woodsons and Their Connections\" compiled by Henry Morton Woodson and published in 1915, Sarah Lewis may have been the sister of John Lewis of Warner Hall.

He witnessed an Amelia Co. deed in 1762 (GET CITATION- -CAN'T FIND IT), and in May 1763, the Chesterfield County Court judged a slave Jerry belonging to Josiah Womack to be six years old (CO 2: 403 ). In 1772, Josiah is designated \"of Chesterfield Co.,\" when he purchased land in Amelia County from Thomas Ball ( Amelia DB 11: 492 ). He is found in the Amelia Tax lists for 1782 ( Listed with 6 whites and four blacks ), and 1785 ( seven whites, 1 dwelling, and three other buildings ). He also appears on the 1787 list, apparently in Nottoway Parish, which became Nottoway County in 1789. On 31 Jan. 1786, however, Richard Harrison of Georgia sold in 200 acres on Juniper Creek in Lunenburg Co. to Josiah Womack, designated of Amelia Co.

It says she was born in 1811 in Nottoway Co, VA. The\n\ntax records I have show that William Womack, son of Josiah Womack & Keziah Wilkinson, was listed as tax payer in Nottoway from 1799-1807, often right next\n\nto his father or mother. I think it is a good bet this was you William.\n\n-Robert\n\nFor years I assumed our William was the son of Francis, son of Thomas Womack and Mary Farley based on others research and LDS records that can never be trusted. I always had my doubts for lack of records, however based on the DNA evidence from the Womack DNA project showing my DNA match more likely from Richards line and the above paragraph indicate Josiah Womack and Keziah Wilkenson as the likely parents of our William.

I have bin sick ever since last fall, sometimes veary bad, but thank God I have got some better. I hope these lines will shortly be in your hands that now goes from me your poor afflicted mother and hope they may find you enjoying good health and that your mind and notions are turning toward Virginia again.\n\nOh, My William, What could posess you to leave all your friends and go so far away? Do my dear child come back and let me see you once more. I hope you have no family to take care of and if you have not you can do as well here as you need to --- and here you would be with your friends which ought to be more satisfaction to you than to be with no connections at all.\n\nYour brother James is living with Mr. Austin learning the Carpenter,s trade and says he will try to find you as soon as he can, but you my William, come in and work with James. He gets fifty-five dollars this year.\n\nDear Son, I must now inform you we received letter from you in june last and answered it in a few days and have not heard nor seen a word from you since. Your sister Catherine and James and Larkin and John.... your brothers heard it read. Leroy was in Lynchburg and Larkin is living with him at Mr. John Thirmons (?) learning the saddlers trade. I have not seen your sister Catherine nor Joseph nor James since before Christmas.\n\nI am living with Mr. Little. He is overseer for Mr. Richard Chilton at the tole gate trading in Lynchburg. You are well acquinted with the place. Mr. Little says he intends to try to come next fall if he can. He wants to know how the price of everything generally is. His wages this year is a hundred and fifty dollars, 5 barrels corn and five hundred weight of pork and a milk cow.\n\nLet us know if you are much pleased with the Illinois State and what sort of a place it is and be sure to let us know in your letter whither you intend to come and see us or stay with us and when we may look for you. I hope you will start as soon as you get this for we want to see you much. None of your brothers nor your sister Catherine is not present but all want to see you and would join me in love to you. Little Mary Catherine says you must come here. My Dear Son I feel sorely at this time. I can hardly set to rite. I must conclude my letter. Answer this as soon as possible and direct your letter to Lynchburg Post Office. Also direct it to Mr. John Little.\n\nI remain your loving mother untill death,\n\nCatherine P.

I am not well, but am always poly, and am more so now than I was when you left me. I have been with your brother Joseph's family ever since the first of August and Joseph and James joines with me writeing to you. They have had bad coles but have got better of them. Your sisters and younger brothers was well when I heard from them last. They are all living in Lynchburg.\n\nI hope dear William these few lines will find you injoying good health and now I will try to inform you your favoured letter came to hand perhaps about the middle of september which informed us you had been veary sick with the ague and fever. Mr. Little received your letter in town. As I understood he was veary unwell I suppose at that time and was taken veary shortly after that with the severe fever and died the 25th day of September and was brought from near Lynchburg Whare he lived to Goodmans Graveyard and was buried about ten days before he was. Same lay veary low for a long time but has recovered.\n\nDear Son, when death parts loving friends we must submit, but when loving children will take themselves far away in a distant land leaving all connections behind for no cause, it is grievious. William reflect on this-you are my flesh and my bone and I cannot come to you but you can come to me. If the Lord please, I hope I shall see you this Spring if life and health permit. James has bin veary anctious to wander as you have done, but now he finds himself a doing veary well. He is getting twelve dollars per month and has nearly got his trade and says you can get more here to work in plantation business than you get whare you are.\n\nJoseph wishes you would come. He wants to move to some part of the World whare he can do better for his family, but I do not expect he will ever more many miles from whare he is. They have three children- William Henry, Mary Ann Rebecah, and Elizabeth Jane.\n\nI hope son William you have no inclination to have a family yet and if so I do truly wish you to come immediately. You can get work aplenty. James would be so glad for you to come and work with him. He has been with Mr. Austin Lane--this is the fourth year. He gave him wages every year and has nearly got his trade and he would hire you at a word if you would come. You must come now. When you get this you must sit down and write a few lines that you will be here in a veary short time if the Lord permits and then collect on what you have owing to you and start immediately, and it would please me well. O William don't let me be disappointed in my hope of seeing you once more in this world. I expect to go to Lynchburg veary shortly to stay with the guerls and when you write to me direct your letter to Lynchburg Post Office. James wants you to write to him and direct his to Campbeel Courthouse. Be certain to answer this as soon as possible, dear son. I must conclude with our best love to you and all the best wishes that a mother can afford, so farewell sweet William my son for this time.\n\nI remain your loving mother untill death.\n\nCatherine Womack\n\nJoseph P.

We received your letter dated the 14th ov November. I do not mind exactly the time, but it found us in tolerable health except your brother Larkin. He was veary low at that time with the fever. He lived untill the thirteenth day after he was taken without eating anything except chicken water and some kind of tea. Nothing else was allowed him untill the thirteenth day and then one spoonful of veary thin mush and a half cup of milk.\n\nYou must expect my dear William that my dear Larkin was most gone and so he did seem to be but he was willin to die, as Mrs.____ told me, the lady whare he lives. His and your sister Catherine nursed him in his sickness, but I went severil times while he lay sick, which I think was about six weeks cinfinement to the house, but the Lord was pleased to raise him from the bed of affliction and I saw him last thirsday evening. He was in good health of body and of soul too apparently. He is a veary pious youth and if you hear him preaching the Gospel you need not be at all alarmed. He has commenced going to school and is free the 27th of next January and seems to take such delight in the ways and worship of God. And John is still going on in religious ways, And O my William do you not think that a grate comfort to me? And would it not be a greater one still to hear in your next letter you embraced religion? You say in your letter you nor your wife had not profest religion, and you have regular meetings with the Methodists, Baptists, and Presbiterians.\n\nWell, my son, so you and your wife attend to preaching and do you wish to get religion? Then if you do get down on your knees and pray to God to have mercy on you and show you your sinful state that you are in by nature for ye must be born again or ye cannot see the Kingdom of God. Oh, my William. read the bible a great deal and attend to preaching and if there is any revival out with you write me word in your next letter and I pray you my dear son and daughter in law, be you both at the alter that the people of God may pray for your dear souls.\n\nWhen you read this think on whom it is ritten these few lines once more. Tis your dear old mother, and I pray you remember what I say to you on this paper and let it sink deep in your minds. What doth it profit a man to gain the hole world and lose his own soul? oh, my son, try to save your precious ans never dying soul. Lay not up treasures on earth whare moth and rust doth corrupt and whare theves brake through and stele, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven whare neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and whare theves do not brake through nor steal, for whare your treasure is there will your heart be also. let us all try to meet in heaven.\n\nNow I must inform you we are in common health at present as far as I know and hope this will find you and all yours in good health. I have not seen Joseph since before last Christmas. He has gone to Halifax to live. I saw James not long since. He was in common health.\n\nNow Dear Son, do you not think of ever coming home to see us? We would be so glad to see you and your little family. John says he thinks you might come if you try rite. And now William, try and come and let us know in your next letter whither you intend to try and come. So farewell, my William, for this time. Your brothers nor sisters Catherine is not preasent to joine with me in love to you and family but you may except of it with mine.\n\nI remain your loving affectionate mother untill death.\n\nCatherine A.

He seems to wish you all the good he can for your soules salvation and so do I, and re-read his letter, my son, untill you can understand it and meditate on it also. Altho he is younger than you he is much improved in religion and expects to joine the next conference. He seems to be much respected for his piety and seems to delight in religious worship very much. O my William, I wish you and all my other children were as earnest in gaining your soul's salvation as my dear Larkin is.\n\nDear Son, I have written a letter to you some months back. I have not received any answer from it yet for which cause I expect you have not received it, as we understand in Leroy's letter received from you that you have moved three hundred miles from whare you was living. And why could you not have come nearer to us as well as to go no farther from us? I may say farewell, for my William I may never expect to see you any more in the land amongst the living.\n\nWell, dear son, answer this as soon as possible and let us know whether you have embraced religion yet and whither you are trying for that blessing and your dear companion with you. O strive to get to heaven and teach your children to learn the way...\n\nDear children, excuse all amiss on this paper. James and Leroy is both married as we understand. None of us was at the marriages. James was married when in Pitsylvaney to a Miss Yancy.\n\nI must conclude. Our love to you and family. I am your affectionate mother untill death.\n\nCatherine A.

WOMACK was born January 27, 1822 in Campbell Co., VA, and died 1886 in Scott Co., AR. He married (1) MARY CATHERINE TAYLOR Abt. 1845, daughter of JORDAN TAYLOR. She was born 1826 in Buckingham Co., VA, and died Aft. December 06, 1868 in Coffee Co., TN. He married (2) RUTH MORRIS MEEKS 1878 in Coffee Co., TN. She was born March 24, 1836, and died January 12, 1911 in Scott Co., AR.\n\nLarkin was a Methodist in Lynchburg, Virginia. During the Civil War he owned a hotel in Tennessee and turned it into a Confederate Hospital at that time. It is said to be still standing in Coffee County. He was very much a southern man, a definite confederate.\n\nLarkin Womack, William D. Taylor and Charles H. Taylor, were all \"Tinners\" (Traders) just as Hudson Blankenship who established the route to and from Bristol and his son Henry Blankenship who lived next door to William and Catherine Womack 1820 in Campbell County, Virginia. Larkin (per tax records, paid taxes in Buckingham County, VA., thru 1856.) Larkin and Mary Taylor lived in Bristal Co., Tennessee. Real estate value $ 2400. His neighbor on one side was Rev., James C. King and wife whose daughter had married the banker Joseph R. Anderson. on the other side of Larkin was a hotel. Per deeds, after June 1860, Larkin purchased lots 46,64,and 66. which included the Exchange Hotel and this property included all between 4th Street and 6th Street (now Olive Street).\n\nAll of the pay vouchers for Larkin Womack Private, Co. K, 4th VA., Rgt., Case., Fitzhugh Lee Brigade, under Captain Heath and Lt. Terry have not been found--but those we have indicate that by August 1863, he was in this company, he had enlisted for \"three years or end of War\" and he had been paid through 1 June 1864 --so we assume he was still in this company April 1865 . This Regiment had been re-organized and 10th company had been added. May 23,1862 the day Fannie Otey Womack was born, it appears Kate was returning to Buckingham Co., VA., for the births of her children but due to the War , had evacuated to Richmond, Many of the Taylors were staying in homes on Franklin Street, Richmond, VA., (as was Mrs. Robert E. Lee during this period).\n\nAfter the birth of their last child, Mary Taylor passed away as a result of birth complications. Years later Larkin married Ruth Morris Meeks (our lineage) and had George Farris Womack.\n\nBuried, Pilot Prarie Cemetery, Scott County, AR.\n\nSOURCE: F. Mae Doria, 1303 Nor Vandalia, Tulsa, OK., (deceased). Larkin was an apprentice to John Thurmond, Lynchburg, Va., a saddler. He was a preacher, Mason, a Democrat and served in the C.S.A. He was located in 1844 at Lynchburg, Va; in 1846 in NC.; in 1850 he was in Buckingham Co., Va., in 1860 in Sullivan Co., Tn.; 23 May 1863 in Richmond, Va.; Apr 1865 at Appomattox with Fitzburge Lee; in 1866 in Tn.; in 1880 in Coffee Co., Tn.; 1883 - 1899 in Waldron, Scott Co., Ar.\n\nThe following letter was written by Larkin, to his older brother William in Illinois.\n\nLynchburgh, Virginia February 28, 1843\n\nDear Brother,\n\nI take this opportunity to inform you that we are in common health at present, what few thare is of us togather. And I hope these few lines may finde you all injoying good health.\n\nDear Brother, we received your letter directed to Leroy sometime since and I was very glad to heare from you and to find that you were on this side of eternity for I had not heard from you for so long. I did not know whither you were dead or alive. But it would have comforted me mutch more if I could have heard that you were on your way to heaven, as I know not whither we shall ever meet again in this world, but I hope that we shall in a betterone. And now I wish you to make a start for heaven and try to meeta brother who loves your soul.\n\nI feel it my duty to warn you of your doom for without holyness noman can see the face of God in peace. My friend, do you know whare youare going? Have you reflected what you are engaged in? Is it an object you will be able to think upon tomorrow with pleasure? Wold you pursue it if you were sure you would die tonight? Have you asked God, or can you ask God to bless it? If you have not done this, if you cannot do this, then reflect. For all these things God will bring you into judgement. Ecclesiastes 11:9.\n\nStop and consider before it is too late. Thare is yet time but you know not how short it may bee. O flee to the Savior for the pardon of your sins - pray that devine grace may be given you. Entreat the Holy Spirit to convince you of the evil of sin and its dredful consequences and to influence your heart and mind to those things which alone can bring you peace at the last. Read the Bible. All these things are taught therein.\n\nResides, the heavenly world with all its glory and felicity would be a place of torment to an unholy mind. Shold the sinner with his unholy heart and character be admited into the regions of the blessed what would he find suited to his desires and reigning temper of heart? He would find the character of everything totally opposed to his own. He would find himself perfectly alone - no one to associate with him among all the millions of heavenly host.\n\nAs I expect ere long to be standing on the walls of Zion to proclame the glad tidings of Christ to a lost and ruined world and now I proclame to you and beseack you by heaven to repent and believe the gospel before it shall be everlastingly too late. I know not that I shall ever see you again in this world, but I hope ere long we shall shack hands on the banks of eternal deliverence....whatever you find amiss forgive.\n\nNothing more at present, but I remain your brother untill death.
