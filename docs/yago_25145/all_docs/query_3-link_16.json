She wanted her son's fiancée, if she were not Catholic, to convert before marriage. England wanted Maud to convert after the marriage, even Pope Leo XIII accepted this condition for marriage. According to Foreign Minister Benedetto Brin the Queen of Italy was against the union because she did not want to be overshadowed by the arrival of the young and charming daughter-in-law.\n\nI have read in some places that Victor Emanuel did not like Maud because he found her too similar to his mother. I remember that a newspaper archives of 1891 said that Maud had despised Victor Emanuel during his visit to London in June, if I am not mistaken. Although not very sympathetic to read their biographies we can see that they both had very similar characteristics, especially the taste for a silent life and the fact that both are more bourgeois than royals.\n\nBut what if the marriage had come true? What could have been different? Would Maud have easily adapted to the Italian court? Would it have been well accepted by the population being an old Protestant? Had the marriage been popular among the English? Would such a union have an effect on Italian politics? How would the Triple Alliance have received such a union? Another question that comes to mind, marrying an Italian would have made Maud lose her dowry and her annual income she received from the civil list?\n\nStill in that scenario with whom Carl and Helena would marry?\n\nIn the early 1890s the court of Savoy attempted to marry Victor Emanuel, the Prince of Naples with Princess Maud of Wales.

Another question that comes to mind, marrying an Italian would have made Maud lose her dowry and her annual income she received from the civil list?\n\nStill in that scenario with whom Carl and Helena would marry?\n\nWell, if someone (Umberto or one of his ministers) realizes that Margherita is putting a spoke in the wheel, and they can manage to sideline her (so to speak), it might work. If even the pope is on board with a post-nuptial conversion, then it should demonstrate how pedantic Margie is being.\n\nAs to Maud despising Victor? Are you sure? Despise is a long way from hate, and no offense, but it's hardly as though Victor's own parents were the picture of marital bliss. Not to mention, I'd take what's printed in a newspaper about royalty with a pinch of salt. Look how easily they matched up royals in those days to make sales. Sex sells. Hate sells.\n\nAs to her being formerly Protestant, I'm not sure it will necessarily be any worse than OTL. Elena of Montenegro was formerly Orthodox and she converted and it's hardly as though the Italians were rioting in the streets or something IIRC. As to the marriage being popular among the English - the newspapers that are saying Maud despised Victor are probably chanelling a latent fear of papistry in the royal family (you see it when there are rumours that Maud's aunt, Louise is being considered for the comte de Paris, when Beatrice is rumoured to be getting engaged to the Prince Imperial etc etc). Strangely, there was little hysteria about getting a Catholic queen with Eddy-Hélène d'Orléans AFAIK. Better for the Protestant English to believe their princess hates a papist prince than that she'd actually be considering him.\n\nAt the end of the day, however, I'd suggest that the marriage would probably have to be spun as a love match. That's the only way the English might swallow it. I can't see why she'd lose her dowry. In fact, her dowry might be larger, since she's marrying a king rather than a second-son. But, her annual income from the civil list is presumably gone. No way a predominantly Protestant parliament is going to fund her (or a possible child of hers) if she marries a Catholic.\n\nAs to Maud despising Victor? Are you sure?

Not to mention, I'd take what's printed in a newspaper about royalty with a pinch of salt. Look how easily they matched up royals in those days to make sales. Sex sells. Hate sells.\n\nThat makes perfect sense.\n\nHowever I do not understand how both of them did not get along if the older ones ended up having similar personalities. I have been reading the biography of Victor Emanuel on the wiki and says that he came to be known as the Socialist King, and was progressive and liberal. Once, when he was in Russia, he seems to have said that if he lived, he would be a revolutionary. Already Maud was a champion of women's participation in sports, and the Norwegian ministers even asked Carl to tell her to moderate after she supported a single-parent house. They could have had a harmonious marriage. Another thing I do not understand, and Margueritta's lack of intelligence to dissipate an alliance between her son and a prince of Wales daughter\n\nHowever I do not understand how both of them did not get along if the older ones ended up having similar personalities\n\nToo much the same perhaps?\n\nAs to Margie, I'm not sure. If a princess-consort of Monaco (Gibert-Lametz) could see that getting one of Victoria's daughters/granddaughters for her son was a way to go (politically speaking), one would think that Margherita would be astute to enough to overlook a young/charming bride for her son. Besides, it's not like either Alix or Dagmar's daughters were likely to go out of their way to usurp Margie's limelight - IIRC, all of them were more the timid and retiring sort - why we ended up with Toria in London and Olga in Russia who served as mommy's glorified lady-in-waiting (as one author put it). Maud will probably walk one step behind her mother-in-law until Umberto dies. But when that happens, Margie is likely to be reminded very politely that she a mere princess of Italy and dowager queen is to yield precedence to the new king's wife.\n\nAs to Margie, I'm not sure.

But when that happens, Margie is likely to be reminded very politely that she a mere princess of Italy and dowager queen is to yield precedence to the new king's wife.\n\nI think Margie would be a bad mother-in-law, maybe she followed Maud's envy or antipathy if she tried to dominate the court. From what I know of Maud, she might have been accepted by the widow for a long time, since she was shy, and she did not much appreciate representations, something she would certainly be content to give to Margie - I loved Margueritta's nickname as a sign haha One question about the widow, Was she liberal or conservative?\n\nToo much the same perhaps?\n\nCertainly\n\nBesides, it's not like either Alix or Dagmar's daughters were likely to go out of their way to usurp Margie's limelight - IIRC, all of them were more the timid and retiring sort - why we ended up with Toria in London and Olga in Russia who served as mommy's glorified lady-in-waiting (as one author put it).\n\nAbout Toria I think part of the fault of not having married was hers. I believe she was even intent on marrying Rosebery and the impossibility of such a marriage occurring discouraged her. When Maud married Charles, and Prince Christian of denmark proposed the princess, who in turn refused and even Alix was astonished at the princess's refusal. Toria also turned down May's brother, Adolphus, another marriage that Alix would not be so against, for he would keep Toria very close to her. If she really wanted to marry, she would have married. About Olga, did she have any other suitors besides Peter? I could never find anything about the marriage plans for her other than her engagement and failed marriage to Oldenburg\n\nI've never heard about Roseberry or Dolly of Teck, but either could be fun for Toria.\n\nIn fact Toria was in love with Rosebery, but marriage was impossible since he was prime minister at the time and the family should remain neutral as to politics. Ja dolly must have courted Toria on obvious issues, her mother was a princess and must have encouraged him, may have married into the royal family, and a marriage of Maud with her brother was expected, but that actually happened. Another good candidate dismissed, this time by Alix, was Max of Baden, that Maud had a fall but he was not interested in her, but in Toria. In the late 1890s it was also thought of for George of Grecce, but at that time the rumor was that she was in love with a Baron, Revelstoke, although I did not know what prevented the union.\n\nHowever, as regards Olga, considering the shock with which both the emperor and Maria Feodorovna received the news of Olga's engagement, I get the impression that they never planned for her to marry.\n\nAbout Olga and a lot of selfishness from her mother who had a very happy marriage, not having planned a good marriage for her daughter. So many princes available and she encouraging poor olga to marry Peter. Would not Olga be a good match for Alexander of Serbia? or maybe Albert of Belgium?\n\nOne question about the widow, Was she liberal or conservative?\n\nConservative, AFAIK. Considering that Carol I wanted to marry Margherita OTL, I'm guessing she wasn't the most liberal of people.\n\nFrom her wiki article:\n\nShe disliked the tolerance of democracy displayed by her son, the king, which she viewed as a form of socialistic monarchy, and worked to ensure the monarchical traditions as much as she could against democratic tendencies.[30] Her son did not wish to allow her any influence in state affairs, but she remained involved in politics through her connections and remained a political figure\n\nHowever, she later became pro-Mussolini, apparently\n\nor maybe Albert of Belgium?\n\nAl's a Catholic. Plus, Maria Pavlovna (Mieche-Miechen) already hoped for him to marry her daughter, Elena Vladimirovna. I can't see such a match being agreed to by the ultra-Orthodox Nikolai II. As to Alexander of Serbia, 'm not sure. Milan of Serbia was pissed by Alex's marriage to Draga Masin, because he'd arranged for a marriage with Alexandrine of Schaumburg-Lippe when his son married. Also, Alex's mom was pro-Russian, something which wasn't popular with the pro-Austrian Milan. But, Serbian history isn't my forte, and a marriage between Olga and the Obrenovic prince could be interesting (if slightly unlikely, Minnie's selfishness, Nicky's antipathy and the situation in Serbia might combine to make it downright impossible).\n\nConservative, AFAIK.

Although, my take on Olga is that the best bet for her as regards marriage would be a second son who can come set up house in Russia. Although her sister, Xenia, has already married domestically, so it might be better if she does go abroad. Her mom's anti-German tendencies will make it difficult. Perhaps somebody likewise dispossessed by the German empire? Hesse? Hannover's a cousin, so I don't think so. Nassau? Württemberg wasn't dispossessed per se, but they were no fans of Berlin IIRC. In Denmark the princes are her first cousins, in Sweden they'd be acceptable (the Blue Duchess (Sophie of Nassau) was queen and she was anti-German as Minnie, but Viktoria of Baden was very pro-Kaiser AFAIK).\n\nSerbia's problematic for 2 reasons, surprisingly, neither having to do with Alexander's appearance. One, it's a new throne, born of civil war with a parvenu dynasty. And two, the situation in the country is unstable (even for the Balkans). This article points out that Alexander's assassination and the Karadeordevic accession thereafter actually set Serbia off on the road to WWI without realizing it. However, I would say that the two aforementioned reasons about why Serbia was problematic mean that a Russian grand duchess for a queen is unlikely. Still less the sister of the emperor. Let Draga die of something before the wedding (or shortly thereafter, say her phantom pregnancy is real and she dies along with the child giving birth). Alexander then remarries to someone neither Austrian nor Russian (AIUI, the princess proposed was closer to the Prussian royals).\n\nStaying with the Balkans, what about letting Olga marry Prince Wilhelm of Wied? He wasn't overly important, could set up house in Russia, and was related to the Hohenzollerns only tangentially (his sister was queen of Romania, his mother was a princess of the Netherlands, his cousin was queen of Denmark (Lovisa of Sweden), and his maternal grandmother was a Prussian princess).\n\nI just took antipathy from margueritta\n\nIt wasn't antipathy. Rather, Margherita didn't want to marry someone where she would be forced to live in another country.

Rather, Margherita didn't want to marry someone where she would be forced to live in another country. Had Umberto-Mathilde of Teschen's match gone through, Margie might end up abroad anyway.\n\nMy understanding was that Olga didn't want to leave Russia - Peter's mother was very keen he marry Olga and pushed him towards the goal - Olga herself implied her mother and his cooked it up and she went along with it to ensure she could stay in Russia. Certainly it satisfied Marie Feodorovna as it kept 'Baby' at home and at her beck and call. Olga's biography from the fifties certainly implies she was pushed into it - but the book airbrushes a lot of her life.\n\nQueen Victoria and the Empress Frederick were quite concerned that Alix and Bertie were not doing more to get their daughter's married, but Toria seemed happy as her mother's companion (she remained exceptionally close to her siblings throughout their lives) - in part i suppose it was Alexandra's influence that the poor woman stayed at home for the rest of her life - as one cousin said \"a glorified\" maid to her mother. She certainly was not the happiest of women after her mother's deaths - her nephews were convinced she happily relayed any bad behaviour to their father the King, and she didn't have the best of relationships with her sister (poor May with her Wurttemburg hands).\n\nDifficult but not impossible.

Perhaps the prince danilo de montenegro could be an option? Nicky and Alix were close to the montenegro siblings and could '' put together '' a marriage between them. Prince Adolf Frederick of Mecklemburg Strelitz and Alexander Georgievich of Leuchtenberg could be good for her as well.\n\nQueen Victoria and the Empress Frederick were quite concerned that Alix and Bertie were not doing more to get their daughter's married, but Toria seemed happy as her mother's companion (she remained exceptionally close to her siblings throughout their lives) - in part i suppose it was Alexandra's influence that the poor woman stayed at home for the rest of her life - as one cousin said \"a glorified\" maid to her mother.

Much is speculated about her marriage and how much Alix tried to prevent her from getting married, though Louise, who was by far the most shy of the sisters, marry. Toria was courted by dolly of teck, which although poor was very handsome, but refused. She was then asked to marry by Christian of denmark but refused. I do not know exactly why she refused the princes, though I read that King George I of Greece had even noted in her diary about Toria and Christian's engagement, and her parents were surprised by her refusal. Newspapers of the time also claimed his involvement with George of Greece, and in 1892 an engagement between her and Willian of Luxembourg was announced by some newspapers, though I do not know much about it. anyway she had a chance to get married but it seems she did not want any of the princes she wanted. Maybe she really did not want to get married just.\n\nWilliam of Wied seems so little to a grand duchess. Perhaps the prince danilo de montenegro could be an option? Nicky and Alix were close to the montenegro siblings and could '' put together '' a marriage between them.

In fact, Alicky backing the match is likely to let her mother-in-law shy away from it. As to Mecklenburg boys, as @mcdnab pointed out, keeping \"baby\" at home was probably high on Minnie's list. So, IOTW, a candidate who can be domesticated (i.e. Wied) or is already domesticated (Georg Alexander of Mecklenburg, is an example. His mom (Ekaterina Mikhailovna) wanted him to marry a royal bride rather than his OTL wife, so Olga would check that box - in an idea of mine where Nicky's brother, Georg marries morganatically to a Georgian princess (it was reported around the turn of the century, so I picked it up and ran with it), his daughters are Princesses Zakharin and end up married to Mecklenburg's son and to Georg Obrenovic of Serbia (Milan's illegitimate son)). Alexander of Leuchtenberg would be just as decent a candidate - the Beauharnais were pretty rich too, weren't they?\n\nMontenegro doesn't need any more influence at the Russian court.
