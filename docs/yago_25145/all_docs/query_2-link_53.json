        "text": "In the year of 1066, several rival claimants to the English throne emerged. Among them were Harold Godwinson (recognised as king by the Witenagemot after the death of Edward the Confessor), Harald Hardrada (King of Norway who claimed to be the rightful heir of Harthacnut) & Duke William II of Normandy (first cousin once-removed of Edward the Confessor). Harald & William both invaded separately in 1066. Godwinson successfully repelled the invasion by Hardrada, but ultimately lost the throne of England in the Norman conquest of England.\n\nAfter the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066, William the Conqueror made permanent the recent removal of the capital from Winchester to London. Following the death of Harold Godwinson at Hastings, the Anglo-Saxon Witenagemot elected as king Edgar Ætheling, the son of Edward the Exile & grandson of Edmund Ironside. The young monarch was unable to resist the invaders & was never crowned. William was crowned King William I of England on Christmas Day 1066, in Westminster Abbey, & is today known as William the Conqueror.\n\nWilliam the Conqueror\n\nReign: King of England - 25 December 1066 – 9 September 1087\n\nCoronation: 25 December 1066, Westminster Abbey.\n\nBorn: about 1028, Falaise, Duchy of Normandy.\n\nParents: Robert the Magnificent (1000 – 1035), Duke of Normandy & Herleva of Falaise. Robert the Magnificent (22 June 1000 – 1–3 July 1035) was the duke of Normandy from 1027 until his death in 1035. Herleva's background & the circumstances of William's birth are shrouded in mystery. The written evidence dates from a generation or two later, & is not entirely consistent\n\nHouse of: Normandy.\n\nMarried: Matilda of Flanders in 1051/52. Matilda of Flanders (c. 1031 – 2 November 1083). Matilda was born into the House of Flanders, the second daughter of Count Baldwin V of Flanders & Adela of France.\n\nThey had at least nine children. The birth order of the sons is clear, but no source gives the relative order of birth of the daughters.\n\nRobert Curthouse (b. between 1051 & 1054, d. 1134. Duke of Normandy, married Sybilla, daughter of Geoffrey, Count of Conversano.\n\nRichard (b.1056, d. abt 1075).\n\nWilliam (1056 & 1060, d. 2 August 1100). King of England.\n\nHenry (1068, d. 1 December 1135). King of England, married Edith, daughter of Malcolm III of Scotland. His 2nd wife was Adeliza of Louvain.\n\nAdeliza (or Adelida, Adelaide) (d. bef. 1113), reportedly betrothed to Harold Godwinson, probably a nun of Saint Léger at Préaux.\n\nCecilia (or Cecily) (1066-1127), Abbess of Holy Trinity, Caen.\n\nMatilda (1061 - c.1086).\n\nConstance (d.1090), married Alan IV, Duke of Brittany.\n\nAdela (d.1137), married Stephen, Count of Blois.\n\n(Possibly) Agatha, the betrothed of Alfonso VI of León & Castile\n\nWilliam I died: 9 September 1087, Priory of Saint Gervase, Rouen, Duchy of Normandy.\n\nBurial: Saint-Étienne de Caen, Normandy.\n\nSuccessor: William II (son)\n\nWilliam II\n\nReign: King of England 26 September 1087 – 2 August 1100.\n\nWilliam is commonly referred to as William Rufus (Rufus being Latin for \"the Red\"), perhaps because of his ruddy appearance or, more likely, due to having red hair as a child that grew out in later life.\n\nCoronation: 26 September 1087, Westminster Abbey.\n\nBorn: c. 1056, Normandy, France.\n\nParents: William the Conqueror & Matilda of Flanders.\n\nHouse of: Normandy.\n\nNever married, no children.\n\nDied: 2 August 1100, New Forest, Hampshire. He died after being hit by an arrow while hunting, under circumstances that remain unclear. Circumstantial evidence in the behaviour of those around him raises strong, but unproven, suspicions of murder. The king's body was abandoned by the nobles at the place where he fell. A peasant later found it. William's younger brother, Henry, rushed off to Winchester to secure the royal treasury, then to London, where he was crowned within days.\n\nBurial: Winchester Cathedral.\n\nSuccessor: Henry I (brother).\n\nHenry I\n\nReign: King of England - 5 August 1100 – 1 December 1135.\n\nCoronation: 5 August 1100, Westminster Abbey.\n\nBorn: c. 1068, Possibly Selby, Yorkshire.\n\nParents: William the Conqueror & Matilda of Flanders.\n\nHouse of: Normandy.\n\nMarriages & children.\n\n(1.)
