        "text": "This paper explores the dissemination of seal usage among the Flemish noble elite throughout the twelfth century. Aristocratic seal culture in the county of Flanders was impacted by opposing external influences: Flanders enjoyed strong relations with both the Anglo-Norman realm, whose cross-Channel baronage became increasingly familiar with seals from 1100 onwards, and the German Empire, where seal usage remained strictly reserved for to the upper nobility well throughout the twelfth century. The study shows that most leading Flemish aristocrats already owned a seal matrix by 1140–1160, while lesser lords and knights gradually accessed seal ownership between 1180 and 1220/30. Flanders therefore appears to have been heavily influenced by Anglo-Norman attitudes towards seals, although the spreading process was delayed by half a century compared to England and Normandy. This was a regular process of downward social diffusion, that happened along the lines of internal stratification in Flemish aristocratic society. Emulation among peers played a key role, as did the imitation of more elevated members of the ruling elite. This was initiated by the counts of Flanders whose iconographical archetypes tellingly set the tone. By contrast, in some peripheral parts of the county, especially in “Imperial Flanders”, dominant noble families may have used seals to politically challenge comital overlordship.\n\nA signature is a personal sign left by the emis- sary of a document. In the Middle Ages a royal signature was a powerful representation of the monarch. The Queens of Portugal are no ex- ception to both ideas. Through the centuries, the typical queenly signature became part of the queenship apparatus. However, these royal women had the choice to manipulate the signa- ture to some extent to represent themselves and their circumstances. This paper reflects on the meanings of the establishment of a queenly signature and the insights the shifts upon that signature can give us.\n\nBeatrice of Tuscany (c.1020-1076) and her daughter, Matilda of Tuscany (1046-1115), were two of the first noblewomen to seal charters in medieval Europe. Their seals are modelled upon imperial seals (respectively, those of German and Roman emperors). Yet the imperial aspects of Beatrice’s and Matilda’s seals have been side-lined and feminised by previous scholars, who have seen them as personal seals, expressing typically ‘feminine’ priorities. Beatrice’s seal is anachronistically compared with the seals of twelfth-century German empresses. This parallel ignores the contemporary seals of the eleventh-century German emperors, which Beatrice’s seal more closely resembles. Similarly, even where the classical associations of Matilda’s seal have been noted, it is the depiction of marital harmony rather than the imperial connotations which are emphasised. Yet Beatrice and Matilda were princely women, who successively ruled the mark of Tuscany; their seals were part of the insignia of rule. It was exceptional for eleventh-century noblewomen to seal charters. Beatrice’s and Matilda’s decision to do so was not only innovative, but an assertion of their personal and political authority. Their seal iconography was not intended to identify them as beloved wives, nor as pious widows, but to make claims about their lineage and their political legitimacy.\n\nIn this thesis I argue that the varied visual and textual source material related to Duchess Matilda (*1156-✝1189) provides an insight into her duties and responsibilities at her husband&#39;s court. In order to address this question I have taken the visual evidence as my starting point. These sources are studied in combination with a variety of written sources. Together they are examined within the context of medieval ideas about women and their participation in this society. This will provide a better understanding of Matilda&#39;s actions. Additionally, the renewed study of the art works will also nuance some former interpretations concerning their dating and meaning. Within this study there are four important themes: 1. women in textual and visual sources; 2. authority and power; 3. women as makers of art; and 4. performativity. This study, the first dedicated completely to Matilda, demonstrates she held a variety of duties and responsibilities. Most of these can be considered t...\n\nThe material culture related to Duchess Matilda of Saxony, Queen Leonor of Castile and Countess Joanna of Toulouse (and former Queen of Sicily) offers a rich resource that allows us to understand how, when and why they connected themselves to their father, Henry II of England. The objects studied in this article prompt significant questions regarding the relation between material culture and royal women, which allow us to explore the formative phases in women’s lives as well as their roles in the promotion and construction of a dynastic consciousness. Even though the sisters probably acted separately, they did so with a shared awareness of their positions as royal daughters and the need to communicate this collectively. By centring on the three sisters’ objects, this article proposes that the study of material culture is crucial for a better understanding of the co-operation between siblings and can contribute to a more nuanced interpretation of power.

After all, his first wife Isabelle had come with Vermandois, and he was expected to easily find another French heiress somewhere for his second marriage. An explanation is given by Eljas Oksanen in his recent book Flanders and the Anglo-Norman World 1066-1216 3. He suggests that the marriage was arranged by King Henry II of England: In 1183 Henry arranged a marriage between Count Philip and Matilda, the daughter of King Alfonso I of Portugal. Conveyed by Henry's own royal ship, the bride travelled to Flanders via England, and the king hosted a royal reception for the pair, spending some 300 pounds on the occasion."
