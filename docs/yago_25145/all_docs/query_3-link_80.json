        "text": "In nineteenth-century Britain, a woman's place was regarded to be in the domestic area, devoted to housework and family life. However, thanks to certain political, economic and social changes, women progressively began to engage in pursuits that were previously exclusive to the men. Writing a novel was one of these pursuits for some women in the Victorian era. Although under the pseudonym of a man, women writers like Mary Ann Evans published significant works during this era. In many of their works, these women writers challenged the role that women were supposed to take in Victorian society. Using various literary strategies, they opposed to conventional representations of the woman in Victorian novel. In this context, the present study examines two canonical works by George Eliot and Elizabeth Gaskell to illustrate how these women writers portray marriage and spinsterhood as symbolic feminist concepts. The findings of the study suggest that by illustrating devastating results of undesired marriages and offering a utopian world of happiness for spinsters, Eliot and Gaskell, respectively, take up feminist stances against oppressing power of patriarchal society in England in the Victorian era.\n\nThe relationship between mistress and maid is curiously intimate yet bounded by class. Employers and their servants are caught in a dynamic of dominance and submission, in which they practice mutual surveillance. Yet the relationship may also evoke models of loyalty, devotion, and the possibility, in fiction at least, of female alliance. On the comparatively rare occasions that servants feature at all in Victorian fiction, these dynamics lend a homoerotic dimension to the cross-class relationship between mistress and maid. The positions of mistress and maid bring two women together under the same roof while separating them by class, thus providing a framework for a fictional exploration for yearning, desire, unrequited love, or sometimes union. Alternatively, a queer relationship may be obscured by the guise of employer and servant. Indeed, the mistress-maid stories discussed here often involve masquerade in some form, including cross-class and cross-gender disguises."
