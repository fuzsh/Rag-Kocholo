        "text": "Charles de Valois of France (December 26, 1446 – May 24/25, 1472), Duke of Berry, later Duke of Normandy and Duke of Aquitaine.\n\nEarly life\n\nCharles de Valois of France was born at Tours, last child and fourth son of King Charles VII of France and Marie of Anjou. Marie was the eldest daughter of Duke Louis II of Anjou, claimant to the throne of Naples, and Infanta Yolande of Aragon, claimant to the throne of Aragon. Infanta Yolande of Aragon was the eldest daughter of King Juan I of Aragon by his second wife, Yolande of Bar, the granddaughter of King Jean II of France.\n\nAs his elder brother, the Dauphin Louis, had repeatedly run into conflict with his father and since 1456 was living in exile at the court of Burgundy, some expected the crown to pass to Charles. When King Charles VII died in 1461, however, his elder brother, the Dauphin, succeeded as King Louis XI of France nonetheless.\n\nAfter his accession, King Louis XI granted his younger brother the Duchy of Berry as an appanage. Dissatisfied with this, Charles joined with Charles the Bold, Count of Charolais, and other powerful nobles such as François II, Duke of Brittany in the League of the Public Weal in May 1465 and they placed him at the head of their league. This started a rebellion which ended in October with the Treaty of Conflans between King Louis XI and Charles the Bold, the Count of Charolais.\n\nDuke of Normandy\n\nUnder the treaty, Charles was granted the Duchy of Normandy as an additional appanage. He proved unable to control his new possession and ran into conflict with his former ally Duke François II of Brittany. King Louis XI dispatched the royal army to Normandy and assumed direct royal control of the Duchy. Charles, now reconciled with Duke François II, fled to Brittany, where he remained until September 1468, when he and Duke François II signed the Treaty of Ancenis with King Louis XI, promising to abandon the former Count of Charolais, now Duke Charles I the Bold of Burgundy.\n\nDukes of Aquitaine\n\nIn October 1468 King Louis XI was imprisoned by Charles the Bold of Burgundy during a conference at Péronne. In order to obtain his release, King Louis XI agreed to grant Champagne to his brother as compensation for Normandy. Once free, King Louis XI reneged on the promises made under duress but in April 1469, he finally reconciled with his brother, granting him the Duchy of Aquitaine, recently won back from the Kings of England in 1453. Thenceforth Charles quartered the royal arms of France (differenced by a bordure engrailed gules) with one of the three lions of Plantagenet, to signify the duchy.\n\nCharles also agreed with the Duke Charles the Bold of Burgundy to marry the latter’s only child and heir, Mary of Burgundy, whose mother was Isabella of Bourbon a daughter of Duke Charles I of Bourbon and Agnes of Burgundy.\n\nKing Louis XI had no intention of allowing a union between his brother and his enemy’s daughter and dispatched envoys to Pope Paul II to ensure that the necessary dispensation, required on grounds of consanguinity, was not granted. King Louis XI was unsuccessful in this endeavour, as the Pope granted the dispensation.\n\nStill, the marriage plan came to nothing as Charles died at Bordeaux in May 1472, probably from a combination of tuberculosis and a venereal disease contracted from his mistress Colette de Chambes, the wife of Louis d’Amboise, Viscount of Thouars.\n\nCharles died May 24/25, 1472 and left no legitimate issue. His apanage of Duke of Berry merged with the crown.\n\nIssue\n\nWith his mistress Colette de Chambes he had:\n\n1. Jeanne de Guyenne (b. 1470), a dominican nun\n\n2. Anne (b. 1471), married in 1490 to François de Volvire, Baron de Ruffec. Without issue.\n\nExactly when did Duke William II “The Conqueror” of Normandy become King of the English? Although he certainly became the De Facto King of the English when he defeated King Harold II Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings in October of 1066, it was not until his coronation on Christmas Day of that year did he accede to the throne.\n\nWilliam may have hoped the English would surrender to his rule immediately after his victory over Harold II Godwinson, but that just was not the case. A swiftly convened meeting of the Wittan, comprising the English clergy and magnates, elected Edgar the Ætheling, King of the English. Edgar the Ætheling was of the House of Wessex and a nephew of King Edward the Confessor. Edgar was elected King of the English despite the support for Edgar by the Wittan being very lukewarm.\n\nUndeterred, William continued his conquest of England. He and his armies secured Dover, parts of Kent, and Canterbury, and also captured Winchester, where the royal treasury was located. These captures solidified his holdings in that region and also his line of retreat to Normandy, if that was needed. It was unnecessary.\n\nWilliam then marched northward to Southwark and into London in late November. Next he led his forces around the south and west of London, burning buildings of those in resistance along the way. He crossed the Thames at Wallingford in early December where Archbishop Stigand, and Edgar the Ætheling submitted to William.\n\nHe moved on to Berkhamsted soon afterwards where Edgar the Ætheling, Morcar, Edwin, and Archbishop Ealdred also submitted. This solidified his power in London where William began the construction of the Tower of London.\n\nWith his troops garrisoned in London William was crowned King of the English at Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.\n\nAldred, Archbishop of York performed the Coronation ceremony in place of Stigand, Archbishop of Canterbury. He presented the new king to the people, speaking in English with Bishop Geoffrey of Coutances speaking the words in French.\n\nWhen the French-speaking Normans and English-speaking Saxons then shouted their approval the Norman soldiers outside thought the noise inside was an assassination attempt and began setting fire to houses around the Abbey.\n\nSmoke filled the church and the congregation fled and riots broke out. Inside William and the officiating clergy completed the service despite the chaos.\n\nArchduchess Mariana or Maria Anna of Austria (December 24, 1634 – May 16, 1696)\n\nEarly life\n\nArchduchess Maria Anna of Austria was born on December 24, 1634 in Wiener Neustadt, second child of Infanta Maria Anna of Spain and her husband Archduke Ferdinand of Austria (1608–1657), who became Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III in 1637.\n\nHer mother, Infanta Maria Anna of Spain, was the daughter of King Felipe III of Spain and of Archduchess Margaret of Austria, the daughter of Archduke Charles II of Inner and Maria Anna of Bavaria. Prior to her Imperial marriage Infanta Maria Anna of Spain was considered a possible wife for Charles, Prince of Wales, the future King Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland. The event, later known in history as the “Spanish match”, provoked a domestic and political crisis in the kingdoms of England and Scotland.\n\nArchduchess Maria Anna of Austria’s, parents had six children, of whom only Archduchess Maria Anna and two brothers survived to adulthood; King Ferdinand IV of the Romans, Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia (1633–1654), and Leopold (1640–1705), elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1658.\n\nQueen of Spain\n\nDuring this period, both the Spanish Empire and Holy Roman Empire were ruled by different branches of the Habsburgs, who often married each other to ensure their lands remained within the family. In 1646, Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria was betrothed to her cousin and heir to the Spanish throne, Infante Balthasar Carlos, Prince of Asturias. His death three months later left her without a prospective husband and her widowed uncle King Felipe IV of Spain without an heir.\n\nOn October 7, 1649, the 44-year-old King Felipe IV of Spain married his 14-year-old niece Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria in Navalcarnero, outside Madrid; from then on, she was known by her Spanish name Mariana.\n\nOnly two of their five children survived to adulthood; the eldest, Infanta Margaret Theresa (1651–1673), married her maternal uncle Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor in 1666. Mariana’s second daughter, Infanta Maria Ambrosia, lived only fifteen days, followed by two sons, Felipe Prospero (1657–1661) and Fernando Thomas (1658–1659).\n\nOn November 6, 1661, Mariana gave birth to her last child, Infante Carlos later known as El Hechizado or “The Bewitched”. Although he had a number of alleged physical and mental issues, foreign observers speculated these were exaggerated by his mother in order to retain political control.\n\nUpon the death of King Felipe IV, Queen Mariana was appointed regent for their three-year-old son King Carlos II, and due to his ill health remained an influential figure until she died in 1696.\n\nStephen of Blois (1092 or 1096 – October 25, 1154) was King of England from December 22, 1135 to his death in 1154. He was Count of Boulogne jure uxoris from 1125 until 1147 and Duke of Normandy from 1135 until 1144.\n\nStephen’s father was Stephen II Henri, Count of Blois and Chartres, an important French nobleman and an active crusader who died when Stephen was at most ten years old.\n\nStephen’s mother, Adela of England and Normandy, was the daughter of King William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders. She was famous among her contemporaries for her piety and strong personality. Indeed, Adela was a major reason for Stephen II Henri’s return to the Levant. She had a strong formative influence on Stephen during his growing years; she would live to see her son take her father’s throne of England, but would die within a year after that.\n\nHis father died while Stephen was still young, and he was brought up by his mother. Placed into the court of his uncle King Henry I of England, Stephen rose in prominence and was granted extensive lands.\n\nKing Henry I of England had only one other legitimate child, the future Empress Matilda, but as a woman she was at a substantial political disadvantage. Shortly after the death of his son, the King took a second wife, Adeliza of Louvain, but it became increasingly clear that he would not have another legitimate son, and he instead looked to Empress Matilda as his intended heir.\n\nEmpress Matilda’s claim to the title of Holy Roman Empress was through her marriage to Emperor Heinrich V, but her husband died in 1125, and she was remarried in 1128 to Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, whose lands bordered the Duchy of Normandy.\n\nGeoffrey was unpopular with the Anglo-Norman elite: as an Angevin ruler, he was a traditional enemy of the Normans. At the same time, tensions continued to grow as a result of Henry’s domestic policies, in particular the high level of revenue he was raising to pay for his various wars. Conflict was curtailed, however, by the power of the King’s personality and reputation.\n\nMeanwhile, the King arranged for Stephen to marry Matilda of Boulogne, inheriting additional estates in Kent and Boulogne that made the couple one of the wealthiest in England. Stephen became Count of Boulogne by jure uxoris, by right of his wife.\n\nMatilda of Boulogne was the daughter of Count Eustace III of Boulogne. Her mother, Mary of Scotland, was the daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland and Margaret of Wessex, (also known as Saint Margaret of Scotland) the daughter of the English Prince Edward the Exile of Wessex and his wife Agatha. Matilda of Boulogne was also the granddaughter of Edmund Ironside, King of England.\n\nAgatha, wife of Edward the Exile, is from unknown parentage. Her antecedents are unclear and the subject of much speculation and one of the unresolved questions of medieval genealogy.\n\nStephen narrowly escaped drowning with Henry I’s son, William Adelin (Ætheling), in the sinking of the White Ship in 1120; William’s death left the succession of the English throne open to challenge.\n\nWhen news began to spread of Henry I’s death on December 1, 1135 many of the potential claimants to the throne were not well placed to respond. Geoffrey and Matilda were in Anjou, rather awkwardly supporting the rebels in their campaign against the royal army, which included a number of Matilda’s supporters such as Robert of Gloucester.\n\nMany of these barons had taken an oath to stay in Normandy until the late King was properly buried, which prevented them from returning to England. Stephen’s brother Theobald was further south still, in Blois.\n\nStephen, however, was in Boulogne, and when news reached him of Henry’s death he left for England, accompanied by his military household. Robert of Gloucester had garrisoned the ports of Dover and Canterbury and some accounts suggest that they refused Stephen access when he first arrived. Nonetheless, Stephen probably reached his own estate on the edge of London by December 8th and over the next week he began to seize power in England.\n\nThe crowds in London traditionally claimed a right to elect the King, and they proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new rights and privileges in return.\n\nHenry of Blois delivered the support of the church to Stephen: Stephen was able to advance to Winchester, where Roger, Bishop of Salisbury and Lord Chancellor, instructed the royal treasury to be handed over to Stephen.\n\nOn December 15, Henry of Blois delivered an agreement under which Stephen would grant extensive freedoms and liberties to the church, in exchange for the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Papal Legate supporting his succession to the throne. There was the slight problem of the religious oath that Stephen had taken to support the Empress Matilda, but Henry convincingly argued that the late king had been wrong to insist that his court take the oath.\n\nFurthermore, the late king had only insisted on that oath to protect the stability of the kingdom, and in light of the chaos that might now ensue, Stephen would be justified in ignoring it. Henry was also able to persuade Hugh Bigod, the late king’s royal steward, to swear that the King had changed his mind about the succession on his deathbed, nominating Stephen instead.\n\nThree weeks after the death of King Henry I of England, Stephen’s coronation was held at Westminster Abbey on December 22,1135.\n\nWith Stephen crowned King of England this led to the time period known as the Anarchy.\n\nThe Anarchy was a civil war in England and Normandy between 1135 and 1153, which resulted in a widespread breakdown in law and order. The conflict was a war of succession between King Stephen and Empress Matilda who both legally claimed the English throne.\n\nBianca Lancia d’Agliano (also called Beatrice, c. 1210 – c. 1248), was an Italian noblewoman. She was the mistress and later, possibly the last wife of the Hohenstaufen Emperor Friedrich II. The marriage was conducted while she was on her deathbed, therefore it was considered non-canonical.\n\nLife\n\nBianca lived most of her life at the Castello di Brolo, the ancestral seat of the Lancia family. It is not known when her relationship with Emperor Friedrich II began and how long it lasted. It is widely believed that her meeting with the Emperor took place in 1225, when he married Queen Isabella II of Jerusalem.\n\nAccording to Renato Bordone, it is unlikely that the Emperor met her in Agliano in 1225; in fact their meeting would have taken place between 1226 and 1230 in Sicily. In any case, the children of Bianca and Friedrich II were born in the period after the death of Queen Isabella II of Jerusalem in 1228, and before the Emperor’s third marriage to Isabella of England, which took place in 1235.\n\nIssue and possible marriage\n\nBoth the chronicles of Salimbene di Adam and Matthew Paris wrote that a “marriage ceremony at the moment of death” (Latin: confirmatio matrimonii in articulo mortis) took place between Bianca Lancia and Emperor Friedich II when she was dying.\n\nAs Matthew Paris writes, Bianca wanted to marry for the salvation of her soul and the safety of her children’s future, who were subsequently legitimated (Latin: legitimatio per matrimonium subsequens). With this, the Emperor probably also wanted to increase the number of his legitimate descendants and possible successors. The Church did not recognize this marriage as canonical. Matthew Paris also writes that the circumstances of the marriage were kept secret: there are neither witnesses nor any records.\n\nThere is only circumstantial evidence that this marriage took place. In 1250, in Friedrich II’s will, Manfred was recognized and mentioned as a legitimate son. At the same time, on April 21, 1247, when he married, was under the name of “Manfred Lancia”. This means that Manfred was legitimized between 1247 and 1250.\n\nBianca and Frederick II had three children together:\n\n1. Constance (1230 – April 1307), who married the Emperor of Nicea, John Vatatzes in 1244, and thereupon her name changed to Anna.\n\n2. Manfred (1232 – 26 February 1266), who succeeded his father as ruler of Sicily (initially as regent, before usurping the throne for himself).\n\n3. Violante (1233 – 1264), who married Richard Sanseverino, Count of Caserta in 1246 and had a son, Corrad. She died during an other childbirth.\n\nThe Chronica regia Coloniensis and Salimbene di Adam mention her, although they do not mention her name.\n\nDeath\n\nContemporary sources, such as the Annales ianuenses, dated Bianca’s death between 1234 and 1246. For example, Matthew Paris reported that Bianca died 20 years after the first meeting with Emperor Friedich II. This gives approximately 1246. Elsewhere, the chronicler wrote that this was 20 years before 1256, indicating around 1236.\n\nHowever, since marriage to the Emperor was a necessary condition for legitimizing his children, it must be admitted that she died no earlier than 1247. At the same time, Bianca probably died before Emperor Friedrich II, since the castle of Monte Sant’Angelo, located in the cities of Vieste and Siponto (which, according to King William II of Sicily’s will, was the traditional possession of the Queens of Sicily as a “gift morning” after the wedding night and would remain in their possession as a dower), was granted by the Emperor to his son Manfred.\n\nAs Marie-Thérèse matured, the march toward the French Revolution was gaining momentum. Social discontent mixed with a crippling budget deficit provoked an outburst of anti-absolutist sentiment. By 1789, France was hurtling toward revolution as the result of bankruptcy brought on by the country’s support of the American Revolution and high food prices due to drought, all of which was exacerbated by propagandists whose central object of scorn and ridicule was the Queen of France, Marie Antoinette.\n\nMove to the Tuileries\n\nWhen the Bastille was stormed by an armed mob on July 14, 1789, the situation reached a climax. The life of the 10-year-old Madame Royale began to be affected as several members of the royal household were sent abroad for their own safety. The Prince Charles Philippe, Count of Artois, her uncle, and the Duchess of Polignac, governess to the royal children, emigrated on the orders of Louis XVI.\n\nThe Duchess of Polignac was replaced by Louise-Elisabeth de Croÿ, Marquise de Tourzel, whose daughter Pauline became a lifelong friend of Marie-Thérèse.\n\nOn October 5, a mixed cortège of mainly working women from Paris marched to Versailles, intent on acquiring food believed to be stored there, and to advance political demands. After the invasion of the palace in the early hours of October 6 had forced the family to take refuge in the king’s apartment, the crowd demanded and obtained the move of the King and his family to the Tuileries Palace in Paris.\n\nAs the political situation deteriorated, King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette realized that their lives were in danger, and went along with the plan of escape organised with the help of Count Axel von Fersen. The plan was for the royal family to flee to the northeastern fortress of Montmédy, a royalist stronghold, but the attempted flight was intercepted in Varennes, and the family was escorted back to Paris.\n\nTemple\n\nOn August 10, 1792, after the royal family had taken refuge in the Legislative Assembly, King Louis XVI was deposed, although the monarchy was not abolished before September 21. On August 13, the entire family was imprisoned in the Temple Tower, remains of a former medieval fortress. On January 21, 1793, King Louis XVI was executed on the guillotine, at which time Marie-Thérèse’s young brother Prince Louis Charles de Bourbon was recognized as King Louis XVII of France by the royalists.\n\nIn March 1793 General Charles François Dumouriez came up with the idea to restore the monarchy and free Marie-Antoinette and her children. His ally, the 20-years-old Duke of Chartres should marry Marie-Thérèse. When they failed in getting support from the troops, the men went toward the Austrian camp and lived in exile.\n\nThree months later, in the evening of July 13, 1793, guards entered the royal family’s apartment, forcibly took away the eight-year-old Prince Louis Charles (King Louis XVII), and entrusted him to the care of Antoine Simon, a cobbler and Temple commissioner.\n\nRemaining in their apartment in the Tower were Queen Marie Antoinette, Marie-Thérèse and Madame Élisabeth, King Louis XVI’s youngest sister. When Queen Marie Antoinette was taken to the Conciergerie one month later, in the night of August 2, Marie-Thérèse was left in the care of her aunt Élisabeth who, in turn, was taken away on May 9, 1794 and executed the following day. Of the royal prisoners in the Temple, Marie-Thérèse was the only one to survive the Reign of Terror.\n\nHer stay in the Temple Tower was one of solitude and often great boredom. The two books she had, the famous prayer book by the name of The Imitation of Christ and Voyages by Jean-François de La Harpe, were read over and over, so much so that she grew tired of them. But her appeal for more books was denied by government officials, and many other requests were frequently refused, while she often had to endure listening to her brother’s cries and screams whenever he was beaten. On 11 May, Robespierre visited Marie-Thérèse, but there is no record of the conversation. During her imprisonment, Marie-Thérèse was never told what had happened to her family.\n\nIsabella II (1212 – May 4, 1228), also known as Yolande of Brienne, was a Princesses of French origin, the daughter of Maria, the Queen-Regnant of Jerusalem, and her husband, John of Brienne. She was reigning Queen of Jerusalem from 1212 until her death in 1228. By marriage to Friedrich II, Holy Roman Emperor, Isabella also became Holy Roman Empress and Queen of Sicily and Germany.\n\nQueen Isabella II was born in Andria, in the southern Italian Kingdom of Sicily. She was the only child of Maria of Montferrat, Queen of Jerusalem, and Jean of Brienne, the youngest of the four sons of Count Erard II of Brienne and Agnes of Montfaucon.\n\nMaria of Montferrat was the daughter of Queen Isabella I of Jerusalem by her second husband Conrad I of Montferrat and heiress, on her mother’s death, of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nConrad I of Montferrat was the second son of Marquess Guillaume V of Montferrat, “the Elder”, and his wife Judith of Babenberg. Conrad was a first cousin of Friedrich I Barbarossa, Holy Roman Emperor, as well as King Louis VII of the Franks and Duke Leopold V of Austria. Friedrich I Barbarossa was the grandfather of Emperor Friedrich II.\n\nMaria died shortly after giving birth to Isabella II in 1212, possibly by puerperal fever. Because of this, Isabella II was proclaimed Queen of Jerusalem when she was only a few days old. Because her father Jean did not have a direct claim on the throne, he ruled as Regent.\n\nMarriage with Friedrich II\n\nDuring a meeting between Johann of Brienne, Pope Honorius III and Emperor Friedrich II in the city of Ferentino in 1223, Isabella’s fate was decided: Friedrich accepted to finally go to the Crusade, but only as the legitimate King of Jerusalem, and this was only possible if he agreed to take the young Queen Isabella II as his wife (at this time, Friedrich was a widower).\n\nThis was planned by the Pope, who hoped by this bond to attach the Emperor firmly to the Sixth Crusade. The betrothal was confirmed, but the Emperor still delayed his departure until August 1225, when he and Isabella were married by proxy in the City of Acre. Days later, Isabella II was crowned as Queen of Jerusalem.\n\nQueen Isabella II of Jerusalem arrived in Italy with twenty galleys sent by Emperor Friedrich II to bring her to her father and married in person to Friedrich II in the cathedral of Brindisi, on November 9, 1225.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Emperor Friedrich II declared himself King of Jerusalem and immediately saw to it that his new father-in-law Jean of Brienne, the current Regent of Jerusalem, was dispossessed and his rights transferred to him. The contemporary chronicles described the exotic wedding celebrations, which took place in the Castle of Oria, and the indignant reaction of her father Jean of Brienne, now without royal authority.\n\nDeath\n\nAfter the wedding, Queen Isabella II was kept in seclusion by her husband, in Palermo. She was aged 14, and Emperor Friedrich II was 31. In November 1226, she gave birth to her first child, a daughter (referred to by some sources as Margaret); the baby died in August 1227. On April 25, 1228 Isabella gave birth to her second child, a son, Conrad, in Andria, Bari, but a few days later, on May 4th she died following childbirth complications. She was buried in the Andria Cathedral.\n\nConstance of Aragon (1179 – 23 June 1222) was an Aragonese infanta who was by marriage firstly Queen of Hungary, and secondly Queen of Germany-the Romans and Sicily and Holy Roman Empress. She was regent of Sicily from 1212 to 1220.\n\nShe was the second child and eldest daughter of the nine children of King Alfonso II of Aragon and Infanta Sancha of Castile, who was was the only surviving child of King Alfonso VII of Castile by his second wife, Richeza of Poland.\n\nQueen of Hungary\n\nKing Alfonso II of Aragon died in 1196 and Infanta Constance’s fate was decided by the new King, her brother King Pedro II of Aragon, who arranged her marriage with King Emeric of Hungary. The wedding took place in 1198. Two years later, in 1200, the Queen gave birth to a son, called Ladislaus.\n\nWhen King Emeric was dying, he crowned his son Ladislaus co-ruler on August 26, 1204. The King wanted to secure his succession and had his brother Andrew promise to protect the child and help him govern the Kingdom of Hungary until reaching adulthood. King Emeric died three months later, on November 30, 1204.\n\nLadislaus succeeded his father as King Ladislaus III of Hungary while Prince Andrew became his Regent. Prince Andrew soon took over all regal authority while King Ladislaus III and Queen Constance were little more than his prisoners. Queen Constance managed to escape to Vienna with Ladislaus.\n\nThe two found refuge in the court of Leopold VI, Duke of Austria, but King Ladislaus III would soon die (May 7, 1205). The former Regent and now King Andrew II of Hungary took the body of his nephew and buried him in the Royal Crypt of Székesfehérvár. Duke Leopold VI of Austria sent Queen Constance back to Aragon.\n\nQueen of Sicily and Holy Roman Empress\n\nWhen Queen Constance returned to Aragon, she took up residence with her mother, Queen Sancha, in the Abbey of Nuestra Senora, at Sijena; Queen Sancha had founded the abbey after her husband’s death, and now lived there in retirement. Queen Constance spent the next three years in the abbey with her mother, until her fate, again, was changed by her brother.\n\nKing Pedro II of Aragon wanted to be on good terms with Pope Innocent III, since he wanted an annulment of his marriage with Maria of Montpellier, and needed the blessing of the Pope. Pope Innocent III solicited the hand of the Dowager Queen Constance of Hungary for his pupil, the young Friedrich II, King of the Romans and Sicily.\n\nThe Aragonese King accepted the proposal; Constance left her mother and the abbey of Nuestra Senora and began her trip to Sicily (1208). She never returned to Aragon or saw her mother again. Queen Sancha died shortly after the departure of her daughter.\n\nConstance and Friedich were married in the Sicilian city of Messina on August 15, 1209. In the ceremony, she was crowned Queen of Sicily. By this time, Constance was thirty years old and her new husband only fourteen. Two years later, in 1211, Constance gave birth to a son, called Heinrich, who later had a tragic end.\n\nOn December 9, 1212, Friedrich was crowned King of Germany in opposition to Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor. During the absence of her husband, Constance stayed in Sicily as Regent of the Kingdom until 1220.\n\nAt first Friedich controlled Southern Germany and Otto IV was effectively deposed on 5 July 1215. This time Constance was crowned German Queen with her husband.\n\nPope Honorius III crowned Friedrich as Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich II on November 22, 1220. Queen Constance was crowned Holy Roman Empress while their son Heinrich became the new King of Germany-Romans. She died of malaria less than two years later in Catania and was buried in the Cathedral of Palermo, in a Roman sarcophagus with a crown, the Crown of Constance.\n\nLeopold I (December 16, 1790 – December 10, 1865) was the first King of the Belgians, reigning from July 21, 1831 until his death in 1865.\n\nPrince Leopold was the youngest son of Franz, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and his wife Augusta of Reuss-Ebersdorf, the second child of Heinrich XXIV, Count Reuss of Ebersdorf and Countess Caroline Ernestine of Erbach-Schönberg.\n\nPrince Leopold took a commission in the Imperial Russian Army and fought against Napoleon after French troops overran Saxe-Coburg during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nAfter Napoleon’s defeat, Leopold moved to the United Kingdom, where in 1816 he married Princess Charlotte of Wales, the only child of the Prince Regent (the future King George IV of the United Kingdom and Hanover).\n\nLeopold and Charlotte’s marriage was happy, but it ended after a year and a half when Charlotte died after delivering a stillborn son. Leopold continued to enjoy considerable status in Britain.\n\nAfter the Greek War of Independence (1821–1830), Leopold was offered the throne of Greece under the 1830 London Protocol that created an independent Greek state, but turned it down, believing it to be too precarious.\n\nInstead, he accepted the throne of Belgium in 1831 following the country’s independence in 1830. The Belgian government offered the position to Leopold because of his diplomatic connections with royal houses across Europe, and because as the British-backed candidate, he was not affiliated with other powers, such as France, which were believed to have territorial ambitions in Belgium which might threaten the European balance of power created by the 1815 Congress of Vienna.\n\nLeopold took his oath as King of the Belgians on July 12, 1831, an event commemorated annually as Belgian National Day. The following year, he married Princess Louise d’Orléans of France the eldest daughter of the future King Louis-Philippe I of the French, and of his wife Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies.\n\nKing Leopold and Princess Louise with whom he had four children: Crown Prince Louis Philippe, King Leopold II, Philippe, and Charlotte (named after Leopold’s first wife). The King had another two sons, George and Arthur, by his mistress Arcadie Meyer.\n\nKing Leopold’s reign was marked by attempts by the Dutch to recapture Belgium and, later, by internal political division between liberals and Catholics. As a Protestant, Leopold was considered liberal and encouraged economic modernisation, playing an important role in encouraging the creation of Belgium’s first railway in 1835 and subsequent industrialisation.\n\nAs a result of the ambiguities in the Belgian Constitution, Leopold was able to slightly expand the monarch’s powers during his reign. He also played an important role in stopping the spread of the Revolutions of 1848 into Belgium. He died in 1865 and was succeeded by his son as King Leopold II of the Belgians."
