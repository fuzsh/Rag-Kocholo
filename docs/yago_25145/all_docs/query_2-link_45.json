        "text": "NOTE: WURTS' MAGNA CHARTA, pp. 158-168 inclusive, gives sixty nine Generations of lineal descent from No. 1, Edward the Great, (Aedd Mawr) to No. 69, Geoffrey Plantagenet. This also shows Geoffrey's descent from the FRANKISH KINGS, Nos.\n\n1, to and including 35; also his descent from No. (b) (HELI) Beli the Great through LUD, through TUANTIUS, through CYNVELIN (CYMBELINE), through AVIRAGUS, through MERIC (MARIUS), through EURGEN, through GLADYS, wife of No. 39, (LLEUVER MAWR) LUCIUS THE GREAT. And page 168 Wurt's Magna Charta shows that both Geoffrey Plantagenet and his wife, Matilda, or Maud, of England, were descendants of WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR, who as above stated, was descended from CHARLEMAGNE.\n\nDescent from CHARLEMAGNE to MATILDA, or Maud, of England, wife of GEOFFREY PLANTAGENET;\n\n(1) CHARLEMAGNE and wife, Hildegarde had a son; (2) PEPIN, born 776, died 8 July 810, before his father. He was crowned by the Pope in 781, King of Lombardy and Italy, married Bertha, daughter of William, Count of Toulouse, his son; (3) BERNHARD, King of Lombardy, succeeded his father about the year 812, he was deposed by his Uncle Louis, blinded and put to death. By his wife Cunegonde, he had a son; (4) PEPIN, who was deprived of the throne by his Uncle Louis, Emperor, called the Debonair, and received a part of Vermandois and the Seignouries of St. Quentin and Peronne. His son; (5) PEPIN, Pepin de Senlis de Valois, Count Berengarius, of Bretagne, who was living in 893, the father of (6) LADY POPPA, (puppet or doll), who became the first wife of ROLLO the DANE, first Duke of Normandy. Their son; (7) WILLIAM LONGSWORD, was father of (8) RICHARD the FEARLESS, father of; (9) RICHARD II, \"the Good\", whose son; (10) ROBERT \"THE DEVIL\", sixth Duke of Normandy, who, by Herleve de falaise, daughter of the Tanner, Fulbert de Falaise, had a son; (11) WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR, born at Falaise in 1027, father of HENRY I, KING of ENGLAND, WHO WAS THE LAST OF THE NORMANKINGS. (Magna Charta 178, 182, 183)\n\n(Gen. No. 127) KING HENRY II of ENGLAND, son of Matilda, or Maud, of England and her husband, Geoffrey Plantagenet, was born at Le Mans, 25 March 1133 and died at Chinon, 6 July 1189. In 1152 he married Eleanor of Aquitaine, former wife of Louis VII, of France, and daughter of William, Duke of Aquitaine. She survived King Henry nearly three years, dying 26 June 1202. Both were buried at Fontrevaud in Anjou. Their daughter Elennor married Alphonse IX, King of Castile; their eldest son William, died at the age of four years, their second son, Henry, born 28 Feb. 1155, who on 15 July 1170, by command of his father, was crowned King of England, but died before his father, 11 July 1183, their third son, Richard the Lion Hearted, reigned as King of England from 1189 to 1199. He was the most prominent leader on the Third Crusade to regain Jerusalem for the Christians from the Mohammedans. He had greater military genius, but less statesmanship than his father; was fickle, but warmhearted. His great power was in his physical and mental capacity as a soldier, and in his strenuous and irrepressible courage. Richard was proud, cruel and treacherous. He left the goverment of England in the hands of his Justiciars, and was in his English Kingdom but twice in his reign of ten years; four months at the time of his coronation, and two months, five years later. The Third Crusade was a failure. Richard fell out with the French King, and refused to marry his sister Alice, to whom he had been betrothed since early childhood, but on 12 May 1191, he married Perengaria of Navarre. HE DIED WITHOUT ISSUE. The fourth son of Henry II, Geoffrey, had a son Arthur, who was murdered in 1203, leaving as successor to the throne of England; (*See Note Below)\n\n(Gen. No. 128) KING JOHN, LACKLAND, the fifth son of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine, born at Oxford, 24 Dec. 1166, died at Newark Castle, Notts, 19 Oct. 1216, married, first on 29 August 1189, Isabel, daughter of William, Earl of Gloucester; married, second, in 1200, Isabel, daughter of Aymer de Taillefer, the Swordsmith. She was the mother of all his children. John S. Wurts, in his Magna Charta, pages 6 to 17, inclusive.\n\nPage 6; \"In case we have forgotten our English History, let us be reminded that King John was a horrid person, an arbitrary and mercenary ruler, who threw people into dungeons at the drop of a hat; married off wards of the crown, young widows and pretty girls, to foreign adventurers and then collected a nice percentage of the ward's fortunes from their husbands....... he greatly increased the royal taxes and replenished his exchequer with the confiscated property of the clergy.\n\nShortly after he became King, he quarreled with the Pope, who deposed him and proclaimed him no longer King. John ignored the deposing, and made a gift to the Pope of all the realm, crown and revenue, by written indenture, dated Monday, 13 May 1213. John then received the crown back as the Pope's tenant and vassal, at a rental of a thousand marks for the whole kingdom, 700 for England and 300 for Ireland.\n\nUnder this condition the Barons of England were only yeoman, or free-holders, or copy-holders of King John, the free- holder of the Pope, and tiring of John's tyranny, they called a conference, and one, after King John had left the Abbey at Saint-Edmundsbury (where he had been asked to attend the conference, which had been called by Stephen Langston, Archbishop of Canterbury), at which meeting nothing was accomplished, the barons took a solemn oath on the high altar, that they would stand united until they could compel the King to confirm their liberties, or they would wage war against him to the death.\n\nThey did wage war, \"a holy crusade against John to recover the liberties their forefathers had enjoyed\". Virtually powerless, and with nearly his whole Baronage and the majority of his subjects of all degrees in arms against him, he finally called his Barons to a conference. They said, \"let the day by the 15th of June and the place Runnemede\". (which is in sight of Windsor Castle, and was used as \"the field of council\").\n\nIn this way was brought about the GREATEST EVENT OF KING JOHN'S REIGN, the veritable wresting from him of MAGNA CHARTA, granting rights to the people of his realm, \"an expression in written words of the principles of human life\", which had been either grossly neglected or altogether forgotten by the King.\n\nSection 61 of the Chart authorized the election of twenty five Surety Barons, who would see that the previsions of the Charter were carried into effect. Their names are not recorded in the Magna Charta, \"but we learn them from Matthew Paris' \"Chronilca Majora\".\"\n\nThese Barons were astonishingly inter-related. Among them were several instances of father and son, of father-in-law and son-in-law, of brothers and cousins. Twenty of the twenty five were related in the degree of second cousin, or nearer. Of these twenty five, only seventeen have descendants surviving to the present day. They had a common descent from Charlemagne.\n\nOn the 15th day of June, 1215, more than two thousand Knights and Barons were encamped on the field of Runnemede to await the coming of King John and secure from him the rights of the people of England, although John had previously sworn by \"God's teeth\", his favorite oath, that he would never agree to such demands or any part of them.\n\n(Runnemede was the \"ancient meadow of council\", and is within sight of Windsor Castle. For ages, this had been crownland and rented for pasturage. When it was proposed a few years ago ((from Crown Edition of Magna Charta, Reprint 1945)), to sell the field of Runnemede to the highest bidder, a great outcry arose. (The former Cara Rogers, now Lady Fairhaven, an American girl, a member of the Magna Charta Dames, bought and presented to the British people the field of Runnemede, as a memorial to her husband, to be kept for all time as a sacred, historic spot.)\n\nOn 15 June 1215, before the day passed, the King affixed his seal to the original, but preliminary draft known as the \"Articles of the Barons\", which contained forty nine articles, setting forth the principles of the Charter. The exact terms of the Charter were decided upon during the four days that followed. On the 19th of June 1215, the great seal was affixed, presumably to twenty five duplicate copies, perhaps one for each of the twenty five Surety Barons, who were to see that King John kept his promises.\n\nNeither the King, the Barons, nor the Knights could read or write, except a few, but a scholar, who was the Secretary of the Baron of Kendal, had accompanied him to Runnemede.\n\nDESCENT OF ISAREL DE TAILLEFUR, second Wife of KING JOHN OF ENGLAND from CHARLEMAGNE:\n\n(1) Charlemagne: (2) Louis I, the Debonaire, Roman Emperor from 814 to 840; (3) Louis of Germany, born 806, died 876, married Emma; (4) Carloman, died 880, married Litwindia, of Corinthia; (5) Arnulph, died 899, married Oda, of Bavaria; (6) Edith of Germany, married Otto, Duke of Saxony, died 912; (7) Henry I, the Fowler, born 876, died 936, married Matilda of Ringleheim; (8) Hedwige, Married Hugh, Duke of France, who died 956; (9) Hugh Capet, King of France, born 938, died 996, married Adela, daughter of Otto I; (10) Robert, The Pious, born 971, died 1031, married Constance, daughter of William, Count of Toulouse, his son; (11) Henry I, King of France, born about 1005, died 1060, married, third, Anne of Russia, daughter of Jarouslous and grand-daughter of Vladimir, first Czar of Russia, their son; (12) Philip I.

His daughter; (23) Petronella was only two years old when her father abdicated the throne in her favor. He had arranged that Raymund Berenger V, Count of Barcelona, should govern the realm as Prince of Aragon, and that he should, at the proper time, marry Petronella. This was accomplished in accordance with his wish. Petronella died 18 October 1172, their son; (24) Alphonse II, King of Aragon, born 1151, died 25 April 1196, married his cousin Sanchia, who was descended as follows;\n\nKING SANCHO III (Navarre) and his wife Munia, as stated above, were the parents of (1) Ferdinand I, King of Castile from 1033 to 1065, died in battle 27 Dec. 1065.

In 1272 he went on a Crusade as far as Acre, where his daughter JOAN (see later) was born, and although he inherited the crown that year, he did not return to England until 1274, being crowned on August 19th. He was eminent as a ruler and as a legislator, and succeeded in enacting many new laws. He determined to authorize no new legislation without the counsel and acquiescence of those who were most affected by it. Not until late in his reign did he call a whole Parliament together. Instead he called the Barons together in any matter that affected the Barons, and the representatives of the townsmen together in any matter that affected the townsmen, and so with other classes. Edward's first wife,\n\nELEANOR OF CASTILE, whom he married in 1254, died 20 Nov.\n\n1290.

In 1290, Joan married, as his second wife, Earl Gilbert de Clare, The \"Red Earl\", Crusader, Knight, ninth Earl of Clare, Earl of Hertford and Cloucester, born 2 September 1243, died 7 December 1295. The \"Red Earl\" was descended from four of the twenty-five Magna Charta Surety Barons chosen by the Barons and Knights of England as Sureties to enforce the provisions laid down in the \"Articles of the Barons\", (the forerunner of Magna Charta,) which contained the first constitutional rights ever granted the subjects of a monarch. (No one signed Magna Charta, as neither King John nor the Barons could write, and at common law, sealing was sufficient to authenticate any formal document.)\n\n(IMPORTANT NOTE: In this script the names of the Surety Barons are indicated by three small stars, or asterisks, as below:) the four Magna Charta Surety Baron ancestors of Gilbert de Clare, the \"Red Earl\", who married Princess Joan Plantagener, were;\n\n***RICHARD DE CLARE, Surety,\n\n***GILBERT DE CLARE, Surety,\n\n***JOHN DE LACIE, Surety,\n\n***SAIRE DE QUINCEY, Surety,\n\nthe relationship as set forth below;\n\n***Richard de Clare, Magna Charta Surety Baron, Earl of\n\nHertford, died 1217, married Amicia Muellent.
