Esta corta guerra acabó cuando Alfonso fue capturado en Badajoz. Quizás debido a su matrimonio con Urraca, Fernando dejó que Alfonso se fuera. Sin embargo, la unión de Fernando II y Urraca fue disuelta en 1175 por el Papa, usando el hecho de que Urraca era su prima lejana como justificación.\n\nDespués de la disolución de esta unión, Urraca volvió a la corte de su padre.

She married Ferdinand II of León (c. 1165) with whom she had Alfonso IX of León. This marriage didn't prevent her father King Afonso I of Portugal from declaring war on his son-in-law. This short war culminated in disaster when Afonso was captured in Badajoz. Perhaps due to his marriage to Urraca, Ferdinand was generous to King Afonso of Portugal, and let him leave.

The following year she inherited the throne from her father Alfonso VI Fernandez of Castile and Leon (1040-1109). Her second marriage in the year 1109 to Alfonso I Perez de Aragon (d. 1134) ended in divorce in 1114. Her reign was disturbed by strife among the powerful nobles and especially by constant warfare with her husband, who had seized her lands. She never remarried, though she took several lovers. Another thorn in her side was her half-sister, Tarasa of Portugal and her husband, Enrique, who allied with her estranged husband, then betrayed him when a better offer came from Urraca's court. After her brother-in-law's death in 1112, her sister still contested ownership of lands. With the aid of her son, Alfonso Raimúndez, Urraca was able to win back much of her domain and ruled successfully until her death. According to the Chronicon Compostellanum, she died in childbirth in 1126. The father was her lover, Count Pedro González of Lara. She was succeeded by her legitimate son, Alfonso VII Raymundez of Castile and Leon \"Imperator totus Hispaniae\" (d. 1157), She lived (1082-1128/29).\n\nhttp://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.guide2womenleader...\n\nUrraca of Portugal\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nInfanta Urraca of Portugal (Coimbra, 1151 – 16 October 1188; pron.
