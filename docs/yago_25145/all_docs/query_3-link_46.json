        "text": "celticp...@gmail.com\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nDear Newsgroup ~\n\nQuestions have arisen regarding Maud de Holand, wife successively of John de Mowbray, Knt., 3rd Lord Mowbray (died 1361), and Thomas de Swinnerton, Knt., 3rd Lord Swinnerton (died 1361). Complete Peerage's coverage of Maud de Holand's two marriages in its accounts of the Mowbray and Swinnerton families is wholly inadequate.\n\nThe evidence of Maud's two marriages is crystal clear. Maud's first marriage appears to have been contracted when she was a small child. Evidence of the marriage is proven by a charter dated c.1319 of John de Mowbray, lord of the isle of Axholme and of Gower, to John his eldest son and Maud his son’s wife [Reference: Berkeley Castle Muniments, BCM/D/1/1/1 (available at http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk). This charter can be dated by Cal. IPM 7 (1909): 41–56, which indicates that this charter was granted eight years previous to 1327.\n\nFollowing the issuance of this charter, on 26 Feb. 1321/2 John de Mowbray, his mother, Aline, and Maud daughter of Robert de Holand were arrested and conducted to the Tower of London. The marriage of John and Maud was subsequently voided sometime before 28 Feb. 1326/7 (grant of his marriage to Henry, Earl of Lancaster). The marriage and divorce of John de Mowbray and Maud de Holand are specifically recorded in an ancient genealogy of the Mowbray family recorded in Coucher, Book of Furness Abbey 2(2) (Chetham Soc. n.s. 76) (1916): 289–292:\n\n“Qui quidem Johannes duxit uxorem / filiam Roberti de Holand, sed divortio inter eos celebrato legitime postea duxit in uxorem Johannam sororem Henrici primi ducis Lancastrie ... Johannes vero secundus ... sepultus est apud Bedford apud Fratres Minores ibidem, et Johanna uxor ejus ... sepulta est apud Biland.”).\n\nOn 26 October 1332 Maud daughter of Sir Robert de Holand subsequently quitclaimed to John de Mowbray all her right to the three Yorkshire manors which had been settled on them c.1319 by his father; in return he agreed to grant her the manors of Ryarsh, Kent and Crick, Northamptonshire for the term of her life.\n\nFollowing this release, Maud married Sir Thomas de Swinnerton, Knt., 3rd Lord Swinnerton.\n\nThe marriage of Maud de Holand and Sir Thomas de Swinnerton is attested by no less than two visitations:\n\n1. Colby, Vis. of Devon 1564 (1881): 132–134 (Holland ped.: “Matilda Holland = Tho. Swinnerton, mother of Robert”).\n\n2. Glover et al., Vis. of Cheshire 1580, 1566, 1533 & 1591 (H.S.P. 18) (1882): 201 (Swinerton ped.: “Sr Thomas Swinerton. = [left blank].), 202–204 (Savage ped.: “Sr Thomas Swinarton = Maud d. to Sr Rob’t Holland.”).\n\nAs stated above, Maud de Holand was granted the manors of Ryarsh, Kent and Crick, Northamptonshire for life by her former husband, John de Mowbray. Following her marriage to Sir Thomas de Swinnerton, Thomas is found in possession of Crick, Northamptonshire in 1346 [see Feudal Aids 4 (1906): 35, 444]. This confirms that the Maud de Holand who married John de Mowbray is the same person who married Thomas de Swinnerton.\n\nThe death date of Maud de Holand is unknown. However, she appears to have died sometime before 10 May 1380, when the manor of Crick, Northamptonshire, which she held for her life, had reverted to the possession of the Mowbray family. Following her death, Maud was buried in the church of Swinnerton, Staffordshire, with an effigy over whom was written “Matilidis de Swynnerton,” and a shield giving the arms of Holand, namely, azure, semée of fleurs-de-lys argent, a lion rampant guardant argent.\n\nI've copied below my current file account of Maud de Holand. The account below includes reference to Maud de Holand's daughter, Anne de Swinnerton, wife of John Beysin and Thomas Latimer, Knt, de jure 5th Lord Latimer. Anne's marriage to Sir Thomas Latimer is likewise also an addition to Complete Peerage.\n\nFor interest's sake, the following is a list of the 17th Century New World immigrants that descend from Maud de Holand and her 2nd husband, Sir Thomas de Swinnerton:\n\nRobert Abell, Thomas Bressey, Obadiah Bruen, Agatha, Alice, Eleanor, Jane & Martha Eltonhead, John Fenwick, Thomas Gerard, Oliver Manwaring, Thomas Owsley, James Taylor, Amy Wyllys.\n\nDo you descend from Maud de Holand and Sir Thomas de Swinnerton? If so, I'd appreciate seeing your line of descent from them posted her on the newsgroup.\n\nDouglas Richardson, Historian and Genealogist\n\n+ + + + + + + + + +\n\nROBERT DE HOLAND, Knt., 1st Lord Holand, married MAUD LA ZOUCHE [see HOLAND 11].\n\n12. MAUD DE HOLAND. She married (1st) before 26 Feb. 1321/2 JOHN DE MOWBRAY, Knt., 3rd Lord Mowbray, of Thirske, Yorkshire [see MOWBRAY 5], son and heir of John de Mowbray, Knt., 2nd Lord Mowbray, by Aline, daughter and co-heiress of William de Brewes (or Breuse), Knt. He was born at Hovingham, Yorkshire 29 Nov. 1310 and baptized there. About 1319 his father granted John and Maud his wife the manors of Burton in Lonsdale, Hovingham, and Kirkby Malzeard, Yorkshire, saving to the father the right to hunt therein when he wished. On 26 Feb. 1321/2 John de Mowbray, his mother, Aline, and Maud daughter of Robert de Holand were arrested and conducted to the Tower of London. The marriage of John and Maud was subsequently voided sometime before 28 Feb. 1326/7 (grant of his marriage to Henry, Earl of Lancaster). On 26 October 1332 Maud daughter of Sir Robert de Holand quitclaimed to him all her right to the three Yorkshire manors which had been settled on them by his father; in return he agreed to grant her the manors of Ryarsh, Kent and Crick, Northamptonshire for the term of her life. Maud married (2nd) THOMAS DE SWINNERTON (or SWYNNERTON), Knt., 3rd Lord Swinnerton, of Swinnerton, Staffordshire, Great and Little Barrow, Cheshire, Hostiarius to King Edward III, King’s Bachelor, Sheriff of Shropshire and Staffordshire, 1341–3, Escheator in cos. Shropshire and Staffordshire, 1342–3, Knight of the Shire for Staffordshire, 1343 (but never summoned to Parliament), and, in right of his wife, of Crick, Northamptonshire, 3rd son of Roger de Swinnerton, Knt., 1st Lord Swinnerton, of Swinnerton, Alstonefield, Quarnford, and Rushton Spencer, Staffordshire, Governor of the Town of Stafford, Governor of Eccleshale and Harlech Castles, Keeper of the Tower of London, 1321–3, by Maud, daughter of Thomas Haughton, Knt. They had three sons, Robert, Knt. [4th Lord Swinnerton], William, and Roger, and one daughter, Anne (wife of John Beysin and Thomas Latimer, Knt, de jure 5th Lord Latimer). In 1338 he was about to go overseas with the king. In 1341 he was exempted for life from being put on assizes, juries or recognizances, etc. against his will. His wife, Maud, was living in 1343. She was presumably still alive in 1346, when her husband, Thomas, occurs as lord of Crick, Northamptonshire, which manor she held for the term of her life. On 3 August 1345 the king granted him an annuity of 40 marks at the Exchequer, until he should be provided for as befits his estate out of wards, marriages, rents, etc. On 20 Nov. 1345 Richard, Earl of Arundel, Justice of North Wales, was ordered to arrest him. On 27 Dec. 1345 the king ordered the treasurer and chamberlains not to pay any fees or sums of money to him, without the king’s special order, as the king had ordered divers sheriffs to take all his lands, goods, and chattels into the king’s hand for certain contempts and misdeeds. He was present at the Battle of Crécy in 1346 and at the Siege of Calais in 1347. On 28 Dec. 1347 the king granted him an annuity of 40 marks at the exchequer for his fee by reason of his stay with the king. In 1347–9 Sir Thomas de Swynnerton, Knt., door-keeper of the king’s hall, was paid for hangings provided in the hall. About 1349 he was heir to his older brother, Robert de Swinnerton, Dean of St. Mary’s, Stafford, by which he inherited the manors of Swinnerton, Alstonefield, etc. In 1349 he sued the Abbot of Lilleshull in the Court of Common Pleas in a Shropshire plea regarding a debt. The same year he sued William le Goldesmyth, of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, in the Court of Common Pleas in a Staffordshire plea regarding a reasonable account of the time he was his receiver of money. He presented to the church of Swinnerton, Staffordshire in 1350. In 1351 he gave a receipt of rent of 40s. to James de Pype, Knt. In 1357 the king gave £100 towards his ransom, he having been taken prisoner in Scotland. In 1358 he proceeded to France as the king’s proxy to receive the oaths of the manucaptors for the king’s prisoners. The same year he appears to have served as one of the custodians of Jean, King of France, in the Palace of Savoy. He and his five squires and six mounted archers were paid for their wages of war from October 1359 to May 1360, when the treaty of Bretigny was signed. On 8 Nov. 1361, in consideration of his long service, he was exempted from being put on assizes, juries, recognitions, etc. against his will. SIR THOMAS DE SWINNERTON, 3rd Lord Swinnerton, is said by Ormerod and Leycester’s Antiquities to have died in Dec. 1361, apparently in France. In Easter 1362 his executors were granted £66 13s. 4d., being part payment of his wages of war, his reward, and for the re-passage of his horses. The death date of his wife, Maud, is unknown; however, she appears to have died sometime before 10 May 1380, when the manor of Crick, Northamptonshire, which she held for her life, had reverted to the possession of the Mowbray family. She was buried in the church of Swinnerton, Staffordshire, with an effigy over whom was written “Matilidis de Swynnerton,” and a shield giving the arms of Holand, namely, azure, semée of fleurs-de-lys argent, a lion rampant guardant argent.\n\nReferences:\n\nOrmerod, Hist. of Chester 1 (1819): 526–527; 2 (1819): 185.
