Earlier, he and his brother Ebal de Genève had fled from Geneva with their Savoyard mother after their uncle, Count William II of Geneva, Comte Humbert I's younger brother, usurped the throne when Humbert I died in 1225.[4]\n\nDeposed \"Count\" Peter found refuge in England when his cousin, Peter II, Count of Savoy, nicknamed \"the little Charlemagne,\" went there after their aunt Eleanor's wedding to King Henry III. Before February 19, 1244, he married a wealthy heiress, Maud de Lacy, of Hertfordshire, whose father was the English Governor of Meath province, Ireland. Peter was also named as the Governor of Windsor Castle in Berkshire, England. The couple had two children, a boy and a girl, but both died in infancy.\n\nPeter, \"Governor of Windsor Castle,\" of Geneva died in June 1249 in Hertfordshire, England. His widow then married Geoffrey de Geneville, a nobleman from Champagne, France, who was closely related to the Savoyard dynasty and its nobility. He also held lands in Meath province, Ireland. They had 8 sons (including 2 named \"Peter\") and 2 daughters.\n\n\"Parmi les plus notables, citons les deux fils du comte Humbert de Genève, Pierre et Ebal, écartés de la succession par leur oncle Guillaume II à la mort de leur père. Si on trouve Pierre dans le sillage de Thomas de Savoie en 1200 -- il a alors environ quinze ans -- il faut attendre 1242 pour le voir fair partie de l'état-major de Pierre de Savoie; il participe à la campagne de Poitou et de Gascogne menée par Henri III pour recouvrer la Normandie. En 1244, Pierre de Genève est l'epoux de Mathilde Lacy qui héritera du château de Ludlow, encore visible de nos jours. Pierre est un familier de Pierre de Savoie. Il assiste à la donation faite à ce dernier de l'honneur d'Eagle. Il fréquente les grands de la cour d'Henri III, Richard, comte de Cornouailles, Simon III de Monfort; il est l'objet de faveurs royales. En 1247, il est châtelain de Windsor, l'une des trois principales forteresses royales, les deux autres étant Westminster et la Tour de Londres. Il succède dans cette fonction à Bernard de Savoie. On ne connaît pas exactement la date de sa mort; elle se situe entre le 26 mars et le 27 juin 1249. L'une de ses terres est remise à un membre de la famille de Grammont, originaire elle aussi d'une région voisine de Genève, le Bugey.\" [5]\n\nTranslation:\n\nAmong the most notable are the two sons of Count Humbert of Geneva, Peter and Ebal, removed from the estate by their uncle William II at the death of their father.If we find Pierre in the wake of Thomas of Savoy in 1200 - - he was then about fifteen years old - it was not until 1242 to see him part of the staff of Pierre de Savoie, he participated in the campaign of Poitou and Gascony led by Henry III to recover Normandy. Pierre de Geneve is the husband of Mathilde Lacy who will inherit Ludlow's castle, still visible today Pierre is a familiar Pierre de Savoie, he attends the donation made to the latter of the honor of Eagle. He frequented the grandees of the court of Henry III, Richard, Earl of Cornwall, Simon III of Monfort, he is the object of royal favors.In 1247, he is lord of Windsor, one of the three main royal fortresses, the other two being Westminster and the Tower of London. this function to Bernard de Savoie. The date of his death is not exactly known; it is between March 26 and June 27, 1249. One of his land is given to a member of the family Grammont, also from a neighboring region of Geneva, the Bugey.\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Watson, G.W., \"The Families of Lacy, Geneva, Joinville, and La Marche.\" published in The Genealogist (London: Golding and Lawrence) 1905.
