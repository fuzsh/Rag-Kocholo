        "text": "Maud of Savoy (Portuguese: Mafalda de Saboia, also known as Mahaut or Matilda) (1125–1158) was the first Queen of Portugal. She was Queen consort through her marriage, in 1146, to King Afonso I, the first ruler of Portugal as an independent kingdom.\n\nShe was the second or third daughter of Amadeus III of Savoy, Count of Savoy and Maurienne, and his wife Mahaut of Albon (the sister of Guigues IV of Albon, \"le Dauphin\").\n\nWalter Map's account of her death\n\nWalter Map tells a story that \"the King of Portugal now living\", almost certainly Afonso, had been convinced by evil counselors to murder his pregnant wife out of misplaced jealousy. However, there is no other authority for this account, and it is not generally accepted.\n\nAfonso and Maud's descendants\n\nInfante Henrique (1147 – c. 1157)\n\nInfanta Mafalda (1148 – c. 1160)\n\nInfanta Urraca (1151–1188), married to King Ferdinand II of León.\n\nSancha (1153–1159)\n\nSancho I, King of Portugal (1154–1212), married to Dulce, Infanta of Aragon (daughter of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona and Queen Petronila of Aragon)\n\nInfanta Theresa (1157–1218), married to Philip I, Count of Flanders and next to Eudes III, Duke of Burgundy\n\nInfante João (1156–1156)\n\nSee also\n\nHistory of Portugal\n\nTimeline of Portuguese history\n\nFirst Dynasty: Burgundy (12th to 14th Century)\n\nPreceded by\n\nNone Queen consort of Portugal\n\n1146–1158 Succeeded by\n\nDulce of Aragon"
