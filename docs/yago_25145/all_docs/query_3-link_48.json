        "text": "Women married to the Plantagenet kings of England had quite different backgrounds. On the following, pages are introductions to each of these English queens, with basic information about each, and some linked to a more detailed biography.\n\nThe Plantagenet royal dynasty began when Henry II became king. Henry was the son of Empress Matilda (or Maud), whose father, Henry I, one of the Norman kings of England, had died without any living sons. Henry, I had his nobles swear to support Matilda after his death, but her cousin Stephen quickly took the crown instead, leading to the civil war called the Anarchy. In the end, Stephen kept his crown, Matilda was never made a queen in her own right -- but Stephen named Matilda's son rather than his own younger, surviving son as his heir.\n\nMatilda had married, first, the Holy Roman Emperor Henry V.
