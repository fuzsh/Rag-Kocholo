        "text": "The question of alliances between women of the stage and men of the peerage was already a very old one by the time the theatre entered its 'Golden Age' - although for most of that time such alliances were rare and severely frowned upon. The first known instance of an actress marrying a peer was that of Miss Anastasia Robinson, a beautiful operatic singer, who was taken to wife by the Third Earl of Peterborough (Charles Mordaunt) around 1724 (sources disagree to the exact year). In deferrence to the mores of the time, however, this marriage was kept secret for some years, with Anastasia living apart from the Earl and generally regarded to be his mistress. Their marriage was only openly sanctified a few months before both their deaths in 1735.\n\nIn 1752 at Aix in Provence, another beautiful actress/singer, Lavinia Fenton, was married to the Third Duke of Bolton (Charles Powlett) after a long affair and bore him three sons. From then until 1880 (notionally the beginning of the 'Golden Age') around ten other such marriages occured, but by far the greatest number of these alliances would occur in the period from 1880 to 1925, with the famous 'Gaiety Girls' leading the way.\n\nThe first chorus girl to marry into the peerage, and the first of the 'Gaiety Girls', was Rosie Boote. Around the beginning of the twentieth century George Edwardes began his career as a theatrical producer at the Gaiety Theatre, which he turned into a mecca for musical entertainment. His girls needed to be able to sing and dance a little, but the main requisite was that they must be pretty, and he put together a bevy of the most beautiful girls in England. Their fame quickly spread and soon eligible and fashionable young men, the \"stage-door Johnnies\", began to haunt the Gaiety with arms full of flowers and bottles of champagne in the hopes of meeting one of these beauties and escorting her to dinner. Soon the 'Gaiety Girls', most of whom came from simple backgrounds, became a regular sight at the very best London restaurants, enjoying meals that would have cost them a week's salary, paid for by the badly smitten scion of some rich or noble family. Rosie Boote was of that ilk - although she did at least come from a good middle-class family - but Society was still shocked when the Marquis of Headfort elected to marry her. Despite the difference in station however, the marriage was a good one and lasted until the Marquis death. Rosie's charming manner soon won over his family's objections to the match and she fitted into her new station with seeming ease. The couple had two sons and a daughter together.\n\nA number of other 'Gaiety Girls' would go on marry Peers. A few, like Rosie, would snare a noble husband before they themselves had ever graduated beyond the chorus line. Others, like Gertie Millar, would do so after they had used that as stepping stone to far greater theatrical success.\n\nMany of these marriages were greatly resisted by the families of the men in question. When Lord Dalmeny proposed to Phyllis Dare in March 1903 for example, his family intervened and had the young man rapidly shipped off to Scotland out of harms way. But when her sister, Zena Dare, became engaged to Maurice Brett, son of Lord Esther, a few years later she received altogether the opposite reaction; his Lordship describing her as a 'first-rate girl' and saying he was proud to have her join the family. But the former reaction was the more common one, with threat of disinheritance and other pressures being applied to cool the young men's ardour and prevent them from going through with any proposed marriage. But to renege on a promise of marriage in those days was, in itself, not without consequence. This was an era, before women's emancipation, in which the average woman was largely dependant upon a man for financial security and, in recognition of that fact, a man's promise of marriage carried the full weight of a legal contract. This was the legal tort of \"breach of promise,\" wherein to retract upon a promise of marriage entitled the offended party to compensation for the loss of any benefits, financiual or otherwise, that might otherwise have accrued from the marriage. Sinced the retraction of such a promise might seriously detracdt from a woman's future security the sum of compensation awarded in such cases could be substantial. A number of nobles therefore were made to pay heavily for not fully thinking through their promises of marriage. A few notable cases are detailed below:\n\n1885? - Miss Julia Fortesque, an actress at the Savoy, was slighted by Viscount Garmoyle and sued for breach of promise - a court awarded her £10000 to make good her loss. Only a few years after this incident, the Viscount passed away at an early age from heart disease.\n\n1896 - Popular dancer Birdie Sutherland (Anne Louise Watkins) was slighted by the Hon. Dudley Churchill Marjoribanks, heir to Baron Tweedmouth. He proposed to her and was accepted, but his family objected and the young man sailed to Canada with his mother and did not return for some time. Abandoned, Birdie filed suit and was compensated to the sum of �5000.\n\n1897 - Viscount Dangan was ordered to pay over �3000 to the young actress Phyllis Broughton after he reneged on his promise to marry her. In 1906, the Viscount did actually marry another showgirl, May Picard in New York, but only after breaking off another engagement to chorus girl Pearl Aufrere in London. Miss Aufrere did not sue as she shortly afterward married another rich admirer.\n\n1913 - Actress Daisy Markham (Violet Moss) sued the Earl of Compton, heir to marquis of Northampton who withdrew his proposal when his furious father ordered him never to see the girl. The Marquis died during the course of proceedings, potentially clearing the way for the marriage to go ahead, but the new Marquis had been swayed by his fathers arguments - he was made to pay �5000 plus all the costs of the court case.\n\nMany other similar cases were settled privately, with the girl in question being \"bought off\" without the scandal of a public hearing. It should be noted at this point that the tort of 'breach of promise' was by no means unique to English law, but that England was at the time by far the most favourable place in the World for a girl to bring such an action. English courts were far more sympathetic to the girls point of view than those on the continent where, in most cases, she would be required to prove actual pecuniary loss in order to succeed. Similarly in the USA, whilst a few individual states approached the English viewpoint, most were far more conservative and a few did not recognise breach of promise as a cause of action at all.\n\nWhat \"The Throne\" Had to Say\n\nDespite the fact that these marriages were generally frowned upon in High Society, they became so commonplace that \"The Throne\", the semi-official journal of the English royal court, felt it necessary to publish an article in its February 1913 issue abjuring them. The article was prompted by the recent marriage of Olive May to Lord Victor Paget and it had this to say:\n\nWhy should actresses, of all women, be considered \"the most unsuitable to be the wives of men of high position\"? First of all it was because they came from a profession that was, at that time, still considered to be more than a little vulgar in polite society, despite the fact that high society itself accounted for many of the theatre's best patrons. Furthermore, as a profession, it was even more damning for a woman than it was for a man, since a woman, certainly in high society circles, was expected to be demure and not 'exhibit' herself in public. The second reason was that most of these girls came from lowly backgrounds (because of the former reason, few women of good standing took to the stage) and so would be marrying far above their station.\n\nThe article had more to say about the offsping of such unions:\n\nThis point was further illustrated with a rough diagram:\n\nA. Peer of historic family with unblemished lineage.\n\n+\n\nB. Lady with unknown ancestry which may be tainted.\n\n=\n\nC. Their son, who by reason of his father's blood alone inherits the rights of an hereditory legislator, although he may also have inherited the moral, mental and physical blemishes of his mother's unknown ancestry.\n\nThis was, of course, to modern sensibilities, a monstrous imputation, smugly suggesting in no uncertain terms that women of low standing were of an inferior breed and would taint the blood of the superior breed to which the lordlings belonged - like breeding a pure-bred pedigree dog with a cross-bred mongrel. In gist, the article proposed barring Peers who married actresses from continuing to occupy their seats in the House of Lords, or at least of removing from their children the hereditary privilege of following them in that esteemed position. That these arguments were spurious hardly needs enunciating further. In fact many of these actresses fitted extremely well into high society when they were given the chance. To 'make it' on stage was not an easy task. Those that did, by force, possessed or learned confidence, self-assurance, wit and charm. They were, by and large, women of some character and in a number of instances proved the making of their foppish husbands.\n\nThe table below lists known actresses who married Peers or sons of Peers (many of whom succeeded to their fathers titles during their marriages) between 1880 and 1925 - the period whan the greatest number of these marriages took place.\n\nActress' Marriages to Nobility 1880 - 1925 1884Dolly Tester (Dorothy Haseley)Marquis of Ailesbury (George W.T.
