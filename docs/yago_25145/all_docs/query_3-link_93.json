Chamberlain of Middlewich.Â\n\nPardoned in 1438, styled esquire and gentleman. In 1446 he sued his half brother, Richard Pershale, and obtained his mother's manor at Rushton Spencer and the right to advowson (appoint clergy) at Checkley, Staffordshire, half the manor of Dore in Derbyshire.\n\nRobert Savage\n\nRobert's line is as follows:\n\nSir Knight Thomas Savage born 1285 Stainesby, Derbyshire, England, married unk abt 1295 at Stoke Albany, Northamptonshire, died abt 1331\n\nSir John Savage born 1250\n\nSir John Savage born bef 1220, married Agatha St Andreis d/o Henry\n\nJohn le Savage born abt 1185 Stainesby, Derbyshire, England\n\nJohn le Savage born abt 1144 Stainesby, Derbyshire, England, died aft 1208\n\nSir Geoffrey le Savage born abt 1120 Stainesby, Derbyshire, England, married Lettice de Arderne, d/o Sir Henry abt 1143, died 1190\n\nJohn le Savage born abt 1098 Stainesby, Derbyshire, England, married the widow of Guillaume de Sabran\n\nRobert le Savage born abt 1073 Stainesby, Derbyshire, England\n\nAdam le Savage, born abt 1049 Scarcliffe, Derbyshire, England\n\nJohn le Savage Esq, born abt 1024 Scarcliffe, Derbyshire, England, died aft 1090\n\nThomas le Savage born abt 1000 Normandy France, died after 1066, married unknown abt 1023, Scarcliffe, Derbyshire, England - 27G grandfather\n\nMathilda de Saint Valery\n\nMurdered by King John who had her walled up alive in her castle walls with her first son William. Ye gads. Her husband was John's sixth cousin.\n\n~~~~\n\nSon William did not accompany King Richard on Crusade but fought with King John Lackland against Philip of France in Normandy in 1203 or 1204. John demanded William as a hostage for his father's loyalty in 1208. His mother Maud refused and they fled to the family estates in Ireland. In 1210 John prepared an expedition to Ireland. Maud and William escaped Ireland but were apprehended in Scotland. William the father was in Wales at this time. It is believed that Maud and William were starved to death at Windsor Castle, some say Corfe.\n\nKnown as the Lady of la Haie and to the Welsh as Moll Walbee. She was a significant warrior in her own right. Her long defence of Pain's Castle when it was besieged by the Welsh earned it the name \"Matilda's Castle\". The local people saw her as a supernatural character. She was said to have built Hay Castle (above) single handed in one night, carrying the stones in her apron. When one fell out and lodged in her slipper she picked it out and flung it to land in St Meilig's churchyard, three miles away across the River Wye at Llowes.\n\nThe final fall of her husband may owe a lot to her hasty reply to King John when he requested her son William as a hostage in 1208. She refused on the grounds that John had murdered his nephew Arthur whom he should have protected. The dispute between John and the de Braoses led to Maud dying of starvation in the King's castle at Windsor along with her son, while her husband, stripped of all his lands, died the following year in exile in France. Ah HA!!!!\n\nhttp://freespace.virgin.net/doug.thompson/BraoseWeb/index1.htm\n\nPorpora\n\nDaughter of Laidolfo Count of Tabellaria (the son of Alfano, Count of Tabellaria and Porpora of Amalfi) and Aldara of San Massimo of Teano (the daughter of Truppualdo Count of San Massimo)\n\nGarcia IV\n\nCalled the Trembling, the Tremulous, or the Trembler (in Spanish, el Temblón), was the king of Pamplona and count of Aragón from 994 until his death. He was the son of King Sancho II and Urraca Fernández.\n\nHe tried to escape the submission his father had offered to Córdoba, as a result of which he had to face Almanzor. In 996 he was forced to seek peace in Córdoba. In 997 during an expedition into the land of Calatayud, García killed the governor's brother. Almanzor took revenge by beheading 50 Christians.\n\nAt the Battle of Cervera in July 1000, he allied with King Alfonso V of León, Count Sancho I of Castile, and Count García Gómez of Carrión.\n\nHe married Jimena, daughter of Ferdinand Vermúdez, count of Cea, and Elvira. Among their children were the future king Sancho Garcés III and Urraca, later the second wife of Alfonso V of Leon.\n\nSancho II\n\nOf the Basque dynasty of Aritza, was king of Pamplona and count of Aragon from 970 until 994. He was the son of García III and Andregoto, the daughter and heiress to Count Galindo II Aznárez of Aragon.\n\nThe Historia General de Navarra by Jaime del Burgo says (referencing in turn the Anales del Reino de Navarra of José de Moret) that on the occasion of the donation of the villa of Alastue by the king of Pamplona to the monastery of San Juan de la Peña in 987, he titled himself \"King of Navarre,\" the first time that title had been used. In many places he appears as the first King of Aragon and in others the third. The titles, however, did not come into common usage until the later merger of the Aragonese crown to Navarre.\n\nUnder Sancho and his immediate successors, Navarre reached the height of its power and its largest size. During this period, the kingdoms of Leon and Navarre and the County of Castile were united by familial bonds; the Navarrese monarchy supported the young Ramiro II when he secured the throne of Leon.\n\nUpon the death of the Muslim Caliph of Cordoba, Al-Hakam II, in 976 and the succession of his son Hisham II, who had been taught by Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir, the prospects of the Christian kingdoms became even worse. The troops of Al-Mansur defeated the Christians at Torrevicente, south of Soria. Afterwards, the Muslims returned to triumph at Taracueña, near Osma. In 975, Sancho was defeated by the Moors at San Esteban de Gormaz, and in 981 at Rueda, a dozen kilometers from Tordesillas, the Christians suffered another humiliating defeat.\n\nBecause he could not defeat Al-Mansur by arms, Sancho went to Córdoba as an ambassador for his own kingdom, bringing many gifts for the victorious Al-Mansur, making a pact with him and agreeing to give the Muslim his daughter in marriage. From this union was born Abd al-Rahman Sanchuelo, the second successor of lord Al-Mansur who tried to usurp the Caliphate of Córdoba from the Umayyad heir.\n\nSancho married Urraca Fernández of Castile, the daughter of count Ferdinand Gonzalez and possibly of Sancha of Pamplona around 962. Before 950, Urraca had been married to Ordono III of Leon and in 956 she married his enemy, conqueror and successor Ordono IV of Leon the Bad, from whom she separated. Sancho was her third and last husband.\n\nUrraca's father, Ferdinand II González (930970) was the first independent count of Castile, son of Gonzalo Fernández de Lara, who had been named count of Arlanza and the Duero around the year 900, a descendent of Nuño Rasura, one of the two judges from Castile, and of Rodrigo, the first of the counts from Castile. Ferdinand González was a colourful character of legendary status in Iberia and a member of the influential Lara family. In the year 930, Ferdinand's name appears with the title of count inside the administrative organization of eastern the Kingdom of León. His life and feats are recorded in an anonymous poem, The Poem of Fernán González, written between 1250 and 1271 and conserved as an incomplete copy from the fifteenth century. His statue stands in Madrid.\n\nGarcia III\n\nKing of Pamplona from 925 until his death in 970. He was the son of King Sancho I and Toda Aznárez. His father was very old at his birth and died in 925, leaving the kingdom to his six-year-old son. García's mother took over as regent and García's uncle Jimeno became king-regent. Jimeno died in 931, after which the underage García was the sole king.\n\nThrough his mother, García was a great-grandson of King Fortún Garcés who had ceased to reign in 905 when imprisoned by enemies, but lived on until Garcia's own reign as a monk in Leyra.\n\nWith the support of his energetic and diplomatic mother, García, like his father, engaged in a number of conflicts with the Moors. He married Andregota Galíndez, heiress of Aragón, but divorced her.\n\nGarcía was succeeded by his son Sancho II Garcés, nicknamed Abarca.\n\nAdelaide of Savoy\n\ndaughter of Humbert II of Savoy and Gisela of Burgundy, and niece of Pope Callixtus II, who once visited her court in France. Her father died in 1103, and her mother married Renier I of Montferrat as a second husband.\n\nShe became the second wife of Louis VI of France (1081-1137), whom she married on August 3, 1115. They had eight children, the second of whom became Louis VII of France. She was reputed to be \"ugly,\" but attentive and pious, and with Louis she had six sons and two daughters.\n\nAfer Louis VI's death, Adélaide did not immediately retire to conventual life, as did most widowed queens of the time. Instead she married Matthieu I of Montmorency, with whom she had one child. She remained active in the French court and in religious activities.\n\nAdélaide is one of two queens in a legend related by William Dugdale. As the story goes, Queen Adélaide of France became enamoured of a young knight, William d'Albini, at a joust. But he was already engaged to Queen Adeliza of England and refused to become her lover. The jealous Adélaide lured him into the clutches of a hungry lion, but William ripped out the beast's tongue with his bare hands and thus killed it. This story is almost without a doubt apocryphal.\n\nIn 1153 she retired to the abbey of Montmartre, which she had founded with Louis VII. She died there on November 18, 1154\n\nBeatrice de Savoie\n\nBeatrice of Savoy (1198-1266), was the daughter of Thomas I of Savoy and Marguerite of Geneva. Beatrice married on (5 June 1219) Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence. She was a shrewd and politically astute woman, whose beauty was liked by Matthew Paris to that of a second Niobe. After two stillborn sons, Ramon and Beatrice of Savoy had four daughters, who all married kings.\n\nThomas I de Savoy\n\nThomas I or Tommaso I (1178  March 1, 1233) was Count of Savoy from 1189-1233. He was the son of Humbert III of Savoy and Beatrice of Viennois. His birth was seen as miraculous; his monkish father had despaired of having a male heir after three wives. Count Humbert sought counsel from St. Anthelm, who blessed Humbert three times, and it was seen as a prophecy come true when Thomas was born shortly after Anthelm himself died on June 26, 1178. He was named in honor of St. Thomas Becket.\n\nThomas possessed the martial abilities, energy, and brilliance that his father lacked, and Savoy enjoyed a golden age under his leadership. He had taken over effective rule of Savoy by August 1191, and despite his youth he began the push north-west into new territories. He conquerored Vaud, Bugey, and Carignano. He supported the Hohenstaufens, and was known as \"Thomas the Ghibelline\" due to his career as Imperial Vicar of Lombardy.\n\nIn 1195 he ambushed the party of Count William I of Geneva, which was escorting the count's daughter, Marguerite, to France for her intended wedding to King Philip II of France. Thomas carried off Marguerite and married her himself, producing some eight sons and six daughters.\n\nHumbert III de Savoy\n\nHumbert III (11351189), surnamed the Blessed, was Count of Savoy from 1148 to 1189. According to Cope[1], \"Humbert III, who reigned from 1149 to 1189...was a man of irresolute spirit who was disconsolate at being born a prince and preferred the seclusion of a monestery. He only renounced his chosen state of celibacy so as to give his land an heir.\"\n\nHis first wife died young; his second marriage ended in divorce. Humbert gave up and became a Carthusian monk. However, the nobles and common people of Savoy begged him to marry yet again, which he reluctantly did. This third wife gave him two more daughters, and Humbert attempted to return to the monastic life yet again. Finally he was prevailed upon to marry for a fourth time, and this wife, Beatrice, produced the son who would ultimately succeed him. He married four times.\n\nSikilgaita of Salerno\n\nSikelgaita (also Sichelgaita or Sigelgaita) (104016 April 1090) was a Lombard princess, the daughter of Guaimar IV, Prince of Salerno, and second wife of Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia.\n\nShe married Robert in 1058, after Robert divorced his first wife Alberada, due to supposed consanguinity. Her sister Gaitelgrima had earlier married Robert's half-brother Drogo.\n\nSikelgaita frequently accompanied Robert on his conquests. Although at first she tried to persuade him not to attack the Byzantine Empire, she accompanied him on his campaign against them as well. At the Battle of Dyrrhachium she fought in full armour, rallying Robert's troops when they were initially repulsed by the Byzantine army. According to the Byzantine chronicler Anna Comnena, she was \"like another Pallas, if not a second Athena,\" and Anna attributes to her a quote from the Iliad.\n\nIn 1083 Sikelgaita returned to Italy with Robert to defend Pope Gregory VII against Holy Roman emperor Henry IV. She accompanied him on a second campaign against the Byzantines, during which Robert died on Corfu in 1085 with Sikelgaita at his side. Supposedly, she tried to poison Robert's son (Bohemund of Taranto) by his first wife, although the two eventually came to an agreement by which Roger Borsa was allowed to succeed Robert. With Robert, Sikelgaita had eight children\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikelgaita\n\nWaimar IV\n\nGuaimar IV[1] (c. 1013  ass. June 3 or 2, 1052) was Prince of Salerno (1027-1052), Duke of Amalfi (1039-1052), Duke of Gaeta (1040-1041), and Prince of Capua (1038-1047) in Southern Italy over the period from 1027 to 1052. He was an important figure in the final phase of Byzantine authority in the Mezzogiorno and the commencement of Norman power. He was, according to Amatus of Montecassino, \"more courageous than his father, more generous and more courteous; indeed he possessed all the qualities a layman should haveexcept that he took an excessive delight in women.\"\n\nHe was born around the year 1013, the eldest son of Guaimar III of Salerno by Gaitelgrima, daughter of Duke Pandulf II of Benevento. His elder half-brother, the son of Porpora of Tabellaria, John (III) reigned as co-prince from 1015. When he died in 1018, Guaimar was made co-prince. He succeeded his father in Salerno in 1027 (at the age of fourteen or sixteen, possibly under the regency of his mother during his brief minority). He embarked then on a lifelong quest to control the whole of the southern third of the Italian peninsula.\n\nIn 1036, he received word that his brother-in-law and erstwhile ally, Prince Pandulf IV of Capua, aptly nickname the \"Wolf of the Abruzzi,\" had attempted to rape his niece. He then received the homage of the defecting Rainulf Drengot, formerly a vassal of Pandulf. Thus, Guaimar won the support of the Normans in the Mezzogiorno. In 1037, Guaimar made the politically savvy request of arbitration to both the Holy Roman and Byzantine emperors over the issue of Pandulf's unfitness to rule. Only Emperor Conrad II accepted the invitation and travelled south in Spring 1038. He demanded hostages from Pandulf. However, the hostages escaped and Capua was promtly besieged. Having taken that principality, he gave it to Guaimar (May[2]), who asked for a title of nobility for his new Norman vassal. This was granted and Rainulf officially became \"Count of Aversa\" and a vassal of Salerno.\n\nGuaimar set out to take possession of his new principality immediately. On 15 August, he conquered Rocca Vandra and gave it to the abbey of Monte Cassino. Meanwhile, the Normans of Aversa pacified the valley of the Sangro. After Pandulf fled to Constantinople, Guaimar turned his attention to Amalfi. In April 1039, in support of the deposed and blinded Manso II, Guaimar forced the abdication and exile of John II and his mother, Maria, a sister of Pandulf. Guaimar installed himself as duke. Then in July, he conquered Sorrento, which had been conquered by Pandulf in 1034.[3] He gave it to his brother Guy with the title of duke. He also received the homage of the Duke of Naples, John V, who had brought the request for mediation to Constantinople in 1037.\n\nIn the north, he brought Comino, Aquino, Traetto (May 1039), Venafro (October 1040), Pontecorvo, and Sora under his rule. In June 1040, he took Gaeta, which had been conquered by Pandulf in 1032. After October 1041, Guaimar ceases to appear in the acts of Gaeta and it seems he was replaced by a popular usurper related to the old dynasty, Leo. By December 1042, however, Gaeta was in the hands of Rainulf, holding it from Guaimar.\n\nMore at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaimar_IV_of_Salerno\n\nGuaimar III\n\nGuaimar III (also Waimar, Gaimar, Guaimaro, or Guaimario and sometimes numbered Guaimar IV) (c.983  c.1027) was duke (or prince) of Salerno from around 994 to his death. His date of death is sometimes given at 1030 or 1031, but the most reliable sources consistently indicate 1027. Under his reign, Salerno entered an era of great splendour and Opulenta Salernum was the inscription on his coins. He made Amalfi, Gaeta, and Sorrento his vassals and annexed much of Byzantine Apulia and Calabria.\n\nHe was the second eldest son of Duke John II of Salerno. The eldest was Guy, who ruled as co-ruler with his father from January 984 to 988. Sometime between January and March 989, John made Guaimar co-regent. In 994 (also given as 998 or 999), his father died and he became sole ruler.\n\nIn 999, a band of Norman pilgrims returning from Jerusalem stopped at the port of Salerno. While staying there, the city was attacked by Saracen pirates. The frightened Salernitans did not offer battle, but the warlike Normans did. Soon their bravery drew out the Salernitans and together they routed the Moslem menace. Guaimar promptly offered them numerous incentives to stay, but to no avail, the Normans returned to France, promising to spread the word about the need for fighting men in the south.\n\nAs a member of the independent Lombard leadership of the Mezzogiorno, Guaimar himself supported the Lombard freedom-fighter Melus of Bari and, after Melus' defeat in 1011, he was paid a visit by the victorious Byzantine catapan, Basil Mesardonites, in October. Later, he sheltered Melus. He was nominally a vassal of Holy Roman Emperor Henry II, but after the defeat at Cannae in 1018, he discreetly transferred his allegiance to the Byzantine Emperor Basil II. When Henry died in 1024, Guaimar sent an embassy to the new Emperor Conrad II to plead for the release of his brother-in-law Pandulf IV of Capua, the Wolf of the Abruzzi. Conrad, in a show of naïveté, complied. The Wolf immediately put his old capital, Capua, of which he had once been prince, under siege. An endeavour in which he had the support of Guaimar and his Normans under Ranulf Drengot and the catepan of Italy, Boiannes.\n\nGuaimar made his eldest son by his first wife, Porpora of Tabellaria (d.c.1010), John III, co-prince in 1015, but, in 1018, he died. He then made his eldest son by his second wife, Gaitelgrima, the sister of Pandulf, also named Guaimar, co-prince. It was this son who succeeded him in 1027 at the age of fourteen or sixteen under the regency of Gaitelgrima, who was basically the pawn of her brother Pandulf. Guaimar III's second son, Guy, was made gastald of Capua by his uncle and later duke of Sorrento by his elder brother. His third son, Pandulf, became lord of Capaccio. He had a daughter (probably about 1026) named Gaitelgrima, who married successively the brothers Drogo and Humphrey, counts of Apulia.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaimar_III_of_Salerno\n\nGiovanni II\n\nJohn II (died between 994 and 998), son of Lampert of Spoleto, was the count of the palace of Salerno in 980 and acting regent for Prince Pandulf II. He was pushed out with the prince by the duke of Amalfi, Manso, in 981. The rule of the Amalfitan and his son John was oppressive and the local populace rose in revolt and elected the Spoletan John prince in 983, expelling Manso.\n\nHe tried, through appointing his scribe Toto as advocate, to control the monastery of San Massimo and her property, but failed. Together with his wife Sichelgaita, he founded S. Maria de Domno and put it directly under the authority of the archdiocese of Salerno. Under its first abbot, Radoald, it was very successful, though John's attempts to control religion in his principality were less so. In January 984, John associated his son Guido with him, but Guido died in 988. Between January and March 989, he associated his next son Guaimar, who succeeded him. He left other sons in Pandulf, Lambert, John, and Peter.\n\nAccording to a legend related by Peter Damian, there was an eruption of Mount Vesuvius and John exclaimed that surely it was an omen foretelling the death of some rich man, who would surely end up in hell. The next day, John was found dead in the arms of a prostitute.\n\nEdward de Salisbury\n\nLand holdings per Domesday book: Hinton, Charterhouse. http://www.infokey.com/Domesday/Somerset.htm\n\nRanulph de Saint Valery and Guy de Saint Valery\n\nA Ranulf de St. Walerie was Lord of Randely, Stamtone, Refan, Stratone, Burgrede, and Scotome, in Lincolnshire, but how related to Walter does not appear. \"What came of him or his posterity,\" says Dugdale, \"if he had any, I know not, for those in the succeeding ages had not any lands in that county.\" \"Those\" being the issue of Reginald, son of Guy de St. Valerie, who held Hazeldine, in Gloucestershire, of which he was deprived by King Stephen, being a partizan of Henry Fitz Empress, but recovered it again on the accession of the latter, and who was one of the persons sent by him with letters to the King of France, requesting him not to give any reception or protection to the fugitive Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas &agreave; Becket.\n\nThat this Reginald was a lineal descendant of Bernard and Walter is obvious from the fact that, on the death of his grandson Thomas, in 1219 (3 Henry III), all his hereditary estates passed with Annora, sole child of Thomas, to her first husband, Robert Comte do Dreux, to whom at the same time she brought the manor of Isleworth, which Walter held in the reign of the Conqueror, and of which the Comte de Dreux was found seized in right of his wife in 1220. *[Annora married secondly Henry de Sullie, but had no issue by either husband. Orderic makes no mention of Ranulf, Guy, or Reginald in his account of the family.]\n\nhttp://genealogy.patp.us/conq/stvalery.shtml"
