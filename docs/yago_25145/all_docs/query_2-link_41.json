        "text": "Prince Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy, The Prince of Naples (February 12, 1937 – February 3, 2024) was the only son of Umberto II, the last King of Italy, and his wife Princess Marie-José of Belgium, the youngest child of King Albert I of the Belgians and his consort, Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria. Through her mother she was a grandniece of Empress Elisabeth of Austria and of Princess Maria Sophie of Bavaria, last queen consort of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.\n\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele also used the title Duke of Savoy and claimed the headship of the House of Savoy. Had the monarchy not been abolished he would have reigned as monarch under the name of King Vittorio Emanuele IV of Italy and reigned from 1983 to 2024.\n\nHe lived for most of his life in exile, following the constitutional referendum of 1946 which affirmed the abolition of the monarchy and the creation of the Italian Republic. On several occasions, he was the centre of controversy in Italy and abroad due to a series of incidents, including remarks that were seen by some as antisemitic.\n\nHe was revealed to be a member of Propaganda Due (P2), the state within a state responsible for high-level corruption and political manipulation. In France he was tried on a murder charge, of which he was cleared of unlawful killing but convicted of a firearms offence.\n\nOn June 16, 2006, following an investigation started by John Woodcock of the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Potenza, Italy, Prince Vittorio Emanuele was arrested on charges of criminal association, racketeering, conspiracy, corruption, and exploitation of prostitution. A trial on these charges began in Potenza, Italy, on December 21, 2009. Vittorio Emanuele di Savoia was acquitted of all charges in 2007 and 2010.\n\nEarly life and family\n\nWhen King Umberto II left Italy after the monarchy was abolished by the 1946 Italian institutional referendum, the remaining members of the House of Savoy lived in exile, mostly in Switzerland and on the Portuguese Riviera, though the former King Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy, grandfather to Prince Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy, lived in Egypt until his death in 1947.\n\nFollowing the separation of the exiled ex-King and ex-Queen, Prince Vittorio Emanuele lived with his mother on an estate in Merlinge, Switzerland. Prince Vittorio Emanuele and his family resided in Geneva.\n\nAfter an eleven-year relationship, Prince Vittorio Emanuele married Swiss biscuit heiress and world-ranked water skier Marina Doria in Tehran, Iran, on October 7, 1971, at the occasion of the 2,500-year celebration of the Persian Empire. Coincidentally, Prince Vittorio Emanuele and his wife Marina shared a birthday (12 February) but Prince Vittorio Emanuele is two years younger than Marina (she was born in 1935).\n\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele worked as a banker and an aircraft salesman, and then an arms dealer.\n\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele had one son, Prince Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy, Prince of Venice, born on June 22, 1972, who has two daughters.\n\nDuke of Savoy\n\nOn July 7, 2006 Prince Vittorio Emanuele’s kinsman and dynastic rival, Prince Amedeo, 5th Duke of Aosta, declared himself to be the head of the House of Savoy and Duke of Savoy, claiming that Prince Vittorio Emanuele had lost his dynastic rights when he married without the permission of Umberto II in 1971. Prince Amedeo received the support of the President of the Council of the Senators of the Kingdom Aldo Alessandro Mola and Vittorio Emanuele’s sister, Princess Maria Gabriella.\n\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele and his son applied for a judicial injunction to forbid Prince Amedeo from using the title “Duke of Savoy”. In February 2010, the court of Arezzo ruled that the Duke of Aosta and his son must pay damages totalling €50,000 to their cousins and cease using the surname Savoy instead of Savoy-Aosta.\n\nHowever, the verdict was overturned on appeal, with the court of second resort allowing Prince Amedeo the use of the short surname, in the form of di Savoia, and additionally revoking the financial penalty originally imposed on him. The dynastic dispute has not been resolved.\n\nDeath\n\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele died in Geneva, Switzerland on February 3, 2024, at the age of 86. A statement from the Royal House of Savoy gave the time of his death as 07:05 (CET).\n\nSuccession\n\nIn June of 2023, his son Prince Emanuele Filiberto, Prince of Venice announced his intention to abdicate his claim to the throne in favour of his daughter, Princess Vittoria of Savoy, when he feels she is ready to succeed. Until he formally does so he remains as his father’s heir.\n\nOn February 3, 2024, with the death of his father, Prince Emanuele Filberto became one of two claimants to the headship of the House of Savoy.\n\nThe monarchs of the House of Savoy ruled from their mainland capital of Turin, but styled themselves primarily with the royal title of Sardinia as superior to their original lesser dignity as Dukes of Savoy. However, their numeral order continued the Savoyard list.\n\nWith that in mind there was a previous Duke of Savoy, named, Prince Emanuele Filiberto (July 8, 1528 – August 30, 1580) was Duke of Savoy and ruler of the Savoyard states from August 17, 1553 until his death on August 30, 1580.\n\nTheoretically then, the new claimant to the Italian throne could be called King Emanuele Filiberto II of Italy.\n\nStephen of Blois (1092 or 1096 – October 25, 1154) was King of England from December 22, 1135 to his death in 1154. He was Count of Boulogne jure uxoris from 1125 until 1147 and Duke of Normandy from 1135 until 1144.\n\nStephen’s father was Stephen II Henri, Count of Blois and Chartres, an important French nobleman and an active crusader who died when Stephen was at most ten years old.\n\nStephen’s mother, Adela of England and Normandy, was the daughter of King William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders. She was famous among her contemporaries for her piety and strong personality. Indeed, Adela was a major reason for Stephen II Henri’s return to the Levant. She had a strong formative influence on Stephen during his growing years; she would live to see her son take her father’s throne of England, but would die within a year after that.\n\nHis father died while Stephen was still young, and he was brought up by his mother. Placed into the court of his uncle King Henry I of England, Stephen rose in prominence and was granted extensive lands.\n\nKing Henry I of England had only one other legitimate child, the future Empress Matilda, but as a woman she was at a substantial political disadvantage. Shortly after the death of his son, the King took a second wife, Adeliza of Louvain, but it became increasingly clear that he would not have another legitimate son, and he instead looked to Empress Matilda as his intended heir.\n\nEmpress Matilda’s claim to the title of Holy Roman Empress was through her marriage to Emperor Heinrich V, but her husband died in 1125, and she was remarried in 1128 to Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, whose lands bordered the Duchy of Normandy.\n\nGeoffrey was unpopular with the Anglo-Norman elite: as an Angevin ruler, he was a traditional enemy of the Normans. At the same time, tensions continued to grow as a result of Henry’s domestic policies, in particular the high level of revenue he was raising to pay for his various wars. Conflict was curtailed, however, by the power of the King’s personality and reputation.\n\nMeanwhile, the King arranged for Stephen to marry Matilda of Boulogne, inheriting additional estates in Kent and Boulogne that made the couple one of the wealthiest in England. Stephen became Count of Boulogne by jure uxoris, by right of his wife.\n\nMatilda of Boulogne was the daughter of Count Eustace III of Boulogne. Her mother, Mary of Scotland, was the daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland and Margaret of Wessex, (also known as Saint Margaret of Scotland) the daughter of the English Prince Edward the Exile of Wessex and his wife Agatha. Matilda of Boulogne was also the granddaughter of Edmund Ironside, King of England.\n\nAgatha, wife of Edward the Exile, is from unknown parentage. Her antecedents are unclear and the subject of much speculation and one of the unresolved questions of medieval genealogy.\n\nStephen narrowly escaped drowning with Henry I’s son, William Adelin (Ætheling), in the sinking of the White Ship in 1120; William’s death left the succession of the English throne open to challenge.\n\nWhen news began to spread of Henry I’s death on December 1, 1135 many of the potential claimants to the throne were not well placed to respond. Geoffrey and Matilda were in Anjou, rather awkwardly supporting the rebels in their campaign against the royal army, which included a number of Matilda’s supporters such as Robert of Gloucester.\n\nMany of these barons had taken an oath to stay in Normandy until the late King was properly buried, which prevented them from returning to England. Stephen’s brother Theobald was further south still, in Blois.\n\nStephen, however, was in Boulogne, and when news reached him of Henry’s death he left for England, accompanied by his military household. Robert of Gloucester had garrisoned the ports of Dover and Canterbury and some accounts suggest that they refused Stephen access when he first arrived. Nonetheless, Stephen probably reached his own estate on the edge of London by December 8th and over the next week he began to seize power in England.\n\nThe crowds in London traditionally claimed a right to elect the King, and they proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new rights and privileges in return.\n\nHenry of Blois delivered the support of the church to Stephen: Stephen was able to advance to Winchester, where Roger, Bishop of Salisbury and Lord Chancellor, instructed the royal treasury to be handed over to Stephen.\n\nOn December 15, Henry of Blois delivered an agreement under which Stephen would grant extensive freedoms and liberties to the church, in exchange for the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Papal Legate supporting his succession to the throne. There was the slight problem of the religious oath that Stephen had taken to support the Empress Matilda, but Henry convincingly argued that the late king had been wrong to insist that his court take the oath.\n\nFurthermore, the late king had only insisted on that oath to protect the stability of the kingdom, and in light of the chaos that might now ensue, Stephen would be justified in ignoring it. Henry was also able to persuade Hugh Bigod, the late king’s royal steward, to swear that the King had changed his mind about the succession on his deathbed, nominating Stephen instead.\n\nThree weeks after the death of King Henry I of England, Stephen’s coronation was held at Westminster Abbey on December 22,1135.\n\nWith Stephen crowned King of England this led to the time period known as the Anarchy.\n\nThe Anarchy was a civil war in England and Normandy between 1135 and 1153, which resulted in a widespread breakdown in law and order. The conflict was a war of succession between King Stephen and Empress Matilda who both legally claimed the English throne.\n\nJames Francis Edward Stuart (June 10, 1688 – January 1, 1766), nicknamed the Old Pretender by Whigs, was the son of King James II-VII of England, Scotland and Ireland, and his second wife, Mary of Modena, (Maria Beatrice d’Este), the second (but eldest surviving) child of Alfonso IV, Duke of Modena, and his wife, Laura Martinozzi.\n\nKing James II-VII and his wife Mary of Modena, were both devout Roman Catholics in a Protestant country where the sovereign was also the head of the Church of England.\n\nPrince James was created Prince of Wales in July of 1688 and as first son of the reigning monarch he was automatically Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay, among other titles.\n\nThe prince’s birth was controversial and unanticipated, coming five years after his mother’s last pregnancy and three years since his father’s reign started. His mother (then aged 29) had been considered past child-bearing age, and her ten previous pregnancies has resulted in five stillbirths and five children who died in infancy.\n\nThe birth reignited controversies of religion, as the new son would be raised Catholic. Wild rumours spread among British Anglicans: that the child had died stillborn, and that the baby feted as the new prince was an impostor smuggled into the royal birth chamber in a warming pan.\n\nProtestants found it suspicious that everyone attending the birth was Catholic. Another rumour was that James II-VII had not been the father; he was said to be impotent after a bout with venereal disease years earlier. In an attempt to quash these rumours, James published the testimonies of over seventy witnesses to the birth.\n\nCenturies later, genetic testing of James Francis Edward’s descendants confirmed he was indeed a Stuart.\n\nThe line of succession to the throne was thrust into doubt. James II-VII’s eldest legitimate daughters, Princess Mary and Princess Anne, had been raised as Protestants. British Protestants had expected Mary, from his father’s first marriage, to succeed their father.\n\nThis possibility had kept Protestants somewhat content, with his rule a temporary inconvenience. Now that Mary or Anne’s succession was in doubt with this new Catholic son and heir, discontent grew, already stoked by James II-VII’s actions which had alienated Tory Anglicans who had previously been inclined to honour him as sovereign even if they differed in religion.\n\nThis movement would become the Glorious Revolution; Mary’s husband Willem of Orange landed in England, backed by an army of English and Scottish exiles, as well as Dutch soldiers. Much of the English army promptly defected to William’s cause, causing James II-VII and his family to flee rather than stay and fight.\n\nJames II-VII’s Protestant elder daughter (the prince’s half-sister) Mary II and her husband (the prince’s cousin) William III became joint monarchs of England, Scotland and Ireland. The Bill of Rights 1689 and Act of Settlement 1701 excluded Catholics such as James from the English and British thrones.\n\nPrince James Francis Edward was raised in Continental Europe and known as the Chevalier de St. George. After his father’s death on September 16, 1701, he claimed the English, Scottish and Irish crowns as James III of England and Ireland and James VIII of Scotland, with the support of his Jacobite followers and King Louis XIV of France and Navarre, a first cousin of his father.\n\nSpain, the Papal States, and Modena also recognised him as King of England, Ireland and Scotland and refused to recognise William III, Mary II, or Anne as legitimate sovereigns. As a result of his claiming his father’s lost thrones, James was attainted for treason in London on March 2, 1702, and his titles, such as Prince of Wales, were forfeited under English law.\n\nGrand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia (August 30, 1917 – April 21, 1992) was the Head of the Imperial Family of Russia, a position which he claimed from 1938 to his death. He was born 6 months after Emperor Nicholas II had abdicated.\n\nVladimir was born Prince Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia at Porvoo in the Grand Duchy of Finland, the only son of Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich and Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nPrincess Victoria Melita was a daughter of Prince Alfred of the United Kingdom (second son of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom), Duke of Edinburgh and Reigning Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Gotha and his wife Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, the fifth child and only surviving daughter of Emperor Alexander II of Russia and Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine.\n\nVladimir married Princess Leonida Georgievna Bagration-Moukhransky on August 13, 1948 in Lausanne. She was a daughter of Prince George Bagration of Mukhrani and his Polish wife Helena Sigismundovna, née Nowina Złotnicka (1886–1979). She descended patrilineally from former Kings of Georgia.\n\nHer mother’s family belonged to the untitled Polish aristocracy, although one of Leonida’s two lines of descent from Georgia’s penultimate King Erekle II (Heraclius II) is through her mother, a descendant of the king’s daughter, Princess Anastasia, who married an Eristavi prince. The other ancestral line derives through the marriage of another of the king’s daughters, Princess Tamara, to Ioane Bagrationi, 18th Prince of Mukhrani.\n\nThe Bagration family’s genealogy traces back at least to the medieval era in its male line and hundreds of years further back as rulers in the female line. Leonida’s grandfather, Prince Alexander Bagration of Mukhrani, was born in 1853 in Georgia’s historical capital Tbilisi, then part of the Russian Empire, and was killed by Bolsheviks at Pyatigorsk in 1918 during the Russian revolution.\n\nPre-revolutionary Pauline Romanov House dictated that only those born of an “equal marriage” between a Romanov dynast and a member of a “royal or sovereign house”, were included in the Imperial line of succession to the Russian throne; children of morganatic marriages were ineligible to inherit the throne or dynastic status.\n\nThe family to which Princess Leonida belonged, the Bagrationi dynasty, had been kings in Georgia from the medieval era until the early 19th century, but no male line ancestor of hers had reigned as a king in Georgia since 1505 and her branch of the Bagrations, the House of Mukhrani, had been naturalised among the non-ruling nobility of Russia after Georgia was annexed to the Russian empire in 1801.\n\nYet the royal status of the House of Bagration had been recognized by Russia in the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk and was confirmed by Vladimir Kirillovich on December 5, 1946 as claimed head of the Russian imperial house. However the last ruling Emperor of Imperial Russia, Nicholas II, had deemed marriage in this family of Princess Tatiana Constantinova in 1911, as morganatic.\n\nSome controversy therefore arises as to whether Vladimir’s marriage to Leonida was equal or morganatic, and whether his claim to the Imperial throne validly passed to his daughter Maria, to some other dynast, or to no one upon his death.\n\nFollowing Vladimir’s public designation of his daughter as “curatrix of the throne”, in anticipation that she would eventually succeed him as head of the dynasty in exile, the heads of three of the other branches of the imperial family—the Princes Vsevolod Ioannovich (Konstantinovichi), Roman Petrovich (Nikolaevichi) and Andrei Alexandrovich (Mihailovichi) — wrote to Vladimir in 1969, asserting that the dynastic status of his daughter was no different from that of their own children (Vsevolod Ioannovich was childless, but Roman Petrovich had two sons by Countess Prascovia Sheremetyev, while Andrei Alexandrovich had two sons by Donna Elisabeth Ruffo of a Russian branch of the Princes di San Sant’ Antimo) and that his wife was of no higher status than the wives of the other Romanov princes.\n\nGrand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (November 18, 1856 – January 5, 1929) was a Russian general in World War I (1914–1918).\n\nFamily\n\nA very tall man (1.98m / 6′ 6″), Grand Duke Nicholas, named after his paternal grandfather, the Emperor Nicholas I of Russia, was born as the eldest son to Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaevich of Russia (1831–1891) and Duchess Alexandra of Oldenburg (1838–1900) onNovember 18, 1856.\n\nHis father was the sixth child and third son born to Emperor Nicholas I of Russia and his Empress Consort Alexandra Fedorovna (1798–1860). Alexandra Fedorovna was born Princess Charlotte of Prussia the daughter of King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia and Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nNicholas’s mother, Duchess Alexandra of Oldenburg, his father’s first cousin’s daughter, was a daughter of Duke Constantine Peter of Oldenburg (1812–1881) and Princess Therese of Nassau (1815–1871).\n\nHis maternal grandfather, Duke Peter of Oldenburg, was a son of Duke George of Oldenburg and Grand Duchess Catherine Pavlovna of Russia, daughter of Paul I of Russia and Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg.\n\nSophie Dorothea of Württemberg was a daughter of Duke Friedrich Eugene of Württemberg and Princess Friederike of Brandenburg-Schwedt.\n\nAfter Grand Duke Paul (the future Emperor Paul I of Russia) became a widower in 1776, King Friedrich II of Prussia (Sophie Dorothea’s maternal great-uncle) and Empress Catherine II of Russia chose Sophie Dorothea as the ideal candidate to become Paul’s second wife.\n\nGrand Duke Nicholas was the first cousin once removed of Emperor Nicholas II. To distinguish between them, the Grand Duke was often known within the Imperial family as “Nikolasha”: the Grand Duke was also known as “Nicholas the Tall” while the Emperor was “Nicholas the Short”.\n\nOn April 29, 1907, Grand Duke Nicholas married Princess Anastasia of Montenegro (1869–1935), the daughter of King Nicholas I, and sister of Princess Milica, who had married Nicholas’s brother, Grand Duke Peter. They had no children. She had previously been married to George Maximilianovich, 6th Duke of Leuchtenberg, by whom she had two children, until their divorce in 1906. Since the Montenegrins were a fiercely Slavic, anti-Ottoman people from the Balkans, Anastasia reinforced the Pan-Slavic tendencies of Nicholas.\n\nRevolution\n\nThe February Revolution found Nicholas in the Caucasus. He was appointed by the Emperor, in his last official act, as the supreme commander in chief, and was wildly received as he journeyed to headquarters in Mogilev; however, within 24 hours of his arrival, the new Prime Minister, Prince Georgy Lvov, cancelled his appointment.\n\nGrand Duke Nicholas spent the next two years in Crimea, sometimes under house arrest, taking little part in politics. There appears to have been some sentiment to have him head the White Army forces active in southern Russia at the time, but the leaders in charge, especially General Anton Denikin, were afraid that a strong monarchist figurehead would alienate the more left leaning constituents of the movement. He and his wife escaped just ahead of the Red Army in April 1919, aboard the British Royal Navy battleship HMS Marlborough.\n\nOn August 8, 1922, Grand Duke Nicholas was proclaimed as Nicholas III, Emperor of all the Russias by the Zemsky Sobor of the Priamurye region in the Far East by White Army general Mikhail Diterikhs. Nicholas was already living abroad and consequently was not present. Two months later the Priamurye region fell to the Bolsheviks.\n\nIn exile\n\nAfter a stay in Genoa as a guest of his brother-in-law, Victor Emmanuel III, King of Italy, Grand Duke Nicholas and his wife took up residence in a small chateau at Choigny, 20 miles outside of Paris. He was under the protection of the French secret police as well as by a small number of faithful Cossack retainers.\n\nHe became the symbolic figurehead of an anti-Soviet Russian monarchist movement, after assuming on November 16, 1924 the supreme command of all Russian forces in exile and thus of the Russian All-Military Union, which had been founded in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes by Gen Pyotr Wrangel two months prior.\n\nThe monarchists made plans to send agents into Russia. Conversely a top priority of the Soviet secret police was to penetrate this monarchist organization and to kidnap Grand Duke Nicholas.\n\nThey were successful in the former, infiltrating the group with spies (OGPU later lured the anti-Bolshevik British master spy Sidney Reilly back to the Soviet Union (1925) where he was killed). They did not succeed however, in kidnapping Grand Duke Nicholas. As late as June 1927, the monarchists were able to set off a bomb at the Lubyanka Prison in Moscow.\n\nGrand Duke Nicholas died on January 5, 1929 of natural causes on the French Riviera, where he had gone to escape the rigors of winter. He was originally buried in the church of St. Michael the Archangel Church in Cannes, France.\n\nIn 2014 Nicholas Romanov, Prince of Russia (1922–2014) and Prince Dimitri Romanov (1926–2016) requested the transfer of his remains. The bodies of Nicholas Nikolaevich and his wife were re-buried in Moscow at the World War I memorial military cemetery in May 2015.\n\nGrand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia (October 12, 1876 – October 12, 1938) was a son of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia, a grandson of Emperor Alexander II and a first cousin of Nicholas II, Russia’s last Emperor.\n\nHe was also the uncle of Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark a daughter of Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark and Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia, (Grand Duke Vladimir’s sister and the only daughter and youngest child of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia and Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin) and a granddaughter of King George I and Queen Olga of Greece who was born a member of the Romanov dynasty, Olga was the oldest daughter of Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich and his wife, Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg.\n\nPrincess Marina married Prince George, Duke of Kent, fourth son of King George V of the United Kingdom and his wife Mary of Teck.\n\nGrand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia was born at Tsarskoye Selo, at his parents’ country residence, the Vladimir Villa. His father was Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, the third son of Emperor Alexander II of Russia. His mother was Duchess Marie Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, also known as Grand Duchesses Maria Pavlovna the Elder of Russia, who was the eldest daughter of Grand Duke Friedrich Franz II of Mecklenburg-Schwerin by his first wife, Princess Augusta Reuss of Köstritz.\n\nAs a grandson in the male line to a Russian Emperor, Kirill was titled Grand Duke. Kirill’s parents, wealthy and sophisticated, were influential figures in Russian society. Grand Duke Vladimir was cultured and a great patron of the arts, while Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna was a renowned hostess in the Imperial capital. Both had imposing personalities and left a big imprint in the lives of Kirill and his siblings.\n\nIn 1905, Kirill married his paternal first cousin, Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the third child and second daughter of Prince Alfred of the United Kingdom, Duke of Edinburgh and Reigning Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and his wife Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, the only surviving daughter of Emperor Alexander II of Russia and his wife Princess Marie of Hesse and By Rhine. Princess Victoria Melita was therefore a granddaughter of both Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Emperor Alexander II of Russia.\n\nGrand Duke Kirill and Princess Victoria Melita both defied Nicholas II by not obtaining his consent. The Russian Orthodox Church did not allow first cousins marriages unless a dispensation by the Emperor was obtained. This dispensation was not obtained. They had two daughters and settled in Paris before they were allowed to visit Russia in 1909. In 1910 they moved to Russia.\n\nThe marriage caused a scandal in the courts of European royalty as Princess Victoria was divorced from her first husband, Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig of Hesse and By Rhine, who was also her first cousin. Complicating the issue further was the fact that Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig of Hesse and By Rhine’s sister was Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna, the wife of Nicholas II.\n\nThe Empress already disliked her former sister-in-law and first cousin, being instrumental in leading the opposition to the marriage in the Russian court. She was not alone in her opposition. Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna (born Princess Dagmar of Denmark) was also appalled at the effrontery of Kirill’s marriage.\n\nShortly after Kirill’s return to Russia, the Emperor stripped Kirill of his imperial allowance and title of Imperial Highness, his honours and decorations, his position in the navy and then banished him from Russia, though he returned the style of Imperial Highness and title of Grand Duke on October 5, 1905 shortly after Kirill left Russia.\n\nIn 1908, after the death of Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich, Nicholas II restored Kirill to his rank of captain in the Imperial Russian Navy and his position as aide de camp to the Emperor. He was given back the title Grand Duke of Russia and from then on his wife was styled as Her Imperial Highness Grand Duchess Viktoria Feodorovna. From 1909–1912, Kirill served on the cruiser Oleg and was its captain in 1912. In 1913, he joined the Maritime Division of the Imperial Guard and was made Commander of the Naval Guards in 1915.\n\nIn 1918 after the Monarchy was abolished and with the death of his cousins Emperor Nicholas II and Grand Duke Michael, Grand Duke Kirill proclaimed himself to be the head of the Imperial Family of Russia and, as next in line to the throne.\n\nAfter a London court order in July 1924 recognized Grand Duke Michael to be legally dead, Kirill first declared himself “Guardian of the Throne” on August 8, 1924 and then on August 31, 1924 he assumed the title Emperor of all the Russias. By the Pauline Laws of the Russian Empire he was the heir to the throne.\n\nHowever, his claim caused division within the family; his principal rival, and the only one to reject his claim, was Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856 – 1929) , the son of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1831–1891) and his wife Duchess Alexandra of Oldenburg, and a grandson of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia. I will say more about him in tomorrow’s entry.\n\nIn 1926 at a (Russian) monarchists congress in Paris the delegates voted to recognize Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich as their leader; however, with Nicholas’s death in 1929 Kirill became the undisputed leader of the monarchists.\n\nAfter claiming the throne, Kirill became known as the “Soviet Tsar” because in the event of a restoration of the monarchy, he intended to keep some of the features of the Soviet regime. While living in exile, he was supported by some emigres who styled themselves “legitimists” underlining the “legitimacy” of Kirill’s succession. The opponents of Kirill were known as the “un-predetermined;” they believed that in the wake of the radical revolutionary events that the convening of a Zemsky Sobor was necessary in order to choose a new monarch for Russia.\n\nThe legitimists group, also known as the Mladorossi, ultimately became heavily influenced by fascism – although it distanced itself from other fascist movements. The organization began to exhibit pro-Soviet sympathies, arguing that the monarchy and the Soviet Bolshevik system could peacefully coexist (their slogan being “Emperor and the Soviets”, a socialist version of the traditional “Emperor and People” ). Kirill became more wary of the organization when he learned that its founder, Alexander Kazem-Bek, was spotted meeting with an OGPU agent. Kirill accepted Kazem-Bek’s voluntary resignation.\n\nGrand Duke Kirill worked for the restoration of the monarchy from exile for the rest of his life, but his claims were contested by some factions of the monarchists in a division that continues today.\n\nJust before he died, he wrote his autobiography, My Life in Russia’s Service – Then and Now which was published in 1939.\n\nKirill was succeeded by his son Vladimir Kirillovich who styled himself “Grand Duke and head of the Russian Imperial House.”\n\nFrom The Emperor’s Desk: Tomorrow I will delve more into the controversy surrounding the claims to the vacant Russian throne ever since the death of Emperor Nicholas II in 1918.\n\nGrand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia (August 30, 1917 – April 21, 1992) was the Head of the Imperial Family of Russia, a position which he claimed from 1938 to his death. He was born 6 months after Emperor Nicholas II had abdicated.\n\nVladimir was born Prince Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia at Porvoo in the Grand Duchy of Finland, the only son of Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich and Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nPrincess Victoria Melita was a daughter of Prince Alfred of the United Kingdom (second son of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom), Duke of Edinburgh and Reigning Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Gotha and his wife Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, the fifth child and only surviving daughter of Emperor Alexander II of Russia and Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine.\n\nVladimir’s paternal grandparents were Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia (1847 – 1909) and Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1854 – 1920).\n\nGrand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia was the son of was a son of Emperor Alexander II of Russia, a brother of Emperor Alexander III of Russia and the senior Grand Duke of the House of Romanov during the reign of his nephew, Emperor Nicholas II.\n\nDuchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin was the eldest daughter of Grand Duke Friedrich Franz II of Mecklenburg-Schwerin by his first wife, Princess Augusta Reuss of Köstritz. A prominent hostess in Saint Petersburg, she was known by many as the “grandest of the grand duchesses”.\n\nGrand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia’s nearest descent from a Russian Emperor was his great-great-grandfather Emperor Alexander II of Russia. Grand Duke Vladimir was a great-great-grandson of Emperor Alexander II via both his paternal and maternal lines.\n\nVladimir’s family had fled to Finland after the Russian Revolution of 1917. His family left Finland in 1920, moving to Coburg, Germany. On August 8, 1922 Vladimir’s father declared himself Curator of the Russian Throne. Two years later on August 31, 1924 his father went a step further and assumed the title Emperor and Autocrat of all the Russias.\n\nWith his father’s assumption of the Imperial title, Prince Vladimir was granted the title of Tsesarevich (heir apparent) and Grand Duke with the style of Imperial Highness. In 1930 his family left Germany for Saint-Briac, France where his father set up his court.\n\nIn the 1930s Vladimir lived for a period in England studying at the University of London and working at the Blackstone agricultural equipment factory in Lincolnshire. He later returned to France moving to Brittany where he became a landowner.\n\nOn the death of his father on October 12, 1938, Vladimir assumed the Headship of the Imperial Family of Russia. In 1938 there were suggestions that he would be made regent of Ukraine but he rebuffed the idea, saying he would not help dissolve Russia.\n\nVladimir married Princess Leonida Georgievna Bagration-Moukhransky on 13 August 1948 in Lausanne. Pre-revolutionary Romanov house law dictated that only those born of an “equal marriage” between a Romanov dynast and a member of a “royal or sovereign house”, were included in the Imperial line of succession to the Russian throne; children of morganatic marriages were ineligible to inherit the throne or dynastic status.\n\nThe family to which Princess Leonida belonged, the Bagrationi dynasty, had been kings in Georgia from the medieval era until the early 19th century, but no male line ancestor of hers had reigned as a king in Georgia since 1505 and her branch of the Bagrations, the House of Mukhrani, had been naturalised among the non-ruling nobility of Russia after Georgia was annexed to the Russian empire in 1801.\n\nYet the royal status of the House of Bagration had been recognized by Russia in the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk and was confirmed by Vladimir Kirillovich on December 5, 1946 as claimed head of the Russian imperial house. However the last ruling emperor of Imperial Russia Nicholas II had deemed marriage in this family of Princess Tatiana Constantinova in 1911, as morganatic.\n\nSome controversy therefore arises as to whether Vladimir’s marriage to Leonida was equal or morganatic, and whether his claim to the Imperial throne validly passed to his daughter Maria, to some other dynast, or to no one upon his death on April 21, 1992.\n\nGrand Duke Vladimir died while addressing a gathering of Spanish-speaking bankers and investors in Northern Trust Bank Miami in the United States on April 21, 1992. His body was returned to Russia and he was buried with full pomp and splendour in the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg, the first Romanov to be honoured in this way since before the revolution.\n\nThe press noted that the funeral “was regarded by civic and Russian authorities as an obligation to the Romanov family rather than a step toward restoration of the monarchy.” As he was only a great-grandson of a recognized Russian emperor, his claimed title of “Grand Duke of Russia” caused problems as to what to put on his tombstone.\n\nAfter his death, his daughter Maria Vladimirovna assumed the headship of the Imperial Family of Russia according to his branch’s interpretation of the Russian house laws. This was disputed by Nicholas Romanov, Prince of Russia who had been chosen president of the self-styled “Romanov Family Association” prior to the death of Grand Duke Vladimir."
