        "text": "by Susan Flantzer\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2022\n\nRichard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York was a claimant to the English throne, the leader of the Yorkist faction during the Wars of the Roses, the father of King Edward IV of England and King Richard III of England, and the great-grandfather of King Henry VIII of England and his sister Margaret Tudor. Through Margaret Tudor, Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York is an ancestor of the British royal family and many other European royal families.\n\nBorn on September 21, 1411, Richard was the youngest of the three children and the only surviving son of Richard of Conisbrough, 3rd Earl of Cambridge and his first wife Anne Mortimer. Both Richard’s parents were descendants of King Edward III of England. Richard’s paternal grandparents were Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York (son of King Edward III), and Isabella of Castile (daughter of King Pedro of Castile and León). His maternal grandparents were Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March (a great-grandson of King Edward III) and Eleanor Holland (a great-great-granddaughter of King Edward I of England).\n\nThe House of York, a cadet branch of the House of Plantagenet, descended from two sons of King Edward III: in the male line from Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, the fourth surviving son of Edward III and from a female line of Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, Edward III’s second surviving son. These two lines came together when Richard’s mother Anne Mortimer, a great-granddaughter of Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence married Richard’s father Richard of Conisbrough, a son of Edmund of Langley, Duke of York. (A House of York family tree can be seen at Wikipedia: House of York.)\n\nRichard had two elder siblings:\n\nIsabel of Cambridge (1409 – 1484), married (1) Sir Thomas Grey, had one son (2) Henry Bourchier, 1st Earl of Essex, had eleven children\n\nHenry of Cambridge, died in infancy\n\nRichard’s mother Anne Mortimer died shortly after his birth, due to childbirth complications. His father Richard of Conisbrough made a second marriage to Maud Clifford, the divorced wife of John Neville, 6th Baron Latimer, and daughter of Thomas de Clifford, 6th Baron de Clifford, but the couple did not have any children.\n\nIn 1414, Richard’s father Richard of Conisbrough was created 3rd Earl of Cambridge but the title came with none of the usual grants of land. As a result, Richard of Conisbrough lacked the resources to properly equip himself for King Henry V’s invasion of France. Perhaps partly for this reason, Richard of Conisbrough conspired with Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham and Sir Thomas Grey to depose King Henry V and place Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, the brother of Richard of Conisbrough’s deceased wife Anne Mortimer on the English throne. Edmund Mortimer was the great-grandson of Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, the second surviving son of King Edward III, and his claim to the throne was superior to the claim of King Henry V and his father King Henry IV (both descended from King Edward III’s third surviving son John of Gaunt,1st Duke of Lancaster) who had deposed his first cousin King Richard II. However, Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March had not been aware of the plot and when he found out about it, he told King Henry V. The three plotters, including Richard of Conisbrough, were arrested, tried, and beheaded in August 1415.\n\nWith the execution of his father, four-year-old Richard was an orphan. The title of Richard’s father was not attainted – after being condemned for a serious capital crime (felony or treason), an act of attainder deprived nobles of their titles and lands. The descendants of the attainted noble could no longer inherit his lands or income. Because his father was not attainted, four-year-old Richard inherited his father’s Earl of Cambridge title. Three months later, little Richard’s paternal uncle (his father’s elder brother) Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York was killed at the Battle of Agincourt, and Richard inherited his paternal uncle’s titles and estates. In 1425, when Richard’s maternal uncle Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March died, Richard inherited the lesser title of Earl of March but the greater estates of the Mortimer family along with their claim to the English throne. Richard of York already held a strong claim to the English throne as a male-line great-grandson of King Edward III.\n\nAfter the death of his father in 1415, the orphaned Richard became a royal ward and was placed in the household of Sir Robert Waterton, loyal to King Henry V and King Henry VI of the House of Lancaster. In 1423, Richard became the royal ward of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland who had married (his second wife) Joan Beaufort, daughter of King Edward III’s fourth son John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster and his mistress Katherine Swynford, whom he later married in 1396. Ralph Neville had eight children with his first wife and fourteen children with his second wife and so had many daughters needing husbands. As was his right Neville betrothed his youngest child, nine-year-old daughter Cecily Neville to thirteen-year-old Richard in 1424. Richard and Cecily were married by October 1429.\n\nRichard and Cecily had twelve children including two Kings of England:\n\nAnne of York (1439 – 1476), married (1) Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, had one daughter (2) Sir Thomas St. Leger, Anne died giving birth to a daughter\n\nHenry of York (born and died 1441), died in infancy\n\nEdward IV, King of England (1442 – 1483), married Elizabeth Woodville, had ten children including the ill-fated Edward V, King of England and Elizabeth of York, wife of Henry VII, King of England\n\nEdmund, Earl of Rutland (1443 – 1460), unmarried killed at the Battle of Wakefield, during the Wars of the Roses\n\nElizabeth of York (1444 – circa 1503), wife of John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk, had eleven children\n\nMargaret of York (1446 – 1503), married Charles I (the Bold), Duke of Burgundy, no children\n\nWilliam of York (born and died 1447), died in infancy\n\nJohn of York (born and died 1448), died in infancy\n\nGeorge Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence (1449 – 1478), married Isabel Neville, had four children, George was executed by his brother King Edward IV\n\nThomas of York (born and died circa 1450/1451), died in infancy\n\nRichard III, King of England (1452 – 1485), married Anne Neville, had one son Edward of Middleham, Prince of Wales who predeceased his father, Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field\n\nUrsula of York (born and died 1455), died in infancy\n\nIn 1422, 35-year-old King Henry V succumbed to dysentery, a disease that killed more soldiers than battle, leaving his nine-month-old son to inherit his throne as King Henry VI. Over the next decade, Richard was a member of the close circle around the young king, in recognition of his place in the line of succession to the English throne. Richard was third in the line of succession after John, 1st Duke of Bedford and Humphrey, 1st Duke of Gloucester, both brothers of King Henry V and paternal uncles of the young King Henry VI. Richard was knighted by John, 1st Duke of Bedford in 1426. He was present for King Henry VI’s coronation at Westminster Abbey in 1429. Richard came of age in 1432 and was granted full control of his estates. In 1433, he was created a Knight of the Garter.\n\nAfter the deaths of John, 1st Duke of Bedford in 1435 and Humphrey, 1st Duke of Gloucester in 1447, who were both childless, Richard, 3rd Duke of York was the heir to the English throne. In 1436, Richard was appointed to succeed John, 1st Duke of Bedford as commander of the English forces in France during the Hundred Years’ War. In 1445, King Henry VI married Margaret of Anjou, the niece of King Charles VII of France. Henry VI and Margaret had one child, born eight years after their marriage, Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales. Edward was the heir to the throne, followed by Richard, 3rd Duke of York.\n\nShortly before his son was born, King Henry VI had some kind of mental breakdown. He was unable to recognize or respond to people for over a year. These attacks may have been hereditary. Henry’s maternal grandfather King Charles VI of France suffered from similar attacks, even thinking he was made of glass. Sometimes Henry VI also had hallucinations which makes some modern medical experts think he may have had a form of schizophrenia. Porphyria, which may have afflicted King George III, has also been suggested as a possible cause. During Henry’s incapacity, Richard, 3rd Duke of York and the next in line to the throne after Henry’s son, governed as Lord Protector. Richard often quarreled with the Lancastrians at court. In 1448, he assumed the surname Plantagenet and then assumed the leadership of the Yorkist faction in 1450.\n\nEven before the birth of Henry VI’s son, factions were forming and the seeds of the Wars of the Roses were being planted. There were differing opinions over how England should conduct the Hundred Years’ War with France. By the early 1450s, the most important rivalry was between Richard, 3rd Duke of York and Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset. Richard argued for a more vigorous approach to the war to recover territories lost to the French. The Duke of Somerset was among those who believed there should be attempts to secure peace by making concessions.\n\nRichard, 3rd Duke of York and Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset also came from two rival cadet branches of the House of Plantagenet. In 1399, Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster, the eldest legitimate son of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster (the third surviving son of King Edward III), deposed his first cousin King Richard II, the son of King Edward III’s eldest son Edward (Prince of Wales) the Black Prince. Henry Bolingbroke became King Henry IV, the first of three kings (along with Henry V and Henry VI) from the House of Lancaster. This bypassed the descendants of King Edward III’s second son Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, with Richard, 3rd Duke of York of the House of York being the current heir of Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence. Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset was a member of the House of Lancaster. He was the grandson of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster and his mistress Katherine Swynford, who John of Gaunt eventually married. Originally illegitimate, the Beauforts had been made legitimate by an Act of Parliament but were supposedly barred from the line of succession to the throne. However, there was always the possibility that this could be circumvented. See a family tree, Wikipedia: Family connections and the Wars of the Roses.)\n\nKing Henry VI was more interested in religion and learning than in military matters. His wife Margaret was an intelligent, energetic woman and realized that she would have to take on most of her husband’s duties, and so it was Margaret who took over the military reins and aligned herself with Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset. Margaret believed her husband was threatened with being deposed by Richard, 3rd Duke of York who thought he had a better claim to the throne and would be a better king than Henry VI. After Henry VI’s recovery in 1455, Richard was dismissed from his position of Lord Protector, and Margaret and Edward Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset became all-powerful. Eventually, things came to a head between Henry VI’s House of Lancaster and Richard’s House of York, and war broke out.\n\nAt the First Battle of St. Albans on May 22, 1455, Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset was killed. Afterward, there was a peace of sorts, but hostilities started again four years later. On July 10, 1460, King Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton and forced to recognize Richard, 3rd Duke of York as his heir instead of his own son.\n\nIn December 1460, Richard, 3rd Duke of York rode to own fortress of Sandal Castle near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England. He planned to spend a comfortable Christmas among his own people. Richard settled down to wait for his eldest son Edward, Earl of March (the future King Edward IV) to arrive from Shrewsbury with reinforcements before engaging with the Lancastrians. Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset and Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, leading the Lancastrian army would have liked to besiege Richard at Sandal Castle but they lacked the resources to conduct a siege. They decided that Richard must somehow be lured out of the castle and made to fight before his son Edward arrived with reinforcements. The Lancastrian army available consisted of 20,000 men while the Yorkist army had only 12,000 men.\n\nJohn Neville, Baron Neville, who had grown up with Richard as he was the eldest son of Richard’s guardian Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, arrived at Sandal Castle with 8,000 men but he deserted to the Lancastrians. Even after this, Richard seriously underestimated the size of the Lancastrian army. As December drew to a close, the discipline of the York army was lax. Many York men were allowed to leave the castle precincts to forage for food, signaling to the Lancastrians that there were supply issues. The York scouts were incompetent as they failed to discover the Lancastrians’ plans.\n\nAround Christmas Day, Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset had a meeting with Richard during which it was agreed that there should be a truce until after the Epiphany (January 6) – but the Lancastrians did not intend to keep the truce. For three days, a Lancastrian herald was sent to Richard with orders to provoke insult him with insults into attacking. On December 29, 1460, the Lancastrians disguised 400 men as Yorkist reinforcements and sent them to join the army at Sandal Castle.\n\nOn December 30, 1460, Richard left Sandal Castle. It is not sure why Richard left the safety of the castle. Perhaps a combination of thinking the disguised Lancastrians were Yorkists or planned Richard to lead his men on a foraging expedition. The Yorkists marched towards the Lancastrians located to the north of the castle. As the Yorkists engaged the Lancastrians to their front, others attacked them from the flank and rear, cutting them off from the castle. Richard had no idea that the Lancastrian army was so near or that his army was so outnumbered.\n\nRichard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York was pulled down from his horse and killed. Richard’s second son, 17-year-old Edmund, Earl of Rutland had been fighting with him. Edmund attempted to escape over Wakefield Bridge but was overtaken and killed, possibly by the Lancastrian John Clifford, 9th Baron Clifford to avenge his father’s death at the First Battle of St Albans. After the battle was over, some Lancasterian soldiers retrieved Richard’s body, propped it up, and crowned it with a garland of reeds. They then pretended to bow and said, “Hail king without a kingdom!” Lord Clifford ordered the corpses of Richard and his son Edmund to be decapitated and ordered a paper crown to be placed on Richard’s head. The heads of Richard and Edmund were then displayed on pikes over Micklegate Bar, the main entrance of the city of York. The bodies of Richard and Edmund were quietly buried at Pontefract Castle in Pontefract, Yorkshire, England.\n\nRichard’s eldest son Edward was now the leader of the Yorkist faction. On February 3, 1461, Edward defeated the Lancastrian army at the Battle of Mortimer’s Cross. Edward then took a bold step and declared himself king on March 4, 1461. His decisive victory over the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton on March 29, 1461, cemented his status as King of England. He was crowned at Westminster Abbey on June 29, 1461. However, the former king, Henry VI, still lived and fled to Scotland. There were back and forth reigns of King Edward IV and King Henry VI. Edward IV reigned from 1461 – 1470 and Henry VI reigned from 1470 -1471. The final decisive Yorkist victory was at the Battle of Tewkesbury on May 4, 1471, where Henry VI’s son Edward, Prince of Wales was killed. Henry VI was returned to the Tower of London and died on May 21, 1471, probably murdered on orders from Edward IV. Edward IV reigned until his death in 1483.\n\nOn July 30, 1476, during the reign of Richard’s son King Edward IV, the remains of Richard and Edmund were reinterred at the Church of Saint Mary and All Saints in Fotheringhay, Northamptonshire, England in a grand ceremony attended by Richard’s sons King Edward IV, George, Duke of Clarence, and Richard, Duke of Gloucester (the future King Richard III) and many noblemen. Thomas Whiting, Chester Herald of Arms in Ordinary, has left a detailed account of the events.\n\nAt the entrance to the churchyard, King Edward waited, together with the Duke of Clarence, the Marquis of Dorset, Earl Rivers, Lord Hastings and other noblemen. Upon its arrival the King ‘made obeisance to the body right humbly and put his hand on the body and kissed it, crying all the time.’ The procession moved into the church where two hearses were waiting, one in the choir for the body of the Duke and one in the Lady Chapel for that of the Earl of Rutland, and after the King had retired to his ‘closet’ and the princes and officers of arms had stationed themselves around the hearses, masses were sung and the King’s chamberlain offered for him seven pieces of cloth of gold ‘which were laid in a cross on the body.’ The next day three masses were sung, the Bishop of Lincoln preached a ‘very noble sermon’ and offerings were made by the Duke of Gloucester and other lords, of ‘The Duke of York’s coat of arms, of his shield, his sword, his helmet and his coursers on which rode Lord Ferrers in full armour, holding in his hand an axe reversed.’\n\nWhen Richard’s wife Cecily Neville, Duchess of York died in 1495, she was interred next to her husband as her will directed. After the choir of the Church of Saint Mary and All Saints was destroyed during the Reformation, Queen Elizabeth I ordered the removal of the smashed York tombs and then created the present York tombs. Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and his wife Cecily were the great-great-great-grandparents of Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nThe Beaufort line eventually did produce a King of England. On August 22, 1485, at the Battle of Bosworth Field, the last significant battle of the Wars of the Roses, the last king of the House of York and the Plantagenet dynasty, King Richard III of England, the youngest son of Richard, 3rd Duke of York, lost his life and his crown. The battle was a decisive victory for the House of Lancaster, whose leader 28-year-old Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, became the first monarch of the House of Tudor as King Henry VII. Henry VII was a great-great-great-grandson of Edward III, King of England through the line of John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, the eldest child of John of Gaunt (son of King Edward III) and his mistress Katherine Swynford who he later married.\n\nThe bloodline of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York remains alive among European royalty. His granddaughter Elizabeth of York, the daughter of his son Edward IV, King of England, married King Henry VII, the first Tudor monarch. Through their daughter Margaret Tudor, Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York is an ancestor of the British royal family and many other European royal families.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He was the youngest of the seven children and the fourth but the third surviving of the four sons of João IV, King of Portugal and Luisa de Guzmán y Sandoval. Catherine of Braganza who married Charles II, King of England and King of Scots, was Pedro’s sister. His paternal grandparents were the Portuguese nobleman Teodósio II, 7th Duke of Braganza and the Spanish noblewoman Ana de Velasco y Téllez-Girón. Pedro’s maternal grandparents were the Spanish nobles Juan Manuel Pérez de Guzmán y Silva, 8th Duke of Medina Sidonia and Juana Lorenza Gomez de Sandoval y de la Cerda.\n\nPedro had six elder siblings:\n\nTeodósio, Prince of Brazil, Duke of Braganza (1634 – 1653), died at age 19 due to tuberculosis\n\nAna of Braganza (born and died 1635), died at birth\n\nJoana of Braganza, Princess of Beira (1635 – 1653), died in her teens\n\nCatherine of Braganza, Queen of England, Queen of Scots (1638 – 1705), married Charles II, King of England, King of Scots, no children, had at least three miscarriages\n\nManuel of Portugal (born and died 1640), died at birth\n\nAfonso VI, King of Portugal (1643 – 1683), married Maria Francisca of Savoy, no children\n\nPedro’s eldest brother Teodósio was the heir to the throne. However, on May 13, 1653, Teodósio died at age 19 due to tuberculosis and Pedro’s brother Afonso became heir to the throne of Portugal. When Afonso was about three years old, he had a “malignant fever” that affected the right side of his body and left him physically and mentally challenged. Today, it is suspected that he had a disease of the central nervous system, perhaps meningoencephalitis. Meningoencephalitis can cause permanent neurological damage including memory difficulty, learning disabilities, brain damage, and gait problems, and Afonso appears to have had those issues. As he was the second son and was also mentally challenged, Afonso was not prepared to be king.\n\nWhen Pedro was eight years old, his father João IV, King of Portugal died on November 6, 1656, and his thirteen-year-old brother succeeded as Alfonso VI, King of Portugal. João IV had appointed his wife Luisa as the regent during the minority of their son Afonso VI. Luisa remained in power until 1662, when Afonso, with the help of his favorite Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor, assumed power. Afonso appointed Castelo Melhor his escrivão da puridade (scribe of purity), a position that enabled Castelo Melhor to exercise the functions of a prime minister and control the Kingdom of Portugal. The Portuguese government was split between a pro-French faction led by Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor, and a pro-English faction led by Afonso’s brother Pedro. In 1662, Afonso and Pedro’s sister Catherine had married King Charles II of England. Castelo Melhor and King Louis XIV of France saw a French marriage for Afonso as a way to offset his sister’s English marriage.\n\nIn 1666, Afonso married Marie Françoise of Savoy, daughter of French military leader Charles Amadeus of Savoy, Duke of Nemours, and Élisabeth de Bourbon-Vendôme, a granddaughter of King Henri IV of France and his mistress Gabrielle d’Estrées. Problems with the marriage began to occur immediately after the wedding ceremony. Afonso left the wedding celebrations early and showed no interest in consummating the marriage. Maria Francisca wanted to serve the French interests but she also wanted power. She soon discovered Afonso was controlled by Castelo Melhor who had no intention of sharing power. This caused her to cooperate with her brother-in-law Pedro and his pro-English faction, and then most likely, she began an affair with Pedro. Maria Francisca persuaded her first cousin once removed King Louis XIV of France that supporting Pedro was a better way to further French interests.\n\nIn 1668, after a palace coup led by Pedro and Maria Francisca, Afonso VI was forced to dismiss Castelo Melhor who went into exile and was not permitted to return to Portugal until 1685. Pedro assumed the role of Prince Regent. Afonso VI was sent to Terceira Island in the Azores. In 1673, a conspiracy to restore Afonso to the throne was discovered and squelched. A decision was made to return Afonso to Lisbon where he could be better monitored. Afonso was taken to the Palace of Sintra in Lisbon, and for the rest of his life, he lived there, under guard and shut up in his quarters. While Pedro never formally usurped the throne, Afonso was king in name only for the rest of his life. Maria Francisca retired temporarily to a convent and asked the Roman Catholic Church to annul her marriage on the grounds of non-consummation. This was approved by her uncle Louis de Bourbon, Cardinal Vendôme. Maria Francisca and Pedro were married on April 2, 1668, after receiving a papal bull authorizing the marriage.\n\nPedro and Maria Francisca had one daughter:\n\nIsabel Luísa of Braganza, Princess of Beira (1669 – 1690), unmarried\n\nAs Prince Regent, Pedro ensured Portugal’s independence with the Treaty of Lisbon in 1668, formally ending the Portuguese Restoration War with Spain. He formed an alliance with England based on clauses in the marriage contract of his sister Catherine of Braganza who had married King Charles II of England in 1661.\n\nOn September 12, 1683, 40-year-old Afonso VI, King of Portugal suffered a stroke and died later the same day. His brother succeeded him as Pedro II, King of Portugal, and Maria Francisca was Queen of Portugal for a second time. However, her second time as Queen of Portugal would be short. On December 27, 1683, 37-year-old Maria Francisca died at Palhavã Palace in Lisbon, Portugal, just three months after the death of her first husband Afonso.\n\nPortugal had a succession crisis. Isabel Luísa of Braganza, Princess of Beira, Pedro II’s only child and his heir presumptive, was not married. Because of her sickly nature and the Law of the Cortes of Lamego that prevented the marriage of an heiress to a foreign prince, all marriage possibilities failed. Pedro knew he had to marry again to provide for the succession. In a proxy marriage on July 2, 1687, in Heidelberg, Electorate of the Palatinate, now in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, 39-year-old Pedro II married 21-year-old Maria Sophia of Neuburg, the daughter of Philipp Wilhelm, Elector of the Palatinate, Count Palatine of Neuburg, Duke of Jülich and Berg and his second wife Elisabeth Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt. Marie Sophia was chosen as Pedro’s second wife because of her family’s reputation for producing fertile women. Maria Sophia arrived in Lisbon, Portugal on August 12, 1687, and on the same day, Pedro and Maria Sophia were formally married at Ribeira Palace.\n\nPedro and Maria Sophia had eight children. Only their eldest surviving child João V, King of Portugal married and had children although some of their sons had illegitimate children. Isabel Luísa, Pedro’s daughter by Maria Francisca, remained the heir presumptive to the throne of Portugal until 1689 when her half-brother, the future João V, King of Portugal was born. A year later, Isabel Luísa died from smallpox at the age of twenty-one.\n\nPedro and Maria Sophia’s children:\n\nInfante João, Prince of Brazil (born and died 1688), died in infancy\n\nJoão V, King of Portugal (1689 – 1750), married Maria Anna of Austria, had six children\n\nInfante Francisco of Portugal, Duke of Beja (1691 – 1742), unmarried\n\nInfanta Francisca Xaviera of Portugal (born and died 1694), died in infancy\n\nInfante António of Portugal (1695 – 1757), unmarried\n\nInfanta Teresa Maria of Portugal (1696 – 1704), died in childhood\n\nInfante Manuel of Portugal, Count of Ourém (1697 – 1766), unmarried\n\nInfanta Francisca Josefa of Portugal (1699 – 1736), unmarried\n\nSadly, Pedro II became a widower for a second time. On August 4, 1699, 32-year-old Maria Sophia died at Ribeira Palace in Lisbon, Portugal from erysipelas, a bacterial infection of the skin that can spread to other areas of the body through the bloodstream. Pedro survived Maria Sophia by seven years. On December 5, 1706, he had a seizure that resulted in a stroke. Pedro II, King of Portugal died on December 9, 1706, aged 58, at Palhavã Palace in Lisbon, Portugal. He was succeeded by his 17-year-old son João V, King of Portugal. Pedro was interred at the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza at the Monastery of São Vicente de Fora in Lisbon.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Born Marie Françoise Élisabeth of Savoy, on June 21, 1646, at the Hôtel de Nemours in Paris, France, she was the second of the five children and the second of the two daughters of Charles Amadeus of Savoy, Duke of Nemours and Élisabeth de Bourbon, Mademoiselle de Vendôme. Maria Francisca’s paternal grandparents were Henri of Savoy, Duke of Nemours and Anne of Lorraine, Duchess of Aumale in her own right. Her maternal grandparents were César de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme (the legitimized son of King Henri IV of France and his mistress Gabrielle d’Estrées) and Françoise of Lorraine. Maria Francisca was a first cousin once removed of Louis XIV, King of France.\n\nMaria Francisca had only one surviving sibling. Her three younger brothers all died in infancy.\n\nMarie Jeanne of Savoy, Mademoiselle de Nemours (1644 – 1724), married Carlo Emanuele II, Duke of Savoy, had one son Vittorio Amedeo II, King of Sardinia\n\nJoseph of Savoy (born and died 1649)\n\nFrançois of Savoy (born and died 1650)\n\nCharles Amadeus of Savoy (born and died 1651)\n\nMaria Francisca’s father Charles Amadeus of Savoy, Duke of Nemours was a French military leader. On July 30, 1652, Charles Amadeus was killed, aged twenty-eight, in a duel by his brother-in-law François de Vendôme, Duke of Beaufort. The two men disagreed about Charles Amadeus’ mistress Élisabeth-Angélique de Coligny, Duchess of Châtillon (link in French). Maria Francisca was only six years old when her father was killed. Her widowed mother devoted herself to the education of her two daughters, supported by her own mother.\n\nIn 1666, in Portugal, 23-year-old King Afonso VI sat upon the throne. Debilitated mentally and physically due to the effects of a disease he contracted in childhood, he was controlled by his favorite Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor who had manipulated himself into a position that gave him the power of a prime minister. The Portuguese government was split between a pro-French faction led by Castelo Melhor, and a pro-English faction led by Afonso’s brother Pedro. In 1662, Afonso’s sister Catherine of Braganza married King Charles II of England. Castelo Melhor and King Louis XIV of France saw a French marriage for Afonso as a way to offset his sister’s English marriage with Marie Françoise of Savoy being chosen as the bride.\n\nMarie Françoise of Savoy arrived in Portugal on August 2, 1666. The wedding took place the same day and Marie Françoise became known as Maria Francisca. Problems with the marriage began to occur immediately after the wedding ceremony. Afonso left the wedding celebrations early and showed no interest in consummating the marriage. Maria Francisca was intelligent and wanted to serve the French interests but she also wanted power. She soon discovered Afonso was controlled by Castelo Melhor who had no intention of sharing power. This caused her to cooperate with her brother-in-law Pedro and his pro-English faction and then she began an affair with him. Maria Francisca persuaded her first cousin once removed King Louis XIV of France that supporting Pedro was a better way to further French interests.\n\nSoon Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor and his pro-France faction were losing ground to Pedro, Maria Francisca, and their pro-English faction. After a palace coup led by Pedro and Maria Francisca, Afonso VI was forced to dismiss Castelo Melhor who went into exile and was not permitted to return to Portugal until 1685. Pedro assumed the role of Prince Regent in 1668. While Pedro never formally usurped the throne, Afonso was king in name only for the rest of his life.

She was the heir presumptive to the throne of Portugal, from her birth in 1669 until 1689 when her half-brother, the future João V, King of Portugal, the son of Pedro II’s second wife Maria Sophia of Neuburg, was born. Although Isabel Luísa had several prospective grooms, no marriage materialized. She died from smallpox at the age of twenty-one.\n\nIsabel Luísa of Braganza, Princess of Beira (1669 – 1690), unmarried\n\nAs for Afonso VI, he was exiled to Terceira Island in the Azores. In 1673, a conspiracy to restore Afonso to the throne was discovered and squelched. A decision was made to return Afonso to Lisbon where he could be better monitored. Afonso arrived in Lisbon on September 14, 1674, and was taken to the Palace of Sintra in Lisbon, where he lived for the rest of his life, under guard and shut up in his quarters. On September 12, 1683, 40-year-old Afonso suffered a stroke and died later the same day.\n\nAfonso’s brother succeeded him as Pedro II, King of Portugal, and Maria Francisca was Queen of Portugal for a second time. However, her second time as Queen of Portugal would be short. Maria Francisca was seriously ill with dropsy, now called edema, the build-up of fluid in the body’s tissue. There are many underlying causes of dropsy including heart failure, kidney problems, low protein levels, liver problems, deep vein thrombosis, and infections. On December 27, 1683, 37-year-old Maria Francisca died at Palhavã Palace in Lisbon, Portugal, just three months after the death of her first husband Afonso. Maria Francisca was initially buried in the Convento das Francesinhas (Convent of the Little French Nuns) in Lisbon, Portugal, which she had founded in 1667. In 1912, her remains were transferred to the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza at the Monastery of São Vicente de Fora in Lisbon.\n\nFour years after Maria Francisca’s death, Pedro II, King of Portugal married Maria Sophia of Neuburg. The couple had eight children including Pedro II’s successor João V, King of Portugal. Pedro II survived Maria Francisca by twenty-three years, dying on December 9, 1706, at Palhavã Palace in Lisbon, Portugal at the age of fifty-eight.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He was the sixth of the seven children and the third but the second surviving of the four sons of João IV, King of Portugal and Luisa de Guzmán y Sandoval. Catherine of Braganza who married Charles II, King of England and King of Scots, was Afonso’s sister. His paternal grandparents were the Portuguese nobleman Teodósio II, 7th Duke of Braganza and the Spanish noblewoman Ana de Velasco y Téllez-Girón. Afonso’s maternal grandparents were the Spanish nobles Juan Manuel Pérez de Guzmán y Silva, 8th Duke of Medina Sidonia and Juana Lorenza Gomez de Sandoval y de la Cerda.\n\nAfonso had six siblings:\n\nTeodósio, Prince of Brazil, Duke of Braganza (1634 – 1653), died at age 19 due to tuberculosis\n\nAna of Braganza (born and died 1635), died at birth\n\nJoana of Braganza, Princess of Beira (1635 – 1653), died in her teens\n\nCatherine of Braganza, Queen of England, Queen of Scots (1638 – 1705), married Charles II, King of England, King of Scots, no children, had at least three miscarriages\n\nManuel of Portugal (born and died 1640), died at birth\n\nPedro II, King of Portugal (1648 – 1706), married (1) Maria Francisca of Savoy, had one daughter (2) married Maria Sophia of Neuburg, had eight children\n\nAt the time of his birth, Afonso was second in the line of succession to the Portuguese throne after his brother Teodósio who was nine years older. When Afonso was about three years old, he had a “malignant fever” that affected the right side of his body and left him physically and mentally challenged. Today, it is suspected that he had a disease of the central nervous system, perhaps meningoencephalitis. Meningoencephalitis can cause permanent neurological damage including memory difficulty, learning disabilities, brain damage, and gait problems, and Afonso appears to have had those issues. As he was the second son and was also mentally challenged, Afonso was not prepared to be king. However, on May 13, 1653, Afonso’s eldest brother Teodósio died at age 19 due to tuberculosis and Afonso became heir to the throne of Portugal.\n\nAfonso’s father João IV, King of Portugal died on November 6, 1656, aged 52. Afonso was only thirteen years old when he succeeded his father. João IV had appointed his wife Luisa as the regent during the minority of their son Afonso VI. During her years as Regent of Portugal, Luisa defended the independence of Portugal and was responsible for the diplomatic success of the new alliance with England which included the marriage of her daughter Catherine to Charles II, King of England and King of Scots.\n\nLuisa appointed Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor as one of Afonso’s gentlemen of the bedchamber. However, this appointment would work against Luisa and ultimately remove her from her power position. Because Afonso was physically and mentally challenged, his mother Luisa wanted to continue as regent after he reached the age of majority in November 1662. However, shortly after Afonso VI reached the age of majority, Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor, who was seven years older than Afonso, saw an opportunity to gain power. Becoming Afonso’s favorite, Castelo Melhor convinced Afonso that his mother Luisa was planning to steal his throne and exile him from Portugal, although there was no evidence that this was true. As a result, Afonso took control of the throne and appointed Castelo Melhor his escrivão da puridade (scribe of purity), a position that enabled Castelo Melhor to exercise the functions of a prime minister. Luisa remained in the palace until March 1663, when she retired to the Discalced Carmelite convent in Xabregas, Lisbon, Portugal. She died there three years later.\n\nThe Portuguese government was split between a pro-French faction led by Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor, and a pro-English faction led by Afonso’s brother Pedro. In 1662, Afonso’s sister Catherine had married King Charles II of England. Castelo Melhor and King Louis XIV of France saw a French marriage for Afonso as a way to offset his sister’s English marriage.\n\nThe chosen bride for Afonso was Marie Françoise of Savoy, daughter of French military leader Charles Amadeus of Savoy, Duke of Nemours, and Élisabeth de Bourbon-Vendôme, a granddaughter of King Henri IV of France and his mistress Gabrielle d’Estrées. Marie Françoise of Savoy arrived in Portugal on August 2, 1666. The wedding took place the same day and Marie Françoise became known as Maria Francisca. Problems with the marriage began to occur immediately after the wedding ceremony. Afonso left the wedding celebrations early and showed no interest in consummating the marriage. Maria Francisca was intelligent and wanted to serve the French interests but she also wanted power. She soon discovered Afonso was controlled by Castelo Melhor who had no intention of sharing power. This caused her to cooperate with her brother-in-law Pedro and his pro-English faction, and then most likely, she begin an affair with him. Maria Francisca persuaded King Louis XIV of France that supporting Pedro was a better way to further French interests.\n\nSoon Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor and his pro-France faction were losing ground to Pedro, Maria Francisca, and their pro-English faction. After a palace coup led by Pedro and Maria Francisca, Afonso VI was forced to dismiss Castelo Melhor who went into exile and was not permitted to return to Portugal until 1685. Pedro assumed the role of Prince Regent in 1668. While Pedro never formally usurped the throne, Afonso was king in name only for the rest of his life. Maria Francisca retired temporarily to a convent and asked the Roman Catholic Church to annul her marriage on the grounds of non-consummation. This was approved by her uncle Louis de Bourbon, Cardinal Vendôme. Maria Francisca and Pedro were married on April 2, 1668, after receiving a papal bull authorizing the marriage.\n\nAfonso was exiled to Terceira Island in the Azores. In 1673, a conspiracy to restore Afonso to the throne was discovered and squelched. A decision was made to return Afonso to Lisbon where he could be better monitored. Afonso arrived in Lisbon on September 14, 1674, and was taken to the Palace of Sintra in Lisbon. For the rest of his life, he lived there, under guard and shut up in his quarters.\n\nOn September 12, 1683, 40-year-old Afonso suffered a stroke and died later the same day. He was interred in the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza, the burial site for members of the House of Braganza, at the Monastery of São Vicente de Fora in Lisbon, Portugal. Afonso’s brother succeeded him as Pedro II, King of Portugal, and Maria Francisca was Queen of Portugal for a second time.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

She was also the mother of Catherine of Braganza, the wife of Charles II, King of England and King of Scots. Luisa María Francisca de Guzmán y Sandoval was born on October 13, 1613 at the Castle of San Pedro de Huelva, the seat of the powerful Spanish House of Medina Sidonia, in Huelva, Andalucía, Spain. She was the only daughter of Manuel Pérez de Guzmán y Silva, 8th Duke of Medina Sidonia and Juana Lorenza Gomez de Sandoval y de la Cerda (died 1624). Luisa’s paternal grandparents were Alonso Pérez de Guzmán, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia, the commander-in-chief of the ill-fated Spanish Armada, and Ana Gomez de Silva y de Mendoza, daughter of Ana de Mendoza de la Cerda y de Silva Cifuentes, Princess of Eboli, Duchess of Pastran. Her maternal grandparents were Francisco de Sandoval y Rojas, 1st Duke of Lerma, a powerful favorite of King Felipe III of Spain, and Catalina de la Cerda y Portugal. Luisa was descended from the Kings of Portugal through both her mother and her father. She was also a descendant of Ferdinand II, King of Aragon through one of his illegitimate children and Pope Alexander VI, born Rodrigo Borgia, via one of his many mistresses.\n\nLuisa had four brothers:\n\nGaspar de Guzmán y Sandoval, 9th Duke of Medina Sidonia (1602 – 1664), married (1) Ana de Guzmán y Silva, had four children (2) Juana Fernández de Córdoba y Enríquez de Ribera, had two children\n\nMelchor de Guzmán y Sandoval (? – 1639), married Luisa Josefa Manrique de Zúñiga, 3rd Marquesa of Villamanrique, had two children\n\nAlonso de Guzmán y Sandoval (born circa 1611 – ?)\n\nJuan de Guzmán y Sandoval (born circa 1612 – ?)\n\nIn 1580, the throne of Portugal was taken by the Spanish Habsburgs. In 1578, King Sebastian of Portugal from the House of Aviz was killed in battle without any heirs, causing a succession crisis. He was succeeded by his elderly great-uncle Henrique who was a Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church and had no descendants because he had taken a vow of chastity as a priest. When Cardinal-King Enrique died two years later, three grandchildren of Manuel I, King of Portugal (1469 – 1521) claimed the Portuguese throne: King Felipe II of Spain (the son of Manuel I’s daughter Isabella of Portugal, Holy Roman Empress), António, Prior of Crato (the son of Manuel I’s son Luis, Duke of Beja), and João’s grandmother Catarina, Duchess of Braganza (the daughter of Manuel I’s son Duarte, Duke of Guimarães and the grandmother of Luisa’s husband João IV, King of Portugal). Ultimately, the grandchild who was successful in his claim was Felipe II, King of Spain. The Iberian Union was the union of the Kingdom of Spain and the Kingdom of Portugal that existed between 1580 and 1640, under the Spanish Habsburg kings Felipe II, Felipe III, and Felipe IV who reigned as Filipe I, Filipe II, and Filipe III of Portugal.\n\nFelipe IV, King of Spain (also Filipe III, King of Portugal) had a plan to incorporate Portugal into the Kingdom of Spain. Part of the plan was to carry out a Spanish-Portuguese marriage policy to confuse and unify the nobles of Spain and Portugal. The marriage of the Spanish Luisa de Guzmán and the Portuguese João Braganza, 8th Duke of Braganza came as an opportunity not to be missed. By bringing together two important ducal houses, one from Spain and the other from Portugal, the Spanish government hoped to prevent a Portuguese uprising against Spain.\n\nOn January 12, 1633, Luisa married João Braganza, 8th Duke of Braganza.\n\nLuisa and João had seven children:\n\nTeodósio, Prince of Brazil, Duke of Braganza (1634 – 1653), died at age 19 due to tuberculosis\n\nAna of Braganza (born and died 1635), died at birth\n\nJoana of Braganza, Princess of Beira (1635 – 1653), died in her teens\n\nCatherine of Braganza, Queen of England, Queen of Scots (1638 – 1705), married Charles II, King of England, King of Scots, no children, had at least three miscarriages\n\nManuel of Portugal (born and died 1640), died at birth\n\nAfonso VI, King of Portugal (1643 – 1683), married Maria Francisca of Savoy, no children -Afonso was physically and mentally challenged. In 1668, his brother Pedro had Afonso declared incapacitated. Pedro became Regent of Portugal, annulled Afonso’s marriage, and married Afonso’s former wife Maria Francisca of Savoy. Afonso spent the rest of his reign basically as a prisoner.\n\nPedro II, King of Portugal (1648 – 1706), married (1) Maria Francisca of Savoy, had one daughter (2) married Maria Sophia of Neuburg, had eight children\n\nSpain’s plan to prevent a Portuguese uprising through Luisa and João’s marriage did not work. By 1640, taxes on Portuguese merchants had increased. Portuguese nobles began to lose their influence as government posts in Portugal were increasingly given to Spaniards. They soon realized that if Portugal became part of the Kingdom of Spain, they stood to lose all their power. Luisa was ambitious by nature, and despite being Spanish, she supported a rebellion against Spain, saying to her husband, “Rather Queen for a day than Duchess all my life.”\n\nThis situation eventually caused a rebellion organized by the Forty Conspirators, a Portuguese nationalist group composed of forty men of the Portuguese nobility. On December 1, 1640, taking advantage that Spanish troops were fighting in the Thirty Years’ War and dealing with a revolution in the Catalonia region of Spain, the Forty Conspirators’ plot unfolded. Secretary of State Miguel de Vasconcelos was killed. Filipe III’s cousin Margaret of Savoy, the Habsburg Vicereine of Portugal who ruled in Filipe III’s place, was arrested. Within a few hours, Luisa’s husband João was proclaimed João IV, King of Portugal, claiming legitimate succession through his grandmother Catarina, Duchess of Braganza, and she was Queen of Portugal.\n\nAfter she became Queen of Portugal, Luisa settled at the Ribeira Palace in Lisbon. She oversaw her children’s education but she also took an active part in Portuguese politics. She supported her husband’s policies during the Portuguese Restoration War (1640 – 1648), periodic skirmishes between Portugal and Spain that lasted into the reign of João IV’s son, and ended with Spain’s official recognition of Portugal’s independence in 1648. After the Revolt of 1641 and the attempted assassination of João IV on August 29, 1641, Luisa supported the execution of the conspirators. Luisa acted as the regent whenever João needed to leave Lisbon.\n\nJoão IV, King of Portugal died on November 6, 1656, aged 52, at Ribeira Palace in Lisbon, Portugal. He had suffered from gout and its side effects since 1648. In his will, João IV had appointed Luisa as the regent during the minority of their son Afonso VI who became King of Portugal at the age of thirteen. During her years as Regent of Portugal, Luisa defended the independence of Portugal and was responsible for the diplomatic success of the new alliance with England which included the marriage of her daughter Catherine to Charles II, King of England and King of Scots.\n\nBecause Afonso VI was physically and mentally challenged, his mother Luisa wanted to continue as regent after he reached the age of majority in November 1662. However, shortly after Afonso VI reached the age of majority, 26-year-old Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor saw an opportunity to gain power at court by befriending the mentally unstable king. Becoming Afonso’s favorite, Castelo Melhor convinced Afonso that his mother Luisa was planning to steal his throne and exile him from Portugal, although there was no evidence that this was true. As a result, Afonso took control of the throne and appointed Castelo Melhor his escrivão da puridade (scribe of purity), a position that enabled Castelo Melhor to exercise the functions of a prime minister. Luisa remained in the palace until March 1663, when she retired to the Discalced Carmelite convent in Xabregas, Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nLuisa died on February 27, 1666, aged 52, at the Discalced Carmelite convent in Xabregas, Lisbon, Portugal where she was initially buried. Her remains were later transferred to the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza, the burial site for members of the House of Braganza, at the Monastery of São Vicente de Fora in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

The Braganzas came to power in Portugal after deposing the Spanish Habsburg Philippine dynasty, which had reigned in Portugal since 1580, in a rebellion, resulting in João, 8th Duke of Braganza becoming King João IV of Portugal, in 1640. João IV was the father of Catherine of Braganza, the wife of Charles II, King of England and King of Scots.\n\nJoão IV, King of Portugal was born on March 19, 1604, at the Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa in Vila Viçosa, Évora, Portugal, which had been the seat of the House of Braganza for centuries. He was the eldest of the four children and the eldest of the three sons of Teodósio II, 7th Duke of Braganza and the Spanish noblewoman Ana de Velasco y Téllez-Girón. João’s mother died, aged 22, on November 7, 1607, after a long illness, when he was only three years old. Her death was deeply felt by her husband who did not marry again.\n\nJoão had three younger siblings:\n\nDuarte of Braganza, Lord of Vila do Conde (1605 – 1644), unmarried\n\nCatarina of Braganza (1606 – 1610), died in childhood\n\nAlexandre of Braganza (1607 – 1637), unmarried\n\nIn 1580, twenty-four years before João’s birth, the throne of Portugal was taken by the Spanish Habsburgs. In 1578, King Sebastian of Portugal from the House of Aviz was killed in battle without any heirs, causing a succession crisis. He was succeeded by his elderly great-uncle Henrique, a Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, and had no descendants because he had taken a vow of chastity as a priest.

The Iberian Union was the union of the Kingdom of Spain and the Kingdom of Portugal that existed between 1580 and 1640, under the Spanish Habsburg kings Felipe II, Felipe III, and Felipe IV who reigned as Filipe I, Filipe II, and Filipe III of Portugal.\n\nIn 1630, upon the death of his father, Teodósio II, 7th Duke of Braganza, João became the 8th Duke of Braganza. On January 12, 1633, João married Luisa de Guzmán, from the Spanish Ducal House of Medina Sidónia. Luisa was the daughter of Juan Manuel Pérez de Guzmán, 8th Duke of Medina Sidonia, whose father had been the commander-in-chief of the Spanish Armada, and Juana Lorenza Gomez de Sandoval y de la Cerda, whose father was a favorite of Felipe III, King of Spain, also Filipe II, King of Portugal.\n\nJoão IV and Luisa de Guzmán had seven children:\n\nTeodósio, Prince of Brazil, Duke of Braganza (1634 – 1653), died at age 19 due to tuberculosis\n\nAna of Braganza (born and died 1635), died at birth\n\nJoana of Braganza, Princess of Beira (1635 – 1653), died in her teens\n\nCatherine of Braganza, Queen of England, Queen of Scots (1638 – 1705), married Charles II, King of England, King of Scots, no children, had at least three miscarriages\n\nManuel of Portugal (born and died 1640), died at birth\n\nAfonso VI, King of Portugal (1643 – 1683), married Maria Francisca of Savoy.

Taxes on Portuguese merchants were increased. Portuguese nobles began to lose their influence as government posts in Portugal were increasingly given to Spaniards. Finally, Filipe III tried to make Portugal a Spanish province and if that happened, Portuguese nobles stood to lose all their power.\n\nThis situation eventually caused a rebellion organized by the Forty Conspirators, a Portuguese nationalist group during the Iberian Union composed of forty men of the Portuguese nobility. Their goal was to depose the House of Habsburg from the throne of Portugal.

Within a few hours and with popular support and the support of his Spanish-born wife Luisa de Guzmán who said, “Rather Queen for a day than Duchess all my life,” João was proclaimed João IV, King of Portugal, claiming legitimate succession through his grandmother Catarina, Duchess of Braganza. João IV’s accession to the throne of Portugal caused the Portuguese Restoration War (1640 – 1648), periodic skirmishes between Portugal and Spain that lasted into the reign of João IV’s son and ended with Spain’s official recognition of the independence of Portugal in 1648.\n\nDuring João IV’s reign, he made several alliances, and particularly important were the alliances with England and France. Although some colonial possessions were lost during his reign, João IV’s forces managed to retake Luanda in Portuguese Angola in Africa from the Dutch and recovered northern Colonial Brazil, which had been occupied by the Dutch. In 1549, João IV restructured the fifteen private and autonomous Captaincy Colonies of Brazil, which had been a colony of Portugal since 1500, into the Governorate General of Brazil in the city of Sao Salvador, which became the capital of a single and centralized Portuguese colony in South America. Brazil would remain a colony of Portugal until its independence in 1825.\n\nIn 1646, João IV placed the crown of Portugal on the head of the statue of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception in the church at the Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa in Vila Viçosa, Évora, Portugal, the seat of the House of Braganza. João IV proclaimed the Virgin Mary to be the queen, the patron saint, and the protector of Portugal. After this, no Portuguese monarch would ever wear the crown. Instead, the crown was always placed on a cushion next to the monarch.\n\nJoão IV, King of Portugal died on November 6, 1656, aged 52, at Ribeira Palace in Lisbon, Portugal. He had suffered from gout and its side effects since 1648.
