Berengaria of Castile\n\nBerenguela Princess of Leon and Castile+\n\nFernando III of Castile King of Castile and Leon+\n\nAlfonso de Molina+\n\nAlfonso IX King of Léon 1 2 3\n\nBorn: 15 Aug 1171, Zamora, Léon, Spain\n\nMarriage (1): Berengaria of Castile in 1197\n\nDied: 24 Sep 1230, Villanueva de Sarria, Lugo, Spain at age 59\n\nAnother name for Alfonso was Alfonso IX Fernandez King of Leon.\n\nResearch Notes:\n\nSecond husband of Berenguela of Castile.\n\nFrom Wikipedia - Alfonso IX of León :\n\nAlfonso IX (15 August 1171 - 23 September or 24, 1230), was king of León and Galicia , from the death of his father Ferdinand II in 1188 until his own death. According to Ibn Khaldun , he is said to have been called the Baboso or Slobberer because he was subject to fits of rage during which he foamed at the mouth.\n\nAlfonso was the only son of King Ferdinand II of León and Urraca of Portugal . He took a part in the work of the reconquest , conquering the whole of Extremadura (including the cities of Cáceres and Badajoz ). He was also the most modern king of his time, founding the University of Salamanca in 1212 and summoning in 1188 the first parliament with representation of the citizenry ever seen in Western Europe, the Cortes of León .\n\nIn spite of all the above - some of whose significance became evident only later - this king is often remembered mainly for the difficulties into which his successive marriages led him with the Pope . He was first married in 1191 to his cousin Teresa of Portugal , who bore him two daughters, and a son who died young.\n\nThe marriage was declared null by the Pope; however, Alfonso paid no attention until he was presumably tired of his wife. His next step was to marry his second cousin, Berenguela of Castile , in 1197. For this act of contumacy, the king and the kingdom were placed under interdict .\n\nThe Pope was, however, compelled to modify his measures by the threat that, if the people could not obtain the services of religion, they would not support the clergy, and that heresy would spread. The king was left under interdict personally, but to that he showed himself indifferent, and he had the support of his clergy. Berenguela left him after the birth of five children, and the king then returned to Teresa, to whose daughters he left his kingdom in his will.\n\nChildren\n\nAlfonso's children by Teresa of Portugal were:\n\n1) Fernando (ca. 1192-August 1214, aged around 22), unmarried and without issue\n\n2) Blessed Sancha (ca. 1193-1270)\n\n3) Dulce, also called Aldonza (1194/ca. 1195-ca./aft. 1243), unmarried and without issue\n\nHis eldest daughter, Sancha, was engaged to her cousin King Henry I of Castile , but Henry died in 1217 before the marriage could be solemnized. Once the would be inheritor from his first marriage, named Fernando (de Leon y Portugal)who died in 1214, he apparently wanted to disinherit the eldest son from his second marriage, but born around the year 1200, also named Fernando (de Leon y Castilla) , King Alfonso IX invited the quite mature former King Consort of Jerusalem John of Brienne to marry his daughter Sancha and thus inherit the Leonese throne through her.\n\nHowever, his former second wife, ruling Queen Berenguela of Castile convinced John of Brienne to marry one of her daughters, some 10 years younger than Sancha, instead, named Berenguela of Leon , on account of her father the King of Leon and of her mother divorced Queen Bereguela of Castile .\n\nThough unmarried and pious spinster Sancha was the nominal heiress of Leon-Galicia on her father's death in 1230, Sancha was easily set aside by negotiations, including a good single woman dowry between the former first wife and the former second wife, both divorced from the leonese. Sancha became a nun at Cozollos , where she died in 1270; she was later beatified. Her sister Dulce-Aldonza spent her life with her Consort Queen of Leon mother in Portugal.\n\nAlfonso's children by Berenguela of Castile were:\n\n4)Leonor (1198/1199-31 October 1210)\n\n5)King Fernando III the Saint (1200-1252), named also Fernando III de Castilla y Leon after 1230 when his father Alfonso IX de Leon died.\n\n6)Alfonso, 4th Lord of Molina (1203-1272)\n\n7)Berenguela of Leon (1204-1237), married John of Brienne\n\n8)Constanza (1 May 1200 or 1205-7 September 1242), became a nun at Las Huelgas , Burgos , where she died\n\nAlfonso, father of 3 from his first void marriage and father of another 5 from his second void marriage, also fathered many illegitimate children, some 23 known (3 + 5 + perhaps 15 out of married life, all documented) :\n\nAlfonso's children by Aldonza Martínez da Silva (daughter of Martim Gomes da Silva & Urraca Rodrigues and subsequently wife with issue of Diego Froilaz, Conde de Cifuentes, had issue):\n\n9)Pedro Alfonso of León, 1st Lord of Tenorio (ca. 1196/ca. 1200-1226), Grand Master of Santiago, married N de Villarmayor, and had issue\n\n10)Alfonso Alfonso of León, died yong\n\n11)Fernando Alfonso of León, died young\n\n12)Rodrigo Alfonso of León (ca. 1210-ca. 1267), 1st Lord of Aliger and Governor of Zamora , married ca. 1240 to Inés Rodriguez de Cabrera (ca. 1200-), and had issue\n\n13)Teresa Alfonso of León (ca. 1210-), wife of Nuno Gonzalez de Lara, el Bueno, señor de Lara\n\n14)Aldonza Alonso of León (ca. 1212/ca. 1215-1266), wife, first, of Diego Ramírez Froilaz, nephew of her stepfather, without issue, and, second, of Pedro Ponce de Cabrera , (ca. 1210-), and had issue, ancestors of the notorious Ponce de León family.\n\nAlfonso's child by Inés Iñíguez de Mendoza (ca. 1180-) (daughter of Lope Iñiguez de Mendoza, 1st Lord of Mendoza (ca. 1140-1189) and wife Teresa Ximénez de los Cameros (ca. 1150-)):\n\n15)Urraca Alfonso of León (ca. 1190/ca. 1197-), first wife ca. 1230 of Lopo II Díaz de Haro (1192-15 December 1236), 6th Sovereign Lord of Viscaya, and had issue\n\nAlfonso's child by Estefánia Pérez de Limia , daughter of Pedro Arias de Limia and wife, subsequently wife of Rodrigo Suárez, Merino mayor of Galicia , had issue):\n\n16)Fernando Alfonso of León (ca. 1211-), died young\n\nAlfonso's children by Maua, of unknown origin:\n\n17)Fernando Alfonso of León (ca. 1215/1218/1220-Salamanca , 1278/1279), Archdean of Santiago, married to Aldara de Ulloa and had issue\n\nAlfonso's children by Dona Teresa Gil de Soverosa (ca. 1170-) (daughter of Dom Gil Vasques de Soverosa & first wife Maria Aires de Fornelos):\n\n18)María Alfonso of León (ca. 1190/1200/1222-aft. 1252), married as his second wife Soeiro Aires de Valadares (ca. 1140-) and had issue and Álvaro Fernández de Lara (ca. 1200-) and had female issue, later mistress of her nephew Alfonso X of Castile\n\n19)Sancha Alfonso of León (1210/ca. 1210-1270), a Nun after divorcing without issue Simón Ruíz, Lord of Los Cameros\n\n20)Martín Alfonso of León (ca. 1210/ca. 1225-1274/ca. 1275)\n\n22)Urraca Alfonso of León (ca. 1210/1228-aft.1252, married twice, first to García Romeu of Tormos, without issue, then Pedro Guillén de Guzmán y González Girón\n\nAlfonso's other illegitimate child, mother unknown:\n\n23)Mayor Alfonso de León, married Rodrigo Gómez de Trava, without issue\n\nAlfonso VIII of León was the first King in Western Europe who summoned the citizens to the Parliament (León's Cortes of 1188).
