The lines merge again with the marriage of Richard I, Duke of Normandy, and Emma, daughter of Hugh, who was -in all but name- King of France. His son, Hugh Capet, later assumed the title, and primogeniture began in the French line of kings.\n\nThe two lines met again later with the marriage of Adele, daughter of King Robert II, and Richard III, Duke of Normandy. Richard I, \"the Fearless\"; named father's heir 29 May 942. Married first (Danish wife) Gunnora but betrothed ca. 945 and eventually married 960 to Emma. Richard was betrothed to Emma for some time but did not marry her until about 960, after the death of her father, Hugh the Great, in 956. Richard was the guardian of Hugh's son, the Duke of Paris, and eventually married Emma to strengthen his position. He did not treat her unkindly, he merely loved Gunnora. Poor Emma passed her life at Rouen alone and solitary, and eventually she pined away and died about the year 962. After Emma's death he married (Christian marriage) Gunnora to legitimize their children.\n\nFather: William I \"Longsword\" of Normandy (2º Duke of Normandy)\n\nMother: Adele (Sprota) of Bretagne\n\nMarried 1: Emma (Agnes) CAPET of France 960/962 , France\n\nAssociated with: Gunnora De CREPON (D. of Normandy)\n\nChildren:\n\n1.

Duke of Normandy 1106-1135. His reign is notable for important legal and administrative reforms, and for the final resolution of the investiture controversy. Abroad, he waged several campaigns in order to consolidate and expand his continental possessions. Was so hated by his brothers that they vowed to disinherit him. In 1106 he captured Robert and held him til he died. He proved to be a hard but just ruler. One of his lovers, Nest, Princess of Deheubarth, was known as the most beautiful woman in Wales; she had many lovers. He aparently died from over eating Lampreys. During a Christmas court at Windsor Castle in 1126 that Henry I, who had no legitimate male heir, tried to force his barons to accept his daughter Matilda as his successor. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles reported that \"...there he caused archbishops and bishops and abbots and earls all the thegns that were there to swear to give England and Normandy after his death into the hand of his daughter\". Swear they did, but they were not happy about it. None of those present were interested in being among the first to owe allegiance to a woman. The stage was set for the 19-year-long bloody struggle for the throne that rent England apart after Henry's death. Ironically, the final resolution to that civil war, the peace treaty between King Stephen and Matilda's son Henry of Anjou, was ratified on Christmas Day at Westminster in 1153.\n\nFather: WILLIAM I \"the Conqueror\" of Normandy (King of England)\n\nMother: Matilda of Flanders\n\nMarried 1: Matilda (Edith) of Scotland (dau. of Malcom III, King of Scotland, and Margaret Aetheling) 11 Nov 1100, Westminster Abbey, London, England\n\nChildren:\n\n1.

The Complete Peerage vol.V,pp689-692.\n\nAn undoubted Earl of Gloucester, perhaps the first authentic one, at any rate after the Conquest, is Robert FitzHamon's son-in-law, another Robert, who was an illegitimate son of Henry I and was so created 1122. The Earldom passed to his eldest son, William FitzRobert, and from him to John, later King John and husband from 1189 to 1199 (when he divorced her) of Isabel, the youngest of William FitzRobert's three daughters. On John's coming to the throne the title did not merge in the Crown for it was not his in his own right but in right of his wife.King John I divorced her on the ground of consanguinity.\n\nIsabel's situation now became that of a great heiress, for whoever she married next would gain the Earldom. John prevented her taking a second husband at all for the time being, however, and exchanged the Earldom of Gloucester with Aumarie de Montfort, son of William FitzRobert's eldest daughter Mabel, for the Comte of Evereux, which he then used as a dowry to secure the marriage of his niece Blanche with the King of France's son. Aumarie died childless and Isabel, who towards the end of John's reign married as her second husband Geoffrey de Mandeville, Earl of Essex and in right of his new wife now Earl of Gloucester too, died childless after marrying in the autumn of 1217 yet a third husband, Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent.\n\nThe latter seems not to have been recognised as Earl of Gloucester as well as of Kent, despite his wife's undoubted possession of the former Earldom by the time of their marriage. But then she died only a few days later and her sister Amice, by now the only one of William FitzRobert's daughters still living, seems to have been recognised as Countess of Gloucester till her own death some seven and a half years later. On the other hand Amice's son Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford or of Clare (usually called the latter), was apparently acknowledged as Earl of Gloucester in addition to his other dignity from as soon as the month after his aunt Isabel's death back in 1217.\n\nFather: William FITZROBERT (2º E.

Those who dispute Rosamund's claim base their case on the disparity in the ages of all concerned, but there is other evidence as well which can not be ignored. Unfortunately, the records date neither the birth of Rosamund nor that of her father, or her reputed sons. Documents also indicate an Ida, and an Ykenai as his mother.

The huge sums of money sought by the Pope and Edmund's father, Henry III, to drive Manfred out of southern Italy made this venture very unpopular with the English barons. The scheme was finally abandoned in 1263. In 1264, England was in a state of civil war. King Henry III and Prince Edward were captured by the forces of Simon De Montfort, Earl of Leicester, who was, for all practical purposes, the ruler of England. Meanwhile, Edmund and his mother, Queen Eleanor were in Paris raising an army. After the Battle of Eversham in1265, where Simon De Montfort was slain and his forces defeated by Prince Edward who had escaped from captivity, Edmund returned to England with his mother. He was one of the magnates who urged Henry III to adopt the sweeping measure of confiscation (against those barons who had supported Montfort) determined on in the parliament of Winchester, being moved, it was believed, by the desire of enriching himself. He had a large share of the spoils, being created Earl of Leicester and receiving the stewardship of the kingdom. In 1267 he was also created Earl of Lancaster. With his brother, Prince Edward, and several other magnates, Edmund took up the cross in 1268 and was with his brother at Acre in 1271-72. Returning home before Edward, he reached England in Dec 1272, shortly after his father's death, was received with rejoicing by the Londoners, and went to his mother at Windsor. His crusade, during which he is said to have accomplished little or nothing , seems to have gained him the nickname of Crouchback (or crossed back). It is said, however, to have been asserted by John of Gaunt in 1385 that the name implied deformity, that Edmund was really the elder son of Henry III, but had been passed over by his father as unfit to reign, and a desire of spreading this fable appears to have been entertained by Henry of Lancaster (Henry IV), and was perhaps implied in his challenge of the crown. By his marriage, after the death of his childless first wife, Aveline De Fortibus, to Blanche, the granddaughter of King Louis VIII of France, Edmund became Count of Champagne and Brie. From 1277 to 1296 Edmund was active in the King's service. He commanded the King's forces in South Wales, acted as Ambassador at the French court, unsuccessfully attempted to organize another crusade on behalf of the King, and, in conjunction with Roger De Mortimer, E. March, defeated and executed Llewelyn in Wales. When war broke out with France in 1294/5, Edmund was again serving as Ambassador there. Remaining loyal to King Edward, he, of course, lost all claim to his French possessions. He led armies in Brittany and Gascony. He died in Bayonne deeply mortified that he was not provided the funds needed to keep his army in the field. He was religoius, gay, and pleasant in disposition, open-handed, and a popularcommander.
