        "text": "Columbia Records is a frontline record label at Sony Music, headquartered in New York.\n\nColumbia’s origins date all the way back to January 15, 1889, after which it evolved from the American Graphophone Company, which had itself been consolidated with the Columbia Phonograph Co. in 1894.\n\nThe company’s storied catalog includes recordings from artists such as Adele, Louis Armstrong, BeyoncÃ©, Mariah Carey, Johnny Cash, Leonard Cohen, Miles Davis, Neil Diamond, Celine Dion, Bob Dylan, Billie Holiday, Billy Joel, George Michael, Thelonious Monk, Frank Sinatra, Simon & Garfunkel, Bruce Springsteen, Barbra Streisand, and Bill Withers.\n\nColumbia Records: Ron Perry era\n\nIn 2016, Sony announced that Columbia Records CEO & Chairman, Rob Stringer, would be promoted to CEO & Chairman of Sony Music as of April 2017.\n\nThat left an empty chair at the helm of Columbia.\n\nAfter a months-long search for the right candidate, Stringer announced in January 2018 that former SONGS Music Publishing President, Ron Perry, had been named CEO & Chairman of Columbia.\n\nStringer said at the time, âRon is an immensely dynamic and forward-thinking executive who excels at bringing the best out of artistic vision. After his enormous success in recent years, we are thrilled to have Ron join Sony Music and lead the great team and unparalleled roster at the legendary Columbia Records label.â\n\nPerry’s Columbia has since enjoyed success with artists including Harry Styles and Lil Nas X."
