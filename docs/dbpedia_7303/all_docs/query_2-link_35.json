        "text": "Jumping 42 years ahead from the last post, this installment of Zaydeâs Turntable gives us one of the classic doo-wop groups singing the song that made them famous. Vee-Jay Records 147 is a must-own for anyone serious about â50s doo-wop, rock, or R&B and it takes us from the last post, with one of the earlier 78s of the 20th century, to one of the last batch of 78s released before the onslaught of the 45RPM and the LP (33-1/3RPM).\n\nThe Vee-Jay label was founded in 1953 by the husband and wife team of Vivian Carter (âVeeâ) and James Bracken (âJayâ) and was the first major record company to be owned and operated by African-Americans. Vee-Jay was a R&B powerhouse â their very first song made it onto the Top Ten of the national R&B charts. While they stayed fairly consistent with R&B and blues artists throughout the 1950s the company branched into soul in the 1960s and was the first to nationally release a recording by The Pips (later Gladys Knight and the Pips). After soul the label added on rock and roll acts, which is where some of their most famous talent would end up performing: The Four Seasons (Vee-Jayâs first non-black artists) and The Beatles. Down the road they added Little Richard and even an album with Jimi Hendrix and Billy Preston in 1965. The label started dabbling in other genres, including a small jazz line, some gospel albums, and even (on 33-1/3PM LP) some comedy records.\n\nVee-Jay was at its commercial peak from 1962 to 1964 thanks to The Four Seasons and their distribution of early Beatles albums (tracks included âLove Me Do,â âP.S. I Love You,â and âTwist and Shoutâ among several others). Beatles record sales exploded for Vee-Jay in 1964 after the British Invasion and the companyâs high-water mark was the sale of 2.6 million Beatles singles in just one month.\n\nThis album is in fair condition. It has moderate wear and scratches on both sides, with the expected impact on the quality of the recorded audio (pops, hisses, etc.; the audio of my versions, linked to below, is not ideal and I strongly encourage you to search elsewhere on YouTube for better quality audio of these two great tracks). The B-side has two dried paint drops on it, which cause the disk to skip briefly at each point. It is an electrically recorded 10-inch diameter 78-RPM black vinyl disc with lateral grooves and a Â¼â spindle hole. The label is not paper glued onto the vinyl, as was common on most 78s, but is, instead, painted directly onto the vinyl. The record catalog number is Vee-Jay 147. The A-side recording features the El Dorados singing their chart-topping hit âAt My Front Doorâ by John Moore (?) and Ewart Abner (1923-1997); the master number is 55-257 and it was recorded on April 24, 1955. It runs 2 minutes and 32 seconds and was produced by Tollie Music.\n\nThe B-side recording also features the El Dorados singing âWhatâs Bugginâ You, Baby?â by Bob Drews and Riley Hampton (1918-2006); the master number is 55-274 and it was recorded on June 8, 1955. It runs 2 minutes and 19 seconds and was also produced by Tollie Music. Les Docks sets the value at $7-$10. To my surprise, I was not able to find any other copy of the 78RPM version of this album for sale online; there were fully 18 people selling the 45RPM version of the album (many calling it ârareâ), for between $4 and $65, with an average asking price of $25. Given that the album is not terribly scarce and the quality of my copy of it is only fair, I would set the value of my Vee-Jay 147 closer to $4-$7.\n\nIn Chicago in 1952 Pirkle Lee Moses pulled together a doo-wop vocal group that called themselves âPirkle Lee and the Five Stars.â The other members included tenors Louis Bradley and Arthur Bassett, second tenor and baritone Jewel Jones, and baritone/bass singers James Maddox and Richard Nickens. Pirkle left the group briefly to serve in the Air Force and when he returned in 1954 they changed the groupâs name to âThe El Dorados.â Carter, from Vee-Jay, heard them sing in Chicago in 1954 and signed the group to the label. Their first three Vee-Jay albums were flops commercially but, in 1955, they released their fourth Vee-Jay record, number 147. It was a smash hit, quickly rising to #1 on the Billboard R&B chart and #17 on the pop chart. Their next album with Vee-Jay, number 165, also placed in the R&B top ten in 1956. That year Basset and Nickens left the group and The El Dorados tried to make a go as a quartet. It didnât work out, though, and the group went their separate ways in 1957: Pirkle, still in Chicago, reformed the group with all new members and Bradley, Jones, and Maddox moved to California and formed a new group called The Tempos. Pirkleâs new group wasnât to Vee-Jayâs liking and the label dropped them in 1958, after releasing a total of just eleven El Dorado singles from 1954-1958.\n\nâAt My Front Door,â also called âCrazy Little Mama,â was a smash hit and propelled the El Dorados to significant fame in the 1950s. It was covered by Pat Boone (in a version that was panned by some critics), Myron and the Van Dells, and Ringo Starr, among many, many others over the years. As a doo-wop/motown classic it is a standard for countless contemporary groups that perform the style (search YouTube for either version of the songâs title and youâll see). In 1955 the wildly prolific piano roll artist J. Lawrence Cook (1899-1976) made the piano roll version under the pseudonym Pep Doyle. It was such a hit that Vee-Jay made it the title track on their first ever LP: âCrazy Little Mamaâ in 1957.\n\nEwart Abner, credited on âAt My Front Door,â joined the label in 1955, first as manager, then as vice president, and ultimately, as president from 1961 to 1963, when it was the most successful black-owned record company in the world. It was under Abnerâs leadership that the label got The Beatles first U.S. albums â as a âthrow inâ in a deal with Trans-Global/EMI for the artist they really wanted, Frank Ifield. Cash flow problems caused by Ewart Abnerâs tapping the company treasury to cover personal gambling debts led to the companyâs active demise. He also kept many of the companyâs books, not on paper, but in his head. When Beatlemania, and the ensuing blizzard of lawsuits, descended, Vee-Jay was overwhelmed and forced to temporarily cease operations in the second half of 1963, leading to royalty disputes with the Four Seasons and, of course, EMI. The Four Seasons then left Vee-Jay for Philips Records, and EMIâs Capitol Records picked up the U.S. rights for both the Beatles and Frank Ifield. Abner went on to become a key executive, and eventually president, of Motown Records, and principal of Chicago-based Constellation Records.\n\nAs for Abnerâs partner on the hit, composer John C. Moore, I could find very little in my research outside of a connection to several other Motown and doo-wop records from artists such as Pat Boone, Dee Clark, and the Righteous Brothers. His most common reference, however, is in connection with the El Dorados âAt My Front Door.â\n\nâWhatâs Bugginâ You, Baby?â is the doo-wop song on the flip side of the album. Itâs not a bad tune, but didnât make the cut for the LP version of âAt My Front Door (Crazy Little Mama)â. In fact, Vee-Jay and its affiliates did not place this track on any of their reissues on 45RPM or 33-1/3PM. It wouldnât appear again on an album until the Collectables CD #7245 from October 2000 âThe Very Best of the El Dorados.â\n\nBob Drews, who composed the song, was a moderately well-known radio personality of the period who ricocheted around radio stations throughout the 1950s and 1960s. A Billboard magazine ad placed by Vee-Jay in 1955 to promote the album touts him as âDee-Jay Bob Drewsâ; interestingly the ad suggests that Drews composed both âWhatâs Bugginâ You, Baby?â and âAt My Front Door,â though he is not credited with the latter track on the album itself. In 1955 Drews could be heard on WAAF in Chicago, before making the move to WRIT in Milwaukee in March of 1956. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette of December 5, 1958 puts Drews in the Keystone State that year with this little dig: âGood Old Bob Drews, formerly of WAMP, will take over the 7 to 10 wake-up show on WMCK come Monday. Drews plans a give-away contest to get his program off to a good start. First prize will be a strait jacket [sic]. This is very appropriate, as listener [sic] to the âNew Good Old Bob Drews Showâ will quickly discover.â By April of 1960 Drews was spinning a weekend show on WCAE out of Philadelphia and a regular program over WEEP in Pittsburgh. In 1961 Drews was on the move again; a Billboard Music Week column refers to him as host of the âGood Old Bob Drews Showâ on WWL-TV in New Orleans. The column posed the question âWhich recording artist would you like to interview the most and why?â to a series of DJs; Drews picked Annette Funicello to be on his show, but âfor an off-the-record interview give me Julie London.â\n\nRiley Hampton was an important, yet sadly unknown Chicago-based arranger who has been behind some of the most significant doo-wop, Motown, and R&B hits ever written. Hampton, originally from Little Rock, Arkansas, was playing with a band in Detroit in the early 1940s when he left the group to take a spot in the Jimmy Murray band in Pittsburgh. In 1942 the band was taken over by Fletcher Henderson and the following year Hampton was drafted into the Army. Upon his return in 1946 he returned to the Henderson Band, then playing at the Club DeLisa in Chicago. He played under a variety of directors at the club, finally finding a regular seat in the Red Saunders band at the same venue in 1952. Within a few years the musically talented Hampton was finding more work as a composer and arranger than as a performer.\n\nBy 1955 he was a regular arranger for Vee-Jay, working on a number of songs â including âWhatâs Bugginâ You, Baby?â â before hanging up his sax for good around 1959 and being named the house bandleader for Chess Records. It was with Chess and a handful of other labels throughout the 1960s that Hampton was part of some of the recordings that made him famous, including Etta James smash hit âAt Last.â James gospel style blues singing found a striking balance with Hamptonâs pop-like string and horn-focused arrangements. The mixture was magical, producing most of Jamesâ Top Ten R&B hits and launching her career as a major soul singer. Hampton went on to arrange for Walter Jackson (on Okeh), Curtis Mayfield, Ramsey Lewis, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Dee Clark, Eddie Holland, Barbara Lewis, Billy Eckstine, Gene Chandler, Major Lance, Billy Butler and the Enchanters, the Impressions, and the Supremes.\n\nUnlike many of the records in my collection and on this blog, the story of Vee-Jay 147 persists into the present time. After a few decades of fits and starts, Vee-Jay today operates as âThe Vee-Jay Limited Partnershipâ under the management of Michele Tayler. The Connecticut company primarily overseeing the licensing and republication of Vee-Jay songs. The most recent I could find, from twelve years ago, was remastered and released by Collectables Records on CD, including a âBest of Vee-Jayâ box set and individual âBest of the Vee-Jay Yearsâ CDs.\n\nAs for the El Dorados, in 1969 Pirkle revived the group, with new members. Simultaneously the singer Johnny Carter, formerly of the Tempos, formed his own vocal group also called the El Dorados. After several years of competition, the two groups merged in the 1970s. The combined group toured and made records for many, many years and, when Pirkle died in 2000, the group renamed itself âPirkle Lee Moses Jrâs El Doradosâ in his honor. The group, under that name, continued to tour until 2009. After discovering the group persisted, in some fashion, until close to today, I went online to see if I could find out more about the group today â where are they performing, how to contact them, what they are singing in concert these days. Unfortunately, I could not find anything. Iâd like to think that 2009 wasnât their last live gig and if anyone reading this can tell me whether or not that was their last song, I would love to find out.\n\nAfter a very long hiatus Zaydeâs Turntable is back! We return with an older record from one of the most prolific record companies in history: Columbia. Iâve already posted about the history of Columbia elsewhere, so I wonât delve much into it here. This record, in a way, ties together some important figures in the earliest jazz recordings andâ¦Holst!\n\nThis series is from the Columbia Graphophone Company (not a typo): âBeginning at A1 (10â) and A5000 (12â) the early couplings [on the Columbia A-series] were often wildly inappropriate, sometimes pairing comic songs with concert band selections or vaudeville routines with Victorian sentimental balladsâ¦ In early 1916, Columbiaâs manufacturing branchâ¦was reorganized as the Columbia Graphophone Manufacturing Company of Bridgeport, Connecticut and New York.â (from Allan Suttonâs 1994 Directory of American disc record brands and manufacturers 1891-1943) Actual manufacturing was done at the Howe factory in Bridgeport, most famous for creating Elias Howeâs sewing machines.\n\nHow âwildly inappropriateâ were the pairings? Consider the records immediately surrounding this album (A-1485) in the Columbia catalog. A-1484 offered Eddie Morton singing âWhile They Were Dancing Aroundâ and Al Campbell and Henry Burr doing a duet version of âIâm On My Way To Mandalayâ â and A-1486 carried two harp and zither tracks, one of Offenbachâs âLa Belle Heleneâ and the other Karl Millocherâs âI And My Boy.â\n\nThis album is in Good condition. It has some light wear and scratches on both sides, but there is no effect on the recorded audio, and the B-side label shows some soiling. It is an acoustically recorded 10-inch diameter 78-RPM black vinyl disc with lateral grooves and a Â¼â spindle hole. The record catalog number is Columbia Record A-1485 and the master number is 39064/38997. It bears a stamped number â51â in the end gap on the A-side. Columbia records after 1924 had a three part code stamped in the same place to indicate the stamper and mother number used to press the record, but as this record pre-dates that practice I am not entirely certain to what â51â refers. If it were a stamper number, it could suggest that as many as 51,000 copies of the record were pressed.\n\nThe A-side recording features Princeâs Orchestra led by Charles Adams Prince (1869â1937) playing âBabbling Brookâ by Charles W. Rega (?). It runs 3 minutes and 26 seconds. The B-side recording features Princeâs Band, again led by Prince, playing the gavotte âThe Village Bellesâ by Eduard Holst (yes, Eduard) (1843-1899). It runs 3 minutes and 5 seconds. The A-side was recorded in August 1913 and the B-side in October 1913 (Tim Brooksâ Columbia Master Book Discography lists the recording date as August 16, 1919, which does not seem likely as the Columbia A1000s series was produced between 1911 and 1913; a 1919 recording would show a catalog number in the A2500s). Les Docks sets the value at $3-$5. I could find no other current listings of this album for sale online.\n\nIf the Columbia Graphophone Company didnât come onto the scene until 1916, how come the 1913 recording year? My guess is this album carries two tracks that may have been previously recorded and issued on another label in the Columbia family. Many of Princeâs instrumental recordings also appeared anonymously on the affiliated Climax and Oxford labels. This is purely speculation, however, as I could find no reference to either of these pieces existing on any other record besides Columbia A-1485 (the always helpful Online Discography does not have a directory of Climax records and their listing of Oxford albums shows no recording with either of these titles â except Oxford 5600A, a recording of âVillage Belles,â however the composer is not Holst but Edwin F. Kendall, a piano composer better known for his ragtime pieces). Another possibility would be that this record is actually from the British branch of Columbia, confusingly also named The Columbia Graphophone Company. I donât think this is the case for two reasons: first, the British company wasnât founded until 1922. Second, the record bears a price that is clearly American: â65câ. Both the cost and the currency are consistent with the American record company.\n\nNow â what the heck is a Graphophone? Itâs really no different from a gramophone or phonograph. The concept was identical, for the most part, to the phonograph originally developed by Thomas Edison. Competing scientists at the Volta Laboratory (founded by Alexander Graham Bell) refined and improved Edisonâs machine by introducing a lateral recording method (instead of vertical cuts) and by replacing Edisonâs impractical tinfoil-coated cast iron cylinder with wax-coated cardboard cylinders. Some authors breathlessly declare that it was Bellâs return fire against Edison; I think thatâs a bit overly dramatic. Nevertheless the end result was no small improvement: ârecordsâ became less expensive, easier to produce, lasted longer, and offered much better sound quality. A trademarked name, the Graphophone moniker and the heavily patented technology was passed around by a series of company mergers and bankruptcies between the 1880s and the early decades of the 20th century, ultimately ending its usage in the 1930s as a Columbia disc brand. The technology itself spawned not only the laterally-grooved vinyl disc we are familiar with today, but also the Dictaphone and similar recording devices.\n\nThe piece âBabbling Brookâ is by the composer Charles W. Rega. Stop reading this for a second, open another tab and head to Google. Enter âCharles W. Regaâ and hit search. Thatâs about as much as I could find about Rega, too.\n\nAfter checking hard copy references I could still find no reference to a Charles Rega ever existing in this period (except one: Charles Rega was a lay reader in the village of Skaguay, Alaska as part of the Alaska Missionary District in 1895 â I doubt he also wrote songs). Then, a break-through. Brooksâ Columbia Master Book Discography does include a listing for âBabbling Brookâ and the master number matches exactly with the one on this record: 39064. It is the same exact song, but in the Discography the composer is listed as âMilo Rega.â Aha. Milo Rega was the pseudonym of Fred Hager (1874-1958).\n\nHager is best known as one of the first âA&Râ guys. He and his colleague Justin Ring were scouts for Okeh records in the 1920s and assembled the group that backed black singer Mamie Smith in some of the recordings that many blues buffs consider the foundations of the âRace record industry.â Okeh would go on to become one of the leading labels for early blues musicians. Hagerâs instincts were rooted in his own musical abilities. Starting in the 1900s he wrote songs for the Zonophone (a label founded in 1899 and shortly sold to, yep, Columbia, who affiliated it with its other alternative label Oxford). Hager and Ring worked together on compositions into the 1920s, many of which were credited to the fictitious F. Wallace Rega, Miles Rega, or Milo Rega, aliases derived from Hagerâs own name. I cannot find any other reference to his using âCharles W. Regaâ but the composer of âBabbling Brookâ is almost certainly Fred Hager. A search for Hagerâs name in connection with âBabbling Brookâ confirms this: in February 1922 Nathan Glantz directed the Xylo Novelty/Specialty Orchestra in a recording of the piece, credited to Hager by name, that appeared simultaneously on Banner Records 1083 and Regal Records 9207. Interestingly, Glantz also directed the âRega Dance Orchestraâ on Okeh Records. Here, however, is the earlier Columbia A-1485 recording of âBabbling Brookâ from my collection.\n\nI almost titled this post âBait and Switchâ because when I first picked up this record it was the composerâs name on the B-side that caught my eye: Holst! A Holst song from circa 1913 would immediately precede the famed composerâs most acclaimed work â âThe Planets.â Perhaps the âThe Village Bellesâ would provide some taste of the almost hymn-like orchestral masterpiece, an early testing of the resounding bells that fill Gustav Holstâs Opus 32 masterwork (if you listen to it, it clearly does not). I hit the books, but could find no piece â not even a movement within a larger piece â titled âThe Village Bellesâ by Gustav Holst. Thinking it may have been a different title wrongly ascribed to another Gustav Holst piece I listened to his works from the 1910s and 1900s to find a match. No luck. I searched for instrumental works with that title from the period and found reference to a piece with that title by a T.E. Spinney in the 1884 edition of The Monthly Musical Record and in the library of Victorian era English tenor Sims Reeves. The Reeves connection, and a discovery that Spinney also wrote a Te Deum, among other works for vocalists, suggested that his piece âVillage Bellesâ was likely also a piece for vocalist. That and the 1884 date discouraged me from considering this song to be Spinneyâs.\n\nThen I stumbled across the other, lesser known but more prolific Holst: Eduard.\n\nEduard Holst was born in Copenhagen in 1843 and was an exceptionally productive composer, dance master, playwright, and occasional actor. Most of his over 2,000 works were songs and solo piano works, the most popular of which were probably his âDance of the Demons,â âBeautiful Evening Star,â and âDiana Grande Valse de Concertâ â a piece arranged variously over the years for 2, 3, and 4 pianos (thatâs 4, 6, or 8 hands).\n\nLittle else is known of Eduard today, despite his lengthy roster of compositions and his copious output. He died in New York City at the relatively young age of 56. Assuming he started composing when he was 20, thatâs 2,000 pieces over 36 years â or an average of about 56 compositions a year, almost five pieces per month every month of his life. In his time Eduard Holstâs piano music was so inexhaustible that one publication included it in a âLitanyâ that is well worth posting in its entirety:\n\nA LITANY: CANTO II From wedding invitations and from the history of the United States; from the piano pieces of Eduard Holst and from fat women who are afraid of being betrayed; from all plays that run on Broadway more than fifty nights and from the Emmanuel Movement; from female bachelors of arts and from physical exercise in all its hideous forms; from editorials in newspapers and from the theory that it is sinful to chew tobacco; from the streptococci and from serial novels; from denaturized [sic] alcohol and from chilblains; from the works of Henryk Sienkiewicz and from chicken salad; from ecclesiastics who essay to be jocose in the pulpit and from the initiative and referendum; from fresh water oysters and from labor leaders; from theosophy and from the genealogical page in the Boston Transcript; from Uncle Tomâs Cabin and from elderly ladies who sit on the piazzas of summer hotels and swap obstetrical anecdotes; from bier jisch and from glassy potatoes; from perfumed cigarettes and from remorse from the doctrine of infant damnation and from Rosa Bonheurâs âThe Horse Fairâ â good Lord, deliver us! (The Smart Set: A Magazine of Cleverness, Volume 37, 1912).\n\nGive the type and style of music Eduard Holst composed, the years in which he was most active, and the style and sound of this song on Columbia A-1485 (a gavotte is a type of French dance from the mid-19th century) I am quite confident in saying that âThe Village Bellesâ is the work of Eduard Holst, not Gustav. Here is, as far as I can find, the only audio recording of âThe Village Bellesâ by Eduard Holst available today.\n\nThe âPrinceâ in Princeâs Orchestra and Princeâs Band refers to Charles Adams Prince. Prince, said to be a descendant of Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams, was an accomplished pianist and organist, cutting his first recording in 1891 for the New York Phonograph Company and making his way, eventually, to Columbia, where he accompanied on the first Columbia Grand Opera Records through 1902. In that year, Columbiaâs orchestra director â Fred Hager (thatâs right) â stepped down from the post and Prince was named to fill the spot. Three years later Princeâs Band (or Princeâs Orchestra, largely depending on the instrumentation called for with each piece) was formed at Columbia. He would serve as the director of various Columbia house bands and his own eponymous one until 1923 when he changed labels to Puritan Records and, finally, Victor Records, to serve as associate music director.\n\nMost jazz aficionados are familiar with the Princeâs Band recordings as they are often the first recordings of some true classics of the genre. Their 1915 rendition of W.C. Handyâs âSt. Louis Bluesâ is one such record, as are their recordings of Porter Steeleâs âHigh Societyâ in 1911 and Lew Pollack and Ray Gilbertâs âThatâs A Plentyâ in 1914 (a song that was, incidentally, a standard part of this authorâs repertoire when he played in the band Lookinâ For Treble in the late 1990s). The Princeâs Band recording of Handyâs âThe Memphis Bluesâ in 1914 was preceded by the initial recording â by the Victor Military Band â by only one week. In addition to these jazz classics in 1917 the versatile Prince conducted Richard Wagnerâs âRienzi Overtureâ for what was Columbiaâs very first classical music release.\n\nPrinceâs Band/Orchestra was made up of some of the top instrumental talent of the day. Most of these men can likely be heard on this particular record: Vincent Buono (cornet), Leo Zimmerman (trombone), George Schweinfest and Marshall P. Lufsky (alternately flute and piccolo), Arthur Bergh and George Stehl (violin), Thomas Mills (xylophone, bells), Howard Kopp (xylophone, bells, drums), Thomas Hughes and William Tuson (clarinet), and Charles Schuetze (harp). While they primarily backed vocalists for Columbia, often without label credit, the band itself had a remarkable 80 instrumental recordings in the Top Forty hit charts between 1905 and 1923, including three #1 hits: âBallinâ The Jackâ in 1914 and âHello, Hawaii, How Are You?â and âThe Star-Spangled Bannerâ both in 1916.\n\nFor the return of Zaydeâs Turntable I wanted to go back to the original spirit of this blog and the project that inspired it: to select a record at random from my collection, research it, record it digitally, and share it. When I pulled Columbia A-1485 out from the middle of the stack I was very happy to find the name Holst on one of the sides. Knowing the Columbia label was from around the time period of âThe Planetsâ I got ahead of myself and thought it was Gustav Holst. It took several days of research for me to piece together the truth â though it would have been nice if Columbia had used a first name for the composer, as they did on the other side, or at least a first initial. Then, when I set to work on the reverse side I was flummoxed by the non-existent Rega. Even searches for pseudonyms of Charles Rega were fruitless. A careless typo led me to Milo Rega and then to Fred Hager. Itâs not the first time I discovered a pseudonym on a record and, indeed, they were exceptionally common throughout the 20th century of recording.\n\nStill, when I started on this post, I thought it would be a simple one to research. But even the simplest look record on the surface may have an interesting historical mystery beneath. I am quite pleased to place online a recording of Eduard Holstâs âThe Village Bellesâ that â to my knowledge â not only does not exist in audio format anywhere else, but has been lost to history as a song that he even wrote. Given his current obscurity and the volume of his work, of course, thatâs not a real surprise. Iâm also happy to have been able to connect the enigmatic Charles Rega with Fred Hager. The early Columbia A-series was known for having a sometimes odd combination of songs on a record or in a series of records. A-1485 is two instrumental pieces, sandwiched in the catalog between two other styles of music, and representing two very different â but equally mysterious (and strangely, at the same time, equally prolific) â composers. It may have been a bait and switch, but I have to say that Iâm satisfied with the outcome.\n\nThis week on Zaydeâs Turntable we find a somewhat untraditional type of record. While the song and the performer are not that remarkable I was looking forward to posting about one of the several albums in my collection from the intriguing âHit of the Weekâ label.\n\nâHit of the Weekâ (HOTW) were a very unique series of albums issued in the 1930s, at the height of the Great Depression, which were made â not of the standard shellac â but instead of a patented paper/resin product called Durium. Simply put, HOTW records, first issued in February 1930, were an ultra-cheap record for the impoverished nation. Each week the newest HOTW record appeared in flimsy rice-paper sleeves on newsstands (not, as with other records, at record stores) for just 15 cents â the cheapest record available at the time. Despite the fact that they were printed on paper stock and not vinyl, HOTW records had remarkably good audio quality, often matching or exceeding the quality of shellac records of the same period. The single-sided records were sometimes issued with liner notes or the featured artistâs picture illustrated on the back (a feature missing from this particular album, however). By the summer of 1930, at its peak, HOTW were selling nearly 500,000 records each week (at 15 cents per record, that makes a weekly gross of $75,000 â or about $970,000 in todayâs dollars); however, the continually worsening economy quickly claimed even the super cheap HOTW record company. Sales crashed and in March 1931 the company went into receivership. Two months later they were purchased by an advertising agency that attempted to revive the label, expanding the discs to five minutes in length, with two songs per record â still only on one side, and raising the price to 20 cents. The changes did not work and the final HOTW was produced in June 1932. The advertising industry continued to utilize Durium printed records throughout the decade, primarily as 5â and 3â promotional records. The agencies would even print the mailing address and affix postage directly onto the reverse of the miniature paper records. HOTW records are today relatively popular with collectors â even those with less remarkable songs or singers â largely due to the medium upon which they are pressed. HOTW did publish a number of A-list musiciansâ works, however, including Duke Ellington (who appeared on the label as part of the group the âHarlem Hot Chocolatesâ), Eddie Cantor, Rudy Vallee, and Gene Austin.\n\nThis album is in Very Good condition. It has a small chip at the edge, but it does not intrude on the grooves at all and has no effect on the recorded audio. It is an acoustically recorded 10-inch diameter 78-RPM brownish red Durium paper/resin disc with lateral grooves and a Â¼â spindle hole. The record catalog number is Hit of the Week 1088. The A-side recording features the Vincent Lopez (1895-1975) Orchestra directed by Hymie Wolfson playing the foxtrot âLittle White Liesâ by Walter Donaldson (1893-1947). The vocalist is Lew Conrad and it runs 2 minutes and 38 seconds. The album was recorded in July 1930 and released by HOTW on September 11, 1930. Les Docks sets the value at $3-$6 and there is one dealer selling it on EBay for $4.\n\nDonaldson originally wrote the 1930 foxtrot âLittle White Liesâ for Fred Waringâs Pennsylvanians, who recorded it on July 25, 1930 for Victor, with Clare Hanlon providing the vocals. As this HOTW version attests, several artists ended up recording the popular tune in 1930, including â besides Lopez on HOTW â Ted Wallace on Columbia, Earl Burtnett on Brunswick, Johnny Marvin on Victor, Marion Harris on Brunswick, Lee Morse on Columbia, and Harry Reser and Annette Hanshaw on budget labels like HOTW. Jesse Crawford recorded an instrumental organ cover for Victor in 1930, as well. Ella Fitzgerald recorded a version of it for Decca in 1939 with Chick Webbâs orchestra. The greatest heights that the song achieved on the US charts was when a 1947 recording of the tune by Dick Haymes for Decca lasted 23 weeks on the Billboard charts, peaking at #3 in 1948. Dinah Shoreâs 1947 cover of it for Columbia records lasted one week on the charts at #28 and a 1957 version on Bally Records by Betty Johnson lasted one week at #25 in that year. The song was a hit overseas, too, with Ruby Murray recording it for UK Columbia in 1957 and Eartha Kitt doing likewise in 1963 for the same label. According to Paul McCartney the song was a favorite of both him and John Lennon when they were growing up in Liverpool, and likely had some influence on their later output.\n\nDonaldson, the son of a piano teacher, began writing original music for school productions as a young boy, demonstrated sheet music for customers in five-and-dime stores, and accompanied nickelodeon films in his neighborhood in Brooklyn. He saw his first published work when he was 22 and continued to perform, even after his enlistment in the Army, when he would entertain troops and play the piano at War Bond rallies. After his service in the Army during World War I Donaldson was picked up by the Irving Berlin Music Company to be one of their stable of in-house songwriters, a gig he kept until 1928 when he set up his own music publishing company. Around the same time he moved from New York to Hollywood, to join many of his fellow Tin Pan Alley songwriters in composing music for the burgeoning film industry; his film music credits include Glorifying the American Girl, Suzi, The Great Ziegfeld, Panama Hattie, Follow the Boys, and Nevada. By the time of his death in 1947 the tremendously prolific Donaldson had penned around 600 original songs, including some major smash hits that are synonymous with Tin Pan Alley and the music of the 1930s to this very day: âMy Blue Heaven,â âYes Sir, Thatâs My Babyâ recorded by John Pizzarelli, âMy Baby Just Cares for Me,â âIâve Had My Momentsâ made famous by Frank Sinatra, âYouâre Driving Me Crazyâ rendered by Mel Torme, âMakinâ Whoopee,â and âLove Me or Leave Meâ sung by Lena Horne. Remarkably, Donaldsonâs publishing company is still in existence to this day and maintains a terrific website with the composerâs complete biography, his catalog with representative recordings (including a 1995 recording of Julie London singing âLittle White Liesâ for Liberty records), and information about licensing any of the composterâs 600 odd songs.\n\nLopez, like Donaldson, was a Brooklyn kid. The song of Portuguese immigrants, Lopez was on track to become a priest before he found a new calling in music and formed his own dance orchestra in 1917. With Lopez at the piano, the band played numerous hotel and dance gigs throughout New York City. Lopezâs piano technique has been called âflamboyant and floridâ and was a direct influence on later performers on the instrument, including Liberace. Numerous musicians who would later go on to fame in their own right spent some time in Lopezâs band, including Artie Shaw, Xavier Cugat, Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, Rudy Vallee, and Glenn Miller. In November 1921 the Lopez orchestra became one of the first to broadcast a regular radio program â a 90-minute weekly show on WJZ out of Newark. The notoriety from the show propelled Lopez to the front line of famous bandleaders of the 1940s and secured both his band and himself roles in a number of the hottest musical movies of the 1940s.\n\nIn 1941 Lopez and his band began a long-term residency as the house band of the Hotel Taft in New York City, delighting audiences into the late 1950s with swing, dance tunes, Dixieland jazz, country-western, and even, in the 1950s, with rock and roll songs. The liner notes to a âBest of the Big Bandsâ CD compilation from the 1990s offers this description of the show at the Taft:\n\nThe Lopez band practically defined the style of popular hotel orchestras of the timeâ¦Lopez was also an innovator when it came to the audience participation stunts that generated publicity. Wednesdays through Fridays, for instance, Lopez would have everybody in stitches at the Grill Room with his âShake the Maracasâ show, in which people came great distances to demonstrate their personal skill with the maracas and compete for such prizes as miniature piano cigarette lighters and autographed photos of the bandleader. On many an afternoon, tourists (and hooky-playing office workers) would head off to the Taft for an hour-long 1:00 PM dance session, often broadcast as âLuncheon With Lopezâ over the Mutual Radio Network. He even sponsored âFashions in Music,â a weekly afternoon fashion show in which models would display the latest in day and evening wear to the instrumental melodies of the band. Such novelties may have diminished the impact of his music, but it never affected his pocketbook â or his ability to hire the best musicians in town. For many years, a spot in the Lopez band was a real plum for a musician who also desired a stable family life; the show at the Taft always ended at 9:00 PM sharp, giving a sideman ample time to change into street clothes and be home in time to kiss the kids goodnight and watch the eleven oâclock news.\n\nLew Conrad was, like Donaldson, the son of a musical family, with both parents sharing a background as vocalists. They decided they did not want their son to be a â gasp â singer, so they had him take up the violin instead. Conrad was promoted by his parents as a violin prodigy for the vaudeville circuit, but he really did not enjoy that realm of the entertainment world. After graduating from Tufts Conrad took his violin to the Cleveland Symphony for a year, before landing a singing and violin gig with the Leo Reisman Band. Conrad also did recording sessions with the studio orchestras of Nat Shilkret and Ben Selvin, until, in 1929, he landed an audition for NBC, who offered him a contract. Conradâs fame peaked between 1931 and 1933, shortly after he recorded this record for HOTW. His musical performances were being heard nationwide nine times a week on NBC network radio and in 1933 his band was featured in an installment of a series of musical film shorts. His fame seemed to have tapered off, for unknown reasons, into the late 1930s, with the last news account of the band performing coming in 1941.\n\nDuring times of severe economic hardship the American people have gone with less or gone without, but our innate appetite for entertainment seems to persist, albeit in a diminished form. Consider the last twelve years of movie attendance: during the recession in 2008 1.37 billion tickets were sold at cinemas, just about the same as the number sold in 2000, before the recession after 9/11/2001. At the same time, the dollar amount spent on tickets when considering those two years increased by $2.37 billion â or 32%. This means that despite a tremendous jump in ticket prices and the hit to the economy, people were still willing to shell out for a movie ticket. The HOTW story, as a label, illustrates is just how truly awful the Great Depression was for the average American family. Despite our national natural thirst for escapism entertainment even the cheapest record label of the period felt the sting of the economic collapse. And while Americans were turning to new forms of entertainment around the same time â âtalkieâ film features, for example â the notion that the industry that was then, and is still today, our leading entertainment industry couldnât cope is a telling piece of evidence of the disruption of the Depression. On a lighter note, I think any record collector with a stack of HOTW albums in their collection would tell you that the audio quality is generally just as good as their vinyl discs. And theyâre a hell of a lot easier to move â and less likely to shatter when you drop one by mistake, as you will inevitably do. Perhaps if the Depression had not been as bad as it was Durium records would have replaced shellac more broadly as the preferred material for record albums. Considering the trajectory of recorded music, from 78-RPM to LP to tapes and CDs, it is interesting to imagine what innovations would have happened, not happened, or happened differently, if the principle medium of recording was so changed.\n\nThis weekâs entry on Zaydeâs Turntable: the first platinum film album in American history, featuring two extremely popular songs from an early 20th century feature, performed by an artist called âthe worldâs greatest entertainer.â\n\nThe record is a Brunswick label. Brunswick records were issued starting around 1916 by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company of Dubuque, Iowa, as an after thought to their line of phonographs. Brunswick was an early adapter of the lateral cut system and, thanks to an aggressive marketing campaign by the company, Brunswick records were in the âBig Three,â along with Victor and Columbia, for a number of years. Their acoustically recorded records were among the highest quality of the period, but the company made a miscalculation with the advent of electrically recorded albums. In 1925 Brunswick introduced their electrical recording technology, which they called the âLight-Ray Processâ (it utilized photoelectric cells).\n\nThe audio quality was dismal, the records flopped, and hundreds of recordings made using the new system were never issued. In time Brunswickâs engineers were able to improve the failures in their recording technologies and the company moved quickly to attempt to recover the market share they had lost to Columbia and Victor in the interim. It was around this time that the Chicago-based label released some of their most acclaim albums (including this one) from their leading artists â Al Jolson, Duke Ellington, Ben Bernie, and more. The two genres that Brunswick became especially known for in this time was their ârace seriesâ of cutting-edge jazz, urban and rural blues, and gospel performances, and their very highly regarded classical music recordings of some of the leading orchestras and conductors of the era, including Toscanini. In 1930 the company sold the Brunswick label to Warner Brothers, who planned on utilizing it for film soundtrack recordings employing a âsound-on-discâ system they called Vitaphone. The combination of the industry standard shifting to the sound-on-film system and the Great Depression resulted in Warner Brothersâ decision to sell the brand to the American Record Corporation. ARC elevated Brunswick to their flagship label, selling the records for 75-cents, compared to 35-cents for their other brand records, and reserving the label for their biggest artists: Bing Crosby, Cab Calloway, the Mills Brothers, Duke Ellington, and others. In a convoluted industry deal ARC transferred the brand partially to CBS â who discontinued it in 1940 â and partially to Decca, which used it to release previous recordings and new records of rock and roll and rhythm and blues titles. The label finally âdiedâ in 1982 following legal troubles. In the course of its lengthy life, Brunswick released about 67 different 78-RPM labels worldwide.\n\nThis album is in Fair condition; it has a slight dip that bulges the record slightly near one edge. Such bulging is not uncommon and often occurs from improper storage, excessive heat, or a combination of thereof; there is a technique to fix a warped disc like this â it involves a low-temperature oven, the flat back of a cookie sheet, and a very stead hand; I have not attempted it with this album and I do not intend to. The warp results in a distinct repetitive fluctuation in the music, especially on the A-side track. It is an acoustically recorded 10-inch diameter 78-RPM black vinyl disc with lateral grooves and a Â¼â spindle hole. The record catalog number is Brunswick 4033. The A-side recording features âThe Worldâs Greatest Entertainer With Orchestraâ Al Jolson (1886-1950) singing âSonny Boy,â the âtheme song from the motion picture âThe Singing Fool.ââ The song was written by Jolson, George âBuddyâ DeSylva (1895-1950), and Ray Henderson (1896-1970), with lyrics by Lew Brown (1893-1958). The track runs 3 minutes and 6 seconds. The B-side recording is Jolson again, including a âwhistling chorusâ by the performer (listen to the link to the full song, not just the clip below, in order to hear Jolsonâs impressive whistling), in the song âThereâs A Rainbow âRound My Shoulder,â also from The Singing Fool. âRainbowâ was written by Jolson, Billy Rose (1899-1966), and Dave Dreyer (1894-1967). It runs 2 minutes and 36 seconds. The album was recorded on August 20, 1928, the same year The Singing Fool was released. Brunswick 4033 was the first record of a film song in history to sell more than one million copies. It is one of a rare handful of albums that were recorded by popular artists â who are still popular or famous today â and were tremendous hits and that are of some monetary value (albeit slight, as is true for most all 78-RPM records, even the most collectible). Les Docks values it at $7-$10 and there are two dealers selling it on EBay for $5, one more at $10, and one at $11.\n\nBorn Asa Yoelson in Russia, Al emigrated to America in 1894 with his family, settling outside Washington, D.C., where his father was a rabbi and cantor. After his motherâs death that same year, Asa and his brother Hirsch began singing for coins on street corners using the Americanized names Al and Harry. In 1902 he joined Walter Mainâs Circus, initially as an usher, but was soon given a singing role. When the circus folded in 1903 Jolson picked up a part in the burlesque show Dainty Duchess Burlesquers. When the burlesque show also folded within a year Jolson decided to put together his own act, forming a vaudeville partnership with his brother Harry. It was as part of their act that, in 1904 while performing in Brooklyn, that Jolson decided to try wearing blackface as part of his act; it was a tremendous success, but the act fell apart after Harry and Al had a falling out and Al struck out on his own in 1906. From there Al found success as a solo blackface vaudevillian, performing in San Francisco and New York. It was on stage at the Winter Garden Theater in New York in 1911 that Jolson truly became a celebrity, with an unbroken string of box office smashes, the distinction of becoming the highest paid performer in show business by 1920, and, at the young age of 35, his very own theater on Broadway â making Jolson the youngest man in American history to have a theater named after him. Jolsonâs acts consisted of both songs and comedy, but it was the musical portions that largely built his recording career. His initial contract, with Columbia, resulted in several dozen top selling records, but it was after he left for Brunswick in 1924 that he recorded the album featured in this weekâs blog post. His Columbia recordings were largely of his theatrical songs; when he retired from the stage in 1926 and began focusing more on film his recordings likewise changed, so his Brunswick albums consisted more of his film songs.\n\nJolson has been called one of the most influential and important singers and performers in American history. His stylings and performances of jazz, blues, and ragtime standards and new songs alike had a significant influence on later singers of the 20th century, including Bing Crosby, Judy Garland, Bob Dylan, Jackie Wilson, and even Jerry Lee Lewis, among many, many others. He was, without question, the most famous â and highest paid â American entertainer of the 1930s. Even before his largest smash hit, the film The Jazz Singer, in 1927, and his tremendous successes of the 1930s Jolson had already released, since 1911, 80 hit records, conducted 16 national and international tours, and sold out nine shows at the Winter Garden in a row. The brash, extroverted performer was known for his highly sentimental, almost melodramatic approach to songs. Jolson was the first performer to actively engage with his audience when performing, using a stage runway that ran out into the audience, which he would run up and down and perform upon, often singing to specific individuals in the audience. It was a new style and one that would lay the foundation for both the modern American musical and rock icons like Elvis Presley, who would later adapt Jolsonâs performance techniques and âcharacterâ.\n\nInterestingly it was in his blackface performances that Jolson truly stood out as a talented performer and they were, by his own account, some of his most enjoyable performances. Unlike other blackface actors of the period, however (such as Billy Golden and the Kaufman brothers, whom I have discussed in previous posts), Jolsonâs blackface act did not lampoon or satirize black people. Rather, by bringing a simultaneously dynamic and sensitive approach to his blackface act Jolson felt he was at once celebrating the true energy and spirit of jazz and blues music and liberating himself as a performer to truly become a whole new person. Indeed Jolson has been credited with leading the fight against anti-black discrimination on Broadway from as early as 1911 and his efforts helped make possible the careers of such black musicians as Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Fats Waller, and Ethel Waters. Growing up Jolson was a close friend of Bill âBojanglesâ Robinson and in 1911, at the age of 25, he helped black playwright Garland Anderson produce one of Andersonâs works, which became the first play with an all-black cast ever produced on Broadway. After his fame, and clout, grew, Jolson pushed to feature all-black dance troupes in his stage act and fought for equal treatment for Calloway when the two performed together in the film The Singing Kid. It was even said that there were black nightclubs in Harlem to which no white would be admitted â except Jolson. When Jolson died countless black actors lined the funeral processions and Noble Sissle, president of the Negro Actors Guild at the time, attended the funeral on the groupâs behalf. Jolsonâs blackface act helped bridge a cultural gap between white and black America by introducing black musical stylings such as jazz, blues, and ragtime, to white audiences.\n\nMost music historians think one of the key facets that made Jolsonâs blackface performance disarmingly non-offensive was that it was, whether intentional or not, an illustration of the mutual suffering shared by both blacks and Jews in America. The metaphor of the Jewish entertainer donning blackface was not lost on contemporary observers of Jolsonâs work. For example, after seeing Jolsonâs stage show, the writer Samson Raphaelson said âMy God, this isnât a jazz singer. This is a cantor!â From that image Raphaelson penned the story of The Jazz Singer, Jolsonâs largest hit film and the first full-length picture with sound, in which Jolson portrayed the son of a cantor who wants nothing more than to become a jazz singer. One film critic astutely reflected:\n\nâIs there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not. Indeed, I detected again and again the minor key of Jewish music, the wail of the Chazan, the cry of anguish of a people who had suffered. The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the worldâs history.â\n\nBlack audiences responded to The Jazz Singer with acclaim. A crowd at the Lafayette Theater in Harlem wept during the film and the Harlem newspaper Amsterdam News raved of Jolson that âevery colored performer is proud of himâ and of the film that it was âone of the greatest pictures ever producedâ\n\nJolson would return to the concept of a shared oppression between Jewish and African American peoples, especially in terms of how they suffered in a new land, in his film Big Boy. Jolson, in blackface, plays a former slave who leads a group of recently freed slaves (all played by black actors) in the slave spiritual âGo Down Moses.â One contemporary critic of Big Boy keenly observed:\n\nâWhen one hears Jolsonâs jazz songs, one realizes that jazz is the new prayer of the American masses, and Al Jolson is their cantor. The Negro makeup in which he expresses his misery is the appropriate talis [prayer shawl] for such a communal leader.â\n\nJolson, who was politically conservative â a rarity amongst Hollywood and Broadway stars, especially Jewish entertainers â was keenly interested in supporting Americaâs fighting men. As early as 1922 he held a hugely successful benefit performance at the Century Theater in New York, with the proceeds raised going to aid Jewish veterans of World War I. During World War II he was the first major star to travel abroad to entertain the American troops and, during the Korean War, he went overseas to perform for the troops again. The trip to Korea â 42 shows in just over two weeks â was grueling and, just a few weeks after returning to the U.S., he died from the exertion. As a result of his service to the troops the U.S. military awarded him (posthumously) the Medal of Merit.\n\nThe Singing Fool (1928) held the box office record for attendance for 10 years, when it was broken by Disneyâs Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Its worldwide gross of $5.9 million made it Warner Brothersâ most financially successful film for 13 years, until 1941âs Sergeant York. The Singing Fool, produced by Warner Brothers, solidified both the idea of sound in film as a standard practice from that point forward (many audiences were forced to watch The Jazz Singer without sound as few movie theaters were equipped to play any sound in 1927) and advanced the genre of musical film in general. However The Singing Fool, like The Jazz Singer, was actually only partially synchronized with recorded music and spoken dialogue â Jolsonâs first all-talking film, Say It With Songs, would be released in 1929 â and in some places was even released and shown as a completely âsilentâ film.\n\nIn addition to âSonny Boyâ and âThereâs A Rainbow âRound My Shoulder,â the next most famous Jolson tune from The Singing Fool is arguably âIâm Sittinâ On Top Of The World.â Many of the songs from the film were tremendous hits when sold on record, piano role, or sheet music. It was an all-around commercial triumph for Jolson and for Warner Brothers. In the film Jolson plays Al Stone, a struggling singing waiter. Stone finally gets his big break when, on one night, his performance wows a big-shot producer and the showgirl that he fancies. Stone is catapulted to stardom, marrying the gold-digging girl and finding Broadway success. In typical melodramatic form, however, fame does not bring Stone happiness: Stoneâs fickle wife leaves the performer, taking their son, whom he calls Sonny Boy, with her. The heartbroken singer falls from stardom and must rely on his old friends from the speakeasy where he got his modest start to save him from a dismal life on the hard streets.\n\nâSonny Boyâ was the first song from a movie to sell over a million copies, eventually topping over 3 million copies sold of its record, piano roll, and sheet music (the first record of any type to break the 1 million mark was an Enrico Caruso album from 1904). The Brunswick recording held the #1 spot on the U.S. charts for an impressive 12 weeks. The heavily melodramatic tearjerker, sung by Jolson to his son in the film, has had surprisingly few covers since his 1928 recording: the Andrews Sisters cover of the song in 1941 reached #22 on the charts and a 1955 Arlid Andresen version, on piano, guitar, and bass, appeared in a medley of melodies released on the His Masterâs Voice Label.\n\nâThereâs A Rainbow âRound My Shoulderâ, âSonny Boy,â and âIâm Sitting On Top Of The World,â were the three biggest hits of The Singing Fool. Jolson had a hand in the composition of âRainbowâ and it became one of his more recognizable trademark tunes and a staple of his stage performances and his shows abroad for U.S. troops. Among other artists to cover the tune were Donald Peers, with dual pianos, in 1949, which was released on His Masterâs Voice, and Bobby Darin, who recorded a version in 1962 that was released by Capitol Records.\n\nThereâs a lot that could be written about Jolson â about his personal life and relationships, his works, his influence of later performers, his use of blackface, his pioneering work to bring sound into the movies, his efforts to advocate for and defend black entertainers and musicians when it was socially and professionally risky, and even his role in U.S. politics and presidential campaigns. If you would like to find out more about the âworldâs greatest entertainerâ (if not perhaps one of its most important), there are many other outlets online and in print to do so. Iâm immensely pleased to have this and a few other Jolson records in my collection â indeed, I cannot imagine any library of important, or even standard, recordings from the early 20th century of American music, could considered complete without some of these Jolson classics. Iâll simply close with a quote from Jolsonâs friend, the actor George Jessel, who was speaking the eulogy at Jolsonâs funeral in 1950 after the 64 year old singer had died.\n\nâThe history of the world does not say enough about how important the song and the singer have been. But history must record the name Jolson, who in the twilight of his life sang his heart out in a foreign land, to the wounded and to the valiant. I am proud to have basked in the sunlight of his greatness, to have been part of his time.â\n\nThis weekâs album was again drawn at random from my collection and provides perhaps one of the only recordings of an obscure tune largely lost to history and an early recording of one of the most popular jazz songs ever written, with the normally sung lyrics replaced by a truly unique and remarkable trumpet performance.\n\nThe label is the Decca âsunburstâ â Decca had, very generally speaking, three styles of label: sunburst, flat blue, and flat black. Sunburst labels are usually of more interest to collectors as they mark the earliest records issued by the company (from its formation in 1934 through 1937). On sunburst labels an art deco style âDeccaâ pops out with block letters and a false perspective angle. Decca would later reissue many of their sunburst recordings on the flat blue and flat black labels after 1937. Because of the tremendous quantity of Decca records issued after 1937 and the overall higher value attributed with first issues compared to re-issues, sunburst labels are usually of greater monetary value. This is comparable to what happened with Victor: savvy collectors know that if a Victor label is a plain circle it is almost certainly of little to no value and is very likely to be a reissue. Victor âscrollâ labels, on the other hand, are older and more likely to be original issues.\n\nThis album is in Fair condition; there is a hairline crack through the disc at about 8 oâclock, however the needle on my Crosley Archiver was able to navigate it without difficulty. It is an electrically recorded 10-inch diameter 78-RPM black vinyl disc with lateral grooves and a Â¼â spindle hole. The record catalog number is Decca 620 A/B and the master number is 60065A/60063A. The A-side recording features the jazz fox trot âBasin Street Blues,â written by Spencer Williams (1889-1965); it runs 2 minutes and 59 seconds. The B-side recording features the fox trot with vocal chorus âIâm Gonna Play in the Varsity Band,â written by Walter G. Samuels (1903-1994), Leonard Whitcup (1903-1979), and Teddy Powell (1905-1993); it runs 2 minutes and 37 seconds. The artist on both sides is jazz trumpeter and bandleader Clyde McCoy (1903-1990) and his orchestra. The album was recorded on October 14, 1935. Other owners of the album are selling it online for $1, $3, $4 (not the âsunburstâ version, however), $4.25, and $5. Les Docks sets its value at $7-$10, which â given the prices for it online â seems a bit generous.\n\nClyde McCoy, of the Hatfield and McCoy feud McCoys, grew up in Kentucky but moved to Ohio as a young boy with his parents. In Ohio he took up the trumpet and quickly moved from playing at church and school functions to performing on the riverboats. After a successful temporary gig at a Knoxville Resort, McCoy proposed taking the same band to New York. When success in the Big Apple eluded the band they headed west, first to Los Angeles, and eventually to Chicago. It was in the Windy City where he first performed his best know song, âSugar Blues,â which was written for him by Clarence Williams and Lucy Fletcher; the song placed on the charts in 1931, 1935, and again as late as 1941. Later musicians, including Fats Waller, Ella Fitzgerald, and Johnny Mercer also covered it. Near overnight radio success with the original recording led to contracts first with Columbia and later Decca in 1935 (the same year this album was recorded, making it one of the earlier Decca records from McCoy). McCoyâs act grew in complexity and became almost vaudevillian in nature, including tremendous âbattle of the bandsâ type face-offs between McCoyâs band and another A-list group of the time. All of these battles ended as âfriendly ties.â\n\nMcCoyâs most lasting influence on music was not any one song but, rather, a musical effect. A talented trumpet player, McCoy could create an amazing variety of sounds and effects with his advanced technique; foremost, and most popular with audiences, was the distinctive âwah wahâ sound, created by fluttering a specific type of horn mute in the bell of his trumpet (I read some unconfirmed accounts that he actually used a toilet plunger, not a mute). You can hear it distinctly at 1:53 in âIâm Gonna Play in the Varsity Bandâ below and throughout âBasin Street Bluesâ (click on the link to the Vogue Picture Record recording of it elsewhere online). The effect became so popular and such a recognizable trademark sound for McCoy that the Thomas Organ Company built it into the Vox Clyde McCoy Wah-Wah Pedal for electric guitar in the mid 1960s. The Clyde McCoy Pedal, later named a Cry Baby Pedal, has become a staple effect for guitarists of all genres. In 2002 Vox reissued the Clyde McCoy Pedal with its original vintage look, including with McCoyâs image and signature on the bottom â a feature that the original pedal from the 1960s sported as well. If you regularly skip listening to the clips or the links to the full recordings on this blog, this is not one to miss â McCoyâs talents with the trumpet are quite unique and well worth a listen.\n\nSpencer Williams was a composer, singer, and pianist who helped author some of the earliest standards of the American jazz era. Born in New Orleans Williams was one of the chief collaborators for Fats Waller. In addition to âBasin Street Bluesâ â perhaps his most enduring song (it is still being recorded by musicians to this day â he penned âSqueeze Me,â âSheâll Be Cominâ Around That Mountain,â âI Ainât Got Nobody,â âRoyal Garden Blues, and âIâve Found a New Babyâ among many, many others.\n\nâBasin Street Bluesâ is a standard of Dixieland jazz bands to this day. It was published in 1926 but really became famous when Louis Armstrong issued a recording of it in 1928. Basin Street is the main thoroughfare of Storyville, which had been the red-light district of New Orleansâ French Quarter from 1870 through the early decades of the 20th century. McCoyâs recording became part of his portfolio of trademark songs and proved so popular it was later reissued on a Vogue Picture Record in 1946 (click the link to see a video of the record, with McCoyâs picture on it, and also listen to the recording in its entirety).\n\nThe song has been recorded by Bob Wills, Ben Pollack, Tommy Duncan, Louis Prima, Dr. John, Connee Boswell with Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald with the Sy Oliver Orchestra, Jo Stafford and Frankie Laine, saxophonist David Sanborn, âturntablistâ Kid Koala, Sam Cooke, Jack Teagarden, and Liza Minnelli. Some may also recognize the tune from its more recent use on the soundtrack to the major feature film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. The songâs lyrics went through an interesting, albeit temporary, metamorphosis in the mid-1950s that is quite revealing of the prevailing attitudes towards race relations at that precise time in American society: the lyric referring to Basin Street as the place where âthe dark and light folksâ meet was altered to the less controversial line that it is the place where âthe young and old folksâ meet. Thankfully most contemporary recordings (after the Civil Rights era) returned to the original lyrics as Williams wrote them. The McCoy recording, as you might have guessed, replaces the vocal line with McCoyâs own remarkable performance on the trumpet.\n\nIf âBasin Street Bluesâ is an enduring standard still recorded to this day, than âIâm Gonna Play in the Varsity Bandâ is the complete opposite. The song was entered into copyright on September 21, 1935 by Chappell and Company of New York. I can find no other mention of it being recorded by any artist excepting this one by McCoy for Decca. The tune is an up-beat song about how a musician will win the girls and make the football playersâ jealous through his skills in the college band: band geekâs revenge, Tin Pan Alley-style. It is not a bad song, but simply proved unmemorable and never became a commercial success, despite the fact that one might assume it would be popular with college pep bands of the time. If it was, there is no record of it being performed and no other recording of it by any such band that I could locate.\n\nWalter Samuels was an enormously prolific composer, who wrote music for films and television starting in 1932 (Blondie of the Follies) and ending in 1989 (Harlem Nights with Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor). Interestingly there was a sizable gap between his song âChuck a Luckinâ on the soundtrack to People Are Funny in 1946 and his tune âMarch Winds and April Showersâ for a 1978 episode of Pennies from Heaven. In all he wrote 32 songs that eventually appeared on a soundtrack. A review of his soundtrack songs, his works for Broadway, and his singles reveals no real chart-toppers.\n\nLike Samuels, Whitcup wrote numerous songs (23 in all) that appeared on film and television soundtracks from 1932 (again, Blondie of the Follies) through 2008, when his tune âFrom the Vine Came the Grapeâ was used posthumously for the TV movie Thatâs Amore!. Indeed many of his songs continued to be used in soundtracks after his death in 1979, including what is probably his most famous number: the song âFrenesi,â written in 1939, which appears on the soundtrack to 1980âs Raging Bull.\n\nTeddy Powell, born Teodoro Paolella, was a jazz guitarist, big band leader, and composer. Powell started as a violinst, then moved to the banjo, and finally picked up the guitar and formed his own band at the age of 15. The band stayed intact for 24 years â a remarkable feat in the 1930s and 1940s, when most groups were dissolving, dividing, and reorganizing on an almost yearly basis. Powellâs band was not one of the big A-list gigs, reaching fame for only one brief period in 1939, though they were able to hire on some highly regarded musicians from other top orchestras â including Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorseyâs. They may have gone upward from that 1939 point, but a tragic fire at a New Jersey nightclub where they were playing in 1941 destroyed all of their instruments. The group never recovered and dissolved in 1944, just missing out on the high-water mark for big band music in the early 1940s.\n\nIn researching âIâm Gonna Play in the Varsity Bandâ I was not surprised to discover almost no information about it online â no recording history, no critical reviews, no references to its performance, no complete recordings, and no description of its lyrics. It is, for all intents, a song that never existed outside of this Decca record. Indeed countless songs â thousands upon thousands â from the first decades of recorded music have likely suffered a similar fate, whether deserved or not. Therefore I have decided to post the lyrics and the entire song here on Zaydeâs Turntable, so that any future researcher who might â for whatever reason â have an interest in the tune will find it online, saved for posterity, in at least one location. It seems ironic that despite the hundreds of millions of websites today, not one has the details of this song, which is â after all â only 77 years old.\n\nRah! Rah! Rah Rah Rah!\n\nIâm gonna play in the varsity band,\n\nTo win the heart of my co-ed with melody.\n\nIâm gonna play in the varsity band,\n\nAnd make you football heroes jealous as can be.\n\nIâll never make the team,\n\nBut you can safely bet,\n\nIâll make my college win this game by playing my cornet.\n\nThe girlies cheer,\n\nâCause Iâm the band-leading man,\n\nIâm gonna play in the varsity band.\n\nRah! Rah! Rah Rah Rah!\n\nRah! Rah! Rah Rah Rah!\n\nRah! Rah! Rah Rah Rah!\n\nDecca 620 offers both an enduring classic and a song lost to history. Listening to it made me better understand that all recorded music â records, CDs, cassettes (even 8-tracks) â presents us with a complete program of songs selected for a reason and performed as a whole or in some order for (usually) a specific artistic purpose. I love iTunes and the ability of the listener to craft their own song lists; and the release of singles is, of course, a long-standing practice of the music industry, but thereâs something to be said for taking an âalbumâ in whatever form and appreciating all (or both) of the songs on it as an artistic whole. If nothing else it forces us, as listeners, to keep songs that would otherwise be lost to time for whatever reason â be they ahead of their time and not fitting with popular taste in the day when they were released or be they simply bad. No matter why, if we wanted âBasin Street Bluesâ we would need to have âIâm Gonna Play in the Varsity Band,â too. Both of them would be on our turntables, if only one of them would stay in our minds and in our ears.\n\nThis weekâs selection is by special request from none other than Zayde himself! My collection includes a number of single albums by the prolific and immensely talented comic musician Spike Jones, the self-described âman who murdered musicâ (for our younger readers, imagine a mid 20th century Weird Al Yankovic). Rather than feature just one of these records, however, Iâve decided to feature a compilation.\n\nâMusical Depreciationâ is a bound set of five standard electrically recorded 10-inch diameter 78-RPM black vinyl discs with lateral grooves and Â¼â spindle holes. The musician on all the records is âMaestroâ Spike Jones and his City Slickers. The records themselves are housed in plain brown paper sleeves that are bound together in a cardboard book that measures about 12â wide by 10-3/8â tall by 5/8â deep. The cover has a full color caricature illustration of Spike Jones, wielding a popgun and surrounded by musical instruments. The front and back boards are blue with a red paper over the spine and the album title and artist name appearing in gold lettering down the side. The cover shows some wear but the majority of the rubbing and damage is along the binderâs edges and corners, as well as the spine. Neither the set nor the individual albums (nor any Spike Jones album, for that matter) appear in Les Docksâ valuation guide for collectible 78-RPM records, however I was able to find three dealers selling the set online for $19, $40, and $50.\n\nThe set was issued by RCA Victor, one of the many labels and brands of the Radio Corporation of America and Victor. Victor, of course, is perhaps the most prolific record company of the 20th century. The companyâs history and diversity of labels are, as was the case with Columbia, far too long and complicated to detail here. I will point out that RCA Victor issued a number of sets of records with the exact same dimensions, color schemes, and even typeface on the spine as âMusical Depreciation.â Bound sets such as this one were a way for a record company to issue a compilation of songs by one artist (or, with their classical records, to release a multiple movement symphony in one package). The key with bound sets, however, is that they are almost never the first issue of a particular recording. In order to be worth the expense that the binder and artwork entailed, companies would only issue works and artists that had already had proven commercial success. Despite the fact they are âreissuesâ of previously released recordings, bound sets today are not terribly common. The great irony is that many record sellers would remove the records from the set, discard the binder, and sell them individually; the end result is a glut of A-list musiciansâ records â all represses and individually mostly without any collectability or value â that, had they been kept in their original album, might actually be more valuable.\n\nThe illustration on the cover is by the artist Frank Decker. I could find almost nothing about the personal life of this 1940s-1960s illustrator in my research. Decker was an in-house RCA Victor album illustrator, though he was not the companyâs only such artist. Album artwork today is for many as collectible as the records themselves â for some, in fact, it is more so, and album covers with no records in them at all can sometimes fetch far more than the associated record in a plain sleeve with no illustration. Decker was heavily influenced by the man who supposedly originated the concept of album artwork: Alex Steinweiss, the in-house illustrator for Columbia records. Steinweiss, who passed away last year at the age of 94, was a member of the Columbia advertising department when he was approached by some of the company executives in 1939 to develop strategies to improve record sales. His first illustrated album cover, for a collection of Rogers and Hart songs, was a massive success and Columbia moved quickly to re-release their most popular albums to that point with new illustrated covers; in most cases sales increased by nearly ten times their previous level for the same record.\n\nThe other record companies were quick to catch on to the concept and began releasing (and re-releasing) their own compilations and solo albums in the new illustrated album cover or sleeve in the 1940s. Decker, who was with RCA Victor, based his illustrations on the same style and sentiment that Steinweiss had popularized: geometric patterns, bold solid colors, and whimsical or fantastical depictions of scenery or other elements illustrative of the album content. Deckerâs most famous works were probably his classical music album covers, which captured creative, fantastic scenes in a style that was remarkably at once both rigid and fanciful. The illustrations took liberties with scenes and people and the earliest reviews of the pieces I could find â in Billboard magazine from 1947 â indicate that some in the music industry, while impressed with the artwork, were a bit confused with Deckerâs (and presumably Steinweissâ) imaginative interpretations. Where Steinweiss remained primarily an album artist until the 1970s, when a more psychedelic style of artwork became the fad and he chose to retire, Decker apparently branched out early, doing magazine covers and advertising art as early as the mid 1940s, while also continuing to provide illustrations to album artwork well into the era of the 45-RPM.\n\nSpike Jones (1911-1965) was born Lindley Armstrong Jones and earned his nickname as a young boy when his fatherâs business colleagues at the Southern Pacific Railroad compared the thin boy to a railroad spike. He had an early affinity for music, getting his first drum set at the age of 11 and learning how to beat out rhythms from a chef in a railroad station restaurant who taught him how to play on pots and pans in the back kitchen. A short stint in theater orchestra pits led to a job playing drums for a number of larger bands, including as the percussionist on Bing Crosbyâs first recording of âWhite Christmas.â It was in the pit orchestras, however, where the young drummer discovered the niche market of novelty orchestras.\n\nJones was described as being, in private, a moody and ambitious man who was deeply interested in finding new ways to promote himself and build his own name in the public. Bringing together other musicians from his studio gigs, most importantly the vocalist and clarinetist Del Porter and violinist Carl Grayson â both relatively big names at the time â Jones assembled his own novelty band. Originally named the Feather Merchants, the group rechristened itself the City Slickers (after a Cindy Walker tune that Jones had played in the band for entitled âWeâre Gonna Stomp Them City Slickers Downâ). If in private he was broody recluse, in performance he was the consummate ham. Spike Jones and his City Slickers became infamous throughout the 1940s for their satirical arrangements of popular songs â from contemporary fox trots to classical works â and for utilizing a bizarre assortment of âinstrumentsâ including shotguns, birdcalls, police sirens, and cowbells.\n\nGreg Gormick tells of the moment that proved the bandâs break-through success:\n\nâThe big break came in 1942. Jonesâ RCA Victor recording contract of 1941 produced three initial recording sessions that yielded some interesting sides that didnât exactly set the music business on fire. But the fourth session included a song written for the Walt Disney cartoon, Donald Duck in Nutzi Land (click the still to the left to view the cartoon), which poked fun at Adolph Hitler and the Nazi scourge overrunning Europe. Take one ended with a trombone âschmeerâ effect after the last mention of der Feurher, but the second substituted a loud and rude âraspberryâ effect, which more accurately summed up how most Americans felt about Hitler. It was take two that was issued and it was Der Fuehrerâs Face that made Jones a household name. Played repeatedly by several famous American disc jockeys, it swept the country and soon spread abroad, reportedly even to Hitlerâs ears. It was that little something extra that Jones needed to grab the publicâs attention.â\n\nFollowing âDer Fuehrerâs Faceâ the group issued hit after hit. The band eventually took their show on tour around the U.S. and Canada in the late 1940s and early 1950s under the title The Musical Depreciation Revue. The group was so popular they even appeared on various radio programs from 1945 to 1949, and on television programs on both NBC and CBS from 1954 to 1961. In the end, Jones achieved his wish: a famous name, numerous records at the top of the charts, millions in sales, and a top-ticket touring and television act. As with contemporary satirists like Weird Al Yankovic, however, Jones was not always looked on fondly by the musicians whom he parodied; many songwriters tried to prevent Jones being allowed to create his âarrangementâ of their tune. Gormick, again, tells two interesting anecdotes that illustrate the tension between musician and mocker is nothing new to the American entertainment industry:\n\nâComposer Jerome Kern was furious at Jonesâ version of his late friend Gus Kahnâs Chloeâ¦ Kern thought the song was an insult to its lyricist and he urged Kahnâs widow, Grace, to pursue the matter. She thought it was hilarious and was pleased that it breathed new life into the corny song, telling Kern nicely to mind his own business. Not so good humoured was singer Vaughan Monroe, who was one of Victorâs top-selling artists in the late 1940s and a large stockholder. When Jones parodied his hit recording of Riders in the Sky, it ended with: âI can do without his singing, but I wish I had his dough.â To satisfy Monroe and Victor executives, the record was withdrawn and a new ending fabricated in the New York studios, with Spike nowhere in attendance. The original version still turns up and is a prized collectorsâ itemâ¦ In addition, Spike circulated copies of the full parody to disc jockeys, counting on the controversy to create the kind of publicity he savoured.â\n\nPopular taste changes in comedy perhaps quicker than any other form of entertainment, and Jones was no exception; the musical comic act was dying and being replaced by spoken word comedy recordings by the likes of Mort Sahl, Bob Newhart, and Tom Lehrer (Jones tried his hand at spoken word comedy on the LP âOmnibustâ but it was not a big hit). His popularity peaked by the mid-1950s and began a slow decline from there. Coupled with the large expense associated with a traveling revue featuring dozens of performers and Jonesâ choice to walk away from the Victor label the Spike Jones phenomenon plummeted. Jones, whose fodder was big band tunes and highly lampoonable pop music of the 1940s, was hurt by the rise of rock-n-roll in the 1950s and 1960s. There were attempts at childrenâs records (âSocko, the Smallest Snowball!â) and even a few serious music recordings under the moniker Spike Jonesâ New Band, but the bandleader failed to recapture the successes of his earlier period.\n\nThen, on May 1, 1965, at the age of 53, Jones â who smoked countless cigarettes every day, died from emphysema. Just as Jones had been influenced by the novelty orchestras (and the Marx Brothers) of the 1920s and 1930s, however, the City Slickers left an indelible impression on American culture and paved the way for performers such as Stan Freberg, Peter Schickeleâs P.D.Q. Bach, Frank Zappa, and, of course, Weird Al Yankovic. Even the Beatles, by way of the Goons, drew some inspiration from the drumming musical murderer from Southern California.\n\nInterestingly, of the three individuals selling this set online, not one of us has the same five records in the album. All are RCA Victor labels and all feature five of Spike Jones many records. This is because it was very common for owners of these albums to mix and change up the records that were stored in the album binders, often based on preference or simply replacing a damaged record with another one by the same artist. I have not been able to identify the exact recordings that comprised the album set as originally released. Below I provide the information about what is on each of the five records I have in the set, along with links to complete versions of the songs elsewhere online. I do not go much into detail about the writers or performers, but where there is some interesting comment about the song itself Iâve included that.\n\nDisc 1:\n\n20-3177-A âAll I Want for Christmas (Is My Two Front Teeth)â by Don Gardner, vocal refrain by George Rock (recorded December 6, 1948)\n\n20-3177-B âHappy New Yearâ by Eddie Brandt and Freddy Morgan, vocal refrain by Sir Frederick Gas, Doodles Weaver, George Rock, and Spike Jones (1948)\n\nThis disc does not appear in the sets of the other three versions I found and is probably a later addition to the âMusical Depreciationâ compilation I own. âAll I Want for Christmas is My Two Front Teeth,â one of Jonesâ most famous songs, was written in 1944 when Don Gardner, a music teacher in Smithtown, New York, asked his second grade class what they wanted for Christmas. He realized most the children were answering with a lisp because they were missing at least one of their front teeth. Thirty minutes later he had the song written. When he performed it in 1947 at a music teacherâs conference it was picked up by a representative of the Witmark Company and, ultimately, had its first recording (the one in this set) made by Jones and his band in 1948. To Gardnerâs utter amazement, it reached the top of the pop charts in 1949. It has since been covered by the likes of Danny Kaye with the Andrews Sisters, the Platters, Nat King Cole, the Three Stooges, the Chipmunks, and Count von Count of Sesame Street. How many other songs can say that?\n\nDisc 2:\n\n20-1893-A âThe Glow-Wormâ by Lilla Cayley Robinson and Paul Lincke, arranged by Spike Jones, vocal refrain by Red Ingle and Aileen Carlisle with chorus (1946)\n\n20-1893-B âHawaiian War Chant (Ta-Hu-Wa-Hu-Wai)â by Ralph Freed, Johnny Noble-Leleiohaku, vocal refrain by Spike Jones and his Wacky Wakakians with chorus (1946)\n\nIn the process of preparing this weekâs entry and digitizing the records in this set I was very saddened to discover that this particular record has a straight-line crack at about 7 oâclock rendering it entirely unplayable. Nevertheless, I included it here. Only one of the three dealers selling this set online also had this album in the compilation. âHawaiian War Chantâ was written in the 1860s by the Hawaiian prince Leleiohoku and was originally entitled âWe Two in the Spray,â with lyrics telling of two lovers, not a battle. In 1936 Ralph Freed changed it to English lyrics and Johnny Noble altered the melody, and the tune was performed by the Tommy Dorsey Band in the 1942 film Ship Ahoy. It was this version that Jones would lampoon in 1946, kicking up the tempo and changing the lyrics with Grayson doing the (uncredited) lead vocals. Jonesâ version reached #8 on the U.S. charts that year, yet another example of a Spike Jones satirical take on a pop song actually selling better than the original song itself. Freed and Nobleâs version proved more enduring, however, as Les Paul and Mary Ford, Sandi Griffiths, Sally Flynn, the Muppets, Nathan Lane (as Timon in The Lion King), Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys, and Weird Al Yankovic all recorded covers or adaptations of it. The song is in the regular repertoire of both the University of Hawaii Marching Band and the Michigan Marching Band. Finally, Disney has used it in two of their theme park attractions (the Enchanted Tiki Room at Disneyland and the Adventurers Clubâs Pleasure Island).\n\nDisc 3:\n\n20-1654-A âChloeâ by Gus Kahn and Neil Moret, featured in the Paramount picture âBring on the Girlsâ, vocal refrain by Red (Swamphead) Ingle (1945)\n\n20-1654-B âA Serenade to a Jerkâ by Del Porter and Carl Hoefle, vocal refrain by Judy Manners and Red (Jerk) Ingle (1945)\n\nThis album, with its two fox trots, appears in all three versions of the âMusical Depreciationâ set I could locate online, as well as in my own; therefore, I am fairly confident it was part of the original compilation issued by RCA Victor. Interestingly the label (which simply reads âVictorâ instead of âRCA Victorâ) differs from the other four albums in my set.\n\nâChloeâ reached a relatively unimpressive #441 in the U.S. charts when it was first released in 1927. That version, of course, was the original song â âChloe (Song of the Swamp)â, with music by Neil Moret and lyrics by Gus Kahn (see above for the anecdote related to Kahnâs friend, Jerome Kernâs, less than pleased reaction to the Spike Jones spoof). Jonesâ version would place in the top 5 on the charts in 1945, again illustrating the often powerful effect that satire could have for boosting a songâs popularity â albeit in an altered, and not always desired, form.\n\nThe film âBring on the Girlsâ was a moderately successful comedy starring Veronica Lake, Sonny Tufts, and Eddie Bracken. In the movie a millionaire joins the Navy hoping to find a girl who will marry him for himself and not his money; a beautiful gold-digger working at a resort hotel sets out to âget him.â\n\nDisc 4:\n\n20-1895-A âThat Old Black Magicâ by Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen, vocal refrain by Carl Grayson\n\n20-1895-B âLiebestraumâ by Del Porter and Franz Liszt, arranged by Spike Jones and Del Porter, vocal refrain by Red Ingle, narration by Richard Morgan\n\nThis album likewise appears in all three versions of the âMusical Depreciationâ set I could find online, as well as my own; therefore it was also likely part of the original compilation. While the Liszt spoof is quite entertaining âThat Old Black Magicâ was the more popular. Harold Arlen wrote the tune and Johnny Mercer the lyrics, and it was published in 1942, quickly becoming a very popular standard. The initial recordings in 1942 were made by Glenn Miller, Margaret Whiting, Frank Sinatra (the Chairman of the Board sang an altered version entitled âThe Old Jack Magicâ at a celebration for John F. Kennedy the night before his presidential inauguration), Sammy Davis Jr., Mercer himself, and Judy Garland, for whom Mercer actually intended the song when he wrote the words. The song placed in the top ten for two separate recordings (Millerâs and Whitingâs) in 1943 and went on to be recorded by just about every major singer of the 1940s-1960s. Ella Fitzgerald crooned it in 1961 and Billy Danielsâ 1950 version earned him the nickname âThe Old Black Magic Man.â Sammy Davis Jr. sang it on a guest cameo on I Dream of Jeannie and, perhaps most infamously, Marilyn Monroe sang it in the 1956 film Bus Stop. Who else? Jerry Lewis, Louis Prima, Dave Brubeck, Cab Calloway, Rosemary Clooney, Bing Crosby, Doris Day, Tony Bennett, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Johnny Mathis, Van Morrison, the Platters, Kevin Spacey, Mel Torme, Tom Jonesâ¦ Over 75 recorded versions (including Spike Jonesâ and one by the Muppets â Iâm noticing a pattern there) and five appearances on feature film soundtrack, background music on two episodes of Star Trek: Voyager, and as background music to the 1996 Miss Universe beauty pageant semifinals.\n\nDisc 5:\n\n20-2023-A âThe Jones Laughing Record (introducing The Flight of the Bumble Bee)â by Spike Jones and his City Snickers\n\n20-2023-B âMy Pretty Girlâ by Del Porter and Ray Johnson, vocal refrain by The Foursome, whistling by Gene Conklin\n\nMy apologies to the link to the song of âMy Pretty Girl.â The only recording I could find of it online was that one. There is a fun live performance of just the Spike Jones version of âFlight of the Bumblebeeâ to be found elsewhere, however. Again, this record does not appear in the other three sets of âMusical Depreciationâ I found online, suggesting it was probably added by a later owner of the compilation. The original âFlight of the Bumblebeeâ was an orchestral interlude by Rimsky-Korsakov written in 1899 for his opera The Tale of Tsar Saltan. The piece closed Act III, Tableau 1: the magic Swan-Bird changes the Prince into a bee so he may fly off to visit his father, who believes the prince is dead. The song is infamous for its highly technical complexity, consisting primarily of long runs of sixteenth notes. While the original composition (mercifully) split the runs up among the various orchestra instruments, later adaptations were crafted and arranged to showcase virtuosity on a single instrument by highly skilled musicians. Rachmaninoffâs transcription of the piece for piano is probably the most famous. Later musicians used it as a solo piece for violin, guitar, and â with Jonesâ recording â trombone.\n\n78-RPM recordings of novelty orchestras are normally of high monetary value, but Spike Jones and his City Slickers were so popular and so prolific that their albums were produced in huge quantity, making them almost without value to a collector. But, to a music enthusiast â especially one with a sense of humor â they are a must have for any collection of 20th century American records. Clever, fun, and upbeat, you are almost certain to at least crack a smile, if not burst out laughing, at each one. I had the great joy of putting this weekâs entry together with my toddler running around and it was wonderful to watch her laughing and dancing to these songs as I played each one in turn (she especially enjoyed âLiebestraumâ). So, click the links above to the songs in âMusical Depreciationâ â and then click around to the other Spike Jones recordings available online. Then put your feet up and laugh a little.\n\nThe last two featured records on Zaydeâs Turntable were, I must confess, selected with a little bit of deliberate purpose on my part. I liked the dichotomy of the John Gielgud performance of Oscar Wilde opposite the Billy Golden racist portrayal of âTurkey in the Straw.â This week, however, I have gone back to my original concept for this blog and selected a truly random album.\n\nNot surprisingly, having selected a record at random means the label of this record, Columbia, is one of the big three (Victor, Columbia, and Decca). The history of Columbia is far, far too long to delve in to here â it is, in fact, the oldest surviving record label still in existence. Briefly, it was founded by Edward Easton as the Columbia Phonograph Company in 1888, deriving its name from its original location in the District of Columbia. The company pioneered a number of critical advancements in recording technology, including âdouble-facedâ records (albums with a song on each side) in 1908 and the internal-horn gramophone that, ironically, became associated more with their competitor, the Victor brand. The history of Columbia, as far back as 1894, is one of mergers, acquisitions, and receivership. In its current form today Columbia is a brand of the Sony Corporation and is most commonly known for its sister subsidiary of Sony, the broadcast television network Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). Interestingly another Sony company, Columbia Pictures â the film studio â was originally not related to Columbia Records at all (it did issue records of its own, but on the Colpix and Arista labels). Columbia Records issued well over 160 different types and styles of labels on their 78-RPM records alone, so I will not be posting my usual picture of the variety of labels from one company. Sorry to disappoint.\n\nThis album is in Good condition, with some light scratches that do not prevent playability; unfortunately there is one exceptionally tiny but deep nick on the A-side track. It is an electrically recorded 10-inch diameter 78-RPM black vinyl disc with lateral grooves and a Â¼â spindle hole. The record catalog number is Columbia Records 1833-D and the master number is 148483/148484.\n\nThe A-side recording features Ted Wallace and his Campus Boys backing up an unnamed vocalist singing the fox trot âJericho,â written by Academy Award nominated songwriter Richard Myers (1901-1977) with lyrics by Leo Robin (1900-1984) who penned the words to the Oscar-winning Bob Hope tune âThanks for the Memoriesâ and did the lyrics to, among many other shows, âGentlemen Prefer Blondesâ (1949 and revived in 1995). âJerichoâ is the theme song from the 1929 motion picture âSyncopation.â It runs 2 minutes and 52 seconds. The unique Columbia code impressed on the record, 1-B-9, indicates that the recording was the first take, from the second mother, and ninth stamper â suggesting there were, at a minimum, 18,000 copies of this song pressed.\n\nThe B-side recording also features Ted Wallace and his Campus Boys backing up an unnamed vocalist singing the fox trot âIâve Got a Feeling Iâm Falling,â written by Harry Link (1896-1956) and the famed jazz pianist and composer Fats Waller (1903-1943), who (along with Louis Armstrong) would go on to make the song famous, with lyrics by the influential theater impresario Billy Rose (1899-1966). It runs 2 minutes and 54 seconds. The Columbia code on the record, 1-B-7, indicates that the recording was the first take, from the second mother, and seventh stamper â suggesting there were, at a minimum, 14,000 copies of this song pressed.\n\nThe record dates from May 8, 1929, around the same time the film âSyncopationâ was released. There is one dealer currently selling the same record, in Very Good condition, at Venerable Music auctions for $3, though Les Docks values the album at $7-$10. Interestingly, the unnamed vocalist on this record appears to be none other than the prolific singing cowboy featured on a previous record on Zaydeâs Turntable â Smith Ballew.\n\nTed Wallace and his Campus Boys was a regular Columbia house band. The highest they ever climbed in the U.S. charts was their top-selling hit, âLittle White Lies,â written by Walter Donaldson, which reached the #3 spot in 1930. Ted Wallace was, of course, a pseudonym. The man behind the band was conductor and music manager Ed Kirkeby (1891-1978). Kirkeby was one of the first producers at Columbia to record jazz albums and was a close associate and manager of Fats Waller (from 1938 to Wallerâs death in 1943). Kirkebyâs foresight in viewing Waller, rightly in my view, as one of the most important figures in American jazz, led to the preservation of a remarkable volume of documents and other archival items related to Wallerâs life and career at the Institute of Jazz Studies housed at Rutgers University.\n\nThe song âJerichoâ was originated by the exceptionally prolific bandleader Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians in the film âSyncopation.â In the movie the song is performed by Morton Downey, with back-up vocals provided by the Melody Boys. In addition to the Waring version and the Kirkeby version, at least one other recording of the tune was made by Bidgood Broadcasters on Broadcast Record 413-A. In some sense, its placement on this record is a bit ironic: the song, written by two white men and performed by a white singer with a white band, is supposed to be âabout jazz.â On the reverse of Columbia 1833-D, of course, we have a song written by one of the masterâs of jazz, Fats Waller.\n\nThe musical film âSyncopationâ was released in 1929 and was the second film produced by RKO Radio Pictures (though the first released by RKO). It was directed by Bert Glennon and starred Downey, Barbara Bennett, Bobby Watson, and Ian Hunter; the script was based on the novel âStepping Highâ by Gene Markey. RKO was a company in the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) empire and they used the film to test their new âsound-on-filmâ process â a process that is still used today (in a slightly updated fashion, of course) by Dolby and all the other big names in movie sound. The 1929 film, and Markeyâs novel, centers on two vaudevillians who are close both on and off the stage. One day a dashing millionaire shows up and starts to woo the female partner. She becomes smitten with the rich man and begins to needle her partner about his musical and personal faults. Sounds like a heart-warming tale, I know. IMDB users rate it 7.9 out of 10.\n\nâSyncopationâ was, in some ways, not a far ways distant from contemporary pop culture entertainment. I referred to it somewhat in jest in the title of this post as being similar to âAmerican Idol,â but it is not precisely identical. The concept of the consumer/viewer being involved in the crafting of entertainment is the same. Not with the 1929 version of the film, however. Here also the movie is similar to what we see today for in 1942 RKO ârebootedâ their 1929 movie. The kept some elements of the plot â a romance between singer Kit Latimer of New Orleans and Johnny Schumacher, in which they argue over and demonstrate the various styles of popular music (ragtime, jazz, swing, and blues). Hilarity and musical numbers ensue. In the 1942 version they updated the plot to cover music released between 1929 and the outbreak of World War II (most notably boogie-woogie). RKO also added another element, however: they held a contest for the readers of the Saturday Evening Post to vote by mail on the musicians who would make up the âAll-American Dance Bandâ that appears in the film (in the 1929 version this was Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians). The resulting musical ensemble was something of an all-star band for the era: Benny Goodman, Charlie Barnet, Harry James, Jack Jenney, Gene Krupa, Alvino Rey, Joe Venuti, with singer Connee Boswell. Of course, unlike âAmerican Idol,â these artists were already famous â and they were voted on, not off.\n\nâIâve Got a Feeling Iâm Fallingâ was a wildly popular song first published in 1929 and recorded by dozens of artists, including Fats Waller himself; several of the recording"
