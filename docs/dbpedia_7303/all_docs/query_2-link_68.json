        "text": "In the recorded-music business, most of the recent headline numbers haven’t been good. Sales are down, layoffs are up. Don’t even ask how many people downloaded the latest Katy Perry album illegally.\n\nBut for a project by Columbia Records in celebration of its own big number — 125 years in business — the label decided to take the high road by focusing on the broad historical influence of the company and its artists, including Bob Dylan, Barbra Streisand, Johnny Cash, Leonard Bernstein, Billie Holiday and Al Jolson, to name just a few of its giants.\n\nThe centerpiece is “360 Sound: The Columbia Records Story,” a book by the Princeton historian Sean Wilentz, which will be published this week by Chronicle Books. A related exhibition at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles opens on Nov. 7.\n\nMr. Wilentz, whose books include “The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln” and “Bob Dylan in America,” met with Columbia executives two years ago, after first being approached by Mr. Dylan’s manager, Jeff Rosen. They wanted a serious assessment by someone outside the industry, at a relatively modest length of 30,000 words.\n\n“They wanted a historian to tell the story of Columbia in the context of American social and cultural history,” Mr. Wilentz said recently. His condition was complete editorial control, which he said was honored.\n\nRob Stringer, the label’s chairman, said that after meeting with Mr. Wilentz, he was not worried what kind of book would result. “He was reverential to the label,” Mr. Stringer said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
