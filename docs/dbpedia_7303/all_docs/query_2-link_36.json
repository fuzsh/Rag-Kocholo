        "text": "In the decade 1910–20 the phonograph became a truly mass medium for popular music, and recordings of large-scale orchestral works and other classical instrumental music proliferated. The rise of the popular record coincided in the United States with the new ragtime, popularized by Scott Joplin’s rags at the turn of the century and sensationalized by Irving Berlin’s “Alexander’s Ragtime Band,” written in 1910, which swept the country the following year. It stimulated an unprecedented dance craze at a time when the phonograph was becoming increasingly available. As the fad spread to millions who had never danced before, phonographs were sold to people who had never owned records before. Between 1914 and 1919 phonograph sales increased more than fivefold. In 1917 Victor issued the first jazz recordings, by the Original Dixieland Jass (sic) Band, but few major jazz releases appeared before the 1920s.\n\nThe first large-scale symphonic recording, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker Suite, was issued in 1909 in England. The first attempt to record a concerto came the following year, also in London, when Wilhelm Backhaus recorded a cut version of the first movement of Grieg’s Piano Concerto. In 1913 the first complete symphonies, Beethoven’s Fifth and Sixth, were recorded in Germany under an anonymous conductor; later that year, a celebrity conductor, Arthur Nikisch, led a full-scale symphony for the first time, again the Beethoven Fifth. Solo instrumentalists vied with the opera singers for the record-buying public’s affection, mainly by recording tidbits. In 1917 Victor began to record with a combination that was to prove its star classical music attraction for decades: Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra.\n\nThe serious recording of serious music became a growing phenomenon as the phonograph matured during the early 1920s. Tidbits and orchestral snatches gave way to a spate of uncut symphonies, sonatas, quartets, and concerti; the music itself came to mean as much as its star performers, and the electrical recording process, from 1925 on, raised the quality of the recordings as well. But in the mid-1920s radio, which provided free music, developed, and this new factor, plus the worldwide economic depression of the 1930s, threw the phonograph industry into serious decline.\n\nThe companies realigned themselves. In 1929 the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) bought Victor. Later that year, Edison left the phonograph business he had created. In 1931 the English Columbia Graphophone Company divested itself of its near-defunct American progenitor and joined the Gramophone Company to form Electric and Musical Industries, Ltd. (EMI), bringing into the merger nearly every important European firm except DGG and its export label, Polydor. American Columbia was revived by its purchase, in 1938, by the Columbia Broadcasting System."
