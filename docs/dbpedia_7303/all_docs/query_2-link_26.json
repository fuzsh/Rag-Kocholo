Shortly afterwards, discs began to be produced, and the \"magic notes\" logo began to appear on the labels. Sometime about 1908, it acquired the Rena Record Company, of which little is known\n\nRena records were issued under the Columbia-Rena label\n\nCheap, and Popular Labels\n\nThe Rena name appears to have been phased out by about 1912, when there was fierce competition amongst the record companies. A price war on cheap labels was begun by the German companies, but soon, the British companies joined in. The established British record industry was very critical of the cheap labels eroding their profits, and so most British companies which issued cheap labels were careful not to publicise the link between the cheap record label and themselves. Columbia's cheap label was the \"Phoenix\" label which was pressed in the UK and the USA. No reference to Columbia was given anywhere, and the only indication of the link was the general appearance of the records. Some existing Columbia-Rena records had Phoenix labels pasted over their own. The Phoenix label lasted until the Great War, when the German competition was swept away almost overnight. However, cheap labels were here to stay, and so Columbia issued the Regal label, often drawing from the same masters as the Phoenix record had used, and the Columbia-Rena before them, as in the case of Billy Williams. The Regal record began with the G series, at G6000. Several variations of the Regal label have been noted. This time, the Columbia name was publicised.\n\nIn the 1930's, a joint venture was undertaken at Hayes, and the Gramophone Company's popular Zonophone label was merged with the Regal label to create Regal-Zonophone. After the Second World War, Regal-Zonphone seems to have gradually disappeared, and more popular titles began to appear on the Columbia and His Masters Voice labels instead.\n\nColumbia Labels\n\nThe Columbia label continued to be issued alongside the cheaper labels. Initially, famous artists such as Dame Clara Butt, etc. were found on the full price labels, and these artists did not appear on cheaper labels. Classical music was only found on the full price labels, with the best quality recording and reproducing equipment being used in their manufacture. In the 1920's, popular dance bands began to appear on Columbia, along with vocalists and other musicians. By the 1960's, Rock and Roll was appearing on the Columbia label. Columbia was taken over in the 1980's by Sony Music, and still exists today, though the name and the \"magic notes\" logo are much less prominent..\n\nCrown (original)\n\nCrown (9 inch)\n\nThe Columbia Graphophone Company\n\nCrystalate Record Co.\n\nCurrys\n\nCurrys records were stencilled records from various sources produced for Currys Cycle Shops. Westport was also a currys label. \"Westlake\" gramophones were made for Currys Cycle Shops.\n\nDacapo\n\nDecca\n\nDominion\n\nElectron (see Edison Bell for description)\n\nEmpire\n\nFavourite\n\nGrammavox\n\nThe Gramophone Company Ltd.\n\nThis began as the Gramophone and Typewriter Company Ltd, whose records were popularly known as \"G&T's\". The Typewriter part was dropped in about 1908, as it obviously found gramophones and records to be more profitable. These records bore the Nymph logo.\n\nIn 1903, the company had acquired the British interest of the International Zonophone Company, and used the Zonophone label as its popular label. These were invariably single sided, and used the x- matrix number as reference. The Twin label also belonged to the company. Whether this was by acquisition or not, perhaps a reader can tell me. In 1911, the Zonophone and Twin labels were merged to form Zonophone-Twin. The size, characters and colour scheme of the labels differed little from the Zonophone label, so the records were still referred to as \"Zonophones\", despite carrying the Twin logo and text \"The Twin\". many of the first Zonophone-Twin records were reissues of earlier Twins and Zonophones, carrying the \"T-\" and \"X-\" matrix numbers of the previous labels respectively. A \"Celebrity\" label was used for famous artists such as Harry Lauder. The Zonophone label changed appearance a further three times. It briefly appeared with the \"Nipper\" dog logo in the early 1920's. It changed again to a patterned design. This theme was carried on in the final design, which used a lighter green label. Afterwards, Zonophone was merged with the Regal label (see Columbia)\n\nWhen the price war over cheap labels began, the Gramophone Company issued the Cinch label. This lasted from 1913 to 1916\n\nThe famous Nipper logo was commissioned from the artist.... to be used by the Gramophone Company. From that point on, it appeared on just about every label, sleeve, publication and gramophone manufactured by the company, and is known the world over.\n\nThe Gramophone Company continued to issue records pretty much the same way as Columbia did. In the 1960's EMI began to appear more often on records, By 1980, the Nipper logo was being used exclusively on Classical recordings. Today, the name \"His Masters Voice\" no longer seems to appear on the recordings, but the Nipper logo remains. EMI classics resurrected the Nymph logo, which appears on all that particular series.\n\nGuardsman 1, Guardsman 2 (see Crystalate for description)\n\nHeart\n\nHis Master's Voice\n\nHomochord\n\nImperial (see Crystalate for description)\n\nInvicta (see Crystalate for description)\n\nJohn Bull\n\nJumbo 1 Jumbo 2 (see Fonotipia for description)\n\nKalliope\n\nLittle Marvel (5 inch)\n\nLyceum (see Beka for description)\n\nLyric\n\nMelotto\n\nMimosa 1 Mimosa 2 Mimosa 3 (5 inch)\n\nNational (see Scala)\n\nNeophone\n\nOdeon (not to be confused with Parlophone's Odeon Series)\n\nPanachord\n\nPalings (Australian)\n\nPathé\n\nPathé records were maufactured in Belgium and were vertical cut (hill and dale) and started at the centre. This required a special reproducer which fitted to the arm of a conventional machine. This was quite expensive, and despite the fact that some enthusiasts thought that the sound quality was better, they never became really popular. Pathé began producing the \"Actuelle\" label, which wat the conventional lateral cut type. Later, Pathé released the \"Perfect\" label, but this is quite rare and usually contains French or Belgian artists.\n\nPelican\n\nPelican was the cheap label produced by the Universal Record Syndicate\n\nPerfect (see Pathé for description)\n\nPhoenix (see Columbia for description)\n\nPiccaddilly 1, Piccadilly 2, Piccadilly 3\n\nPickofall\n\nPioneer\n\nPlaza (8 inch)\n\nPolyphon\n\nPopular 1, Popular 2\n\nRadio (see Edison Bell for description)\n\nRena (see Columbia for description)\n\nRex (see Crystalate for description)\n\nRubin\n\nSavana (5 inch)\n\nScala 1, Scala 2, Scala 3 (see Beka for description)\n\nSolex (see Homochord for description)\n\nSovereign\n\nSterno (see Homochord for description)\n\nTriumph\n\nTwin (see the Gramophone Company for description)\n\nVelvet Face (see Edison Bell for description)\n\nVictor (American label)\n\nVictory (see Kalliope for description)\n\nVictory (7 inch)\n\nVocalion\n\nWestport (see Currys)\n\nWinner (see Edison Bell for description)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nZonophone 1, Zonophone 2, Zonophone 3 (see The Gramophone Company for description)"
