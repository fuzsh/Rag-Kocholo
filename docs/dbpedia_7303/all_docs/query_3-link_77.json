        "text": "A Brief History Of Recording Technology\n\nThe history of music production technology is traced back to the late 19th century when inventors began experimenting with ways to capture and reproduce sound.\n\nSome say the birth of music recording began in France with Ãdouard-LÃ©on Scott de Martinville, who invented the phonautograph in 1857. His device was the first to record acoustic waves, but couldnât play back the sounds it had captured.\n\nThe Early Years Of Sound Recording\n\nThe Cylinder Is Invented\n\nRecord players were invented in 1877 when Thomas Edison invented the first device that could both record and play back sounds; his phonograph used two cylinders wrapped in tin foil: one needle was to record the sound and the other was used to play back the sound. This was the first record player.\n\nThe Vinyl Disc Is Created\n\nThe Phonograph grew in popularity, and in 1887 Emile Berliner invented a disc-based version. His Gramophone, which he commercially introduced in 1895, used a disc with spiral grooves, and the sound was reproduced using a needle and diaphragm. This is the moment that records begin to become the leading format.\n\nThe Birth Of The Microphone\n\nMicrophones were invented In 1877. Emile Berliner, invented the microphone while studying the telephone that Alexander Graham Bell had invented in 1876.\n\nThe microphone revolutionised the music production process and the wider music industry. It allowed for the amplification of sound so that music could be heard more easily and over greater distances. The microphone allowed the development of new genres of music, such as rock and roll, and it also made it possible for people to listen to music in new ways, such as through radios and loudspeakers.\n\nRecord Companies Are Born\n\nThe following year, a commercial recording studio, the United States Gramophone Company, was founded in New York. Also, the first record company was created, Edison Phonograph Company, which Columbia records was created soon after. Many say that this is when the music industry started.\n\nIn 1889 the Gramophone company was registered in London by William Barry Owen and Trevor Lloyd Williams. Initially, many in London were unimpressed with the Gramophone until Williams visited Berliner in 1898.\n\nThe Music Industry Is Born\n\nThe First Music Recording\n\nThe first recorded music on vinyl was made in 1898 by the Victor Talking Machine Company. The recording was made on a wax cylinder and featured a female vocalist singing the song \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.\" This was the moment that vinyl records were invented.\n\nHowever, it's not until 1901 that vinyl records come out more widely. This was the year that the Victor Talking Machine Company began selling a vinyl disc machine called the Victrola. It was then that the term ârecordâ first became commonly used in reference to the vinyl discs that played on the Victrola.\n\nThe Victor Talking Machine Company and The Gramophone Company were two leading competitors in the early days of the phonograph and talking machine industry. The Victor Talking Machine Company was eventually acquired by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in 1929, while The Gramophone Company was acquired by the British conglomerate EMI in 1931.\n\nThe First Recording Artists\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, saw the rise of the first superstar recording artist, Enrico Caruso. Caruso was the first artist recorded by the Gramophone Company and he went on to make over one million pounds in royalties. The Victor Talking Machine also recorded other great performers such as Nellie Melba and Sergei Rachmaninoff.\n\nJazz Recordings Makes Its Debut\n\nThe first commercial recordings of jazz were made in 1917 by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band. The diverse and integrated group of five musicians recorded \"Livery Stable Blues,\" which became the earliest released jazz record.\n\nThe Beginning of Electrical Recording\n\nThe first electrical recordings were made in the 1920s by scientists working for Bell Laboratories. These new recordings were an improvement over the previous acoustic recording methods, which were limited by the sound quality that could be achieved.\n\nAlso, in the 1920s, record companies in the United States began using the term ârace recordsâ to market music by black artists to black audiences. These records were usually made on lower-quality materials and were not meant to be played on the expensive Victrolas that most white Americans owned.\n\nThe Great Depression of the 1930s brought hard times to the recording industry. Sales of phonographs and records declined. Many record companies recorded music on lower-quality materials and pressed fewer copies of each record to cut costs.\n\nAfter World War II, the recording industry began to rebound. New technologies, such as the long-playing (LP) record and the compact disc (CD), were introduced, and new genres of music, such as rock and roll, became popular. British influence was having an impact on the recording industry as record companies expanded their pop music offerings, signing a number of British pop and rock and roll stars, including Cliff Richard, Beatles and the Rolling Stones\n\nIn the 1980s, the introduction of the digital audio tape (DAT) and the compact disc (CD) changed the music industry again. The first DAW was developed by English engineer and musician Tony Banks in 1981.\n\nBanks was working on a project to create a digital version of the Fairlight CMI, a popular music synthesizer of the time. His work led to the development of the first DAW, which he named Sound Maker.\n\nIt became easier for artists to produce and distribute their music, and for listeners to access a wider range of music. The increased availability of music also had an impact on the way that people consumed music, as people were no longer limited to the music that was available in their local area."
