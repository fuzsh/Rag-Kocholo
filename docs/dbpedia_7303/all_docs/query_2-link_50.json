        "text": "This article investigates how the standardisation of the 45 RPM single and 33 RPM album in 1951 forced the recording industry to rethink their marketing strategies. The industry’s focus on weak unit strategies and capitalisation on the emergent artistic aesthetic are evaluated. To establish correlations between strategies and the popularity of singles and albums between 1955 and 1979, OLS models were generated using large datasets on chart performance of albums and singles. This study concludes that the industry tended toward sub-optimal, risk-averse strategies, and that the LP likely succeeded despite record companies’ efforts to control their products and messaging.\n\nIn Chasing Sound, Susan Schmidt Horning traces the cultural and technological evolution of recording studios in the United States from the first practical devices to the modern multi-track studios of the analog era. Charting the technical development of studio equipment, the professionalization of recording engineers, and the growing collaboration between artists and technicians, she shows how the earliest efforts to capture the sound of live performances eventually resulted in a trend toward studio creations that extended beyond live shows, ultimately reversing the historic relationship between live and recorded sound. Schmidt Horning draws from a wealth of original oral interviews with major labels and independent recording engineers, producers, arrangers, and musicians, as well as memoirs, technical journals, popular accounts, and sound recordings. Recording engineers and producers, she finds, influenced technological and musical change as they sought to improve the sound of reco...\n\nDrawing on research into the Portuguese phonographic industry, this article addresses the crisis which the industry is currently facing, with the aim of showing how the history of the phonographic field has, from the outset, been marked by various doubts and uncertainties emerging from disputes over a number of objects. It also shows that these doubts have always led to the reinvention of the conventions that have shaped the activities of this organisational and commercial field. Based on an analytical perspective that draws on the theoretical contributions of institutionalist economic sociology (Powell and DiMaggio, 1991; Fligstein, 1996 and 2001) and the economic sociology of conventions (Boltanski and Thévenot, 1991 and 1999; Thévenot, 2002), it discusses the dilemmas experienced by the industry, exploring the hypothesis that these have emerged as a result of the different orders of worth mobilised to coordinate activities in the phonographic field.\n\nThe primary aim of this project is to give a broad definition of the record producer and explain his working practices along with the aspects he/she can bring to a pop/rock record during production. The structure of the project is built first by giving a brief history how the sound recording techniques have changed since the availability of commercial music and what these techniques are. Secondly, I have tried to explain what factors have given rise to the need for the production of commercial music and how record producers have become more important and essential than the recording engineers. The main part of the project consists of an outline of what a record producer does, how he/she does it, what techniques and methods he uses to achieve it and what the results of his/her work would be. The final part is a less technical and more music-based part, where I have tried to give examples from the works of different record producers, how their techniques can be varied, and what results can be achieved as a final musical product. The enclosed DAT includes recordings made by some of the producers mentioned in the project and hopefully will be helpful for the better understanding of some of the aspects.\n\nThe paper record label, invented by Eldridge Johnson in the early 1900s, affected the fortunes and status of the analogue disc. On the one hand, it transformed it into a marketable product. On the other, using Walter Benjamin’s term, it helped to restore ‘aura’ to this mass-produced good. The clearest outcome of labelling lies in the fact that the term ‘record label’ soon became a synonym for ‘record company’. The label helped to brand both record and company but in so doing it altered the nature of their relationship. This article traces the manufacturing company’s domination over all other contributors listed on the paper label. It also outlines the consequences and compromises that have resulted from making such bold claims over the contents of the disc. Beyond its merely informative tasks, the record label was first used to develop associations between the manufacturing company and its recorded output, a process that soon grew complicated. Later it was employed to highlight the difference between classical and popular music. It was then used to create further sub-divisions, such as those which arose in the US market between ‘popular’, ‘race’, and ‘hillbilly’ musics. Such divisions were crucial in fostering the practice of record collecting. The generic label was an essential guide to, and indicator of, the record collector’s hobby. Nevertheless, collectors soon went further than record companies had planned. In order to establish the authenticity of their discs, record collectors explored each aspect and alteration of the record label. A practice that helped to individualize each duplicated disc."
