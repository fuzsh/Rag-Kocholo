From the late 1960s through December 1971, these flipback covers had three flaps (top, right side, and bottom). In 1972, flipback covers were changed to two flaps (top and bottom only), then eventually phased out in 1974.Label color and text - Columbia Records:\n\nColor:\n\nFrom 1967 through early 1969, Pink Floyd albums were released on black Columbia labels with silver text, a blue \"Columbia Records Magic Notes Trademark\" at the top, and a blue \"Columbia\" in the center.\n\nIn July / August 1969, Columbia Records changed to a black Columbia label with silver text, a white EMI logo in a small rectangle at the bottom, and a white \"Columbia\" in large rectangle with lines on each side at the top.\n\nText:\n\nFrom 1967 through June 1969, Pink Floyd releases on Columbia Records included the following text on the labels: \"Sold in U.K. subject to resale price conditions. See price lists.\"\n\nLabel color and text - Harvest Records:\n\nColor:\n\nBeginning with the release of the Pink Floyd album, Ummagumma in late 1969, Pink Floyd albums were released on Harvest Records with yellow / green Harvest Record labels. (they look green to me, but some people call them yellow)\n\nIn late 1971, Harvest Records added a small EMI logo in a rectangular box above the word Harvest on the left side of the label. This logo is in the same yellow / green colors as the rest of the Harvest label.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Harvest Records changed to a black Harvest label with silver text.\n\nText:\n\nFrom 1967 until approximately 1975, the text around the edge of the labels included the wording: \"The Gramophone Co. Ltd.\"\n\nBeginning in 1975, \"The Gramophone Co. Ltd.\" text around the edge of the labels was changed to: \"EMI Records Ltd.\" In approximately 1982, the text around the edge of the labels was changed to end with: \"Manufactured in the U.K. by EMI Records Limited.\"\n\nMatrix Information: Matrix information is the letters and numbers etched into the vinyl near the label in the runoff groove at the end of each side of a record. Matrix information may include:\n\nCatalog number.\n\nSide number.\n\nLacquer master number.\n\nCutting room. A \"U\" in the matrix, such as \"A-2U,\" means that the record was cut by Universal Programmes Corporation (the parent company of IBC) in their disc cutting department (run by Sean Davies), and not by EMI at Abbey Road.\n\nStamper letter. (usually found at the 3 o'clock position)\n\nMother number. (usually found at the 9 o'clock position)\n\nRecord pressing plant.\n\nThe engineer who cut the lacquer (for example HTM stands for Harry T. Moss).\n\nExample: The matrix information, YAX 3419-1 G 1, found on side one of the Columbia Records pressing of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn indicates:\n\nYAX 3419-1 is the lacquer master number (this includes the catalog number YAX 3419)\n\nG is the stamper letter\n\n1 is the mother number\n\nStampers are made from the Mothers. Mothers are made from the fathers. Fathers are made from the lacquers. And the lacquers are cut from the master tapes. It is interesting to note that side one of the mono pressings of Piper at the Gates of Dawn are all made from a second lacquer. What happened to lacquer number 1?\n\nStamper Codes: The stamper codes used by Columbia/EMI Records is based on \"Gramophone Ltd.\" and are as follows:\n\nG=1\n\nR=2\n\nA=3\n\nM=4\n\nO=5\n\nP=6\n\nH=7\n\nL=8\n\nT=9\n\nD=0\n\nExample: A record with a \"G\" stamper letter indicates that the record was made from the first stamper. Later pressings may have stamper numbers in combination, such as \"AL\" which means 38.\n\n***The matrix information listed in this discography is not complete. This is known matrix information only. If you have a record with matrix information that is not listed here, please send me the information!***\n\nPressing vs. Issue - A first issue is NOT the same thing as a first pressing. In fact, a first issue can be a very high pressing. For example, a copy of Dark Side of the Moon with a solid blue triangle on the label is a first issue. But even if the matrix information for the record is A-2 / B-2, it may not be an early pressing. To determine the pressing, you must look at the pressing indicators (stamper letters and mother numbers) found in the records run off groove. If the matrix information is SHVL 804 A-2 GMP 2 / SHVL 804 B-2 GRR, the stamping indicators are GMP for side 1, and GRR for side 2. GMP indicates that side 1 was made using the 146th stamper, and GRR indicates that side 2 was made using the 122nd stamper. Since, generally, 300-500 records were pressed with each stamper, this record is approximately the 73,000th pressing of Dark Side of the Moon. Record Pressing Plants - Most EMI Records in the 1960s through the 1980s were pressed at their Uxbridge Road pressing plant in outer London, known as the EMI Village. These vinyl pressing plants were closed down in the early 1990s and everything since then has been subcontracted out.Sealed Albums - Record albums in Britain were never sealed in shrink wrap by either Columbia Records or Harvest Records. However, often times record shops would seal the records themselves upon receipt. Additionally, may importers of British albums into the U.S., such as GEM, would seal the records prior to distribution.Tax stamps: The letters KT which are often found on early pressings of British records is a tax stamp. This tax was a purchase tax that was imposed by the British government on the manufacturers of records, and was based on wholesale prices at a rate of 27 1/2% in 1967 (it was increased on March 20, 1968). The purchase tax was replaced by a value added tax (VAT) on March 31, 1973. The KT tax stamp can be found in the runoff grooves of singles, and in the center of the labels near the spindle hole on albums from 1967 and 1968. A record with a KT stamp indicates that the tax was paid. Beginning in mid-1970, tax stamps were no longer put on records although the tax was still imposed.Timings: Timings of each side of certain LPs are indicated. These timings were done with a stopwatch and should only be considered accurate to apx. +/- 5 seconds due to the difficulties involved in determining the exact start and end of each side (fadeins, fadeouts, etc.).\n\nThe Piper at the Gates of Dawn\n\nThe Piper at the Gates of Dawn LP\n\nColumbia Records 1st issue mono\n\nTitle: The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (Columbia Records 1st issue mono)\n\nRecord Company: Columbia Records\n\nCatalog Number: SX 6157\n\nMatrix Information: (side 1 / side 2)\n\n3419-2 / 3420-1:\n\n1) XAX 3419-2 G 1 / XAX 3420-1 G 1 (both stamped) [BC1, IS1, L1]\n\n2) XAX 3419-2 G 1 / XAX 3420-1 R 1 (both stamped) [BC1, IS1, L1]\n\n3) XAX 3419-2 G 1 / XAX 3420-1 A 1 (both stamped)\n\n4) XAX 3419-2 G 1 / XAX 3420-1 M 1 (both stamped) [BC1, L1]\n\n5) XAX 3419-2 G 1 / XAX 3420-1 P 1 (both stamped) [BC1, L1]\n\n6) XAX 3419-2 R 1 / XAX 3420-1 M 1 (both stamped) [BC1, L1]\n\n7) XAX 3419-2 R 1 / XAX 3420-1 P 1 (both stamped) [BC2, L1]\n\n8) XAX 3419-2 A 1 / XAX 3420-1 A 1 (both stamped) [BC1 or BC2, L1]\n\n9) XAX 3419-2 A 1 / XAX 3420-1 M 1 (both stamped) [BC1, L1]\n\n10) XAX 3419-2 M 1 / XAX 3420-1 G 1 (both stamped) [BC1, L1]\n\n11) XAX 3419-2 M 1 / XAX 3420-1 A 1 (both stamped) [BC1, L1]\n\n12) XAX 3419-2 M 1 / XAX 3420-1 M 1 (both stamped)\n\n13) XAX 3419-2 M 1 / XAX 3420-1 L 1 (both stamped) [L1] (factory sample)\n\n14) XAX 3419-2 O 1 / XAX 3420-1 O 1 (both stamped) [BC1, L1]\n\n15) XAX 3419-2 O 1 / XAX 3420-1 L 1 (both stamped) [BC2, IS1, L1]\n\n16) XAX 3419-2 O 1 / XAX 3420-1 T 1 (both stamped) [BC2, L1]\n\n17) XAX 3419-2 P 1 / XAX 3420-1 G 1 (both stamped) [BC1, L1]\n\n18) XAX 3419-2 H 1 / XAX 3420-1 M 1 (both stamped)\n\n19) XAX 3419-2 H 1 / XAX 3420-1 H 1 (both stamped) [BC2, IS1, L1]\n\n20) XAX 3419-2 H 1 / XAX 3420-1 L 1 (both stamped) [BC2, IS1, L1]\n\n21) XAX 3419-2 H 1 / XAX 3420-1 T 1 (both stamped) [BC2, L1]\n\n22) XAX 3419-2 L 1 / XAX 3420-1 H 1 (both stamped) [BC2, L1]\n\n23) XAX 3419-2 L 1 / XAX 3420-1 GT 1 (both stamped) [BC2, IS2, L2]\n\n24) XAX 3419-2 T 1 / XAX 3420-1 O 1 (both stamped) [BC2, L1]\n\n25) XAX 3419-2 T 1 / XAX 3420-1 GD 1 (both stamped) [BC2, L2]\n\n26) XAX 3419-2 GD 1 / XAX 3420-1 GO 1 (both stamped) [BC2, L2]\n\n27) XAX 3419-2 GG 1 / XAX 3420-1 GG 1 (both stamped) [BC2, IS2, L2]\n\n28) XAX 3419-2 GG 1 / XAX 3420-1 GM 1 (both stamped) [BC2, L2]\n\n28) XAX 3419-2 GG 1 / XAX 3420-1 GO 1 (both stamped) [BC2, L2]\n\n30) XAX 3419-2 GG 1 / XAX 3420-1 GP 1 (both stamped) [BC2, IS1, L2]\n\n31) XAX 3419-2 GG 1 / XAX 3420-1 GL 1 (both stamped)\n\n32) XAX 3419-2 GA 1 / XAX 3420-1 GH 1 (both stamped) [BC2, L2]\n\n33) XAX 3419-2 GA 1 / XAX 3420-1 GT 1 (both stamped)\n\n34) XAX 3419-2 GO 1 / XAX 3420-1 GG 1 (both stamped)\n\nRelease Date: August 4, 1967\n\nRelease Information: First mono issue on a black Columbia label with a blue Columbia trademark logo.\n\nPromo Pressings: Some promo copies were issued with blank white labels.\n\nTest Pressing: A test pressing in the form of two one-sided acetates was made with white EMI Disc labels, and the title handwritten on it.\n\nBootlegs: Bootlegs of this release have been made with the catalog number CX-6157, and a yellow Columbia logo on the label.\n\nSongs:\n\nSide 1: Astronomy Domine, Lucifer Sam, Matilda Mother, Flaming, Pow R.
