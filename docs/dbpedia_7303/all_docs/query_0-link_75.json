Toc H., Take Up Thy Stethoscope And Walk.\n\nSide 2: Interstellar Overdrive, The Gnome, Chapter 24, The Scarecrow, Bike.\n\nDescription:\n\nFront Cover: Kaleidoscope picture of the band. The title, \"PINK FLOYD\" is at bottom center. EMI logo in upper left corner. Laminated flipback cover.\n\nBack Cover #1 [BC1]: On early pressings, the top right part of the flipback is blank. Backcover includes title, credits, and song listing. Catalog number in upper right corner. Unlaminated except for flipbacks.\n\nBack Cover #2 [BC2]: On later pressings, the top right part of the flipback includes the text: \"File under POPULAR : Pop Groups.\"\n\nInner Sleeve #1 [IS1]: [front] [back] Cream colored inner sleeve. On the front is an EMI logo at the top center, with \"Add these outstanding LPs to your collection\" at the top, 16 LP covers pictured in the middle including Both Sides of Herman's Hermits, and \"Remember-the new Emitex cleans and preserves your records,\" and \"Patents applied for\" at the bottom. On the back is an EMI logo at the top center, with \" - the greatest recording organization in the world\" at the top, 16 LP covers pictured in the middle including the Beatles-Revolver, and \"E.M.I. Records (The Gramophone Company Ltd.) Hayes - Middlesex - England, Made and Printed in Great Britain\" at the bottom.\n\nInner Sleeve #2 [IS2]: [front] [back] Reddish brown printing on cream colored paper. On the front side is the EMI logo at the top center, with \"Add these outstanding LPs to your collection\" at the top, 16 LP covers pictured in the middle including The Beatles-Sgt. Peppers, and \"Remember-the new Emitex cleans and preserves your records,\" and \"Patents applied for\" at the bottom. On the back side is the EMI logo at the top center, with \" - the greatest recording organization in the world\" at the top, 16 LP covers pictured in the middle including Pink Floyd-Piper at the Gates of Dawn, and \"E.M.I. Records (The Gramophone Company Ltd.) Hayes - Middlesex - England, Made and Printed in Great Britain\" at the bottom.\n\nSpine: White with title.\n\nLabels #1 [L1]: Black Columbia labels with silver text, and a blue \"Columbia Records Magic Notes Trademark\" at the top, and a blue \"Columbia\" in the center. Underneath the blue \"Columbia\" it says \"Sold in U.K. subject to resale price conditions. See price lists.\" On most copies, the letters \"K\" and \"T\" are stamped on one of the labels (on either on side 1 or 2) on each side of the spindle hole. These are the U.K. tax stamps and indicate that the tax was paid for this album. At the bottom of the label, it says \"Made in Gt. Britain.\"\n\nText around the bottom edge of the label starts at 10 o'clock and says:\n\nThe Gramophone Co., Ltd. All rights of the manufacturer and of the owner of the recorded work reserved. Unauthorised public performance, broadcasting, and copying of this record prohibited.\n\nLabels #2 [L2]: Some copies of this issue have been found with a slightly different font on the labels, and with the layout of the song titles and credits altered. For example, the songwriting credits for Interstellar Overdrive on side 2 have been moved to under the song title as opposed to being next to the song title as they are found on earlier issues. These labels appear to have been put on later pressings, but may have occurred silmultaneously with the other version of the label, perhaps just a label printing variation from a different printing plant.\n\nPlease see below above data from the Pink Floyd archives and this early pressed copy indicated in Bold\n\nThe Record itself is VISUALLY graded as VERY GOOD (+) I can see some hazy scratches and more on SIDE 1 that would/could affect playback. Side 1 seems to have a deposit on it which may benefit from a very good clean. (Something of which I don't do as I don't have the correct equipment).\n\nThe labels show some indication of use.\n\nThe inner is in Excellent Condition.\n\nThe Spine is in Excellent condition with storage bumps corners. The sleeve is in Very Good Condition no tears or rips or sellotape used for repairs .The cover has a nice sheen, with no writing on it.\n\nCheapest on Ebay by far for this conservatively graded LP.\n\nPlease note I am no Vinyl expert but I am starting to fall for the lure of Vinyl, I am currently saving for my first player and therefore all grading is done under strong light only.The records themselves are inherited through various family members who no longer deem it a format of choice.\n\nI will try to answer any questions posed, to the best of my ability.\n\nPlease note that all items will be carefully packaged and only sent using recorded delivery.\n\nAlso please note that the condition of this and any other Vinyl I will list will not all of a sudden turn into a superior than stated copy in the post.\n\nI do only rarely grade using mint.Cheapest by far on EBAY in this condition!!\n\nAll foreign buyers welcome as I belong to the Global Shipping Programme."
