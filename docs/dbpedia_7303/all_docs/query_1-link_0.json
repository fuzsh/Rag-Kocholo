        "text": "A little cleaner:\n\nThey went from:\n\nFirst three albums: English Columbia/EMI (UK) and Tower-Capitol/EMI(US) to\n\nPre-WWYH: Harvest/Capitol/EMI (worldwide) to\n\nWWYH and later: Harvest/EMI (UK/Europe) and American Columbia/CBS/Sony (US/Japan) to\n\n1994 remasters up to Final Cut (Momentary Lapse on up stayed on American Columbia/Sony): EMI/Harvest/Capitol (worldwide) to\n\n2011 remasters/paper packaging all albums: EMI/Harvest/Capitol (worldwide)\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Columbia history:\n\nEnglish Columbia at one time, almost 90 years ago was a UK affliate of American Columbia. The two companies split and UK Columbia became a founding part of EMI, while American Columbia became part of CBS TV Network's record business, who was affliated with them (later Sony). Sony now owns the worldwide Columbia rights except in Japan, where Denon owns it, owing to a similar very old arrangement.\n\nIt is confusing.\n\nKeep in mind that in the UK the Columbia/CBS thing is (or at least, was -- not sure about today) very confusing. \"Columbia\" was an historical EMI imprint in the UK, no ongoing relation to Columbia in the USA. (Columbia in the USA is a division of CBS, the broadcasting corporation.) Ever wonder why USA Columbia titles are released on \"CBS Records\" in the UK? It's because when Columbia (USA) wanted to release their own records in the UK in the 1950s, they couldn't use the Columbia name because EMI already had a label called \"Columbia.\" Thus, the change to \"CBS Records.\" At that time, CBS Records and Columbia Records were competing labels in the UK.\n\nSomebody else may be able to fill in some of the details.\n\nMatt\n\nThat's been true since the '50s. But it wasn't the case prior to that:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Graphophone_Company\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Records\n\nThat is, there was an ownership connection prior to 1931, and a continuing distribution agreement between then and 1951. There was a similar situation with HMV and RCA.\n\nI dare you to follow the history of Columbia, EMI, ARC, Brunswick, Decca, etc without your head spinning."
