        "text": "EMI launched its new subsidiary music label to compete with the demand for the new style of ‘progressive’ rock music. The first release in July 1969 was a UK issue of Deep Purple’s “Book Of Taliesyn” which had originally been released in the US on the Tetragrammaton label at the end of 1968. Deep Purple had originally been on EMI’s Parlophone label for their successful “Shades Of Deep Purple” LP so it made a logical sense both artistically and commercially to launch Harvest with a moderately well known act.\n\nDespite having been known as EMI (Electric & Musical Industries Ltd) since the merger in 1931 between The Gramophone Company and Columbia Gramophone Company, no mention of EMI appeared on Harvest labels or sleeves until mid-1971, when the EMI ‘boxed’ logo was printed above ‘Harvest’ on the label, the legal entity that appeared on labels and sleeves was The Gramophone Company Ltd, it was finally renamed EMI Records Ltd. in 1973.\n\nHarvest featured some highly successful acts, notably Deep Purple, Edgar Broughton Band, The Move, ELO and Pink Floyd, but would also release some very obscure artists that would fail to achieve any commercial success. Many original UK releases are now extremely collectable and whilst not quite achieving the stellar values of some other labels’ rarities (e.g. Vertigo Swirl) are still highly prized by collectors.\n\nHarvest Records discography (click the links to go to each album’s page):\n\nSHVL 751 – Deep Purple\n\nSHVL 752 – Pete Brown\n\nSHVL 753 – Panama Limited Jug Band\n\nSHVL 754 – Shirley & Dolly Collins\n\nSHVL 755 – Michael Chapman\n\nSPSLP 118 – Various\n\nSHVL 756 – Third Ear Band\n\nSHVL 757 – Edgar Broughton Band\n\nSHDW 1/2 – Pink Floyd\n\nSHVL 758 – Battered Ornaments\n\nSHVL 759 – Deep Purple\n\nSHVL 760 – Forest\n\nSHVL 761 – Tea & Symphony\n\nSHVL 762 – Bakerloo\n\nSHVL 763 – Kevin Ayers\n\nSHVL 764 – Michael Chapman\n\nSHVL 765 – Syd Barrett\n\nSHVL 766 – Roy Harper\n\nSHVL 767 – Deep Purple\n\nSHVL 768 – Pete Brown & Piblokto!\n\nSHVL 769 – The Greatest Show On Earth\n\nSHVL 770 – Barclay James Harvest\n\nSHVL 771 – Shirley & Dolly Collins\n\nSHVL 772 – Edgar Broughton Band\n\nSHVL 773 – Third Ear Band\n\nSHDW 3/4 – Love\n\nSHVL 774 – Pretty Things\n\nSHSS 1/2 – Various\n\nSHVL 775 – Quatermass\n\nSHVL 777 – Deep Purple\n\nSHSP 4001 – Ike & Tina Turner\n\nSHVL 779 – Panama Limited\n\nMHSP 4002 – Clifton Chenier\n\nSHSP 4004 – Chris Spedding\n\nSHSP 4005 – Kevin Ayers\n\nSHTC 251 – Dave Mason\n\nSHVL 781 – Pink Floyd\n\nSHVL 782 – Pete Brown & Piblokto!\n\nSHVL 783 – Greatest Show On Earth\n\nSHSP 4007 – Syd Barrett\n\nSHSP 4008 – Ron Geesin & Roger Waters\n\nSHVL 784 – Forest\n\nSHVL 785 – Tea & Symphony\n\nSHVL 786 – Michael Chapman\n\nSHSP 4009 – Climax Chicago Blues Band\n\nSHVL 787 – Love\n\nSHSP 4006 – Buddy & The Juniors\n\nSHSP 4010 – The Flying Circus\n\nSHVL 788 – Barclay James Harvest\n\nSHSP 4011 – Mark-Almond\n\nSHVL 789 – Roy Harper\n\nSHVL 790 – The Grease Band\n\nSHVL 791 – The Edgar Broughton Band\n\nSHSP 4012 – Southern Comfort\n\nSHSP 4013 – The Move\n\nSHVL 792 – East Of Eden\n\nSHVL 793 – Deep Purple\n\nSHSP 4014 – Nine Days Wonder\n\nSHSP 4015 – Climax Chicago\n\nSHSP 4016 – Formerly Fat Harry\n\nSHVL 794 – Barclay James Harvest\n\nSHVL 795 – Pink Floyd\n\nSHVL 796 – East Of Eden\n\nSHSS 3 – Various\n\nSHVL 798 – Michael Chapman\n\nSHVL 797 – The Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSHTC 252 – The Edgar Broughton Band\n\nSHVL 799 – Southern Comfort\n\nSHVL 800 – Kevin Ayers\n\nSHVL 801 – Spontaneous Combustion\n\nSHSP 4017 – Chris Spedding\n\nSHSP 4019 – Third Ear Band\n\nSHSP 4020 – Pink Floyd\n\nSHSP 4021 – Southern Comfort\n\nQ4SHVL 788 – Barclay James Harvest\n\nSHVL 805 – Spontaneous Combustion\n\nSHSP 4022 – Babe Ruth\n\nSHSP 4023 – Barclay James Harvest\n\nSHSP 4024 – Climax Chicago\n\nSHVL 807 – Kevin Ayers\n\nSHSP 4025 – Wizzard\n\nSHVL 804 – Pink Floyd\n\nSHVL 809 – Mark-Almond\n\nSHSP 4026 – Jan Akkerman\n\nSHVL 803 – Roy Wood\n\nSHDW 403 – Pink Floyd\n\nSHVL 806 – The Electric Light Orchestra\n\nSHVL 808 – Roy Harper\n\nSHVL 810 – The Edgar Broughton Band\n\nQ4SHVL 781 – Pink Floyd\n\nQ4SHVL 804 – Pink Floyd\n\nSHVL 812 – Babe Ruth\n\nSHSP 4027 – Roy Harper\n\nSHVL 813 – Be Bop Deluxe\n\nSHSP 4028 – Ariel\n\nLABEL DESIGN VARIANTS:\n\n1. The very first releases on Harvest (pre-1970) carried the following information:\n\n“THE GRAMOPHONE CO. LTD” text appears around the top edge of the label\n\n“SOLD IN U.K. SUBJECT TO RESALE PRICE CONDITIONS. SEE PRICE LISTS.” text appears in the top quadrant above “HARVEST”\n\n“MADE IN GREAT BRITAIN” appears in the centre at the base of the label above “UNAUTHORISED PUBLIC PERFORMANCE…” wording\n\n2. The next releases from early 1970 onwards changed slightly thus:\n\n“THE GRAMOPHONE CO. LTD” text appears around the top edge of the label\n\n“SOLD IN U.K. SUBJECT TO …” text has been deleted\n\n“MADE IN GREAT BRITAIN” appears in the centre at the base of the label above “UNAUTHORISED PUBLIC PERFORMANCE…” wording\n\n3. Around mid-1971, an EMI logo was introduced for the first time:\n\n“THE GRAMOPHONE CO. LTD” text appears around the top edge of the label\n\nEMI boxed logo appears above “HARVEST” in the top left quadrant\n\n“MADE IN GREAT BRITAIN” appears in the centre at the base of the label above “UNAUTHORISED PUBLIC PERFORMANCE…” wording\n\n4. Early 1974, the legal entity finally changes to EMI Records Ltd, replacing the original Gramophone Co. Ltd:"
