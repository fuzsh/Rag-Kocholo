        "text": "SEE ALSO COLUMBIA – 45 SLEEVES & DESIGNS\n\nSEE ALSO COLUMBIA CLEF jazz label\n\nThe UK Columbia label was part of EMI, and EMI had been formed by combining The Gramophone Company (HMV) with the Columbia Graphophone Company, yes “Graphophone” in 1931.\n\nIn its early days it had been affiliated with the American Columbia label (the oldest in the world) and shared the “notes” logo. Columbia Graphophone originated in 1917 as part of the US Columbia Phonograph Company from 1887. When the US parent ran into trouble in 1922, the management in the UK bought it out and it became independent. They then reversed matters in 1925 by taking a controlling share in the US company.\n\nIn 1930, EMI and its Columbia label were the world’s biggest label. The companies separated in 1931, and in 1938 the American label became part of Columbia Broadcasting System.\n\nFor thirty years, the name and “Magic notes” logo was used by two totally distinct companies in different parts of the world. They remained associated though, distributing and licensing each other’s discs until 1952, when US Columbia moved to Philips distribution.\n\nWhen American Columbia eventually formed its own UK label in 1961, it had to use the name CBS.\n\nEarlier albums were collections of 78s, as on this 1946 Gene Krupa release of 4 x shellac records, recorded in 1939:\n\nThis next album in the modern 33 rpm sense must be right on the cusp of the separation. This is the US Columbia (CBS) pressing from 1951 … British artist and orchestra:\n\nIt came out the next year on British (EMI) Columbia. Columbia early LPs were classical, and used a standard base design with overprinting. This 1952 issue is by Sir Malcolm Sargent and the London Symphony Orchestra:\n\nSuite For Orchestra Op.19: Dohányi. Sir Malcolm Sargent & London Symphony. #33S 1001, 1952\n\nThe sleeves had a strong cloth edge binding (light brown), and a polythene inner sleeve with a curved bottom.\n\nBoth examples are 1952 and 1953 releases. 33C 1006, 33C 1008\n\nThe next series of generic LP sleeves appear more often on 10″ LPs:\n\nEMI’s attitude to classics is hard to work out. A few classical LPs got onto Parlophone, a lot got on to Columbia and most were HMV. Enough were Columbia. Columbia shares the early stereo classical stereo collectability with HMV. Both labels acted independently. Historically, HMV’s ties with RCA Victor meant they issued their classical material. Columbia were signing up elsewhere.\n\nThe classical competition within EMI was fierce.\n\nThe main HMV and Columbia labels were in practice distinct semi-autonomous bodies, complete with their own staffs, special interests and rivalries. Victor Oloff of HMV and Walter Legge of Columbia enjoyed unprecedented autonomy and independence. They competed against each other for artists, who were under contract to their labels, not EMI. They were also entirely responsible for those artists, the development of their repertoire and the marketing and release of their records. In those circumstances it was by no means unusual for each label to release simultaneously versions of the same work by different artists. This extraordinary, and, by the 1960s, indefensible duplication dated back to the formation of EMI in 1931.\n\nPeter Martland EMI- The first 100 Years\n\nWalter Legge left Columbia in 1964, and from then artists were contracted to EMI, not to Columbia or HMV. The stage was set for 1967 when HMV went all-classical.\n\nColumbia became EMI’s most important label, eclipsing even HMV. In 1952 to 1953, HMV were still ahead with Eddie Fisher and Perry Como, but by 1955 Columbia had moved in front with Ruby Murray and Eddie Calvert. Ruby Murray first charted late in 1954 and had seven Top Ten hits in 1955. She was so prominent that decades later A Ruby Murray was still Cockney rhyming slang for ‘a curry.’\n\nHe’s A Pal of Mine: Ruby Murray, Columbia 78, November 1954\n\nHeartbeat: Ruby Murray, 78 rpm, sleeve reverse\n\nSee Columbia 45 sleeves also\n\nThe very first EMI 45 single was Ray Martin’s Blue Tango (SCM 5001). The record featured at #8 in the first-ever British chart in November 1952, which would have been based on 78 rpm sales. The 45 rpm version appeared in 1953. It’s on thinner vinyl than the later norm, but plays perfectly at seventy years old.\n\nEarly EP designs:\n\nEMI, like Decca, promoted the EP format heavily. Parlophone introduced EPs in December 1954, so it’s likely that Columbia was around the same time. EMI stayed firmly with generic sleeves for EPs and LPs … HMV, Parlophone and MGM all used similar sleeve designs. The centre colour indicated popular or classical. The EPs at this point did not even go for overprinting. They are standard card sleeves for any EP.\n\nEspana Rhapsody: Thomas Beecham, SEL 1509 front, 1954\n\nLa Cambiale di Matrimonio (Espana Rhapsody B-side) : Thomas Beecham, SEL 1509 rear\n\nHow Long Blues (EP): Count Basie & His All-American Rhythm 1955 SEG 7578\n\nHow long Blues (EP): Count Basie 1955 reverse of generic EP sleeve SEG 7578\n\nToy Symphony, Haydn: George Weldon, Philharmonia SED 5509 1956 .\n\nSheep May Safely Graze: Bach. George Weldon, Philharmonia SED 5509. Later copies had picture sleeves\n\nThe next move was a base design with overprinting. I suspect blue was classical, green popular.\n\nGreat Film Themes: The Warsaw Concerto (EP) Charles Williams SEG 7600 September 1955\n\nThree’s Company: The Beverley Sisters (EP) 1955 SEG7602, September 1955\n\nThen comes photographic, and like HMV they had different colours for the same discs. The dated popular ones in this style are 1956 to 1957.\n\nStrauss Family i(EP): Herbert von Karajan / Philharmonia Orchestra SEL 1568, pink or orange\n\nSometimes the photo was portrait rather than landscape. Again the same catalogue number discs appear in different colours. The one with the smaller ‘COLUMBIA’ is older.\n\nEverybody’s Sweetheart (EP): Ruby Murray SEG 7620 January 1956\n\nEverybody’s Sweetheart No. 2 (EP): Ruby Murray 1956\n\nThough these are No 1 and No 2 (both selected from the LP) both appear in both colourways.\n\nIt’s often said that Columbia was the popular music label, with comedy / novelty put on EMI’s sister label, Parlophone. Yet Flanagan & Allan, Stanley Holloway and Hoffnung all appeared on Columbia with comedy records.\n\nColumbia’s later penchant for singing comedians (Ken Dodd, Des O’Connor, Clive Dunn) was previewed with Norman Wisdom’s singles. Norman Wisdom was the diminutive comic from Trouble in Store who became a megastar in 1970s Albania. In 1954 Don’t Laugh At Me (Cos I’m A Fool) was a UK #3 hit, and became his theme tune.\n\nTogether Again: Flanagan & Allan EP SEG 7709 1957. Three colours were printed\n\nA further base style . but they change the font and the photo:\n\nMusic With Mike (EP): Michael Holliday SEG 7683 1957\n\nAll Time Favourites (EP): Michal Holliday SEG 7761 1958\n\nJohnny Duncan & His Blue Grass Boys (EP): Johnny Duncan 1957 round logo\n\nTennessee Sing-A-Long: Johnny Duncan & The Blue Grass Boys 1957 oval logo has appeared\n\nJohnny Duncan & The Blue Grass Boys were a popular British group, starting with Last Train to San Fernando. (UK #2) Johnny Duncan was American born, met and married in Cambridgeshire, England while on US military service, stayed and benefitted from the skiffle scene with an air of authenticity. His band had backed Lonnie Donegan and were British.\n\nThey picked up more folk / C&W Americana from Jimmie Rodgers and Ramblin’ Jack Elliot:\n\nJimmie Rodgers (EP): Jimmy Rodgers 1958 “Roulette Series”\n\nKid Stuff: Children’s Songs by Woodie Guthrie: Ramblin’ Jack Elliot 1960\n\nNorrie Paramour\n\nThe Head of A&R at Columbia was Norrie Paramour, and he held the post right through from 1952 to 1972, then was Head of A&R at EMI until his death in 1979, though his 1952 title had been ‘Recording Director.’ He orchestrated, composed, conducted and produced. He produced 26 number one singles, a record held jointly with his Parlophone counterpart, George Martin, right through until George Martin produced Elton John’s Candle In The Wind tribute to Princess Diana in 1997. Under Paramour, Columbia was EMI’s principal popular and jazz label, that is until The Beatles changed the pecking order with their success on Parlophone. Thus the prized STEREOPHONIC labels appear on HMV (Classical) and Columbia LPs first rather than Parlophone. I regard him as ‘old school’ record industry, and “partial to a writing credit.” The next section I suspect reresents his taste.\n\nMichael Holliday (two Ls) had an extraordinary number of EP releases on Columbia. He had eleven singles hits, and two #1s, The Story of My Life in 1958 and StarryEyed in 1960.\n\nMichael Holliday EPs 1957 -62 (two more earlier and this is only a selection)\n\nRuss Conway\n\nIn my charity shop browsing, Columbia all too often means pub piano tinkler Russ Conway. There are so many LPs, EPs and singles that he must have shifted lot of Columbia vinyl. From 1958 to 1965 he was everywhere. He had twenty chart hits between 1958 and 1963, including two #1 hits, Side Saddle and Roulette. According to Guinness, in the UK he is the third most successul instrumentalist ever. I wouldn’t ever want to hear him again, but his LP sleeves are a 1958 to 1962 (and on to later) time capsule. I present them here as most just pre-date The Beatles and show why Britain’s kids were gasping for them.\n\nRuss Conway LPs\n\nAlma Cogan is a rare example in the early days of switching labels within EMI. She was an HMV regular from 1952 to 1960 with nineteen hits, then switched to Columbia, where she had just the one at #37. Still she was switching to LPs with her fan base, in spite of her friendship with The Beatles.\n\nJazz\n\nThis is the Columbia Clef design. It has a separate section.\n\nSEE ALSO COLUMBIA CLEF jazz label\n\nThe Artistry of Stan Getz: Stan Getz, Columbia Clef EP SEB 1001. 1953 recording re-issued\n\nChris Barber Band Box Volume 1 No 1 (EP): Chris Barber’s Jazz Band 1959\n\nFour Hits & A Mister (EP): Acker Bilk 1961\n\nEvery label did trad jazz circa 1960. Chris Barber appears on every label, but Acker Bilk was a major seller for Columbia.\n\nA Little Tempo Please: Count Basie & His Orchestra, May 1959, Roulette series\n\nAfrican Waltz (EP): Johnny Dankworth, 1961\n\nJohnny Dankworth’s African Waltz was a #9 hit in 1961, and unusually for jazz, wasn’t on Columbia’s Lansdowne Series or Clef series which will be a separate section) and that’s because it was licensed from Roulette in America. EMI put what was considered premium popular material on Columbia … the classy material by John Barry and Johnny Dankworth.\n\nThe It’s Trad Dad! film in 1962 mixed trad with current pop … but only the EMI artists in the film. Licensing was way less sophisticated in those days.\n\nThe Mike Cotton Jazzmen with The Wild and The Willing soundtrack was trad. It’s from a Rank film, and was diverted to Columbia when EMI killed its Top Rank label.\n\nRock on\n\nFrankie Lymon & The Teenagers and Paul Anka were Columbia’s first teenage stars (or as the sleeve notes to the Paul Anka EP have it, “jeanage stars”.) As normal in 50s and 60s Britain, singles were more important than EPs and EPs were more important than LPs.\n\nTeenage Rock (EP): The Teenagers featuring Frankie Lymon 1957 round logo\n\nThe Teenagers featuring Frankie Lymon (EP): Late 1957, short-lived rectangle logo\n\nGoody Goody (EP): Frankie Lymon & The Teenagers November 1957 SEG 7734\n\nPaul Anka (EP, aka “Diana” later): Paul Anka 1957. “A jean-age disc” say the notes. Circle logo\n\nAnka Again (EP): Paul Anka 1958, curved rectangle logo\n\nThe Mudlarks were three siblings, Fred, Jeff and Mary Mudd. They got a British hit with an opportune cover of Lollipop. They combined with The Avons to record My Grandfather’s Clock, giving Columbia two novelty / comedy vocal groups with a taste for covers The Avons did covers of Seven Little Girls Sitting In The Back Seat, Four Little Heels.\n\nWhen Top Rank was closed down in 1962, the American artists went to Stateside, and the British ones were divided between HMV and Columbia. HMV got John Leyton, Columbia got Craig Douglas, who after a #9 hit with Our Favourite Melodies, then departed for Decca. It was Craig’s fourth #9 hit record in a row, the other three being on Top Rank. He could crack the Top Ten, but only just. The EP Craig’s Movie Songs has two Top Rank Singles (both from It’s Trad Dad, where the soundtrack LP had been on Columbia) and a Columbia B-side.\n\nBless You (EP): Tony Orlando 1962, with Epic logo. Both tracks had been Fontana 45s licensed from Epic, which was US Columbia.\n\nCraig’s Movie Songs (EP): Craig Douglas 1963 (two ex-Top Rank singles on one EP)\n\nCliff & The Shadows\n\nEarly Cliff Richard IS authentic rock ‘n’ roll. See OH, BOY! TV show on this site. Norrie Paramour was convinced that Schoolboy Crush was the A-side of his first single. Jack Good made singing Move It a condition for appearing on the TV show Oh, Boy! in 1958 and they switched it. Producer Norrie Paramour had a knack for choosing the wrong A-sides for Cliff. Later he chose The Next Time with Bachelor Boy as the B-side. Then Bachelor Boy has become almost his theme song.\n\nThere were four EPs extracted from Cliff Sings in 1959. 1 and 2 were the rock material, 3 and 4 more ballad oriented. Norrie Paramor decided to take over half the tracks (mainly 3 and 4) from The Drifters, though Tony Meehan drummed on the orchestral tracks.\n\nTracks include Blue Suede Shoes, I Gotta Know, Twenty Flight Rock, Mean Woman Blues, I’m Walking, I Don’t Know Why (But I Do).\n\nIt was possible to do Columbia almost entirely with Cliff Richards and The Shadows singles, or EPs, or LPs and you’ll find plenty of them on sale. There is enough information about them to date them accurately and to match sleeves. Record Collector Rare Record Price Guide notes a strange point about Cliff Richard. Due to continuing popularity, all the “green label” Cliff Richard discs went on to be printed as black centre label discs, Breaking the rule that the earliest versions are worth more, with Cliff Richard, the later black label reissues are worth twice as much. Cliff and The Shadows were far and away the most prolific EP artists of all, and the rarer EPs command good prices.\n\nSEE EPs: The charts. Cliff Richard & The Shadows\n\nCliff Richard / Cliff Richard & THe Shadows LPs\n\nCliff Richard and The Shadows were also the most prolific Columbia artists, with multiple releases every year. See also ‘Number ones’ below. These are just the ones that didn’t get to #1.\n\nWonderful Land by The Shadows held the record of ‘longest at number one’ for years … nine weeks. As well as 45s and EPs, The Shadows did especially well with albums.\n\nShadows LPs 1961 to 1970\n\nChubby Checker Columbia LPs 1960-62\n\nColumbia was also the outlet for Cameo-Parkway at the crucial time … 1960 to 1962 for The Twist and Let’s Twist Again. With Joey Dee’s Peppermint Twist from Roulette, Columbia was the chief twisters label.\n\nDoin’ The Twist: Live at the Peppermint Lounge by Joey Dee and His Starliters stands up as one of the great early live albums, laden with classics that were to fuel the R&B boom.\n\nMore American\n\nThe 2012 One Day Music 2 CD set Gems From The Columbia Vault 1954-1961 shows the range of American artists on Columbia:\n\nColumbia distributed several US labels, Okeh, Gee, and the Mafia’s own Roulette label, owned by Morris Levy, who inspired the character of Hesh Rabkin, the Jewish mafiosi songwriter in The Sopranos. Levy was fond of having writing credits on the songs Roulette released, often in the name of his “secretary” MacGill. Roulette’s roster included Ronnie Hawkins, Frankie Lymon, Joey Dee and the Starliters and Jimmie Rodgers.\n\nMr Dynamo featured Levon Helm of The Hawks, later The Band. A 15 year old Robbie Robertson wrote two songs but didn’t play. Rare Record Guide rates it at £70 mono mint, or £100 in stereo. Discogs records a highest sale of £30, though this would not be mint. I’m surprised. I’ve seen it at £150 and £200 though that was a few years ago. The earlier EP, Rockin’ With Ronnie was on sale at £95 on Discogs and rated at £100 in Rare Record Guide.\n\nThe American connection meant a few unexpected records on Columbia. In 1957, they briefly grabbed both Chess and Atlantic from Decca’s London-American label, but failed to make anything of major American successes: School Day by Chuck Berry (US#3) from Chess, and Lucky Lips by Ruth Brown (US#25), Since I Met You Baby by Ivory Joe Hunter (US#12) and Jim Dandy by LaVern Baker (US#17) from Atlantic.\n\nBobby Vinton was on Epic in the USA, but had UK Columbia hits with Roses Are Red, Rain Rain Go Away and There I’ve Said It Again. I recall a friend looking through my record rack, seeing the first two and exclaiming ‘No! You didn’t buy these!’ But I did.\n\nLater American releases included I Love The Life I Live by Mose Allison, The Monkey Time by Major Lance and Easier Said Than Done by The Essex, before American artists were shifted wholesale to the Stateside label.\n\nJohn Barry\n\nString beat: John Barry, Columbia LP 33SX 1258 (mono), SCX 3401 (stereo)\n\nJohn Barry was at the top of his game. So he got the early popular stereo releases\n\nColumbia always had the reputation as EMI’s premium pop label. It’s noticeable on the soundtrack LP and EP, Beat Girl from 1960. It featured the music of John Barry and the singing of Adam Faith, star of the film. Adam Faith was also Parlophone’s biggest selling artist at the time, but John Barry (Faith’s arranger) takes precedence, and the LP and EP are on Columbia.\n\nColumbia had the handle on Middle-of-the-Road, reflecting Norrie Paramout’s taste. Shirley Bassey was masse and only silly youths (like my friends) called her Burley Chassis.\n\nAs Long As He Needs Me (EP): Shirley Bassey 1960\n\nShirley (EP) Shirley Bassey 1961, what a difference a year makes!\n\nThe Hits of Shirley Bassey (EP): 1963, Columbia square logo\n\nFrank Ifield’s Hits(EP): Frank Ifield, Columbia SEG 8210 1962\n\nFrank Ifield kept the Australian connection going, scoring four number ones in 1962 to 1963. I Remember You was massive. I can’t explain how much I loathed Frank Ifield. She Taught Me To Yodel may top my list of worst song of the era. It was the B-side of Lovesick Blues, another yodelling nightmare. These are rear sleeve notes from the LP Greatest Hits in 1964:\n\nHe kept selling till at least 1967 when he was playing Bournemouth Pavilion for the summer. Apparently he was a nice bloke.\n\nHelen Shapiro\n\nHelen Shapiro, Britain’s answer to Brenda Lee, had her first hit at age fourteen. Little girls with deep voices were popular. Columbia must have defined something about her buyers, because she had FIVE EPs released in just over a year. Only Cliff and The Shadows ever aimed that hard at the EP market. She (or her managers) liked singing old standards, and EPs were a good vehicle for “non-singles” as LPs might have been too pricey for her natural constituency, which I recall as more girls than boys (though I bought several 45s). Her first EP Helen then A Teenager Sings The Blues were all standards, and bear comparison with Brenda Lee’s magnificent All The Way LP. She could sing them.\n\nHelen Shapiro EPs\n\nHelen Shapiro LPs\n\nI the early 1960s, LPs were less important than EPs for the likes of Helen Shapiro. OK, I bought the EPs.\n\nEarly 60s Columbia artists also included Helen Shapiro, Frank Ifield, Ken Dodd, and Rolf Harris.\n\nRolf Harris could be seen as a novelty act (and if so, why wasn’t he on Parlophone?) or a pioneer of world music. Norrie Paramour has recounted that it was immediately obvious that Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport and Sun Arise would be huge hits. It took forty years and a recording of Stairway to Heaven, plus a status as Glastonbury’s legendary oldie to give Rolf his full due. Then look what happened. A long prison sentence. I used to keep his Greatest Hits in the car and spent many journeys with kids listening to it. It was very funny. No longer acceptable. Two Little Boys was said to be Margaret Thatcher’s favourite record. I was told he was smoking grass in the studio while recording it at Abbey Road, a privilege denied to The Beatles who had to go up to the roof.\n\nRolf Harris EPs\n\nKen Dodd had hits with sentimental country & western covers and he could hit the long high notes. He gradually moved towards more comedy, with the dreadful Diddymen, then solo. When I worked on his show in 1968 he was still doing four or five songs amid the comedy. The Diddymen were pre-teen girls with stage mothers,\n\nStill (EP): Ken Dodd 1962 square logo\n\nDoddy & The Diddymen (EP): Ken Dodd 1965\n\nMerseybeat\n\nThe fact that The Beatles were put on Parlophone rather than Columbia was seen as a definite slight by EMI, and one Brian Epstein sought to reverse by getting Gerry & The Pacemakers on Columbia. In the first few months with hits from How Do You Do It? I Like It and You’ll Never Walk Alone it didn’t seem like a bad deal. EMI had tried to get The Beatles to record Mitch Murray’s How Do You Do It and they turned in a deliberately slapdash version. EMI persisted and Gerry & The Pacemakers got the next shot at it and a debut €1 single.\n\nHow Do You Do It? (EP) Gerry & The Pacemakers 1963\n\nYou’ll Never Walk Alone (EP): Gerry & The Pacemakers 1964\n\n(It’s All right on front sleeve, Jambalaya on rear and disc)\n\nIn the Merseybeat era, Columbia also had best-selling records from Freddie and The Dreamers, Herman’s Hermits and The Dave Clark Five. My kids went to the same pre-school nursery as Freddie Garrity’s. Once I was waiting for them and the headmistress decided to introduce me to their mum. ‘This is …’ she struggled to find the name and failed, ‘… Mrs Freddie and The Dreamers.’ ‘Not all of them,’ she replied.\n\nIf You Gotta Make A Fool of Somebody (EP): Freddie & The Dreamers 1963\n\nReady Freddie Go! (EP) Freddie & The Dreamers 1965\n\nSo you have a band where the lead singer plays keyboards and writes the songs. His name is Mike Smith, so you name the band after the non-singing drummer, Dave Clark. The Dave Clark Five did far better in the USA than the UK, arriving at just the right time. Bobby Graham was the session drummer:\n\nBobby Graham: Dave wanted to produce and he couldn’t be up in the box and down in the studio at the same time. Mike Smith had written ‘Glad All Over’ with him and they weren’t too sure what they wanted from the drums. I was playing how I would normally play with the hi-hat, snare and bass and Dave asked, ‘Bobby, can you make that simpler please?’ He didn’t want complicated fill-ins he couldn’t play himself on live dates as that would have given the game away. In the end, I did this four-to-the-bar feel, a flam beat, and he said, ‘That’s lovely.’ I was on a lot of the hits but Dave did play on album tracks. The journalists wanted to catch him out. I got a call from the News Of The World who said, ‘We’ve just spoken to Dave Clark and he has told us that you’re drumming on his records.’ I said, ‘Not me.’ I was paid to do a job and I didn’t see why I should be exposing him.\n\nSpencer Leigh, Independent obituary of Bobby Graham, 23 September 2009\n\nSEE Catch Us If You Can review on Peter Viney’s blog.\n\nThe Dave Clark Five (EP): 1964 Rounds up pre-Glad All Over tracks from 1963, single logo\n\nHits of The Dave Clark Five (EP) 1964 new double logo as on singles: EMI / Columbia\n\nHermans Hermits were a Micky Most produced band, with gap-toothed grinning Peter Noone at the front, deliberately focused for younger fans.\n\nHermania (EP): Herman’s Hermits, 1964\n\nMrs Brown You’ve Got A Lovely Daughter (EP): Herman’s Hermits 1964\n\nHold On! (EP): Herman’s Hermits 1966\n\nPeter & Gordon were hardly Merseybeat, the connection being Paul McCartney writing for his girlfriend’s brother. They had hits. They did more LPs than I ever remembered too between 1964 and 1967. Peter Asher went ion to a major producer / manager career.\n\nColumbia was the label for Richard Anthony, who had the sense to do English pop songs in French, rather than French pop songs in French, or even English with a French accent. Pye had Françoise Hardy for the girls who loved French lessons at school. Columbia had Richard Anthony for those who liked French at school AND boys.\n\nHits a la Français (EP): Richard Anthony 1964\n\nHitsville Français (EP): Richard Anthony 1965\n\nEMI were game for a laugh and partial to parody, and had success with The Barron Knights send-ups of these long-haired yobboes, like Call Up The Groups. While the medleys between 1964 and 1966 raised a grim smile, they were the anti-group in many ways. They went on and on (and on) with other labels.\n\nColumbia R&B, soul and prog\n\nFor the record collector, this is the valuable era.\n\nUm Um Um Um Um Um (EP): Major Lance 1964\n\nTop Gear (EP): Sounds Incorporated 1964\n\nMajor Lance from Okeh, owned by Epic, owned by CBS. How did that get on Columbia? Why wasn’t it on Stateside, already established two years earlier for EMI American licenses? It indicates, as above with classical, the independence and competition between EMI labels.\n\nThen Sounds Incorporated had had the unenviable task of supporting The Beatles (and backing the other support acts) to a sea of booing nightly. That tour must qualify for ‘What are the worst gigs you ever did?’ They would never have been able to hear themselves.\n\nLook at the EMI Soul section. Then add Graham Bond Organization, Ray Barretto, Major Lance. Add some of the mod era EMI releases: early Chris Farlowe, Shotgun Express, Geno Washington, Georgie Fame, Mike Patto, Rod Stewart, Zoot Money. Columbia was one of the largest 60s label and the breadth of material means you should at least read the centre label.\n\nColumbia wasn’t the label of choice for new music in the late sixties, but they scored two number ones with Georgie Fame. Decca had The Rolling Stones. Columbia had The Animals and in 1964 that was a close-run thing. Someone liked organists … Georgie Fame, Zoot Money, Alan Price in The Animals.\n\nAnimals EPs:\n\nThe Animals Is Here (EP): The Animals 1964\n\nThe Animals (EP): The Animals 1965\n\nThe Animals Are Back (EP): The Animals 1966\n\nLPs\n\nThe Animals, The Yardbirds, The Downliners Sect, Trendsetters Ltd., Graham Bond Organization, Jeff Beck and Zoot Money were all on Columbia. Pink Floyd’s first two singles were on the Columbia label before they were shunted off to the new EMI progressive label, Harvest. Led by The Animals, The Yardbirds and Georgie Fame, Columbia had a run from 1964 to 1967 of strong “rock” rather than pop material.\n\nGeorgie Fame\n\nWe are in an era when EPs were more important in the UK, and Columbia’s European markets than LPs.\n\nRhythm & Blues (EP): Georgie Fame 1964\n\nRhythm & Blue Beat (EP): Georgie Fame 1964, all new tracks, not from an LP\n\nFats For Fame (EP): Georgie Fame 1965\n\nGetaway (EP): Georgie Fame 1966\n\nLPs 1964-1966\n\nRhthm & Blues At The Flamingo in 1964 was a seminal R&B release. It’s one everyone had in my peer group. It’s still a great record.\n\nFive Yardbirds (EP): Yardbirds 1965\n\nBig Time Operator (EP): Zoot Money’s Big Roll Band 1966\n\nIt Should’ve Been Me: Zoot Moneys Big Roll Band, Columbia LP 33SX 1734, 1965\n\nZoot!: Zoot Moneys Big Roll Band, Columbia LP SCX 6075, 1966\n\nFive Live Yardbirds: Yardbirds LP 1965\n\nYardbirds: Yardbirds LP 1966\n\nColumbia was attracting the cream of R&B / mod artists 1964 to 1967, but it was losing them too. Sothe cream, but not The Cream. The Graham Bond Organization was Columbia, but Cream went to Reaction, then Polydor.\n\nThere’s a Bond Between Us: Graham Bond Organization, Columbia LP 1964\n\nThe Sound of ’65: Graham Bond Organization, Columbia LP 1965\n\nThe Animals decamped to Decca. Then Eric Burdon solo went to MGM. Georgie Fame was lured to CBS. Chris Farlowe made one record and went to Immediate. When the Yardbirds split, Led Zeppelin signed with Atlantic. Jeff Beck went to Epic. Pink Floyd stayed with EMI, but moved to the new Harvest label. EMI was old school, but so was Decca. You can see why any band which has fulfilled a two or three year contract and had hits should seek new pastures and better money. There’s also the percentages for the managers in switching.\n\nThe new signings were Middle of The Road. The Seekers. Des O’Connor. They took Lulu from Decca and Frankie Vaughan from Philips. Ken Dodd and Rolf Harris were riding high too. Was this Norrie Paramour’s taste coming to the fore? I worked on summer shows and saw Frankie Vaughan, Ken Dodd, Des O’Connor and Frank Ifield so very much Columbia artists in variety shows.\n\nThe Seekers first album was folk club standards territory, produced by Tom Springfield, and made special by the voice of Judith Durham. By Come The Day they had Red Rubber Ball, co-written with Paul Simon, and covers of Island of Dreams, California Dreaming, Turn Turn Turn and Yesterday. They also added Louisiana Man, but the centrepiece was the movie theme Georgie Girl. Seekers Seen in Green had a suitably hazy cray 1967 photo. The thing is, brilliant as they were, they were never, never cool. Judith Durham’s skirts were three inches too long (see Lulu below) then she went floor length. Add the glasses and clean cut look of the men. Double bass was too late for being cool jazz and conjured up Peter, Paul & Mary (an equally under-rated / too popular folk group).\n\nA World of Our Own: The Seekers, Columbia LP 1965 33SX 1722\n\nCome The Day: The Seekers Columbia LP 1966 SCX 6093\n\nSeekers Seen In Green: The Seekers Columbia LP1967 SCX 6193\n\nLive At The Talk of The Town: The Seekers Columbia LP 1968 SCX 6278\n\nIt’s subtle but in 1967, EMI started to replace Columbia on some front LP sleeves. This is the same time as EMI were divvying up the artists – classical to HMV, HMV popular to Columbia, ad deciding to stress the EMI names and contract artists to EMI rather than HMV, Columbia or Parlophone. It is not consistent though. It may depend on contracts and when they were signed.\n\nLulu Loves To LoveL Lulu, Columbia LP SCX 6201 1967, front and rear\n\nLulu did not have a great time with Columbia. To Sir With Love from the film was the best-selling single in the USA in 1967 (licensed to Epic), spending five weeks at #1. She was only the second British female artist to top the US charts.\n\nLulu: I begged Mickie Most to let me do To Sir With Love, but he didn’t want to. Never mind putting it out as a single, he wasn’t even keen to record it. It was the DJs in America who turned it into a hit. They turned it over and wouldn’t play the other side.\n\nIn the UK, in spite of all her protests, Columbia put it out as the B-side of Let’s Pretend (UK #11) and insisted the A-side get the airplay. This was madness, and everyone knew it was, except Columbia.\n\nHer second Columbia album eschewed the cover pictures expected of female stars and went for an unadorned sleeve:\n\nThe Seekers and Lulu (a great rock and soul singer) have some credibility, though Columbia had its eyes firmly set on the Eurovision Song Contest in 1968 and 1969.\n\nIt has become clear that Spain rigged the 1968 contest at government level. The elegantly-titled Spanish entry, La La La by Massiel, won the competition in Spain in 1968. Nearly forty years later it turned out that Cliff’s Congratulations had been the true winner, rather than the runner-up. Cliff took the news philosophically. It had sold millions and made the UK #1 slot anyway, while La La La had languished at a mere #35.\n\nLulu’s Boom-Bang-A-Bang is listed in Britain as the 1969 winner, but it was shared with Spain, France and The Netherlands when four songs got equal points and were declared winners. New rules had to be instituted as a tie-breaker for future contests.\n\nFrom that to this …\n\nPsych\n\nPink Floyd\n\nArnold Layne: The Pink Floyd 1967 #8156\n\nSee Emily Play: The Pink Floyd #8214 June 1967\n\nApples & Oranges: Pink Floyd, November 1967, rare demo sleeve\n\nThe top Columbia artists? Pink Floyd, almost certainly. Though after the third album, Harvest took over the prog acts. Regretfully, I saw them at Hull University in 1968, while they still had ‘the’ in their name, remember very little except I didn’t think they were much good. And no, I wasn’t on anything. That was probably the problem.\n\nThe Piper At The Gates of Dawn: Pink Floyd Columbia LP SX 6157 1967\n\nA Saucerful of Secrets: Pink Floyd Columbia SCX 6258, 1968\n\nMore: Pink Floyd Soundtrack Columbia LP SCX 6346 1969\n\nMore psych\n\nAs well as the Pink Floyd, Columbia released My Friend Jack by The Smoke in July 1967, which begins My Friend Jack eats sugarlumps … making it the most overt LSD record so far. It had been recorded in 1966, so these lads were early-adopters, or rather early dopers, but Sir Joseph Lockwood had the lyrics explained to him and went apeshit. It was delayed and re-recorded losing the line after eats sugarlumps which is Oh, what beautiful things he sees. The pirates, who had little time left anyway before the Marine Broadcasting Act put them off air in August, seized upon it and played it repeatedly, pushing it #45 in the charts whereupon it was banned by the BBC. The News of The World called it this disgraceful disc. It sold like hot cakes in Europe, reaching #1 in the German chart and staying there for weeks. Producer Monty Babson had thought it perfect for Germany in the first place, not because of the druggy lyrics, but because of its solid marching rhythm. The LP it’s Smoke Time was released in Germany, squashed in the UK.\n\nThere was significant psych in 1968 to 1969, from Pink Floyd most obviously, but also The Gods (basically Uriah Heep meets ELP) … Ken Hensley, Lee Kerslake, Greg Lake.\n\nGenesis: The Gods Columbia LP SCX 6286 1968\n\nTo Samuel A Son: The Gods, Columbia LP SCX 6372, 1970\n\nThe rarer Columbia singles are valuable. Reflections of Charles Brown by Rupert’s People is an example. It was also a July 1967 release, and utilises Bach’s Air On A G String just as Procul Harum had done six weeks earlier with A Whiter Shade of Pale on rival Decca group label Deram. It had considerable airplay on pirate radio too. The writer was Rod Lynton, and the singer was Tim Andrews with superb backing from Mod favourites, Les Fleurs de Lys. They declined to appear under their own name as they were embarrassed by the, er, similarity.\n\nJeff Beck\n\nJeff Beck / The Jeff Beck Group are more straight rock than psych? Ys? No? Anyway, he had a pop hit single with Hi Ho Silver Lining and did two Columbia LPs:\n\nTruth: Jeff Beck, Columbia LP 1968 SX 6293\n\nBeck-Ola: Jeff Beck Group, Columbia LP 1969 SX 6351\n\nThe areas above are the valuable Columbia areas. This is a collectors check, on original issues. Most have been reissued, and the price only refers to the first runs. Interestingly, where the mono was often preferred as the original UK mix, and Rare Record Guide reflects this with higher values, stereo seems to overtake on Discogs actual sales. Perhaps a younger and more international sampling don’t know the mono was the first choice.\n\nLPs & EPs\n\n1967 changes\n\nColumbia were still motoring on with classical LPs through the 60s, and had a good supply of E-types for sleeves, incongruous as that may be.\n\nIn 1967, HMV became a classics only label and its roster of artistes were moved to Columbia. Apart from their brief flirtation with Pink Floyd, by 1967 Columbia was becoming classifiable as a solidly middle of the road label, as a glance at their list of best sellers shows. Look back at the late fifties as well … the inclination was always there. With artists like Paul Jones the shift from HMV to Columbia was barely noticeable.\n\nThe Columbia name was dropped in late 1972, and Columbia artists all became plain EMI (see EMI). The last three number ones were Rolf Harris with Two Little Boys, Clive Dunn with Grandad and Benny Hill with Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in The West). Columbia had taken over Parlophone’s role as comedy / novelty label. Rolf Harris was a tearjerker rather than comedy, but until then he’d been known for comic records.\n\nPermission To Sing Sir: Clive Dunn, Columbia LP 1970 SCX 6434\n\nWords & Music: Benny Hill, Columbia 1971 SCX 6479\n\nCliff Richard’s last Columbia single in November 1972 was A Brand New Song, notable for being almost his only-non-charting single. His next, Power to All Our Friends in March 1973, was in an EMI sleeve. In July 1972, Rolf Harris’s Tutankhamun (cashing in on the exhibition in London) had a picture sleeve with only the EMI logo, but the disc inside had a Columbia label.\n\nThe name appeared to be defunct, but appeared again in 1978 on Middle of the Road / Archive material. Some of it was in the Nostalgia ain’t what it used to be vein that United Artists were mining. DB 9050 was Marlene Dietrich. The most successful was Iris Williams vocal take on Cavatina (DB9070). In between came Bernie Winters with a comedy How d’you do. The last EMI Columbia label we have found is on Soul Sister’s The Way To Your Heart in 1989 (DB9175).\n\nIn 1988, after Sony had bought American Columbia / CBS, the rights to the Columbia name outside North America and Japan were acquired by Sony. Records labelled Columbia after 1988 should be ones issued by the US company, part of the Sony group, and from 1993 the musical notes logo belonged to Sony / CBS again. The 1989 Soul Sister release looks as if it was after the changeover. Replica style Cliff Richard singles in recent years also carry the Columbia name on EMI.\n\nIn 2018, Sony had an idea for Record Store Day. They owned the old Columbia name and logo acquired in 1993. So when they reissued Piper At The Gates of Dawn for Record Store Day,. Sony’s Columbia label was able to use the record’s original competing EMI Columbia design though in gold to show the 50th anniversary.\n\nColumbia number ones\n\nColumbia select discs\n\nHere’s an oddity that I found in 2024. it’s a die-cut generic Columbia sleeve:\n\nIt’s clearly labeled LONG PLAY 33 1/3 so it’s not as I first thought, a 12″ single sleeve. It contained a 1973 LP Theatreland Show Stoppers 1926-1939 (SX 6551). It was £1. I’ve never heard of generic company LP sleeves with die cut centre holes being used when proper picture sleeves ran out. Discogs solves the problem. It was a 2 LP box set, so these were inner sleeves (but they had a paper sleeve inside them)."
