        "text": "by Sheldon Rocha Leal\n\nThe role of the recording studio has changed immeasurably since its heyday in the 1950s to the 2000s. Prior to the advent of modern technology there were certain things that could only be achieved in a recording studio, which now are easily replicated on a computer, utilising a good quality microphone, in a person’s house. Queen for example were never able to fully perform “Bohemian Rhapsody” live because there were certain things that were done in the recording studio, that could not be reproduced live. Furthermore, because certain studios housed different equipment, and because the acoustics in each room differs materially from other facilities, artists used to book time in specific studios to obtain a specific sound. For this reason and because of the prohibitive cost of using a professional recording studio, many of the big venues of old have shut down.\n\nCosts aside, there is nothing like the sound quality one can obtain when hiring a professional studio, no matter how good one’s computer, software or microphones are in a home setting. The thought and care invested by sound engineers, architects and acousticians in the creation of a recording studio cannot be matched by a home studio. A home studio must always factor in background sounds and interruptions that will not be experienced in an environment that has been professionally customised to replicate sound. But that is dependent on what the artist is trying to achieve as an end product. For example, in 2010 The Gorillaz recorded their album, “The Fall”, on an iPad. Kylie Minogue recorded the vocal for her 2020 album “Disco” in her living room in the midst of the pandemic.\n\nThe mystique of a recording studio and what can be achieved in these spaces has always fascinated me and for the first time in 2017 I wrote an article about these “Music Industry Gateways”. I see them as transitional zones between the music world and the music business. I followed that article with another in 2019 and have so far explored over 20 recording studios from around the world. Some are still operational and some have sadly closed down. In my journey I have learnt a lot of about different types of recording studios and how these spaces are used. I’m most fascinated by residential studios, which are places where bands and artists resided while creating and recording their albums. In this article I will explore another 10 recording studios.\n\nRockfield Studios (Wales)\n\nRockfield Studios, started by brothers Kingsley and Charles Ward on a farm purchased by their family in the 1950s, is one of the world’s first residential studios. It’s also considered the second most significant recording studio in England after Abbey Road. The farm was originally a Shire Horse breeding centre and was run as a livestock farm with 500 pigs and milking cows. The brothers were encouraged to start a band, whilst at school, in the midst of the 1950s Rock ‘n Roll craze after Charles fell in love with Elvis Presley’s music. They recorded a demo on a borrowed tape deck, which they used to secure a recording deal. Joe Meek eventually signed the band, after they were rejected by Sir George Martin.\n\nWhilst working with Joe Meek, in London, the brothers took note of his recording techniques and were inspired to start their own studio. In Wales they initially set up a studio in the attic of their parent’s main house using rudimentary recording equipment, which they used to record local acts. In 1963 they converted one of the abandoned farm houses into a recording studio, lining the walls with pig feed bags for insulation and invested in an 8-track tape deck. In 1965 they opened the farm as a residential recording studio. Eventually the facility consisted of 2 studios: The Coach House a 150 Sqm studio completed in 1968 and The Quadrangle a 170 Sqm studio completed in 1973.\n\nQueen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” was partially recorded at The Quadrangle. The list of acts who recorded at Rockfield is long and includes Coldplay, The Manic Street Preachers, Oasis, Sepultura, Simple Minds, Opeth, Black Sabbath, Joan Armatrading and Judas Priest. Mike Oldfield, The Cult, Robert Plant, Iggy Pop, Annie Lennox, Julian Lennon and George Michael, also recorded at Rockfield. In the 1980s facing financial ruin, due to altering recording music trends, the brothers parted ways and split the farm. Kingsley kept control of the Rockfield half, whilst Charles converted a semi-derelict manor house on the farm, formerly used as rehearsal space, into Monnow Valley Studio. Charles award passed away on 27 July 2022.\n\nClearwell Castle Studios (England)\n\nClearwell Castle is a Gothic Revival house, built in 1727, located in Clearwell, in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire. It was built by Thomas Wyndham, designed by Roger Morris and is the earliest Georgian Gothic Revival castle in England. It was the Wyndham family home for more than 150 years. The castle was designated a Grade II listed building in 1984. There are 4 other structures on the property that also attained a Grade II listing in 1984. These include the main gate and flanking lodges, gatehouse and flanking stables, statue of a man, child and sphinx 30m from the main gate.\n\nThe castle left Wyndham hands in 1890 after the death of the Dowager Countess Caroline. In the early parts of the 1900s it suffered a few mishaps including a major fire and was designated to be demolished. In 1952 Frank Yeates, the son of a former gardener at the castle, bought the property and set out to restore it. In 1973 Frank Yeates passed away and the family ran a residential recording studio and rehearsal space from the castle, which included an underground recording facility. The recording studio occupied a space in the mansion known as “The Quiet Room”, whilst bands were accommodated in the different rooms in the mansion whilst recording.\n\nMost famously Black Sabbath recorded their 5th studio album at Clearwell in 1973, “Sabbath Bloody Sabbath”, after a dry spell in Los Angeles at The Record Plant. Other acts who recorded at the studio include, Peter Frampton, Deep Purple, Queen, Bad Company, Mott The People and Whitesnake. Led Zeppelin reconvened at the studios after some time apart to record their 8th and final studio album “In Through The Outdoor”, which peaked at No1 USA/U.K. and shipped 6million units in the USA alone. The Yeates family sold the castle in the 1980s and it is now run as a wedding venue.\n\nRidge Farm Studios (England)\n\nRidge Farm Studios are located in a medieval farmhouse originally constructed in the mid-1600s. The house has been renovated and altered over the centuries and is situated in Capel, Surrey, England. The studios are another of Britains oldest residential studios and the property occupies 12 acres (49,000 Sqm) of the English countryside, featuring gardens, orchards, meadows and woodlands. The Andrews family purchased the estate and in 1975 their son, Frank Andrew’s, after returning from a world tour, determined that his parents had moved to another location leaving the house empty. At this point he enlisted the help of his brother, Billy, to create a quiet place where bands could rehearse. The bands that originally used the space would bring their own equipment as none was provided.\n\nRecording companies loved the concept of a residential recording studio, a novel concept at the time, because they could keep an eye on their acts. Additionally, because band members were isolated in a remote location it was easy to drag a musician out of bed if they failed to attend a session. Prior to starting the studio Frank worked as a lighting technician, who toured the globe with some of the world’s greatest recording artists, people like Queen, ABBA and The Rolling Stones. This meant he had many connections going into the venture, which articulated into financial gain. With the money he made at the farm he eventually purchased it from his parents.\n\nThe studios operated between 1975 and were shut down in 2003 after bookings started to dwindle. The last act to record at Ridge Farm was New Wave musician Joe Jackson in 2002. What attracted many musicians to the studios was the natural acoustics of the barn venue. Today the farm operates as a functions venue, hosting weddings, conferences and corporate events. Oasis recorded “Be Here Now” at Ridge Farm and Ozzy Osbourne recorded three of his solo albums there as well. Other acts to record on the site included, Jethro Tull, Roxy Music, Peter Gabriel, a-ha, Trevor Horn, Stock Aitken and Waterman, Wet Wet Wet, Pearl Jam, Muse, Jamie Cullum and Bonnie Tyler.\n\nThe Farm (England)\n\nThe Farm studios were set on an 80 acre estate, known as Fisher Lane Farm, situated in Fisher Lane, Chiddingfold Surrey, England. The property initially consisted of a Grade II listed farm house and a single cowshed built in the 1500s, which originally operated as a dairy farm. By the late 1970s Genesis were looking for a location where they could record their masters at their leisure, without interference from their label and the time pressures associated with using a commercial recording studio. In 1979 the band’s guitar technician was tasked with finding a space the band could use to rehearse and record. Fisher Lane Farm was found and purchased and the name Farm Studios was registered as a business in November 1980.\n\nAfter purchasing the estate the band set about converting the cowshed into a recording studio, which came with its challenges as it was a protected structure. Between 1981 – 1984 a series of additions and alterations took place, overseen by architect John Flynn, and sound experts Andy Munro and Masami “Sam” Toyishima. The studio went from being a mere cowshed to containing a control room, live room, main studio and editing suite. There was even a room where instrument repairs took place known as “The Up All Night Department”. The main house was used as a place where artists could host writing sessions and the Genesis band was sometimes accommodated there. Additional enhancements, refinements and additions took place at the studios over the years.\n\nGenesis recorded all their albums at the studios between 1981 – 1997. Additionally, the studios were used to record many of the albums released by the individual members of the band and Mike + The Mechanics. Furthermore, Eric Clapton, George Harrison and David Crosby recorded at The Farm. In 2016 the Fisher Lane Farm entity was dissolved and by the 2010s it was reported that most of the studio equipment had been sold, with the studios becoming the domain of Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford. By 2022 it was communicated that Tony Banks had bought Mike Rutherford’s share of the estate in order for his son to convert the barn into a residence.\n\nTownhouse Studios (England)\n\nTownhouse Studios were built in 1978 under the supervision of Sir Richard Branson as part of Virgin Music and were located on Goldhawk Road, Shepherd’s Bush, London. The studios were managed by Barbra Jeffries as part of the larger Virgin Studios Group and consisted of 3 studios known as Town House Studio One, Two and Four, all designed by “Sound Guru” Sam Toyashima. In 1984 Town House Studio Three was opened in Battersea, which was the former Ramport Studios, formerly owned by The Who. Townhouse Studio Two was the first studio in the U.K. to install a Solid State console in 1978 (SL 4000 B Series). In 1995 Solid State Logic, commemorated their partnership with the studios by installing their 1,000th console in Townhouse Studio One.\n\nTownhouse Studio Two’s “Stone Room” became a popular place for artists to record drum sounds in the 1980’s, after producer Hugh Padgham’s treatment of the drums on Phil Collins’ hit “In The Air Tonight”. Other famous artists to record there include Kylie Minogue, Duran Duran, Jamiroquai, Robbie Williams, Peter Gabriel, The Sex Pistols and Joan Armatrading. Bob Dylan recorded “To Fall In Love With You” in 1986 at the studios, which is considered one of his greatest masterpieces. Only one take of those sessions exist. Sir Elton John recorded the 1997 version of “Candle In The Wind” (a tribute to Princess Diana), the biggest selling single in Pop history, at the studios.\n\nIn 1992 Sir Richard sold Virgin Records to EMI, which included the Virgin Studios Group, which in turn included Town House Studios. Sanctuary Group bought the studios from EMI in 2002 and at the time Al Stone, a recording engineer who originally trained at Town House, took over as manager of the facility until 2006. Universal Records eventually purchased the site and closed it in 2008. Developers bought the building for about £7.5million, spent £8million transforming it into luxury apartments, which they landed up selling for about £2million each.\n\nFAME (USA)\n\nFAME (Florence Alabama Music Enterprises) situated in Muscle Shoals, Alabama predates their more famous competitor Muscle Shoals Sound Studio. The studios were founded in 1959 by Rick Hall, Billy Sherrill and Tom Stafford. It was originally located above a pawn shop called “Uncle Sams” where musicians bought/pawned their instruments. In 1960 Rick took sole ownership of the studios and moved them to a tobacco warehouse in Muscle Shoals. He recorded his first artist from Muscle Shoals at the studios in 1961, Arthur Alexander, and his hit “You Better Move On” generated enough money to allow him to move the studios to their current location in Avalon Street. FAME was declared an Alabama Heritage site in 1997.\n\nThe first hit to be recorded at FAME was “Steal Away” by Jimmy Hughes in 1963. The studio’s popularity and fame grew exponentially as the decade progressed. By the mid 1960s it was the epicentre of the Pop world, with artists from around the globe congregating at the site. Between 1964 – 1974 Rick ran a spin-off record label called FAME Records, which was distributed by various majors. Aretha Franklin credited Hall for the turning point in her career in mid-1960s. Rick articulated that the secret to the success of the studios was the fact that he didn’t discriminate against race at his facility. Another secret to FAME’s success were the session musicians who played on all the recordings.\n\nThere were two main ensembles that worked at FAME: The Muscle Shoals Horns and Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. After a disagreement with Hall in 1969 the 4 main members of The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section (Barry Beckett, Jimmy Johnson, Roger Hawkins and David Hood) left and started Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in opposition to FAME. The studios continued to generate hits into the 21st century, but Rick Hall eventually passed away in 2018 aged 85. Some of the biggest names to record at FAME include, The Rolling Stones, Jerry Wexler, Demi Lovato, Wilson Pickett, The Blind Boys of Alabama, Candi Staton, Little Richard and Etta James.\n\nMilestone Studios (South Africa)\n\nThe recording studios were started in Cape Town in 1987 by Murray Anderson, Patrick Lee Thorp and Zayn Adam and were established to record demo songs for songwriters that were signed to Mountain Records. The studios were the first tenant of the Old Castle Brewery Building in Woodstock. Eventually Murray bought out his partners and moved the studios to the UCA Building on Bloem Street in Cape Town, where it remained until 2004. At the time there was only one studio, but it was big enough to record a band or a choir. Murray Stewart who worked at Sonovison in Johannesburg joined as a partner in 1993 and helped with the exponential growth of the studios. In 2004 the site on which the studio currently resides was purchased and a developer started constructing the new studios with the assistance of an architect, acousticians and sound experts.\n\nThe new Milestone was built over a 3 year period and now consists of 5 studios. These include: Studio 1 (Music Studio); Studio 2, 3 and 5 (Television and Radio Post-Production); Studio 4 (Television and Radio Post-Production, Film Sound Design and Music Composition). In 2007 Murray Stewart decided to retire and become a farmer and departed as a partner. Many iconic artists have recorded at the studios including, Lesley Rae Dowling, Robin Auld, Mike + The Mechanics, Annie Lennox, Queen, Cape Town Philharmonic Orchestra and Abdullah Ibrahim. As Murray Anderson is an accomplished award winning jingle writer and score composer the studios also delved into this aspect of recording.\n\nMilestone have produced commercials for the likes of Isuzu, Markhams, Smirnoff, Klipdrift, Hyundai and Amarula. Additionally, the engineers at the studio have created and produced music for various television and motion picture projects such as: “Jacob’s Cross”, “In My Country”, “Jozi”, “Hopeville” and “Last White Man Standing”. In 2005 Murray and Warrick Stock won a Gemini Award, issued by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, for the music they composed for “Madiba: The Life And Times Of Nelson Mandela”. Various other awards have also been won for works created at Milestone.\n\nPolar Studios (Sweden)\n\nPolar Studios were started by Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Anderson of ABBA and their manager Stig Anderson in 1978 in an old movie theatre, situated on No58 Sankt Eriksgatan, Stockholm, Sweden. At the time the band was spending a lot of time in studios and wanted to consolidate all their recording efforts in one location, hence the search for a venue. Stig formerly started Polar Music Label in 1963, prior to discovering ABBA, and the Polar Music Prize in association with the Royal Academy of Music in 1989. “Sportpalatset” (The Sports Palace), the movie theatre, was originally constructed in about 1930 and got its name from the public bath and other sports facilities contained therein. The public bath was eventually closed down in the mid-1950s. Björn, Benny and Stig found the Sportpalatset and purchased the entire building in 1977.\n\nAfter purchasing the Sportpalaset, construction commenced on the studios, which took about a year to complete. The complex consisted of two studios: Studio A, featuring a solid state desk and 4 separate isolated rooms with varying acoustics; Studio B, the live recording room. At the time Polar were the most technologically advanced studios in the world. By 1984 the band lost interest in working together and Stig purchased the building from Björn and Benny. Six months later Stig sold Polar Studios to his daughter, son-in-law and their business partner. Skandia, a Swedish insurance company, later bought the building and decided to convert it into a private housing cooperative. In 2004 after negotiations broke down with Skandia it was decided to move Polar Studios elsewhere.\n\nPolar Studios changed location a few times, firstly at Kingside Studios, with the final location being Hammarby Sjöstad. In 2015 it was decided to scale down operations and the equipment was moved into storage. ABBA recorded their final 3 studio albums at Polar, along with every major recording artist in Sweden. Led Zeppelin recorded their 8th studio album, “In Through The Out Door” in 1979 at Polar and Genesis their 10th studio album, “Duke” in 1980. Other recording artists who recorded at Polar included, Céline Dion, Backstreet Boys, Burt Bacharach, The Beastie Boys, Adam Ant, Big Country, Belinda Carlisle, Roxette, Robyn, The Cardigans and The Ramones.\n\nWest Indies Records Limited/Dynamic Sounds (Jamaica)\n\nWest Indies Records Limited (WIRL) was a recording studio started by Jamaican/Lebanese Edward Seaga in 1958, who became the 5th Prime Minister of Jamaica. After completing an Anthropology degree at Harvard in which he researched Jamaican Folk music and Afro-Jamaican religious cults he became interested in Jamaican popular music and pursued a career as a music producer and promoter. He eventually took a research post at the University of the West Indies and based on his research started his own company. He purchased Federal Records from Ken Khouri, started in 1954, which consisted of a recording press and studio, complete with two-track recording facilities and changed the name to WIRL.\n\nThe Jamaican music industry revolved around Federal Records, with many producers cutting their records at the facility. After changing the company name to WIRL he focused on discovering, producing, recording, promoting and distributing Jamaican and West Indian music. One of the first acts to emerge from the company was a band called Higgs & Wilson, who’s song “Manny Oh” (1960) shipped more than 25,000 units in Jamaica. Higgs & Wilson famously mentored Bob Marley and The Wailers. The secret to WIRL’s success was Edward’s ability to get music playlisted on radio, which helped boost record sales. He eventually obtained the franchise for Columbia Records in Jamaica. Another act that Edward discovered was Byron Lee and the Dragonaires, who went on to attain worldwide recognition as Reggae artists even before Bob Marley.\n\nByron had a hit with his WIRL debut titled “Dumplings” in 1959, released on Bluebeat Records. He further entrenched his popularity when one of his songs appeared on the James Bond “Dr. No” soudtrack (1962). In 1964 he bought WIRL from Seaga, who by then was a government minister focused on pursuing a political career. Byron changed the studio’s name to Dynamic Sounds. He formed a relationship with Ahmet Ertegun, founder of Atlantic Records, which facilitated the release of Caribbean music in the USA. Dynamic Sounds became the best equipped recording studio in the Caribbean and attracted artists from the region and world. Many iconic artists recorded at the studios including Cat Stevens, Bob Marley, Eric Clapton, Paul Simon recorded “Mother & Child Reunion” in 1972, Chaka Demus & Pliers recorded “Murder She Wrote” in 1992 and The Rolling Stones recorded “Angie” in 1973.\n\nStudio 301 (Australia)\n\nThe studios were originally established in 1926 as a subsidiary of the British Columbia Graphophone Company and were known as Columbia Graphophone Studios. It was Australia’s first record factory and studio. In 1954 the studios were relocated to 301 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, at the time the EMI head office, and were renamed EMI Studios. Their primary function was to produce jingles, film scoring, programming for radio and some record label releases. In 1978 the studios were completely rebuilt and equipped, featuring 4 studios and were renamed Studio 301. A year later Australia’s first digital recording was made at Studio 301. EMI eventually sold the studios in 1996 and the facility was compressed into one studio, one mixing studio, a programming suite and a mastering operation.\n\nTom Misner, the founder of SAE Institute and an engineer and producer by profession, purchased the studios in 1998 and relocated and rebuilt the studios at No18 Mitchell Road, Alexandria, Sydney, at a cost of AUS$8million. Studio 301 Germany opened in 2001 and in 2011 the studios were sold again and relocated when the SAE Group was sold to Navitas, who oversaw the opening of 6 more studios at the new facility in 2012. The studios were relocated for the last time in 2017 to 3 Ellis Avenue, Alexandria, where the facility was completely reconstructed in a project that cost millions of dollars and took 16 months.\n\nThe new studios were designed and overseen by Dr Tom Misner and Jochen Veith and were doubled in size, consisting of 4 Recording/Mixing Rooms, 3 Mastering Studios and 4 pre-production rooms. Today Studio 301 is the largest recording facility in the Southern Hemisphere and the only Tier One studio in Australia. In the 97 year history of Studio 301 some of the greatest recording artists have recorded there. These include, Lady Gaga, Coldplay, U2, David Bowie, INXS, The Black Eyes Peas, Justin Bieber, Kanye West, Bob Dylan, Snoop Dogg, Sir Elton John, Lana Del Rey, Lizzo and The Weeknd.\n\nThe recording studios represented in this article hail from 7 different countries in 4 continents, highlighting some of the most influential and less influential recording territories of the world. These powerful businesses not only impact music creation, but also economies, politics and music tourism as witnessed with West Indies Records Limited. The latter studios brought some of the world’s greatest talent to Jamaica and propelled its founder to the highest office in the country. The history of these recording studios is fascinating and their impact on Pop music undeniable. The impact these studios have had on the music creation process and the success of many artists is as essential as the music creators themselves.\n\nFor this reason many superstars sought out studios other artists used to capture the essence of their sound in the creation of their own music. Besides for the acoustics unique to each studio, the equipment contained in these spaces was usually bespoke and designed specifically for the site, especially the sound recording desks. The result is that many of the desks used in these studios have been purchased and repurposed in modern studios, like “holy grails” of Pop/Rock. Dave Grohl for one is a famous collector of these iconic sound recording desks, as ventilated in the documentary “Sound City”. Unfortunately, some of these spaces have been shut down, which is a sign of the times, but it does not minimise or undermine the impact they have had as music industry gateways."
