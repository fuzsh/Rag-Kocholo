        "text": "Black history on record started with orchestra and gospel music by groups like the Fisk Jubilee Singers and the Jim Europe Military Band and a few vaudevillians like Bert Williams, Robert Woolsey, and Laughing Jim, but black jazz started with Mamie Smith’s Okeh 4169 “Crazy Blues/It’s Right Here for You.” Both songs were described on the label as “popular blues songs”; the date was November 1920. The record sold pretty well and it became apparent to the record companies that there was a heretofore untapped market, the black record-buying public, forming about 10 percent of the total population. Within a year three major record companies, Okeh, Paramount, and Columbia started black music sections advertised as “race records.” A fourth major label, Victor Records, entered the market in 1924.\n\nOkeh (General Phonograph Corporation, New York City) initiated an 8000 race series in 1921 with the first releases featuring artists such as Esther Bigeou, Lizzie Miles, and Sara Martin. Mamie Smith’s output continued for some reason to appear on Okeh’s on-going General/Popular 4000 series into late 1923. Some of Mamie Smith’s non-vocal Jazz Hound sides wound up on the 8000, indicating a marketing effort to bring record buyers over to the new series.\n\nParamount (New York Recording Company, a subsidiary of the Wisconsin Chair Company of Port Washington, Wisconsin) started a race series, their 12000 series in mid-1922 with the first releases featuring such artists as Alberta Hunter, Monette Moore, and Gladys Bryant. Paramount, like Okeh, recorded in New York City.\n\nColumbia (Columbia Graphophone Company, New York City), also recording in New York, led the way with their releases on the popular A3000 series of such artists as Mary Stafford and Edith Wilson. With their two heavy hitters, Bessie Smith and Clara Smith, leading the way (again on the A3000 series), Columbia emerged as a major blues label. They started a 13000 race series at the end of 1923 but switched to 14000 after eight issues because of the buying public’s fear of the number 13.\n\nThe big three dominated the market, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total blues and gospel releases. However, between 1921 and 1926 race records were issued on more than 15 different labels, such as Emerson, Pathe/Perfect, Arto, Cameo, Black Swan (acquired by Para-mount in April 1924), Edison, Gennett, Ajax, Brunswick, and Aeolian’s Vocalion label (sold to Brunswick in late 1924).\n\nBetween 1923 and 1926 the great majority of blues records were by professional singers, who sang for city audiences using a 12-bar blues style along with a few traditional and popular numbers. The companies made little effort to seek out good or new talent. They relied on contacting singers who happened to be performing in the New York area or, in many cases, on the singer contacting them.\n\nHowever, in 1923, too many record companies were chasing too few singers. The more popular singers contracted to one of the Big Three, the lesser-known singers recorded for the minor companies. For example, Rosa Henderson, Lena Wilson, and Hazel Myers each appeared on six different labels and Edna Hicks on seven."
