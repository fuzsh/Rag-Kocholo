        "text": "Pink Floyd\n\nU.K.\n\nSampler LP Discography\n\nby Vernon Fitch\n\nwith contributions from Ingo Brode, Peter Grew, Tor Martin Kristiansen & Chris Sellers\n\n© copyright Vernon Fitch / The Pink Floyd Archives\n\nThis is a discography of vinyl LP sampler albums that have been released in the United Kingdom by Pink Floyd.\n\nAny comments, corrections or additions to this discography would be appreciated.\n\nQuick Click Guide\n\n[Samplers]\n\n[The Pink Floyd Discographies Page]\n\n[Reference Directory] [Pink Floyd Archives home page]\n\nAlbums\n\nSamplers\n\nThe Age of Enlightenment BBC Playground Before the Fall The 80s - The Album of the Decade EMI Summer Sounds - Volume 3 Pop Filmtracks: The Best of British Film Music\n\nFilmtrax Records 1st issue Filmtrax Records 2nd issue\n\nHarvest Heritage 20 Greats The Harvest Story, Volume 1 The Marquee - 30 Legendary Years Picnic - a breath of fresh air Quadrafile - Four Speakers, Four Systems, Four Sides Rock Legends The Summit Supertracks Underground Show A Voice to Remember\n\nRelease and Dating Information\n\nBar Codes: Scan codes on album covers made their appearance in the early 1980s, either in 1980 or 1981.Catalog Numbers: Catalog numbers are the letters and numbers assigned to a particular record, and can be found printed on the cover, label, and matrix of a record.Label color and text - Harvest Records:\n\nColor:\n\nBeginning with the release of the Pink Floyd album, Ummagumma in late 1969, Pink Floyd albums were released on Harvest Records with yellow / green Harvest Record labels. (they look green to me, but some people call them yellow)\n\nIn 1972, Harvest Records added a small EMI logo in a rectangular box above the word Harvest on the left side of the label. This logo is in the same yellow / green colors as the rest of the Harvest label.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Harvest Records changed to a black Harvest label with silver text.\n\nText:\n\nFrom 1967 until approximately 1975, the text around the edge of the labels included the wording: \"The Gramophone Co. Ltd.\"\n\nBeginning in 1975, \"The Gramophone Co. Ltd.\" text around the edge of the labels was changed to: \"EMI Records Ltd.\" In approximately 1982, the text around the edge of the labels was changed to end with: \"Manufactured in the U.K. by EMI Records Limited.\"\n\nMatrix Information: Matrix information is the letters and numbers etched into the vinyl near the label in the runoff groove at the end of each side of a record. Matrix information may include:\n\nCatalog number.\n\nSide number.\n\nLacquer master number.\n\nStamper letter. (usually found at the 3 o'clock position)\n\nMother number. (usually found at the 9 o'clock position)\n\nRecord pressing plant.\n\nThe engineer who cut the lacquer.\n\nExample: The matrix information, SRS 5071 A-1 G 1, found on side one of the Starline Records pressing of Relics indicates:\n\nSRS 5071 A-1 is the lacquer master number (this includes the catalog number SRS 5071)\n\nG is the stamper letter\n\n1 is the mother number\n\nStampers are made from the Mothers. Mothers are made from the fathers. Fathers are made from the lacquers. And the lacquers are cut from the master tapes.\n\nStamper Codes: The stamper codes used by Columbia/EMI Records are based on \"Gramophone Ltd.\" and are as follows:\n\nG=1\n\nR=2\n\nA=3\n\nM=4\n\nO=5\n\nP=6\n\nH=7\n\nL=8\n\nT=9\n\nD=0\n\nExample: A record with a \"G\" stamper letter indicates that the record was made from the first stamper. Later pressings may have stamper numbers in combination, such as \"AD\" which means 30.\n\n***The matrix information listed in this discography is not complete. This is known matrix information only. If you have a record with matrix information that is not listed here, please send me the information!***\n\nRecord Pressing Plants - All EMI Records in the 1960s through the 1980s were pressed at their Uxbridge Road pressing plant in outer London, known as the EMI Village. These vinyl pressing plants were closed down in the early 1990s and everything since then has been subcontracted out.Sealed Albums - Record albums in Britain were never sealed in shrink wrap by either Columbia or Harvest Records. However, often times record shops would seal the records themselves upon receipt. Additionally, may importers of British albums into the U.S., such as GEM, would seal the records prior to distribution.\n\nSamplers\n\nThe Age of Enlightenment\n\nChrysalis Records 2-LP\n\nTitle: The Age of Enlightenment\n\nRecord Label: Chrysalis Records\n\nCatalog Number: 7243 8 32263 1 3\n\nBar Code: 7 24383 22631 3\n\nMatrix Information: (side 1 / side 2 / side 3 / side 4)\n\n1) CHR 6097 A-1-1-1 SORRY MAN......I DON'T SMOKE STRAIGHTS / CHR 6097 B-1-1-1 MAN, CAN YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF ONE HAND CLAPPPING? / CHR 6097 C-1-1-1 DON'T BRING ME DOWN MAN I ONLY JUST GOT MY VIBE TOGETHER/ CHR 6097 D-1-1-1 ......TELL IT LIKE IT IS, MAN......
