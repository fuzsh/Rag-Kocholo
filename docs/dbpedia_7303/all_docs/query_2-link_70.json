        "text": "Kuckuck with the Edelweiss Novelty Quartet. 70036-B Paramount label no. 1664. Produced by The New York Recording Laboratories, Port Washington, Wisconsin. List price when new was seventy-five cents.\n\nParamount Records was founded in the 1910s as a subsidiary of the Wisconsin Chair Company of Port Washington, Wisconsin. The chair company had made some wooden phonograph cabinets by contract for Edison Records. Wisconsin Chair decided to start making its own line of phonographs with a subsidiary called the \"United Phonograph Corporation\" at the end of 1915. It made phonographs under the \"Vista\" brand name through the end of the decade; the line failed commercially.\n\nIn 1918 a line of phonograph gramophone records was debuted with the \"Paramount\" label. They were recorded and pressed by Chair Company subsidiary \"The New York Recording Laboratories, Incorporated\", which despite its name was located in the same Wisconsin factory complex as the parent concern (advertisements, however, stated somewhat misleadingly, \"Paramounts are recorded in our own New York laboratory\").\n\nIn its initial years, the Paramount label fared only slightly better than the \"Vista Phonograph\" line. The product had little to distinguish itself. Paramount offered recordings of standard pop-music fare, on records recorded with below-average audio fidelity pressed in below-average quality shellac.\n\nIn the early 1920s, Paramount was still racking up debts for the Chair Company while producing no net profit.\n\nParamount began offering to press records for other companies at low prices.
