He was a Union Army veteran of the American Civil War, served as United States Postmaster General, and later edited of The Washington Post.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nBorn in Cambridge, Ohio on April 28, 1846, Hatton was raised and educated in Cadiz, Ohio and apprenticed to his father, who was a printer and newspaper publisher.\n\nCivil War[]\n\nDuring the American Civil War he enlisted in the 98th Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment. His unit served primarily with the Army of the Cumberland, and Hatton attained the rank of First Lieutenant with the 184th Ohio Infantry before being mustered out at the end of the war.\n\nEarly career[]\n\nAfter the war, Hatton worked in the newspaper business in Mount Pleasant, Iowa and later in Burlington, Iowa. Identifying himself with the Republican Party, primarily the Stalwart faction, he served as Burlington's Postmaster, and held several party positions, including Chairman of the Iowa Republican Party's Central Committee.\n\nPolitical career[]\n\nIn 1881 he was appointed Assistant Postmaster General in the James A. Garfield administration. He continued in office during Chester A. Arthur's presidency.\n\nIn 1884 he was promoted to Postmaster General when incumbent Walter Q. Gresham became Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nHatton worked unsuccessfully to nominate President Arthur for a full term at the 1884 Republican National Convention and returned to the newspaper business after the end of his term as Postmaster General in 1885.\n\nLater career[]\n\nHatton was part-owner and editor of The Washington Post until late April 1894, when he was stricken with a massive stroke while working at his desk.\n\nDeath and burial[]\n\nHe died on April 30, 1894, a week after his stroke and two days after his 48th birthday.[1] He was interred in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C.[2]\n\nLegacy[]\n\nThe town of Hatton, North Dakota was founded in 1882, and is named for Frank Hatton.[3]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nFrank Hatton at American President: A Reference Resource; Frank Hatton, by The Miller Center\n\nFrank Hatton at Appleton's Cyclopædia of American Biography, Volume 3\n\nNorth Dakota: A Guide to the Northern Prairie State, by Federal Writers' Project"
