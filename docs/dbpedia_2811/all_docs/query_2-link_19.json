        "text": "Portraits of Named Civil War Enlisted Men\n\nIntroduction | Confederate Army | Union Army\n\nIntroduction\n\nScope of the List\n\nThis is a list of all the photographs found in the Prints and Photographs Division's \"Civil War Negatives and Related Prints\" and Feinberg-Whitman collections that depict named Civil War soldiers with the rank of private, corporal, or sergeant.\n\nAt the time of the centennial of the Civil War, the Prints & Photographs Division held very few original photographs of soldiers from these ranks and, therefore, the Library of Congress made an effort to copy photographs in private hands and in a few public institutions. The list includes the images from private collections (generally distinguishable by the designation \"copy photograph\" in the entry) but not those copied from public institutions.\n\nThe Division has portraits of unidentified soldiers, portraits for which the sitter’s rank is not known, as well as many portraits of officers of both high and low rank. Such images are not included in this list, but many can be found by searching the Prints & Photographs Online Catalog, especially the Civil War Negatives and Related Prints and Brady-Handy collections.\n\nSince the compilation of this list, the Library of Congress has acquired additional collections that include enlisted men from the Civil War, especially the Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs and the Gladstone Collection of African American Photographs. Researchers should consult those online collections for additional images on this subject.\n\nRelated Resources\n\nPhotographs of named and unnamed enslited men during the Civil War can also be found in other Prints and Photographs Division collections, particularly the Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs and the Gladstone Collection of African American Photographs.\n\nFor references to other institutions that hold portraits of enlisted men, including the U.S. Army Military History Institute and the Museum of the Confederacy, see the Civil War “Related Resources” page.\n\nRights and Restrictions\n\nThere are no known restrictions on the publication and distribution of most of these photographs. However, some are copies of photographs that the Library of Congress borrowed during the 1950s and early 1960s. (Images with the designation \"copy photograph\" after the reproduction number may fall into this category. Select the linked reproduction number to display the associated catalog record. Catalog records for these images contain a note beginning \"Copy photo made by LC...\".) After copying, the original photographs were returned to their owners but the Library did not retain a record of their names and addresses. In recent years, some owners have contacted the Library and the catalog records for these photographs cite the owner of the original photograph and state any restrictions that they placed on its use. The Library is not aware of any restrictions on the other images, but is anxious to hear from individuals or institutions that own the original photographs or who know of their history.\n\nEnlisted Men of the Confederate Army\n\n*Select the thumbnail image to view larger versions or the linked reproduction number to view fuller information (if available) through the Prints & Photographs Online Catalog.\n\nAltman, Sampson, Jr., Pvt. 29th Georgia volunteers, Co.
