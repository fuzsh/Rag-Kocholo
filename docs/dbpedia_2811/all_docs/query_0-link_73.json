I give special thanks to author and historian, Shelby Harriel, who has extensively researched these women and dissected their stories to unravel the intertwined biographies of their lives.\n\n==============================\n\nBio ~ compiled by B. Bradford. updated 4-5-2024\n\nFrances Elizabeth Quinn was the daughter of Thomas Quinn Sr. and unknown mother and immigrated with her parents when she was 3 years old from Ireland to La Moille, Illinois where her parents settled. She had a younger brother, Thomas H. Quinn (b. 1848 -d. 1898), who was born in Illinois. They were young when their mother died and their father, Thomas, evidently was inept to care for the young children and left them in the care of his brother Peter, according to Bureau Co., Illinois court records. In the 1850 Lamoille Twp., Bureau Co., IL, Census, HH # 469, \"Elizabeth\" age 4 (b. 1846), born in \"Ireland\" was living with George and Almira Shaw family. Her brother \"Thomas age 2\" born in \"Illinois,\" was living in HH#181 with the Timothy Cokeley family who were also from Ireland. A few doors down was Uncle Peter Quinn, age 42, born in Ireland, single and briefly took care of Frances and her brother before they moved in with their foster homes. When she was 16, her younger brother joined the 52nd Illinois Infantry Regiment. He was only 14. Frances also joined the military and disguised herself as a man in order to serve. See below articles on her military service.\n\nDuring the Civil War she used aliases Frances Hook and Frank Miller while serving in Co. G, 90th Illinois Infantry Regiment. In late 1863, she was searching for provisions near Florence, AL when she\n\nwas captured by the Confederates. While attempting to escape, she was shot in the leg and sustained a severe flesh injury to her thigh requiring extended hospitalization due to infection and gangrene. \"She was wounded in the thigh. No bones were broken; but it was a deep, ugly flesh wound, as if torn by a fragment of shell.\" (Under the Guns, Wittenmyer, p. 17) Frances was released in June 1864 after six months inpatient care.\n\nMarriages: When Frances joined Co. G, 90th Illinois Regiment in 1862, Col. Timothy O'Meara allowed her to accompany her husband who served in the unit. Captain Bloomfield stated her husband was \"Jere O'Kane\" who was Jerry Kane. Mr. Cabbrick stated, \"she married an excellent young man, a member of her mess and remained with the regiment ever since.\" While she was in the hospital for a leg wound, Pvt James Madison Jones who was attending medic stated she was serving with a lover. Before Frances and Jeremiah served in Co. G, 90th Illinois Infantry, they both served in the Home Guard Unit of 67th Illinois, organized as a garrison force at Camp Douglas, Chicago. He was in Co. I as a Teamster and \"single\". It is highly probable they met there and married sometime before June 1862. Although no marriage record was found, I have linked Jeremiah Kane's Find-A-Grave memorial to hers. He was killed in action in Georgia and buried in Georgia. It appears he may have married again in 1863.\n\nAfter the war, she was noted as \"Frances E. Steward\" in the marriage record when she married Matthew Angel on August 12, 1866, in Gallia, OH. I could not find a prior marriage record for Frances to explain why she used the alias Frances Steward. Per the 1870 Gallia, OH Census, HH #128, she was noted as Frances Angel age 26, b. Illinois, wife of Mathew and 2 daughters: \"Rosa age 3\" (b. 1867), \"Louisa\" age 5/12 birth month \"Dec\" (b. 1870). Frances and Matthew had a 3rd child named \"Maggie Angel\" b. May 21, 1872 in Gallipolis, Gallia ,OH per the Gallia Co. Ohio birth records. The parents noted were \"Matthew Angel and Fannie Steward.\" Two months after giving birth, Frances developed health complications and died from \"Dropsy\" (endma). She was buried near her home in Thivener, Clay Twp., Gallia Co., OH at the time. Her widower husband, Matthew was left with 3 young daughters to care for and remarried to widow Rachel H. Trotter on December 3, 1873. Through this marriage it expanded the family as she had children of her own through her first marriage. In the 1880 Gallia Ohio Census, the following people are listed in the HH#71: Matthew Angel age 39, Rachel age 35, Mary age 9 (dau), Maggie age 8 (dau), Rosa age 5 (dau), Malcomb age 1 1/2 (son), Ella Trotter age 16 (step dau), Emma Trotter age 13 (step dau), Jennie Trotter age 8 (step dau). The reason I mention the 1880 census, there is confusion on the daughter's names as Rosa was much older in the 1870 census.\n\nMatthew Angel and Frances E. Quinn had 3 daughters:\n\n1) Laura - b. 12 December 1868, Gallia Co., OH\n\n2) Mary Louise - b. 1870, Gallia Co., OH\n\n3) Margaret \"Maggie\" - b. May 21, 1872, Gallipolis, Gallia ,OH - md B. P. Dixon of Huntington, OH.\n\nFrances' brother, Pvt Thomas H. Quinn, died 20 July 1898, and is buried at Saint Michael's Cemetery, Norway, Benton County, Iowa.

She had a younger brother and when in their teens, both parents died. Her brother enlisted in the Civil War and Frances also enlisted, in the Fifteenth Indiana, using the name B.F. or Frank Miller. She was wounded in the Battle of Chickamauga on September 20, 1863. She was taken to the Confederate Prison at Atlanta, Georgia where she was confined until February 17, 1864. Her identity had been discovered and was she was exchanged with 27 other prisoners. She was taken to a Nashville hospital. At the end of the war she went to Harmar, Ohio where she met Matthew Angel, another soldier. They were married in Gallia County and had two daughters Mary and Maggie. Matthew is buried in Bethel Cemetery in Ohio Township. She is reportedly buried in a private cemetery near their home. Her last child was born in 1872 and she had died by December, 1873 as Matthew remarried at that time.\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------/\n\nWoman Was Soldier in Union Army ~ The Gallipolis Bulletin ~ May 26, 1916\n\n\"In a little private cemetery near the village of Thivener, a few miles from Gallipolis, Ohio, there sleeps one whose name, instead of being chiseled on an impervious marble slab bearing the simple dates of her birth and demise, should be written boldly and indelibly with those of the patriots and heroes of history.\n\nThe great Civil War between the states, now almost half a century past the full history of whose stirring incidents and deeds of patriotism near has nor never will be fully written, was, as are all other wars, the source of untold deeds of valor, which even after the lapse of 50 years will continue to be revealed so long as there remains alive a single one of the participants in that memorable struggle. Among all these stories of thrilling days none has been produced that would breathe the spirit of patriotism and present greater real stirring romances than a history of Frances Quinn.\n\nAway back about 1844, in the little town of LeMoyne, Ill., Frances Elizabeth Quinn was born of humble but eminently respectable parentage, whose home two years later was again blessed with a son. These children grew up into their teens around the home fireside, when both parents died and the children were left under the care of their nearest relative.\n\nEnlisted in Indiana: The son having reached his seventeenth year, drifted away from his boyhood home, and the Civil War opening he enlisted in the Federal army. Soon afterward Frances, being fired by the spirit of patriotism and by the enlistment of her only brother determined also to volunteer, and secretly donning male attire and going over into Indiana, where a regiment was being organized, offered her services under the name of B.F. Miller or Frank Miller, as she became known among her comrades.\n\nHer regiment was the Fifteenth Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and in 1863 was before the close of the war assigned to the Fifteenth Army Corps, commanded by the General W.T. Sherman, many of whose troops were in the engagements at Murfreesboro, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain, among which was Frank Miller's regiment, the Fifteenth Indiana.\n\nUp to 1863 Frank Miller had succeeded in preventing the discovery of her sex. Though not unusually large or strong for one of her sex and age she had endured the privations and hardships of many long marches, and had done her part on the picket post and the routine duties of the camp until September 20, 1863. It was then that the historic battle of Chickamauga was fought and it was there that the Illinois heroine received a severe wound in one of her limbs which resulted by her being captured by the enemy.\n\nTaken to Prison: Though the wound was severe and by various complications threatened her life, she was conveyed to the confederate Prison at Atlanta, Ga., where she was confined until February 17, 1864, when her identity having been discovered she was enrolled among the 27 other prisoners for exchange. Her condition when exchanged was very pitiable. The wound in her leg was caused by a minnie ball, and while in the prison gangrene set in and nearly the entire calf of the leg was destroyed. When carried from the ambulance the true martial spirit she had displayed all during her term of army service was undimmed, and her first words on entering the Union lines were: \"Hurrah for God's country!\"\n\nAfter Frank Miller's exchange she was sent to a hospital at Nashville, Tenn., where she measurably recovered and went from there to Pennsylvania, where she remained until the close of the war, after which she went to Harmar, Ohio. While at Harmar she became acquainted with Matthew Angel, who had served in the Union Army in a company of the Ninety-first Ohio Heavy Artillery, under command of Captain Edward Aleshire, of Gallipolis.\n\nAngel and Miss Quinn, alias Frank Miller, were married at Northup, Ohio, near the former home of the Angels, where they both died, having been blessed with two daughters whom they named Mary and Maggie respectively. Maggie, the younger, is the wife of B.P. Dixon, a well-known railroad man of Huntington, and Mary is the wife of a prosperous ranch owner in Minnesota.\n\nWhile Mrs. Angel's enlistment in the army was a most extraordinary occurrence, any one old enough to remember the thrilling time of 1861-62 can well recall how the young Northern heart beat with patriotism when Ft. Sumter was fired upon and the inflammatory speeches which were heard on every hand, both North and South. Mrs. Angel's only brother had volunteered and she, without father or mother to advise her, was seized by the same spirit which had actuated her brother, and she resolved to enlist. Soon after her enlistment she received a letter from her brother highly reprimanding her for the act and even threatening not to recognize her as a sister.\n\nAnswers Brother's Letter: A reply to this, a copy of which is now in the hands of her Huntington daughter, was a stinging rebuke to her brother and sets forth her motive for enlistment. In it she says:\n\n\"My Dear Brother: I wish to say that in reply to your recent letter that I volunteered in the Army because I wished to have a part in the defense of my country's flag. I think I love my country as well as you do, and by sufficient drilling I think I may learn to shoot just as straight as you can and if my health continues good I may be of equal service as that of yourself.\"\n\nTouching the history of the case there can be no doubt but what her motive for enlistment was that of patriotism and though the most rigid examination of her war record has been made not the slightest tinge has been discovered connected with her moral character, and no family were more respected than they who resided on a nice little farm not far from Thivener, Ohio.\n\nThe pages of fiction can picture no more interesting case than this--the demonstration of a young woman's patriotism, which was so intense that she would endure the hardships of the soldier, suffer to be painfully wounded, be incarcerated in a prison for four months, all because she loved her country and its flag\"\n\n-------------------------------------/\n\nNASHVILLE DISPATCH, March 23, 1864, p. 1, c. 7\n\nA GALLANT FEMALE SOLDIER~~~Romantic History. From the Washington Republican, March 17, 1864\n\nDoctor Mary E. Walker, who is well known to many of our citizens, writes us from Chattanooga an account of a singular case of female martial spirit and patriotic devotion to the flag. Frances Hook's parents died when she was only three years old, and left her, with a brother, in Chicago, Illinois. Soon after the war commenced she and her brother enlisted in the 65th \"Home Guards,\" Frances assuming the name of \"Frank Miller.\" She served three months and was mustered out, without the slightest suspicion of her sex having arisen. She then enlisted in the 90th Illinois, and was taken prisoner in a battle near Chattanooga. She attempted to escape and was shot through the calf of one of her limbs, while said limbs were doing their duty in the attempt. The Rebels searched her person for papers and discovered her sex. The rascals respected her as a woman and gave her a separate room while in prison at Atlanta, Georgia. During her captivity she received a letter from Jeff. Davis offering her a lieutenant's commission if she would enlist in their army. She has no home and no relatives, but she said she preferred to fight as a private soldier for the stars and stripes rather than be honored with a commission from the Rebs. About two weeks ago she was exchanged. The insurgents tried to extort from her a promise that she would go home and not enter the service again. \"Go home!\" she said; \"my only brother was killed at Pittsburg Landing, and I have no home--no friends!\" Doctor Walker describes Frank as of about medium height, with dark hazel eyes, dark brown hair, rounded features, and feminine voice and appearance. Doctor W. is well versed in human nature, as well as anatomy, and she believes that justice to the young woman in question requires that she should be commissioned a lieutenant in the army. The Doctor also argues that Congress should assign women to duty in the army, averring that patriotism has no sex. Whether the president will commission Miss Hook as a lieutenant, or Congress will draft Mrs. Walker's countrywomen into the service we know not, but we are certain that the \"Doctor\" is thoroughly in earnest, and the story of her new protege is an interesting one.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------/\n\nSuggested Additional Reading:\n\n\"Courageous Women of the Civil War: Soldiers, Spies, Medics, and More\" By M.

Sumter was fired upon and the inflammatory speeches which were heard on every hand, both North and South. Mrs. Angel's only brother had volunteered and she, without father or mother to advise her, was seized by the same spirit which had actuated her brother, and she resolved to enlist. Soon after her enlistment she received a letter from her brother highly reprimanding her for the act and even threatening not to recognize her as a sister.\n\nAnswers Brother's Letter: A reply to this, a copy of which is now in the hands of her Huntington daughter, was a stinging rebuke to her brother and sets forth her motive for enlistment. In it she says:\n\n\"My Dear Brother: I wish to say that in reply to your recent letter that I volunteered in the Army because I wished to have a part in the defense of my country's flag. I think I love my country as well as you do, and by sufficient drilling I think I may learn to shoot just as straight as you can and if my health continues good I may be of equal service as that of yourself.\"\n\nTouching the history of the case there can be no doubt but what her motive for enlistment was that of patriotism and though the most rigid examination of her war record has been made not the slightest tinge has been discovered connected with her moral character, and no family were more respected than they who resided on a nice little farm not far from Thivener, Ohio.\n\nThe pages of fiction can picture no more interesting case than this--the demonstration of a young woman's patriotism, which was so intense that she would endure the hardships of the soldier, suffer to be painfully wounded, be incarcerated in a prison for four months, all because she loved her country and its flag\"\n\n-------------------------------------/\n\nNASHVILLE DISPATCH, March 23, 1864, p. 1, c. 7\n\nA GALLANT FEMALE SOLDIER~~~Romantic History. From the Washington Republican, March 17, 1864\n\nDoctor Mary E. Walker, who is well known to many of our citizens, writes us from Chattanooga an account of a singular case of female martial spirit and patriotic devotion to the flag. Frances Hook's parents died when she was only three years old, and left her, with a brother, in Chicago, Illinois. Soon after the war commenced she and her brother enlisted in the 65th \"Home Guards,\" Frances assuming the name of \"Frank Miller.\" She served three months and was mustered out, without the slightest suspicion of her sex having arisen. She then enlisted in the 90th Illinois, and was taken prisoner in a battle near Chattanooga. She attempted to escape and was shot through the calf of one of her limbs, while said limbs were doing their duty in the attempt. The Rebels searched her person for papers and discovered her sex. The rascals respected her as a woman and gave her a separate room while in prison at Atlanta, Georgia. During her captivity she received a letter from Jeff. Davis offering her a lieutenant's commission if she would enlist in their army. She has no home and no relatives, but she said she preferred to fight as a private soldier for the stars and stripes rather than be honored with a commission from the Rebs. About two weeks ago she was exchanged. The insurgents tried to extort from her a promise that she would go home and not enter the service again. \"Go home!\" she said; \"my only brother was killed at Pittsburg Landing, and I have no home--no friends!\" Doctor Walker describes Frank as of about medium height, with dark hazel eyes, dark brown hair, rounded features, and feminine voice and appearance. Doctor W. is well versed in human nature, as well as anatomy, and she believes that justice to the young woman in question requires that she should be commissioned a lieutenant in the army. The Doctor also argues that Congress should assign women to duty in the army, averring that patriotism has no sex. Whether the president will commission Miss Hook as a lieutenant, or Congress will draft Mrs. Walker's countrywomen into the service we know not, but we are certain that the \"Doctor\" is thoroughly in earnest, and the story of her new protege is an interesting one.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------/\n\nSuggested Additional Reading:\n\n\"Courageous Women of the Civil War: Soldiers, Spies, Medics, and More\" By M.
