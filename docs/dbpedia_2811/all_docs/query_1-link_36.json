        "text": "JOHN A. ALBRIGHT LETTERS. 1864-1865. 4 letters. From February 1864 to July 1865, John A. Albright (b. 1843/4) served in the Union army as a private in Company K, 16th Wisconsin Infantry. Albright, a native of Pennsylvania, resided in Eagle Township, Waukesha County, Wisconsin when he enlisted. The letters date from 23 October 1864 to 8 May 1865, during which time the regiment was attached to Maj. Gen. Frank P. Blair's XVII Corps (1st Brigade, 3rd Division), of the Army of the Tennessee. The earliest of the letters was written from an army hospital in Atlanta, where Albright was recovering from a wound suffered the previous July. The later three were written from the field in Georgia, the Carolinas, and Virginia, after Albright had returned to the regiment. MSN/CW 5016-1 to MSN/CW 5016-4.\n\nANDERSON-REAVIS CORRESPONDENCE. 1857-1865 (bulk 1862-1863). 13 letters and notes; 2 drawings, 1 clipping, 1 printed obituary. A group consisting primarily of nine letters and three unrelated postscripts written from 1861 to 1863 by Dr. Leroy H. Anderson (1814-1863) of Gainesville, Sumter County, Alabama, to his close friend and sometime patient, Mary S. Reavis, also of Gainesville. Mary Reavis was the second wife of Turner Reavis, a prominent local lawyer who served in the Alabama state senate during the war. Two of the letters were written from Richmond, where Anderson travelled early in the war to serve the Confederacy in a medical capacity. The rest were written in 1862-63 from Aiken, South Carolina; Anderson's health was delicate, and Aiken's climate was reputedly salubrious. Anderson speaks of the progress of the Confederate cause and of the management, in absentia, of his property in Alabama, including his slaves. The group also includes an 1857 letter of Turner Reavis. MSN/CW 5004-1 to MSN/CW 5004-16. [Introduction, Images & Transcriptions]\n\nBENJAMIN H. ANTHONY LETTER. 1862. 1 letter (3 pp.). A letter written by Pvt. Benjamin H. Anthony during his service with Co. I, 2nd Virginia Cavalry (CSA). Anthony (1836-1910) was a native of Campbell County, Virginia. At the time the letter was written (26 May 1862) the regiment was attached to Ewell's Division in Jackson's Valley District, Department of Northern Virginia. Anthony relates his experiences at the battle of Winchester, Virginia (25 May 1862), fought during Jackson's Valley Campaign. Acquisition funded by Robert and Beverly O'Grady, 2006. MSN/CW 5046-1.\n\nFRANCIS AUBIN LETTERS. 1862-1863. 38 letters, most with envelopes. Francis Aubin (b. c1817) was a Canadian immigrant who served as a private in Company D of the 146th New York Infantry (\"Garrard's Tigers,\" a Zouave regiment) in 1862-63. In September 1863 Aubin was transferred into Company F of the 14th Veteran Reserve Corps. The letters date from 11 September 1862 to 26 December 1863, and were written to Aubin's daughter, Eliza Aubin Dudley, in Saratoga and Washington Counties, New York. Twenty-five of the letters date from Aubin's service with the 146th, then attached to the Army of the Potomac (3rd Brigade, 2nd Division, V Corps). Aubin was a native French speaker but attempted to write in English, of which he had only a rudimentary knowledge. Hence, the content of the letters written in his own hand (eight were written for him by others) is repetitious, and the meaning sometimes obscure. MSN/CW 5006-1 to MSN/CW 5006-38.\n\nALBERT J. BALDWIN LETTERS. 1862-1866. 55 letters, with envelopes. Fifty-two of the items in this group are wartime personal letters written by Albert Jehiel Baldwin (1839-1912), who rose to second lieutenant during three years' service in Battery D, 1st Michigan Light Artillery. All are directed to Baldwin's parents, in Union, Branch County, Michigan. In 1862-63 Baldwin and the battery served in the field with the armies of the Ohio and the Cumberland; in 1864-65 the battery mostly performed garrison duty, at Nashville and Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The letters span the full period of Baldwin's service, but most date from September 1863 to May 1865, his final two years in the army. Among the letters are accounts of Baldwin's involvement at Perryville, Chickamauga (where the battery lost its guns), and the siege of Chattanooga. MSN/CW 5089-1 to MSN/CW 5089-56. [Finding Aid]\n\nCICERO R. BARKER LETTER. 1864. 1 letter (4 pp.). Cicero R. Barker (1848-1917) was born in Salisbury, Rowan County, North Carolina. He was not yet 14 when he enlisted in the Confederate army, initially serving as a drummer in Co. K, 8th North Carolina Infantry. By the time this letter was written, on 1 December 1864, he had been promoted to regimental drum major. The letter is addressed to Barker's mother, and was written from the Confederate defenses southeast of Richmond. Barker describes the execution of a deserter, and inquires about escaped Union prisoners near the family home in Salisbury. Acquisition funded by Robert and Beverly O'Grady, 2006. MSN/CW 5040-1. [Introduction, Images & Transcriptions]\n\nBARRIER FAMILY LETTERS. 1861-1868 (bulk 1861-1865). 123 letters, many with envelopes. This collection includes 115 letters written during the Civil War by two brothers serving in the Confederate army. William Lafayette Barrier (1834-1864) served as private and sergeant in Co. F, 1st North Carolina Cavalry. Rufus Alexander Barrier (1836-1876) was captain of Co. H, 8th North Carolina Infantry from 1861 to 1864; he thereafter served on regimental Field and Staff and, as lieutenant colonel, commanded the 8th North Carolina from June 1864 to war's end. The letters are mostly directed to the brothers' father, Mathias Barrier, in Mt. Pleasant, Cabarrus County, North Carolina. Each brother's letters cover close to the full period of his military service, and so provide a relatively seamless account of his years in the field. The eight remaining letters were written by as many different correspondents, and are addressed to either Rufus or Mathias. Gift of Beverly Troxler O'Grady and Robert O'Grady, 2007. MSN/CW 5057-1 to MSN/CW 5057-123. [Finding Aid]\n\nBENTON-BEACH FAMILY CORRESPONDENCE. 1862-1865. 224 letters, some with envelopes; 1 CDV portrait, ephemera. Oliver Charles Benton (1836-1907) and his wife Cora Beach Benton (1838-1902) were residents of Albion, Orleans County, New York. From 1862 to 1865 Benton served as private and sergeant in the 17th Independent Battery, New York Light Artillery. Forty of the letters in the correspondence were written by Charlie Benton to Cora; many of these date from the final year of the war, when the battery saw sustained action with the Army of the James in Virginia. One hundred sixty-nine letters were written by Cora to Charlie; these span virtually the full period of Charlie's service, running from 10 September 1862 to 4 June 1865. Cora Benton's letters mention some two hundred people by name, and provide a great deal of commentary on Albion and its residents during the Civil War. Also included in the correspondence are fifteen wartime letters from other members of the Benton and Beach families to Cora or Charlie. MSN/CW 5022-1 to MSN/CW 5022-224.\n\nMARY BETTLE LETTERS. 1862. 2 letters. A pair of letters, each dated 4 October 1862, written to the Quaker Mary Bettle (1833-1912) by two female relatives, Sophia Jones and Elizabeth Williams. Mary Bettle was the daughter of Samuel Bettle, Jr. (1809-1880), a prominent Philadelphia merchant; both Bettle and his daughter were ministering Friends. The letters, written from Philadelphia as the Bettle family was touring Europe, discuss the progress of the war from a Quaker perspective, with some mention of Antietam and the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. Of additional interest is a four-page enclosure included by Jones with her letter. This is a copy, in Jones's hand, of an account written by an anonymous member of a deputation from the Ohio Yearly Meeting of Friends (Orthodox), describing audiences with Salmon P. Chase, Edwin M. Stanton, and Lincoln. The deputation's purpose in seeking the audiences was to gain exemption from the draft. MSN/CW 5029-1 to MSN/CW 5029-2. [Introduction, Images & Transcriptions]\n\nTHOMAS B. BOOTH LETTERS. 1862. 3 letters, with envelopes. A group of three letters written from 2 February to 5 March 1862 by Thomas Boisseau Booth (1840-1923), as a member of Co. I, 3rd Virginia Cavalry. The letters were written from the vicinity of Yorktown, and were directed to Booth's sweetheart, Agnes Lyon, at Petersburg. The content is primarily sentimental, allaying Agnes's fears for Booth's health and well-being. Acquisition funded by Robert and Beverly O'Grady, 2010. MSN/CW 5090-1 to MSN/CW 5090-3.\n\nSERENO BRIDGE LETTER. 1863. 1 letter (4 pp.). Sereno Bridge, a resident of Elgin, Kane County, Illinois, was serving as a private in Company G, 15th Illinois Cavalry when he wrote the accompanying letter to his wife (20 November 1863). The company was then stationed at Helena, Arkansas, its base for scouts into Arkansas and Mississippi. The letter describes one such scout, emphasizing the unequal treatment by the regiment's colonel of two local landowners. MSN/CW 5005-1.\n\nBRAXTON BRAGG LETTER. 1864. 1 letter (1 page), with docketing. An official copy of a letter of 1 August 1864 written from Columbus, Georgia by CS Gen. Braxton Bragg, directed to Maj. Gen. D. H. Maury. Bragg was then serving as military adviser to Jefferson Davis; he was in Georgia to apprise the president of circumstances in the Army of Tennessee. The letter concerns the disposition of Brig. Gen. Philip Roddey's Cavalry Brigade. Acquisition funded by Robert and Beverly O'Grady, 2011. MSN/CW 5106-1.\n\nFRANCIS L. BROWN LETTERS. 1861-1930. 38 letters, some with envelopes; 2 documents; 1 photograph; clippings. Francis Leicester Brown (1841-1915) was a native of Wayne County, New York whose service in the Federal army included time with the 33rd New York Infantry (1861-1863) and the 24th New York Cavalry (1864-1865; captain of Co. L from January 1864). Twenty-five of the letters in the collection were written by Brown during the war, mostly to his younger sister Viette at the family home in Shortsville, Ontario County. Eighteen of these date from Brown's time with the 33rd (including letters written from the battlefields of Antietam and Fredericksburg, 19 September and 15 December 1862). Seven date from his time with the 24th Cavalry (including one written from Spotsylvania, 20 May 1864). The collection also includes 13 letters to Brown regarding his army pension, which became a subject of legal dispute. MSN/CW 5100-1 to MSN/CW 5100-43.\n\nJAMES M. BROWN LETTERS. 1862. 2 letters A pair of letters written on 27 June and 4 July 1862 from Gardner Hospital in Richmond, by Confederate private James M. Brown of Co. E, 9th Virginia Cavalry. Suffering from \"palpitations of the heart\" and awaiting discharge, Brown writes of the Seven Days' battles near Richmond and of hospital life generally. Acquisition funded by Robert and Beverly O'Grady, 2012. MSN/CW 5095-1.\n\nBOYCE FAMILY LETTERS. 1864-1871 (bulk 1864). 7 letters. Six of the letters in this group were written by Pvt. Ambrose A. Boyce (ca. 1846-1864) of Franklin, Delaware County, New York, during his Civil War service in Co. I, 3rd New York Cavalry. Boyce enlisted in February 1864 and was captured at Mattox Station, Virginia the following May; he died at Andersonville prison on 25 September. The letters were written to Boyce's family between 3 March and 8 April 1864, from camps in New York, Virginia, and North Carolina. Several of the letters contain passages ridiculing U. S. Colored Troops training at Fortress Monroe, Virginia. MSN/CW 5082-1 to MSN/CW 5082-7.\n\nJULIUS B. BUFORD LETTERS. 1863. 2 letters. Julius Blackburn Buford (1832-1919) was the son of Paschal and Mary Ann Otey Buford, of Locust Level Plantation near present-day Montvale, Bedford County, Virginia. He served in Co. A, 2nd Virginia Cavalry Regiment (CS) for much of the war; in 1865 he was promoted captain. The two letters here preserved were written by Buford to his sister and mother in the spring of 1863 (5 April and 25 May), from Albemarle County, when the regiment was attached to Fitz. Lee's Brigade of the Cavalry Division of the Army of Northern Virginia. The content of the letters is mostly personal, with some military and political commentary. MSN/CW 5077-1 to MSN/CW 5077-2.\n\nCALEY FAMILY CORRESPONDENCE. 1862-1892 (bulk 1862-65). 33 letters; 1 additional manuscript; 1 printed item. Twenty-nine of the letters in this collection were written by Private Charles C. Caley (1839-1901), who served in Company F of the 105th Ohio Infantry from 1862 to 1865. All are addressed to his wife, Juliaette Carpenter Caley, in Mentor, Ohio. Charles Caley was a farm worker, born in Madison, Lake County, Ohio. The four earliest letters in the group were written in 1862 from Kentucky and Indiana (where Caley was hospitalized after being wounded at Perryville). Nine letters were written from Murfreesboro, Tennessee (March to June 1863) and eight from Chattanooga (September 1863 to February 1864). During his service at Chattanooga Caley saw special duty with Battery I of the 4th U.S. Artillery. He returned to the 105th Ohio for the drive on Atlanta (two letters, June to July, 1864) and for subsequent operations in Georgia and the Carolinas (six letters, October 1864 to April 1865). The group also includes four letters written by other members of the Caley family, 1863 to 1867. MSN/CW 5024-1 to MSN/CW 5024-36. [Introduction, Images & Transcriptions]\n\nEDWARD R. S.

H, 11th Mississippi Cavalry (Perrin's). Cox (b. c1820) owned a substantial plantation in Lowndes County, Mississippi. The 11th Mississippi (Ferguson's Brigade, Jackson's Division, Army of Tennessee) had served throughout the Atlanta campaign and was now south of the Chattahoochee River, some seven miles from the city. Writing to his wife, Cox provides a cursory overview of the military situation, gives word of his own condition, and inquires after matters at home.

E, 15th Illinois Infantry (2nd Brigade, 4th (Hurlbut's) Division, District and Army of West Tennessee). The company, recruited in Jo Daviess County, fared badly in the Confederate onslaught of 6 April; among the wounded was Crowell's brother, Cpl. Rufus B. Tucker, now back in Nora.

In this campaign Terry's Rangers were attached to a cavalry brigade commanded (initially) by Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, and (subsequently) by Col. John A. Wharton, in Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee. The letter emphasizes the fighting done by the regiment, referencing at least eight engagements with the Federals, including Woodsonville, Taylorsville, Bardstown, and the battle of Perryville. Of particular interest is Harvey's account of a skirmish on the Tennessee-Kentucky border early in the campaign, in which a Federal soldier captured during the affair is discovered by the Confederates to be a woman.

Hiram Alonzo Hawkins (1827-1895) was a Vermont native who in 1851 moved west to Illinois, ultimately settling at Virden, Macoupin County, where he farmed and worked as a carpenter. In September 1861 he enlisted in the Union army; the following November he was mustered in a sergeant to Co. D, 9th Illinois Cavalry. Hawkins served in the field until the regiment veteranized, in March 1864; he declined to reenlist, and spent the balance of his three-year term of service on detached duty at Fort Pickering near Memphis. The collection consists of 35 letters written by Hawkins to his wife and parents in Illinois. Five date from early in the war (28 November 1861 to 23 March 1862, from Camp Douglas in Chicago and from Missouri). Another twelve were written while Hawkins was campaigning with the regiment in southwest Tennessee, 4 September 1863 to 7 March 1864. The final seventeen (13-14 March to 26 August 1864) date from Hawkins' period of detached duty at Memphis. Several of these late letters make it plain that Hawkins' authority as a non-commissioned officer was compromised by his status as a \"non-veteran;\" i. e., by his failure to reenlist.

In mid-May the regiment joined the Army of the Potomac in Virginia, to serve as infantry in the Overland campaign. On 23 June Hines was captured outside Petersburg, and had the misfortune to be sent to the Confederate prisoner of war camp at Andersonville, Georgia; he died in the camp hospital on 13 October 1864. All Hines's letters are addressed to his brother, Joseph Hines (b. 1835/6), a pharmaceuticals salesman in Pennsylvania. Mostly, they describe the routine of life in the Washington fortifications, where tedium and disease were the men's chief antagonists.

H, 30th North Carolina Infantry from 1861 until his death in 1864. Nineteen of the letters in the group predate the Civil War; many of these were written to Archibald Jackson by relatives who had settled outside Moore County. Of the forty wartime letters in the collection, eleven were written by Archibald Jackson during his time in the army; ten more were written by two of Jackson's brothers, Burgess (1839-1864) and Gorry (b. 1845), during their own periods of service (the former in Co. H of the 30th North Carolina, 1862-1864; the latter in Co. I of the 2nd North Carolina Cavalry, 1864-1865). These were mainly directed home to Moore County, most notably to two of the Jacksons' sisters, Dicy Ann (b. 1837) and Effie Jane (b. 1841).

John Hunt Morgan's Cavalry, to Nancy (Nannie) Lyne (b. 1844) of Woodford County, Kentucky. Lyne was the unmarried daughter of the planter William Lyne; she appears to have corresponded with a number of Morgan's troopers held as prisoners in the North. Two of the letters were written by Van Buren J. Sellers (b. 1835/6) of Woodford County, who in October 1861 was elected 3rd lieutenant of the original company organized and commanded by Morgan (the former \"Lexington Rifles\" militia, soon to become Co.

He spent the remainder of the war in prison, first at Pittsburgh, than at Point Lookout, Maryland (from which place the earlier of the two letters was written, on 30 April 1864), and finally at Fort Delaware (the place of origin of the second letter, 12 February 1865). The other letters in the group were written from Camp Douglas in Chicago, in the fall of either 1863 or 1864. One of the authors can be identified as Pvt. William S.

Thus, the letters provide an essentially continuous narrative of the last eleven months of Maley's service, including his involvement in the Atlanta campaign and in subsequent actions against the Confederate Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood in Tennessee (culminating in the battle of Nashville on 15-16 December, where Maley was wounded).

A group of personal letters written by, to, or about James Monroe Meek (b. 1821), an East Tennessee lawyer and legislator jailed by the Confederates for his Unionist sympathies. Meek was born on a farm near Strawberry Plains in Jefferson County, and represented that county in the state legislatures of 1855-57 and 1861-63. He was imprisoned from April to July 1862, ultimately at Macon, Georgia, and arrested again in June 1863. Meek was among the Tennessee Unionists who met at Nashville in January 1865, to initiate the formation of a new government. After the war he prospered, in the legal profession and in business.

Morgan, a native of Lexington, Kentucky, commanded the 14th Kentucky Cavalry (CSA) on the famous Indiana-Ohio Raid led by his brother, Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan (2-26 July 1863). Like the rest of the officers captured on the raid, Dick Morgan was declared a civil prisoner, ineligible for parole; among his companions at Columbus were three of his brothers, including John, and his brother-in-law, Col. Basil Duke. The letter was almost certainly directed to the author's sister-in-law, Martha (\"Mattie\") Ready Morgan (1840-1887), who had married John Hunt Morgan the previous December. It was written in response to what was apparently the first letter of Mattie Morgan's to be received at the prison.

The first (7 January 1862) was written by Nall from winter camp near Yorktown; the second (10 January 1863) was written jointly by Nall and Young from Fredericksburg. The group also includes several post-war letters to Settle in Missouri. MSN/CW 5019-1 to MSN/CW 5019-4.\n\nSHIPMAN FAMILY CORRESPONDENCE. 1861-1864. 18 letters. Thirteen of the 18 letters in this group were sent by Pvt. Jesse Albert Shipman (c1843-1863), Co. G, 1st North Carolina Cavalry (CSA), to his father, Andrew R. Shipman, in Henderson County, North Carolina. Albert Shipman joined the \"Buncombe Rangers,\" as Co. G was originally known, in May 1861; he served with the 1st North Carolina Cavalry from the regiment's mustering in (October 1861) until his death, on 22 July 1863, from a wound suffered at Martinsburg, West Virginia three days earlier. From June 1862 the regiment was attached to the Army of Northern Virginia, after previous service in Virginia and North Carolina. Shipman's letters are more or less evenly dispersed over his period of service: five date from 1861, five from 1862, and three from 1863. Though all bear his name, they are written in four distinct hands, one of which is certainly that of Albert's cousin, Sgt. J. K. P. (\"Polk\") Shipman (1834/5-1864), also of Co. G. Whether one of the remaining hands is Albert's, or if all the letters were written for him, cannot be determined. Also included in the group are five letters written to Andrew Shipman from July 1863, by other members of Co. G: 1st Lt. Thomas L. Matthias (one letter); Pvt. A. P. Corn (one letter); Polk Shipman (two letters); and (probably) Pvt. Elias Hestiler (one letter). These deal mostly with Albert's death, and the settling of his affairs.

The seven manuscript items in this group were written by Andrew Keiser Shriver (4) and Thomas Herbert Shriver (3), sons of William and Mary Owings Shriver of Union Mills, Carroll County, Maryland. Five are personal letters addressed to family members; two are letters or notes directed to the Virginia Military Institute, where Herbert Shriver was enrolled from 1863 to 1865. During the war years William Shriver identified with the Southern cause, and four of his sons served the Confederacy. Herbert Shriver (1846-1916) joined the 1st Virginia Cavalry when the Cavalry Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia stopped at Union Mills on 29-30 June 1863, on its way to Gettysburg (he was initially attached to Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's headquarters, to serve as a guide). Shriver was discharged later that summer and sent to V.M.I., fighting at the battle of New Market in 1864 as a \"New Market cadet.\" For much of the war Andrew Keiser Shriver (1836-1897) worked in Richmond as a purchasing agent in the army's Medical Department. In the most significant of the letters (11 August 1863), Keiser describes tracking down Herbert in the army, effecting his release, and arranging to send him to V.M.I.; included are accounts of meetings with Stuart and Fitzhugh Lee. Several of Thomas's brief or fragmentary letters allude to his (and the family's) Roman Catholicism, including an account of a mass conducted at Staunton, Virginia in the waning days of the war by Rev. Joseph Bixio, S.J. Acquisition funded by Robert and Beverly O'Grady, 2004. MSN/CW 5030-1 to MSN/CW 5030-7. [Introduction, Images & Transcriptions]\n\nSILLERS-HOLMES FAMILY CORRESPONDENCE. 1862-1864. 18 letters. Fourteen of the 18 letters in this correspondence were written by Lt. Col. William W. Sillers, when that officer was serving with the 30th North Carolina Infantry in North Carolina and Virginia. Sillers (1838-1863) owned a plantation near Clinton in Sampson County, North Carolina. He was mustered in a private but rose to lieutenant (August 1861), major (on reorganization, May 1862) and lieutenant colonel (August 1863); at Antietam he served as field officer of the regiment. He was wounded at Kelly's Ford, Virginia on 7 November 1863, and died two days later. Most of Sillers' letters are addressed to his sister, Fannie Sillers Holmes, in Sampson County. All but one were written from Virginia between October 1862 and September 1863; during that time the regiment was attached to the 2nd Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia. Several of the letters discuss particulars of campaigns, including Lee's invasions of Maryland and Pennsylvania. The letters also treat personal and family matters, and contain inquiries and instructions regarding Sillers' property (including his slaves). There are also four additional letters written by or to members of the Holmes household. Among these is a letter by Captain Gary F. Williams of the 30th North Carolina; directed to Fannie Holmes's husband, Dr. Allmond Holmes, it relates the details of William Sillers' death. MSN/CW 5025-1 to MSN/CW 5025-19. [Introduction, Images & Transcriptions]\n\nSNOW FAMILY CORRESPONDENCE. 1862-1864. 17 letters, several with envelopes. A group of 17 letters written by or to John Adams Snow (b. c1843), as a member of Lumsden's Battery (Co. F), 2nd Alabama Light Artillery Battalion. Snow was from a family of means in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. The four letters in the collection written by Snow date from 30 May to 14 July 1864, during which time Lumsden's Battery was in the artillery reserve of the Army of Tennessee; Snow himself was the battery's quartermaster sergeant. All the letters come from the vicinity of Atlanta, where the Confederates were seeking to halt Sherman's push towards the city. Of particular note is the letter of 8 July, from a position along the Chattahoochee River, in which Snow describes casualties recently suffered by the battery. The thirteen remaining letters in the group (February 1862 to November 1863) were written to Snow by his mother, Virginia Penn Snow, or by his sister Elizabeth (b. c1833). MSN/CW 5065-1 to MSN/CW 5065-18.\n\nCHARLES SOPER CORRESPONDENCE. 1862-1863. 28 letters, most with envelopes. Twenty of the letters in this collection were written by Pvt. Charles Soper (1832/3-1863) during his Civil War service in Co. D, 22nd Michigan Infantry. All are addressed to his wife, Sarah, at Soper's farm near Orion in Oakland County, Michigan. Soper was mustered in on 14 August 1862, and remained with the 22nd Michigan until falling sick the following April; he died at Hospital No. 1, Nashville, 22 April 1863. Soper's letters date from 12 November 1862 to 5 April 1863. Most were written from the large Union winter encampment at Lexington, Kentucky, Camp Ella Bishop, where the regimentattached to the Army of Kentuckyperformed guard, picket, and provost duty. The collection also includes six letters written to Sarah Soper by Pvt. George W. Owen (b. 1833/4), also of the 22nd Michigan's Co. D. These describe Soper's illness, death, and burial, as well as Owen's efforts to obtain a tombstone for his friend's grave. MSN/CW 5044-1 to MSN/CW 5044-28.\n\nSARAH STILSON CORRESPONDENCE. 1861-1865. 39 letters, many with envelopes. Sarah Lyra Stilson (1838-1912) was born in Burma, where her father, the Rev. Lyman Stilson, was a Baptist missionary. In 1851 the family returned to the United States, settling in Livingston County, New York; by the time of the Civil War Sarah Stilson was employed as a schoolteacher, first in Livingston County and subsequently at the Corning (NY) Academy. After the war she graduated from Vassar College. The correspondence includes 27 letters written to Stilson and twelve written by her, spread fairly evenly over the war years, from March 1861 to April 1865. The heart of the collection, comprising 27 items, is Stilson's correspondence with her friend Oliver Waldo West (b. 1842), a young newspaper editor (and future lawyer) from North Dansville, Livingston County, whom Stilson had met at a teachers' institute in 1860. In August 1862 West was mustered in to Co. K, 130th New York Infantry; he remained with the regiment, as 1st lieutenant, when it was converted to cavalry and designated the 1st New York Dragoons, in mid-1863. The following October West was detached to serve on the staff of Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasanton, commanding the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac. He was captured on 7 May 1864, at Todd's Tavern, and spent the balance of the war in prison. The letters exchanged by West and Stilson (16 written by West, 11 by Stilson) are long, lively, and highly opinionated. While much of the content is personal news, recounted at length, with frequent touches of humor, the letters are also very much a dialogue, an exchange of ideas and feelings about both contemporary affairs and the broader life of the mind. Also in the collection are three letters to Stilson from Capt. Henry J. Gifford of the 33rd and 49th New York Infantry, and two other soldiers letters. MSN/CW 5061-1 to MSN/CW 5061-41. [Finding Aid]\n\nPETER STOKES LETTER. 1865. 1 letter (2 pages), w/envelope. A letter written on 1 January 1865 by Pvt. Peter Stokes, as a member of Co. D, 8th Alabama Cavalry (Ball's-Hatch's) Regiment, C. G. Armistead's Brigade, CSA. Stokes was a native of Greensboro, Greene County, Alabama. The letter, written from camp near Pollard in Escambia County, Alabama, mentions a recent engagement (at Pine Barren Creek, Florida, 16-17 December 1864) and requests food, clothing, and letters from home. The letter is accompanied by its wallpaper cover. Acquisition funded by Robert and Beverly O'Grady, 2008. MSN/CW 5083-1.\n\nJ.E.B. STUART LETTER. 1862. 1 letter (4 pages). A personal letter written on 22 October 1862 by Confederate Maj. Gen. James Ewell Brown Stuart (1833-1864), as cavalry commander of the Army of Northern Virginia. At the time of the letter Stuart was encamped near \"The Bower\"the A. Stephen Dandridge home near Charles Town in the Virginia Shenandoah, where he and his staff were feted on a near-nightly basis. The addressee can be identified as Ann Overton \"Nannie\" Price (b. 1844/5), a cousin of Stuart's and daughter of Dr. Lucien B. Price, owner of a plantation called \"Dundee\" in Hanover County, Virginia. As the letter suggests, Stuart and his family had spent time at Dundee earlier in 1862, when the general was headquartered in Hanover County. The content of the letter is largely personal. Stuart chooses to address his cousin as a smitten suitor might address the (somewhat wayward) object of his affection; he sustains this gallantry through the better part of the letter. At some point in the document's history, Stuart's closing signature was clipped away as a keepsake. Acquisition funded by Robert and Beverly O'Grady, 2007. MSN/CW 5056-1.\n\nTAYLOR FAMILY CORRESPONDENCE. 1864. 5 letters. The five letters in this group were written from separate Northern prisoner of war camps by the brothers Jonathan Gibson Taylor (1839-1864) and Robert Walker Taylor (1840-1902), of Yelvington, Daviess County, Kentucky. Both were Confederate cavalrymen, who served in Kentucky regiments attached to commands of Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan. Gibson Taylor's three letters of June-August 1864 were written from prisons at Louisville and at Rock Island, Illinois (where he died on 14 October). Robert's two letters were written in October 1864 from the prison at Camp Douglas in Chicago; the second of these mentions Gibson's death. Acquired through the generosity of Robert and Beverly O'Grady, 2005. MSN/CW 5033-1 to MSN/CW 5033-5. [Introduction, Images & Transcriptions]\n\nTHOMAS FAMILY CORRESPONDENCE. 1862-1865 (bulk 1862-1863). 50 letters and 1 note; many with envelopes. Thirty-four of the letters in this group were written by George Thomas (1821-1905) to his wife, Minerva Everton Thomas (1831-1868), during his tenure as regimental quartermaster of the 53rd Indiana Infantry (March 1862 to May 1864). An additional eleven wartime letters were written by Minerva Thomas to her husband. George Thomas owned a farm in Ohio Township, Spencer County, Indiana, near the Ohio River community of Rockport. All but two of the letters date from January 1862 to November 1863. For much of this time the regiment was stationed in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi; it was involved in several key episodes in that theater, most notably the sieges of Corinth and Vicksburg. George Thomas's letters include much on the logistics of troop movement and supply up and down the waterways of the Mississippi Valley. Several of Minerva Thomas's letters to her husband describe Confederate guerilla actions in the vicinity of Rockport. The group includes four additional wartime letters addressed to the Thomases, including one written to Minerva by her nephew, Ezra B. Sherwin, then with the 14th Wisconsin Infantry. MSN/CW 5014-1 to MSN/CW 5014-51. [Introduction, Images & Transcriptions]\n\nHERBERT BENEZET TYSON LETTERS. 1865. 5 letters. Herbert Benezet Tyson was born in 1842 or 1843 in Germantown, Pennsylvania. He was a member of the United States Naval Academy's class of 1862, and served in the Union navy as midshipman and lieutenant from 1861 to 1865. The letters, dated 24 February to 5 May 1865, describe Tyson's service as navigator aboard the U.S.S. Connecticut, on an extended cruise undertaken by that ship to and around the Caribbean. Much of the content is dedicated to descriptions of the Connecticut's ports of call. All the letters were written to Tyson's brother, Carroll S. Tyson, in Norristown, Pennsylvania. MSN/CW 5010-1 to MSN/CW 5010-5. [Introduction, Images & Transcriptions]\n\nVICKERS FAMILY CORRESPONDENCE. 1861-1877 (bulk 1862-1863). 80 letters, many with envelopes; 5 additional manuscripts. Most of the items in this group are personal letters written between members of the Vickers family, of West Chester, Chester County, Pennsylvania, during the Civil War. The figures central to the correspondence are as follows: Joseph Vickers (1811-1864), a potter, and his wife, Elizabeth Painter Vickers (1813-1863); the couple's four children, Jonathan (b. 1838), Joseph P. or J. P. (1840-1914), Eugene (1841-1924), and Lydia Anna (1845-1936); and a cousin of the Vickers children, Lydia Ward. All were Quakers, with Abolitionist sympathies, and some, at least, attended Longwood Meeting House in Chester County, home of the Pennsylvania Yearly Meeting of Progressive Friends. Two of the Vickers sons served in the army, Eugene as a private in Co. C, 97th Pennsylvania Infantry (September 1861 to September 1864), and J. P. as assistant surgeon in the 50th Pennsylvania Infantry (August 1861 to July 1864). The father, Joseph Vickers, had several war-related civilian jobs, in Virginia and at Camp Curtin in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The eldest son, Jonathan, also worked at Camp Curtin. The greater number of the letters are addressed to Eugene Vickers in South Carolina, though he is the author of only three, including one describing the battle of Secessionville, 16 June 1862. J. P. Vickers, the surgeon, is the author of 14 of the letters, written mostly from South Carolina and Virginia. Of the remaining family members, Elizabeth Vickers wrote or contributed to 27 letters, Lydia Ward ten, Jonathan Vickers ten, Joseph Vickers seven, and Anna Vickers four. Most of the letters fall between the end of 1861 and June of 1863, prior to the deaths of Elizabeth (8 September 1863) and Joseph (4 February 1864). MSN/CW 5059-1 to MSN/CW 5059-82.\n\n\"H. B. W.\" LETTER. 1862. 1 letter (6 pp.). A letter written from 5-18 December 1862 from Camp Hamilton near Nashville, by a Union soldier identifiable only as \"H. B. W.\" The letter is addressed to Miss Tirzah Vail in Kewanee, Henry County, Illinois. If the author also came from Henry County, as seems likely, he may have belonged to either the 27th or the 51st Illinois Infantry, both of which were then in Nashville. The author writes of camp life, and advances opinions about the army and the war. MSN/CW 5021-1.\n\nISAAC IRA WHITE LETTER. 1864. 1 letter (2 pp.). Isaac Ira White (1841-1864) was born in Frederick County, Virginia. From 1862 until his death at the Wilderness in May 1864, he served in the Confederate cavalry, first with Company C, 24th Virginia Cavalry Battalion, and subsequently with Company H, 11th Virginia Cavalry Regiment (part of the \"Laurel Brigade.\") The letter, written in April 1864 from camp in Rockbridge County, Virginia, is addressed to his sister. In it, White mentions several fellow soldiers, including a substitute sent in place of a conscripted Frederick County man. He also writes of the scarcity of provisions in camp, and expresses concern about the hardships his family is enduring at home. Acquisition funded by Robert and Beverly O'Grady, 2005. MSN/CW 5031-1. [Introduction, Images & Transcriptions]\n\nLEONARD WILLIAMS LETTERS. 1861-1865. 127 letters. The greater part of this collection consists of 115 wartime personal letters written by Confederate cavalry officer Leonard Williams to his wife Anna Laval Williams, in Greenville, South Carolina. Leonard Williams (1823-1908) was born on his father's Sycamore Grove Plantation, Newberry District, South Carolina; he was teacher and principal at Newberry Academy and, from ca. 1854, a merchant and planter in Greenville. He served in the Confederate army for nearly four years, as orderly sergeant in Brooks Troop in the Hampton Legion cavalry (1861-62) and, with reorganization, as captain of Co. K, 2nd South Carolina Cavalry. Williams participated in the Eastern Theater's major campaigns of 1862-63, including the Peninsula, Antietam, and Gettysburg. In Spring 1864 the 2nd South Carolina was withdrawn to the Carolinas, where it remained for the duration of the war. Williams's letters to Anna range in date from 18 July 1861 to 11 February 1865; together they provide a sustained narrative of his years of service. Also in the collection are 12 additional wartime family letters, including one directed by Leonard Williams to his slaves. Acquisition funded by Robert and Beverly O'Grady, 2009-2012. MSN/CW 5068-1 to MSN/CW 5068-132. [Finding Aid]\n\nWILLIAMS-NEWTON LETTERS. 1862-1865. 27 letters, some with envelopes. Twenty-three of the letters in this group were written by Pvt. Henry C. Williams, during his service with Co. G, 108th New York Infantry (August 1862 to February 1864) and, subsequently, with the army's Veteran Reserve Corps. Williams was born in 1839, on a farm in Phelps Township, Ontario County, New York. He served in the Army of the Potomac (2nd Brigade, 3rd Division, II Corps) until suffering a shoulder wound at Gettysburg; after seven months' convalescence he was assigned to the 20th Regiment V.R.C., at Point Lookout Prison. Williams's letters range in date from August 1862 to January 1865, and are evenly spaced over that span. All but one are addressed to the household of William B. and Salina Newton, of Parma Township, Monroe County, New York (where Williams appears to have lived prior to enlisting). The author is literate, and committed to the Union cause; the letters treat social and political aspects of the war as well as military ones, and are imbued with Williams's own evangelical faithsomething he appears to have shared with the Newtons. Four additional letters (April 1864 and January 1865) were written by the Newtons' eldest son, Pvt. Arthur G. Newton (b. 1840/41), who enlisted with Henry Williams and served in Co. G of the 108th New York until his discharge (from leg wounds suffered at Spotsylvania) in January 1865. MSN/CW 5047-1 to MSN/CW 5047-28.\n\nGEORGE WASHINGTON WRIGHT LETTER. 1864. 1 letter (2 pages). A personal letter written on 30 June 1864 by Confederate 1st Lt. George Washington Wright (1839-1918) of the 1st Alabama Cavalry. The letter, written from the vicinity of Meridian, Mississippi, includes Washington's thoughts on the future path of the war. Acquisition funded by Robert and Beverly O'Grady, 2011. MSN/CW 5105-1.\n\nANNIE YOUNG LETTERS. 1862-1894 (bulk 1862-1865). 29 letters and 1 additional manuscript. Eighteen of the letters in this group were written by various Union military personnel to Miss Annie E. Young (b. c1837), a Philadelphia schoolteacher, during the Civil War. Five different authors are represented, the most prolific being Samuel Palmer Coates (nine letters, January 1862 to August 1863), writing as a seaman aboard the U.S.S Hartford, flagship of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron under David G. Farragut. Coates's 8-page letter of 18 April 1863 describes the ship's movements up and down the Mississippi over the previous month, during the campaigns against Port Hudson and Vicksburg. There are also four letters written by Thomas F. Goudy, mostly as carpenter's mate aboard the U.S.S. Susquehanna (January 1862 to April 1864); one by John Eva, aboard un identified vessel in the Potomac Flotilla (November 1861); two by Pvt. Charles Schlecht, Co. I, 3rd Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery (July 1864 to May 1865); and two by an unidentified soldier in Virginia (May to July 1862). MSN/CW 5063-1 to MSN/CW 5063-22."
