        "text": "65. Colossus\n\nThe Russian mutant with skin of living steel. When Colossus was first introduced into the X-Men universe, he definitely had one of the more interesting powers. Piotr Rasputin has been in the middle of some of the biggest storylines throughout the X-Comics run. While he has spent of most of his time as a member of the X-Men, he has also been one of Magneto’s Acolytes. One of the more intriguing stories with Colossus was in the Age of Apocalypse mini-series, where, fearing for the life of his sister, he goes on a rampage and kills his friend Iceman and Shadowcat (his future wife in the proper timeline) in the process.\n\n64. Ra’s al Ghul\n\nOne of Batman’s greatest foes. The leader of the ancient criminal organization The League of Assassins, Ra’s is an extremely skilled hand-to-hand combatant, has a genius level intellect, is a master strategist, and with the help of his Lazarus Pit, is ,for all intents and purposes, immortal. They can heal him of any wound and slow his aging down to a crawl. The downside of the use of those Pits is that once he emerges, it throws him into fits of utter madness that last a little longer each time. He has had many storied run-ins with the Dark Knight, but he has great respect for Batman and the work he is trying to do. Ra’s al Ghul is also the grandfather of Bruce Wayne’s son Damian.\n\n63. Spawn\n\nProbably Todd McFarlane’s most popular creation and the character that blew the doors open for the creator-owned properties movement of the early 90’s After CIA operative Al Simmons dies and is sent to Hell for the deaths of innocents caused by his work, he cuts a deal with Hell lord Malebolgia to get his soul back. In doing so, he becomes Spawn. Intended to be a weapon against the forces of Heaven, Simmons refuses and commits to use his abilities to help others. His intentions may be pure (mostly), but his methods are brutal and gruesome. This dichotomy paired with the off-the-charts cool factor of his costume has made Spawn one of the most popular characters in all of comics.\n\n62. Marv\n\nAnother brutal anti-hero with noble intent. After spending a night with a prostitute (unpaid), and waking to find her lying dead next to him in the morning with police already outside the door, he escapes and on goes on a hunt for the people responsible. His search leaves a trail of blood and bodies. His sense of justice for those that were kind to him in a cruel, unforgiving town like Basin City, and his willingness to take any amount of abuse and punishment to make sure that that justice is served has turned Marv into one of the most compelling and endearing characters to come of Frank Miller’s noir series, Sin City.\n\n61. Iron Fist\n\nThe resident Kung Fu master of Marvel Comics. Aside from being a nearly unmatched martial artist, Danny Rand also possesses the ability to “focus his chi” into his fists making them hard as iron and impervious to pain or inward to heal himself. While he has never been quite as popular with the mainstream as some of Marvel’s other properties, Iron Fist has been an integral part of some of the company’s biggest stories, most notably the Marvel Civil War, where he served as Captain America’s second-in-command. Look for that popularity to spike in the near future with a Netflix series of his own right around the corner.\n\nWell folks, we got our first look at the new Batsuit from the upcoming Batman vs. Superman film. I’ve been terribly critical of the movie up to this point, and my issues with it remain the same. I don’t like 99% of the casting, including Ben Affleck as Batman. I’m worried that the plot is going to get bloated with trying to give back stories for too many un-established characters. And as I wrote last time, I wasn’t impressed with Man of Steel. I also don’t get why they don’t just go ahead and call it “Justice League” since that’s basically what it’s going to be.\n\nBut if nothing else, this movie has absolutely NAILED the Batsuit! The costume looks like it jumped straight out of the comic book. The suit as a whole is very derivative of the one seen in Lee Bermejo’s A Christmas Carol-inspired Batman: Noel. The cape and cowl have touches of the one in Frank Miller’s masterpiece The Dark Knight Returns. The body even has hints of the costumes from the excellent Arkham video game series.\n\nI’ve heard grumblings from some that the suit looks silly, but I for one dig the crap out of it. I dig it enough to make me actually pay money to see the movie in theaters…something I didn’t bother to do for Man of Steel. I don’t feel like this suit is enough to change my opinion that Captain America 3 will beat this movie at the box office when the two comic giants square off in 2016, but with this first piece of promising news, it’s at least a step in the right direction."
