During this action at extremely close range, while the ship was under furious fire and was twice rammed by the rebel ship Morgan, McKnight remained steadfast at his gun throughout the thickest of the fight and was instrumental in inflicting damage on the enemy until the Varuna, so badly damaged that she was forced to beach, was finally sunk.” His obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle confirms his membership in the Medal of Honor Legion of the United States and reports that he was one of seventy men from New York who were awarded that decoration. That obituary notes that McKnight was a good friend of Admiral David Farragut and that Farragut was influential in promoting McKnight from coxswain to first mate to captain.\n\nIn civilian life, McKnight was a dealer in butter and eggs in the Washington Market in Manhattan, a position that he held for over twenty-seven years. After retiring from the business, he was a shipwright at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

Thomas, McLaey wrote to the Pension Bureau on behalf of his sister-in-law stating that “…she is sickly, very poor, and she and her children often have to go to bed hungry. Her daughter is sickly and their case is one that deserves to be acted on specially. I am in poor health and circumstances myself, and have to work hard to support myself and family, so am not able to help my sister-in-law as I otherwise would….” Section 105, lot 1919.\n\nMcLEER, JAMES (1839-1922).

Crooke (see) and was about to be admitted to the bar when the Civil War broke out. He enlisted as a private on April 18, 1861, and mustered into the 14th Brooklyn on May 23. His obituary notes that when the 14th was camped at Fort Greene, Brooklyn, before starting for the frontlines, it was known familiarly as the “Red-Legged Devils” because of the soldiers’ distinctive Zouave trousers.\n\nOn July 21, 1861, McLeer was wounded in the head and arm at First Bull Run, Virginia. Suffering from a painful wound near one eye, he was placed in an ambulance, but was abandoned by the teamster; he then managed to walk across Cub Run to safety. As a result of these injuries, he was hospitalized for several months. Promoted to corporal on November 1, 1861, he was wounded at Groveton, Virginia, on August 29, 1862, and his left arm was amputated. The pain from his arm stump plagued him throughout his lifetime. He was promoted to sergeant on March 1, 1863, and subsequently discharged for disability on July 27, 1863. McLeer was promoted by brevet to second lieutenant, first lieutenant, and captain on April 4, 1867.\n\nAfter the Civil War, McLeer practiced law, was elected Brooklyn auditor and street commissioner, served as United States Pension Agent for Long Island, was appointed postmaster of Brooklyn by President Rutherford B. Hayes and served in that position from 1877-1887, and was then Brooklyn city assessor.

Grant Post #327, and rose to the rank of brigadier general, brigade commander, 2nd Brigade, New York National Guard, the head of all militia in Brooklyn. He took part in the mobilization of Brooklyn regiments during the Spanish-American War. His obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle began and concluded with this tribute:\n\nAll old Brooklyn mourns the death of General James McLeer at the age of 83. We are inclined to think that in public life of the city, as in public life of the borough, no man was more loved, no man more respected. He had shed his blood for the Union, he had come back to civil existence with one arm gone and one leg permanently injured, and yet a strong constitution and normal habits of life enabled him to render fine service to the community, fine service to the National Guard of the State for fifty-six years…..\n\n…Sons and grandsons find example and stimulation in General McLeer’s career. Courage, enthusiasm, kindness, fortitude, on so broad a field, however have a wider influence, They reach and touch friends, acquaintances, the entire community. The general effect on character-making is their chief contribution to a common humanity.\n\nHe last lived at 309 East 21st Street in Brooklyn. He succumbed to arteriosclerosis. Section 114, lot 16977.\n\nMcLELLAN , DAVID (1825-1867). Major, 79th New York Infantry. Originally from Pollockshaws, Scotland, McLellan was a lithographer in Glasgow who immigrated to the United States in 1847, and soon became a naturalized citizen. He continued in his trade in New York City where his firm, a partnership with his brother James and known as D & J. McLellan, became successful lithographers known for advancing their art in the U.S. and for having integrity. After his brother James died unexpectedly in 1860, the firm was known as D. McLellan & Bros.\n\nAt the onset of the Civil War, he played a major role in organizing the 79th Regiment, also known as the Highland Guards; many of the recruits were from the same region of Scotland as McLellan. After enlisting as major at New York City on April 29, 1861, he was commissioned into the Field and Staff of the 79th New York on June 1. Early in the Civil War, the 79th wore a distinctive dress uniform that included red and white knee-socks in a diamond-shaped checkered pattern with a dirk, a knife used in hand-to-hand combat, placed in the right sock. Kilts and a white sporran (purse) were also worn. Although many men in the regiment wore a traditional boat-shaped Glengarry hat, McLellan chose a cap with a spectacular feather, a perk that officers had in uniform choice. According to his obituaries on July 28, 1867, in The New York Times and the New York Tribune, he commanded the 79th after the fall of Colonel Cameron at the Battle of Bull Run, Virginia, and was discharged on August 10, 1861.\n\nActive in promoting Scottish heritage, McLellan was member and chief of the Caledonian Club of New York for five years. The obituaries confirmed that he was involved in the organization of the 79th and was active in the regiment until his death. He was held in such esteem that the regiment’s flag was ordered to be draped in mourning for three months to memorialize him and the commissioned officers were ordered to wear mourning badges during that period. He was also a Freemason who at one time held the position of master of his lodge, the Scotia Lodge #634, whose history recalled his devotion to matters of special concern to Scotsmen, his service in the Civil War, and his “superior intellectual ability, pleasing personal presence, and genial and kindly nature.” Another article about his funeral in the New York Herald, which also noted his active role in organizing the 79th Regiment during the Civil War, reports that his name was universally known and respected among Scottish citizens of New York. The Herald stated that his friends remembered his kind disposition and said that “he had not a personal enemy in the world.” He died from dysentery at his home at 317 West 12th Street in Manhattan.\n\nTwo gravestones mark his final resting place. One was put there by his wife (“IN MEMORY OF MY DEAR BELOVED HUSBAND”) and the other, according to its inscription, was “ERECTED BY HIS FRIENDS TO HIS MEMORY.” The inscriptions on his tombstone confirm his leadership of the 79th, his role in the Caledonian Club and his membership and position as master in the Freemasons.

Although some documents report that McLeod was born in New Jersey, an online biography indicates that he was from New Brunswick, Canada. During the Civil War, he enlisted as a private on September 2, 1861, mustered into Company F of the 7th New Jersey that day, and was discharged for disability on February 2, 1863, at Newark, New Jersey.\n\nMcLeod worked for the Waterbury Clock Company for 50 years and belonged to the Ulysses S. Grant Post #327 of the Grand Army of the Republic. In 1880, he applied for and received a pension, certificate 204,244. His last address was 1039 Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn.

Section 142, lot 24362, grave 5.\n\nMcLEOD, THEODORUS (or THEODORE, THEODOSIUS) (1844-1920). Corporal, 38th Pennsylvania Militia, Company D; private, 84th Regiment, New York State National Guard, Company F. A New York City native, he began his first two years of higher education at Lafayette College before taking time off to serve in the Union cause. The records of Union College, his second school, indicate that he was a private with the 5th Pennsylvania Volunteers in 1862, but that service is not indicated in his soldier or pension records. After taking time off from his studies, McLeod enlisted as a corporal at Easton, Pennsylvania, on June 29, 1863, mustered into Company D, or Captain Hay’s Company, of the 38th Pennsylvania Militia on July 3 at Reading, and mustered out on August 7, 1863. He re-enlisted in 1864 and served for 100 days in Company F of the 84th New York State National Guard.\n\nAfter resuming his studies, McLeod graduated from Union College, class of 1865, then studied law in New York City and was admitted to the bar in 1868. He practiced law for several years in Pittsburgh, then returned to New York City where he was a lawyer, notary public and commissioner for Pennsylvania at 55 Liberty Street. On February 5, 1870, he was appointed assistant registrar of the Croton Aqueduct Department. Remaining active in military affairs, he became a captain of the 84th New York State National Guard on May 30, 1870. The 1878 New York City Directory identifies him as a lawyer, notary, and commissioner; the 1894 New York City Directory states that he was an examiner. McCleod was employed at the Custom House for 35 years. In 1907, his application for an invalid pension was approved, certificate 1,139,911. His obituary in The New York Times confirmed his service in the 84th New York National Guard. His last residence was 111 Union Avenue in Clifton, New Jersey. His death was attributed to arteriosclerosis with gangrene. Section 24, lot 6745.\n\nMcLETCHIE (or McLATCHIE), ANDREW (1836-1867). Assistant surgeon, 79th New York Infantry. McLetchie, who was originally from Scotland, enlisted as an assistant surgeon at New York City on June 26, 1861, and was commissioned into the Field and Staff of the 79th New York (the Highlanders). He was taken as a prisoner of war at the Battle of First Bull Run, Virginia, on July 21, 1861, and held in confinement at the Liggon Tobacco Factory in Richmond, Virginia, on July 23. The aforementioned factory was confiscated in 1861 and used as a prison for Union soldiers and later as a hospital for Libby Prison. McLetchie was paroled back to Union forces two months later and was discharged from service on April 15, 1862. He apparently re-enlisted at some point and worked as an assistant surgeon at Camp Parole on the outskirts of Annapolis, Maryland.\n\nBut, McLetchie’s service was not without controversy. He is named in “Tarnished Scalpels: The Court-martials of Fifty Union Surgeons” (2000) by Thomas Power Lowry and Jack D. Welsh. The authors, in their chapter about McLetchie, note that he was charged with being drunk while in charge of the hospital at Camp Parole from January 6 through March 6, 1863, and again from March 21 through April 4, 1863. He was so drunk on June 10, 1863, that he had to be helped to bed and was also drunk in August 1863 and January 1864. On January 22, 1864, he was charged with “conduct unbecoming an officer” when he left Camp Parole without permission for Annapolis, returned to camp around midnight, drunk, did not know the camp password, and tried to ride his horse past two sentry guards; the next morning he failed to report to headquarters as promised. At his court-martial in January 1864, it was asserted that when McLetchie returned to camp, he was drunk, had thick speech, staggered when he dismounted, could not control his horse, and failed to show up at headquarters. One doctor testified that McLetchie, apparently due to his drinking, was unable to remember patients’ answers to his questions and was unfit and unable to concentrate. Further, he appeared to be drunk, could not express himself clearly, smelled of liquor, and had to be undressed and put to bed by the orderlies on numerous occasions. Two doctors defended McLetchie stating that his “thick speech” was the result of his Scottish brogue and that even a glass of cider flushed his cheeks. Initially found guilty, his dismissal was recommended. However, J. R. Magruder, the mayor of Annapolis, wrote to President Abraham Lincoln urging McLetchie’s reinstatement, noting his bravery at First Bull Run and claiming he was a “worthy gentleman” who had the support of twenty-three officers of the 79th Highlanders. Ultimately, John Hay, one of Lincoln’s two secretaries, noted that the President had removed the “disability” resting on Surgeon McLetchie, making him eligible for reappointment as of May 5, 1864. McCletchie was then contracted to work as a private physician for the federal government in Baltimore for $100.00 per month. Lowry and Welsh noted that he served briefly at Annapolis and Baltimore in 1865 and with the 8th Infantry.\n\nAs per his obituary in the New York Herald, Mcletchie was a member of the Caledonian Club; members of that organization were invited to attend his funeral as were members of the 79th who were asked to assemble at the armory in uniform. His last residence was on West 59th Street and Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. In 1891, an application was made for a minor’s pension by his twenty-six year old daughter, Kate Dodson, application 531,984, but it was never certified. The daughter, who communicated with the Pension Bureau for nine years, declared that her father died from disease contracted while in service, but no evidence of service-related disability or treatment was found.

He was promoted to sergeant on October 18, 1862, but was reduced in rank to private the next month on November 1, and served in that capacity until he was discharged for disability on March 3, 1863, at Fort Monroe, Virginia. Upon his death, his mother, Eliza McMenomy (who is in the same lot), applied for a pension, application 300,962, but there is no certificate number.

After enlisting at Brooklyn as a private on April 23, 1861, he mustered into the 13th Regiment, Engineers, for three months on May 17. As per his obituary in The Locomotive, the periodical of the company for which he worked, he was assigned almost immediately by General Benjamin F. Butler to superintend the construction of the first military railroad in the United States. McMurray commanded 3,000 troops on this project. This railroad extended from the wharves of the military academy at Annapolis, Maryland, to the juncture of the Elk Ridge Railroad, two miles away. That account notes that in four days, the land was surveyed, the road-bed leveled, and the railroad constructed and tested by the first train. His obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle relates the same achievement but notes that the task was accomplished in twenty-four hours. McMurray was thanked by the War Department for this monumental engineering effort. He mustered out on August 6, 1861. In 1862, when his unit was reactivated and part of the 13th National Guard, he was promoted to second lieutenant on May 28, commissioned into Company E the same day, participated in several skirmishes near Suffolk and Black Water, Virginia, and mustered out on September 12 at Brooklyn.

(His brother was the special agent for the same company in Saratoga, New York, as noted in Robert’s obituary in The Saratogian.) McMurray was the first to advocate welded rather than riveted boilers and planned the 1890 construction of the tall smoke stack for the Clark Thread Company’s factory in Newark, New Jersey. Although initially criticized by some engineers, the tall chimney construction became commonplace. He also advocated steam boiler insurance, primarily as a preventive measure. At the time of the 1880 census, he was living in Castleton, Staten Island, and was employed in accident insurance. He listed his occupation as boiler inspector when he mustered into the G.A.R. on July 3, 1891. In 1904, his application for an invalid pension was granted, certificate 1,098,944. On February 22, 1906, he was honored by his company and received the honorary title, “Dean of Steam Boiler Inspection.”\n\nA man of many pursuits, McMurray owned a yacht, the Aeolus, was a member of the New York Yacht Club, the 13th Regiment Veterans’ Association, the Freemasons (he was a 32nd degree Scottish Rite Mason), the Ulysses S. Grant Post #327 of the G.A.R., and the Society of Old Brooklynites. The Locomotive (Volume 28, 1911), a periodical of the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company, confirms his Civil War service and honors McMurray’s life in his obituary by remarking on his “estimable personal qualities” and “the breadth and soundness of his professional attainments.” His last address was 435 Washington Avenue in Brooklyn. He died after a short bout of pneumonia. An article in the Niagara Falls Gazette on May 31, 1934, “Lloyd’s Register Shows Aged Yachts Are Still In Use,” noted that McMurray’s yacht, originally built for him by Sammy Ayres in 1880 and not rebuilt, was still plying the waters of New York Harbor under the flag of the Crescent Athletic-Hamilton Club. Section 177, lot 13619, grave 2.\n\nMcMURRAY, WILLIAM (1843-1900). Private, 9th New York Infantry, Company G. McMurray was originally from Fort Lee, New Jersey. He enlisted as a private at New York City on May 3, 1861, and mustered into the 9th New York, also known as the Hawkins’ Zouaves, the next day. He mustered out of service on May 20, 1863, at New York City. In civilian life, he was the stage carpenter for the pantomime artist and clown George L. Fox. The 1886 New York City Directory lists him as a carpenter.\n\nOn May 4, 1900, the New York Herald and The New York Times, both of which confirmed McMurray’s Civil War service, reported on his circumstances of his death. He came home from work suffering from a nose bleed that his daughter temporarily stopped with cold towels. However, he awoke during the night with his bedclothes soaked in blood. Again, his daughter stopped the hemorrhage but the next day, two doctors were unable to stop the bleeding and he bled to death. His last residence was 309 West 119th Street in Manhattan. Shortly after his death in 1900, his widow applied for and received a pension, certificate 510,025. Section 136, lot 28307, grave 378.\n\nMcNALLY, JOHN JONES (1838-1894).

A native of New York, McNamara enlisted as a private under the alias “John Wilson” at Jamaica, mustered into the 5th New York Heavy Artillery that same day, and mustered out on June 24, 1865, at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.\n\nMcNamara was the subject of an article in The New York Times on June 17, 1872. As per that account, McNamara’s wife, Mary McCarthy, came home drunk and found her husband sleeping on the roof of their house at 252 Delancey Street. After waking him, an altercation ensued and the two either lost their balance or were dragged off the roof, falling forty feet to the sidewalk. McNamara suffered a broken leg; McCarthy was slightly injured; another paper, the Jamestown Daily Journal, incorrectly reported that they were fatally injured.\n\nThe 1875 New York City Directory lists McNamara as a caulker. In 1892, he applied for and received an invalid pension, certificate 860,251. In 1897, he was listed as a first class wood caulker at the New York Navy Yard. McNamara was a member of the George G. Meade Post #38 of the Grand Army of the Republic; members of the Meade Post were invited to attend his funeral. An article in The Saratogian on August 22, 1918, reported that McNamara and another Civil War veteran vacationed in Saratoga Springs. That article, which focused on their wartime service, incorrectly identified their regiment as the 5th New York Cavalry. His last residence was 41 Greenwich Avenue in Manhattan. According to his obituary in The New York Times, he died after a long illness. Section 15, lot 17263, grave 916.\n\nMcNARY, WILLIAM HENRY (1831-1890). Brigadier general by brevet; colonel, 158th New York Infantry; engineer, 13th New York Infantry. Born in Brooklyn, McNary’s obituaries in the New York Herald, Brooklyn Daily Eagle and The New York Times report that he served with the 14th Regiment prior to the Civil War with the rank of captain. In civilian life, he was a machinist and inventor; one of his patents (1861) was for a knitting apparatus. His passport application of 1861 notes that he was 5′ 9½” tall with gray eyes, dark auburn hair, fair complexion, a prominent nose and forehead, and medium nose. During the Civil War, he enlisted at Brooklyn as an engineer on May 28, 1862, mustered immediately into the Field and Staff of the 13th New York, and mustered out on September 12 at Brooklyn. He was then immediately commissioned into the 158th New York as its lieutenant colonel with rank from August 29. As per his muster roll, he was an engineer who was 5′ 10″ tall with gray eyes, brown hair and a light complexion. The 158th Regiment was primarily stationed in North and South Carolina. He was promoted to colonel on April 16, 1865, and mustered out on June 30, 1865, at Richmond, Virginia. He was brevetted brigadier general of volunteers on March 13, 1865, “for gallant and meritorious services.”\n\nIn his field report of April 15, 1865, from Appomattox Court-House, McNary wrote about the charge on Fort Gregg, Virginia, on April 2, “…At the storming and capture of Fort Gregg, this regiment, together with the Eighty-ninth New York Volunteers, advanced in the face of a very heavy front fire, and after a bloody and determined resistance on the part of the enemy the fort was carried at the point of the bayonet…The staff of the State colors and both flags bear many marks of the enemy’s fire…” Shedding more light on that action, Colonel Harrison Fairchild, commanding the 89th New York, cited McNary’s leadership and the actions of the 158th: “…they charged the works, capturing 300 prisoners, one six-gun battery, horses, harness, and appurtenances, two battle-flags, all of which was turned over to the provost-marshal of the Sixth Corps.”\n\nMcNary’s obituaries note that he was an advocate of the formation of the G.A.R., was the first vice commander of the organization, and was a member of Rankin Post # 10. Because of McNary’s prominence in the G.A.R., his portrait was displayed at the Rankin Post’s headquarters. The 1870 census lists him as an inventor. He often traveled to Europe to sell patents for his knitting machines in Germany, France and England. In 1881, his wife and daughter accompanied him and they remained on the continent for nine years. When McNary returned to Brooklyn in 1890, he brought home a collection of souvenirs including a magnificent basket-hilt sword with a 32 inch flexible blade (photos below) crafted by Nathaniel Jeffrey, a jeweler and sword-cutter to the king during the 1750s. (The padding in the photo was added later). He last lived at 191 State Street in Brooklyn. McNary died of heart failure after a bout of pneumonia; a delegation from the Rankin Post attended his funeral. Josephine McNary, who is interred with him, applied for and received a widow’s pension in 1890, certificate 302,065. His sword was passed on to his descendants.

The History of Homeopathy and Its Institutions in America by William Harvey King, which reports that McNeil was a surgeon “during the rebellion,” lists him as a physician who practiced in West Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1865 and in Jersey City in 1875. The 1880 census indicates that he was a physician whose personal estate was $800; he is listed as a physician in the 1883 Jersey City Directory. As per one obituary, in which he was referred to as Dr. John McNeil, he was one of the commissioners of the County Board of Health in Jersey City. That obituary and his obituary in the New York Herald confirm his Civil War service. His last residence was 555 Palisade Avenue in Jersey City, New Jersey. Nephritis was the cause of his death. He was survived by his wife, Sarah Holmes McNeil, who is interred with him, and four children. Section 145, lot 24076.\n\nMcNEILL (or McNEIL), JOHN (1834-1889). Captain, 84th New York (14th Brooklyn) Infantry, Company H. McNeill, who was born in Willsborough, Ireland, was a painter by trade who immigrated to the United States in about 1854. As per his obituary in the New York Herald, he joined the 14th regiment in October 1856, and was promoted to corporal in November 1858. During the Civil War, McNeill enlisted at Brooklyn on April 18, 1861, as a private, and mustered into the 14th on May 23. On July 21, 1861, he was taken as a prisoner of war at Bull Run, Virginia, was confined at Richmond, Virginia, two days later, and exchanged on an unknown date. As per his muster roll, he was captured while on picket duty at Falls Church, Virginia, on November 18, 1861, and exchanged on December 6, 1862. His muster roll notes that he returned to duty on December 16, 1862. He rose to first sergeant on August 4, 1861, to second lieutenant on March 2, 1862, but was not mustered in at that rank, and became a captain on October 24, 1862. His obituary notes that he was with the 14th at the Battle of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on July 1-3, 1863. McNeill mustered out on June 6, 1864, and according to his obituary, was made a brevet major of U.S. Volunteers after his discharge.\n\nThe 1870 census reports that McNeill was a painter and he is listed as a painter in the 1883 Brooklyn Directory. He continued his service with the 14th throughout his lifetime and was elected major in 1886, a position he held up to his death. His tombstone is inscribed with the dates of his long-term service in the 14th. He last lived at 844 Fulton Street in Brooklyn where he died after a short illness. Section 109, lot 438.\n\nMcNEILL, THOMAS (1832-1885). Second lieutenant, 52nd Regiment, New York State National Guard, Company D. Of Irish origin, he enlisted at Brooklyn as a second lieutenant on June 19, 1863, and was commissioned into the 52nd National Guard that day. The 52nd was ordered to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, two days later to meet the Confederate invasion, took part in a skirmish at Oyster Point, Pennsylvania, on June 28, and mustered out at Brooklyn after serving 30 days, and after the invasion had been turned back, on July 25. As per the 1880 census and the 1882 Brooklyn Directory, he was a painter. His last address was 160 Washington Street in Brooklyn. He died of chronic Bright’s disease. Section 146, lot 25626.\n\nMcNISH (or MacNEISH), ANDREW (1840-1916). Landsman, United States Navy. McNish was born in Cutchogue, Suffolk County. An article in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle on August 17, 1859, notes that McNish was elected as a plumber with the Fire Department on Warren Street in Brooklyn. The 1860 census indicates that he was a plumber’s apprentice. During the Civil War, he enlisted at New York City as a landsman on November 6, 1862, and served in the United States Navy until he was discharged at Brooklyn in December 1863. According to his enlistment records, he was a baker (like his father). On September 23, 1864, he re-enlisted as a landsman and returned to the Navy, served on board the USS Pawtuxet, andwas discharged “at the end of war” on July 5, 1865, at Brooklyn.\n\nAccording to the 1880 census, McNish was living in Albany, New York, where he was a railroad conductor; the family moved to Peekskill, New York in 1892. The Highland Democrat in an article on December 17, 1892, reported that McNish was the officer of the day for the Abram S. Vosburgh Post #95 of the G.A.R. in Peekskill; he was re-elected to that position in December 1894. In April 1893, his application for a plumber’s license in Peekskill was approved; his shop, specializing in plumbing and gas and steam fitting was at 826 South Street where he advertised having thirty years’ experience in that trade (see ad below). The 1900 census states that he was living in Brooklyn and working there as a plumber; he is listed as a plumber in the 1901 Brooklyn Directory and as a steamfitter in the 1904 Brooklyn Directory.\n\nMcNish was a steam-fitter at the time he entered the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers at Hampton, Virginia, on September 28, 1911. At that time, he was 5′ 9″ tall with brown eyes, gray hair and a dark complexion. He was discharged from that facility on August 12, 1916. He had a pension from the Navy under certificate 34,736. According to his obituaries in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle and the Brooklyn Standard Union, he was a member of the Brooklyn Volunteer Firemen’s Association, Waterwitch Hose #8; members were invited to attend his funeral. His last residence was 884 Flatlands Avenue in Brooklyn. Rose McNish, his second wife, applied for and was granted a widow’s pension, certificate 820,674. Section 82, lot 1746.\n\nMcPHAIL, DANIEL H. (1813-1884). Lieutenant colonel by brevet; major and additional paymaster, United States Volunteers Paymaster’s Department. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, he was appointed second lieutenant of the United States Army by President Andrew Jackson in 1837. While serving with the 5th Infantry, U. S. Army at Fort Snelling, the Magazine of Western History, Volume 11, reports that McPhail, short in stature but with a temper, had an incident related to the famous slave, Dred Scott. Apparently, Surgeon Emerson of the 5th Infantry brought Dred Scott with him to Fort Snelling, Minnesota, bought Scott a wife, and tried to secure a stove for them as winter approached in 1837. McPhail, who was quartermaster in charge of supplies, told Emerson that Scott would have to wait until others were accommodated. McPhail was then insulted by Emerson and proceeded to strike the surgeon in the face breaking his eyeglasses and bruising his nose. An uproar ensued when Emerson ran to his quarters to get a pair of pistols but the dispute subsided and was referred to as a “tempest in a teapot.”\n\nMcPhail served in the 5th Infantry of the U.S. Army from 1837-1849, including service in the Mexican War as a captain as of July 10, 1846, and was brevetted to major on August 20, 1847, for “meritorious conduct in the Battles of Contreras and Churubusco, Mexico.” As per his obituary in the New York Tribune, he served under Generals Taylor and Scott in numerous battles and his bravery was evident: “In one engagement his uniform was pierced with bullet holes in the front and across the shoulders.” That obituary goes on to note that the city of Baltimore presented him in February 1849 with a sword with a silver scabbard (photo below), made especially for him by Baltimore cutler Samuel Jackson, and inscribed with the names of the engagements in which he took part (Monterey, Vera Cruz, San Antonio, Churubusco, Molino Del Ray, Chapultepac, Garita de Belen, Garita de San Cosine, Mexico City). The octagon-shaped hilt of the sword was mounted with a silver head of George Washington. He resigned his commission on April 30, 1849, and lived in Baltimore. On October 16, 1852, he wrote an angry letter to the editor of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle noting that his name was mocked as “Mr. McPhay, a locofoco orator from Baltimore,” who supported Franklin Pierce for president. In 1860, although an ardent Democrat, he was one of the 1,016 Baltimoreans, a city with many Southern sympathizers, who cast a ballot for President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nAt the onset of the Civil War, McPhail was offered a commission by General Scott and served on the staff of General Rosencrans with Garfield and Hayes. (See his letter of acceptance below.) He entered service as a major on June 1, 1861, and was commissioned into the United States Volunteers and promoted to major and additional paymaster that day. McPhail was involved in a controversial case involving Judge Richard Bennett Carmichael of Baltimore who was accused of tampering with Union supporters during the November elections and of being a Southern sympathizer. McPhail, the Deputy Provost Marshal of the Baltimore Military Police, accompanied by two policemen, went to Carmichael’s courtroom to arrest him. Carmichael, according to John W. Crisfield in the Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Volume 5, attacked one of the policemen. In the altercation that ensued, McPhail was “compelled to use force to secure him, and he unluckily received a superficial wound on the head….” Carmichael was taken into federal custody in late May 1862; eventually, he was released by order of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton on December 2, 1862. Subsequently, he was the chief paymaster at Wheeling, West Virginia. He was promoted by brevet to lieutenant colonel on March 13, 1865, “for faithful and meritorious service,” and remained in service at New Orleans, Louisiana, and Charleston, South Carolina, until he resigned on January 1, 1869. The 1880 census lists him as living with his sister in Brooklyn but not employed. He last lived at 43 Sand Street in Brooklyn. His death was attributed to general debility. Section 23, lot 4049.\n\nMcQUEEN, JAMES (1831-1861). Captain, 15th New York Engineers, Company B. Born in Scotland, McQueen grew up to be a firefighter with the Neptune Engine Company #2 on Hicks Street in Brooklyn before the Civil War. In addition, he was active in Democratic Party politics and, according to an article in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle on June 14, 1855, he was one of the men from the Democratic Central Union Club who was chosen to serve as “banner guard” at a planned march in support of the presidential nomination of James Buchanan and John C. Breckinridge. On June 17, 1861, he enlisted as a captain at Willets Point, New York, and was immediately commissioned into the 15th Engineers.\n\nThe circumstances of his death are confusing in the written reports. On September 17, 1861, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported that McQueen had been injured and that, with no accurate reports on his injury, it was assumed that he was wounded in a skirmish with the pickets of the enemy. The article concluded, “Capt. McQueen is too good a man to lose at the juncture of affairs about Washington. His loss will be a sad one for the regiment to which he is attached, for no braver man exists than he is.” As per his soldier record and the official list of Volunteer Deaths, he died on September 18, 1861, at Alexandria, Virginia, from an accidental skull fracture; the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported on September 19 that he died from a fall from his horse. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, in that obituary, noted that he was a prominent politician in the Democratic Party and was held in high esteem by those in his party and by his friends. On September 24, 1861, a subsequent article in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle indicated that he died in an Army hospital from the effects of a bayonet wound suffered in an encounter with the enemy’s pickets. That article goes on to say that the Brooklyn Common Council had appropriated $250 to defray the expenses of McQueen’s funeral and that a committee headed by Francis B. Spinola (see) would draft a testimonial to commemorate McQueen’s service in the Army.\n\nIn advance of his funeral, that committee directed preparations to assure proper respect and observance of military orders for McQueen’s remains. McQueen was temporarily placed in a vault at Alexandria where he was embalmed; the New York Committee telegraphed that it would begin the process of returning his body home. The Fire Department, of which McQueen was a member, would be invited to the funeral and the military would be asked to participate. Members of the Board of Aldermen as well as ordinary citizens and family would also attend the funeral at City Hall. Alderman Strong of the Common Council indicated that McQueen was the first officer from Brooklyn who lost his life in the line of duty and that condolences were necessary for his aged parents for whom he was the sole support. Strong said, “There was no better incentive to bravery on the battlefield than the consciousness that Brooklyn would take care of the families of those who fell in defence of their country.”\n\nOn September 29, the date that the funeral took place, McQueen’s elaborate metal coffin was brought to Brooklyn’s City Hall. The funeral procession was accompanied by the tolling of fire bells. The procession moved toward the grave and flags at Brooklyn’s City Hall and other public sites were lowered to half-staff. Among those in the procession were a detachment of police, members of his regiment, pall-bearers, and an honor guard consisting of members of the Engineer Corps. In addition, the procession included McQueen’s parents, clergy, and members of the Common Council and Fire Department. The following resolutions were adopted by the Common Council and were reprinted in an article about his funeral, which was held at Brooklyn City Hall, that appeared in The New York Times on September 30:\n\nResolved, that the Common Council has heard, with feelings of deep regret, of the death of Capt. JAMES MCQUEEN, of Company B, Fifteenth Regiment, N.Y.S.V., who was killed at the seat of war in Virginia, in discharge of his duty.\n\nResolved, That we bow in submission to the terrible decree by which our country has lost a brave officer, Brooklyn an honorable citizen, and the aged parents of the deceased their only main stay.\n\nResolved, That we mingle our grief with the sorrow-stricken father and mother, and hereby tender to them, in this their hour of trial, our heartfelt sympathy and condolence.\n\nResolved, That a committee of three be appointed to take into consideration the appropriateness of offering to the aged parents of the deceased such testimonials, in the name of the city, as may to some extent manifest their appreciation of the virtue and services of the gallant dead.\n\nHe was interred on September 29. The New York Herald, in its article about the funeral, of which Spinola was the grand marshal, noted that the members of the procession wore white satin badges bound with black crepe and that the engineers of the Fire Department had their trumpets draped in crepe. Ordinary citizens gathered in the vicinity of the procession route “to indulge in the melancholy duty of paying a last tribute to the dead soldier.” The Herald reported that thousands of people thronged the streets and that a deep feeling of sympathy was pervasive. The hearse was drawn by four black horses bedecked with the trappings of mourning. As per The New York Times in its report of McQueen’s funeral at City Hall, members off the Board of Alderman, military, firemen and private citizens attended. The Times included the aforementioned resolutions in its article. As per the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, the procession moved through Montague Place, Clinton Street, Hamilton Avenue, Third Avenue and then to 24th Street, a route thronged with 8,000-10,000 spectators. Following the funeral services at the gravesite, members of the 13th regiment fired off a final salute to McQueen. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported that the Reverend Henry Jackson Van Dyke, a controversial figure who preached about the Biblical basis of slavery, presided over the military funeral rites.

As per his muster roll, he was a baker who was 5′ 7″ tall with blue eyes, brown hair and a medium complexion. On May 2, 1863, he was wounded in action at the Battle of Chancellorsville, Virginia. He mustered out on June 7, 1865, at Bladensburg, Maryland. Trow’s New York City Directory for 1867-68 and the 1870 census state that he was a laborer; the New York City Directory for 1872 indicates that he was employed as a baker. His last address was 49 Norfolk Street in Manhattan. The cause of his death was pneumonia. Section 17, lot 17245, grave 367.\n\nMcWHOOD (or McELROOD), EDWARD (or EDWIN) (1843-1924). Private, 12th Regiment, New York State Militia, Company E. Born in New York City, McWhood, who was also known as Edwin McElrood, served with the 12th Regiment for three months in 1862 from May 31 through October 8 and returned to the 12th Regiment in 1863 for 30 days from June 17 through July 30.\n\nThe 1880 census shows that he was a bookbinder living in Newark, New Jersey. In 1897, he applied for and received an invalid pension, certificate 1,113,421. He was still living in Newark and employed as a bookbinder according to the 1900 and 1910 censuses, and a help wanted ad in the New York Daily Tribune on January 15, 1910. The 1920 census indicates he was a bookbinder living in New York City. He last lived at 70 Bank Street in Manhattan but also owned a summer house in New Baltimore, New York, that was purchased in 1922. He died of heart disease. A government-issued gravestone inscribed with his Civil War service marks his burial site.\n\nIn January 1930, Ida McWhood, who is interred with him, applied for and received a widow’s pension, certificate a-5-23-30. In her application, it was determined that “she was one-fourth disabled from normal earning” on account of her age. The property she owned in New Baltimore, New York, was valued at $2,000, and her only income was derived from boarders during the summer months. The recommended pension was $30 a month. On April 25, 1930, The Recorder reported that President Hoover signed a private bill sponsored by Congressman Pratt that granted Ida McWhood, who otherwise would not have been eligible, a Civil War widow’s pension. Section 143, lot 31397.\n\nMcWILLIAMS, CHARLES S. (1844-1907). Musician, 143rd New York Infantry, Company G. A native of New York, he enlisted as a musician at Bloomingburg, New York, on August 14, 1862, and mustered into the 143rd on September 9. As per his muster roll, McWilliams was absent and sent to the hospital in Fairfax Seminary, Virginia, from April 15 through April 20, 1862. The Veterans Census of 1890 notes that he was wounded in the right shoulder at the Battle of Resaca, Georgia (May 13-15, 1864). He mustered out after three years of service on July 20, 1865, at Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nThe 1880 census indicates that McWilliams was a student; according to the 1884 Brooklyn Directory, he was a bookkeeper. The 1885, 1888 and 1889 Brooklyn Directories state that he was a cabinetmaker. In 1889, he applied for and received an invalid pension, certificate 557,688. He was admitted to the United States National Home for Disabled Soldiers in Dayton, Ohio, on June 9, 1897. At that time, he was a 5′ 6″ tall bookkeeper with gray eyes, gray hair and a dark complexion. He cited his wartime right calf injury and cardiac troubles as the reasons for his admission. No discharge date is given. As per the 1900 census, he was working as a janitor in Brooklyn. His last address was 1149 Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn. He died of pneumonia. A burial record mistakenly shows that Charles S. McWilliams was buried at the Dayton National Cemetery; in fact, he is buried at Green-Wood. Sadie Treadwell McWilliams, whom he married in 1889 and who was first married to Charles Treadwell (see), applied for and received a widow’s pension in 1907, certificate 630,930.

Remaining in service after the War, he was promoted to assistant paymaster on July 23, 1866, and became a paymaster on January 25, 1870. Mead died from intermittent fever in San Francisco at the Mare Island Navy Yard on November 26, 1872, and was interred at Green-Wood on May 27, 1873.\n\nAs per Mead’s obituary in the New York Herald on May 25, 1873, officers of the Army and Navy, friends of his father, and Freemasons were invited to attend his funeral. A report on his funeral appeared in the New York Herald on May 28 which noted the presence of marines and Navy officers from the Flushing Avenue barracks and a contingent from his Masonic temple. That article concluded:\n\nAt the conclusion of the services the coffin was borne to the hearse, which later was draped with the Stars and Stripes. On the lid of the casket rested the uniform, hat, sword and belt of Mr. Mead. The cortege, headed by the band of the receiving ship Vermont, the marine guard, Free Masons and the hearse, moved off for Greenwood (sic).

Section 60, lot 1004.\n\nMEAGHER, ELIZABETH TOWNSEND (1840-1906). Elizabeth Townsend Meagher was a native of New York State, where her great-grandfather, owned 23,000 acres in Orange County and along the New Jersey border, and had established the Townsend Iron Works, one of the first iron industries on the continent. He forged the 100-ton chain that stretched across the Hudson River at West Point, New York, during the Revolutionary War, preventing British ships from getting any farther north. A Protestant, she traveled to Ireland before her 1855 marriage to General Thomas Meagher (see), visited Waterford, Meagher’s home town, imeeting his father and his son; Thomas, still a wanted man, was unable to accompany her. She converted to Catholicism in order to marry Meagher. Their wedding was performed by John Hughes, the archibishop of New York, at Hughes’s home. Their marriage was to be a partnership—as Thomas said, she was “never, never [to] hesitate to question me concerning anything which interests you, painfully or otherwise, in my regard.” Her father, a millionaire, removed her from his will for marrying Meagher and, though he allowed the Meaghers to live with him in his Fifth Avenue mansion, never provided any financial support to them.\n\nElizabeth and her husband were partners, travelling through the American South and South America together. When the Civil War began, Meagher chose to fight for the Union, and, in a series of eloquent speeches, urged other Irish immigrants to do so. She often accompanied Meagher to the front during the Civil War and was with him for a good deal of his military service. She helped nurse her husband back to health after the Battle of First Bull Run, Virginia, and was alongside other officers’ wives at the front helping the soldiers. A regiment in the Irish Brigade, known as “Mrs. Meagher’s Own,” the 88th New York Volunteer Infantry, was named for her. She marched at the head of parades, side-by-side with her husband, in support of the Union. She designed one of the Irish Brigade’s flags, to be carried into battle. She was there, next to him, watching as he drilled his recruits at Fort Schuyler in the Bronx or recruited at the brigade headquarters on Broadway in Manhattan. She sold the recruits on love of America; he sold them love of Ireland.\n\nWhen Thomas Meagher was the acting governor of the Montana Territory, she joined him there in June of 1866. After learning of her husband’s disappearance into the Missouri River in the Montana Territory, on July 1, 1867, she spent 67 days in a futile search along the river for her husband’s body, as per her obituary in the New York Sun. Fort Elizabeth Meagher, near Bozeman, Montana, established in 1867, was named in her honor. Active in Catholic charities and the president of the Cancer Hospital, she last lived on Milton Road in Rye, New York, surviving on her husband’s service pension. She lamented, to her dying day, that her husband, Thomas, did not have a final resting place. Her death was caused by chronic valvular disease and emphysema. According to her obituary in The New York Times, six of the honorary pallbearers at her funeral were men who served under her husband in the Irish Brigade during the Civil War: John Dwyer, Colonel James Quinlan, Thomas Byrne, Colonel John Meagher, Colonel Denis McCarty, and Captain Michael McGuire. Section 206, lot 30910.\n\nMEAGHER, THOMAS FRANCIS (1823-1867). Brigadier general, United States Volunteers; acting major, 69th New York State Militia. He was born in Waterford, Ireland, where his father was a wealthy merchant, mayor, and member of Parliament. Meagher (pronounced “Mar”) was educated at the Jesuit College in Clongowes, County Kildare, Ireland, and at Stonyhurst College in England where he remained until 1843. A fervent Irish nationalist, known as “Meagher of the Sword,” he was spurred on by the Great Hunger caused by English policies exporting food crops while millions of Irish starved, and attempted to lead a rebellion against British rule. In 1846, he became a leader of the revolutionary Young Ireland Party, led by poets and orators. Meagher became famous for his eloquent and rousing oratory. It was Meagher who, in 1848, introduced the Irish tricolor flag of green, white, and orange, saying as he unveiled it:\n\n“. . . I trust that the old country will not refuse this symbol of a new life from one of her youngest children. I need not explain its meaning. The quick and passionate intellect of the generation now springing into arms will catch it at a glance. The white in the center signifies a lasting truce between the ‘orange’ and the ‘green’ and I trust that beneath its folds, the hands of the Irish Protestant and the Irish Catholic may be clasped in generous and heroic brotherhood . . .”\n\nThat flag became the official national flag of Ireland in 1937.\n\nFor his efforts at urging revolution and Irish independence, he was arrested for treason. After a trial and conviction, he was brought before the court, as a gallows was being built outside, and spoke, unbowed: “Judged by the law of England, I know this crime entails the penalty of death, but the history of Ireland explains this crime, and justifies it. Judged by that history, I am no criminal.” The court was not moved; it sentenced Meagher to death by hanging, then to be decapitated and his body to be cut into quarters. However, his sentence was commuted by Queen Victoria and he was ordered exiled to the British prison colony on Van Dieman’s Island (later to be known as Tasmania), on the other side of the world, off Australia, in 1849. Meagher, held as a prisoner on that island, married Catherine Bennett there, then escaped alone (she, as planned, was to head for Ireland, then they would reunite in New York) to the United States in 1852.\n\nHis fame had preceded him: immediately upon his arrival in New York City, he instantly was the most famous Irishman in America and was hailed as a leader of the Irish immigrant community. On the night after his arrival, 7,000 people gathered outside the home where he was having dinner, demanding that he address them. Flabbergasted, he obliged. For the next year he toured the country, giving wildly popular speeches on Irish and other matters, opposing the anti-immigrant Know Nothings as well as Catholic clerics. Meagher clubs sprang up across America. His wife, Catherine, died in 1854 in Waterford, while giving birth to their boy. Meagher practiced law in New York City—eloquently defending those accused of crimes before a jury was his specialty–and became a United States citizen. A Democrat, he believed slavery was an evil, but one that was a part of the Union: “It would be well if America could get rid of slavery. But we can’t, in our time, and should therefore confine our efforts to alleviating the evils that accompany it.” When the Civil War began, Meagher, ever-indebted to the country that allowed him to live free in it, chose to fight for the Union, and, in a series of eloquent speeches, urged Irish immigrants also to do so.\n\nHe recruited volunteers for the cause and joined the 69th New York State Militia, serving as a captain and acting major at the first big battle of the war, at Bull Run, Virginia. The 69th attacked Confederates on Henry Hill three times, but it was repulsed by artillery, with heavy losses. There Meagher’s horse was shot out from under him and he was knocked unconscious and almost captured. Soon thereafter, he mustered out with his company at New York City. In the winter of 1861-1862, he organized the Irish Brigade, intent on both fighting for the adopted country that had welcomed him and on training and giving battlefield experience to Irishmen who would, after this service, liberate Ireland.\n\nOn February 3, 1862, Meagher was commissioned brigadier general of United States Volunteers and given command of the Irish Brigade. Meagher led that brigade, almost 3,000 strong, many of whom had enlisted because of him, at numerous Virginia battles during the Peninsula Campaign of 1862, including Fair Oaks, Gaines’ Mill (where it was rushed to the front and covered the retreat of Major General Fitz John Porter’s Fifth Corps), Frazier’s Farm, and Malvern Hill (where his men engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the famed Louisiana Tigers—Irishmen also). After those battles, he went home on leave to recruit more Irishmen to replace the fallen; though the crowds still enthusiastically turned our by the thousands to hear him speak, Irish-immigrant opinion had changed, and, with mounting casualties and talk that the war had become an unpopular crusade to end slavery, recruiting was a hard go.\n\nHe returned to Virginia once again to lead the Irish Brigade. They fought at Second Bull Run in late August, 1862. At the Battle of Antietam, Maryland, on September 17, 1862, he led the attack at the Sunken Road, thereafter to be known as the Bloody Lane, and his horse was wounded and fell on him. Despite being concussed and carried off the field, he returned to action the next day. Reverend William Corby, chaplain of the Irish Brigade, was impressed with him: “General Meagher was more than an ordinary gentleman. He possessed high-toned sentiments and manners, and the bearing of a prince. He had a superior intellect, a liberal education, was a fine classical writer, and was a born orator. He was very witty.” On December 13, 1862, at Fredericksburg, Virginia, on orders from Major General Ambrose Burnside, commanding the Army of the Potomac, the Irish Brigade engaged in a suicidal attack on Confederates behind an elevated and fortified stone wall at Marye’s Heights. The men fought bravely but futilely: of the approximately 1,400 men of the Irish Brigade who went into action at Fredericksburg, 545 were either killed, wounded, or missing.\n\nMeagher, suffering from a wounded leg, then took sick leave and returned again to New York City to recruit replacements. However, many Irish-Americans had turned against the war, seeing themselves as cannon fodder; Meagher was unable to recruit as he had done before. He returned to his men at the front on February 18, 1863. Just days after he led the Irish Brigade into battle at Chancellorsville, at the end of April and early in May, 1863, after yet more casualties, and now with a brigade of only 340 men present for duty, and feeling that he and his soldiers were not be adequately supported by higher-ups, he tendered his resignation as commander of the men he had so proudly led, “what was once known as the Irish Brigade.”\n\nThough some criticized his performance in battle, alleging that he had gone into some battles drunk, he was reappointed a brigadier general in early 1864. He took charge of the district of Etowah, Georgia, was sent to the captured Confederate city, Savannah, Georgia, in January 1865, and mustered out there on May 15, 1865. During the election campaign of 1864, while still on duty, he gave speeches urging the re-election of President Abraham Lincoln—who had hosted him several times at the White House.\n\nAfter the War, Meagher was appointed the secretary of the Montana Territory and served as its acting governor. Vigilantes there, who were executing a murderous campaign, declared him their enemy. On July 1, 1867, he mysteriously disappeared from a riverboat anchored on the Missouri River at Fort Benton, Montana, either falling (drunk or otherwise by accident) or being pushed by an assassin. His body was never recovered.\n\nIn 1905, a grand equestrian statue of Thomas Meagher was unveiled in front of the state capitol in Helena, Montana. A Department of Veterans Affairs gravestone was dedicated to his memory in April, 2008, in the Green-Wood lot where his wife, Elizabeth Townsend Meagher (see), is interred with other members of the Townsend family. On July 1, 2017, the 150th anniversary of his disappearance, a granite base and bronze bust of him, sculpted by Michael Keropian and paid for by donors solicited by The Green-Wood Historic Fund and the Country Waterford Association of New York, were unveiled in the Townsend lot. His cenotaph is located in section 206, lot 30910.\n\nMEAKIM (or MEAKIN), ALEXANDER (1845-1904). Private, 37th Regiment, New York State National Guard, Company E. A native of New York City, Meakim served for three months with the 37th Regiment in 1862 and returned to the same company for 30 days in 1863. His obituary in the New York Sun, which confirms his Civil War service, notes his prominence in the business world and in Democratic Party politics. In 1884, Meakim organized the Business Men’s Democratic Club during Grover Cleveland’s first Presidential campaign. He was appointed an excise commissioner in 1889 by New York City Mayor Hugh Grant and served as as president of that board. However, his tenure was marked by controversy when he and two associates were indicted by the Reform Club officers alleging that the Excise Board was slow to act on a complaint about a violation of the Excise law on Election Day; the indictments were dismissed in 1898.\n\nAt the time of his death, he was the chief of the Bureau of Markets in the Comptroller’s Office, a position to which he was appointed in 1894. According to his obituary in the New York Herald, he was a member of the Lafayette Post #140 of the G.A.R., which he mustered into on October 4, 1889; his comrades were invited to attend his funeral. He last lived at 54 East 21st Street in Manhattan. Meakim died of paralysis at New York Hospital; he had previously suffered a stroke and cerebral hemorrhage.

Mease, a native of New York, was a merchant according to the 1850 census. During the Civil War, he enlisted as a private at New York City on October 1, 1861, and mustered immediately into Company B of the 12th New York. He was promoted to sergeant major on October 14, 1862, and transferred that day into the Field and Staff. Mease was promoted to second lieutenant on December 14, 1862, effective upon his transfer to Company E on February 9, 1863. He was dismissed on November 20, 1863, as per Special Order #402. Subsequently, he served with the 37th Regiment for 30 days in 1864. He last lived with his brother-in-law in Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn. According to his obituary in the New York Herald, he died after a lingering illness, listed as phthisis. Section 43, lot 3318.\n\nMEBUS, HENRY (1834-1917). Corporal, 2nd United States Light Artillery, Company L; private, 13th New York Heavy Artillery, Company M. A native of Werdenberg, Germany, and a gunsmith by trade, Mebus was 5’7″ tall with a fair complexion, brown hair and hazel hair. His first service began on February 9, 1854, when he enlisted and mustered into the 2nd United States Light Artillery. He re-enlisted on December 9, 1858, at Fort Riley, Kansas, and was discharged December 4, 1863, at Fort Monroe, Virginia.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Mebus enlisted at Persia, New York, and immediately mustered into the 13th Heavy Artillery on September 8, 1864. On June 28, 1865, he mustered out at Norfolk, Virginia. According to his obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, he was a member of the George C. Strong Post #534 of the G.A.R. Henry Mebus died of arteriosclerosis. Section 135, lot 14964, grave 45.\n\nMEEKER, CORNELIUS S. (or Z.) (1821-1905). Corporal, 2nd New York Heavy Artillery, Companies I and E. Meeker enlisted as a corporal on July 1, 1861, at New York City, and mustered into Company I of the 2nd New York Heavy Artillery on August 15. He re-enlisted on November 12, 1863, was wounded at Petersburg, Virginia, on June 17, 1864, transferred to Company E on June 27, 1865, and was discharged for disability from Ward Army Hospital at Newark, New Jersey, on August 19, 1865. He succumbed to acute lobar pneumonia. Section 48, lot 6228.\n\nMEEKER, EDWARD PERCY (1836-1914). Captain by brevet; first lieutenant, United States Navy Marine Corps. Meeker, a native of New Jersey, first served in the United States Navy as a captain’s clerk in 1859. At the onset of the Civil War, he was the flag officer’s clerk on the USS Minnesota, a ship that was part of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. He was commissioned second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on June 14, 1862 (after enlisting that day as a first lieutenant), was assigned to headquarters at Washington, D.C., that year, and then was at the New York Marine Barracks in 1863-64. On June 14, 1863, while on blockade duty off the North Carolina coast, he was officially promoted to second lieutenant on board the USS Colorado, and became a first lieutenant on November 17, 1864.\n\nMeeker was in command of a Marine Corps unit at the Battle of Fort Fisher, North Carolina, and, on January 14, 1865, was brevetted captain for “gallant and meritorious services at the attack upon Fort Fisher, 13, 14 and 15 January 1865.” He was in command of 150 United States Marines at the Battle of New Berne, North Carolina, when his unit was attacked by Confederate forces. He was ordered to hold his ground at all cost. When reinforcements arrived they found Meeker and two other marines alive. The remainder of his unit was decimated in this action and he was officially commended for bravery.\n\nRemaining in the Marine Corps after the Civil War, he was in the European Squadron from 1866-67, the Marine Barracks at Brooklyn in 1868, and at the Naval Station at Norfolk, Virginia, in 1869. Meeker was promoted to captain on November 17, 1877. He commanded a rescue detachment in 1892 that landed at La Guayra, Venezuela, and recovered the United States Consular General’s Office personnel held by rebel bandits. During the aforementioned action, several of his men got drunk and were disorderly. He was reprimanded by a court-martial and ordered to lose one year’s pay. After a full review of this case, Secretary of the Navy Benjamin F. Tracy (see) set aside the court-martial. Meeker was then put in command of all receiving ships at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. He was a recruiting officer and his last command was on the USS Chicago of the North Atlantic Squadron from 1892 until 1893. He retired from the United States Marines Corps on March 15 of that year after 30 years of continuous military service. His last address was 178 Hancock Street, Brooklyn. His death was caused by a carcinoma. Section 83, lot 1615.\n\nMEEKS, ALBERT VICTOR (1839-1889). Captain, 62nd New York Infantry, Company G; private, 7th Regiment, New York State Militia, Company H. A native New Yorker, Meeks was a son of Joseph W. Meeks, a master craftsman of furniture who had a store at 18 Vesey Street in Manhattan (see ad below). When Albert Meeks applied for a passport in 1859, he was 5′ 5½” tall with a high forehead, brown eyes, prominent nose, large mouth, auburn hair, thin face and florid complexion. In 1860, he graduated from the University of the City of New York’s Law School.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Albert Meeks served in the first activation of the 7th Regiment from April 18 to June 3, 1861. He re-enlisted at New York City as a captain on June 4, and was commissioned into the 62nd New York on June 30. After resigning on December 2 of that year, his resignation was revoked the next day. He fought at the Battle of Williamsburg, Virginia, on May 5, 1862, and at Fair Oaks, Virginia, on May 31-June 1 (where he was wounded), before his resignation and discharge on August 11, 1862.\n\nThe 1889 New York City Directory states that was employed in real estate at 30 Vesey Street in Manhattan. He was a member of the Lafayette Post #140 of the G.A.R. As per his obituary in the New York Herald, he was a Freemason; members of his lodge were invited to attend his funeral at his Manhattan residence. Albert was the brother of Edwin Meeks (see). He last resided at 50 East 83rd Street in New York City but died of cardiac dropsy in Bayshore, Long Island. Section 99, lot 2592.\n\nMEEKS, EDWIN BARTLETT (1841-1926). Quartermaster, 55th Regiment, New York State National Guard. Meeks was a son of Joseph W. Meeks, a master craftsman of furniture whose family history in New York City dates to colonial times. The family had a furniture store at 18 Vesey Street that was world renowned for its bureaus, armoires, writing tables, etc. Its hallmark was the Meeks name stenciled in black on the underside of the furniture.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Edwin Meeks enlisted at New York City on June 24, 1863, was commissioned into the Field and Staff of the 55th Regiments as quartermaster the next day, and mustered out on July 27, 1863, at New York City. The 1879 New York City Directory and the 1880 census indicate he was an estate agent. When he mustered into the Lafayette Post #140 of the G.A.R. on February 15, 1889, he was living in Islip, Long Island, and listed his occupation as capitalist. On February 11, 1908, an article in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported on the family dispute over the unsettled estate of Joseph Meeks, his father and furniture magnate whose holdings were valued at $1,500,000. The father, a resident of Suffolk County, died in 1878 at age 97, and Edwin was the executor of the complicated estate. Although family members, including Edwin’s daughters, challenged Edwin’s handling of the estate, the court found no evidence of any impropriety. At the time the Eagle article was printed, Joseph Meeks had real estate holdings in Manhattan worth $800,000 that were not yet settled.\n\nWhen Edwin Meeks applied for a passport in 1910, he identified his occupation as “gentleman.” He was 5′ 7½” tall with brownish-gray eyes, a full nose, broad forehead, dark and slightly gray hair, ruddy complexion and oval face. Edwin and Albert Meeks (see) were brothers. His last residence was on East 46th Street in Manhattan. He died of a pulmonary embolism. Section 99, lot 2592.\n\nMEEKS, LEWIS (or LOUIS) C. (1830-1896). First sergeant, 11th New York Infantry, Company E. Meeks, a native New Yorker, was a fire warden in 1857. During the Civil War, he enlisted at New York City on April 21, 1861, as a first sergeant, and mustered into the 11th New York on May 7. The 11th New York was drawn from the ranks of New York’s volunteer firefighters and was also known as the Ellsworth Zouaves, First Fire Zouaves, First Regiment New York Zouaves, and the U.S. National Guards. The regiment was among the first to be in the thick of battle and suffered extensive casualties at First Bull Run, Virginia, on July 21, 1861, during the fighting on Henry House Hill and while serving as the rear guard for the retreating Union Army. Meeks was among the wounded there. He was reduced to the rank of sergeant on September 14, 1861, for physical disability, then to private on an unspecified date, and was discharged for disability on November 18, 1861.\n\nIn 1870, Meeks applied for and received an invalid pension, certificate 109,427. The 1870 census reports that he was a caulker. On October 18, 1874, the New York Herald printed an obituary noting the sudden death of his only son, John Reeves Meeks, who was four years and nine months old. He is listed as a caulker in the 1888 and 1892 New York City Directories. The Veterans Census of 1890 confirms his Civil War service and discharge for disability. Meeks last resided at 362 Front Street in Manhattan. His death was caused by an abscess of the heart. Jane Meeks, who is interred with him, applied for and received a widow’s pension in 1896, certificate 438,309. Section 70, lot 10119, grave 4.\n\nMEEKS, WILLIAM (1822-1868). Corporal, 53rd New York Infantry, Company G. Meeks, who was born in New York City, enlisted there as a corporal on October 12, 1861. He mustered into the 53rd New York two days later, and was reduced in rank to private on December 31, 1861. He mustered out on March 21, 1862, at Washington, D.C. He died at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. Section 72, lot 5056.\n\nMEEKS, WILLIAM HENRY (1824-1875). First lieutenant, 6th Regiment, New York State Militia, Companies D and A. Meeks enlisted at New York City as a first sergeant on April 19, 1861. On May 15, 1861, he mustered into Company D of the 6th New York State Militia. He received a promotion to first lieutenant on June 9, 1861, was transferred on that day to Company A, and mustered out on July 31, 1861, at New York City. He last lived on East 9th Street in Manhattan. Meeks succumbed to Bright’s disease. Section 80, lot 3834.\n\nMEEKS, WILLIAM L. (1840-1915). According to his obituary in the Red Bank Register, Meeks, who was born in New York, was a Civil War veteran. A member of the New York City Fire Department, he was made captain when the department made the transition from volunteer to paid public service. He also was superintendent of the National City Bank Building in New York City. After his retirement in 1893, Meeks moved to Ocean Grove, New Jersey. He last lived in Ocean Grove where he died from chronic nephritis. Section 92, lot 8389.\n\nMEGRUE, CONDUCE (or CANDUCE) GATCH (1830-1890). Major, 4th Ohio Cavalry, Company B. After enlisting as a captain on August 25, 1861, Megrue was commissioned into Company B of the 4th Ohio Cavalry on September 24. The next year, he was promoted to major on September 16 and transferred that day to the Field and Staff. He resigned on March 2, 1863.\n\nOn December 18, 1868, President Andrew Johnson appointed Megrue assessor of internal revenue for the 2nd District of Ohio. An article on November 17, 1875, in the New York Herald noted Megrue’s involvement in the Whiskey Ring, a scandal that involved a conspiracy of government agents, politicians, whiskey distillers and distributors. The scandal embarrassed the administration of President Ulysses S. Grant by highlighting corruption in the Republican Party at that time. Megrue, who was indicted for bribery and netted $60,000 from the scheme, organized the plot from his base in Cincinnati working with others in St. Louis, Missouri. He called upon five distillery firms, assured them that the government could not harm them, and collected on average $9,000 weekly from each distillery which was then distributed among the conspirators. The scheme, which began in 1871, resulted in the siphoning off of millions of dollars in federal taxes on liquor.\n\nAn article in The New York Times on November 20, 1875, reported that Megrue had issued a statement that neither General Orville E. Babcock, the private secretary to President Grant, nor any other officials or citizens of Washington “have to my knowledge either directly or indirectly, been connected in any way with the Ring, with the exception of William O. Avery. I make this statement in simple justice to any of the parties named.” Megrue testified that Avery, the chief clerk of the Internal Revenue Bureau at Washington, was given $100 per week at first, then $300 per week. Megrue pleaded guilty to previous knowledge of the frauds and failure to report them; he was sentenced to jail for six months and a fine of $5,000.00.\n\nSubsequently, Megrue moved to New York City where he became a successful businessman. According to his 1879 passport application, he was 5′ 9″ tall with dark eyes, dark hair, a dark complexion, oval face, high forehead, large mouth and chin and medium nose. The 1882 New York City Directory lists him as a broker. In late 1883, he ventured to London where he promoted American enterprises and was well known among American businessmen in London. As per his obituary in The Sun, which confirms his Civil War service, he died at the Cliftonville Hotel in Margate, England, while on holiday. His death was attributed to heart disease. However, an article on May 27, 1890, in the Daily Colonist, a newspaper from Victoria, British Columbia, calls his death a mystery and alleged that Megrue died “under peculiar circumstances” after checking into the hotel with a woman other than his wife. That article states that the medical attendant refused to write “heart disease” as the cause of death on the death certificate. His personal estate in London was valued at more than 879 pounds. Megrue’s last residence was at 256 West 57th Street in Manhattan. Anna Megrue applied for and received a widow’s pension in 1891, certificate 342,981. Section 146, lot 25458.\n\nMEHL, ALBERT J. (1834-1888). Sergeant, 55th New York Infantry, Company H; private, 38th New York Infantry, Company H. Originally from Germany, Mehl enlisted as a private at Staten Island on August 1, 1861, and mustered into the 55th New York on August 28. He was promoted to sergeant on September 7, 1861, reduced to the rank of private on October 1, 1862, and was transferred into the 38th New York on December 21, 1862. He was discharged on an unknown date. He last lived at 203 West 30th Street in Manhattan. His death was attributed to cancer. Section 189, lot 19155.\n\nMEHLER, JOSEPH (1845-1885). Sergeant, 61st New York Infantry, Company G; corporal, 57th New York Infantry, Company A. A native of New York City (although one record says Germany), Mehler enlisted as a private on September 18, 1861, at New York City, mustered into the 57th the next day, and was promoted to corporal on December 29, 1861. As per his muster roll, he was a painter who was 5′ 5″ tall with brown eyes, light hair and a light complexion. He was transferred to the 61st New York on December 20, 1864. He entered the 61st as a private, rose to the rank of sergeant on or about May 30, 1865, and mustered out on July 14, 1865, at Washington, D.C. On January 17, 1882, he mustered into the John Sedgwick Post #186 of the G.A.R. He noted that he was a cigar packer in his biographical sketch. The 1884 New York City Directory lists Mehler as a cigarmaker (segarmaker). A resident of 118 Essex Street in Manhattan, he died after an accidental fall. Section 115, lot 11193, grave 355.\n\nMEHRER, CHARLES W. (1839-1914). Corporal, 8th Regiment, New York State Militia, Company E. Mehrer was born in Brooklyn. In his first tour of duty, he enlisted as a private on April 21, 1861, and took part in the Battles of Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia); Relay House, Maryland; and Bull Run, Virginia. When his unit was reactivated a year later as part of the 8th National Guard, he re-enlisted and mustered in as a corporal in the same company on May 29, 1862, and mustered out after three months on September 10. Subsequently, he fought under General George McClellan and then, in June 1863, he joined the United States Pioneer and Construction Corps and served under Generals Joseph Hooker and William T. Sherman. He participated in the battles of Sherman’s March to the Sea, receiving recognition from Sherman for his bravery at the Battle of Snake Creek Gap, Georgia. Mehrer was discharged in November 1864 and appointed in December 1864 to a clerkship at the United States Customs House where he worked for forty years.\n\nHis obituary in the Brooklyn Standard Union, which confirms his Civil War service, notes that he was one of the oldest employees in the Appraiser’s Department of the New York Custom House. He was also a hotel-keeper in Newburgh, New York. Active in political life, his obituary states that he managed the campaign of Chester A. Arthur for vice-president in 1880 and also that of Levi P. Morton (Benjamin Harrison’s vice-president) in 1888. An article in the New York Herald on October 7, 1883, describes a controversial incident in Mehrer’s work life. Apparently, Mehrer was being paid $2,000 as an examiner in the Appraiser’s Office but was only doing clerical work. His new boss thought that salary was excessive for the work Mehrer was doing and reduced it to $1,400. Mehrer became enraged, used profane language and acted in an abusive manner when he learned of the demotion. He then was dismissed for “gross and violent insubordination.” Mehrer appealed the dismissal to the Secretary of the Treasury and the Civil Service Commission and was apparently reinstated.\n\nIn 1889, he applied for and was granted an invalid pension, certificate 568,020. The 1890 Veterans Census confirms his Civil War service. According to his obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, he was a member of the Phil Kearny Post #8 of the G.A.R. He was a member of the Eighth Regiment Veteran Association, the Veteran Firemen’s Association of New York, the “Amen Corner” of the Fifth Avenue Hotel, the Freemasons, and the Elks. He las"
