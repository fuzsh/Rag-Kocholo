        "text": "This is potentially controversial, and may require a more detailed write up at some point, but pound for pound, I’d argue Daredevil has the most consistently excellent modern solo series of any Marvel hero. When you think about the greats that have blessed Matt Murdock with all time great, era defining runs (Miller, Nocenti, Bendis, Waid) it’s downright startling.\n\nAs Daredevil’s Netflix series renewed interest, finally giving us the savior of Hell’s Kitchen we’ve been waiting for, you can read up on the essential Daredevil comics from his origin to present day.\n\nI’d also recommend our Punisher and Elektra reading orders for those seeking even more comics!\n\nWithout further ado: the Daredevil reading order.\n\nI) Daredevil’s Origins\n\nYou’ll undoubtedly note that my early Daredevil Origins section is fairly sparse. Nothing against the hornhead’s 60’s origins, but I’m not going to lie: most readers will want to get the origins and jump ahead to the Frank Miller era that defines the character we see today.\n\nThe first issue of Daredevil impressively tackles all of the familiar Daredevil origin beats we know and love. It’s impressive just how much of Matt Murdock’s beginnings are captured in that one issue, as well as the number of Daredevil foes we quickly see introduced in those first 11 issues (The Owl! Purple Man! Stilt Man!!!).\n\nDaredevil, Vol. 1 (Marvel Masterworks)\n\nDaredevil #1 – #11\n\nDaredevil: Battlin’ Jack Murdock\n\n#1 – #4\n\nIt’s worth noting that the four issue Battlin’ Jack Murdock miniseries was published in 2007. Nonetheless, it’s all flashback, and works best as some surprisingly touching fill-in detail surrounding Daredevil’s origins.\n\nII) Daredevil: The Frank Miller Era\n\nFrank Miller’s run on Daredevil lasted for less than fifty issues (plus two trades), and yet it it introduced virtually everything we know about the character today. The importance of his dad, the way his powers work, his involvement with characters like Stick, Elektra, the Kingpin, Bullseye, and the Hand. It’s all here. (Side note: This is also where Frank got a lot of his ideas for his iconic run on Batman.)\n\nDaredevil by Frank Miller & Klaus Janson Omnibus\n\nDaredevil #158 – #191\n\nDaredevil: Love and War (Marvel Graphic Novel)\n\nOriginal Graphic Novel\n\nDaredevil: Born Again\n\nDaredevil #226 – #233\n\nDaredevil: The Man Without Fear\n\n#1 – #5 (1993)\n\nII Redux) Ann Nocenti and Joe Kelly Take Daredevil From the Late 80’s Through the 1990’s\n\nDaredevil Epic Collection: A Touch of Typhoid\n\nCollects: Daredevil #253 to #270\n\nCovers a good chunk of Ann Nocenti’s run on Daredevil, introducing Daredevil villain Typhoid Mary.\n\nDaredevil: The Fall of the Kingpin\n\nCollects: Daredevil #297 to #300\n\nThe follow-up to Daredevil: Born Again.\n\nDaredevil Epic Collection: Fall From Grace\n\nCollects: Daredevil #319 to #322\n\nI’m not a Fall From Grace fan, but it does come up as one of the more well known Daredevil and Elektra storylines of the mid-90’s.\n\nDaredevil Epic Collection: Widow’s Kiss\n\nCollects: Daredevil #365 to #380, Daredevil/Deadpool Annual ’97\n\nJoe Kelly is most well known for his 1997 kickoff to Deadpool (DD and Deadpool even crossed over for an annual issue!), but many people forget he was also writing one of the last Daredevil runs before the series rebooted with Marvel Knights.\n\nIII) Daredevil in the 2000’s: Kevin Smith and Marvel Knights\n\nThis, more than Punisher, was what launched Marvel Knights. It was mature and really explored Matt’s faith and expanding off that by delving into why he is so drawn to what’s dark and mysterious in the world.\n\nBringing Smith on was really controversial at the time as he was known as a comic fan, not so much a writer. But he surprised a lot of people with this run and there are still parts of it that are surprisingly good. Unfortunately, there are also some Kevin Smith tropes in here that don’t age quite so gracefully. Like his terrible handling of Karen Page and his obsession with Bullseye.\n\nDaredevil: Guardian Devil\n\nDaredevil #1 – #8\n\nDaredevil, Vol. 1: Yellow\n\n#1 – #5\n\nPunisher Vol 1: Welcome Back Frank\n\nCollects: Punisher #1 to #12\n\nThis is not the first time Punisher and Daredevil have crossed paths, but for my money, it is the definitive event. The first time on paper we see the lengths to which they’ll go… and just how much Frank respects Matt.This brief encounter sets up at least three future arcs — entire storylines — for Daredevil comics and should be considered essential reading.\n\nMarvel Knights (Vol. 1)\n\n#1 – #15\n\nSpider-Man / Daredevil\n\n#1\n\nDaredevil Vol. 2: Parts of a Hole\n\nDaredevil #9 – #15\n\nIV) Daredevil: The Bendis & Maleev Era\n\nIf you’re going to read only one run on Daredevil, this might be the best place to start. Because this is not a Daredevil book… this is a Matt Murdock book, and it is incredible. Bendis absolutely turns Murdock’s life upside-down and keeps him off-balance the entire arc. For a decade of real time. (It’s amazing Marvel let him do it in the first place.) The end result is that the whole run both builds on continuity without requiring it for reading. Instead, you just build a life with this character while his falls apart.\n\nDaredevil by Brian Michael Bendis & Alex Maleev Ultimate Collection – Book 1\n\nDaredevil #16-19 & #26-40\n\nElektra By Greg Rucka Ultimate Collection\n\nElektra #1 – #22\n\nTechnically, Elektra shows up in Daredevil’s solo series prior to the completion of issue #40 (the completion of Bendis and Maleev’s book 1). If you really want, you could start reading Elektra around Daredevil #30. Personally, I’d just fill in the solo Elektra if you’re so inclined.\n\nKingpin\n\n#1 – #6\n\nDaredevil by Brian Michael Bendis & Alex Maleev Ultimate Collection – Book 2\n\nDaredevil #41 – #50 & #56 – #60\n\nDaredevil / Echo: Vision Quest\n\nDaredevil #51-55\n\nDaredevil 2099\n\n#1\n\nWritten by the Walking Dead’s Robert Kirkman!\n\nElektra: The Hand\n\n#1 – #5\n\nJust to put this in perspective, the series was written during the Elektra solo movie years. I know, I tried to forget as well, but our past is always with us.\n\nBullseye: Greatest Hits\n\n#1 – #5\n\nDaredevil: Father\n\n#1 – #6\n\nDaredevil by Brian Michael Bendis & Alex Maleev Ultimate Collection – Book 3\n\nDaredevil #66-81, What If Karen Page Had Lived? #1 (Oct 2004 – Jan 2006)\n\nDaredevil vs. Punisher: Means & Ends\n\n#1 – #6\n\nDaredevil: Redemption\n\n#1 – #5\n\nV) Daredevil: The Brubaker & Lark Era\n\nEd Brubaker does his best picking up the pieces of what Bendis had left for him. Brubaker does an admirable job adding black humor to the book and giving Daredevil allies at a time he feels his most alone.\n\nDaredevil By Ed Brubaker & Michael Lark Ultimate Collection – Book 1\n\nDaredevil #82 – #93 (through Jan 2007)\n\nI’d note that Civil War takes place during this Brubaker and Lark run. Helps explain the dueling Daredevils.\n\nDaredevil by Ed Brubaker & Michael Lark Ultimate Collection – Book 2\n\nDaredevil #94 – #105 (through Feb 2008)\n\nDaredevil by Ed Brubaker & Michael Lark Ultimate Collection Book 3\n\nDaredevil #106 – #119 & #500 (through Aug 2009)\n\nDaredevil & Captain America: Dead on Arrival\n\n#1\n\nBlood of the Tarantula\n\n#1\n\nDaredevil Noir\n\n#1 – #4\n\nVI) Shadowland\n\nIf we’re being generous, Shadowland was meant to elevate Marvel’s “street level” heroes. It’s the story of what would happen if Matt Murdock took control of the hand, and how it would impact the community. But really, if we’re being honest, Shadowland exists to “fix” what Bendis did with the character so that Netflix could have TV shows about these heroes. Naturally, that “fix” wasn’t taken well by fans, and so we don’t talk much about “SECRET WAR: NETWORK BOARDROOM MEETING.”\n\nDaredevil: The Devil’s Hand\n\nDaredevil: Dark Days & Daredevil #501-507\n\nDaredvil: Cage Match\n\n#1\n\nShadowland\n\nFor the full event issue by issue guide, see the Shadowland reading order (July 2010 – Dec 2010)\n\nDaredevil: Black and White\n\n#1\n\nAs far as I can tell, this issue is out of continuity. Potentially fun read, though.\n\nDaredevil: Reborn\n\n#1 – #4\n\nVII) Daredevil: The Mark Waid & Marvel NOW! Era\n\nCaptain America inspires, Spider-Man hopes, Deadpool memes, Daredevil suffers. Suffering has been the emotional core of the Daredevil book ever since Frank Miller rescued him from the ash heap. His catholic guilt tormented him. His body betrayed him. His loved ones were hurt because of him. His whole life was a disaster, at all times. That is until Mark Waid got a hold of him.\n\nWaid took a lot out of those early, pre-Miller books and built a Matt Murdock who could struggle with him demons… and win. Best of all, this is a decision within the comic. Murdock makes the choice to see the light. But is it an act? Is it just him running away from his problems?\n\nDaredevil by Mark Waid, Vol. 1\n\nDaredevil #1-10, 10.1; Amazing Spider -Man 677 (July 2011 – March 2012)\n\nDaredevil by Mark Waid Volume 2\n\nDaredevil #11 – #21, Avenging Spider-Man #6, Punisher #10 (Omega Effect Tie-Ins)\n\nDaredevil by Mark Waid Volume 3\n\nDaredevil #22 – #36\n\nDaredevil: Dark Knights\n\n#1 – #8\n\nDaredevil Volume 1: Devil at Bay\n\nDaredevil #1 – #5, 1.5, .1\n\nDaredevil Volume 2: West-Case Scenerio\n\nDaredevil #6 to #10\n\nSuperior Iron Man Volume 1: Infamous\n\nSuperior Iron Man #1 – #5\n\nNot a typo.
