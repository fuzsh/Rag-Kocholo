        "text": "So lately I've been enjoying a lot of manga—namely One Piece, but there are others I like too, like Undead Unluck—and so I says to myself, \"Hey, X-Men's kind of hot right now—maybe I should hyperfixate on that for a bit!\" So I download the Marvel Unlimited app and try reading Johnathan Hickman's run (I've heard it's phenomenal), and…\n\nI'm going to be honest, I have no idea what the fuck is going on.\n\nLike, I know these characters—I've seen the movies and the shows, and I've even read a few comics like Frank Miller's Wolverine miniseries (I used to like him until I found out he was a libertarian). However, I don't really have the framing for why things are happening, nor do I really understand the context for these events. Why are they on Krakoa now? Why can Charles walk? Why does he look so fucking cool with that X helmet? It's all just lost on me.\n\nSo I'm like, \"Huh, maybe I should read some classic X-Men?\" After all, I've always heard about how Chris Claremont's run was legendary and pretty much set the framework for modern X-Men, as well as all the 90's stuff I loved. So I go to read it, and it's just… dense. I've read older comics before, namely Crisis on Infinite Earths (I was a DC diehard until the New 52 killed my interest in comics entirely), and had forgotten how wordy older comics were. Like, jeez, this is practically a novel with pictures. It's not bad, but idk if I can get into it.\n\nSo yeah, where do I start with X-Men? My free trial of Marvel Unlimited lapsed, so I'm a few bucks in the hole regardless.\n\nHickman's Krakoa stuff definitely requires some background knowledge to really wrap your head around. Cosmonaut Variety Hour has a pretty decent video on where to get started if you've got the time. I personally started with Morrison's New X-Men a decade+ ago and found that an easy enough place to start having grown up on the '92 cartoon and the Fox movies. Hopefully this is a helpful watch!\n\n- YouTube\n\nEnjoy the videos and music you love, upload original content, and share it all with friends, family, and the world on YouTube.\n\n*edit: sorry I'm new to this and trying to figure out the embed...\n\nIf Claremont's run aint working for you (understandable) you can read the X-Men Grand Design series. It's basically a cliffnote version of the 60s and 70s - 80s Claremont era Uncanny X-Men.\n\nFor the modern era, start with New X-men 114 by Grant Morrison. Follow that up with Astonishing X-Men by Josh Whedon (yes, really).\n\nI also recommend the Cosmonaut Variety Video for greater details. Like where to stop, what stories after Astonishing, what side stories to check out, etc.\n\nThanks, y'all! I'm already subscribed to him, so I'll check his vids out!\n\nStart at 2006 Civil War and go from there. That's how I got up to speed and I didn't feel lost after being out of the loop for almost 10 years\n\nYeah, that's not a bad idea. I actually read some of Civil War as it was coming out, so I should probably finish it.\n\nX-Men: Grand Design is the easiest onboarding tool for a sprawling franchise ever, I think. It's one book and it will get you caught up on everything from launch in the 60s up to the very first part of the 90s. If you don't know where to start or what you want to read, that will give you the broad strokes on the first few decades, and then if you want to go back, you can pick and choose from what parts seemed the most interesting.\n\nOkay, yeah, that sounds like a great spot to start.\n\nPeople will probably post a huge article with flowcharts of reading orders going back decades but tbh it's just easy to start at the beginning of a new creators run and go from there. Sure you may be lost by a reference to something that happened long before but that's just comics in general. IMO mainstream comics are kinda like soap operas in a way. The story just keeps going on the last 50+ years. Jumping into a random episode of Young and the Restless you'll probably be lost a little at first but you'll catch up after an episode or two. Same way with comics really.\n\nThere are of course creator runs from the previous decades you can dive into randomly that people will recommend. If you're wanting to just \"get into\" X-men or any specific Marvel/DC character there really isn't anything wrong with just starting at the beginning of the current arc and going from there. People can always go back and read some earlier arcs if they want to fill in gaps or like a specific creator. Not you specifically but I feel like a lot of folks make it more complicated than it really should be. I've just randomly started reading certain chars over the years (X-men, Batman, Daredevil, Cap, etc) and never felt like I was super lost just jumping in where it was going.\n\nI recommend starting with God Loves, Man Kills from 1982, it was originally supposed to be a standalone graphic novel outside of the regular continuity, it's a relatively quick read and good introduction to the themes of X-Men. Then I'd jump to Grant Morrison's New X-Men, the 2001 series issues #114-154.\n\nI've heard good things about God Loves, Man Kills. Also, what a baller fucking title. I do also love me some Grant Morrison. Love their work.\n\nPeople will probably post a huge article with flowcharts of reading orders going back decades but tbh it's just easy to start at the beginning of a new creators run and go from there.

I've just randomly started reading certain chars over the years (X-men, Batman, Daredevil, Cap, etc) and never felt like I was super lost just jumping in where it was going.\n\nYeah, I guess for me it's just a time thing. When I was younger I'd just jump in and read everything like you said, but nowadays I need some guidance lol\n\nX-Men: Grand Design is the easiest onboarding tool for a sprawling franchise ever, I think. It's one book and it will get you caught up on everything from launch in the 60s up to the very first part of the 90s. If you don't know where to start or what you want to read, that will give you the broad strokes on the first few decades, and then if you want to go back, you can pick and choose from what parts seemed the most interesting.\n\nGrand Design was written by a nonce who killed himself after the allegations were made public, I'd find it difficult to recommend at this point.\n\nSo lately I've been enjoying a lot of manga—namely One Piece, but there are others I like too, like Undead Unluck—and so I says to myself, \"Hey, X-Men's kind of hot right now—maybe I should hyperfixate on that for a bit!\" So I download the Marvel Unlimited app and try reading Johnathan Hickman's run (I've heard it's phenomenal), and…\n\nI'm going to be honest, I have no idea what the fuck is going on.\n\nI don't know how much of Hickman's Xmen you read but House of X/Powers of X is supposed to be deliberately disorienting to start with. It throws you in with Krakoa already existing as a nation and fills in the blanks as the book progresses. In regards to Xavier walking, he's been able to walk in comics for longer than he was in a wheelchair.\n\nThe sacred rule of American comics is, read whatever character you're interested in and when you find a story you like, or artist you like just follow that creatives path, don't worry about the \"everything,\" of it all. Under different creators characters can and will change, they may not seem recognizable from one run to another.\n\nClaremont is a great place to start, but Claremont's run isn't one easily defined story, but arguably four-five larger over arching stories. This work also looms largest in X-Men TAS/'97\n\nMost essential is the Phoenix/Dark Phoenix saga, I'd even go so far to say is one could even skip the initial Phoenix Saga and just go straight into the Dark Phoenix, (start with Uncanny X-Men 125-138) but I personally think Giant Size X-Men 1, Uncanny X-Men 94-138 is a fine starting point, has a lot of fun stories and is good intro into the x-men without overwhelming the reader. Just keep in mind the old rule of comic writing is that any time a character appeared on page, they have a few panels to state their name and their powers, and then recap the plot and everyone's central motivations.\n\nThese kind of narrative ticks leave older stories exposition heavy and can slow things down for modern readers, but the trick there is to just glaze over all of the exposition, kick back a bit and enjoy the art on the page.\n\nFrom there, honestly there's nothing wrong with jumping around. I find myself reading some form of X-Men most of the time, but it's from one era to the next. I just finished Zen Wells's New Mutants, before that, I did the whole \"Outback Era\" reread. I've read like 90% of printed mutant comics at this point of my life, and I'm still discovering and rediscovering things I like (and dislike)\n\nOther Easy Runs for new readers are:\n\nGrant Morrison's New X-Men\n\nHickman's HOX/POX\n\nJason Aaron's Wolverine and the X-Men\n\nBrian Michael Bendis- All New X-Men\n\npopular entries I'd recommend new readers avoid\n\nX-Men Grand Designs- Piskor's documentarian approach to x-men history is interesting at least initially but he begins (rather quickly) editorializing history for no benefit to the story he's telling or the characters and cannon of x-men itself. it's a fine read, but I think makes more problems than it solves. And yeah as other's have mentioned his problematic dealings with the world this year just make it hard to get into his stuff.\n\nX-Men by Josh Whedon, phew boy do these books look great, but Whedon's writing doesn't do much for me and won't beat 2024 \"MCU Joke\" allegations. as a die hard x-men fan it just feels mean spirited, but I won't spoil it, just not my favourite X-Men comics and I resent it's popularity (lol)\n\nAlmost anything with the words \"Scott Lobdell\" on the cover. I'm not kidding, you can read Generation X (for the Bachalo art alone) but nothing else. Unfortunately Lobdell was Marvels answer to Chris Claremont in the 90's and he's all over, everything. and it's all bad, as close to unreadable as it gets.\n\nUnpopular Entries in the Mutant Corner of Marvel that are great and I'd recommend.\n\nX-Statix/X-Force by Milligan and Allred\n\nUncanny X-Force- By Rick Remender and a ton of amazing artists.\n\nNew Mutants by Zen Wells\n\nAlmost any mutant book by Craig Kyle and Chris Yost"
