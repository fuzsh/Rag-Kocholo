And here, you can see them throwing punches in the style of Batman and Superman's fight from Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns.\n\nArtist Butcher Billy cooked up this mashup of The Dark Knight Returns and Marvel's Civil War. He lets both Cap and Iron Man take on the Batman role, with Steve getting in a solid punch, echoing this panel:\n\nYou can see more of Butcher Billy's artwork at Behance and Tumblr, and check out his Society6 and Redbubble shops."
