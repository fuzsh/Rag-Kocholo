        "text": "Lucky Bag\n\nFrom the 1939 Lucky Bag:\n\nLoss\n\nFrank was lost while piloting a F4F-4 Wildcat fighter of Fighting Squadron (VF) 10, operating from USS Enterprise (CV 6), on October 25, 1942.\n\nFrom naval aviation historian Richard Leonard via email on July 17, 2018:\n\nFrank Donald \"Don\" Miller (82652) - VF-10 USS Enterprise. Not killed in action. As darkness fell, while returning from a no-contact strike, Battle of Santa Cruz, his F4F lost power about 40 miles NW of TF-61 and fell out of formation on the evening of 10/26/1942. His plane was seen to hit the water and he was observed to bail out prior, but he was never recovered.\n\nOther Information\n\nHis wife was listed as next of kin.\n\nFrank has a memory marker in Kansas.\n\nPhotographs\n\nFrom the Lucky Bag\n\nMemorial Hall Error?\n\nFrank is not listed on the killed in action panel in the front of Memorial Hall. While not an obvious error, inclusion on the panel for crashes like this (incidental to combat flights) has been inconsistent across WWII, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.\n\nNavy Directories & Officer Registers\n\nThe \"Register of Commissioned and Warrant Officers of the United States Navy and Marine Corps\" was published annually from 1815 through at least the 1970s; it provided rank, command or station, and occasionally billet until the beginning of World War II when command/station was no longer included. Scanned copies were reviewed and data entered from the mid-1840s through 1922, when more-frequent Navy Directories were available.\n\nThe Navy Directory was a publication that provided information on the command, billet, and rank of every active and retired naval officer. Single editions have been found online from January 1915 and March 1918, and then from three to six editions per year from 1923 through 1940; the final edition is from April 1941.\n\nThe entries in both series of documents are sometimes cryptic and confusing. They are often inconsistent, even within an edition, with the name of commands; this is especially true for aviation squadrons in the 1920s and early 1930s.\n\nAlumni listed at the same command may or may not have had significant interactions; they could have shared a stateroom or workspace, stood many hours of watch togetherâ€¦ or, especially at the larger commands, they might not have known each other at all. The information provides the opportunity to draw connections that are otherwise invisible, though, and gives a fuller view of the professional experiences of these alumni in Memorial Hall."
