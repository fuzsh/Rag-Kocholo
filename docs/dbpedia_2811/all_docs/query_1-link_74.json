        "text": "American comic creator Frank Miller has never shied away from controversy. He's arranged Superman and Wonder Woman in a titanic sexual clinch, had Batman beat Superman to within an inch of his life, and sent superheroes to \"kick al-Qaida's ass\".\n\nNow the 54-year-old whose work has been brought to the big screen in the shape of the movies Sin City and 300 has enraged the anti-capitalist Occupy movement by branding those who have erected tented communities at the heart of the west's financial districts \"a pack of louts, thieves and rapists\".\n\nIn a post on his blog, Frank Miller Ink, Miller writes an open letter to the protesters. Entitled Anarchy, it begins \"Everybody's been too damn polite about this nonsense\" and then continues:\n\nThe \"Occupy\" movement, whether displaying itself on Wall Street or in the streets of Oakland (which has, with unspeakable cowardice, embraced it) is anything but an exercise of our blessed First Amendment. \"Occupy\" is nothing but a pack of louts, thieves, and rapists, an unruly mob, fed by Woodstock-era nostalgia and putrid false righteousness. These clowns can do nothing but harm America.\n\n'Occupy' is nothing short of a clumsy, poorly-expressed attempt at anarchy, to the extent that the \"movement\" – HAH! Some \"movement\", except if the word \"bowel\" is attached – is anything more than an ugly fashion statement by a bunch of iPhone, iPad wielding spoiled brats who should stop getting in the way of working people and find jobs for themselves.\n\nThis is no popular uprising. This is garbage. And goodness knows they're spewing their garbage – both politically and physically – every which way they can find.\n\nWake up, pond scum. America is at war against a ruthless enemy.\n\nMaybe, between bouts of self-pity and all the other tasty tidbits of narcissism you've been served up in your sheltered, comfy little worlds, you've heard terms like al-Qaida and Islamicism.\n\nUnsurprisingly, there's been quite a bit of reaction. \"Well, well,\" responded author David Brin on his blog. \"I've been fuming silently at Frank Miller for years. The time's come, so get ready for steam! Because the screech that you just read – Miller's attack on young citizens, clumsily feeling their way ahead toward saving their country – is only the latest example of Frank's astonishing agenda. One that really needs exposure to light.\"\n\nOther comics industry figures were equally excoriating. \"Frank Miller is what happens when fear overrides rational thought,\" tweeted Tim Seeley. Belfast-based PJ Holden wrote: \"Frank Miller is really working that right wing loon persona\" and Gail Simone said the link to Miller's blog was great, \"if you like absolute bullshit.\"\n\nAt first glance, Miller's rant comes as something of a surprise. Is this really the same Frank Miller speaking who, in his 1987 comic Batman: Year One, had his fledgling superhero visit a gathering of Gotham's wealthy and inform them: \"You've eaten Gotham's wealth. Its spirit. Your feast is nearly over. From this moment on, none of you are safe\"?\n\nLater, in his graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns (which reinvented the comics scene in the 1980s along with Alan Moore's Watchmen) Miller portrayed an aged Batman gone deep underground, disgusted with the fat cats in society and their super-powered poodle Superman, and in 1990's Give Me Liberty, his heroine, Martha Washington, fights her way out of the ghetto to take on the corrupt corporations who rule a future America. His characters seem, on the surface, to share many of the aims and ambitions of the members of the movement he's slamming.\n\nBut unlike his contemporary Alan Moore, Miller has always been more two-fisted in his deconstruction of the superhero. Whereas Moore's representations of his flawed heroes were always about the people behind the masks, Miller's broad brushstrokes seem to me to be more about the ideology of the all-American hero – and the freedoms of the individual weighed against those of the many.\n\nRevisiting The Dark Knight Returns, it's altogether possible to conclude that Miller's super-gritty, ultra-violent Batman isn't fighting for social justice at all. He's been forcibly retired and doesn't like it. His world has problems of street violence and out-of-control youths, and he himself has no confidence that society can fix itself. So he turns vigilante, taking matters into his own hands: instead of fighting gaudy villains, he takes on the government, and ultimately assembles his own private army of disenfranchised youths to ensure his dreamed-of Bat-Law is enforced upon Gotham's streets. It makes you wonder what the idealistic young Batman of Miller's work almost a quarter of a century ago would make of it all.\n\nIn 300, his wildly revisionist historical adventure based loosely on the Battle of Thermopylae and later filmed by Zack Snyder, meanwhile, the invading Persians are portrayed as barely-human, bent on destroying the civilised democracy of the heroic Spartans. One doesn't need to strip away many layers to uncover an allegory of the rise of Islam and the effect on the west.\n\nWorse was to come, moreover, in 2005 when Miller returned to DC Comics for All-Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder, in which he presented a Dark Knight who out-gritted even Miller's own previous representations. The hero – who famously gave birth to a minor internet phenomenon when he introduced himself as \"the Goddam Batman\" – has become a psychopathic borderline-villain who smacks Robin around the face to get him over the death of his parents, and who delights in killing and maiming the bad guys.\n\nAnd Miller's most recent work is entirely in keeping with the flavour of his Anarchy blogpost. Holy Terror was originally meant to be another Batman story, but ended up featuring a new character, The Fixer, whose role it was to \"fight al-Qaida\". Miller himself described the graphic novel as \"a piece of propaganda … a reminder to people who seem to have forgotten who we're up against\" – and it was not well-received. \"Miller's Holy Terror is a screed against Islam,\" said Spencer Ackerman, summing up the mood in Wired magazine, \"completely uninterested in any nuance or empathy toward 1.2 billion people he conflates with a few murderous conspiracy theorists.\"\n\nBut Miller was unapologetic. He responded to the criticism with tyical vigour on his blog. \"Three thousand of my neighbours were murdered. My country was, utterly unprovoked, savagely attacked,\" he said. \"I wish all those responsible for the Atrocity of 9/11 to burn in hell. I'm too old to serve my country in any other way. Otherwise, I'd gladly be pulling the trigger myself.\"\n\nLast month, the genre website Io9.com presciently asked a number of comics creators how Batman would deal with the Occupy Wall Street protesters. Miller weighed in late, his \"representatives\" replying on his behalf last week to say that \"Batman would respect the first amendment\" (protecting freedom of speech), and followed that up a couple of days later with an updated statement: \"Batman believes in the first amendment and decorous behaviour\"."
