        "text": "As reviews for early screenings for Captain America: Civil War begin to pour in, a consistent theme has emerged. For the film’s apparent brilliance in storytelling and action, the most common praise is that it deviates from the many pitfalls of DC Comics’ most recent major film, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\n\nThe critical and commercial reception of Batman v Superman has been nothing short of disappointing, with an almost infamous Rotten Tomatoes score settling in at 29% and a box office return quickly diminishing. The film has become a totem for discussion among online communities and served as the sword in crusades against the overwhelming prevalence of mainstream superhero films. Yet, with the critical and mass appeal of Civil War almost assured, the industry and superhero genre finds itself at an interesting crossroads, stuck between the desire for creative asymmetry and the understanding that a studio may have figured out the secret formula for a successful film.\n\nIt is curious that in discussing the wild successes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the main criticism thrown its way is that the films themselves are nothing more than a set of numbers in a pre-established formula. The surprising triumph of a film like Guardians of the Galaxy is attributed not to the creator’s vision, but to a well-oiled machine. That term, ‘formula’, or ‘formulaic’, is used as a verbal barb, meant more to diminish than to discuss, and it’s come to a head with the release of Batman v Superman.\n\nBatman v Superman has failed for a great many reasons, none more so than a bewildering lack of understanding of its own source material. The two title characters, iconic in their archetypes and values, stray too far from their comic characterizations. They serve less as faithful adaptations and more as hyper violent fetishisms—more Frank Miller, less Bill Finger.\n\nThe film, instead of highlighting the overt thematic differences between its characters, Superman, the populist hero, and Batman, the obsessed avenger, pits them in a confrontation that, while visually spectacular and a send home for fan fiction writers everywhere, emphasizes the soullessness of the film. With nary a smile and only the most begrudging humor, the grim and dreariness of the film found itself to be an overwhelming and unenjoyable affair.\n\nThe success of the Marvel films comes less from any sort of formulaic direction, and more from the adoration the creators tend to their creators. There’s a tenderness in their depictions of the Marvel heroes, an awareness of what they mean to not just their central readers but to the general audience. People understand and know who Captain America is and they know what he stands for. This passive understanding and mass appeal of the characters means something.\n\nEven in a minor hit like Ant-Man, the creative relationship with its source material is obvious and doting. Marvel seems to understand its own responsibility when adapting its characters. The existential dread in Batman v Superman and the passive dismissal of the characters iconography underscores the differences between the two studios ideologies.\n\nEven so, the grim despair of the Batman v Superman has served as a rallying point for many fans, particularly those who want something different than the deemed Marvel formula, a detour from the bright color pallet of Iron Man and Thor. In their words, it’s less the material that’s produced and more the courage to do something that contrasts from the norm. It’s a novel idea, one that has legs within the online communities and one of the main reasons many fans will fight tooth and nail defending the film. Yet, this idea that the film is a success because it’s different represents a failure in thinking and a misremembering of even recent film history.\n\nThe Dark Knight, the seminal Batman picture released in 2008, lent itself to the dark and gritty with a Joker who wasn’t the clown prince of the comics, but a modern anarchist hell bent on societal ruin. A wonderful film, critically and commercial acclaimed, The Dark Knight succeeded where Batman v Superman, and for that matter the recent Fantastic Four film, didn’t.\n\nIf anything, what The Dark Knight got right and what the Marvel formula represents is an understanding of storytelling and a triumph of characterizations. The differences between its films and an entity like Batman v Superman isn’t in its pallet or predication towards humor, but in its core tenants. People want to be superheroes. They want to aspire to be greater. Marvel films make it easier to believe in."
