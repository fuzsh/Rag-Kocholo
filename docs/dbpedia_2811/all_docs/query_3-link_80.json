        "text": "The Old West is the great American fairytale, a time and a place mythologized as it was still happening by circus-like Wild West shows – in which real-life figures, such as the Indian-scalper Buffalo Bill, reenacted their exploits on stage – and dime novels.\n\nWith the advent of moving picture, the Western became the first cinematic genre in the United States, further cementing the legends of both outlaws and lawmen – the likes of Jesse James and Wyatt Earp – in the Old West’s dying days.\n\nThe real Wyatt Earp lived in Hollywood and spent time on movie sets, where he met Western director John Ford; the 1903 silent short, The Great Train Robbery, often cited as one of the first narrative Westerns, mirrored the misadventures of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\n\nIn the silent era, Broncho Billy became the first cowboy star. In the 1930s, independent studios churned out a cattle drive-like slew of Western B-pictures to fill double-bills, and the 1940s and 1950s, when John Wayne became a major star, were a golden period for the genre. Later, revisionist Westerns and Italian-produced Spaghetti Westerns blew the old formula away, as the standard white hats and black hats (the goodies and baddies) were replaced with morally problematic anti-heroes. Native Americans, meanwhile, have been portrayed with varying degrees of sympathy, or even humanity – from Tonto-speaking Injuns to more complex depictions.\n\nEven during years when the Western has been out of style, it remains so deeply embedded in American cinema that its conventions and structures always linger in the background of other genres. Because there’s more to the Western than cowboy hats, saloon doors, and spurs. Stories of tumultuous westward journeys, rapidly changing times, hostile landscapes, and violent ideological clashes speak to the creation – and identity – of the United States itself.\n\nThe below films have been selected not only as great films, but for representing various styles, subgenres, and eras of the Western – though you won’t find any singing cowboys here – while tracking the history of the genre.\n\n25. Blazing Saddles (1974)\n\nLike many, if not all, Westerns after the classic era, Mel Brooks’s spoof is keenly aware of its own sense of genre – what the Western is, and what it represents as the mythic heart of American cinema. The story – about black railroad worker Bart (Cleavon Little), who’s hired as the sheriff of Rock Ridge, and Jim “the Waco Kid” (Gene Wilder) – is an affectionate send-up of the B-movie Westerns, complete with a town that’s a literal facade.\n\nIt’s famously puerile, of course – the most brilliantly flatulent film in comedy history (which is saying something) – and gleefully offensive in a way that just couldn’t be done now. Mel Brooks muddles the racial stereotypes, playing a Jewish Indian chief, while the characters go beyond the parameters of the genre, bursting onto the set of a musical – and even the Warner Bros cafeteria for a pie fight with other actors – before watching themselves on the big screen.\n\n3. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)\n\nThis Paul Newman and Robert Redford classic understands the relationship between early cinema and tales of the Old West. Directed by George Roy Hill, it begins as a crackling sepia newsreel about their train robberies – just as The Great Train Robbery would have looked in 1903, when Butch and Sundance were still at large – and casts moments of their legend in sepia hues. Everything else is timeless Hollywood class.\n\nButch and Sundance are too charming, too devilishly handsome, to ever be true bad guys – you just have to admire the sheer gall of their hold-ups – but they’re forced to go on the run in Bolivia. The best moments are the stuff of cinematic legend, too: frolicking on a bicycle to the sound of Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head; leaping from a cliff in a daring escape; and bantering while surrounded by hundreds of Bolivian soldiers. “For a moment there I thought we were in trouble,” says Butch, knowing they’re about to die."
