You may know Marc Allen as the successful co-founder of New World Library, with a dream home in Marin County, California, a happy family, and the luxury of determining when he works and when he plays.

It wasn’t always like that. There was a time when Marc had no money. There was a time when he lived in a spiritual community , worked in exchange for room and board, and his biggest task every morning was to figure out how to get a dollar to buy a latte.
