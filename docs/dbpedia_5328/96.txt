Marc Allen is CEO and Publisher of New World Library that publishes books and audios that inspire and challenge us to improve the quality of our lives and our world through mind, body and spirit.

The ultimate goal of the company is a sweeping one: personal and planetary transformation — awakening both individual consciousness and global social potential by publishing inspirational and practical materials on spirituality, personal growth, and other related areas.

“The best thing about the business, as far as I’m concerned,” Marc says, “is the large amount of mail and email we’ve received, over the years, from people who have been deeply affected by our publications. All I need to know is that I’ve made a positive impact on someone’s life — that makes it all worthwhile.”

He is a renowned author of numerous books including The Greatest Secret Of All, Visionary Business, The Millionaire Course, The Type-Z Guide To Success and one of my all time favorite books The Magical Path … Creating The Life Of Your Dreams And A World That Works For Us All.

Marc has recorded several albums, is a poet, well known speaker and seminar leader. New World Library was founded by Marc on his 30th birthday and has since published some phenomenal best sellers such as Eckhart Tolle’s The Power Of Now, Deepak Chopra’s The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success, Sark’s Succulent Wild Love and Lee Harris’s Energy Speaks just to name a few.
