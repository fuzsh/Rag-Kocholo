        "text": "Marc Allen graduated with a degree in theater arts and English literature. He worked as an actor and composer, touring the country from New York to California with a well-known theater company, the Firehouse Theater. Then he spent a year studying yoga and Eastern philosophy, two years studying Zen Buddhism, and over three years studying Tibetan Buddhism at the Nyingma Meditation Center in Berkeley, California. On the day of his 30th birthday, he cofounded New World Library with Shakti Gawain. Two years later, they had their first publishing success: Shakti Gawain’s Creative Visualization, which has sold nearly three million copies in North America since its publication in 1978.\n\nMarc has guided the company, as president and publisher, from a small start-up operation with no capital to a major player in the independent publishing world. He is an inspiring speaker and an author of several books, including Visionary Business: An Entrepreneur’s Guide to Success, A Visionary Life: Conversations on Personal and Planetary Evolution, and How to Think Like a Millionaire. He has also composed several albums of music, including Breathe, Petals, and Solo Flight. He lives in Novato, California, with his family."
