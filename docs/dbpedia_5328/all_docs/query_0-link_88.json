        "text": "In The Greatest Secret of All, Marc Allen explains that there are far greater secrets than the law of attraction. And that some of wealthiest people in the world live lives of misery because they haven’t learned the simple secret of a life well lived. His book gives a clear explanation of how manifestation works and then shows us how we can realize our greatest potential so that we create a life of purpose, happiness and inner peace.\n\nMarc is an author, composer, father, husband publisher and entrepreneur. In the 1980’s he co-founded New World Library, which is now a major player in the independent publishing world. He’s written several books, including The Type-Z Guide to Success, which we’ve reviewed on this show, The Millionaire Course, (we’ve also reviewed) and Visionary Business.\n\nRelated Products:"
