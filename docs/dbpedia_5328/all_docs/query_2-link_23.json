        "text": "Young at heart and magical are a few words to describe our special guest, Marc Allen. Marc is an internationally renowned seminar leader, entrepreneur, author, and composer. He co-founded New World Library (with Shakti Gawain) in 1977 and has guided the company, as president and publisher. As a gifted speaker and seminar leader, Marc works with people around the globe to craft lives of lasting abundance and prosperity. He has written several books, including The Magical Path and he is currently writing The Power of the Feminine: A Guide to Creating Radical Success...With Ease.\n\nIn this episode, they talk about Marc's journey that started as a self-proclaimed 'workshop junkie' and how that led him to creating his own workshops, a small start-up called Whatever Publishing, and ultimately New World Library, a major player in the independent publishing world. He shares why following his energy and connecting to music daily, (with plenty of room for naps) keeps him young and inspired in his work. Marc believes we are all born with creative gifts to express and explains why it's important to listen to that ongoing voice that says teach what you know and is in your heart and live it every day!\n\nTo learn more about his work: http://marcallen.com/\n\nTo buy his book The Magical Path: https://amzn.to/3rFPjnB\n\nThe views and opinions expressed by guests of Impact the World are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views or position of the host, of Lee Harris Energy LLC, or its staff or management.
