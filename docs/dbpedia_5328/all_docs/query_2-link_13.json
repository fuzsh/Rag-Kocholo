        "text": "Marc Allen is an internationally renowned author and speaker, the president and publisher of New World Library, and an accomplished musician and composer. His most recent book, The Magical Path — Creating the Life of Your Dreams and a World that Works for All — is filled with short, simple practices that have proven to help thousands of people make wonderful changes in their lives. Bestselling author Dr. Bernie Siegel put it this way: \"Marc Allen is sharing the wisdom of the ages in a way that can guide and coach us to choose and create the life we desire.\" His previous book, The Greatest Secret of All, guides the reader in unraveling the secrets of happiness, inner peace, ease, and fulfillment. Bestselling author Gay Hendricks says of The Greatest Secret of All: \"It is a wonderful contribution to humanity. It gives us the key to a life well lived.\" Marc's most popular book is The Millionaire Course: A Visionary Plan for Creating the Life of Your Dreams. It is an entire course, filled with keys to success. Over the years, he has written and published several other books, including Visionary Business: An Entrepreneur's Guide to Success, which brought his principles to those in the business world, and A Visionary Life, which remains one of the best books ever written on personal fulfillment. He has also published The Type-Z Guide to Success — A Lazy Person's Manifesto for Wealth and Fufillment — which is loved by lazy people all over the world, and The Ten Percent Solution: Simple Steps to Improve Our Lives and the World. He produced a popular audio CD (over 100,000 copies sold), Stress Reduction and Creative Meditations. In recent years he has expanded his reach to deliver his message through a variety of digital formats. He has produced The Success With Ease Audio Course, a 12-audio download available through his website, MarcAllen.com. The 11th audio of the series is available as a separate download; it's titled The Spiritual Path to Success. Marc co-founded New World Library with Shakti Gawain in 1977 and has guided the company from a small start-up with no capital to its current position as one of the leading independent publishers in the country. Along the way, he has published many books that have changed lives, including Eckhart Tolle's The Power of Now, Deepak Chopra's The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success, and Shakti Gawain's Creative Visualization. Marc is a well-known musician and composer as well, having produced five albums of music for his label Watercourse Media. His latest composition is a soaring orchestral work called Awakening, and his first instrumental album, Breathe, has now sold nearly 100,000 copies and has been named a \"New Age Golden Oldie\" by NAPRA. Marc has discovered, through trial and error, a proven set of principles and simple practices that can help each of us live the life of our dreams, doing what we love to do, while adhering to compassionate, conscious values. His books, audios, and seminars — and the powerful books he has published — have been life-changing experiences for millions of people.\n\nRead full bio"
