        "text": "August 22, 2017\n\nقطعا\" نسخه ی صوتی این کتاب رو به هیچ کس توصیه نمی کنم .فوق العاه بی کیفیت و کسل کننده بود. راوی حتی نمی دونست جمله ها کجا شروع\n\n:| میشن کجا تموم ! ... همین طور مسلسل وار و پشت سر هم می خوند\n\nMay 31, 2020\n\nخب طبيعتا از اسمش معلومه!بيشتر كتاب رو اين تاكيد ميكنه كه طرز تفكر چقد مهمه،دوتا مسئله جالب اومد ميخوام اونا را بگم.\n\nيكيش گفته بود از گندم گندم برويد از جو ز جو،خب وقتي تفكرات درستي نداريم طبيعتا نبايد انتظار خوبي از كارهامون داشته باشيم يكي ديگه اين بود ميگفت ما سعي ميكنيم تفكراتمون را پنهان كنيم ولي نهايتا معلوم ميشه چون تفكراتمون به اعمال تبديل ميشه و اعمال رو هم مگه چقد ميشه پنهان كرد؟\n\nاگه يه ساعت بيكار شديد و هيچي نداشتيد واسه خوندن اينو پيشنهاد ميكنم!\n\nMay 19, 2013\n\nOne of those books that you can keep as a possession. Short and precise, you can finish it in 2-3 hours but need constant contemplation for the real benefit. There are many good books in market which contain the same message but this book seems quite like something pious written in 1904.\n\nHere it ends with this:\n\nTempest-tossed souls, wherever you may be, under whatever conditions you may live, know this:\n\n\"In the ocean of life the isles of blessedness are smiling, and the sunny shore of your ideal awaits you coming. Keep your hand firmly upon the helm of thought.\n\nIn the ship of your soul reclines the commanding Master- he does but sleep; wake him.\n\nSelf-control is strength; right thought is mastery; calmness is power.\n\nSay to your heart,\"Peace, be still!\"\n\nJune 9, 2011\n\nSince about 1980 -when I was a young knucklehead at Texas Tech- I've kept Kahlil Gibran's \"The Prophet\" on my nightstand. There is no better companion on sleepless nights, or at the end of difficult days. Now I will be keeping a copy of James Allen's \"As You Think\" right next to it.\n\nQuiet, and simply expressed, this edition of \"As a Man Thinketh\" (produced by Allen's great grandson) is a requisite touchstone for introspection and occassional re-centering.\n\nThe Prophet almost always moves me to tears. As You Think makes me feel light and optimistic about the fate of -and direction of- western civlization.\n\nread this book.\n\nDecember 19, 2011\n\nA must read self-empowerment book. No magic here...just the ultimate truth that \"all we achieve and all that we fail to achieve is the direct result of our own thoughts\". Definitely a book to revisit often.\n\nJuly 2, 2014\n\nکتاب گویای «توهمانی که می‌اندیشی» را گوش دادم. بجز اعصاب خورد کردن هیچ چیزی نداشت! گوینده حتی یک بار کتاب رو نخونده بود همش تپق میزد و روی ساده‌ترین جملات هم چندین بار جمله خودشو تکرار میکرد! خیلی سعی کردم این ایراد رو نادیده بگیرم ببینم کتاب چی میگه که اون هم چیز جدیدی برای گفتن نداشت!\n\nJune 15, 2007\n\nThis is a manual for life. I suggest keeping this on you at all times.\n\nSeptember 17, 2020\n\n\"آدمی مسبب شرایط و اوضاع خویش است.\"\n\nراستش من این قبیل جمله، متن‌ها و کتاب‌ها رو کلا قبول ندارم. ولی اگر کتابای این مدلی و انگیزشی رو دوست دارید اینم یکی از هموناست که میگه بخواهید تا به شما داده شود، اگه داده نشد ایمانتان کافی نبوده و اگر اتفاق بدی می‌افته برا اینه که دلتان پاک نبوده و رنج حاصل تفکرات آلوده شماست و این صحبتا.\n\nApril 8, 2019\n\nHave you seen those bath bombs that are tiny-miny in size but once you put it into the water,they explode and make your bubble bath the best bath? This book is going to do the exact same thing to your life. A small book with around 95 pages is going to explode your mind and heart and brain and make your life the best life.\n\nAs You Think reveals the mantra to success and happiness in all walks of life and the mantra is nothing but YOU, your thoughts, your perception, your choices. You make and break your life.\n\nThe title does go with the book because any situation can only serve As You Think it can and that's what the book has to say.\n\nThe language is not easy. The words have been used in a very precise manner and a lot of introspection and patience is required to decipher the knowledge.\n\nThe kind of effect this book has had on my - oh my my. I feel zen. I would suggest you to read 1-2 pages everyday repetitively in order to get the most of the book.\n\nIn the end, just one suggestion - DROP EVERYTHING AND READ THIS BOOK.\n\nMarch 17, 2011\n\nIt's one of the greatest books I have ever read about the Law of Attraction. It's a fabulous book, I highly advice to read!\n\nOctober 10, 2016\n\nی کتاب در قط و اندازه کوچک ولی مفید:)\n\nJune 6, 2021\n\nVaroluşçu psikoloji ile ilgili okuma yaparken bu kitabın bir şekilde önüme çıkmasını kesinlikle alelâde bir tesadüf, tevafuk, şans (adına ne derseniz deyin) olarak değerlendiremiyorum. Başıma tekrarlı bir şekilde gelen bu güzelliklerin anlamını okumaya çalışıyorum sadece. Ya da varoluş ve anlamı arayışında biraz fazla ileri gitmiş de olabilirim, bilmiyorum😊 Başım gözüm üstüne diyor, yeni puzzle parçalarımı bekliyorum😌\n\nDecember 11, 2018\n\n“We don’t get what we wish and pray for, we get what we justly earn. Our wishes and prayers are only gratified and answered when they harmonize with our thoughts and actions.”\n\nI usually love this kind of thing but this wasn't doing it for me. Possibly a personal type deal.\n\nJuly 4, 2014\n\nAn extremely small book, some may even call it something of a booklet.\n\nHowever, the power within this book cannot be overlooked.\n\nAn intricate swim in the waters of human thought, and how one might build his own boat to travel upon these waters masterfully, and one day conquer them.\n\nA beautiful inspiration, poetically explaining to people the very simple principles of life and achievements, through the mystic oracles of thoughts.\n\nA highly recommended read, re-read and re-re-read. =)\n\nAugust 16, 2012\n\nThis book is worth memorizing word for word. It's wisdom is concise, compact and applicable for every occation....I mean, when are we ever not thinking? Think better, act better, get better results. Change your inner experience, change your life.\n\nRead\n\nJune 11, 2008\n\nPowerful life strategies. Great road map for life. I plan to pass it on to a new high school grad in my family.\n\nJanuary 24, 2016\n\nSelf improvement booklet about how our thoughts dictate our actions. It can be summed up in one quote (one of which I'm not sure is even in the reading): As you think, you become.\n\nNovember 18, 2021\n\n”That human Will, that force unseen,\n\nThe offspring of a deathless Soul,\n\nCan hew a way to any goal,\n\nThough walls of granite intervene.” (p. 48)\n\nA must read self-empowerment book! It simply conveys the ultimate truth that \"all we achieve and all that we fail to achieve is the direct result of our own thoughts\". It seemed to me that James Allen’s thoughts were kind of influenced by Buddhism as he also talks about topics like suffering, harmony with ourselves, and enlightenment. Definitely a book to revisit often in our constantly evolving and progressive life to enhance spiritual, mental, and physical well-being.\n\nNovember 18, 2017\n\nA nugget of good wisdom, think positive and good things can happen, surrounded by a bunch of pseudo-scientific nothingness.\n\nJuly 1, 2021\n\nWell. If you need to hear, “align your thoughts with what you want and you’ll get it”, then you can get that here in a small bite-sized package.\n\nI didn’t feel the self empowerment here.\n\nJuly 30, 2023\n\nManage your thoughts, the body will follow.\n\nAugust 16, 2015\n\nIt is a very thin book which deceives us in thinking that it can be read very fast. But every sentence in it is so deep that you cannot help but read and wonder how true it is for your own life. Every sentence has a lesson which you can learn and then realize how wrong you have been thinking, acting and living your life.\n\nIt tells you the mantra of a successful life in the simplest manner possible.\n\nDecember 18, 2016\n\nA quick, inspiring read. Every time I read a book like this I think of people I know that would benefit greatly from reading it as well, but sadly they are usually the people that won't read it. I'll give it to them anyway.\n\nMuch of what spoke to me in this book is the rightness of thought and the ability of thought to propel us toward action. Share this book with anyone you know that is feeling a bit lost or down about their luck.\n\nSeptember 4, 2014\n\n\"AS YOU THINK\" is the best ever SELF EMPOWERMENT guide. Every one must read this book, it is a good guide for success. This book has SEVEN principles for the successful life, Keep this book with you always, pick any principle and read. you will feel energized.\n\nIts Very small, Handy and Great book to READ............\n\nOctober 7, 2012\n\nAn excellent update of the famous \"As a Man Thinketh\" which has greatly benefited from the light touch of editing for modern readers. Read in parallel with the original.\n\nSmall, simple, powerful book - recommended!\n\nDecember 7, 2015\n\n#1 Inspirational Book which you can keep reading over and over again.\n\nGives a fresh perspective on what thoughts can actually do in our lives.\n\nA must read for all those who crave for peaceful life in this fast paced world.\n\nJanuary 5, 2014\n\nI believe I will read this book several times. It was concise and packed with wisdom. It is a great read and I highly recommend reading this book. It's a quick read, and well worth your time."
