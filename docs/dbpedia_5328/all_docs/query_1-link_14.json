On the other side there is magic and on that path which is truly your own you will find magic. It will not come without doing the work first.\n\nFocus on the positives. It is too often that we focus on the negative aspect of life. The negatives that come with fear and failure. We allow them to consume our mind. This creates more of the same. We can be aware but divert our attention to positives, the lessons, the wins and focus on them. This will ensure we bring more of what we need into our life to drive away what we do not need.\n\nConnect within. You must connect to your why.
