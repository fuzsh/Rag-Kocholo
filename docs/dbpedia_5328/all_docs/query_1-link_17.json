It wasn't always like that. There was a time when Marc had no money. There was a time when he lived in a spiritual community , worked in exchange for room and board, and his biggest task every morning was to figure out how to get a dollar to buy a latte. There was a time. And, now there is this time. Marc's life is very, very different. He has created a dream business, a dream life, and he no longer has to worry about how to get a dollar to buy a latte. In this interview, Marc reveals what is needed for you to Create your Dreams for the New Year!
