        "text": "As You Think : Second Edition\n\nMarc Allen\n\nTaschenbuch. Condition: Neu. Neuware - In 1904, a little-known Englishman named James Allen wrote a small book called As a Man Thinketh. A hundred years later, this book has become a self-empowerment classic. New World Library author and publisher Marc Allen updated this timeless gem, recasting obsolete language and polishing the author's message to highlight the universal principles of the original. James Allen's message has now reached a whole new generation of readers with As You Think. Great truths are simple and easy to express, and James Allen's insights into self-empowerment are just that: Personal power lies within the mind. Once awakened, there are no limits to what one can imagine and then achieve with the power of thought. The author shares deep insights into the essential relationship of a person's thoughts to personal character, life circumstances, physical health, life purpose, achievement, and personal serenity. As You Think is a simple yet powerful reminder that 'all we achieve and all that we fail to achieve is the direct result of our own thoughts.' We are the masters of our destinies.
