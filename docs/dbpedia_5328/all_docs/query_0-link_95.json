        "text": "The New World Library has published over 550 titles, including books by Mother Teresa, Eckhart Tolle, Deepak Chopra, Henry David Thoreau, and so many more. Joining Corin Grillo on the show today is Marc Allen, the Cofounder of the prestigious publishing company. Marc recalls how he was a completely lazy, hippy slacker who stepped into this incredible world of magic. He shares his process of exactly what he did to get where he was today. It is a mystical, soulful, and ridiculously awesome journey. Don’t miss this episode and be inspired to have bigger dreams and to listen to that voice inside of you that’s urging you to do things a little differently.\n\n—\n\nListen to the podcast here:\n\nThe Magical Path With Marc Allen\n\nIn this episode, you’re going to meet a true rockstar in the publishing world. It is an incredible honor that he came to talk to us. He is my publisher from the New World Library. We’re talking to Marc Allen, who is the Cofounder of New World Library that was started back in 1977 with Shakti Gawain. Have you ever heard of her? She’s a real spiritual heavy. In this episode, he talks about this wild story of how he went from being a complete, lazy, hippie slacker into stepping into this incredible world of magic. I wanted to introduce you to him because he is such a cool dude. He inspires me. I want to be like him when I grow up. He’s been highly successful.\n\nNew World Library has published books like The Power of Now from Eckhart Tolle. He’s also published Deepak Chopra and many other amazing authors. I already mentioned that he published me. I’m grateful to him for giving me my first book deal, The Angel Experiment, and all the badasses at New World Library. They are badasses. The main reason why I wanted you to meet him is that even though he’s had this massive success, he is not an asshole about it. He is grounded down to earth, the sweetest human artistic. He shares his process of exactly what he did to get where he is now. It is a mystical soulful ridiculously awesome journey. I wanted to share him with you to inspire you to have bigger dreams and to listen to that weird voice inside of you that might be urging you to do things a little differently. You’ll see, with Marc’s story, how important that is. I love this man as a human.\n\nI can’t wait for you to encounter his good juju and receive some of his amazing tips and advice. Besides doing all of that, he’s also his own author. He’s written all manner of books, including a book called The Magical Path, The Greatest Secret of All, The Millionaire Course, Visionary Business and so many more. He loves to support people in activating their biggest dreams. You can see why because he’s managed to do that and then some. I hope you enjoy this magical encounter with Marc Allen.\n\n—\n\nMarc, it’s great to have you here. I’m stoked because you’re such a huge piece of this incredible angelic miracle that happened in the form of publishing my book, The Angel Experiment. I had to have you on because I’m grateful. I think you are such a special human and I definitely want my peeps to share your magic.\n\nI sure feel the same way, Corin. You’re the most delightful author to deal with I’ve dealt with in years. It’s been a lot of fun.\n\nHere’s the deal, you’ve done some pretty massive things in your life. When people have incredible success, sometimes people get this image of what it looks like. You carry yourself a certain way. What I love about you is that you’ve gone in the opposite direction. You’re so much more chill, relaxed and non-pretentious. I think it’s amazing.\n\nTo me, it’s a no-brainer. In fact, the people I appreciate that are successful, like Eckart Tolle, have that same quality. He’s totally laid back. He’s amused by his success. He’s easygoing. That’s the only way to be, otherwise, it’s ego. I have dealt with a lot of authors with a lot of egos. Ego creates problems in your life.\n\nYou’ve told me some horror stories in the past. Good for you. Here you are, this great publisher. I’m sure people are curious. When you were a little kid, were you like, “When I grow up, I want to be a famous publisher and publish all of these famous authors?”\n\nNo, not at all. When I was a kid, at one point I remember thinking, “I’m going to be a writer at around fifteen or so.” Around 29, I got tricked into writing. I was with Shakti Gawain and when we were supposed to help this guy a five-day workshop. We were his support team. Shakti was supposed to cook, I was supposed to hand out papers, and he was leading it.\n\nThis is was when? How long ago?\n\nIt was 1975. The guy had a nervous breakdown. Twenty-five people showed up for this five-day workshop in this big house we had. He got weirder and weirder. Ten minutes before that, the three of us were in the kitchen and he said, “I can’t handle this.” He walked out the back door. Shakti and I ended up leading it.\n\nLet me get this straight. This guy was supposed to lead this thing and he bails at the last minute?\n\nHe bails ten minutes before. He’d already burnt the checks that people had sent in for the deposit saying, “We shouldn’t be attached to a material plane.”\n\nWas it LSD? What was going on?\n\nI think that was possible. It was total craziness. It turns out he was getting checks from the state for being crazy. He had wealthy parents that would send him money. Shakti and I were broke. We were doing it because he was going to pay us part of this workshop. That’s what we were there for. It turned out he ended up launching our careers because Shakti and I ended up teaching this seminar. Shakti turned into this brilliant teacher. Between each break, I’d run upstairs and make notes. For five days, Shakti and I threw in everything we ever learned about anything. We were workshop junkies from Berkeley, California.\n\nI kept making notes and giving people notes. In the end, it grew into 64 pages of notes. I stapled them together and gave them to people. I looked up “book” and “publish” in a dictionary to say, “Have I published a book? Is that what this is?” Sure enough, a book is anything with a spine. Publishing is any number of copies. You can make two copies of something and give one to your mother and you’ve officially published the book. That’s how I started. I had this little book. I’ve never had this thing of, “I’m writing a book.” I only threw together notes.\n\nAt the last second because someone had a little psychotic meltdown. It goes to show that it’s some of the weirdest moments in our life, like the ones that you think are going to be just devastating.\n\nShakti had burst into tears and said, “What are we going to do?” I said, “Let’s try to teach it. He’s burned the checks anyway. If they’re not happy they can have their money back.”\n\nNo one’s getting paid today.\n\nLooking back, he launched our career. I’m grateful to him for that. We never would have had the hutzpah. I was 29, she was 27. We would never have led 25 people in an experience. My first little book was called Reunion. That was the name of the workshop. I subtitled it Tools for Transformation. I ended up getting it out there in our stores. We found a distributor and I ended up selling 12,000 copies over fifteen years or something. Shakti took the same material and called it Creative Visualization. We published that. Suddenly, we had a book that was selling by word of mouth. She’s such a great writer. The book started taking off. We had no promotion. We didn’t send out one review copy. We didn’t do anything. We got it in our little store and I found a little local distributor.\n\nThat is funny because it reminded me of the first time I saw that book. It was on a bookshelf of this spiritual school that I used to belong in back in the early ‘90s. It was on our reading list. We had to read all these books like Way of the Peaceful Warrior and all of the classics, even Ender’s Game. You and that book were part of that. It’s insane that she relabeled it and it became a classic.\n\nPlus, the way she wrote it. Two weeks after it was out, we got a letter saying, “Thank you so much, Shakti. Every other book I’ve read like this feels like someone pointing their fingers at me and telling me I should do this. Your book takes me by the hand gently, leads me into a garden, and gives me beautiful flowers.” It was so sweet.\n\nWhat do you think that was, Marc? This is a spectacular way to start. The fact that this guy has a psychotic break and you went with it.\n\nWe had 25 people there wanting some experience. I realized early on into it that didn’t even matter all that much what Shakti and I did. We were creating the space for them to come. They were taking 4 or 5 days out of their lives. They were creating the experience. We just created the space and gave them suggestions in effect. I realized that it wasn’t difficult to do at all. It was easy. It went well. They loved it. One guy said, “I need you to do the same thing down in LA.” He booked us in LA and it launched our career.\n\nDo you look back at that? How do you frame that now? Is that divine guidance, divine timing or some awesome luck that you capitalized on it and rocked?\n\nIt’s all karma. That was awesome luck. We never would have said to each other, “Let’s do a workshop.” We never would have been able to attract 25 people for 4 or 5 days. This guy actually stole the mailing list of this other workshop presenter. That’s how we got 25 people to come in for 4 or 5 days.\n\nWhat a crooked operation you were running back then. It didn’t even teach any lessons because you benefited and capitalized off of it.\n\nWe’ve never taught anything before. Shakti turned out to be this wonderful teacher and speaker. She was brilliant.\n\nFor most people, standing in front of 25 people would freak them out. Good for her. She stepped into the power overnight. That’s how it all started, which is pretty insane. Creative Visualization comes out. What has happened since? Have you written other books? Tell us more about that journey.\n\nShakti and I both continued writing and doing seminars. For a few years, we did seminars together. We split up because so often, people would ask questions and we’d give them opposite advice. She’d say, “You have this feeling. You have to get into this feeling and get into a dialogue with it.” I’d say, “Cut the shit and do the thing.” That’s the best advice I’ve ever had. We finally said we should do separate things. We both then wrote more books. I’ve done eighteen of them now or something. Shakti ended up doing quite a few. She taught seminars and was on Oprah. She did well. It was Oprah that launched our company.\n\nI thought it was the crazy guy.\n\nHe loves the beginning of it but without Oprah, we would have probably continued to be a fairly small company. We had creative visualization. We probably would have become profitable in a little company. Oprah came along and had Shakti on for an hour. She held the book up and the cameras zeroed in. Oprah said, “I believe and I’ve seen in my own life that creative visualization works.” I called my marketing guy and said, “We need a lot more books in print.”\n\nHow on earth did that interview happen? I’m sure we have a lot of readers that want to know how you get in front of Oprah.\n\nWe’ve sent her many books over the years. I heard she gets a dumpster full of mail each day with books and ideas. Oprah found it. One of our producers called us up and said, “Does Shakti want to be on Oprah?” It was the same with The Power of Now. I got a phone call in my office. He said, “Marc, you don’t know me but you gave me your card at a publishing convention five years ago. I just want to tell you, I’m at the LA Book Fair. We’d had a table of books. Oprah’s here, walking around with The Power of Now on her arm. You might want to know that.” Anything Oprah does is awesome. She’s the most amazing thing that has happened to the publishing industry in 50 years.\n\n[bctt tweet=”A book is anything with a spine, and publishing is any number of copies.” via=”no”]\n\nDo you believe that other publishers would agree? She’s got the touch.\n\nShe mentions a book and the sales take off. The first time she mentioned The Power of Now, it was buried in her magazine on page 128. It was in a little lower right-hand corner in a little box with a picture that said, “Meg Ryan turned me on to this. It’s a great book.” Sales took off.\n\nThat’s a true testament in abundance right there. Oprah launched the thing. I know two of your books,Success with Ease and The Magical Path.\n\nSuccess with Ease isn’t a book. The book was The Millionaire Course. It evolved into Success with Ease. I wish I would have called it Success with Ease originally, with hindsight. It’s a twelve-CD audio course called Success with Ease based on The Millionaire Course. I like the phrase “success with ease.” It’s still my fairly unique thing because I’ve always been lazy. In my twenties, I’d been a musician and an actor. We never did a thing until 1:00 in the afternoon. Even as a kid, I was never a morning person. The day I turned 30, I started this publishing company. I decided to do an experiment because I didn’t want to work 60 hours a week but I wanted to start my own company. I said, “I’m just going to work when I feel like it. I’m going to do a musician’s hours.”\n\nI don’t do Mondays. I always have that to myself. I don’t do mornings. My doubts and fears said, “That’s impossible.” I got around them by saying, “I want to try this as an experiment.” Most of my thoughts were sure that I was incapable of starting a business. I certainly couldn’t do it and still be lazy. I said, “This is my experiment, to be lazy. I work only when I feel like it.” I usually don’t work more than 20 to 25 hours a week, maybe focused work. I said, “If it doesn’t work, I’ll be no worse off than I am right now.” At the time when I turned 30, I had no job, money, income, or family support. I’ve got nothing to lose. How much worse could it get?\n\nI guess you’re right. It is the perfect time to commit.\n\nMost of my thoughts said, “Give me a year or two to try this experiment to still be lazy, sleep in, play my music, goof off, and go to the beach.” Most of my thoughts said it won’t work. I had a feeling that maybe our success is not at all dependent on the number of hours we put into it. That’s totally arbitrary. We have bought into this type of workaholic culture that says you need to work 40 hours a week. That’s what you do. That’s a completely arbitrary number when you think about it.\n\nWhen everyone else is doing it and that’s the standard, it takes serious cojones to say, “Maybe that’s not true,” especially when you’re poor already. You are lazy, Marc.\n\nWhen I thought of the idea, my lazy side said, “Yes, this is a great experiment. You’re going to be lazy for a year. Keep being lazy like you have been through your twenties. This is your experiment, to keep being lazy and start a business.” I loved it. It was a great idea.\n\nDid it work or did you have to work at it to make it work?\n\nIt took three years to start working. Total disclosure, I knew nothing about money or business. I’d never read a book, taken a course, or anything. I’d been a musician, actor, and spiritual seeker. I had no interest in money or business and decided to start a business. In my book, The Millionaire Course, and my Success with Ease course, there are twelve different ways people can raise money. I’ve learned them over the years and I have done the first seven of them. There are all kinds of ways to raise money. At the time, I knew nothing about that. The only thing I could think of was, “I have to get a job.” I went and got a horrible job, typesetting. It started at 8:30 in the morning and it was horrible. The first thing I did was look around for a better job. I got a typesetting job that started at 4:00 in the afternoon and went until midnight. Those hours work for me.\n\nAt first, I did have this horrible 40-hour week job. I saved 20% or so and I did my first little book. I did my first little album of music called Breathe. I got fired as a typesetter. That turned out to be another gift, in hindsight, because then I knew how to do it. I knew how to even get a machine to do it, computerized phototypesetting at the time, and I started doing it just on my own. Immediately I started making 3, 4, or 5 times the money per hour, doing my own books for UC Press. I hired my cousin to do the actual typesetting and I just managed the business. I ended up doing well with it. That financed my publishing company.\n\nAt this stage, was this one when you were able to let go of some of the time and not work on Mondays? I know you’re still doing that.\n\nAs soon as I had my own business, I had my own hours so I could sleep late. Early on, I started taking Mondays off. That was a few years into when we finally got a company going and we had employees and it was building. I remember one Tuesday I came in and we had a Monday holiday. I felt so good and energetic. I thought it’s because of the Monday holiday. I said, “I own a company. I could take every Monday off if I want.” I’ve done that for years.\n\nThat’s one of my favorite things too, having your own business. It’s a blessing and a curse because sometimes you need something to blame and I don’t have a boss anymore. I want to blame someone sometimes, but it’s not right. “I’m working so hard. They’re treating me like that’s me.” I love that Success with Ease and that’s important because there are different kinds of cash to make in the world. There’s cash that’s going to make you crazy and cash that’s going to support your life. For you, your lazy way is inspiring because I know you a little better. It’s also soulful. You were listening to the call in your heart. The part that needs to be slow, creative and chillax. Can you imagine who you’d be if you did not listen to that?\n\nI would not have read anything. I wouldn’t have done any music. I wouldn’t have started the company. It was a day I took off and did nothing, that’s when I get my ideas. It’s not when I’m working taking details.\n\nThere’s probably a lot of people stuck in that hamster wheel of 40 hours a week and want to get out of that. Especially people with a heart-centered mission. They want to get creative and they want to do those things that you’re talking about. It’s inspiring for people to hear how well that works and how well it worked for you. Thank you for sharing that and writing that book. Tell us more about The Magical Path.\n\nIt was my last big book. I’m doing a thing online from it. It has twelve chapters in it. The book kept growing and growing. When I first started it, I thought it would be short, because I just wanted to do all the magical things I’ve done over the years. I thought, “There’s not that many of them. I don’t spend much time on it or anything.” Maybe it even goes back to my first big book which was called Visionary Business. It was for business people. I started writing it for my own staff to show them how the company started and to teach them the values of this company. It grew and I finally realized, “This is a good book for everybody that’s an entrepreneur.” Promoting that book, I often started saying, if the crowd was hip, “It’s just magic. This is modern magic. It’s powerful, it works and it’s simple.”\n\nOver the years, that led to my thinking of the magical path. I started writing it, I thought it would be short, but it kept growing and growing. As I remembered looking back then when I wrote Magical Path, I’ve been doing this thing for years or something. I kept waking up at 3:00 AM thinking, “Yeah, I did that exercise too. Maybe that made a huge difference. Who knows, but I’ve got to include in the book.” It finally had twelve chapters. Each one is almost like a mini-course in itself. They’re all different. They’re all these things that I did. I only wrote things that I had done. Looking back, I didn’t research anything. It was all based on my total experience and I kept thinking, “I did that. I did this prayer, these affirmations, and who knows what worked?” I did magical circles, imagine I’m the entire universe and attract all this money to me.\n\nYou put it all down there in a book and rock it. That book is for people who are working to liberate themselves to have freedom. Is it mostly through business?\n\nThrough anything, any kind of career. It’s doing what you love and making it work somehow for you. That’s the fun and the challenge. I want to do what I love every minute of the day. Many people do have a job and in their free time, they have a life. That’s fine for a lot of people if that’s all they can envision, but I encourage people. I even challenged people to go for it. To do what you love. My own dad finally came around but not till the end of his life. He worked 35 years for the same corporation, 9:00 to 5:00. He wanted his voice to do the same thing. He wanted me to go into a corporation. I ignored my dad.\n\nYou clearly did. Your little creative, lazy butt you’re like, “Sorry, dad.”\n\nI get up early five days a week, shower and drive into an office all day long. That’s not my life, that’s for sure. He did, but on the side, he made beautiful wooden things. In the garage, he made toy trains for kids that actually worked. When I started being successful, I said, “Dad, you could make it work. You could be a woodworker. You’re an artist. You could find a way to make that work as a career.”\n\nThere’s no vision back then. It’s interesting because I know a few artisans who repressed. It was like a hobby, but they were so skillful. My brother was a military. He retired as a master sergeant. He was in there his whole life. That was years ago and now he’s got his own Etsy store. He’s making these crazy resin skulls with spiders in them and it’s so cool. He’s finding his creative edge again. He’s successful doing it. It’s never too late. Our parents show us in a sense what not to do and clearly, you’ve got your creative edge maybe from your dad.\n\nAt the end of his life, he even said to me once, “Looking back if I had to do it over again, I would not work 35 years for the same corporation.” It took him a long time because he was afraid. It’s our fears that we have to deal with to go out on our own. I remember in our neighborhood, all fathers work for corporations, except for one. He had a new job every other year. All the other fathers were in awe of him. I thought he was weird but I liked him. He was creative.\n\nI love that you’re helping people be, what sounds like magical visionaries, in a way. How to explore their creative side and step in. The way that you step into purpose, I feel like for you, has been truly magical. Your journey is so inspiring. Tell us more about this Magical Path group.\n\nIt started as a year in The Magical Path. I did a yearlong thing, where each month we take a chapter of the book, The Magical Path, and get into it. We kept continuing it, so now it’s called On The Magical Path. Every month, we take 1 of the 12 chapters of The Magical Path and each chapter is its own total complete course in itself. For a month, we focus on one thing. After a year, even often a lot less than that, but people do have amazing results in their life. We have this page and there’s a lot of chatting. People tell me stories. It always makes my day, that people are doing well. They’re doing what they love to do and making it work.\n\nThat’s inspiring. I want to say it’s such a gift for you to be sharing yourself with people, and to be continually giving and helping to support in that container, where they can actually, talk to you and you could read their stories and all of that. It’s sweet and human. That’s what I’ve always been most impressed with. I have to say, New World Library, as I was doing the podcast circuit for promoting my book, The Angel Experiment, and all of that. All of them had incredible things to say about New World Library. I can’t even tell you how many people said, “They are the best of the best.” I know it’s because of the culture that you create, the humanity, the authenticity and the real heart that you bring into the work.\n\nTo me, it’s a no-brainer. In my book, Visionary Businesses, it’s the best way to start a business. What is the best way? When I first got two employees to do shipping, I sat down I said, “What would I want as an employee?” I remember making a list. It was like, “I want total respect. I want to do my job without anybody looking over my shoulder. I want to be respected as being a manager. Being able to handle my job. I want profit sharing. I want benefits. I want health and dental.” In the beginning, we couldn’t afford any of that. We weren’t making profits. As we grew, I ended up implementing it all. Half the profits go to employees. People say, “That’s so generous.” It is, but it’s also the best way to run a business because we make over twice the profits. If you give half the profits to employees, you’ll make over twice the profits, because every employee immediately becomes a good employee.\n\nThat’s visionary. It’s so wonderful.\n\nTo me, it’s obvious. I do not know why every company doesn’t do profit sharing because they would make more even.\n\nEverybody would be in the market for that. All the employees would be in the market for that as well.\n\nEvery employee can cut costs, increase sales, or both. Most publishers make about a 5% pretax. Every dollar that comes in that making $0.05 to $0.10 profit at most. We make 15% to 25% pretax profits because our employees are so sharp about cutting costs and spending only in the right place. They’re all thinking like owners because they know that every dollar they save, they’re going to get a piece of it. The average person there has been there for over eighteen years.\n\nThe average in the rest of the world is 1.5 years or something like that, versus 18 years.\n\n[bctt tweet=”So often, people would ask questions and we’d give them the opposite advice.” via=”no”]\n\nPlus, a great pension plan. They get a profit-sharing fat check every year, and another fat equal amount of money goes into a pension plan. The ones who have stayed ten years, they have a fat retirement account building and building.\n\nThat’s wonderful and a testament to who you are. I know that there’s probably a lot of people reading this that are curious about the publishing industry, how to get published. There’re blossoming authors that are either sitting on a book or wanting to understand how to write a book and I know you have some good author events coming up at some point. What do you feel is the most important aspect of getting published, at least at New World Library?\n\nWrite something some editor falls in love with. You write from your heart. Don’t follow trends. Don’t write your story. Unfortunately, my distributors say, “Memoirs don’t sell.” Often people’s first book, they’ll have to write their own story. I’ve had hundreds of submissions with the same cover letter with a 300-page manuscript that says, “My life was a total mess up until six months ago. I was horribly abused.” They had some amazing awakening experience and then they wrote their 300-page book in the last six months. The first 80% is all about the abuse they’ve had, and their horrible lives. It’s unreadable. I always say to them, “It’s good you wrote that. Now put it aside.”\n\nAddress your readers like, “What have you learned from your experience? You had an awakening experience of some kind,” like Eckhart did. He was the best. He told his story on the first page and a half of The Power of Now. He was suicidally depressed. One page and out. The rest, “This is what I’ve learned,” and he delivers it. I often say to writers, for the books we publish, “Pretend you’re doing a seminar or even do a seminar. Do an online thing, do whatever.” You’re addressing your audience. Helping them out with what you know. You’re the coach, the therapist or whatever.\n\nIt’s not about you. That’s great advice, because a lot of people do get lost in their personal stories, and they don’t know how to crystallize it to, “This is what happened. Here’s the transformation, and this is for you.” I love that you’re saying that as well. I have to tell the story about how I got published over at your camp because it was so magical. I don’t know if you remember this story, but I was hosting a retreat and then my friend, Lara, who you work with. You guys had just started working together. She does great marketing at Bright Side.\n\nShe didn’t want to buy a car rental. She’s like, “Can you take me to my new client’s house?” She asked if I could drive her after I’m hosting this retreat to her new client’s house because she had never met you. I was like, “Of course,” but then she told me that you were a publisher. I was like, “I have a book.” Six weeks before that, I was trying to finish this book and I could not, for the life of me finish. I talked to the angels and I was like, “I can’t finish this. What’s going on?” Because I usually finish what I start. They said, “You need to find a traditional publisher.” I said, “Okay,” because I was going to self-publish. I peeked around and it didn’t go anywhere because I was busy.\n\nIt turns out we were going to your house, she wanted to go to your house. Because she didn’t want to get her own rental, she needed a ride. I get there, I looked at her and I’m like, “Lara I would love to tell him that I have a book but I can’t do it. I’m not one of those people.” She couldn’t do it and didn’t tell you either. We went in there and you were making us cappuccino. We were talking and you looked right at me and you said, “Do you have a book?” I said, “Yes, I do, Marc. Thank you for asking.”\n\nI vaguely remember that.\n\nIt was years ago, but that’s what happened. Honestly, Marc, I looked at you like I was super calm, cool and collected like, “Yes, Marc. I do happen to have one.” On the inside. I’m like a teen of cheerleaders doing backflips. Thank god someone said it because I couldn’t.\n\nThat’s one thing, we’re always looking for good books. As a publisher, it’s your new published books that keep driving the whole machine. You got to keep getting new books because there’s a backless decline factor they call it. It happens over the years. My CFO maps it all out. You need new titles.\n\nWhat’s another piece of advice as far as not just submitting a book but in finishing a book? What’s the best way to do that? Most people have at least a chapter or three pages of their book laying around.\n\nOne, definitely do one book at a time. I’ve had people submit three books to me. In fact, I had one woman submitted the same thing several times over the years. She has 84 books. I email back, “We publish one at a time. One for each author. We can’t publish three books of the same author the same season. They would hurt each other’s sales.” Stick with one and finish it. Cut the shit and do the thing. If you’ve started it. Finish it.\n\nThat’s the hard part for a lot of people. I know you have some author events coming up, and I would love for you to talk about what’s coming up in the future in case there are some authors out there.\n\nWe have a Summer Academy of Writing. That’ll be fun. An online thing that starts June 23rd 2020 where I’m having several good authors and writing teachers, and me talking about the whole process of writing. Starting, finishing, creating something worth publishing. That will be a lot of fun.\n\nHave you done this event before or this new for you?\n\nWe’ve done similar things on writing, but never with these authors. It’ll be different from what we’re doing. I love it because each week I deal with another author and teacher. They’re also different. It shows you everyone needs to find their unique voice and their unique way of writing. There’s no one way to do it all. It’s finding your own voice and your own way of working. Find out what works for you. It varies. Every one of the writers is completely different in their style, the number of hours they work, and the way they work. I love the variety of it.\n\nI know that your team invited me to come and do the Authors Forum, which is coming out on June 9th 2020, so that might be an opening or something. I’m excited to do that with you. Marc, I’m so grateful that you came to talk to our people and all the beautiful gems you laid out for us. Is there anything else that you want to share with our audience before we end?\n\nI always say the same thing. I encourage everyone to do what you love and go for it. Find a way to keep doing it. Don’t let those doubts and fears overwhelm you. Do not fear failure. Every successful person has failed. There’s nothing to fear in failure. Failure shows you what not to do next time and takes you on to the next step. Do not fear failure. You’ll never regret it. Even if you’re 95 years old, and you decide you want to be a billionaire rockstar, go for it. Get a guitar and learn to play. You probably won’t end up being a billionaire rockstar, but who knows what will happen? You’ll love it. Maybe when you’re 99-something, it will go viral. You’re never too old. Go for your dreams and you’ll never regret it.\n\nYou’re living it. You’re still doing your thing. You’re creative and changing things up all the time and staying in the flow. You’re such an inspiration and thanks again for letting me be an author at your amazing New World Library.\n\nThank you for writing a great book. I love your book. Dealing with you has just been delightful.\n\nThank you, Marc. We’ll see you soon.\n\nImportant Links:\n\nNew World Library\n\nMarc Allen\n\nShakti Gawain\n\nThe Power of Now\n\nDeepak Chopra\n\nThe Angel Experiment\n\nThe Magical Path\n\nThe Greatest Secret of All\n\nThe Millionaire Course\n\nVisionary Business\n\nReunion\n\nCreative Visualization\n\nWay of the Peaceful Warrior\n\nEnder’s Game\n\nSuccess with Ease\n\nOn The Magical Path\n\nBright Side\n\nAbout Marc Allen\n\nMarc Allen is an internationally renowned seminar leader, entrepreneur, author, and composer.
