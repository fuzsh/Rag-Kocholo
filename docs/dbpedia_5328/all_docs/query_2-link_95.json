        "text": "I was a poverty case for many years. It was kind of cool in my 20s, though when I hit 30, I decided to try to create some abundance in my life.\n\nMany of my old friends are still struggling financially, and recently I had long talks with two of them — and realized in a new, simple way what was keeping them trapped in their endless struggles with their finances. I came up with two simple things to do that can help them take a quantum leap in prosperity:\n\n(1) Clean up your debts.\n\nThe Chinese have it absolutely right: before each Chinese New Year, they have a great tradition of paying off all personal debt, so they start the year debt free.\n\nIt’s okay to have debt that you are managing to pay off. Long-term debts like mortgages or car payments, even student loans or credit cards are fine as long as you keep paying them down on schedule.\n\nThe kind of debt that hurts so many people is when they’ve borrowed money from friends or family — or anyone else — and are not paying them back. People hurt themselves emotionally and financially when they’ve agreed to make certain payments and have failed to do so.\n\nIf you’ve agreed to pay some person (or institution) a certain monthly amount and then defaulted on that, you are sending a powerful piece of programming — a negative affirmation, if you will — to your subconscious mind, saying in effect:\n\nI DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH. I CAN’T PAY MY DEBTS.\n\nI AM INCAPABLE OF KEEPING MY AGREEMENTS.\n\nHow can you possibly create a life of prosperity when you’re repeatedly telling yourself you’re incapable of it? It cannot be done. The solution is to clean up your debts: make new agreements with anyone you owe something to, and stick to those agreements. Even if you have to pay just a small amount per month, whenever you’re making a payment on time you’re sending another powerful piece of programming to your subconscious mind:\n\nI HAVE ENOUGH.\n\nI AM CAPABLE OF KEEPING ALL MY AGREEMENTS.\n\nI AM CLEANING UP MY DEBTS\n\nAND CREATING ABUNDANCE AND PROSPERITY IN MY LIFE.\n\nIf you’re going to miss a payment, contact the person you owe and re-schedule, so that you keep making these kinds of positive affirmations to your subconscious mind. You’ll find you’re fully capable of making every payment you have deeply committed to. And you’re on your way to a life of prosperity and abundance.\n\n(2) Affirm your way to wealth.\n\nThere’s nothing new in this second piece of advice. It’s been said millions of times. Our thoughts have creative power. The more we repeat expansive thoughts, the more expansive results we see in our lives.\n\nFind an affirmation or mantra or prayer or poem or song or anything else that works for you and repeat as often as necessary until you see the results in your life, and your affirmation is no longer necessary because it has become realized in your life.\n\nHere’s a few that worked for me:\n\nI AM SENSIBLE AND IN CONTROL OF MY FINANCES.\n\nI AM CREATING TOTAL FINANCIAL SUCCESS,\n\nIN AN EASY AND RELAXED MANNER,\n\nA HEALTHY AND POSITIVE WAY,\n\nIN ITS OWN PERFECT TIME,\n\nFOR THE HIGHEST GOOD OF ALL.\n\nI AM NOW TAKING A QUANTUM LEAP IN MY LIFE,\n\nEMOTIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY."
