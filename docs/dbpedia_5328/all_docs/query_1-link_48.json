        "meta_description": "A World that Works for Everyone with Marc Allen   In this episode, I have the pleasure of interviewing Author and Co-Founder/CEO of New World Library, Marc Allen. This interview was recorded several weeks ago, but the theme resonates just as authentically today: we are here to love, look out for, and serve each other.   We touch on what it means to be in business as an owner in alignment with purpose, creativity and flow, and how that extends to employees of every level in the company, allowing them to not only to feel valued and heard, but to think like an owner through the model of profit-sharing (and how models such as these can lead to a future of enlightened capitalism over blind capitalism).    Marc takes us on a journey in how to bring real magic into all areas of our lives through a series of exercises featured in his book, The Magical Path, and treats us to a short, grounding, guided meditation. Learn how looking after our spiritual, mental and emotional wellness is essential to living the life of our dreams and gives us the capacity to envision and take steps towards creating a world that works for everyone.  Marc Allen is an internationally renowned seminar leader, entrepreneur, author, and composer. He co-founded New World Library (with Shakti Gawain) in 1977 and has guided the company, as president and publisher, from a small start-up to its current position as a major player in the independent publishing world. He has written several books, including The Magical Path, The Greatest Secret of All, The Millionaire Course, Visionary Business, and others.   As a gifted speaker and seminar leader, Marc works with people around the globe to craft lives of lasting abundance and prosperity. His online programs include The Magical Path, Success with Ease, Visionary Business, The Power of the Feminine, and How to Get Happily Published. To learn more about his programs visit www.MarcAllen.com   For more about Chelley and lighthouse/haven, visit www.chelleycanales.com",
