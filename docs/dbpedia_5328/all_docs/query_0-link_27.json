        "text": "\"Thirty-five years ago, in the kitchen of a small apartment in Oakland, California, Marc Allen and Shakti Gawain started a publishing firm known as Whatever Publishing to put out a few books and booklets they had written. It was a shoestring operation, started with very little capital. Total sales in 1977 were $800. Their friend Sky Canyon came on board at the end of 1978, and was President and Publisher from 1979-1985. Under his leadership, the company grew and developed a solid international presence.\n\n\"Today New World Library owns its own spacious building in Novato, California, has eighteen employees, and generates eight-figure revenues. The company’s name changed in the mid-1980s to better reflect the quality of its developing list. One of its first books, Gawain’s Creative Visualization, became an international bestseller and has sold more than 3 million copies in English and been translated into more than thirty foreign editions.\n\n\"In the early 1990s, Shakti Gawain formed Nataraj Publishing, and Marc Allen became sole owner as well as publisher of New World Library. In 1998, Gawain and Allen, still close friends, formed a new working partnership, and Nataraj Publishing became an imprint published by New World Library.\n\n\"Many of New World Library’s books are categorized as New Age... we are publishing material that can show us how to create far better lives for ourselves (such as The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle) and a world that works far better (such as The Translucent Revolution by Arjuna Ardagh and The Power of Partnership by Riane Eisler).”...\n\n\"Between late 1993 and 1995, six books and six spoken-word audios were published under the Amber-Allen imprimatur. One of those books, The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success by Deepak Chopra, has gone on to sell more than 2.4 million copies in North America and has been translated into more than thirty foreign languages. It was on both the New York Times and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists for over eighteen months.\n\n\"In 2000, New World Library entered into a joint venture with H J Kramer, the publisher of such authors as Dan Millman (Way of the Peaceful Warrior), John Robbins (Diet for a New America), and Sanaya Roman (Creating Money). New World Library assumed responsibility for many functional areas of H J Kramer, including sales, marketing, subsidiary rights, fulfillment, production, and accounting. H J Kramer has continued to focus on author relationships and acquiring and developing new books, particularly new children's titles from Holly Bea....\n\n\"Nearly 70 percent of New World Library’s revenues are generated from its strong backlist, which includes books by Joseph Campbell, Eckhart Tolle, Jennifer Louden, Brother Wayne Teasdale, Riane Eisler, Echo Bodine, Mother Teresa, Richard Carlson, Alan Watts, Kent Nerburn, Christina Baldwin, Brad Warner, Daphne Rose Kingma, and, of course, Shakti Gawain and Marc Allen...\n\n\"New World Library will celebrate its 35th anniversary in 2012. Its success as a company is attributable to the continuing strong performance of Eckhart Tolle’s books The Power of Now, Practicing the Power of Now, and Stillness Speaks, with more than 3 million, 400,000, and 300,000 copies sold respectively. In 2001, New World Library worked with the Joseph Campbell Foundation to introduce the Collected Works of Joseph Campbell series. By the end of 2010, there will be thirteen books in this series. The revised edition of The Hero With a Thousand Faces, published in 2008, has already sold nearly 60,000 copies...\" [1]\n\nComplete Book Catalogue\n\nWeb: http://www.newworldlibrary.com\n\nResources and articles\n\nRelated Sourcewatch\n\nMedea Benjamin\n\nMarc Lesser\n\nMichael N.
