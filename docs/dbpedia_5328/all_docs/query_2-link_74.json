        "text": "As many of you know, meditation is something that I feel called to do but often resist doing. My soul constantly asks me to slow down and get still – to focus on my breath and live in the present moment. And while this sounds absolutely amazing in many ways, my mind usually wins out – explaining that I have about a million things to do and there just simply isn’t time for meditation.\n\nBut… still my soul persists. (It’s pretty determined to help me, thankfully.) And it continues to bring into my consciousness beautiful meditations to try. And each time I do, I always feel more centered, at peace, and more at one with all of life. My plan is to share some of these meditations here on Soul Speak from time to time. That way, if you’re also like me and could use this reminder to slow down and give yourself the gift of stillness, hopefully these will allow you a few moments to do exactly that!\n\nI was recently reading The Magical Path by Marc Allen. It’s a great book that offers powerful tools to help you reach your dreams. One of the tools that caught my eye was called the Middle Pillar Meditation, which is a powerful guided meditation to help align our energy centers, heal our body, and feel the magic that is always inside of us\n\nIn this video, Marc guides us through this meditation:\n\nI definitely recommend that you take a few moments out of your busy day, close your eyes, and let these soothing words seep into your soul. I know that for me, I always feel much more serene after I listen to it – much more able to go about my busy day.\n\nAnd that’s the thing with meditation, right? It doesn’t have to consume our entire life. It doesn’t have to be a big deal. It can just be a moment in time where we give our full attention to whatever it is that we’re doing. It can just be a few minutes where we consciously focus on our breath and consciously allow ourselves to notice – just notice – our thoughts. It can be that we listen to a guided meditation or chant along with our favorite mantra or remain fully present along our daily walk. Whatever it is, know that it’s exactly perfect. Know that each moment that you give yourself this awareness is such a beautiful gift.\n\nThat’s why I keep coming back to meditation. Because I always feel so much better and more aware and awake afterward. I wish that for you, too.\n\nPlease share the links to your favorite guided meditations below! I’m always looking for new ones.\n\nHappy meditating!\n\nHugs,\n\nP.S. – If you’re interested in reading more about the Middle Pillar Meditation, I definitely recommend Marc Allen’s book: THE MAGICAL PATH: Creating the Life of Your Dreams and a World That Works for All!\n\nHe presents a series of simple, powerful tools that anyone can use to find a short, effortless route to success and fulfillment. You will discover tried-and-true techniques that deliver quick results. In fact, these shortcuts to success are so simple, accessible, and effective that you will quickly call them magical."
