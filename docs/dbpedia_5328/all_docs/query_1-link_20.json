        "text": "Episode Summary\n\nCan anyone publish a book? Marc Allen, the publisher behind such bestselling books as Eckhart Tolle’s The Power of Now and Deepak Chopra’s The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success answers this essential question.\n\n7:15 Christine and Marc tackle the question: can anyone publish a book?\n\n8:55 Marc explains why he doesn’t just think anyone can get published but why they should publish a book.\n\nThe good news and the bad news is that anyone can get published. This makes the barrier of entry lower–and consequently, the competition more fierce. In this new playing field, should everyone and anyone publish their book?\n\n12:18 What kind of content will generate buzz?\n\nYou have to write something unique. But what does that actually mean?\n\n16:00 Marc explains why a lot of memoir-style stories don’t work.\n\nMemoirs don’t usually do well unless you are famous for something else. For this to work, you have to connect with the essence of your message and why it matters to your reader.\n\n21:05 As a publisher, Marc receives thousands of proposals a year. How does he choose which to publish?\n\nMarc talks about how to stand out from the crowd and get a publisher’s attention.\n\n24:42 Marc shares his advice on how to help you be an original in a crowded marketplace.\n\n28:16 Marc shares his greatest insight on what he looks for when deciding on who to publish.\n\nAbout Marc Allen\n\nMarc Allen is an internationally renowned author and president and publisher of New World Library, which he co-founded with Shakti Gawain in 1977.\n\nGuiding the company from a small start-up with no capital to its current position as one of the leading independent publishers in the country, Marc has shepherded some of the most influential non-fiction books of the past 30 years, including The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle, The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success by Deepak Chopra, and Creative Visualization by Shakti Gawain.\n\nMarc is the author of several life-changing books, including Visionary Business, A Visionary Life, The Millionaire Course, The Greatest Secret of All, and his most recent publication The Magical Path.\n\nAs a gifted speaker and seminar leader, Marc works with people around the globe to craft lives of lasting abundance and prosperity.
