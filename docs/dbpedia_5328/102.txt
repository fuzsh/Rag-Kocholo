Marc Allen is the owner of New World Library, publishing authors such as Shakti Gawain, Eckhart Tolle, Dan Millman and Christine Arena, he has had the honor of his company being named ‘Best Place to Work’. Regina had to find out more about the man who publishes thousands of enlightening books and what made him tick.

Marc’s story is so entertaining and educational and has him going from near bankruptcy to profitability while maintaining a happy crew of staff, suppliers and authors. In his own book, The Greatest Secret of All, he talks about how fear and love can be managed to make your dreams come true, in real, tangible, measurable ways and even those who think they are wandering artists (like Marc) can understand and apply the principles to live the life only they have dreamed of.
