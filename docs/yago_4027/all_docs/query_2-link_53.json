        "text": "Many will call “The Way” a spiritual film. (Heck, you can practically smell the incense burning inside the cathedral in Santiago de Compostelain). But writer, director and producer Emilio Estevez has a more universal target up his cassock, as his film speaks more to parents than to believers. It’s especially resonate for mothers and fathers who who have lost a child.\n\nA lovely film so moving you might shed more than a few tears, “The Way” tackles big themes – religion, death, self-acceptance – with small touches. Estevez smartly focuses his camera on his father, Martin Sheen as grief-stricken ophthalmologist Tom Avery. A recent widower, Tom is a man who has lived a cautious life. “Boring,” his son, Danny (Estevez) would say. Their relationship is a tempestuous, but bound by the unconditional love a parent feels for his child. Tom is irascible and impatient; Danny is a free spirit who tells his father: “You don’t choose a life, Dad, you live one.”\n\n“The Way” traces Tom’s story. He travels to Saint- Jean-Pied-de-Port, France, to fetch the remains after Danny suddenly dies while hiking the 500-mile pilgrimage called the Camino Santiago (The road of St. James) to Spain. Once he’s in possession of his son’s backpack and guidebook, Tom decides to complete the trek and spread his son’s ashes along the way. An admitted lapsed Catholic, his desire is for the journey to bring him closer to his son, not to God.\n\nClosed-off and cantankerous, Tom meets three fellow travelers, including a Dutchman (Yorick van Wageningen) with a hearty appetite for food, but clueless in life; an emotionally scarred, chain-smoking Canadian (Deborah Kara Unger); and an Irishman (James Nesbitt) with a serious case of writer’s block. They’re unlikely companions, but similar in that each has issues to work out along the way. None of them are particularly spiritual, yet they are seeking solace along the path that pilgrims have traversed for more than 1,000 years. Like a family, they forge a bond. Their exchanges range from playful banter to brutal honesty. At times, you expect them to lock arms and sing “We’re off to see the wizard ...”\n\nThe characters – including a priest they meet along the way (Matt Clark), a group of gypsies and a pious French cop (Tcheky Karyo), who explains what the journey means to Catholics – are all standards of the “road” picture genre. However, Estevez has assembled a likable group and his film never feels preachy.\n\nTom is a character Sheen could pull off on any given day. However, this performance – and he’s in nearly every scene – is natural and effective. And, given the real-life family dynamics (son Charlie Sheen’s troubles), Sheen’s work feels even more authentic. He doesn’t go straight for the jugular, but he gets there through nuance. And the pain in his eyes and on his face is palpable.\n\nPredictably, Tom discovers more about himself through coming to grips with his son’s death. As heavy as it sounds, Estevez has infused the film with lighter moments and never lets the sadness reach the dregs of melodrama. You feel a sense of warmth and comfort in Tom finding a sense of peace. You know that he’ll never totally get over the loss, but you know that he’ll soldier on and find his “Way.”\n\nDana Barbuto may be reached at dbarbuto@ledger.com."
