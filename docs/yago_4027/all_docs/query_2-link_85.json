        "text": "[image]\n\nMartin Sheen in \"The Way\"\n\nMartin Sheen and his son Emilion Estevez are on a journey across America promoting their new film about a different kind of journey.\n\nCalled \"The Way,\" the movie follows the father (played by Sheen) as he retraces his dead sons steps on the Camino de Santiago de Compostela. The son is played by Estevez, who also directed the film.\n\nOn Midmorning today, Estevez says in his mind \"The Way\" is in some ways loosely based on \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Like Dorothy, Martin Sheen's character meets a series of characters on his journey along the yellow-marked camino.\n\nMaking this movie was a personal journey for the actors, who have family history in Northern Spain.\n\nThe conversation was wide-ranging, including the nature of pilgrimages and personal discovery, Sheen's family history, acting, and of course Estevez and Sheen's father-son relationship.\n\nWhat didn't get discussed? Mention of Sheen's other son, Charlie, was noticeably absent from the conversation.\n\nYou can hear the hour by clicking on the audio link below:"
