        "text": "JennyH94 asked for some help in finding locations used in the film \"The Way\", starring Martin Sheen and directed by his son, Emilio Estevez. I put some answers on her post, but I thought it might help her and other \"tragics\" if I provided a list of all the locations I have been told or found by myself. In looking at the film in such detail, I found several occasions when the pilgrims (Tom, Joost, Sarah and Jack) were walking in the wrong direction. There are other scenes that occur in the wrong order. The well known one, Albergue Orisson, has been acknowledged by Estevez, who said that they noticed it too late, as the film had already been sent off to the distributors. I do not want you to think that I am criticising the film or ridiculing it. I enjoyed the film and felt it represented the Camino Francés pretty well. I walked the Camino Francés twice from StJPdP and the Arles route from Lescar before I saw the film. There are some question marks in bold in my list. If anyone knows where these locations are, I'd be pleased to hear from you.\n\nThe Youtube timings are in bold.\n\nSouth California Street, Ventura. round about #89 0:00:53\n\nPlaying golf at Real Club De Golf La Herrería, Ctra Robledo de Chavela, s/n, 28200 San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Madrid, Spain 0:2:32 - 0:4:22\n\nYes, Spain, and you all thought it was in California!\n\nMojón at San Antón 0:06:26\n\nCastrojeriz castle from the air 0:06:55-58\n\nRail station St Jean Pied-de-Port 0:08:18 - 0:9:01\n\nRestaurant Oillarburu on Rue d'Eglise, St Jean PdP (Thanks, Bradypus) 0:13:03 - 0:14:41\n\nHow come Daniel was travelling with two jackets, one blue, one yellow/orange? Obviously, for cinematic purposes, it looks better that Daniel and Tom are wearing different clothes. But everyone is told to pack light for a camino, so hardly anybody would pack a jacket while wearing another.\n\nToms knocks on the door of the house of Captain Sebastian, 55 Rue de la Citadelle, the Municipal Auberge in reality, 0:16:16. He stays outside until 0:16:38, when we see Daniel's coffin burning. At 0:16:45 the image merges with Daniel on the Camino in the Pyrenees\n\nThe burning coffin is seen again 0:16:58 - 0:16:59, filmed at the crematorium of Logroño.\n\nWhy did he go the wrong way when standing next to a pointer to Roncevaux? 0:17:07- 0:17:10\n\nI mean, I know it was misty (how did they arrange that?), but he was no more than a metre from the pointer.\n\nTom leaves Hotel Continental 0:18:45-19:14.\n\nCaptain Sebastian leads Tom to the wrong bridge 0:19:31 - 0:20:36.\n\nTom passes the Vierge d’Orisson (also known as the Virgin of Biakorre) 0:21:19.\n\nTom stops at the pointer where Daniel went perversely the wrong way and sees Daniel 0:21:54.\n\nGoat cheese for sale (Se vende queso de cabra) Calle San Cristobal, Mezkiritz . The house in the distance is #8 Calle San Cristobal 0:30:24 - 0:30:38.\n\nBy the fountain in Mezkiritz 0:30:38 - 0:43:44\n\nStone by side of road at Alto de Mezkiritz, 922 m above sea level 0:31:51 - 0:31:57.\n\n0:32:05 - 0:32:54 Tom and Jost are walking along a path, apparently towards Akerreta. But the path has a grass strip along the middle and the path from Larrasoaña to Akerreta does not have grass down the middle.\n\n0:32:54 The sign for the Albergue to the right, the Camino to the left.\n\n0:32:55 - 0:32:58 The view of Akerreta. This is not a view that can be seen from the path between Larrasoaña to Akerreta.\n\n0:33:43 Tom arrives at the albergue (Hotel Akerreta). the large white house behind him can be seen on Streetview.\n\n0:33:43 - 0:40:58 Tom at the Hotel Akerreta. He meets Sarah. He leaves at 0:40:58\n\nAlbergue Orisson 0:41:23 (out of sequence).\n\nScene at the bridge 42°47'14.8\"N 1°21'56.1\"W over the río Irati near Aoiz, just below the Itoiz reservoir, whose floodgates were opened specially for the shooting of this scene. 0:41:52 - 0:44:07 (off Camino Francés). The bridge seems to have been renovated since 2009 -- there is now no pole sticking up at the breakwater seen at 0:41:59 - 0:42:02, 0:42:08 - 0:42:22 and 0:42:23 - 0:42:28.\n\nPortal de Francia, entrance to Pamplona 0:45:14.\n\nThat's not the Portal de Francia, actually, it's the gateway before you get to the Portal de Francia.\n\nCaballo Blanco restaurant 0:45:14 - 0:47:42.\n\nPamplona town hall 0:47:43 - 0:47:56.\n\nZariquiegui 0:48:05 - 0:48:50 (\"Wears off quick, I promise\")\n\nAlto del Perdón 0:50:08 - 0:51:19.\n\nSanta María de Eunate (they are off Camino) glimpsed at 0:51:42 - and again at 0:52:56.\n\nIrache. A set-up for the film in the monastery. There would be no albergue with beds essentially in the open air. 0:52:56 - 0:54:07.\n\nThe three become four when they encounter Jack 0:54:39.\n\nI don't know where this is, and it could be anywhere.\n\nSansol (behind them) 1:03:59.\n\nEntering Torres del Rio at corner of Calle Desfiladero,according to Google Maps, but Calle Jesús Ordóñez according to the sign on the corner, and Calle la Fuente 1:04:09.\n\nJack knocks on the door of El Ramón's house, Casa Santa Barbara, [actually 21 Calle el Sepulcro] Torres del Río at 1:04:17. There is a good view of the house at 1:04:25 - 1:04:28. They walk in from 1:04:25 to 1:04:31.\n\nThe house is at Calle el Sepulcro 21, Torres del Rio. The actual albergue, Casa Santa Barbara, owned by Ramón Sostres, was a house in Calle la Carrera, still visible on Streetview in 2012, with a white number 8 on a blue background and a black number 6 on a white background over the door. The house has since been demolished.\n\nRoad out of Torres del Río 1:07:54 - 1:08:18 walking in the wrong direction on NA-7251.\n\nThey are walking away from Torres del Río, on a road that is not part of the Camino Francés (except perhaps for bicigrinos).\n\nThe church tower in the distance at 1:08:02 - 1:08:16 is Santo Sepulcro of Torres del Río. They are walking towards Sansol.\n\nThey spend the night at Ermita de San Juan, NA-7200, 42° 34' 21.70\"N, 2° 17' 45.92\"W. 1:08:19 - 1:12:22. (Thanks Raggy and Kathar1na)\n\nVillage in distance Bargota (Thanks, Rodrigo) 1:12:52.\n\nSarah sits by a large gate with two steps, at a café 1:09. The steps belong to the church at Bargota. There is no café there. The crew must have set up a few tables and chairs. Thanks (again) Rodrigo. 1:12:54 - 1:13:07\n\nThe four pilgrims are walking through a vineyard at 1:15:25 - 1:15:42. This vineyard is on the right bank of the Río Ebro, opposite the town of Briñas. They are way off the Camino Francés and have no reason to be walking through this vineyard, certainly not between the rows of vines.\n\nCVNE bodega, Haro (off Camino) 1:15:50 - 1:21:02.\n\nPolice station, Logroño, 1:21:03 - 1:21:29.\n\nChurch spire 1:21:31 church of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción in Briñas – thanks, Kathar1na – off Camino Francés.\n\nStatue of a saint in a niche, over the door of the church of Santa María de Palacio, Logroño 1:21:34\n\nPolice station, Logroño, again, next morning, presumably, 1:21:38 - 1:22:39\n\nJack waiting by the door of Santa María de Palacio, Logroño 1:22:40 - 1:22:42\n\nThey disappear into the Albergue de Peregrinos in Rúa Vieja, Logroño 1:23:20 - 1:23:28\n\nSteps and bollards 1:23:34 - 1:23:38 by the church of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción in Briñas -- thanks again, Kathar1na (way off the Camino Francés and north-east of Haro, so out of sequence)\n\nTosantos El Castaño Bar 1:24:02 - 1:24:11 (out of sequence)\n\nBriñas (off Camino) The section begins with a brief shot of a stone cross with a yellow arrow below it at 1:24:20 on Calle Solana. The next shot (1:24:22) is further back along the Calle Solana. A minute and a half later, the group passes the same cross at 1:25:50. The river is the Río Ebro. They are walking in the wrong direction, so they must have painted the yellow arrow themselves for the film. It is not there when you find the cross with Streetview (17 Calle Solana, Briñas). walking in the wrong direction on Calle Solana 1:24:20 - 1:26:40\n\nSign for El Rollo, Mirador del Ebro (off Camino), opposite the stone cross, 1:25:53\n\nThey pass a distinctive building on our right at 1:24:40, but at 1:24:42 they are back on the road leading up to that building and begin to pass it again at 1:24:52.\n\nTop of Arco de Santa María, Burgos, 1:26:47\n\nThey pass under the arch 1:26:50 - 1:26:57\n\nTom's rucksack stolen at Cafetería Rincón de España, Burgos, 1:28:12\n\nAt 1:28:33 the boy turns a corner and runs down Calle Llana de Adentro, Cervecería Rincón in the background. Either that boy was very, very fit, or Tom's rucksack was filled with helium!\n\nAt 1:28:37 Jack is in Calle Llana de Adentro.\n\nAt 1:28:39 Tom, Joost and Sarah are in Calle Llana de Adentro.\n\nThe only way out of Calle Llana de Adentro is through a tunnel into Calle Llana de Afuera.\n\nYet the boy manages to next appear at 1:28:38 on the opposite side of Calle Llana de Afuera, popping out of Calle del Cardenal Segura\n\nAt 1:28:42 the boy is running past some recycling chutes in Calle Llana de Afuera (they can be seen on Streetview).\n\nAt 1:28:43 the boy is running in the same direction along Calle Llana de Afuera, from a different angle, with the Bar El Monasterio in the background.\n\nAt 1:28:46 the boy runs down the steps of Calle del Cardenal Segura from the left . At 1:28:51 Tom starts running down the steps, coming from the right! The boy would leave Calle del Cardenal Segura at the place where we saw him 8 seconds ago.\n\nAt 1:28:55 the boy is running along Calle de Fernán González, behind the Cathedral.\n\nAt 1:29:01 Jost (the fattest and presumably most unfit of the three men), followed by Jack, is at the east entrance to Calle Arco de la Villa, in the University area, which is 2.6 km from where we last saw the boy!\n\nAt 1:29:04 Tom comes running to the entrance to Calle Arco de la Villa, but from a different direction from the other two.\n\nAt 1:29:06 Jost enters the open area while Jack and Tom are still under the archway.\n\nAt 1:29:08 we can see the arch at the west end of Calle Arco de la Villa. There is a large white and blue lorry (truck) (Ishmael's) visible behind the arch.\n\nThe chase ends 1:29:10 in Calle del Arco de la Villa in the University area.\n\nTom spins around, and at 1:29:17 the lorry has disappeared. At 1:29:26 it is back again. It is still there at 1:29:34. Sarah appears at 1:30:10.\n\nAt 1:30:43, the chase is over and they are back in the Rincón de España until 1:32:20.\n\nThe next scene is the party in Calle Arco de la Villa. 1:32:22 - 1:34:36\n\nHow did Jack and Jost know that they were in a gypsy area?\n\nLeaving El Parral, Calle San Amaro 4, Burgos, 1:34:37 - 1:36:44\n\nStick twirling 1:36:52 - 1:36:57.

I put some answers on her post, but I thought it might help her and other \"tragics\" if I provided a list of all the locations I have been told or found by myself. In looking at the film in such detail, I found several occasions when the pilgrims (Tom, Joost, Sarah and Jack) were walking in the wrong direction. There are other scenes that occur in the wrong order. The well known one, Albergue Orisson, has been acknowledged by Estevez, who said that they noticed it too late, as the film had already been sent off to the distributors. I do not want you to think that I am criticising the film or ridiculing it. I enjoyed the film and felt it represented the Camino Francés pretty well. I walked the Camino Francés twice from StJPdP and the Arles route from Lescar before I saw the film. There are some question marks in bold in my list. If anyone knows where these locations are, I'd be pleased to hear from you.\n\nThe original times are from my recording of the BBC broadcast and are only approximate (not to the second). Add between 1 and 4 minutes to get the times on the Youtube version.\n\nI've added some of the Youtube timings in bold.\n\nSouth California Street, Ventura. round about #89 0:00:53\n\nMojón at San Antón 0:06:26\n\nCastrojeriz castle from the air 0:06:55-58\n\nRail station St Jean Pied-de-Port 0:08:18 - 0:9:01\n\nRestaurant Oillarburu on Rue d'Eglise, St Jean PdP 00:12 -13 (Thanks, Bradypus) 0:13:03 - 0:14:41\n\nHow come Daniel was travelling with two jackets, one blue, one yellow/orange?\n\nWhy did he go the wrong way when standing next to a pointer to Roncevaux? 00:16\n\nTom leaves Hotel Continental 0:18:45-19:14\n\nCaptain Sebastian leads Tom to the wrong bridge 0:19:31 - 0:20:36\n\nTom stops at the pointer where Daniel went perversely the wrong way and sees Daniel 00:20\n\nGoat cheese for sale (Se vende queso de cabra) Calle San Cristobal, Mezkiritz .

What a terrific research job you’ve done here, with the help of other Forum members.\n\nI, and many other ‘The Way’ tragics here on the Forum ... you know who you are! ... will appreciate having this information to hand. It’s the perfect excuse to watch what I feel is the quintessential, and the best, Camino movie once again.\n\nCheers from Oz -\n\nJenny"
