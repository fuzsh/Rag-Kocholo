        "text": "Biscuit Media Group made the grand announcement today that fan favorite “THE WAY” is retuning to theaters for one day only! Ocean Avenue Entertainment, Elixir Films, E2 Films, and Fathom Events are teaming up to release the 2011 film starring iconic actor Martin Sheen and written and directed by his famous son Emilio Estevez.\n\nWhat is “THE WAY” about?\n\nBMG: THE WAY is an inspiring, entertaining and honest story about life’s challenges while navigating an ever-changing and complicated world. The film follows successful, yet irascible ophthalmologist Tom (Martin Sheen) who travels to St. Jean Pied de Part, France to recover the ashes of his adult son (Emilio Estevez) who perished during a storm in the Pyrenees while walking The Camino de Santiago. Tom decides to complete his son’s journey in an effort to better understand him, and to honor his commitment to complete the pilgrimage. As Tom walks the Camino, he reluctantly finds himself with three other pilgrims who are walking the road to find answers to their own personal dilemmas.\n\nThis new presentation, which releases on May 16th, 2023, will feature travel star Rick Steves in a discussion with Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez about their personal family life and the importance of their film today.\n\nEmilio Estevez had this to say about the film: “Now, as we are in a time where our lives are overwhelmed with the noise of technology and social media, grief from the pandemic, and lives running at a breakneck pace, more and more people are finding an interest in ways to step back, reflect, unplug, and breathe. People are discovering hope and healing in a thousand-year old pilgrimage. THE WAY is an extraordinary film that both Martin and I are immensely proud, passionate, and protective of. I am confident the re-release of the film will continue to inspire audiences to find a shared experience with other theatergoers; to laugh, to meditate, and inspire them to find their own Camino, and to remember that “life is too big to walk it alone.”\n\n“THE WAY” also stars Deborah Kara Unger, James Nesbitt and Yorick van Wageningen. Jack Hitt’s book “Off the Road: A Modern-Day Walk Down the Pilgrim’s Route into Spain” served as an inspiration for the movie.\n\nClick Here to learn more about “THE WAY” before it hits theaters on May 16th, 2023.\n\nA Special Thanks to Biscuit Media Group and Fathom Events to the info and image."
