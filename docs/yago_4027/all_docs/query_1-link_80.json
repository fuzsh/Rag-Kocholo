        "text": "You never know where a great idea might come from. And this doesn't bypass anyone, not Bryan Cranston nor Kubrick, the acclaimed film director, who was actively seeking ways to open his mind for new ideas. Kubrick, directed some of the greatest movies ever - The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, A Clockwork Orange A Space Odyssey. He's known for his meticulous and perfectionist approach to filmmaking, handed his doorman a copy of the script for his film \"Eyes Wide Shut\" and asked for his thoughts. After reading the script, the doorman reportedly told Kubrick that he thought the story was good but didn't understand the ending. Kubrick then reevaluated the script and wrote a whole new ending. Eventually, this movie was a huge success, considered by many to be one of his best movies. This anecdote is often cited as an example of Kubrick's open-mindedness and willingness to consider feedback from unexpected sources in his pursuit of perfection in his films. If opening our mind to unexpected perspectives is good enough for Kubrick and Bryan Cranston, I guess it's good enough for all of us:) __________________________________ For more interesting storytelling and video production insights follow: Blue Monkeys Productions Barak Shavit #creativity #videoproduction #digitalmarketing #storytelling #marketing Credit: @OutstandingScreenplays\n\nüëã Hello LinkedIn Community! I'm Alexei, from now on, I will start sharing my thoughts and recommendations here. Every Saturday, I plan to recommend films that have left a lasting impression on me. üé¨ Movie Recommendation: The Devil's Advocate Today I want to recommend, one of my favorite movies - \"The Devil's Advocate\", 1997. For this role, Al Pacino received the MTV Award - Best Villain. From my point of view, this is probably the best acting of the devil that Al Pacino has done, and really, the best acting throughout all his movies. Years ago, I watched this movie not in the original version, but now it's an incredible experience to watch his dialogues in original English - the translation can't capture the full power and intonation of Pacino's devil. The filmmakers clearly feared neither God nor the devil in their work on this film. Those who watched it, already know it, and those who have not watched it - just watch it. I first saw the film back in 1998, thinking it was an action movie, but I watched it in one breath, and the main phrase of this film has remained in my memory for the rest of my life. This phrase was uttered by the devil with a smile at the end of the film when it seemed that God had finally and irrevocably defeated Evil: \"Vanity... definitely is my favorite sin\" And it became clear that nothing was over, and the struggle between God and Evil would continue in the next round. The film is excellent from every perspective, and I believe everyone should watch it. As a mystical thriller, it's quite good, and Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino are fantastic together in this film. How to watch it? Watch it alone or with someone with whom you have already watched mystical thrillers before. As an addition, I would recommend taking cognac, a very good cognac, 50 grams, from which in the right glass you will drink during the entire film. Sometimes there will be magical overlaps between the taste of cognac and the plot lines of the film. #MovieRecommendation #AlPacino #TheDevilsAdvocate #WeekendVibes #CinematicMasterpiece\n\nWHAT AWAITS US THIS JANUARY 2024 FROM THE PLANS OF OUR AUTHOR DIANNA DIVERNO? It is primarily important to mention that the past year 2023 was a very fruitful year in her work, which revealed new business horizons and possibilities, but also presented our author as a writer and screenwriter to a somewhat wider audience. As many of her screenplays won beautiful film awards and accolades, it brought her to the point and the question ‚Äì how to sell multiple award-winning scripts? ‚Äì what are ''Samba To Death'', ''Last Wedding'' and ''Fatale Surveillance''? How to sell, to whom to sell and at what price are such scenarios sold? This now brings our author to a new business engagement, such as interviews, business meetings with film producers, presentation in video, audio and print form and presentation of everything acquired. As we had the opportunity to see, Dianna Diverno is presented as a multiple award-winning screenwriter recommended by the film industry in the world. A nice flattering compliment she has received in recent months has opened the doors of the film world in New York, Hollywood, London, Budapest, Cannes, Paris ... And although the author is still being asked to engage in the unproduced scripts of \"Lst Wedding\" and \"Samba To Death\" ‚Äì she is making a conscious business turn towards leaving the scripts now in the hands of film producers. Not so much because the scripts are not successful, on the contrary, we are convinced that she would win all film festivals with them, but it is again a procedure that would last forever. Now we are expecting her media engagement and interviews for some festivals such as Cannes Film Awards, Hollywood Gold Awards, London Movie Awards, then for some magazines such as Cinemawide Magazine, some newspaper editions in U. K and Hungary, and others ... It is interesting that there are now some scenarios in play, such as \"Fatale Surveillance\", but also some that do not require too much financial investment in their production. So we hope that January and Februar 2024 will be focused on presentations of the above-mentioned scenarios. It must also be noted that the scripts are based on books that were written around 2009. So we wouldn't be surprised by the book promotion in the U.K. or some other country\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/ggMbfMBD \"Like most of Kurosawa‚Äôs films, Rashomon, based on two stories by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, is set during a time of social crisis‚Äîin this case, the eleventh century in Japan, a period that Kurosawa uses to reveal the extremities of human behavior. As the picture opens, three characters seek shelter from a driving rainstorm (it never sprinklesin a Kurosawa film!) beneath the ruined Rashomon gate that guards the southern entrance to the imperial capital city of Kyoto. As they wait for the storm to pass, the priest (Minoru Chiaki), the woodcutter (Takashi Shimura), and the commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) discuss a recent and scandalous crime‚Äîa noblewoman (Machiko Kyo) was raped in the forest, her samurai husband (Masayuki Mori) killed by either murder or suicide, and a thief named Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune) arrested. When Rashomon played in Venice and then went into international distribution, it stunned audiences. No one had ever seen a film quite like this one. For one thing, its daring, nonlinear approach to narrative shows the details of the crime as they are related, through the flashbacks of those involved. Kurosawa gives us four versions of the same series of events, through the eyes of the woodcutter, the thief, the woman, and the spirit of the husband, each retelling markedly different from the others. Kurosawa‚Äôs visionary approach would have enormous cinematic and cultural influence. He bequeathed to world cinema and television a striking narrative device‚Äîcountless movies and television shows have remade Rashomon by incorporating the contradictory flashbacks of unreliable narrators. But Rashomon is that rare film that has transcended its own status as film, influencing not just the moving image but the culture at large. Its very name has entered the common parlance to symbolize general notions about the relativity of truth and the unreliability, the inevitable subjectivity, of memory. In the legal realm, for example, lawyers and judges commonly speak of ‚Äúthe Rashomon effect‚Äù when firsthand witnesses confront them with contradictory testimony.\"\n\nRecently, I watched a fascinating interview with Quentin Tarantino that sparked some introspection about my film-watching habits. As many of you know, I used to work in TV commercial set design. This experience taught me that every object on screen is carefully chosen to enhance believability and character depth. This attention to detail extends to all aspects of filmmaking, creating layers of meaning that aren't always apparent on first viewing. Discussing this with my mother, I mentioned that I often watch important films multiple times. She was surprised, wondering if I got bored. The truth is, some of my favourite films didn't resonate with me initially. \"The Usual Suspects,\" \"Once Upon a Time in America,\" \"Dune,\" and \"Avengers: Endgame\" are just a few examples. For me, the first viewing can be overwhelming - there's so much to process visually and narratively. The second viewing, however, is when I truly relax and enjoy the experience. It's an opportunity to catch nuances, appreciate the craftsmanship, and fully immerse myself in the story. Interestingly, Tarantino mentioned that he doesn't value opinions from those who've only seen a film once. This got me thinking: How do you approach film watching? Do you revisit films for a deeper appreciation, or do you prefer the one-and-done approach? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Do you find value in rewatching films, or do you see it as unnecessary? Let's discuss in the comments! #Filmmaking #CinemaAppreciation #MovieDiscussion\n\nI know we're supposed to be \"solely professional\" on here, but I cannot stay silent about this. To be clear, I don't subscribe to the kind of blanket statement hot takes I see in contemporary film analysis online, nor will I take preference to only one kind of film genre as \"true\" cinema at the exclusion of all else. I will engage with the nuance of EVERY KIND of story that can be told. To only prefer one genre is to be close-minded, as far as I'm concerned. But the issues facing the industry at present, which I think are perfectly encapsulated by this video from a recently emerging indie filmmaker near the release of his first film, are scary. The close-mindedness AND lack of basic awareness about audience buying trends and interests, among those currently making decisions about which films get made -- and where they get released -- is genuinely terrifying. I won't pretend to be presently capable of articulating such phantasmagorical fears about the industry's future in a clear or concise manner, but at the very least I cannot be silent about it. Because I don't merely want to make movies. I NEED to make movies. It is a literal chronic need. It is as essential to me as oxygen or water. To not be able to do that is equivalent to the feeling of starvation. Every second I am not able to do that, or work towards doing that, is the most physically and mentally painful anguish imaginable. It means that much to me. And seeing every existing available door into that art form close to new filmmakers, and even supposedly \"cemented status\" filmmakers, is terrifying. As absurd as I know it this will sound tomorrow, long after I've already said this, it genuinely makes me question if this art form has a future. Especially when there are already so few stories in it, and even fewer storytellers in it, who look or sound like me. Those are the storytellers being banished the most in this present state of release trends. That cannot continue. Unless EVERY story that is capable of being told gets told, this art form will cease to be a legitimate one."
