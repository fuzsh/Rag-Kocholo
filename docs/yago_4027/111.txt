Emilio Estevez is getting serious.

The star of the "Mighty Ducks" films directed, produced and starred with father Martin Sheen in the new life-after-Vietnam film "The War at Home.""I'm not feeling very funny these days," Estevez says in the Nov. 29 issue of Entertainment Weekly.

Estevez said comedies such as "Mighty Ducks and "Stakeout" made him rich, but "I was at a point in my career where I was in an artistic free fall," he said. He said when he heard about James Duff's 1985 play "Home Front," something clicked.

"I thought, `I've got to do this as a film.' I felt like I needed this for my spirit. I was just desperate."
