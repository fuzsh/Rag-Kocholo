        "text": "Early Life: Childhood and Education (1809-1831) DateEvent(s) 1809 Charles Darwin was born Feb. 12 at Shrewsbury, England, the son of Robert Waring Darwin (1766-1848), a country physician and grandson of Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802), also a physician and author of works in biology that presented a proto-evolutionary perspective. 1817Death of Darwin's mother 1817-18Attended Rev. Case's Unitarian day school at Shrewsbury. 1818-25Attended Dr. Butler's boarding school at Shrewsbury 1825-27Sent to Edinburgh University in Scotland, to study to become a physician, continuing the tradition of his father and grandfather. Here Darwin met and studied with Robert Grant (1793-1874), a defender of Lamarckian evolution. Darwin was especially interested in natural history, but little inclined to medicine. Darwin remained at Cambridge for two years (sessions). 1826Darwin's first papers read before the Plinian Society, a scientific society of students at the University. 1828-31Darwin was sent by his father to Cambridge, where he was to study for the clergy. Darwin was more interested, however, in beetle collecting than theology. Darwin passed his baccalaureate exam in Dec. 1831, and continued one more term in the college, studying geology.\n\nVoyage of Discovery: On Board the Beagle (1831-1836) DateEvent(s) 1831-36Darwin was invited by Capt. Robert Fitz-Roy (1805-65) to be unpaid naturalist aboard the H. M. S. Beagle, about to begin a five year circumnavigation of the globe. Darwin's main research was done during visits to South America and to the Galapagos Islands off the coast of Ecuador. 1832The Beagle visits St. Jago, and island of the Cape Verde archipelogo (Jan. 16), crosses the Equator (Feb.14th) , and arrives (Feb. 29th) at Bahia, Brazil. From the end of February until it sailed from Rio on July 5th, Darwin travelled in Brazil, encountering slavery for the first time. In Dec. the Beagle arrived at Tierra del Fuego. The boat had on board three natives of that area, who had been brought to England by Fitz-Roy on a previous expedition. 1833The Beagle visited Argentina, and Darwin spent some time on land at and around Buenos Aires. The Beagle revisted Tierra del Fuego, where the natives it had released there had returned to their local customs. 1834The Beagle, having completed the charting of the east coast of South America, passed into the Pacific (June 9). While investigating the Andes near Santiago, Darwin became ill (Sept. 19), probably through an insect bite. It is speculated that the tropical disease he acquired at this time may have haunted him for the rest of his life. 1835The Beagle arrived at Galapagos Island, off the coast of Ecuador (Sept. 7), where Darwin made many observations and collected specimens which later served as evidence for his theory of evolution by natural selection. The Beagle then made call at Tahiti and New Zealand. 1836The Beagle arrived at Australia (Jan. 12) and set sail for England (March 14), arrving back on Oct. 2nd. Darwin had been away from home five years, and would never leave England again."
