        "text": "Darwin, Charles Robert\n\n(b. The Mount, Shrewsbury, England, 9 February 1809; d. Down House, Downe, Kent, England, 19 April 1882)\n\nnatural history, geology, evolution.\n\nDarwin was the fifth child and second son of Robert Waring Darwin, a successful and respected physician practicing in Shrewsbury, and Susannah Wedgwood, daughter of the potter Josiah Wedgwood I. The Darwin family was characterized by the high intellectual quality of its members, prosperity, industriousness, professional ability, and wide cultural interests.\n\nDarwin’s education was begun by his elder sisters after the premature death of his mother. In 1817 he was sent to a day school at Shrewsbury, where he was found to be slow at learning. In 1818 he was entered at Shrewsbury School under Dr. Samuel Butler (grandfather of the author of Erewhon). He afterwards complained he was taught nothing but classics, a little ancient history, and geography. “The school as a means of education to me was simply a blank.” This statement is perhaps unfair in that his grounding in the classics probably helped him afterwards to think so devastatingly straight. But his headmaster rebuked him publicly for wasting his time on chemical experiments, and his father upbraided him with the remark, “You care for nothing but shooting, dogs, and ratcatching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all your family.” He was removed from Shrewsbury School in 1825 and sent to Edinburgh University to study medicine.\n\nDarwin stayed at Edinburgh until 1827, attending courses of lectures on materia medica, pharmacy, chemistry, and anatomy, which he found unbearably dull. But worst of all were his experiences attending operations, performed perforce without anesthetics. These repelled him to such an extent that he rushed out and vowed that medicine was no career for him. The chief advantages that he gained from his stay at Edinburgh were his friendship with Robert Grant, zoologist, who accepted Lamarck’s teachings on evolution; geological excursions with Robert Jameson; and expeditions onto the Firth of Forth to collect marine animals.\n\nConfronted with the necessity of starting his son on a new line of endeavor, Darwin’s father sent him to Cambridge as a preparation for entering the Church of England as a clergyman. At that time, he accepted the Articles of Faith, and perfunctorily attended lectures, but his three years at Cambridge he thought “wasted as far as the academical studies were concerned, as completely as at Edinburgh and at school.” But he there made the acquaintance of Adam Sedgwick, who interested him in geology, and, most important of all, John Stevens Henslow, who fired him with a passionate interest in natural history and inspired him with a friendship that gave him confidence in himself, after his discouragement in his own family, at school, and at Edinburgh. Henslow acted as a second father to young Darwin during this critical, formative period in his life, which was climaxed by the voyage of the Beagle.\n\nAfter taking a poor degree at Cambridge in 1831, Darwin was at home when he received an invitation, instigated by Henslow, to join the Admiralty survey ship H. M. S. Beagle, under the command of Robert FitzRoy, as unpaid naturalist on a voyage to survey the coasts of Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego, Chile, and Peru; to visit some Pacific islands; and to carry a chain of chronometrical stations around the world. Darwin wished to accept at once, but his father objected. Darwin’s uncle, Josiah Wedgwood II, thought the objection unreasonable and persuaded his brother-in-law to withdraw it. Darwin sailed on the Beagle on 27 December 1831.\n\nThe five years of the voyage were the most important event in Darwin’s intellectual life and in the history of biological science. Darwin sailed with no formal scientific training. He returned a hard-headed man of science, knowing the importance of evidence, almost convinced that species had not always been as they were since the creation but had undergone change. He also developed doubts of the value of the Scriptures as a trustworthy guide to the history of the earth and of man, with the result that he gradually became an agnostic. The experiences of his five years in the Beagle, how he dealt with them, and what they led to, built up into a process of epoch-making importance in the history of thought.\n\nOn 29 January 1839, Darwin married his first cousin, Emma Wedgwood, daughter of the Josiah Wedgwood who had saved his place in the Beagle. At first the young couple lived in London, but ill health began to attack Darwin shortly after his marriage. He found himself increasingly handicapped by great lassitude, nausea, and intestinal discomfort, which made it impossible for him to lead a normal life with social and academic contacts. The Darwins therefore moved to the country, fifteen miles from London, to Down House, in the village of Downe, in Kent. There Darwin had a garden, a small estate about which he could walk, spare rooms for the few friends who were occasionally invited to stay, a study where he could work, and peace and quiet.\n\nHis ill health gradually restricted him to a routine of four hours’ work a day, walks in the garden, visits to the greenhouses, occasional walks in the neighborhood or rides on a pony, interspersed with periods of rest on a sofa while reading a novel. Dinner was followed by listening to the piano and then early bed.\n\nAs his physicians could not discover any organic cause for Darwin’s ill health, the idea gained ground that he was a hypochondriac, and in recent years some psychiatrists have attempted to show that he was of a neurotic disposition, but the evidence is not wholly satisfactory. Following the suggestion of Saul Adler, a pathologist expert on South American infections, other commentators note that Darwin was heavily bitten in the Argentine by the Benchuca, the “black bug of the pampas,” Triatoma infestans, 70 percent of which are now reckoned to be vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas’ disease. As this trypanosome was not discovered until 1909, Darwin’s doctors would have been unable to find an organic cause for his trouble; but the clinical picture found in sufferers from Chagas’ disease matches Darwin’s symptoms in detail. The parasite invades the muscle of the heart causing lassitude; it also invades the nerve cells of Auerbach’s plexus in the wall of the intestine, upsetting peristalsis; and it invades the auricular-ventricular bundle of the heart, interference with which may cause heart block. It has unpredictable periods of latency, after which it can be recovered from blood of patients infected many years before. Darwin suffered heart attacks and died from one. Whether in addition Darwin showed neurotic tendencies, accepting the overcare which his wife bestowed on him and taking advantage of his semi-invalidism to protect himself from the distractions of society and amusement, will never be known.\n\nDarwin and his wife had ten children, of whom three died in infancy or childhood. The healths of the survivors (all of whom lived to ripe ages), and their launching in life, gave him anxiety. He once wrote that his chief worries were the discovery of gold in California and in Australia, “beggaring me by making my money on mortgage worthless”; the French coming by the Westerham and Sevenoaks roads, and, therefore, enclosing Down; and, third, “professions for my boys.” His fears were groundless. His investments were very profitable, Napoleon III did not invade England, and his sons made careers for themselves of which any father could be proud: Sir George Darwin, mathematician and astronomer; Sir Francis Darwin, botanist; Leonard Darwin, engineer and promoter of eugenics; and Sir Horace Darwin, scientific engineer and founder of the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Co. These men, their children and grandchildren, like their father and ancestors, provide material for Galton’s theory of the inheritability of intellectual eminence.\n\nDarwin’s contributions to science fall into three main groups: geology, evolution and natural selection, and botany.\n\nDarwin as Geologist. When Darwin sailed in the Beagle, the most commonly accepted theory in geology was that of catastrophism, which held that the forces which had produced change during the past history of the earth had been on a far greater scale than any which are active today. When geologists had concluded that stratified rocks had originated as beds of sediment laid down beneath the sea, they had then been obliged to explain how the sedimentary strata had been raised up from the sea bottom to form hills and mountains, and how they had been shifted from the horizontal position, in which they must originally have been deposited, to the inclined or even vertical positions in which they are now so often found. There were two possible explanations: (1) that the sea had formerly stood at a higher level and had in fact extended over the whole earth’s surface, or (2) that the strata had been upraised and disturbed. By 1831 most geologists had rejected the idea that the sea had formerly covered the whole earth, but when they tried to imagine forces capable of raising rock strata from the bottom of the sea to form hills or ranges of mountains, it seemed to them that such changes would necessarily involve tremendous convulsions of the earth’s surface. Furthermore, they saw a link between periods of convulsion and upheaval in the history of the earth and changes in animal life. They concluded, naturally, that a convulsion of the earth’s surface tended to destroy many species of animals and that when the convulsion had subsided new species were created to replace those that had been lost.\n\nIn the view of the catastrophists, there had been in the history of the earth a succession of creations of animal and plant life. Each creation had survived during a period of relative tranquillity of the earth’s surface, but had later been destroyed in a catastrophic disturbance and upheaval. The history of the earth therefore included periods of tranquillity interrupted by catastrophes, and each catastrophe was followed by a new creation. The catastrophic theory of geological history was reconciled to the account of creation in the Bible by supposing that the most recent catastrophe had been the flood of Noah. Many fossil animals were therefore characterized as antediluvian, or from before the flood. Geologists also supposed that the successive creations were of a progressively higher order which culminated finally in the creation of man.\n\nSince the time of the flood the surface of the earth had been fixed, stable, and unchanging and the whole system of nature tranquil and orderly. The modern order of nature, catastrophists thought, was so very different from that which had existed throughout most of the history of the earth that little could be inferred of past events from present conditions.\n\nThe catastrophist viewpoint, firmly held by such English geologists as William Buckland, William Daniel Conybeare, and Adam Sedgwick, was challenged in 1830 by Charles Lyell in his Principles of Geology. Lyell had concluded that strata could be elevated from the bottom of the sea by the repeated action of earthquakes continued over long periods of time. In Italy and Sicily he had found recently elevated strata in the neighborhood of active volcanoes and in an area where severe earthquakes had occurred frequently throughout historic time. He showed to his own satisfaction that the strata had been elevated very gradually over an immense period of time, instead of by a single convulsion, and then went on to investigate how far the phenomena of geology might be explained by the various forces observable on the earth’s surface today. With great success he showed that the ordinary action of rain, running water, and the waves of the sea was sufficient to explain the wearing down of land and deposition of sediments, whereas the ordinary, long-continued action of volcanoes and earthquakes was sufficient to elevate continents and mountain ranges.\n\nWhen Darwin sailed in the Beagle, he had with him the first volume of Lyell’s Principles of Geology (1830), which he had been advised to read but on no account to believe. That is, however, exactly what Darwin did, because he satisfied himself that Lyell’s views accorded with the facts: the first step in the making of a man of science possessed of critical judgment.\n\nSantiago in the Cape Verde Islands provided Darwin’s first material for geological study. By applying Lyell’s principles, he quickly unraveled the history of the island. From the clear exposure of the rocks on the coast he saw that the oldest were crystalline and volcanic. Overlying them was a bed of limestone containing shells of marine organisms of Tertiary date, sixty feet above sea level and twenty feet thick. This bed, Darwin reasoned, had been deposited in a shallow sea and had since been raised to its present height; the island had undergone subsidence and then elevation. Above the limestone was more recent volcanic rock which had altered the uppermost limestone and baked it; evidence of metamorphism in situ.\n\nSt. Paul’s Rocks in mid-Atlantic enabled him to make acquaintance with an island which he correctly recognized as being of neither volcanic nor coralline origin; it is regarded today as an exposed portion of the mantle of the earth. But it was South America that presented itself as a model for his observational and interpretative skill. By comparing lavas of undoubted volcanic origin with igneous rocks of the Andes, he saw that they were closely related. He found that minerals in granites and in lavas were in all respects similar, and he showed a perfect graded series between crystalline granites and glasslike lavas. By observing the direction of strike and the angle of dip of strata, he found that the planes of foliation in schists and gneisses and the planes of cleavage in slates remained constant over areas stretching hundreds of miles, while their planes of inclination could vary greatly. Foliation planes and cleavage planes were parallel to the direction of the great axes along which elevation of the land had taken place. This was directly contrary to the then accepted views put forward by Sedgwick and by Lyell, and Darwin was able to prove that foliation and cleavage are not original phenomena dependent on the deposition of the strata, but had been subsequently superimposed on the beds by pressure, resulting in recrystallization in the case of foliation. He observed clay slate passing over into gneiss as it approached granite, which showed how homogeneous rocks could develop foliation by metamorphosis. Darwin’s demonstration of the origin of metamorphic rocks by deformation and of the distinction between cleavage and sedimentary bedding was a major contribution to geology.\n\nThe west coast of South America was an equally fruitful geological laboratory for Darwin. He was a witness to the earthquake that devastated Concepción and saw that it had resulted in an elevation of the land by several feet. He was further able to make out a connection between elevation of the land and neighboring volcanic activity because at the time when the land rose near Concepción a number of volcanoes in the Andes renewed their activity, and a new volcano beneath the sea erupted near Juan Fernandez. All these facts were shortly to be woven into an unexpected pattern.\n\nBy observing that the shells in beds raised to heights of as much as 1,300 feet belonged to species still living, and in proportions of species similar to those in the ocean, Darwin was able to prove, as Lyell had in Sicily, that such elevation was recent. In the Andes, at a height of 7,000 feet, he found a fossil forest of trees in situ (i. e., not drifted from elsewhere) because their trunks projected several feet perpendicularly from the stratum in which they were embedded, which was itself overlaid by thousands of feet of sedimentary deposits alternating with volcanic lavas. This showed that the trees had been buried thousands of feet beneath sea level as the deposits accumulated, and had since been raised to their present height. Here was proof of extensive subsidence as well as elevation.\n\nBeds containing shells that had been raised up were far fewer and much less extensive than low-lying beds, and Darwin found that this was due to the erosion that constantly attacks land surfaces and destroys deposits. This fact had a bearing on estimations of the age of the earth, because while the time taken for a deposit to be formed can be roughly gauged, it is impossible to tell how long an interval of time has gone by while the beds were eroded. This means that the nonconformities between geological formations may represent much longer periods of time than the formation of the beds themselves, and that the age of the earth must be vastly greater than was then imagined.\n\nFrom these findings, Darwin was led to consider what are the most favorable conditions for the accumulation of beds many thousands of feet thick containing fossils, such as are found elsewhere. He concluded that it could only have been when a slow subsidence continually lowered the bottom of a shallow sea, so that the depth of that sea below sea level remained fairly constant. These conditions further imply that such a sea was near to continental land, from which erosion brought down the material spread out in the deposits. Proof of this was obtained in observation of beds south of Valparaiso, 800 feet thick, containing shells of animals which when alive lived in shallow water, not more than 100 feet deep. The lowest beds of the deposit must have lain 700 feet higher than at present when the first shells became embedded, and as subsidence started the deposits continued and kept pace with the drop of 700 feet. Another bed showed evidence of the same process involving a subsidence and deposits of 6,000 feet. The various conditions required for such accumulations of fossils can only have been met occasionally and at particular localities in the history of the earth, from which it follows that the fossil record must be expected to be erratic and incomplete.\n\nAnother line of study to which Darwin was led by his expeditions in the Andes was the change in climate which regions must have undergone, both in geological time and during the life of man. This followed from observation of deserted houses, abandoned by Indians, up to the snowline in places now quite uninhabitable because of lack of water and fertility. This connection between geological phenomena and life was further developed in his studies of coral reefs.\n\nWhile in South American waters, Darwin had never seen a coral reef, but he knew that atolls in their myriads all over the oceans are about at sea level, and that the coral polyps which build them can live only in waters less than 120 feet deep and at temperatures above 20°C. The theory of the origin of atolls, or lagoon islands, developed by Lyell, was that they were formed on the rims of submarine volcanic craters. Darwin quickly saw that such a hypothesis was untenable, and he put forward his own deductively. There must have been a foundation for the corals at a depth not exceeding 120 feet. It cannot be imagined that there were innumerable submarine mountain ranges with their summits all exactly at this height; therefore, they must have been brought to the required level by subsidence, and he found evidence for it in drowned villages in the Caroline Islands. This has since been confirmed by deep borings at Funafuti, at Bikini, and at Eniwetok, where evidence has been found of over 4,600 feet of coral rock produced by shallow-water organisms during prolonged subsidence.\n\nIn addition to atolls or lagoon-islands, there are also barrier reefs, like the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, which is known to have been erected by coral polyps on the down-faulted coastal edge of northeast Australia. Darwin observed a third type of coral reef, the fringing reefs or shore-reefs that surround an island which projects high above the sea, and these reefs are often found lifted above sea level. Fringing reefs are therefore the result of coral action on platforms that are either stationary or have undergone elevation. With all this evidence, Darwin drew a map. He found that large zones of the Pacific Ocean have atolls and barrier reefs and have undergone subsidence, while other zones, parallel to these, have fringing reefs and have undergone elevation. Now the most extraordinary correlation with these facts, bearing in mind Darwin’s observations of the connection between land elevation and volcanic activity, was the distribution of active volcanoes in the Pacific: all of them are situated in the zone of fringing reefs, not one of them in the zone of atolls or barrier reefs. Darwin’s book on Coral Reefs, published in 1842, still remains the accepted explanation, except for a slight addition in the form of R. A. Daly’s glacial control theory. This is based on the fact that during the recent Ice Ages, the amount of water immobilized in icecaps reduced the level of the oceans by 150 feet, which would have exposed the atolls to the air and cut down their height by wave-action. But when the Ice Age came to an end and the sea level rose again, the platforms were there for coral polyps to make new atolls.\n\nThe evidence which Darwin obtained in South America and in atolls for changes of sea level was later responsible for leading him into error. In 1838 in attempting to explain the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy in Scotland, Darwin imagined that the land had sunk by over 1,000 feet and that the so-called roads were marine beaches. In 1862 it was shown by T. F. Jamieson that the glaciers of Ben Nevis had dammed back the waters of a lake, the level of which dropped twice as outlets were formed, and that the roads were lake beaches. Darwin admitted defeat in words which have an important message for all scientific research workers: “How rash it is in science to argue because any case is not one thing, it must be some second thing, which happens to be known to the writer…. My error has been a good lesson to me never to trust in science to the principle of exclusion”.\n\nDarwin’s trilogy of geological books was completed by the publication in 1844 of Volcanic Island, and at the end of 1846 by Geological Observations on South America. The supremacy of the position which geology occupied in Darwin’s mind shortly after his return from the voyage of the Beagle is shown by the order of subjects in the title of the first edition, published in August 1839, of his Journal of Researches into the Geology and Natural History of the Various Countries Visited by H. M. S. Beagle. In the second edition, published in August 1845, natural history and geology have changed places. The reason for this is to be found in the progressive orientation of Darwin’s mind toward the problem of evolution.\n\nEvolution and Natural Selection. When Darwin sailed in the Beagle, he had no reason to call in question the accepted view that the species of plants and animals alive on earth were as they had always been since the creation. It was only gradually that doubts began. They arose from four kinds of evidence. The first was that in some areas species had become extinct. Darwin himself had found gigantic fossil armadillos (and other forms) in South America; but armadillos of similar but not identical form also live in South America. This meant that “extinct animals have a close relation in form with extinct species.” Why was this?\n\nSecond, in adjacent areas of South America, Darwin found one species replaced by different, although very similar, species. On the pampas he observed and collected specimens of the South American ostrich (rhea), but when he went farther south into Patagonia, he found a very similar but smaller species (Rhea darwinii). But why were the two species of rheas built on the same plan, different from that of the African ostriches? Why were the agoutis and vizcachas of South America built on the same plan as other South American rodents and not on that of North American or European hares and rabbits?\n\nThe third doubt was evoked by the fact that inhabitants of oceanic islands tended to resemble species found in the neighboring continents; African-like species in the Cape Verde Islands, South American-like species in the Galápagos archipelago. At the same time, although the geological and physical features of the Cape Verde and Galápagos Islands are very similar, their faunas are quite different. Why was this?\n\nFinally, the different Galápagos islands, identical in climate and physical features, and very close to each other, might be expected to have identical species, but they had not. On different islands he observed that the finches characteristic of the Galápagos group differed in structure and food habits. Some ate insects, others ate seeds, and their sizes and their bills differed in relation to their diets and mode of life. Darwin suspected that they were only varieties of a single species. The local inhabitants could also tell at sight from which island any of the giant tortoises had come. Was all this arbitrary and meaningless or could a pattern of meaning be discerned?\n\nThe answer gradually came to Darwin: All these questions, and many more, could be rationally answered if species did not remain immutable but changed into other species, and diverged, so that one species could have given rise to two or more. It is because they had a common ancestor in South America that fossil armadillos resemble living armadillos, that agoutis resemble capybaras, and that the Galápagos birds resemble South American birds, while the Cape Verde birds resemble African birds with which in each case they had a common ancestor. But why did the finches and other birds of each Galápagos island differ from one another? “One might really fancy that, from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends,” Darwin wrote. These “ends” are very important; they fit the animals for their mode of life, they are adaptations; and the isolation of each species on each island plays an important part.\n\nGradually, only a few months after his return to England, these ideas began to crystallize in Darwin’s mind: “Animals, our fellow brethren in pain, disease, death, suffering and famine—our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusements—they may partake of our origin in one common ancestor—we may be all netted together.”\n\nIn July 1837 Darwin started writing down his ideas at random in his Notebook on Transmutation of Species. He soon found that if change of species had occurred, there was a ready explanation for a number of otherwise arbitrary and inexplicable facts. Why are the bones of the arm of a man, the foreleg of a dog and a horse, the wing of a bat, and the flipper of a seal built on the same general plan, with the different bones corresponding, each to each? Why are young embryos of lizards, chicks, and rabbits so similar to each other, while their adults are so distinct? Why do some animals have useless rudiments of organs? Why do particular regions of the earth have their characteristic plants and animals? Why do organisms fall into groups, namely, species, that may be arranged in larger groups, namely, genera, that in turn may be arranged in still larger groups, namely, families, and so on? Why is there this apparent relationship of species instead of a random distribution of forms across the whole field of possibilities? Why do more or less similar organisms behave in similar ways? For instance, why do both horses and men yawn; why do both orangutans and men show emotional distress by weeping? Why do fossils in early geological formations differ greatly from those living today, while those from more recent formations differ only slightly?\n\nAll these questions could be meaningfully answered if species were related by descent from common ancesters, but not otherwise. It is important to note Darwin’s form of argument. He never claimed to demonstrate the change of one species into another, and in his letters constantly repeated that he was tired of impressing this fact on his readers and critics; all that he claimed was that if evolution has occurred, it explains a host of otherwise inexplicable facts. But after he had satisfied himself that evolution had occurred, he kept his views to himself because he saw the great obstacles that lay ahead. Evolution he already saw as the change that species undergo in relation to their adaptation to their environment. A woodpecker differs from other birds in that it has two claws of its feet directed backward, with which it secures a firm grasp on the trunk of a tree, stiff tail feathers with which it supports itself against the tree, a stout bill with which it chisels a hole in the bark, and a very long tongue which it projects through the chiseled hole to extract the grubs beneath the bark. The woodpecker must have evolved these adaptations. How?\n\nIn considering this question of how evolution might have occurred, Darwin noticed that the cultivation of plants and the domestication and breeding of animals, both of which man has practiced since the Neolithic period, were the result of selection. Man deliberately chose the parents of the next generation of his plants and animals, to perpetuate and improve the qualities in them which he required. But how did, or could, selection operate in nature, where there had been no man to direct it, since the beginning of life on earth? Darwin had already observed that some species are better adapted than others to life in particular environments, and thus are likely to leave more descendants, while the less well adapted may diminish and become extinct (Notebook 1, MS. p. 37, notebook finished in February 1838). In other words, he had already grasped the principle of natural selection before he saw how it was enforced in nature.\n\nThe solution to this problem came to him on 28 September 1838 when he read Thomas Robert Malthus’ Essay on the Principle of Population. Malthus, whose whole line of thought was tinged with opposition to the principles of egalitarianism displayed by the French Revolution, argued that since the potential rate of increase in man was geometrical, and that his population could double in twenty-five years, while the increase of available foodstuffs could not increase so fast, there was bound to be misery, poverty, starvation, and death among the poor unless the rate of population increase in man was checked by war, famine, disease, or voluntary restraint (which would diminish the incentive to work among the poor).\n\nMalthus, therefore, demonstrated the relentless pressure which human populations, by their boundless tendency to grow, maintain on their requirements for life whatever the level of their resources may be. If the food supply and other requirements for life can be increased, a population will tend to grow until its growth presses against the limits of the enlarged supply of food. Malthus also observed that in many countries the population did not grow and much of his book is taken up with a study of the means by which the numbers of people were limited in different countries. These ranged from exposure of infants, infanticide, and the intermittent reduction of the population by famine in China, to delayed marriage and strict sexual morality in Norway. But Malthus was able to show that in every country the tendency of a human population to grow was under some form of severe and continued restraint.\n\nDarwin pounced on the argument and applied it, not to man, but to plants and animals in nature, and saw that they are in no position to increase their food supplies, but must die if they outstrip them by their own numbers. Here were the sanctions that made natural selection work.\n\nLike most flashes of genius, it was very simple, and T. H. Huxley said later, “How extremely stupid not to have thought of that.” It marked a turning point, not only in the history of science, but in the history of ideas in general, for there is no field of human intellectual endeavor that has not been influenced by the thought and fact of evolution. By good fortune, the note that Darwin scribbled down immediately when the flash struck him has been preserved. It is of such importance that it deserves quotation:\n\n28th [September 1838] We ought to be far from wondering of changes in numbers of species, from small changes in nature of locality. Even the energetic language of De Candolle does not convey the warring of species as inference from Malthus. Increase of brutes must be prevented solely by positive checks, excepting that famine may stop desire. In Nature production does not increase, whilst no check prevail, but the positive check of famine and consequently death. I do not doubt every one till he thinks deeply has assumed that increase of animals exactly proportionate to the number that can live.\n\nPopulation is increase at geometrical ratio in FAR SHORTER time than 25 years, yet until the one sentence of Malthus no one clearly perceived the great check amongst men. There is [a] spring, like food used for other purposes as wheat for making brandy. Even a few years plenty makes population in man increase and an ordinun crop causes a dearth. Take Europe, on an average every species must have same number killed year with year by hawks, by cold etc. even one species of hawk decreasing in number must affect instantaneously all the rest. The final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out proper structure, and adapt it to changes, to do that for form which Malthus shows is the final effect (by means however of volition) of this populousness on the energy of man. One may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying to force every kind of adapted structure into the gaps in the oeconomy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones.\n\nThis passage, in which Darwin’s thought penetrates through a jungle of ideas, following on his reading of Candolle’s description of the war of nature and Malthus’ book, is remarkable for a number of reasons. In the first place it pinpoints the notion that evolution does not take place in a vacuum, but each individual, if it is lucky, lodges in its fortified position in the economy of nature, in what is now called its ecological niche, in dynamic equilibrium not only with the physical factors of the environment, but with the other living organisms of the habitat. It is because Darwin recognized this fact so clearly that he can be reckoned as the founder of the science of ecology.\n\nSecond, this passage shows that evolution is not a process that goes on in single individuals, or even in Paris, but which proceeds in populations and consists of some individuals becoming better adapted, under the pressure of natural selection, which is the third lesson of this passage. Ernst Mayr has pointed out that one of the most important recent advances in biology has been the realization that the real units are populations, which have objective existence, and not types (which are only imaginary abstractions), and that Darwin was more responsible than anyone else for the substitution of “population-thinking” for “typological thinking.” The change to a different species is nothing but a by-product of the process of a species becoming better adapted, after a certain point of divergence has been reached. The explanation of the fact of divergence itself is foreshadowed in the passage. As Darwin later wrote, “The more diversified the descendants of any one species become in structure, constitution and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature.” Again, it is the ecological niches which supply the key to the problem.\n\nDarwin’s argument can be formulated as follows: (1) The numbers of individuals in species in nature remain more or less constant. (2) There is an enormous overproduction of pollen, seeds, eggs, larvae. (3) Therefore, there must be high mortality. (4) All individuals in a species are not identical, but show variation and differ from one another in innumerable anatomical, physiological, and behavioristic respects. (5) Therefore, some will be better adapted than others to their conditions of life and to the ecological niches which they could occupy, will survive more frequently in the competition for existence, will leave more off-spring, and will contribute most of the parents that will produce the next generation. (6) Hereditary resemblance between parents and offspring is a fact. (7) Therefore, successive generations will not only maintain but improve their degree of adaptation to their modes of life, i.e., to the conditions of their environments, and as these conditions vary in different places, successive generations will not only come to differ from their parents, but also from each other and give rise to divergent stocks issuing from common ancestors.\n\nThis is the formal theory of evolution by natural selection, which recent observation and controlled experiment have proved to be correct in all cases. What modern biology has done is to provide answers to the two questions which, in the state of knowledge of his time, Darwin could not answer: what is the nature of hereditary transmission between parents (and grandparents, and so forth) and offspring? And what is the nature of the origin of heritable variation? Without heritable variation, natural selection could achieve nothing. In Darwin’s day, no clear distinction was made between what was heritable and what was not, and few doubted the inheritance of characters acquired by a parent during its own life.\n\nThe problem was completely solved (unknown to Darwin, or to the world before 1900) by Gregor Mendel, who proved that the basis of inheritance takes the form of particulate characters, distributed between parents and offspring in accordance with a simple law (since proved by cytology and the behavior of chromosomes) known as Mendel’s law of segregation. The inception of a heritable novelty was a sport, now known as a mutation, a random, nonadaptive change in the chemical structure of a particular character, now known as a gene. The application of Mendelian genetics to Darwinian selection was effected by the work of J. B. S. Haldane and Sir Ronald Fisher by 1930. Since then the synthetic theory of evolution by natural selection has been generally accepted by biologists. It is remarkable that even without the knowledge that these advances represent, to say nothing of those achieved in comparative biochemistry, serology, parasitology, and cytogenetics, Darwin was nevertheless able to construct a coherent theory which made general acceptance of evolution possible—and a mechanism to account for it, namely, natural selection. Although long considered inadequate, natural selection is now proved to be the basis for biological change and for the production of all the diverse structures and functions of living organisms.\n\nShortly before Darwin died, his son Leonard asked him how long he thought that it would be before positive evidence of natural selection would be forthcoming. Darwin replied, about fifty years. It was a remarkably accurate forecast, for it was in the 1930’s that Sir Ronald Fisher showed how expression of a gene, in the form of the bodily character that it controls, is itself the effect of selection. Shortly afterward, E. B. Ford demonstrated that mimetic resemblance in butterflies is adaptive, confers survival value, and originates from heritable variation. The researches of H. B. D. Kettlewell on industrial melanism in moths, P. M. Sheppard and A. J. Cain in snails, T. Dobzhansky on geographical races of fruit flies, and A. C. Allison on sickle cell in man have provided experimental evidence not only of natural selection but of the pressure at which it works, and have permitted actuarial estimates of the longevity of different genetic types. This follows the mathematical studies of Sir Ronald Fisher, Sewall Wright, and J. B. S. Haldane on the effects of selection at different intensities on the composition of populations.\n\nStudies on what B. Rensch has called “ring-races” has shown species in the act of splitting into new species, in gulls, tits, and salamanders, when geographical isolation of portions of populations enables them to evolve independently of each other, so that they become adapted in different directions and eventually no longer interbreed. This speciation is what T. H. Huxley regarded as necessary for the final confirmation of Darwin’s views.\n\nPaleontology has been a trap for biologists and others who have neglected David Hume’s warning that the existence of a state of affairs does not in itself justify conclusions on how it came about.\n\nDarwin claimed that the fossil record, as known to him, was compatible with evolution; but that if fossils ever provided any evidence contrary to his theory, such, for instance, as to prove that the Cambrian fossils were the first organisms that ever lived, or that a mammal was “created” later than those earliest known mammals of the Stonesfield Slate of the Jurassic period, his theory of evolution must be abandoned. However, he never adduced any evidence from fossils to bear on the problem of the principle of natural selection.\n\nAlthough the recognition of fossils as former living beings goes back four centuries, it is only recently that paleontology has come into its own as a science, largely as a result of the researches of George G. Simpson. Fully aware that the mechanism of evolution can be interpreted only in terms of genetics, ecology, selection, and population studies, Simpson has shown that evolutionary sequences previously claimed as “straight” are not straight at all. For example, the evolutionary history of the horse has followed a zigzag course, first in the direction of many-toed browsers on leaves, then in that of many-toed grazers on grass, and finally in that of one-toed grazers on grass. In general the horse increased in size, but some species became smaller. Each lap of the course can be correlated with the environmental conditions of the period: soft or hard ground, leafy or grassy (siliceous) vegetation. At all times the trend has been toward favorable adaptations, to ecological niches which paleontologists are now in a position to describe; in other words, it has been compatible with the requirements of natural selection and has been opportunistic and devoid of any predetermined program. Furthermore, the rate of evolution, now measurable by radioactive dating, is not correlated with variability, nor with fertility (years per generation). In this manner, Simpson has been able to show that natural selection under changing environmental conditions accounts for evolution, and explains why in terrestrial forms evolution has generally been rapid, while in marine forms it has been slow or stationary.\n\nIt is regrettable that Darwin in later years allowed himself to be persuaded to accept Herbert Spencer’s inappropriate expression “survival of the fittest.” This stresses survival when the important thing is the greater fecundity of the better adapted; it emphasizes a superlative “fittest” when it is the slightest comparative superiority of adaptation that confers advantage. It lays the subject open to the taunt of tautology: Who survive? The fittest. Which are the fittest? Those who survive. This is a form of argument which neglects entirely the fundamental fact that forms better adapted to their environment leave more offspring. Finally, the phrase conveys no inkling that the automatic choice exerted by nature in ramming the better adapted variants into their ecological niches is the efficient cause of adaptation. It was not the first (or last) time that so-called philosophers of science have encumbered scientists with their help.\n\nAfter Darwin had developed his new theory of the origin of species by natural selection in 1838, he did not publish it, or even discuss it with his friends. In 1842 he drew up a rough sketch of his argument, which in 1844 he expanded into an essay but never published. In 1845 when he had finished preparing for publication the results of his geological work on the Beagle voyage, he put the species question aside and started on eight tedious years’ study of the structure and classification of living and fossil barnacles. In the course of this work he acquired firsthand knowledge of the amount of variation that is found in nature, and he also made a striking discovery, that of complemental males, small parasitic males found under the mantle of larger hermaphrodite or female individuals.\n\nAfter his return to England in 1836 Darwin became close friends with Charles Lyell and Joseph Dalton Hooker. They did not accept evolution, which was known to them only in the form of Lamarck’s exposition. Lamarck’s views were in many ways similar to those of Erasmus Darwin, who posited that there was a “natural tendency” to perfection, and the “inner a feelings” of an animal caused it to provide the organs required to meet its needs. In 1844 Robert Chambers published Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, which only brought the subject into disrepute by its amateurish ignorance.\n\nIn April 1856 Darwin described his theory of natural selection to Lyell, who urged him to write a book describing his views on species. He began the work in the summer of 1856. On 18 June 1858 Darwin received a letter from Alfred Russel Wallace containing a perfect summary of the views which he had worked out during the preceding twenty years. Thanks to Lyell and to Hooker, Darwin’s and Wallace’s papers were read together before the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858 and published on 20 August of that year.\n\nDarwin then set about writing an “abstract” of his larger work, and On the Origin of Species was published on 24 November 1859. The fat was then in the fire. Old-fashioned biologists protested that Darwin indulged in hypotheses that he could not prove (and he did not pretend to prove them). Theologians were aghast at two consequences of Darwin’s work; the first was that man and the apes must have had a common ancestor, which dislodged man from his privileged position as created by God in his own image. The second arose from the consideration that if Darwin’s views on the origins of plants and animals, including man, by natural selection were true, then much of the argument for the existence of God based on the presence of design in nature was destroyed. The theologian William Paley had argued that highly specialized and coordinated adaptations, such as the tongue, beak, claws, and tail of the woodpecker, or the human hand, manifested a complex design which required one to postulate the presence of a designer in nature. If, however, these same adaptations could be accounted for by natural selection acting on random variations, a designer was no longer needed. Since natural theology, as represented by Paley, had enjoyed enormous influence in England, the destruction of its very foundations was greeted with dismay and outrage.\n\nMatters came to a head at the celebrated Oxford meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science on 30 June 1860, when the Reverend Samuel Wilberforce, bishop of Oxford (who knew little of natural history but was coached by the anatomist Richard Owen, who was jealous at what he felt already was Darwin’s ascendancy over himself), twitted Darwin’s friend Thomas Henry Huxley with the question whether it was through his father or his mother that he claimed descent from an ape. Huxley replied that he was not ashamed to be descended from an ape but he would be ashamed of an ancestor who used great gifts and eloquence in the service of falsehood. Wilberforce was annihilated by Huxley and Hooker, and Darwin’s views on evolution started their conquest of the world. In the United States, Darwin’s friend, the botanist Asa Gray, had already won a victory over the anatomist and paleontologist Louis Agassiz, who was never able to accept Darwin’s theory.\n\nAfter the Origin of Species, Darwin wrote three more books expanding different aspects of the work. The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication (1868) took up in detail that subject which had been confined to one chapter of the Origin. It contained his hypothesis of pangenesis, by means of which Darwin tried to frame an explanation of hereditary resemblance, inheritance of acquired characters, atavism, and regeneration. It was a brave attempt to account for a number of phenomena which were beyond the bounds of scientific knowledge in his day, such as fertilization by the union of sperm with egg, the mechanism of chromosomal inheritance, and the development of the embryo by successive cell division. His hypothesis of pangenesis could not therefore give a permanently acceptable account of the multitude of phenomena it was designed to explain. It was, however, a point of departure for particulate theories of inheritance in the later nineteenth century.\n\nDarwin’s next book, The Descent of Man (1871), filled in what was only adumbrated in the Origin. T. H. Huxley and W. H. Flower had shown already that the body of man differs less from that of an ape than the latter does from that of a monkey. It is important to remember that Darwin never claimed that man was descended from apes, but that man’s ancestor, if alive today, would be classified among the Primates, and would be even lower in the scale than the apes. Man and apes are subject to similar psychological and physiological processes in courtship, reproduction, menstruation, gestation, birth, lactation, and childhood. At early stages of embryonic development the human fetus has a tail, inherited from ancestors who not only had a tail as embryos but also as adults and were quadrupedal. Darwin wrote, “The time will before long come when it will be thought wonderful, that naturalists, who were well acquainted with the comparative structure and development of man and other animals, should have believed that each was the work of a separate act of creation.”\n\nHaving proved his point with man’s body, Darwin then turned to the most difficult aspect, man’s mind. Here he showed that the gap, however enormous between man and the highest animal, is not unbridgeable, by the principle of gradation. Man shares with animals the urge to self-preservation, sexual love, maternal affection, paternal protection, and the senses of pleasure, pain, courage, pride, shame, excitement, boredom, wonder, curiosity, imitation, attention, and memory. As for the moral sense, Darwin concluded that it, also, arose gradually, through evolution, and that any animal endowed with social instincts, which man’s ancestors undoubtedly possessed, would acquire a moral sense as soon as its intellectual powers had developed (by natural selection) to an extent comparable with those of man and was able to appreciate the survival value of collaboration and mutual affection. Borrowing from Marcus Aurelius the view that social instincts are the prime principles of man’s moral constitution, Darwin concluded that these, with the aid of intellectual powers and the effects of new tradition and habits, would lead naturally to the Golden Rule: “As ye would that men should do to you, do ye to them likewise.”\n\nIn this book Darwin added an essay on a related subject: sexual selection, the preferential chances of mating that some individuals of one sex (usually the male) have over their rivals because of special structures, colors, and types of behavior used in courtship displays, leading them to leave more offspring and accentuate their characters: for example, antlers in deer, trains in peacocks, feathers in birds of paradise, color in sticklebacks. There is no need to assume a power of aesthetic choice in either sex; the characters act as sexual stimulants, real aphrodisiacs, so that mating follows more quickly, occurs more often, and there are more progeny. In man, there can be no doubt that the differences between the sexes in respect of distribution of hair on face and body and of fat in local accumulations under the skin are the result of sexual selection.\n\nDarwin did not explain how the preference of females for particular structures, colors, and courtship displays was related to natural selection, although female preferences themselves must be subject to natural selection. Perhaps Darwin’s greatest contribution in this area was to show that secondary sexual characteristics had evolved in relation to a complex pattern of reproductive behavior, which must itself be the product of natural selection.\n\nThe last of Darwin’s books in this series, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), contains studies of facial muscles and means of expression in man and mammals, emission of sounds, erection of hair, and so forth, and their correlation with suffering, sobbing, anxiety, grief, despair, joy, love, devotion, reflection, meditation, sulking, hatred, anger, pride, disdain, shame, surprise, fear, horror, acceptance (affirmation), and rejection (negation). With this book Darwin founded the study of ethology (animal behavior) and conveyance of information (communication theory) and made a major contribution to psychology.\n\nBotanical Works. From the first Darwin interested himself in adaptations of plants to cross-pollination. He found that trees (with countless flowers) tend to have flowers of one sex, while small plants have hermaphrodite flowers, and he showed that the unisexuality of trees would tend to prevent self-pollination. He concluded that “flowers are adapted to be crossed, at least occasionally, by pollen from a different plant.” Here was a general principle which must have a wide meaning, and he set out to study it. His attention was first directed to orchids, which have elaborate adaptations for cross-pollination, making the bees that visit their flowers carry away the pollen sacs with them and pollinate the next flowers that they visit. His book on the Fertilization of Orchids (1862) showed that plants are in no way behind animals in the marvels of the adaptations that they show. Darwin further observed that flowers that are pollinated by wind have no colors; it is only those that are pollinated by insects that have bright colors in their petals and sweet-smelling nectaries.\n\nPresently Darwin noticed that in some species flowers differ by the lengths of their anthers and styles, like the primroses, which show two conditions, or loosestrife, which shows three. This is also an adaptation for cross-pollination, and these observations formed the basis of Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species (1877). The problem continued to fascinate him, and he raised two large beds of seedlings of Linaria vuglaris, the one cross-pollinated and the other self-pollinated, all from the same plant. “To my surprise, the crossed plants when fully grown were plainly taller and more vigorous than the self-fertilized ones.” Darwin had experimentally discovered and demonstrated the fact of hybrid vigor, or heterosis, which is completely explained by Mendelian genetics. These experiments, conducted over twelve years on fifty-seven species, led to the publication of Effects of Cross and Self Fertilization (1876). The demonstration of the advantage that accrues from cross-fertilization explains not only why sexual reproduction (as distinct from asexual budding) increases heritable variation (through recombination of genes), but also reveals the basis for the survival value conferred by the existence of different sexes in a species. This adaptation (for that is what it is) is a very old one, for it was inherited by plants and animals before they diverged from one another.\n\nDarwin’s interest in climbing plants was not that of a systematic botanist but an attempt to discover what adaptive value the habit of climbing has. He found that “climbing” is a result of the process of nutation; the apex of the plant’s stem bends to one side while it grows and the plane of the bend itself revolves, clockwise or counterclockwise, so that the apex describes circular sweeping movements. In the hop plant—in hot weather, during daylight hours—it takes a little over two hours for each revolution. If the growing stem hits nothing, it continues to circle; if it hits an object it wraps itself around it by twining, Twining thus enables a young and feeble plant, in one season, to raise its growing point and leaves much higher from the ground, with more exposure to sunlight and air, without expending time and energy in the synthesis of woody supporting tissues. There is a further delicate adaptation here; a twining plant will not twine around an object larger than approximately six inches in diameter. This adaptation prevents it from climbing up a large tree, where it would be deprived of air and sun by the tree’s own leaves.\n\nSome plants climb by a modification of this method and have stalks and leaves that clasp other objects, and intermediate forms show that leaf-climbers evolved from twiners. In others, such as the Virginia creeper, the leaf tendrils end in little discs full of resinous fluid which anchor the plant to its support. These researches were described in Climbing Plants (1875).\n\nThe behavior of climbing plants and the bending of their shoots led Darwin to investigate the mechanical cause of such bending. The fact that a stem bends toward the light because it grows faster on the unilluminated than on the illuminated side of the stem had been known for some time. By means of simple but ingenious experiments, Darwin showed that the tip of the shoot was sensitive to light and that the bending was caused by growth of the stem on the side away from the light but some way down from the apex. Furthermore, this growth was due to a substance that comes down from the apex, “some matter in the upper part which is acted upon by light, and which transmits its effects to the lower part.” From these researches and experiments (reported in Power of Movement in Plants, 1880) has sprung the whole science of growth hormones in plants.\n\nDarwin’s chance observation of the number of flies caught on the leaf of the common sundew (Drosera rotundifolia) was the starting point for a series of observations and experiments which showed not only how insects are caught, but how their bodies are digested and ingested, and what the significance of this carnivorous habit is for the life of the plant. By feeding one bed of sundew plants with meat and depriving another bed, he found that the fed plants had larger leaves, taller flowerstalks, and more numerous seed capsules. This remarkable adaptation, which insures survival of the plants, explains why sundew plants, which have very few roots, through which only small supplies of nitrogen can be obtained, can live on extremely poor soil. Darwin was particularly impressed by the fact that the living cells of plants possess a capacity for irritability and response similar to that of the nerve and muscle cells of animals. His work on Insectivorous Plants was published in 1875.\n\nDarwin’s last book connected with plants was The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms (1881). This was published only six months before his death but covers a subject that he had studied for more than fifty years. He showed the services performed by earthworms in eating leaves and grinding earth in their gizzards and turning it into fertile soil, which they constantly sift and turn over down to a depth of twenty inches from the surface, thereby aerating it. He calculated from the weight of worm-castings that on one acre in one year’s time eighteen tons of soil are brought up to the surface by worms. This was a pioneer study in quantitative ecology.\n\nDarwin was elected to fellowship of the Royal Society in 1839 at the age of twenty-nine; three foreign universities awarded him honorary doctorates; and fifty-seven leading foreign learned societies elected him to honorary or corresponding membership—the French Academy of Sciences only in 1878, for his views have never been really appreciated in France. The Prussian government awarded him the highly coveted Ordre pour le mérite, but from the British sovereign and the British government he never received any recognition. His demonstration of the fact of evolution, and of the automatic mechanism of natural selection which causes it, was unpalatable to the orthodox views of the Church of England. When he died, however, twenty members of Parliament asked the dean of Westminster to allow his burial in Westminster Abbey, an honor which was readily granted. Darwin himself would have been highly amused, for, with his genial sense of humor he once said, “Considering how fiercely I have been attacked by the orthodox, it seems ludicrous that I once intended to be a clergyman.” At his funeral there were present not only his friends Hooker, Huxley, and Wallace, but also James Russell Lowell, the American ambassador, as well as diplomats representing France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Russia.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nI.

He was the next to youngest child in a family of four sisters and an older brother. His father, Robert Darwin, was a physician of imposing presence and severe character. His paternal grandfather, Erasmus, had also been a doctor by profession. By avocation, however, Erasmus Darwin was a naturalist, whose Zoönomia, a disquisition in verse on the course of nature, has usually been considered, quite incorrectly, to have been an anticipation of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution. Darwin’s maternal grandfather was Josiah Wedgwood, founder of the pottery firm and friend of Erasmus Darwin in the Birmingham scientific circle known as the Lunar Society. Darwin belonged, in short, to a provincial family of means and intelligence which associated itself with the professions, intellectual pursuits, and commerce. Although his father expected him to choose a profession, he never needed to earn a living. In 1839 Darwin, too, married a Wedgwood, his cousin Emma. The seven (of ten) children who survived infancy and their descendants have sustained the notable literary and scientific tradition which distinguishes the family.\n\nOriginally intended for medicine in his turn, Darwin detested the study of it at the University of Edinburgh. His father allowed him to move to Cambridge, with a view to his becoming a clergyman. At both universities the hobby of natural history absorbed him. He read; he collected beetles and prepared specimens; he went on geological and entomological forays. He might have become a clerical naturalist like Gilbert White, whose Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne had charmed him in boyhood. Instead, a decisive opportunity intervened. In 1831 he was offered the (unpaid) post of naturalist aboard H. M. S. Beagle, then outfitting for a voyage to collect geographical information. This was to be no mere trip around the world. The expedition lasted five years. It was the making of Darwin as a scientist, and it cost him his health. Sir Gavin de Beer’s biography has established the strong probability that the chronic physical prostration which debilitated Darwin throughout the rest of his life was the manifestation of Chagas’ disease, a malady identified only in 1909, which involves infestation of the heart muscle and intestines by Trypanosoma cruzi. These bacteria are carried by the great black bug of the pampas, benchuca (Triatoma infestans), and while in Peru Darwin recorded having watched with careful interest one of these insects biting his finger and engorging itself on his blood.\n\nDarwin returned to England in 1836. On the Origin of Species appeared in 1859. In the interval of over twenty years Darwin published descriptive accounts of the zoological and geological findings of the voyage. His Journal of Researches in 1839 was followed by a series of geological treatises: one on coral reefs in 1842, a second on volcanic islands in 1844, and a third on South America in 1846. These writings won him the reputation of an accurate, thorough, and reliable naturalist. In the early 1850s he published in four volumes a complete study of fossil and living barnacles. Here his work was that of a descriptive biologist of great finesse, capable also in experimental inquiry. Meanwhile, he was quietly maturing his views on evolution, these too deriving from observations and reflections started on the voyage of the Beagle.\n\nTheory in biology. The theoretical originality of Darwin’s central work is more difficult to appreciate than its content is difficult to understand. On the Origin of Species does not on the face of it read like a book animated by theory, either abstruse or abstract. Paragraphs follow one out of another setting forth evidence for the mutability of animals. That notion was not in itself a new one. Intimations and even evidence of the transformation of species had often before been adduced—by Lamarck, by Darwin’s grandfather, and by many others. Certainly Darwin marshaled his materials with a fidelity to fact and a range of relevance that proved telling. Nevertheless, what was original was not the assertion but the explanation of evolution in the theory of natural selection. For that theory constituted a new notion of biological order. Although Darwin’s mundane style tended to obscure its novelty, the Origin is in fact a work of theory; it changed the way of seeing the phenomena of life.\n\nPrior to the assimilation of Darwin’s work, no consensus existed about the mode of biological explanation. Only in the early nineteenth century did biology as a professional discipline emerge from the combination of the tradition of natural history with that of the medical or mechanistic study of anatomy and physiology. In Darwin’s youth two distinct traditions governed the modeling of theory—the one organismic and the other teleological. The former arose in eighteenth-century romantic feeling about nature and harked back to ancient Stoicism. According to that philosophy, nature is the source of vitality, morality, and destiny. Goethe’s vision of universal metamorphosis exemplified this cast of mind, and its foremost scientific exponent was Lamarck. In post-Darwinian polemics Lamarck has often been represented by those hostile to the theory of natural selection as the predecessor who had formulated whatever was original and valid in the doctrine of evolution. That argument is untrue to the facts and unfair to the thought of both Lamarck and Darwin. In Lamarck’s view, cyclic equilibrium obtains in the world between the continuously constitutive forms of activity (electricity, fire, life itself) and the perpetually disintegrating tendency of the physical environment. The innate self-perfecting drive of living beings never altogether prevails over the dead hand of inorganic matter, and the tableau of animals each in its kind represents the highest point to which every species has attained in the continuous process of becoming. Assertions of the inheritance of acquired characters and the law of use and disuse (these are later terms) may, indeed, be found in Lamarck’s writings, although only as incidental to his view of flux and process in the progression of life, not as explaining actual evidence of variations.\n\nOver against this conception of life as plastic power, novel in emphasis and appeal if not in principle, persisted the strong tradition of teleology. Engrained since Aristotle, that habit of mind had survived the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century with its scope reduced to the degree that it had become the mode of explanation appropriate to the description of organisms. Within this restricted domain teleology had if anything been fortified by the popularity in eighteenth-century natural theology of the argument from design, which held that the existence of God is demonstrable in the ease and skill with which He had specially created each species to fit its own environment and manner of life. In scientific practice, moreover, teleology answered in detail to the problems of functional analysis of anatomical structure, exhibiting how in plants and animals the part serves in exact respects the purposes of the whole. Such was Cuvier’s method in comparative anatomy.\n\nBackground of “Origin of Species.” The problem of adaptation, in short, was the crux of biological explanation. Aboard the Beagle Darwin already saw it to be so. Leaving home a believer in the fixity of species, like Cuvier or Paley, he had the facts of geographical variation of species continuously borne in upon him throughout the extensive experience of the voyage. He told in his Autobiography what lines of evidence led him first to doubt and then to change his mind:\n\n… I had been deeply impressed by discovering in the Pampean formation great fossil animals covered with armour like that on the existing armadillos; secondly, by the manner in which closely allied animals replace one another in proceeding southwards over the [South American] Continent; and thirdly, by the South American character of most of the productions of the Galapagos archipelago, and more especially by the manner in which they differ slightly on each island of the group. ([1876a] 1958, p. 118)\n\nUpon these manifold indications of variation of species in geographical space the new science of geology superimposed evidence of their modification in time. Stratigraphy had become a definitive science in the decades between 1810 and 1830. The first truly historical science, stratigraphy systematically ordered the geological succession according to the fossil population characteristic of the several formations and systems of the rocks. While an undergraduate, Darwin had worked one summer as assistant to one of the founders of stratigraphy, the Reverend Adam Sedgwick, a professor at Cambridge. Sedgwick, like many among the early geologists, held that the evidence for geological revolutions confirmed Biblical accounts of the Creation and the Flood. That view proved venial scientifically, however, for their intensive study of the fossil record made clear the progression of forms of life in the course of the ages.\n\nCatastrophists of Sedgwick’s persuasion took those ages to be brief and punctuated by cataclysms. Increasingly, however, skeptical critics came to think of the span of the past as very long—long enough for all changes to come about gradually. Indeed, the mentor to whom Darwin professed the deepest of his scientific obligations was not a biologist at all. He was Sir Charles Lyell, whose Principles of Geology, published in three volumes between 1830 and 1833, was the earliest fully comprehensive work in that science. It combated the doctrine of geological catastrophes in the name of the uniformity and virtual eternity of nature and taught Darwin to think of the cumulative efficacy of minute changes operating progressively across vast reaches of time.\n\nFurther insights came to Darwin as he puzzled over the problem of species in the months following his return to England in the autumn of 1836. Soon thereafter he started a notebook on the subject, the first in what was to become a voluminous series. He worked the while, so he later said, on Baconian principles, collecting facts wholesale. One of his concerns was inheritable modifications. Such modifications are not to be confused with characteristics acquired, in the Neo-Lamarckian sense, as a consequence of a creature’s individual necessities—the biceps in a blacksmith’s arm, for example. Any theory of evolution must, of course, suppose that the variations which are its subject matter are cumulative over generations. From the outset Darwin had the wit to see that if a theory of evolution were not to beg the question, variations must be supposed random in origin, cumulative in effect, and indefinite in extent. In thinking about how they may be accumulated, Darwin meditated often upon the way in which kennel owners, cattle farmers, stablemen, nurserymen, and pigeon fanciers select stock for breeding—how, operating upon successive generations of domesticated animals and plants, the breeder picks for reproduction those individuals that exhibit the characters desired and thus appears to mold the species.\n\nAs early as 1837, then, Darwin had all this: geographical evidence of variation; geological proof of succession; a uniformitarian sense of the history of nature; and the notion of random, heritable, and cumulative modifications in form, modifications produced by a process of selection, albeit an artificial one. Even so, he saw no prospect of oversetting by means of such indirect evidence the well-nigh universal conviction that species are fixed in nature itself, based as that belief was on the universal observation that within the experience of everyone like reproduces like, as well as on the plausible supposition that the adaptation of species to all sorts of specialized lives argues the creation of each to lead just that life we see it living.\n\nDarwin disposed of a set of facts and ideas, in other words, and needed a theory; indeed, he was constantly looking for one. It came in one of those flashes of insight which is better called catalytic than coincidental or subconscious. In October 1838 he chanced to read for distraction Maithus’ essay on population. The argument persuaded him at once [seePopulation, article onpopulation theories; and the biography ofalthus]. It must, indeed, have been familiar, for it was one of the commonplaces of contemporary political economy, requiring only to be brought together with Darwin’s problem for its relevance to flash into his mind:\n\n… being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new species. Here, then, I had at last got a theory by which to work. ([1876a] 1958, p. 120)\n\nHe worked for twenty years before publishing, although he did write out a draft in 1844 for circulation among friends and colleagues, notably Lyell and J. D. Hooker, the botanist. In May 1856 he at last began writing on an exhaustive scale and completed some ten or eleven chapters in the next year and a half. He thought to call the work “Natural Selection.” Then on June 18, 1858, Darwin had the shock of receiving from Alfred Russel Wallace, a young naturalist who had been investigating the flora and fauna of the Malayan jungle, the manuscript of an evolutionary theory identical with his own although based on much less extensive material, together with a request to send it along to Lyell if it should seem worthy. This coincidence precipitated Darwin’s decision to come before the public. On the advice of Lyell and Hooker he prepared a brief summary of his views to be published jointly with Wallace’s paper. Thereupon he settled down to compose an account that should be full enough to do justice to his materials although reduced in scale from what he had initially intended. It took eight months to write the Origin of Species, which appeared in November 1859.\n\nThe circumstances of the publication of the Origin belong, of course, to Darwin’s personal history, not to an account of his science. Suffice it to say that his behavior throughout was entirely honorable. It offers no grounds for the imputation repeated by detractors that he slighted Wallace. (For a general discussion of multiple discoveries in science, see Merton 1961.)\n\n“Origin of Species.” The full title summarizes the argument: On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. Addressing himself to the general public, Darwin began with the most familiar matter, the great variations evident among domesticated animals. He thereby called attention to the variability which exists within what are commonly taken to be fixed species and observed that in the breeder’s hands they are malleable: “The key is man’s power of accumulative selection: nature gives successive variations; man adds them up in certain directions useful to him” ([1859] 1964, p. 105). The second chapter extends consideration of the ambiguity of species into nature, and the third attributes the function of selection to the struggle for existence. “Owing to this struggle, variations, however slight, and from whatever cause proceeding, if they be in any degree profitable to the individuals of a species, in their infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to their physical conditions of life, will tend to the preservation of such individuals, and will generally be inherited by the offspring” (p. 145). Within the species the proportion of favored individuals will increase in successive generations, since by definition these individuals have characteristics with survival value that enable their possessors, merely by living longer than less favored competitors, to produce more descendants similarly equipped. Thus will species alter as time goes on.\n\nThe middle chapters of the Origin discuss the laws of variation. Darwin’s masterful control over detail is particularly evident here. There are acute observations on the effects of use and disuse of organs, on the influence of climate, and on the greater variability of species than of genera, the last offering a consideration peculiarly difficult to comprehend on any basis other than his. Darwin expressly excluded the problem of cause. Given the evidence that variations have in fact occurred and are heritable, the theory of natural selection explains the course of variation or change. Indeed, the success of the theory turned on dropping the question of cause, not as uninteresting, but as currently unanswerable, although not necessarily forever so.\n\nIn the later chapters Darwin anticipated difficulties and objections. He dealt with instinct, which hardly seems a bodily matter. He acknowledged the problem of extreme specialization and discussed the spectacular beauty of the male in certain species of birds as an extravagance that seems to surpass the humdrum effects of selection. He ascribed the absence of transitional forms to the imperfection of the geological record. He treated sexual preferences and choices as a special case of natural selection rather than as an auxiliary or extraneous factor. In summary let it be said that contemporary evolutionists bear him out on all essential matters. The degree of confirmation of his reasoning and its fidelity to vast reaches of fact is extraordinary when it is also considered that he was necessarily unaware of the twentieth-century discoveries about the fine structure and workings of heredity.\n\nPublication of the Origin was the great event, indeed the raison d’être, of Darwin’s career. His single-mindedness invested the book with a kind of power—a power deriving from the scope as well as from the depth of his thought. Iconoclastic critics have sometimes described the book as dull. Nor does it invite stylistic appreciation. It will repay structural analysis, however, and this is the way to understand Darwin’s merit as a theorist. For this is a work of theory, even though any given sentence expresses only fact or deduction. The art lies in the deployment, not in the expression, and it creates its effect in the way a mosaic does rather than a painting. Each element is a mere bit of stone, every sentence a mere statement; yet a design governs the arrangement and the disposition. There are not many books in just this genre. Burckhardt’s Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy, for example, and perhaps Marx’s Capital (setting aside the disgust which often overlays statements in Marx) are also works in the mid-nineteenth-century mode of factual argumentation which, in the literature of science, Darwin represents at its most powerful.\n\nDarwin did not abandon further science in order to defend his views in the discussion that followed the publication of the Origin, although the pattern of the remaining half of his career was inevitably determined by the response to his book. He followed criticism closely and modified later editions of the Origin in numerous respects which either met or accepted objections without abandoning the position. Not all the revisions proved fortunate. Least felicitous was one he introduced into the subtitle as well as into the text. At Wallace’s urging he substituted Herbert Spencer’s formula, “survival of the fittest,” for his own phrase, “preservation of favoured races” to describe what transpires in the struggle for life in consequence of natural selection. Both the tautology—i.e., survival in a struggle for life—and the ambiguity of the superlative “fittest” confused his proper meaning and obscured the point he had originally emphasized: that the essential feature in the operation of natural selection is not mere survival for its own sake. It is the differential reproductivity of individuals favored adaptively by chance variation, which effect entails an increasing proportion of similarly constituted offspring in a population.\n\nDarwin’s later work. Thenceforth, Darwin was more effective in his other writings, both in substantiation of the theory of natural selection and in affirmation of his remarkable virtuosity in research. He chose problems which combined an appeal to his taste with relevance to evolution. Three major books develop central evolutionary themes more fully than does the Origin. The Variation of Plants and Animals Under Domestication (1868) tells in full zoological and archeological detail how man has bent to his uses very variable breeds—dog and horse, for example, sheep and goat, peacock and guinea fowl—and attributes the contrasting stability of the goose to its never having been taken in as a pet or servant and of the donkey to its having served only the classes of society whose members cannot afford experiments [seeDomestication, article onAnimal domestication]. By way of excursion, at the end of his book Darwin advanced the hypothesis of pangenesis to account for the phenomena of heredity. Here he addressed himself to the complaint that he had not explained how variations are transmitted. The speculation with which he met the criticism has only increased his vulnerability before later critics, for in imagining that the basis of heredity might be generalized throughout the organism (“gemmules” in each structure and organ governing the formation of its counterpart in the offspring), Darwin appeared to have conceded inheritance of acquired characters taken in a Lamarckian sense. It is to be appreciated, however, that Darwin suggested this speculation as a parenthetical aside.\n\nIn The Descent of Man (1871) Darwin directed his theory explicitly to the single species Homo sapiens. Much of the book is devoted to developing the evolutionary significance of sexual selection— i.e., the preferential choice of reproductive partner. Apart from that, the argument follows two main lines. The first is physical. The immediate evolutionary forebears of mankind are unknown. Darwin never represented man as deriving from apes. He did establish that man must in all probability be descended from species that are classified among primates, and further, that man and the higher apes resemble each other anatomically more closely than the latter resemble the lower primates.\n\nThe second line of argument is behavioristic. Intellectual and social faculties are themselves adaptive and in their variations make for the greater or lesser survival of the creatures that possess them. Other species besides man subsist with the aid of rudimentary or developed forms of social organization and communication, and Darwin could see only differences of degree between these and the characteristics of human community and moral awareness.\n\nThe last of Darwin’s expressly evolutionary treatises carries behavioristic comparisons even further. Probably The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872) is the most dated of Darwin’s writings. Nevertheless, in comparing phenomena like the physical manifestation of hostility in dog and master—the similarity of the snarling jaw to the drawn lip—and many other states of temper, Darwin did carry biology into treatment of faculties traditionally reserved for moral studies. Reciprocally, he introduced the study of animal behavior into psychology [seeSocial behavior, animal].\n\nIn the last decade of his life Darwin put in hand a train of experimental researches mainly botanical in character and published a final series of monographs exhibiting a great variety of novel observations and phenomena. He had already brought out a study of fertilization in orchids—in 1862; in 1877 he issued a second edition, much enlarged in detail. In the same year he published a very acute work on hermaphroditic reproduction in trees and plants. Two years previously, in 1875, he had issued two quite new studies, one on climbing plants (first published in journal form in 1865) and one on insectivorous plants. In 1880 he generalized the former in a book about the power of movement in plants as it resides in root, leaf, stem, and flower. In 1881 he concluded his lifework with an account of the process by which earthworms contribute to the formation of humus: the originality of the subject is characteristic of his acumen, while its choice reflects the modesty of his temperament.\n\nTo appreciate the full range of Darwin’s accomplishment as a scientist one must read in these experimental writings as well as in the Origin. The comparison to Newton is often adduced. It is justified. Notable scientists normally excel either in theoretical insight or in experimental virtuosity. Newton and Darwin were capable as very few have ever been, and perhaps none in equal measure, of combining those veins and thereby achieving the foremost stature in all aspects that distinguish science. It is true that, given the state of the science, comprehensiveness had to do the work in theory for Darwin that mathematical power did for Newton, which is only to say that the one was suited by his abilities to accomplish for biology what the other had done for physics, and that both of them made the most of those abilities.\n\nProfessional response to the “Origin.” The theory of natural selection polarized opinion among biologists more radically than is the common effect of scientific theories. Those who adopted it tended to do so straightaway in something like a conversion. “How extremely stupid not to have thought of that,” was T. H. Huxley’s often quoted reaction as the pieces suddenly fell into place on reading Darwin. Yet even the professional response was influenced by philosophical taste and cultural tradition. Then, as now, the English-speaking scientific world was empirically minded after the manner of Bacon, Locke, and Mill. In Darwin’s own milieu, what immediately persuaded was his resolution of the question of biological adaptation. Not that he solved the problem. He did better. He dispelled it, by turning adaptation from final cause into present effect. Instead of a wonder so intricate as to bespeak Providence or purpose, adaptation became merely the outcome of the whole life history of the species in its relation to circumstance and environment, a phenomenon or set of phenomena to be analyzed and explained in evolutionary terms. In Huxley’s hands, therefore, Darwin became the protagonist of the drama of scientific fact undoing theological prejudice.\n\nIn Germany, where Darwin’s work enjoyed a success if anything more influential than in England and the United States, what appealed was less its empiricism than its historicism. The sense of history as indwelling process, whether in the successive versions of Herder, Hegel, or Marx, had in the course of the romantic movement of thought become deeply engrained in the German sense of the world. Philosophically speaking, such historiography treats the past in a mode exactly counter to Darwin’s, the one being a realist and the other a nominalist approach to nature. Oblivious to these distinctions, German historicists misread Darwin and took him for their own. It is well known that Marx spoke of dedicating the second book of Capital to Darwin, an intention which makes a curious contrast to the Lamarckian position of some subsequent Marxists. The professional champion and self-appointed spokesman, however, was Ernst Haeckel, who tried to make over all biology into the study of evolution. He governed his embryology, for example, by the doctrine that the development of every individual in the womb recapitulates the evolution of the species. Not only does evolution govern all biology, but all truth too: Haeckel’s Riddle of the Universe is the cardinal document of the movement to make something like a religion out of evolutionary thought itself.\n\nOnly in France was Darwin’s work initially greeted by indifference (except among anthropologists who did take it up with very great benefit to their science). Not so the biologists. Among them the writ of Cuvier still ran. There was also a problem of language. In French, the word évolution refers to the development of an individual; transformisme connotes the doctrine as affecting species in general, and at that time involved visionary connotations. A self-defeating semantic objection also supervened—to explain the origin of species in a book which questioned their reality seemed an inadmissible mode of discourse. The greatest of physiologists, Claude Bernard, never even seized the differences between the Darwinian theory and its speculative predecessors. “We must doubtless admire,” he wrote disdainfully, “those great horizons dimly seen by the genius of a Goethe, an Oken, a Carus, a Geoffrey Saint-Hilaire, a Darwin, in which a general conception shows us all living beings as the expression of types ceaselessly transformed in the evolution of organisms and species, —types in which every living being individually disappears like a reflection of the whole to which it belongs” ([1865] 1957, pp. 91–92). In general, Darwin expressed himself pragmatically in a manner characteristically English and characteristically unconvincing, not to say irritating, to the French.\n\nThe nonprofessional response. Darwin himself took no part in the social Darwinist movement of ideas and gave it no countenance [see Social Darwinism]. Something must here be said, nevertheless, about the pattern of nonprofessional response, insofar as it has been hostile, for these attitudes greatly amplified for a time certain scientific difficulties left unresolved by Darwin, and they have also contributed to persistent misunderstandings of the status of the theory in science—misunderstandings arising from repugnance toward its political and social derivations.\n\nThe pattern has two distinct aspects, theological and moralistic, which turn on different implications of the theory of evolution. The former, the theological issue between the Biblical story of the Creation and the Darwinian account of the origin of species, is the more famous. It is also the more literal and has proved the more ephemeral, concerned as it is with the wide historical fact of evolution rather than with the theory of natural selection, by which Darwin explained and thereby established the fact. The science of geology had, indeed, already faced theology with the necessity of regarding the scriptural account of earth history in an allegorical fashion, and the confrontation between Darwinists and religious believers settled rather than initiated that matter among informed persons. The Origin of Species did cause additional shock and distress, of course, chiefly in regard to the question of whether the reality of a spiritual component of human existence requires that man be biologically unique and specially created. This is a dilemma which may be resolved in one of two ways: either by considering the whole universe as contingent and composed of physical and spiritual aspects; or, in a more restricted way, by appreciating that the theory of evolution treats man as an evolved animal, but it does not and in principle cannot assert that he is nothing but an animal. At all events, within a relatively short space of time theologians learned to contemplate evolution without dismay, as clearly a matter of fact; significant religious minds have not felt impelled to gird against the facts, although fundamentalist rejection of them persists in diminishing backwaters.\n\nWhat has persisted in recurrent and often serious manifestations is a second aspect of resistance to Darwin’s work. This kind of resistance is serious because it obtains among educated persons and reveals the occasional inability of highly intelligent people to respect the force and limitations of scientific demonstration. In this tradition the tenor has been to accept and even celebrate the phenomenon of evolution while denigrating the theory of natural selection. Sometimes this denigration has taken the form of an attack on Darwin’s character and probity, as in the instances of Barzun (1941) and Himmelfarb (1959). Sometimes it has taken the form of a revival, more or less garbled, of the views of Lamarck, as in the writings of Samuel Butler and George Bernard Shaw. Sometimes it has taken the form of proposing an alternative formula, metaphorical in character, for the purpose of replenishing evolution with intelligence, will, or choice. Such were the notions of “creative evolution,” the elan vital of Bergson, or entelechy of Driesch. Sometimes it has taken on ideological and"
