The inability to reconcile a loving God and a world of suffering ultimately leads to despair and hopelessness.\n\nDarwin was a Creationist?\n\nThe next time someone tries to condemn the biblical view of origins using arguments from biology or other sciences, just remind him that scientific arguments make consistent, logical sense only when reality is understood from a biblical worldview, beginning with creation.\n\nDarwinism and Racism\n\nDarwinian evolution was (and still is) inherently a racist philosophy. It teaches that different groups or “races” of people evolved at different times and rates."
