        "text": "Biography\n\nCharles Darwin's grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, physician, naturalist, poet and inventor, was born in Elston near Newark, Nottinghamshire, on 12 December 1731. He was the author of several important works of poetry and of science. The first volume of his most important work, Zoonomia, was published in 1794 with the second volume appearing two years later. In Zoonomia Darwin proposed a theory of evolution, which was to prefigure the theories of his grandson Charles.\n\nThe most remarkable element of the book is not Darwin’s system of classification … or its medical content, but is his speculations on evolution. In a chapter entitled “Of Generation” he speculates that all warm-blooded animals may have arisen from “one living filament”, which:\n\n'the Great First Cause endowed with animality, with the power of acquiring new parts, attended with new propensities, directed by irritations, sensations, volitions and associations: and thus possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and delivering down those improvements, by generation to posterity, world without end!'.\n\n[Zoonomia I, p.505]\n\n'I remember I took great delight at school in fishing for newts in the quarry pool. I had thus young formed a strong taste for collecting, chiefly seals, franks, etc., but also pebbles and minerals – one which was given me by some boy decided this taste. I believe shortly after this, or before, I had smattered in botany, and certainly when at Mr. Case’s school I was very fond of gardening, and invented some great falsehoods about being able to colour crocuses as I liked.’\n\nCharles Robert Darwin was born in England, 12 February 1809, the son of a wealthy physician. Already as a child he had a ‘taste for natural history’, collecting plants, minerals, shells, birds’ eggs, and more. By contrast, Charles found no interest in the classical education given him at Shrewsbury School. Next came two years, 1825-7, at the University of Edinburgh, pursuing scientific studies, with the (vague) intent of following his father’s profession; while so youthful, the undergraduate had contact with learned elites, did some original research in marine zoology, and began thinking about the evolution of living forms. Then came a switch to Cambridge University, Darwin senior now thinking his son might become a clergyman. In fact, Charles’s autobiography tells that he now ‘got into a sporting set, including some dissipated low-minded young men’. More important, while giving the barest necessary attention to the classics, Darwin now strengthened his scientific and philosophic interests. A particular passion was to collect beetles, ‘some very rare species’ among them.\n\nImmediately on graduation, Darwin engaged in geological work in North Wales. Soon he was invited to serve (without payment) as naturalist on HMS Beagle, then preparing for a massive surveying venture. Concentrating on South American waters, but extending wider, this voyage lasted from December 1831 to October 1836. The experience, Darwin stressed, ‘has been by far the most important event in my life’.\n\nOn return he organised the recording of massive data collected largely by himself, as well as writing a Journal account of the voyage. Simultaneously, he pondered the deeper meaning of what he had observed, so early as 1839 forming the theory of evolution through natural selection.\n\n‘I marvel at my good fortune that she, so infinitely my superior in every single moral quality, consented to be my wife.’\n\n‘ I have indeed been most happy in my family, and I must say to you my children that not one of you has ever given me one minute’s anxiety, except on the score of health. There are, I suspect, very few fathers of five sons who could say this with entire truth. When you were very young it was my delight to play with you all, and I think with a sigh that such days can never return...’\n\nNot until 1858 did he publicise this concept, and the next year elaborated it in his most famous book, The Origin of Species. Darwin long continued his phenomenal intensity of research and publication; The Descent of Man (1871) affirmed that evolution applied to human kind.. Death came 19 April 1882.\n\n[Notes by Michael Roe]\n\nBritish Museum 1909: Memorials of Charles Darwin, British Museum, London\n\nIn the 1872 edition of On the Origin of Species Darwin remarked on the resemblance between dog and thylacine jaws (see illustration right) showing how selection worked in a similar way on “quite distinct beings” and the exhibition held at the British Museum on the centenary of Darwin’s birth included a thylacine skull that illustrated the argument on page 49.\n\n‘ The voyage of the Beagle has been by far the most important event in my life and has determined my whole career; ... I have always felt that I owe to the voyage the first real training or education of my mind. I was led to attend closely to several branches of natural history, and thus my powers of observation were improved, though they were already fairly developed.’\n\n‘If I lived twenty more years and was able to work, how I should have to modify the Origin, and how much the views on all points will have to be modified! Well it is a beginning, and that is something...’"
