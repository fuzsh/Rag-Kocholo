        "text": "Charles Darwin was an English scientist who studied nature. He is known for his theory of evolution by natural selection. According to this theory, all living things are struggling to survive. The living things that have the most helpful traits for their environment tend to survive. These living things then pass along their helpful traits to their young. In this way, animals change, or evolve, over hundreds of years. He described his ideas in his important book, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (1859).\n\nCharles Robert Darwin was born on February 12, 1809, in Shropshire, England. He did poorly throughout school. Nevertheless he attended the University of Edinburgh and the University of Cambridge. A professor at Cambridge encouraged Charles’s interest in natural history.\n\nIn 1831 Darwin joined an expedition to explore the coasts of South America. On December 27, 1831, Darwin and the others set sail on the HMS Beagle. Darwin’s goal was to study the natural history of the areas they were to explore. The observations he made during the five-year trip led him to wonder how new species developed. To explain this process Darwin formed his theory of natural selection.\n\nDarwin first presented his theory in 1858. The idea of evolution was not new then, but Darwin’s theory explained how evolution occurred. When Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859, the book was an immediate success. However, it was not popular with people who believed that God created everything in the world all at one time. He continued writing about his theory in several other books. Charles Darwin died on April 19, 1882."
