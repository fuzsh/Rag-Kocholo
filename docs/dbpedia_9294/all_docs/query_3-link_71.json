        "text": "Charles Darwin was born in Shropshire, England in 1809. In 1825 he went to the University of Edinburgh to study medicine.\n\nHis experience at university provided him with a wide scientific education. He was exposed to new, and sometimes controversial, scientific ideas and theories in debates, talks and through student societies. However, he did not enjoy certain parts of his studies, particularly the study of anatomy and surgery.\n\nHe left Edinburgh after two years and started studying for a degree at Christ College, Cambridge, working towards becoming a member of the clergyReligious leaders in the church such as priests or bishops. on the advice of his father.\n\nWhile studying, Darwin developed an interest in nature and how religious ideas and nature were linked. He became good friends with John Stevens Henslow, who was a professor at Cambridge University.\n\nAfter completing his studies, Darwin received a letter in 1831 from John Stevens Henslow inviting him to go on a voyageA journey, normally by sea. on the HMS Beagle. Henslow thought of Darwin when the shipâs captain, Fitzroy, told him he was looking for a naturalistAn expert or student in the field of natural history. to join him on the journey. Henslow, who had got to know Darwin well at Cambridge, knew Darwin would be interested. Darwin joined the expeditionA journey with the purpose of discovery, or exploration., which lasted for nearly 5 years.\n\nWhen he returned to England, Darwin shared many of the specimenAn item or object collected so that it can be studied. and research from his travels with other biologists and researchers. Over time, he came to think that the animals he had seen on his travels had adapted to the environment that they lived in.\n\nDarwin had made careful notes as the voyageA journey, normally by sea. went on, later publishing these in a collection he called Journal of Researches. This was later renamed Voyage of the Beagle. He revised his ideas over several years and published several updated editions of the book.\n\nHe came to believe that although the different islands had similar plants and animals, many seemed to have changed - or adapted - to suit the local environment. Finches, for example, had different beaks on each island, and he thought their beaks had adapted according to the food they ate. He frequently discussed his ideas with other researchers, such as Charles Lyell, who was a prominent Scottish scientist.\n\nDarwin was reluctant to publish his work on evolutionThe theory proposed by Charles Darwin in which small advantages in organisms mean they are more likely to reproduce and pass these to their offspring. Over many, many generations this natural selection causes the development of new species by evolution. for many years, despite his thoughts and the significant amount of work he had done on the adaptations between different speciesA group of living creatures that can breed together. This definition is used by scientists to help classify animals.. This was because:\n\nHe wanted to make sure he had enough examples and evidence to support his theory.\n\nHe was aware that some of his ideas contradicted the creation story in the Old TestamentThe first part of the Christian Bible which corresponds to the Hebrew Bible but is arranged differently..\n\nHe suffered from ill health and spent time grieving the death of his daughter, Annie.\n\nIn 1856, a biologist called Alfred Russel Wallace wrote to Darwin. He had many similar ideas about natural selectionThe process through which living things adapt and change, leading to the creature most suited to its environment becoming the dominant species. and wanted to share his thoughts. Charles Lyall warned Darwin that if he did not share his work then he would risk not getting any credit for his ideas. This prompted Darwin to publish his work. Wallace and Darwin had some of their thoughts on natural selection jointly published in a journal in 1858.\n\nDarwin wrote The Descent of Man in 1871. In this work he set out his theory that humans had evolved from apes. This was seen by many as a direct contradiction to the creation story as stated in the book of Genesis in the Old TestamentThe first part of the Christian Bible which corresponds to the Hebrew Bible but is arranged differently.. By this time some people did not view the creation story as a literal story on how the world was made, but some people did.\n\nDarwin recognised that his theory could offend some people, writing in his bookâs concluding remarks;\n\nThe main conclusion arrived at in this work, namely that man is descended from some lowly-organised form, will, I regret to think, be highly distasteful to many persons.\n\nEven before the publication of The Descent of Man, Darwinâs work was discussed at a debate held at the Natural History Museum in 1860. Darwinâs work was debated by the Bishop Wilberforce of Oxford (arguing against Darwinâs ideas) and Thomas Huxley (a biologist supporting Darwin)."
