        "text": "Charles Darwin in the Galapagos\n\nPerhaps our first association with the word \"Galapagos\" is the name \"Darwin.\" Darwin's visit to the Galapagos Islands had a resounding impact on the formation of his Theory of Natural Selection.\n\nA rather unmotivated and failing medical scholar, Charles Darwin accompanied Captain Robert Fitzroy as a travel companion and naturalist on the HMS Beagle. His book the Voyage of the Beagle is an account of his worldwide journey.\n\nWhen setting off from England in 1831 for a five-year voyage, Darwin had little ambitions for groundbreaking scientific research. After surveying the coasts of South America, the ship stopped over in the Galapagos Islands.\n\nDuring his visit to the islands, Darwin noted that the unique creatures were similar from island to island, but perfectly adapted to their environments which led him to ponder the origin of the islands' inhabitants.\n\nAmong those that struck Darwin so greatly were the finches that are now named in his honor. Darwin would later base some of his thought from the supposing that these finches were all descendents of the same lineage.\n\nYears later in 1859, Darwin finally consolidated all of his observations into his famous book On The Origin of Species, drastically and controversially altering the scientific view on the biological origins of life.\n\nFollow in Darwin’s Footsteps\n\nCharles Darwin Galapagos Adventure\n\nThe inspiration brought by Galapagos came through these voyages in the HMS Beagle:\n\n“In a few days’ time, the Beagle will sail for the Galapagos Islands. I look forward with joy and interest to this, both as being somewhat nearer to England and for the sake of having a good look at an active volcano.”\n\n-Charles Darwin, letter to J.S. Henslow, July 12, 1835.\n\nDarwin and the HMS Beagle were in Galapagos during September and October of 1835, and through this time, he had the opportunity to explore a handful of islands, and collect several Galapagos species for use in his own research and that of his friends back in England.\n\nThe Beagle itself was far too large to land, so it cruised around the islands and smaller boats would take Darwin and the other crew members ashore, where they could mingle with the endemic wildlife.\n\nSeptember 15-23, 1835: San Cristóbal Island (Chatham)\n\nOn September 15, Mount Pitt was sighted, on San Cristóbal Island.\n\nWhile the crew captured several of the San Cristobal giant tortoises for food, Charles Darwin was intrigued by the them and plant specimens on the islands, as well as with the rocky island and the lava that formed it.\n\nSeptember 24-28: Floreana Island (Charles)\n\nFloreana was an Ecuadorian penal colony while being managed by the Englishman, Nicholas Lawson and the Beagle’s crew was allowed to go ashore for a tour of the colony.\n\nDarwin diligently collected many animal and plant specimens and learned that it was possible to tell from which island a tortoise came judging by its shell. In his journal, Darwin remarked that the convicts regularly ate tortoises and that whaling ships and pirates often took them: one such ship carried off 700 Floreana tortoises to eat while at sea. By 1846 the race was extinct.\n\nSeptember 28-October 4: Isabela Island (Albemarle)\n\nOn this island, Darwin was amazed by the number of marine iguanas that forage underwater.\n\nHis first thought was that the iguana fed of fish and little animals. However, and while on James Island, a dissection of a marine iguana led to the discovery that they feed off algae.\n\nOctober 4 – October 8 - Northern Islands: Marchena, Genovesa, and Pinta (Bindloe, Tower, and Abingdon)\n\nThe Beagle tried to get to Abingdon Island but was repeatedly foiled by currents and winds. It did not anchor at any of these islands and instead decided to head for James (Santiago) Island, as they were running low on fresh water.\n\nOctober 8 – October 17 - James (Santiago) Island\n\nThe Beagle found no water on James and headed back to Chatham to resupply.\n\nDarwin, the ship’s physician Benjamin Bynoe and each of their servants remained behind with a tent and provisions to spend the week exploring and gathering samples. They collected many specimens, including:\n\nSome fish\n\nSnails\n\nSeveral varieties of birds\n\nReptiles\n\nSome insects, although he remarked about how few insects were to be had.\n\nIt was about this time that Darwin realized that the different islands were home to different species.\n\nOctober 17 – October 20 - Isabela (Albemarle), Wolf (Wenham) and Darwin (Culpepper) Islands\n\nAfter picking up Darwin’s party, the Beagle went back to survey the eastern coast of Isabela Island before going to Abingdon (Pinta) to pick up another party that had been surveying in one of the smaller boats.\n\nOn October 20, they surveyed Wenham (Wolf) and Culpepper (Darwin) before setting sail for Tahiti:\n\nFast fact: Darwin never set foot on Culpepper, the Island that now bears his name.\n\nEndemism\n\nThe idea of endemic species (species found only in one specific place and nowhere else on earth) was central to Darwin’s arguments. The Galapagos Archipelago was key for him to prove his point:\n\n“This fact might have been expected on my theory for, as already explained, species occasionally arriving after long intervals in a new and isolated district, and having to compete with new associates, will be eminently liable to modification, and will often produce groups of modified descendants.”\n\nIn other words, the endemic species that had evolved on remote islands proved his point as they adapted over long periods of time to a new environment, leaving behind their original characteristics."
