Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes’ daughter — now known as Suri Noelle — chose her new name to “praise her mother,” says a source.

Suri didn’t just drop Cruise from her name, but is using Holmes’ middle name, Noelle, as her surname.

“She is showing praise for her mother by using her middle name,” says a source, who speculates that the 18-year-old made the change because she “wants her own identity.”

The new name will also help her “avoid the paparazzi” and allow her to “start fresh at college,” says our source.

Suri used the moniker at her graduation ceremony from Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, better known as the “Fame School,” earlier this month.

But that wasn’t the first time.

The teenager — who played the lead role of Morticia Addams in her high school’s performance of “The Addams Family: A New Musical” — was listed in the playbill for the December show as “Suri Noelle” as well.

It’s unclear whether her name has been legally changed.

Page Six confirmed in March 2023 that Cruise has remained estranged from his daughter and had “no part” in her life.

Holmes and Cruise had a high-profile divorce in 2012, and the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress has been parenting solo ever since.

“I feel very blessed to have such a special daughter. Being her mom is absolutely the greatest gift and privilege,” Holmes has said.
