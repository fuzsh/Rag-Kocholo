        "text": "No one from either Tom Cruise‘s team or Katie Holmes‘ camp was talking on the record Monday after the couple announced they had reached what has to be one of the quickest celebrity divorce negotiations in history.\n\nAlthough it seemed as if Holmes had pulled off what many were predicting last week — the actress succeeded in strong-arming an organization that has been known in the past for getting its own way against everyone from Nicole Kidman to the IRS — speculation that the split could force even more revelations about the secretive Church of Scientology to come to light as a result of a lengthy divorce trial have been dashed.\n\nPHOTOS: 10 of Hollywood’s Nastiest Divorces\n\nOne burning question remained after Cruise and Holmes said they had come to an agreement about the end of their five-year marriage and custody of their 6-year-old daughter, Suri: Will Holmes, as predicted by formerly top-ranking Scientologists, state that her decision to file for divorce from Cruise had nothing to do with Scientology?\n\nThe answer? It’s complicated. People will be watching to see if any statement either side makes beyond their joint and vague statement Monday about “respecting each other’s beliefs” addresses Scientology and if anything in the settlement specifically restricts what Holmes can say about the organization.\n\nMarty Rathbun, a Scientologist for 22 years and considered the second-most powerful figure in the organization until he left in late 2004, told the Village Voice on Sunday that he foresaw a speedy settlement that would secretly give Holmes everything she wanted as long as she stated publicly that Scientology had nothing to do with why she wanted out of the marriage.\n\nSo far, Holmes hasn’t commented. And that’s been just part of what Mike Rinder — once the brains behind Scientology’s handling of the media until he himself left the group in 2007 — calls a dazzling strategy.\n\n“Katie’s been brilliant, absolutely brilliant,” Rinder told The Hollywood Reporter on Monday after the settlement was announced. “She hasn’t made one statement.”\n\nA source close to Holmes’ legal team says the 33-year-old actress is “very relieved” that a settlement has been reached. “Katie is glad that this situation has been resolved so swiftly and amicably.”\n\nPHOTOS: 19 of Hollywood’s All-Time Shortest Marriages\n\nHolmes reportedly got what she wanted; Suri will live with her in New York, though Cruise will be allowed significant visitation. Holmes’ representative, attorney Jonathan Wolfe, says the real details of the settlement are being kept under wraps.\n\n“There are numerous inaccuracies in the reports regarding the purported contents of the agreement reached between the parties,” he said. “The agreement is confidential, and its terms will not be disclosed.”\n\nRinder speculates that if Holmes does say her divorce petition had nothing to do with Scientology, she runs the risk of losing her new Lifetime-ready image of a gutsy mom, an image burnished by reports in media outlets ranging from Extra (“Katie’s brave face“) to the New York Daily News, which described her as a “mother trying to save her daughter from the clutches of Scientology.”\n\nInstead she could be seen as having caved to the organization.\n\nHolmes indirectly put unprecedented pressure on Scientology this past week after her divorce petition resulted in a flood of stories indicating she was probably leaving Cruise because she didn’t want Suri raised as a Scientologist.\n\n“If she does [disavow Scientology as a factor in the divorce], it will look terrible, and I think it would be a terrible mistake,” says Rinder, who says to watch for a spin on the divorce that will come from an “indirect source.”\n\n“Tom’s publicist will be walking right in line with all the big celebrity glossies like Us Weekly and the shows like Entertainment Tonight and leaking to them that the divorce had nothing to do with Scientology,” Rinder says. “That way Katie doesn’t have to say anything directly, but Tom Cruise and the Church of Scientology get to save face.”\n\nBut will that offset the spotlight news of the divorce has put on Scientology?\n\n“If word comes out that the divorce was not about Scientology, people will buy it hook, line and sinker,” says Rinder. “That’s just how it is. People tend to believe what you tell them.”"
