        "text": "Sometimes, it seems like Hollywood offspring age faster than the rest of us. Because we’re sure it’s not been that long since Suri Cruise was a cute toddler being carted around by her famous parents Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes.\n\nNow, though, she turns 18 on 18 April, and we’re told that this could lead to even less involvement from her father.\n\nKatie was awarded sole custody of Suri after she filed for divorce from Tom in 2012, with court documents showing that he would pay child support of £318,000 a year, plus expenses, including medical and educational costs.\n\nIt’s been reported that he’s had little part in his daughter’s life, and with the financial arrangement due to come to an end on Suri’s 18th birthday, an insider tells us Katie feels Suri doesn’t need Tom – or his wallet.\n\nThe source says, “Katie’s very clear that Suri doesn’t need Tom’s money to be happy or afford the life they’re accustomed to. Katie’s made plenty of her own money and she can take care of her daughter and send her to whatever college she wants.\n\n“Suri is going to be quite the superstar, whether she goes into business or Hollywood. But one thing that’s very clear as far as Katie’s concerned is that she doesn’t need Tom’s help to get ahead. She’s got the brains, talent, and beauty to make it to the top all on her own.”\n\nAfter meeting in 2005, Katie and Tom – who’s said to be worth £477million – had a whirlwind romance, with Suri born the following year. The couple practised Scientology, a blend of science and spirituality, but six years after their wedding, Katie filed for divorce amid rumours that she wanted to free herself and Suri from the constraints of the controversial religion.\n\nIn 2013, Tom sued a US magazine when it reported that he had “abandoned” Suri, with a settlement reached before it went to trial. In a deposition, Tom admitted he hadn’t been able to see Suri for 100 days because of filming, and since then, reports have claimed he hasn’t seen her in a decade, though that hasn’t been verified.\n\nOur insider says that as his daughter reaches adulthood, Tom – who is a very present parent to his other children, Isabella and Connor, who he adopted with ex-wife Nicole Kidman – is having a change of heart.\n\n“Tom is feeling guilty about missing so much of her life, but insists that he hasn’t completely shut Suri out of his life, and does get updates from time to time. He made that deal to allow her and her mother to live their own lives because that was what Katie wanted. But now Suri’s officially an adult, he feels she’s old enough to make her own choices, and he wants to reach out and build a better relationship with her.”"
