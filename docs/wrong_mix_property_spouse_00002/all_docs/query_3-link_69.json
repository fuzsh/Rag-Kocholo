        "text": "Kanye West's shade knows no bounds. The rap icon, who took a lot of heat for his recent feud with Wiz Khalifa and Amber Rose, has made Wendy Williams his new target for her repeated shots at him over his sexuality.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, 'Ye recorded a remix of Aerosmith's \"(Dude) Looks Like a Lady\" tailored specifically for Wendy. \"You obsessed with me/ Keep testing me/ You may be wearing dresses, but you a man like me/ Got bigger hands than me/ Let me see, your birther please/ A dude in a wig that really wanna be me,\" he rhymes on the track, which he reportedly recorded in Los Angeles last week.\n\n\"Kanye played the record for some of the artists he has been collaborating with in the studio and everyone was going crazy,\" a source says. \"It was really on the level of Nas's 'Ether' diss record to Jay Z.\" So, why haven't we heard what Kanye has undoubtedly declared the Greatest Diss Track of All Time? Certainly not because he decided to be mature for a change. Turns out, it's his wife, Kim Kardashian, who put a stop to his firing shots.\n\nAs we now know, 'Ye's wife is trying to dispense of the drama surrounding her husband and their family, even going so far as to call a truce with Amber Rose. But there's another, surprisingly sensitive reason she demanded he keep the record to himself: \"Kim was concerned that Caitlyn [Jenner] would be offended by the record. It would appear as though Kanye was in some way attacking that movement instead of just targeting Wendy. She didn't want Kanye to be labeled transphobic.\"\n\nWell, trying to protect her husband's reputation isn't quite the same as actually calling him out for his transphobic behavior, but we'll take what we can get."
