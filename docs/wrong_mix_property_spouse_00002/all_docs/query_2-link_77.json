Through partnerships and collaborations with agents, publishers and practitioners throughout the world, we seek to introduce Wilder’s body of work to new audiences, and to encourage subsidiary works based on his published and unpublished record. The family also represents the literary record for Wilder’s three siblings who were also writers: Amos Charlotte and Isabel. With the support of Yale’s Beinecke Rare Books and Manuscript Library (home of the Wilder Family Archive) and The Thornton Wilder Society, we encourage teaching and scholarship in Thornton Wilder and his family. We invite you to explore the website for detailed information about our activities and ways in which you can become involved with them."
