        "text": "Suri Cruise, the daughter of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, has hinted at her college plans in a TikTok video.\n\nThe 18-year-old high school senior revealed that she’ll be heading to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the fall. A TikTok video posted by a fellow high school student, which has since been made private, showed Suri and her classmates at New York City’s LaGuardia High School showing off their college sweaters.\n\nThe clip was set to the Hannah Montana song, “I’ll Always Remember You,” as each graduating senior used their hands to reveal their new alma mater. After Suri showed off her red Carnegie Mellon sweatshirt, she then did a little dance for the camera.\n\n“LaG commitment day,” the student captioned the TikTok.\n\nThe Mission: Impossible star, 61, and the Dawson’s Creek alum, 45, welcomed their daughter Suri in April 2006. The actors met one year prior and were engaged two months later. Holmes and Cruise tied the knot during an Italian ceremony in November 2006, and Holmes later filed for divorce in June 2012 after five years of marriage.\n\nAccording to Page Six, their daughter celebrated her 18th birthday in New York City last month while her father was in London.\n\nHolmes has previously opened up about working hard to “protect” Suri because of her childhood in the spotlight. “What has been really important for me with my daughter, because she was so visible at a young age, is I really like to protect her,” the Batman Begins star told Glamour in April last year. “I’m very grateful to be a parent, to be her parent. She’s an incredible person.”\n\nThe mother of one even enlisted her daughter to join her on a recent project. Suri sang “Blue Moon” during the opening credits of Holmes’ 2022 film, Alone Together, and also sang vocals on her 2023 movie, Rare Objects.\n\n“I hope she always does something on my films. I always ask her,” Holmes said. “But both of those experiences came out of the same sense of what I love about our industry, which is, you have these projects and you become a family with people. And it’s this safe, beautiful, creative space.”\n\nShe continued: “So it comes out of love for me to include someone who I love dearly. That’s how I like to work. I like to have that kind of feeling. It was very meaningful to me to have her there, because she’s my heart.”\n\nWhile much of Suri’s early life was captured by paparazzi, Holmes shared in an essay for Vogue Australia how the mother-daughter duo were able to embrace their newfound private lives during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“Hobbies such as sewing, painting and writing became new hallmarks of satisfaction and having had time at home to just be. To listen. To live for a moment in time without the pressure of results and instead appreciate the natural rhythms of mother and daughter was the most precious gift,” she wrote in 2020.\n\nHolmes also revealed that she and Suri watched Dawson’s Creek together during the height of the pandemic. The actor was just 19 years old when she starred as Joey Potter on the WB series, which ran from 1998 to 2003."
