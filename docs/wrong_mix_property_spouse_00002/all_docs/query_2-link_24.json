        "text": "Showtime’s Ray Donovan is upping the guest star ante.\n\nThe drama starring Liev Schreiber as L.A.’s best professional fixer to the stars has booked Katie Holmes for a season-long arc, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.\n\nHolmes will appear in the third season with a major role as Paige, the shrewd and chic businesswoman daughter of billionaire producer Andrew Finney (played by new addition Ian McShane in a season-long arc), who enlists Ray’s services.\n\nSee more THR‘s Cover Shoot With the Stars of Showtime\n\nFor its part, Ray Donovan is Showtime’s second-highest-rated drama series following Homeland and is in production on its 12-episode third season. The drama has also enlisted Guy Burnet (Mortdecai) for a recurring role of Casey, Albert’s prodigal son.\n\nThe casting marks Holmes’ latest TV foray. Last season, she booked the starring role in ABC’s untitled Richard LaGravenese drama pilot, playing an Audrey Hepburn-esque character. Should that pilot have moved forward it would have marked Holmes’ first scripted series regular role since Dawson’s Creek launched her career. More recently, the actress played Jackie Kennedy in Reelz’s controversial miniseries The Kennedys. She’s set to reprise that role in Reelz’s follow-up, After Camelot. She next will be seen in the feature film Woman in Gold opposite Ryan Reynolds and Helen Mirren.\n\nHolmes is repped by ICM Partners, Untitled Entertainment and Sloane Offer."
