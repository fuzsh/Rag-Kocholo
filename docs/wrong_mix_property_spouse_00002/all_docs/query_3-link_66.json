        "text": "Katie Holmes\n\nActress Katie Holmes proved her fashion icon status once again with her latest New York Fashion Week look, with the star looking chic and mature in a lacy black dress with black lingerie underneath.\n\nThe 45-year-old rocked the elegant look at the Michael Kors fashion show on Tuesday, Feb. 13, wearing a black blazer over the dress, with white shoes and a white clutch as accessories. Holmes went for a simple makeup look, with a red lip as the main focus, while her hair was styled in pretty waves.\n\nWhile at the fashion event, Holmes socialized with Brie Larson, Gabrielle Union and more. She sat front row with the two women, as well as Rachel Brosnahan, Blake Lively, and Anna Wintour, among others. Along with the Michael Kors show, the Rare Objects actress was also spotted at events for Chanel, Ulla Johnson and Alice & Olivia.\n\nHolmes has had a more low-key career in recent years, with her last few roles in Rare Objects, Alone Together and The Secret: Dare to Dream. Meanwhile, she made her mark on the fashion scene, hopping on major trends and flaunting her classy sense of style.\n\nLast year was also the 25th anniversary of Holmes' hit show, Dawson's Creek, which had many fans talking about the possibility of a reboot. While appearing at the Cannes Film Festival, she said of the chances the show might return, \"There have been many discussions over the years. We all loved the experience.\"\n\nBut the cast has some reservations about whether or not a revival would be a good thing for the show, with Holmes saying, \"There's a protection that comes along with discussion. The show is a time capsule. To put it into today's world might tarnish it a little bit.\"\n\nSince then, there have been no further comments about bringing Dawson's Creek back, but fans can keep hoping something happens in the future."
