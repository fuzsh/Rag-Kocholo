The process—never before detailed—reportedly comprised several arduous steps, including the creation of dozens of audition tapes of young actresses, filmed by Scientology officials under the shrouded pretense of a “special project.” After months of searching, the organization in the fall of 2004 settled on a stunning brunette named Nazanin Boniadi to be Cruise’s next girlfriend. The job came with extensive training, a makeover (darker hair, better teeth), and confidentiality agreements—all before she ever set sights on her would-be paramour. (Scientology representatives deny that any such search took place and have dismissed several of the story’s sources as disgruntled apostates.)\n\nBecause it is Katie Holmes’s name—and not Boniadi’s—that you read about this summer in the tabloids, you know the relationship between Tom and his Scientology-approved partner ended. But who exactly is Nazanin Boniadi, and what about her caught the eye of the__ __organization? Born in Tehran but raised in London—her mother was a Scientologist, now no longer affiliated with the organization; her father was not—“Naz,” as she is known familiarly, was a captivatingly beautiful aspiring doctor and medical student when she first auditioned for Scientology’s secret role. Beyond her looks, she was considered intelligent (she graduated with honors from U.C.-Irvine), sufficiently chaste (no former threesome participants, the organization stipulated), and Hollywood-aware. After a short, ultimately unsuccessfully relationship with Cruise, Boniadi has appeared as a regular on soap General Hospital, earning an N.A.A.C.P. Image Award nomination for her work on the show. She also appeared in 2008’s Iron Man, nine episodes of How I Met Your Mother, and other movie projects, according to her IMBD page.\n\nOutside of Hollywood, Boniadi—who is also no longer involved in Scientology—is a known activist and face of human-rights concerns. For years, she has served as an official spokesperson for Amnesty International U.S.A., appearing in promotional videos and on international news broadcasts—in English and in Farsi—to discuss human-rights issues and activism. She is particularly drawn to women’s rights, and per her personal Web site, “has met with political leaders, collaborated with other prominent human rights defenders, and endorsed human rights petitions to the United Nations” on the freedoms of Iranian women.\n\nRelated: A Suri Cruise Portfolio: The Freewheeling, Authority-Bucking Fashion of Tom and Katie’s Daughter\n\nRelated: Photos: All Seven of Tom Cruise’s Vanity Fair Covers\n\nStyle\n\nTom Cruise Continues His Summer of Concerts With Glastonbury Stop\n\nThe Mission Impossible star was spotted at the music fest with co-star Simon Pegg and X-Files lead Gillian Anderson.\n\nMovies\n\nNicole Kidman Says Stanley Kubrick “Was Mining” Her Marriage to Tom Cruise for Eyes Wide Shut\n\nIn an interview with the LA Times, Kidman reveals that Kubrick asked “a lot of questions” over the two years she worked on his final film with her ex-husband: “There were ideas he was interested in.”\n\nTelevision\n\nTom Sandoval Sues Ariana Madix For Sharing Proof That He Cheated on Her\n\nMadix’s lawyer responds that Sandoval is continuing to “torment” his ex with an “abhorrent” suit, which accuses Madix of invasion of privacy and distribution of explicit videos featuring Sandoval and their former Vanderpump Rules castmate Rachel Leviss.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon’s Tom Glynn-Carney Thinks King Aegon Is a “Tragic Case”\n\nIn episode five of House of the Dragon’s second season, Team Black mourns the loss of a matriarch, while Team Green decides who will temporarily rule King’s Landing. Tom Glynn-Carney drops by Still Watching to chat about Aegon’s “boyish vulnerability” and the joy of dragon riding."
