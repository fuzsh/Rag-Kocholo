Read to find out.\n\nAre Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes dating?\n\nNo, Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes are currently not dating.\n\nHowever, they reportedly dated between 2013 and 2019, but did not officially confirm their relationship at any point. As per People, Holmes and Foxx were first linked in August 2013 after the Dawson’s Creek actress was seen at an East Hampton party, dancing with Foxx. Holmes took a sip of Foxx’s cocktail during that time. However, in an October 2013 Entertainment Tonight interview, Foxx called their relationship rumors “hilarious”.\n\nLater in 2015, multiple sources confirmed to People that Holmes had been frequently visiting Foxx and spending a lot of time with him. In subsequent years, Holmes and Foxx were spotted spending time with each other on multiple occassions such as visiting Paris, celebrating Foxx’s 50th birthday, playing Basketball together on Valentine’s day, and even going on a bike ride together.\n\nIn October 2018, the two sparked engagement rumors after Holmes was spotted wearing an engagement ring, according to People. However, a representative for the actress squashed the rumors by telling the magazine that she was not waring an engagement ring.\n\nOn May 7, 2019, Holmes and Foxx made a public appearance together at the Met Gala, even posing for a photo together, as per People. While they did not walk the red carpet with one another, multiple photos of them spending time with each other were taken. However, three months later, in August 2019, People confirmed that they parted ways.\n\nJamie Foxx is currently reportedly linked with Alyce Huckstepp. However, the actor has not confirmed this rumored relationship."
