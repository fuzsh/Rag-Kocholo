        "text": "MENOMONEE FALLS, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kohl’s Department Stores (NYSE: KSS) and Katie Holmes invite women everywhere to start a conversation about their breast health in an effort to confront the “pink elephant in the room” - breast cancer - and support the fight. As part of this initiative, Kohl’s will donate up to $1 million to Susan G. Komen® to help support the cause.\n\n“Breast cancer is like a pink elephant in the room that women don’t really want to think about, but know they should,” said Katie Holmes. “Women have so much going on in their day-to-day lives, it can be easy to ignore their own needs, like scheduling a mammogram or routine screening. I’m honored to team up with Kohl’s to remind women of the importance of having a conversation about breast health right now.”\n\n“Kohl’s is thrilled to partner with Katie Holmes to get women talking about breast cancer and to offer customers the opportunity to support the fight against breast cancer by redeeming our first-ever, pink Kohl’s Cash,” said Michelle Gass, Kohl’s chief customer officer. “Kohl’s is committed to women’s health and we are excited to partner with Susan G. Komen on a national level as we work together to confront the pink elephant in the room and encourage breast cancer awareness through conversation.”\n\nFrom Wednesday, February 12 through Monday, February 17, customers who earn Kohl’s Cash on purchases at Kohl’s stores or on Kohls.com will receive a new, pink version of the traditionally green coupon. From Tuesday, February 18 through Saturday, March 8, Kohl’s will donate $1 to Komen for every pink Kohl’s Cash coupon redeemed, a minimum of $100,000 up to $1 million.\n\nKohl’s is also featuring a special, pink elephant necklace from the LC Lauren Conrad collection beginning later this month with 100 percent of the proceeds going toward the fight against breast cancer through Kohl’s Cares®, the company’s philanthropic platform. Priced at only $5 and $8 each, two sizes of the necklace will be available while supplies last for a limited time in stores and online.\n\nFor more information about Kohl’s support of women’s causes, please visit www.Kohls.com/Cares.
