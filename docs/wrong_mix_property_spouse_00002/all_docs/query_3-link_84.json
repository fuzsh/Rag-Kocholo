        "text": "Katie Holmes always delivers when it comes to off-duty looks. Whether in a striped button-up boyfriend shirt, or a vintage band T-shirt loosely tucked into relaxed tailored trousers, the actor has perfected the art of casual-cool style (some might call it normcore), while taking care to add in the occasional key statement piece. Her extensive denim collection incorporating an array of silhouettes is unrivalled, and she’s acquired quite the knitwear selection, too. The latest addition to her wardrobe? The dad cardigan.\n\nLet Katie Holmes Teach You How To Dress For Tricky In-Between Weather\n\nGallery5 Photos\n\nView Gallery\n\nFor an outing in New York City, the 43-year-old actor chose a cosy, understated look that couldn’t be easier to emulate. The outfit consisted of a pair of wide-leg blue jeans, a crisp white T-shirt, and a slouchy, oversized cardigan in light brown. Katie accessorised with a navy McNally Jackson tote bag, black cat-eye sunglasses, and white trainers."
