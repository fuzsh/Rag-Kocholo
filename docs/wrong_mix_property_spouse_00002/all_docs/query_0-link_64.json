        "text": "Cruise. Tom Cruise. He is called the brightest star among Hollywood male actors, ascended to the sky in 80s. It seems not so long ago he portrayed in the movies young brave pilots and charming vampires, saved the world from the bad guys and excited the immature girl's heart, but time flies inexorably, in the past year, Tom Cruise has exchanged fifty years. The actor is catastrophically small and has not the most pleasant character, but his smile arises something inside, and the image of \"a guy in the board\" is captivating. It is no wonder that the fair sex still goes crazy over him, and the guys are still trying not to miss the premiere of fighters with his participation. Privacy of star is hotly debated, because the list of amorous conquests such star divas like Nicole Kidman and Penelope Cruz, and at the moment the place of Tom’s ladylove occupies charming Katie Holmes.\n\nTom Cruise and Olga Kurylenko\n\nCruise is incredibly charismatic and charming to the obscene, but more importantly, he has everything and all have long proved. The actor has impressive filmography, several \"Oscars\" in the bank, plump bank account and, of course, his own style, which millions of fans try to emulate. Tom belongs to the category of those rare men who manage to look the best even in a shabby old coat and cap, but the star knows a lot about clothes and accessories himself. He has a kind of astonishing flair in the formation of the image: Tom Cruise knows how to create a luxurious, but simple to genius and simple look - and it is the privilege of the true connoisseurs of beauty.\n\nThe main Hollywood amateur of watches\n\nWristwatches that Tom Cruise wears like in the movies and in real life have long been a separate topic for discussion. By choosing such an important element of the image a handsome fits with all the responsibility, and in his collection there are the best of the best examples of watch making - in full accordance with the preferences and style of the stars, of course.\n\nTom Cruise - watch amateur\n\nInexhaustible love to aviation and Bremont\n\nNot everyone knows about it, but Tom Cruise has owned several aircrafts, which pilots quite well. Naturally, that a relatively young watch brand Bremont has attracted the attention of an actor, because this brand was founded by two former designers of aircraft, and this fact is clearly reflected in their works. ALT1-C chronometer with a dial, which looks like instruments of the old models of aircrafts, from the very moment of its appearance won the hearts of men and appeared in the collections of many stellar people - because in order to appreciate the truly stylish watches, private jet is unnecessarily. And Tom Cruise with his special relation to the celestial wanderings and the thrill of it all, regarded to aviation, it would be a sin not \"stock up\" on an unusual time meter - that's an actor bought a modification of the Bremont ALT1-C with anthracite dial with a strict black strap, which he gladly wears. Manufacturers claim that these watches Tom puts on during flights - however, such details were not confirmed. It is interesting that the price of Bremont ALT1-C watch can be called quite democratic - about five thousand dollars that less well-known and wealthy people themselves could afford such an accessory. But Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise to be higher unnecessary \"show-off\". Let's leave the desire to show off and put on watch \"more expensive and richer\" to young and unrecognized.\n\nTom Cruise with Bremont ALT1-C watch\n\nAn actor watches for further creativity of the company Bremont: in particular, Cruise was spotted at the presentations of acclaimed collection The Supermarine Descent and other novelties of the brand. So, it is likely that the passion to conquer the celestial spaces still play its role.\n\nExclusive and expensive pleasure by Audemars Piguet\n\nMany print and non-print publications called a Swiss chronograph Audemars Piguet a favorite watch of Tom Cruise. Indeed, the creation of this world- famous brand - are frequent visitors to the actor's hand. This fact does not surprise as Audemars Piguet watches are famous for their accurate mechanisms and incredible functionality. And do not forget about the \"specify\" of the brand – an expressive design: somehow prudish classic and sporty style peacefully coexist in these watches. These watches are for the wealthy, successful and not afraid to differ from others ... That is, it turns out, for Tom Cruise!\n\nRoyal Oak Offshore GP Singapur watch\n\nCruise chose a chronograph Royal Oak Offshore GP Singapur with massive case in the form of an octahedron, a bright red guilloche dial and anatomical leather bracelet. Well, it is suitable for a Hollywood heartthrob, who is not used to a deficit of attention. And the number of built-in functions in watches of Tom Cruise's is impressive – with such a instrument there is no problem anywhere.\n\nIWC on the wrist of Tom Cruise - in movies and in life\n\nParticularly warm relations link the actor and watch brand IWC. In the cult movie \"Vanilla Sky\", filmed in 2001, Cruise wears a watch IWC Mark XV.\n\nIWC Mark XV watch of Tom Cruise in the movie \"Vanilla Sky\"\n\nThree years later, the luxury model IWC Vintage Ingenieur Automatic IW3233 time showed time Tom Cruise in the thriller \"Collateral\" in 2004. A star played a hitman named Vincent, and watch was desperately needed – not to miss another murder: this profession, you know, requires punctuality.\n\n\"Collateral\" movie - IWC Vintage Ingenieur Automatic IW3233 watch\n\nApparently, for the filming the actor imbued with all my heart the \"vintage\" model of IWC, because these watches were later seen on his wrist as the prestigious awards (including the MTV Movie Awards), and in everyday life - a walk through New York with his wife and child. The original version of the IWC Vintage Ingenieur Automatic watch was released in back 1955.\n\non the walk with IWC Vintage Ingenieur Automatic watch\n\nInterestingly, the love of Tom Cruise and IWC is mutual. In 2012, the brand introduced the audience the novelty Pilot's Watch collection called Top Gun Miramar. The creators admit that for production of this model they were inspired by the famous film of the same name - a masterpiece of cinema, so to speak, early work of Tom Cruise, filmed in 1986.\n\nWhich wristwatch is mission possible for?\n\nTom Cruise, of course, played in a huge number of films that have become internationally known and loved. But the number 1 on the ratings of a record still remains thriller \"Mission: Impossible\". What kind of watch does Tom Cruise wear in the movie?\n\nInterestingly, the connoisseurs and lovers of watch making have long associated the \"Mission ...\" exceptionally with the masterpiece creation of smart Japanese called Casio G-Shock. In the first part of the film, which appeared in 1996, Cruise's character is actively fighting the bandits, not putting off a wrist the model Casio G-Shock DW-5300.\n\n\"Mission: Impossible\". Tom Cruise. Casio G-Shock DW-5300\n\nThe watch Casio G-Shock appeared in the next part of the film - \"Mission Impossible-2\", but another model - DW- 6900 -1V. In both films, the audience has the opportunity to see all the details, like Tom Cruise turns the backlight on the \"G- shocks\" and uses a timer and a stopwatch. Needless to say, that even after the first part of \"Mission ...\" (not to mention the second), the popularity of watches Casio G-Shock skyrocketed? These watches were immediately bought up not only by the brave police officers and rescue workers, but also the most ordinary citizens. The models \"like at Tom Cruise” have, of course, special demand.\n\n\"Mission: Impossible 2\". Tom Cruise. Casio G-Shock DW-6900-1V\n\nBy the time the shooting of the third part of the movie \"Mission Impossible\" started there was no doubt what watch would wear Tom Cruise (or rather, his character Ethan Hunt ), including from the creators of the film. Moreover, this time the legendary company Paramount Pictures approached the issue in a responsible and signed with the brand Casio contract for the supply of G-Shock watches for filming. And the company Casio, in its turn, promised to develop specifically for the film an interesting novelty that, in fact, did. Thus the watch of Tom Cruise - Casio G-Shock MTG-910D-2V was born, which made the audience all over the world gasp with delight. Still: this watch is RC, retains water resistance up to 200 meters depth and is charged by solar energy. That's it for the savior of the world!\n\n\"Mission: Impossible 3\". Tom Cruise. Casio G-Shock MTG-910D-2V\n\nAnd here is the fourth part of a movie called \"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol\", published in 2011 , has surprised the world is not only with the story and special effects, but also the fact that Tom Cruise has \"changed \" favorite G-Shock and appeared in the shot with the watch Tudor Heritage Chronograph on the wrist. Tudor, as we know, is a subsidiary brand of Rolex, which dares to embody all that is not appropriate for the \"Swiss Legend\" and world known watch brand with good behavior. Tudor Heritage Chronograph model was first presented to the public as part of the annual exhibition BaselWord 2010. Luxury and multi-functional watches were presented under the slogan \"Designed for performance, engineered for elegance\", and almost immediately went on the set of \"Ghost Protocol \". Well, in 2015, the next part of the cult action movie - 'Mission Impossible 5” will be on screens. Let us see in what watch at this time Tom will appear before the audience. That's what I understand - the intrigue!\n\n\"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol\". Tom Cruise. Tudor Heritage Chronograph\n\nThe particular confusion in the \"Minority Report\"\n\nAnother interesting to madness in \"watch\" plan a movie Tom of Cruise - it's sci-fi thriller \"Minority Report\" of 2002. There was almost scandal after the release of the film in theaters! The fact that the main character John Anderton from the beginning of the film was wearing a watch Omega Speedmaster X- 33, which can be clearly seen in many frames. But in the moment when the Cruise's hero is looking at time, counting the minutes before the murder, we see… watch display of Bvlgari! But this \"magical transformation\" does not end there: Tom Cruise turned away from the watch - and they again become Omega. You can see it with your own eyes in the episode, when the hero was hiding in the cold water of spiders scanners. Was it \"mistake\" or strange idea the author is uncertain. Maybe the filmmakers signed a contract with Omega, and Bvlgari - here they had to get out somehow...?\n\nOmega Speedmaster X-33 watch in the movie \"Minority report\"\n\nHowever, the attentive and avid audience was in doubt by another fact: after all, the film is set in the future, and it is strange enough, that on the wrist of the hero from 2054 is the watch, which can be easily purchased in the store at the beginning of the century.\n\nBvlgari watch in the movie \"Minority report\"\n\nA few more facts of Tom Cruise’s watches \"filmography\"\n\nBy 2005, Omega watches, it seems, \"won\" in the life of Tom Cruise. Anyway, in the movie \"War of the Worlds\" on the hand of the actor was Omega. Do you remember the moment when electricity turned off, and only this watch continued to operate well? It was the genius hidden advertising, in my opinion.\n\nOmega watch in the movie \"War of the Worlds\"\n\nBut in the comedy action \"Tropic Thunder\" of 2008 watch of Tom Cruise in the role of forests Grossman viewer can be clearly seen: it is the Panerai PAM 63 GMT.\n\nPanerai PAM 63 GMT watch in the comedy action \"Tropic Thunder\"\n\nIf we go back to the very beginning of an acting career of Tom Cruise, we can recall the melodrama \"Jerry Maguire\", filmed in 1996. There the Cruise's character is \"all the rage\" at the time - watch TAG Heuer S/el Chronograph.\n\nItalian passion of the famous actor: watches U-Boat, Panerai, Anonimo Firenze, Locman\n\nAlthough Tom Cruise does not have an impressive size or brutality, but it turned out, he adores sports motorcycles, as well as a massive watches. And the Italian brand U-Boat, famous of watches with large dial and original design, occupies a symbolic place in his collection. Cruise looks corny (sorry, Tom, but it's true) - the model Flightdeck CAS 50mm by the U-Boat looks at him very harmonious. That is, as they say, scoundrel ... uh, handsome all-to-face.\n\nTom Cruise with U-Boat Flightdeck CAS 50 mm watch\n\nThe other watch brand from Italy won the hearts of Tom Cruise, we have already mentioned it, is, of course, Panerai. After the release of the movie, by the way, the actor was repeatedly seen in the Panerai watches outside the shooting area - so Panerai PAM 63 GMT pleased him. However, there are other models of the brand in the collection of star. Panerai watches for Tom Cruise - it is harmonious and natural extension of the cinematic image. Seriously, to save someone or something in this watch – is a sweet deal, but in everyday life it is invaluable. Panerai chronographs are not burdened with unnecessary complexity, everything is straightforward, clear and very reliable. Cases of at least 45 mm in diameter, indexes, which only the blind cannot see, luminescence, high water resistance, a special crown protection system ... It seems it was just made for Tom Cruise and his epic heroes!\n\nA little later, it became clear that another \"sultry Italian\" - a Florentine company Anonimo Firenze - charmed the owner of the most magnificent smile of Dreamland. Innovative, high-tech and ultra-reliable watch, skillfully executed in the style of military, the best fit into the image of a superhero. Mechanical watches in stainless steel will not fail even in the extreme situation - in this case it is not a toy, but an accessory for a real man, who Tom Cruise, no doubt, is.\n\nTom Cruise with Anonimo Firenze watch\n\nBut the most crazy (in all senses) Italian passion of Tom Cruise - is, perhaps, watches Locman. There is no hint of the military: the brand, as known, is famous of predilection for the grotesque, the eternal diversity and the craziest design solutions. Huge cases, iridescent dials, strange hands and large numeric indexes - these are the components of corporate handwriting of Locman. Is it unusual? There is no doubt. Indeed, these \"freaks\" do not really tally with the media image of Tom Cruise, but stars are also people... And their soul asks for a holiday. By the way, superheroes also need holidays.\n\nNothing human is alien\n\nOf course, the man whom the entire planet knows by the skill with which he fights evil and saves the world, ought not to wear a frivolous glamour watch – and Tom Cruise proves it by his example. This chic, charming actor, maddening women of all nationalities, ages and professions, mainly adheres to a strict, masculine style of clothing and accessories. And all (except the last) watches, which we discussed above, are functional, ergonomic and reliable.\n\nTom Cruise with Graham watch\n\nBut for the inhabitants of stardom, unfortunately or fortunately, nothing human is alien. So, perfect to dizziness Tom Cruise can still fancy pranks like \"crazy Italian watches\" by the company Locman. Our hero has been seen in fashion watches Lacoste and PlayBoy, though only descended from the pages of that glossy magazine. The case in green with logo \"crocodile\" and a crocodile strap look quite shocking - but why not? Especially, a qualitative mechanism is hidden in the bright “shell”.\n\nTom Cruise and Katie Holmes\n\nOn the masculine wrist of Tom Cruise's was also \"shining\" glamorous diamond watch creations of the brand Jacob & Co and the embodiment of luxury and kitsch cheeky called Gucci... It does not fit with the overall image and reputation of the actor - such pranks would come up soon, God forgive me, to some Justin Bieber, but not an adult and consisted actor. On the other hand, Cruise can afford it - he will still be a style icon. Strictly speaking, what watch Tom Cruise wears, will not change anything, people adored him and will adore. And to treat an internal tee is allowable luxury.\n\nThe best enterprising Chinese\n\nOne outrageous, but a very funny story is connected with watches of Tom Cruise. Some craftsmen from China (or rather, from the Guangdong ) produced the so-called homage of the watch of one obscenely well-known brand and, stuck next to a photograph a portrait of a Hollywood actor. The result is a pretty Adv: \"Tom Cruise wears a watch Sangdo\". Understandably, Cruise does not know about such a \"pranks\", but the news had spread all instantly watch forums on the internet and most nimble visitors began to practice in wit. Particularly pleased with the sentence like \"Watch Sangdo, of course, matches to Tom Cruise, but if he deserves to be ambassador of the brand?\"\n\nAdvertising of Sangdo - \"Tom Cruise wears Sangdo watch\"\n\nIf we put aside all joking aside, the case is unfair and even cognizable. But it is hardly an actor of this magnitude will plead with the Chinese manufacturer, so I suggest not to take this incident seriously. Here in a provincial town, for example, Bruce Willis \"touts\" regional branch of a local bank - at least his face is on billboards. The downside of fame, gentlemen!\n\nWatches of Tom Cruise as a chapter in the fashion history\n\n\"Mere mortals\" desperately seek to emulate stars - and that's a fact. Trendsetters are the ones who most often appears on the spectacular and wide screens. In this regard, several bindings such as “player as at J. Lo “ or \"mobile phone like at Keanu Reeves\" appeared. So, \"watch of Tom Cruise \" – it is also already entirely separate concept and phenomenon. The actor is certainly versed in watches, and he himself, as well as his characters in the movie, chooses only the best gauges of time. And in those rare moments when the perfect flavor and unmistakable flair, it would seem, alter Tom - he probably just laugh at the world around. Many watch brands would dream to get this handsome in their advertising campaign:\n\nTom Cruise on the red carpet with watch\n\nCruise has an interesting fate, a brilliant career and a scandalous reputation, his characters are role models, his style – is the subject of heated debate. Therefore the theme \"What watch does Tom Cruise wear today?\" never run its course."
