        "text": "My focus\n\nI have more than twenty years of trial, arbitration, and counseling experience involving the management of complex business disputes and disputes involving law firms.\n\nGeneral Commercial Litigation\n\nI counsel businesses and their owners, officers, and investors in a wide range of disputes, including large business transactions (such as distribution and purchase agreements), life sciences and medical devices, food and beverage disputes, fiduciary duty claims, data privacy matters, and dissolution and valuation. I regularly represent Fortune 500 and other large business clients in litigation in Illinois, California, Delaware, New York and other venues throughout the country in a variety of business disputes relating to their agreements and operations. Some of my relevant recent experience includes the following:\n\nLead counsel for multiple corporations in post-transaction disputes (including earnout, fraud, and indemnity disputes) pending in Delaware, Illinois and New York.\n\nLead counsel for multiple corporations and/or investors in corporate governance disputes in California, Delaware, Illinois and New York.\n\nLead counsel for multiple corporations in trade secret, trademark and non-compete disputes in California, Delaware, Illinois, New York and Virginia.\n\nIn 2021–2022, lead counsel for a start-up pharmaceutical company in expedited arbitration under New York law relating to a series of incorrectly calculated earnout payments. The arbitrator awarded our client more than $3 million in reimbursement, plus pre- and post-judgment interest, as well as nearly all of our clients’ attorneys’ fees and costs as the prevailing party.\n\nIn 2021-present, lead counsel in Delaware for the former shareholders of Plated, a meal delivery and subscription service, relating to a multi-million dollar earnout claim.\n\nIn 2019-2021, lead counsel for large pharmaceutical company in expedited trial in Delaware Chancery Court claiming fraud against defendant (a biotech company) including a non-compete violation. Following a six-day bench trial, the Court found in our client’s favor on this fraud claim. The Court later awarded over $49 million in damages and pre-judgment interest to our client. Media coverage of the win is here and here.\n\nIn 2020-2022, lead counsel for drug compounder that successfully obtained dismissal of a competitor’s claim for unfair competition based on federal preemption, which further defeated competitor’s motion for preliminary injunction, in the Central District of California. Successful in securing affirmance of the dismissal at the Ninth Circuit. Watch the argument before the Ninth Circuit here.\n\nIn 2020-2021, lead litigation counsel for a large real estate developer in Nevada defending against a $35 million claim. The dispute was successfully resolved following the assertion of a counterclaim and significant motion practice.\n\nIn 2020-2021, lead litigation counsel for a regional company in Illinois involved in multimillion-dollar claims and counter-claims with a former business partner. After the former business partner sought a preliminary injunction, we obtained an order barring a key witness for the former business partner, and soon after, the matter settled.\n\nIn 2019-present, lead litigation counsel for 10+ companies spread among various industries defending against claims relating to Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). In one circuit court case, John’s team successfully argued that the accrual date for BIPA purposes was the first date that the challenged device was used, not each subsequent use, which resulted in the dismissal of the plaintiff’s claims.\n\nIn 2019-2020, lead counsel for large international manufacturing company in expedited arbitration in New York defending against claim seeking injunctive relief (which was withdrawn following responsive briefing) and damages. The arbitration panel rejected the claimant’s entire claim for millions in lost business value and its request for over $1.2 million in attorneys’ fees.\n\nIn 2018, lead counsel for three California companies facing a more than $25 million alter ego levy claim brought by the United States on behalf of the IRS. Through focused and aggressive discovery, we defeated the United States’ motion for summary judgment and resolved the case for less than 10% of the claim.\n\nRecently represented a Fortune 500 life sciences company in Illinois in a dispute involving its Cellular Therapy business and the use of stem cells for chronic myocardial ischemia and critical limb ischemia.\n\nRepresented a company that received a cease and desist letter of its operations and its enrollment of new students from the State of Illinois.

I also represent large law firms in their disputes with their former clients.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nAs litigation costs continue to rise, I see growing client demand for alternative-fee arrangements, including discounted rates coupled with “banked” fees and success fees.
