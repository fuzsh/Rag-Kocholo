        "text": "After almost 20 years, Tom Cruise is looking to offload his beloved home away from home in the picturesque mountains of Telluride, Colorado.\n\nThe 298-acre property - purchased during his marriage to second wife Nicole Kidman in the '90s - which provided a sanctuary for the private star away from prying eyes, has been listed by Telluride Sothebyâ€™s International Realty for a cool $59 million.\n\nThe almost 10,000-square-foot estate was of course the setting for the Vanity Fair shoot in which he and then-wife Katie Holmes introduced their baby girl Suri to the world back in 2006, while they spent their precious first few months as a new family holed up there together during that summer.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nAnd while the actor maintained ownership of the sprawling property following his divorce from his third wife, his estate agent Bill Fandel tells The Wall Street Journal he has decided to sell the home as he hasn't had the time or opportunity to go there as much as he would like in recent years.\n\nThe main house, which was constructed in an authentic wooden lodge style, features four bedrooms and six bathrooms, as well as cosy log fires to keep the place warn during those cooler winter months.\n\nIt comes complete with a spacious library and an additional recreation room perfect for entertaining children and the young at heart.\n\nWhile the outdoors is all too inviting, with a private trail system leading to some of the most spectacular mountain views in the state, perfect for a brisk walk or run, there's also a gym for those cold or rainy days.\n\nThe gated compound also features a sports court which can be used for basketball, tennis and even transformed into an ice hockey rink.\n\nPerfect for visiting family and friends, there's also a sizeable 1,600-square-foot guesthouse on the property complete with three bedrooms and three bathrooms.\n\nAccording to the 52-year-old's realtor, the Mission: Impossible star completed construction on the native stone and cedar home in 1994.\n\nIn the two decades since, plenty of gorgeous green foliage has sprung up around it, with towering ponderosa pine and Douglas fir trees provide the ultimate natural seclusion.\n\nWhile several properties acquired during his five-and-a-half-year marriage to Katie were divided up during their divorce, Cruise's Telluride mansion - which is an easy 12-minute drive from downtown and the Telluride Ski Resort - was not among them."
