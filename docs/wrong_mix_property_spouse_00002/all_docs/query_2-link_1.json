        "text": "Katie Holmes is planning a new career away from screens.\n\nThe 45-year-old actress - who shot to fame on teen show Dawson's Creek in the 1990s - has branched out into writing and directing movies in recent years but she is now hoping to put pen to paper to work on fiction novels.\n\nKatie has also been working on a number of fashion projects - including a collaboration with French brand APC - but she also hopes to eventually branch out into beauty and launch her own line.\n\nShe told The Sunday Times newspaper: \"I'd like to continue to write and direct my own films. Maybe write a few books - fiction [...] I would love to [launch a beauty line].\"\n\nIt comes after Katie opened up about her time as a teen star playing Joey Potter on Dawson's Creek - admitting she never wanted to be seen as \"sexy\".\n\nKatie revealed that during her time on the drama series she would have someone come along to photoshoots with her to make sure that she wasn't too sexualised on screen or in publicity shoots because she \"just wanted to be an actor.\"\n\nShe told Glamour magazine: \"I didn't want to be the sexy young thing. I am not sexy. I used to have a friend of mine come to all my photo shoots to make sure that they didn't try to make me that way! I guess I just wanted to be an actor.\"\n\nShe also also insisted there are no plans to bring the show back for a new generation of teens. During the Kering Women in Motion talk series at Cannes Film Festival, Katie said: \"For now, we kind of just keeping saying that until there is a real reason to do it, it hasn't been something where people have said, 'This is the take on it'.\"\n\nIt comes after Katie's 18-year-old daughter Suri, who she shares with ex Tom Cruise, ditched her Hollywood star dad's last name and is instead going by a new moniker, which gave a telling sign that she wasn't after anything to do with her Hollywood star dad.\n\nAccording to Hello! Magazine, Suri's new title is simply Suri Noelle and was spotted in the playbill of her school production of The Go-Go's jukebox musical, Head Over Heels. The new name would see Suri taking on the middle name of her mum, while completely blanking any link to Tom, 61.\n\nTom is said to have felt guilty after missing his daughter's birthday and was ready to reconnect. A source told Heat shortly after her celebration: \"Tom is feeling guilty about missing so much of her life, but insists that he hasn’t completely shut Suri out of his life, and does get updates from time to time.\" They added Tom had made the deal to \"allow her and her mother to live their own lives because that was what Katie wanted\".\n\nTom's lack of involvement in his daughter's life has been widely reported. According to Katie and Tom's divorce documents, the Top Gun star agreed to pay his ex-wife $400,000 (£319,000) per year until Suri turned 18. Tom also agreed to pay all of his daughter's expenses, which are said to have included \"medical, dental, insurance, education, college and other extracurricular costs\"."
