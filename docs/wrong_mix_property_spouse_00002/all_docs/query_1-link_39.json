        "text": "Suri Cruise is growing up so fast!\n\nThe daughter of Katie Holmes and ex-husband Tom Cruise made a rare social media appearance to share insight into her post-high school plans. Suri, 18, was seen in a recent TikTok video honoring “commitment day,” in which she and her classmates celebrated their chosen colleges.\n\nThe clip featured Suri, 18, sporting a Carnegie Mellon University sweatshirt, seemingly confirming that she’ll be attending the prestigious school after graduation. Carnegie Mellon is located in Pittsburgh and known for its acclaimed drama and computer science programs.\n\nKatie has spoken in the past about wanting to protect her daughter’s privacy throughout childhood, but that doesn’t mean she’s kept Suri in the dark – especially when it comes to certain pop culture classics!\n\nKatie revealed in an interview with Variety last year that Suri has indeed watched the classic teen soap that made her mom famous.\n\n“She has seen ‘Dawson’s Creek’ and I think it’s probably weird since she’s a teenager. I’m not like, ‘You need to watch mommy’s work,'” Katie recalled at the time, noting how the viewing was a full circle experience.\n\n“But during the pandemic, we had a good laugh about it. It’s wild to have a daughter who’s almost the same age as I was when I began all this,” she added.\n\nThough Suri has stayed mostly out of the spotlight she did collab with her mom on more than one important project in recent years.\n\nKatie wrote, directed and starred in the 2022 romantic comedy “Alone Together” and had Suri lend her voice to a cover of “Blue Moon” used in the opening credits.\n\nThe proud mom told Yahoo Entertainment at the time that she only looks for “the highest level of talent,” so it makes sense that Suri was an obvious choice for her!\n\nIn fact, Suri showed off her vocal chops once again for Katie’s follow-up feature, last year’s “Rare Objects.”"
