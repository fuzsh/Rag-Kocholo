If anything, they contribute more to the hype of the already well-known, exclusive event. What we were surprised to see, however, were major Chinese stars not only making an appearance at New York’s Fall/Winter 2014 Fashion Week this year but honored with front row seats as well!\n\nChinese celebrities photographed at the event included actress Zhang Lanxin (å¼ è“å¿ƒ), who was seen at Diane Von Furstenburg’s show with ballet dancer Hou Honglan (ä¾¯å®æ¾œ), as well as the TV show host, Li Siyu (æŽæ–¯ç¾½). Seated at Tory Burch was their “It girl” and Chinese actress/model Zhang Xin Yuan, who is reported to have 1.3 million followers on Weibo (China’s equivalent of Twitter).\n\nThis new honor bestowed on Chinese celebrities is a win-win situation for everyone: The celebrities get the best views of the latest collections of top designers and, in return, the top designers gain more publicity (and customers!) in the world’s fastest growing economy. According to Jing Daily, designer Tory Burch is even taking it one step further – her team is working to promote live-streamed shows in China, so that fans can also follow the event from the comfort of their own homes."
