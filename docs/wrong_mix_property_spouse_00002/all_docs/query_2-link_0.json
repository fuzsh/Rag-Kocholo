        "text": "Katie Holmes left Scientology with a \"secret weapon\" when her daughter Suri Cruise was younger, which came amid her split from Top Gun actor Tom Cruise.\n\nTom Cruise, 61, was married to Katie Holmes, 45, from 2006 until 2012. It was in June 2012 when Katie shocked the world as she filed for divorce after seven years together and six years of marriage, with Katie aided by the help of her divorce lawyer father.\n\nWhen the couple split in 2012, it was reported that Katie had chosen to end the couple's marriage because of Scientology - the religion that Tom is dedicated to. Reports claim that Katie was worried about raising Suri as a Scientologist.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Inside Suri's 'estranged' relationship with her father Tom Cruise as she turns 18\n\nWhy Tom Cruise has lost contact with daughter Suri\n\nDue to Katie's decision to quit the religion and divorce Tom, the actor and his daughter have seemingly drifted apart over the years with very minimal contact. Katie was given \"sole custody\" of the couple's daughter, and according to reports on their divorce papers, Tom agreed to pay Katie $400,000 a year until Suri turned 18 years old.\n\nIn a defamation lawsuit against Bauer Media in 2013, Tom admitted he hadn’t seen Suri for three months. \"Listen, when there is a divorce… things change,\" he said in a deposition. \"It’s not an ideal scene. It’s not an ideal situation.\"\n\nAnd in 2019, author Samantha Domingo told American magazine Us Weekly that Tom was not allowed to have a relationship with Suri because she is not a Scientologist.\n\nHow Katie kept Suri away from Scientology\n\nThe breakdown of the marriage and Katie's exit from Scientology came after members of the Church of Scientology reportedly moved into the couple's home to keep an eye on the couple and make sure their most valuable celebrity was being properly taken care of, according to reports.\n\nAlthough exiting Scientology is said to be risky, with divorcing a high-profile celebrity also considered so, Katie had a \"secret weapon\" - her divorce attorney father, Martin Holmes. PEOPLE magazine reported that Katie turned to Martin for advice before making any moves to split from Tom and that he \"helped orchestrate his daughter's sudden split\" from the actor.\n\nAt the time, the magazine reported an attorney saying: \"Marty is very rigid – it's his way or the highway. Marty believes there are only two sets of rules: the rules of the court and his rules, and he carries himself that way.\"\n\nKatie's father attended the University of Toledo Law School and had been a member of the Ohio Bar since 1971. Reports claimed that he practiced in areas including personal injury, business litigation, probate and matrimonial law, at the time of his daughter's split.\n\nReports around the time of Katie and Tom's split revealed that Katie's father and his wife Kathy felt that the Mission Impossible star was controlling their daughter. But although reports claimed Katie's parents were weary over their daughter's romance, Martin was always publicly supportive of Tom.\n\nKatie also denied tension at the time, with the star speaking to Vanity Fair in 2006. She said: \"Some of the c**p that’s out there – the stuff that’s said about my parents and my siblings [not hitting it off with Tom], it’s really frustrating.\""
