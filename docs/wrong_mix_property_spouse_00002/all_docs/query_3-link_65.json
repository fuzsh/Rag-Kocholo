        "text": "Katie Holmes will make her directorial debut and star in the mother-daughter drama “All We Had,” based on the Annie Weatherwax novel.\n\nTribeca Prods. partner Jane Rosenthal will produce with VP of production Berry Welsh. Josh Boone, director of “The Fault in Our Stars,” has come on board to adapt the script.\n\nHolmes optioned “All We Had” in July and Scribner published the book, Weatherwax’s debut novel, on Aug. 5. The story centers on a mother and her 13-year-old daughter, living on the edge of poverty, who find an unlikely home amid the quirky residents of small town America.\n\n“I am very excited and honored to be collaborating with Jane and Josh on this project and look so forward to bringing Annie’s incredible characters to the screen,” said Holmes.\n\nHolmes stars as a vigilante in dark comedy “Miss Meadows,” which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and will be released in November by Entertainment One. She’s also been filming the Helen Mirren drama “The Woman in Gold.”\n\nRosenthal’s producing credits include “The Good Shepherd,” “Rent,” “Meet the Parents,” “Meet the Fockers” and “Little Fockers.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“Katie has such a clear vision for the book’s irreverent, original mother-daughter relationship,” Rosenthal said. “Her passion for the material, along with Josh Boone’s ability to tell stories grounded in the comedy and drama of everyday, will truly bring these characters to life.”\n\nHolmes is repped by Untitled Entertainment, ICM, and Sloan, Offer, Weber and Dern. Both Rosenthal and Boone are repped by CAA."
