        "text": "Tom Cruise is suing Life & Style magazine for $50million over claims that he abandoned his daughter Suri in the wake of his divorce from Katie Holmes. The actor's lawyer confirmed to The Wrap that Cruise had officially filed a defamation suit against the publication in Los Angeles yesterday. The lawsuit was prompted by an article that Life & Style ran in July with the headline, 'Suri in Tears: Abandoned by Her Dad'. In the piece, a source claimed that Cruise was not involved with his daughter's life following his divorce from Suri's mother, Katie Holmes. The 50-year-old star's attorney, Bert Fields, insisted that while Cruise prefers not to sue tabloids, the Top Gun actor felt compelled to ensure the truth about his relationship with his daughter Suri was clarified. Fields claimed: \"When these sleaze peddlers try to make money with disgusting lies about his relationship with his child, you bet he's going to sue.\" He added: \"These serial defamers are foreign owned companies with their global headquarters in Hamburg... Having to pay a libel judgment may slow them down. Tom will undoubtedly give the money to charity. He always has.\" Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise after six years of marriage in June of this year, with the divorce being completed just under two months later.\n\nTOM'S WOMEN - FROM LOCKLEAR TO HOLMES\n\nKATIE HOLMES' STYLE EVOLUTION\n\nMORE SHOCKING SPLITS\n\nSOURCE: THE WRAP\n\nOn 22 August 2012, we wrote...Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes' marriage is officially over, after a New York judge signed off on the final divorce judgement on Monday.\n\nHolmes filed divorce papers to end the five-year marriage in June, citing \"irreconcilable differences\".\n\nIn a statement released last month, the pair said: \"We are committed to working together as parents to accomplish what is in our daughter Suri's best interests. We want to keep matters affecting our family private and express our respect for each other's commitment to each of our respective beliefs and support each other's roles as parents.\"\n\nIt is not yet known how the couple's fortune was divided, although under the terms of the pre-nup, it is thought that Holmes collected $3million a year, entitling her to $15million, plus a home for her and her daughter.\n\nThe pair are both thought to be moving on with their separate lives and Holmes was recently spotted having dinner with a mystery man in New York.\n\nSOURCE: DAILY MAIL\n\nOn 30 July 2012, we wrote...\n\nKatie Holmes has been spotted out on a dinner date with a mystery man in New York.\n\nThe actress, who split from husband Tom Cruise a few weeks ago, apparently enjoyed a meal with a male acquaintance at the NoMad restaurant on Friday (27 July).\n\nShe kissed the man on the cheek before saying goodnight to him and hailing a cab. On the way out, she told TMZ cameras that she had a \"great\" night.\n\nThe star made her way back to the $12,000-a-month apartment she is living in with her daughter, Suri Cruise, in Chelsea, Manhattan.\n\nTOM'S WOMEN - FROM LOCKLEAR TO HOLMES\n\nKATIE HOLMES' STYLE EVOLUTION\n\nMORE SHOCKING SPLITS\n\nSOURCE: TMZ\n\nOn 24 July 2012, we wrote...\n\nTom Cruise is thought to be considering a move to New York to be closer to his daughter. The 50-year-old actor has reportedly told friends that he wants to be nearer to Suri, since Katie Holmes moved to the city on a permanent basis. Speaking to Page Six, an insider said: \"Tom's looking for a new home here. He wants a fresh start. He doesn't want to go back to the East Village apartment where he was living with Katie.\" Meanwhile, another source has revealed that Cruise's top priority is maintaining his privacy.\n\n\"[He doesn't want to] have to deal with going through a lobby, and people outside all the time,\" the mole said. \"He also wants to have a nice amount of space for Suri, with outdoor space. That could mean high-end luxury apartments, but he's also looking at houses outside of the city or in gated communities.\" News of Cruise's potential move to the city comes just days after he was reunited with his six-year-old daughter in Manhattan. A spokesperson for Cruise had declined to comment on whether the actor will move from LA.\n\nSOURCE: PAGE SIX\n\nOn 20 July 2012, we wrote...Katie Holmes is set to return to Broadway, following her split from husband Tom Cruise.\n\nThe actress has signed up to star in Theresa Rebeck's play Dead Account in the autumn.\n\nThe production, which will be put on a the Music Box Theatre, will be directed by three-time Tony Award winner Jack O'Brien.\n\nHolmes is no stranger to the Broadway stage, having appeared in All My Sons in 2008.\n\nTOM'S WOMEN - FROM LOCKLEAR TO HOLMES\n\nKATIE HOLMES' STYLE EVOLUTION\n\nMORE SHOCKING SPLITS\n\nSOURCE: US MAGAZINE\n\nOn 18 July 2012, we wrote...\n\nKatie Holmes and Suri Cruise have been involved in a car crash in New York.\n\nHolmes was picking up her six-year-old daughter from a gymnastics class when their chauffeur-driven Mercedes collided with a rubbish truck.\n\nThough the car itself was badly damaged and dented, nobody was injured in the accident.\n\nPolice were called to the scene of the crash, but the pair had fled before they arrived.\n\nSpeaking to the New York Post, a police officer said of the incident: \"It was nothing major other than the fact that it was Katie Holmes.\"\n\nYesterday, Tom Cruise was reunited with his daughter for the first time since his divorce from Katie Holmes was reported.\n\nThe actor apparently picked his daughter up from Holmes' apartment, but did not have any contact with his estranged wife. He was said to have stayed in the house for no less than five minutes before leaving to spend the next few days with Suri.\n\nCruise finished filming his latest movie, Oblivion, in California yesterday.\n\nSOURCE: NEW YORK POST, TMZ\n\nOn 13 July 2012, we wrote...\n\nTom Cruise's lawyer has threatened the National Enquirer with a multi-million pound lawsuit after the magazine claims the actor \"tortured\" Katie Holmes in his \"house of horrors\".\n\nThe front cover of the current issue claims that the actor dished out ritual \"abuse\", \"punishments\" and \"humiliation\" at his home, while the article itself claims that Suri was made to stay in a \"tiny, windowless room\" for five months.\n\nSince then, The Hollywood Reporter posted a letter by Cruise's lawyer, Bertram Fields, to the National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc, in which he describes the article as \"disgraceful and lurid\" and \"riddled with lies\".\n\nThe letter goes on to claim that the story will cause Cruise \"hundreds of millions of dollars of professional and personal damages, for which [Cruise's team] intend to hold American Media, and everyone who participated in the perpetuation of this scurrilous attack, jointly and severally liable.\"\n\nOn the cover's allegation that Cruise is a \"monster\", Fields wrote: \"Mr Cruise is certainly not a 'monster'. He is a caring father, a hardworking actor and, above all, an honest, decent man.\"\n\nThe letter concludes by demanding that the National Enquirer retracts \"each and every one of [its] false assertions\".\n\nSOURCE: THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER\n\nOn 12 July 2012, we wrote...\n\nKatie Holmes confided in Nicole Kidman before filing for divorce, it has been reported.\n\nThe Aussie actress, who was married to Tom Cruise for 11 years, has apparently been a close confident to Holmes ever since the star married the actor in 2006.\n\nAccording to US Weekly, Holmes made several secret calls to Kidman on a throw-away mobile phone in the build up to the split.\n\nOne source told the publication: \"Nicole has been supportive, saying she's been through it too and to hang in there.\n\n\"She has been a private friend not many people know about.\"\n\nThe report goes on to speculate that Holmes reached out to Kidman over fears for her daughter Suri's education and welfare.\n\nCruise divorced Kidman in 2001, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nSOURCE: US WEEKLY\n\nOn 11 July 2012, we wrote...\n\nKatie Holmes has allegedly been forced to sign a confidentiality agreement to prevent her from talking about her split from Tom Cruise - or from revealing any details about the couple's relationship with the Church Of Scientology.\n\nThe gagging order is thought to have been a major condition in the former couple's divorce settlement.\n\nA source apparently told US site TMZ: \"Confidentiality was the key. If Katie hadn't signed up to remain silent it could have become a very messy legal battle.\"\n\nIn return for the clause, Holmes reportedly asked for strict restrictions on the religious beliefs imposed on six-year-old Suri Cruise, of whom she received primary custody of in the settlement.\n\nThis request is thought to be a small part of an \"incredibly detailed\" agreement, which covers several aspects of Suri's life and care until she is the age of 18.\n\nSOURCE: TMZ\n\nOn 9 July 2012, we wrote...\n\nTom Cruise and Katie Holmes have reached a divorce settlement, their reps have confirmed.\n\n\"We are committed to working together as parents to accomplish what is in our daughter Suri's best interests. We want to keep matters affecting our family private and express our respect for each other's commitment to each of our respective beliefs and support each other's roles as parents,\" says the joint statement from Holmes and Cruise's reps, Nanci Ryder and Amanda Lundberg.\n\nNo other details have been given, but it is thought that lawyers on both sides are working on an arrangement whereby Suri lives with her mother in New York. However, her father will retain generous visitation rights.\n\nHolmes announced that she was divorcing her husband of five years on Friday 29 June 2012; a decision which is thought to have blindsided the actor.\n\nSince the announcement, Katie has been seen out and about in New York with her daughter, while Tom Cruise has kept a low profile, filming his new movie, Oblivion, in Iceland.\n\nSOURCE: PEOPLE\n\nAt 09.30, we wrote...\n\nTom Cruise is apparently in \"major crisis mode\" as Katie Holmes steps up the fight for their daughter, Suri.\n\nThe actress has been spending a large amount of time at her Manhattan attorney's office over the weekend, while Tom has not been photographed for over a week.\n\n\"Tom's whole life . . . is being torn apart,\" an insider said. \"He is on the phone with his lawyers 24/7... trying to hash this out\".\n\nIt is thought that the actor is keen to settle the divorce and custody proceedings without going to court because he \"doesn't want his entire life laid out for everyone to dissect anymore.\"\n\n\"Every move she made and everything she did was controlled . . . [Katie] felt like she was in Rosemary's Baby,\" a source from the Katie camp said. \"She felt she had to get out to save her daughter.\"\n\nSOURCE: USMAGAZINE\n\nOn 9 July 2012, we wrote...\n\nKatie Holmes has broken her silence on her split from Tom Cruise.\n\nThe actress apparently remained coy about the split when she was seen out shopping with Suri Cruise in New York yesterday.\n\nHowever, when asked by one reporter how she was doing after the break down of her marriage, she replied: \"I'm alright. Thank you.\"\n\nA source added that Holmes was \"doing as well as can be expected,\" adding, \"She's not going to hide. She's going to live her life.\"\n\nIn other news, Holmes is set show her fashion label, Holmes & Yang, at New York Fashion Week this September.\n\nThe actress launched the label with her design partner Jeanne Yang in 2009, and will present her new collection during the shows for the first time.\n\nSpeaking to WWD, a rep for Holmes said that her plans for the fashion label would continue to go ahead, despite splitting from Tom Cruise last week.\n\nSOURCE: NEW YORK DAILY NEWS, WWD\n\nOn 4 July 2012, we wrote...\n\nTom Cruise banned Katie Holmes from agreeing to a Dawson's Creek reunion, it has been alleged.\n\nHolmes was apparently keen to team up with her former co-stars Michelle Williams, James Van Der Beek and Joshua Jackson for a Dawson's Creek movie, US Weekly has claimed.\n\nHowever, the gossip mag reports that the reunion failed to go ahead because Cruise was less than impressed by the idea.\n\n\"[Producers] were begging her to sign on for a reunion movie,\" a source alleged. \"Tom said absolutely no way and thought going backward would be bad.\" The insider added: \"[Holmes] didn't care how 'low-brow' he thinks Dawson's Creek is. She wanted to do the movie and reconnect with her fans.\"\n\nSOURCE: US WEEKLY\n\nOn 4 July 2012, we wrote...\n\nKatie Holmes has been seen for the first time since filing from divorce from Tom Cruise last week.\n\nThe 33-year-old actress looked particularly stylish in a slicked back pony tail and a wrap-around blue dress as she was pictured heading in to film a guest spot on Project Runway: All Stars in New York yesterday.\n\nThe star was smiling, and seemed to be in good spirits as she made her way into Parsons The New School Of Design, where the pre-arranged taping was being filmed. It was the first time she has been seen without her five-carat diamond and her wedding ring since she married the star five years ago. She seemed to reference the fact she was band-free, too, by holding her hand up for all to see.\n\nAccording to Project Runway judge Isaac Mizrahi, Holmes was \"professional and upbeat\" throughout filming, telling People magazine after the show, \"She did great.\"\n\nHolmes has also hired a new publicist to help her through this difficult transitional phase of her career. The actress has left Slate PR and signed with BWR Public Relations, where she will be represented by Leslie Sloane in New York and Nanci Ryder in LA.\n\nIn other news, Holmes is apparently set to get nothing from the couple's divorce settlement, as she was cut out of Cruise's fortune in their prenup. TMZ report that Holmes will walk away from the marriage with little more than she went in with, and that reports she's set to take home $15-20million from the split are absurd. \"She's not about the money. She's not that girl. She loves to work,\" a source close to Holmes told them.\n\nMeanwhile, Tom Cruise was spotted catching a helicopter in Reykjavik, Iceland, where he flew out to film his new sci-fi movie, Oblivion.\n\nHe will celebrate his 50th birthday today on set. According to sources, the star is \"totally devastated and heartbroken\" by the split.\n\nSOURCE: DAILY MAIL, PEOPLE, ENTS NEWS\n\nOn 3 July 2012, we wrote...\n\nKatie Holmes filed for divorce from Tom Cruise in New York in order to secure custody of Suri Cruise, several sources have suggested.\n\nAccording to reports, the state law in New York will give her a better chance of getting sole custody of her daughter than if she had filed them elsewhere.\n\nHowever, an insider has revealed that Cruise is asking for the divorce proceedings in New York to be halted, because Holmes doesn't have full residency there.\n\n\"Cruise is going to assert that Katie doesn't meet the residency requirements to file in New York, and that both live full time in California, specifically Los Angeles,\" a source revealed.\n\nIn California, the actor will ask for joint custody of Suri.\n\n\"Cruise is going to assert that Katie doesn't meet the residency requirements to file in New York, and that both live full time in California, specifically Los Angeles,\" the insider continued.\n\nIn other news, the Church Of Scientology has been forced to deny that it has had Katie Holmes under surveillance.\n\nThe Church had been accused of ordering several vehicles to tail Katie Holmes and position surveillance cameras on her. However, the organisation has since claimed that these reports are completely false.\n\n\"Gary Soter, lawyer for the Church, tells TMZ ... the Church of Scientology is not following Katie or conducting surveillance on her in the wake of her divorce with Tom Cruise,\" the celebrity gossip site posted.\n\nKatie Holmes confirmed that she was divorcing her husband of five years, Tom Cruise, on Friday.\n\nSOURCE: TMZ, RADAR ONLINE\n\nOn 29 June 2012, we wrote...\n\nTom Cruise and Katie Holmes are to divorce after five years together, the actress' lawyer has confirmed. Katie's lawyer Jonathan Wolfe confirmed the split, saying: \"This is a personal and private matter.\n\n\" Katie has filed for divorce and Tom is deeply saddened and is concentrating on his three children. Please allow them their privacy,\" his spokesman said.\n\nThe couple married in Italy in 2008 and have a six-year-old daughter, Suri, together.\n\nDuring their romance, the pair regularly made very public displays of affection with each other, including Tom Cruise famously jumping on Oprah Winfrey's couch. \"I can't be cool. I can't be laid-back. Something happened and I want to celebrate it,\" Tom said at the time.\n\nSources haven't confirmed whether divorce papers have been filed in court at this time.\n\nSOURCE: BBC"
