        "text": "LAT tk (Gareth)\n\nNYT 16:59 (Nate)\n\nUSA Today tk (Darby)\n\nUniversal (Sunday) 10:56 (Jim)\n\nUniversal tk (norah)\n\nWaPo 8:03 (Matt G)\n\nDavid Karp’s New York Times crossword, “Double Digits” — Nate’s write-up\n\n– 22A: EATT HHUUMMBBLE PIE [Admit one was wrong] (THUMB is fatter)\n\n– 35A: BLIINNDD EEXXPERIMENTS [Research trials using withheld information] (INDEX is fatter)\n\n– 48A: KATE MMIIDDLLEETON [Royal whose wedding had a whopping 1,900 guests] (MIDDLE is fatter)\n\n– 76A: SPARRRIINNGG PARTNER [Friendly debate opponent] (RING is fatter)\n\n– 92A: PPIINNKKYY AND THE BRAIN [Lab mice of 1990s cartoons] (PINKY is fatter)\n\n– 107A: FAT FINGER SYNDROME [Excuse for texting errors, jocularly … or a hint to this puzzle’s theme]\n\nI am hopeful this puzzle is one that folks enjoy, but I’m sad to say that it wasn’t my favorite:\n\n– The placement of theme entries and revealer in the grid necessitated so. much. short. fill. and. crosswordese. This made the solve less fun for me.\n\n– The theme entries aren’t utilized consistently. Usually in a “word hidden in a phrase” theme like this, editors want to see the hidden word span multiple words in the phrase, as we see in EA(T HUMB)LE PIE and BL(IND EX)PERIMENTS. Yet, those are the only two theme entries that do this; the next two “hide” the finger in half of a stand-alone word and the last one simply has PINKY as a full stand-alone word itself. It was a bit disappointing to see this degree of theme inconsistency in an outlet that I know rejects solid puzzles for much less.\n\n– SPARRING PARTNER was an inelegant theme entry in that there is a non-repeated R before the set of repeated Rs in RING. That triple R threw me until I stepped back and figured out what was going on.\n\n– The BLIND EXPERIMENTS theme entry was a particular trap for me, since the idea of a double blind experiment could easily confuse a solver who sees letters doubling in the theme entry but hasn’t figured out the puzzle’s revealer / trick. I’ll admit that this was a rabbit hole I fell down. I wonder if anyone else saw BLIND EXPERIMENTS and a doubling of letters and assumed that was the theme mechanism somehow?\n\n– FAT FINGER SYNDROME (or a fat-finger error) usually results in typing a wrong letter or typing multiple, close letters at once, since the finger is so “fat” as to not just land on one narrow letter on a digital keyboard. That’s not what’s going on here, so I think it’s just that each finger letter is taking up two squares to show, literally, “fat fingers”?\n\n– There are quite a number of ways to clue KATE MIDDLETON, so it was a bit disappointing to see her reduced, essentially, to her role as a bride/wife.\n\nWhat did you think of the puzzle? I hope you enjoyed it in part or full – and I hope you have a great weekend!\n\nEvan Birnholz’s Washington Post crossword, “The Three-Body Problem” — Matt’s write-up\n\nBit of a funky one from Evan this week. I was a good chunk slower than normal. I found the fill on the tougher end of Evan’s spectrum, but I also think the asymmetry prevents a certain amount of flow. I think it’s worth it – a neat theme with a fitting title.\n\nFive across entries have circled letters that spell body parts, but in the crossing down entries, each letter needs to be used three times to make it work:\n\n33a [Send again] RESHIP, crossing HH HOLMES, PART III, and APP PLAYER\n\n46a [“Bright” partner] EARLY, crossing BEE EATER, AAA BOND, and RIOT GRRRL\n\n54a [Chicken ___ (Italian entree, briefly)] PARM, crossing CLASS AAA, THEY’RE GRRREAT, and MMMBOP\n\n94a [One of 12 biblical groups of ancient Israel] TRIBE, crossing STARR REPORT, WII-ITIS, and BBB RATING\n\n111a [Has an extra level, as an amp that Nigel shows off in “This Is Spinal Tap”] GOES TO ELEVEN, crossing SCOTT TUROW, TOO OLD, SLIME EEL\n\n121a [Vital thing in the body, an example of which is spelled out by the first letters of this puzzle’s tripled words] ORGAN. The spelt-out ORGAN is HEART.\n\nI found the title more compelling than the revealer, but between the two it was clear what’s going on. Typically when there’s a triple-letter theme like this, the old CLASS AAA team HAWAII ISLANDERS makes an appearance, but the gridding was a bit too constrained here, I imagine. I appreciated a number of the triple-letter entries that we don’t usually see – STARR REPORT, WII ITIS, THEY’RE GREAT, RIOT GRRRL. I also love, love, LOVE that GOES TO ELEVEN is at clue number… 111.\n\nNotes:\n\n38a [Total of reds and whites, perhaps] TAB. As in a bar TAB. There’s lots of fun clues for bar tabs, and this one felt new to me.\n\n50a [Former venue for the WNBA’s New York Liberty] MSG. They now play at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Go see a game if you’re in the area!\n\n53a [Bread spread, briefly] MAYO. Hands up for OLEO, here. That took a moment to fix.\n\n57a [These usually aren’t considered stories] BASEMENTS. I loved this\n\n117a [Conductor Rodzinski] ARTUR. This is a new orchestra-person entry to me. I’m surprised that in all the ARTURs I’ve seen in grids, it’s never been this fellow before.\n\n5d [End of a trilogy, and a phrase that hints at each circled word when entering it in the Down direction] PART III. Additional theme pointer here.\n\n82d [Red ___ (gemstone)] SPINEL. I’d seen this before, but still a bit of a crossword rarity, despite the friendly letters. Seems to have once been part of what folks called “rubies,” until eventually spinels and corundums were differentiated.\n\n100d [First word of TMNT] TEENAGE. That’s the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I never saw any of the show, but I enjoy the meme format that plays on phrases that scan the same as the show title.\n\nHalle Amore Bauer’s Universal Sunday crossword, “Crossing the Line”—Jim’s review\n\nToday’s puzzle is a very nice debut by a constructor whose three names would each make a fine addition to the crossword lexicon.\n\nTheme answers are familiar phrases punnily applied to marathoners.\n\n22a. [*With 34-Across, how marathoners describe their association with each other?] LONG-DISTANCE / RELATIONSHIP.\n\n49a. [*Pacing coach’s advice to marathoners?] “HAVE A GREAT TIME!”\n\n69a. [*Where marathoners learn how to go the extra mile?] EXTENSION COURSE.\n\n90a. [*High-five at the end of a marathon?] FINISHING TOUCH.\n\n105a. [*Physical therapy appointment for post-race marathoners?] JOINT SESSION.\n\n121a. [*Recurring gags … and a punny description of this puzzle’s theme] RUNNING JOKES.\n\nI enjoyed these, especially when I got to the last one to cap things off. The only one that felt iffy to me was EXTENSION COURSE as that’s not a phrase I’m familiar with (but it gets plenty of hits on Google). Good humor and good wordplay throughout. Nicely done!\n\nPlenty to like in the fill, too: LATTE ART, TRADE WAR, OPEN SEAS, ARIADNE, PEEL OUT, ROTH IRAS, LEANED ON, WEARS A WIG, METRONOME. I came to a stop at S_YDOG, though [Vegan frankfurter]. I couldn’t get Peppermint Patty’s “you sly dog” out of my head, and I didn’t know the name at that crossing (OLUO [Ijeoma who wrote “Be a Revolution”]). Eventually I figured it out (duh!), but I liked the thought of something called a “sly dog” enjoyed by vegans.\n\nClue of note: 29d. [The only mammal that truly flies]. BAT. Others, like flying squirrels, only glide.\n\nGood puzzle. 3.75 stars."
