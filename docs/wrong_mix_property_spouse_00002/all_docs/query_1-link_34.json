        "text": "Suri Cruise has paid tribute to her mother Katie Holmes by changing her surname during her recent high school graduation ceremony.\n\nLast weekend, the 18-year-old graduated from high school and instead of being referred to by her birth name Suri Cruise, which a surname she inherited from her father actor Tom Cruise, she instead chose to go by Suri Noelle.\n\nFIND OUT MORE ON ELLE COLLECTIVE\n\nThe choice of Noelle is important given it’s her mother’s middle name. The teenager follows in the footsteps of Katy Perry, whose stage name is inspired by her mother’s maiden name (she was born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson) and Reese Witherspoon, who chose the moniker in honour of her mother, whose maiden name is Reese (the actor’s birth name is Laura Jeanne Reese Witherspoon).\n\nFor the ceremony, E! News reports the 45-year-old actor wore a monochromatic beige look for the occasion, which featured matching trousers and a collared jumper, accessorised with silver heel and brown sunglasses.\n\nMeanwhile, the graduate wore a white, mid-length dress under her cap and gown.\n\nCruise wasn’t present at the graduation, rather was seen in attendance at Taylor Swift’s concert at Wembley Stadium with the singer’s partner Travis Kelce.\n\nHolmes and Cruise divorced in 2012. Speaking to Glamour about parenthood in 2023, she revealed of being a mother: ‘I'm very grateful to be a parent, to be her parent. She’s an incredible person.’\n\nIn an interview with ELLE UK in 2019, the former cover star said of becoming a parent aged 27: ‘‘I was happy to become a mum in my twenties,’ is all that she will say. ‘It’s been nice that our ages fit… how do I put this? Every age that my child has been and my age at that time has been a good match. We kind of grew up together.’"
