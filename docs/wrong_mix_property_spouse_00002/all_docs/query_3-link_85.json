        "text": "You are above average in intelligence. And for a policeman, I would say, top tier.\n\nThomas \"Tommy\" Gregson is the captain of the NYPD's Major Cases unit at the 11th Precinct and has been a police officer for over thirty years. He was the youngest detective in the history of the 14th Squad and took over Major Cases at age 40.[1] While observing the counter-terrorism bureau at Scotland Yard, he met Holmes and, years later, allowed him to work with the Major Cases unit as a consulting detective.[2] He was married to Cheryl Gregson and has several daughters.[3] One is Hannah, who is a police officer at the 15th Precinct and aspires to become a captain.[4] He is portrayed by actor Aidan Quinn.\n\nBiography[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nI've lost friends on the job to scumbags. Believe me, there's been more than a few times I thought about taking things into my own hands. But I didn't.\n\n— Gregson, \"M.\"\n\nGregson invites Holmes to review a crime scene where they work the case of the murder of a doctor's wife and, he meets Joan Watson. He introduces Holmes and Watson to Detective Bell at a crime scene and later unsuccessfully invites Holmes out for drinks. After Holmes disappears, Watson is forced to reveal Holmes is an addict to Gregson who later tells Holmes that he already knew about his condition. After the guilt of a serial murderer Gregson convicted is questioned, Holmes proves the convict is complicit in recent killings. Gregson is outraged when Holmes captures a serial killer, Sebastian Moran and intends to torture and kill him. He doesn't allow Holmes to work with the NYPD until Holmes is his only option in resolving a hostage situation. After the situation is resolved, Gregson meets Holmes in a bar, re-instates him and punches him in the stomach. After Holmes captures serial killer Howard Ennis alone, Gregson is pleased that Holmes doesn't repeat the mistakes he made with Moran. When Bell is a suspect in a series of murders, Gregson protects and supports Bell. When a snowstorm hits NYC, Gregson commands the relief response with FEMA and helps capture thieves who robbed a federal cash reserve. Further gaining Gregson's trust, Holmes shows him evidence of the murder of a blackmailer that he asks to be kept secret while he investigates. Gregson is drawn into Holmes and Watson's battle with Jamie Moriarty and her agents Isaac Proctor and Daniel Gottlieb.\n\nAppearances in Season 1 \"Pilot\": At the first crime scene Holmes brings Watson to, Holmes half-jokingly introduces Watson as his personal valet to NYPD Captain Gregson and insists that Watson accompany him inside. Watson is up for the challenge and agrees. Gregson relates that Dr. Richard Mantlo, a psychiatrist at Sanbridge Hospital, returned home late from work the previous evening and called 911 after finding his wife, Amy Dampier, missing, and signs of a struggle in the apartment. Watson and Gregson watch Holmes inspect a room and she learns that Gregson knew Holmes from time he spent in London after 9/11. Gregson watches as Holmes finds Dampier's body in a hidden safe room. With Gregson's permission, Holmes obtains a list of tall men Mantlo knows. Having found a suspect, Holmes calls Captain Gregson and is surprised to hear that they are already at Saldua's and that he's been murdered. Joining Gregson, Holmes and Watson learn that Saldua has photos and a possession of Dampier's. Holmes meets Gregson at a bar, to examine the patient file on Saldua from his deceased psychiatrist. Later in Gregson's office, he watches as Holmes produces Saldua's phone with recordings that show that Mantlo is guilty of arranging his wife's murder. \"While You Were Sleeping\": Gregson calls Holmes, requesting he attend a murder scene. On the top floor of an apartment building, Gregson shows Holmes the victim, Casey McManus, dead from a single gunshot to the forehead and his apartment robbed. Holmes believes the murder and robbery were done by two different people and finds the robber, a neighbor. In the box at the 11th Precinct, the neighbor admits to the thefts, but not the murder. Detective Bell is disbelieving, but Holmes forcefully provides evidence the neighbor is being truthful, annoying Gregson. Watson tactfully asks Holmes to get her a bag of chips and once out of the room, Watson asks Gregson about his past acquaintance with Holmes in London. Gregson praises Holmes' abilities but not his behaviour and Watson discovers Holmes lied to Gregson about where he was when he called to ask to work with him in NYC. Holmes believes Gregson wouldn't let a recovering addict work on sensitive cases and threatens to sue Watson if she tells Gregson. Gregson beacons them to a murder scene with the same M.O. as the first. Gregson arranges a meeting with a former police officer who was surveilling the latest victim. Gregson leads a team who questions Rebecca Ellison about the murder victims, who are her half-siblings. After Holmes sets a trap for Rebecca's sister Yvette, Gregson leads the police team that catches Yvette about to commit a murder and she is arrested for the two murders. As Holmes and Watson are heading out, Gregson and Bell meet them, and Gregson invites them out for drinks. Holmes is surprised by the offer, but declines politely. \"Child Predator\": Holmes and Watson meet Gregson at the home of the Castillos whose daughter Mariana has been abducted. Gregson objects when Holmes stops a TV news crew from broadcasting an interview with the Castillos. Gregson is part of the chase of a van believing to be driven by the abductor. When it's discovered the van is being driven by the abductor's first victim, Adam Kemper, Gregson allows Holmes to question Kemper at the precinct. Gregson ends the questioning when Adam's parents show up and later informs Holmes that an immunity deal is being working out for Adam in exchange for testimony on his abductor. After abductor is discovered to be Samuel Abbott, Gregson leads an ESU team that raid an address where a video of Abbott demanding Adam's return in exchange for Mariana is found. When Gregson won't make the exchange, the Castillos threaten him. Gregson asks Holmes to speak to Adam again to see if he can get him to sign the immunity deal in order to get information to find Abbott. \"The Rat Race\": After Holmes finds the body of a missing investment banker, Peter Talbott, with Gregson and Detective Bell on the scene, Holmes insists it's a murder as evidenced by the state of Talbott's apartment, his job and the lack of needle marks. He deduces that a salad Talbott ate was dosed with heroin and then he was given the fatal shot. Gregson is doubtful but has the salad tested. Later, Holmes is kidnapped by Donna Kaplan, Talbott's killer. When Watson cannot get a hold of Holmes, she asks Gregson for help. After reassurances from Gregson and attempts to explain why not hearing from Holmes is unusual, she admits that she is his sober companion, he's never supposed to be out of contact and she believes he may have relapsed. After Holmes is rescued with Watson and Gregson's help, a humbled Holmes speaks with Gregson in his office. He explains that he withheld the truth about his addiction due to embarrassment as Gregson has always thought highly of him. Holmes apologizes and is then surprised to find out Gregson already knew. He wasn't happy Holmes didn't tell him and affirms the quality of Holmes' work and since others may not understand, Holmes' addiction will stay between them. \"Lesser Evils\": After Holmes locks himself and Watson in a hospital room, believing that a man who died there was murdered, Gregson resolves the incident with the hospital administrator. After Holmes discovers a doctor, Cahill, at the hospital was stealing morphine, he and Gregson question Cahill in \"the box\" at the precinct. Holmes finds a killer of terminally ill patients, Danilo Gura, a janitor at the hospital. He and Gregson question Gura in the box who admits to all the killings but one. \"Flight Risk\": When Holmes hears reports of a plane crash on his police scanner, he arrives at the scene to Gregson's surprise. Gregson asks Holmes to go home until Holmes discovers that the plane crash was caused by the discovery of a dead body on board the plane. After the owner of the plane's charter company, Charles Cooper, accuses one of his pilots, Owen Barts, of the murder, Gregson leads a team to Barts' house where they discover evidence of the murders which appears to have been planted. Gregson, Holmes and Bell interrogate Cooper in the box and confronting him with evidence that he's the murderer, Gregson gives him the choice of confessing and accepting life imprisonment or risking the death penalty. \"One Way to Get Off\": Holmes meets Captain Gregson at the murder scene of a husband and wife, the Myroses. Immediately, Holmes see the crime has the same M.O. as home invasion murders perpetrated by Wade Crewes in 1999 whom Gregson brought to justice. Gregson believes the latest murders were done by a copycat but after Holmes finds that a woman's shoe is also missing, he believes that Crewes lied in 1999 when he said he worked alone and his accomplice is killing again. At the precinct, Gregson briefs a newly-formed task force to deal with the murder of the Myroses. Holmes proposes that he and Gregson interview Wade Crewes at Sing Sing, but Gregson doesn't see the value. Gregson, Bell and Holmes question a contractor who worked at the Myroses and free a sex slave he had imprisoned. At the precinct, Gregson meets his partner from 1999, Terry D'Amico who Holmes has called to provide insights. Bell briefs the task force on the findings to date including that Crewes maybe working with an accomplice. When Holmes suggests Crewes may be innocent, D'Amico refutes this and Gregson angrily dismisses everyone. He decides to question Crewes and allows Holmes to come along. At Sing Sing, Crewes isn't surprised to see Gregson. He denies any connection to the latest murders, practices anger management when Gregson asks who his accomplice is and quotes Tolstoy. He also claims he's innocent of the 1999 murders, that Gregson planted evidence to further his career and his attorney wouldn't pursue his alibi, that he was with Carla Figueroa, a woman he was having an affair with. He convinced he'll be exonerated. Holmes and Gregson drive to Carla Figuero's home to question her but meet her son, Sean, who says she died years before. Holmes asks Gregson why he's so resistant to the possibility Crewes is innocent. Gregson tells Holmes to watch the interrogation tapes in which Crewes gloats. Holmes watches the tapes at the Brownstone, and notices that a coffee mug, found smashed at one of the 1999 crime scenes with Crewes' prints on it, was originally handed to Crewes during his interrogation by Gregson. On a street, Gregson secretly meets with Terry D'Amico and says that he realized she planted the mug. She says she always thought Gregson knew but he thought it was good fortune as they were both convinced Crewes was guilty. The recent killings have put doubt of Crewes' guilt in Gregson's mind but D'Amico points out that if Gregson tells, she could go to prison and his career will be over which Gregson indicates won't dissuade him from owning up. Gregson is at another murder scene that matches the Crewes M.O. and Gregson says he won't hide the Crewes frame-up but incredibly, Holmes shushes him. After Holmes finds Crewes' accomplice, at Sing Sing, a confident Crewes meets Holmes and Gregson. Gregson shows him the women's shoes and the murder weapon, provided by Sean, who confessed to the recent murders and being Crewes' accomplice. To Gregson's satisfaction, he tells Crewes he's getting additional charges. Crewes explodes and is dragged out by the guards. \"The Long Fuse\": Holmes and Watson meet Gregson and Bell at the scene of an explosion at a web design firm where Holmes quickly finds the remains of a pager, an antiquated device which he believes was the bomb's trigger. Holmes interrupts Gregson with the bomb squad and looking at the evidence, he points out the bomb's battery is four years old as is the newspaper used to pack the bomb evidenced by an old photo of Obama and a date Watson finds. Holmes shows Gregson that he's found the impression of the word \"Novocaine\" on one of the scraps of newspaper used in the bomb. Even though it's not a suspect, Knowles', handwriting, Gregson believes he's the bomber. Since the threat against Vanowen SC wasn't made public, Holmes believes an employee may be the bomber. Gregson refuses to get him a subpoena so Holmes will need to get the employee records on his own. After Holmes finds the body of a missing Vanowen SC employee, Pradeep Singh, his wife Himali is interviewed where Gregson confirms that she was in India when Pradeep disappeared. Holmes believes that Pradeep was the target of the bomb as he discovered his office was near the air vent. After evidence is found linking Heather Vanowen to Pradeep's murder and the bomb, she's confronted with the evidence in Gregson's office and arrested. \"You Do It to Yourself\": After a college professor, Trent Annuzio, is murdered by being shot in the eyes, Holmes shows Gregson and Bell microscopic photos of cancer cells found in the remnants of Trent Annunzio's eye sockets. The cancer was terminal and very painful. Holmes believes Annunzio planned his own death. Gregson admits Holmes' theory makes sense but it isn't enough to release Annunzio's T.A., Brendan O'Brien, who confessed to the murder and that Annunzio's wife Jun is being deported. After Holmes finds that Annuzio paid a man to murder him to get revenge on O'Brien, he's shown into Gregson's office and Gregson informs O'Brien and Jun that if they get married immediately, the deportation processing will stop. They agree and hug enthusiastically while Holmes praises O'Brien. \"The Leviathan\": After Holmes recovers various valuable stolen artworks, he and Watson return all, except Van Gogh's \"Pieta\". At the scene of a murdered safe cracker, Holmes finds a stolen diamond in a glass vase filled with multicolored decorative rocks. Gregson orders a full scale canvassing of the area. Gregson and Holmes compel Jermey Lopez to provide a blood sample which matches DNA at the scene of the murdered safe cracker. \"Dirty Laundry\": Gregson attends the crime scene of hotel manager Teri Purcell who was found in a washing machine, dead of a blow to the head. In a New York suburb, Gregson and Holmes question Teri's husband, Oliver, and her teenage daughter, Carly, who both don't know who would want to hurt her. After Watson and Holmes find that Teri was facilitating prostitutes at her hotel, Gregson confirms this from Vice and that Teri and arranged meeting with diplomats and rich clients. After Holmes discovers a private network comprised of feeds from a series of hidden cameras installed in the hotel's rooms linked to Teri's office, Holmes theorizes to Gregson that Teri was blackmailing guests. Gregson laments that it'll take a huge amount of resources to review all the tapes to find a suspect but Holmes doesn't agree. After Holmes deduces that Teri and Oliver are Russian spies, Gregson, Bell and Holmes arrest him. Gregson listens to Oliver's confession in \"the box\" with an FBI agent where Oliver reveals his handler is Geoffrey Silver. In Gregson's office, Oliver and Teri's daughter, Carly, believes she killed her mother accidentally after Teri revealed to Carly she and Oliver were Russian spies and insisted that Carly become one too. She mentions Silver came upon them and told her to leave Teri for him to take care of. Gregson witnesses as Holmes provides proof how Teri wasn't dead after Carly left and how Silver finished her off. \"M.\": Gregson calls Holmes to a murder scene with a large pool of blood but the body is missing. Holmes describes how the man was killed and that he knows this as he unsuccessfully investigated a series of murders with the same MO in London. After Holmes briefs Gregson's team on the serial killer \"M\", Gregson asks Holmes if he thinks it a coincidence that M has shown up in NYC since Holmes started living there. Holmes isn't concerned but Gregson assigns police to protect him and Watson. After Holmes finds a letter from M in the Brownstone, Gregson examines it and offers re-location which Holmes and Watson refuse. When Watson learns that Holmes can find M, who he intends to kill as he believes M killed his love Irene, Watson informs an irate Gregson. Holmes captures M while he's trying to kidnap Melanie Cullen and later in the hospital, Gregson and Watson question her. When she mentions she saw chalk dust on Holmes' shoes, Watson tells Gregson where Holmes has brought M. Gregson finds the location empty but is called by Bell who says Holmes brought Sebastian Moran (M) into the precinct. Moran stubbornly lies that Holmes did not abduct him. He lured Holmes to Cullen's who then followed him to the loft, where Moran attacked him. Holmes stabbed Moran in self-defense though by some miracle, he missed every major organ. \"The Red Team\": In the wake of Holmes' kidnapping of Moran, Gregson refuses to let Holmes work with the NYPD. Watson tries unsuccessfully to change Gregson's mind but Gregson doesn't believe Holmes is repentant. When Holmes discovers a former team of experts, the Red Team, who helped the Army are being killed, a suspect is brought to the precinct and when Holmes arrives, he's ejected by Gregson. After Holmes' own investigation turns up solid evidence of murders, Gregson calls him to the precinct to help interview the remaining team members. After officers visit one of the team members to take into protective custody and are shot by a booby trap gun, Gregson and Bell attend the scene and believe the member, Walter McClenahan, is the prime suspect. When the rest of the members are taken into protective custody in a motel, one of the members, Harold Dresden, takes an officer hostage and threatens to kill him unless the other team members are brought to him. Holmes asks Gregson if he can see Dresden and claims he can end the hostage situation. Holmes does and Gregson asks him to meet him later at a bar. At the bar, Holmes apologizes for lying to Gregson but haughtily says the NYPD needs him. Gregson rebukes Holmes' self-centered behaviour but admits he is special and needs him. He'll never trust Holmes again, gives him a gut shot and as Holmes gasps for air, welcomes him back. \"The Deductionist\": After a serial killer, Howard Ennis, is transported to a hospital to donate one of his kidney's to his sister Patricia, he manages to kill the medical staff and escape. At the crime scene, Gregson indicates that Ennis wrote \"SHEDIR\" in blood before leaving. Gregson and Holmes question Patricia in her hospital room. Dying of kidney failure, she says she's had no contact with Howard since he was sent to prison, and doesn't know where he might be. Holmes confronts Kathryn Drummond, an FBI agent on the case, while she's talking to Gregson on the Shedir clue and is surprised to find that Drummond agrees it's a misdirect. After Howard kills a number of people at a bodega, Gregson challenges an embarrassed Drummond whose predictions of Howard's actions have been completely wrong. The next morning in Gregson's office, Ennis calls. He blames Drummond for his father's suicide and tells Gregson he'll stop killing if he's given Drummond. \"A Giant Gun, Filled with Drugs\": Holmes and Watson help Holmes' former drug dealer Rhys Kinlan find the kidnapper of his daughter Emily. Discovered to be DEA Agent Diaz, Diaz attacks Kinlan and Watson but is subdued. At the precinct, Diaz is interrogated about Emily but he claims to know nothing about her. He claims he followed Rhys to the Brownstone to question him and assumed Watson was working with him. Captain Gregson says Watson and Rhys have a different story, but Diaz thinks that a judge will believe him over a drug dealer. Gregson says the DA is offering protective custody while he is in prison if he confesses and gives Emily's location. Diaz appears unconcerned and Gregson guesses that he is betting that Emily will die before being found. However, Holmes' pre-war buildings near an Ethiopian restaurant deduction search has been narrowed to those near Diaz's apartment which police teams are searching. Bell and Gregson get up to leave but Diaz stops them. \"Details\": After Bell is shot at in his car, in the 11th Precinct garage, Gregson, Holmes and Watson examine the wreckage of the car, while a bruised Marcus looks on. Gregson and Holmes both recognize an MP5 was the weapon used and the shooter had poor aim. Marcus knows who the culprit is. In Gregson's office, Marcus shows them the file on Curtis Bradshaw, a former drug kingpin. Arrested by Bell and while in jail, Marcus arrested most of his lieutenants and when Bradshaw was released, his organization was gone. Marcus recognized Bradshaw's prize car as the one used to shoot at him. Gregson, Holmes and Watson confront Curtis Bradshaw at a pickup basketball game. Bradshaw denies being the shooter, claims his car was stolen and two cronies give alibis. When Bradshaw is found murdered, Gregson says the media believes a cop killed Bradshaw as retaliation for the attack on Marcus. After Holmes finds evidence Bell is being framed for Bradshaw's killing, Gregson takes Bell off field duty to protect him. Holmes finds the pistol used to kill Bradshaw in Bell's apartment and lies to Gregson that he found it in a dumpster. After Holmes finds the murderer who is framing Bell is Officer Paula Reyes, she called into the conference room. Gregson explains that they have been looking for a killer who is a cop, a former member of the Bradshaw detail, and had a key to Marcus' apartment. Only she fits and Gregson also notes that I.A. suspected her of helping steal the heroin planted on Bradshaw and that she's dating an I.A. member. Gregson then tells her that the guns used at the various scenes all match those owned by a gun dealer Reyes arrested. The guns went missing but her home is being searched for them which results in her admitting to the crimes. \"Possibility Two\": After millionaire Gerald Lydon unsuccessfully tries to hire Holmes to prove that he was poisoned with a genetic disease, Gregson calls that Lydon has been arrested for shooting his butler Crabtree and is refusing to talk to anyone but Holmes. At the crime scene, Gregson tells Holmes that Lydon can't remember shooting and Holmes takes Lydon's case. Gregson attends the murder scene of geneticist Natasha Kademan who was killed after telling Holmes that it was possible to poison Lydon with a genetic disease. A suspect in Kademan's murder, Benny Cordero, is questioned by Bell and Gregson but Holmes constantly interrupts their questioning, insisting Cordero isn't the killer. After Cordero's DNA matches the blood at Kademan's murder scene, he provides an alibi to Bell and Gregson. Gregson is part of the interrogation of Kademan's geneticist fiance who admits to killing her and planting Cordero's DNA, which he made, at the scene. After Holmes deduces that the head of the genetic company Kademan worked for, Brian Watt, has the genetic disease and was poisoning rich people with it so they would contribute to finding a cure, he brought to the precinct. Gregson indicates detectives are on the way to his home to search for the poison. \"Déjà Vu All Over Again\": Holmes investigates a case involving a subway pusher and at the precinct, Holmes shows Gregson footage from the subway camera taken days before Vivian Tully was killed. Holmes noticed a man was following her who can be identified, Anson Samuels. He's questioned in \"the box\" and claims ignorance but once Holmes confronts him with the video and that he worked in Tully's building, he admits his obsession with her.
