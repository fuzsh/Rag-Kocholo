        "text": "Katie Holmes just proved that the apple really doesn’t fall far from the tree when it comes to her daughter. The 41-year-old actress recently shared an adorable photo of herself as a little girl and she seriously looks identical to Suri at that age.\n\nOver the weekend, Holmes posted a throwback pic of herself and her mom, Kathleen, in honor of Mother’s Day. In the sweet snap, we see the Dawson's Creek actress assisting her mother in the garden. Young Holmes dons a pair of yellow shorts and a white blouse and her hair styled in pigtails with colorful clips.\n\n“Thank you mom for teaching me so many things and for loving me,” she captioned the photo on Instagram. “Happy Mother’s Day to all of the moms out there!!!!!!!”\n\nOf course, it wasn’t long before friends and fans alike used the comments section to point out the obvious resemblance between the actress and her daughter (whom she shares with Tom Cruise). One fan wrote, \"Wow, Suri is your mini,\" while another added, \"Suri is your twin, beautiful like her mommy.”\n\nAnd after taking a peak at some old photos of Suri, the resemblance is really hard to ignore. Need more proof? See below."
