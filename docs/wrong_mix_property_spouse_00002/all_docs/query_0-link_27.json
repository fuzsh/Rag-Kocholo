        "text": "Hey, Tom Cruise, can you take a hint?\n\nActress Katie Holmes appears more than ready to walk down the aisle right now, donning a Commes des Garcons wedding dress in the August issue of W magazine.\n\nAnd this picture is nothing compared to the accompanying interview, in which she declares that her fiancé is simply “the man of my dreams.”\n\n“He’s the most incredible man,” she says. “He’s so generous and kind, and he helps so many people, and, um, he makes me laugh like I’ve never laughed and he’s a great friend.”\n\nThroughout the interview, Holmes, 26 (with Cruise above), offered “Dear Diary”-type observations that are by turns endearing and terrifying.\n\nFor example, when asked if her love affair with the twicemarried actor will endure, Holmes gushes, naively, “Tom and I will always be in our honeymoon phase.”\n\n“From the moment I met him, it just felt like I’d known him forever,” she adds.\n\nHolmes denies that she’s converted to Scientology – or that Cruise had pressured her to do so. Then again, her Scientology “handler,” Jessica Rodriguez, was in the room with the W reporter.\n\n“You adore him,” Rodriguez told Holmes when the actress was at a loss for words to describe her love."
