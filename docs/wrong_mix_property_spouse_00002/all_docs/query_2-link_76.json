        "text": "To kick off OATOBER, Quaker will feature a recipe each day on its social channels and on www.quakeroatober.com, showcasing a range of hearty breakfast favorites like apple cinnamon overnight oats to snacks like energy balls, and savory dishes that incorporate oats as an ingredient, such as meatloaf and veggie burgers. Kicking off the month will be a consistent consumer favorite: Quaker Oatmeal Cookies. In total, Quaker will create more than 60 pieces of content for OATOBER across Pinterest, Facebook, Instagram and Tumblr to demonstrate why oats should be an essential in everyone's diet.\n\nMoreover, on October 3, Quaker's Chief Creative Oatmeal Officer, Samantha (Sam) Stephens, will usher in OATOBER with the help of oatmeal fan and award winning actress, Katie Holmes. The two will discuss favorite oatmeal recipes and Stephens will create an 'Oatober Bowl' to add to the menu at OatMeals – her New York City oatmeal bar, which features 30 other oatmeal-based dishes spanning everything from Pomegranate Pistachio to Truffle RisOATto.\n\n\"Oatmeal is one of my favorite breakfast choices because it's delicious and packed with nutrition,\" said Holmes. \"For me, and I think for most families in America, Quaker is oatmeal.\"\n\nOats are a heart healthy, versatile grain that provides a great healthy start to the day. They are uniquely higher than most other grains in the soluble fiber beta-glucan, which has many health benefits including helping reduce the risk of heart disease. In fact, oats were the subject of the first food-specific health claim approved by the FDA for heart health.\n\n\"With the start of oatmeal season, there's no better time for us to remind people about the unlimited potential of one of the world's most nutritious foods, especially as people look for more ways to add more whole grains to their diets,\" said Becky Frankiewicz, senior vice president and general manager of Quaker Foods North America. \"As the original oatmeal innovator, with 140 years of oat expertise, it's our job and our passion to help people enjoy oats more ways and more often.\"\n\nQuaker's OATOBER campaign will be supported by print, digital and native advertising throughout the month. Video, imagery and print content will also be featured across multiple digital and mobile channels and platforms such as Facebook, Tumblr, Pinterest and Instagram. Quaker will also be tapping influential lifestyle and culinary bloggers to bring the OATOBER message to millions over the course of 31 days.\n\nFor OATOBER recipe ideas and more information about the nutritional benefits of oats, please visit QuakerOatober.com.
