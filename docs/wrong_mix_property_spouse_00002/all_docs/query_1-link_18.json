        "text": "Suri Cruise has been spotted out with her mum for the first time since it was revealed she's ditched her dad's name after years of no contact.\n\nThe daughter of Hollywood stars Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes was seen spending some time with her mum in New York as they headed out for dinner at a swanky restaurant. The pair wore matching denim outfits, with Suri opting for jeans and a chic denim jacket.\n\nThe 18-year-old also wore a white crop top and styled her hair into a messy up-do. Batman Begins star Katie looked super stylish as she wrapped up in a beige knitted jumper and matching trench coat. Their outing comes after it was reported Suri has dropped her Hollywood star dad's world-famous last name and is instead going by a moniker that pays tribute to her mum.\n\nREAD MORE: Ben Affleck seen leaving LA home he's been staying at amid Jennifer Lopez split rumours\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\nAccording to Hello! Magazine, Suri's new title is simply Suri Noelle and was spotted in the playbill of her school production of The Go-Go's jukebox musical, Head Over Heels. The new name would see Suri taking on the middle name of her mum, 45, while completely blanking any link to Tom, 61.\n\nTom is said to have felt guilty after missing his daughter's 18th birthday recently while he was busy filming in London. A source told Heat shortly after her celebration: \"Tom is feeling guilty about missing so much of her life, but insists that he hasn’t completely shut Suri out of his life, and does get updates from time to time.\"\n\nThey added Tom had made the deal to \"allow her and her mother to live their own lives because that was what Katie wanted\". Tom's estrangement from his daughter comes after Katie was awarded \"sole custody\" of Suri in their divorce settlement.\n\nKatie filed for divorce from Tom in June 2012 and asked for legal custody, primary residential custody and a \"suitable amount\" of child support from her husband as part of the settlement. The actress also asked for a division of property in the divorce documents. On July 9 2012, Katie's lawyer confirmed her divorce with Tom had been settled.\n\nTom agreed as part of their settlement to pay $400,000 per year in child support. The agreement lasted until Suri turned 18 last month. Tom also agreed to pay all of Suri's expenses, including medical, dental, insurance, education, college and other extracurricular costs."
