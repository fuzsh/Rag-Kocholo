        "text": "Morgane Sézalory doesn’t mean to keep customers waiting. She is the founder of the contemporary brand Sézane, a purveyor of French girl style with seasonal drops that routinely sell out. The waitlists for some items, like the , are said to be in the tens of thousands. Presumably fans Kate Middleton and Taylor Swift are not on those lists.\n\n“It’s not on purpose,” Sézalory says. “We want people to buy, every product, but at the end of the day, we can never expect how huge something is going to be.”\n\nThe explanation will sound familiar to anyone who has spent time in a Paris boutique coveting a garment only to rebuffed with a terse “C’est impossible,” but the 38-year-old knows that scarcity stokes desire, especially online. In fact, it may be her canny understanding of digital shopping that’s the secret behind the success of her 11-year-old company. “People know that when there is a popular piece, you have to get it, and you have to get it fast.”\n\nSézalory wasn’t an early adopter of e-commerce. She was just another blogger when e-commerce was just bubbling up in the French fashion industry. As an 18-year-old, she would scavenge yard sales and the famous flea markets of Paris and snap up vintage Courrèges, Hermès, and Saint Laurent to sell first on Facebook, then eBay, and later, in 2008, on her own site, Les Composantes. The first Tuesday of every month she would post 100 of her assorted finds from Vanves, Clignancourt, and beyond and watch them take off.\n\nThe limited supply wasn’t a strategy then. Shopify, the sales platform Sézalory used at the time to execute transactions, restricted the number of stock units listed at any given time. The drop, born out of necessity, became a calling card. Sensing an opportunity, she eventually started adding one piece that was her original design to the monthly rendezvous, market testing for what would become her own business.\n\nMorgane Sézalory\n\n“It was just the constraints of the available technology and me wanting to make life easier for myself,” she says when we meet one afternoon during Paris Fashion Week at the Sézane offices in the 7th, just around the corner from that temple of French retail, Le Bon Marché, Sézane’s only department store partner in Paris. Suffice it to say she has come a long way from selling hand-me-downs from her bedroom.\n\nSézalory formally launched Sézane in 2013 with her husband Thibault Lougnon (and another co-founder, who has since left) and rode the first wave of the direct-to-consumer boom. A decade later, she is the chief executive and creative director of an independent, B-corp certified label of women’s and men’s ready-to-wear, with 11 brick-and-mortar stores, dubbed “appartements” in the company argot, including five in Paris alone and two in the United States.\n\nAnnual sales are not publicly disclosed, which makes the exact size of the business difficult to confirm, but Sézane’s 2018 revenue was roughly $100 million, according to industry trade outlet WWD. For more proof of Sézane’s selling power, browse the site and count the “out of stock” tags.\n\nIn person Sézalory still has the sincerity of the self-taught entrepreneur, evangelizing about the value and quality of her products compared to the competition. “Once you have met Sézane, then you realize, Okay, what I used to buy is too expensive. This is the same quality, so why should I buy anywhere besides Sézane,” she tells me. Material quality and cost are without a doubt part of the Sézane hollandaise, but so is the direct relationship Sézalory has cultivated with her customers ever since her earliest days in the blogosphere. They came for the vintage and stayed for her own vintagey wares. “We checked, and a lot of those people are still with us today.”\n\nTaylor Swift wearing Sézane loafers in New York City in 2023. The shoes retail for $265.\n\nBy the time Sézalory opened her first store in Paris, in 2015, her database had grown from 10,000 at the brand’s inception to some 300,000, according to the New York Times. She suddenly had a head start in France, where designer labels were slow to embrace e-commerce, ceding a multibillion-dollar runway to mass-market retailers like Amazon and Shein. Sézane, meanwhile, operated with the customer service agility of an Amazon while filling a sweet spot between fast fashion and luxury with an expanding assortment of products, including handbags and demi-fine jewelry.\n\n“For a long time, most brands, even affordable brands, thought, Okay, the internet is not cool,” Sézalory says. “They took so many years to come online, and they lost so much time.”\n\nLike other startups, Sézalory was not moving slowly, and within a year of the launch she had set her sights on the United States, agreeing to a collaboration with Madewell that sold out. A sequel followed, and a Nolita boutique opened in 2017. The following year the investment firm General Atlantic, a backer of Zimmerman and Etsy, acquired a minority stake. The U.S. is now Sézane’s second-biggest market.\n\nSocial media has inarguably helped broaden Sézalory’s reach outside France, and she has wisely adopted her best eBay practices for Instagram, where the brand has 4.2 million followers; Sézalory herself has more than 300,000 followers. Photography was a key ingredient then, as it is now, both on on-site and off. Among Sézane’s best unpaid ambassadors are celebrities happy to be photographed wearing reasonably priced clothes so as to project a relatable persona, folks such as Middleton, Swift, and Selena Gomez. The Duchess of Cambridge, for instance, has often been seen sporting Sézane earrings, which don’t retail for more than $200.\n\nAs for her five-year plan, Sézalory says she’s not so strategic as that. When I ask her if she aspires to be the French Ralph Lauren, she modestly tells me her hope is to evolve her business organically, “to teach people that maybe they can buy less often but better quality.”"
