The matinee audience is obviously very different from the Saturday night audience. You learn about material -- you really start to understand what works and what doesn’t.\"\n\nThe Disturbing Behavior star said that \"both film and stageare so challenging, but in different ways.\n\n\"With film, yeah, you have another take, but a lot of the time you’re losing the light, so you better nail it on that take.
