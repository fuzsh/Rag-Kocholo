        "text": "Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise's daughter Suri omitted her last name from her high school graduation pamphlet during LaGuardia High School's ceremony held in New York on Friday (June 21). The 18-year-old opted to remove her last name in print (in photos obtained by Page Six), asking to be called Suri Noelle instead of Suri Cruise.\n\nThe teen celebrated the special occasion with fellow classmates and posed for a few photos with her mother following the ceremony. The stunning mother-daughter duo strutted the streets of New York City in matching, classy fits as they both prepared for the next chapter of their lives. Suri is seen smiling in multiple photographs as she rings in a new milestone with her father who is no where in sight. According to Page Six, it's not a huge shock that the new grad chose to omit her last name from the graduation pamphlet, as she and Cruise have been \"estranged for years.\"\n\nIn fact, the Top Gun: Maverick actor was enjoying a Taylor Swift Eras Tour show in London while Suri was soaking up the last moments of her high school career.\n\nCruise and Holmes tied the knot in 2006 and announced their split in 2012. Suri, born in 2006, is the only child that the exes share.\n\nThe recent graduate plans to attend Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh in the fall."
