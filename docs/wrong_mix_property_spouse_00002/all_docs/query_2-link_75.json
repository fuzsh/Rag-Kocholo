        "text": "By RadarOnline.com Staff\n\nTom who? Scientolo-what?\n\nAfter a summer full of stone-faced silence, Katie Holmes finally had reason to embrace the media Wednesday, looking quite the fashionista as she premiered her clothing line Holmes & Yang at New York Fashion Week, and RadarOnline.com has the pics.\n\nThe 33-year-old Disturbing Behavior star donned a clean, metropolitan look for the busy morning, pairing a black leather jacket with dark skinny jeans, gold pumps and dark glasses.\n\nInside New York's Lincoln Center, the busy mom primped a stable of models for a runway walk, and posed for publicity photos with her business parter, Jeanne Yang.\n\nAs RadarOnline.com previously reported, Katie has also inked a pact believed to be in the $2-3 million range with Est√©e Lauder subsidiary Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, who will make her the face of their forthcoming ad campaigns.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nWhere's Tom?
