        "text": "At one point in time, Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise were one of the world's most famous couples. Their relationship was one no one wanted to look away from – from beginning to end.\n\nWatch: Tom Cruise on Scientology. Post continues after video.\n\nVideo via Supplied.\n\nWhile Cruise was one of the biggest male celebrities in the world, Holmes had carved out her own niche as the go-to love interest in films.\n\nHer star began to rise when she played 'Joey Potter' in the hit 90s show, Dawson's Creek.\n\nShe began acting in the role at just 19 years old and started dating her co-star Joshua Jackson, before becoming engaged to actor Chris Klein. They split amicably in 2005.\n\nDuring and after Dawson's Creek (which ended after six seasons) Holmes starred in the films Teaching Mrs Tingle, First Daughter, Disturbing Behaviour and Go.\n\nHowever, it wouldn't be her acting talent to throw her into A-lister territory, but her relationship with Tom Cruise, which began in 2005.\n\nA year prior, she told Seventeen she'd had a crush on the Top Gun actor.\n\n\"I think every little girl dreams about her wedding. I used to think I was going to marry Tom [Cruise],\" she said.\n\nIt was reported at the time that the pair had met after Cruise had planned a meeting between them, since he'd been developing an interest in the young actress.\n\nJust a month after meeting, in May 2005, Cruise made a public and loud declaration of his love for Holmes, on The Oprah Winfrey Show.\n\nJumping up and down onto the interview couch, he said: \"I'm in love. I'm in love and it's one of those things where you want to be cool, like, 'Yeah I like her'... that's not how I feel... I wanted to meet this person, and I met her and she's extraordinary.\"\n\nWinfrey later told the press she was confused by Cruise's behaviour.\n\nTheir rapid engagement announcement was made just seven weeks later and a year on, in 2006, their daughter, Suri, was born.\n\nThe details of their relationship, for the most part, were kept private (despite constantly kissing on red carpets), and yet they were a couple the media had become completely enamoured by.\n\nEvery small detail obtained was picked apart and analysed by all. The pair gushed about each other in media interviews, held a very public wedding in the small coastal town of Bracciano, Italy, and even performed a seductive dance with one another for a charity event.\n\nHolmes had converted to Scientology, and even reportedly turned down a role in the film Factory Girl, due to the church's views on psychiatry.\n\nBut then, in 2011, the pair's dynamic began to shift.\n\nHolmes spoke less of her husband on red carpets and instead focussed on her daughter or acting roles.\n\nDuring that time, she told Marie Claire, \"I feel ready. For the next chapter in my life. I’m excited to begin a new phase: roles I might have been afraid to play, places I want to travel with my daughter.\"\n\nIn 2012, almost six years into their marriage, Holmes unexpectedly filed for divorce. She used a disposable phone to make calls about her separation and employed three law firms across three states.\n\n10 years on since the couple split, the details surrounding why exactly the pair decided to go their separate ways have always been kept a secret. Speculatively, many allege Cruise's devotion to the Church of Scientology played a major role in the breakdown of their relationship.\n\nRumours have swirled about how the church raises children, and it was alleged Holmes had thought about sending Suri to the Sea Org, a Scientology organisation where children are reportedly subjected to forced labour at sea.\n\n\"Insiders\" also claimed Cruise had demanded peculiar rules be placed on his ex-wife during their divorce settlement, such as making her agree to not date another man publicly for five years after their divorce, so as not to \"embarrass\" him.\n\nMost importantly, it is believed the divorce settlement outlined Suri would not have any involvement with the Church of Scientology. As such, it's assumed Cruise does not spend much time with his daughter due to members being forced to cut off family members who are not a part of the religion.\n\nListen to The Spill: How Tom Cruise tricked us into forgiving his sins. Post continues after audio.\n\nSo, where are Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes now?\n\nSince their divorce over a decade ago, there have been a string of relationships that have followed in their wake.\n\nHolmes surprised everyone when it was revealed she was dating actor Jamie Foxx, before they split after almost six years together in August 2019. They had started dating almost a year after Holmes' divorce from Cruise.\n\nIt was reported at the time that the pair had pulled the plug because \"he's disrespectful and their lives were different.\"\n\nIn 2020, Holmes began dating again, this time with restauranter Emilio Vitolo Jr. They dated for a year before breaking up.\n\nThis year, the actor was seen seemingly happy and in love again, this time with Grammy-nominated musician and composer, Bobby Wooten III. Wooten has worked with Moulin Rouge! The Musical on Broadway and performed at Coachella in the past.\n\nHolmes is also set to star in the romantic comedy, Alone Again, which is due for release in theatres from July 22. She also wrote and directed the film. The directorial project follows her 2016 drama All We Had.\n\nCruise also recently walked the red carpet for his 2022 film Top Gun: Maverick. The hit sequel has had premieres across the globe, sparking a resurgence of interest in the actor.\n\nHe recently separated from his Mission Impossible 7 co-star Hayley Atwell in June 2022, for a second time. While it was assumed the pair \"hit it off from day one\" two years prior, the couple did not last.\n\nDespite the internet and media fodder that has surrounded Holmes and Cruise for the past 17 years, it appears the pair have moved on amicably since their complicated divorce over 10 years ago.\n\nFeature Image: Getty / Mamamia.\n\nHave you got a health goal?
