        "text": "Katie Holmes‘ fashion line Holmes & Yang has come to an end, as the actress-turned-designer and her longtime stylist, Jeanne Yang (who also styles Milla Jovovich and Andrew Garfield), have called it quits.\n\nIt’s not clear why the brand, which launched in 2009, ended, but one outlet, Page Six, reported that it was due to “interpersonal conflict.” The news site also reported that Barneys New York is no longer selling the label.\n\nPHOTOS: THR’s 25 Most Powerful Stylists 2013\n\nWhen Holmes and Yang graced the cover of The Hollywood Reporter’s 25 Most Powerful Stylists List in 2012, Holmes shared why she enjoyed working with the stylist, saying, “Jeanne doesn’t scrimp on the little things — it’s those details, like a leather collar on a delicate dress, that make the look work.” The duo made their New York Fashion Week debut in September 2012 with their spring 2013 collection, which former New York Times fashion critic Eric Wilson (now with InStyle) described as being “too safe,” while former Glamour fashion director Anne Christensen praised the simple separates as “great.”\n\nYang, who was spotted at the Giorgio Armani Oscars cocktail party Friday, didn’t mention the line’s discontinuation. Instead, she was in great spirits and said she was looking forward to watching the Oscars.\n\nReps for Holmes and Yang have not yet responded to Pret-a-Reporter‘s request for comments."
