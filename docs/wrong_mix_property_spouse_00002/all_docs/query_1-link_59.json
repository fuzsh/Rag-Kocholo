Have an account? .\n\nOn Friday, Katie Holmes (sort of) surprised the world by filing for divorce from Tom Cruise, her husband of five years and father to her six-year-old daughter, Suri.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCruise was also apparently \"blindsided\" by the news, and has released a statement through his rep that he is \"deeply saddened\" by Holmes' actions.\n\nBut where did the couple, who often engaged in public PDA, go wrong?\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nWas it the Scientology? Careers? Their contract was up?\n\nLet's take a look back at TomKat's six years together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2005: After calling off her engagement to actor Chris Klein, Katie Holmes began dating Tom Cruise. The couple make their first public appearance together in Rome.\n\nJune 17, 2005: Two months after they began dating, Cruise proposed to Holmes on top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2005: Cruise proclaims his love for Holmes by jumping on Oprah's couch and exclaiming, \"This woman's amazing. I'm happy that I'm with her. She's amazing, and I'd think the same of her even if she wasn't with me. She's just amazing.\"\n\nOn April 18, 2006: Holmes gave birth to the couple's only child together, a daughter named Suri. In Persian, the name means \"red rose\" and in Hebrew, \"princess.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOctober 2006: The first photographs of Suri appeared in Vanity Fair. The Annie Leibovitz shots became the publication's second-best selling issue of all time, selling more than 700,000 copies.\n\nNovember 18, 2006: The couple were married at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, Italy, in a Scientology ceremony attended by many Hollywood stars such as Will Smith, the Beckhams and Jennifer Lopez.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanuary 2008: Tom Cruise's Scientology indoctrination video goes viral.\n\nMarch 2011: Katie Holmes filed a $50 million libel lawsuit against the Star Magazine following a cover story which insinuated that she took drugs.The suit was settled on April 27, 2011, when Star wrote a public apology in the May 6, 2011, issue along with an undisclosed \"substantial\" donation to Katie's charity, Dizzy Feet Foundation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFebruary 2012: Cruise's \"Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol\" earns $693,054,071 worldwide, becoming the actor's most successful film of his career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApril 2012: The couple shoot down rumors that Holmes is pregnant again, despite telling Marie Claire in 2010 that she would possibly be open to having another baby \"in a couple of years. Right now I want to make sure I'm really there for Suri.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMay 2012: Cruise talks to Playboy magazine about his wife, but doesn't reveal any hints of trouble in paradise. \"She is an extraordinary person, and if you spent five minutes with her, you'd see it. I'm a romantic. I like doing things like creating romantic dinners, and she enjoys that ... I'm just happy, and I have been since the moment I met her. What we have is very special.\"\n\nJune 2012: Holmes is noticeably absent from Cruise's side on the red carpet as he promotes his film \"Rock of Ages,\" currently in theaters. The last time the couple were seen together was in February.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJune 29, 2012: People magazine breaks the news that Holmes has filed for divorce from Cruise, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nKatie's lawyer said: \"This is a personal and private matter for Katie and her family. Katie's primary concern remains, as it always has been, her daughter's best interest.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom's rep said: \"Kate has filed for divorce and Tom is deeply saddened and is concentrating on his three children. Please allow them their privacy to work this out.\"\n\nWHAT'S NEXT? According to TMZ, the couple have a prenup but Holmes is asking for sole custody of their daughter, a \"suitable amount\" of child support and a division of property. The couple's estimated joint worth is around $275 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKatie Holmes hasn't said why she filed for divorce ...\n\nBut you have to wonder if it has something to do with this >\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
