        "text": "With two parents who act, it’s no wonder that Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise’s daughter Suri Cruise got the acting bug. Not only did she star in her high school’s musical of Addams Family, which onlookers said she was “amazing” at, but she’s acting in local theater too! Along with that, eagle-eyed fans noticed a unique detail about Suri’s theater career, one that shows Tom truly has nothing to do with her life as an adult.\n\nPer HelloMagazine, Suri acted in a play with a local theater company, who did a rendition of the iconic play Head Over Heels, which is a comedy musical that utilizes the catalog of The Go-Go’s. It ran from May 3-5. Suri played the role of Philoclea in two shows that weekend, who is the King’s daughter in love with her childhood friend. (We will not be linking directly to the company to obtain some form of privacy for Suri).\n\nNow, when you look at the billing, you can see Suri’s name, but instead of “Suri Cruise,” it’s Suri Noelle.\n\nThis isn’t the first time she’s gone by this stage name of using her middle name, and it shows that she potentially feels two things. She could feel that she doesn’t want to be defined by her Hollywood status, and that she may not want Tom to have anything to do with her time acting.\n\nIt seems like she’s making a killing in acting, and we can’t wait to see what blossoms for Suri Noelle.\n\nFor those who don’t know, Holmes and Tom started dating in early 2005, and within a year, they welcomed their daughter Suri Cruise on April 2006 (and married seven months later). Later, Holmes filed for divorce from Tom in 2012, and since then, Suri has reportedly been estranged from Tom, and this latest move proves their lack of a bond.\n\nPer DailyMail, the 18-year-old is considering majoring in either music or fashion when she enters college, but maybe that’ll change to acting? Any way she goes, we’re sure she’ll be great at it!"
