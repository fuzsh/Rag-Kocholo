Tom who? Scientolo-what?

After a summer full of stone-faced silence, Katie Holmes finally had reason to embrace the media Wednesday, looking quite the fashionista as she premiered her clothing line Holmes & Yang at New York Fashion Week, and RadarOnline.com has the pics.

The 33-year-old Disturbing Behavior star donned a clean, metropolitan look for the busy morning, pairing a black leather jacket with dark skinny jeans, gold pumps and dark glasses.

Inside New York's Lincoln Center, the busy mom primped a stable of models for a runway walk, and posed for publicity photos with her business parter, Jeanne Yang.

As RadarOnline.com previously reported, Katie has also inked a pact believed to be in the $2-3 million range with Est√©e Lauder subsidiary Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, who will make her the face of their forthcoming ad campaigns.
