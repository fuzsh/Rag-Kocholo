The town is located beside the Sultani River linked from the Meghna river in the north to the Tentulia River in the south. It is bordered by Gobindapur union in the north east, Bhola Sadar in the south east, Chandpur and Char Ekkaria union in the west, also briefly touched by Dharmaganj River in the north and Tentulia River in the south.\n\nThe annual monsoon rains from July to September is both a blessing and a curse for the people of Bangladesh. In 2007, the river Meghna engulfed more than 12,000 acres (49 km2) of land, making almost forty thousand people landless. Not enough has been done to rehabilitate the affected people or stop the erosion, compelling locals to help each other with their limited resources. It's not just the poor who are affected by the floods. In the last 300 years, the feudal landlord (Zamindar) of Ulania of Mehendigonj built an estate of 100 magnificent architectural buildings which are also under the threat of Meghna erosion.\n\nDemographics\n\nAt the 2001 Bangladesh census, Ulania had a population of 36000. Males constituted 18,572 of the population, and females 17,428. Ulania had an average literacy rate of 75% (7+ years), against the national average of 60%.\n\nAdministration\n\nUlania has 13 villages, 13 mouzas, 4 bazars, 2 waterbodies. Every five year the election take place to elect local government heads known as chairman. The lower branch of chairman are called members. Maheb Miah is the current chairman of Ulania Union. He was elected on 23 January 2009 in 9 wards. He has 13 members to work with him in his cabinet in which 9 are male members and 3 are female members. There are 19,605 of total voters in which 10,161 are male and 9,444 are female voters.\n\nVillages\n\nAsha\n\nBailla\n\nHarni\n\nHassanpur\n\nHogultory\n\nLalganj\n\nMollikpur\n\nNayakhali\n\nNayonpur\n\nPurboshatti\n\nRajapur\n\nSultani\n\nSoldi\n\nPalpara\n\nUlania: The capital of the union is located beside a canal adjacent to Ulania.\n\nBazaars\n\nHazir Hut: Organised every Friday, Sunday and Wednesday and is the smallest hut than any other.

Motorbikes are also used as a term of transport for carrying passengers as well.
