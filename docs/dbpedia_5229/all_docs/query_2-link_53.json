        "text": "\"Stanley\" is a 17.3hh 5 year old bay Royal Dutch Sporthorse gelding or KWPN imported from the United Kingdom. Stanley is featured exclusively under Team Monserrate Equestrian. His father is the late Eurocommerce Singapore. As a six year old, grey Eurocommerce Singapore was not far off the overal champion of the ZFDP approvals in Kreuth (Bavaria). At the time he was called Acquit-H; the H stood for Hof Himmerich, the stud of his breeder François Schneider. Two months later he was certified by the Rheinland-Pfalz stud book. At his performance test in Adelheidsdorf (1997), Eurocommerce Singapore’s sire Acorado I was champion with a fabulously high index with 149.24 for jumping. In his list of marks he has the maximum score of 10 points for jumping twice. Singapore’s dam F-Cora is by Cantus-Cor de la Bryère, also one of the ‘small’ lines that contribute to distributing blood within the Holstein population, according to Lambriden International stallions and young stock.\n\n\"Stanley\" has fantastic paces with a huge yet rateable stride. He will be the ideal Grand Prix horse with all the scope or an exceptional medal mount for the competitive Equitation rider. Singacord D is a Team Monserrate Equestrian exclusive horse where more information and highlights on career, performance, winnings, full vet information, x-rays, and passport/competition documents, for serious perspective clients can be found and requested through access on our private marketing Team Portal located on this website.\n\nSingacord D is currently not for sale at this time and is being retained for the competition season.\n\nWe are excited for the future with this truly talented gentleman.\n\n“Lania” is a 6 year old Selle Francais 17.2hh bay mare imported from France. Her sire, Dollar de la Pierre (alias Tlaloc M) shown below, is the son of the famous SF stallion Quidam de Revel. Dollar de la Pierre was one of the best show jumping horses in France during his career, and was on the winning team at the WEG in Jerez in 2002. In 2003 he got European silver with the French team in Donaueschingen. He has left several great offspring, such as HH Rebozo who is ridden by Rodrigo Pessoa.\n\nUlania’s grand dam's sire is the French legend Papillon Rouge, a stallion who has become one of the leading progenitors of upper level competition horses. He appears regularly in the top level of sport horse sires in all studbooks and through his sire, Jalisco B, carries some of the most influential jumping bloodlines in the world.\n\nLania is currently showing 1.20m with the potential to go higher and will be a fantastic mount for hunter derbys. She is not mare-ish, incredibly easy to ride, does not pull, very willing over fences, has ground covering stride, and is the ideal hunter. She is well-behaved on the ground and under saddle and has automatic lead changes. Lania is currently in full training and has a future in all three rings.\n\nUlania is a Team Monserrate Equestrian exclusive horse where more information and highlights on career, performance, winnings, full vet information, x-rays, and passport/competition documents, for serious perspective clients can be found and requested through access on our private marketing Team Portal on this website.\n\n​\n\nUlania is currently not for sale at this time. She is being utilized as a donor mare for our breeding program. Check out more information on that be visiting our page Chateau Vista Farm, LLC.\n\nWe are excited for the future with this phenomenally bred mare."
