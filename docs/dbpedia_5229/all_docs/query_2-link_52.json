        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Erlian Basin is located in central Inner Mongolia (Nei Mongol), near the China-Mongolia border (Jiang, 1983; Wang et al., 2012). Deposits of the Erlian Basin range nearly continuously from the late Paleocene to the Oligocene, and produce a large number of fossil mammals and other vertebrates. The lithostratigraphic units in the Erlian Basin include the Houldjin, Arshanto, Irdin Manha, Tukhum, Ulan Shireh, Shara Murun, Ulan Gochu, and Baron Sog formations, named by the Central Asiatic Expedition (CAE), as well as the Nomogen Formation and other lithological units that were proposed by later researchers (Jiang, 1983; Wang et al., 2012). The basin was first investigated by the Russian geologist V.A. Obruchev in 1892, and then during the 1920s, the CAE of the American Museum of Natural History extensively explored the area over five field seasons (fig. 1) (Andrews, 1932; Berkey and Morris, 1927). After the CAE suspended its work after 1930, the Sino-Soviet Paleontological Expedition (SSPE) conducted investigations in 1959–1960 the fossiliferous deposits of the Erlian Basin (Chow and Rozhdestvensky, 1960), followed by the Regional Geological Survey of the Nei Mongol Autonomous Region (1960s–1970s) (Jiang, 1983) and the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, in collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History and Carnegie Museum of Natural History, from the 1980s to the present time (Meng et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2010; Jin, 2012; Wang et al., 2012). Derived from that extensive work, the Eocene Asian Land Mammal Ages (ALMA) were established based mainly on the mammalian faunas from the Erlian Basin (Romer, 1966; Tong et al., 1995; Wang et al., 2007; Vandenberghe et al., 2012).\n\nThe Eocene mammalian faunas of the Erlian Basin are dominated by diverse perissodactyls (Tong et al., 1995; Wang et al., 2007). Perissodactyls from the Erlian Basin consist of members of Tapiroidea, Rhinocerotoidea, Brontotheriidae, and Chalicotherioidea. Since the first report on perissodactyl paraceratheres from Houldjin (Osborn, 1923a), numerous studies, including many papers and some monographs, have contributed to our knowledge of perissodactyls based on the abundant, relatively complete material from the Erlian Basin. The brontotheres were reviewed by Granger and Gregory (1943) and Mihlbachler (2008) on the basis of numerous, complete skulls in the CAE collection. Wang (1982) described a skeleton of the brontothere Rhinotitan mongoliensis in detail based on material in the SSPE collection from Ula Usu. Radinsky (1965, 1967) studied the tapiroids and hyracodontids from the Paleogene of Asia based principally on the CAE collection. Xu (1966) analyzed many amynodont fossils collected by the SSPE from Inner Mongolia. Qiu and Wang (2007) reviewed the Asian Paraceratheriidae and studied a nearly complete skeleton of Juxia from Ula Usu. However, some perissodactyls from various localities in the Erlian Basin, particularly specimens in the CAE collection, were reported from horizons and formations that had been misinterpreted because of the complexity of correlating terrestrial stratigraphic sections. For instance, the names “Irdin Manha Formation” and “Houldjin Formation” applied by the CAE in the Huheboerhe area (Camp Margetts and neighboring areas) are mostly considered today to be Arshanto and Irdin Manha formations, respectively (Meng et al., 2007). On the other hand, most CAE specimens fortunately retain an association between their field numbers and related field notes, which indicate more specific, accurate layers in the local stratigraphic sections (Meng et al., 2007). Over the past decade, we have recovered many new perissodactyl fossil specimens in the Erlian Basin, and detailed studies of most of them are ongoing. Here, we clarify the distributions of the Paleogene perissodactyls at specific levels from the Erlian Basin based on published specimens, archives, and the preliminary results of our recent fieldwork (appendices 1, 2). In this paper, we focus on biostratigraphic and lithostratigraphic correlations rather than the morphology of perissodactyls from the Erlian Basin. Additionally, a revised correlation of the Eocene ALMAs with their corresponding NALMAs is proposed based mainly on perissodactyl fossils. It also worth noting that a decrease in perissodactyl diversity from the middle Eocene to the early Oligocene likely can be attributed to a cooling trend of global climatic change over that period of time.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nBased on the data about the temporal and spatial distribution of Paleogene perissodactyls from the Erlian Basin (figs. 2–4), we address some long-standing problems about the biostratigraphic correlation of the Paleogene sediments in the Erlian Basin, and discuss perissodactyl diversity through the early Eocene to the early Oligocene in the following section.\n\n“Houldjin Formation” in the Huheboerhe area\n\nGranger and Berkey (1922) named the Houldjin beds on the Houldjin escarpment, which are dominated by yellow, pebbly gravels about 4.6 m (fig. 5A) (Berkey and Morris, 1927). The Houldjin fauna at the type locality includes a variety of perissodactyl taxa such as the brontotheriid Metatitan sp., paraceratheriid Aralotherium sp., amynodontids Cadurcodon ardyensis and C. houldjinensis, rhinocerotids Aprotodon lanzhouensis and Symphysorrhachis? sp. (Matthew and Granger, 1923a; Qiu and Wang, 2007; Wang et al., 2009). The age of the Houldjin fauna remains controversial and varies in age estimates from the late Eocene to the late Oligocene (Qiu and Wang, 2007; Wang et al., 2009). This discrepancy is attributed to the fragmentary material known from the formation and probably a mixture of taxa from different horizons (Wang et al., 2012).\n\nMeng et al. (2007) pointed out that the so-called “Houldjin Formation” and “Irdin Manha Formation” by CAE in the Huheboerhe area are mostly Irdin Manha and Arshanto formations, respectively (Wang et al., 2010). Though Wang et al. (2012) noticed the “yellow gravels” present in Huheboerhe area, it is uncertain whether they belong to the Houldjin Formation. However, some perissodactyls from the “Houldjin gravels” in the Huheboerhe area obviously are more advanced than those from type Irdin Manha Formation, including the deperetellid Deperetella sp., amynodontid Zaisanamynodon borisovi, paraceratheriids Urtinotherium intermedium and Paraceratherium grangeri, and possibly the brontothere Metatitan. It is notable that except for Deperetella sp. and Metatitan, the other species are recorded either by an isolated tooth or postcrania, hampering the comparisons with Houldjin fauna from the type locality. Qiu and Wang (2007, p169) also mentioned a maxilla with P3-M2 of Allacerops turgaica from the “Houldjin gravels” at Daoteyin Obo. These advanced perissodactyls are indicative of a late Eocene Ergilian and/or early Oligocene Hsandagolian age. Whether those taxa recovered from the “yellow gravels” warrant further investigation, strata younger than the Irdin Manha Formation likely are present in the Huheboerhe area (Qiu and Wang, 2007). As noted by Meng et al. (2007: 18), the “Houldjin gravels may be represented only by a thin layer of loose sand and conglomerates forming the Gobi surface” in the Huheboerhe area.\n\nUlan Shireh Formation at the North Mesa\n\nIn 1925, the CAE investigated Wulantaolegai (4 mi north of Tukhum Lamasery) and Wulanhuxiu (8 mi north of Tukhum Lamasery) at North Mesa for the first time (fig. 1), and all collections were recorded from the “Shara Murun beds” (Granger, 1925). Granger (1925: 66) further noted that all fossils were from layers below an “apple red stratum.” During the second investigation of the North Mesa, Granger (1928: 6) divided the sediments at “Chimney Butte” (Wulanhuxiu) into 14 layers from the top to the bottom (fig. 6), with layers 3–5 grouped into an upper “red member” and layers 6–14 grouped into a lower “white member” (fig. 5B). Almost all specimens were collected from the “Buckshot's Quarry” at Chimney Butte, which is equivalent to layer 9 of Granger's (1928) sketch and roughly layer 4 of Li et al. (2016a). The exception is that of the creodont Sarkastodon mongoliensis (AMNH FM 26302, field no. 641) from the relatively lower layer 12 (Granger, 1938). A few specimens, such as AMNH FM 26115 of Breviodon sp. and AMNH FR 6697 of fossil turtle Anosteira mongoliensis (Gilmore, 1931), not otherwise recorded from the “Buckshot's Quarry” in the Chimney Butte section were labeled with the field number 645. In addition, a few specimens of the brontothere Metatitan primus (AMNH FM 26101, 26102) and turtles were collected from Big Red Draw and Northwest Promontory, which are located 1 mi southwest and northwest of the Chimney Butte Camp, respectively. AMNH FM 26102 is from the middle of upper red beds (Granger, 1928). Thus, almost all the previous CAE collections from North Mesa probably were unearthed from the lower “white member” and below the “red member,” with an exception of Metatitan primus (Wang et al., 2012). Similarly, Chow and Rozhdestvensky (1960) noted that most of the fossils from North Mesa (= Ulan Shireh) collected by SSPE were from the lower part of the formation.\n\nBerkey et al. (1929) named the Ulan Shireh Formation for the deposits at North Mesa, which are dominated by red clays, though gray clays, sands, and gravels also are present (fig. 5B). The Ulan Shireh Formation is considered equivalent to the Tukhum Formation (Berkey et al., 1929), and the mammalian fauna from the Ulan Shireh Formation is considered to be homogenous and roughly correlated to the Irdinmanhan (Radinsky, 1964a; Ye, 1983; Wang et al., 2012). However, recent investigation suggests that the upper part of the section probably belongs to the Sharamurunian (Li et al., 2016a), and the basal part may extend down into the Arshantan (Mao and Wang, 2012; Bai et al., 2018a).\n\nAssuming that most previous collections from Wulanhuxiu and Wulantaolegai are from a relatively lower horizon (roughly equivalent to the “white member”), the lower part of the Ulan Shireh Formation can be correlated with the Irdin Manha Formation based on their shared species (fig. 3; appendix 1) including lophialetids Lophialetes expeditus, Zhongjianoletes chowi, and Rhodopagus pygmaeus, the deperetellid Teleolophus medius, the hyracodontid Triplopus proficiens, the paraceratheriid Fostercooperia ulanshirhensis, and the brontotheriid Microtitan mongoliensis. They also share the lophialetid genera Simplaletes and Breviodon. The brontothere Metatitan primus has been reported from the Big Red Draw and North Promontory in North Mesa, and similarly, many specimens Metatitan relictus have been found in the Irdin Manha Formation near Camp Margetts. However, the Irdin Manha Formation also bears the paraceratheriid Forstercooperia totadentata, helaletids, and some brontotheres that have not been reported yet or are different from those of the Ulan Shireh Formation. Teleolophus medius? also has been reported from the middle horizon of upper part of the Ulan Shireh Formation (“red member”) at Wulanhuxiu (Bai et al., 2018a).\n\nComments on the Shara Murun and Ulan Gochu Formations\n\nThe Shara Murun Formation at Baron Sog Mesa was mentioned first by Berkey and Granger (1923) without description. Berkey and Morris (1927) formally named the Shara Murun Formation as consisting of two members: an upper member dominated by white and light-gray sandstone with gravels; and a lower member dominated by sandy clay with varied colors (Berkey and Morris, 1927; Wang et al., 2012) (fig. 4, 7A; see also Wang et al., 2012: fig. 2A). Later, the “Shara Murun Formation” also was applied to some strata at East Mesa, Erden Obo, and Nom Khong Obo (Osborn, 1929; Qi, 1990b). However, these correlations remain controversial (Wang et al., 2012). For the sake of clarity, we listed perissodactyls from the Shara Murun Formation exclusively at Baron Sog Mesa (fig. 4).\n\nThough the mammalian fauna from the Shara Murun Formation is considered to be homogeneous, species may be recovered from different members and represent different evolutionary stages. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the brontotheres Titanodectes minor and Pachytitan ajax are considered more advanced than Rhinotitan, resembling Embolotherium to some extent (Granger and Gregory, 1943; Mihlbachler, 2008), and their co-occurrence in a single horizon seems improbable. Rhinotitan, Juxia sharamurenensis, and various amynodontids collected by SSPE were found in the lower part of the Shara Murun Formation near the Well of Ula Usu (Chow and Rozhdestvensky, 1960). On the other hand, both Titanodectes minor and Pachytitan ajax were recorded from the “gray beds” of the Shara Murun Formation, 4 mi north of Baron Sog Mesa, and that horizon is more likely to be in the upper, gray and white, member rather than a lower, red and brown, member (Berkey et al., 1929: fig. 4; Wang et al., 2012: fig. 2A). Thus, it is reasonable to infer that the mammalian faunas from the lower and upper parts of the Shara Murun Formation are probably heterogeneous, and they should be treated with caution.\n\nThe Ulan Gochu Formation was named by Berkey et al. (1929) as a wedge-shaped mass of red clay along the Baron Sog Mesa (fig. 7B). The Ulan Gochu Formation overlies the Shara Murun Formation, and is overlain by the Baron Sog Formation. The “Ulan Gochu Formation” later was expanded to include a much wider extension of the strata at Erden Obo and Nom Khong Obo (Osborn, 1929), and its boundaries with the underlying “Shara Murun Formation” are uncertain in these areas. The previous mammalian fauna from the “Ulan Gochu Formation” is mainly from East Mesa (Twin Obos and Jhama Obo) and/or Erden Obo (Li and Ting, 1983; Russell and Zhai, 1987; Tsubamoto et al., 2004). For the sake of clarity, we consider the perissodactyls of Ulan Gochu Formation exclusively from Baron Sog Mesa where the formation was named. Only Embolotherium grangeri and Amynodontopsis parvidens have been reported from typical Ulan Gochu Formation outcrops (Osborn, 1929; Granger and Gregory, 1943; Mihlbachler, 2008). Interestingly, Titanodectes minor from the upper part of the Shara Murun Formation even was considered to be a synonym of Embolotherium grangeri (Mihlbachler, 2008), indicating that the perissodactyls from the upper part of the Shara Murun Formation are more similar to those from the overlying Ulan Gochu Formation than to those from the lower part of the Shara Murun Formation.\n\nCorrelation of the Erden Obo section\n\nOsborn (1929) first reported the Erden Obo (= Urtyn Obo) section based on Granger's (1928) sketch, and divided the section into eight units from the bottom to the top: “Basal Red,” “Basal White,” “Lower Red,” “Lower White” (19.8 m), “Middle Red” (21.3 m), “Middle White or Gray” (9.1 m), “Upper Red” (29.0 m), and “Upper White” (7.6 m) (figs. 8, 9). Osborn (1929) correlated the “Basal Red” to the “?Arshanto Formation,” the “Basal White” to the “Shara Murun Formation,” the upper part of the “Lower White” to the “Upper Red” collectively to the “Ulan Gochu Formation,” and the “Upper White” to the “Baron Sog Formation.” The “Lower Red” and the lower part of the “Lower White” were considered either the “Shara Murun” and/or “Ulan Gochu” formations. Different correlations of the Erden Obo section in the Erlian Basin have been proposed since Osborn (1929), and were reviewed in detail by Wang et al. (2012). Among them, Jiang (1983) measured and divided the section of Erden Obo into 23 layers, and proposed several new lithological units for the sediments. However, Qi (1990b) applied conventional formational names to the deposits based on the same division of layers of Jiang (1983). Wang et al. (2012) suggested that the “Basal Red” should be Nomogen Formation and the “Upper White” should be the Upper Naogangdai Formation, and the correlation of other layers at Erden Obo remains unclear. Various perissodactyl fossils have been reported from different units at Erden Obo with the exception of the “Basal Red,” and they can contribute to a refinement of the biostratigraphic correlation with other type localities in the Erlian Basin.\n\nThe “Basal Red” layer is equivalent to layers 1–4 of Jiang's section, and is dominated by light brownish-red sandy mudstones (Jiang, 1983; Qi, 1990b). The “Basal White” layer is equivalent to layers 5–6 of Jiang's section, and is dominated by grayish white, light-green coarse sandstones and grayish white siltstones and fine sandstones (Jiang, 1983; Qi, 1990b). Recently, on the basis of rodent fossils, Li et al. (2018) correlated upper part of the “Basal Red” to the Nomogen Formation of Bumbanian age, and they further correlated the lower part and middle part of “Basal White” to the upper part of the Arshanto Formation and lower part of the Irdin Manha Formation, respectively. Similarly, Mao and Wang (2012) mentioned the presence of the Arshantan coryphodontid Eudinoceras mongoliensis from the base of “Basal White.” Among the perissodactyls, both Schlosseria magister and Lophialetes expeditus? have been reported from the “Basal White” (fig. 10) (Radinsky, 1965; Li and Wang, 2010), supporting the correlation of the bed with both the Arshanto and Irdin Manha formations as suggested by Li et al. (2017). However, whether the two species are from different horizons is unknown. In recent fieldwork, we collected a partial skull of a relatively primitive deperetellid, which is similar to those from the Arshanto Formation, from the lower part of “Basal White,” in addition to specimens of cranial material of the Irdinmanhan Teleolophus medius from the middle part of “Basal White.”\n\nThe “Lower Red” layer is usually considered to be equivalent to layer 7 of Jiang's section, which is dominated by light brick-red sandy clays (Jiang, 1983; Qi, 1990b). However, we consider the “Lower Red” layer also to include the overlying layer 8 of Jiang's section, which is dominated by mudstones with variable colors (see discussion below) (Jiang, 1983; Qi, 1990b). Qi et al. (1992) referred a single m3 and some postcrania to Protitan sp. from so-called “Tukhum Formation” (layer 7 of Jiang's section), which is equivalent to a part of the “Lower Red” bed (Wang et al., 2012) (fig. 10). However, Qi et al. (1992) noted that the m3 also is similar to that of Rhinotitan. Our recent fieldwork uncovered Caenolophus promissus and Teilhardia pretiosa from the “Lower Red” layer. The type specimen of C. promissus is known from the Shara Murun Formation, but that of T. pretiosa is recorded from the underlying Tukhum Formation at Ula Usu (Matthew and Granger, 1925b; 1926) (fig. 4). However, the horizon bearing Teilhardia pretiosa is controversial (Wang et al., 2012). In addition to perissodactyl fossils, the “Lower Red” bed also bears the lagomorph Gobiolagus aliwusuensis (Fostowicz-Frelik et al., 2012), and the rodents Gobiomys exiguus, Gobiomys neimongolensis, and Yuomys magnus (Li, 2017). Gobiolagus and the type specimens of Gobiomys neimongolensis are considered to be Sharamurnian in age (Meng et al., 2005; Fostowicz-Frelik et al., 2012; Li, 2017). As a result, the “Lower Red” bed is most likely correlative to the lower member of the Shara Murun Formation (Qiu and Wang, 2007).\n\nAccording to Granger's (1928) sketch, the “Lower Gray” is composed mainly of “white sands” with a “conglomerate layer” in the upper part and a “concretionary layer” at the top (figs. 8, 9A) (Wang et al., 2012: fig. 2B). The base of the “Lower White” first was considered to be equivalent to layer 10 of Jiang's section and correlated to the upper part of the Shara Murun Formation (Wang, 2001). Wang (2007a) later considered the “Lower White” to be equivalent to layers 8–9 and 10–13 of Jiang's section, and grouped the “Lower White” into the “Ulan Gochu Formation,” spanning from the “Lower White” to “Upper Red” (Qiu and Wang, 2007; Wang et al., 2012). Although Wang (2007a) noted that layers 8–9 of Jiang's section are same as layers 10–13 in lithology (grayish white sandstone), the layer 9 is mainly dominated by the grayish green mudstones with two lens of feldspathic quartz coarse sandstones (fig. 9A) (Jiang, 1983). Based on our recent fieldwork, we regard the “Lower White” as likely equivalent to layers 9–10 of Jiang's section (Jiang, 1983; Qi, 1990b).\n\nThe perissodactyl fossils from the “Lower White” include five genera and six species (fig. 10). Juxia sharamurenensis (AMNH FM 26753, field no. 734) is recorded from the base of the “Lower White” (Radinsky, 1967), and Amynodontopsis parvidens is known from the top of “Lower White,” and by abundant material from the base of overlying “Middle Red” bed. Urtinotherium parvum is known from the “Lower White” with IVPP field number 199102, which is the same horizon as IVPP field number 199104 bearing abundant small mammals according to B.Y. Wang's field notes. The horizon bearing Ulania wilsoni was reported as the base of “Ulan Gochu Formation” with a grayish green sandstone (Qi, 1990a), most likely is the “Lower White” (Qi, 1990b). The horizon producing the type of Juxia shoui was reported as the “Ulan Gochu Formation” (Qi and Zhou, 1989). However, Qiu and Wang (2007) suggested that layer may be the “Lower White” based on a lunar found in that layer, which presumably belong to J. shoui. Titanodectes minor (AMNH FM 26061, field no. 769) also was reported from the base of the “Lower White” and probably unearthed from the base according to Osborn's sketch (Osborn, 1929: fig. 2). Thus, the “Lower White” has produced Amynodontopsis parvidens, Urtinotherium parvum, Juxia shoui, J. sharamurenensis?, Ulania, and Titanodectes minor. It is necessary to note that whether the mandible with p2, p4-m3 (AMNH FM 26753) should be assigned to Juxia sharamurenensis remains controversial, because J. shoui, which is preserved only as a partial skull with a similar size, is also present in the same layer (Qi and Zhou, 1989). Considering that Urtinotherium parvum and Juxia shoui are more derived than J. sharamurenensis from the lower member of the Shara Murun Formation, and Titanodectes minor also is known from the upper member of the Shara Murun Formation, we believe that the “Lower White” can be correlated with the upper member of the Shara Murun, as suggested by Wang (2001).\n\nIn addition to perissodactyl fossils, various small mammalian fossils have been reported from the “Lower White,” including the rodents Gobiomys exiguus, G. asiaticus (Wang, 2001), Pappocricetodon antiquus, P. sp., and P.? sp. (Wang, 2007b), the lagomorph Desmatolagus vetustus (Wang, 2007a), the primate Eosimias sp. (Wang, 2008b), the insectivores Anatolechinos neimongolensis and Erinaceidae gen. et sp. indet., and an indeterminate chiropteran (Microchiroptera) (Wang, 2008a). All the small mammalian fossils were collected from a single pocket (IVPP Loc. 1991004), dominated by grayish-white sandstone with conglomerates. The horizon is considered to be equivalent to layer 10 of Jiang's section (Jiang, 1983; Wang, 2001), belonging to the “Lower White.”\n\nThe “Middle Red” layer has been considered equivalent to layers 14–15 of Jiang's (1983) section (Qiu and Wang, 2007; Wang et al., 2012). However, the “Middle Red” layer is more likely equivalent to layers 11–15 of Jiang's section, which is dominated by light brick-red silty mudstones and deep brownish red mudstones with grayish-white fine sandstone and siltstone at the base (fig. 9A) (Jiang, 1983; Qi, 1990b). The perissodactyl fossils from the “Middle Red” are relatively rare, and all were discovered from the base of the unit. These taxa include Teleolophus magnum, Amynodontopsis parvidens, and Embolotherium grangeri (Osborn, 1929; Radinsky, 1965; Wall, 1981; Mihlbachler, 2008) (fig. 10). The latter two species also are known from the base of the Ulan Gochu Formation at Baron Sog Mesa, and considering Embolotherium loucksii as a junior synonym of E. grangeri (Mihlbachler, 2008) (fig. 4). Thus, the “Middle Red” is likely correlative to the Ulan Gochu Formation at Baron Sog Mesa (Qi, 1990b; Qiu and Wang, 2007). The rodents Gobiomys exiguus and G. neimongolensis have been reported from “Middle Red” (Li, 2017). However, only the cylindrodont Ardynomys olsoni has been reported from the Ulan Gochu Formation, 4 mi north of Baron Sog Mesa (Wang and Meng, 2009). It is noteworthy that the perissodactyls from the “Lower White” are more similar to those from the overlying “Middle Red” in sharing Amynodontopsis parvidens and similar brontothere taxa than to those from underlying “Lower Red.”\n\nThe “Middle White” layer is equivalent to layers 16–17 of Jiang's section (Qiu and Wang, 2007; Wang et al., 2012), which is dominated by grayish white sandstones with gravels (fig. 9B) (Jiang, 1983; Qi, 1990b). The “Middle White” has a relatively diverse set of perissodactyl fossils (fig. 10), including Ardynia praecox (Radinsky, 1967; Bai et al., 2018b), Proeggysodon qiui (Bai and Wang, 2012), Urtinotherium intermedium (Chow and Qiu, 1963; Qiu and Wang, 2007), Zaisanamynodon borisovi (Lucas et al., 1996), Embolotherium andrewsi, and Parabrontops gobiensis (Osborn, 1925; Osborn, 1929; Granger and Gregory, 1943; Mihlbachler, 2008). Zaisanamynodon borisovi and E. andrewsi (= E. ultimum) also are known from the Barson Sog Formation at Baron Sog Mesa (Granger and Gregory, 1943; Lucas et al., 1996; Mihlbachler, 2008) (fig. 4). In addition, the artiodactyl Lophiomeryx anagare was recorded from both the “Middle White” bed (AMNH FM 26259, field no. 752) and the Baron Sog Formation at Baron Sog Mesa (AMNH FM 22113, field no. 593) (Wang, 2003). Thus, the “Middle White” can be correlated with the Baron Sog Formation, partly in agreement with Qi (1990b)'s proposal. Recently, Li (2017) reported the presence of the rodent Gobiomys neimogolensis in the “Middle White.”\n\nThe “Upper Red” layer is equivalent to layers 18–20 of Jiang's (1983) section, which is dominated by variegated mudstones, brick-red sandy clays with calcareous nodules, and deep brownish red, bright red mudstones (fig. 9B) (Jiang, 1983; Qi, 1990b). Jiang (1983) named the Lower Naogangdai Formation for both the “Middle White” and “Upper Red” layers. Only the chalicothere Schizotherium cf. S. avitum is known from “Upper Red” (Coombs, 1978) (fig. 10). In contrast, rodent fossils are relatively much more diverse, including cricetids (Eucricetodon wangae, E. sp., and Pappocricetodon siziwangqiensis), dipodids (Heosminthus nomogenesis, Sinosminthus sp., Allosminthus cf. A. majusculus, Allosminthus ernos, and A. cf. A. diconjugatus), and ctenodactyloids (Gobiomys exiguus, and G. neimongolensis) mainly from the lower and middle parts of the “Upper Red” beds (Li et al., 2016a, 2016b, 2016c; 2017). Li et al. (2016b, 2016c) suggested that the “Upper Red” is the late Eocene and correlative with the Ergilian.\n\nThe “Upper White” layer is equivalent to layers 21–23 of Jiang's section, which is dominated by grayish white, yellow coarse sandstones, liver-colored mudstone, and loose yellow sandy gravels (fig. 9B) (Jiang, 1983; Qi, 1990b). Jiang (1983) named the Upper Naogangdai Formation for the “Upper White” layer. Considering that the “Upper White” bed at Erden Obo can be correlated to that at Nom Khong (Wang, 2003), the perissodactyl fossils from the “Upper White” of both localities include Ardynia kazachstanensis, Paraceratherium grangeri, Zaisanamynodon borisovi, and Schizotherium cf. S. avitum (Coombs, 1978; Lucas et al., 1996; Wang, 2003) (fig. 10). In addition, tsaganomyid rodents Tsaganomys altaicus and Cyclomylus intermedius have been reported from the bed (Wang, 2003). The “Upper White” is considered to be late early Oligocene in age and different from the “Baron Sog Formation” (Wang, 2003), which is correlative to the underlying “Middle White.” The late early Oligocene age for the “Upper White” is further supported by the occurrence of Ardynia kazachstanensis, the type specimen of which was unearthed from the late early Oligocene deposits of Chelkar Teniz, Kazakhstan (Russell and Zhai, 1987; Qiu et al., 2004; Bai et al., 2018b). Although Zaisanamynodon borisovi is indicative of the late Eocene Ergilian, material of the species from the “Upper White” is represented only by a symphysis with i2 and canine (AMNH FM 26170) (Lucas et al., 1996), which is too incomplete to allow a confident taxonomic assignment.\n\nDiversity of Perissodactyls during Paleogene ALMAs\n\nIn the Gashantan, only some fragmentary teeth have been assigned to Perissodactyla without further determination (Meng et al., 1998). However, Meng et al. (1998) noted their similarities with the brontothere Lambdotherium. However, Tong et al. (2004) considered these materials to be similar to the condylarth Olbitherium.\n\nIn the early Eocene Bumbanian (Bowen et al., 2005; Ting et al., 2011), the lophialetid Minchenoletes erlianensis and presumably the hyracodontid Pataecops parvus are known (Wang et al., 2011) (fig. 11). However, Pataecops initially was included in the Lophialetidae (Radinsky, 1965).\n\nPerissodactyls from the middle Eocene Arshantan are dominated by members of Tapiroidea (figs. 3, 11), including lophialetids (Schlosseria magister and Breviodon cf. B. acares), deperetellids (Teleolophus primaries and T.? rectus), and the helaletid Heptodon minimus. The basal rhinocerotoid Hyrachyus and paraceratheriid Pappaceras also appeared in the Arshantan, but chalicotheres are represented only by Litolophus gobiensis from the base of the Arshanto Formation (Colbert, 1934; Bai et al., 2010; 2011a). Brontotheres are scarce with only some fragmentary material of Microtitan and Desmatotitan known (Qi, 1987). However, there is question as to whether those brontotheres were recovered in the Arshanto Formation. Based on our recent fieldwork, some new taxa of ceratomorphs have been found in the Arshanto Formation, indicating that the current diversity of perissodactyls in the Arshantan is probably underestimated. The Arshantan is usually correlated to the Bridgerian NALMA (Tong et al., 1995; Wang et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2009). Furthermore, the fauna from the upper part of Arshanto Formation exhibits some transitional features. Schlosseria magister and the coryphodontid Eudinoceras represent handover taxa from earlier strata, but the appearances of Pappaceras and Simplicimys bellus are indicative of a close relationship with that of the overlying Irdin Manha Formation (Li and Wang, 2010; Mao and Wang, 2012; Li and Meng, 2015; Wang et al., 2016).\n\nThe correlation of the Ulan Shireh Formation is still debatable, although we propose correlating it with the Irdin Manhan Formation. The perissodactyls from the Irdinmanhan are restricted to those from type Irdin Manha escarpment and Huheboerhe area. In the Irdinmanhan, perissodactyls reached their highest diversity and were dominated by brontotheres (figs. 3, 11), including six genera and seven species: Microtitan mongoliensis, Hyotitan thomsoni, Metatelmatherium ultimum, M. parvum, Protitan grangeri, P. minor, P.? cingulatus, Gnathotitan berkeyi, and Metatitan relictus. It is interesting to note that a large number of specimens of Protitan grangeri are known from Irdin Manha escarpment, and the contemporaneous Metatitan relictus is common at Duheminboerhe. Tapiroids from the Irdinmanhan become more diverse than those from the Arshantan, and they include seven genera and species: lophialetids (Lophialetes expeditus, Simplaletes sujiensis, Breviodon minutus, and ?Rhodopagus pygmaeus), the deperetellid Teleolophus medius, and helaletids (Desmatotherium mongoliense and Paracolodon fissus). Paraceratheriids are represented by Forstercooperia totadentata and F. ulanshirhensis. The hyracodontid Triplopus and amynodontid Rostriamynodon emerged during the Irdinmanhan. Bai et al. (2017) correlated the Irdinmanhan roughly with Ui1 and Ui2 subages of the Uintan NALMA based solely on perissodactyl fossils. Similarly, based on the small mam mals from the lower fossil-bearing horizon of the Hetaoyuan Formation in the Liguanqiang Basin, Tong (1997) suggested that Irdinmanhan can be correlated to the early Uintan NALMA.\n\nThe Sharamurunian and Ulangochuan are complex issues to address. As discussed above, the perissodactyls from the upper member of the Shara Murun Formation and “Lower White” of the Erden Obo are more similar to those from the overlying Ulan Gochu Formation and “Middle Red,” respectively, than to those from their underlying strata. However, previously the Sharamurunian probably was based largely on the entire fauna from both the lower and upper members of the Shara Murun Formation, although most fossils likely were found in the lower member (Russell and Zhai, 1987). On the other hand, previously the Ulangochuan mainly was based on the fauna from East Mesa and Erden Obo rather than those from the type Baron Sog Mesa (Russell and Zhai, 1987), and was a mixture of faunas from various ages and horizons. The following discussion on the Sharamurunian and Ulangochuan is based on the perissodactyls from Baron Sog Mesa and Erden Obo. However, the material from Twin Obos, Jhama Obo and nearby localities, and Nom Khong Obo were excluded, pending further investigation and correlation.\n\nPerissodactyls from the lower member of the original Shara Murun Formation and “Lower Red” of the Erden Obo (both may represent restricted Sharamurunian) are dominated by amynodontids (figs. 4, 10, 11), comprising five genera and six species: Sharamynodon mongoliensis, Sianodon ulausuensis, Lushiamynodon sharamurenensis, Gigantamynodon promisus, Caenolophus promissus, and C. obliquus (Matthew and Granger, 1925b; Osborn, 1936; Xu, 1966). However, Wall (1989) suggested that Lushiamynodon and some species of Sianodon should be placed in Sharamynodon, and Gigantamynodon likely is a nomen dubium. Tapiroidea is restricted to two species: the lophialetid Rhodopagus? minimus and the deperetellid Deperetella cristata (Radinsky, 1965). The hyracodontid Triplopus? progressus and the paraceratheriid Juxia sharamurenensis also are known (Radinsky, 1967; Qiu and Wang, 2007). The brontotheriidae is represented by Rhinotitan kaiseni and R. andrewsi (Granger and Gregory, 1943; Mihlbachler, 2008). The Sharamurunian is usually correlated to the late Uintan and Duchesnean NALMAs (Wang et al., 2007; Vandenberghe et al., 2012). However, Wang (1982) correlated the Sharamurunian with the late Uintan NALMA (Ui3) based on the similar evolutionary stage between Rhinotitan andrewsi and the late Uintan (Ui3) Protitanotherium (Robinson et al., 2004; Mihlbachler, 2008; Gunnell et al., 2009).\n\nRegarding the perissodactyls from the upper member of the original Shara Murun Formation, overlying Ulan Gochu Formation, and the “Lower White” and “Middle Red” of the Erden Obo (all may represent restricted Ulangochuan), the diversity of tapiroids radically decreased over time with only the deperetellid Teleolophus magnum remaining. The hyracodontid Ulania wilsoni and abundant amynodontid Amynodontopsis parvidens were present (figs. 4, 10, 11). Paraceratheres are represented by the more advanced Juxia shoui and Urtinotherium parvum rather than the underlying Juxia sharamurenensis (Qiu and Wang, 2007). Brontotheres are slightly more diverse than those from the restricted Sharamurunan, including Pachytitan ajax, Titanodectes minor, and Embolotherium grangeri (Granger and Gregory, 1943; Mihlbachler, 2008). Among perissodactyls from the restricted Ulangochuan, only Amynodontopsis is distributed in North America as the genotype A. bodei (Stock, 1933; Wall, 1989). Ulangochuan is usually correlated to the early Chadronian NALMA (Wang et al., 2007; Vandenberghe et al., 2012). However, considering that Amynodontopsis is known only from the Duchesnean NALMA (Lucas, 1992; Robinson et al., 2004), we tentatively correlate the restricted Ulangochuan with the whole Duchesnean NALMA.\n\nThe fauna from the Baron Sog Formation and the equivalent the “Middle White” of Erden Obo contain roughly equally diverse perissodactyl faunas as those from the Ulangochuan (figs. 4, 10, 11), including brontotheriids (Embolotherium andrewsi and Parabrontops gobiensis), abundant specimens of the amynodontid Zaisanamynodon borisovi, hyracodontids (Ardynia praecox and Proeggysodon qiui), and the paraceratheriid Urtinotherium intermedium. Since P. gobiensis, Z. borisovi, and A. praecox are indicative of late Eocene Ergilian (Dashzeveg, 1991; Dashzeveg, 1993), the Baron Sog Formation can be correlated to the Ergilian, which in turn can be correlated to the Chadronian NALMA.\n\nBoth brontotheres and amynodontids disappeared in the Oligocene Hsandagolian, as represented by the fauna from the “Upper White” at Erden Obo and its equivalent bed at Nom Khong Obo (Wang, 2003) (figs. 10, 11). The perissodactyl diversity decreases considerably, and consists of the hyracodontid Ardynia kazachstanensis, the paraceratheriid Paraceratherium grangeri, some rhinocerotids, and the chalicothere Schizotherium (fig. 11). The age of the “Upper White” at Erden Obo is considered late early Oligocene, as discussed above.\n\nOn the basis of the distribution of the general numbers of perissodactyls from the Erlian Basin from the early Eocene through the early Oligocene, we inferred that the changes in perissodactyl diversity that occurred over that time were in relation to coincedent paleoclimatic change (fig. 11). The biodiversity greatly increased during the Arshantan as compared to the early Bumbanian, which is probably attributable to the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO) (Zachos et al., 2001, 2008; Vandenberghe et al., 2012). Although global temperatures decreased after EECO, perissodactyls reached their greatest diversity in the Irdinmanhan. Alternatively, the underestimated diversity of perissodactyls in the Arshantan may account for its relatively lower diversity than in the Irdinmanhan. The gradual decrease in perissodactyl diversity from the middle Eocene Irdinmanhan to the late Eocene Ergilian likely can be attributed to the steady cooling trend of global temperature as indicated by a 7° C drop in deep-sea temperatures during the middle and late Eocene (Zachos et al., 2001; Prothero, 2006). In the early Oligocene Hsandogolian, the diversity of perissodactyls distinctly declined, and may be the result of the dramatic 5°–6° C drop in deep-sea temperatures across the Eocene-Oligocene boundary (Prothero, 2006). After the Eocene-Oligocene transition, the perissodactyl-dominant fauna in a warm, humid Eocene “greenhouse” was replaced by a rodent/lagomorph-dominant fauna in a dry, cold Oligocene “icehouse” (Meng and McKenna, 1998; Sun et al., 2014).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe clarify and discuss the temporal and spatial distributions of the dominant perissodactyl fossils from the Erlian Basin at the species level from the early Eocene to the early Oligocene, spanning about 26 million years. Over the past decade, our investigations in the Erlian Basin have resolved some long-standing problems, particularly in the Huheboerhe area, and have produced many new mammalian fossils, including perissodactyls from various localities and stratigraphic horizons. On the basis of this present paper, future study of these new materials may improve or alter our understanding of the evolutionary history of perissodactyls. Furthermore, although we propose a correlation of the fossiliferous sedimentary deposits at Erden Obo with other formations/faunas from type localities, evidence from our new discoveries of perissodactyls and other mammalian fossils may support or augment the present argument. Most importantly, the Eocene Asian Land Mammal Ages, which are based primarily on the faunas from the Erlian Basin, are in need of a more finely calibrated definition, subdivision, and intercontinental correlation that will be accomplished in future studies of the entire mammalian fauna and magnetostratigraphy."
