The one I seek... He granted me a joy that could have lasted for time eternal... And yet now, all that remains is sadness. ”\n\n— Aytel in Chapter 4: The Town of Freedom, Code: VFD.\n\n'Aytel' (アイテル, Aiteru) is a reoccuring character in the 7th Dragon series.\n\nProfile[]\n\n“ Sisters from the planet Hypnos that was destroyed by a True Dragon in a far-off galaxy. Upon the destruction of their planet, they took the form of spiritual entities and followed the dragons to Earth. Once they arrived, they passed on their wisdom to humankind and aided them in their own battle against the dragons. ”\n\n— Introduction from 7th Dragon III Code: VFD.\n\nAytel is a spiritual entity who was one of the survivors of the planet Hypnos, which was destroyed by dragons. She is the embodiment of Hypnos' love whereas Emel is the embodiment of Hypnos' hatred. They came to planet Earth to combat the dragons and prevent a similar tragedy from occurring.\n\nHer undying love and loyalty towards Takehaya is consistent throughout the series.\n\nHistory[]\n\n7th Dragon[]\n\n“ Seen sometimes near Gororan's House. I'm so jealous of that hair... she must have spent an eternity on it. Once upon a time, she had a lover she was all shmoopy with. It always goes wrong. ”\n\n— Arietta's intel.\n\nIf the player decides to visit the Kazan castle during the prologue, a conversation between Dohris and Aytel can be heard. She warned the president of the dragons' invasion and proposed countermeasures, which he accepted. She saved his soul and sealed it.\n\nHer first appearance was in Kazan after the dragon invasion and saved Dohris soul. She is a powerful mage. Like Emel, she's one of the survivors of Tokion and was trying to prevent the dragons invasion. She was also romantically involved with Takehaya during the war, having saved him from his wounds by keeping him sealed in the backroom of Masukami.\n\n7th Dragon 2020[]\n\nIn present day Tokyo, Aytel appears as one of Takehaya's followers in his youth group SKY and rarely leaves his side.\n\nWhen SKY is given shelter inside the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, Aytel also goes with them.\n\nWhen Emel arrives to the Murakumo base, it is later revealed that she and Aytel are the last survivors of their home planet, Hypnos, which was destroyed by the Dragons prior to Earth's invasion, several hundreds of years ago, and both Aytel and Emel came to Earth to search for people who could hunt dragons. Takehaya is a person who Aytel found during her search and someone she believed could hunt the dragons, which is why she followed and watched over him, hoping he would be the one who could hunt down all the Dragons.\n\nWhen Takehaya undergoes the experiment into a human Dragon like Natsume to gain enough power to stop the True Dragon Nyala, he disappears, and Aytel leaves to search for his whereabouts.\n\nTakehaya then reemerges at the top of the spatially warped Tokyo Tower stopping Unit 13 in their tracks for a battle to decide who is strong enough to defeat Nyala. When defeated, he deems Unit 13 worthy and lets them pass to fight the True Dragon. When Nyala is severely weakened by Unit 13's attacks, it is able to temporarily incapacitate Unit 13 with a magical explosion and is about to deal a finishing blow to them, Takehaya quickly flies in with his spear and attacks Nyala, averting its attention to him and shooting him down with its charged dragon breath that it was about to unleash on Unit 13. Takehaya, weakened, falls down from the Tower wondering to Aytel if he was able to become the hero she hoped he would be.\n\nIn the post-credits sequence, Aytel and Emel find Takehaya lying motionless on a deserted street in Tokyo.\n\nPost-main story (Chapter X), Aytel leaves a anonymous system message in Unit 13's My Room Terminal telling them to go to the peak of the Phantom Capital's Tokyo Tower, where they will find \"him\" (Takehaya) waiting for them to put his weakened body to rest.\n\n7th Dragon 2020-II[]\n\nIn 2020-II, several instances have been mentioned about \"a beautiful girl with long blue hair\", likely alluding to Aytel.\n\nIn the post-game, Aytel is the person to let Unit 13 in to The Illusory Capital. She, and a hooded Marina, tells the history of the dragon war.\n\n7th Dragon III Code: VFD[]\n\nEmel and Aytel are known by the ISDF and Nodens Company as they are recorded in history. Yoritomo and other characters that know of them often call the due \"the Hypnos Sisters\", referencing their origins.\n\nIn Code: VFD, Aytel appears as a transient spirit looking for her lover in the Ladyin ruins. Emel's hatred towards dragons spread to Aytel until she couldn't take it anymore, disappearing. In Preloma, Aytel protects Emel from Yuma's attack and then fuses with Emel to become the the 4th True Dragon, Hypnos. The two begs Unit 13 to kill them and set them free. After the deed is done, their spirits rest in peace and hope that Unit 13 will succeed in killing all dragons.\n\nIn-Game[]\n\n7th Dragon[]\n\nAfter you've cleared the sub-quest \"Pleroma, Masukami Heritage Place (マスカミ遺地)\", Aytel will award you with the legendary Mage weapon Caduceus (カドゥケウス).\n\nQuotes[]\n\n\"I still can't stop thinking about Takehaya. And my sister remains a hell-on-wheels of fury, hatred, and revenge. We're both living in a past more vivid than reality. But, we're watching you, humans of the present day. You inherited our war...\"\n\n— Aytel in 7th Dragon, after clearing the Hypnos sub-quest.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThere's a comedy scene featuring Aytel, Emel and Menas in the game. She also has her own comedy scene when she talks to a dragon in the ghost town.\n\nGallery[]\n\n[]\n\n7th Dragon 2020 Wiki\n\n7th Dragon III code:VFD Wiki\n\nNavigation[]"
