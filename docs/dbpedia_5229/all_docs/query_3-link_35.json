Climate Change and Gender Justice considers how gender issues are entwined with people’s vulnerability to the effects of climate change, and how gender identities and roles may affect women’s and men’s perceptions of the changes. The vivid case studies in this book show how women and men in developing countries are experiencing climate change and describe their efforts to adapt their ways of making a living to ensure survival, often against extraordinary odds. Contributors also examine how gender-equality concerns should be integrated into international negotiations and agreements on climate change mitigation and adaptation to ensure that new policies do not disadvantage poor women, but rather deliver them some benefits. ‘No climate justice without gender justice’; the rallying call by lobbyists at the 2007 UN Climate Change Conference in Bali continues to resonate as international negotiations on how to tackle and adapt to climate change become more urgent.\n\nSeries: Working in Gender & Development\n\nPublished: 2009\n\nPages: 224\n\neBook: 9781780440088\n\nPaperback: 9781853396939\n\nClimate change is often framed as a problem that needs mainly technical and economic solutions.
