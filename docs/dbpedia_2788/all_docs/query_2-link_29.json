        "text": "This is one of my all-time favorite films. It’s a very strange movie. Something of a mixture of spaghetti western, Tod Browning’s Freaks, Bunuel’s surreal films and epic bible movies.\n\nBut not really a spaghetti western…\n\nI’ve been dying to see this movie for a long time but cant seem to find It at my movie store. You should watch \" Midnight Movies: From the Margin to the Mainstream \" before you buy It to see If you like It. [url]http://imdb.com/title/tt0457414/[/url]\n\nIt comes on Encore sometimes.\n\n[quote=“Yodlaf Peterson, post:12, topic:45”]The only Jordovosky film i have seen so far is “SANTA SANGRE” wich i found bizzare but i did enjoy it.\n\nI do plan to get around to watching “EL TOPO”, ive heard that “THE HOLY MOUNTAIN” is supposed to be quite good aswell.[/quote]\n\nAnd Santa Sangre is his most normal film (well actually he did direct also Rainbow Thief and Tusk but these aren’t normally considered as a true “Jodo-films”). El Topo and especially The Holy Mountain are something which will really blow your mind. Full of violence, symbolism, surreal images and just loads of bizarre stuff. His first film Fando and Lis is wonderful too.\n\nToo bad that Jodorowsky haven’t made any more films since early 90’s. He’s been planning on making sequel to El Topo as well as some other movies too but I guess nobody’s willing to finance them.\n\n[quote=“Bill san Antonio, post:15, topic:45”]Check out this wonderful clip:\n\nHe has such a great stories. And I love his accent.\n\nOh, there might be some spoilers!!![/quote]\n\nWOW! these fillms look wicked!\n\ni will definately be getting the criterions when they come out ;D"
