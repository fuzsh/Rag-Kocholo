If you want me to love you, you need to become the best.

Initially an abused victim of the Colonel and his bandits, Mara becomes El Topo's love interest in the movie after she rescues him from the Colonel's clutches. However, as time went by, Mara suddenly became a corrupting influence for El Topo to commit undesirable acts so that he could win against the four sacred gun masters that lived in the desert using underhanded tactics in order to win Mara's heart.\n\nShe was portrayed by Mara Lorenzio.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nMara is a tall Caucasian woman with blue eyes, light-brown hair in a short, unkempt cut despite at some point, she also ponytails her hair in order to wear her Cowboy Hat. For clothing, she wears a variety of outfits throughout the movie (ranging from multi-piece clothing to dresses and at one point, a dark brown coat with a white shirt tucked inside of it), but trends found throughout her outfits include a somewhat common usage of darker colors and a black \"cowboy hat\".\n\nPersonality[]\n\nMara initially appears as an abused victim who is submissive towards the Colonel and his bandits during her time as a slave. This can be shown where she is powerless to fight against them and let the Colonel and his men do as they pleases such as raping her. Despite being an abused victim, Mara also has a seemingly strong mentality to a certain degree, able to endure the harassment of the Colonel's subordinates as she warns them that the Colonel will become angry and will kill them if they ever lay a finger on her.\n\nAfter El Topo liberates her from the evil colonel and his subordinates' clutches, Mara begins to develop a sense of happiness and joy for the first time after being liberated by El Topo and in addition, also forming a bond with El Topo during their journey in the desert. Despite this, as the time went by, Mara suddenly developed as a corrupting influence for El Topo trying to manipulate him to do heinous deeds. This is evidenced when she attempts to convince El Topo to defeat the four sacred gun-masters that lived in the desert, even convincing him to resort to underhanded tactics so that he could win Mara's heart. In addition, Mara also grows to become a sadist who loves to commit brutal violence once a power was given to her, evidenced with her relentlessly shooting the first gun master's subordinate without any remorse whatsoever. In the end, after seeing El Topo winning a battle against some of the gun-masters, she cheered alongside him and ordered El Topo to kill the remaining gun-masters so that he could win her heart.\n\nMara is also shown to be a possessive love interest with El Topo. This can be shown where she orders the nameless woman in black to go away from her and El Topo which led to a bloody duel where Mara was severely whipped by the woman. Despite this however, Mara and the woman began to form a bond together which causes her relationship with El Topo to be tested. In the end, Mara showed her treacherous side towards El Topo as evidenced where he became weak and desperate after defeating the four sacred gun-masters, Mara decided to shoot El Topo and left him for the Woman in Black as they rode together through the desert.\n\nBiography[]\n\nMara was introduced at first by taking the water in order to take care of the Colonel sleeping inside a Franciscan Monastery while at the same time, being harassed by the Colonel’s subordinates with dead lizards while saying that the Colonel is not a selfish person as he gave her towards them to become their plaything after the Colonel dresses her up. However, Mara decided to warn the subordinates about the Colonels about his impending wrath towards him as he has no hesitation to kill them if they touch her, which causes them to be scared. After taking the water for the Colonel, Mara then tries her best taking care of the Colonel only for him to repay Mara by abusing her in the end. Getting out from the monastery alongside several pigs, he then decides to shoot his subordinates that try to touch Mara as a form of intimidation which causes them to grovel towards him.\n\nAfter his subordinates became crazy, the Colonel commented that they had no soul because they were nothing but his playthings. In addition, he also orders the bandits to follow his instructions on raping Mara as a form of reward to entertain them when they are bored, otherwise, he would have no hesitation to kill them and it is heavily implied he had done this kind of behavior before, and even orders Mara to shows them her breasts and kiss them. In the end however, despite attempting to execute a depraved act towards Mara, the Colonel and his bandits were thwarted by El Topo and his naked son, Hijo, which resulted in Mara expressing her gratitude towards El Topo and decided to embark on a spiritual journey with him. However, this resulted in El Topo leaving Hijo to the hands of the monks that were used to being harassed by the Colonel’s subordinates.\n\nDuring their journey in the desert, El Topo and Mara decided to take a break together after they found an oasis. When Mara tries to drink the water from the oasis, she complains that the water tastes bitter. El Topo decided to use a tree as a sweetener for the water and tells Mara the story about Moses and his followers trying to find water in the desert only for the follower unable to drink said water because it tastes bitter. As a result, El Topo decided to give her name, Mara, because he reminded him of a bitter water. Continuing their journey, Mara asks El Topo if they could survive the desert’s harsh climate in which El Topo responded by finding a solution by digging through the desert to find a rock with one of them being an egg and then pray to god and then shoot a rock which emitted a water as the two drank said water together.\n\nDeciding to replicate El Topo’s similar method in order to find some water, Mara was unable to do so. This causes her to wander aimlessly and thinking that it was a futile effort until El Topo at one point decided to assault Mara by stripping her clothes, drowning her and putting her in so much pain. Despite the incident caused by El Topo, Mara ended up finding water in the desert under El Topo’s guidance and still formed a cordial relationship with him afterwards.\n\nHowever, despite their cordial relationship, Mara decided to ask El Topo if he loved her. When El Topo said yes, Mara decided to respond by saying she doesn’t love him. In order to win her heart, Mara then decided to encourage El Topo to be the best by defeating several four sacred gun-masters that lived in the desert. El Topo then responded by agreeing on Mara’s request and reminded Mara that they need to walk in circles as the desert itself is shaped like a circle. Continuing their journey to find the gun-masters, Mara shows her weak will as she pleads to El Topo so that they could go home due to their journey continuing for days, months and even years. Despite the pessimistic outlook, El Topo is still determined to look for them and tells Mara that some of the gun-masters will give them a signal to prove if they are worthy and also tells them that they had been waiting for them for so long. After the conversation, Mara then saw a signal sent by the first gun-master.\n\nMeeting with the first gun-master’s subordinates that consists of two crippled people with one of them having no hand and one having no feet get carried with a hand, the subordinates then tell El Topo that Mara should wait at the oasis besides a sand dune. After meeting with the first gun-master and was fazed towards the first gun-master’s feats, El Topo became hesitant on defeating him. However, Mara scolded him and ordered him to figure out the way to win against him, even persuading him to use underhanded tactics to do so. Due to this encouragement, El Topo managed to defeat the first gun-master. However, the first gun-master’s subordinates were then distraught about his death as they proceeded to attack both El Topo and Mara. In the end, Mara decided to laugh at their suffering and decided to sadistically kill them by shooting them. After managing to defeat the first gun-master, Mara then celebrates their incredible feat together with El Topo and persuades him to kill three more gun-masters.\n\nBefore tracking down the second gun-master, Mara and El Topo decided to take a break on the Oasis as Mara took a bath in a lake. However, during their break, they end up meeting with a mysterious woman in black with a man’s voice who decided to become a guide for them in order to find the second gun-master only if El Topo allowed her to go alongside them in which El Topo agreed. Before they departed, Mara and the woman in black bathed together as the latter decided to give Mara a mirror. This causes Mara to spin around, looking at her reflections and seemingly form a bond with the woman together despite having sex with El Topo in the desert. Seeing that Mara always keeps getting distracted by the mirror the mysterious woman gave, El Topo decided to shoot it in order to break the mirror. However, Mara decided to collect all the fragments of the mirror and give it to El Topo before encountering the second gun-master.\n\nAfter defeating the second gun-master, Mara then suddenly becomes possessive towards El Topo and tells the mysterious woman to go away from him. This resulted in them having a duel together by using a whip. In the end however, the mysterious woman manages to overpower Mara as she whips the latter several times, turning her into a pathetic wreck. However, the mysterious woman then decided to cure Mara by kissing her wounded back and also kissed Mara and hugged her in order to calm her down.\n\nAfter El Topo won the duel against the third gun-master, Mara decided to let El Topo groping her breasts as a form of celebration due to the fact that his hands were filled with the blood of the third gun-master. At the same time however, El Topo decided to leave Mara alone due to his growing regret on killing the gun-master. This resulted in Mara begging El Topo to not leave her and claiming that she could help El Topo defeat the final gun-master. Before meeting the final gun-master, the mysterious woman then eats a starfish-like fruit in a sexual manner as she gave the fruit to Mara so that she could eat. When Mara refuses to do so, the mysterious woman then decides to bandage Mara’s hands and kisses her. However, Mara decided to decline the prolonged kiss and still chooses El Topo in the end.\n\nDuring the duel with the final gun-master, the gun-master decides to kill himself and tells El Topo that he lost in the end. This resulted in El Topo sunk in the pit of regrets and decided to visit several places where he killed the gun-master where one of the corpses was set on fire alongside the dead bunnies, two of them were covered with a geometrical object and one of them swarming with bees. After seeing what happened, El Topo decided to cover his face with a beeswax and eat it out of regret and knock himself to a wall while crucifying a goat as he destroyed the building where the first gun-master lives and also destroyed his gun. After Mara congratulates El Topo on his victory, at first El Topo wants to punch Mara. However, he then decided to embrace her despite his bones become fragile, his body scattered like a water, having his heart turned into a candle that could easily melt, having his tongue stick in his jaws and also having him lying in the dust of death while also contemplating on why god had left him as he tried to commit suicide from the bridge.\n\nWhen trying to commit suicide, the mysterious woman then attempts to have a duel with El Topo in the bridge as she decided to shoot him several times, seemingly putting him out of his misery. However, El Topo still remains alive and encounters the woman in black standing in front of him as Mara was also watching the whole debacle. After having a duel with El Topo where he grew weaker, the mysterious woman then decided to make Mara make a decision between the two choices: her or El Topo. In the end, Mara decided to betray El Topo by shooting him, cue with Mara having sex together with the mysterious woman as they departed together to the desert as far away as possible while El Topo’s body was then found by several dwarves, disabled people and children.\n\nTrivia[]"
