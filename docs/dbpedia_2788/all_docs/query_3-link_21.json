        "text": "Causing a riot in its first screening at the Acapulco's Film Festival back in 1968 because of its surrealistic and blasphemous nature, Fando y Lis is the film that allowed Chilean director Alejandro Jodorowsky to become a cult director and to basically play with cinema. Instead of making a direct and faithful adaptation of a play of the Spanish writer and filmmaker Fernando Arrabal, Jodorowsky decided to resort to his own memories and add a high dose of bizarre imagery, surreal sequences and impossible, unexplainable events.\n\nThe first feature length film of this visionary director focuses on Fando and his partially paralyzed lover Lis who decide to look for the mythical city of Tar, a place that supposedly grants eternal…\n\nI had heard that Alejandro Jodorowsky makes some weird and confusing movies but I couldn’t possibly prepare myself for this.\n\nThe movie is very experimental and none of it really made much sense to me, but it had a unique and confusing style and was overall very well made. It had scenes with nudity, violence and absurd stuff that I can’t even describe and the movie overall just felt like a crazy dream.\n\nThe actors did all kind of crazy stuff and they all did a good job with both the fun and uncomfortable scenes.\n\nA part of me wants to rate the movie higher, since it really feels like a masterpiece, but it had some slow moments and the…\n\nCalling Jodorowsky's feature debut a hellishly insane, violently expressive piece of post-apocalyptic surrealism is kinda funny. Not Buñuel funny, he's much darker and way more cynical with a head full of acid. But funny in the sense that this film, while coming nowhere close to the spaghetti-acid vibes of EL TOPO or the mind-melting psychedelia of THE HOLY MOUNTAIN, still manages to be enormously visceral, seductive, and spiritually provocative. As a first feature, this level of dark, dark imagination is super impressive. Still haven't been able to shake it for the last 2 weeks.\n\nShot in sumptuous, high-contrast black-and-white, Jodorowsky combines allegory with surreal, mind-blowing imagery that dislodges coherent narrative structure, assaults the senses, decries societal hypocrisy, and feels in…\n\n“To advance a mile, we only have to take a step. If Tar doesn’t exist, we can invent it.”\n\nIt’s pretty insane (and downright impressive) that Jodorowsky’s feature debut was the one film of his that resulted in riots not only at the premiere, but also the subsequent screenings in the weeks that followed. Before long he was pretty much shunned by every Mexican newspaper and almost got deported, which only escalated the status of his notoriety as one of the darkest and most unconventionally creative artists of his time.\n\nFando y Lis is just as hypnotizing and haunting as Jodorowsky’s later works. It’s the sights and sounds of a surrealistic journey of two characters, Fando and Lis; Lis being…\n\nI understand that this is one of Jodorowsky's earlier works, and it's really only just a preview of what was to come, but this doesn't really hold a candle to his films like \"The Holy Mountain\" or \"El Topo.\"\n\nI can also understand that his budget was a lot more limited on this one as well, so he didn't exactly have the opportunity to go as bizarre and grand as he probably wanted to. My main issue with \"Fando and Lis\" is that a lot of it feels incredibly meaningless and empty. Take Jodorowsky's other works, for example: they're insane and weird as hell, sure, but they all feel like they're that way for a reason. There's always some symbolism…"
