        "text": "A mind-blowing 'acid-western' which shocked and bedazzled audiences upon its controversial original release, El Topo single-handedly invented the American midnight movie phenomenon.\n\nJodorowsky's most violent and notorious film sees the director play \"The Mole\" of the title: a black-clad, master-gunfighter. In the first half, El Topo journeys across a desert dreamscape with his young son (Brontis Jodorowsky) to duel with four sharp-shooting Zen masters, who each bestow a Great Lesson before they die. In the second half, El Topo becomes the guru of the subterranean tribe of deformed outcasts who he must liberate from depraved cultists in a neighbouring town.\n\nA counterculture masterpiece which ingeniously combines iconic Americana symbolism with Jodorowsky's own idiosyncratic surrealist aesthetic. El Topo is an incredible journey through nightmarish violence, mind-blowing mysticism and awe-inspiring imagery. This era-defining film is now presented in a stunning new 4K restoration with a wealth of newly produced and archival extras."
