        "text": "List Item: Watch all of the “1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die”\n\nProgress: 763/1007Title: El Topo\n\nDirector: Alejandro Jodorowsky\n\nYear: 1970\n\nCountry: Mexico\n\nAlejandro Jodorowsky is one of those rare people whose works have crossed between two 1001 lists in different media fields. His is a name that I recognised because, a while ago, I read his graphic novel series The Incal as part of the 1001 comics list. I really enjoyed the surreal nature of those stories and had high hopes for what he would bring as a film writer/director.\n\nIn terms of surrealness, I have to say that El Topo delivered. The fact that people like David Lynch and suda51 are fans make complete sense. Wouldn’t be surprised if Lars Von Trier likes this film as well, but I haven’t been able to find a reference to that. I mean, El Topo is pretty much the type of film that you would expect when you hear that it’s part of the ‘acid western’ genre that grew out of a weird marriage of westerns and the counter-culture.\n\nThe issue that I have with El Topo, however, is how sometimes the surreal nature of it gets in the way of a narrative framework. Our character ends up from being a gun-slinging soldier of fortune in the beginning to a man dedicating the latter part of his life to releasing a community of inbred and disabled people from their captivity inside a mountain. The second arc that unites these two very different films, where he defeats four notable gunslingers only to be left for dead by his… I’m gonna go with girlfriend… just didn’t sit with me. Honestly, it connected with me so little that I fell asleep. Things managed to pick up again in the final section with the death cult town and he mountain full of unfortunates, but it had lost a bunch of brownie points with me by that point.\n\nEven if there were some story issues, there is no denying Jodorowsky’s directing ability and the ability of his cinematographer Raphael Corkidi. Even when the plot was boring me to literal sleep, I couldn’t deny the beauty of this film. I do, however, think he blew his set-making load a bit too early when we see him wandering through a town whose residents were massacred. It just set the bar too high for shot-making, a bar that would have been ridiculously hard to clear again.\n\nDespite the middle arc not sitting well with me, I am still happy to have experienced El Topo. I think, one day, this would make for a great indie game (although, they would need to find a more politically correct way to deal with all the physically disabled characters… and maybe completely remove the slave branding scene), but for now I can just find ways to bring that weirdness into my own long-running Red Dead Redemption 2 game."
