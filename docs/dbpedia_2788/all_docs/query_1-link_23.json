        "text": "* * *\n\nJodorowsky?” says Manuel Acevas, the editor of Mexico‘s only underground newspaper, Piedra Rodante. “He is an enemy of the culture. He is completely against drugs, with a narc mentality. Before his concern was only with the bourgeoisie and scaring them, he was a petit-bourgeois. Now since El Topo it is the hippies. He is a petit-hippie.\n\n“The man is a reep-off. Money, and more money is all he wants. You have seen the house he lives in. He buy it with the money from El Topo. He is a man of talents, unquestionably, a genius, but his ego is so great, it destroys.” Manuel reaches into his desk and takes out a cartoon. “Maybe we run this soon.” The cartoon shows a Mexican actress naked save for a copy of “Panic Fables” (Alexandro’s Sunday comic strip) covering her crotch. She reaches out a hand to Alexandro who stands, holding a bag of money in one hand, saying, “What an uncomfortable position,” one of the famous lines from his cartoons. On the other side of him sits a bearded guru, who says, “My son, Zen Buddhism and Brahmanism are the way to Saint Dollar.”\n\nTrending\n\n“You do not have to believe me,” Manuel says. “Go and speak to Grace. You know her. Paula Roma is her stage name. She play the lesbian in El Topo. He wanted her for this one too but she say no. You go speak to her.”\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nLace curtains cover the windows and fringed cloths the lamps in Grace’s ground floor apartment. Although it is the middle of the afternoon, two candles, one red, one blue, burn by two sticks of incense. Grace comes rushing in, sits down, and extracts a tightly rolled joint from a silver cigarette case. She speaks rapidly, rushing from story to story, eager for any gossip she doesn’t already know. “Ah, Alexandro,” she sighs. “I love him so much…when he is not working. When he come over, we are like two women chattering blah-blah-blah about everything. He say he want me in thees peecture. He say, ‘Eet ees a small part.’ So what? ‘Is not much money,’ he say. So what. He say, ‘You have to shave your head.’ ‘So what,’ I say. ‘For you, I shave everything.’\n\n“But then I talk to my friends, and they say eet ees not enough money and eet ees another lesbian, so I say no. But steel, Alexandro he want to be God. And I say to heem, ‘Fuck you. There ees no God.’ You are God and I am, and you are a piece of shit also. And so am I.”\n\nGrace stubs some ash off her joint against the bottom of the ashtray. She takes a brush out of her pocketbook and begins to rearrange her hair. It’s color she doesn’t like. The candles flicker the highlights in her Aries eyes. “Alexandro tell me people are taking so much drugs these days, they weel see another vision of the Virgin of Guadelupe. He is crazee, no? Always he want to be reech and famous and now he will be, I think. I am glad for him, I love him so much.” She bends her head to get a light off the candle. Then why, she is asked, if all he wants is to be rich and famous, is he so involved with spiritual matters, with communal living, with losing his ego.\n\nShe pauses for a moment, then inhales on the joint. “Because he has found a way to be God, and to be commercial too. Is perfect no?”\n\n* * *\n\nOn one of the last days of shooting in the marketplace, a sideshow stage was set up with a diorama-like representation of the Aztec pyramids. Barkers dressed as clowns spieled up and down underneath a banner that read “Grand Circus of Frogs and Chameleons. Today: The Conquest of Mexico.” The wardrobe lady had been up at four to begin dressing frogs as Conquistadors and lizards as Aztec Indians, replete with tiny purple plumes that fanned out over their sun god faces. The frogs were wheeled around in wooden wagons that were supposed to be Spanish galleons but looked more like caskets. Inside them, frogs were dying slowly from exposure. The same thing had happened during El Topo, with the ring of rabbits. It was supposed to be a ring of live rabbits until one by one, they were killed by the sun.\n\nBurt Kleiner looked around the set and shook his head in wonder. “With Alexandro,” he said, “you don’t have to be an actor. We’re all just his straw dogs.”\n\nThe next day, the pyramids were blown up, killing all the frogs and lizards that were still alive. “Did you see it?” Richard Rutowsky said. “Alexandro was up on this ladder with a wash basin full of blood, pouring it on the frogs and he slipped and it got in his hair and on his clothes. After it was over, I said, ‘You’re insane, you know?’ ‘Why you say that?’ he said. ‘Look around,’ I said. ‘The camera’s covered in black, you’re full of blood, the frogs are laying in the ruins smoldering. You’re a mass murderer.’ He just looked at me and said, ‘The Spanish did worse to the Indians.’\n\nRelated\n\n“Being in this film, man, is like watching a member of your own family go through changes. A year ago Alexandro was a total egomaniac. Right now, he’s in a scary place, for sure. Big money, big contracts, but give him a chance, just sit back and watch him …\n\n“See, the church isn’t there anymore inside one building. It’s anywhere you can get people to listen. That’s why this film is so far out…and him too. He’s a special person.”\n\n* * *\n\nMemo From Mexico City\n\nThe script for The Holy Mountain ends with this paragraph:\n\n“Instead of the conventional ‘The End’, the following text will appear … ‘You can write to me: Alexandro Jodorowsky, Apartado Postal Numero, Mexico City, D.F. Mexico.”"
