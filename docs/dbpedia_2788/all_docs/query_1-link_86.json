        "text": "So a relatively short post here today, mainly just to share a couple of thoughts I had. I was at my usual haunt last night – the BFI Southbank (some of you who read these posts might be detecting a running theme!) – seeing Chilean director Alexandro Jodorowsky’s midnight movie classic – the ultraviolet surrealist western El Topo (1970) currently showing as part of the BFI’s Punk Cinema season and in which a black leatherclad Gunslinger and (initially) his son (or so we are led to believe) cross a bleak, unforgiving (frequently Beckettian) landscape in search of enlightenment, four extrovert gunfighters and their ‘Colonel’ in order to avenge the bloody massacre of a Mexican village. This constitutes roughly the first third of the film and it was at the end of this section the distinct similarities between Jodorowsky’s film and AMC’s mega hit The Walking Dead (TWD) began to strike me.\n\nOk, so TWD is a modern tv drama about the human fallout of a zombie apocalypse rooted in the comic book tradition and far from the high art/modernist/countrtcultural/avant garde traditions that are the foundations of Jodorowsky’s film; El Topo is a film that defies easy categorisation : exploitation, high art, a genre film – western, horror, surrealism, part samurai film, slapstick comedy, religious drama in which its director happily crams in old and New Testament Christianity, Buddhism and Taoism, pagan worship and Nietschiean philosophy as well as Beckettian and Artaudian existentialism, absurdism and cruelty (to name but a few) .\n\nAt the outset the similarities between the two texts seem minimal, however looking a bit further gives cause to rethink. First of all, let’s consider TWD’s two central characters, ex Sherrif Rick Grimes and his son Carl who travel a desolate wasteland in a picaresque fashion. Carl dons Rick’s wide brimmed Sherrif’s hat and in the wake of the death of his mother must learn to put away childish things. At the start of El Topo The Gunslinger (El Topo – the Mole – in the opening titles we see the mole claws his way to the surface in search of light only to have his eyes burned by it) makes his young son bury his first toy and a picture of the mother in the sand, symbolically burying the images of childhood. Shortly after as they travel through the charnel horror of the village massacre (huge pools of blood, men hanging like meat in a barn, bodies strewn across the ground, disemboweled and decaying animals), The Gunslinger hands his son the gun in order to finish off a dying man, completing both his journey to manhood and the facilitating the ellipses of the narrative which becomes apparent at the end when, after reuniting with his father (who has become akin to a Buddhist monk and who self0immolates in the manner of those monks in Vietnam who set themselves alight in protest) dons the black leather garb from the first half of the film and rides off into the sunset with his father’s woman and baby son in tow. In TWD young Carl Grimes undergoes a similar experience / right of passage in putting down the undead body of his father’s best friend Shane.\n\nIn terms of imagery there is also a striking similarity between Carl and the Gunslinger’s son – they both sport wide brimmed hats and (eventually) don the mantle of the father (literally and metaphorically).\n\nRick is also a gunslinger and, in fact, guns play a vital role in TWD (their obvious role as defense against the undead hordes not withstanding) – they tie the film to range of genre conventions, not least the Western where guns are used to forge a path through a new land and defend frontiers – weapons are part of the identity of individual characters – they denote Rick’s authority as father, law keeper, maker and enforcer and (in the opinion of this writer) tie the show to the somewhat problematic idea that guns can be justified to preserve or create a civilised society ( the uncivilised eschew the use of guns – opting instead to be head or utilise barbed wire covered baseball bats – with the exception of Michonne’s katanas ). Hence TWD, pursues a fairly conservative agenda.\n\nRick is also a grizzled, bearded gunslinger in a desolate blood drenched wasteland, a warrior who travels with son in tow, a son who adopts the identity of the father. While TWD may lack the fevered religion, searched for enlightenment and zen / spirituality of El Topo (in which in one scene towards the end of the film a church congregation worship the gun through a game a Russian Roulette – it’s an object of religious fetishisation),\n\nHowever Rick’s and the Gunslinger’s journey are not dissimilar – despite the casts of exotic characters both remain isolated in the wasted landscape. Both his and the Gunslinger’s personas and their father/son relations ships may also be filtered through the samurai / ronin tradition (samurai swords play a significant role in both texts) and parallels may be made between both and the Babycart mythos. There is no discernable end to their journeys, they are cyclical, destined to be continued by the sons.\n\nSo just to conclude this brief collection of thoughts, if we make the argument that El Topo is an unsung forbear of TWD then can we make the argument that the series exceeds its comic book origins by engaging the traditions of serious art as well as exploitation cinema? It’s also worth noting that towards the end of El Topo when the cripples, dwarves, inbreds and deformed characters are freed from their subterranean prison by the gunslinger (now monk/beggar) they career down the town’s street as horde of undead-like characters (here the film knowingly engages the emergent zombie genre/exploitation cinema of the late 1960s).\n\nAnyway just a few thoughts which I aim to develop.\n\nHere is the link to the BFI Punk Season"
