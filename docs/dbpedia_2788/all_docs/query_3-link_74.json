Listen to a funny monologue and learn how the Fourth of July was celebrated at the Pun’kin Center back in 1915 or learn more about the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson and other Americana.\n\nBelow you will find a list of 5 songs and albums for you to share and enjoy this year with family and friends.\n\nFourth of July at Pun’kin Center by Cal Stewart and Steve Porter\n\nSpirit of Independence March by Conway’s Band\n\nThe Liberty Tree by The Sand Pipers & Mitch Miller and Orchestra\n\nOur American Heritage Album by Wesley Addy\n\nAmerican Patriotic & Marching Songs by Various Artists\n\nPlease note, due to copyright some of these recordings may only play for 45 second snippet to give the user a taste of what this music sounded like back in the day, if you are interested in full access considering applying for Research Station Access.

Look no further, the Recorded Sound Archives has a collection of over 40 recordings for you to choose from and share and enjoy with your family.\n\nIncluded in this collection is a mixture of cantors, and other musicians such as Leibele Waldman, Gershon Sirota , Moishe Oysher, Shimon and Ilana Gewirtz, Ramon Tasat and Cindy Paley.\n\nClick here to view this collection.\n\nClick here to view past blog posts on the High Holy Days.\n\nPassover marks the liberation of the Israelites from 400 years of slavery in ancient Egypt. Moses tried to convince Pharaoh to let the Israelites go free with words and demonstrations of God’s AWESOME power.\n\nWhen Pharaoh wouldn’t concede, Moses proceeded to bring about the 10 plagues.\n\nYou can read more about the plagues, here.\n\nThe 10th plague, the death of every Egyptian first born including Pharaoh’s young son, was too much for Pharaoh and he finally let them go. God instructed the Israelites to mark their doorposts with the blood of a slaughtered lamb so that he would know to pass over those homes. This is where the name Passover comes from (Exodus 12:11-13). There are actually three other names for this holiday: Holiday of Matzot, Holiday of Freedom, and Holiday of Spring. But on this holiday, we celebrate the gift of freedom, remember Jewish history through special Seder foods and teach the lessons of the Haggadah (The Telling) to the next generation.\n\nAnd this year, the Recorded Sound Archives invites you to add music and song to your family’s Passover traditions and has put together a collection of over 40 recordings for you to enjoy with family and friends this Passover.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nPURIM, which, in English, means [drawing] LOTS, is about the book of Esther which is also known in Hebrew as Megillah (the Scroll). It is a book in the third section of Ketuvim (Writings) of the Jewish Tanakh (Hebrew Bible). It relates to the story of a Hebrew girl in Persia, born as Hadassah but known as Esther (niece of Mordechai), who becomes Queen of Persia and thwarts the genocide of her people by the wicked Haman, a high official in the court of King Achashverosh.\n\nHaman sought to annihilate all the Jews, Mordechai’s people, throughout King Achashverosh’s’ entire kingdom. For Haman plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and he cast a “pur”, which is a LOT, to shatter and destroy them. For this reason, they call these days “Purim,” after the pur.\n\nThe story forms the core of the Jewish festival of Purim, during which it is read aloud twice: once in the evening and again the following morning. A Purim party often takes place during this time where children dress up in costumes usually relevant to the story of Purim. It’s a fun time for everyone including adults!\n\nHere at the Recorded Sound Archives, we have put together a collection of over 20 recordings for you to enjoy with family and friends this Purim.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nDid you know the Recorded Sound Archives at FAU Libraries has over 49,000 albums along with over 150,000 songs in its databases, which is growing everyday with the help of volunteers?

(the largest Conservative synagogue in New England) his talent and energy have made him a stand-out performer.

His repertoire includes Cantorial, Israeli, Yiddish, and Ladino, as well as opera and Broadway selections. True to his Argentinean roots, he also enjoys singing Tango. At the Cantors Assembly Convention in 2002 he was asked to sing the memorial prayer at the Holocaust Museum in Washington DC.\n\nYou can visit his YouTube channel to see live performances.\n\nThe Judaica Sound Archives is proud to include these four wonderful recordings by Cantor Rosemberg.
