        "text": "In September, on the day of the Paris premiere of “The Dance of Reality,” his first movie in 23 years, Alejandro Jodorowsky, the Chilean-born filmmaker, learned that he was now an asteroid — 261690 Jodorowsky — as the International Astronomical Union had named a three-mile-wide chunk of rock orbiting between Mars and Jupiter. For a man whose life has been defined by cosmic ambitions, the honor seemed almost expected.\n\nJodorowsky is now 85, but he remains spry and intense. I visited him two days after the premiere in his professorial apartment near the Place de la Bastille, a book-and-plant-filled domain he shares with his third wife, Pascale Montandon-Jodorowsky, who is 43 years his junior. He’d spent the day writing poetry and, in his role as a spiritual guru, tweeting tarot-card readings and “psychomagical” advice to his nearly one million followers. “My son Adan told me: ‘Look, this is the literature of the future. They answer you, they argue. If they’re not interested, they delete you. They steal from you, it’s something alive!’ ”\n\nJodorowsky was already thinking about his next film project. “When I’m not creating something, I get bored, I despair,” he said. From a poster on the wall behind his desk stared a younger, wild-eyed and frizzy-haired version of Jodorowsky as the black-leather-clad gunfighter with no name who is reborn as a kind of avenging Buddha in his 1970 cult classic, “El Topo.”\n\nWritten, directed, scored by and starring Jodorowsky, “El Topo” was an ultraviolent Western with a potent mix of Eastern spirituality and European art house surrealism. For six months, beginning on Dec. 18, 1970, it played once a day at the Elgin Cinema in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood, at midnight (1 a.m. on Friday and Saturday) — selling out virtually all its screenings and attracting a heady crowd of hippie-intellectual royalty. Dennis Hopper saw “El Topo,” loved it and recruited Jodorowsky to recut his next film. John Lennon saw it, returned several times and persuaded his manager, Allen Klein, to buy the distribution rights. Reviewers squabbled. The New York Times’s chief film critic, Vincent Canby, dismissed “El Topo” as a garish con, calling it a “rather grotesque, ego-salving San Simeon.” Another Times critic, Peter Schjeldahl, celebrated the film as “a vastly complex, genuinely profound comic allegory — a sort of bloody Latin American ‘Peer Gynt.’ ” Ken Rudolph from The Los Angeles Free Press was more to the point, calling “El Topo” “the greatest film ever made.” Jodorowsky had his own take: “If you are great, ‘El Topo’ is a great picture. If you are limited, ‘El Topo’ is limited.”\n\nIn the decades after the fabled run of “El Topo,” for which Jodorowsky was christened the “father of the midnight movie,” he faded in and out of the American cultural consciousness. After making his even more surreal follow-up, “The Holy Mountain” (with gender-bending actors he found at Max’s Kansas City in New York), Jodorowsky had a falling out with his backer, Klein, leading to a three-decade embargo on his two most famous films. During those years, he completed only three more movies: two less personal features that he disowned and one masterful Mexican horror parable, “Santa Sangre.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
