His work engages with issues arising from peering into the archive and imagining the power of “lost” forms of expression to articulate keenly felt needs in the present. Both his music performance and scholarship gravitate towards the Jewish liturgical music and Yiddish expressive culture of the early 20th century and the reverberations of this cultural moment in present day artistic and religious communities. Jeremiah’s research considers the work of cantors as arbiters of social, intellectual and aesthetic change in times of crisis and cultural transformation. Jeremiah is a current Fellow at the Katz Center Fellow for Advanced Judaic Research at the University of Pennsylvania. His first book, Golden Ages: Hasidic singers and cantorial revival in the digital era, will be published by University of California Press in 2024.\n\nJeremiah received his PhD from the Stanford University Graduate School of Education Concentration in Education and Jewish Studies in 2021.

He was a 2022-23 Yale Institute of Sacred Music Fellow, where he conducted research on the khazente phenomenon of popular women performers of cantorial music in the early 20th century and composed a new piece of music, titled In der vayber shul/In the Women’s Synagogue that offered a creative response to this fecund moment in Jewish musical history and premiered at Yale on April 1, 2023.
