        "text": "November 1 at 6:00 pm | Alejandro Jodorowsky in Person!\n\nStandby only: Tickets may become available to the standby line prior to showtime.\n\nA fascinating collision of Sixties avant-garde theater, Latin American symbolism, European radical cinema and the furthest reaches of the movie western, El Topo chronicles the exploits of a master gunfighter and cosmic mystic (played by director Jodorowsky himself) as he sets out to do battle with four sinister, sharp-shooting rivals.\n\nJohn Lennon himself declared the film a masterpiece, and the rest was history: Jodorowsky’s film became an international cult classic and was one of the key works to establish the concept of the “midnight movie.” Now lovingly restored, El Topo feels no less provocative than when first released, but today also evidences a kind of multicultural fusion that puts it far ahead of its time. (Alejandro Jodorowsky, Spain/Mexico, 1970; 125m)\n\nFollowed by a conversation with Alejandro Jodorowsky and Film Society of Lincoln Center Program Director Richard Peña!"
