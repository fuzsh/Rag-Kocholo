        "text": "I saw this in the Irish Film Institute as part of a season of films by Alejandro Jodorowsky. Because I had not been overly enamoured of the last one, Fando y Lis, I had some concerns about this one, which has been described as an Acid Western.\n\nIt goes through three phases, with the first most conforming to Western tropes, particularly those of the Spaghetti Western. That sees the eponymous El Topo, a black clad gunman played by Jodorowsky himself, travelling a desert landscape with his sun to hunt down and kill some bad guys who have massacred a load of unfortunate villagers. You could probably have got an entire film out of that premise, but it is just a prelude, for after killing all the bad guys, El Topo embarks on a new mission, to kill the four greatest gunmen in the world. However, instead of leading to a series of gun battles, this instead assumes the character of a mystical quest, with the gunmen representing different philosophical approaches. And although El Topo triumphs, he does so not in a series of shoot-outs but by subterfuge, only to then be betrayed himself and left for dead.\n\nThe film could profitably have ended there, but instead we find ourselves in the third phase. El Topo awakes after spending years unconscious being tended to by a race of troglodyte mutants. It is perhaps at this point that the significance of the eponymous character’s name become significant (as Topo is Spanish for mole). He resolves to help the mutants leave their cave and join the people of a nearby Wild West town, and is able to exit the cave with a dwarf woman, with whom he starts trying to raise money to buy explosives so that he can blast open the cave and free the mutants. But sadly things all go wrong and we are left thinking that maybe some kind of metaphorical event may have just occurred.\n\nThe film is very impressive visually and the move to colour from the monochrome of Fando y Lis suits Jodorowsky. However it is a bit incoherent and it does go on a bit (fact check – it is in fact a short 66 minutes… it just feels like it goes on a bit). To paraphrase Samuel Johnson, it is perhaps worth seeing but not worth going to see. Nevertheless, it is memorable and entirely unlike anything being made for the cinema today. And it might also repay a second viewing.\n\nimage source:\n\nEl Topo and son (Empire: El Topo review)"
