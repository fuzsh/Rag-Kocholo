        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Goliath would come off the bench for the Lakers.\n\nThe Los Angeles low post is led by 7-footers Pau Gasol and Andrew Bynum. In a Jan. 1 game at the Pepsi Center, Bynum had 18 points and 16 rebounds against the Nuggets and probably was disappointed he didn’t score more.\n\nGasol can give any team fits, but if the Nuggets can’t slow Bynum, this first-round Western Conference playoff series might not be much of a series. Consider that Bynum, arguably the best center in the NBA at age 24, has played his best basketball against the Nuggets. In four games against them this season — three won by the Lakers — Bynum averaged 24.8 points and 11.8 rebounds and shot 66.1 percent from the field.\n\nSo, how do the Nuggets stop Bynum?\n\n“Hopefully by double-teaming him and frustrating him,” forward Al Harrington said Saturday as his 38-28, sixth-seeded Nuggets prepared for today’s Game 1 in the best-of-seven series. “Obviously you can’t let him play one-on-one, he’s too good for that now, and he’s become a better passer. So you just try to … keep him off balance. The key is him not knowing who’s going to double-team him.”\n\nThe Nuggets have tried double-team (and triple-team) defenses against Bynum, including the April 13 game at the Staples Center when Bynum’s 30 points helped the Lakers win 103-97. But as the Nuggets’ coaching staff strategized for this series, outside-the-box ways to slow Bynum were debated.\n\n“We’ve actually talked about, in a crazy way — you can’t do it, but what if our center position was like hockey?” Nuggets coach George Karl said. “Four- or five-minute stints, just run, run, run, run. Next guy, run, run, run, run. Because I know Bynum and Gasol don’t want to run, run, run, run for 48 minutes. We can’t do that probably, but we actually talked about instead of playing guys 10 minutes (each), shortening it to six, seven minutes.”\n\nLook for Karl to substitute often and use plenty of fouls from his big men. The Nuggets have a stable of bigs to throw at Bynum. Kosta Koufos will start at center today, alongside rookie power forward Kenneth Faried. On the bench are Harrington, JaVale McGee, Timofey Mozgov and — maybe, if Karl gets desperate — seldom-used center Chris Andersen.\n\nWho is the Nuggets’ best defensive player vs. Bynum? “I couldn’t pick,” Karl said, “but we’ll find him. We’re going to have to do team concepts with double-teams.”\n\nMozgov has shown some stints of prowess against the powerful Lakers center. But it’s been a roller-coaster season for the Russian, who began the season as a starting center and ended it on the bench.\n\n“There was a period of time this season where he didn’t look good. He hurt his ankle, came back, and I think he was still hurt, even though he said he wasn’t,” Karl said. “He didn’t have his confidence and bounce. About two or three weeks ago in practice, I started seeing him playing better. But so was Kosta. It’s one of those situations that as long as Kosta kept improving and being solid, (he would be the starter). Timo is fine; he’s going to be very good for us. If Kosta doesn’t play well, I will give Timo an opportunity.”\n\nFaried will be playing in his first playoff series but can change a game with his offensive rebounding and jaw-dropping dunks. McGee also is capable of playing well, having scored 19 and 17 points in two of Denver’s last three games.\n\n“What I’ve seen in the last six or seven games is, he’s been pretty consistent,” Karl said of McGee. “When he first got to Denver he was lost a little bit, forced some issues, had some habits we had to change. But recently, with the second unit, there’s a chemistry going there with Andre Miller, Al Harrington and the others.”\n\nWhether it’s Andrew Bynum or Andrew Goudelock, if the Nuggets are going to slow the Lakers’ frontline, it’s going to take all of the Nuggets. Denver’s team defense has improved lately, Karl said, but the Nuggets allowed an average of 101.2 points per game this season, near the worst in the NBA.\n\nAs for Bynum, even the point guards are important in making the defense work.\n\n“Pressuring the ball, making it hard for him to get an easy catch,” said the Nuggets’ Ty Lawson said. “Making sure it’s not a straight pass — more of a lob pass — and basically just helping out. It’s going to be big for us to go down and double him, poke and prod and make sure he’s not in his good rhythm.”\n\nBenjamin Hochman: 303-954-1294 or bhochman@denverpost.com"
