        "text": "Josh Powell on the misconception that was around Andrew Bynum and if was really interested in basketball at all: “It might’ve seemed like that. I think that other factors had something to do with people’s perception of him and I mean, you gotta think, right? My number could be slightly off but, he went before he tore his meniscus he was on a stretch for like, six or seven weeks I think in limited time because I don’t think he was getting 30 minutes a game… but that man was averaging I want to say between 22 and 25 points per game and 13 rebounds. Remember the game that he had 42 on the Clippers? It was like, ever since that game something clicked and he just went on a tear. Andrew was always talented. He had a big body and had great footwork, great hands and he was super young but he had a good feel for the game on the defensive end; he had a big presence, he could guard, he could block and alter shots… like there so many things that he could do on both ends.”\n\nPippen also joins current Golden State Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson in giving their support for the Kings, after the pair shared their own videos earlier in the series. Again, Curry and Thompson may be diehard Kings fans, but they are also former teammates of Andrew Bogut – part of the team’s ownership group – as well as current Kings import Ian Clark, both of whom were part of the Warriors’ championship dynasty from 2015-2017. Others who have shared their support for the Kings include former Kings players who are now in the NBA – Didi Louzada and Jae’Sean Tate – as well as former Kings coach Will Weaver, former NBA lottery pick Thon Maker, Sydney Swans player Jake Lloyd, and Super Netball team the NSW Swifts.\n\nBefore the Lakers’ game against the Dallas Mavericks on Jan. 28, 1997, Bryant decided to take a nap. “I was excited,” the then-rookie told The San Bernardino County Sun. “I was thinking about it and visualizing it. It helped me go to sleep.” Twenty-five years ago, at 18 years, 5 months and 5 days old, Bryant became the youngest player to start an NBA game, a record that still holds. He replaced former Atlanta Hawks small forward Bill Willoughby, who previously set the record during the 1975-76 season, in the record books when he stepped on the court at Reunion Arena. Bryant’s former teammate and Laker Andrew Bynum is the youngest player to play in an NBA game, a record he set when he came off the bench at 18 years and 6 days old.\n\nThe two best centers when it comes to defending without fouling are Al Horford and Vucevic, and that has been the case each of the last few years. This season so far, Vucevic is averaging just 1.7 fouls per game, which for someone who plays as many minutes as he does in a starting role is not only rare, it’s potentially historic. Only two centers all time have started in at least 60 games, averaged a minimum of 33 minutes of playing time a night and committed 1.7 fouls per game or less, per Stathead. They are Mike Gminski, who in 1988-89 with the Sixers averaged 1.7 fouls and 33.4 minutes with 82 starts, and Bynum, who in 2011-12 with the Lakers averaged 1.7 fouls and 35.2 minutes with 60 starts."
