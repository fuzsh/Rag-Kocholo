        "text": "Just five years ago, Andrew Bynum seemed to have one of the brightest futures in the NBA. According to ESPN, he was the 30th best player in all of the league. And then, suddenly, he disappeared.\n\nBynum made the All-Star team in his final campaign with the Lakers -- the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season, which was his seventh in the NBA. At just 26, his value remained sky-high. Which is why the Philadelphia 76ers traded for him in the megadeal that landed Dwight Howard in Los Angeles.\n\nBut Bynum would famously fail to suit up for the 76ers. Knee issues sidelined him all year long -- in a season that featured more wonkyhairstyles and unfortunate bowling accidents than minutes on the floor.\n\nSEE ALSO: Where has Marshall Henderson been since leaving Ole Miss?\n\nBynum signed as a free agent with the desperate Cleveland Cavaliers the next offseason -- while LeBron James was still a member of the Miami Heat -- and played just 24 games with them before getting traded to the Chicago Bulls and immediately released.\n\nThe highlight (or, rather, lowlight) of his Cavs tenure came after it ended -- in February, when it was reported that, during Cleveland practices, Bynum would just launch up shots from wherever he was passed the ball. Including halfcourt.\n\nHe was brought on by the Indiana Pacers for that postseason, but played just two regular season games before the team realized the move was an awful mistake. He's been out of the league ever since.\n\nBynum told TMZ earlier this month not to rule out an eventual comeback to the NBA. Still just 28, 11 years after being drafted as an 18-year-old out of St. Joseph's high school in New Jersey, it's likely that Bynum's career is over.\n\nBynum's most recent appearance on social media came a week ago, in case you were wondering. Here he is after a haircut in Inglewood, CA.\n\nRANKING ALL 30 NBA COURT DESIGNS:"
