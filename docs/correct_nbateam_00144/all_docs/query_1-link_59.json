        "text": "I like to give “life at UCLA” updates here at Cohn vs. Cohn, so you, the readers and faithful fans, can get a sense of how I live down here. Today, I got a story to tell.\n\nThursday night my fraternity, Sigma Nu, threw its quarterly house party. Andrew Bynum, the injured center for the Los Angeles Lakers, the twenty-year-old former 1st round pick, was at the party. Word started to spread around the party of his presence, but no one could find him. Then suddenly he emerged from one of my friend’s rooms with two girls and a small entourage of Sigma Nus following behind him. Everyone who had a camera or a cell phoned rushed towards him to get a picture.\n\nI just found a small sampling of those pictures here, here, and here.\n\nBynum walked out of the hall, down a flight of stairs, and into the center of the dance floor, where he danced with the two girls. I don’t know what this means about the state of his knee, or if he’ll be able to play for the Lakers this post-season. But I do know that he can walk down stairs and dance to fast paced hip hop.\n\nAny questions you have about what happened that night, feel free to ask me in the comment section.\n\nNext, I happened to have a long conversation with a UCLA football player whom I will not name. He told me that both Patrick Cowan and Ben Olsen, the two leading candidates for the starting quarterback job, got injured at practice Thursday, and that he expects them both to be sidelined until the beginning of the season. The LA Times corroborated this report here.\n\nHe also said that Kevin Craft, the quarterback from Escondido, CA who transferred to UCLA this off season, has looked great in spring practices, and that he wouldn’t be surprised if Kraft emerged as the starting quarterback for the Bruins in the fall.\n\nI also asked the football player whom he preferred, Rick Neuheisel or former coach Karl Dorrell. He said emphatically that he preferred Neuheisel, saying Neuheisel seems savvy, and Dorrell seemed over his head.\n\nSide note: Rick Neuheisel was a Sigma Nu when he went to UCLA in the early 80s. We recently had him over for dinner, and threw a party in his honor called “Sigma Nu-heisel.” My dad thought of the name.\n\n-Iggy\n\n(Visited 60 times, 1 visits today)"
