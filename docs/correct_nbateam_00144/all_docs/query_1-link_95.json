        "text": "It didn’t take a great deal of goading last season to get Doug Collins started about the76ers’ need for a superstar-caliber player to get to the elite-team level.\n\nAndrew Bynum will get his chance to be that player.\n\nBynum, a huge man with potential even larger than the All-Star numbers he put up lastseason for the Lakers, became a Sixer in a wild, four-team team that by the time thesmoke cleared involved 12 players changing uniforms and three first-round picks goingto Orlando.\n\nThe biggest name, of course, is Dwight Howard. The All-Star center and three-timeDefensive Player of the Year will join Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol and Steve Nash in LosAngeles as the Lakers attempt to make a final run at an NBA title.\n\nHowever, the Sixers get the guy best equipped to take over Howard’s title as the bestcenter in the Eastern Conference. Bynum, who won’t turn 25 until four days before thestart of the 2012-13 season, averaged 18.7 points and 11.8 rebounds in 60 games lastseason and earned is first All-Star nod. He put up those impressive numbers despitesharing the low post with another star in Gasol and Bryant remaining the first, secondand third options on offense.\n\nSixers team president Rod Thorn believes his team just went from one of the weakest inthe conference on the low post, to the strongest.\n\n‘He’s the best center in the East,’ Thorn said during a conference call Fridayafternoon. ‘Any time you have the best center, it’s a big plus. This still is a game wherebig men are very important. If you have a quality big guy, normally you’re going to be agood team.\n\n‘We see him as the second-best center in the NBA … So, yes, we consider him to beone of those elite players that you can build around. We would definitely put him in thatcategory.\n\nThe NBA put the stamp of approval around 2 o’clock Friday afternoon on the trade,which makes not only Bynum a Sixer, but also veteran guard Jason Richardson, whowas sent to Philly by Orlando. In order to make the deal happen the Sixers sent AndreIguodala to Denver, and Maurice Harkless, Nik Vucevic and a conditional first-rounddraft pick to Orlando. The draft pick is lottery-protected starting in 2014 (the Sixerstraded away next year’s first-round pick on draft night), but it seems a safe bet that theSixers are going to be playoff-quality for a while — particularly if Bynum signs a long-term deal with the Sixers, something Thorn was confident would happen.\n\n‘Our feeling is that we will have a very good chance to sign him for a lot of reasons,’ said Thorn, who had a brief conversation with Bynum’s New York-based agent DavidLee. ‘(Bynum) is really happy about it. He’s from New Jersey. He’s more of an EastCoast guy than a West Coast guy. Our feeling is that he’ll like it here and that he’ll wantto continue his career here.’"
