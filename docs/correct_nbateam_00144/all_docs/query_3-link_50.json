        "text": "The answer was drowned out by raucous applause before the 76ers’ new center could finish.\n\n“To be honest, man, my first experience here has been so great,” Andrew Bynum said during his August 2012 introductory press conference, “I’m really leaning towards making this my home.”\n\nJosh Harris, who had led a group of investors in a purchase of the team a year earlier, took the opportunity to try to endear himself to the local fan base. “Where do I sign?” Harris cut in. “Show me the contract.”\n\nIt was a surreal scene that would only get stranger for both Bynum and the Sixers. So, as a part of The Athletic’s “Can’t Believe It’s True” series, let’s revisit what turned out to be one of the oddest episodes in recent team history.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers were guided by then-CEO Adam Aron, an Abington Senior High School graduate and former CEO of Vail Resorts and Norwegian Cruise Line who now leads AMC Theatres. So a normal press conference just wouldn’t do. It wasn’t held at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, the small college the team used as a practice facility at the time. Nor was it hosted at the Wells Fargo Center. Those locations weren’t big enough for the moment.\n\nInstead, the Sixers and the media were joined by 1,500 fans, who were starved for something — anything — to be excited about when it came to their mediocre team, at the National Constitution Center. They filled the mezzanine level for the introduction of Bynum, a Plainsboro, N.J., native coming off a season with the Lakers in which he averaged 18.7 points, 11.8 rebounds and 1.9 blocks per game. Five days before the press conference, the Sixers completed a four-team deal to acquire Bynum, a 2005 lottery pick, for the hefty sum of Andre Iguodala, Nikola Vucevic, Maurice Harkless and a future first-round pick.\n\nFans, holding homemade signs and adorned in team gear, used any pause in Bynum’s answers to erupt into cheers and chants.\n\n“Andrew Bynum!”\n\n“Beat L.A.!”\n\nAfter hearing “We love you!” Bynum, then 24, acknowledged his new admirers.\n\n“I’m gonna work as hard as I can to exceed everybody’s expectations,” Bynum said. “There is pressure. But, you know, pressure makes diamonds.”\n\nThose turned out to be the only ovations Bynum would receive during his time in Philadelphia. (Bynum, through his agent, declined to comment for this story.)\n\nBynum traveled to Germany a month later to receive Orthokine therapy injections for his knees, which were healthy at the time but were a source of pain throughout his career. Scheduled before the Sixers acquired him, the procedure was supposed to require no recovery time and allow Bynum to resume basketball activities right away. The plan was he’d be ready for training camp. The injections, which were to help reduce inflammation in his knees, were intentionally administered close to the start of the season to maximize their effectiveness.\n\nBut sometime between those injections and the start of training camp a few weeks later, Bynum developed a bone bruise in his right knee, kick-starting a series of increasingly pessimistic updates about the team’s new star big man. The 7-footer was initially told to refrain from basketball activities for four weeks following that mid-September diagnosis, a timeline that left the Sixers optimistic he’d be available for the start of the 2012-13 season.\n\nThose four weeks of rest turned into another four weeks, which then became three more. In November, Bynum developed a bone bruise in his other knee, an injury that he suspected occurred while bowling. (“In hindsight, I guess you shouldn’t go bowling,” Bynum told reporters.) It was also revealed that Bynum had a “weakened cartilage state” in his knees. By the end of the month, he was out indefinitely.\n\nBowling. Seriously.\n\n“His knees now and the MRIs are not the same; it’s a different type (of) situation,” general manager Tony DiLeo told ESPN at the time. “(The bowling injury) is an unfortunate situation; when the cartilage is in a weakened state, anything can happen.”\n\nWhen Bynum spoke to the media on Dec. 10, his right knee was feeling better. The left knee, the one Bynum theorized he hurt while bowling, was not. All-Star Weekend passed, and Bynum still hadn’t played in a Sixers uniform. He returned to practice later in February, but almost immediately experienced swelling in his knees.\n\nOn March 19, Bynum underwent arthroscopic surgery on both of his knees. “The primary focus of the procedure is to clean out loose bodies from within the knees in an attempt to alleviate pain and swelling,” the team said in a statement.\n\nIt was finally official: Bynum’s season was over. It never began.\n\nAfter the Sixers finished the year 34-48 and missed the playoffs, Doug Collins stepped down as head coach in mid-April. Collins said he came to the decision around Christmas, not even halfway through the season. The overhaul of Philadelphia’s front office started on May 14 with the hiring of Sam Hinkie, Houston’s executive vice president of basketball operations. It was clear from the start that the new team president and general manager had little interest in betting on Bynum’s future.\n\n“I think of Andrew like the thousands of other young men walking around the world that are unrestricted free agents that have the potential to play NBA basketball,” Hinkie said during his own introductory press conference. “He is one of those, and I am duty-bound to consider them.”\n\nAfter Hinkie traded Jrue Holiday to New Orleans on draft night the following month, the tank was on. Suddenly, the Holiday-Bynum core was dismantled, with those two, along with DiLeo and Collins, leaving the organization without Bynum ever taking the court.\n\n“We took a shot with Andrew Bynum, and we made a couple of big moves. Injuries happen,” Harris said at the end of the season. “If I had to make that decision again, I’d make it again. Things don’t always work out. You just make good decisions, and over time they work out.”\n\nHis answer was basically “trust the process” before it was a thing.\n\nBynum’s infamous lost season kicked off some long-term Sixers trends. Before Joel Embiid missed the first two seasons of his NBA career, Bynum missed his one with the team. Before Markelle Fultz started on the “re-evaluated in three weeks” treadmill, Bynum blazed that trail. But, perhaps most importantly, before the 76ers could embark on “The Process,” the Bynum trade set the stage for it.\n\nBut there were things lost within the circus-like atmosphere surrounding the team that season.\n\nThe first was the human aspect of all of it as Bynum’s knee issues essentially ended his career. He, of course, never signed that extension Harris joked about at the press conference. (At the time, Bynum would have been limited to a three-year extension, which would’ve been capped out at about $40 million less than the five-year deal he would’ve been able to sign if he waited until the following summer.)\n\nAfter his lone season in Philadelphia, Bynum attempted a comeback as a free agent the next year, appearing in 26 games during the 2013-14 season (first with Cleveland, then Indiana). It was his final year of competitive basketball. Bynum faced criticism throughout his nine-year career, as his knees betrayed him at almost every turn. (His career average was 11.5 points and 7.7 rebounds per game.) He was constantly on the disabled list with an ailment that was reportedly degenerative in nature. That’s tough on anyone.\n\nBut it’s also easy to forget, despite the pomp and circumstance of that 2012 press conference, just how excited the city was for Bynum’s arrival and what he meant to a franchise that hadn’t had a franchise player since Allen Iverson was traded to Denver in 2006. The event held that August day was over the top, even a bit ridiculous, but it’s what Philadelphia wanted at the time. Although it wound up being wildly premature, it was a party for a fan base in desperate need of a celebration.\n\nA welcome-to-Philly bash at the Constitution Center. An injury at a bowling alley. A coach who decided midway through the season he would resign. (We later found out from ESPN’s Pablo Torre about Bynum forgetfully dragging a gas pump out of the side of his Ferrari, too.) And, when all was said and done, sweeping front office changes that ushered in a new era of the franchise.\n\nThe Sixers had it all in 2012-13, and it all started off with a preposterous press conference.\n\n(Top photo: David Dow / Getty Images)"
