        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nCan dominate as a rebounder and shot-blocker, and has developed a sometimes-unstoppable low-post scoring game. Simply massive, yet also a solid athlete blessed with good hands. Mobile, with a nose for the net. Has developed a good work ethic. Has suffered a troubling series of serious knee injuries. Still somewhat raw in terms of passing and range shooting. Will play out of control at times and maturity has been questioned due to some on-court and off-court behavior issues."
