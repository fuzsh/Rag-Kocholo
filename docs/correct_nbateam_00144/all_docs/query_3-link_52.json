        "text": "NBA roundup: Andrew Bynum returns\n\nDavid West scored 24 points and Andrew Bynum grabbed a season-high 10 rebounds in his Pacers debut, helping suddenly struggling Indiana pull away late for a 94-83 win over Boston at Indianapolis on Tuesday night.\n\nIndiana (47-17) ended its longest losing streak of the season at four. Paul George added 12 points as the Pacers extended their Eastern Conference lead to 1 1/2 games over two-time defending champion Miami in the East.\n\nBoston (22-42) was led by Jared Sullinger with 17 points and Kris Humphries with 15 as its two-game winning streak ended.\n\nBynum played just 15 minutes but his first basket gave Indiana a 16-14 lead and the Pacers never trailed again.\n\nBoston, which trailed by as much as 15 in the third quarter, twice got within one in the fourth. But the Pacers answered the second time with a 6-0 run to make it 83-76 and the Celtics never threatened again.\n\nBynum gave Indiana an infusion of energy that it desperately needed on a night George was in foul trouble and Lance Stephenson was off the mark.\n\nThrough 2 1/2 quarters, Stephenson and George had combined for just four points.\n\nBynum, on the other hand, finished with eight points and one assist in his first action since late December. And the fans, who had been waiting since Feb. 1 to see No. 17 on the court, gave him a rousing ovation when he entered the game with 4:22 left in the first quarter.\n\nIt didn't take Bynum long to prove he can still play.\n\nHe started with a dunk, breaking the 14-14 tie, on a post-up move. That spurred an 8-2 run that gave Indiana a 22-16 lead.\n\nIndiana led 24-20 after one and took advantage of a 13-2 run late in the second quarter to build a 47-33 lead with 2:22 left in the half.\n\nBoston closed to 49-40 at the half and after trailing 65-50 late in the third rallied against the NBA's best home team. The Celtics closed the quarter on an 11-4 run to get within 69-61 after three, then scored the first five points of the fourth quarter.\n\nSullinger's 3 with 6:45 left made it 77-76, but West hit a 21-footer to start Indiana's decisive 6-0 run. Boston couldn't get closer than six the rest of the way as Indiana pulled off its first four-game season sweep of the Celtics since 1997-98.\n\nPistons 99, Kings 89: At Auburn Hills, Mich., Josh Smith scored 24 points and Rodney Stuckey added 23 to lift host Detroit.\n\nAndre Drummond added 15 points and eight rebounds for Detroit, outscoring DeMarcus Cousins in a matchup of two of the NBA's top young big men. Cousins had 13 points and 14 rebounds but shot 5 of 15 from the field.\n\nDetroit trailed 54-52 at halftime but outscored the Kings 20-11 in the third quarter.\n\nRudy Gay scored 20 points and Isaiah Thomas added 19 points and eight assists for Sacramento.\n\nThe Pistons snapped a three-game losing streak and pulled to within three games of Atlanta for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\nTimberwolves 112, Bucks 101: At Minneapolis, Kevin Love had 27 points, 10 rebounds and six assists and J.J. Barea broke out of a horrid shooting slump to score 19 points to lift Minnesota.\n\nAfter going 5 for 25 in his previous three games, Barea hit 7 of 10 shots to help wake the sluggish Wolves up and Kevin Martin scored 26 points to help them finish a four-game homestand at 2-2.\n\nSpurs 104, Bulls 96: At Chicago, Manu Ginobili scored 22 points and Tony Parker had 20 as league-leading San Antonio beat Chicago.\n\nKawhi Leonard added 16 for San Antonio, which won its seventh straight and 10th in its last 11. The Spurs (47-16) maintained their hold on the NBA's best record, staying ahead of Oklahoma City and Indiana, who both started play Tuesday a half-game behind the Spurs.\n\nGrizzlies 109, Trail Blazers 99: At Memphis, Tenn.,Marc Gasol scored 19 points, Zach Randolph added 18 points and 12 rebounds and Memphis solidified their hold on the final Western Conference playoff spot.\n\nMike Conley added 17 points and Courtney Lee finished with 16, including helping the Grizzlies extend their lead in the third quarter. Mike Miller had 14 for Memphis, which won its third straight.\n\nThunder 106, Rockets 98: At Oklahoma City,Kevin Durant scored 42 points to help Oklahoma City defeat Houston.\n\nOklahoma City's Russell Westbrook scored 24 points and got the best of nemesis Patrick Beverley. During last year's playoffs, Beverley dived for the ball and ran into Westbrook's right knee as a timeout was being called, causing the injury that ended Westbrook's season and cost him about half of this season. It was their first meeting since the incident.\n\nSuns: The league suspended Phoenix starting forward P.J. Tucker for one game for elbowing Blake Griffin in the chin in the Suns' loss to the Clippers in Loss Angeles on Monday night.\n\nTucker will sit out Wednesday night's home game against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nTucker was ejected after the altercation. The elbowing occurred as the two fell to the floor entangled while going for a rebound with 5 1/2 minutes to go in the game."
