        "text": "In a surprising late night trade, the Cleveland Cavaliers have sent disgruntled center Andrew Bynum and three draft picks to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for Great Britain's Luol Deng. Although initial rumors suggested that the Bulls would possibly trade Bynum to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Pau Gasol, Cleveland ultimately preferred Chicago's offer for their All-Star forward.\n\nIt's notable that when they announced the trade, the Bulls announced they were trading for \"multiple draft picks, and the contract of Andrew Bynum\" a rare bit of complete honesty that can only happen in the NBA when neither side wants the player to actually play basketball for them. Reportedly, the Bulls will waive Bynum Tuesday afternoon, saving them approximately $15 million in player salary and luxury taxes. In addition to the added flexibility, Cleveland will send them a top-ten protected first round pick (from the Sacramento Kings) and two second-round picks (originally from the Portland Trail Blazers). The Bulls have not as yet issued an apology to NBA trade machine-addicted geeks for the complete and utter unsexiness of this deal for all but the most dedicated salary cap wonks.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers were a bit more welcoming with their new arrival. Cleveland owner Dan Gilbert actually even welcomed Deng by name (via Twitter, and not in comic sans). Deng comes to the Cavaliers as a two time All-Star who has been averaging 19 points and 6.9 rebounds, but he's been missing games while trying to play through an Achilles injury.\n\nIt's a rare thing to say that a trade to Cleveland could actually help a player's career, but this very well might be the case for Deng. Deng, who reportedly could not agree with the Bulls on a contract extension, was something of a lame duck in Chicago, making him a valuable trade chip. The move to Cleveland takes his minutes out of the hands of Bulls head coach Tom Thibodeau who keeps his players on the court longer than most coaches, with Deng being the most egregious example as he has topped the league in minutes played over the last two NBA seasons. On top of this, Deng's agent has implied he might be upset at Chicago's doctors after spinal tap complications effectively ended Deng's postseason last year. Escaping Chicago could end up extending Deng's career. (The bright side to this heavy workload? Deng departs Chicago as the Bulls' 4th-leading scorer behind Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Bob Love.)\n\nWhile Deng comes with a lot of miles, and a long history of injuries, he should still be able to give Cavaliers minutes, which was exactly what they weren't getting from Bynum. Bynum was productive with the Lakers towards the end of his LA career, but after being sent to the Philadelphia 76ers as part of the massive Dwight Howard trade, he did not play a single minute in the regular season. Most notoriously, he re-aggravated an injury while bowling.\n\nAfter signing a conditional two years/$12 million deal with the Cleveland Cavaliers over the offseason, with only $6 million guaranteed, there was a hope that he could be a low-risk high-reward type player. While his time in Cleveland was more productive than his time in Philly – at least this time Bynum did actually make it to the court on occasion – last week, the underachieving Cavaliers suspended him for disciplinary reasons and made it clear they were seeking a trade. Oddly enough it's hard to say that the gamble was unsuccessful, as they were able to package him with other teams' draft picks and turn them into a genuinely good player before the trade deadline. Of course, this trade could end up looking bad for Cleveland if Deng doesn't help the Cavaliers get into the playoffs and he decides to sign elsewhere in the offseason, which is a very real possibility.\n\nWhere does this leave the Chicago Bulls? What they're doing isn't exactly tanking, even without Deng their chances of landing a top draft pick are close to nil. Still, if Derrick Rose were not lost for the season or if the Chicago Bulls had a good shot at remaining competitive for one of the top seeds in the Eastern Conference, they would probably hold onto Luol Deng, see where the season takes them even though they would get nothing in return if he were to leave via free agency (which would likely be the case).\n\nHowever, in their position, 14-18 and 12 1/2 games behind the Indiana Pacers in their division, they can hardly be blamed for, in the words of GM Gar Forman, putting themselves in \"a better position to make the entire roster stronger for the future and to compete for a championship\". These moves may include the eventual amnestying of Carlos Boozer or bringing in Real Madrid's Nikola Mirotic, picked up in the 2011 NBA Draft. Ultimately at this point in their franchise history, Chicago would rather take advantage of a desperate team already committed to going \"all in\" this season than risk becoming one.\n\nAnd make no mistake, this may not be a desperate move but these Cleveland Cavaliers have found themselves a very desperate team. At the start of the season, the Cavaliers saw the weakened competition in the Eastern Conference as an opportunity to make their first postseason appearance since that LeBron guy left, reloading with Jarrett Jack, formerly of the Golden State Warriors, and first-round draft pick Anthony Bennett. Instead they've compiled a putrid 11-23 record, despite playing against teams trying to tank, two New York teams that have been walking punchlines and whatever the heck the Milwaukee Bucks are.\n\nDeng, if healthy, could be the right guy to pair up with Kyrie Irving. Deng's one of those rare players who can bring a \"veteran presence\" to the locker room while also being actually still a really good player. The Cavaliers could even be interested in an contract extension, which seems less unbelievable when you realize that he's actually still only 28 (even if it feels like he's already played more career minutes than many retired All-Stars). Cleveland might also be thinking that getting a solid All-Star like Deng could help them lure free-agent-to-be LeBron James back to the team which is just absolutely adorable of them.\n\nIt's a bit of a telling thing that both the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles Lakers were apparently in discussions about acquiring Andrew Bynum or, ahem, \"the contract of Andrew Bynum\". Both teams have been struggling to figure out what they are playing for this season without their franchise players, Derrick Rose and Kobe Bryant respectively, who are both out indefinitely with injuries. Both Chicago and L.A. seemed willing to use Bynum's availability as a way to get back pieces for a disgruntled player, and unsurprisingly the Bulls were more eager to make the deal happen. While the Lakers seem stuck between trying to be realistic and avoiding the appearance of \"giving up on the season\"."
