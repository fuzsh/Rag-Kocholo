The Wolves are not interested in Bynum.\n\nNot many noticed, but when outfielder Bryce Harper, 19, pinch-hit for the National League in Tuesday night’s All-Star Game in Kansas City, Mo., former Twins catcher Butch Wynegar‘s 36-year-old record as the youngest position player to appear in the All-Star Game was broken.\n\nWynegar, at age 20, pinch-hit for the American League in the 1976 game in Philadelphia.\n\n“I pinch-hit and walked off John ‘The Count’ Montefusco,” Wynegar said Wednesday, July 11.\n\n“Well, records are meant to be broken, that’s how I look at it. It was nice to have it for 36 years, but that’s a pretty good guy in Bryce Harper to go ahead and break it.”\n\nWynegar, 56, is hitting coach for the New York Yankees’ Triple-A club — the Empire State Yankees — that this season is temporarily based in Rochester, N.Y.\n\n“We’re doing a lot of traveling and living out of suitcases,” he said.\n\nWynegar spent six seasons with the Twins. For four seasons, he was major league hitting coach for the Milwaukee Brewers. He wants to return to the major leagues.\n\n“Like players, we all don’t want to be in Triple-A, we want to be in the big leagues,” Wynegar said. “It’s really come down to who you know nowadays. I’ve had about five or six interviews since I left Milwaukee, and it seems I come in second every time to someone that the GM knows a little bit better.\n\n“I just look at it as there’s a plan for me, and if it happens, it happens. If not, I enjoy what I’m doing now.”\n\nFormer Twins pitcher Pedro Ramos, 77, resides in Nicaragua and is doing fine, former teammate Camilo Pascual said.\n\nFormer Gopher Ralph Sampson III is with the Michael Jordan-owned Charlotte Bobcats’ Las Vegas summer league team.\n\nBen Utecht starred in football at Hastings High School, then for the Gophers, then played in a Super Bowl for the Indianapolis Colts, then recorded music in Nashville and went on national tour as a singing balladeer.\n\nNow, maybe, we’ll be see him in the movies.\n\nUtecht, a 1999 Hastings grad, is the lead actor in a short film, “Three Weeks,” about a guy who walked away from professional football to be a musician. Filming was completed two weeks ago. Plans are to release and promote it at major film festivals, including Sundance, beginning in September.\n\n“We’ll see what happens,” Utecht said.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Utecht, 31, played for the Colts during their 2006 championship season that ended with a 29-17 victory over Chicago in the 2007 Super Bowl.\n\n“When I was playing football, I sought out professional voice lessons and acting lessons just to always be ready and prepared for anything that potentially could come my way,” he said. “Needless to say, I was ready for this and excited for the chance.”\n\nMeanwhile, Utecht continues to talk with some New York music labels about his singing career. He already has released one album, “Christmas Hope.”\n\nUtecht, who resides in Lakeville, was in the NFL for six seasons — four with Indianapolis, two with Cincinnati. He was forced to retire in 2009 because of repeated concussions.\n\nJohn Williams, the beloved former Gophers offensive lineman who was a dentist in Minneapolis and died unexpectedly at age 64 last week, will be inducted into the “M” Club Hall of Fame on Sept. 20 at TCF Bank Stadium.\n\nFormer University of St. Thomas football star Fritz Waldvogel had a career-best 403 all-purpose yards to lead his first-place Schwabisch Hall Unicorns team to a 70-39 victory over the Franken Knights on Saturday in the 16-team German Football League.\n\nThe 5-foot-8 Waldvogel had 253 receiving yards as well as an 89-yard kickoff return among his three touchdowns. In five games for the Unicorns, Waldvogel has 15 TDs and 1,301 all-purpose yards.\n\nDON’T PRINT THAT\n\nOne Minneapolis fan got into Monday’s All-Star Home Run Derby in Kansas City by buying a ticket off the street for $75 (face value $150). And he bought a lower-level ticket for Tuesday’s All-Star Game for $220 (face value $250).\n\nBut two other guys, just before Tuesday’s game, had to pay $380 apiece for lower-level seats.\n\nIt will be interesting whether baseball Commissioner Bud Selig, who is expected to be at Target Field on July 31 to officially welcome the Major League Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities (RBI) tournament, announces that the Twins will host the 2014 All-Star Game. If so, those tickets are expected to exceed the prices in Kansas City.\n\nThe Twins would love to host the 2014 game so they can begin leveraging 2013 and 2014 season-ticket sales for All-Star Game priority sales.\n\nOVERHEARD\n\nFormer North Stars president Lou Nanne, who took Mike Modano with the No. 1 overall pick in the 1988 NHL draft, on Modano’s election Wednesday to the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame: “Very appropriate. And when he’s eligible, he’ll make the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, too.”\n\nOriginally Published: July 10, 2012 at 11:01 p.m."
