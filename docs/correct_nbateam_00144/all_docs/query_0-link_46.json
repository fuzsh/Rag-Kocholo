        "text": "Andrew Bynum Biography\n\nAndrew Bynum is an NBA center that at times has been regarded as one of the best big men in the league. Bynum was an All-Star in 2012 and won two championships with the Los Angeles Lakers. His best season was most definitely 2012, when he averaged 18.7 points and 11.8 rebounds a game on the way to second team All-NBA honors. Knee injuries have unfortunately sidetracked Bynum’s career since. He was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers as part of a three team deal that landed Dwight Howard in Los Angeles. Bynum missed his entire season with the Sixers, but played for the Cleveland Cavaliers and Indiana Pacers in 2013-14. The Lakers took Bynum out of high school with the tenth pick in the 2005 NBA Draft. In his rookie season, he was the youngest player to ever play in an NBA game. He was a 2005 McDonald’s All-American.\n\nBook Andrew Bynum for your Next Event\n\nDisclaimer: AthleteSpeakers assists companies seeking to hire talent like Andrew Bynum for speaking engagements, virtual meetings, appearances, product endorsements, and business sanctions.
