        "text": "Hello, fellow FB&Gers. Kurt has given up trying to figure out why the site’s spam filter hates me so much, and has given me moderating privileges in order to let my posts through easier. Yes, my handle is The Dude Abides. As one might guess, my favorite comedy is The Big Lebowski, and I like to sprinkle in some quotes from the movie every so often in my comments here. Some of my favorite childhood memories involve swiping my dad’s transistor radio from the garage every afternoon I got home from school, hiding it under my bed, then turning it on to listen to Chick call the Laker games after I’d been sent to bed. I started doing this during that magical 1971-72 season, with the 33-game win streak and the first LA Laker championship.\n\nAnyway, there’s been an ongoing discussion on this and other boards about the merits of one Andrew Bynum. I’d like to compare Drew’s numbers with the numbers of a Hall of Fame center who was named to the NBA’s 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1996. This comparison is at similar stages of their careers. What should be taken into account in this comparison is that Drew played approximately 1.5 to 2 full seasons of high school ball and zero college ball, while our Hall of Famer played either 3 or 4 full years in high school, one year of frosh college ball, and three years of Division One NCAA ball. Also, Drew hardly played any minutes in his rookie season. So to compensate for these factors, I’m comparing the stats from Drew’s third and fourth seasons to the Hall of Famer’s second and third seasons.\n\nBynum, 3rd season, Age 20\n\nGm Min/G Pts Reb Ast Blk FG% FT%\n\n35__28.8__13.1__10.2___2.2___2.6__63.6__69.5\n\nHall of Famer, 2nd season, Age 24\n\nGm Min/G Pts Reb Ast Blk FG% FT%\n\n82__24.0__12.5___8.3___1.2___1.5__47.2__62.5\n\nBynum, 4th season, Age 21\n\nGm Min/G Pts Reb Ast Blk FG% FT%\n\n50__28.9__14.3___8.0___1.8___2.2__56.0__70.7\n\nHall of Famer, 3rd season, Age 25\n\nGm Min/G Pts Reb Ast Blk FG% FT%\n\n76__31.7__17.2___12.1__1.5___2.9__49.9__69.8\n\nSo, the Hall of Famer made a big leap from his second to his third season. Also, bear in mind that in both of these seasons shown here, the HOFer’s team did not make the playoffs, and he was one of the two main weapons in his team’s attack during his third season, finishing second in points per game (but first in pts per 36 minutes). A couple years after his third season, this Hall of Famer was part of arguably the most lopsided NBA trade of all time, going from the Warriors to the Celtics along with Kevin McHale, in return for Joe Barry Carroll. I’m talking of course about Robert Parish.\n\nNow, we saw that big jump in Parish’s stats from his second to his third season, and we see that he averaged 17.2 PPG and 12.1 RPB in his third season vs Drew’s 14.3 and 8.0 in his fourth. However, if we calculate points and rebounds per 36 minutes, the gap is closed slightly, with Parish at 19.5 and 13.7, and Drew at 17.8 and 9.9. In addition, Parish was basically the first option on offense for the Warriors, with Drew being the third option behind Kobe and Pau. Also, at these comparable stages of their careers, Parish was four years older than Drew and had eight years of pre-NBA experience to Drew’s two. So, let’s give Drew some time to develop (and more importantly, to get healthy). While the odds are against his having a career as great as the Chief’s, he sure has the potential to develop into a consistent All Star.\n\nWell, that’s my first post. I promised Kurt that I wouldn’t abuse my new moderator privileges, but his mailbox is full so I’ll make that promise here. Also, there’s no way that I’ll let Walter have anything to do with this site. That guy is way too volatile….and profane.\n\nBert R, aka The Dude Abides"
