Bynum also had 10 points and 13 rebounds before checking out to an ovation.\n\n“It’s the only way really possible for me to get a triple-double – through blocked shots,” Bynum said of his first career triple-double. “If I play good ‘D’, we’ll win games. I think I’m just going to be as aggressive as I can defensively to contest their shots….You’ve got to win Game 1. Statistics are against the teams that lose Game 1, especially on the home court.”\n\nGame 2 is Tuesday night.\n\nJust how dominant were Bynum and his tall teammates against the NBA’s highest-scoring team? Bynum blocked 11 percent of the Nuggets’ 90 shots, and with 15 total blocks, the Lakers swatted one of every six Denver shots, separating the Nuggets from any hope of a late rally.\n\n“His timing was impeccable today,” Bryant said of Bynum. “He really understood the rhythm of their offensive players. He was just there at the exact moment, either to change or block the shot.”\n\nWhile Bynum had the Lakers’ first playoff triple-double since Magic Johnson in the 1991 NBA Finals, fellow 7-footer Pau Gasol added 13 points, eight rebounds and eight assists for the playoff-tested Lakers, who never trailed while forcing Denver to play Los Angeles’ preferred half-court style.\n\nBynum blocked eight shots in the first three quarters before surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s franchise-record nine blocks in the fourth. He eventually equaled the NBA record set by Utah’s Mark Eaton on April 26, 1985, and matched by hall of famer Hakeem Olajuwon on April 29, 1990.\n\n“We’ve got to find a way to score before he gets in the paint, because he’s impressive,” said Danilo Gallinari, who led Denver with 19 points.\n\nFor coach Mike Brown, who mostly has enjoyed his first year riding the roller coaster of Bynum’s emotions and motivation, the game showed why these Lakers could go deep into June.\n\n“He can control a game without shooting a single shot,” Brown said. “He has 10 blocks, but I’d be curious to know how many (shots) he changed. He changed a gazillion shots in the paint, and that’s what Denver is very good at.”\n\nOther games\n\nTony Parker scored 28 points, and the San Antonio Spurs won their first playoff opener in four years, beating the Utah Jazz 106-91 in Game 1 of their first-round Western Conference series in San Antonio….Josh Smith scored 22 points and grabbed 18 rebounds, leading the Atlanta Hawks to an 83-74 home victory over Boston in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference playoffs, the final minute turning ugly when Celtics star Rajon Rondo was ejected for bumping an official….Chris Paul hit two free throws with 23.7 seconds left, and the Los Angeles Clippers rallied from 27 points down to beat the host Memphis Grizzlies 99-98 in the opening game of this Western Conference series.\n\nOriginally Published: April 28, 2012 at 11:01 p.m."
