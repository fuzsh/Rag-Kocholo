        "text": "Andrew Bynum played just two games for the Pacers this season. (Mike Lawrie/Getty Images)\n\nPacers center Andrew Bynum will miss the remainder of the playoffs for Indiana and will no longer be with the team, according to a press release issued by Indiana on Wednesday.\n\nTeam President of Basketball Operations Larry Bird thanked the 26-year-old Bynum and the medical staff for trying to resolve chronic issues with his knee:\n\n“We want to thank Andrew and our medical staff for trying to get the issues with his knee resolved. We wish him the best in the future.”\n\nBynum, a former All-Star, played in just two games for the Pacers this season after signing with the team on Feb. 1.\n\nHe had previously been with the Cleveland Cavaliers but was traded to the Bulls before the deadline for swingman Luol Deng and was immediately waived by Chicago.\n\nThe Pacers parted ways with Bynum at a time when starting center Roy Hibbert continues to be a virtual no-show this postseason: Hibbert had zero points and zero rebounds in the team's loss to the Washington Wizards on Monday.\n\nBetween his lingering knee problems and well-documented clashes with teammates and front office executives, most recently in Cleveland, Bynum may have trouble finding his next NBA destination. By the start of next season, he'll be nearly three years removed from an All-Star year with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2012 having shown no signs of returning to form either physically or mentally."
