        "text": "Andrew Bynum\n\nThe oft-injured Los Angeles Lakers center went through a limited practice Wednesday for the first time since having his balky right knee drained on Monday.\n\n\"It didn't really help,” he said. \"As soon as I drained it, about 12 hours later all the fluid came back.”\n\nAs a result, the swelling that has plagued Bynum throughout the playoffs isn't any better, either. His big black knee brace remains a constant companion, as does the pain in his knee.\n\nBynum said he's determined to play tonight in Game 1 of the NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics.\n\n\"He's going to give everything he's got again just like he's been doing,” fellow 7-footer Pau Gasol said.\n\nP.J. Carlesimo\n\nCarlesimo joins assistants Alex English, Marc Iavaroni, Micah Nori, Eric Hughes and Alvin Williams on coach Jay Triano's staff with the Raptors.\n\nCarlesimo was fired by the Thunder on Nov. 22, 2008, after the team started 1-12 in its first season since the franchise moved from Seattle. He spent three years with Portland from 1994-97, leading the Trail Blazers to the playoffs each season, and then coached Golden State from 1997-2000.\n\nCarlesimo also was an assistant with San Antonio from 2002-07 when the Spurs won three NBA titles. He was also the head coach at Seton Hall for 12 seasons.\n\nLeBron James\n\nCleveland native Michael Symon, one of Food Network's Iron Chefs, has offered to go to James' house once a month and cook a meal for the MVP's family and friends if he re-signs as a free agent with the Cavaliers. Symon posted a letter to James on his Facebook page.\n\nSymon thanked James for all he has done for the city and urged him to follow his heart when making his decision. Symon also pointed out that some legendary athletes — Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Jim Brown, Bill Russell and Michael Jordan — created their legacies primarily with one team.\n\nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS"
