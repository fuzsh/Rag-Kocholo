        "text": "Oh, Andrew.\n\nYou're speaking the truth about the Los Angeles Lakers ... NOW? You're talking about Kobe Bryant stunting your growth and the need for more post play and an inside-out offense now, when you've long since been sent to Philadelphia and you nor your argument have a leg to stand on anymore? Talk about better never than late.\n\nAndrew Bynum, the Sixers center who finally took the filter off with reporters on Sunday on the topic of why it never worked as well as it should have during his seven seasons with the Lakers, should have been saying these things when there was still time to do something about it. The Lakers were a flawed team during his later years in Los Angeles, and he knew it better than anyone.\n\nPublic pressure on the topic could have gone a long ways toward changing a culture that has been one way – namely Kobe's way – for a long time. If anything, the always-unfiltered Bryant may have respected Bynum's candor and courage to speak up for what he thought was right as a competitor rather than take the passive-aggressive approach (see his infamous three-pointer). Bynum - who has yet to play for the Sixers this season because of lingering problems with his left knee - would make the occasional public comment about problems with the Lakers' offense, but he hadn't addressed the dynamic with Bryant this directly until now.\n\nHe would share his thoughts privately, to be sure, grumbling about how his role in the offensive system wasn't valued like it should be and wondering why a balanced plan of attack wasn't more of a priority. But to say it now is pointless, like telling the judge at the alimony proceeding what you wish your wife had done differently leading up to the divorce after refusing to go to counseling. If you wanted this marriage to work, you should have done something about it when there was still time to reconcile. No need to tell old tales now (or, by the way, to deem yourself the No. 1 center in the league - as he did in the same interview - when you made it clear you saw Howard as the top center in the league just 10 months ago and haven't done much to change that power structure since).\n\nBynum's story does still matter for the Lakers, though, as they simply can't afford to let Howard became the franchise's latest big man to beef with Bryant en route to his exodus as a free agent this summer. For all the obvious reasons, league executives have already begun wondering aloud whether Howard would forgo the extra year (five vs. four) and increased annual raises (7.5 percent compared to 4.5 percent) that the Lakers can pay him in order to find a more suitable spot this summer.\n\nHoward and Bryant appear to have co-existed just fine so far in terms of their personalities, and it was probably a positive sign for the Lakers that Howard was willing to express his frustrations with Bryant about the recent defensive lapses. Yet still, the ninth-year player who isn't fully healthy yet is averaging more than two shots less per game in 2012-13 than he was in 2011-12 (13.4 to 11.2), and the arc of the season so far (two-game winning streak over Washington and Philadelphia notwithstanding) is still leaning toward epic failure when it comes to the collective outcome here.\n\nFor Bryant's part, his early MVP candidacy has long since been replaced by the revealing reality that the Lakers are 3-11 when he scores 30-plus points. His individual feats (league-leading 29.5 points per game, 47.8% shooting overall, 38% from three-point range) have been tremendous though, and the latest round of Lakers problems have much more to do with injuries (Steve Nash and Pau Gasol remain out) than they do the question of chemistry between Bryant and his big man.\n\nBut if the tandem isn't as terrific as we thought it would be and the Lakers go down in flames come April and May, the most relevant question of all will be whether Houston can convince Howard to come join James Harden and Jeremy Lin this summer, or whether the Mavericks find a way to exploit the concerns Howard may have about life with the Lakers. Dallas, to review, was on his original list of teams to which he was willing to re-sign if traded to last season and the Rockets reshuffled their entire roster to make a major push to trade Howard during the offseason.\n\nOr what about Atlanta, his hometown team that has had a rapid and impressive makeover under new general manager Danny Ferry (the Hawks are third in the East currently at 14-7) and has just $18 million in committed payroll for next season? His childhood buddy, Josh Smith, is also a free agent this summer and could make for as good a running mate as anyone.\n\nThese are the Lakers big man problems that should be talked about now – not the ones involving Bynum."
