        "text": "X00010_9.JPG\n\nThe Cavaliers are expected to reach out to free agent center Andrew Bynum. (AP Photo/Chris Carlson)\n\nCLEVELAND -- Teams around the NBA were allowed to contact free agents starting at 12:01 a.m. and there have been plenty of news and rumors regarding some of the top available players,\n\n.\n\nThe Cavaliers are reportedly interested in center Andrew Bynum, who sat out last season with the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\n, the Cavaliers will reach out to Bynum in hopes of adding the center to bulk up their front court.\n\nEven thought Bynum didn't play last season due to persistent knee trouble, he should attract more than a few teams for his services.\n\nThe source specifically mentioned the Portland Trail Blazers and Cleveland Cavaliers as two teams expected to reach out to Bynum along with all of the franchises with cap space that are pursuing center Dwight Howard. Howard is set to meet with the Atlanta Hawks, Dallas Mavericks, Los Angeles Lakers, Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets. Of those five, the Hawks, Mavericks and Rockets have the necessary space under the cap to make a max, or near max, offer without needing to do a sign-and-trade.\n\nBynum last played during the 2011-12 season in Los Angeles with the Lakers, averaging 18.7 points per game and grabbing 11.8 rebounds.\n\nWhen healthy, Bynum is one of the top centers in the league. He would immediately help the Cavaliers up front and add a player that can score in the post. But how much money would it take to sign Bynum?\n\nAnother big question will be can he stay healthy? Bynum's camp is confident he will be ready for the start of training camp wherever he signs.\n\nThe Cavaliers have also talked with free agents C.J. Watson (\n\n), Darren Collison (\n\n) and Earl Clark (\n\n).\n\nThe Cavaliers are making their search of a backup point guard to Kyrie Irving a priority this summer. Adding either Watson or Collison would make sense and add depth to their bench.\n\nWatson played in 80 games for the Brooklyn Nets this season, averaging 19 minutes per game.\n\nCollison started 47 games for the Dallas Mavericks last season, averaging 12.0 points and 5.1 assists per game while shooting 47 percent.\n\nThe Cavs and Clark will reportedly meet on Tuesday to discuss the possibility of Clark signing in Cleveland. Clark played for Mike Brown with the Lakers.\n\nPursuit for Dwight Howard begins\n\nThe Lakers and Houston Rockets\n\n. Both teams are putting on a full-court press in order to sign the biggest free agent in this year's class. From USAtoday.com:\n\nEven though the Houston Rockets were given the first formal meeting with Howard in Los Angeles near the start of free agency Sunday night, Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak made two unexpected connections with Howard leading up to his much-anticipated round of meetings. The first came on Saturday, as the two discussed Howard's future and why he belongs in Laker Land one last time before Kupchak's competition came to town. Then Kupchak made a surprise visit on Sunday night, a brief well-wishing that came just minutes after the 9:01 p.m. PT buzzer sounded and before Howard headed out for dinner and a presentation with the Rockets.\n\nFormer Lakers coach Phil Jackson\n\nout to Howard, encouraging him to stay with Los Angeles.\n\nOther news and rumors:\n\nLakers have reached out to Cavaliers guard Wayne Ellington. (\n\n)\n\nOklahoma City Thunder guard Kevin Martin has received interest from the Milwaukee Bucks, New Orleans Pelicans, Minnesota Timberwolves, Detroit Pistons and Mavericks. (\n\n)\n\nAtlanta Hawks free agent F Josh Smith had a \"productive meeting\" with the Pistons. (\n\n)\n\nThe Chicago Bulls have targeted Will Bynum and former Cavaliers guard Mo Williams. (\n\n)\n\nNew York Knicks have expressed interest in Monta Ellis. (\n\n)\n\nThe Knicks are also close a deal for Toronto's Andrea Bargnani in exchange for Marcus Camby and Steve Novak. (\n\n)"
