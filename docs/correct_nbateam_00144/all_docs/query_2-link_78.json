        "text": "MIAMI (CBSMiami) â€“ The NBA champion Miami Heat have a well-known need for a big man to solidify the roster. When center Andrew Bynum was released, some media outlets linked him with Miami, but the Heat don't appear to be looking at the former All-Star.\n\nAccording to CBS4 news partner the Miami Herald, Bynum's agent said the Heat have \"shown no interest in signing him (Bynum).\" The Herald further reported the Heat still expect Greg Oden to make an impact on the lineup in the second half of the season.\n\nBynum is seven-feet-tall and has a history of being a solid low-post player, until the last two years. Bynum has battled knee problems, attitude problems, a perceived lack of interest in basketball, and other problems over the past two seasons.\n\nHe spent an entire year on the bench in Philadelphia and then was signed by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the past offseason. Bynum struggled to get into the lineup and struggled on the court. The Cavaliers eventually tired of his game on and off the court and would go on to ban him from team activities.\n\nBynum's toxic personality is not in line with what the Heat have built around the Big Three of Chris Bosh, LeBron James, and Dwyane Wade.\n\nOden has been working with the Heat since last summer to rehab his knees and his game. Oden, a seven-foot monster in his own right, has shown the ability to dominate rebounding and put together a nice inside game as well.\n\nBut, Oden hasn't been able to get and stay healthy in three years and hasn't been active for a regular season game for the Heat yet this year.\n\nStill, if Oden can contribute 10-15 minutes a game as the Heat make a playoff run; it could make the Heat's quest for a three-peat that much easier."
