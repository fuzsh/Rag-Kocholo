        "text": "Needless to say, this is an obvious move for the Los Angeles Lakers to make with Andrew Bynum. From the LA Times: “The definition of a no-brainer? The Lakers plan to exercise their team option on Andrew Bynum. ‘He’s the starting center on the West All-Star team. Why wouldn’t we do everything we could to keep him here?’ Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak said. ‘We’re ecstatic to have him on the team.’ The Lakers have until June 30 to exercise the $16.1-million option they have for the last year of Bynum’s contract. After next season, however, he becomes a free agent unless they negotiate an extension between now and then.”"
