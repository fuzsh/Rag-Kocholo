        "text": "Cavaliers center Andrew Bynum has done everything in his power to get back on the court.\n\nNow, he has to fight the urge to leave it – forever.\n\nThe 7-foot, 294-pounder said this week he has given serious thought to retiring. Once that idea creeps into your thinking, sometimes the end is near. He’s clearly not seeing the kind of production he’s used to seeing. He’s not the player he once was. He relied on athleticism in the past to be able to dominate the center position.\n\nNow, he’s a really tall guy who jogs up and down the court. He gets no lift on his shots. He blocks shots, not because he’s out-jumping anyone, but because of his incredible wing span.\n\nIt’s kind of sad, really, what’s going on before our eyes. Coach Mike Brown’s plan was to eventually start Bynum. That’s probably not going to happen unless Bynum improves and is able to accomplish some of the things he used to do before knee problems sapped much of his lateral movement and jumping ability.\n\nThe Cavs say Bynum has worked extremely hard to get back to where he is now. He’s nowhere near where he once was as a player with the Los Angeles Lakers. Will he somehow find a way to regain that athleticism? It would be a wonderful story if he did, but it’s unlikely.\n\nHe’s a proud man, and a very intelligent one. I can’t see him continuing with this comeback unless he has a breakthrough, some kind of renaissance. He’s not used to being a run-of-the-mill player in the NBA.\n\nBynum said he’s not enjoying himself on the court because of how limited he is as a player. If those sharp pains continue – he grimaced after a dunk in Milwaukee on Wednesday – it wouldn’t be a shock if he walked away from the game. He’s owed $6 million by the Cavs regardless of what happens. But the other $18 million on his two-year contract isn’t guaranteed. It was a risk the Cavs had to take, but it’s one that hasn’t worked out thus far.\n\nI hope he sticks it out. He’s intriguing to watch. Legitimate centers are so hard to find these days. He’s only 26 years old, but his days in Cleveland could be numbered.\n\nRookie woes\n\nAnthony Bennett needs to play, and play a lot.\n\nThat probably won’t happen on the Cavs, as they are trying to win games and gain a playoff berth. The rookie needs to regain his confidence and swagger. Sending him to the National Basketball Development League might do more harm than good. I don’t think the No. 1 pick in the draft has ever played in the D-League. Instead of building up his confidence, it might shatter it.\n\nYes, it would do him good to go to the Canton Charge and average 20 points and 10 rebounds. Letting him feel good about himself again would be a good thing. Right now, the kid’s a mess. His confidence appears to be shot. His head looks like it’s spinning. He’s probably starting to question what got him to this level in the first place.\n\nBut if he were to be sent to Canton, it would be difficult not to view it as a demotion. That’s the way it would be portrayed in the media. So, when the Charge opens the season at Erie, Pa., on Friday, Nov. 22, don’t expect him on the roster. Why not Oladipo?\n\nIt’s easy to second-guess the Cavs’ pick of Bennett over players like Magic guard Victor Oladipo, Kings guard Ben McLemore or Bobcats forward/center Cody Zeller.\n\nScuttlebutt about Oladipo in the draft was that he didn’t shoot the well from the perimeter. McLemore had his doubters because of his laissez-faire personality. He almost had to be prodded to take over games at Kansas. Zeller’s sophomore season at Indiana appeared to be a step back from his outstanding freshman year. And, after all, the Cavs already had one Zeller (Tyler) on the roster.\n\nThe Cavs felt Bennett had the most upside from the group. That hasn’t been the case yet, but fans, media and the coaches just have to be patient with the 6-foot-8, 259-pounder.\n\nNBA TV analyst Chris Webber, though, has become a big fan of Oladipo.\n\n‘He’s shown me that his athletic ability transcends to the NBA,’ he said. ‘I wanted to know that, especially as a ‘2’ guard, as a ‘1’ guard. Defensively he has [had] the impact that I thought he’d have. Scoring-wise, still, he’s aggressive but I still want to see him shoot the ball. He’s penetrating very well, but I tell you what, I have been pleasantly surprised with him, especially on a team so young, not winning. I like his game.’\n\nKobe still not ready\n\nLakers guard Kobe Bryant, still recovering from a torn Achilles’ tendon, has yet to appear in a game.\n\n‘I think the most difficult part is the process I’m going through right now, which is patience,’ he told NBA TV. ‘To me, that’s the hardest part. The game, to me, isn’t necessarily difficult.’\n\nThe Lakers are being cautious with him and not trying to push him to come back too early.\n\nRumor mill\n\n— The Cavs signed point guard Matt Dellavedova to a two-year, $1.3 million deal. A source said only $100,000 is guaranteed.\n\n— Two first-year head coaches have had their hands full in the early going with their strong-willed teams. Denver coach Brian Shaw has been undecided with who he was going to start at power forward (Kenneth Faried has three starts and former Cavs forward/center J.J. Hickson has two). That’s not the only issue on the team. Shaw replaced George Karl, who was fired after earning Coach of the Year honors.\n\n— Grizzlies coach Dave Joerger also replaced Lionel Hollins. The players respected Hollins and all of them didn’t agree with the move. The Grizzlies are run with a tight budget. Some in the league think they will eventually move power forward Zach Randolph.\n\nn Keep a close eye on what goes on in Chicago with veteran forward Luol Deng. His contract will expire in June. ‘I definitely want to stay here,’ Deng told ESPN The Magazine’s Chris Broussard. ‘I would love to play here my whole career.’ He’s making $14.27 million this season and might have to take a major pay cut if he returns to the Bulls. If the Cavs can’t re-sign LeBron James this summer, the 6-9 Deng could be a target.\n\n— Bryant discussed some of his differences with ex-teammate Dwight Howard, now with Houston. ‘Well, I mean, you know, we have two different personalities,’ he told NBA TV. ‘There’s a certain way I believe you have to approach the game in order to win championships. He had a different way that he felt worked best, and because of that, it was tough to see eye to eye on a daily basis. But [the] second half of the season, I felt we played pretty darn well. To go from where we were, being out of the playoffs at the All-Star break, to getting into the playoffs. Unfortunately, I went down with an injury, but had I not, I think we would’ve given San Antonio a serious run for it.’\n\nn Former Cavs point guard Andre Miller could be dealt by Denver this season. They have Nate Robinson as a decent backup to starter Ty Lawson. Miller will make $5 million this season. Only $2 million is guaranteed of his $4.65 million deal for 2014-15.\n\n— Utah coach Tyrone Corbin could be on the hot seat already after the Jazz’s 0-6 start (as of Saturday morning). He doesn’t have a contract for next season.\n\n— Hawks general manager Danny Ferry, formerly in Cleveland as a player and front-office executive, was upset after point guard Jeff Teague was injured tripping over a baseline attendant in Tuesday’s game. ‘The courts can be obstacle courses because of the cameramen and team staff parked around its perimeter,’ Ferry told the Atlanta Journal Constitution. ‘It’s not safe. The league should address the issue more and I am hopeful they will in the near future. Until then, teams need to do a better job enforcing the current standards. Player safety always has to be a huge priority.’\n\n— Mavericks owner Mark Cuban hasn’t always gotten along with retiring NBA commissioner David Stern. ‘I love David,’ he said. ‘David and I have banged heads a couple times and the truth be told, David Stern made me. Nobody knew who Mark Cuban was until he started fining the hell out of me and sending me to work at Dairy Queen. So, he made my job of selling tickets a lot easier. But, David took us internationally. And even when I came in, I wasn’t a big proponent of international and David was there. David was a big proponent of digital, of the Internet. I remember sitting down talking to him, even before I bought the team, he invited me in to talk about streaming and the Internet. Despite the fact we disagreed on a lot of things, we really agreed on far more.’"
