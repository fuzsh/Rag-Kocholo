        "text": "If center Andrew Bynum misses the entire preseason, the Cavaliers don’t seem to think it will be the end of the world.\n\nThe 7-foot, 285-pounder missed the entire 2012-13 season after having surgery on both knees.\n\nThe former All-Star center signed a two-year, $24.5 million contract with the Cavs in the offseason. Only $6 million is guaranteed.\n\nThe Cavs’ goal appears to be getting Bynum ready for the regular season. If he misses the majority of the preseason, so be it is the feeling from the team.\n\nCavs media day is Monday and all eyes will be on Bynum. However, don’t expect to see Bynum on the practice court when training camp begins on Tuesday.\n\nCavs coach Mike Brown said recently there’s been no timetable established for Bynum’s return. He hasn’t started court work yet, but he’s running on a treadmill.\n\n“My concern is that he’s 100 percent healthy,” Brown said. “I’m not in any rush to get him back. Obviously, it would be great if he’s ready for opening day. If he’s not, I’m more than OK with it. We have a number of guys ready to step up.”\n\nBrown coached Bynum with the Lakers in 2011-12, his lone All-Star appearance. He was also second-team All-NBA. Brown highly recommended the Cavs to sign the center.\n\n“He wants to be great,” Brown said. “He’s agile and athletic for a guy that size. It was an easy decision. He could easily be the best center in the game. He has the skills and the tools to be one of the best ever, too.”\n\nThe Cavs have noticed that Bynum has a strong work ethic. When a player that owns two championship rings works hard, it could rub off on the other players.\n\nTwo days after he signed with the Cavs in July, Bynum broke his lease on his apartment in Atlanta and moved to Cleveland. He’s been a fixture at Cleveland Clinic Courts ever since.\n\n“We’re cautiously optimistic,” Cavs general manager Chris Grant said.\n\nHe’s also not concerned that Bynum could miss training camp.\n\n“When we signed him, we knew there was some risk,” he said. “He’s done some stuff on the court, but not a lot. We’ve seen significant process.”\n\nBrown said he’s not necessarily making the call on Bynum.\n\n“It’s not going to be determined by me,” he said. “It will be determined by how his body responds and what the trainers say.”\n\nAnthony Bennett, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2013 draft from UNLV, has been cleared for basketball activity. He’s been scrimmaging five-on-five and dunking. He has recovered from a torn labrum.\n\n“His shoulder is fine,” Grant said. “There is going to be some rust there with him. He’s in a good spot. He’s healthy.”"
