        "text": "Everything you need to know about Andrew Bynum\n\nThe Pacers announced the signing of free agent center Andrew Bynum Saturday morning.\n\nThe mercurial Bynum was a straight-from-high-school phenom with the Los Angeles Lakers, where he averaged 18.7 points and 11.8 rebounds in 2011-12. He was a key piece in the Lakers trade for Dwight Howard, landing in Philadelphia as part of the three-team deal with Orlando, but never played a game for the 76ers.\n\nHe signed a two-year $24.5-million contract with Cleveland this summer but only $6 million was guaranteed if he was waited by Jan. 7. Bynum averaged 8.4 points and 5,3 rebounds with the Cavaliers, was suspended after 24 games, traded to Chicago then waived before the rest of the contract would have to be paid.\n\nHere is what you need to know about Bynum:\n\nIt was first reported Bynum would be suspended by Cleveland by Yahoo Sports on Dec. 28. \"He doesn't want to play basketball anymore,\" a league source told Yahoo Sports.\n\nThe Cavaliers traded Bynum and draft picks to Chicago for forward Luol Deng on Jan. 7 and the Bulls almost immediately released Bynum.\n\nIndyStar's Bob Kravitz suggested the Pacers should sign the controversial center after he was released by the Chicago Bulls, saying:\n\nYou think Bynum is a physical mess and a mental midget who has pouted his way out of Philadelphia and Cleveland. All of that is true. ... There's a lot to love about the Pacers as they're presently constituted, but there are areas where they could handle improvement. One of those areas is backup center, where Ian Mahinmi has played reasonably well, but isn't a game-changer like Bynum can potentially be.\n\nCan you imagine the Heat having to contend with two 7-footers like Hibbert and Bynum in a playoff series? Who's going to defend them? The tattered remains of Greg Oden? Birdman? I don't want the Pacers to mess with their core, but signing Bynum wouldn't alter anything, except maybe mean trading away Mahinmi.\n\nIt was recently reported Bynum wanted more than the $1.3-million veteran's minimum to sign:\n\nBynum was a key piece in the Howard trade but his often-injured knees kept from from playing a game with the 76ers, including a setback suffered while bowling.\n\nOn April 25, 2011, Sports Illustrated published a fascinating profile on the then Lakers phenom:\n\nHe did not go to college and never finished a full season at St. Joseph High in Metuchen, N.J. He never led the team in scoring or shots. He sat out the fourth quarter of his last game. He made his decision to turn pro just two weeks before the draft, and because he was not invited to the green room, he bought a ticket and sat in the stands in the theater at Madison Square Garden. The rebuilding Lakers acknowledged that he had no advanced post moves, limited stamina and a physique that portended future injuries, but they still took him 10th, with their highest pick in more than a decade. When general manager Mitch Kupchak spoke after the draft at his alma mater, Brentwood High in Long Island, a boy came up to him and said, \"Mr. Kupchak, I played against Andrew Bynum in AAU, and he wasn't very good. What do you see in him?\""
