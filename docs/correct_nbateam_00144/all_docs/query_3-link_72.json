        "text": "The Cleveland Cavaliers are determined to unload Andrew Bynum in a trade after their partnership with the former All-Star center has rapidly deteriorated, league sources told Yahoo Sports.\n\nThe Cavaliers have no intention of Bynum ever playing another game for them, a source with direct knowledge of the franchise's plans told Yahoo Sports after the team announced Saturday it has suspended Bynum indefinitely for conduct detrimental to the team.\n\nThe Cavs believe they will benefit from no longer having to force him into the lineup when it clearly wasn't working.\n\n\"He doesn't want to play basketball anymore,\" a league source told Yahoo Sports.\n\nThe Cavs also canceled the scheduled Andrew Bynum Fathead giveaway they had planned for Sunday night's game against the Golden State Warriors. Instead, fans age 14 and under will be given a voucher to redeem for a different Fathead tradeable pack for five consecutive weeks. The 14-and-under fans also will receive a voucher for two tickets to an upcoming game. Cavs owner Dan Gilbert owns the Fathead company.\n\nThe Cavaliers believe Bynum has been a \"disruptive\" presence within the team and have lost hope the partnership can be salvaged, sources said. Bynum often expressed a lack of desire to play and practice and was convinced by the Cavaliers not to quit previously, sources said.\n\nOther teams that met with Bynum during his free agency last offseason were concerned about his desire to play and commitment to continue the rehab needed for him to play in the NBA after repeated knee problems, sources said.\n\nBynum, 26, signed a two-year deal worth $24.8 million with the Cavs prior to the season. Only $6 million of the $12.2 million Bynum is due this season is guaranteed if he is waived before Jan. 7. He could be attractive to teams looking to shed some salary because they could acquire him for a player with a similar contract and save $6 million by waiving Bynum.\n\nBynum also could try to negotiate a buyout with the Cavaliers and seek to sign a contract for the veteran's minimum with a contending team if he clears waivers.\n\nBynum did not travel with the team to Boston for Saturday's game against the Boston Celtics. The Cavaliers said he has been excused from all team activities indefinitely.\n\nBynum has averaged 8.4 points, 5.3 rebounds and 19.5 minutes in 24 games with the Cavaliers. He had four points and one rebound in 17 minutes in a 127-125 double overtime loss to the Atlanta Hawks on Thursday.\n\nBynum won two championships with the Los Angeles Lakers but has missed repeated time throughout his career because of knee injuries. He did not play a single game for the Philadelphia 76ers last season after they acquired him from the Lakers."
