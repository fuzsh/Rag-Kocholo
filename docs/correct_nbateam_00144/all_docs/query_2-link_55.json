        "text": "PHILADELPHIA â€” Philadelphia 76ers center Andrew Bynum has completed his rehabilitation from season-ending knee surgery and is set to resume basketball workouts next week.\n\nBynum's agent, David Lee, told The Associated Press on Monday night there's \"not a concern in the world\" that Bynum will be ready for training camp.\n\nHe also said he had no conversations with the Sixers and does not expect any kind of deal with the team before the 7-foot center becomes a free agent on July 1.\n\nLee says Bynum will get a jump on his regular offseason workouts by starting next week in Atlanta instead of his usual time in August.\n\nBut where? Likely not with the team he failed to play a single game for because of bone bruises in his knees. Bynum was acquired last summer in a four-team trade that saw the Sixers deal Andre Iguodala to Denver and Nikola Vucevic to Orlando\n\n\"Philly will do what Philly does. I can't control it,\" Lee said. \"Next week, I have a feeling I'll be meeting with a couple of teams.\"\n\nBynum did not receive an enthusiastic endorsement from new general manager and president Sam Hinkie at his introductory press conference in May.\n\n\"I think of Andrew like the thousands of other young men walking around the world that are unrestricted free agents that have potential to play NBA basketball,\" Hinkie said. \"He is one of those. I'm duty bound to consider them and look at them. All of them.\"\n\nLee laughed off the comment.\n\n\"I read that Sam considers Andrew one of 3,000 players trying to make it into the NBA,\" Lee said. \"I assume Sam's going to lunch with 3,000 people.\"\n\nHe said Bynum completed his rehab before he was videotaped dancing in Spain about two weeks after Philadelphia's season ended. Bynum is set to attend this weekend's Formula One race, the British Grand Prix. Bynum is friends with series driver Lewis Hamilton.\n\nBynum insisted from training camp he would play this season, only to shut it down for good on March 18. He then underwent season-ending arthroscopic surgery on both knees. Bynum earned $16.5 million this season and is set to become an unrestricted free agent.\n\nThe Sixers also still need a coach more than two months after Doug Collins resigned."
