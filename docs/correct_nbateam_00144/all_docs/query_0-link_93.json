        "text": "Andrew Bynum could become one of our game’s great giants (I mean, we’ll see), a man whose (occasional) power and presence will make him a transcendent star (wait, really?).\n\nAfter knocking off the Nuggets, the Lakers saw their season end last week, in part because Andrew Bynum wasn’t really Andrew Bynum.\n\nShoot, against the Thunder, he was as intimidating as Andrew McCarthy. In one game, Bynum was minus-16, in another he was minus-24. He never scored more than 20 points. He shot 2-for-13 in Game 3 — and that was the game L.A. won.\n\nIn one game against Denver, he blocked 10 shots; in the five games against Oklahoma City, he blocked nine.\n\nSo, what does one make of Bynum, who, following his disappearance in round two, made the all-NBA second team?\n\nRight away, he’s only 24. And as they say in basketball, big men take the longest to develop. But isn’t he, like, developed? He’s been in the league since he was 17 and he’s a fourteener with legs out there.\n\nThe lightning-rod Lakers will make moves this summer, their brass told reporters last week. After all, L.A. was swept in the second round last May and won just one game in the second round this May.\n\nThe Lakers have the option to give Bynum a max contract this summer. One could argue that if you have a second-team all-NBA center you can lock up, you lock him up.\n\nBut could the Lakers woo the first-team center, Dwight Howard? And is Bynum truly the type of player (and person) you want to build around, considering that he still would be under contract when or if Kobe Bryant fades away?\n\nBynum plays defense — occasionally. He doesn’t have much of a shot. He’s maddening — sometimes for the other team, but sometimes for his team.\n\nAnd while he’s had adjectives thrown at him like double-teams, lately the prevailing one is “hateable.” He is, after all, the guy who parks illegally in handicap spots, who infamously elbowed J.J. Barea and who casually called close-out games “easy” (and then lost two of them in a row to the Nuggets).\n\nI was stunned the other night when I tweeted from @nuggetsnews: OK Nuggets fans. lets have some fun — what would you be willing to give up for Bynum, assuming Lakers shake things up?\n\nWithin a minute, I received six “don’t want hims.”\n\nI soon got dozens of tweets. Occasionally, one would methodically explain how Bynum is still really, really good, and no one with the Nuggets sniffed an all-NBA team.\n\nBut check out these snippets of the overwhelming tweet majority:\n\n@SethMcCarthy888: no no I don’t want andrew bynum on the Nugs. Ill take our McGee and Mozzy over him anyday!\n\n@JStreetCL: I wouldn’t want Bynum on the nuggets if they gave him to us!!\n\n@lonerganjack: Melo had great numbers, but his head wasn’t in it. Same with Bynum.\n\n@RyanSev23: Dude doesn’t love the game. Out there picking up a paycheck.\n\n@Smooth_Operatah: Fans like to root for their team. Bynum is a very hard player to root for. Period.\n\nI think Bynum will be a force for many years, but I don’t see him being a Hakeem Olajuwon-type winner. Every summer, folks wonder: Is next year the year (insert player here) takes his game to the next level?\n\nBynum did elevate his game in the regular season, no question. But with Bynum as a key player the past two postseasons, the Lakers have infamously fallen apart.\n\nWhen a guy has a bad attitude and plays badly when it matters, it makes one wonder how things will change — let alone, when.\n\nBenjamin Hochman: 303-954-1294 or bhochman@denverpost.com\n\nWestern Conference finals\n\nSan Antonio vs. Oklahoma City\n\nGame 1: 6:30 p.m. today at San Antonio, TNT\n\nNo. 1 Spurs: 50-16, first in the Southwest Division\n\nNo. 2 Thunder: 47-19, first in Northwest Division\n\nPlayer to watch. Thunder forward Kevin Durant is clearly the best player in the conference, ascending in the fourth quarter with a cool confidence that makes for must-see TV.\n\nFactoid. Remember when Denver won at San Antonio on March 4? The Spurs have gone 33-4 since then, including 18 straight wins. Bottom line. This will be basketball’s version of the 1990s Cowboys vs. 49ers in the conference finals.\n\nThe Post’s pick: Thunder in seven"
