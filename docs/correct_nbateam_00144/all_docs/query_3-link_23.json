        "text": "It's a new year in the NBA, a year where LeBron James is the best player on the planet, the San Antonio Spurs are the team to beat in the Western Conference and the New York Knicks are completely dysfunctional. Okay, so that might have been cut-and-pasted from the start of last year, but this might indeed be a brand new year for the NBA, one where potential postseason contenders have to survive serious injuries to their best players, where Andrew Bynum faces an uncertain future and... Wait, none of these really scream \"current news\" either, do they?\n\nThe latest Andrew Bynum experiment failed\n\nThat's the thing about low risk, high reward situations, sometimes the risk still wins out. After Andrew Bynum earned the title Most Disappointing Part Of the Dwight Howard Trade with the 2012-13 Philadelphia 76ers, where injuries kept him off the court for the entire regular season, the fragile and controversial center faced an uncertain future. In the end, the Cleveland Cavaliers signed him to a fairly reasonable two-year, $12 million contract with the hope he could help the team make their first playoff push since they lost that LeBron guy.\n\nThe plan came to a sudden and unambiguous end when Cleveland announced they were suspending Bynum indefinitely for \"conduct detrimental to the team\" and seeking a trade partner. Although Bynum was actually healthy enough to actually play basketball on occasion this season, making it a step up from his tenure in Philadelphia, the swiftness with which the Cavaliers cut him, the fact that the team is currently paying him to stay away and the vagueness of the \"conduct\" explanation suggests there's something else going on here.\n\nThe story that has gained the most traction is that Andrew Bynum just doesn't like basketball and utterly lacks motivation, which seems like two things a team would try to keep secret if they were still trying to trick teams into trading for him. (Not that the Cavaliers front office isn't capable of shooting themselves in the foot like that.) Of course, whenever you admit \"off the field\" issues, that always invites rumors, just ask Delonte West. In this case any salacious rumors that one has might have heard about Bynum are most likely complete bunk, and quite honestly completely unnecessary at this point in Bynum's career as far as explaining why a team would no longer want him.\n\nWhat's next for Andrew Bynum? Perhaps a return to the one place that Bynum has ever had any success, as the Los Angeles Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers have been discussing a trade that would send Pau Gasol to Cleveland. It's the kind of trade that sparks far more questions about the Lakers than the Cavaliers: Has Gasol become a big enough distraction (he has recently been critical of Lakers head coach Mike D'Antoni) that L.A. is willing to trade problems with Cleveland? Do they look at their past success and think that they could be the one team that could get something out of Bynum? Have the Lakers finally decided to tank? (Spoiler alert: It's probably part of a clever trick to save money.)\n\nNobody gets out of this NBA season alive\n\nWhile the Andrew Bynum situation might be grabbing all the headlines, Cleveland encountered a potentially even bigger problem on Tuesday night when guard Kyrie Irving felt what he described as a \"pop\" in his left knee in a loss to the Indiana Pacers. Scheduled to have a MRI there is a serious chance that Cleveland's franchise player might be the latest star to join an ever-increasing list of key players current missing time due to injury.\n\nThe NBA's biggest loss at the end of 2013 was Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook, out indefinitely with his third major knee operaton. He joins the Chicago Bulls' Derrick Rose and the Los Angeles Lakers' Kobe Bryant, as one of the All-Star players whose return from injury was supposed to be among the major stories of the NBA season who will now be out for the foreseeable future. Worse yet, much like with Rose and Bryant, there are now serious questions about Westbrook's long-term health and about whether he will be able to maintain his current all-out style of play while maintaining a NBA career.\n\nIt's not the worst possible news for the Thunder, as, unlike Derrick Rose, Westbrook is scheduled to return sometime after the All-Star Break. In the meantime, Kevin Durant will have the opportunity to make his case for NBA MVP as he will once again have to carry his team's offense from here until his partner's return. Plus, at some point, the Thunder's performance without their point guard will be enough evidence that NBA fans who believe that Oklahoma City would be better off without Westbrook will have to find some other insane cause, perhaps the \"vaccines cause autism\" movement or a search for Obama's Kenyan birth certificate.\n\nWhile it's not the ideal circumstance for the Thunder, they find themselves in a better position than the Atlanta Hawks who will be without big man Al Horford for the rest of the season. Before Horford suffered the torn pectoral in a 127-125 double overtime win over the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Hawks were looking like the frontrunners in the There Has To Be A Third Good Team In The Eastern Conference Right? sweepstakes, their 18-14 record puts them just behind the Indiana Pacers and Miami Heat. The fact that losing their best player for the season won't be enough to fully remove the Hawks from the race for third place in the East, probably just underlines what an unaccomplished accomplishment that might end up being.\n\nAl Horford's injury might open up the Eastern Conference for the currently 14-14 Washington Wizards. At the very least, the Wizards are the first NBA team to receive better-than-hoped-for injury news this season. While it looked like they were going to be without guard Bradley Beal for an extended period of time when he injured his knee in a 120-98 loss against the Minnesota Timberwolves, he returned the very next game, scoring 15 points in a win over the Detroit Pistons. It's not only the first sign of good news about an injured NBA player this season, it's also the first non-catastrophic injury news a Washington sports team has received in almost a decade.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns are officially for real\n\nEric Bledsoe's first game against his old team was such an epic beatdown that some Los Angeles Clippers fans fans wondered, if only briefly, whether they had kept the wrong point guard in Chris Paul. The Suns defeated the Clippers 107-88 at home, in a game that was over before the end of the first quarter. It was the kind of statement win that made it difficult to remember which of these two teams was expected to compete for the top slot of the Western Conference and which appeared to be clearly tanking.\n\nHow thorough of a Suns win was this? Goran Dragic had 26 points and eight assists, and would have had more if Phoenix hadn't sat him for the entire fourth quarter. Gerald Green, normally the team's designated dunker, played the role of the league's least probable long-distance shooter with five three-pointers off the bench. In the middle of the lineup was Eric Bledsoe, the backup point guard that the Clippers traded away in the offseason for the currently hurt J.J. Redick, who many around the team believed could have been the starting point guard on a contending team. They just never expected that contending team to be the 2013-14 Phoenix Suns.\n\nThe Suns were supposed to be the the worst team in the Western Conference, their offseason seemed to mostly be around stripping away potential assets and aiming for a top slot in the upcoming Andrew Wiggins/Jabari Parker Draft. Instead, the Phoenix Suns have been consistently competitive in the difficult Western Conference, a start that is looking less and less flukey the deeper we get into the NBA season. They currently have a 19-11 record, better than the Houston Rockets and Golden State Warriors, two of last year's contenders that had made improvements over the offseason, and they, and not that other team from LA, are currently the Clippers' biggest competition in the Pacific Division. That's probably not something Steve Nash was expecting to happen quite as quickly when he left for the Los Angeles Lakers after thinking the Suns' rebuilding process would take too long.\n\nNew York basketball looks forward to a new year\n\nThere may be no more fitting last image to have of 2013 in the NBA than watching a Western Conference contender blow out a team from New York. The San Antonio Spurs beat the Brooklyn Nets 113-92 on New Year's Eve to provide a fitting ending for a year that was supposed to spark a basketball revival in New York, but instead ended in a flurry of embarrassment and disappointment.\n\nAt least with the Brooklyn Nets (10-21), this year's bad news has mostly centered around injuries (center Brook Lopez's broken foot would be a huge blow for any team) and trades that haven't worked out (count former Boston Celtics Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett among those most likely shocked that their former team is more of a contender). The New York Knicks (9-21) ended 2013 with a 115-100 loss to the Toronto Raptors on Saturday, were an embarrassment that transcended sports, a \"how not to\" guide for any high-profile business flush with cash to spend but lacking any knowledge on how to correctly spend it. Only last week came the news that the Knicks' \"plan\" for somehow turning the franchise around was to hope Boston point guard Rajon Rondo demanded a trade to New York because, hey, everybody wants to play in New York right?\n\nPerhaps there was no more revealing look at the 2013 New York Knicks than the New York Post's interview with owner James Dolan, conducted in the midst of the Knicks' \"surprising even for the Knicks\" late Fall free-fall, where the nearly-universally-despised owner spoke more about his love of Don Henley and the Eagles than about basketball matters (beyond letting it slip that he considered Carmelo Anthony to be on the same level as LeBron James). As we've seen this week in Cleveland, there are ways to get rid of a player who apparently doesn't care about basketball enough, but there are no such options when it's the ownership that doesn't seem to give a damn.\n\nOne promising bit of news came out at the tail end of 2013 for Knicks fans, as the organization (finally) cut Chris Smith to make room for big man Jeremy Tyler. The team were keeping Chris Smith, who was clogging up all potential roster changes no matter how badly needed, as an apparent favor to his brother JR. While replacing Smith with Tyler may not make much of a difference, it's at least a sign that the team is attempting to shed the \"inmates running the asylum\" label that they have earned. Meanwhile, JR Smith responded in the universal language of NBA stars: passive-aggressive social media posts that reference overrated Scorsese movies.\n\nOther things we've learned\n\nThe \"Nickname Jersey\" game between the Miami Heat and the Brooklyn Nets is set for January 10th. As we've discussed here earlier, this is a bigger deal for some players more than others.\n\nTony Parker probably should have known better.\n\nJust when it looked like the NBA, refreshingly enough, was not getting swamped in the \"unwritten rules\" debate that's taking all the fun out of the MLB, players are now apparently required to apologize for making after-the-whistle dunks?\n\nDamian Lillard vs Tyreke Evans for the win, FTW\n\nRussell Westbrook's injury was enough to bring Free Darko-founder Bethlehem Shoals out of quasi-retirement to make a plea to the Basketball Gods."
