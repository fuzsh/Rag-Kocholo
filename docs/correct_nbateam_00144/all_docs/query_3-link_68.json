        "text": "No centers? That might be the prevailing wisdom in NBA personnel circles, but we beg to differ. Try filling out a list of the best centers in the league, and you’ll be surprised at some of the names that don’t land in the Top 10—\n\n,\n\n,\n\nand\n\namong them. True, the center spot has evolved, and there are more power-forward types manning the position, but that has been part of the game’s evolution in recent years. They might not have prototype center builds, but guys like\n\nand\n\nhave the skill to excel at the position.\n\nHere’s how the league’s top centers stack up:\n\nCredentials: 20.6 points, 14.5 rebounds, 2.1 blocks, 57.3 percent shooting, three-time Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nThe skinny: It was a rough year for Howard, at first wanting out of Orlando, flip-flopping on that subject, going back to wanting out, seeking to get his coach fired and thoroughly embarrassing himself along the way. Still, look at his numbers. The guy dominates the paint. The free-throw shooting continued to take a downward turn (49.1 percent), and that remains his Achilles’ heel.\n\nScouting view: “I am not sure he was trying all that hard last year, but he was still a great player. Obviously, the effort will be there this year, and he is going to make sure everyone knows he is the best center in the league. Defensively and on the boards, I have never seen a guy his size with that kind of athleticism combined with instincts. That is what sets him apart.”\n\nCredentials: 18.7 points, 11.8 rebounds, 1.9 blocks, 55.8 percent shooting.\n\nThe skinny: Bynum was able to stay healthy last season, and in terms of his future growth, that is probably the biggest concern. He has blossomed into an All-Star big man who sometimes does a knuckleheaded thing or two, but whose talent is not in question.\n\nScouting view: “I think you’ve got to be pleased with the way he has come along. He is still a young player, and some of the things he did to tick off his coaches were the result of immaturity. But he has made a lot of strides defensively, he is a very good post defender and protects the rim. The one area he is going to need work is handling double-teams, and he will see those a lot in Philadelphia.”\n\nCredentials: 15.8 points, 8.2 rebounds, 2.9 assists, 1.0 blocks, 50.3 percent shooting, 85.7 percent free-throw shooting.\n\nThe skinny: An injury to Jermaine O’Neal finally allowed Doc Rivers enough ammunition to convince Garnett that he should move to center, and once that happened, Garnett seemed to be reborn. After the All-Star break, he averaged 17.0 points and 8.5 rebounds, and he carried that into the postseason, when he averaged 19.2 points and 10.3 rebounds.\n\nScouting view: “Moving him to center changed everything. He didn’t seem to trust his post game, he likes playing at the elbow and being a high-low passer. He is still good at that. But you saw down the stretch and in the playoffs, he still has a heck of a post game.”\n\nCredentials: 14.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 48.2 percent shooting, 74.8 percent free-throw shooting.\n\nThe skinny: Boosted in part by an injury to Zach Randolph, Gasol bounced back from a so-so performance in ’10-'11 to earn an All-Star spot last year. Still the Grizzlies are paying both Gasol and Randolph big money, and the possibility that one could be moved this year remains.\n\nScouting view: “He is a classic big man, he needs to score in the paint and out of his post game. He is very good working off of either block, and can make enough of the short and midrange shots to be effective. What is strange, though, is that he can be passive going for rebounds. That is easily his biggest hole.”\n\nCredentials: 15.4 points, 9.7 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 52.1 percent shooting.\n\nThe skinny: Monroe began to put things together last year, having a breakout campaign as an NBA sophomore. There is much he needs to improve, but at the same time, he clearly is the future of the Pistons, and should center Andre Drummond develop into a quality starter, Detroit will be dangerous down the road.\n\nScouting view: “He is very skilled offensively, shooting the ball, passing the ball, everything. He is only going to get better as a rebounder, and he is already pretty good. The big question is defense, and that’s the case with any big man with his experience level. You look at how smart he is, and I think the defense will come to him eventually.”\n\nCredentials: 12.8 points, 8.8 rebounds, 2.0 blocks, 49.7 percent shooting.\n\nThe skinny: Two year ago, Hibbert was a popular preseason pick for Most Improved. Turns out, that prognostication was a year early. Last year, Hibbert finally put together all the elements of his size and skill, developing an array of moves and some much-needed consistency. If the Pacers run more of the offense through him, he is only going to get better.\n\nScouting view: “He is a pure center. He is huge (7-2) and he has a hook shot he can knock down with either hand in the lane. That is a lost art, but he has it down and there is no one who can stop him with it. He makes his jumpers, too. He was an All-Star last year and he deserved it.”\n\nCredentials: 18.0 points, 7.9 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 48.7 percent shooting, 82.1 percent free-throw shooting.\n\nThe skinny: Much like Garnett, necessity has pushed Bosh into the center role, and it might turn out to be a good fit for him. He has the smarts, athleticism and intensity to defend the paint, and though he isn’t a go-to option in the post, he has enough diversity in his game to be effective offensively.\n\nScouting view: “Look at the playoffs, he was a very good 5-man throughout. I have been hearing he is getting stronger, and that is really all he needs to be able to hang in there in the paint. He has the ability, he can be a matchup problem for other centers because he can make 17-footers. Defensively, playing with LeBron (James) has, I think, helped him see the approach he needs to take.”\n\nCredentials: 11.3 points, 9.9 rebounds, 1.4 blocks, 67.9 percent shooting, reigning Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nThe skinny: Chandler stays within himself offensively, mostly sticking with dunks and at-the-basket finishes. According to Hoopdata.com, 4.7 of the 5.7 field goals he attempts come at the rim, which is the reason he shoots such a ridiculously high percentage. Chandler, though, is only functional on offense—it’s on the defensive end that he makes his presence felt, and the way he transformed the Knicks from 28th in defensive efficiency in ’10-’11 to 11th in ‘11’-12 is the reason he is on this list.\n\nScouting view: “His communication is underrated. He takes the floor and runs a defense the way a point guard runs an offense, and a lot of teams don’t have that, so you get breakdowns, you get no accountability. Having him out there changes that for any team.”\n\nCredentials: 19.2 points, 9.6 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 1.7 blocks, 49.2 percent shooting.\n\nThe skinny: Jefferson never made the leap to elite big man, but he is a potent offensive force who remains a near-All Star. Jefferson is deft in the lane, always able to find a way to get off a pretty good shot, and he is consistently around 49-50 percent shooting. He has come a long way in terms of passing and handling double-teams, and last year, averaged a career-high 2.2 assists and just 1.0 turnovers.\n\nScouting view: “What is really weird with Al is that he has such good footwork on the offensive end but defensively, he just doesn’t move well. He can defend the post, he is not bad at that. But put him in a pick-and-roll and he gets lost.\"\n\nCredentials: 18.1 points, 11.0 rebounds, 1.2 blocks, 1.5 steals.\n\nThe skinny: There is a widely negative view of Cousins around the league, and it has been well-earned. He was seen as the driving force in the firing of Paul Westphal last year, and he has incurred numerous fines and penalties for violations of team rules. But he seemed to get himself straightened out once Keith Smart took over as coach, and averaged 19.8 points and 10.4 rebounds in the final two months of the year.\n\nScouting view: “Shot selection, getting comfortable within his own game, handling double-teams, controlling himself defensively, all of these things are things he needs to learn. He has the potential to be a dominating big man, though he would be better off at power forward because of his shooting ability. He is in his second year. He has plenty of time to get better, and the stuff he needs to learn is only going to come through experience.”\n\n-- This article originally appeared on SportingNews.com\n\n• LaMarcus Aldridge is Sporting News'\n\n• Nicolas Batum is Sporting News'\n\n• Chris Paul is Sporting News'\n\n• Kobe Bryant is Sporting News'"
