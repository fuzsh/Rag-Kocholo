        "text": "Center Andrew Bynum, suspended for his team’s previous two games for a flagrant foul 2 against Minnesota Timberwolves forward Michael Beasley last week, said Thursday he’s excited to return to the court Friday night against the Los Angeles Clippers. “[I’m feeling] really good,” Bynum said following practice. “My knee’s feeling all right. Ready to go.”\n\nThe Lakers were hoping for leniency from the league. Bynum isn’t known as a rough player with an angry demeanor. He texted Beasley with an apology Saturday morning, according to reports in Minneapolis. Even the Timberwolves’ coach, former Lakers assistant Kurt Rambis, said the play wasn’t symbolic of Bynum’s typical behavior.\n\nBeasley played in the Timberwolves’ 127-95 loss to Sacramento on Sunday but was reportedly still bothered by his hip and logged only 15 minutes. He had 13 points. “I feel badly … for the team, for the fans,” Phil Jackson said. “Beasley played today. It’s not like he missed a game because of it. There’s a certain element that says if a player is suspended for bringing another player down, he should probably spend the same amount of time out that that player spends out.… ” Not all the Lakers were upset with the league’s decision. “I’m proud of him,” Kobe Bryant said of Bynum. “He earned his stripes.”\n\nThe league handed down its verdict this morning, suspending center Andrew Bynum for two games without pay for thumping Michael Beasley to the court during the fourth quarter of the Lakers’ victory Friday night over the Minnesota Timberwolves. Bynum will sit out tonight’s game against the Portland Trail Blazers and Tuesday’s contest against the Phoenix Suns. Beasley suffered a bruised left hip when he hit the floor.\n\nSome have called Laker big man Andrew Bynum soft. Some have said he needs to get meaner. Potentially in an effort to do just that, Bynum clocked Michael Beasley with an elbow Friday night in Los Angeles. Bynum was immediately hit with a Flagrant 2 foul and was ejected. By rule, Bynum will have to serve a one-game suspension for the foul as well."
