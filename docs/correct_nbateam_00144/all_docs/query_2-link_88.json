        "text": "INDEPENDENCE — Cavaliers general manager Chris Grant said newly signed center Andrew Bynum is “hungry.” And, no, he wasn’t talking about the 7-foot, 285-pounder wanting a double cheeseburger. Bynum, 25, has signed his two-year, $24 million contract with the Cavs, with the second year a team option. In his introductory press conference on Friday at Cleveland Clinic Courts, he said he weighed 305 pounds. He certainly didn’t look overweight. “My playing weight is down to the 280s,” he said. “I have been doing a lot of non-weight bearing exercises to protect my knees.” Bynum said he’d be ready for the start of training camp in October. One of the selling points in signing with the Cavs — other than them offering $6 million guaranteed — was their partnership with the Cleveland Clinic. “Going forward, we’re going to do some functional training and really strengthening my body so that I’m able to play,” he said. “This organization has really laid it out for me.” He’s already moved to Cleveland and will be spending a lot of time with the Cavs’ training staff. He had surgery on both knees on March 19 and is still going through rehabilitation. “The Cavs so far have given me every opportunity to succeed,” he said. “The medical staff is great. They’ve put together a plan going forward. I pretty much just show up and work hard. I really believe in the doctors here and in the training staff. I’m in a different place because after the surgery I feel a lot better than I did last year. “With time off I’ve been able to get the swelling out. I’m just ready to work. I’m going to be in this gym as much as possible to get my game back to the level that I know I can.” He missed the entire 2012-13 season in Philadelphia after the 76ers’ ill-fated trade. The Sixers sent swingman Andre Iguodala to Denver, and center Nikola Vucevic, forward Mo Harkless and a first-round pick to Orlando for Bynum, who made $16.5 million last season. He was never able to get on the court. “I feel getting my career back on track is my whole goal this season,” Bynum said. “I really feel like I can accomplish it. “I had every intention of playing (last season). I showed up. I was in shape. It was an unfortunate situation that it didn’t work out for me there. Going forward here, we have a great plan.” Bynum was the 10th overall pick in the 2005 draft by the Los Angeles Lakers from St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, N.J. In seven NBA seasons, he’s averaged 11.7 points, 7.8 rebounds and 1.6 blocks and has shot 56.6 percent from the field. The two-time NBA champion averaged 18.7 points, 11.8 rebounds and 1.9 blocks in 2011-12 when he was a starter for the Western Conference All-Star team. That was Cavs coach Mike Brown’s first year with the Lakers. “Coach Brown and myself definitely had a great relationship at times, contrary to what people believe,” Bynum said. “My last year under him was my most productive year. He wants to get the ball inside. I’m looking forward to working under him again.” Grant said he’s very excited to add a player of Bynum’s stature. “He’s had an enormous amount of success in this league,” he said. “I know he’s very hungry right now, for which we’re excited. He’s already moved to Cleveland working with our training staff. The doctors at the Cleveland Clinic have done an amazing job pulling together many groups, many parts of their organization to put Andrew in the best position to succeed. “We’re all aware of what his injuries have been. He’s well aware of that, taken ownership of the process. We’re going to do everything we possibly can to put him in a position to succeed.” Bynum wants to return to top form. There are no plans on him playing 50 or 60 games. “I want play a full season,” he said. “There’s no doubt in my mind I can do that. “Going forward, I want to get back to All-Star level.” Bynum said he believes the Cavs can get back in the postseason. “We want to work extremely hard, get this team back in the playoffs and really make some noise,” he said. “The Cleveland fans deserve that. This is definitely a playoff team. We have the talent. “I can’t wait to play with Anderson (Varejao), honestly. He brings a kind of energy and passion to the game. I really haven’t been around that. Obviously I played with Kobe (Bryant), but just from a guy who’s willing to sacrifice everything for the team. I think that goes leaps and bounds inside the locker room. I’m really excited about this roster. We have an opportunity to all rise together and do something special.” Quick shots o Bynum is excited about playing with the Jersey Boys. Bynum, All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving, power forward Tristan Thompson and free-agent acquisition Earl Clark all played high school basketball in New Jersey. “I’m super excited about that,” Bynum said. “We have a great young nucleus of guys here. Obviously, Kyrie’s talent is world renowned.” o Grant said the Cavs needed to waive power forward Kevin Jones and point guard Chris Quinn in order to sign Bynum. Both players had non-guaranteed contracts for next season. o Grant confirmed the Cavs have renounced forward Luke Walton. o The Cavs GM said the Cavs might not be done in free agency. Grant said the Cavs are still sorting through all the numbers under the salary cap. That’s where Michael Blackstone, the Cavs’ executive director of basketball operations, comes into play. He’s the team’s cap guru and works largely in the background. o The Cavs said the press conference for first-round pick Sergey Karasev, the Russian swingman who was the No. 19 overall selection, will be early next week.\n\nOriginally Published: July 19, 2013 at 8:19 a.m."
