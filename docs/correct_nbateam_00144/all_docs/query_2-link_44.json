        "text": "Free agent C Andrew Bynum in Indy\n\nFree agent center Andrew Bynum and his agent are in Indianapolis.\n\nBynum has been a free agent since being released by the Chicago Bulls on Jan. 7 after a trade from the Cleveland Cavaliers. According to earlier reports, the Indiana Pacers were one of several teams to reach out to Bynum.\n\nBynum's agent David Lee told The Indianapolis Star that he and Bynum were in town. According to Lee, Bynum and the Pacers have not reached a contractual agreement.\n\n\"(Bynum) has not signed as yet,\" Lee said on Friday night.\n\nBynum, the 7-foot mercurial center, played in only 24 games this season, averaging 8.4 points on 41.9 percent shooting for the Cavaliers. Bynum missed all of the 2012-13 season with knee problems and last March underwent surgery on both knees. Besides his health, Bynum's commitment has also been called into question.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers drafted Bynum in 2005 and he spent the early part of his career working with Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Over several seasons, Bynum blossomed as an integral component to the Lakers' back-to-back championship runs (2009-2010), however Abdul-Jabbar would later describe him as a \"type of person who walks to the beat of 'a different drummer.'\"\n\n\"When I worked with Andrew, I found him to be bright and hardworking. But I think he got bored with the repetitive nature of working on basketball fundamentals but they are the keys to long term success,\" Abdul-Jabbar posted on his Facebook page after Cleveland had suspended Bynum for 'conduct detrimental to the team,' in December.\n\n\"Andrew has always had the potential to help a team when he puts his heart into it. He just doesn't seem to be consistent with his commitment to the game. That can lead to a lot of frustration for any team that has signed him.\"\n\nWhen not beset by injuries or the perception that he is indifferent to the game, Bynum had been one of the most offensively skilled big men in the NBA. During the Lakers' 2010 NBA title season, Bynum averaged 15.0 points, 8.3 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game.\n\nANDREW BYNUM'S CAREER STATISTICS"
