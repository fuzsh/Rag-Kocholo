        "text": "The Oklahoma City Thunder faced the Los Angeles Lakers last season in their playoff debut and could meet Los Angeles again in the second round if the Thunder moves up to the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference tonight with a Dallas loss and an OKC win.\n\nIf there's a good time to catch a two-time defending champion in the postseason it would be sooner rather than later. Lakers center Andrew Bynum's knee injury Tuesday night leaves the champs looking more vulnerable. That injury also inspired the Question of the Day:\n\nWould the Thunder be favored in a series against the Lakers if Andrew Bynum is out or slowed by a knee injury?\n\nThe Oklahoman's staff weighs in:\n\nColumnist Berry Tramel: No. The Thunder would not be favored. We're talking about the Lakers. Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol and Phil Jackson. So the Lakers would remain the favorite. But the Thunder would win. The Thunder already is a deeper team. The void of Bynum would only enhance OKC's depth advantage. With no Bynum to bother, Kendrick Perkins could wander into other brawls. And Russell Westbrook's drives into the paint would encounter one fewer redwood. The Lakers would be favored. The Thunder would win.\n\nThunder beat writer Darnell Mayberry: I still don't think the Thunder would be favored. The Lakers are still the defending champs and have played without Bynum before. It's not new to them. L.A. also would have home court advantage. So you'd have to give the edge to the Lakers. Bynum has become the Lakers' biggest difference-maker, though. His size, more than Kobe Bryant's greatness, is what gives teams trouble now and make the Lakers such a difficult matchup. Even if the Thunder wouldn't be favored, OKC would give the Lakers fits without Bynum and probably would win.\n\nColumnist Jenni Carlson: An injury to Bynum definitely changes the dynamic. The Lakers would still have Kobe and Gasol and Artest and ... well, you get the idea. This team is tough even with Bynum hobbled or shelved completely. I would still give the Lakers the edge in a series against the Thunder — that squad just has too much experience to be discounted because of an injury to one guy — but it would be a dogfight of a series. I'd predict it would go seven games, and if it ended with a seventh game in Los Angeles, that might be the slight edge that the Lakers would need to win it.\n\nSports editor Mike Sherman: The Lakers are old and looking older. They are disfunctional and looking disfunctionaler. Bynum's knee. Steve Blake's chicken pox (don't laugh. I had them when I was 26 and I thought I was going to die). Ron Artest's disinterest. Lamar Odom's reality show (which is being promoted DURING Laker games at Staples Center). Kobe's interior decorator urges (will experiment on locker room first). Phil Jackson's fatigue. Everyone in purple and gold has spent the last week looking like they were ready to get this thing over with. Not a way to enter the playoffs. So, the Thunder should be favored, and would win a series with the Lakers if Bynum isn't in top form. Pau Gasol wants no part of Kendrick Perkins, and that's precisely who he'd get if Bynum isn't around to absorb Perk's punishment."
