        "text": "There are continued talks between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Orlando Magic. The Magic want to deal Dwight Howard, the Lakers want to land him. The Lakers would probably have to offload Andrew Bynum, but it's not totally likely that he can end up in Orlando because of contract mismatches and all that jazz. It's likely a third team will have to be involved somehow.\n\nRic Bucher fills us in on all the latest happenings.\n\nThe Cavaliers would land Lakers center Andrew Bynum for a package of draft picks and veteran power forward Anderson Varejao, according to one league source. The Lakers would receive Howard for Bynum. Orlando would get Varejao and draft picks. The source said this was merely the framework of a deal being discussed.\n\nMarc Spears also adds in these details.\n\nA deal did not appear imminent, but conversations between the Lakers and Magic have become more frequent in recent days, sources said. A number of obstacles need to be resolved, including the Lakers' desire for Howard to commit to a long-term extension with them. Howard has warmed to the possibility of joining the Lakers after spending his offseason in Los Angeles, sources said, but remains apprehensive about following in the footsteps of Shaquille O'Neal, who left the Magic for Los Angeles 16 years ago.\n\nThe big issue: Will Bynum OR Howard agree to a contract extension with their new teams? All indications are that this won't be the case; neither Bynum nor Howard have shown any indications that they want to give up free agency and the freedom of mobility. This could impede any potential deal in the near future.\n\nTalk about Bynum with Cavs fans by going to Fear the Sword, talk about Howard with Lakers fans by hitting up Silver Screen and Roll, discuss the deal with Magic fans by hitting up Orlando Pinstriped Post.\n\nCheck out the SB Nation NBA YouTube channel and see if you'd be willing to subscribe to more videos."
