        "text": "It's only the day before Thanksgiving but does that mean it's too early to start determining which NBA teams are the best? Yes, in fact that is absolutely what it means, but it's always fascinating to analyze the NBA season's early results. After all, right now the New York Knicks have a better record than the Miami Heat, the Clippers are the more functional team in Los Angeles and somehow the Charlotte Bobcats are over .500. Who knows if any of these things will remain true as the season progresses, but right now this free-for-all makes for some serious intrigue.\n\n1. Yes, the New York Knicks might be for real\n\nIn the comments of last week's 5 Things, \"Menardo\" asked the following question: \"If the Knicks beat the Spurs tomorrow will you.... admit they might be for real?\" Well, the New York Knicks did in fact defeat the San Antonio Spurs 104-100 on Thursday night to improve their record to 6-0. Although the Knicks lost their next game against the Memphis Grizzlies, who may or may not be the best team in the Western Conference (see below), the now 8-1 Knicks still kept pace for the best record in the Eastern Conference. So, yes, this writer is willing to move the Knicks out of that group that includes the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and Shaquille O'Neal's broadcasting talent and say that the Knicks are, in fact, for real.\n\nThat's not saying that the Knicks are a better team than the defending champion Miami Heat, a nine-game sample size is a bit too small to make that call. The Knicks have Carmelo Anthony, one of the game's premiere scorers, Tyson Chandler, one of the best defensive players in the league, and a hot start from J.R. Smith off the bench. In the offseason, the Knicks replaced point guard/worldwide phenomenon/couch-surfer Jeremy Lin with Raymond Felton whose 25 points helped the Knicks knock off the Spurs and the venerable Jason Kidd (although his most notable contribution of late has been in the headband department). So far this season all the pieces seem to be working together. In fact, this Knicks team almost seems to have... good chemistry? Is that even allowed with a Knicks team?\n\nThe question remains: If the Knicks keeping playing at this level, or at something close to it, what will they do with Amar'e Stoudemire once he returns from injury. If you'd ask Knicks management they would say that having an All-Star caliber player like Stoudemire returning to the lineup would be one of those \"good problems to have\", or some other similar sports cliche, but the truth of the matter is that Anthony and Stoudemire have never really clicked together on the court. When Stoudemire returns it would not be shocking if he's expected to play more of a supporting role than he has in the past. For good or ill, this is Carmelo Anthony's team now.\n\n2. Every other day there's a new \"best team in the Western Conference\"\n\nAt the start of the season it looked like the San Antonio Spurs had a claim as being the best team in the West. Then, after the New York Knicks kept their undefeated streak alive by defeating the Spurs, many experts declared that the Memphis Grizzlies were the best team in the Western Conference, especially after they ruined the Knicks' bid to go 82-0. Almost as soon as the Grizzlies became the Western Conference's near-consensus top team, the Denver Nuggets snapped their eight-game win streak. At that point, both the Memphis Grizzlies and the Los Angeles Clippers were on top of the Western Conference standings, and cases could be made for either team. (For instance, one of the Clippers wins was against the Miami Heat, which should count for something.) Basically the West has had a new \"best team\" every few days.\n\nDon't expect this trend to end any time soon. It would be surprising if the Lakers, finally getting stability with new head coach Mike D'Antoni finally on the sidelines, didn't make up the ground they lost during their disastrous start. Meanwhile, the Oklahoma City Thunder share an 8-3 record with the San Antonio Spurs and those previously mentioned Denver Nuggets are more talented than their current 5-6 record indicates. It would be surprising if at least one of these teams didn't have a serious case for being the best team in the West in the upcoming weeks.\n\nUnlike the East, which is likely to come down to the Miami Heat and an underdog of a challenger, the West seems wide open. That's a good thing for basketball fans, especially when the NBA is too often criticized for having an underwhelming regular season. The downside? If this trend continues prepare for a billion \"the wild, wild West\" headlines in sports sections across America.\n\n3. The Charlotte Bobcats are over .500, the Wizards not so much\n\nTwo years ago, Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter was quoted in a story about his team's surprising early success. In the piece, the media savvy Showalter, who spent some time as an ESPN baseball analyst in between coaching gigs, noted the timing of the media attention. Showalter joked that at ESPN they would rush to cover surprise teams early because if reporters waited around too long, those teams were usually not winning anymore.\n\nWith that said, let's talk about the Charlotte Bobcats, who have had a recent stretch of not only being not terrible but actually being something close to good. A victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday night put the Bobcats' record at 5-4, pushing them over the .500 mark. That may not be a cause for celebration with most teams, but the Charlotte Bobcats put up the worst winning percentage in NBA history last season. If you're a Bobcats fan you take any improvement you can find, even if it's just the team being over .500 in November.\n\nSoon after the Bobcats won on Monday night, the Washington Wizards, who continue to play without John Wall, failed to rally against the Indiana Pacers and lost their ninth straight game. Now that the Detroit Pistons have won a few games, this makes the woeful Wall-less Washington Wizards the worst team in the East. The Wizards' 0-9 record is no mirage, if anything they are playing worse that the record indicates. If the Wizards keep this up, this would make the two weakest basketball teams of the last two years the two franchises that have had Michael Jordan as part of their ownership at one point or another. That may not go on his extensive resume (although it's less embarrassing than his acting in \"Space Jam\").\n\n4. The Houston Rockets and Royce White are at odds\n\nThe biggest story surrounding the Houston Rockets this last week had nothing to do with the newly acquired James Harden or anything that happened on the court, it instead involved rookie Royce White and his struggles with general anxiety disorder. The Rockets picked White as the 16th overall selection in the NBA Draft knowing that his condition made it extremely difficult for White to travel by air. The line was that Houston would work to accommodate White's mental health needs going forward, including allowing him to take the bus whenever possible.\n\nLast Tuesday, the Houston Rockets planned to send White to the D-League, which teams often do with talented rookies who aren't getting enough playing time in the bigs. In response, White went on-line and claimed that the Rockets were not holding up their end of the bargain, issuing the following statement:\n\nIn hindsight, perhaps it was not a good idea to be open and honest about my anxiety disorder, due to the current situations at hand that involve the nature of actions from the Houston Rockets. As a rookie, I want to settle into a team and make progress; but since preseason the Rockets have been inconsistent with their agreement to proactively create a healthy and successful relationship. At this point the Rockets are aware of my position and the reason for my absence. Any other response is inaccurate.\n\nReports from the Rockets camp claim that White has had unexcused absences and that they have been fining him for each time he has either missed practice or failed to report to the team-appointed therapist. Even those who sympathize with White's medical condition would find it difficult not to see the Rockets point of view here: illness or no, at some point they expect White to show up to work.\n\nThe situation has gotten tense enough that White has claimed he's willing to actually leave the NBA for the sake of his own well-being. Let's hope it doesn't come to that. On his Twitter account, White makes a compelling argument that he's taking a principled stand on behalf of people who suffer from mental illness. White is thoughtful and clearly passionate, but the problem is that the more he airs out his specific grievances with the Rockets in public, the more his basketball future is in jeopardy. This would be a blow for White, the Rockets and NBA fans in general. Not to mention the fact that he could do a lot more good for the cause of mental health while playing in the league than he could by walking away.\n\n5. Other things we've learned\n\nKevin Durant scored a triple-double during the Oklahoma City Thunder's win against the Golden State Warriors Sunday night. This doesn't seem like it should be a huge piece of breaking news, until you realize that it's Durant's first career triple-double.\n\nSince being traded for Kendrick Perkins, Jeff Green's stint with the Boston Celtics has been more memorable for his health issues and his perhaps overly generous contract. On Wednesday night against the Utah Jazz, Green unleashed those frustrations with this massive one-handed dunk over Al Jefferson.\n\nAndrew Bynum's contributions to the Philadelphia 76ers will be limited to distracting opponents with his crazy hair for the time being, as he suffered another health setback. Bynum injured his left knee while bowling, certainly the most unfortunate thing that's happened in a bowling alley since Walter pulled a gun on Smokey in \"The Big Lebowski\". This news did little to ease 76ers fans worries about both his injury history and his maturity. (Plus his possibly Phil Spector inspired haircut hasn't helped that second cause either.)\n\nBad news for the Cleveland Cavaliers as star player Kyrie Irving will be out for a month with a broken index finger. This is yet another example of the scientific phenomenon known as \"Cleveland Can't Have Nice Things In Sports\".\n\nMy favorite meme of the week: Rap Game Rasheed Wallace, which features the Knicks power forward on the cover of various classic hip-hop albums. It's a simple premise, but it works so well that it's a wonder that it's taken the internet this long to attempt it.\n\nOf course, in real life Rasheed Wallace has had some experience in the rap game, although I really would hesitate to call any of it classic."
