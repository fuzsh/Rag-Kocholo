        "text": "[new_royalslider id=”213″]\n\nSince his glory days in a Lakers uniform, center Andrew Bynum has had quite the tumultuous past two years. After a mix of teams and hairstyles, the one-time NBA All-Star finds himself playing for the team currently leading the Eastern Conference, the Indiana Pacers.\n\n— Celebrate March Madness With 25% Off The Entire Store! —\n\nAccording to Tom Moore of the Bucks County Courier Times, Bynum was considering two other teams before landing with the Pacers:\n\nSince his final season as a Laker, Bynum has been through nothing short of a roller coaster ride. If he actually did re-join the Lakers this season, he would never return as the player he once was.\n\nAfter Bynum was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, he finally got the chance to be the number one option and was on track to become the best center in the game. However, Bynum suffered a setback after bowling and never played a single game for the 76ers.\n\nDespite not playing the entire season, the Cavaliers took a chance on the former Laker. Unfortunately, it didn’t work out either as he was a distraction to his teammates during practice, which he would later admit when he signed with the Pacers."
