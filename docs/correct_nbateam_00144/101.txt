Andrew Bynum went back to familiar championship grounds, re-linking with the Los Angeles Lakers, who allowed him to work out during open runs at their facility, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic. The workout, while unofficial, could serve as the start of a potential reunion between the 30-year-old and his former team after winning two championships in L.A. along with an All-Star bid in 2012.

The 7-footer has been reportedly pursuing a comeback to the NBA after being out of the league for four years after an unsuccessful last two seasons.

After seven seasons with the Lakers, Bynum was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers on a four-team trade that sent Dwight Howard to La La Land, as the Lakers had grown concerned of Bynum's injury woes.

The former champion was the process before The Process, as he was sat out for the entire season after undergoing orthokine treatments on both of his knees to alleviate a severe case of arthritis, which cause most of his absences.

From there, his career derailed, pushing stints with the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Indiana Pacers in 2013-14, which saw a much-less effective version of his former Laker self, ultimately putting his stint in the NBA in borrowed time.

Andrew Bynum has scheduled workouts with several other NBA teams, hoping to get an opportunity to crack a training camp spot before the 2018-19 season gets underway.
