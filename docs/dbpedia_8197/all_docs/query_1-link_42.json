        "text": "Australia-based Canadian-born singer-songwriter Laura Lucas fell in love with storytelling from a young age, and her introspective songwriting, delicate vocals, dreamy instrumentation, and ability to distil complex emotions into song has earned her comparisons to the likes of Lana Del Rey, Phoebe Bridgers, and Taylor Swift.\n\nThis is exactly what you’ll find on her new single “Wake Up, Breathe In”\n\nOccasionally, her two disciplines merge, such as with poem-turned-song Moon Dream, which UK-based blog For the Rabbits described as “a luxurious slice of alt-folk, a tapestry of rich vocal harmonies.” Laura’s work as a poet is “something that shines through in her lyrics and adds another layer of creativity to her songs” (Buzz Music). Her poetry has appeared in various publications such as About Place Journal, Press 53, Iris Literary Journal, and elsewhere.\n\n“Wake Up, Breathe In” is about learning to embrace endings as new beginnings.\n\nOn the track, Laura explains, “While it can be hard to see past the disappointment when a relationship ends, every relationship is a chance to learn and grow. Recognising the positive things you take away from the experience can be so helpful in moving forward.”\n\nCreated alongside a local dream team, co-written with Harrison Storm and produced by Dustin Tebbutt, the dreamy indie folk-pop track is the first single from Laura’s sophomore EP The Dreamer.\n\nHer previous EP, Light the Candle, Hold the Mirror, was released in October 2022."
