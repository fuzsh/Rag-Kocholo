She is of African American, Native American, and white descent. Love had a difficult childhood, raised by a mother with schizophrenia and in foster homes. Her father, who had little involvement in her life, was the jazz musician Preston Love who played the saxophone with Count Basie, Lucky Millinder and Johnny Otis and formed his own band in the 1950s. Love's mother, Wini, had been a singer in Preston's jazz band.\n\nPreston Love Jr., her older half-brother, is a Nebraska politician.\n\nCareer\n\nLove began her performing career at age 16, singing for the prisoners at the Nebraska State Penitentiary.
