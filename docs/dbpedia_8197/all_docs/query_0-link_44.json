She was born May 2, 1972 in Omaha, NE to Rollian Kermith and Jennie Lee (Snow) Bloomquist.\n\nShe grew up in Greenwood NE and attended the Ashland-Greenwood schools. Laura worked various jobs through-out her life, but being a loving mother to her children was her favorite. She enjoyed spending time with family, a good game of Yahtzee and always had a cup of coffee in her hand. She gave much love, and was loved by many. She will be greatly missed.\n\nShe is survived by her children, Justina Cousins, Ryan Bloomquist, Tyler Burza, and Amber Burza; five grandchildren; brothers, Randy (Julie) Kessler of Justice, IL, John (Kim) Kessler of Ponca City, OK and Rollian (Jennifer) Bloomquist of Greenwood NE; sisters, Ruth (Robert) Weed of Delta, CO and Corlynda (Wayne) of Fernley, NV and many, many nieces and nephews.\n\nShe was preceded in death by parents; sister, Marletta Mounce; brother, Chris Kessler and infant daughter, Tamara Bloomquist."
