        "text": "Sentiments from friends and colleagues\n\n\"Tom was a dear friend who I often turned to for advice. He was a visionary, innovator, inspirational leader, and compassionate person. Tom was a quintessential entrepreneur long before entrepreneurialism was ever in vogue. He loved his country, having served in the Marine Corps. He loved his hometown of Oklahoma City, where he headquartered his business. Tom loved his state and responded with alacrity and superb skill when he accepted my appointment as chairman of the Oklahoma Transportation Commission. He was devoted to his dear wife, Judy, their four wonderful children, and many grand and great-grandchildren. He was committed to his faith, and he gave generously, but often quietly, to support education, medical, and other significant initiatives. Cathy and I are heartbroken at his loss, but we are encouraged to know Tom’s legacy will live on through his family, company, and countless kind deeds.” - Frank Keating, Former Oklahoma Governor\n\n“Tom Love is my Oklahoma hero. Together with his loving wife and business partner, Judy, Tom has lived a life of humility, generosity and enormous impact. His deep love for his church, community and country has been abundant and long-lasting. As our grieving hearts accept Tom’s passing, the brokenness is quickly filled with gratitude for his life. Tom was a man of amazing vision, deep faith, and complete devotion to others. He loved God. And he loved people – all kinds of people. None more than his family. May the comfort of our compassionate God be present with his beloved wife, Judy, their children and grandchildren. And all of us. ‘A mighty oak has fallen in the forest and left a gaping hole against the sky.’ But Tom Love’s roots grew so deep that greatness will continue to grow from the many seeds of faith and integrity he planted in others.” - Jane Jayroe-Gamble, broadcaster, author, public official and family friend\n\n“We mourn the passing of our great friend and fellow Oklahoman, Tom Love. Tom represented the finest of our Oklahoma values of humility, honesty, compassion, and service. He exhibited these exceptional core values in every aspect of his remarkable life – faith, family, friends, business, and community. As a husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather and friend, Tom always showed an abundance of goodness and kindness. We salute Tom for a well-lived life and for his invaluable contributions to the betterment of our city, state, and nation. My family sends heartfelt condolences to Judy and the entire family and pray for their comfort in the coming days and weeks. Those who had the pleasure of knowing and working with Tom are better because of it.” - Mike Turpin, Former Attorney General for the State of Oklahoma"
