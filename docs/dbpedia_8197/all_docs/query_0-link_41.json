        "text": "I was born and raised in Grand Island, Nebraska. I grew up at the end of my neighborhood with a window that faced a cornfield - such a Nebraska thing. My kindergarten class had four girls in it, but I went on to graduate in a class of about 160 from Grand Island Northwest in 2014.\n\n​\n\nI started my undergraduate career at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in August 2014 as a double-major in History and Communication Studies. I was president of three organizations, involved in Greek Life, played Club Softball, and was inducted into multiple honor societies, including Phi Beta Kappa. One of my greatest honors, however, was being named Homecoming Queen my senior year alongside my boyfriend of over three years, who was named King. To top it off, he proposed to me on the field - which, had actually been a dream of mine, but I never thought I'd have the opportunity for it to come true.\n\n​\n\nWe got married on September 21, 2019, and were surrounded by friends and family from all walks of life - it was truly the most special day of my life. Now, I work full-time at UNL advising the Student Alumni Association, leading Homecoming planning, strategizing legacy recruitment, and working on various commencement details. I am also pursuing my Masters of History & Masters of Integrated Media Communications part-time.\n\n​\n\nIn addition to my full-time work and studies, I own and operate two small businesses - Laura Elizabeth Photography and Creative Strategy.\n\n​"
