        "text": "What do Squidward, Carl, Jamie Dutton, Buck Rogers, Herb Tarlick, and Niles the Butler all have in common? The actors who play or played those roles are all from the Great State of Arkansas.\n\nSeriously, this list was more shocking than the female actors from Arkansas for me.\n\nBilly Bob Thornton\n\nThere's little doubt the most famous, successful actor to ever come out of Arkansas has to be Billy Bob Thornton, with 99 acting credits according to IMDB, plus writing, directing, producing and much more, Thorton has been in something every year it seems since the late '80s. Talk about a working actor. Oh yeah, he's also Angelina Jolie's Ex.\n\nJosh Lucas\n\nJosh is well known for many roles including the hit series Yellowstone, Sweet Home Alabama, and Ford v Ferrari. IMDB has him listed with 85 credits in his acting career.\n\nWes Bentley\n\nBetter known these days as Jamie Dutton in the hit series Yellowstone, Wes has 50 acting credits to his name including American Beauty, Interstellar, The Hunger Games, and tons more.\n\nRoger Bumpass\n\nAccording to IMDB, Roger Bumpass has 186 credits in his acting career, most of which is voice-acting, and what has to be the most famous character is Squidward Tentacles from the SpongeBob Squarepants cartoons and movies.\n\nDaniel Davis\n\nNiles the Butler from The Nanny series... is from Arkansas? Yes, he is. Daniel Davis also played Captain Davenport in The Hunt For Red October, (love that movie) and a bunch more. IMDB has Davis with 58 acting credits.\n\nGil Gerard\n\nBedeBedeBedeBedeBede, what the heck, Buck? Gil Gerard, the guy who played Buck Rogers in the 25th Century is from Little Rock. I'm jealous, he got to hang out with '70s stunner Erin Grey.\n\nFrank Bonner\n\nHaving been in the radio business for most of my adult life I have worked more than once with a Herb Tarlek-type salesperson of WKRP in Cincinnati fame. To find out that Frank Bonner, the actor who played him, is from Arkansas? Get out of here... that's awesome. check out the clip below of Herb\n\nSo, hold on to your hats fans, the list is long and very recognizable."
