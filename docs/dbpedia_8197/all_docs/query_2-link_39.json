        "text": "The day you were born was one of the happiest days of our corporation’s life.\n\nSubject: It’s time to celebrate!\n\nDid you know that four out of five dentists recommend that you have a happy birthday? The fifth dentist hopes it’s extra sparkling white! Get 10% off teeth whitening when you book your six-month appointment today! And yes, from the looks of your chart, you absolutely need it.\n\nSmiles,\n\nBig Smile Dental Arts\n\nPS. For the love of god, fluoride is not the devil.\n\nSubject: Your b-day gift awaits!\n\nHappy birthday, Laura! Get $25 off your next manicure — when you refer a friend! You have a friend, don’t you? This is a promotion we do year round and not just on your birthday, but birthdays are a great time to be reminded of it.\n\nNever Chip and Always Tip,\n\nShiny Polish Nails\n\nSubject: OMG it’s your birthday!\n\nMount Sinai Hospital here, wishing you a happy and healthy birthday! To expedite your next visit (which you need since you are always late), please take a moment to update your medical history. We thought updating paperwork might be something fun for you to do on your birthday!\n\nThank you for trusting us with your healthcare, your literal life and so many co-pays. To show our appreciation, ENJOY 10% OFF our Mount Sinai Gift Shop where you can buy balloons, gift baskets and wilted floral arrangements.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAll of us at Mount Sinai\n\nSubject: Happy Birthday present for Laura!\n\nHappy birthday, from the family you hear from more than your real family (sorry, but you know it’s true!), no matter how many times you unsubscribe, your Bloomingdales fam! In honor of your special day, below is a coupon for 20% off any online purchase at Bloomingdales.com, except on all of the brands you like. Have you heard that it’s boot-season? Check out these just-arrived styles here!\n\nWe bet your biological family doesn’t even know what boots you like as much as the Blooms family algorithm, do they? Have they even texted you yet?\n\nWarmly,\n\nBloomingdales\n\nSubject: Warm Birthday Wishes\n\nDearest LAURA L.,\n\nOn your special day, we just want to say how much you, LAURA L., mean to us. The day you were born was one of the happiest days of our corporation’s life. That’s the day a legend was born. It seems like just yesterday we were kids without a care in the world and now look at us! If you weren’t in our life, we don’t know what we would do! Our corporate lives would have no meaning.\n\nWe are so grateful that you, LAURA L., are in our lives. The world is a better place with LAURA L. in it. We hope this new year is full of adventures, cherished memories and long, epic car rides.\n\nBook your next car here! You deserve it. Thank you for being you, LAURA L.!\n\nZipCar\n\nSubject: Namaste birthday yogi!\n\nMany, many, MANY moons ago, you were born! It’s people like you who have made our vibrant community possible. To say thanks, our birthday gift to you is a free towel, to borrow, when you come to any of our $45 drop-in classes this week. Pre-registration is required. No refunds. We appreciate you signing up for class whether you end up coming in human form or in spirit.\n\nWith gratitude and lots of wheel poses (you know what they say: when you hate a pose, you need to do it more, which is really a metaphor for life and how you need to push through difficult things, which gets harder when you’re as many moons old as you are, questioning the choices you made and wondering how another year has managed to pass you by),\n\nYoga Moves\n\nSubject: Birthday surprise for you and only you!\n\nHappy birthday, from your friends over at American Express! You deserve something really nice today. The present of your wildest dreams! And can you think of anything better than 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for 12 months from the date of account opening, then a variable APR of 19.24% to 29.99% when you sign up for a new Amex card? We can not.\n\nAnd let’s be real: you’re now well into your mid-thirties with next to no savings and no one to “sponsor” your travel this time. Just a birthday reality check, because no one knows you better than your corporate friends at Amex who see everything.\n\nWith love and lots of interest,\n\nAmex\n\nSubject: Fight On to our favorite birthday alumni!\n\nWhoo-hoo! On behalf of over 480,000 USC alumni around the world who have never heard of you, we wish you a happy birthday! So does Will Ferrell, who DJ’d a frat party at the school recently for his son. Did you see that? It was so cool. Too bad you didn’t have a famous parent when you went to school here to do cool things like that on your birthday. You would have been so much more popular and enjoyed your time at our school more if you had.\n\nAnyways, we’re thrilled to celebrate this occasion with such a valued member of our Trojan Family. If only things felt a little more mutual, you know? We’re sort of confused over here in the alumni department about why you haven’t donated any money to the school. Don’t you want your children to have any shot at coming here? Journalism can be extremely lucrative, if you’d made the right moves. Also, Will Ferrell didn’t actually send his wishes. He only does that for our more established alumni.\n\nFight on,\n\nUSC Alumni Association\n\nSubject: Birthday girl! Hi! It’s me!\n\nAflac duck here to wish you a happy-quack-birthday! Don’t let your special day get ruined by an unforeseen accident when you inevitably fall into a pothole on the way to your birthday dinner, break your leg and drown in the unexpected costs of ambulance fees, hospital bills, physical therapy and actual therapy. Do you want to be broke, have to quit your job and move back to Ohio all because you didn’t have supplemental insurance from an insufferable — yet bizarrely revolutionary and successful — two-decade-old duck? We know that’s your actual worst nightmare, but it’s not far from your reality!\n\nI don’t want that life for you. And neither does Deion Sanders, Nick Saban and a bunch of synchronized swimmers who are here to wish you a happy birthday!\n\nQuack,\n\nAflac"
