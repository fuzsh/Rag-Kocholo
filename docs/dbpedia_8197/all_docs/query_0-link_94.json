        "text": "Laura Mae Gall Catton was born April 10, 1926 to Henry and Lena (Ackerman) Gall. She grew up on a farm near Lesterville, SD with her siblings Arlene and Eddie.\n\nOn June 6th, 1948 Laura married Wilbur Catton in Hastings, NE in the home of Rev. Green and was married to Wilbur for almost 31 years before he passed away. She and Wilbur raised 2 children together: Pam and Todd.\n\nDuring her life Laura performed various jobs: waitress, Rexall Drug Store, telephone operator, Al’s Clothing Store, Scotland Nursing Home and M-Tron.\n\nWhen she retired from M-Tron she moved to Omaha to be closer to Pam and Todd. Even though she retired she wanted to stay busy, so she also worked part-time at K-Mart and Hallmark. At Hallmark she started one of her many collections of the Dickens’ Villages and had beautiful arrangements in several curio cabinets and hutches. She was always in charge of that village at the Hallmark store which she loved doing.\n\nHer life was about staying busy and enjoyed baking or her many hobbies. Her specialties were delicious desserts, candies, pies and cookies. She was famous for her Kuchen if you ask anyone that knew her, and she loved sharing those goodies with everyone to taste. She also enjoyed crocheting, needlecraft and counted cross stitch. Her afghans were beautiful and very detailed; many baby afghans that were so precious and filled with love for many babies. We all have mementos of her beautiful work. There was never a moment she wasn’t in her recliner working on a project along with her best friend Callie her beloved cat. She also loved to play card games such as Pinochle, Skip-Bo, UNO and many others. She was quite competitive and loved the challenge. She also loved watching her Chicago cubs and got to see a few spring games in Phoenix.\n\nLaura lived 94 wonderful years but has missed her loving husband Wilbur for 40 years. She took some wonderful trips with friends and got to go over to Europe where she enjoyed beautiful sights and experiences. She went to Alaska and saw glaciers and took a cruise and enjoyed the ocean, but she had always wanted to do these wonderful adventures with Wilbur. We know he was with her in heart, but she always wanted to experience these marvels with him. She’s now in his arms, at peace and home again.\n\nLaura went to her eternal home of rest on Thursday Dec. 10th at Oxbow Living Center in Ashland NE.\n\nShe is survived by children: Pam (Joe) Womeldorf, Todd (Lisa) Catton; grandchildren: Erica (Mari) Moore, Kylie (Jim) Schrader, Laura (Shane) Lundberg, Chris (Jennifer) Catton; great-grandchildren: Khalyl Moore, Apollo Moore, William Schrader, Bradly Schrader, Fenix Lundberg, Fury Lundberg, Carter Catton, Mason Catton, Lincoln Catton; also, close family friends Karen and Duane Jonas – step grandchildren: Steve (Janelle) Jonas, Lynette (Terry) Hauck, Jennifer (Jesse) Jansen, Megan Womeldorf, Ashley Womeldorf; step great grandchildren: Jordan Hauck, Mackenzie Hauck, Madison Hauck, Katelyn Jonas, Macy Jonas, Abriana Jansen; sisters-in-law Deanna King, Verda (Clarence) Sykora and many nieces and nephews.\n\nLaura was preceded in death by her husband, Wilbur Catton; parents, Henry and Lena Gall; sister, Arlene Vogt; and brother, Ed Gall."
