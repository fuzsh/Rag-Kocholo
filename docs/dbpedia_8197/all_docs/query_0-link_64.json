He attended the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for his undergraduate studies and obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Biology. He attended veterinary school through the University of Nebraska-Lincoln/Iowa State University – College of Veterinary Medicine joint program and graduated in May of 2020. Since graduating he has worked as an emergency veterinarian in Omaha and is now transitioning into general practice as his family continues to grow. Outside of work he enjoys spending time with his wife and kids especially doing outdoor activities, such as hiking, fishing and golfing.\n\nMatt Talbot\n\nDVM\n\nDr. Talbot is a dedicated practitioner known for his passion for animal care and mentorship, with over two decades of veterinary experience. Originally from Gordon, NE, he graduated from Kansas State University with his doctorate in veterinary medicine.

His commitment to providing excellent and compassionate care enriches our clinic daily!\n\nSqueaks\n\nClinic Cat\n\nMeet Squeaks, the reigning monarch of our clinic! This rotund tabby has been gracing our halls since 2021 with her royal presence. With a penchant for napping in sunbeams and indulging in treats, Squeaks knows how to live the good life. But don’t let her regal demeanor fool you, she’s also a mischievous troublemaker, especially when her partner in crime, Simon, is involved. Catch her in action during her catnip-fueled antics or witness her expertly execute her favorite prank on our practice manager by toppling Sarah’s water bottle when she’s not looking. Long live Queen Squeaks!\n\nSimon\n\nClinic Cat\n\nSimon, the dapper addition to our clinic’s feline crew! This debonair grey gentleman joined us in 2023 and has been stealing hearts ever since. Simon isn’t just a handsome face, he’s also an active enthusiast of the fetch game and a dedicated greeter of both our feline patients and their human companions. When he’s not strutting around like he owns the place (which, let’s be honest, he kind of does), you can find him lending a helping paw on our practice manager’s desk.\n\nSarah S.\n\nPractice Manager\n\nWith ACC since 2022\n\nHometown: Bellevue, NE\n\nFamily: Partner, Dan\n\nPets: Dog: Piper | Cats: Danica, Tonks, and Whiskey | 6 chickens | 7 ducks | bees\n\nHobbies: Homesteading/gardening, bee keeping, running with Piper, and raising money for the Alzheimer’s Association.\n\nFun Fact: I have an Associates Degrees in Radio Production, Promotions, Sales and Web Design, a Minor in Chemistry, and a Bachelor’s in Biology.\n\nAshley\n\nLicensed Veterinary Technician\n\nWith ACC since 2017\n\nHometown: Malcolm, NE\n\nPets: Dogs: Daisy, Poppy, and Cedar | Cats: Petunia and Cactus | Horse: Capone\n\nHobbies: Traveling, art, and dog shows.\n\nFun Fact: I have traveled to 13 countries.\n\nTiffany\n\nVeterinary Assistant\n\nWith ACC since 2019\n\nHometown: Raymond, NE\n\nPets: Dogs: Addie Bean and Saxxon | Cats: Dexter, Maxwell, and Stewart | 2 Horses | 1 Chinchilla\n\nFamily: 2 girls\n\nHobbies: Trail riding, traveling, volleyball, and gardening.\n\nFun Fact: I have a Cosmetology and Piercing License.\n\nPaige\n\nVeterinary Assistant\n\nWith ACC since 2023\n\nHometown: Weeping Water, NE\n\nPets: Dog: Reggie | Cat: Sullivan\n\nHobbies: Reading, cooking, and spending time with my family.\n\nFun Fact: My family has a non-profit that helps fund research, promote education, and give public awareness to suicide.\n\nSarah J.\n\nVeterinary Assistant\n\nWith ACC since 2005\n\nHometown: Adams, NE\n\nPets: Dogs: Kobe, Izzy, and Nora | Cat: Edgar | Chickens | Ducks\n\nHobbies: Embracing the great outdoors with a passion for hiking, volleyball, and all things nature\n\nFun Fact: Works full time at the zoo since 2005\n\nBrittany\n\nReceptionist\n\nWith ACC since 2023\n\nHometown: Wilber, NE\n\nPets: Dog: Malachi (You can find him up at reception most days) | Cats: Nahla and Athena\n\nHobbies: I love spending time with my husband Joe & our animals.
